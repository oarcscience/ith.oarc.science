This is a collection of two articles by E.A. Wallis Budge on the famous
Rosetta Stone, which was the key to the modern decipherment of the
Ancient Egyptian writing system. The first article is an essay from
Budge's 1893 anthology The Mummy, which discusses the stone, ancient and
medieval writings about hieroglyphics, and the competition between Young
and Champollion, the two 19th century scholars who eventually cracked
the code. He explains how the stone was used to piece together the
Egyptian alphabetic signs, the key to the rest of the hieroglyphics. The
second article is his 1905 translation of the text of the stone, which
turns out to be a fairly unremarkable Ptolemaic era decree.

This makes extensive use of polytonic Greek Unicode, so if you have
trouble viewing it, you should refer to [the sacred-texts Unicode
page](../../unicode.md). Longer passages in Greek were made into
thumbnailed image files.
