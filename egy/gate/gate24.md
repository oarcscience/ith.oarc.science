# CHAPTER X.

## THE GATE OF SET-HRA.

### THE EIGHTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT.

HAVING passed through the Seventh Division of the Tuat, the boat of the
Sun arrives at the gateway called BEKHKHI, which leads to the EIGHTH O
DIVISION, or, as the opening text reads:

This great god cometh forth to this gate, and entereth through it, and
the gods who are therein acclaim this great god." The gateway is like
that through which the god passed into the previous Division, and its
outwork is guarded by nine gods in the form of mummies, who are
described as the PAUT, i.e., the company of the nine gods.

At the entrance to the gate proper stands a bearded, mummied form, with
his hands folded on his breast, called BENEN, and at its exit stands a
similar form called HEPTTI, each of these is said

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

to "extend his arms and hands to Ra." The corridor is swept by flames of
fire, which proceed from the mouths of two uraei, as before. The company
of the gods who guard the outwork address Ra, and say, "Come thou to us,
O thou who art at the head of the horizon, O thou great god who openest
hidden places, open for thyself the holy pylons, and unfold the doors
thereof." The monster serpent, which stands on his tail and guards the
door, is called SET-HRA, and the two lines of text which refer to his
admission of Ra read, "He who is over this door openeth to Ra. SA saith
unto SET-HRA:--Open thy gate to Ra, unfold thy portal to KHUTI, So that
he may illumine the thick darkness, and may send light into the hidden
abode. This gate closeth after the great god hath passed through it, and
the souls who are on the other side of it wail when they hear the door
closing upon them."

In the middle of the Division we see the boat of Ra being towed on its
way by four gods of the Tuat, the god is in the same form as before, and
SA stands on the look-out, and Heka obeys his instructions as to the
steering. At the head of the

The Boat of Ra being towed through the Eighth Division of the Tuat by
the gods thereof.

 

four gods who tow the boat stands an aged god, who leans on a long
staff, and is called "He who dwelleth in Nu." Immediately in front of
the divine procession is a long tank, wherein we see four groups, each
containing four beings, who are represented in the act of performing
various evolutions in the water. These are called HERPIU, AKIU, NUBIU,
and KHEPAU,

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

which names may be translated "Bathers, Floaters, Swimmers, and Divers."

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

The first section of this text reads:--

This great god is towed along by gods of the Tuat, and behold, those who
tow Ra along say, "Let there be praise in heaven to the soul of Ra, and
let there be praise on earth to his body, for heaven is made young by
means of his soul, and earth is made young by means of his body. Hail!
We open for thee the hidden place, and we make straight for thee the
roads of Akert. Be thou at peace, O Ra, with thy hidden things, O thou
who art praised \[by\] thy secret things in thy forms (or, attributes).
Hail! We tow thee

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

along, O Ra, we guide thee, O thou who art at the head of heaven, and
thou comest forth to those who are immersed in the waters, and thou
shalt make thy way over them."

The passage which refers to the aged god reads:--

"He (literally, those) who is in Nu saith to those who are immersed in
the water, and to those who are swimming in the pools of water, 'Look ye
at Ra, who journeyeth in his boat, \[for he is\] Great of Mystery.

 

<span id="img_22500"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

The Four Herpiu Gods, and the Four Akiu Gods.

 

\[paragraph continues\] It is he who ordereth the destinies (or,
affairs) of the gods, it is he who performeth (or, maketh) the plans of
the Khu (i.e., the spirits). Hail! Rise up, O ye beings of time, pay ye
heed to Ra, for it is he who ordereth your destinies.'"

The speech of Ra reads:--

"Put forth your heads, O ye who are immersed in the water, thrust out
your arms, O ye who are under the waters, stretch out your legs, O ye
who swim, let there be breath to your nostrils, O ye who are deep

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

in the waters. Ye shall have dominion over your waters, ye shall be at
peace in your tanks of cool waters, ye shall pass through the waters of
Nu, and ye shall make a way through your cisterns. Your souls are upon
earth, and they shall be satisfied with their means of subsistence, and
they shall not suffer destruction. Their food shall consist of the
offerings of the earth, and meat and drink shall be given unto them upon
earth, even as to him that hath obtained dominion

 

<span id="img_22600"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

over his offerings upon earth, and whose soul is not upon the earth.
Their food shall consist of bread, and their drink shall be tchesert
wine, and their cisterns shall be full of cool water, and there shall be
offered unto them upon earth of that which this lake produceth."

In the upper register are the following:--

1\. Twelve bearded gods, who stand with their arms hanging by their
sides, and are described as the "divine sovereign chiefs who give the
bread which hath been

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

allotted and green herbs to the souls who are in the Lake of SERSER
(i.e., blazing fire),"

<span id="img_22701"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

Souls who are in the Lake of Serser.

 

2\. Nine bearded, human-headed and human-handed hawks, which stand with
their hands raised in adoration; before each is a loaf of bread, and a
few

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

green herbs. These are described as the "souls who are in the Lake of
Serser."

3\. A god, who holds a sceptre in his right hand, and in his left.

The portion of the text which refers to the twelve sovereign chiefs
reads:--

"These are they who make souls to have a right to the green herbs in the
Lake of Serser. Ra saith unto them:--'\[Hail, ye\] divine sovereign
princes of the gods, and ye chiefs of the Lake of Serser, who place
souls over their green herbs, let them have

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

dominion themselves over their bread; give ye your bread which is
appointed, and bring ye your green herbs to the souls who have been
ordered to exist in the Lake of Serser.' They say unto Ra:--'The bread
appointed hath been and the green herbs have been brought to the divine
souls whom thou hast ordered to exist in the Lake of Serser. Hail!
Verily, the way is fair; for KHENTI-AMENTI praiseth thee, and those who
dwell in TA-THENEN praise thee.' Their food is of bread-cakes, and their
beer is the *tchesert* beer, and their libations are of cool water; and
offerings are made unto them upon earth by those who are with (?) TUI by
the divine sovereign princes."

The passage which refers to the souls in the Lake of Serser reads:--

"These are they who are in the Land of Serser; 'they have received their
bread, and they have gained the mastery over this Lake, and they praise
this great god. Ra saith unto them:--'Eat ye your green herbs, and
satisfy ye yourselves with your cakes; let there be fulness to your
bellies, and satisfaction to your hearts. Your green herbs are of the
Lake of Serser, the Lake which may not be approached. Praise ye me,
glorify ye me, for I am the Great One of terror of the Tuat.' They say
unto Ra:--'Hail to thee, O thou Great One of the SEKHEMU (i.e., Powers)!
Praise is thine, and majesty is thine. The Tuat is thine, and \[is
subservient\] to thy will; it is a hidden place \[made\] by thee for

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

those who are in its Circles. The height of Heaven is thine, and \[is
subservient\] to thy will; it is a secret place \[made\] by thee for
those who belong thereto. The Earth is for thy dead Body, and the Sky is
for thy Soul. O Ra, be thou at peace (or, be content) with that which
thou hast made to come into being.' Their food consisteth of
bread-cakes, their green herbs are the plants of the spring, and the
waters wherein they refresh themselves are cool

Souls who are in the Lake of Serser. A god with a sceptre.

 

\[paragraph continues\] Offerings are made unto them upon the earth as
\[being\] the product of this Lake of Serser."

In the lower register are:--

1\. Horus \[the Aged\], in the form of a bearded man, leaning upon a
staff.

2\. Twelve bearded beings, who are described as the "burnt enemies of
Osiris." The first four have their arms tied

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

behind their back in such a way that the right hand projects at the left
side, and the left hand at the right side. The second four have their
hands tied together at the elbows, and the upper parts of the arms are
at right angles to their shoulders. The third four have their arms tied
together at the elbows, and their elbows are on a lower level than their
shoulders.

3\. A monster speckled serpent, which lies in undulations immediately in
front of the enemies of Osiris,

 

<span id="img_23200"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/23200.jpg.md)

and belches fire into the face of their leader; the name of this serpent
is KHETI, In each undulation stands a bearded god in mummied form, and
the hieroglyphics written above describe them as "the gods who are above
KHETI,"

The text reads:--

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

"\[This scene representeth\] what Horus doeth for his father Osiris. The
enemies c who are in this scene have their calamities ordered for them
by Horus, who saith unto them:--Let there be fetters on your arms, O
enemies of my father, let your arms be tied up towards your heads, O ye
who have no \[power\], ye shall be fettered \[with your arms\] behind
you, O ye who are hostile to Ra. Ye shall be backed in pieces,

 

<span id="img_23400"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/23400.jpg.md)

 

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

ye shall nevermore have your being, your souls shall be destroyed, and
none \[of you\] shall live because of what ye have done to my father
Osiris; ye have put \[his\] mysteries behind your backs, and ye have
dragged out the statue \[of the god\] from the secret place. The word of
my father Osiris is *maat* against you, and my word is *maat* against
you, O ye who have desecrated (literally, laid bare) the hidden things
which concern the rest (or, resting-place) of the Great One who begot me
in the Tuat. O ye shall cease to exist, ye shall come to an end."'

"Horus saith:--'\[O\] my serpent KHET, thou Mighty Fire, from whose
mouth cometh forth this flame which is in my Eye, whose undulations are
guarded by \[my\] children, open thy mouth, distend thy jaws, and belch
forth thy fires against the enemies of my father, burn thou up their
bodies, consume their souls by the fire which issueth from thy mouth,
and by the flames which are in thy body. My divine children are against
them, they destroy \[their\] spirits, and those who have come forth from
me are against them, and they shall never more exist. The fire which is
in this serpent shall come forth, and shall blaze against these enemies
whensoever Horus decreeth that it shall do so.' Whosoever knoweth how to
use words of power \[against\] this serpent shall be as one who doth not
enter upon his fiery path."

The end of this text on the sarcophagus of Seti I. is

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

defective, but from the tomb of Rameses VI. we see that it should end
thus:--"Offerings shall be made to these gods who are upon this great
serpent. Their food is of bread, their drink is of *tesher* beer, and
the waters of their libations are cool."
