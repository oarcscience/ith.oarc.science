# THE TENTH HOUR.

The majesty of this great god taketh up his position in this Circle, and
he sendeth forth words to the gods who are in it.

AA-KHEPERU-MES-ARU is the name of the gate of this City through which
this great god passeth.

METCH-QA-UTEBU is the name of this City. \[This is\] the secret Circle
of Amentet whereto KHEPERA joineth himself before Ra, and the gods, and
the spirits, and the dead cry out from it over the secret
representations (or, images) Of AKERT.

Whosoever shall make \[a copy of\] these \[representations\] according
to the figures which are depicted on the east \[wall\] of Ament, and
whosoever knoweth them by their names shall journey round about in the
Tuat, and shall travel through it, and he shall not be driven back, and
he shall flourish with Ra.

TENTENIT-HESQ-KHAKABU is the name of the hour of the night which guideth
this great god through the secret ways of this City.
