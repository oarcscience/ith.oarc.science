# THE NINTH HOUR.

When the majesty of this great god hath taken up his position in this
Circle, he sendeth forth words from his Boat to the gods who dwell
therein, and the sailors join the, Boat of this great god in this City.

SAA-KEB is the name of the gate of this City through which this great
god passeth to take up his position on the stream which is in this City.

BES-ARU is the name of this City, which is the secret Circle of AMENTET,
wherein take up their positions in the Tuat this great god and his
sailors.

Whosoever maketh \[a copy of\] these things in their names according to
the similitudes which are in writing on the east \[wall\] of the Hidden
Palace of the Tuat, and whosoever knoweth their names upon earth, and
knoweth their habitations in Amentet, shall rest in his habitation in
the Tuat, and he shall stand up among the lords of the provisions of the
gods, and his voice shall be *maat* before the *tchatcha* beings on the
day of the reckoning of Pharaoh (literally, the thrice great house). And
these things shall act as magical protectors to him that knoweth them
upon earth.

MAK-NEB-S is the name of the hour of the night which guideth this great
god in this Circle.
