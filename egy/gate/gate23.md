# CHAPTER IX.

## THE GATE OF AKHA-EN-MAAT.

### THE SEVENTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT.

THE boat of the Sun having passed through the Sixth Division of the Tuat
arrives at the gateway which leads to the SEVENTH DIVISION. This gateway
is similar to that which guards the Sixth Division, and is guarded by
nine gods, who are described as the "Seventh Company;" at the entrance
to the corridor, and at its exit, stands a bearded god, with arms
hidden, the former being called SHEPI, and the latter HEQES (?), and
each is said to extend his arms and hands to Ra. The corridor is swept
by flames of fire as before. The gateway is called PESTIT, and the text
says, "This great god cometh to this gateway, and entereth in through
it, and the gods who are therein acclaim him."

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Part of the text of the speech which the nine
gods make to Ra is broken away, but what remains reads, "Open the secret
places, open the holy pylons, and unfold the hidden portals." The
monster serpent which stands on his tail and guards the gateway is
called AKHA-EN-MAAT, and the two lines of text which refer to his
admission of Ra read, "He who is over this door openeth to Ra. SA saith
to AKHA-EN-MAAT <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_24.md):--'Open thy gate to
Ra, unfold thy doors to KHUTI, that he may send light into the thick
darkness and may make his radiance illumine the hidden habitation! This
door is shut after the great god hath passed through it, and there is
lamentation to those who are in this gateway when they hear this door
close upon them." A portion of the text is mutilated, but it can be
restored with certainty. <span id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_25.md)

In the middle of this Division we see the boat of Ra being towed on its
way by four gods of the Tuat; the god is in the same form as before, and
stands in a shrine enveloped by MEHEN. SA stands in the bows and HEKA at
the stern. The text relating to the god reads:--

The Boat of Ra being towed through the Seventh Division of the Tuat by
the gods thereof.

 

"The gods of the Tuat tow along this great god, and they say unto
Ra:--'Thou art towed along, O great god, lord of the hours, who dost
work on behalf of those who are under the earth.' The gods have life in
his attributes, and the spirits look upon his forms. And Ra saith unto
them:--'There is magical protection to you, O ye who tow, and there is
holiness to

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

you, O ye who tow and bring me into the nethermost parts of the Tuat,
tow ye me along until \[ye arrive\] at the chambers (?), and take ye
your stand upon the hidden mountain of the horizon."

In front of the divine towers of the boat march:--

1\. Twelve bearded gods, the AMENNU-AAIU-KHERU-SHETAU, whose hands and
arms are bidden; they are described as "hidden of hands and arms and
possessing hiddenness." The text relating to them reads:--

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

"These are they who possess the hiddenness (or, who hold the mystery) of
this great god. Verily those who are in the Tuat see him, and the dead
see him, who burn in Het-Benben (or, the temple of Ra), and they come
forth to the place where is the body of this god. Ra saith unto
them:--'Receive ye my forms, and embrace ye your hidden forms (or,
mysteries). Ye shall be in Het-Benben, the place where my body is. The
hiddenness which is in you is the hiddenness of the Tuat, and cover ye
your arms therewith.' And they say unto Ra:--'Let thy soul be in heaven,
at the head of the horizon, let thy shadow penetrate the hidden place,
and let thy body be to the earth; as for the upper regions of the sky we
ascribe Ra thereto . . . . . Fulfil thou thyself, and take thou thy
place \[with\] thy body in the Tuat.' Their food consisteth of offerings
of every kind whereby souls become content, and offerings are made unto
them upon earth by reason of the sight of the light in the 'Tuat."

2\. Eight bearded gods, the NETERU-HETI, who stand

upright, with their hands hanging by their sides, and are described as
"the gods of the temples," and eight gods, the SENNU, who stand upright,
with their arms held straight together in front of them, at a little
distance from their bodies. The text which refers to them reads:--

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

"These are they who are outside Het-Benben, and they see Ra with their
eyes, and they enter into his secret (or, hidden) images that which is
theirs is apportioned, and the SENNU gods bring it. \[And Ra\] saith
unto them:--'My offerings (or, provisions) are from your offerings, and
my nourishment is from your nourishment which is to you, O ye who are in
my secret places. I protect my secret things which are in Het-Benben.
Hail to you! Your souls live, and their offerings are the offerings of
KHUTI.' TUATI saith unto them:--'O ye gods who dwell in the Tuat, who
are in the divine \[places\] of the governor of Ament, to whom what is
their due is given upon their ground, who lie down upon their own lands,
your own flesh is to you, ye have gathered together your bones, ye have
knit together your members, and ye have collected your flesh. There are,
moreover, sweet winds to your nostrils, ye have girded on your apparel,
and ye have put on your wigs.'

In the upper register are:--

1\. Twelve gods, the KHERU-METAU\[H\], each of whom holds a stake or
weapon, forked at one end; they are described as "those who hold the
*metau* weapons."

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

The text relating to these reads:--

"Ra saith unto them:--'Receive ye your *metauh* weapons, and take ye
them with you. Hail to you, \[go against\] the serpent fiend MAMU; bail
to you, make ye gashes in him when the heads appear from

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

out of him, and turn ye him backwards.' They say unto Ra:--'Our *metauh*
weapons in our hands are for Ra \[and against\] MAMU, and we will make
gashes in the great and evil WORM. O Ra, do away the heads when they
come forth from the windings of the serpent KHETI These are the gods who
are in the \[Boat of Ra\], and they repulse Apep in the sky, and they
travel through the Tuat. It is their duty to

turn back Apep on behalf of Ra in Amentet and the places of the Tuat.
And this god allotteth to them their provisions of bread, and their beer
is the *tchesert* drink, and their libations are of cool water, and
offerings are made to them upon earth because they repulse the Enemy of
Ra in Amentet."

2\. The gods KHERU-AMU-PERERU-TEPU-EM-QEBU-F, and the monster serpent
SEBA-APEP, the body of which is held

up above the ground by twelve bearded gods, who are described as "those
who have food when the heads appear from his folds." Twelve human heads
grow out from his body,

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

the first appearing from his head, and the other eleven from his back.
The text which relates to them reads:--

"These are they who are the adversaries of his two-fold evil, and who
overthrow the enemies of Ra, and it is their duty to seize the
SEBA-Fiend when he maketh heads to come forth from him. \[Ra\] saith to

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

them:--'Turn ye back SEBA, make ye to go backwards APEP when the heads
appear from out of him, and let him perish.' \[Ra\] ordereth for him his
destruction. 'O heads, ye shall be eaten, ye shall be eaten, ye shall be
consumed, when ye come forth from him.' Ra ordereth for them when they
come forth that they shall be consumed (or, swallowed up) \[in\] their
folds when he journeyeth to them, and that the heads shall retreat
within their folds. The WORM HEFAU shall be without eyes, and he shall
be without his nose, and he shall be without his ears, and he shall
exist upon his roarings, and he shall live upon that which he himself
uttereth. The food \[of these gods\] consisteth of the offerings \[which
are made to them\] upon earth."

3\. An upright, bearded mummied form called QAN. To the neck of this
figure are attached two ropes, which are twisted together symmetrically,
and are grasped by twelve bearded men with both hands. Each god stands
within a loop formed by the two ropes, and has a star before him. The
gods are described as "those who hold the rope which cometh forth . . .
. . . . ."

The text reads:--

with the rope, the hours of the gods(?) are to thee, O Ra, with light.
Rest thou and thy hidden body . . . . .. Their provisions of loaves of
bread are to them, their beer is *tchesert*, and their libations are of
cool water, and offerings are made to them upon earth."

The text relating to these reads:

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

"The god Tuati saith unto them:--'Hail, O ye gods

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

who are over the Tuat, ye gods who dwell in this \[place\] of the
governor of Ament, who abide permanently on your places, and who lie
down upon your couches, lift up the flesh of your bodies, and gather
together your bones, and gird up your members, and bring ye into one
place your flesh! There is sweet (or, fresh) air for your nostrils.
Loose and take off your funeral swathings, untie and remove your wigs,
unclose your eyes and look ye at the light therewith, rise ye up from
out of your inert and helpless state, and take possession yourselves of
your fields in Sekhet-nebt-hetepu (i.e., Field, lord of offerings).
There are fields for you in this Field, and the waters thereof are for
you. Let your offering be there, \[and\] fields from Nebt-hetepu.' Their
libations shall be of water. It is the serpent NEHEP who giveth their
bodies \[and\] their souls, and they journey on to SEKHET-AARU to have
dominion over their libations, and to walk over the earth. They count up
their flesh, their food is of bread-cakes, and their drink is of
*tchesert* ale, and their libations are of water. Offerings are made
unto them upon earth as \[unto\] the god SAH, who resteth upon his
ground."

"These are they who are in the circuit of this pool. There is a serpent
living in this pool, and the water of the pool is of fire, and the gods
of the earth and the souls of the earth cannot descend thereto by reason
of the flames of fire of this serpent. This

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

great god who is the governor of the Tuat liveth in the water of this
pool."

And Ra, saith unto them:--"Hail to you, O ye gods who guard this holy
pool, give ye yourselves to him that is the Governor of Aukert. The
water of this pool is Osiris, and this water is KHENTI-TUAT. This flame
consumeth and destroyeth the souls which dare to approach Osiris, and
the awe of this pool cannot be done away, or made an end of, or
overcome. As for the gods who keep ward over its waters, their food is
bread, and their drink is *tchesert* ale, and their libations are of
water. Offerings are made unto them upon earth as unto TERI in Amentet,
lord of (offerings. There are fields for you in this Field, and the
waters thereof are for you. Let your offerings be there \[and\] fields
from Nebt-hetepu. Their libations shall be of water. It is the serpent
NEHEP who giveth their bodies \[and\] their souls, and they journey into
SEKHET-AARU to have dominion over their libations, and to walk on the
earth. They count up their limbs, their food is of bread-cakes, and
their drink is of *tchesert* ale, and their libations are of water.
Offerings are made unto them upon earth as unto SAH, who resteth upon
his ground.

"These are they who are in the circuit of this pool. There is a serpent
living . . . . . ."
