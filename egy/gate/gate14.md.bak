# THE TWELFTH HOUR.

The majesty of this great god taketh up his position in this Circle at
the limits of the thick darkness, and this great god is born under the
form of KHEPERA in this Circle. The gods NU and AMMUI, and HEH and
HEH\[UT\] are in this Circle at the birth of this great god, when he
maketh his appearance from the Tuat, and taketh up his place in the
Matet Boat, and riseth from between the thighs of the goddess Nut.

THENEN-NETERU is the name of the gate of this City.

KHEPER-KEKUI-KHA-MESTI is the name of this City. \[This is\] the secret
Circle of the Tuat, wherein this great god is born, when he maketh his
appearance in NU, and taketh up his place in the body of NUT.

Whosoever shall make \[a copy\] of these \[representations\] according
to the figures which are depicted on the east \[wall\] of the palace of
Ament of the Tuat, they shall be magical protectors to him that knoweth
them upon earth, both in heaven and on earth.

At this point the light beginneth \[to come\], and it is the end of the
thick darkness which Ra travelleth through in Amentet, and of the secret
matters which this great god performed therein. He who hath no knowledge
of the whole (?) or part (?) of the secret

representations of the Tuat, shall be condemned to destruction.

Whosoever shall make \[a copy\] of these \[representations\] according
to this copy of what is in the Ament of the Tuat, \[which\] cannot be
looked at or seen, and whosoever shall know these secret images shall be
in the condition of the spirit who is equipped \[for journeying\], and
shall come forth \[from\] and shall descend into the Tuat, and shall
hold converse with the men and women who live \[there\] regularly and
unfailingly, millions of times.
