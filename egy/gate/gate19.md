# CHAPTER V.

## THE GATE OF TCHETBI.

### THE FOURTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT.

THE boat of the sun having passed through the Third Division of the Tuat
arrives at the gateway which leads to the Fourth Division. This gateway
is like that which admitted the god into the Third Division and its
outwork is guarded by nine gods, in the form of mummies, who are
described as the "third company of the gods of the great god who are
within." At the entrance to the corridor which runs between the two
walls is a god in mummied form called ENUERKHATA, and at the exit is a
similar god called SETA-TA, each god has a uraeus over his brow, and
each is said to "extend his arms and hands to Ra." The corridor is swept
by flames of fire which proceed from the mouths of two serpents,
stationed each at an angle, and their "fire is for Ra." The gateway of
the Fourth Division is called NEBT-S-TCHEFAU,

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

and the text says, "This great god cometh to this gateway, and entereth
in through it, and the gods who are therein acclaim him." The company of
gods say to Ra, "Open thou the earth, force thou a way through the Tuat
and the region which is above, and dispel our darkness; hail, Ra, come
thou to us." The monster serpent which stands on his tail and guards the
gateway is called TCHETBI, and the two lines of text which refer to his
admission of Ra read, "He who is over this door openeth to Ra. SA saith
to TCHETBI:--'Open \[thy\] gate to Ra, unfold thy doors to KHUTI, that
he may send light into the thick darkness, and may make his radiance
illumine the hidden habitation.' This door is shut after this great god
hath passed through it, and there is lamentation to those who are in
this gateway when they hear this door close upon them."

In the middle of this Division we see the boat of Ra being towed on its
way by four gods of the Tuat; the god is in the same form as before, and
stands in a shrine enveloped by MEHEN. SA stands in the bows, and HEKA
at the stern. The boat advances to a long, low building with a heavy
cornice, which contains nine small shrines or chapels; in each of these
is a god in mummied form lying on his back. The nine gods are described
as the "gods who follow Osiris, who are in their abodes" (literally,
"holes"). Immediately in front of the nine shrines are two groups, each
containing six women, who stand upon a slope, one half of which appears
to be land and the other half water; these women are called "the hour
goddesses which are in the Tuat." Each group is separated from the other
by a monster serpent of many folds called HERERET, and of him it is said
that he spawneth twelve serpents to be devoured by the hours."

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

\[paragraph continues\] The text relating to the passage of the boat of
the sun reads:--

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

"This great god is drawn along by the gods of the Tuat, and he,
journeyeth in the hidden place, and worketh in respect of the things
which are there.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

\[paragraph continues\] \[He saith:--\] 'Draw ye me along, O ye beings
of the Tuat, look ye upon me, \[for\] I have created you. Pull ye with
your arms and draw ye me therewith, and turn ye aside to the eastern
part of heaven, to the habitations which surround ARES (or, SAR) \[and
to\] that hidden mountain, the light (or, radiance) of which goeth round
about among the gods who receive me as I come forth among you into the
hidden place. Draw ye me along, \[for\] I work on your behalf in the
gateway which covereth over the gods of the Tuat.'"

"And Ra saith unto them:--'Look ye upon me, O gods, for I strike those
who are in their sepulchres, \[saying\], Arise, O ye gods! I have
ordered for you the plan and manner of your existence, O ye who are in
your sepulchres, whose souls are broken, who live upon your own filth
and feed upon your own offal, rise up before my Disk, and put ye
yourselves in a (right state by means of my beams. The duties which ye
shall have in the Tuat are in conformity with the things which I have
decreed for you.' Their food consisteth of flesh, and their ale is
\[made\] of the red \[barley\], and their libations are of cool water.
There is lamentation to them after they have heard their doors close
upon them."

In respect of the twelve goddesses of the hours it is said:--"\[These
are\] they who stand upon their lake, and it is they who guide Ra in a
straight line by means of their instruments. To them Ra
saith:--"Hearken, O ye goddesses of the hours of the night

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

sky. Work ye, and eat ye, and rest ye in your gateways, with your
breasts towards the darkness, and your hind-parts towards the light.
Make to stand up the serpent HERERET, and live ye upon that which cometh
forth from it. It is your duty in the Tuat to eat up the spawn of
HERERET, and ye shall destroy that which cometh forth from it. Draw ye
me, for I have begotten you in order that ye may pay homage \[to me\].
Take ye your rest (or, be at peace), O ye Hours!' Their food consisteth
of cakes of bread, and their ale is \[made\] of the red \[barley\], and
their draughts are of cool water, and there is given unto them as their
food that which cometh forth with the *khu* (i.e., the beatified dead)."

On the right hand of the path of the boat of the Sun in the Fourth
Division we see:--1. Twelve gods, bearded and standing upright, who are
called "the gods who carry along their doubles," 2. Twelve jackal-headed
gods, who stand round the "Lake of Life," who are called the "jackals in
the lake of life," 3. Ten uraei, which stand round the Lake of the
Uraei," and are called the Living Uraei."

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

The paragraph which refers to the first twelve gods reads:--

"\[These are\] they who bear along their doubles, who immerse themselves
in that which floweth in abundance from the slaughtered ones during the
time of their existence, and who carry the offerings which are rightly
due \[to the god\] to his abode. Unto them

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

saith Ra:--'That which belongeth to you \[to do\], O ye gods who are
among your offerings, is to offer as an obligatory offering your
doubles. Ye have your own offerings, your enemies are destroyed, and
they are not. Your spirits are on their thrones, \[and your\] souls are
on their places.' They say unto Ra, 'Adorations be unto thee, O
RA-KHUTI! Hail to thee, O thou Soul who art protected in the earth! Hail
to thee, as being eternity, the lord of the years and of the
everlastingness which hath no diminution.' Their food consisteth of
offerings, their drink is of cool water, and there is lamentation to
them when they hear their doors close upon them. Their food is given to
them from the goddess Mu-sta (?) by TESERT-BAIU."

The paragraph which refers to the jackal-headed gods reads:--

"\[These are\] they who come forth from this lake whereunto the souls of
the dead cannot approach by reason of the sanctity which is therein.
Unto them saith Ra:--'That which belongeth to you \[to do\], O ye gods
who are in this lake, is to keep guard upon your lives in your lake;
your offerings are under the guard of the jackals which have set
themselves on the edge of your lake.' They say unto Ra:--'Immerse
thyself, O Ra, in thy holy lake, wherein the lord of the gods immersed
himself, whereunto the souls of the dead approach not; this is what thou
thyself hast commanded, O KHUTI.' Their food consisteth of bread, their
drink is \[made\] of the red \[barley\], and their

vessels of drink are filled with wine. There is lamentation among them
when they hear their doors close upon them. Their food is given unto
them as lord\[s\] of their sceptres round about this lake."

The paragraph which refers to the uraei reads:--

"\[These are\] they who have their speech after Ra cometh to them, and
souls are turned backwards, and shadows are destroyed at the hearing of
the words (or, voices) of the uraei. Unto them saith Ra:--'That which
belongeth to you \[to do\], O ye URAEI who are in this lake, is to guard
your flames and your fires \[so that ye may hurl them\] against my
(literally, his) enemies, and your burning heat against those whose
mouths are evil. Hail to you, O URAEI.' They say unto Ra:--'Come thou to
us, stride thou over TANEN.'"

On the left of the path of the boat of the sun through the Fourth
Division we see the god Osiris, in mummied form, and wearing on his head
the crown of the South, standing on a serpent, and partially covered by
the earth of a mountain; his head only is above the ground, and he
stands in a naos with a vaulted dome. His name or title, KHENT AMENTI,
is written by his side. Before the shrine is a Flame-goddess in the form
of a uraeus, and behind her are twelve gods, who stand in front of
HERU-UR (or, Horus the Aged), the Haroeris of the later Greek writers.
Heru-ur is in the form of a hawk-headed

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

man, who leans on a staff. Behind the shrine which contains Osiris stand
twelve gods, who are described as "the gods who are behind the shrine,"
Behind, or by the side of these, are four pits or hollows in the ground,
by the side of each of which stands a god, with his body bent forward in
adoration before a bearded god, who holds the symbol of life in the
right hand and a sceptre in the left. The four gods are called "Masters
of their pits," and their lord is called the "Master of Earths (?)."

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

The text referring to Horus reads:--

"Horus worketh on behalf of his father Osiris, he performeth magical
ceremonies for him, and restoreth to him the crown \[, saying\], 'My
heart goeth out to thee, O my father, thou who art avenged on those who
would work against thee, and in all the matters which concern thee thou
art guided by magical ceremonies. Thou hast the mastery, O Osiris, thou
hast the sovereignty, O KHENTI AMENTI, thou hast whatsoever is thine as
Governor of the Tuat, O thou whose forms (or, attributes) are exalted in
the hidden place the beatified spirits hold thee in fear, and the dead
are terrified at thee. Thy crown hath been restored unto thee, and I,
thy son Horus, have reckoned thy weakness there.'"

The twelve gods who are in front of the shrine of Khenti Amenti say:--

"Let Him of the Tuat be exalted! Let Khenti Amenti be adored! Thy son
Horus hath restored to

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

thee thy crown, he hath protected thee by means of magical ceremonies,
he hath crushed for thee thine enemies, he hath brought to thee vigour
for thy arms, O Osiris, Khenti Amenti."

In reply to this address of the twelve gods Khenti Amenti saith unto his
son Horus:--

"Come to me, O my son Horus, and avenge me on those who work against me,
and cast them to him that is over the things which destroy, \[for\] it
is he who guardeth the pits \[of destruction\]."

Then saith Horus unto those gods who are behind the shrine:--

"Make inquisition for me, O gods who are in the following of Khenti
Amenti, stand ye up, and withdraw ye not yourselves, and be ye masters
over yourselves, and come, and live delicately on the bread of HU, and
drink ye of the ale of Maat, and live ye upon that whereon my father
liveth there. That which belongeth to you in the hidden place is to be
behind the shrine, according to the commandment of Ra. I call unto you,
and behold, it is for you to do what it is your duty \[to do\].' Their
meat consisteth of cakes of bread, and their ale is of the *tchesert*
drink, and their libations are \[made with\] cool water. Their food is
given unto them by the guardian of the things which are in the shrine.
And Horus saith unto these gods:--'Smite ye the enemies of my father,
and hurl ye them down into your pits because of that deadly evil which
they have done against the

to you to do in the Tuat is to guard the pits of fire according as Ra
hath commanded, and I set \[this\] before you so that, behold, ye may do
according to what belongeth to you \[to do\].' This god standeth over
(or, by) the pits."
