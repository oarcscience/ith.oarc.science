<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>THE boat of the Sun having passed through the Sixth Division of the Tuat arrives at the gateway which leads to the SEVENTH DIVISION. This gateway is similar to that which guards the Sixth Division, and is guarded by nine gods, who are described as the "Seventh Company;" at the entrance to the corridor, and at its exit, stands a bearded god, with arms hidden, the former being called SHEPI, and the latter HEQES (?), and each is said to extend his arms and hands to Ra. The corridor is swept by flames of fire as before. The gateway is called PESTIT, and the text says, "This great god cometh to this gateway, and entereth in through it, and the gods who are therein acclaim him."</P>
<P><A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Part of the text of the speech which the nine gods make to Ra is broken away, but what remains reads, "Open the secret places, open the holy pylons, and unfold the hidden portals." The monster serpent which stands on his tail and guards the gateway is called AKHA-EN-MAAT, and the two lines of text which refer to his admission of Ra read, "He who is over this door openeth to Ra. SA saith to AKHA-EN-MAAT&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:--'Open thy gate to Ra, unfold thy doors to KHUTI, that he may send light into the thick darkness and may make his radiance illumine the hidden habitation! This door is shut after the great god hath passed through it, and there is lamentation to those who are in this gateway when they hear this door close upon them." A portion of the text is mutilated, but it can be restored with certainty.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>
<P>In the middle of this Division we see the boat of Ra being towed on its way by four gods of the Tuat; the god is in the same form as before, and stands in a shrine enveloped by MEHEN. SA stands in the bows and HEKA at the stern. The text relating to the god reads:--</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>"The gods of the Tuat tow along this great god, and they say unto Ra:--'Thou art towed along, O great god, lord of the hours, who dost work on behalf of those who are under the earth.' The gods have life in his attributes, and the spirits look upon his forms. And Ra saith unto them:--'There is magical protection to you, O ye who tow, and there is holiness to</P>
<P><A NAME="page_195"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 195</FONT></A></P>
<P>you, O ye who tow and bring me into the nethermost parts of the Tuat, tow ye me along until [ye arrive] at the chambers (?), and take ye your stand upon the hidden mountain of the horizon."</P>
<P>In front of the divine towers of the boat march:--</P>
<P>1. Twelve bearded gods, the AMENNU-AAIU-KHERU-SHETAU, whose hands and arms are bidden; they are described as "hidden of hands and arms and possessing hiddenness." The text relating to them reads:--</P>
<P><A NAME="page_196"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 196</FONT></A></P>
<P>"These are they who possess the hiddenness (or, who hold the mystery) of this great god. Verily those who are in the Tuat see him, and the dead see him, who burn in Het-Benben (or, the temple of Ra), and they come forth to the place where is the body of this god. Ra saith unto them:--'Receive ye my forms, and embrace ye your hidden forms (or, mysteries). Ye shall be in Het-Benben, the place where my body is. The hiddenness which is in you is the hiddenness of the Tuat, and cover ye your arms therewith.' And they say unto Ra:--'Let thy soul be in heaven, at the head of the horizon, let thy shadow penetrate the hidden place, and let thy body be to the earth; as for the upper regions of the sky we ascribe Ra thereto . . . . . Fulfil thou thyself, and take thou thy place [with] thy body in the Tuat.' Their food consisteth of offerings of every kind whereby souls become content, and offerings are made unto them upon earth by reason of the sight of the light in the 'Tuat."</P>

<P>"These are they who are outside Het-Benben, and they see Ra with their eyes, and they enter into his secret (or, hidden) images that which is theirs is apportioned, and the SENNU gods bring it. [And Ra] saith unto them:--'My offerings (or, provisions) are from your offerings, and my nourishment is from your nourishment which is to you, O ye who are in my secret places. I protect my secret things which are in Het-Benben. Hail to you! Your souls live, and their offerings are the offerings of KHUTI.' TUATI saith unto them:--'O ye gods who dwell in the Tuat, who are in the divine [places] of the governor of Ament, to whom what is their due is given upon their ground, who lie down upon their own lands, your own flesh is to you, ye have gathered together your bones, ye have knit together your members, and ye have collected your flesh.

<P>In the upper register are:--</P>

O Ra, do away the heads when they come forth from the windings of the serpent KHETI These are the gods who are in the [Boat of Ra], and they repulse Apep in the sky, and they travel through the Tuat.

<P>them:--'Turn ye back SEBA, make ye to go backwards APEP when the heads appear from out of him, and let him perish.' [Ra] ordereth for him his destruction. 'O heads, ye shall be eaten, ye shall be eaten, ye shall be consumed, when ye come forth from him.' Ra ordereth for them when they come forth that they shall be consumed (or, swallowed up) [in] their folds when he journeyeth to them, and that the heads shall retreat within their folds. The WORM HEFAU shall be without eyes, and he shall be without his nose, and he shall be without his ears, and he shall exist upon his roarings, and he shall live upon that which he himself uttereth. The food [of these gods] consisteth of the offerings [which are made to them] upon earth."</P>
<P>3. An upright, bearded mummied form called QAN. To the neck of this figure are attached two ropes, which are twisted together symmetrically, and are grasped by twelve bearded men with both hands. Each god stands within a loop formed by the two ropes, and has a star before him. The gods are described as "those who hold the rope which cometh forth . . . . . . . ."</P>
