# THE ELEVENTH HOUR.

The majesty of this great god taketh up his position in this Circle, and
he sendeth forth words unto the gods who are therein.

SEKHEN-TUATIU is the name of the gate of this City through which this
great god passeth.

RE-EN-QERERT-APT-KHAT is the name of this City. \[This is\] the secret
Circle of the Tuat into which this great god passeth on his way, and
\[he\] cometh forth at the eastern mountain of the sky, the eater of
eternity. The form thereof is in the presence of the serpent PETRA,
which dwelleth in this City, and they (i.e., the gods) place themselves
in the train of \[Ra\] when the birth of KHEPER upon earth is about to
take place.

Whosoever shall make \[a copy\] of these \[representations\] according
to the figures which are depicted on the east \[wall\] of the palace of
Ament in the hidden \[places\] of the Tuat, and whosoever knoweth them
shall be in the position of him that divideth his offering, and of him
who is a spirit who is suitably equipped \[to travel\] both in heaven
and upon earth, regularly and unceasingly.

SEBIT-NEB-UAA-KHESEF-SEBIU-EM-PERT-F is the name of the hour of the
night which guideth this great god in this Circle.
