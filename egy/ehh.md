# The Egyptian Heaven and Hell

## by E. A. Wallis Budge

#### \[1905\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a three volume collection of texts and commentary about the
Ancient Egyptian alternate reality called the Tuat. The Tuat was both
the region that the boat of the Sun God Ra traversed during the night,
and the place where inhabitants of this world went after death. A
description of the Tuat, and its inhabitants and portals, was inscribed
on the walls of the tombs of all social strata.
