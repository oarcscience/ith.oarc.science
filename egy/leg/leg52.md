\[In § XXIV. Plutarch goes on to say that the Assyrians commemorate
Semiramis, the Egyptians Sesostris, the Phrygians Manis or Masdis, the
Persians Cyrus, and the Macedonians Alexander, yet these heroes are not

of gods have afterwards had to suffer the reproach of vanity and
presumption, and impiety and injustice.\]
