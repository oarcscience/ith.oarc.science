VII\. As to sea-fish, the Egyptians in general do not abstain from all
kinds of them, but some from one sort and some from another. Thus, for
example, the inhabitants of Oxyrhynchus <span
id="fr_274"></span>[1](#fn_272.md) will not touch any that have been taken
with an angle; for as they pay especial reverence to the Oxyrhynchus
Fish, <span id="fr_275"></span>[2](#fn_273.md) from whence they derive
their name, they are afraid lest perhaps the hook may be defiled by
having been at

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

some time or other employed in catching their favourite fish. The people
of Syene <span id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_274.md) in like manner abstain
from the Phagrus Fish <span id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_275.md); for as this
fish is observed by them to make his first appearance upon their coasts
just as the Nile begins to overflow, they pay special regard to these
voluntary messengers as it were of that most joyful news. The priests,
indeed, entirely abstain from all sorts in general. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[3](#fn_276.md) Therefore, upon the ninth day of the
first month, when all the rest of the Egyptians are obliged by their
religion to eat a fried fish before the door of their houses, they only
burn them, not tasting them at all. For this custom they give two
reasons: the first and most curious, as falling in with the sacred
philosophy of Osiris and Typhon, will be more properly explained in
another place. The second, that which is most obvious and manifest, is
that fish is neither a dainty nor even a necessary kind of food, a fact
which seems to be abundantly confirmed by the writings of Homer, who
never makes either the delicate Pheacians or the Ithacans (though both
peoples were islanders) to feed upon fish, nor even the companions of
Ulysses during their long and most

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

tedious voyage, till they were reduced thereto by extreme necessity. In
short, they consider the sea to have been forced out of the earth by the
power of fire, and therefore to lie out of nature's confines; and they
regard it not as a part of the world, or one of the elements, but as a
preternatural and corrupt and morbid excrement.
