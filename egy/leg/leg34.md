VI\. The priests of the Sun at Heliopolis <span
id="fr_272"></span>[2](#fn_270.md) never carry wine into their temples, for
they regard it as indecent for those who are devoted to the service of
any god to indulge in the drinking of wine whilst they are under the
immediate inspection of their Lord and King. <span
id="fr_273"></span>[3](#fn_271.md) The priests of the other deities are not
so scrupulous in this respect, for they use it, though sparingly. During
their more solemn purifications they abstain from wine wholly, and they
give themselves up entirely to study and meditation, and to the hearing
and teaching of those divine truths which treat of the divine nature.
Even the kings, who are likewise

priests, only partake of wine in the measure which is prescribed for
them in the sacred books, as we are told by Hecataeus. This custom was
only introduced during the reign of Psammetichus, and before that time
they drank no wine at all. If they used it at any time in pouring out
libations to the gods, it was not because they looked upon it as being
acceptable to them for its own sake, but they poured it out over their
altars as the blood of their enemies who had in times past fought
against them. For they believe the vine to have first sprung out of the
earth after it was fattened by the bodies of those who fell in the wars
against the gods. And this, they say, is the reason why drinking its
juice in great quantities makes men mad and beside themselves, filling
them, as it were, with the blood of their own ancestors. These things
are thus related by Eudoxus in the second book of his *Travels*, as he
had them from the priests themselves.
