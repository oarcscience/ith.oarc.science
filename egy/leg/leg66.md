\[FIFTH EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.\]

\[§ XLIV. The philosophers say that the story is nothing but an
enigmatical description of the phenomena of Eclipses. In § XLV. Plutarch
discusses the five explanations which he has described, and begins to
state his own views about them. It must be concluded, he says, that none
of these explanations taken by itself contains the true explanation of
the foregoing history, though all of them together do. Typhon means
every phase of Nature which is hurtful and destructive, not only
drought, darkness, the sea, &c. It is impossible

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

that any one cause, be it bad or even good, should be the common
principle of all things. There must be two opposite and quite different
and distinct Principles. In § XLVI. Plutarch compares this view with the
Magian belief in Ormazd and Ahriman, the former springing from light (§
XLVII.), and the latter from darkness. Ormazd made six good gods, and
Ahriman six of a quite contrary nature. Ormazd increased his own bulk
three times, and adorned the heaven with stars, making the Sun to be the
guard of the other stars. He then created twenty-four other gods, and
placed them in an egg, and Ahriman also created twenty-four gods; the
latter bored a hole in the shell of the egg and effected an entrance
into it, and thus good and evil became mixed together. In § XLVIII.
Plutarch quotes Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Aristotle, and Plato in support
of his hypothesis of the Two Principles, and refers to Plato's Third
Principle. § XLIX. Osiris represents the good qualities of the universal
Soul, and Typhon the bad; Bebo <span id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_343.md) is
a malignant being like Typhon, with whom Manetho identifies him. § L.
The ass, crocodile, and hippopotamus are all associated with Typhon; in
the form of a crocodile Typhon escaped from Horus. <span
id="fr_346"></span>[2](#fn_344.md)

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

The cakes offered on the seventh day of the month Tybi have a
hippopotamus stamped on them. § LI. Osiris symbolizes wisdom and power,
and Typhon all that is malignant and bad.\]

The remaining sections contain a long series of fanciful statements by
Plutarch concerning the religion and manners and customs of the
Egyptians, of which the Egyptian texts now available give no proofs.
