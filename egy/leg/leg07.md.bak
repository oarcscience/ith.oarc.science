### THE LEGEND OF HERU-BEHUTET AND THE WINGED DISK.

THE text of this legend is cut in hieroglyphics on the walls of the
temple of Edfu in Upper Egypt, and certain portions of it are
illustrated by large bas-reliefs. Both text and reliefs were published
by Professor Naville in his volume entitled *Mythe d'Horus*, fol.,
plates 12-19, Geneva, 1870. A German translation by Brugsch appeared in
the *Ahandlungen der Göttinger Akademie*, Band xiv., pp. 173-236, and
another by Wiedemann in his *Die Religion*, p. 38 ff. (see the English
translation p. 69 ff.). The legend, in the form in which it is here
given, dates from the Ptolemaic Period, but the matter which it contains
is far older,

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

and it is probable that the facts recorded in it are fragments of actual
history, which the Egyptians of the late period tried to piece together
in chronological order. We shall see as we read that the writer of the
legend as we have it was not well acquainted with Egyptian history, and
that in his account of the conquest of Egypt he has confounded one god
with another, and mixed up historical facts with mythological legends to
such a degree that his meaning is frequently uncertain. The great fact
which he wished to describe is the conquest of Egypt by an early king,
who, having subdued the peoples in the South, advanced northwards, and
made all the people whom he conquered submit to his yoke. Now the King
of Egypt was always called Horus, and the priests of Edfu wishing to
magnify their local god, Horus of Behutet, or Horus of Edfu, attributed
to him the conquests of this human, and probably predynastic, king. We
must remember that the legend assumes that Ra, was still reigning on
earth, though he was old and feeble, and had probably deputed his power
to his successor, whom the legend regards as his son.

In the 363rd year of his reign Ra-Harmakhis <span
id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) was in Nubia with his army with the
intention of destroying those who had conspired against him; because of
their conspiracy (*auu*) Nubia is called "Uaua" to this day. From Nubia
Ra-Harmakhis sailed down the river to Edfu, where Heru-Behutet entered
his boat, and told

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

him that his foes were conspiring against him. Ra-Harmakhis in answer
addressed Heru-Behutet as his son, and commanded him to set out without
delay and slay the wicked rebels. Then Heru-Behutet took the form of a
great winged Disk, and at once flew up into the sky, where he took the
place of Ra, the old Sun-god. Looking down from the height of heaven he
was able to discover the whereabouts of the rebels, and he pursued them
in the form of a winged disk. Then he attacked them with such violence
that they became dazed, and could neither see where they were going, nor
hear, the result of this being that they slew each other, and in a very
short time they were all dead. Thoth, seeing this, told Ra that because
Horus had appeared as a great winged disk he must be called
"Heru-Behutet," and by this name Horus was known ever after at Edfu. Ra
embraced Horus, and referred with pleasure to the blood which he had
shed, and Horus invited his father to come and look upon the slain. Ra
set out with the goddess Ashthertet (Ashtoreth) to do this, and they saw
the enemies lying fettered on the ground. The legend here introduces a
number of curious derivations of the names of Edfu, &c., which are
valueless, and which remind us of the derivations of place-names
propounded by ancient Semitic scribes.

In gladness of heart Ra proposed a sail on the Nile, but as soon as his
enemies heard that he was coming, they changed themselves into
crocodiles and hippopotami,

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

so that they might be able to wreck his boat and devour him. As the boat
of the god approached them they opened their jaws to crush it, but Horus
and his followers came quickly on the scene, and defeated their purpose.
The followers of Horus here mentioned are called in the text "Mesniu,"
i.e., "blacksmiths," or "workers in metal," and they represent the
primitive conquerors of the Egyptians, who were armed with metal
weapons, and so were able to overcome with tolerable ease the indigenous
Egyptians, whose weapons were made of flint and wood. Horus and his
"blacksmiths" were provided with iron lances and chains, and, baying
cast the chains over the monsters in the river, they drove their lances
into their snouts, and slew 651 of them. Because Horus gained his
victory by means of metal weapons, Ra decreed that a metal statue of
Horus should be placed at Edfu, and remain there for ever, and a name
was given to the town to commemorate the great battle that had taken
place there. Ra applauded Horus for the mighty deeds which be had been
able to perform by means of the spells contained in the "Book of Slaying
the Hippopotamus." Horus then associated with himself the goddesses
Uatchet and Nekhebet, who were in the form of serpents, and, taking his
place as the winged Disk on the front of the Boat of Ra, destroyed all
the enemies of Ra wheresoever he found them. When the remnant of the
enemies of Ra, saw that they were likely to be slain, they doubled back
to the South, but

<span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Horus pursued them, and drove them down the
river before him as far as Thebes. One battle took place at Tchetmet,
and another at Denderah, and Horus was always victorious; the enemies
were caught by chains thrown over them, and the deadly spears of the
Blacksmiths drank their blood.

After this the enemy fled to the North, and took refuge in the swamps of
the Delta, and in the shallows of the Mediterranean Sea, and Horus
pursued them thither. After searching for them for four days and four
nights he found them, and they were speedily slain. One hundred and
forty-two of them. and a male hippopotamus were dragged on to the Boat
of Ra, and there Horus dug out their entrails, and hacked their carcases
in pieces, which he gave to his Blacksmiths and the gods who formed the
crew of the Boat of Ra. Before despatching the hippopotamus, Horus
leaped on to the back of the monster as a mark of his triumph, and to
commemorate this event the priest of Heben, the town wherein these
things happened, was called "He who standeth on the back ever after.

The end of the great fight, however, was not yet. Another army of
enemies appeared by the North Lake, and they were marching towards the
sea; but terror of Horus smote their hearts, and they fled and took
refuge in Mertet-Ament, where they allied themselves with the followers
of Set, the Arch-fiend and great Enemy of Ra. Thither Horus and his
well-armed Blacksmiths pursued them, and came up with them at the town

called Per-Rerehu, which derived its name from the "Two Combatants," or
"Two Men," Horus and Set. A great fight took place, the enemies of Ra
were defeated with great slaughter, and Horus dragged 381 prisoners on
to the Boat of Ra, where he slew them, and gave their bodies to his
followers.

Then Set rose up and cursed Horus because he had slain his allies, and
he used such foul language that Thoth called him "Nehaha-her," i.e.,
"Stinking Face," and this name clung to him ever after. After this Horus
and Set engaged in a fight which lasted a very long time, but at length
Horus drove his spear into the neck of Set with such violence that the
Fiend fell headlong to the ground. Then Horus smote with his club the
mouth which had uttered such blasphemies, and fettered him with his
chain. In this state Horus dragged Set into the presence of Ra, who
ascribed great praise to Horus, and special names were given to the
palace of Horus and the high priest of the temple in commemoration of
the event. When the question of the disposal of Set was being discussed
by the gods, Ra ordered that he and his fiends should be given over to
Isis and her son Horus, who were to do what they pleased with them.
Horus promptly cut off the heads of Set and his fiends in the presence
of Ra and Isis, and be dragged Set by his feet through the country with
his spear sticking in his head and neck. After this Isis appointed Horus
of Behutet to be the protecting deity of her son Horus.

<span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span>

The fight between the Sun-god and Set was a very favourite subject with
Egyptian writers, and there are many forms of it. Thus there is the
fight between Heru-ur and Set, the fight between Ra and Set, the fight
between Heru-Behutet and Set, the fight between Osiris and Set, and the
fight between Horus, son of Isis, and Set. In the oldest times the
combat was merely the natural opposition of light to darkness, but later
the Sun-god became the symbol of right and truth as well as of light,
and Set the symbol of sin and wickedness as well as of darkness, and
ultimately the nature myth was forgotten, and the fight between the two
gods became the type of the everlasting war which good men wage against
sin. In Coptic literature we have the well-known legend of the slaughter
of the dragon by St. George, and this is nothing but a Christian
adaptation of the legend of Horus and Set.

After these things Horus, son of Ra, and Horus, son of Isis, each took
the form of a mighty man, with the face and body of a hawk, and each
wore the Red and White Crowns, and each carried a spear and chain. In
these forms the two gods slew the remnant of the enemies. Now by some
means or other Set came to life again, and he took the form of a mighty
hissing or "roaring" serpent, and hid himself in the ground, in a place
which was ever after called the "place of the roarer." In front of his
hiding-place Horus, son of Isis, stationed himself in the form of a
hawk-headed staff to prevent him from coming out. In spite of this,

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span>

however, Set managed to escape, and he gathered about him the Smai and
Seba fiends at the Lake of Meh, and waged war once more against Horus;
the enemies of Ra were again defeated, and Horus slew them in the
presence of his father.

Horus, it seems, now ceased to fight for some time, and devoted himself
to keeping guard over the "Great God" who was in An-rut-f, a district in
or near Herakleopolis. This Great God was no other than Osiris, and the
duty of Horus was to prevent the Smai fiends from coming by night to the
place. In spite of the power of Horus, it was found necessary to summon
the aid of Isis to keep away the fiends, and it was only by her words of
power that the fiend Ba was kept out of the sanctuary. As a reward for
what he had already done, Thoth decreed that Horus should be called the
"Master-Fighter." Passing over the derivations of place-names which
occur here in the text, we find that Horus and his Blacksmiths were
again obliged to fight bodies of the enemy who had managed to escape,
and that on one occasion they killed one hundred and six foes. In every
fight the Blacksmiths performed mighty deeds of valour, and in reward
for their services a special district was allotted to them to dwell in.

The last great fight in the North took place at Tanis, in the eastern
part of the Delta. When the position of the enemy had been located,
Horus took the form of a lion with the face of a man, and he put on his
head the Triple Crown. His claws were like flints, and with

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

them he dragged away one hundred and forty-two of the enemy, and tore
them in pieces, and dug out their tongues, which he carried off as
symbols of his victory.

Meanwhile rebellion had again broken out in Nubia, where about one-third
of the enemy had taken refuge in the river in the forms of crocodiles
and hippopotami. Ra counselled Horus to sail up the Nile with his
Blacksmiths, and when Thoth had recited the "Chapters of protecting the
Boat of Ra" over the boats, the expedition set sail for the South. The
object of reciting these spells was to prevent the monsters which were
in the river from making the waves to rise and from stirring up storms
which might engulf the boats of Ra and Horus and the Blacksmiths. When
the rebels and fiends who had been uttering, treason against Horus saw
the boat of Ra, with the winged Disk of Horus accompanied by the
goddesses Uatchet and Nekhebet in the form of serpents, they were
smitten with fear, and their hearts quaked, and all power of resistance
left them, and they died of fright straightway. When Horus returned in
triumph to Edfu, Ra ordered that an image of the winged Disk should be
placed in each of his sanctuaries, and that in every place wherein a
winged Disk was set, that sanctuary should be a sanctuary of Horus of
Behutet. The winged disks which are seen above the doorways of the
temples still standing in Egypt show that the command of Ra, was
faithfully carried out by the priests.
