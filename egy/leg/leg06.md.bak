### THE LEGEND OF RA AND ISIS.

THE original text of this very interesting legend is written in the
hieratic character on a papyrus preserved at Turin, and was published by
Pleyte and Rossi in their *Corpus* of Turin Papyri. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) French and German translations of it were
published by Lefébure, <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md) and
Wiedemann <span id="fr_17"></span>[3](#fn_17.md) respectively, and
summaries of its contents were given by Erman <span
id="fr_18"></span>[4](#fn_18.md) and Maspero. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[5](#fn_19.md) A transcript of the hieratic text into
hieroglyphics, with transliteration and translation, was published by me
in 1895. <span id="fr_20"></span>[6](#fn_20.md)

It has already been seen that the god Ra, when retiring from the
government of this world, took steps through Thoth to supply mankind
with words of power and spells with which to protect themselves against
the bites of serpents and other noxious reptiles. The legend of the
Destruction of Mankind affords no explanation of this remarkable fact,
but when we read the following legend of Ra and Isis we understand why
Ra, though king of the gods, was afraid of the reptiles which lived in
the kingdom of Keb. The legend, or "Chapter of the Divine God," begins
by enumerating the mighty attributes of Ra as the creator of the

<span id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span>

universe, and describes the god of "many names" as unknowable, even by
the gods. At this time Isis lived in the form of a woman who possessed
the knowledge of spells and incantations, that is to say, she was
regarded much in the same way as modern African peoples regard their
"medicine-women," or "witch-women." She had used her spells on men, and
was tired of exercising her powers on them, and she craved the
opportunity of making herself mistress of gods and spirits as well as of
men. She meditated how she could make herself mistress both of heaven
and earth, and finally she decided that she could only obtain the power
she wanted if she possessed the knowledge of the secret name of Ra, in
which his very existence was bound up. Ra guarded this name most
jealously, for he knew that if he revealed it to any being he would
henceforth be at that being's mercy. Isis saw that it was impossible to
make Ra declare his name to her by ordinary methods, and she therefore
thought out the following plan. It was well known in Egypt and the Sudan
at a very early period that if a magician obtained some portion of a
person's body, e.g., a hair, a paring of a nail, a fragment of skin, or
a portion of some efflux from the body, spells could be used upon them
which would have the effect of causing grievous harm to that person.
Isis noted that Ra had become old and feeble, and that as he went about
he dribbled at the mouth, and that his saliva fell upon the ground.
Watching her opportunity she caught some of the saliva of the

<span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span>

and mixing it with dust, she moulded it into the form of a large
serpent, with poison-fangs, and having uttered her spells over it, she
left the serpent lying on the path, by which Ra travelled day by day as
he went about inspecting Egypt, so that it might strike at him as he
passed along. We may note in passing that the Banyoro in the Sudan
employ serpents in killing buffaloes at the present day. They catch a
puff-adder in a noose, and then nail it alive by the tip of its tail to
the round in the middle of a buffalo track, so that when an animal
passes the reptile may strike at it. Presently a buffalo comes along,
does what it is expected to do, and then the puff-adder strikes at it,
injects its poison, and the animal dies soon after. As many as ten
buffaloes have been killed in a day by one puff-adder. The body of the
first buffalo is not eaten, for it is regarded as poisoned meat, but all
the others are used as food. <span id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)

Soon after Isis had placed the serpent on the Path, Ra passed by, and
the reptile bit him, thus injecting poison into his body. Its effect was
terrible, and Ra cried out in agony. His jaws chattered, his lips
trembled, and he became speechless for a time; never before had be
suffered such pain. The gods hearing his cry rushed to him, and when he
could speak he told them that he had been bitten by a deadly serpent. In
spite of all the words of power which were known to

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

him, and his secret name which had been hidden in his body at his birth,
a serpent had bitten him, and he was being consumed with a fiery pain.
He then commanded that all the gods who had any knowledge of magical
spells should come to him, and when they came, Isis, the great lady of
spells, the destroyer of diseases, and the revivifier of the dead, came
with them. Turning to Ra she said, "What hath happened, O divine
Father?" and in answer the god told her that a serpent had bitten him,
that he was hotter than fire and colder than water, that his limbs
quaked, and that he was losing the power of sight. Then Isis said to him
with guile, "Divine Father, tell me thy name, for he who uttereth his
own name shall live." Thereupon Ra proceeded to enumerate the various
things that he had done, and to describe his creative acts, and ended
his speech to Isis by saying, that he was Khepera in the morning, Ra at
noon, and Temu in the evening. Apparently he thought that the naming of
these three great names would satisfy Isis, and that she would
immediately pronounce a word of power and stop the pain in his body,
which, during his speech, had become more acute. Isis, however, was not
deceived, and she knew well that Ra had not declared to her his hidden
name; this she told him, and she begged him once again to tell her his
name. For a time the god refused to utter the name, but as the pain in
his body became more violent, and the poison passed through his veins
like fire, he said, "Isis shall search in me, and my

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

name shall pass from my body into hers." At that moment Ra removed
himself from the sight of the gods in his Boat, and the Throne in the
Boat of Millions of Years had no occupant. The great name of Ra was, it
seems, hidden in his heart, and. Isis, having some doubt as to whether
Ra would keep his word or not, agreed with Horus that Ra must be made to
take an oath to part with his two Eyes, that is, the Sun and the Moon.
At length Ra allowed his heart to be taken from his body, and his great
and secret name, whereby he lived, passed into the possession of Isis.
Ra thus became to all intents and purposes a dead god. Then Isis, strong
in the power of her spells, said: "Flow, poison, come out of Ra. Eye of
Horus, come out of Ra, and shine outside his mouth. It is I, Isis, who
work, and I have made the poison to fall on the ground. Verily the name
of the great god is taken from him, Ra shall live and the poison shall
die; if the poison live Ra shall die."

This was the infallible spell which was to be used in cases of
poisoning, for it rendered the bite or sting of every venomous reptile
harmless. It drove the poison out of Ra, and since it was composed by
Isis after she obtained the knowledge of his secret name it was
irresistible. If the words were written on papyrus or linen over a
figure of Temu or Heru-hekenu, or Isis, or Horus, they became a mighty
charm. If the papyrus or linen were steeped in water and the water
drunk, the words were equally efficacious as a charm against
snake-bites. To

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

this day water in which the written words of a text from the Kur'an have
been dissolved, or water drunk from a bowl on the inside of which
religious texts have been written, is still regarded as a never-failing
charm in Egypt and the Sudan. Thus we see that the modern custom of
drinking magical water was derived from the ancient Egyptians, who
believed that it conveyed into their bodies the actual power of their
gods.
