\[§ XXXVI., The Nile and all kinds of moisture are called the "efflux of
Osiris." Therefore a water-pitcher <span id="fr_337"></span>[4](#fn_335.md)
is always carried first in his processions, and the leaf of a fir-tree
represents both Osiris and Egypt. <span id="fr_338"></span>[5](#fn_336.md)
Osiris is

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

the great principle of fecundity, which is proved by the Pamylia
festivals, in which a statue of the god with a triple phallus is carried
about. <span id="fr_339"></span>[1](leg62.htm#fn_337.md) The three-fold
phallus merely signifies any great and indefinite number.\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_332"></span>[242:1](leg59.htm#fr_334.md) Plutarch seems to
have erred here. The early texts call the pupil of the eye "the child in
the eye," as did the Semitic peoples (see my Liturgy of Funerary
Offerings, p. 136). The Copts spoke of the "black of the eye," derived
from the hieroglyphic "darkness," "blackness."

<span id="fn_333"></span>[242:2](leg59.htm#fr_335.md) There is no support
for this view in the texts.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[242:3](leg59.htm#fr_336.md) It was a very common
belief in Egypt that all things arose from the great celestial ocean
called Nu, whence came the Nile.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[242:4](leg60.htm#fr_337.md) Plutarch refers to
the vessel of water, with which the priest sprinkles the ground to
purify it.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[242:5](leg60.htm#fr_338.md) He seems to refer
here to the *olive*-tree: Beqet, "olive land," was one of the names of
Egypt.
