\[In § XXVI. Plutarch points out that Homer calls great and good men
"god-like" and "God's compeers," but the word Daemon is applied to the
good and bad indifferently (see *Odyssey*, vi. 12; *Iliad*, xiii. 810,
v. 438, iv. 31, &c.). Plato assigns to the Olympian Gods good things and
the odd numbers, and the opposite to the Daemons. Xenocrates believed in
the existence of a series of strong and powerful beings which take
pleasure in scourgings and fastings, &c. Hesiod speaks of "holy daemons"
(*Works and Days*, 126) and "guardians of mankind," and "bestowers of
wealth," and these are regarded by Plato as a "middle order of beings
between the gods and men, interpreters of the wills of the gods to men,
and ministering to their wants, carrying the prayers and supplications
of mortals to heaven, and bringing down thence in return oracles and all

other blessings of life." Empedocles thought that the Daemons underwent
punishment, and that when chastened and purified they were restored to
their original state.\]
