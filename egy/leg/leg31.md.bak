III\. The goddess Isis is said by some authors to be

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

the daughter <span id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) of Hermes, <span
id="fr_264"></span>[2](#fn_262.md) and by others of Prometheus, both of
them famous for their philosophic turn of mind. The latter is supposed
to have first taught mankind wisdom and foresight, as the former is
reputed to have invented letters and music.

They likewise call the former of the two Muses at Hermopolis <span
id="fr_265"></span>[3](#fn_263.md) Isis as well as Dikaiosune, <span
id="fr_266"></span>[4](#fn_264.md) she being none other, it is said, than
Wisdom pointing out the knowledge of divine truths to her votaries, the
true Hierophori and Hierostoli. Now, by the former of these are meant
such who carry about them looked up in their souls, as in a chest, the
sacred doctrine concerning the gods, purified from all such
superfluities as superstition may have added thereto. And the holy
apparel with which the Hierostoli adorn the statues of these deities,
which is partly of a dark and gloomy and partly of a more bright and
shining colour, seems aptly

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

enough to represent the notions which this doctrine teaches us to
entertain of the divine nature itself, partly clear and partly obscure.
And inasmuch as the devotees of Isis after their decease are wrapped up
in these sacred vestments, is not this intended to signify that this
holy doctrine still abides with them, and that this alone accompanies
them in another life? For as 'tis not the length of the beard or the
coarseness of the habit which makes a philosopher, so neither will these
frequent shavings, or the mere wearing of a linen vestment, constitute a
votary of Isis. He alone is a true servant or follower of this goddess
who, after he has heard, and has been made acquainted in a proper manner
with the history of the actions of these gods, searches into the hidden
truths which lie concealed under them, and examines the whole by the
dictates of reason and philosophy.
