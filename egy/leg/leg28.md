### II.--THE NARRATIVE OF ISIS.

48\. I am Isis, \[and\] I have come forth from the dwelling (or, prison)
wherein my brother Set placed me. **49**. Behold the god Thoth, the
great god, the Chief of Maat <span id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_202.md)
\[both\] in heaven and on the earth, said unto me, "Come now, O Isis,
thou goddess, moreover it is a good thing to hearken, <span
id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_203.md) \[for there is\] life to one who shall
be guided \[by the advice\] of another. Hide thou thyself with \[thy\]
son the child, **50** and there shall come unto him these things. His
members shall grow, <span id="fr_206"></span>[3](#fn_204.md) and two-fold
strength of every kind shall spring up \[in him\]. \[And he\] shall be
made to take his seat upon the throne of his father, \[whom\] he shall
avenge, <span id="fr_207"></span>[4](#fn_205.md) \[and he shall take
possession of\] the exalted position of Heq <span
id="fr_208"></span>[5](#fn_206.md) of the Two Lands." <span
id="fr_209"></span>[6](#fn_207.md)

I came forth \[from the dwelling\] at the time of evening, and there
came forth the Seven Scorpions **51** which were to accompany me and to
strike(?) for me with \[their\] stings. Two scorpions, Tefen and Befen,
were behind me, two scorpions, Mestet and Mestetef, were by my side, and
three scorpions, Petet, Thetet, and Maatet (or, Martet), were for
preparing the road for me. I charged them very strictly (or, in a loud
voice), **52** and my words penetrated into their ears: "Have no
knowledge of \[any\], make no cry to the Tesheru beings, and pay no
attention to the 'son of a man' (i.e., anyone) who belongeth to a man of
no account," \[and I said,\] "Let your faces be turned

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span> <span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

towards the ground \[that ye may show me\] the way." So the guardian of
the company brought me to the boundaries of the city of **53**
Pa-Sui, <span id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) the city of the goddesses
of the Divine Sandals, \[which was situated\] in front of the Papyrus
Swamps. <span id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_209.md)

When I had arrived at the place where the people lived <span
id="fr_212"></span>[3](#fn_210.md) I came to the houses wherein dwelt the
wives \[and\] husbands. And a certain woman of quality spied me as I was
journeying along the road, and she shut **54** her doors on me. Now she
was sick at heart by reason of those \[scorpions\] which were with me.
Then \[the Seven Scorpions\] took counsel concerning her, and they all
at one time shot out their venom on the tail of the scorpion Tefen; as
for me, the woman Taha <span id="fr_213"></span>[4](#fn_211.md) opened her
door, and I entered into the house of the miserable lady.

55\. Then the scorpion Tefen entered in under the leaves of the door and
smote (i.e., stung) the son of Usert, and a fire broke out in the house
of Usert, and there was no water there to extinguish it; \[but\] the sky
rained upon the house of Usert, though it was not the season for
rain. <span id="fr_214"></span>[5](#fn_212.md)

56\. Behold, the heart of her who had not opened her door to me was
grievously sad, for she knew not whether he (i.e., her son) would live
\[or not\], and although she went round about through her town uttering
cries \[for help\], there was none who came at \[the sound of\] her
voice. Now mine own heart was grievously sad for the sake of the child,
and \[I wished\]

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span> <span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

to make to live \[again\] him that was free from fault. **57**.
\[Thereupon\] I cried out to the noble lady, "Come to me. Come to me.
Verily my mouth (?) possesseth life. I am a daughter \[well\] known in
her town, \[and I\] can destroy the demon of death by the spell (or,
utterance) which my father taught me to know. "I am his daughter, **58**
the beloved \[offspring\] of his body."

Then Isis placed her two hands on the child in order to make to live him
whose throat was stopped, \[and she said\],

"O poison of the scorpion Tefent, come forth and appear on the ground!
Thou shalt neither enter nor penetrate \[further into the body of the
child\]. O poison of the scorpion Befent, come forth and appear on the
ground! **59**. I am Isis, the goddess, the lady (or, mistress) of words
of power, and I am the maker of words of power (i.e., spells), and I
know how to utter words with magical effect. <span
id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_213.md) Hearken ye unto me, O every reptile
which possesseth the power to bite (i.e., to sting), and fall headlong
to the ground! O poison of the scorpion Mestet, make no advance \[into
his body\]. O poison of the scorpion Mestetef, rise not up \[in his
body\]. O poison of the scorpions Petet and Thetet, penetrate not \[into
his body\]. \[O **60** poison of\] the scorpion Maatet (or, Martet),
fall down on the ground."

\[Here follows the\] "Chapter of the stinging \[of scorpions\]."

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span> <span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

And Isis, the goddess, the great mistress of spells (or, words of
power), she who is at the head of the gods, unto whom the god Keb gave
his own **61** magical spells for the driving away of poison at noon-day
(?), and for making poison to go back, and retreat, and withdraw, and go
backward, spake, saying, "Ascend not into heaven, through the command
**62** of the beloved one of Ra, the egg of the Smen goose which cometh
forth from the sycamore. Verily my words are made to command the
uttermost limit **63** of the night. I speak unto you, \[O scorpions\] I
am alone and in sorrow because our names will suffer disgrace throughout
the nomes. **64**. Do not make love, do not cry out to the Tesheru
fiends, and cast no glances upon the noble ladies in their houses. Turn
your faces towards the earth and \[find out\] the road, **65** so that
we may arrive at the hidden places in the town of Khebt. <span
id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_214.md) Oh the child shall live and the poison
die! Ra liveth and the poison dieth! Verily Horus shall be in good case
(or, healthy) **66** for his mother Isis. Verily he who is stricken
shall be in good case likewise."

And the fire \[which was in the house of Usert\] was extinguished, and
heaven was satisfied **67** with the utterance of Isis, the goddess.

Then the lady Usert came, and she brought unto me her possessions, and
she filled the house of the woman Tah (?), for the KA of Tah (?), **68**
because \[she\] had opened to me her door. Now the lady Usert suffered

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span> <span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

pain and anguish the whole night, and her mouth tasted (i.e., felt) the
sting **69** \[which\] her son \[had suffered\]. And she brought her
possessions as the penalty for not having opened the door to me. Oh the
child shall live and the poison die! Verily Horus shall be in good case
**70** for his mother Isis. Verily everyone who is stricken shall be in
good case likewise.

Lo, a bread-cake \[made\] of barley meal shall drive out (or, destroy)
the poison, **71** and natron shall make it to withdraw, and the fire
\[made\] of *hetchet*-plant shall drive out (or, destroy) fever-heat
from the limbs.

"O Isis, O Isis, come thou to thy **72** Horus, O thou woman of the wise
mouth! Come to thy son"--thus cried the gods who dwelt in her quarter of
the town--"for he is as one **73** whom a scorpion hath stung, and like
one whom the scorpion Uhat, which the animal Antesh drove away, hath
wounded."

74\. \[Then\] Isis ran out like one who had a knife \[stuck\] in her
body, and she opened her arms wide, \[saying\] "Behold me, behold me, my
son **75** Horus, have no fear, have no fear, O son my glory! No evil
thing of any kind whatsoever shall happen unto thee, \[for\] there is in
thee the essence (or, fluid) which made the things which exist. **76**.
Thou art the son from the country of Mesqet, <span
id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_215.md) \[thou hast\] come forth from the
celestial waters Nu, and thou shalt not die by the heat of the poison.
**77**. Thou wast the Great Bennu, <span id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_216.md)
who art born (or, produced) or; the top of the

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span> <span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

balsam-trees <span id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_217.md) which are in the
House of the Aged One in Anu (Heliopolis). Thou **78** art the brother
of the Abtu Fish, <span id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_218.md) who orderest
what is to be, and art the nursling of the Cat <span
id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_219.md) who dwelleth in **79** the House of
Neith. The goddess Reret, <span id="fr_222"></span>[4](#fn_220.md) the
goddess <u>H</u>at, and the god Bes protect thy members. Thy head shall
not fall to the Tchat fiend **80** that attacketh thee. Thy members
shall not receive the fire of that which is thy poison. Thou shalt not
go backwards on the land, and thou shalt not be brought low **81** on
the water. No reptile which biteth (or, stingeth) shall gain the mastery
over thee, and no lion shall subdue thee or have dominion over thee.
Thou art the son of the sublime god **82** who proceeded from Keb. Thou
art Horus, and the poison shall not gain the mastery over thy members.
Thou art the son of the sublime god who proceeded from Keb, and thus
likewise shall it be with those who are under the knife. And the four
**83** august goddesses shall protect thy members."

\[Here the narrative is interrupted by the following texts:\]

\[I am\] he who rolleth up into the sky, and who goeth down (i.e.,
setteth) in the Tuat, whose form is in the House of height, through whom
when he openeth his Eye the light cometh into being, and when he closeth

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span> <span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

his Eye it becometh night. \[I am\] the Water-god Het when he giveth
**84** commands, whose name is unknown to the gods. I illumine the Two
Lands, night betaketh itself to flight, and I shine by day and by
night. <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_221.md) I am the Bull of
Bakha <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_222.md), and the Lion of Manu <span
id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_223.md). I am he who traverseth the heavens by
day and by night without being repulsed. I have come **85** by reason of
the voice (or, cry) of the son of Isis. Verily the blind serpent Na hath
bitten the Bull. O thou poison which floweth through every member of him
that is under the knife, come forth, I charge thee, upon the ground.
Behold, he that is under the knife shall not be bitten. **86**. Thou art
Menu, the Lord of Coptos, the child of the White Shat <span
id="fr_226"></span>[4](#fn_224) which is in Anu (Heliopolis.md), which was
bitten \[by a reptile\]. O Menu, Lord of Coptos, give thou air unto him
that is under the knife; and air shall be given to thee. **87**. Hail,
divine father and minister of the god Nebun, \[called\] Mer-Tem, son of
the divine father and minister of the god Nebun, scribe of the Water-god
Het, \[called\] Ankh-Semptek (*sic*), son of the lady of the house
Tent-Het-nub! He restored this inscription after he had found it in a
ruined state in the Temple of Osiris-Mnevis, because he wished to make
to live **88** her name . . . . . . . . . . and to give air unto him
that is under \[the knife\], and to give life unto the ancestors of all
the gods. And his Lord Osiris-Mnevis shall make long his life with
happiness

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span> <span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

of heart, \[and shall give him\] a beautiful burial after \[attaining
to\] an old age, because of what he hath done for the Temple of
Osiris-Mnevis.

89\. Horus was bitten (i.e., stung) in Sekhet-An, to the north of **90**
Hetep-hemt, whilst his mother Isis was in the celestial houses making a
libation **91** for her brother Osiris. And Horus sent forth his cry
into **92** the horizon, and it was heard by those who were in . . . . .
. Thereupon the keepers of the doors **93** who were in the \[temple
of\] the holy Acacia Tree started up at the voice of Horus. **94**. And
one sent forth a cry of lamentation, and Heaven gave the order that
Horus was to be healed. **95**. And \[the gods\] took counsel
\[together\] concerning the life \[of Horus, saying,\] **96** "O goddess
Pai(?), O god Asten, **97** who dwellest in Aat-Khus(?) . . . . .
. <span id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_225.md) thy . . . . . . enter in **98**
. . . . . lord of sleep . . . . . . the child Horus. Oh, Oh, **99**
bring thou the things which are thine to cut off the poison which is in
every member **100** of Horus, the son of Isis, and which is in every
member of him that is under the knife likewise."

101\. A HYMN OF PRAISE TO HORUS TO GLORIFY HIM, WHICH IS TO BE SAID
**102** OVER THE WATERS AND OVER THE LAND. Thoth speaketh and this god
reciteth \[the following\]:--

"**103**. Homage to thee, god, son of a god. Homage to thee, heir, son
of an heir. **104**. Homage to thee, bull, son of a bull, who wast
brought **105** forth by a

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span> <span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

holy goddess. Homage to thee, Horus, who comest forth from **106**
Osiris, and wast brought forth by the goddess Isis. I recite thy **107**
words of power, I speak with thy magical utterance. **108**. I pronounce
a spell in thine own words, which **109** thy heart hath created, and
all the spells and incantations which have come forth from thy mouth,
**110** which thy father Keb commanded thee \[to recite\], and thy
mother **111** Nut gave to thee, and the majesty of the Governor of
Sekhem taught thee to make use of for thy protection, **112** in order
to double (or, repeat) thy protective formulae, to shut the mouth of
**113** every reptile which is in heaven, and on the earth, and in
**114** the waters, to make men and women to live, to make the gods to
be at peace \[with thee\], and to make Ra to employ his magical spells
**115** through thy chants of praise. Come to me this day, quickly,
quickly, **116** as thou workest the paddle of the Boat of the god.
Drive thou away from me every lion **117** on the plain, and every
crocodile in the waters, and all mouths which bite (or, sting) in their
holes. **118**. Make thou them before me like the stone of the mountain,
like a broken pot **119** lying about in a quarter of the town. Dig thou
out from me the poison which riseth and **120** is in every member of
him that is under the knife. Keep thou watch over him . . . . . .
**121** by means of thy words. Verily let thy name be invoked this day.
Let thy power (*qefau*) come into being **122** in him. Exalt thou thy
magical powers. Make me to

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span> <span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

live **123** and him whose throat is closed up. Then shall mankind give
thee praise, **124** and the righteous (?) shall give thanks unto thy
forms. And all the gods likewise shall invoke thee, **125** and in truth
thy name shall be invoked this day. I am Horus \[of\] Shet\[enu\] (?).

"**126**. O thou who art in the cavern, <span
id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_226.md) O thou who art in the cavern. O thou who
art at the mouth of the cavern. **127**. O thou who art on the way, O
thou who art on the way. O thou who art at the mouth of the way.
**128**. He is Urmer (Mnevis) who approacheth every man **129** and
every beast. He is like the god Sep who is in Anu (Heliopolis). **130**.
He is the Scorpion-\[god\] who is in the Great House (Het-ur). Bite him
not, for he is **131** Ra. Sting him not, for he is Thoth. Shoot ye not
**132** your poison over him, for he is Nefer-Tem. O every male serpent,
**133** O every female serpent, O every *antesh* (scorpion?) which bite
with your mouths, **134** and sting with your tails, bite **135** ye him
not with your mouths, and sting ye him not with your tails. **136**. Get
ye afar off from him, make ye not your fire to be against him, for he is
the son of Osiris. **137**. Vomit ye. \[Say\] four times:--

"**138**. I am Thoth, I have come from heaven to make protection of
Horus, **139** and to drive away the poison of the scorpion which is in
every member of Horus. **140**. Thy head is to thee, Horus; it shall be
stable

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span> <span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

under **141** the Urert Crown. Thine eye is to thee, Horus, \[for\] thou
art **142** Horus, the son of Keb, the Lord of the Two Eyes, in the
midst of the Company \[of the gods\]. Thy nose is to thee, **143**
Horus, \[for\] thou art Horus the Elder, the son of Ra, and thou shalt
not inhale **144** the fiery wind. Thine arm is to thee, Horus, **145**
great is thy strength to slaughter the enemies of thy father. Thy two
thighs <span id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_227.md) **146** are to thee, Horus.
Receive thou the rank and dignity of thy father **147** Osiris. Ptah
hath balanced for thee thy mouth on the day of **148** thy birth. Thy
heart (or, breast) is to thee, Horus, and the Disk **149** maketh thy
protection. Thine eye is to thee, Horus; thy right eye **150** is like
Shu, and thy left eye like Tefnut, who are the children **151** of Ra.
Thy belly is to thee, Horus, and the Children are the gods who are
therein, **152** and they shall not receive the essence (or, fluid) of
the scorpion. Thy strength is to thee, Horus, **153** and the strength
of Set shall not exist against thee. Thy phallus is to thee, **154**
Horus, and thou art Kamutef, the protector **155** of his father, who
maketh an answer for his children **156** in the course of every day.
Thy thighs are to thee, Horus, and thy **157** strength shall slaughter
the enemies of thy father. **158**. Thy calves are to thee, Horus; the
god Khnemu hath builded \[them\], **159** and the goddess Isis hath
covered them with flesh. The soles of thy feet are to thee, Horus,
**160** and the nations who fight with the bow (Peti) fall under thy
feet. Thou rulest

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span> <span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

\[paragraph continues\] **161** the South, North, West, and East, and
thou seest **162** like Ra. \[Say\] four times. And likewise him that is
under the knife."

163\. Beautiful god, Senetchem-ab-Ra-setep-\[en\]-Amen, son of Ra,
Nekht-Heru-Hebit, **164** thou art protected, and the gods and goddesses
are protected, and conversely. **165**. Beautiful god,
Senetchem-ab-Ra-setep-\[en\]-Ra, son of Ra, Nekht-Heru-Hebit, **166**
thou art protected, and Heru-Shet\[enu\], the great god, is protected,
and conversely.

167\. ANOTHER CHAPTER LIKE UNTO IT. "Fear not, fear not, O Bast, the
strong of heart, at the head of the holy field, the mighty one among all
the gods, nothing shall gain the mastery over thee. Come thou outside,
following my speech (or, mouth), O evil **168** poison which is in all
the members of the lion (or, cat) which is under the knife."

\[The narrative of the stinging of Horus by a scorpion is continued
thus\]:

"I am Isis, who conceived a child by her husband, and she became heavy
with Horus, the divine \[child\]. I gave birth to Horus, the son of
Osiris, in a nest of papyrus plants. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_228.md) I rejoiced exceedingly over this,
because **169** I saw \[in him one\] who would make answer for his
father. I hid him, and I concealed him through fear of that \[fiend
(?)\]. <span id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_229.md) I went away to the city of
Am, \[where\] the people gave thanks \[for me\] through \[their\] fear
of my making trouble \[for them\]. I passed the day in seeking to
provide food

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span> <span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

for the child, \[and\] on returning to take Horus into my arms I found
him, Horus, the beautiful one **170** of gold, the boy, the child,
without \[life\]. He had bedewed the ground with the water of his eye,
and with foam from his lips. His body was motionless, his heart was
powerless to move, and the sinews (or, muscles) of his members were
\[helpless\]. I sent forth a cry, \[saying\]:

"'I, even I, **171** lack a son to make answer \[for me\]. <span
id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_230.md) \[My\] two breasts are full to
overflowing, \[but\] my body is empty. \[My\] mouth wished for that
which concerned him. <span id="fr_233"></span>[2](#fn_231.md) A cistern of
water and a stream of the inundation was I. The child was the desire of
my heart, and I longed to protect him (?). I carried him in my womb, I
gave birth to him, **172** I endured the agony of the birth pangs, I was
all alone, and the great ones were afraid of disaster and to come out at
the sound of my **173** voice. My father is in the Tuat, <span
id="fr_234"></span>[3](#fn_232.md) my mother is in Aqert, <span
id="fr_235"></span>[4](#fn_233.md) and my elder brother **174** is in the
sarcophagus. Think of the enemy and of how prolonged was the wrath of
his heart **175** against me, \[when\] I, the great lady, was in his
house.'

"I cried then, \[saying,\] 'Who **176** among the people will indeed let
their hearts come round to me?' I cried then **177** to those who dwelt
in the papyrus swamps (or, Ateh), and they inclined to me straightway.
**178**. And the people came forth to me from their houses, and they
thronged about me **179** at \[the sound of\] my voice, and they loudly
bewailed

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span> <span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

with me the greatness of my affliction. **180**. There was no man there
who set restraint (?) on his mouth, every person among them lamented
**181** with great lamentation. There was none there who knew how to
make \[my child\] to live.

"And there came forth unto me a woman who was \[well\] known **182** in
her city, a lady who was mistress of her \[own\] estate. <span
id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_234.md) She came forth to me. Her mouth
possessed **183** life, and her heart was filled with the matter which
was therein, \[and she said,\] 'Fear not, fear not, O son Horus!
**184**. Be not cast down, be not cast down, O mother of the god. The
child of the Olive-tree is by the mountain of his brother, 185 the bush
is hidden, and no enemy shall enter therein. The word of power of Tem,
the Father of the gods, **186** who is in heaven, maketh to live. Set
shall not enter into this region, he shall not go round about it.
**187**. The marsh of Horus of the Olive-tree is by the mountain of his
brother; those who are in his following shall not at any time . . . . .
. it. **188**. This shall happen to him: Horus shall live for his
mother, and shall salute (2) \[her\] **189** with his mouth. A scorpion
hath smitten (i.e., stung) him, and the reptile Aun-ab hath wounded
him.'" **190**.

Then Isis placed her nose in his mouth <span
id="fr_237"></span>[2](#fn_235.md) so that she might know whether he who
was in **191** his coffin breathed, and she examined the wound <span
id="fr_238"></span>[3](#fn_236.md) of the heir of the god, and she found
that there was poison **192** in it. She threw her arms round him, and
then quickly she

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span> <span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

leaped about with him like fish when they are laid **193** upon the hot
coals, \[saying\]:

"Horus is bitten, O Ra. Thy son is bitten, \[O Osiris\]. **194**. Horus
is bitten, the flesh and blood of the Heir, the Lord of the diadems (?)
of the kingdoms of Shu. **195**. Horus is bitten, the Boy of the marsh
city of Ateh, the Child in the House of the Prince. **196**. The
beautiful Child of gold is bitten, the Babe hath suffered pain and is
not. <span id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_237.md) Horus is bitten, he the son
of Un-Nefer, **197** who was born of Auh-mu (?). Horus is bitten, he in
whom there was nothing abominable, **198** the son, the youth among the
gods. Horus is bitten, he for whose wants I prepared in abundance,
**199** for I saw that he would make answer <span
id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_238.md) for his father. Horus is bitten, he for
whom \[I\] had care **200** \[when he was\] in the hidden woman \[and
for whom I was afraid when he was\] in the womb of his mother. Horus is
bitten, he whom I guarded **201** to look upon. I have wished for the
life of his heart. Calamity hath befallen the child **202** on the
water, and the child hath perished."

Then came Nephthys **203** shedding tears and uttering cries of
lamentation, and going round about through the papyrus swamps. And Serq
\[came also and they said\]: **204** "Behold, behold, what hath happened
to Horus, son of Isis, and who \[hath done it\]? Pray then to heaven,
**205** and let the mariners of Ra cease their labours for a space, for
the Boat of Ra cannot travel onwards \[whilst\] son Horus **206**
\[lieth dead\] on his place."

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span> <span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

And Isis sent forth her voice into heaven, and made supplication to the
Boat of Millions of Years, and the **207** Disk stopped <span
id="fr_241"></span>[1](#fn_239.md) in its journeying, and moved not from
the place whereon it rested. Then came forth Thoth, who is equipped
**208** with his spells (or, words of power), and possesseth the great
word of command of *maa-kheru*, <span id="fr_242"></span>[2](#fn_240.md)
\[and said:\] "What \[aileth thee\], what \[aileth thee\], O Isis, thou
goddess who hast magical spells, **209** whose mouth hath understanding?
Assuredly no evil thing hath befallen \[thy\] son Horus, \[for\] the
Boat of Ra hath him under its protection. **210**. I have come this day
in the Divine Boat of the Disk from the place where it was yesterday,
**211**--now darkness came and the light was destroyed--in order to heal
Horus for his mother **212** Isis and every person who is under the
knife likewise."

And Isis, the goddess, said: "O Thoth, great things **213** \[are in\]
thy heart, \[but\] delay belongeth to thy plan. Hast thou come **214**
equipped with thy spells and incantations, and having the great formula
of *maa-kheru*, and one \[spell\] after the other, the numbers whereof
are not known? **215**. Verily Horus is in the cradle(?) of the poison.
Evil, evil is his case, death, \[and\] misery **216** to the fullest
\[extent\]. The cry of his mouth is towards his mother(?). I cannot
\[bear\] to see these things in his train. My heart \[hath not\] rested
because of them **217** since the beginning(?) \[when\] I made haste to
make answer \[for\] Horus-Ra (?), placing \[myself\] on the earth,
\[and\]

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span> <span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

since the day \[when\] **218** I was taken possession of by him. I
desired Neheb-ka . . . . . . . **219**"

\[And Thoth said:\] "Fear not, fear not, O goddess Isis, fear not, fear
not, O Nephthys, and let not anxiety \[be to you\]. **220**. I have come
from heaven having life to heal(?) the child for his mother, Horus is .
. . Let thy heart be firm; <span id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_241.md) he
shall not sink under the flame. **221**. Horus is protected as the
Dweller in his Disk, <span id="fr_244"></span>[2](#fn_242.md) who lighteth
up the Two Lands by the splendour of his two Eyes; <span
id="fr_245"></span>[3](#fn_243.md) and he who is under the knife is
likewise protected. **222**. Horus is protected as the First-born son in
heaven, <span id="fr_246"></span>[4](#fn_244.md) who is ordained to be the
guide of the things which exist and of the things which are not yet
created; and he who under the knife is protected likewise. **224**.
Horus is protected as that great Dwarf (*nemu*) <span
id="fr_247"></span>[5](#fn_245.md) who goeth round about the Two Lands in
the darkness; and he who is under the knife is protected likewise.
**224**. Horus is protected as the Lord (?) in the night, who revolveth
at the head of the Land of the Sunset (Manu); and he who is under the
knife is protected likewise. **225**. Horus is protected as the Mighty
Ram <span id="fr_248"></span>[6](#fn_246.md) who is hidden, and who goeth
round about in front of his Eyes; and he who is under the knife is
protected likewise. Horus is protected as the Great Hawk <span
id="fr_249"></span>[7](#fn_247.md) **226** which flieth through heaven,
earth, and the Other World (Tuat); and he who is under the knife is
protected likewise. Horus is protected as the Holy Beetle, the mighty
(?) wings of which **227** are at the

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span> <span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

head of the sky; <span id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_248.md) and he who is
under the knife is protected likewise. Horus is protected as the Hidden
Body, <span id="fr_251"></span>[2](#fn_249.md) and as he whose mummy is in
his sarcophagus; and he who is under the knife is protected likewise.
**228**. Horus is protected \[as the Dweller\] in the Other World \[and
in the\] Two Lands, who goeth round about 'Those who are over Hidden
Things'; and he who is under the knife is protected likewise. **229**.
Horus is protected as the Divine Bennu <span
id="fr_252"></span>[3](#fn_250.md) who alighteth in front of his two Eyes;
and he who is under the knife is protected likewise. Horus is protected
**230** in his own body, and the spells which his mother Isis hath woven
protect him. Horus is protected by the names of his father \[Osiris\] in
**231** his forms in the nomes; <span id="fr_253"></span>[4](#fn_251.md)
and he who is under the knife is protected likewise. Horus is protected
by the weeping of his mother, and by the cries of grief of his brethren;
and he **232** who is under the knife is protected likewise. Horus is
protected by his own name and heart, and the gods go round about him to
make his funeral bed; and he who is under the knife is protected
likewise."

\[And Thoth said:\]

"**233**. Wake up, Horus! Thy protection is established. Make thou happy
the heart of thy mother Isis. The words of Horus shall bind **234** up
hearts, he shall cause to be at peace him who is in affliction. Let your
hearts be happy, O ye who dwell in the heavens (Nut). Horus, he **235**
who hath avenged (or, protected) his father shall cause the poison to

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span> <span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

retreat. Verily that which is in the mouth of Ra shall go round about
(i.e., circulate), and the **236** tongue of the Great God shall repulse
\[opposition\]. The Boat \[of Ra\] standeth still, and travelleth not
onwards. The Disk is in the \[same\] place where it was yesterday to
heal **237** Horus for his mother Isis, and to heal him that is under
the knife of his mother <span id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_252.md) likewise.
**238**. Come to the earth, draw nigh, O Boat of Ra, make the boat to
travel, O mariners of heaven, **239** transport provisions (?) of . . .
. . . Sekhem <span id="fr_255"></span>[2](#fn_253.md) to heal Horus for his
mother Isis, and to heal **240** him that is under the knife of his
mother likewise. Hasten away, O pain which is in the **241** region
round about, and let it (i.e., the Boat) descend upon the place where it
was yesterday to heal Horus for his mother Isis, **242** and to heal him
that is under the knife of his mother likewise. Get thee round and
round, O bald (?) fiend, without horns **243** at the seasons (?), not
seeing the forms through the shadow of the two Eyes, to heal Horus for
his mother **244** Isis, and to heal him that is under the knife
likewise. Be filled, O two halves of heaven, be empty, O papyrus roll,
return, O life, into the living to heal Horus for his it mother Isis,
**245** and to heal him that is under the knife likewise. Come thou to
earth, O poison. Let hearts be glad, and let radiance (or, light) go
round about.

"I am Thoth, <span id="fr_256"></span>[3](#fn_254.md) the firstborn son,
the son of Ra, and Tem and the Company of the gods have commanded

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span> <span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

me to heal Horus for his mother Isis, and to heal him that is under the
knife likewise. O Horus, O Horus, thy KA protecteth thee, and thy Image
worketh protection for thee. The poison is as the daughter of its
\[own\] flame; \[it is\] destroyed \[because\] it smote the strong son.
**246**. Your temples are in good condition for you, \[for\] Horus
liveth for his mother, and he who is under the knife likewise."

And the goddess Isis said:

"Set thou his face towards those who dwell in the North Land (Ateh), the
nurses who dwell in the city Pe-Tept (Buto), for they have offered very
large offerings in order to cause the child to be made strong for his
mother, and to make strong him that is under the knife likewise. Do not
allow them to recognize the divine KA in the Swamp Land, in the city (?)
of Nemhettu (?) \[and\] in her city."

247\. Then spake Thoth unto the great gods who dwell in the Swamp-Land
\[saying\]: "O ye nurses who dwell in the city of Pe, who smite
\[fiends\] with your hands, and overthrow \[them\] with your arms on
behalf of that Great One who appeareth in front of you **248** \[in\]
the Sektet Boat, <span id="fr_257"></span>[1](#fn_255.md) let the
Matet <span id="fr_258"></span>[2](#fn_256) (Mantchet.md) Boat travel on.
Horus is to you, he is counted up for life, and he is declared for
**249** the life of his father \[Osiris\]. I have given gladness unto
those who are in the Sektet Boat, and the mariners \[of Ra\] make it to
journey on. Horus liveth for his mother Isis. and he who is under the
knife liveth for

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span> <span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

his mother likewise. As for the poison, the strength thereof has been
made powerless. Verily I am a favoured one, and I will join myself
**250** to his hour <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_257.md) to hurl back
the report of evil to him that sent it forth. The heart of Ra-Heru-Khuti
rejoiceth. Thy son Horus is counted up for life \[which is\] on this
child to make him to smite, and to retreat (?) from those who are above,
and to turn back the paths of the Sebiu fiends from him, so that he may
take possession of the throne of the Two Lands. Ra is in heaven to make
answer on **251** behalf of him and his father. The words of power of
his mother have lifted up his face, and they protect him and enable him
to go round about wheresoever he pleaseth, and to set the terror of him
in celestial beings. I have made haste . . . . . ."
