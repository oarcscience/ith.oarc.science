XIX\. After these things Osiris returned from the other world, and
appeared to his son Horus, and encouraged him to fight, and at the same
time instructed him in the exercise of arms. He then asked him what he
thought was the most glorious action a man could perform, to which Horus
replied, "To revenge the injuries offered to his father <span
id="fr_310"></span>[2](#fn_308.md) and mother." Osiris then asked him what
animal he thought most serviceable to a soldier, and Horus replied, "A
horse." On this Osiris

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

wondered, and he questioned him further, asking him why he preferred a
horse to a lion, and Horus replied, "Though the lion is the more
serviceable creature to one who stands in need of help, yet is the horse
more useful in overtaking and cutting off a flying enemy." <span
id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_309.md) These replies caused Osiris to rejoice
greatly, for they showed him that his son was sufficiently prepared for
his enemy. We are, moreover, told that amongst the great numbers who
were continually deserting from Typhon's party was his concubine
Thoueris, <span id="fr_312"></span>[2](#fn_310.md) and that a serpent which
pursued her as she was coming over to Horus was slain by his soldiers.
The memory of this action is, they say, still preserved in that cord
which is thrown into the midst of their assemblies, and then chopped in
pieces. Afterwards a battle took place between Horus and Typhon, which
lasted many days, but Horus was at length victorious, and Typhon was
taken prisoner. He was delivered over into the custody of Isis, who,
instead of putting him to death, loosed his fetters and set him free.
This action of his mother incensed Horus to such a degree that he seized
her, and pulled the royal crown off her head; but Hermes came forward,
and set upon her head the head of an ox

instead of a helmet. <span id="fr_313"></span>[1](leg48.htm#fn_311.md)
After this Typhon accused Horus of illegitimacy, but, by the assistance
of Hermes, his legitimacy was fully established by a decree of the gods
themselves. <span id="fr_314"></span>[2](leg48.htm#fn_312.md) After this
two other battles were fought between Horus and Typhon, and in both
Typhon was defeated. Moreover, Isis is said to have had union with
Osiris after his death, <span id="fr_315"></span>[3](leg48.htm#fn_313.md)
and she brought forth Harpokrates, <span
id="fr_316"></span>[4](leg48.htm#fn_314.md) who came into the world before
his time, and was lame in his lower limbs.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_307"></span>[226:1](leg46.htm#fr_309.md) We meet with a
similar statement in the Tale of the Two Brothers, where we are told
that the younger brother, having declared his innocence to the elder
brother, out off his phallus and threw it into the river, where it was
devoured by the *naru* fish.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[226:2](leg47.htm#fr_310.md) The texts give as a
very common title of Horus, "Horus, the avenger of his father."

<span id="fn_309"></span>[227:1](leg47.htm#fr_311.md) There is no evidence
that the Egyptians employed the horse in war before the XVIIIth Dynasty,
a fact which proves that the dialogue here given is an invention of a
much later date than the original legend of Osiris.

the hippopotamus goddess.
