### A HYMN TO OSIRIS AND A LEGEND OF THE ORIGIN OF HORUS.

1\. Homage to thee, Osiris, Lord of eternity, King of the gods, whose
names are manifold, whose transformations are sublime, whose form is
hidden in the temples whose KA is holy, the Governor of Tetut, <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_118) the mighty one of possessions (?) **2**
in the shrine, <span id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_119) the Lord of
praises <span id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_120) in the nome of
Anetch, <span id="fr_122"></span>[4](#fn_121) President of the *tchefa*
food in Anu, <span id="fr_123"></span>[5](#fn_122) Lord who art
commemorated in \[the town of\] Maati, <span
id="fr_124"></span>[6](#fn_123) the mysterious (or, hidden) Soul, the
Lord of Qerret, <span id="fr_125"></span>[7](#fn_124) the sublime one in
White Wall, <span id="fr_126"></span>[8](#fn_125) the Soul of Ra \[and\]
his very body, who hast thy dwelling in **3** Henensu, <span
id="fr_127"></span>[9](#fn_126) the beneficent one, who art praised in
Nart, <span id="fr_128"></span>[10](#fn_127) who makest to rise up thy
Soul, Lord of the Great House in the city <span
id="fr_129"></span>[11](#fn_128) of the Eight Gods, <span
id="fr_130"></span>[12](#fn_129) \[who inspirest\]

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span> <span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

great terror in Shas-hetep, <span id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_130) Lord
of eternity, Governor of Abtu (Abydos).

Thy seat (or, domain) reacheth far into Ta-tchesert, <span
id="fr_132"></span>[2](#fn_131) and thy name is firmly stablished in the
mouth\[s\] of men. **4**. Thou art the two-fold substance of the Two
Lands <span id="fr_133"></span>[3](#fn_132) everywhere (?), and the
divine food (*tchef*) of the KAU, <span id="fr_134"></span>[4](#fn_133)
the Governor of the Companies <span id="fr_135"></span>[5](#fn_134) of
the Gods, and the beneficent (or, perfect) Spirit-soul <span
id="fr_136"></span>[6](#fn_135) among Spirit-souls. The god Nu draweth
his waters from thee, <span id="fr_137"></span>[7](#fn_136) and thou
bringest forth the north wind at eventide, and wind from thy nostrils to
the satisfaction of thy heart. **5**. Thy heart flourisheth, and thou
bringest forth the splendour of *tchef* food.

The height of heaven and the stars \[thereof\] are obedient unto thee,
and thou makest to be opened the great gates \[of the sky\]. Thou art
the lord to whom praises are sung in the southern heaven, thou art he to
whom thanks are given in the northern heaven. The stars which never
**6** diminish are under the place of thy face, <span
id="fr_138"></span>[8](#fn_137) and thy seats are the stars which never
rest. <span id="fr_139"></span>[9](#fn_138) Offerings appear before thee
by the command of Keb. The Companies of the Gods ascribe praise unto
thee, the Star-gods of the Tuat smell the earth before thee, <span
id="fr_140"></span>[10](#fn_139) the domains \[make\] bowings \[before
thee\], and the

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span> <span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

ends of the earth make supplication to thee **7** \[when\] they see
thee.

Those who are among the holy ones are in terror of him, and the Two
Lands, all of them, make acclamations to him when they meet His Majesty.
Thou art a shining Noble at the head of the nobles, permanent in \[thy\]
high rank, stablished in \[thy\] sovereignty, the beneficent Power of
the Company of the Gods. Well-pleasing \[is thy\] face, **8** and thou
art beloved by him that seeth thee. Thou settest the fear of thee in all
lands, and because of their love for thee \[men\] hold thy name to be
pre-eminent. Every man maketh offerings unto thee, and thou art the Lord
who is commemorated in heaven and upon earth. Manifold are the cries of
acclamation to thee in the Uak <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_140)
festival, and the **9** Two Lands shout joyously to thee with one
accord. Thou art the eldest, the first of thy brethren, the Prince of
the Company of the Gods, and the stablisher of Truth throughout the Two
Lands. Thou settest \[thy\] son upon the great throne of his father Keb.
Thou art the beloved one of thy mother Nut, whose valour is most mighty
\[when\] thou overthrowest the Seba Fiend. **10**. Thou hast slaughtered
thy enemy, and hast put the fear of thee into thy Adversary.

Thou art the bringer in of the remotest boundaries, and art stable of
heart, and thy two feet are lifted up (?); thou art the heir of Keb and
of the sovereignty of the Two Lands, and he (i.e., Keb) hath seen thy

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span> <span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

splendid qualities, and hath commanded thee to guide **11** the lands
(i.e., the world) by thy hand so long as times \[and seasons\] endure.

Thou hast made this earth with thy hand, the waters thereof, the winds
thereof, the trees and herbs thereof, the cattle thereof of every kind,
the birds thereof of every kind, the fish thereof of every kind, the
creeping things thereof, and the four-footed beasts thereof. The land of
the desert <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_141) belongeth by right to
**12** the son of Nut, and the Two Lands have contentment in making him
to rise <span id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_142) upon the throne of his
father like Ra.

Thou rollest up into the horizon, thou settest the light above the
darkness, thou illuminest \[the Two Lands\] with the light from thy two
plumes, thou floodest the Two Lands like the **13** Disk at the
beginning of the dawn. Thy White Crown pierceth the height of heaven
saluting the stars, <span id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_143) thou art the
guide of every god. Thou art perfect <span
id="fr_145"></span>[4](#fn_144) in command and word. Thou art the
favoured one of the Great Company of the Gods, and thou art the beloved
one of the Little Company of the Gods.

Thy sister \[Isis\] acted as a protectress to thee. She drove \[thy\]
enemies away, **14** she averted seasons \[of calamity from thee\], she
recited the word (or, formula) with the magical power of her mouth,
\[being\] skilled of tongue and never halting for a word, being perfect
in command and word. Isis the magician avenged her brother. She went
about seeking for him untiringly.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span> <span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

\[paragraph continues\] **15**. She flew round and round over this earth
uttering wailing cries of grief, and she did not alight on the ground
until she had found him. She made light \[to come forth\] from her
feathers, she made air to come into being by means of her two wings, and
she cried out the death cries for her brother. **16**. She made to rise
up the helpless members of him whose heart was at rest, she drew from
him his essence, and she made therefrom an heir. She suckled the child
in solitariness and none knew where his. place was, and he grew in
strength. His hand is mighty (or, victorious) within the house **17** of
Keb, and the Company of the Gods rejoice greatly at the coming of Horus,
the son of Osiris, whose heart is firmly stablished, the triumphant one,
the son of Isis, the flesh and bone of Osiris. The Tchatcha <span
id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_145) of Truth, and the Company of the Gods,
and Neb-er-tcher <span id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_146) himself, and the
Lords of Truth, gather together to him, and assemble therein. <span
id="fr_148"></span>[3](#fn_147) **18**. Verily those who defeat iniquity
rejoice <span id="fr_149"></span>[4](#fn_148) in the House of Keb to
bestow the divine rank and dignity upon him to whom it belongeth, and
the sovereignty upon him whose it is by right.
