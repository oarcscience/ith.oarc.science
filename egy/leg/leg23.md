### A LEGEND OF PTAH NEFER-HETEP AND THE PRINCESS OF BEKHTEN.

1\. The Horus: "Mighty Bull, the form(?) of risings <span
id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_149.md), stablished in sovereignty like Tem."
The Golden Horus: "Mighty one of strength <span
id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_150.md), destroyer of the Nine Nations of the
Bow." <span id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_151.md) King of the South and North:
"The Lord of the Two Lands, User-Maat-Ra-setep-en-Ra Son of Ra: "Of his
body, Ra-meses-meri-Amen, of Amen-Ra; <span
id="fr_153"></span>[4](#fn_152.md) **2** the Lord of the thrones of the Two
Lands, and of the Company of the Gods, the Lords of Thebes, the beloved
one. The beneficent god, the son of Amen, born of Mut, begotten of
Heru-khuti, the glorious offspring of Neb-tchert, <span
id="fr_154"></span>[5](#fn_153.md) begetting \[as\] the Bull of his
Mother, <span id="fr_155"></span>[6](#fn_154.md) king of Egypt, Governor of
the deserts, the Sovereign **3** who hath taken possession of the Nine
Nations of the Bow; \[who\] on coming forth from the womb ordained
mighty things, who gave commands whilst he was in the egg, the Bull,
stable of heart, who hath sent forth his seed; the king who is a bull,
\[and\] a god who cometh forth on the day of battle like Menthu, <span
id="fr_156"></span>[7](#fn_155.md) the mighty one of strength like the son
of Nut." <span id="fr_157"></span>[8](#fn_156.md)

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span> <span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

4\. Behold, His Majesty was in the country of Neheru <span
id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_157.md) according to his custom every year, and
the chiefs of every land, even as far as the swamps, came \[to pay\]
homage, bearing offerings to the Souls of His Majesty; and they brought
their gifts, gold, lapis-lazuli, turquoise, **5** bars of wood of every
kind of the Land of the God, <span id="fr_159"></span>[2](#fn_158.md) on
their backs, and each one surpassed his neighbour.

And the Prince of Bekhten \[also\] caused his gifts to be brought, and
he set his eldest daughter at the head of them all, and he addressed
words of praise to His Majesty, and prayed to him for his life. **6**.
And the maiden was beautiful, and His Majesty considered her to be the
most lovely \[woman\] in the world, and he wrote down as her title,
"Great Royal Wife, Ra-neferu; and when His Majesty arrived in Egypt, he
did for her whatsoever was done for the Royal Wife.

On the twenty-second day of the second month of the season of
Shemu, <span id="fr_160"></span>[3](#fn_159.md) in the fifteenth year \[of
his reign\], behold, His Majesty was in Thebes, the Mighty \[city\], the
Mistress of cities, performing **7** the praises of Father Amen, the
Lord of the thrones of the Two Lands, in his beautiful Festival of the
Southern Apt, <span id="fr_161"></span>[4](#fn_160.md) which was the seat
of his heart (i.e., the chosen spot) from primaeval time, \[when\] one
came to say to His Majesty, "An ambassador of the Prince of Bekhten hath
arrived bearing many gifts for the Royal Wife."

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span> <span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And having been brought into the presence of
**8** His Majesty with his gifts, he spake words of adoration to His
Majesty, saying, "Praise be unto thee, O thou Sun (Ra) of the Nine
Nations of the Bow, permit us to live before thee!" And when he had
spoken, and had smelt the earth before His Majesty, he continued his
speech before His Majesty, saying, "I have come unto thee, **9** my King
and Lord, on behalf of Bent-Resht, the younger sister of the Royal Wife
Ra-neferu. \[Some\] disease hath penetrated into her members, and I
beseech Thy Majesty to send a man of learning to see her."

And His Majesty said, "Bring to me the magicians (or, scribes) of the
House of Life, and the nobles **10** of the palace." And having been
brought into his presence straightway, His Majesty said unto them,
"Behold, I have caused you to be summoned \[hither\] in order that ye
may hear this matter. Now bring to me \[one\] of your company whose
heart is wise <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_161.md), and whose fingers
are deft." And the royal scribe **11** Tehuti-em-heb came into the
presence of His Majesty, and His Majesty commanded him to depart to
Bekhten with that ambassador.

And when the man of learning had arrived in Bekhten, he found Bent-Resht
in the condition of a woman who is possessed by a spirit, and he found
**12** this spirit to be an evil one, and to be hostile in his
disposition towards him.

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span> <span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

And the Prince of Bekhten sent a messenger a second time into the
presence of His Majesty, saying, "O King, my Lord, I pray His (i.e.,
Thy) Majesty to command that a god be brought hither \[to contend
against the spirit."

13\. Now when the messenger came\] to His Majesty in the first
month <span id="fr_163"></span>[1](#fn_162.md) of the season of Shemu, in
the twenty-sixth year \[of his reign\], on the day which coincided with
that of the Festival of Amen, His Majesty was in the palace (or,
temple?) of Thebes. And His Majesty spake a second time <span
id="fr_164"></span>[2](#fn_163.md) in the presence of Khensu in Thebes,
\[called\] "Nefer-Hetep," saying, "O my fair Lord, I present myself
before thee a second time on behalf of the daughter of the Prince of
Bekhten." **14**. Then Khensu, in Thebes, \[called\] "Nefer-Hetep", was
carried to Khensu, \[called\] "Pa-ari-sekher," the great god who driveth
away the spirits which attack. And His Majesty spake before Khensu in
Thebes, \[called\] "Nefer-Hetep," saying, "O my fair Lord, if thou wilt
give (i.e., turn) thy face to Khensu, \[called\] **15** 'Pa-ari-sekher,'
the great god who driveth away the spirits which attack, permit thou
that he may depart to Bekhten;" \[and the god\] inclined his head with a
deep inclination twice. And His Majesty said, "Let, I pray, thy
protective (or, magical) power \[go\] (with him, so that I may make His
Majesty to go to Bekhten to deliver the daughter of the Prince of
Bekhten \[from the spirit\].

16\. And Khensu in Thebes, \[called\] "Nefer-Hetep,"

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span> <span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

inclined his head with a deep inclination twice. And he made \[his\]
protective power to pass into Khensu, \[called\]
"Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast," in a fourfold measure. Then His Majesty
commanded that Khensu, \[called\] "Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast," should set
out on his journey in a great boat, \[accompanied by\] five smaller
boats, and chariots, **17** and a large number of horses \[which
marched\] on the right side and on the left.

And when this god arrived in Bekhten at the end of a period of one year
and five months, the Prince of Bekhten came forth with his soldiers and
his chief\[s\] before Khensu, \[called\] "Pa-ari-sekher," and he cast
himself down **18** upon his belly, saying, "Thou hast come to us, and
thou art welcomed by us, by the commands of the King of the South and
North, User-Maat-Ra-setep-en-Ra!"

And when this god had passed over to the place where Bent-Resht was, he
worked upon the daughter of the Prince of Bekhten with his magical
power, and she became better (i.e., was healed) **19** straightway. And
this spirit which had been with her said, in the presence of Khensu,
\[called\] "Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast," "Come in peace (i.e., Welcome!), O
great god, who dost drive away the spirits which attack! Bekhten is thy
city, the people thereof, both men and women, are thy (servants, and I
myself am thy servant. **20**. I will \[now\] depart unto the place
whence I came, so that I may cause thy heart to be content about the
matter

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span> <span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

concerning which thou hast come. I pray that Thy Majesty will command
that a happy day (i.e., a festival, or day of rejoicing) be made with
me, and with the Prince of Bekhten." And this god inclined his head \[in
approval\] to his priest, saying, **21** "Let the Prince of Bekhten make
a great offering in the (presence of this spirit."

Now whilst Khensu, \[called\] "Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast," was arranging
these \[things\] with the spirit, the Prince of Bekhten and his soldiers
were standing there, and they feared with an exceedingly great fear.
**22**. And the Prince of Bekhten made a great offering in the presence
of Khensu, \[called\] "Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast," and the spirit of the
Prince of Bekhten, and he made a happy day (i.e., festival) on their
behalf, and \[then\] the spirit departed in peace unto the place which
he loved, by the command of Khensu, \[called\] "Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast."
**23**. And the Prince of Bekhten, and every person who was in the
country of Bekhten, rejoiced very greatly, and he took counsel with his
heart, saying, "It hath happened that this god hath been given as a gift
to Bekhten, and I will not permit him to depart to Egypt."

24\. And \[when\] this god had tarried for three years and nine months
in Bekhten, the Prince of Bekhten, who was lying down asleep on his bed,
saw this god come forth outside his shrine (now he was in the form of a
golden hawk), and he flew up into the heavens and departed to Egypt; and
when the Prince woke up

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span> <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

\[paragraph continues\] **25** he was trembling. And he said unto the
prophet of Khensu, \[called\] "Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast," "This god who
tarried with us hath departed to Egypt; let his chariot also depart to
Egypt."

26\. And the Prince of Bekhten permitted \[the image of\] the god to set
out for Egypt, and he gave him many great gifts of beautiful things of
all kinds, and a large number of soldiers and horses \[went with him\].
And when they had arrived in peace in Thebes, Khensu, \[called\]
"Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast," **27** went into the Temple of Khensu in
Thebes, \[called\] "Nefer-Hetep," and he placed the offerings which the
Prince of Bekhten had given unto him, beautiful things of all kinds,
before Khensu in Thebes, \[called\] "Nefer-Hetep," and he gave nothing
thereof whatsoever to his \[own\] temple.

Thus Khensu, \[called\] "Pa-ari-sekher-em-Uast," arrived **28** in his
temple in peace, on the nineteenth day of the second month <span
id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) of the season Pert, in the thirty-third
year of the \[reign of the\] King of the South and North,
User-Maat-en-Ra-setep-en-Ra, the giver of life, like Ra, for ever.
