\[§ XXX. Typhon is held by the Egyptians in the greatest contempt, and
they do all they can to vilify him. The eolour red being associated with
him, they treat with contumely all those who have a ruddy complexion;
the ass <span id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_323) being usually of a reddish
colour, the men of Koptos are in the habit of sacrificing asses by
casting them down precipices. The inhabitants of Busiris and Lycopolis
never use trumpets, because their sounds resemble the braying of an ass.
The

cakes which are offered at the festivals during Paoni and Paopi are
stamped with the figure of a fettered ass. The Pythagoreans regarded
Typhon as a daemon, and according to them he was produced in the even
number fifty-six; and Eudoxus says that a figure of fifty-six angles
typifies the nature of Typhon.\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_323"></span>[237:1](leg56.htm#fr_325) The ass is associated
with Set, or Typhon, in the texts, but on account of his virility he
also typifies a form of the Sun-god. In a hymn the deceased prays, "May
I smite the Ass, may I crush the serpent-fiend Sebau," but the XLth
Chapter of the Book of the Dead is entitled, "Chapter of driving back
the Eater of the Ass." The vignette shows us the deceased in the act of
spearing a monster serpent which has fastened its jaws in the back of an
ass. In Chapter CXXV. there is a dialogue between the Cat and the Ass.
