X. And this is still farther evinced from those voyages which have been
made into Egypt by the wisest men among the Greeks, namely, by Solo,
Thales Plato, Eudoxus, Pythagoras, and, as some say, even by Lycurgus
himself, on purpose to converse with the priests. And we are also told
that Eudoxus was a disciple of Chnouphis the Memphite, Solo of Sonchis
the Saïte, and Pythagoras of Oinuphis the Heliopolite. But none of these
philosophers seems either to have been more admired and in greater
favour with the priests, or to have paid a more especial regard to their
method of philosophising, than this last named, who has particularly
imitated their mysterious and symbolical manner in his own writings, and
like them conveyed his doctrines to the world in a kind of riddle. For
many of the precepts of Pythagoras come nothing short of the
hieroglyphical representations themselves, such as, "eat not in a
chariot," "sit not on a measure (choenix)," "plant not a palm-tree," and
"stir not the fire with a sword in the house." And I myself am of the
opinion that, when the Pythagoreans appropriated the names of several of
the gods to particular numbers, as that of Apollo to the unit, of
Artemis to the duad, of Athene to the seven, and of Poseidon to the
first cube, in this they allude to something which the founder of their
sect saw in the Egyptian temples, or to some ceremonies performed in
them, or to some symbols

there exhibited. Thus, their great king and lord Osiris is represented
by the hieroglyphics for an eye and a sceptre, <span
id="fr_287"></span>[1](#fn_285.md) the name itself signifying "many-eyed,"
as we are told by some <span id="fr_288"></span>[2](#fn_286.md) who would
derive it from the words *os*, <span id="fr_289"></span>[3](#fn_287.md)
"many," and *iri*, <span id="fr_290"></span>[4](#fn_288.md) an "eye," which
have this meaning in the Egyptian language. Similarly, because the
heavens are eternal and are never consumed or wax old, they represent
them by a heart with a censer placed under it. Much in the same way are
those statues of the Judges at Thebes without hands, and their chief, or
president, is represented with his eyes turned downwards, which
signifies that justice ought not to be obtainable by bribes, nor guided
by favour or affection. Of a like nature is the Beetle which we see
engraven upon the seals of the soldiers, for there is no such thing as a
female beetle of this species; for they are all males, and they
propagate their kind by casting their seed into round balls of dirt,
which afford not only a proper place wherein the young may be hatched,
but also nourishment for them as soon as they are born.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_285"></span>[213:1](leg38.htm#fr_287.md) The oldest form of
the name is AS-AR, <span id="img_21300"></span> ![](img/21300.jpg); the
first sign, <span id="img_21301"></span> ![](img/21301.jpg), is a
throne, and the second, <span id="img_21302"></span> ![](img/21302.jpg),
is an eye, but the exact meaning represented by the two signs is not
known. In late times a sceptre, <span id="img_21303"></span>
![](img/21303.jpg) took the place of the throne, but only because of its
phonetic value *as* or *us*. Thus we have the forms <span
id="img_21304"></span> ![](img/21304.jpg) and <span
id="img_21305"></span> ![](img/21305.jpg).

<span id="fn_286"></span>[213:2](leg38.htm#fr_288.md) This is a mistake.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[213:3](leg38.htm#fr_289.md) In Egyptian, <span
id="img_21306"></span> ![](img/21306.jpg) *ash*, "many."

<span id="fn_288"></span>[213:4](leg38.htm#fr_290.md) in Egyptian, <span
id="img_21307"></span> ![](img/21307.jpg) *art*, Coptic <span
id="img_21308"></span> ![](img/21308.jpg), "eye."
