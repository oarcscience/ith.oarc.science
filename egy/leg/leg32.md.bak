IV\. Nor, indeed, ought such an examination to be looked on as
unnecessary whilst there are so many ignorant of the true reason even of
the most ordinary rites observed by the Egyptian priests, such as their
shavings <span id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_265.md) and wearing linen
garments. Some, indeed, there are who never trouble themselves to think
at all about these matters, whilst others rest satisfied with the most
superficial accounts of them: "They pay a

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

peculiar veneration to the sheep, <span id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_266.md)
therefore they think it their duty not only to abstain from eating its
flesh, but likewise from wearing its wool. They are continually mourning
for their gods, therefore they shave themselves. The light azure blossom
of the flax resembles the clear and bloomy colour of the ethereal sky,
therefore they wear linen"; whereas the true reason of the institution
and observation of these rites is but one, and that common to all of
them, namely, the extraordinary notions which they entertain of
cleanliness, persuaded as they are, according to the saying of Plato,
"none but the pure ought to approach the pure." Now, no superfluity of
our food, and no excrementitious substance, is looked upon by them as
pure and clean; such, however, are all kinds of wool and down, our hair
and our nails. It would be the highest absurdity, therefore, for those
who, whilst; they are in a course of purification, are at so much pains
to take off the hair from every part of their own bodies, at the same
time to clothe themselves with that of other animals. So when we are
told by Hesiod "not to pare our nails whilst we are present at the
festivals of the gods," <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_267.md) we ought
to understand that he intended hereby to inculcate that purity wherewith
we ought to

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

come prepared before we enter upon any religious duty, that we have not
to make ourselves clean whilst we ought to be occupied in attending to
the solemnity itself. Now, with regard to flax, this springs out of the
immortal earth itself; and not only produces a fruit fit for food, but
moreover furnishes a light and neat sort of clothing, extremely
agreeable to the wearer, adapted to all the seasons of the year, and not
in the least subject, as is said, to produce or nourish vermin; but more
of this in another place.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_265"></span>[202:1](leg32.htm#fr_267.md) A rubric in the
papyrus of Nes-Menu in the British Museum orders the priestesses of Isis
and Nephthys to have "the hair of their bodies shaved off" (No. 10,188,
col. 1), but they are also ordered to wear fillets of rams' wool on
their heads.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[203:1](leg32.htm#fr_268.md) Probably the ram of
Amen. Animal sacrifices were invariably bulls and cows.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[203:2](leg32.htm#fr_269.md) This saying is by
Pythagoras--Παρὰ θυσίαν μὴ ὀνυχίζου. The saying of Hesiod (*Works and
Days*, 740) is rendered by Goodwin:--

"Not at a feast of Gods from five-branched tree,  
With sharp-edged steel to part the green from dry."
