\[FIRST EXPLANATION OF THE STORY.\]

XXII\. Now as to those who, from many things of this kind, some of which
are proclaimed openly, and others are darkly hinted at in their
religious institutions, would conclude that the whole story h no other
than a mere commemoration of the various actions of

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

their kings and other great men, who, by reason of their excellent
virtue and the mightiness of their power, added to their other titles
the honour of divinity, though they afterwards fell into many and
grievous calamities, those, I say, who would in this manner account for
the various scenes above-mentioned, must be owned indeed to make use of
a very plausible method of eluding such difficulties as may arise about
this subject, and ingeniously enough to transfer the most shocking parts
of it from the divine to the human nature. Moreover, it must be admitted
that such a solution is not entirely destitute of any appearance of
historical evidence for its support. For when the Egyptians themselves
tell us that Hermes had one hand shorter than another, that Typhon was
of red complexion, Horus fair, and Osiris black, does not this show that
they were of the human species, and subject to the same accidents as all
other men? <span id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_322.md) Nay, they go farther,
and even declare the particular work in which each was engaged whilst
alive. Thus they say that Osiris was a general, that Canopus, from whom
the star took its name, was a pilot, and that the ship which the Greeks
call Argo, being made in imitation of the ship of Osiris, was, in honour
of him, turned into a constellation and placed near Orion and the
Dog-star, the former being sacred to Horus and the latter to Isis.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_320"></span>[232:1](leg49.htm#fr_322.md) In Egyptian,
Pa-Asar-neb-Tetu, "the house of Osiris, the lord of Tetu." In the temple
of Neb-Sekert, the backbone of the god was preserved, according to one
text, but another says it was his jaws(?) and interior.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[232:2](leg49.htm#fr_323.md) This view represents
a late tradition, or at all events one which sprang up after the decay
of Abydos.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[233:1](leg50.htm#fr_324.md) Red is the colour
attributed to all fiends in the Egyptian texts. One of the forms of
Horus is described as being "blue-eyed," and the colour of the face of
Osiris is often green, and sometimes black.
