### THE LEGEND OF THE DESTRUCTION OF MANKIND

### CHAPTER IV.

IV\. AND THE MAJESTY OF THIS GOD SAID, "Call to me the god Thoth," and
one brought the god to him forthwith. And the Majesty of this god said
unto Thoth, "Let us depart to a distance from heaven, from my place,
because I would make light and the god of light (KHU) in the Tuat and
\[in\] the Land of Caves. Thou shalt write down \[the things which are\]
in it, and thou shalt punish those who are in it, that is to say, the

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span> <span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

workers who have worked iniquity (or, rebellion). Through thee I will
keep away from the servants whom this heart \[of mine\] loatheth. Thou
shalt be in my place (*ast*) ASTI, and thou shalt therefore be called, O
Thoth, the 'ASTI of Ra.' Moreover, I give thee power to send (*hab*)
forth . . . . .; thereupon shall come into being the Ibis (*habi*) bird
of Thoth. I moreover give thee \[power\] to lift up thine hand before
the two Companies of the gods who are greater than thou, and what thou
doest shall be fairer than \[the work of\] the god KHEN; therefore shall
the divine bird *tekni* of Thoth come into being. Moreover, I give thee
\[Power\] to embrace (*anh*) the two heavens with thy beauties, and with
thy rays of light; therefore shall come into being the Moon-god (*Aah*)
of Thoth. Moreover, I give thee \[power\] to drive back (*anan*) the
Ha-nebu; <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_63) therefore shall come into
being the dog-headed Ape (*anan*) of Thoth, and he shall act as governor
for me. Moreover, thou art now in my place in the sight of all those who
see thee and who present offerings to thee, and every being shall
ascribe praise unto thee, O thou who art God."
