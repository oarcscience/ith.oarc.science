IX\. Now, the kings of Egypt were always chosen either out of the
soldiery or priesthood, the former order being honoured and respected
for its valour, and the latter for its wisdom. If the choice fell upon a
soldier, he was immediately initiated into the order of priests, and by
them instructed in their abstruse and hidden philosophy, a philosophy
for the most part involved in fable and allegory, and exhibiting only
dark hints and obscure resemblances of the truth. This the priesthood
hints to us in many instances, particularly by the sphinxes, which they
seem to have placed designedly before their temples as types of the
enigmatical nature of their theology. To this purpose,

likewise, is that inscription which they have engraved upon the base of
the statue of Athene <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_281.md) at Saïs, whom
they identify with Isis: "I am everything that has been, that is, and
that shall be: and my veil no man hath raised." In like manner the word
"Amoun," or as it is expressed in the Greek language, "Ammôn," which is
generally looked upon as the proper name of the Egyptian Zeus, is
interpreted by Manetho <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_282.md) the
Sebennite <span id="fr_285"></span>[3](#fn_283.md) to signify "concealment"
or "something which is hidden." <span id="fr_286"></span>[4](#fn_284.md)
Hecataeus of Abdera indeed tells us that the Egyptians make use of this
term when they call out to one another. If this be so, then their
invoking Amoun is the same thing as calling upon the supreme being, whom
they believe to be "hidden" and "concealed" in the universal nature, to
appear and manifest itself to them. So cautious and reserved was

the Egyptian wisdom in those things which appertained to religion.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_279"></span>[210:1](leg36.htm#fr_281.md) In Egyptian,
TAFNEKHT, the first king of the XXIVth Dynasty.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[210:2](leg36.htm#fr_282.md) An unlikely story,
for Tafnekht had no authority at Thebes.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[211:1](leg37.htm#fr_283.md) The Egyptian goddess
Net, in Greek Νηιθ, the great goddess of Saïs, in the Western Delta. She
was self-existent, and produced her son, the Sun-god, without union with
a god. In an address to her, quoted by Mallet (*Culte de Neit*, p. 140),
are found the words, "thy garment hath not been unloosed," thus
Plutarch's quotation is correct.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[211:2](leg37.htm#fr_284.md) He compiled a History
of Egypt for Ptolemy II., and flourished about B.C. 270; only the
King-List from this work is preserved.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[211:3](leg37.htm#fr_285.md) He was a native of
the town of Sebennytus.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[211:4](leg37.htm#fr_286.md) *Amen* means
"hidden," and AMEN is the "hidden god."
