XII\. Now, the story of Isis and Osiris, its most insignificant and
superfluous parts being omitted, runs thus:--

The goddess Rhea, <span id="fr_294"></span>[1](#fn_292.md) they say, having
accompanied with Kronos <span id="fr_295"></span>[2](#fn_293.md) by
stealth, was discovered by Helios <span id="fr_296"></span>[3](#fn_294.md)
who straightway cursed her, and declared that she should not be
delivered in any month or year. Hermes, however, 'being also in love
with the same goddess, in return for the favours which he had

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

received from her, went and played at dice with Selene, <span
id="fr_297"></span>[1](#fn_295.md) and won from her the seventieth part of
each day. These parts he joined together and made from them five
complete days, and he added them to the three hundred and sixty days of
which the year formerly consisted. These five days are to this day
called the "Epagomenae," <span id="fr_298"></span>[2](#fn_296.md) that is,
the superadded, and they are observed by them as the birthdays of their
gods. <span id="fr_299"></span>[3](#fn_297.md) On the first of these, they
say, Osiris was born, and as he came into the world a voice was heard
saying, "The Lord of All <span id="fr_300"></span>[4](#fn_298.md) is born."
Some relate the matter in a different way, and say that a certain person
named Pamyles, as he was fetching water from the temple of Dios at
Thebes, heard a voice commanding

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

him to proclaim aloud that the good and great king Osiris was then born,
and that for this reason Kronos committed the education of the child to
him, and that in memory of this event the Pamylia were afterwards
instituted, which closely resemble the Phallephoria or Priapeia of the
Greeks. Upon the second of these days was born Aroueris, <span
id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_299.md) whom some call Apollo, and others the
Elder Horus. Upon the third day Typhon was born, who came into the world
neither at the proper time nor by the right way, but he forced a passage
through a wound which he made in his mother's side. Upon the fourth day
Isis was born, in the marshes of Egypt, <span
id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_300.md) and upon the fifth day Nephthys, whom
some call Teleute, or Aphrodite, or Nike, was born. As regards the
fathers of these children, the first two are said to have been begotten
by Helios, Isis by Hermes, and Typhon and Nephthys by Kronos. Therefore,
since the third of the superadded days was the birthday of Typhon, the
kings considered it to be unlucky, <span id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_301.md)
and in consequence they neither transacted any business in it, nor even
suffered themselves to take any refreshment until the evening. They
further add that Typhon married Nephthys, <span
id="fr_304"></span>[4](#fn_302.md) and that Isis and Osiris, having a

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

mutual affection, enjoyed each other in their mother's womb before they
were born, and that from this commerce sprang Aroueris, whom the
Egyptians likewise call Horus the Elder, and the Greeks Apollo.
