\[§ XXXI. The Egyptians only sacrifice red-coloured bulls, and a single
black or white hair in the animal's head disqualifies it for sacrifice.
They sacrifice creatures wherein the souls of the wicked have been
confined, and through this view arose the custom of cursing the animal
to be sacrificed, and cutting off its bead and throwing it into the
Nile. No bullock is sacrificed which has not on it the seal of the
priests who were called "Sealers." The impression from this seal
represents a man upon his knees, with his hands tied behind him, and a
sword pointed at his throat. The ass is identified with Typhon not only
because of his colour, but also because of his stupidity and the
sensuality of his disposition. The Persian king Ochus was nicknamed the
"Ass," which made him to say, "This ass shall dine upon your ox," and
accordingly he slew Apis. Typhon is said to have escaped from Horus by a
flight of seven days on an ass.\]
