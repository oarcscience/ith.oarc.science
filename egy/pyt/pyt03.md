# INTRODUCTION

The famous Pyramid Texts herein translated for the first time in English
with commentary were found inscribed on the walls of five pyramids at
Saḳḳâreh, the ancient necropolis of Memphis in Egypt. These pyramids are
those of the kings Unis of the Fifth Dynasty, and Teti, Pepi I, Merenrē‘
and Pepi II of the Sixth Dynasty. To this translation has been added
that of recently discovered additional texts, parallel and
complementary, in the pyramids of Oudjebten, Neit, and Apouit, queens of
Pepi II, and of Ibi, a king of the Seventh Dynasty, of whom little
historically is known. Thus, according to the present generally accepted
chronology, these pyramids were constructed, and apparently inscribed,
between the years about 2350 to 2175 B.C. It is, however, certain that
many of these texts came into existence before the final union of Upper
and Lower Egypt, and perhaps long before that date, which is now put at
about 3000 B.C. Indeed, some of them possibly existed in oral form
before the art of writing was developed. These inscriptions together
with others were after that probably written on papyrus and potsherds,
many of which in time perished, the rest remaining in various forms
until they were collected and incised on the walls of the Saḳḳâreh h
pyramids. Evidence of a date previous to about 3000 B.C. is seen in
passages which reflect events and conditions previous to the union of
the two Lands, for example, the hostility between North and South,
before the time of the first king, Menes; in the mode of burying bodies
of the dead in the sand; in the pre-civilized era reflected in the
so-called Cannibal Hymn; and in the many references to the assembling of
the bones of the deceased, passages which indicate a pre-mummification
period. And in the historic period various chronological points can be
established with fair certainty, such as the time of the Second Dynasty,
when both Horus and Set were in favour in royal circles; references to
previously written material such as the "Chapter of those who ascend"
and the "Chapter of those who raise themselves up," 1245d-e, indicating
a time in the historic period in which writing became common; and the
formulae for the protection of pyramids, such as, Uts. 600-601, which
represent a date after the time of the

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

construction of pyramids. So that the myths and legends, the history and
philosophy, the hopes and fears of people (subjects as well as monarchs)
of many hundreds of years were finally inscribed in enduring stone,
which over four thousand years removed from our time, may now be read
with comparative ease and certainty, thanks to the modern discipline of
archaeological research and philology. The extent of this written
material may be appreciated in saying that it takes well over a thousand
pages of two quarto volumes to contain it. In the standard modern
edition of the original text, together with parallels and additions from
the pyramids of Pepi II, Neit, and others, there are about 7000 lines,
most of which are parallels, of more or less completeness of the
estimated 2500 lines, which occur in one or other of the pyramids; for
most of the utterances occur in more than one pyramid, but very few are
repeated in all these pyramids. Thus, the pyramid of Unis has only two
hundred and eight utterances out of a total of over seven hundred and
thirty; and they with those of the pyramid of Teti are among the oldest
in the collection.

A general idea of the contents of this mass of literary material may be
seen in the detailed list of Contents preceding this Introduction; but
that does not mean that these texts present a coherent whole, for they
do not; and while there are clearly three outstanding elements in them,
namely, Solar Theology, Religion and Myths of Osiris, and the Political
unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, yet the following seven points may
be taken to represent the whole collection with fair general accuracy:
1) A funerary ritual of mortuary offerings, connected with the corporeal
reconstitution and resurrection of the deceased king, 2) Magical
formulae to ward against harm and evil, 3) A ritual of worship, 4)
Religious hymns, 5) Mythical formulae, identifying the deceased king
with certain deities, 6) Prayers and petitions on behalf of the deceased
king, and 7) The greatness and power of the deceased king in heaven.

These pyramid texts were royal texts, and during the Old Kingdom there
is no evidence that the people ever took them to themselves and used
them in their own tombs. However, at the end of the Sixth Dynasty, Neit,
one of the queens of Pepi II, had them applied to herself, though the
second person and third person masculine singular were often used and
applied to her; but during the Middle Kingdom the use of them spread to
the nobles, and in the New Kingdom parts of them were incorporated in
the popular Theban Book of the Dead.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

\[paragraph continues\] And doubtless because of their sanctity little
attempt was made to put them in accord with changed circumstances.

When these small pyramids were built and inscribed the age of the great
pyramids, like those at Giza, had passed, and with it the sense of royal
security after this life. The great pyramids had been entered in spite
of their thousands of tons of masonry, and kings came to look elsewhere
for the assurance of a happy and glorious hereafter. They turned to
religion and magic. By mortuary offerings and funerary rites the
deceased king was armed for his future life; and by magic he was endowed
with physical and spiritual power, becoming a great god and associating
with the gods, to avoid whatever in the world to come might otherwise
compromise his destiny. The purpose of these royal texts then was to
guarantee the deceased king's resurrection and new-birth, his
transfiguration and divinity, his successful journey to heaven, and his
immortality there with the other gods. There in heaven as a great god,
sometimes as the greatest of all the, gods, the deceased king was
believed to be able to overcome all difficulties by his own might, or by
identifying himself with other gods.

In the earliest of these texts two very ancient doctrines may be
discerned: that of the old heaven-god, perhaps Horus the elder, in which
the deceased king as a star was prominent, and that of the sun-god where
the deceased as the sun-god was contemplated. But the two were
harmonized doubtless at a very early period, when the celestial abode of
the heaven- and star-gods became identified with that of the solar
deities. But what we do see more clearly in the Pyramid Texts are the
two opposing systems of theological thought, that of Rē‘ of Heliopolis
and that of Osiris. The Pyramid Texts were largely solar, but long
before the texts were inscribed in the pyramids of Saḳḳâreh, there
existed Osirian texts as well as Solar ones, though there is reason to
believe that the learned men and scribes of Heliopolis were the first to
make collections of their texts. And gradually as such collections were
being made, there was a tendency to include Osirian texts, as well as,
an effort on the part of Osirians to facilitate the entrance of their
texts into the great Solar collections (cf. Excursus XXVII), with the
result that there was a redaction continually going on, in which not
only was the name of Osiris introduced into the collections, especially
as an epithet of the king, such as Osiris Teti, but also the name of the
solar king was introduced into original Osirian texts. However, the
great bulk of the texts remained solar and celestial with comparatively
little trace of the underworld

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

character of the Osirian faith. There are also traces in these texts of
other systems of theological thought than the Heliopolitan and Osirian,
namely, those of Memphis and Hermopolis.

As one reads these ancient texts, there is a primitiveness about them
which is not unexpected, though they are never naive. There is much
repetition, not much order, contradictions, errors, and sometimes what
appear to be ridiculous statements, but in spite of all that, real
poetic passages and consistent reasoning are not lacking. There is the
art to create images, figures of speech, and metaphores in beautiful and
choice language. There are paronomasiae, parallelisms, litanies, and
hymns. There are poetic expressions, such as 567a-c; real lyrics, like
Ut. 362; symbolical expressions, such as 681d; and really fine bits,
like 307a-c. There are proverbs, such as 396d; and adages, such as 444e.
The most symmetrically and mechanically arranged utterance in the whole
collection is Ut. 575, which reminds one of Ps. 119. But the overall
characteristic of these texts is their religious and funerary, their
magical, mythological, and astronomic expressions, interpretations, and
predispositions.

Auguste Mariette had the distinction, in the later part of his life, of
being the modern discoverer of the inscribed pyramids at Saḳḳâreh,, but
it was Maspero in 1880 working under Mariette's direction, who
discovered the first set of Pyramid Texts. They were those inscribed on
the walls of the sarcophagus chamber of the pyramid of Pepi I. Following
that, he found texts in the pyramids of Unis of the Fifth Dynasty, as
well as in the pyramids of Teti, Merenrē‘, and Pepi II, in addition to
Pepi I, all of the Sixth Dynasty. This work of discovery of pyramid
texts did not find a continuation until the years 1920 and 1936, when
the Swiss Egyptologist, Jéquier, discovered texts in the pyramids of
Oudjebten, Neit, and Apouit, queens of Pepi II, and in that of Ibi, an
obscure king of the Seventh Dynasty, besides clearing that of Pepi II,
whom Sethe records as N. (Neferkarē‘).

These texts usually occupy the walls of the sarcophagus chamber except
the west side, and are so disposed that the deceased king in his
sarcophagus might spiritually see and read them. Texts are also on the
walls of the antechamber, on the horizontal passages, and some are on
the walls of the vestibule and even on those of the ramp. They are
normally in vertical columns, incised on the limestone walls, some
excellently done as in the pyramids of Unis and Pepi II, others very
crudely done as in that of Ibi.

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

As Maspero was the discoverer of the Pyramid Texts, so be was the first
to make an edition and translation of them. These were all the pyramid
texts which were known at the time of their publication in 1894. And in
view of what we now know about the difficulties of the Pyramid Texts,
this edition and translation were evidence of the genius of the great
master. Even today many of his translations accord with the best that is
known on those passages, which is an indication of his great learning
and insight.

For years before the beginning of this century Kurt Sethe, whose name
will be forever associated with the Pyramid Texts, was deeply interested
in everything which concerned them. He as well as other trained
Egyptologists realized that the earlier copy of the texts was often
incorrect, and that a new and scientifically copied edition was a
necessity. Accordingly, taking advantage of the work of Dr. Heintze and
Ludwig Borchardt, who were in Egypt taking impressions and photographs
of the Pyramid Texts for slips in preparation for the making of the
great Berlin *Wörterbuch der Aegyptischen Sprache*, Sethe made use of
their material in preparing a new edition of the Pyramid Texts. And no
Egyptologist was more thoroughly prepared for such an undertaking than
Kurt Sethe. And so he began the critical and exacting task of
constructing a text principally on the basis of the five versions Unis,
Teti, Pepi I, Merenrē‘, and Pepi II, which was finished and published in
1908-1910 in two great quarto volumes of over a thousand pages of
hieroglyphic text, which is now the standard text. To accompany the
text, he followed them with a third volume of critical apparatus in 1922
and a fourth of epigraphy in the same year. Thus the great work of
giving to the world the text of the oldest collection of mythical,
religious, and literary material in existence was finished. However, the
text was marred by one blemish, but not due to the science of Sethe. It
was due to the fact that a considerable Portion of the texts in the five
pyramids was broken, damaged and destroyed--a condition which may never
be completely remedied. It is along this line that Egyptologists who
were specialists in these texts have been working since the time of
Sethe. Already considerable progress has been made in the discovery of
texts, anciently copied from the texts in these five pyramids, before
they were damaged, and recorded elsewhere; in a further study of the
walls of the five pyramids themselves; and in the discovery and
publishing of new pyramids and tombs with parallel and additional texts,
all which will be used in the future, but not till after many years of
archaeological research

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

in Egypt, in the construction of a more complete text. Already between
1920 and 1936 Jéquier discovered at Saḳḳâreh similar texts in the
pyramids of Oudjebten, Neit, and Apouit of the Sixth Dynasty and of Ibi
of the Seventh Dynasty; in 1932 the Egyptian Expedition of the
Metropolitan Museum of Art discovered in the cemetery surrounding the
pyramid of Se’n-Wosret I at Lisht the tomb of an official of the Twelfth
Dynasty named Se’n-Wosret-‘Ankh, containing a long series of
inscriptions drawn from the Pyramid Texts, and published in 1937; and in
1935 William C. Hayes published the "Royal Sarcophagi of the Eighteenth
Dynasty," containing parts of the Pyramid Texts, which are useful in
filling some lacunae in the Saḳḳâreh texts. Then older publications are
useful, such as that of de Morgan in 1894-1895 of similar texts in a
private tomb at Dahshûr; that of Firth and Gunn in 1926 of texts in the
Teti Pyramid Cemeteries at Saḳḳâreh; and that of Borchardt in 1913 of
similar texts in the mortuary temple of Sahurē‘ at Abuṣîr. Then there
are the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom and the Theban Book of the
Dead of the New Kingdom, which contain Pyramid Texts in modified and
further modified form; as well as tombs of kings, such as that of Seti
I, and of private individuals, which contain Pyramid Texts sometimes in
quite exact quotation. All these and others may be drawn upon in the
future construction of a still more perfect version of the famous
ancient Pyramid Texts of Saḳḳâreh. Quite recently T. G. Allen of the
University of Chicago has published a most useful guide to all parallel
and illustrative Egyptian texts at present known in his valuable book,
*Occurrences of Pyramid Texts with cross Indexes of these and other
Egyptian Mortuary Texts*, Chicago, 1950.

After the publication of his text, Sethe's next concern was to prepare a
translation with a commentary. The central thought in his busy years of
research as soon as the text was published was directed towards that
purpose, and by 1929 he was ready to begin. He was master of an immense
accumulation of philological, historical, and religious facts in the
field of ancient Egyptian literature, and with him were associated
co-workers and colleagues, such as Lange, Grapow, and Sander-Hansen. He
began with Ut. 2 13 and by the time of his death in 1934 had finished up
to and including Ut. 506, or less than one half of the text as he had
published it. It remained for a commission of his associates to carry on
the work. This they began to do immediately after the great master's
death.

Sethe's translation and commentary on Uts. 213-506 was not ready

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

for the printer. It needed revising, especially in the later portions,
and writing. The Commission received the material left by Sethe and
published it much as it was. Before the beginning of the war in 1939
four volumes of translation and commentary were published, which
included Uts. 213-506, or between one-third and one-half of the whole. A
fifth volume is said to be in preparation.

Not counting the early and tentative translation by Maspero in 1894,
Sethe's is the only translation--itself only between one-third and
one-half of the whole--in any language of the Pyramid Texts, except one
made in French by L. Speleers, a Belgian Egyptologist in 1923-1924,
remade in 1934, but without a commentary. No translation in any other
language has so far been published. Individual scholars have translated
portions here and there for their use in works on various aspects of
ancient Egyptian religion and thought, philology and literature, customs
and history, such as Kees, Junker, Drioton, Weill, Breasted, Gardiner,
Gunn, Sander-Hansen, etc.

The present translation is thus, the only complete one with full
commentary in any language. It is not as full as that part of Sethe's
which is finished, but it has been planned to be more concise in its
comments, leaving longer comments on important points for a series of
Excursuses, so as not to interfere with the proportioned flow of comment
on the current text. But it has been able to make use of large portions
of the pyramids of Pepi II and Neit as well as of publications of other
pyramids, tombs, and sarcophagi brought to light since Sethe's day. It
has thus added over four hundred lines to the text, besides, filling
some smaller lacunae here and there.

It is not claimed to be a definitive translation, because we have not
yet a definitive text. Such a text and translation may never be able to
be made, because of quite natural causes. But with the further discovery
of new texts and a complete comparison with all extant later parallels
in texts already published as well as yet unpublished a future text and
translation will be called for. For that reason, in this present
translation use has been made of material later than the time of the
Pyramid Texts themselves only when it was thought to have some light to
throw upon a problem difficult of solution, or when it gave a new
meaning to a passage. In other words, this is an interim translation and
commentary of the Pyramid Texts for the use not only of Egyptologists
but likewise of students of religions and comparative religions, of
literature and comparative literature, of the history of ideas and
customs, and of culture and civilization in general.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

\[paragraph continues\] There is published with it a complete apparatus
for general use such as an analysis of each utterance with a discussion
of its date, a series of Excursuses on important subjects, a full
glossary of useful terms, phrases, and subjects, and a full index to the
translation.

In translating and interpreting these texts many things have had to be
taken into consideration and many allowances have had to be made. It
must he remembered that many of these old utterances or discourses are
veritable magic formulae to procure for the deceased king all kinds of
material satisfaction, to protect him against any enemies he may meet on
his way to the other world, and to procure for him an eternal life; and
that very often place names refer to celestial locations and not to
ancient places in Egypt. In keeping with their general magical
character, most if not all of these utterances begin with the expression
*<u>d</u>d mdw*, which is a rubrical direction "to say," that is, the
words are to be spoken or recited by someone, often a lector-priest,
sometimes the deceased king himself, and sometimes by him in the first
person. The rubric sometimes directs that the petition be repeated four
times. There is evidence that some of the utterances were written in the
first person singular, and were later changed to the third person
singular. Ut. 506 is a good example of a text which was surely in the
first person singular originally, but in general in translations the
third person has been used unless the form of the first person has been
reproduced in the hieroglyphic text. It has been useful to notice when
the first person is used, for it is one of the signs of an early date
for the text in which it is found, for example, Uts. 325 and 563 are
late, and one of the indications is that the third person singular is
always used. On the whole, the determination of the date of a text is
rather uncertain, and sometimes impossible. There can be no systematic
ordering of the dates as J. E. D. P. of Old Testament criticism. Nor is
n, the sign of the genitive, a sure guide of date, its presence
indicating a late and its absence an early date, as the occurrence and
the absence of the n in the same sentence or compound sentence proves,
Cf. 2056c.

Among the texts of the Saḳḳâreh pyramids there is evidence of redaction
of some of them, thus, Ut. 55 is a re-writing for kings of the historic
period of an older text, composed for the predynastic kings of Buto; and
some long utterances are made up of independent short parts, with some
changes added by the redactor, e.g. Ut. 468. Indeed the Pyramid Texts
are to a large extent a composition, compiling, and joining of earlier
texts. Moreover, there are corruptions

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

in the texts, mistakes in writing, errors in grammar and syntax,
contradictions and confusions, expressions which seem ridiculous, and
illogical expressions, most of which have been referred to in the
Commentary on the text where they occur. There are numerous paronomasiae
and words of double meaning; and superstition led to the mutilation of
hieroglyphic signs of creatures which were thought, if left whole, may
be capable of injuring the deceased king, and the fish for the same
reason was used only once (218c, N.) in the inscriptions in his burial
chamber.

As there is a minimum of classification and order in the sequence of the
texts, a list of Contents of the Pyramid Texts precedes this
Introduction. Therein an attempt has been made to find groups of texts
without disturbing the sequence of the text in Sethe's edition.
Consequently it often happens that we are obliged to group some texts
under the heading "Texts of Miscellaneous Contents." However, there are
many instances where texts grouped in Sethe's edition form a natural and
often perfect group, e.g. the Serpent Charms of Uts. 226-244, or the
Ferryman Texts, Uts. 300-337.

In translations an honest effort has been made to express the sense of
the original in English, with the result that many translations are
literal instead of free, thus in 1004d the original is translated "at
the voice of lamentation" instead of "at the sound of lamentation," so
that the English will be apt to be stilted instead of elegant. As in all
ancient languages, particles, such as adverbs, and conjunctions are
rare, with the result that it is often not easy to make the correct
sequence or dependence, rendering the sense of the sentence or passage
uncertain. Again the same word in different contexts may require varied
renderings, such as the word *ȝgb* which means "flood," "abundance," or
"violence," in accordance with the context. To save as much space as
possible, very few alternative translations have been introduced, where
in many cases the same phrase or sentence could be rendered in different
ways. In most lines of the Pyramid Texts the line as it appears in two
or more pyramids is given; in other words, in Sethe's edition every line
is given in as many pyramids as it occurs; so as a rule the earliest
text is the one followed in translating the line unless one of the other
pyramids has decidedly the best text. Where important differences occur,
they are pointed out in the commentary; but where differences are not
helpful in interpretation they are not always noted. Nor are variants in
other texts not in the Sethe edition referred to unless they are useful
in a better understanding of the meaning

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

of the text. Whenever "to say" occurs if in only one of the parallel
pyramids, it is used in the translation. In the Commentary on Uts.
213-506, Sethe's discussions were ever before me, and I felt myself
constrained by his logic and learning to follow him, but wherever I felt
that another solution to a problem of interpretation was better though
different from his I have not hesitated to use it. In other words, in
those utterances, Sethe became my standard unless I could improve on it,
as I often did, I believe, in the light of additional Nt. or N. texts,
or still later texts, or comparative literature or religion. In all my
comments, I have felt free to draw upon any sources, especially ancient
ones, whenever I felt the need of an illustrative idea or custom. But I
have been unable to take advantage of some of the new points made by my
colleagues in their Excursuses, due to a difference of date in the
completion of the earlier parts of this work and the arrival of their
manuscript. At the same time, obvious remarks have been avoided as much
as possible, and only important differences and similarities between
lines, paragraphs, and utterances have been noted. Minor errors, whether
in the original hieroglyphics, or in Sethe's text, are not always noted,
neither are the presence or absence of an *’i* prosthetic, or a
genitival *n* always mentioned, nor has the analysis of the utterances
been too meticulous in unessential matters, for as the German proverb
has it:

"Wer auf jede Feder acht,  
Nie das Bette fertig macht."

The abbreviations of the pyramids in which texts so far have been found
are: W. = Unis, T. = Teti, P. = Pepi I, M. = Merenrē‘, N. = Pepi II
(Neferkarē‘), Nt. = Neit, Ip. = Apouit, Wd. = Oudjebten, Ib. = Aba, Se’n
= Se’n-Wosret-‘Ankh. In the translations of the texts of these pyramids,
instead of using the different abbreviations for the different
sovereigns, the letter N. (nomen) is used throughout. Other
abbreviations may be seen in the "List of Abbreviations" of literature.
The square brackets \[ \] are used to designate a conjecture made by
Sethe, or by me, which has not with satisfaction been textually
verified; the round brackets ( ) are used for explanatory words or
phrases or for alternative translations. Capitalization is used as
sparingly as possible in the translation and commentary, but when common
nouns referring to things are personified, or deified, or both, they are
written with a capital letter; but punctuation marks are used somewhat
excessively, especially

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

where they aid the meaning. I have always made a slight departure from
the orthodox method of transliterating hieroglyphics, in the interest of
simplicity, in that I have used the accepted *’i* when it is initial,
but *i* otherwise; and I use the grammatical word "gentilic" instead of
the word "nisbé." In case of the two words usually translated, the first
"soul" and the other "double," I use the transliterated forms *bȝ* and
*kȝ*, or *ba* and *ka*, to avoid misunderstanding in the supposed
English equivalents. In the case of the plural of *ka*, I use the form
*ka's* or *kas*, which others also use. Any differences in the
transliteration of words, in abbreviations, and in modes of reference,
etc., in the Excursuses of authors other than myself are ordinarily
retained. In broken passages, the approximate length of the broken line
is indicated by ------------

The Excursuses are meant to treat subjects ordinarily too large for the
Commentary, but the discussion is confined to the Pyramid Texts, except
for parallel and illustrative matter. The Glossary is meant to give a
brief description or definition of important words, names, phrases, and
subjects which occur in the Translation and Commentary, with as a rule
only one reference, usually the most important one. Other references may
be found in the Commentary, in the Index, or in Speleers' excellent
Vocabulary. The List of Abbreviations applies to the chief works
actually used in this book; and the Index which follows is that to the
Translation alone, but which naturally serves the Commentary as well. On
account of the lack of hieroglyphic type only a few hieroglyphs,
considered essential in the comments, have been used, and are collected
together on three plates at the end of the work, but referred to in the
Commentary by plate and number. With a few exceptions of names of a
general character, only those found in the Translation and Commentary
are entered in the map, which appears at the end of the last volume.

As noted above, the only scientific edition of the hieroglyphic texts of
the inscribed pyramids was made by Sethe in 1908-1910. The texts form a
collection of 714 utterances or chapters, and although most of the
utterances occur in more than one pyramid and very few are repeated in
all the pyramids in which the texts are found, many of them are damaged
and incomplete wherever they are found in the texts published by Sethe.
However, since the time of Sethe's publication similar texts have been
found in other pyramids at Saḳḳâreh of the Sixth and Seventh Dynasties
as well as in private tombs of the Middle Kingdom, and which have been
published, and are specified

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

above. A study of these additional texts has made it possible for me to
add in translation 386 lines to the approximately 6500 lines in Sethe's
hieroglyphic edition, and to make 57 larger restorations, besides many
smaller ones, amounting to about 40 additional lines, making in all an
addition of about 426 lines, in translation, to Sethe's original
edition. The confirmation from texts not available to Sethe of his
restorations are not recorded in these lists, but they are given in the
Commentary (e.g. that in 130, while emendations and restorations as well
as all substantial additions are mentioned in the comments on the lines
where they occur. Therefore, for convenience of reference to the
published hieroglyphic texts, there follow here two lists, the *first* a
list of the *added lines*, and the *second* a list of the *larger
restorations*. The additions as well as the restorations, larger and
smaller, are also recorded, at their appropriate places in the
Commentary:

few changes in the numbering of lines and utterances have had to be
made, a list of which follows:
