The Pyramid Texts were funerary inscriptions that were written on the
walls of the early Ancient Egyptian pyramids at Sakkara. These date back
to the fifth and sixth dynasties, approximately the years 2350-2175
B.C.E. However, because of extensive internal evidence, it is believed
that they were composed much earlier, circa 3000 B.C.E. The Pyramid
Texts are, therefore, essentially the oldest sacred texts known.

Samuel Mercer was the first to produce a complete English translation of
this mysterious text, in 1952. This was also the first complete
translation in any language. The Mercer translation was followed by the
R.O. Faulkner translation in 1969, which is considered the standard
today. However, this does not diminish the usefulness of Mercer's
version, particularly because it has fallen into the public domain and
is now available freely online here at Intangible Textual Heritage, the
first complete version of the Pyramid Texts on the Internet.

PRODUCTION NOTES: The four volume edition from which this was scanned is
today very rare and sells for upwards of $800 on the used market. This
etext is the complete text of volume one of this set, and includes the
complete Mercer translation of the Pyramid Texts. Volumes 2-4 are
commentary by Mercer and others. I do not currently plan to scan the
remaining volumes.

I believe that this work is in the public domain in the United States.
It will not be in the public domain in the UK or EU until 2022. Here are
the facts. Mercer, a Canadian by birth, published this work in 1952. It
was published simultaneously in the United States and Canada. Samuel
Mercer died on January 12, 1969 at the age of 89. By US copyright law at
the time, the copyright should have been registered at the US copyright
office in 1952 and renewed in 1980. However there is no evidence that
this is the case, based on an extensive search of the online US
Copyright Office database. The GATT restoral of 1/1/1996 restored
copyrights on foreign works which were not registered properly in the
US; however, this does not apply to works simultaneously published in
the US and abroad.
