<p>134a. O N., thou didst not depart dead; thou didst depart living,</p>

<p>134b. (so) thou sittest upon the throne of Osiris, thy <i>&#145;b&#541;</i>-sceptre in thy hand, thou commandest the living;</p>

<p>134c. (thy) <i>mk&#347;</i>-sceptre and thy <i>n&#7717;b.t</i>-sceptre in thy hand, commanding

heaven,</p>

<p>137c. that thou mayest be at the side of the god; that thou mayest leave thy
house to thy son</p>

<p>137d. who is thine heir. Everyone who speaks, evil against the name of N.,</p>

<p>138a. when he ascends, Geb reckons him as an evil-doer in his own city,</p>

<p>138b. so that he weakens, he falters. Thou purifiest thyself in the dew of
the stars;</p>

his name of "He who is in the <i>&#7716;nw</i>-boat."</p>

<p>140c. Atum, let him ascend to thee; enfold him in thine embrace,</p>

<p>141a. (for) there is no god, (who has become) a star, who has not his
companion. Shall I be thy companion?</p>

<p>146. Look (at me); thou hast regarded the form of the children of their
fathers,</p>

belongest to him wilt not go to ruin.</p>

<p>145b. R&#275;&#145;-Atum does not surrender thee to Osiris. He judges (lit. numbers)
not thy heart; he gains not power over thy heart.</p>
