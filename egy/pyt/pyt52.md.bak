*Utterance 659*.

1860a. To say: He is assembled: This thy going;

1860b. He is assembled: These thy goings,

1860c. are the goings of Horus in search of his father, Osiris.

1861a. His messengers go; his runners hasten,

1861b. his envoys rush on.

1862a. Hasten to Rē‘; say to Rē, to him who lifts up his arm in the
East,

1862b. that he is coming as a god, that N. stands in the double
*’itr.t*-palace of the horizon.

1863a. Thou hearest the words of Rē‘, as a god, as Horus *mśti*:

1863b. "I am thy brother, like Sopdu."

arms--

1865b. thy putrefaction being avoided-

1865c. like thy calf, like thy herdsman.

1866a. Thou hast taken these thy white teeth of this *mḥn*;

1866b. they go around like an arrow, in their name of "Arrow;"

1867a. thy leg of beef is in the nome of Abydos, thy (lit. his) piece of
meat is in the land of Nubia;

1867b. thou hast descended like the jackal of the South, like Anubis who
is over (i.e. protects) the (southern) *’itr.t*-palace;

1868a. thou standest before the *Rd-wr*-lake,

1868b. like Geb, at the head of his Ennead.

1869a. Thou hast thy heart; thou hast thy *ka*, N.;

1869b. thou furnishest thy house, N.; thou fastenest thy door, N.
