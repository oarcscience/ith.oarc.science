### 34. NEW-BIRTH OF THE DECEASED KING AS A GOD IN HEAVEN, UTTERANCE 570.

*Utterance 570*.

1443a. To say: The face of heaven is washed; the vault of heaven is
bright;

1443b. a god is brought to birth by the sky upon the arms of Shu and
Tefnut, upon the arms of N.

1444a. "Great *wbn*," say the gods;

1444b. "hear it, this word which N. says to thee;

1444c. let thy heart be glad for this N., for this N. is a Great One,
the son of a Great One;

1444d. N. is with thee; take this N. for life, joy, and eternity, with
thee."

1445a. "Khepri, hear it, this word, which is spoken to thee by N.;

1445b. let thy heart be glad for N., for N. is a Great One, the son of a
Great One;

1445c. N. is with thee; take him with thee."

1446a. "Nun, hear it, this word, which is spoken to thee by N.;

1446b. let thy heart be glad for N., for N. is a Great One, the son of a
Great One;

1446c. N. is with thee; take him with thee."

1447a. "Atum, hear it, this word, which is spoken to thee by N.;

1447b. let thy heart be glad for N., for N. is a Great One, the son of a
Great One;

1447c. N. is with thee; take him with thee."

1448a. "*Wȝš*, son of Geb; *Śḫm*, son of Osiris,

1448b. hear it, this word is spoken to thee by N.;

1448c. let thy heart be glad for N., for N. is a Great One, the son of a
Great One;

1448d. N. is with thee; take him with thee."

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

1449a. Mayest thou be near to N., in thy name of "Rē‘"; drive thou away
the garments (darkness) of the sky.

1449b. May Horus of the Horizon cause him to hear his glory and his
praise

1449c. out of the mouth of the Two Enneads.

1450a. "How beautiful art thou," said his mother; "(mine) heir," said
Osiris.

1450b. N. has not swallowed the eye of Horus,

1450c. so that men might say, "he will die for that."

1450d. N. has not swallowed a limb of Osiris,

1450e. so that the gods might say, "he will die for that."

1451a. N. lives on the *’isnw* (bread of offering) of his father Atum;
protect him, *Nḫb.t*;

1451b. thou hast protected N., *Nḫb.t*, in the princely house which is
in Heliopolis.

1452a. Thou hast commended him to him who is within his *ḥn.ti* (two
limits),

1452b. that N. may be expedited.

1452c. He who is within his *ḥn.ti* (two limits) has recommended N. to
him who is on his carrying litter,

1452d. that N. may be expedited.

1453a. N. has escaped his day of death,

1453b. even as Set escaped his day of death;

1453c. N. has escaped the half-months of death,

1453d. even as Set escaped his half-months of death;

1453e. N. has escaped his months of death,

1453f. even as Set escaped his months of death;

14539\. N. has escaped the year of death,

1453h. even as Set escaped his year of death,

1454a. by ploughing the earth. The hands of N. support Nut, like Shu,

1454b. even the bones of N. which are firm (or, iron; or, copper), and
his imperishable limbs;

1455a. for N. is a star, the light-scatterer of the sky.

1455b. Let N. ascend to the god; let N. be avenged,

1455c. so that heaven may not be void of N., so that earth (lit. this
land, i.e. Egypt) may not be void of N., for ever.

1456a. N. lives a life in accordance with your rule,

1456b. O gods of the lower sky, imperishable stars,

1456c. which traverse the land of Libya, which are supported by their

*<u>d</u>‘m*-sceptre.

1457b. O gods of the lower sky, imperishable stars,

1457c. which traverse the land of Libya, which are supported by their

1457d. just as N. is supported, with you, by a *wȝś*-sceptre and a
*<u>d</u>‘m*-sceptre.

1458a. N. is your fourth,

1458b. O gods of the lower sky, imperishable stars,

11458c. which traverse the land of Libya, which are supported by their
d'm-sceptres;

1458d. just as N. is supported, with you, by a *wȝś*-sceptre and a
*<u>d</u>‘m*-sceptre,

1458e. by command of Horus, hereditary prince and king of the gods.

1459a. N. seizes the white crown; that upon which is the wire of the
green crown.

11459b. N. is the *’i‘r.t*-serpent, which comes forth from Set, which

1460a. N. is this (kind of) colour which comes out of Nun.

1460b. N. is the eye of Horus, which was not chewed, nor spit out;

1460c. he is not chewed nor spit out.

1461a. Hear it, this word, O Rē‘, said by N. to thee:

1461b. "Thy body is in N., O Rē‘; let thy body live in N., O Rē‘."

11462a. "The baboon is a wild-ox," so said *knm.wt*;

1462b. "*knm.w*t is a wild-ox," so said the baboon.

11462c. O that castrated one! O this man! O he who hurries him who
hurries (?), among you two!

11462d. These-this first corporation of the company of the justified

11463a. was born before there was any anger;

11463b. was born before there was any clamour (lit. voice);

1463c. was born before there was any strife.,

11463d. was born before there was any conflict;

1463e. was born before the eye of Horus was plucked out; before the
testicles of Set were torn away.

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

1464a. N. is blood' which came from Isis; N. is red blood which came
from Nephthys.

1464b. N. does *<u>d</u>ḥ‘w3* against his *bnw*; there is nothing which
the gods can do against N.;

1464c. N. is the deputy of Rē‘; N. shall not die.

1465a. Hear, O Geb, hereditary prince of all the gods, endue him with
his form.

1465b. Hear, O Thot, who art among the peaceful ones of the gods,

1465c. let a door for N. be opened by Horus; let N. be protected by Set.

1465d. N. appears in the eastern side of the sky,

1465e. like Rē‘ who shines in the eastern side of the sky.
