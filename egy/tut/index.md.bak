This is a collection of essays and translations by E.A.W. Budge about
the 18th dynasty of Ancient Egypt, particularly Amenhotep IV, who
attempted to impose a monotheistic religion on the Egyptians, and
Tutankhamen, who led a counter-reformation. This slim book appears to
have been pieced together from existing material, shortly after the
sensational discovery of Tutankhamen's intact tomb.

If you are looking for a lengthy biography of 'King Tut', or an
inventory of the riches of his tomb you will be disappointed. Most of
this book is about Amenhotep IV, particularly his abortive attempt to
negate thousands of years of Egyptian polythesism, and replace it with a
monotheistic religion. This is a fascinating subject for students of the
history of religion, and Budge offers a set of key source documents on
the topic, as well as some insightful analysis.
