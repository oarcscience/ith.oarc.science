# A HYMN TO AMEN AND ATEN

###### BY

HER AND SUTI, OVERSEERS OF WORKS AT THEBES, IN THE REIGN OF AMENHETEP
III

\[British Museum Stele No. 475-9 <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md)\]

1\. A Hymn of Praise to Amen when he riseth as Horus of the Two Horizons
by Suti, the, Overseer of the Works of Amen, \[and by\] <u>H</u>er
(Horus), the Overseer of the Works of Amen. They say:--Homage to thee,
Ra, Beautiful (or Beneficent) One of every day! Thou shootest up

2\. at sunrise (or dawn) without fail, <span
id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md) Khepera, <span
id="fr_27"></span>[3](#fn_27.md)

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

great one of works. Thy radiance is in thy face, \[thou\] Unknown. \[As
for\] shining metal <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) it doth not
resemble thy splendours.

3\. Being designed <span id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md) thou didst mould
into form thy members; giving birth, but he was not born; One by himself
by reason of his power or abilities), Traverser of Eternity, He who is
over (or Chief of) the ways of millions of years, maintaining his Divine
Form.

4\. As are the beauties of the celestial regions even so are thy
beauties. More brilliant is thy complexion than that of heaven. Thou
sailest across the heavens, all faces (*i.e.*, mankind) look at thee as
thou goest, though thou thyself art hidden from their faces.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

5\. Thou showest thyself at break of day in beams of light, strong is
thy Seqet Boat under Thy Majesty. In a little day thou journeyest over a
road of millions and hundreds of thousands

6\. of minutes (or moments). Thy (?) day with thee passeth, \[thou\]
settest.

The hours of the night likewise thou dost make to fulfil themselves. No
interruption taketh place in thy toil. All eyes (i.e., mankind, or all
peoples)

7\. direct their gaze upon thee, they cease not to do so. When Thy
Majesty setteth, thou makest haste (?) to rise up early in the
morning, <span id="fr_30"></span>[1](#fn_30.md) thy sparkling rays flash in
the eyes (or penetrate the eyes).

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

8\. Thou settest in Manu, whereupon \[men\] sleep after the manner of
the dead.

Hail to thee, O ATEN of the day, thou Creator of mortals \[and\] Maker
of their life (i.e., that on which they live)! \[Hail\]

9\. thou Great Hawk whose feathers are many-coloured, thou god Kheprer,
who didst raise thyself up \[from non-existence\]! He created himself,
he was not born, Horus the Elder (or the Old Hawk), dweller in Nut (the
sky). \[Men\] cry out joyfully at

10\. his rising \[and\] at his setting likewise. \[He is\] the fashioner
\[of what\] the ground produceth, Khnem Amen of the Henmemet, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) conqueror of the Two Lands, from the great
one to the little one. \[Thou\] Mother splendid of

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

11\. Gods and men, artificer, gracious one, exceedingly great,
progressing (or flourishing) in her work. The cattle (?) cannot be
counted. The strong herdsman, driving his strong beasts, thou art their
byre. He

12\. provideth their life (*i.e.*, sustenance), springing up, traversing
the course (?) of Khepera, planning (?) his birth, raising up his
beautiful \[form\] in the womb of Nut. He illumineth the Two Lands
(Egypt) with his Aten (or Disk), \[he is\] the primeval substance (or
plasma) of the Two Lands. He made himself.

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

13\. He looketh on what he hath made, the Lord ONE, bringing along into
captivity countless lands every day, observing those who walk about upon
the earth; shining (or shooting up) in the sky \[he performeth\]
transformations by day (or, as Ra). He maketh the seasons from the
months. He loveth the heat of summer.

14\. He loveth the cold of winter. He maketh every member of the body to
droop. He embraceth every land. The ape\[s cry out\] in adoration of him
when he riseth daily.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

15\. Suti, overseer of works, \[and\] <u>H</u>er, overseer of works,
\[each\] saith, "I was the director of thy throne \[and\] overseer of
works in thy sanctuary \[which\], as was right thy beloved son, the Lord
of the Two Lands, Nebmaatra, the giver of life, made for thee. My Lord
appointed me to be the officer in charge of thy monuments.

16\. I kept watch diligently, I served the office of director of thy
monuments strenuously, performing the laws of thy heart. I knew how to
make thee to rest upon Truth, making thee great to do it upon the earth.

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

17\. I was performing it \[and\] thou didst make me great. Thou didst
set the favours \[or praises\] of me on the earth in the Apts (Karnak).
I was among thy followers when thou didst ascend the throne. I am truth
who abominateth false words and deeds.

18\. I never took pleasure in any conversation wherein were words of
exaggeration and lies. My brother was like myself. I took pleasure in
his affairs; he came forth from the womb with me on this (*i.e.*, the
same) day.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

19\. Suti, the overseer of the works of Amen in the Southern Apt
(*i.e.*, Luxor), and Her \[the overseer of works\], say:--I was director
over the western side, and he was director over the eastern side; we two
were directors of the great monuments

20\. in the Apt, more particularly those of Thebes, the City of Amen.
Grant thou to me an old age in thy city, and in thy beneficence make me
a burial in Amentt, that place of rest of heart.

21\. Let me be placed among thy favoured ones, departing in peace. Grant
thou to me sweet air when . . . . \[and\] the wearing (or bearing) of
bandlets on the day of the festival of Ug.

not cessation."

<span id="fn_27"></span>[46:3](tut06.htm#fr_27.md) Or "Creator." Here Amen
is identified with the ancient god of Creation.

didst design thine own form."

<span id="fn_30"></span>[48:1](tut06.htm#fr_30.md) The text is probably
