# PREFACE.

The Papyrus of Ani, which was acquired by the Trustees of the British
Museum in the year 1888, is the largest, the most perfect, the best
preserved, and the best illuminated of all the papyri which date from
the second half of the XVIIIth dynasty (about B.C. 1500 to 1400). Its
rare vignettes, and hymns, and chapters, and its descriptive and
introductory rubrics render it of unique importance for the study of the
Book of the Dead, and it takes a high place among the authoritative
texts of the Theban version of that remarkable work. Although it
contains less than one-half of the chapters which are commonly assigned
to that version, we may conclude that Ani's exalted official position as
Chancellor of the ecclesiastical revenues and endowments of Abydos and
Thebes would have ensured a selection of such chapters as would suffice
for his spiritual welfare in the future life. We may therefore regard
the Papyrus of Ani as typical of the funeral book in vogue among the
Theban nobles of his time.

The first edition of the Facsimile of the Papyrus was issued in 1890,
and was accompanied by a valuable Introduction by Mr. Le Page Renouf,
then Keeper of the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities. But,
in order to satisfy a widely expressed demand for a translation of the
text, the present volume has been prepared to be issued with the second
edition of the Facsimile. It contains the hieroglyphic text of the
Papyrus with interlinear transliteration and word for word translation,
a full description of the vignettes, and a running translation; and in
the Introduction an attempt has been made to illustrate from native

{p. vi}

Egyptian sources the religious views of the wonderful people who more
than five thousand years ago proclaimed the resurrection of a spiritual
body and the immortality of the soul.

The passages which supply omissions, and vignettes which contain
important variations either in subject matter or arrangement, as well as
supplementary texts which appear in the appendixes, have been, as far as
possible, drawn from other contemporary papyri in the British Museum.

The second edition of the Facsimile has been executed by Mr. F. C.
Price.
