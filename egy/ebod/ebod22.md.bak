# PLATE XV.

Vignette: A seated statue of Ani, the scribe, upon which the ceremony of
opening the mouth"\[4\] *un re*, is being performed by the *sem*\[5\]
priest, clad in a panther's skin and holding in his right hand the
instrument *Ur heka*\[6\] *i.e.*, "mighty one of enchantments." In front
of the statue are: the

Text \[CHAPTER XXIII.\]: (I) THE CHAPTER OF OPENING THE MOUTH OF OSIRIS,
THE SCRIBE ANI. To be said:\[2\] "May Ptah open my mouth, and may the
god of my town\[3\] loose the swathings, even the swathings\[4\] which
are over my mouth (2). Moreover, may Thoth, being filled and furnished
with charms, come and loose the bandages, the bandages of Set which
fetter my mouth (3); and may the god Tmu hurl them' at those who would
fetter \[me\] with them, and drive them back. May my mouth be opened,
may my mouth be unclosed by Shu\[6\] (4) with his iron\[7\] knife,
wherewith he opened the mouth of the gods. I am Sekhet,\[8\] and I sit
upon the great western side of heaven. (5) 1 am the great goddess
Sah\[9\] among the souls of Annu. Now as concerning every charm and all
the words which may be spoken against me (6), may the gods resist them,
and may each and every one of the company of the gods withstand it
them."\[10\]

Text \[CHAPTER XXIV.\]: (I) THE CHAPTER OF BRINGING CHARMS UNTO OSIRIS
ANI \[IN NETER-KHERT\]. \[He saith\]: "I am Tmu\[11\]-Khepera, who gave
birth unto himself upon the thigh of his divine mother.\[12\] Those who
are in Nu\[13\]are made wolves, and those who are among the godlike
rulers (3) are become

and fleeter than light. (4) Hail thou who towest along the *makhent*
boat of Ra, the stays of thy sails and of thy rudder are taut in the
wind as thou sailest over the Lake of Fire in Neter-khert. Behold, thou
gatherest together the charm (5) from every place where it is and from
every man with whom it is, swifter than greyhounds and fleeter than
light, \[the charm\] which createth the forms of existence from the (6)
mother's thigh (?) and createth the gods from (or in) silence, and which
giveth the heat of life unto the gods.\[3\] Behold, the charm is given
unto me from wheresoever it is \[and from him with whom it is\], swifter
than greyhounds and fleeter than light," or, (as others say), " fleeter
than a shadow."

Appendix: The following chapter, which generally appears in other early
copies of the Book of the Dead, is closely connected with the preceding
chapter. It is here taken from the Papyrus of Nebseni.

\(1\) \[CHAPTER XXV.\] THE CHAPTER OF CAUSING THE DECEASED TO REMEMBER
HIS (2) NAME IN NETER-KHERT. \[He saith\]: "May my name be given unto me
in the great Double House, and may I remember my name in the House of
Fire on the (3) night of counting the years and of telling the number of
the months. I am with the Holy One, and I sit on the eastern side of
heaven. If any god advanceth unto me, (4) forthwith I proclaim his
name."

Vignette: The scribe Ani, clothed in white, and with his heart in his
right hand, addressing the god Anubis.\[4\] Between them is a necklace
of several rows of

\[1. Var. *behiu*, an animal which is identified with the *hyaena
croenta* by Hartmann (see Aeg. Zeit., 1864, p. 12, Col. 2).

2\. Reading with the Nebseni papyrus \#\#\#.

3\. Here the text is different from any given by Naville. The chief
variants are \#\#\#, "which createth the gods from (or in) silence, and
which maketh them powerless"; and \#\#\# "which maketh the gods to speak
\[from being\] silent, and which maketh them speechless."

4\. In the vignettes of this chapter published by M. Naville
(*Todtenbuch*, Bd. I., Bl. 38) the deceased is represented: (1) seated,
and addressing his heart, which stands on a support; (2) standing,
holding in his hands a heart, which he offers to three deities. Another
vignette represents a priest tying a heart on to a statue of the
deceased; and in the late recension of the Book of the Dead published by
Lepsius (Bl. 15) the deceased holds a heart to his left side and
addresses a human-headed hawk emblematic of the soul.\]

{p. 308}

coloured beads, the clasp of which is in the shape of a pylon or
gateway, and to which is attached a pectoral bearing a representation of
the boat of the sun, wherein is set a scarab, emblematic of the
Sun.\[1\]

Text \[CHAPTER XXVII: (1) CHAPTER OF GIVING A HEART UNTO OSIRIS ANI (2)
IN THE UNDERWORLD. \[Ani saith\]: "May my heart be with me in the House
of Hearts.\[2\] May my heart be with me, and may it rest in \[me\], or I
shall not eat of the cakes of Osiris on the eastern\[3\] side of the
Lake of Flowers,\[4\] (3) \[neither shall I have\] a boat wherein to go
down the Nile, and another wherein to go up, nor shall I go forward in
the boat with thee. May my mouth be given unto me that I may (4) speak
with it, and my two feet to it walk withal, and my two hands and arms to
overthrow my foe. May the doors of heaven be opened unto me\[5\](5.md); may
Seb, the Prince of the gods, open wide his two jaws unto me; may he open
my two eyes which are blinded; may he cause me to stretch out my (6)
feet which are bound together; and may Anubis make my legs firm that I
may stand upon them. May the goddess Sekhet make me to rise (7) so that
I may ascend unto heaven, and there may that be done which I command in
the House of the *Ka* of Ptah.\[6\] I know my heart, I have gotten the
mastery over (8) my heart, I have gotten the mastery over my two hands
and arms, I have gotten the mastery over my feet, and I have gained the
power to do whatsoever my ka pleaseth. (9) My soul shall not be shut off
from my body at the gates of the underworld; but I shall enter in peace,
and I shall come forth in peace."

*faïence* pectorals inlaid with scarabs is exhibited in the Fourth
Egyptian Room.

Text: \[CHAPTER XXXB.\]. (I) THE CHAPTER\[1\] OF NOT LETTING (2) THE
HEART OF OSIRIS, THE SCRIBE OF THE SACRED OFFERINGS OF ALL THE GODS,
ANI, TRIUMPHANT, BE DRIVEN FROM HIM IN THE UNDERWORLD. Ani saith: "My
heart, my mother; my heart, my mother (3). My heart whereby I come into
being. May there be nothing to withstand me at \[my\] judgment; may
there be no, resistance against me by the Tchatcha; may there be no
parting of thee from me in the presence of him who keepeth the Scales!
Thou art my *ka* within (4) my body, \[which\] knitteth and
strengtheneth my limbs. Mayest thou come forth in the place of happiness
\[to which\] I advance. May the *Shenit*,\[2\] who make men to stand
fast, not cause my name to stink."\[3\]

Vignette: Ani holding his soul in the form of a human-headed bird.

Text: \[CHAPTER LXI.\] (I) CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE SOUL OF A MAN BE
TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM IN THE UNDERWORLD. Osiris the scribe Ani saith: "I,
even I, am he (2) who came forth from the water-flood which I make to
overflow and which becometh mighty as the River \[Nile\]."

Appendix; In many early papyri the text of Chapter LXI. forms part of a
longer composition which M. Naville calls Chapters LXI.,\[4\] LX.,\[5\]
and LXII.,\[6\] and which reads:--

\(1\) CHAPTER OF DRINKING WATER IN THE UNDERWORLD. \[He saith\]: "I,
even I, am he who cometh forth from (2) Seb. The flood hath been given
unto him,

\[1. This chapter is usually accompanied by a vignette. In that in the
papyrus of Nebseni the deceased is being weighed against his own heart;
an ape, "Thoth, lord of the Balance," seated on a pedestal, holds the
tongue of the balance. In British Museum Papyrus No. 9964 the deceased
is also weighed against his own heart, but at the same time a figure of
himself is also watching the process. In the papyrus of Sutimes a square
weight lies in each pan of the scales. Other vignettes have simply a
scarab, or the deceased addressing his heart, which rests on a standard.
See Naville, *Todtenbuch*, Bd. I., Bl. 43.

2\. A class of divine beings.

3\. The chapter as here given is incomplete; the missing words are:
"pleasant for us, pleasant is the hearing, and there is gladness of
heart at the weighing of words. Let not lies be spoken against me near
the god, in the presence of the great god, the lord of Amentet. Verily,
how great shalt thou be when thou risest up in triumph!"

4\. The vignette represents the deceased on his knees embracing his
soul.

5\. Vignette: a man kneeling and holding a lotus.

6\. Vignettes: the deceased scooping water with his hands out of a
tank.\]

and he hath gotten power over it as Hapi. I, even I, open the (3) two
doors of heaven: and the two doors of the watery abyss have been opened
unto me by Thoth and by Hapi, the divine twin sons of heaven, (4) who
are mighty in splendours. O grant ye that I may gain power over the
water, even as Set overcame his foes on the day(?) (5) when he terrified
the world. I have passed by the great ones shoulder against shoulder,
even as they have passed by that great and splendid god who is (6)
provided \[with all things\] and whose name is unknown. I have passed by
the mighty one of the shoulder. (7) The flood of Osiris hath been passed
through by me, and Thoth-Hapi-Tmu, the lord of the horizon, hath opened
unto me the flood in his name, 'Thoth, the cleaver of the earth.' (8) I
have gained power over the water, even as Set gained power over his
foes. I have sailed over heaven. I am Ra. I am the Lion-god. I am the
young bull (9). I have devoured the Thigh, I have seized the flesh. I
have gone round about the streams in Seket-Aru. Boundless eternity hath
been granted unto me, and, behold, (10) I am the heir of eternity; to me
hath been given everlastingness."

Closely connected with the above chapter are the two following short
chapters:--\[1\]

Vignette: The deceased drinking water from a running stream.

Text \[CHAPTER LXIIIA.\]: (I) THE CHAPTER OF DRINKING WATER AND OF NOT
BEING BURNED IN THE FIRE. \[The deceased\] saith: "Hail, Bull of Amenta.
I am brought unto thee, I am the oar of Ra (3) wherewith he ferried over
the aged ones; let me not be buried nor consumed. I am Beb,\[2\] (4) the
first-born son of Osiris, who doth wash every god within his eye in
Annu. I am the Heir, (5) the exalted (?), the mighty one, the Still \[of
Heart\]. I have made my name to flourish, and I have delivered \[it\],
that I may make myself to live \[in remembrance\] on this day."

Vignette: The deceased standing near flames of fire.

Text \[CHAPTER LXIIIB.\]: (I) THE CHAPTER OF NOT BEING SCALDED WITH
WATER. \[He saith\]: "I am the oar (2) made ready for rowing, wherewith
Ra ferried over the Aged godlike ones. (3) I carry the moistures of
Osiris to the lake away from the flame which cannot be passed (4); he is
turned aside from the path thereof and he is not burned in the fire. I
lie down with the *hamemu*; (5) I come unto the Lion's lair, killing and
binding; and I follow the path by which he came forth."

Vignette: Ani carrying a sail, emblematic of breath and air.

Text \[CHAPTER LIV.\]: (1) CHAPTER OF GIVING BREATH IN THE UNDERWORLD.
Saith Osiris Ani: "I am the Egg of the Great Cackler, and I watch and
guard that

great place\[1\] (2) which the god Seb hath proclaimed upon earth. I
live; and it liveth; I grow strong, I live, I sniff the air. I am (3)
Utcha-aab,\[2\] and I go round behind \[to protect\] his egg. I have
thwarted the chance of Set, the mighty one of strength. (4) Hail thou
who makest pleasant the world with *tchefa* food, and who dwellest in
the blue \[sky\]; watch over the babe in his cot when he cometh forth
unto thee."

Appendix: The two following chapters, which are closely connected with
the preceding chapter, are respectively supplied from Naville,
*Todtenbuch*, Bd. I., 131. 67, and the Nebseni Papyrus.

Vignette: Anubis leading the deceased into the presence of Osiris.

Text: \[CHAPTER LV.\]: (I) ANOTHER CHAPTER OF GIVING BREATH. \[He
saith\]: "I am Sabsabu. I am Shu. (2) I draw in the air in the presence
of the god of sunbeams as far as the uttermost ends of heaven, as far as
the ends of the earth, as far as the bounds of Shu (3); and I give
breath unto those who become young \[again\]. I open my mouth, and I see
with mine eyes."\[3\]

Vignette: A man holding a sail in his left hand.

Text \[CHAPTER LVI.\]: CHAPTER OF SNIFFING THE AIR UPON EARTH. \[He
saith\]: "(2) Hail, Tmu, grant thou unto me the sweet breath which is in
thy two nostrils. I embrace the mighty throne which is in Unnu,\[4\] and
I watch and guard the Egg of the Great Cackler. I grow, and it groweth;
it groweth, and I grow; I live, and it liveth; I sniff the air, and it
sniffeth the air."

Vignette: Ani standing, with a staff in his left hand.

Text \[CHAPTER XXIX.\]: (I) THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART OF A
MAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM IN THE UNDERWORLD. Saith Osiris Ani,
triumphant: "Turn thou back, O messenger of all the gods. (2) Is it that
thou art come to carry away\[5\] this my heart which liveth? My heart
which liveth

\[1. The text of Lepsius gives "I guard that great egg,"

etc.

2\. The variant text given by Naville indicates by that these words are
the name or title of a god. Birch translates them by "Discriminator of
Purity," and Pierret by "le sauvé dont le nom est pur."

3\. For the texts see Naville, *Todtenbuch*, Bd. I., Bll. 67, 68, 69.

4\. Hermopolis.

5\. In a variant vignette given by Naville the deceased holding his
heart in both hands offers it to three gods; and in another a man is
about to fasten a necklace with a pendent heart to the statue of the
deceased.\]

shall not be given unto thee. (3) \[As I\] advance, the gods give ear
unto my supplications, and they fall down upon their faces wheresoever
they be."
