# PLATE XXII.

"Osiris Ani, triumphant, hath not revealed what he hath seen,(17) he
hath not, he hath not told again what he hath heard in the house which
is hidden. Hail, there are shouts of joy to Osiris Ani, triumphant, (18)
for he is a god and the flesh of Ra, he is in the boat of Nu, and his ka
is well pleased according to the will of the god. (19) Osiris Ani,
triumphant, is in peace, he is triumphant like unto Horus, and he is
mighty because he hath divers forms."

Vignette: Ra seated in a boat, sailing across the sky towards the
starstudded heaven.

Rubric: These words shall be recited over a boat (20) seven cubits in
length, and painted green for the godlike rulers. Then shalt thou make a
heaven of stars (21) washed and purified with natron and incense.
Behold, thou shalt make an image (22) of Ra upon a table of stone
painted yellow (?), and it shall be placed in the fore-part of the boat.
(23) Behold, thou shalt make an image of the dead man whom thou wilt
make perfect in strength (24) in the boat; and thou shalt make it to
travel in the divine boat of Ra, (25) and Ra himself will look upon it
therein. Thou shalt show it to no man but thyself, (26) or to thy father
or to

{p. 329}

thy son; let them watch with their faces, and he shall be seen in the
underworld as a messenger of Ra.

Vignette: Ra, hawk-headed, with a disk upon his head, seated in a boat;
before him is a large disk.

Text \[CHAPTER CXXXIV.\]: (I) A HYMN OF PRAISE TO RA ON THE DAY OF THE
MONTH WHEREON HE SAILETH IN THE BOAT. \[Osiris, the scribe Ani, saith\]:
"Homage to thee, O thou who art in thy boat! Thou risest, thou risest,
(2) thou shinest with thy rays, and thou hast made mankind to rejoice
for millions of years according to thy will. Thou showest thy face unto
the beings whom thou hast created, O Khepera, (3) in thy boat. Thou hast
overthrown Apepi. O ye children of Seb, overthrow ye the foes of Osiris
(4) Ani, triumphant, destroy ye the adversaries of righteousness from
the boat of Ra. Horus shall cut off your (5) heads in heaven in the
likeness of ducks; ye shall fall down upon the earth and become beasts,
and into the water in the likeness of fishes. \[Osiris, the scribe
Ani,\] destroyeth every hostile fiend, male (6) and female, whether he
passeth through heaven, \[or\] appeareth (7) upon earth, or cometh forth
upon the water, or passeth along before the starry deities; and Thoth
strengtheneth them . . . . . . (8) coming forth from Anreti. Osiris, the
scribe Ani, is silent, and becometh the second of Ra. Behold thou the
god, the great slaughterer, (9) greatly to be feared, he washeth in your
blood, he batheth in your gore; Osiris, (10) the scribe Ani, destroyeth
them from the boat of his father Ra-Horus. The mother Isis giveth birth
unto Osiris, the scribe (11) Ani, triumphant, whose heart liveth, and
Nephthys nurseth him (12); even as they did for Horus, who drove back
the fiends of Sut. They saw (13) the *urertu* crown stablished upon his
head, and they fell down upon their faces. Behold, O ye shining ones, ye
men (14) and gods, ye damned ones, when ye behold Osiris Ani, triumphant
like unto Horus and adored (15) by reason of the ureret crown, fall ye
down upon your faces; for Osiris Ani is victorious (16) over his foes in
the heavens above and \[on the earth\] beneath, in the presence of the
godlike rulers (17) Of all the gods and goddesses."

Rubric: These words shall be recited over a great hawk which hath the
white crown set upon his head. Then shall the names of Tmu, (18) Shu,
Tefnut, Seb, Nut, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, be written with green colour
upon a (19) new table, anointed with unguents and placed in a boat
together with a figure of the dead man (20). Then shall they put incense
upon the fire, and set ducks to

{p. 330}

be roasted (21). This is a rite of Ra when his boat cometh; and it shall
cause the dead man to go with Ra into every place whithersoever he
saileth, and the foes of Ra shall be (22) slaughtered in very truth. The
Chapter of the *sektet* boat shall be recited on the sixth day of the
festival.

Vignette: The ladder by which the soul passes from the underworld to the
body.\[1\]
