# PLATE XVI.

Vignette: Ani standing, with both hands raised in prayer, before four
gods who are seated on a pedestal in the form of Maat; before him is his
heart set upon a pedestal.

Text \[CHAPTER XXVII.\]: (I) THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEART OF A
MAN BE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM IN THE UNDERWORLD.\[1\] Saith Osiris Ani:
"Hail, ye who carry away hearts, \[hail\] ye who steal hearts! (2) ye
have done.\[2\] Homage to you, O ye lords of eternity, ye possessors of
everlastingness, " take ye not away this heart of Osiris Ani (3) in your
grasp, this heart of Osiris. And cause ye not evil words to spring up
against it; because this heart of Osiris Ani is the heart of the one of
many names, the mighty one whose words are his limbs, and who sendeth
forth his heart to dwell in (4) his body. {???} heart of Osiris Ani is
pleasant unto the gods; he is victorious, he hath {???} gotten power
over it; he hath not revealed what hath been done unto it. He {???}
gotten power (5) over his own limbs. His heart obeyeth him, he is the
lord thereof, it is in his body, and it shall never fall away therefrom.
I, Osiris, the scribe Ani, victorious in peace, and triumphant in the
beautiful Amenta and on the mountain of eternity, bid thee be obedient
unto me in the underworld."

Appendix: The three following chapters, which do not occur in the Ani
papyrus, form part of the group of the chapters relating to the heart.
They are here supplied from Naville, *Todtenbuch*, Bd. I., Pl. xl.,
xlii., xxxix.

\[1. In Naville's edition there follow the words *hab-nef ab-f xenti
xat-f temam ab-f er neteru sexem am-f*, "his heart goeth to inhabit his
body; his heart is perfect before the gods, he gaineth possession of
it."

2\. The reading of Naville's edition is better here. "Ye who steal
hearts, and who make the heart of a man to come into existence according
to that which hath been done by him; may it (*i.e.*, his heart) be made
strong by you."\]

{p. 313}

Text \[CHAPTER XXIXA.\]:\[1\] (1) THE CHAPTER OF THE HEART NOT BEING
CARRIED AWAY IN THE UNDERWORLD. He saith: "My heart (2) is with me, and
it shall never come to pass that it shall be carried away. I am the lord
of hearts, the slayer of the heart. (3) I live in right and in truth,
and I have my being therein. I am Horus, a pure heart (4) within a pure
body. I live by my word, and my heart doth live. Let not my heart be
taken away (5), let it not be wounded, and may no wounds or gashes be
dealt upon me because it hath been taken away\[2\] from me. (6) May I
exist in the body of my father Seb, and in the body of my mother Nut. I
have not done evil (7) against the gods; I have not sinned with
boasting."

Vignette: The deceased adoring a heart.

Text \[CHAPTER XXXA.\]: (I) THE CHAPTER OF NOT (2) LETTING THE HEART OF
A MAN BE DRIVEN AWAY FROM HIM IN THE UNDERWORLD. \[He saith\]: "My
heart, my mother; my heart, my mother. My heart of my life upon earth.
May naught rise up (3) against me in judgment in the presence of the
lord of the trial; let it not be said concerning me and of that which I
have done. 'He hath done deeds against that which is right and true';
may naught be against me in the presence of the great god, the lord of
Amenta. Homage to thee, O my heart! Homage to thee, O my heart! Homage
to you, O my reins!\[3\] Homage to you, O ye gods who rule over the
divine clouds, and who (5) are exalted by reason of your sceptres; speak
ye comfortably unto Ra, and make me to prosper before Nehebka." And
behold him, even though he be joined to the earth in the innermost parts
thereof, and though he be laid upon it, he is not dead in Amenta, but is
a glorified being therein.

Vignette: The deceased holding his heart to his breast with his left
hand, and kneeling before a monster with a knife in its hand.

Text \[CHAPTER XXVIII.\]: (1) \[THE CHAPTER OF\] NOT LETTING THE HEART
OF THE DECEASED BE CARRIED AWAY IN THE UNDERWORLD. \[Saith he\]: (2)
"Hail, Lion-god! I am Un.\[4\] That which I hate is the block of the
god. Let not this my heart be taken away from me by (3) the Fighter\[5\]
in Annu. Hail thou who dost bind Osiris, and who hast seen Set! Hail
thou who returnest after smiting and destroying him. (4) This heart
sitteth and weepeth in the presence of Osiris; it hath with it the staff
for which it entreated him. May there be given unto me for it, may there
be decreed unto me for it the hidden things\[6\] of the heart in the (5)
house of Usekh-hra; may

3\. Brugsch believes that the word means the liver or kidneys, or some
special organ.; see *Wörterbuch*, p. 421.

there be granted unto it food at the bidding of the Eight.\[1\] Let not
this my heart be "taken from me! I make thee to dwell in thy place,
joining together hearts in (6) Sekhet-hetepu, and years of strength in
all places of strength, carrying away food (?) at thy it moment with thy
hand according to thy great strength. My heart is placed upon the altars
of Tmu (7), who leadeth it to the den of Set; he hath given unto me my
heart, whose will hath been done by the godlike rulers in Neter-khert.
When they find the leg\[2\] and the swathings they bury them."

of which are palm trees laden with fruit.

Text \[CHAPTER LVIII.\]: (1) THE CHAPTER OF BREATHING THE AIR AND OF
HAVING POWER OVER THE WATER IN THE UNDERWORLD. Saith Osiris Ani: "Open
to me! Who art thou then, and whither dost thou fare? (2) I am one of
you. Who is it with thee? It is Merti. Separate thou from him, each from
each, when thou enterest the Mesqen. He letteth me sail to the temple of
the divine beings who have found their faces(?). (4) The name of the
boat is 'Assembler of Souls'; the name of the oars is 'Making the hair
to stand on end'; the name it of the hold is 'Good'; (5) and the name of
the rudder is 'Making straight for the middle' . . . . . . \[3\] . . . .
. . (6) Grant ye to me vessels of milk together with cakes, loaves of
bread, cups of drink, and flesh in the temple of (7) Anubis."

Rubric: If this chapter be known \[by Ani\] he shall go in after having
come forth from the underworld.

Vignette: Ani kneeling beside a pool of water, where grows a sycamore
tree; in the tree appears the goddess Nut pouring water into Ani's hands
from a vessel

2\. This meaning is indicated by the determinative in the variant given
by Naville, *Todtenbuch*, Bd. II., Bl. 95. The whole sentence may be a
rubrical direction.

3 The text here appears to be corrupt, or at least some words have been
omitted, for the equivalent passage in Lepsius reads \#\#\#. The variant
reading indicated by *ki t' et* shows that this passage offered
difficulties to the ancient Egyptian readers.\]

{p. 315}

Text \[CHAPTER LIX.\]: (I) THE CHAPTER OF SNIFFING THE AIR, AND OF
GETTING POWER OVER THE WATERS IN THE UNDERWORLD. Saith Osiris Ani:
"Hail, sycamore tree of the goddess Nut! Grant thou to me of the water
and the air which are in (2) thee. I embrace thy throne which is in
Unnu,\[l\] and I watch and guard (3) the egg of the Great Cackler. It
groweth, I grow; it liveth, I live; (4) it sniffeth the air, I sniff the
air, I the Osiris Ani, in triumph."

Text \[CHAPTER XLIV\]: (I) THE CHAPTER OF NOT DYING A SECOND TIME IN THE
UNDERWORLD.\[4\] Saith Osiris Ani: "My place of hiding is opened, my
place of hiding is revealed! Light hath shone (2) in the darkness. The
eye of Horus hath ordered my coming into being, and the god Apuat hath
nursed me. I have hidden (3) myself with you, O ye stars that never set.
My brow is like unto that of Ra; my face is open; (4) my heart is upon
its throne; I utter words, and I know; in very truth, I am Ra himself. I
am not treated with scorn, (5) and violence is not done unto me. Thy
father, the son of Nut, liveth for thee. I am thy first-born, (6) and I
see thy mysteries. I am crowned like unto the king of the gods, and I
shall not die a second time in the underworld."

Vignette: The mummy of Ani embraced by Anubis, the god of the dead.

Chapter CLXXVI. (Naville, Todtenbuch, Bd. I., Pl. cc.) reads:--

"What I hate is the land of Abydos. May I never enter into the den, and
may there never be done unto me any of those things which the gods hate,
for I am . . . . pure within the Mesqet. May Neb-er-tcher give unto me
his splendours on the day of the funeral in the presence of the Lord of
Things."

"If this chapter be known \[he\] shall be in the condition of one who is
acquitted in the underworld."\]

limbs are without motion like unto \[those of\] Osiris! Let not thy
limbs be (3) without motion, let them not corrupt, let them not pass
away, let them not decay; let it be (4) done unto me even as if I were
the god Osiris."

Rubric: If this chapter be known by the Osiris Ani, he shall not corrupt
in the underworld.

Vignette: A doorway. By one post stands the soul of Ani in the form of a
human-headed hawk and by the other the bird.

Text: \[CHAPTER XLVI.\] (I) THE CHAPTER OF NOT PERISHING AND OF BECOMING
ALIVE IN THE UNDERWORLD. Saith Osiris Ani: "Hail, (2) children of:' Shu!

joined together for me in heaven by Ra, the guardian of the earth. (2)
This was granted on the day when my rising up out of weakness upon my
two feet was ordered, on the day (3) when the hair was cut off. The
bones of my neck and of my back have been joined together by Set and by
the company of the gods, even as they were (4) in the time that is past;
may nothing happen to break them apart. Make ye \[me\] strong against my
father's murderer. I have gotten power over the two earths. Nut hath
joined together my bones, and \[I\] behold \[them\] as they were in the
time that is past \[and I\] see \[them\] even in the same order as they
were \[when\] the gods had not come into being (6) in visible
forms.\[2\] I am Penti, I, Osiris the scribe Ani, triumphant, am the
heir of the great gods."
