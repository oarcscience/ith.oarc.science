In the Nebseni papyrus (Naville, *Todtenbuch*, Bd. I., Bll. 137, 138),
the CXXVth Chapter ends as follows:--

\(2\) "Homage to you, O ye gods, I know You, (3) and I know your names.
Cast me not down to your (4) knives of slaughter, and bring not my
wickedness into the presence of the god whom ye follow, (5) and let not
the time of my failings come before you. I pray you, declare me right
and true in the presence of the (6) universal God, because I have done
that which is right and true in Ta-mera; I have not cursed the god . . .
. . . .

"Homage to you, O ye gods who live in your hall Of (7) Right and Truth,
and who have no evil in your bodies, who feed on your own substance in
(8) the presence of Horus who liveth in his disk, deliver ye me from
Baabi, who feedeth on the inwards of the mighty ones on the day of the
great judgment which shall be holden by you. (9) I have come unto you; I
have committed no faults; I have not sinned; I have done no evil; I have
accused no man falsely; therefore let nothing be done against me. I live
in right and truth, (10) and I feed my heart upon right and truth. That
which men have bidden I have done, and the gods are satisfied thereat. I
have pacified the god, for I have done his (11) will. I have given bread
unto the hungry and water unto those who thirst, clothing unto the
naked, and a boat unto the shipwrecked mariner. (12) I have made holy
offerings unto the gods; and I have given meals of the tomb to the
sainted dead. O, then, deliver ye me, and protect me; accuse me not
before the great god. (13) I am pure of mouth, and I am pure of hands.
May those who see me say, 'Come in peace, come in peace.' For I have
heard the speech which the Ass held with the Cat in the House of
Hept-re. (14) 1 have borne witness before him \[the god\] and he hath
given judgment. I have beheld the dividing of the persea trees (15)
within Re-stau. I offer up prayers in the presence of the gods, knowing
that which concerneth them. I have come forward to make a declaration of
right and truth, and to place (16) the balance upon its supports within
the groves of amaranth. Hail, thou who art exalted upon thy resting
place, thou lord of the *atef* crown, who declarest thy name as the lord
of the (17) winds, deliver thou me from thine angels of destruction, who
make dire deeds to happen and calamities to arise, and (18) who have no
covering upon their faces, because I have done right and truth, O thou
Lord of right and truth. I am pure, in my fore-parts have I been made
clean, and in my hinder parts have I (19) been purified; my reins have
been bathed in the Pool of right and

{p. 352}

truth, and no member of my body was wanting. I have been purified in the
pool of the south. I have rested in Hemet, on the north of the (20)
field of the grasshoppers, wherein the holy mariners do purify
themselves in the night season, that they may pacify (?) the heart of
the gods after I have passed over it (21) by night and by day. May the
gods say unto me, 'We let him come,' and they say unto me, 'Who art
thou, and what is thy name?' My name is 'I grew among (22) the flowers,
dwelling in the olive tree.' Then shall they say unto me, 'Pass on
straightway.' I have passed by the city on the north of the groves, and
the gods say, 'What didst thou see there?' \[I saw\] the Leg and the
Thigh. (23) 'What hadst thou to do with them?' I saw rejoicings in the
lands of the Fenkhu. 'What did they give thee?' They gave me a (24)
flame of fire together with a crystal tablet. 'What didst thou
therewith?' I burned it at the place of Maati together with the things
of the night. 'What didst thou (25) find there at the place of Maati?' A
sceptre of flint which maketh a man to prevail. 'What then is \[the
name\] of this sceptre of flint?' 'Giver of winds' is its name. 'What
then didst thou unto the flame of fire with the tablet of (26) crystal
after thou didst bury it?' I uttered words over it, I made (27)
adjuration thereby, I quenched the fire, and I used the tablet to create
(28) a pool of water. 'Come, then, pass through the door of this Hall of
two-fold Maati, for thou (29) knowest us.' 'I will not let thee enter in
over me,' saith the bolt of the door, (30) 'unless thou tell my name.'
'Weight of the place of right and truth' is thy name. I will not let
thee (31) pass in by me,' saith the right post of the door, 'unless thou
tell my name.' (32) 'Weigher of the labours of right and truth' is thy
name. 'I will not let thee enter in by me,' saith the left Post (33) of
the door, 'unless thou tell my name.' 'judge of (34) wine' (?) is thy
name. 'I will not let thee pass,' saith the threshold of the door, (35)
unless thou tell my name.' 'Ox of Seb' is thy name. 'I will not open
unto thee,' (36) saith the bolt-socket of the door, 'unless thou tell my
name.' 'Flesh of his (37) mother' is thy name. I will not open unto
thee,' saith the lock of the door, 'unless thou tell my name.' The
*utchat* of Sebek, the Lord of Bakhan, liveth' is thy name. (38) 'I will
not open unto thee, and I will not let thee pass over me,' saith the
dweller at the door, 'unless thou tell my name.' 'Arm of Shu that
placeth itself to protect Osiris' (39) is thy name. 'We will not let
thee pass by us,' say the posts of the door, 'unless thou tell our
names.' 'Serpent children of Rennut' are your names. 'Thou (40) knowest
us, pass thou by us.' 'Thou shalt not tread upon me,' saith the floor of
the hall, I unless thou tell my name.' 'I am silent, I am pure.' 'I know
not (41) \[the names of\] thy two feet with which thou wouldst walk upon
me; tell them unto me.' '. . . . . before Amsu' is the name of my right
foot, 'Grief of Nephthys' is the name Of (42) my left foot. 'Tread thou
upon me, for thou knowest me.' 'I will not question thee,' saith the
warder of the door of the hall, unless thou tell my name.' 'Discerner of
hearts, (43) searcher of reins' is thy name. I will question thee now.
Who is the god that liveth in his hour? Say thou.' The teller of the two
lands. 'Who then is the teller (44) of the two lands?' It is Thoth.
'Come then,' saith Thoth, 'come hither (?).' And I come forward to the
test. 'What, now, is thy condition?' I am pure from (45) all evil, I am
shielded from the baleful acts of those who live in their days, and I am
not among them. 'I have tried thee. (46) Who is he that goeth down into
the fire, the walls whereof are \[crowned\]

{p. 353}

with uræi, and whose paths are in the lake \[of fire\]?' He who passeth
through it (47) is Osiris. 'Advance thou, in very truth thou hast been
tested. Thy bread is in the *utchat*, thine ale is in the *utchat*, and
meals of the tomb are brought forth unto thee upon earth from the
*utchat*. This hath been decreed for thee.'"

\(1\) \[CHAPTER XLII.\] THE CHAPTER OF DRIVING BACK SLAUGHTER IN
SUTENHENEN. Saith Osiris: "O land of the sceptre! (2) O white crown of
the divine Form! O holy resting place! I am the Child. I am the Child. I
am the Child. I am the Child. Hail, thou goddess Aburt! Thou sayest
daily, 'The slaughter block is (3) made ready as thou knowest, and thou
who wert mighty hast been brought to decay.' I establish those who
praise me. I am the holy knot within the tamarisk tree, more beautiful
(4) in brightness than yesterday." To be said four times. I am Ra who
establish those who praise him. I am the knot within the tamarisk tree,
more beautiful in brightness than the disk of yesterday. . . . . . . (5)
going forth on this. day. My hair is the hair of Nu. My face is the face
of Ra. Mine eyes are the eyes of Hathor. Mine ears are the ears of
Ap-uat. (6) My nose is the nose of Khent-sheps.\[2\] My lips are the
lips of Anpu. My teeth are the teeth of Khepera. My neck is the neck of
Isis, the divine lady. (7) My hands are the hands of Khnemu, the lord of

{p. 356}

the eye of Horus. My hips and thighs are the hips and thighs of Nut. My
feet are the feet of Ptah. My fingers and leg-bones arc the fingers and
leg-bones of the living (10) uræi. There is no member of my body which
is not the member of some god. Thoth shieldeth my body altogether, and I
am \[like\] unto Ra every day. (11) None shall seize me by mine arms;
none shall drag me away by my hand. And there shall do me hurt neither
men, nor gods, nor sainted dead, nor they who have perished, nor any one
of those of olden times, (12) nor any mortal, nor human being. I come
forth and advance, and my name is unknown. I am yesterday, and my (13)
name is 'Seer of millions of years.' I travel, I travel along the path
of Horus the judge. I am the lord of eternity; I feel and I have power
to perceive. I am the lord of the red crown. I am the Sun's eye, yea,
(14) I am in my egg, in my egg. It is granted unto me to live therewith.
I am in the Sun's eye, when it closeth, and I live by the strength
thereof I come forth and I shine; (15) I enter in and I come to life. I
am in the Sun's eye, my seat is on my throne, and I sit thereon within
the eye. I am Horus who pass through millions of years. (16) I have
governed my throne and I rule it by the words of my mouth; and whether
\[I\] speak or whether \[I\] keep silence, I keep the balance even.
Verily my forms are changed. I am the (17) god Unen, from season unto
season; what is mine is within me. I am the only One born of an only
One, who goeth round about in his course; (18) 1 am within the eye of
the Sun. Things are not evil nor hostile unto me, nor are they against
me. I open the door of heaven. I govern my throne, and I give \[new\]
birth to myself on this day. \[I am\] not the Child who trod (19) the
path of yesterday, but I am 'To-day' for untold nations. It is I who
make you strong for millions of years, whether ye be in the heaven, or
(20) in the earth, or in the south, or in the north, or in the west or
in the east; fear of me is in your hearts. I am the pure one who dwell
within the sacred eye. I shall not die (21) again. My hour resteth with
you, but my forms are within my dwelling-place. I am he who is unknown,
and the gods with rose-bright countenances are (22) with me. I am the
unveiled one. The season wherein \[the god\] created heaven for me and
enlarged the bounds of the earth and made great the progeny thereof
cannot be found Out. (23) My name setteth itself apart and removeth from
all evil things through the words which I speak unto you. I am he who
riseth and shineth; the wall of walls; the only One, \[son\] of an only
One. Ra (24) never lacketh his form, he never passeth away, he never
passeth away. Verily, I say: I am the plant which cometh forth from Nu,
and my mother is Nut. Hail, (25) O my Creator, I am he who hath no power
to walk, the great knot within yesterday. My power is in my hand. I am
not known, \[but\] I am he who knoweth (26) thee. I cannot be held with
the hand, but I am he who can hold thee in his hand. \[Hail\] O Egg!
\[Hail\] O Egg! I am Horus who live for millions of years, whose flame
lighteth upon your faces and (27) blazeth in your hearts. I have the
command of my throne, and I advance in mine hour. I have opened the
paths, I have turned myself away from all evil. I am (28) the ape of
gold, three palms and two fingers \[high\], which is without legs and
without arms, and which dwelleth in the House of Ptah. I go forth even
as goeth forth the ape Of (29) gold three palms and two fingers
\[high\], which hath neither legs nor arms, and which dwelleth in the
house of Ptah." When \[thou\] hast said this chapter thou shalt open a
way and enter thereon.
