[Introduction](#intro)  [Translation](#translation.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the substantial amount of hieroglypics interspersed in the
original text, I have omitted the \#\#\# 'glyph' placeholder where
context permits, for readability. Only actual illustations have been
inserted into the file. Due to space considerations the interlinear
translation, which is primarily of interest to students of Ancient
Egyptian, will not be posted. This should not be a hardship, since the
Dover reprint edition is still in print and widely available.

The file above, which appears at on the Internet at Sacred-Texts for the
**first** time is a faithful e-text of the 1895 edition of the E.A.
Wallace Budge translation of the Egyptian Book of the Dead.

In November of 2000 I inventoried my library and found that I was
missing Budge's Book of the Dead. So when a copy of the Dover reprint
came up at the local used bookstore, I purchased it. To my dismay, the
version of the text widely posted on the Internet did not seem to match
the Dover reprint of the 1895 version.

According to John Mark Ockerbloom, the proprietor of the excellent
[Online Books Page](https://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/.md), the
version circulating on the Internet is a highly edited version of Budge
from a much later date (1913). He writes:

"I did a little legwork, and it appears that the "mystery text" is in
fact from the Medici Society edition of 1913. According to a 1960
reprint by University Books, for this edition "The translation was
rewritten... \[and the\] greater part of the Introduction was also
rewritten by Sir Wallis, who concluded a preface to it with the pleased
words, 'and the entire work thus becomes truly a "New Edition"'". It's
unclear whether Budge himself did the rewrite of the translation, but
it's clear that he at least claims responsibility for it,. and it does
appear to draw fairly heavily on his earlier translation."

Thanks to Mr. Ockerbloom for clearing up this mystery.

In any case, the version now at Intangible Textual Heritage is a
completely new e-text, which I believe to be a much better version of
this text.
