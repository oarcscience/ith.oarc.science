TO THE EAST IN THE UNDERWORLD. Saith Osiris Ani: "Hail, manhood of (2)
Ra, which advanceth and beateth down opposition; things which have been
without movement for millions of years come into being through the god
Baba. Hereby am I made stronger than (3) the strong, and hereby have I
more power than they who are mighty. And therefore neither shall I be
borne away nor carried by force to the East, to take part in the
festivals of the fiends; (4) nor shall there \[be given unto me\] cruel
gashes with knives, nor shall I be shut in on every side, nor gored by
the horns \[of the god Khepera\]". . . . . . . . . . . .\[1\]

"So then shall no evil things be done unto me by the fiends, neither
shall I (6) be gored by the horns \[of Khepera\]; and the manhood of Ra,
which is the head of Osiris, shall not be swallowed up. Behold me, (7) I
enter into my homestead, and I reap the harvest. The gods speak with me.
(8) Gore thou not them, O Ra-khepera. In very truth sickness shall not
arise in the eye of Tmu nor shall it (9) be destroyed. Let me be brought
to an end, may I not be carried into the East to take part in the
festivals of the fiends who are my enemies (10); may no cruel gashes be
made in me. I, Osiris, the scribe Ani, the teller of the divine
offerings of all the gods, triumphant with happy victory, the lord to be
revered. am not carried away into the East."

Text \[CHAPTER XLIII.\]: (1) THE CHAPTER OF NOT LETTING THE HEAD OF A
MAN BE CUT OFF FROM HIM IN THE UNDERWORLD. Saith Osiris Ani: (2) "I am
the great One, son of the great One; I am Fire, the son of Fire, to whom
was (3) given his head after it had been cut off. The head of Osiris was
not carried away from him; let not the head of Osiris Ani (4) be carried
away from him. I have knit together my bones, I have made myself whole
and sound; I have become young once more; I am Osiris, the Lord of
eternity."

\[1. The text of the rest of this chapter is corrupt.

2\. In other early papyri these two chapters form one; the division
probably arose from a blunder on the part of the scribe.\]

Text \[CHAPTER LXXXIX.\]: (1) THE CHAPTER OF CAUSING THE SOUL TO BE
UNITED TO ITS BODY IN THE UNDERWORLD. Saith Osiris Ani: "Hail, thou god
Annitu! Hail, O Runner, (2) dwelling in thy hall! O thou great god,
grant thou " that my soul may come unto me from wheresoever it may be.
If it would tarry, then bring thou unto me (3) my soul from wheresoever
it may be. \[ If\] thou findest \[me\], O Eye of Horus, make thou me to
stand up like those beings who are like unto Osiris and who never lie
down in death. Let not (4) Osiris Ani, triumphant, triumphant, lie down
in death in Annu, the land wherein souls are joined unto their bodies,
even in thousands. My soul doth bear away with it my victorious spirit
(5) whithersoever it goeth\[1\] . . . . . . . . . . . (6) If it would
tarry, grant thou that my soul may look upon my body. \[If\] thou
findest \[me\], O Eye of Horus, make thou me to stand up like unto
those\[1\] . . . . . . . (7) Hail, ye gods, who row in the boat of the
lord of millions of years, who tow it (8) above the underworld, who make
it to pass over the ways of Nu, who make souls to enter into their
glorified bodies, (9) whose hands are filled with righteousness, and
whose fingers grasp your sceptres, destroy ye (10) the foe. The boat of
the Sun rejoiceth, and the great god advanceth in peace. Behold \[ye
gods\], grant that this soul of Osiris Ani (11) may come forth
triumphant before the gods, and triumphant before you, from the eastern
horizon of heaven, to follow unto the place where it was yesterday, in
peace, in peace, in Amenta. (12) May he behold his body, may he rest in
his glorified frame, may he never perish, and may his body never see
corruption."

soul, standing at the open door of the tomb; and (3) the deceased, with

tomb, upon which is the disk of the rayed sun.

exalted, thou who art adored, (2) thou mighty one of souls, thou Ram (or
Soul), possessor of terrible power, who dost put fear of thee into the
hearts of the gods, thou who art crowned upon thy mighty throne! It is
he who maketh the path for the *khu* and for (3) the soul of Osiris Ani.
I am furnished \[with that which I need\], I am a *khu* furnished \[with
that which I need\], I have made my way unto the place wherein are Ra
and Hathor."

Rubric: If this chapter be known, Ani shall become like unto a shining
being fully equipped in the underworld. He shall not be stopped at any
door in the underworld from going in and coming out millions of times.

shadow, accompanied by his soul.

bondage is opened, that which was shut is opened,\[2\] and; the place of
bondage is opened unto my soul \[according to the bidding of\]\[3\] the
eye of Horus. I have bound and stablished (3) glories upon the brow of
Ra. \[My\] steps are made long, \[my\] thighs are lifted up; I have
passed along the great path, and my limbs are strong. (4) 1 am Horus,
the avenger of his father, and I bring the *ureret* crown to rest upon
its place. The path of souls is opened \[to my soul\]."
