# INTRODUCTION.

## THE VERSIONS OF THE BOOK OF THE DEAD.

The four great Versions of the Book of the Dead.

THE history of the great body of religious compositions which form the
Book of Dead of the ancient Egyptians may conveniently be divided into
four\[1\] of the periods, which are represented by four versions:--

1\. The version which was edited by the priests of the college of Annu
(the On of the Bible, and the Heliopolis of the Greeks), and which was
based upon a series of texts now lost, but which there is evidence to
prove had passed through a series of revisions or editions as early as
the period of the Vth dynasty. This version was, so far as we know,
always written in hieroglyphics, and may be called the Heliopolitan
version. It is known from five copies which are inscribed upon the walls
of the chambers and passages in the pyramids\[2\] of kings of the Vth
and VIth dynasties at Sakkâra;\[3\] and sections of it are found
inscribed upon tombs, sarcophagi, coffins, stelæ and papyri from the
XIth dynasty to about A.D. 200.\[4\]

\[1. See Naville, *Todtenbuch* (Einleitung), p. 39.

2\. Hence known as the "pyramid texts."

3\. *I.e.*, Unâs, Tetâ, Pepi I., Mentu-em-sa-f, and Pepi II. Their
pyramids were cleared out by MM. Mariette and Maspero during the years
1890-84, and the hieroglyphic texts were published, with a French
translation, in *Recueil de Travaux*, t. iii-xiv., Paris, 1882-93.

4\. In the XIth, XIIth, and XIIIth dynasties many monuments are
inscribed with sections of the Unâs text. Thus lines 206-69 are found in
hieroglyphics upon the coffin of Amamu (British Museum, No. 6654. See
Birch, *Egyptian Texts of the Earliest Period from the Coffin of Amamu*,
1886. Plates XVII.-XX.); Il. 206-14 and 268-84 on the coffin of
Apa-ankh, from Sakkâra (see Lepsius, *Denkmäler*, ii., Bl. 99 *b*;
Maspero, *Recueil*, t. iii., pp. 200 and 214 ff.); Il. 206-10 {footnote
page x.} and 268-89 on the coffin of Antef (see Lepsius, *Denkmäler*,
ii., Bl. 145; Maspero, *Recueil*, t. iii., pp. 200, 214); line 206 on a
coffin of Menthu-hetep at Berlin (see Lepsius, *Aelteste Texte*, Bl. 5);
lines 269-94 on the sarcophagus of Heru-hetep (see Maspero, *Mémoires*,
t, i., p. 144). A section is found on the walls of the tomb of Queen
Neferu (see Maspero, *Recueil*, t. iii., p. 201 ff.; *Mémoires*, t. i.,
p. 134); other sections are found on the sarcophagus of Taka (see
Lepsius, *Denkmäler*, ii., Bll. 147, 148; Maspero, *Guide au Visiteur*,
p. 224, No. 1053; *Mémoires*, t. i., p. 134); lines 5-8 occur on the
stele of Apa (see Ledrain, *Monuments Égyptiens de la Bibl. Nationale*,
Paris, 1879, foll. 14, 15); lines 166 ff. are found on the stele of Nehi
(see Mariette, *Notice des Mon. à Boulaq*, p. 190; Maspero, *Recueil*,
t. iii., p. 195); and lines 576-83 on the coffin of Sebek-Aa (see
Lepsius, *Aelteste Texte*, Bl. 37; Maspero, *Recueil*, t. iv., p. 68).
In the XVIIIth dynasty line 169 was copied on a wall in the temple of
Hatshepset at Dêr el-baharî (see Dümichen, *Hist. Inschriften*, Bll.
25-37; Maspero, *Recueil*, t. i., p. 195 ff.); and copies of lines
379-99 occur in the papyri of Mut-hetep (British Museum, No. 10,010) and
Nefer-uten-f (Paris, No. 3092, See Naville, *Todtenbuch*, Bd. I., Bl.
197; *Aeg. Zeitschrift*, Bd. XXXII., p. 3; and Naville, Einleitung, pp.
39, 97). In the XXVIth dynasty we find texts of the Vth dynasty repeated
on the walls of the tomb of Peta-Amen-apt, the chief *kher-heb* at
Thebes (see Dümichen, *Der Grabpalast des Patuamenap in der Thebanischen
Nekropolis*, Leipzig, 1884-85); and also upon the papyrus written for
the lady Sais \#\#\#, about A.D. 200 (see Devéria, *Catalogue des MSS.
Égyptiens*, Paris, 1874, p. 170 No. 3155). Signor Schiaparelli's words
are:--"Esso è scritto in ieratico, di un tipo paleografico speciale: l'
enorme abbondanza di segni espletivi, la frequenza di segni o quasi
demotici o quasi geroglifici, la sottigliezza di tutti, e l'incertezza
con cui sono tracciati, che rivela una mano più abituata a scrivere in
greco che in egiziano, sono altrettanti caratteri del tipo ieratico del
periodo esclusivamente romano, a cui il nostro papiro appartiene senza
alcun dubbio." *Il Libro dei Funerali*, p. 19. On Devéria's work in
connection with this MS., see Maspero, *Le Rituel du sacrifice
Funéraire* (in *Revue de l'Histoire des Religions*, t. xv., p. 161).\]

II\. The Theban version, which was commonly written on papyri in
hieroglyphics and was divided into sections or chapters, each of which
had its distinct title but no definite place in the series. The version
was much used from the XVIIIth to the XXth dynasty.

III\. A version closely allied to the preceding version, which is found
written on papyri in the hieratic character and also in hieroglyphics.
In this version, which came into use about the XXth dynasty, the
chapters have no fixed order.

IV\. The so-called Saïte version, in which, at some period anterior
probably to the XXVIth dynasty, the chapters were arranged in a definite
order. It is commonly written in hieroglyphics and in hieratic, and it
was much used from the XXVIth dynasty to the end of the Ptolemaic
period.

Early forms of the Book of the Dead.

The Book of the Dead.

The earliest inscribed monuments and human remains found in Egypt prove
that the ancient Egyptians took the utmost care to preserve the bodies
of their

{p. xi}

dead by various processes of embalming. The deposit of the body in the
tomb was accompanied by ceremonies of a symbolic nature, in the course
of which certain compositions comprising prayers, short litanies, etc.,
having reference to the future life, were recited or chanted by priests
and relatives on behalf of the dead. The greatest importance was
attached to such compositions, in the belief that their recital would
secure for the dead an unhindered passage to God in the next world,
would enable him to overcome the opposition of all ghostly foes, would
endow his body in the tomb with power to resist corruption, and would
ensure him a new life in a glorified body in heaven. At a very remote
period certain groups of sections or chapters had already become
associated with some of the ceremonies which preceded actual burial, and
these eventually became a distinct ritual with clearly defined limits.
Side by side, however, with this ritual there seems to have existed
another and larger work, which was divided into an indefinite number of
sections or chapters comprising chiefly prayers, and which dealt on a
larger scale with the welfare of the departed in the next world, and
described the state of existence therein and the dangers which must be
passed successfully before it could be reached, and was founded
generally on the religious dogmas and mythology of the Egyptians. The
title of "Book of the Dead" is usually given by Egyptologists to the
editions of the larger work which were made in the XVIIIth and following
dynasties, but in this Introduction the term is intended to include the
general body of texts which have reference to the burial of the dead and
to the new life in the world beyond the grave, and which are known to
have existed in revised editions and to have been in use among the
Egyptians from about B.C. 4500, to the early centuries of the Christian
era.

Uncertainty of the history of its source

The home, origin, and early history of the collection of ancient
religious texts which have descended to us are, at present, unknown, and
all working theories regarding them, however strongly supported by
apparently well-ascertained facts, must be carefully distinguished as
theories only, so long as a single ancient necropolis in Egypt remains
unexplored and its inscriptions are untranslated. Whether they were
composed by the inhabitants of Egypt, who recorded them in hieroglyphic
characters, and who have left the monuments which are the only
trustworthy sources of information on the subject, or whether they were
brought into Egypt by the early immigrants from the Asiatic continent
whence they came, or whether they represent the religious books of the
Egyptians incorporated with the funeral texts of some prehistoric
dwellers on the banks of the Nile, are all questions which the possible
discovery of inscriptions belonging to the first dynasties of the Early
Empire can alone decide. The evidence derived from the

{p. xii}

Its antiquity.

enormous mass of new material which we owe to the all-important
discoveries of *mastaba* tombs and pyramids by M. Maspero, and to his
publication of the early religious texts, proves beyond all doubt that
the greater part of the texts comprised in the Book of the Dead are far
older than the period of Mena (Menes), the first historical king of
Egypt.\[1\] Certain sections indeed appear to belong to an indefinitely
remote and primeval time.

Internal evidence of its antiquity.

The earliest texts bear within themselves proofs, not only of having
been composed, but also of having been revised, or edited, long before
the days of king Meni, and judging from many passages in the copies
inscribed in hieroglyphics upon the pyramids of Unas (the last king of
the Vth dynasty, about B.C. 3333), and Teta, Pepi I., Mer-en-Ra, and
Pepi II. (kings of the VIth dynasty, about B.C. 3300-3166), it would
seem that, even at that remote date, the scribes were perplexed and
hardly understood the texts which they had before them.\[2\] The most
moderate estimate makes certain sections of the Book of the Dead as
known from these tombs older than three thousand years before Christ. We
are in any case justified in estimating the earliest form of the work to
be contemporaneous with the foundation of the civilization\[3\] which we
call Egyptian in the valley of

\[1. "Les textes des Pyramides . . . . . . nous reportent si loin dans
le passé que je n'ai aucun moyen de les dater que de dire qu'elles
étaient dejà vieilles cinq mille ans avant notre ère. Si extraordinaire
que paraisse ce chiffre, il faudra bien nous habituer à le considérer
comme représentant une évaluation *à minima* toutes les fois qu'on
voudra rechercher les origines de la religion Égyptienne. La religion et
les textes qui nous la font connaître étaient déjà constitués avant la
I<sup>re</sup> dynastie: c'est à nous de nous mettre, pour les
comprendre, dans l'état d'esprit où était, il y a plus de sept mille
ans, le peuple qui les a constitués. Bien entendu, je ne parle ici que
des systèmes théologiques: si nous voulions remonter jusqu'à l'origine
des é1éments qu'ils ont mis en œuvre, il nous faudrait reculer vers des
ages encore plus lointains." Maspero, *La Mythologie Égyptienne* (in
*Revue de l'Histoire des Religions*, t. xix., p. 12; and in *Études de
Mythologie et d'Archéologie Égyptiennes*, t. ii., p. 2 36). Compare also
"dass die einzelnen Texte selbst damals schon einer alten heiligen
Litteratur angehörten, unterliegt keinem Zweifel, sie sind in jeder
Hinsicht alterthümlicher als die ältesten uns erhaltenen Denkmäler. Sie
gehören in eine für uns 'vorhistorische' Zeit und man wird ihnen gewiss
kein Unrecht anthun, wenn man sie bis in das vierte Jahrtausend hinein
versetzt." Erman, Das Verhältniss des aegyptischen zu den semitischen
Sprachen, in Z.D.M.G., Bd. XLVI., p. 94.

venimeux montre quel effroi le serpent et le scorpion inspirait aux
Égyptiens. Beaucoup d'entre elles sont écrites dans une langue et avec
des combinaisons de signes qui ne paraissent plus avoir été complètement
comprises des scribes qui les copiaient sous Ounas et sous Pepi. Je
crois, quant à moi, qu'elles appartiennent an plus vieux rituel et
remontent an delà du règne de Mînî." Maspero, La Religion Égyptienne (in

civilization of Egypt is absolutely impossible.\[2\]

Evidence of the antiquity of certain chapters.

The oldest form or edition of the Book of the Dead as we have received
it supplies no information whatever as to the period when it was
compiled; but a copy of the hieratic text inscribed upon a coffin of
Menthu-hetep, a queen of the XIth dynasty,\[3\] about B.C. 2500, made by
the late Sir J. G. Wilkinson,\[4\] informs us that the chapter which,
according to the arrangement of Lepsius, bears the number LXIV.,\[5\]
was discovered in the reign of Hesep-ti,\[6\] the fifth king of the Ist
dynasty, about B.C. 4266. On this coffin are two copies of the chapter,
the one immediately following the other. In the rubric to the first the
name of the king during whose reign the chapter is said to have been
"found" is given as Menthu-hetep, which, as Goodwin first pointed
out,\[7\] is a mistake for Men-kau-Ra,\[8\] the fourth king of the IVth
dynasty, about B.C. 3633;\[9\] but in the rubric to the second the
king's name is given as Hesep-ti. Thus it appears that in the period of
the XIth dynasty it was believed that the chapter might alternatively be
as old as the time of the Ist dynasty. Further, it is given to Hesep-ti
in papyri of the XXIst dynasty,\[10\] a period when particular attention
was paid to the history of the Book of the Dead; and it thus appears
that the Egyptians of the Middle Empire believed the chapter to date
from the more

\[1. The date of Mena, the first king of Egypt, is variously given B.C.
5867 (Champollion), B.C. 5004 (Mariette), B.C. 5892 (Lepsius), B.C. 4455
(Brugsch).

gives the king's name as Men-kau-Ra (*Todtenbuch*, Bl. 25, l. 30. In the

remote period. To quote the words of Chabas, the chapter was regarded as
being "very ancient, very mysterious, and very difficult to understand"
already fourteen centuries before our era.\[1\]

Antiquity of Chapter LXIV.

The rubric on the coffin of Queen Menthu-hetep, which ascribes the
chapter to Hesep-ti, states that "this chapter was found in the
foundations beneath the *hennu* boat by the foreman of the builders in
the time of the king of the North and South, Hesep-ti, triumphant";\[2\]
the Nebseni papyrus says that this chapter was found in the city of
Khemennu (Hermopolis) on a block of ironstone (?) written in letters of
lapis-lazuli, under the feet of the god";\[3\] and the Turin papyrus
(XXVIth dynasty or later) adds that the name of the finder was
Heru-ta-ta-f, the son of Khufu or Cheops,\[4\] the second king of the
IVth dynasty, about B.C. 3733, who was at the time making a tour of
inspection of the temples. Birch\[5\] and Naville\[6\] consider the
chapter one of

\[1. Chabas, *Voyage d'un Égyptien*, p. 46. According to M. Naville
(Einleitung, p. 138), who follows Chabas's opinion, this chapter is an
abridgement of the whole Book of the Dead; and it had, even though it
contained not all the religious doctrine of the Egyptians, a value which
was equivalent to the whole.

oldest of all, and is attributed, as already stated, to the epoch of
king Gaga-Makheru or Menkheres . . . . . This chapter enjoyed a high
reputation till a late period, for it is found on a stone presented to
General Perofski by the late Emperor Nicholas, which must have come from
the tomb of Petemenophis,\[\*\] in the El-Assasif\[+\] and was made
during the XXVIth dynasty Some more recent compiler of the Hermetic
books has evidently paraphrased it for the Ritual of Turin." Bunsen,
*Egypt's Place in Universal History*, London, 1867, p. 1142. The block
of stone to which Dr. Birch refers is described by Golénischeff,
*Inventaire de la Ermitage Impérial, Collection Égyptienne*, No. 1101,
pp. 169, 170. M. Maspero thinks it was meant to be a "prétendu
fac-similé" of the original slab, which, according to the rubric, was
found in the temple of Thoth, *Revue de l'Histoire des Religions*, t.
XV., p. 299, and *Études de Mythologie*, t i., p. 368.

{p. xv}

the oldest in the Book of the Dead; the former basing his opinion on the
rubric' and the latter upon the evidence derived from the contents and
character of the text; but Maspero, while admitting the great age of the
chapter, does not attach any very great importance to the rubric as
fixing any exact date for its composition.\[1\] Of Herutataf the finder
of the block of stone, we know from later texts that he was considered
to be a learned man, and that his speech was only with difficulty to be
understood,\[2\] and we also know the prominent part which he took as a
recognized man of letters in bringing to the court of his father Khufu
the sage Tetteta.\[3\] It is then not improbable that Herutataf's
character for learning may have suggested the connection of his name
with the chapter, and possibly as its literary reviser; at all events as
early as the period of the Middle Empire tradition associated him with
it.

\[1. "On explique d'ordinaire cette indication comme une marque
d'antiquité extrême; on part de ce principe que le *Livre des Morts* est
de composition relativement moderne, et qu'un scribe égyptien, nommant
un roi des premières dynasties memphites, ne pouvait entendre par là
qu'un personnage d'époque très reculée. Cette explication ne me paraît
pas être exacte. En premier lieu, le chapitre LXIV. se trouve déjà sur
des monuments contemporains de la X<sup>e</sup> et de la XI<sup>e</sup>
dynastie, et n'était certainement pas nouveau au moment où on écrivait
les copies les plus vieilles que nous en ayons aujourd'hui. Lorsqu'on le
rédigea sous sa forme actuelle, le règne de Mykérinos, et même celui
d'Housapaiti, ne devaient pas soulever dans l'esprit des indigènes la
sensation de l'archaïsme et du primitif: on avait pour rendre ces idées
des expressions plus fortes, qui renvoyaient le lecteur au siècles des
*Serviteurs d'Horus*, à la domination de Ra, aux âges où les dieux
régnaient sur l'Égypte." *Revue de l'Histoire des Religions*, t. xv., p.
299.

2 Chabas, Voyage, p. 46; Wiedemann, *Aegyptische Geschichte*, p. 191. In
the Brit. Mus. papyrus No. 10,060 (Harris 500), Herutataf is mentioned
together with I-em-hetep as a well known author, and the writer of the
dirge says, "I have heard the words of I-em-hetep and of Herutataf,
whose many and varied writings are said and sung; but now where are
their places?" The hieratic text is published with a hieroglyphic
transcript by Maspero in *Journal Asiatique*, Sér. VII<sup>ième</sup>,
t. xv., p. 404 ff., and *Études Égyptiennes*, t. i., p. 173; for English
translations, see *Trans. Soc. Bibl. Arch.*, vol. iii., p. 386, and
*Records of the Past*, 1st ed., vol. iv., p. 117.

3 According to the Westcar papyrus, Herutataf informed his father Khufu
of the existence of a man 110 years old who lived in the town of
Tettet-Seneferu: he was able to join to its body again a head that had
been cut off, and possessed influence over the lion, and was acquainted
with the mysteries of Thoth. By Khufu's command Herutataf brought the
sage to him by boat, and, on his arrival, the king ordered the head to
be struck off from a prisoner that Tetteta might fasten it on again.
Having excused himself from performing this act upon a man, a goose was
brought and its head was cut off and laid on one side of the room and
the body was placed on the other. The sage spake certain words of power
whereupon the goose stood up and began to waddle, and the head also
began to move towards it; when the head had joined itself again to the
body the bird stood up and cackled. For the complete hieratic text,
transcript and translation, see Erman, *Die Märchen des Papyrus
Westcar*, Berlin, 1890, p. it, plate 6.\]

{p. xvi}

The Book of the Dead in the IInd dynasty.

Passing from the region of native Egyptian tradition, we touch firm
ground with the evidence derived from the monuments of the IInd dynasty.
A bas-relief preserved at Aix in Provence mentions Âasen and Ankef,\[1\]
two of the priests of Sent or Senta, the fifth king of the IInd dynasty,
about B.C. 4000; and a stele at Oxford\[2\] and another in the Egyptian
Museum at Gizeh\[3\] record the name of a third priest, Shera or Sheri,
a "royal relative" On the stele at Oxford we have represented the
deceased and his wife seated, one on each side of an altar,\[4\] which
is covered with funeral offerings of pious relatives; above, in
perpendicular lines of hieroglyphics in relief, are the names of the
objects offered,\[5\] and below is an inscription which reads,\[6\]
"thousands of loaves of bread, thousands of vases of ale, thousands of
linen garments, thousands of changes of wearing apparel, and thousands
of oxen." Now from this monument it is evident that already in the IInd
dynasty a priesthood existed in Egypt which numbered among its members
relatives of the royal family, and that a religious system which
prescribed as a duty the providing of meat and drink offerings for the
dead was also in active operation. The offering of specific objects goes
far to prove the existence of a ritual or service wherein their
signification would be indicated; the coincidence of these words and the
prayer for "thousands of loaves of bread, thousands of vases of ale,"
etc., with the promise, "Anpu-khent-Amenta shall give thee thy thousands
of loaves of bread, thy thousands of vases of ale, thy thousands of
vessels

\[1. Wiedemann, *Aegyptische Geschichte*, p. 170. In a mastaba at
Sakkara we have a stele of Sheri, a superintendent of the priests of the
*ka*, whereon the cartouches of Sent and Per-ab-sen both occur. See
Mariette and Maspero, *Les Mastaba de l'ancien Empire*, Paris, 1882, p.
92.

monuments by Borchardt may be found in *Aeg. Zeitschrift*, Bd. XXXI., p.
i (Die Darstellung innen verzierter Schalen auf aeg. Denkmälern).

6 Among others, (1) \#\#\#, (2) \#\#\#, (3) \#\#\#, (4) \#\#\#; the word
incense is written twice, \#\#\#. Some of these appear in the lists of
offerings made for Unas (l. 147) and for Teta (11. 125, 131, 133; see
*Recueil de Travaux*, 1884, plate 2).

of unguents, thy thousands of changes of apparel, thy thousands of oxen,
and thy thousands of bullocks," enables us to recognise that ritual in
the text inscribed upon the pyramid of Teta in the Vth dynasty, from
which the above promise is taken.\[1\] Thus the traditional evidence of
the text on the coffin of Menthu-hetep and the scene on the monument of
Shera support one another, and together they prove beyond a doubt that a
form of the Book of the Dead was in use at least in the period of the
earliest dynasties, and that sepulchral ceremonies connected therewith
were duly performed.\[2\]

The Book of the Dead in the IVth dynasty.

With the IVth dynasty we have an increased number of monuments, chiefly
sepulchral, which give details as to the Egyptian sacerdotal system and
the funeral ceremonies which the priests performed.\[3\] The
inscriptions upon the earlier

\[1. \#\#\#. Teta, II. 388, 389. (*Recueil*, ed. Maspero, t. v., p. 58.)

2 The arguments brought forward here in proof of the great antiquity of
a religious system in Egypt are supplemented in a remarkable manner by
the inscriptions found in the mastaba of Seker-kha-baiu at Sakkara. Here
we have a man who, like Shera, was a "royal relative" and a priest, but
who, unlike him, exercised some of the highest functions of the Egyptian
priesthood in virtue of his title *xerp hem*. (On the \#\#\#\[\*\] see
Max Müller, *Recueil de Travaux*, t. ix., p. 166; Brugsch,
*Aegyptologie*, p. 218; and Maspero, *Un Manuel de Hiérarchie
Égyptienne*, p. 9.)

Among the offerings named in the tomb are the substances \#\#\# and
\#\#\# which are also mentioned on the stele of Shera of the IInd
dynasty, and in the texts of the VIth dynasty. But the tomb of
Seker-kha-baiu is different from any other known to us, both as regards
the form and cutting of the hieroglyphics, which are in relief, and the
way in which they are disposed and grouped. The style of the whole
monument is rude and very primitive, and it cannot be attributed to any
dynasty later than the second, or even to the second itself; it must,
therefore, have been built during the first dynasty, or in the words of
MM. Mariette and Maspero, "L'impression générale que l'on reçoit au
premier aspect du tombeau No. 5, est celle d'une extrême antiquité. Rien
en effet de ce que nous sommes habitués à voir dans les autres tombeaux
ne se retrouve ici . . . Le monument . . . . est certainement le plus
ancien de ceux que nous connaissons dans la plaine de Saqqarah, et il
n'y a pas de raison pour qu'il ne soit pas de la I<sup>re</sup>
Dynastie." *Les Mastaba de l'ancien Empire*; Paris, 1882, p. 73. Because
there is no incontrovertible proof that this tomb belongs to the Ist
dynasty, the texts on the stele of Shera, a monument of a later dynasty,
have been adduced as the oldest evidences of the antiquity of a fixed
religious system and literature in Egypt.

3\. Many of the monuments commonly attributed to this dynasty should

monuments prove that many of the priestly officials were still relatives
of the royal family, and the tombs of feudal lords, scribes, and others,
record a number of their official titles, together with the names of
several of their religious festivals. The subsequent increase in the
number of the monuments during this period may be due to the natural
development of the religion of the time, but it is very probable that
the greater security of life and property which had been assured by the
vigorous wars of Seneferu,\[1\] the first king of this dynasty, about
B.C. 3766, encouraged men to incur greater expense, and to build larger
and better abodes for the dead, and to celebrate the full ritual at the
prescribed festivals. In this dynasty the royal dead were honoured with
sepulchral monuments of a greater size and magnificence than had ever
before been contemplated, and the chapels attached to the pyramids were
served by courses of priests whose sole duties consisted in celebrating
the services. The fashion of building a pyramid instead of the
rectangular flat-roofed mastaba for a royal tomb was revived by
Seneferu,\[2\] who called his pyramid Kha; and his example was followed
by his immediate successors, Khufu (Cheops), Khaf-Ra (Chephren),
Men-kau-Ra (Mycerinus), and others.

Revision of certain chapters in the IVth dynasty.

In the reign of Mycerinus some important work seems to have been under
taken in connection with certain sections of the text of the Book of the
Dead, for the rubrics of Chapters XXXB. and CXLVIII.\[3\] state that
these compositions were found inscribed upon "a block of iron(?) of the
south in letters of real lapis-lazuli under the feet of the majesty of
the god in the time of the King it of the North and South Men-kau-Ra, by
the royal son Herutataf, triumphant." That a new impulse should be given
to religious observances, and that the revision of existing religious
texts should take place in the reign of Mycerinus, was only to be
expected if Greek tradition may be believed, for both Herodotus and
Diodorus Siculus represent him as a just king, and one who was anxious
to efface from the minds of the people the memory of the alleged cruelty
of his

\[1. He conquered the peoples in the Sinaitic peninsula, and according
to a text of a later date he built a wall to keep out the Aamu from
Egypt. In the story of Saneha a "pool of Seneferu" is mentioned, which
shows that his name was well known on the frontiers of Egypt. See
Golénischeff, *Aeg. Zeitschrift*, p. 110; Maspero, *Mélanges
d'Archéologie*, t. iii., Paris, 1876, p. 71, 1. 2; Lepsius, *Denkmäler*,

Seneferu, but the excavations made there in 1882 did nothing to clear up
the uncertainty which exists on this point; for recent excavations see

predecessor by re-opening the temples and by letting every man celebrate
his own sacrifices and discharge his own religious duties.\[1\] His
pyramid is the one now known as the "third pyramid of Gizeh," under
which he was buried in a chamber vertically below the apex and 60 feet
below the level of the ground. Whether the pyramid was finished or
not\[2\] when the king died, his body was certainly laid in it, and
notwithstanding all the attempts made by the Muhammadan rulers of
Egypt\[3\] to destroy it at the end of the 12th century of our era, it
has survived to yield up important facts for the history of the Book of
the Dead.

Evidence of the Inscription on the coffin of Mycerinus.

In 1837 Colonel Howard Vyse succeeded in forcing the entrance. On the
29th of July he commenced operations, and on the 1st of August he made
his way into the sepulchral chamber, where, however, nothing was found
but a rectangular stone sarcophagous\[4\] without the lid. The large
stone slabs of the floor and the linings of the wall had been in many
instances removed by thieves in search of treasure. In a lower chamber,
connected by a passage with the sepulchral chamber, was found the
greater part of the lid of the sarcophagus,\[5\] together with portions
of a wooden coffin, and part of the body of a man, consisting of ribs
and vertebrae and the bones of the legs and feet, enveloped

\[1. Herodotus, ii., 129, 1; Diodorus, i., 64, 9.

2\. According to Diodorus, he died before it was completed (i., 64, 7).

3\. According to 'Abd el-Latif the Khalif's name was Mâmûn, but M. de
Sacy doubted that he was the first to attempt this work; the authorities
on the subject are all given in his *Relation de l'Égypte*, Paris, 1810,
p. 215-221. Tradition, as represented in the "Arabian Nights," says that
Al-Mâmûn was minded to pull down the Pyramids, and that he expended a
mint of money in the attempt; he succeeded, however, only in opening up
a small tunnel in one of them, wherein it is said he found treasure to
the exact amount of the moneys which he had spent in the work, and
neither more nor less. The Arabic writer Idrîsî, who wrote about A.H.
623 (A.D. 1226), states that a few years ago the "Red Pyramid," *i.e.*,
that of Mycerinus, was opened on the north side. After passing through
various passages a room was reached wherein was found a long blue
vessel, quite empty. The opening into this pyramid was effected by
people who were in search of treasure; they worked at it with axes for
six months, and they were in great numbers. They found in this basin,
after they had broken the covering of it, the decayed remains of a man,
but no treasures, excepting some golden tablets inscribed with
characters of a language which nobody could understand. Each man's share
of these tablets amounted to one hundred dinars (about £50). Other
legendary history says that the western pyramid contains thirty chambers
of parti-coloured syenite full of precious gems and costly weapons
anointed with unguents that they may not rust until the day of the
Resurrection. See Howard Vyse, *The Pyramids of Gizeh*, vol. ii., pp.
71, 72; and Burton, *The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night*; 1885,
vol. v., p. 105, and vol. x., p. 150.

sarcophagus is exhibited in the British Museum, First Egyptian Room,
Case A, No. 6646.

5 With considerable difficulty this interesting monument was brought out
from the pyramid by Mr. Raven, and having been cased in strong timbers,
was sent off to the British Museum. It was embarked at Alexandria in the
autumn of 1838, on board a merchant ship, which was supposed to have
been lost off Carthagena, as she never was heard of after her departure
from Leghorn on the 12th of October in that year, and as some parts of
the wreck were picked up near the former port. The sarcophagus is
figured by Vyse, Pyramids, vol. ii., plate facing p. 84.\]

in a coarse woollen cloth of a yellow colour, to which a small quantity
of resinous substance and gum adhered.\[1\] It would therefore seem
that, as the sarcophagus could not be removed, the wooden case alone
containing the body had been brought into the large apartment for
examination. Now, whether the human remains' there found are those of
Mycerinus or of some one else, as some have suggested, in no way affects
the question of the ownership of the coffin, for we know by the
hieroglyphic inscription upon it that it was made to hold the mummified
body of the king. This inscription, which is arranged in two
perpendicular lines down the front of the coffin reads:--\[3\]

Ausar suten net\[4\] Men-kau-Ra anx t'etta mes en pet aur

King of the North and South Men-kau-Ra, living for ever, born of heaven,
conceived of

Nut a a en Seb\[5\] mer-f peses-s mut-k Nut her-k

Nut, heir of Seb, his beloved. Spreadeth she thy mother Nut over thee

\[1. As a considerable misapprehension about the finding of these
remains has existed, the account of the circumstances under which they
were discovered will be of interest. "Sir, by your request, I send you
the particulars of the finding of the bones, mummy-cloth, and parts of
the coffin in the Third Pyramid. In clearing the rubbish out of the
large entrance-room, after the men had been employed there several days
and had advanced some distance towards the south-eastern corner, some
bones were first discovered at the bottom of the rubbish; and the
remaining bones and parts of the coffin were immediately discovered all
together. No other parts of the coffin or bones could be found in the
room; I therefore had the rubbish which had been previously turned out
of the same room carefully re-examined, when several pieces of the
coffin and of the mummy-cloth were found; but in no other part of the
pyramid were any parts of it to be discovered, although every place was
most minutely examined, to make the coffin as complete as possible.
There was about three feet of rubbish on the top of the same; and from
the circumstance of the bones and part of the coffin being all found
together, it appeared as if the coffin had been brought to that spot and
there unpacked.--H. Raven." Vyse, *Pyramids*, vol. ii., p. 86.

fragments of the coffin in Wall Case No. 1 (No. 6647) in the same room.

Now it is to be noted that the passage, "Thy mother Nut spreadeth
herself over thee in her name of 'Mystery of Heaven,' she granteth that
thou mayest be without enemies," occurs in the texts which are inscribed
upon the pyramids built by the kings of the VIth dynasty,\[1\] and thus
we have evidence of the use of the same version of one religious text
both in the IVth and in the VIth dynasties.\[2\]

Even if we were to admit that the coffin is a forgery of the XXVIth
dynasty, and that the inscription upon it was taken from an edition of
the text of the Book of the Dead, still the value of the monument as an
evidence of the antiquity of the Book of the Dead is scarcely impaired,
for those who added the inscription would certainly have chosen it from
a text of the time of Mycerinus.

The Book of the Dead in the Vth dynasty.

In the Vth dynasty we have--in an increased number of mastabas and other
monuments--evidence of the extension of religious ceremonials, including
the

etc.

2\. So far back as 1883, M. Maspero, in lamenting (Guide du Visiteur de
Boulaq, p. 310) the fact that the Bûlâq Museum possessed only portions
of wooden coffins of the Ancient Empire and no complete example, noticed
that the coffin of Mycerinus, preserved in the British Museum, had been
declared by certain Egyptologists to be a "restoration" of the XXVIth
dynasty, rather than the work of the IVth dynasty, in accordance with
the inscription upon it; but like Dr. Birch he was of opinion that the
coffin certainly belonged to the IVth dynasty, and adduced in support of
his views the fact of the existence of portions of a similar coffin of
Seker-em-sa-f, a king of the VIth dynasty. Recently, however, an attempt
has again been made (*Aeg. Zeitschrift*, Bd. XXX., p. 94 ff.) to prove
by the agreement of the variants in the text on the coffin of Mycerinus
with those of texts of the XXVIth dynasty, that the Mycerinus text is of
this late period, or at all events not earlier than the time of
Psammetichus. But it is admitted on all hands that in the XXVIth dynasty
the Egyptians resuscitated texts of the first dynasties of the Early
Empire, and that they copied the arts and literature of that period as
far as possible, and, this being so, the texts on the monuments which
have been made the standard of comparison for that on the coffin of
Mycerinus may be themselves at fault in their variants. If the text on
the cover could be proved to differ as much from an undisputed IVth
dynasty text as it does from those even of the VIth dynasty, the
philological argument might have some weight; but even this would not
get rid of the fact that the cover itself is a genuine relic of the IVth
dynasty.\]

celebration of funeral rites; but a text forming the Book of the Dead as
a whole does not occur until the reign of Unas (B.C. 3333), the last
king of the dynasty, who according to the Turin papyrus reigned thirty
years. This monarch built on the plain of Sakkâra a stone pyramid about
sixty-two feet high, each side measuring about two hundred feet at the
base. In the time of Perring and Vyse it was surrounded by heaps of
broken stone and rubbish, the result of repeated attempts to open it,
and with the casing stones, which consisted of compact limestone from
the quarries of Tura.\[1\] In February, 1881, M. Maspero began to clear
the pyramid, and soon after he succeeded in making an entrance into the
innermost chambers, the walls of which were covered with hieroglyphic
inscriptions, arranged in perpendicular lines and painted in green.\[2\]
The condition of the interior showed that at some time or other thieves
had already succeeded in making an entrance, for the cover of the black
basalt sarcophagus of Unas had been wrenched off and moved near the door
of the sarcophagus chamber; the paving stones had been pulled up in the
vain attempt to find buried treasure; the mummy had been broken to
pieces, and nothing remained of it except the right arm, a tibia, and
some fragments of the skull and body. The inscriptions which covered
certain walls and corridors in the tomb were afterwards published by M.
Maspero.\[3\] The appearance of the text of Unas\[4\] marks an era in
the history of the Book of the Dead, and its translation must be
regarded as one of the greatest triumphs of Egyptological decipherment,
for the want of determinatives in many places in the text, and the
archaic spelling of many of the words and passages presented
difficulties which were not easily overcome.\[6\] Here, for the first
time, it was shown that the Book of the Dead was no compilation of a
comparatively late period in the history of Egyptian civilization, but a
work belonging to a very remote antiquity; and it followed naturally
that texts which were then known, and which were thought to be
themselves original ancient texts, proved to be only versions which had
passed through two or more successive revisions.

inscribed with religious texts similar to those found in the pyramid of
Unas, and translated certain passages (Aeg. Zeitschrift, Bd., xix., pp.
1-15); see also Birch in Trans. Son Bibl. Arch., 1881, p. iii ff.

5 The pyramid which bore among the Arabs the name of *Mastabat
el-Far'ûn*, or "Pharaoh's Bench," was excavated by Mariette in 1858,
and, because he found the name of Unas painted on certain blocks of
stone, he concluded that it was the tomb of Unas. M. Maspero's
excavations have, as Dr. Lepsius observes (*Aeg. Zeitschrift*, Bd. XIX.,
p. 15), set the matter right.\]

{p. xxiii}

The Book of the Dead in the VIth dynasty

Evidence of the text of the pyramid of Teta;

Continuing his excavations at Sakkâra, M. Maspero opened the pyramid Of
Teta,\[1\] king of Egypt about B.C. 3300, which Vyse thought\[2\] had
never been entered, and of which, in his day, the masonry on one side
only could be seen. Here again it was found that thieves had already
been at work, and that they had smashed in pieces walls, floors, and
many other parts of the chambers in their frantic search for treasure.
As in the case of the pyramid of Unas, certain chambers, etc., of this
tomb were found covered with inscriptions in hieroglyphics, but of a
smaller size.\[3\] A brief examination of the text showed it to be
formed of a series of extracts from the Book of the Dead, some of which
were identical with those in the pyramid of Unas. Thus was brought to
light a Book of the Dead of the time of the first king 4 of the VIth
dynasty.

and of the pyramid of Pepi I., Mer-en-Ra, and Pepi II.

The pyramid of Pepi I., king of Egypt about B.C. 3233, was next
opened.\[5\] It is situated in the central group at Sakkâra, and is
commonly known as the pyramid of Shêkh Abu-Mansûr.\[6\] Certain chambers
and other parts of the tomb were found to be covered with hieroglyphic
texts, which not only repeated in part those which had been found in the
pyramids of Unas and Teta, but also contained a considerable number of
additional sections of the Book of the Dead.\[7\] In the same
neighbourhood M. Maspero, cleared out the pyramid of Mer-en-Ra, the
fourth king of the VIth dynasty, about B.C. 3200;\[8\] and the pyramid
of Pepi II., the fifth king of the VIth dynasty, about B.C. 3166.\[9\]

\[1. The mummy of the king had been taken out of the sarcophagus through
a hole which the thieves had made in it; it was broken by them in
pieces, and the only remains of it found by M. Maspero consisted of an
arm and shoulder. Parts of the wooden coffin are preserved in the Gizeh
Museum.

clearance of sand was not effected until early in 1881.

pp. 87-120, Paris, 1886.

8\. It was opened early in January, 1880, by Mariette, who seeing that
the sarcophagus chamber was inscribed, abandoned his theory that
pyramids never contained inscriptions, or that if they did they were not
royal tombs. The hieroglyphic texts were published by Maspero in
*Recueil de Travaux*, t. ix., pp. 177-91, Paris, 1887; t. X, pp. 1-29,
Paris, 1388; and t. xi., pp. 1-31, Paris, 1889. The alabaster vase in
the British Museum, NQ 4493, came from this pyramid.

9\. This pyramid is a little larger than the others of the period, and
is built in steps of small stones; it is commonly called by the Arabs
*Haram el Mastabat*, because it is near the building usually called
*Mastabat el-Far'ûn*. See Vyse, *Pyramids*, vol. iii., p. 52. The
hieroglyphic texts are published by Maspero in *Recueil de Travaux*, t.
xii., pp. 53-95, and pp. 136-95, Paris, 1892; and t. xiv., pp. 125-52,
Paris, 1892. There is little doubt that this pyramid was broken into
more than once in Christian times, and that the early collectors of
Egyptian antiquities obtained the beautiful alabaster vases inscribed
with the cartouches and titles of Pepi II. from those who had access to
the sarcophagus chamber. Among such objects in the British Museum
collection, Nos. 4492, 22,559, 22,758 and 22,817 are fine examples.\]

{p. xxiv}

Summary of the monumental evidence.

Thus we have before the close of the VIth dynasty five copies of a
series of texts which formed the Book of the Dead of that period, and an
extract from a well-known passage of that work on the wooden coffin of
Mycerinus; we have also seen from a number of mastabas and stelæ that
the funeral ceremonies connected with the Book of the Dead were
performed certainly in the IInd, and with almost equal certainty in the
Ist dynasty. It is easy to show that certain sections of the Book of the
Dead of this period were copied and used in the following dynasties down
to a period about A.D. 200.

The Book of the Dead a collection of separate works.

The fact that not only in the pyramids of Unas and Teta, but also in
those of Pepi I. and his immediate successors, we find selected
passages, suggests that the Book of the Dead was, even in those early
times, so extensive that even a king was fain to make from it a
selection only of the passages which suited his individual taste or were
considered sufficient to secure his welfare in the next world. In the
pyramids of Teta, Pepi I., Mer-en-Ra and Pepi II. are found many texts
which are identical with those employed by their predecessors, and an
examination of the inscription of Pepi II. will show that about
three-fourths of the whole may be found in the monuments of his
ancestors. What principle guided each king in the selection of his
texts, or whether the additions in each represent religious
developments, it is impossible to say; but, as the Egyptian religion
cannot have remained stationary in every particular, it is probable that
some texts reflect the changes in the opinions of the priests upon
matters of doctrine.\[1\] The "Pyramid Texts" prove that each section of
the religious books of the Egyptians was originally a separate and
independent composition, that it was written with a definite object, and
that it might be arranged in any order in a series of similar texts.
What preceded or what followed it was never taken into

\[1. A development has been observed in the plan of ornamenting the
interiors of the pyramids of the Vth and VIth dynasties. In that of Unas
about one-quarter of the sarcophagus chamber is covered with
architectural decorations, and the hieroglyphics are large, well spaced,
and enclosed in broad lines. But as we advance in the VIth dynasty, the
space set apart for decorative purposes becomes less, the hieroglyphics
are smaller, the lines are crowded, and the inscriptions overflow into
the chambers and corridors, which in the Vth dynasty were left blank.
See Maspero in *Revue des Religions*, t. xi., p. 124.\]

{p. xxv}

consideration by the scribe, although it seems, at times, as if
traditions had assigned a sequence to certain texts.

Historical reference.

That events of contemporary history were sometimes reflected in the Book
of the Dead of the early dynasties is proved by the following. We learn
from the inscription upon the tomb of Heru-khuf at Aswân,\[l\] that this
governor of Elephantine was ordered to bring for king Pepi II.\[2\] a
pigmy,\[3\] from the interior of Africa, to dance before the king and
amuse him; and he was promised that, if he succeeded in bringing the
pigmy alive and in good health, his majesty would confer upon him a
higher rank and dignity than that which king Assa conferred upon his
minister Ba-ur-Tettet, who performed this much appreciated service for
his master.\[4\] Now Assa was the eighth king of the Vth dynasty, and
Pepi II. was the fifth king of the VIth dynasty, and between the reigns
of these kings there was, according to M. Maspero, an interval of at
least sixty-four, but more probably eighty, years. But in the text in
the pyramid of Pepi I., which must have been drafted at some period
between the reigns of these kings, we have the passage, "Hail thou who
\[at thy will\] makest to pass over to the Field of Aaru the soul that
is right and true, or dost make shipwreck of it. Ra-meri (*i.e.*, Pepi
I.) is right and true in respect of heaven and in respect of earth, Pepi
is right and true in respect of the island of the earth whither he
swimmeth and where he arriveth. He who is between the thighs of Nut
(*i.e.*, Pepi) is the pigmy who danceth \[like\] the god, and who
pleaseth the heart

Scienze Morali, etc., t. x., Rome, 1893, pp. 22-53. This text has been
treated by Erman (*Z.D.M.G.*, Bd. XLVI., 1892, p. 574 ff.), who first
pointed out the reference to the pigmy in the pyramid texts, and by
Maspero in Revue Critique, Paris, 1892, p. 366.

ff. That the pigmies paid tribute to the Egyptians is certain from the
passage "The pigmies came to him from the lands of the south having
things of service for his palace"; see Dümichen, *Geschichte des alten
Aegyptens*, Berlin, 1887, p. 7.

of the god \[Osiris\] before his great throne. . . . The two beings who
are over the throne of the great god proclaim Pepi to be sound and
healthy, \[therefore\] Pepi shall sail in the boat to the beautiful
field of the great god, and he shall do therein that which is done by
those to whom veneration is due."\[1\] Here clearly we have a reference
to the historical fact of the importation of a pigmy from the regions
south of Nubia; and the idea which seems to have been uppermost in the
mind of him that drafted the text was that as the pigmy pleased the king
for whom he was brought in this world, even so might the dead Pepi
please the god Osiris\[2\] in the next world. As the pigmy was brought
by boat to the king, so might Pepi be brought by boat to the island
wherein the god dwelt; as the conditions made by the king were fulfilled
by him that brought the pigmy, even so might the conditions made by
Osiris concerning the dead be fulfilled by him that transported Pepi to
his presence. The wording of the passage amply justifies the assumption
that this addition was made to the text after the mission of Assa, and
during the VIth dynasty.\[3\]

Authorship of the Book of the Dead.

Like other works of a similar nature, however, the pyramid texts afford
us no information as to their authorship. In the later versions of the
Book of the Dead certain chapters\[4\] are stated to be the work of the
god Thoth. They certainly belong to that class of literature which the
Greeks called "Hermetic,"\[5\] and it is pretty certain that under some
group they were included in the list of the forty-two works which,
according to Clement of Alexandria,\[6\] constituted the sacred books of
the Egyptians.\[7\] As Thoth, whom the Greeks called Hermes, is in
Egyptian texts styled "lord of divine books,"\[8\] "scribe of the
company of the gods,"\[9\] and "lord of divine speech,"\[10\] this
ascription is well founded. The

Satyrs, who are referred to by Diodorus (i., XVIII) as the companions
and associates of Osiris in Ethiopia, have their origin in the pigmies.

Influence of the priests of Annu on its compilation.

pyramid texts are versions of ancient religious compositions which the
priests of the college or school of Annu\[1\] succeeded in establishing
as the authorized version of the Book of the Dead in the first six
dynasties. Ra, the local form of the Sun-god, usurps the place occupied
by the more ancient form Tmu; and it would seem that when a dogma had
been promulgated by the college of Annu, it was accepted by the
priesthood of all the great cities throughout Egypt. The great influence
of the Annu school of priests even in the time of Unas is proved by the
following passage from the text in his pyramid: "O God, thy Annu is
Unas; O God, thy Annu is Unas. O Ra, Annu is Unas, thy Annu is Unas, O
Ra. The mother of Unas is Annu, the father of Unas is Annu; Unas himself
is Annu, and was born in Annu."\[2\] Elsewhere we are told that Unas
"cometh to the great bull which cometh forth from Annu,\[3\] and that he
uttereth words of magical import in Annu."\[4\] In Annu the god Tmu
produced the gods Shu and Tefnut,\[5\] and in Annu dwelt the great and
oldest company of the gods, Tmu, Shu, Tefnut, Seb, Nut, Osiris, Isis,
Set and Nephthys.\[6\] The abode of the blessed in heaven was
called\[7\] Annu, and it was asserted that the souls of

what Mecca still is to the Mubammadans, must be remembered. The heavenly
Annu was the capital of the mythological world (see Naville,
*Todtenbuch* (Einleitung), p. 27), and was, to the spirits of men, what
the earthly Annu was to their bodies, *i.e.*, the abode of the gods and
the centre and source of all divine instruction. Like many other
mythological cities, such as Abtu, Tattu, Pe, Tep, Khemennu, *etc.*, the
heavenly Annu had no geographical position.\]

the just were there united to their spiritual or glorified bodies, and
that they lived there face to face with the deity for all eternity.\[1\]
judging from the fact that the texts in the tombs of Heru-hetep and
Neferu, and those inscribed upon the sarcophagus of Taka, all of the
XIth and XIIth dynasties, differ in extent only and not in character or
contents from those of the royal pyramids of Sakkâra of the Vth and VIth
dynasties, it has been declared that the religion as well as the art of
the first Theban empire are nothing but a slavish copy of those of
northern Egypt.\[2\]

The Theban version.

The Theban version, which was much used in Upper Egypt from the XVIIIth
to the XXth dynasty, was commonly written on papyri in the hieroglyphic
character. The text is written in black ink in perpendicular rows of
hieroglyphics, which are separated from each other by black lines; the
titles of the chapters or sections, and certain parts of the chapters
and the rubrics belonging thereto, are written in red ink. A steady
development in the illumination of the vignettes is observable in the
papyri of this period. At the beginning of the XVIIIth dynasty the
vignettes are in black outline, but we see from the papyrus of Hunefer
(Brit. Mus. No. 9901), who was an overseer of cattle of Seti I., king of
Egypt about B.C. 1370, that the vignettes are painted in reds, greens,
yellows, white, and other colours, and that the whole of the text and

\[1. The importance of Annu and its gods in the VIth dynasty is well
indicated by a prayer from the pyramid of Pepi II. (for the texts see
Maspero, *Recueil*, t. x., p. 8, and t. xii., p. 146), which reads:

"Hail, ye great nine gods who dwell in Annu, grant ye that Pepi may
flourish, and grant ye that this pyramid of Pepi, this building built
for eternity, may flourish, even as the name of the god Tmu, the chief
of the great company of the nine gods, doth flourish. If the name of
Shu, the lord of the celestial shrine in Annu flourisheth, then Pepi
shall flourish, and this his pyramid shall flourish, and this his work
shall endure to all eternity. If the name of Tefnut, the lady of the
terrestrial shrine in Annu endureth, the name of Pepi shall endure, and
this pyramid shall endure to all eternity. If the name of Seb . . . . .
flourisheth the name of Pepi shall flourish, and this pyramid shall
flourish, and this his work shall endure to all eternity. If the name of
Nut flourisheth in the temple of Shenth in Annu, the name of Pepi shall
flourish, and this pyramid shall flourish, and this his work shall
endure to all eternity. If the name of Osiris flourisheth in This, the
name of Pepi shall flourish, and this pyramid shall flourish, and this
his work shall endure to all eternity. If the name of Osiris
Khent-Amenta flourisheth, the name of Pepi shall flourish, and this
pyramid shall flourish, and this his work shall endure to all eternity.
If the name of Set flourisheth in Nubt, the name of Pepi shall flourish,
and this pyramid shall flourish, and this his work shall endure to all
eternity."

Palæography of the version.

vignettes are enclosed in a red and yellow border. Originally the text
was the most important part of the work, and both it and its vignettes
were the work of the scribe; gradually, however, the brilliantly
illuminated vignettes were more and more cared for, and when the skill
of the scribe failed, the artist was called in. In many fine papyri of
the Theban period it is altar that the whole plan of the vignettes of a
papyrus was set out by artists, who often failed to leave sufficient
space for the texts to which they belonged; in consequence many lines of
chapters are often omitted, and the last few lines of some texts are so
much crowded as to be almost illegible. The frequent clerical errors
also show that while an artist of the greatest skill might be employed
on the vignettes, the execution of the text was left to an ignorant or
careless scribe. Again, the artist at times arranged his vignettes in
wrong order, and it is occasionally evident that neither artist nor
scribe understood the matter upon which he was engaged. According to M.
Maspero\[1\] the scribes of the VIth dynasty did not understand the
texts which they were drafting, and in the XIXth dynasty the scribe of a
papyrus now preserved at Berlin knew or cared so little about the text
which he was copying that he transcribed the LXXVIIth Chapter from the
wrong end, and apparently never discovered his error although he
concluded the chapter with its title.\[2\] Originally each copy of the
Book of the Dead was written to order, but soon the custom obtained of
preparing copies with blank spaces in which the name of the purchaser
might be inserted; and many of the errors in spelling and most of the
omissions of words are no doubt due to the haste with which such "stock"
copies were written by the members of the priestly caste, whose
profession it was to copy them.

Theban papyri.

The papyri upon which copies of the Theban version were written vary in
length from about 20 to go feet, and in width from 14 to 18 inches; in
the XVIIIth dynasty the layers of the papyrus are of a thicker texture
and of a darker colour than in the succeeding dynasties. The art of
making great lengths of papyrus of light colour and fine texture
attained its highest perfection in the XIXth dynasty. An examination of
Theban papyri shows that the work of writing and illuminating a fine
copy of the Book of the Dead was frequently distributed between two or
more groups of artists and scribes, and that the sections were
afterwards joined up into a whole. Occasionally by error two groups of
men would transcribe the same chapter; hence in the papyrus of Ani,
Chapter XVIII. occurs twice (see within, p. cxlviii.).

Selection and arrangement of chapters.

The sections or chapters of the Theban version are a series of separate
and distinct compositions, which, like the sections of the pyramid
texts, had no fixed order either on coffins or in papyri. Unlike these
texts, however, with very few exceptions each composition had a special
title and vignette which indicate its purpose. The general selection of
the chapters for a papyrus seems to have been left to the individual
fancy of the purchaser or scribe, but certain of them were no doubt
absolutely necessary for the preservation of the body of the deceased in
the tomb, and for the welfare of his soul in its new state of existence.
Traditional selections would probably be respected, and recent
selections approved by any dominant school of religious thought in Egypt
were without doubt accepted.

Change in forms.

While in the period of the pyramid texts the various sections were said
or sung by priests, probably assisted by some members of the family of
the deceased, the welfare of his soul and body being proclaimed for him
as an established fact in the Theban version the hymns and prayers to
the gods were put into the mouth of the deceased. As none but the great
and wealthy could afford the ceremonies which were performed in the
early dynasties, economy was probably the chief cause of this change,
which had come about at Thebes as early as the XIIth dynasty. Little by
little the ritual portions of the Book of the Dead disappeared, until
finally, in the Theban version, the only chapters of this class which
remain are the XXIInd, XXIIIrd, CVth, and CLIst.\[1\] Every chapter and
prayer of this version was to be said in the next world, where the
words, properly uttered, enabled the deceased to overcome every foe and
to attain to the life of the perfected soul which dwelt in a spiritual
body in the abode of the blessed.

Theban title of the Book of the Dead.

The common name for the Book of the Dead in the Theban period, and
probably also before this date, is *per em hru*, which words have been
variously translated manifested in the light," "coming forth from the
day," coming forth by day," "la manifestation au jour," "la
manifestation à la lumière," \[Kapitel von\] der Erscheinung im Lichte,"
"Erscheinen am Tage," "\[Caput\] egrediendi in lucem," *etc.* This name,
however, had probably a meaning for the Egyptians which has not yet been
rendered in a modern language, and one important idea in connection with
the whole work is expressed by another title\[2\] which calls it "the
chapter of making strong (or perfect) the Khu."

\[1. See Naville, *Todtenbuch* (Einleitung), p. 20. On the titles "Book
of the Dead" and "Ritual Funéraire" which have been given to these
texts, see Lepsius, *Todtenbuch*, p. 3; De Rougé, *Revue Archéologique*,
N.S., t. i., 1860, pp. 69-100.

Continuity of doctrine

In the Theban version the main principles of the Egyptian religion which
were held in the times when the pyramid texts were written are
maintained, and the views concerning the eternal existence of the soul
remain unaltered. Many passages in the work, however, show that
modifications and developments in details have taken place, and much
that is not met with in the early dynasties appears, so far as we know,
for the first time. The vignettes too are additions to the work; but,
although they depict scenes in the life beyond the grave, they do not
seem to form a connected series, and it is doubtful if they are arranged
on any definite plan. A general idea of the contents of this version may
be gathered from the following list of chapters\[1\]:--

Chapter I. Here begin the Chapters of "Coming forth by day," and of the

Lepsius' numbers are retained, and the chapters which belong to the
Saïte version are indicated by an asterisk. For the hieroglyphic text

The version akin to the Theban.

Palæography.

The version akin to was in vogue from the XXth to the XXVIth dynasty,
*i.e.*, about B.C. 1200-550, and was, like the Theban, usually written
upon papyrus. The chapters have no fixed order, and are written in lines
in the hieratic character; the rubrics, catchwords, and certain names,
like that of Apep, are in red. The vignettes are roughly traced in black
outline, and are without ornament; but at the ends of the best papyri
well-painted scenes, in which the deceased is depicted making adoration
to Ra or Horus, are frequently found. The names and titles of the
deceased are written in perpendicular rows of hieroglyphics. The
character of the handwriting changes in different periods: in the
papyrus of the Princess Nesi-Khonsu (about B.C. 1000) it is bold and
clear, and much resembles the handsome style of that found in the great
Harris papyrus;\[1\] but within a hundred years, apparently, the fine
flowing style disappears, and the writing becomes much smaller and is
somewhat cramped; the process of reduction in size continues until the
XXVIth dynasty, about B.C. 550, when the small and coarsely written
characters are frequently difficult to decipher. The papyri upon which
such texts are written vary in length from three to about thirty feet,
and in width from nine to eighteen inches; as we approach the period of
the XXVIth dynasty the texture becomes coarser and the material is
darker in colour. The Theban papyri of this period are lighter in colour
than those found in the north of Egypt and are less brittle; they
certainly suffer less in unrolling.

\[1. The Books of the Dead written in the hieroglyphic and hieratic
characters which belong to the period of the rule of the priest-kings of
the brotherhood of Amen form a class by themselves, and have relatively
little in common with the older versions. A remarkable example of this
class is the papyrus of Nesi-Khonsu which M. Maspero published (*Les
Momies Royales de Déir el-baharî*, p. 600 f.). The text is divided into
paragraphs, which contain neither prayers nor hymns but a veritable
contract between the god Amen-Ra and the princess Nesi-Khonsu. After the
list of the names and titles of Amen-Ra with which it begins follow
eleven sections wherein the god declares in legal phraseology that he
hath deified the princess in Amenta and in Neter-khert; that he hath
deified her soul and her body in order that neither may be destroyed;
that he hath made her divine like every god and goddess; and that he
hath decreed that whatever is necessary for her in her new existence
shall be done for her, even as it is done for every other god and
goddess.\]

{p. xlvii}

The Saïte and Ptolemaic version.

Palæography.

The Saïte and Ptolemaic version was in vogue from the period of the
XXVIth dynasty, about B.C. 550, to probably the end of the rule of the
Ptolemies over Egypt. The chapters have a fixed and definite order, and
it seems that a careful revision of the whole work was carried out, and
that several alterations of an important nature were made in it. A
number of chapters which are not found in older papyri appear during
this period; but these are not necessarily new inventions, for, as the
kings of the XXVIth dynasty are renowned for having revived the arts and
sciences and literature of the earliest dynasties, it is quite possible
that many or most of the additional chapters are nothing more than new
editions of extracts from older works. Many copies of this version were
written by scribes who did not understand what they were copying, and
omissions of signs, words, and even whole passages are very common; in
papyri of the Ptolemaic period it is impossible to read many passages
without the help of texts of earlier periods. The papyri of this period
vary in colour from a light to a dark brown, and consist usually of
layers composed of strips of the plant measuring about 2 inches in width
and 14½ to 16 inches in length. Fine examples of Books of the Dead of
this version vary in length from about 24½ feet (B.M. No. 10,479,
written for the *utcheb* Heru, the son of the *utcheb* Tchehra) to 60
feet. Hieroglyphic texts are written in black, in perpendicular rows
between rules, and hieratic texts in horizontal lines; both the
hieroglyphics and the hieratic characters lack the boldness of the
writing of the Theban period, and exhibit the characteristics of a
conventional hand. The titles of the chapters, catchwords, the words
\#\#\# which introduce a variant reading, *etc.*, are sometimes written
in red. The vignettes are usually traced in black outline, and form a
kind of continuous border above the text. In good papyri, however, the
scene forming the XVIth Chapter, the scene of the Fields of Peace
(Chapter CX.), the judgment scene (Chapter CXXV.), the vignette of
Chapter CXLVIII., the scene forming Chapter CLI. (the sepulchral
chamber), and the vignette of Chapter CLXI., fill the whole width of the
inscribed portion of the papyrus, and are painted in somewhat crude
colours. In some papyri the disk on the head of the hawk of Horus is
covered with gold leaf, instead of being painted red as is usual in
older papyri. In the Græco-Roman period both texts and vignettes are
very carelessly executed, and it is evident that they were written and
drawn by ignorant workmen in the quickest and most careless way
possible. In this period also certain passages of the text were copied
in hieratic and Demotic upon small pieces of papyri which were buried
with portions of the bodies of the dead, and upon narrow bandages of
coarse linen in which they were swathed.
