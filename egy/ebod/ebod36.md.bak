# PLATES XXXI. AND XXXII.

Vignettes: The Hall of Double Right and Truth, wherein Ani has to
address severally the forty-two gods, who are seated in a row in the
middle of the, hall. At each end is a door that on the right is called
"Neb-Maat-heri-tep-retui-f" and that on the left
"Neb-pehti-thesu-menment." On the centre of the roof, which is crowned
with

{p. 347}

a series of uræi and feathers emblematic of Maat, is a seated deity with
hands extended, the right over the eye of Horus and the left over a pool
(see the Vignette of Plate VIII. above, p. 278).\[1\] On the right, at
the end of the hall (Plate XXXII.), are four small vignettes, in which
are depicted: (1) Two seated figures of the goddess Maat, with
emblematic of Right and Truth, on the head, and sceptres and emblems of
life in the right and left hands. (2) Osiris, seated, wearing the *atef*
crown, and holding in his hands the crook and flail. Before him, by the
side of an altar of offerings, stands Ani, with both hands raised in
adoration. (3) A balance with the heart, symbolizing the conscience of
Ani, in one scale, and emblematic of Right and Truth, in the other.
Beside the balance is the tri-formed monster Amemit. (4) Thoth,
ibis-headed, seated on a pylon-shaped pedestal, painting a large feather
of Maat.
