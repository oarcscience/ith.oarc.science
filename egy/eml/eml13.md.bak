WHEN the great pyramids were being erected Egypt was already a land of
ancient memories. Some of the royal tombs at Abydos were a thousand
years old. Folk tales had gathered round the memories of notable kings;
their order was confused and not a few were quite forgotten.

Zoser and Sneferu of the Third Dynasty are really the first Egyptian
monarchs of whom we obtain any accurate idea. They were forceful
personalities. We trace Zoser's activities in Sinai, where he continued
to work the copper mines from which several of his predecessors had
obtained supplies of indispensable metal. He waged war on the southern
frontier, which he extended below the First Cataract, and he imposed his
rule firmly over the north. That peace prevailed all over the kingdom is
evident; otherwise he could not have devoted so much time to the
erection of his great tomb, at which a great army of workmen were kept
continuously employed.

Sneferu, whose very name suggests swiftness of

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

decision and unswerving purpose, impressed himself on the imagination of
the Egyptians for many generations. When a great national achievement
was accomplished it became customary to remark that no such success had
been attained "since the days of Sneferu". He battled against Asian
hordes who invaded the Delta region, and erected forts, like a chain of
blockhouses, across the frontier, and these were associated with his
name for over ten centuries. In Sinai there was trouble regarding the
copper mines. Other people had begun to work them and disputed right of
possession with the Egyptians. Sneferu conducted a vigorous and
successful campaign, and so firmly established his power in that region
that his spirit was worshipped generations afterwards as the protecting
god of the mines. His ambitions were not confined to land, for he caused
great ships to be built and he traded with Crete and the Syrian coast.
The cedars of Lebanon were then cut and drifted to the Nile by Egyptian
mariners. In the south Nubia was dealt with firmly. We gather that
thousands of prisoners were captured and taken north as slaves to be
employed, apparently, at the building of temples and tombs. Two pyramids
are attributed to Sneferu, the greatest of which is situated at Medum.

The power and wealth of the officials had increased greatly. Their
mastabas, which surround the royal tombs, are of greater and more
elaborate construction. Pharaoh was no longer hampered with the details
of government. A Grand Vizier controlled the various departments of
State, and he was the supreme judge to whom final appeals were made by
the Courts. There were also a "Chancellor of the Exchequer" and
officials who controlled the canals and secured an equitable
distribution of water. There were governors of nomes and towns,

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

and even villages had their "chief men". To secure the effective control
of the frontier, always threatened by raids from Nubia, a local vizier
was appointed to quell outbreaks, and troops were placed at his
disposal. These high offices were usually held by princes and noblemen,
but apparently it was possible for men of humble rank to attain
distinction and be promoted, like Joseph, to positions of influence and
responsibility. In mastaba chapels there are proud records of promotion
acquired by capable and successful officials who began life as scribes
and were governors ere they died.

The Fourth Dynasty begins with Khufu the Great, the Cheops of the
Greeks, who erected the largest pyramid in Egypt. His relationship to
Sneferu. is uncertain. He was born in the Beni Hassan district, and was
probably the son of a nobleman of royal birth. Sneferu may have left no
direct heir or one who was a weakling. There is no record or tradition
of a revolution, and it may be that Khufu was already a prominent figure
at the Court when he seized the crown. In his harem was a lady who
enjoyed the confidence of his predecessor, and it is possible that
matters were arranged in his interests in that quarter.

No statues of Khufu survive. These were probably destroyed when, a few
centuries after his death, his tomb was raided and his mummy torn to
pieces, for he was remembered as a great tyrant. So much was he hated
that Herodotus was informed by the priests that he "degenerated into the
extremest profligacy of conduct". He barred the avenues to every temple
and forbade the Egyptians to offer sacrifices. He proceeded next to make
them labour as slaves for himself. Some he compelled to hew stones n the
quarries of the Arabian mountains and drag them to the banks of the
Nile;

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

others were selected to load vessels. . . . A hundred thousand men were
employed." But the memory of ancient wrongs was perpetuated by the
priests not merely in sympathy for the workers and those who had to bear
the burdens of taxation. A religious revolution was imminent. The sun
worshippers at Heliopolis were increasing in numbers and power, and even
in Khufu's day their political influence was being felt. In fact, their
ultimate ascendancy may have been due to the public revolt against the
selfish and tyrannical policy of the pyramid-building kings.

We enjoy a privilege not shared by Greeks or Romans, who heard the
Egyptian traditions regarding the masterful monarch. Petrie discovered
an ivory statue of Khufu, which is a minute and beautiful piece of work.
The features occupy only a quarter of an inch, and are yet animate with
life and expression. Khufu's face suggests that of the Duke of
Wellington. The nose is large and curved like an eagle's beak; the eyes
have a hard and piercing look; the cheek bones are high, the cheeks
drawn down to knotted jaws; the chin is firmly cut and the hard mouth
has an uncompromising pout; the brows are lowering. The face is that of
a thinker and man of action--an idealist and an iron-willed ruler of
men--

                            whose frown  
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command  
Tell that the sculptor well those passions read  
Which still survive

stamped on the statuette of the greatest of the pyramid builders. There
is withal an air of self-consciousness, and we seem to hear, "My name is
Khufu"--

                      . . . King of Kings;  
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Petrie, the great
Egyptian archæologist, calculates that Khufu's vast pyramid is composed
of some 2,003,000 blocks of limestone averaging about 2½ tons each. It
occupies an area of 13 acres. Each side of the square base originally
measured 768 feet, but the removal of the coating which left the sides
smooth caused a shrinkage of about 18 feet. The height is now roughly
450 feet, 30 ft. less than when it was completed.

This pyramid is the greatest pile of masonry ever erected by man. Not
only is it a monument to a mighty ruler and his great architects and
builders, but also to the stone workers of Memphis. Many of the great
stones have been cut and dressed with amazing skill and accuracy, and so
closely are they placed together that the seams have to be marked with
charcoal to be traced in a photograph. Blocks of limestone weighing tons
are finished with almost microscopic accuracy, "equal", says Petrie, "to
optician's work of the present day".

Volumes have been written to advance theories regarding the purpose of
this and other pyramids. The orientation theory has especially been
keenly debated. But it no longer obtains among prominent Egyptologists.
A pyramid has no astronomical significance whatsoever; the Egyptians
were not star worshippers. It is simply a vast burial cairn, and an
architectural development of the mastaba, which had been growing higher
and higher until Zoser's architect conceived the idea of superimposing
one upon the other until an effect was obtained which satisfied his
sense of proportion. Geometricians decided its final shape rather than
theologians.

There are several chambers in the interior of Khufu's pyramid, whose
mummy reposed in a granite sarcophagus in the largest, which is 19 feet
high, 34½ feet in length, and 17 feet in breadth. The entrance is from
the north.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Herodotus was informed by the Egyptian priests that 100,000 workers were
employed, and were relieved every three months. The limestone was
quarried on the eastern side of the Nile, below Cairo, and drifted on
rafts across the river. The low ground was flooded, so that the high
ground was made an island. We are informed that ten years were spent in
constructing a causeway up which the blocks were hauled. A considerable
time was also spent in preparing the rocky foundations. The pyramid
itself was the work of twenty years.

When the base was completed, the same writer explains, the stones were
raised by the aid of "machines" made of "short pieces of wood". Models
have been found in tombs of wooden "cradles"--flat on the top and
rounded off so that they could be rocked--on which boulders were
evidently poised and then slewed into position by haulage and leverage.
The "cradles" were raised by wedges. When the block was lifted high
enough, it could be tilted and made to slide down skids into position.
Herodotus says that according to one account the stones were elevated by
the numerous "machines" from step to step, and to another they were
lifted into position by one great contrivance. This process was
continued until the summit was reached. Then a granite casing was
constructed downward to the base, and it was covered over with
hieroglyphics which recorded the various sums of money expended for food
supplied to the workers. "Cheops (Khufu) exhausted his wealth", adds
Herodotus.

The royal exchequer does not appear to have been depleted, because Khufu
also erected three smaller pyramids for members of his family, and his
successor afterwards undertook the construction of a vast tomb also.

Apart from his pyramid work we know little or

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

nothing regarding the events of Khufu's reign. Sneferu's military
activities had secured peace on the frontiers, and neither dusky Nubian
nor bearded Asiatic dared enter the land to plunder or despoil. That the
administration was firm and perfectly organized under the iron-willed
monarch may be taken for granted.

But a great change was impending which could not be controlled by the
will of a single man. Prolonged peace had promoted culture, and the
minds of men were centred on the great problems of life and death. Among
the educated classes a religious revolution was imminent. Apparently
Khufu was raised to power on an early wave of insurrection. It was a
period of transition. The downfall of the Ptah cult as a supreme
political force was in progress, and the rival cult of Ra, at
Heliopolis, was coming into prominence. Already in Sneferu's reign a sun
worshipper, one Ra-hotep, occupied the influential position of
Superintendent of the South. It remained for the priests of the sun to
secure converts among the members of the royal family, so as to obtain
political and religious ascendancy, and it can be understood that those
who were educated at their temple college were likely to embrace their
beliefs. If they failed in that direction, the combined influence of
priests and nobles was sufficient to threaten the stability of the
throne. A strong ruler might delay, but he could not thwart, the
progress of the new movement.

The king's name, as we have stated, was Khnûmû Khufu, which means: "I am
guarded by the god Khnûmû". That "modeller" of the universe may have
closely resembled Ptah, but the doctrines of the two sects developed
separately, being subjected to different racial influences. Khnûmû was
ultimately merged with the sun god, and his ram became "the living soul
of Ra". Khnûmû was

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

regarded at Heliopolis as an incarnation of Osiris, whose close
association with agricultural rites perpetuated his worship among the
great mass of the people. In the theological system of the sun cult,
Osiris became a member of the Ra family, and succeeded to the throne of
the "first king" who ruled over Egypt. But Ptah, significantly enough,
was never included among the sun god's companions, and the idea that he
created Ra was confined to Memphis, and evolved at a later date. The
rivalry between the two powerful cults must have been bitter and
pronounced.

If Ptolemaic tradition is to be relied upon, Khufu constructed a temple
to the goddess Hathor, who, as we have seen, was merged with the frog
goddess Hekt, the spouse of Khnûmû. Indeed Hekt came to be regarded as a
form of Hathor. Sati, Khnûmû's other spouse, was also a sky and cow
goddess, so that she links with Nut, and with Hathor, who displaced Nut.

King Khufu's son and successor must have come under the influence of the
Ra cult, for his name, Khaf-ra, signifies "Ra is my glory" or "My
brightness is Ra". The sun cult had received their first great
concession from the royal house. But not until the following Dynasty did
the priests of Heliopolis obtain supreme power, and compel the Pharaoh
to call himself "son of the sun", a title which ever afterwards remained
in use. Sun worship then became the official religion of
Egypt--gradually coloured every other cult. When the Osirian religion
was revived, under the Libyan monarchs, the old deified king, who was an
incarnation of the corn god, was also identified with the sun.

King Khafra did not, it would appear, satisfy the ambitions of the Ra
worshippers, who desired more than formal recognition. A legend which
survives only in

<span id="img_13800"></span> ![](img/13800.jpg)

THE GREAT PYRAMID OF KHUFU (CHEOPS)

The two insets show front and side views of the small ivory statue of
Khufu, which is now in the Cairo Museum.

KING KHAFRA (IV DYNASTY)

Who built the second Great Pyramid

From the statue in Cairo Museum

fragmentary form relates that "the gods turned away from Khufu and his
house". The powerful cult became impatient, and "hope deferred" made
them rebels. A political revolution was fostered, and Khufu's Dynasty
was doomed.

Khafra, the Chephren of Herodotus, who says Khufu was his brother,
erected the second great pyramid, which is only about 30 feet lower than
the other. The remains of his temple still survive. It is built of
granite, and although the workmanship is less exact, as if the work were
more hastily performed than in Khufu's day, the architecture is
austerely sublime. Immense square pillars support massive blocks; there
are great open spaces, and one is impressed by the simplicity and
grandeur of the scheme.

Seven statues of Khafra were discovered by Mariette, so that his "Ka"
was well provided for. The great diorite statue preserved in the Cairo
museum is one of the enduring triumphs of Egyptian art. The conception
is at once grand and imposing. His Majesty is seated on the throne, but
he wears the wig of the great ruling judge. At the back of his head is
the figure of the protecting Horus hawk. His face is calmer than
Khufu's--resolution is combined with dignity and patience. He seems to
be imbued with the spirit of Old Kingdom greatness.

Although cut from so hard a material as diorite, there is much muscular
detail in the figure, which is that of a strong and vigorous man. His
throne is straight-backed, but the stately floral design of the sides,
and the lions' heads and fore paws in front are in keeping with the
naked majesty of the whole statue, which was originally covered with a
soft material.

Again the reign is a blank. The priests informed

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Herodotus that
Khafra's conduct was similar to that of Khufu. "The Egyptians had to
endure every species of oppression and calamity, and so greatly do they
hate the memories of the two monarchs that they are unwilling to mention
their names. Instead they called their pyramids by the name of the
shepherd Philitis, who grazed his cattle near them."

The great Sphinx was long associated with Khafra, whose name was carved
upon it during the Eighteenth Dynasty, but it is believed to be of much
later date. It is fashioned out of the rock, and is over 60 feet in
height. The body is a lion's, and the face was a portrait of a Pharaoh,
but it has been so much disfigured by Mohammedans that it cannot be
identified with certainty. Nor is there complete agreement as to the
significance of the Sphinx. Centuries after its construction the
Egyptians regarded it as a figure of the sun god, but more probably it
was simply a symbol of royal power and greatness.

There were kindlier memories of Menkaura, the Mycernius of Herodotus,
who said that this king was a son of Khufu. He erected the third great
pyramid, which is but 218 feet high, and three small ones for his
family. He was reputed, however, to have eased the burden of the
Egyptians, and especially to have allowed the temples to be reopened, so
that the people might offer sacrifices to the gods. As a just monarch he
excelled all his predecessors, and his memory was long revered. Not only
did he deliver equitable judgments, but was ever ready to hear appeals
when complaints were made against officials, and willing to remove and
redress wrongs. His statue shows us a less handsome man than either
Khufu or Khafra, and the expression of the face accords with his
traditional character. Indeed, it is not only unaffected, but
melancholy.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

A story was told to Herodotus that the king was greatly stricken by the
death of his daughter. He had her body enclosed in a heifer made of
wood, which was covered over with gold. It was not buried, but placed in
a palace hall at Sais. Incense was burned before it daily, and at night
it was illuminated. The heifer reclined on its knees. A purple robe
covered the body, and between the gilded horns blazed a great golden
star. Once a year, in accordance with the request of the dying princess,
the image was carried outside so that she might behold the sun. The
occasion was an Osirian festival, and the heifer, it is believed,
represented Isis.

We know definitely that a daughter of Menkaura was given in marriage to
Ptah-shepses, a high official, who became the priest of three obelisks.
The appointment is full of significance, because these obelisks were
erected to Ra. Sun worship was evidently gaining ground.

The mummy of the king was enclosed in a great sarcophagus of basalt, but
was destroyed with the others. Mention is also made of a Fourth-Dynasty
monarch named Radadef, but he cannot be placed with certainty. Khufu's
line flourished for about a century and a half, and then was overthrown.
A new family of kings, who were definitely Ra worshippers, sat on the
throne of United Egypt. In the folk tales which follow are interesting
glimpses of the life and beliefs of the times.
