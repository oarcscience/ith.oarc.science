### XCIX. HOW A MAN WHO THROUGH WANT DISMISSES HIS OWN CHILDREN.

<span id="img_14600"></span> ![](img/14600.jpg)

When they would symbolise *a man who through want dismisses his own
children*, they portray A HAWK WITH EGG; for though she lays three eggs,
she hatches and brings up but one, and breaks the other two: and she
does this on account of the loss of her claws at that season, being for
that reason unable to bring up all three young ones.
