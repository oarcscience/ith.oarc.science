### CV. HOW A MAN THAT WASTEFULLY CONSUMES BOTH THINGS THAT ARE REQUISITE AND THINGS THAT ARE NOT.

<span id="img_15000"></span> ![](img/15000.jpg)

When they would symbolise *a man that wastefully consumes both things
that are requisite and useless*, they delineate a POLYPUS; for after
eating much and extravagantly, it lays by food in its holes, and when it
has consumed that which is useful, it then throws away that which is
useless.
