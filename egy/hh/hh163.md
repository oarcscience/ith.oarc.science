### XC. HOW A MAN WHO CONCEALS HIS DEPRAVITY WITHIN HIMSELF.

<span id="img_14100"></span> ![](img/14100.jpg)

When they would denote *a man who conceals his depravity within
himself*, and hides himself so as not to be known by his own friends and

suffering its scent to escape, which is \[a hindrance in the pursuit fl
of other animals.
