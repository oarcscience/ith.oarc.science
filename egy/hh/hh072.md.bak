tail, and rendering it incapable of motion: for in this part lies the
strength and power of the crocodile. And now, though there are other

appropriate symbols deducible from the nature of the crocodile, those

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_93"></span>[87:1](hh072.htm#fr_98.md)

I. *The illustration is from Belzoni's tomb. There are properly 12
figures of each side of the crocodile; representing the hours of the day
and night*.

II\. *The fig. beneath certainly signifies darkness; and is supposed to
represent the end of a crocodile's tail*.
