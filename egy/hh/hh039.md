### XXXVII. HOW EDUCATION.

<span id="img_05700"></span> ![](img/05700.jpg)

To denote *education* <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_63) they represent
the HEAVEN DISTILLING DEW, intimating that as falling dew alights on all
Vegetables, and softens those which have a nature susceptible of being
softened, but is unable to operate upon those which essentially remain
hard in the same way as upon the others; so also among men education is
common to all; and a man of an apt disposition receives it as dew, while

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

a man of a disposition less docile is incapable of doing so.
