### LVI. HOW AN UNJUST AND UNGRATEFUL MAN.

To symbolize an *unjust* and *ungrateful* man, they depict TWO CLAWS OF
AN HIPPOPOTAMUS TURNED DOWNWARDS.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For this animal
when arrived at its prime of life contends in fight against his father,
to try which is the stronger of the two, and should the father give way
he assigns him a place of residence, permitting him to live, and
consorts himself with his own mother; but if his father should not
permit him to hold intercourse with his mother, he kills him, being the
stronger and more vigorous of the two. And they make use of the lowest
parts of the hippopotamus, the two claws, that men seeing this, and
understanding the story of it, may be more inclined to kindness.
