To denote *speech* they depict a TONGUE, and a BLOODSHOT EYE; because
they allot the principal parts of speech to the tongue, but the
secondary parts thereof to the eyes. For these kinds of discourses are
strictly those of the soul varying in conformity with its emotions; more
especially as they are denominated by the Egyptians as different
languages. And to symbolize *speech* differently, they depict

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

a TONGUE and a HAND BENEATH; allotting the principal parts of speech to
the tongue to perform, and the secondary parts to the hand as effecting
the wishes of the tongue.

I. *Supposed by Mr. Wilkinson to represent three tongues, and to apply
to the goddess of speech*.

II\. *Champollion considered this as the tongue and hand alluded to: it
is often found inscribed at the beginning of tablets; a position not tin
frequently occupied by an eye. It appears as a title of Hor*.
