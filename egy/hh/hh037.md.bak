### XXXV. HOW A MAN RETURNING HOME AFTER A LONG TIME FROM A FOREIGN LAND.

<span id="img_05500"></span> ![](img/05500.jpg)

To denote a man returning home after a long time from a foreign land
they again delineate the PHŒNIX the bird: for this creature, after an
interval of 580 years, <span id="fr_62"></span>[2](#fn_60.md) when the time
of death is about to overtake him, returns to Egypt, and as soon as he
pays the debt of nature in Egypt, he is mystically served with funeral
rites; and whatever rites the Egyptians pay to the rest of the sacred
animals, the same

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

are due to the Phœnix: <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_61.md) for it is
said by the Egyptians to rejoice in the sun more than other birds, and
because among them the Nile overflows through the heat of this god; of
which matter we discoursed with you a short time since.
