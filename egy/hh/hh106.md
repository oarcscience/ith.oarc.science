### XXXIII. WHAT BY AN ICHNEUMON.

<span id="img_10800"></span> ![](img/10800.jpg)

When they would represent *a man that is feeble, and unable of himself
to help himself, but who does so by the aid of others*, they delineate
an ICHNEUMON. For this animal, when it spies a serpent, does not at once
attack it, but by its noise calls others to its assistance, and then
attacks the serpent.
