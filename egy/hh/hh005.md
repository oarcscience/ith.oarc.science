### III. HOW A YEAR.

When they would represent a *year*, they delineate

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> ISIS, i. e. a
woman. By the same symbol they also represent the *goddess*. Now Isis is
with them a star, called in Egyptian, Sothis, but in Greek Astrocyon,
\[the Dog' star\]; which seems also to preside over the other stars,
inasmuch as it sometimes rises greater, and at other times less;
sometimes brighter, and at other times not so; and moreover, because
according to the rising of this star we shew all the events of the
ensuing year: <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) therefore not without
reason do they call the year Isis. When they would represent the year
otherwise, they delineate a PALM TREE <span
id="fr_12"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) \[BRANCH\], because of all others this
tree alone at each renovation of the

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

moon produces one additional branch, so that in twelve branches the year
is completed.

Horoscopus carries a φοίνικα, which evidently must imply a palm branch.
