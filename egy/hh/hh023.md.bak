### XXI. HOW THE RISING OF THE NILE.

To signify the *rising of the Nile*, which they call in the

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Egyptian language
NOUN, and which, when interpreted, signifies New, they sometimes
pourtray a LION, and sometimes THREE LARGE WATERPOTS, and at other times
HEAVEN AND EARTH GUSHING FORTH WITH WATER. And they depict a LION,
because when the sun is in Leo it augments the rising of the Nile, so
that oftentimes while the sun remains in that sign of the zodiac, half
of the new water \[Noun, the entire inundation?\] is supplied; and hence
it is, that those who anciently presided over the sacred works, have
made the spouts \[?\] and passages of the sacred fountains in the form
of lions. <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_46.md)

this day in prayer for an abundant inundation - - - - - - - - - And they
depict THREE WATERPOTS, or HEAVEN AND EARTH GUSHING FORTH WITH WATER,
because they make a waterpot like a heart having a tongue,—like a heart,
because in their opinion the heart is the ruling member of the body, as
the Nile is the ruler of Egypt, and like \[a heart with?\] a tongue,
because it is always in a state of humidity, and they call it the
producer of existence. And they depict three waterpots, and neither more
nor less, because according to them there is a triple cause of the
inundation. And they depict one for the Egyptian soil, as being of
itself productive of water; and another for the ocean, for at the period
of the inundation,

water flows up from it into Egypt; and the third to symbolise the rains
which prevail in the southern parts of Ethiopia at the time of the
rising of the Nile. Now that Egypt generates the water, we may deduce
from this, that in the rest of the earth the inundations of the rivers
take place in the winter, and are caused by frequent rains; but the
country of the Egyptians alone, inasmuch as it is situated in the middle
of the habitable world, like that part of the eye, which is called the
pupil, of itself causes the rising of the Nile in summer.
