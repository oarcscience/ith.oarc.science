### LXXIV. HOW A MAN WHO IS FEARFUL LEST ACCIDENTS SHOULD HAPPEN UNEXPECTEDLY TO HIMSELF.

<span id="img_13200"></span> ![](img/13200.jpg)

When they would denote a man who is fearful lest accidents should happen
unexpectedly to himself, they depict a WOLF AND A STONE; for it fears
neither iron, nor a stick, but a stone only; and indeed, if any one
throw a stone at him he will find him terrified: and wherever a wolf is
struck by a stone, maggots are engendered from the bruise.
