When they would symbolise *one enemy engaging with another equal to
himself*, they depict a SCORPION AND A CROCODILE. For these kill one
another. But if they would symbolise *one who is hostile to, and has
slain another*, they depict a CROCODILE or a SCORPION; and if he has
slain him *speedily*, they depict a CROCODILE, but if *slowly*, a
SCORPION, from its tardy motion.

XXXV\. *This seems to hare some astronomical allusion. The Crocodile was
one of the Vahans of the Sun, and the year began with Scorpio. It is not
an uncommon hieroglyphic*.
