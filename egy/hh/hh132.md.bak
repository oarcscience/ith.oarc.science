### LIX. HOW A WOMAN THAT HATES HER HUSBAND.

<span id="img_12300"></span> ![](img/12300.jpg)

When they would symbolise *a woman that hates her own husband*, and
designs his death, and is complaisant only during intercourse, they
delineate a VIPER; for when in connexion with the male, she places his
mouth in her mouth, and after they have disjoined, she bites the head of
the male and kills him.
