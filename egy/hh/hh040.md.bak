### XXXVIII. HOW THE EGYPTIAN LETTERS.

<span id="img_05800"></span> ![](img/05800.jpg) <span
id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_64.md)

To denote the *Egyptian letters*, or a *sacred scribe*, or a *boundary*,
they delineate INK, and a SIEVE, and a REED, and they thus symbolise the
Egyptian *letters*, because by means of these things all writings among
the Egyptians are executed: for they write with a reed and nothing else:
and they depict a SIEVE, because the sieve being originally

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

an instrument for making bread is constructed of reed; and they thereby
intimate that every one who has a subsistence should learn the letters,
but that one who has not should practise some other art. And hence it is
that among them education is called SBO, <span
id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) which when interpreted signifies
sufficient food. Also they symbolize by these a *sacred scribe*, because
he judges of life and death. For there is among the sacred scribes a
sacred book called AMBRES, by which they decide respecting any one who
is lying sick, whether he will live or not, ascertaining it from the
recumbent posture of the sick person. And a *boundary*, because he who
has learnt his letters has arrived at a tranquil harbour of existence,
no longer wandering among the evils of this life.
