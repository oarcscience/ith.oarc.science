# THE LAMENTS OF ISIS AND NEPHTHYS

(BERLIN PAP. 1425)

INVOCATION concerning the glorious things done by the two goddesses of
the temple of Osiris, Khent-Amentit, <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)
the great God of Abydos; performed in the 4th summer month, 25th day;
likewise to be performed in every shrine of Osiris at every one of his
Heb-festivals. <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)

Glorify his soul! Establish his dead body!  
Praise his spirit! Give breath to his nostrils and to his parched
throat!  
Give gladness unto the heart of Isis and to that of Nephthys;  
Place Horus upon the throne of his Father  
Give life, stability and power to Osiris Thentirti, <span
id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)  
Born of the great forsaken one, she who is called also Pelses, the
truthful--  
Glorious are her acts, according to the words of the gods.

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

Behold now, Isis speaketh,--  
Come to thy temple, come to thy temple, oh An! <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)  
Come to thy temple, for thine enemies are not  
Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer--come to thy temple!  
Lo I, thy sister, love thee--do not thou depart from me!  
Behold Hunnu, <span id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) the beautiful one  
Come to thy temple immediately--come to thy temple immediately! Behold
thou my heart, which grieveth for thee;  
Behold me seeking for thee--I am searching for thee to behold thee!  
Lo, I am prevented from beholding thee--  
I am prevented from beholding thee, oh An! <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)  
It is blessed to behold thee--come to the one who loveth thee!  
Come to the one who loveth thee, oh thou who art beautiful,
Un-Nofer, <span id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_5.md) deceased.  
Come to thy sister--come to thy wife--  
Come to thy wife, oh thou who makest the heart to rest.  
I, thy sister, born of thy mother, go about to every temple of thine,  
Yet thou comest not forth to me  
Gods, and men before the face of the gods, are weeping for thee at the
same time, when they behold me!

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

Lo, I invoke thee with wailing that reacheth high as heaven,--  
Yet thou hearest not my voice. Lo I, thy sister, I love thee more than
all the earth--  
And thou lovest not another as thou dost thy sister--  
Surely thou lovest not another as thou dost thy sister!

Behold now, Nephthys speaketh,--  
Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer! Come to thy temple!  
Cause thy heart to rejoice, for thy enemies are not!  
All thy sister-goddesses are at thy side and behind thy couch,  
Calling upon thee with weeping--yet thou art prostrate upon thy bed!  
Hearken unto the beautiful words uttered by us and by every noble one
among us!  
Subdue thou every sorrow which is in the hearts of us thy sisters,  
Oh thou strong one among the gods,--strong among men who behold thee!  
We come before thee, oh prince, our lord  
Live before us, desiring to behold thee  
Turn not thou away thy face before us  
Sweeten our hearts when we behold thee, oh prince!  
Beautify our hearts when we behold thee  
I, Nephthys, thy sister, I love thee:

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Thy foes are subdued, there is not one remaining.  
Lo, I am with thee; I shall protect thy limbs for ever, eternally.

Behold now, Isis speaketh,--  
Praised be An <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) thou shinest upon us
from heav'n every day,  
Yet can we not behold thy beams.  
Tehuti <span id="fr_8"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) protecteth thee, he causeth thy
soul to be established within the Maadet boat, <span
id="fr_9"></span>[3](#fn_8.md) by  
the power of thy name of "Iah"!  
Come to me; for I would behold thee and thy beauties by means of the
Uazit eye,-- <span id="fr_10"></span>[4](#fn_9.md)  
By the power of thy name of "Lord of the six festivals"!  
Thy royal attendants are by thy side, nor go they forth from thee;  
Thou takest possession of heaven by the greatness of thy terrors, and by
the power of thy name of "Prince of the fifteen festivals"!  
Thou shinest upon us like Ra, the lord--  
Glow thou above us like Tum.  
Gods and men live when beholding thee-shine thou upon us;  
Brighten thou the two lands; <span id="fr_11"></span>[5](#fn_10.md)  
The two horizons are fitted for thy pathways.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

Gods together with men are with thee;  
No harm cometh unto them from thy shining,  
Nor from thy journeying in the celestial boat <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) above.  
Thy enemies have ceased to be, for I am protecting thee, oh Ra, lord!  
Come thou to us as a babe, thou first great Sun god.  
Depart not from us who behold thee  
There proceedeth from thee the strong Orion in heaven at evening, at the
resting of every day!  
Lo, it is I, at the approach of the Sothis period, who doth watch for
him,  
Nor will I leave off watching for him; for that which proceedeth from
thee is revered.  
An emanation from thee causeth life to gods and men, reptiles and
animals, and they live by means thereof.  
Come thou to us from thy chamber, in the day when thy soul begetteth
emanations,--  
The day when offerings upon offerings are made to thy spirit, which
causeth the gods and men likewise to live.  
Praise be to the Lord, for there is no god like unto thee, oh Tum! <span
id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_12.md)  
Thy soul possesseth the earth, and thy likenesses the underworld;

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

Lo, it is prepared for and containeth thy hidden shrine.  
Thy wife is ready to protect thee, and thy son Horus also, as prince of
the lands.

Behold now, Nephthys speaketh,--  
Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer! Come to thy temple, Un-Nofer,
deceased,--come to Deddu! <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_13.md)  
Behold the bull, the begotten one!  
Come thou to Anep (Mendes), the beloved enclosure!  
Come to Khar! Come to the two Deddus (Mendes and Busiris), the place
which thy soul loveth, and the souls of thy fathers likewise!  
Thy son, thy child Horus, born of thy sister-goddesses, is before thy
face.  
It is I who doth illuminate and protect thee every day--  
I will not depart from thee for ever  
Oh, An, come thou to Sais, for thy name is "Sau" (protector)! <span
id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_14.md)  
Come to Aper! Behold thou thy mother, Nut, oh thou lovely child!  
Depart thou not from her! Come to her breasts; abundance is therein!  
Thy sister, too, is beautiful, depart thou not from her, oh son!

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Come to Sais, oh Osiris, and to Tarud,  
She who is called also Nisep, born of Pelses, deceased!  
Come to Aper, thy city, thy seat, and to the temple of Deb!  
Thou shalt rest beside thy mother eternally  
She preserveth thy limbs and procureth terror among thy enemies, for she
protecteth thy members for ever.  
Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer! Come to thy temple!  
Come, behold thou thy son Horus as prince of gods and men;  
He taketh possession of the cities and the nomes by the magnitude of his
terrors;  
Heaven and earth are filled with fear of him,  
And the barbarians are submissive under his terrors. Thy children are
among gods and men,  
And the eastern and western horizons are among the attributes of thy
producing;  
Thy two sisters are at thy side, purifying thy soul,  
And thy son Horus admitteth thine attributes. There cometh forth
funereal and other offerings--beer, bulls and geese--for thee:  
Tehuti proclaimeth thy Heb-festival, and invoketh thee with his
protecting formulae;  
Horus covereth thy limbs with his protections  
Every day thy son Horus glorifieth thy spirit,

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

And he avengeth thy name by offerings for thy soul placed at thy secret
shrine.  
As for the gods, their arms bear libation vases for the purifying of thy
spirit.  
Come to thy children, oh prince, our lord, nor depart thou from them.

Lo! he comes!
