COLOPHON

May their names remain fixed, and not destroyed for ever before Osiris,
Horus, Isis, Nephthys--those gods and goddesses who are herein
mentioned;. and before the gods and goddesses in their entirety who are
in the underworld, and in the chambers and great shrines existing in the
underworld.

Lo! may they cause to come forth these names existent in the underworld
in excellence! Let them be invoked in the Nai-boat <span
id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) of Ra. Let there be given for them
funereal offerings upon the altar of the great God, day by day!

Let there be given for them cool water, and incense as to the excellent
kings of Upper and Lower Egypt, who are existent in the underworld. Let
them be permitted to go out and come in among those praised of Osiris,
who is the breath of those in the underworld. Let it be caused that the
beams of Aten <span id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_49.md) may fall upon their
bodies every day.

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

If there be any man--any one of this land, or any one, Negro, Kushite or
Syrian, who removeth this writing, or carrieth it away as a thief, let
none approach to them, nor give to them of cooling water; nor let them
breathe the zephyrs; nor permit to remain to them son nor daughter of
their begetting, nor let the name of such a one be mentioned in the land
if they be born, nor let them behold the beams of the sun.

But if there be a man, any one whomsoever, who beholdeth this writing
and causeth my soul and my name to become established among those who
are blessed, let it be done for him likewise after his final arriving
(at the end of life's voyage) in recompense for what was done by him for
me, Osiris.
