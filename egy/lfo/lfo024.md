### THE TWENTIETH CEREMONY.

After the presentation of the wine and beer the SEM priest took in his
hands a small table, or stand, on which were placed several bread-cakes
of different shapes and kinds, called "Tchesert," i.e., "the

holy table." With this he advanced to the deceased, and whilst he
offered it to him the Kher heb said:--

"O Ra, may the worship which thou hast in heaven and all the worship
which is offered to thee be to Unas, and may everything which is offered
to thy body be offered to the KA of Unas; and may everything which is
offered to his body be thine."

From this passage we learn that the deceased is identified with Ra, and
that it was expected that he would share with Ra the praises, and
worship, and offerings which were dedicated to him. The offerings made
to the deceased were intended for Ra, upon whom devolved the duty of
feeding him with a portion of them. The bread-cakes of earth were
transmuted into the "bread of everlastingness," and the wine into the
"wine of eternity," whereon Ra lived.
