### THE THIRTEENTH CEREMONY.

The SEM priest took in his hands two vessels, one filled with white and
the other with black wine,

each holding one *hathes* measure, and as he presented them to the
deceased, the Kher heb said:--

"Thou hast taken possession of that which hath flowed forth from the
Eyes of Horus, and when they (i.e., the wines) are in front of thee they
illumine thy face."

The white and the black wine were not intended to be drunk, but to be
poured over the head and forehead of the deceased, so that the strength
in them might be transmitted to his face. The wines, being regarded as
emanations from the Eyes of Horus, the White and the Black, contained
the divine power which existed in the Eyes of the god, and they
transferred to the deceased the might of the Day and the Night.
