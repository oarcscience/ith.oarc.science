### THE TWENTY-FIRST CEREMONY.

In the next ceremonies the various kinds of bread and cakes on the
"Tchesert" table were offered one by one. The first was the *tept*, and
as the SEM priest presented it the Kher heb said:--

"Unas, the Eye of Horus hath been presented unto thee for thy tasting."

Here there is a play on the words *tept*, a "kind of bread," and *tep*,
"to taste."
