This book has text and analysis of a key Egyptian ritual which was
performed when preparing the corpse of a pharaoh for mummification. This
is known as the "Book of the Opening of the Mouth". The ritual consisted
of offering a long sequence of foodstuffs, beverages, cosmetics and
other consumables, along with a litany recited by the priests. This text
was also painted on the walls of the royal tomb. This recitation may be
tedious and repetitous, but there is a reason that I've gone to the
trouble of creating an etext of this book. Although Budge doesn't
emphasize this, this text comprises an important part of the 'Pyramid
Texts', of which only portions are available in public domain English
translation. <span id="contents"></span>
