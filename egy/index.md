The civilization of Ancient Egypt lasted longer than the entire span of
what we have come to accept as 'recorded history': over three thousand
years. During these millenia the Egyptians developed a multitude of gods
and goddesses, as well as esoteric practices that we are still
unravelling the meaning of. Besides this, Egypt was the source of the
first true monothestic religion, under the pharaoh Akhenaton. This rich
tradition was mostly unknown until the early nineteenth century, when
the Egyptian language was finally deciphered.
