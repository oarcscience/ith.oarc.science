# CHAPTER VIII

### THE STORY OF THE BOOK OF THOTH

NOW Ahura was the wife of Nefer-ka-ptah, and their child was Merab; this
was the name by which he was registered by the scribes in the House of
Life. And Nefer-ka-ptah, though he was the son of the King, cared for
naught on earth but to read the ancient records, written on papyrus in
the House of Life or engraved on stone in the temples; all day and every
day he studied the writings of the ancestors.

One day he went into the temple to pray to the gods, but when he saw the
inscriptions on the walls he began to read them; and he forgot to pray,
he forgot the gods, he forgot the priests, he forgot all that was around
him until he heard laughter behind him. He looked round and a priest
stood there, and from him came the laughter.

"Why laughest thou at me?" said Nefer-ka-ptah.

"Because thou readest these worthless writings," answered the priest.
"If thou wouldest read writings

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

that are worth the reading I can tell thee where the Book of Thoth lies
hidden."

Then Nefer-ka-ptah was eager in his questions, and the priest replied,
"Thoth wrote the Book with his own hand, and in it is all the magic in
the world. If thou readest the first page, thou wilt enchant the sky,
the earth, the abyss, the mountains, and the sea; thou wilt understand
the language of the birds of the air, and thou wilt know what the
creeping things of earth are saying, and thou wilt see the fishes from
the darkest depths of the sea. And if thou readest the other page, even
though thou wert dead and in the world of ghosts, thou couldest come
back to earth in the form thou once hadst. And besides this, thou wilt
see the sun shining in the sky with the full moon and the stars, and
thou wilt behold the great shapes of the gods."

Then said Nefer-ka-ptah, "By the life of Pharaoh, that Book shall be
mine. Tell me whatsoever it is that thou desirest, and I will do it for
thee."

"Provide for my funeral," said the priest. "See that I am buried as a
rich man, with priests and mourning women, offerings, libations, and
incense. Then shall my soul rest in peace in the fields of Aalu. One
hundred pieces of silver must be spent upon my burying."

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

Then Nefer-ka-ptah sent a fleet messenger to fetch the money, and he
paid one hundred pieces of silver into the priest's hands. When the
priest had taken the silver, he said to Nefer-ka-ptah:

"The Book is at Koptos in the middle of the river.  
In the middle of the river is an iron box,  
In the iron box is a bronze box,  
In the bronze box is a keté-wood box,  
In the keté-wood box is an ivory-and-ebony box,  
In the ivory-and-ebony box is a silver box,  
In the silver box is a gold box,  
And in the gold box is the Book of Thoth,  
Round about the great iron box are snakes and scorpions and all manner
of crawling things, and above all there is a snake which no man can
kill. These are set to guard the Book of Thoth."

When the priest had finished speaking, Nefer-ka-ptah ran out of the
temple, for his joy was so great that he knew not where he was. He ran
quickly to Ahura to tell her about the Book and that he would go to
Koptos and find it.

But Ahura was very sorrowful, and said, "Go not on this journey, for
trouble and grief await thee in the southern land."

She laid her hand upon Nefer-ka-ptah as though she would hold him back
from the sorrow that awaited him. But he would not be restrained, and
broke away from her and went to the king his father.

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

He told the King all that he had learned, and said, "Give me the royal
barge, O my father, that I may go to the southern land with my wife
Ahura and my son Merab. For the Book of Thoth I must and will have."

So the King gave orders and the royal barge was prepared, and in it
Nefer-ka-ptah, Ahura, and Merab sailed up the river to the southern land
as far as Koptos. When they arrived at Koptos, the high priest and all
the priests of Isis of Koptos came down to the river to welcome
Nefer-ka-ptah, sacrificed an ox and a goose, and poured a libation of
wine to Isis of Koptos and her son Harpocrates. After this, the priests
of Isis and their wives made a great feast for four days in honor of
Nefer-ka-ptah and Ahura.

On the morning of the fifth day, Nefer-ka-ptah called to him a priest of
Isis, a great magician learned in all the mysteries of the gods. And
together they made a little magic box, like the cabin of a boat, and
they made men and a great store of tackle, and put the men and the
tackle in the magic cabin. Then they uttered a spell over the cabin, and
the men breathed and were alive, and began to use the tackle. And
Nefer-ka-ptah sank the magic cabin in the river, saying "Workmen,
workmen!

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Work for me!" And he filled the royal barge with
sand and sailed away alone, while Ahura sat on the bank of the river at
Koptos, and watched and waited, for she knew that sorrow must come of
this journey to the southern land.

The magic men in the magic cabin toiled all night and all day for three
nights and three days along the bottom of the river; and when they
stopped the royal barge stopped also, and Nefer-ka-ptah knew that he had
arrived where the Book lay hidden.

He took the sand out of the royal barge and threw it into the water, and
it made a gap in the river, a gap of a schoenus long and a schoenus
wide; in the middle of the gap lay the iron box, and beside the box was
coiled the great snake that no man can kill, and all around the box on
every side to the edge of the walls of water were snakes and scorpions
and all manner of crawling things.

Then Nefer-ka-ptah stood up in the royal barge, and across the water he
cried to the snakes and scorpions and crawling things; a loud and
terrible cry, and the words were words of magic. As soon as his voice
was still, the snakes and scorpions and crawling things were still also,
for they were enchanted by means of the magical words of Nefer-ka-ptah,

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

and they could not move. Nefer-ka-ptah brought the royal barge to the
edge of the gap, and he walked through the snakes and scorpions and
crawling things, and they looked at him, but could not move because of
the spell that was on them.

And now Nefer-ka-ptah was face to face with the snake that no man could
kill, and it reared itself up ready for battle. Nefer-ka-ptah rushed
upon it and cut off its head, and at once the head and body came
together, each to each, and the snake that no man could kill was alive
again, and ready for the fray. Again Nefer-ka-ptah rushed upon it, and
so hard did he strike that the head was flung far from the body, but at
once the head and body came together again, each to each, and again the
snake that no man could kill was alive and ready to fight. Then
Nefer-ka-ptah saw that the snake was immortal and could not be slain but
must be overcome by subtle means. Again he rushed upon it and cut it in
two, and very quickly he put sand on each part, so that when the head
and body came together there was sand between them and they could not
join, and the snake that no man could kill lay helpless before him.

Then Nefer-ka-ptah went to the great box where

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

it stood in the gap in the middle of the river, and the snakes and
scorpions and crawling things watched, but they could not stop him.

He opened the iron box and found a bronze box,  
He opened the bronze box and found a keté-wood box,  
He opened the keté-wood box and found an ivory-and-ebony box,  
He opened the ivory-and-ebony box and found a silver box,  
He opened the silver box and found a gold box,  
He opened the gold box and found the Book of Thoth.

He opened the Book and read a page, and at once he had enchanted the
sky, the earth, the abyss, the mountains, and the sea, and he understood
the language of birds, fish, and beasts. He read the second page and he
saw the sun shining in the sky, with the full moon and the stars, and he
saw the great shapes of the gods themselves; and so strong was the magic
that the fishes came up from the darkest depths of the sea. So he knew
that what the priest had told him was true.

Then he thought of Ahura waiting for him at Koptos, and he cast a magic
spell upon the men that he had made, saying, "Workmen, workmen! Work for
me! and take me back to the place from which I came." They toiled day
and night till they came to Koptos, and there was Ahura sitting by the
river, having eaten nothing and drunk nothing

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

since Nefer-ka-ptah went away. For she sat waiting and watching for the
sorrow that was to come upon them.

But when she saw Nefer-ka-ptah returning in the royal-barge, her heart
was glad and she rejoiced exceedingly. Nefer-ka-ptah came to her and put
the Book of Thoth into her hands and bade her read it. When she read the
first page, she enchanted the sky, the earth, the abyss, the mountains,
and the sea, and she understood the language of birds, fish, and beasts;
and when she read the second page, she saw the sun shining in the sky,
with the full moon and the stars, and she saw the great shapes of the
gods themselves; and so strong was the magic that the fishes came up
from the darkest depths of the sea.

Nefer-ka-ptah now called for a piece of new papyrus and for a cup of
beer; and on the papyrus he wrote all the spells that were in the Book
of Thoth. Then he took the cup of beer and washed the papyrus in the
beer, so that all the ink was washed off and the papyrus became as
though it had never been [written](errata.htm#7.md) on. And Nefer-ka-ptah
drank the beer, and at once he knew all the spells that had been written
on the papyrus, for this is the method of the great magicians.

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

Then Nefer-ka-ptah and Ahura went to the temple of Isis and gave
offerings to Isis and Harpocrates, and made a great feast, and the next
day they went on board the royal barge and sailed joyfully away down the
river towards the northern land.

But behold, Thoth had discovered the loss of his Book, and Thoth raged
like a panther of the south, and he hastened before Ra and told him all,
saving, "Nefer-ka-ptah has found my magic box and opened it, and has
stolen my Book, even the Book of Thoth; he slew the guards that
surrounded it, and the snake that no man can kill lay helpless before
him. Avenge me, O Ra, upon Nefer-ka-ptah, son of the King of Egypt."

The majesty of Ra answered and said, "Take him and his wife and his
child, and do with them as thou wilt." And now the sorrow for which
Ahura watched and waited was about to come upon them, for Thoth took
with him a power from Ra to give him his desire upon the stealer of his
Book.

As the royal barge sailed smoothly down the river, the little boy Merab
ran out from the shade of the awning and leaned over the side watching
the water. And the power of Ra drew him, so that he fell into the river
and was drowned. When he

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

fell, all the sailors on the royal barge and all the people walking on
the river-bank raised a great cry, but they could not save him.
Nefer-ka-ptah came out of the cabin and read a magical spell over the
water, and the body of Merab came to the surface and they brought it on
board the royal barge. Then Nefer-ka-ptah read another spell, and so
great was its power that the dead child spoke and told Nefer-ka-ptah all
that had happened among the gods, that Thoth was seeking vengeance, and
that Ra had granted him his desire upon the stealer of his Book.

Nefer-ka-ptah gave command, and the royal barge returned to Koptos, that
Merab might be buried there with the honor due to the son of a prince.
When the funeral ceremonies were over, the royal barge sailed down the
river toward the northern land. A joyful journey was it no longer, for
Merab was dead, and Ahura's heart was heavy on account of the sorrow
that was still to come, for the vengeance of Thoth was not yet
fulfilled.

They reached the place where Merab had fallen into the water, and Ahura
came out from under the shade of the awning, and she leaned over the
side of the barge, and the power of Ra drew her so that she fell into
the river and was drowned. When

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

she fell, all the sailors in the royal barge and all the people walking
on the river-bank raised a great cry, but they could not save her.
Nefer-ka-ptah came out of the cabin and read a magical spell over the
water, and the body of Ahura came to the surface, and they brought it on
board the royal barge. Then Nefer-ka-ptah read another spell and so
great was its power that the dead woman spoke and told Nefer-ka-ptah all
that had happened among the gods, that Thoth was still seeking
vengeance, and that Ra had granted him his desire upon the stealer of
his Book.

Nefer-ka-ptah gave command and the royal barge returned to Koptos, that
Ahura might be buried there with the honor due to the daughter of a
king. When the funeral ceremonies were over, the royal barge sailed down
the river towards the northern land. A sorrowful journey was it now, for
Ahura and Merab were dead, and the vengeance of Thoth was not yet
fulfilled.

They reached the place where Ahura and Merab had fallen into the water,
and Nefer-ka-ptah felt the power of Ra drawing him. Though he struggled
against it he knew that it would conquer him. He took a piece of royal
linen, fine and strong, and made it into a girdle, and with it he bound
the Book

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

of Thoth firmly to his breast, for he was resolved that Thoth should
never have his Book again.

Then the power drew him yet more strongly, and he came from under the
shade of the awning and threw himself into the river and was drowned.
When he fell, all the sailors of the royal barge and all the people
walking on the river-bank raised a great cry, but they could not save
him. And when they looked for his body they could not find it. So the
royal barge sailed down the river till they reached the northern land
and came to Memphis, and the chiefs of the royal barge went to the king
and told him all that had happened.

The king put on mourning raiment; he and his courtiers, the high priest
and all the priests of Memphis, the king's army and the king's
household, were clothed in mourning apparel, and they walked in
procession to the haven of Memphis to the royal barge. When they came to
the haven, they saw the body of Nefer-ka-ptah floating in the water
beside the barge, close to the great steering-oars. And this marvel came
to pass because of the magical powers of Nefer-ka-ptah; even in death he
was a great magician by reason of the spells he had washed off the
papyrus and drunk in the beer.

Then they drew him out of the water, and they

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

saw the Book of Thoth bound to his breast with the girdle of royal
linen. And the king gave command that they should bury Nefer-ka-ptah
with the honor due to the son of a king, and that the Book of Thoth
should be buried with him.

Thus was the vengeance of Thoth fulfilled, but the Book remained with
Nefer-ka-ptah.

THE END
