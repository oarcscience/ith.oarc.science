# CHAPTER IV

### THE "BOOK OF THE DEAD"

THE *Book of the Dead*, the Egyptian title of which, "Pert em hru," has
been variously translated "coming forth by day" and the "manifestation
day," is a great body of religious compositions compiled for the use of
the dead in the other world. It is probable that the name had a
significance for the Egyptians which is incapable of being rendered in
any modern language, and is borne out by another of its titles--"The
chapter of making perfect the Khu"--or spirit. Texts dealing with the
welfare of the dead and their life in the world beyond the grave are
known to have been in use among the Egyptians as early as 4000 B.C. The
oldest form of the *Book of the Dead* known to us is represented in the
Pyramid Texts. With the invention of mummification a more complete
funerary ritual arose, based on the hope that such ceremonies as it
imposed would ensure the corpse against corruption, preserve it forever,
and introduce it to a

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

beatified existence among the gods. Almost immediately prior to the
dynastic era a great stimulus appears to have been given to the cult of
Osiris throughout Egypt. He had now become the god of the dead *par
excellence*, and his dogma taught that from the preserved corpse would
spring a beautiful astral body, the future home of the spirit of the
deceased. It therefore became necessary to adopt measures of the
greatest precaution for the preservation of human remains.

The generality of the texts comprised in the "'Book of the Dead" are in
one form or another of much greater antiquity than the period of Mena,
the first historical king of Egypt. Indeed, from internal evidence it is
possible to show that many of these were revised or edited long before
the copies known to us were made. Even at as early a date as 3300 B.C.,
the professional writers who transcribed the [ancient](errata.htm#6.md)
texts appear to have been so puzzled by their contents that they hardly
understood their purport. Dr. Budge states: "We are in any case
justified in estimating the earliest form of the work to be
contemporaneous with the foundation of the civilization which we call
'Egyptian' in the Valley of the Nile."

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

### A "DISCOVERY" 3400 YEARS OLD

A hieratic inscription upon the sarcophagus of Queen Khnem-nefert, wife
of Mentu-hetep, a king of the eleventh dynasty, c.2500 B.C., states that
a certain chapter of the *Book of the Dead* was discovered in the reign
of Hesep-ti, the fifth king of the first dynasty, who flourished about
4266 B.C. This sarcophagus affords us two copies of the said chapter,
one immediately following the other. That as early as 2500 B.C., a
chapter of the *Book of the Dead* should be referred to a date almost
2000 years before that time is astounding, and the mind reels before the
idea of a tradition which, during comparatively unlettered centuries,
could have conserved a religious formula almost unimpaired. Thus
thirty-four centuries ago a portion of the *Book of the Dead* was
regarded as extremely ancient, mysterious, and difficult of
comprehension. It will be noted also that the inscription on the tomb of
Queen Khnem-nefert bears out that the chapter in question was
"discovered" about 4266 B.C. If it were merely discovered at that early
era, what periods of remoteness lie between that epoch and the time when
it was first reduced to writing? The description of the chapter on the
sarcophagus of

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

the royal lady states that "this chapter was found in the foundations
beneath the Dweller in the Hennu Boat by the foreman of the builders in
the time of the king of the South and North, Hesep-ti, whose word is
truth"; and the Nebseni Papyrus says that the chapter was found in the
city of Khemennu, or Hermopolis, on a block of alabaster, written in
letters of lapis-lazuli, under the feet of the god. It also appears from
the Turin Papyrus, which dates from the period of the twenty-sixth
dynasty, that the name of the finder was Heru-ta-ta-f, the son of
Cheops, who was at the time engaged in a tour of inspection of the
temples. Sir Gaston Maspero is doubtful concerning the importance which
should be attached to the statement regarding the chapter on the tomb of
Queen Khnem-nefert, but M. Naville considers the chapter in question one
of the oldest in the *Book of the Dead*.

A bas-relief of the second dynasty bears an inscription dedicating to
the shade of a certain priest the formula of the "thousand loaves of
bread, thousands of jugs of ale," and so forth, so common in later
times. We thus see that 4000 years B.C. it was regarded as a religious
duty to provide offerings of meat and drink for the dead, and there

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

seems to be good evidence, from the nature of the formula in question,
that it had become fixed and ritualistic by this period. This passage
would appear to justify the text of the sarcophagus of the wife of
Mentu-hetep. A few centuries later, about the time of Seneferu, c. 3766
B.C., the cult of the dead had expanded greatly from the architectural
point of view, and larger and more imposing cenotaphs were provided for
them. Victorious wars had brought much wealth to Egypt, and its
inhabitants were better able to meet the very considerable expenditure
entailed upon them by one of the most expensive cults known to the
history of religion. In the reign of Men-kau-Ra a revision of certain
parts of the text of the *Book of the Dead* appears to have been
undertaken. The authority for this is the rubrics attached to certain
chapters which state that they were found inscribed upon a block of
alabaster in letters of lapis-lazuli in the time of that monarch.

We do not find a text comprising the *Book of the Dead* as a whole until
the reign of Unas, 3333 B.C., whose pyramid was opened in 1881 by Sir G.
Maspero. The stone walls were covered with texts extremely difficult of
decipherment, because of their archaic character and spelling, among
them

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

many from the *Book of the Dead*. Continuing his excavations at
Saqqarah, Maspero made his way into the pyramid of Teta, 3300 B.C., in
which he discovered inscriptions, some of which were identical with
those in the pyramid of Unas, so that the existence of a fully formed
*Book of the Dead* by the time of the first king of the sixth dynasty
was proven. Additional texts were found in the tomb of Pepi I, 3233 B.C.
From this it will be seen that before the close of the sixth dynasty
five copies of a series of texts, forming the *Book of the Dead* of that
period, are in evidence, and, as has been observed, there is substantial
proof that its ceremonial was in vogue in the second, and probably in
the first, dynasty. Its texts continued to be copied and employed until
the second century of the Christian era.

It would appear that each chapter of the *Book of the Dead* had an
independent origin, and it is probable that their inclusion and adoption
into the body of the work were spread over many centuries, It is
possible that some of the texts reflect changes in theological opinion,
but each chapter stands by itself. It would seem, however, that there
was a traditional order in the sequence of the chapters.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

### THE THREE RECENSIONS

There were three recensions or versions of the *Book of the Dead*--the
Heliopolitan, the Theban, and the Saite. The Heliopolitan Recension was
edited by the priests of the College of Anu, Or On, known to the Greeks
as Heliopolis, and was based upon texts not now recoverable. The
Pyramids of Unas, Teta, and Pepi contain the original texts of this
recension, which represent the theological system introduced by the
priests of Ra. The essentials of the primitive Egyptian religion are,
however, retained, the only modification in them being the introduction
of the solar doctrine of Ra. In later times the priesthood of Ra were
forced to acknowledge the supremacy of Osiris, and this theological
defeat is visible in the more modern texts. Between the sixth and
eleventh dynasties the priests of On edited a number of fresh chapters
from time to time.

The Thebas Recension was much in vogue from the eighteenth to the
twenty-second dynasties, and was usually written upon papyri and painted
upon coffins in hieroglyphs. Each chapter was preserved distinct from
the others, but appears to have had no distinct place in the entire
collection.

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

The Saite Recension was definitely arranged at some date prior to the
twenty-sixth dynasty, and is written upon coffins and papyri, and also
in hieratic and demotic script. It continued to be employed to the end
of the Ptolemaic period.

As we have previously noticed, the *Book of the Dead* was for their use
from the moment when they found themselves inhabitants of the other
world. Magic was the very mainspring of existence in that sphere, and
unless a spirit was acquainted with the formulæ which compelled the
respect of the various gods and demons, and even of inanimate objects,
it was helpless. The region to which the dead departed, the primitive
Egyptians called Duat. They believed it to be formed of the body of
Osiris. It was regarded as dark and gloomy, containing pits of fire and
dreadful monsters which circled the earth, and was in its turn, bounded
by a river and a lofty chain of mountains. The part of it that was
nearest to Egypt was regarded as a description of mingled desert and
forest, through which the soul of the deceased might not hope to
struggle unless guided by some benevolent spirit who knew the paths
through this country of despair. Thick darkness covered everything, and
under the veil of this, the hideous inhabitants of the place practised
all

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

sorts of hostility to the newcomer, unless by the use of words of power
he could prove his superiority over them. But there was one delectable
part in this horrid region--the Sekhet Hetepet, the Elysian fields which
contained the Sekhet Aaru, or the Field of Reeds, where dwelt the god
Osiris and his company. At first he had domain over this part of the
Duat alone, but gradually he succeeded in extending it over the entire
country of the dead, of which he was monarch. We find also a god of the
Duat named Duati, but who appears to have been more a personification of
the region than anything else. Now the wish of all good men was to win
to the kingdom of Osiris, and to that end they made an exhaustive study
of the prayers and ritual of the *Book of the Dead*, in order that they
might the more easily penetrate to the region of bliss. This they might
reach by two ways--by land and by water. The path by water was no whit
less dreadful than that by land, the passage of the soul being barred by
streams of fire and boiling water, and the banks of the rivers navigated
were populous with evil spirits.

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

### SELECTIONS FROM THE "BOOK OF THE DEAD"

### A HYMN TO THE SETTING SUN

A hymn of praise to Ra when he riseth upon the horizon, and when he
getteth in the land of life. Osiris, the scribe Ani saith:

"Homage to thee, O Ra, when thou
risest--as--Tem-Heru-khuti--Tem-Harmachis--Thou art adored--by me
when-thy beauties are before mine eyes, and--when
thy--radiance--falleth--upon--my--body. Thou goest forth to thy setting
in the Sektet boat with--fair--winds, and thy heart is glad; the heart
of the Mater boat rejoiceith. Thou stridest over the heavens in peace,
and all thy foes are cast down; the never-resting stars sing hymns of
praise unto thee, and the stars which rest, and the stars which never
fail glorify thee as thou sinkest to rest in the horizon of Manu, O thou
who art beautiful at morn and at eve, O thou lord who livest and art
established, O my lord!

"Homage to thee, O thou who art Ra when thou risest, and. Tem when thou
settest--in--beauty. Thou risest and shinest on the back of thy
mother--Nut,--O thou who art crowned king of the gods! Nut doeth homage
unto thee, and everlasting and

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

never-changing order embraceth thee at morn and at eve. Thou stridest
over the heaven, being glad of heart, and the Lake of Testes is
content--thereat--. The Sebau Fiend hath fallen to the ground; his arms
and his hands have been hacked off, and the knife hath severed the
joints of his body. Ra hath a fair wind; the Sektet boat goeth forth and
sailing along it cometh into port. The gods of the south and of the
north, of the west and of the east, praise thee, O thou divine
substance, from whom all forms of life come into being. Thou sendest
forth the word, and the earth is flooded with silence, O thou only One,
who didst dwell in heaven before ever the earth and the mountains came
into existence. O runner, O Lord, O only One, thou maker of things which
are, thou hast fashioned the tongue of the company of the gods, thou
hast produced whatsoever cometh forth from the waters, and thou
springest up from them over the flooded land of the Lake of Horus. Let
me snuff the air which cometh forth from thy nostrils, and the nostrils,
and the north wind which cometh forth from thy mother--Nut--. O, make
thou to be glorious my shining form--khu--, O Osiris, make thou to be
divine my soul--ba--! Thou art worshipped--in--peace--or

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (in setting--, O Lord of the gods, thou are
exalted by reason of thy wondrous works. Shine thou with the rays of
light upon my body day by day,--upon me--, Osiris the scribe, the teller
of the divine offerings of all the gods, the overseer of the granary of
the lords of Abtu-Abydos--, the royal scribe in truth who loveth thee;
Ani, victorious in peace."

### HYMN AND LITANY TO OSIRIS

(From the Papyrus of Ani, British Museum, No. 10,470, sheet 19)

"Praise unto thee, O Osiris, lord of eternity, Unnefer,
Heru-khuti--Harmachis--, whose forms are manifold, and whose attributes
are majestic, Ptah-Seker-Tern in Annu--Heliopolis--, the lord of the
hidden place, and the creator of Het-ka-Ptah--Memphis--and of the
gods--therein--, the guide of the underworld, who,--the gods--glorify
when thou settest in Nut. Isis embraceth thee in peace, and she driveth
away the fiends from the mouth of thy path. Thou turnest thy face upon
Amentet, and thou makest the earth to shine as with refined copper.
Those who have lain down, i.e., the dead--rise up to see thee, they
breathe the air and they look upon thy face when the Disk riseth on its
horizon; their hearts are at peace inasmuch

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

as they behold thee, O thou who art Eternity and Everlastingness!"

### OPENING THE MOUTH OF OSIRIS

In one of the tombs of the New Stone Age was found a flint instrument
which, as we know from inscriptions of the dynastic period, was used in
performing the ceremony of "opening the mouth" of the dead, a fact that
proves that even in the Old Stone Age a ceremony was performed on the
dead body with the purpose of assisting the soul, or spirit, to acquire
the faculties and powers needed by it in the other world. In this
ceremony the flint instrument was thrust between the teeth of the dead
man, and when these were separated his spirit form was believed. to
acquire the power to eat and drink, to speak, to think, and to perform
all the natural functions of the body.

The Chapter Of Opening The Mouth Of Osiris. The scribe Ani, triumphant,
saith:

"May the good Ptah open my mouth, and may the god of my city loose the
swathings, even the swathings which are over my mouth. Moreover, may
Thoth, being filled and furnished with charms, come And loose the
bandages, even the bandages of Set which fetter my mouth; and may the
god

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Tem hurl them at those who would
fetter--me--with them, and drive them back. May my mouth be opened, may
my mouth be unclosed by Shu with his iron knife wherewith he opened the
mouths of the gods. I am the goddess Sekhet, and I sit upon --my--place
in the great wind (?) of heaven. I am the great goddess Sah who dwelleth
among the Souls of Annu--Heliopolis--. Now as concerning every charm and
all the words which may be spoken against me, may the gods resist them,
and may each and every one of the company of the gods withstand them."

### SOUL AND BODY

(From the Papyrus of Ani, British Museum, No. 10,470, sheet 17)

The chapter of Causing the Soul to be United to its Body in the
Underworld. The Osiris Ani, triumphant, saith:

"Hail, thou god Anniu--i.e., Bringer!--Hail, thou god Pehrer--i.e.,
Runner--, who dwellest in thy hall!--Hail--, great God! Grant thou that
my soul may come unto me from wheresoever it may be. If--it--would
tarry, let then my soul be brought unto me from wherever it may be, for
thou shalt find the Eye of Horns standing by thee like unto those beings
who are like unto Osiris, and who

never lie down in death. Let not the Osiris Ani, triumphant, lie down in
death among those who lie down in Annu, the land wherein souls are
joined unto their bodies even in thousands. Let me have possession of my
ba--soul--, and of my khu, and let me triumph therewith in every place
wheresoever it may be.--Observe these things which--I--speak, for it
hath staves with it;--observe then, O ye divine guardians of heaven, my
soul-wheresoever it may be.--If it would tarry, do thou make my soul to
look upon my body, for thou shalt find the Eye of Horus standing by thee
like those--beings who are like unto Osiris--.

"Hail, ye gods, who tow along the boat of the lord of millions of years,
who bring--it--above the underworld and who make it to travel over Nut,
who make souls to enter into--their--spiritual bodies, whose hands are
filled with your ropes and who clutch your weapons tight, destroy ye the
Enemy; thus shall the boat of the sun be glad and the great God shall
set out on his journey in peace. And behold, grant ye that the soul of
Osiris Ani, triumphant, may come forth before the gods and that it may
be triumphant along with you in the eastern part of the sky to follow
unto the place where it was yesterday;--and that it may have--

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

peace, peace in Amentet. May it look upon its material body, may it rest
upon its spiritual body; and may its body neither perish nor suffer
corruption forever."

(*These words are to be said over a soul of gold inlaid with precious
stones and placed on the breast of Osiris*.)

### OF EVIL RECOLLECTIONS

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 8)

The chapter of driving evil recollections from the mouth. The overseer
of the palace, the chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant, the son of the
overseer of the palace, the chancellor-in-chief, Amen-hetep, triumphant,
saith:

"Hail, thou that cuttest off heads, and slitteth brows, thou being who
puttest away the memory of evil things from the mouth of the Khus by
means of the incantations which they have within them, look not upon me
with the--same--eyes with which thou lookest upon them. Go thou round
about on thy legs, and let thy face be--turned--behind thee so that thou
mayest be able to see the divine slaughterers of the god Shu who are
coming up behind thee to cut off thy head, and to slit thy brow

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

by reason of the message of violence--sent--by thy lord, and to see (?)
that which thou sayest. Work thou for me so that the memory of evil
things shall dart from my mouth; let not my head be cut off; let not my
brow be slit; and let not my mouth be shut fast by reason of the
incantations which thou hast within thee, according to that which thou
doest for the Khus through the incantations which they have within
themselves. Get thee back and depart at the--sound of--the two speeches
which the goddess Isis uttered when thou didst come to cast the
recollection of evil things unto the. mouth of Osiris by the will of
Suti his enemy, saying, 'Let thy face be toward the privy parts, and
look upon that face which cometh forth from the flame of the Eye of
Horus against thee from within the Eye of Tem,' and the calamity of that
night which shall consume thee. And Osiris went back, for the
abomination of thee was in him; and thou didst go back, for the
abomination of him is in thee. I have gone back, for the abomination of
thee is in me; and thou shalt go back, for the abomination of me is in
thee. Thou wouldst come unto me, but I say that thou shalt not advance
to me so that I come to an end, and--I--say then to the divine
slaughterers of the god Shu, 'Depart.'"

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

### OF RESCUE

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 6)

The chapter of not letting the soul of Nu, triumphant, be captive in the
underworld. He saith:

"Hail, thou who art exalted!--Hail--thou who art adored! O thou mighty
one of Souls, thou divine Soul, thou possessor of terrible power, who
dost put the fear of thyself into the gods, thou who art crowned upon
thy throne of majesty, I pray thee to make a way for the ba--soul--, and
for the khu, and the khaibit--shade--of the overseer of the palace, the
chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant--and let him be--provided therewith.
I am a perfect khu, and I have made--my--way unto the place wherein
dwell Ra and Hathor."

(*If this chapter be known--by the deceased--he shall be able to
transform himself into a khu provided--with his soul and with his
shade--in the underworld, and he shall never be held captive at any door
in Amentet, in entering in or in coming out*.)

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

### OF OPENING THE TOMB

(From the Papyrus of Nebseni, British Museum, No. 9,900, sheet 6)

The chapter of opening the tomb of the soul--and--to the shade of Osiris
the scribe Nebseni, the lord of reverence, born of the lady of the
house, Mut-restha, triumphant, *so that he may come forth by day and
have dominion over his fleet*. He saith:

"That which was shut fast hath been opened, that is to say, he that lay
down in death--hath been opened--. That which was open hath been shut to
my soul through the command of the Eye of Horus, which hath strengthened
me and which maketh to stand fast the beauties which are upon the
forehead of Ra, whose strides are long as--he--lifteth up--his--legs--in
journeying--. I have made for myself a way, my members are mighty and
are strong. I am Horus the avenger of his divine father. I am he who
bringeth along his divine father, and who bringeth along his mother by
means of his sceptre (?), And the way shall be opened unto him who hath
gotten dominion over his feet, and he shall see the Great God in the
Boat of Ra,--when--souls are counted therein at the bows, and when the
years are also counted up. Grant that the eye of Horus, which maketh the

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

adornments of light to be firm upon the forehead of Ra, may deliver my
soul for me, and let there be darkness upon your faces, O ye who would
hold fast Osiris. Oh, keep not captive my soul, Oh, keep not ward over
my shade, but let a way be opened for my soul--and--and for my shade,
and let--them--see the Great God in the shrine on the day of the
judgment of souls, and let--them--recite the utterances of Osiris, whose
habitations are hidden, to those who guard the members of Osiris, and
who keep ward over the Khus, and who hold captive the shades of the dead
who would work evil against me, so that they shall--not--work evil
against me. May a way for thy double--Ka--along with thee and along
with--thy--soul be prepared by those who keep ward over the members of
Osiris, and who bold captive the shades of the dead. Heaven
shall--not--keep thee, the earth shall--not--hold thee captive, thou
shalt not have they being with the divine beings who make slaughter, but
thou shalt have dominion over thy legs, and thou shalt advance to thy
body straightway in the earth--and to--those who belong to the shrine
and guard the members of Osiris."

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

### OF NOT SAILING TO THE EAST

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 6)

The chapter of not sailing to the east in the underworld. The
chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant, saith:

"Hail, phallus of Ra, who departest from thy calamity--which
ariseth--through opposition (?), the cycles have been without movement
for millions of years. I am stronger than the strong, I am mightier than
the mighty. If I sail away or if I be snatched away to the east through
the two horns," or--as others say--"if any evil and abominable thing be
done unto me at the feast of the devils, the phallus of Ra shall be
swallowed up,--along with--the head of Osiris. And behold me, for I
journey along over the fields wherein the gods mow down those who make
reply unto--their words--; now verily the two horns of the god Khepera
shall be thrust aside, and verily pus shall spring into being in the eye
of Tem along with corruption if I be kept in restraint, or if I have
gone toward the east, or if the feast of devils be made in my presence,
or if any malignant wound be inflicted upon me."

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

### OF BEING NIGH UNTO THOTH

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 7)

The chapter of being nigh unto Thoth. The chancellor-in-chief, Nu,
triumphant, saith:

"I am he who sendeth forth terror into the powers of rain and thunder,
and I ward off from the great divine lady the attacks of violence--I
have smitten like the god Shat--i.e., the god of slaughter--, and I have
out libations of cool water like the god Ashu, and I have worked for the
great divine lady--to ward off--the attacks of violence--, I have made
to flourish--my--knife along with the knife which is in the hand of
Thoth in the powers of rain and thunder."

### OF BEING NIGH UNTO THOTH

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheets 19 and 20)

The chapter of being nigh unto Thoth and of giving glory unto a man in
the underworld. The chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant, saith:

"I am the god Her-ab-maat--i.e., 'he that is within his eye--, and I
have come to give right and truth to Ra; I have made Suti to be at peace
with me by means of offerings made to the god Aker,

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

and to the Tesgeru deities, and by--making--reverence unto Seb."

The following--words are to be recited in the Sektet boat:
"--Hail,--sceptre of Anubis, I have made the four Khus who are in the
train of the lord of the universe to be at peace with me, and I am the
lord of the fields through their decree. I am the divine father
Bah--i.e., the god of the water flood--, and I do away with the thirst
of him that keepeth ward over the Lakes. Behold ye me, then, O great
gods of majesty who dwell among the Souls of Annu, for I am lifted up
over you. I am the god Menkh--i.e., Gracious One--who dwelleth among
you. Verily I have cleansed my soul, O great god of majesty, set not
before me the evil obstacles which issue from thy mouth, and let not
destruction come round about me, or upon me. I have made myself clean in
the Lake of making to be at peace,--and in the Lake of--weighing in the
balance, and I have bathed myself in Netert-utchat, which is under the
holy sycamore tree of heaven. Behold--I am--bathed,--and I
have--triumphed--over--all--mine enemies--straightway who come forth and
rise up against right and truth. I am right and true in earth. I, even
I, have spoken (?) with my mouth--which is--the power of the Lord,

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

the Only one, Ra the mighty, who liveth upon right and truth. Let not
injury be inflicted upon me,--but let me be--clothed on the day of those
who go forward (?) to every--good--thing."

### OF BRINGING A BOAT ALONG IN HEAVEN

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 9)

The chapter of bringing along a boat in heaven. The chancellor-in-chief,
triumphant, saith:

"Hail to thee, O thou Thigh which dwelleth in the northern heaven in the
Great Lake, which art seen and which dieth not. I have stood up over
thee when thou didst rise like a god. I have seen thee, and I have not
lain down in death; I have stood over thee, and I have risen like a god.
I have cackled like a goose, and I have alighted like a hawk by the
divine clouds and by the great dew. I have journeyed from the earth to
heaven. The god Shu--made--me to stand up, the god of Light hath made me
to be vigorous by the two sides of the ladder, and the stars which never
rest set--me--on--my--way and bring--me--away from slaughter. I bring
along with me the things which drive back calamities as I advance over
the passage of the god Pen; thou comest, how great art thou, O god Pen!
I have come from the Pool of Flame which is in

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

the Sekhet-Sasa--i.e., the Field of Fire.--Thou livest in the Pool of
Flame in Sekhet-Sasa, and I live upon the staff of the hold--god. Hail,
thou god Kaa, who dost bring those things which are in the boats by the
. . . I stand up in the boat and I guide myself--over--the water: I have
stood up in the boat and the god hath guided me. I have stood up. I have
spoken.--I am master of the--crops. I sail round about as I go forward,
and the gates which are in Sekhem--Letopolis--are opened unto me, and
fields are awarded unto me in the city of Unni--Hermopolis--, and
laborers (?) are given unto me together with those of my own flesh and
bone."

### OF PROTECTING THE BOAT OF RA

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 97)

The chapter of protecting the boat of Ra. "O thou that cleavest the
water as thou comest forth from the stream and dost sit upon thy place
in thy boat, sit thou upon thy place in thy boat as thou goest forth to
thy station of yesterday, and do thou join the Osiris, the overseer of
the palace, the chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant, the perfect Khu,
unto thy mariners, and let thy strength be his strength.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

"Hail, Ra, in thy name of Ra, if thou dost pass by the eye of seven
cubits, which hath a pupil of three cubits, then verily do thou
strengthen the Osiris, Nu, triumphant, the perfect Khu,--let him be
among--thy mariners, and let thy strength be his strength. Hail, Ra, in
thy name of Ra, if thou dost pass by those who are overturned in death,
then verily do thou make the Osiris, Nu, triumphant, the perfect soul,
to stand up upon his feet, and may thy strength be his strength. Hail,
Ra, in thy name of Ra, if the hidden things of the underworld are opened
unto thee and thou dost gratify (?) the heart of the cycle of thy gods,
then verily do thou grant joy of heart unto the. chancellor-in-chief,
Nu, triumphant, and let thy strength be his strength. Thy members, O Ra,
are established by--this--Chapter (?)."

--This Chapter--shall be recited over a bandlet of the fine linen of
kings--upon which--it hath been written with Anti, which shall be laid
upon the neck of the perfect Khu on the way of the burial. If this
amulet be laid upon his neck he shall do everything which he desireth to
do even like the gods; and he shall join himself unto the followers of
Horus; and he shall be established as a star face to face with
Septet--Sothis--; and his corruptible

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

body shall be as a god along with his kinsfolk forever; and the goddess
Menqet shall make plants to germinate upon his body; and the Majesty of
the God Thoth lovingly shall make the light to rest upon his corruptible
body at will, even as he did for the majesty of the King of the North
and of the South, the god Osiris, triumphant.

### ON GOING INTO THE BOAT OF RA

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,177, sheet 28)

The chapter of going into the boat of Ra. The chancellor-in-chief, Nu,
triumphant, saith:

"Hail, thou Great God who art in thy boat, bring thou me into thy
boat.--I have come forward to thy steps--, let me be the director of thy
journeyings and let me be among those who belong to thee and who are
among the stars which never rest. The things which are an abomination
unto thee and the things which are an abomination unto me I will not
eat, that which is an abomination unto me, that which is an abomination
unto me is filth and I will not eat thereof; but sepulchral offerings
and holy food--will I eat--, and I shall not be overthrown thereby. I
will not draw nigh unto filth with my hands, and I will not walk thereon
with my sandals, because my bread--is made--of white barley, and

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

my ale--is made--of red barley; and behold, the Sektet boat and the Atet
boat have brought these things and have laid the gifts (?) of the lands
upon the altar of the Souls of Annu. Hymns of praise be to thee. O
Ur-arit-s, as thou travellest through heaven! Let there be food--for
thee--, O dweller in the city of Teni--this--, and when the dogs gather
together let me not suffer harm. I myself have come, and I have
delivered the god from the things which have been inflicted upon him,
and from the grievous sickness of the body of the arm, and of the leg. I
have come and I have spit upon the body, I have bound up the arm, and I
have made the leg to walk.--I have--entered--the boat--and--I--sail
round about by the command of Ra."

### OF KNOWING THE SOULS OF THE EAST

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 19)

The chapter of knowing the souls of the east. The chancellor-in-chief,
Nu, triumphant, saith:

"I, even I, know the eastern gate of heaven--now its southern part is at
the Lake of Kharu and its northern part is at the canal of the
geese--whereout Ra cometh with the winds which make him to advance. I am
he who is concerned with the tackle (?)--which is--in the divine bark, I
am

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

the sailor who ceaseth not on the boat of Ra. I, even I, know the two
sycamores of turquoise between which Ra showed himself when he strideth
forward over the supports of Shu <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md)
toward the gate of the lord of the East through which Ra cometh forth.
I, even I, know the Sektet-Aarru of Ra, the walls of which are of iron.
The height of the wheat therein is five cubits, of the cars thereof two
cubits, and the stalks thereof three cubits. The barley therein is--in
height--seven cubits, the ears thereof are three cubits, and the stalks
thereof are four cubits. And behold, the Khus, each one of whom therein
is nine cubits in height, *reap is near* the divine Souls of the East.
I, even I, know the divine Souls of the East, that is to say,
Heru-khuti--Harmachis--, and the Calf of the goddess Khera, and the
Morning Star--daily. A divine city hath been built for me, I know it,
and I know the name thereof; 'Sekhet-Aarru' is its name."

### OF SEKHET-HETEPET

(From the Papyrus, of Nebseni, British Museum, No. 9,900, sheet 17)

Here begin the chapters of Sekhet-Hetepet, and the chapters Of Coming
Forth By Day; of going

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

into and of coming out from the underworld; of coming to Sekhet-Aaru; of
being in Sekhet, the mighty land, the lady of winds; of having power
there; of becoming a Khu there; of ploughing there; of eating there; of
drinking there; of making love there; and of doing everything even as a
man doeth upon earth. Behold the scribe and artist of the Temple of
Ptah, Nebseni, who saith:

"Set hath taken possession of Horus, who looked with the two eyes upon
the building (?) round Sekhet-Hetepet, but I have unfettered Horus--and
taken him from--Set, and Set hath opened the ways of the two eyes--which
are--in heaven. Set hath cast (?) his moisture to the winds upon the
soul--that hath--his day--or his eye--and who dwelleth in the city of
Mert, and he hath delivered the interior of the body of Horus from the
gods of Akert. Behold me now, for I make this mighty boat to travel over
the Lake of Hetep, and I brought it away with might from the palace of
Shu; the domain of his stars groweth young and reneweth its former
strength. I have brought the boat into the lakes thereof so that I may
come forth into the cities thereof, and I have sailed into their divine
city Hetep. And behold, it is because I, even I, am at Peace with his
seasons, and with

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

his guidance, and with his territory, and with the company of gods who
are his first born. He maketh the two divine fighters--i.e., Horus and
Set--to be at peace with those who watch over the living ones whom he
hath created in fair form, and he bringeth peace--with him--; he maketh
the two divine fighters to be at peace with those who watch over them.
He cutteth off the hair from the divine fighters, be driveth away storm
from the helpless, and he keepeth harm from the Khus. Let me gain
dominion within that Field, for I know it, and I have sailed among its
lakes so that I might come into the cities. My mouth is strong; and I am
equipped--with weapons to use--against the Khus; let them not have
dominion over me. Let me be rewarded with thy fields, O thou a god
Hetep; that which is thy wish, shalt thou do, O lord of the winds. May I
become a khu therein, may I eat therein, may I drink therein, may I
plough therein, may I reap therein, may I fight therein, may I make love
therein, may my words be mighty therein, may I never be in a state of
servitude therein, but may I be in authority therein. Thou hast made
strong (?) the mouth and the throat (?) of the god Hetep; Qetetbu is its
(?) name. He is established upon the watery supports

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (?) of the god Shu, and is linked unto the
pleasant things of Ra. He is the divider of years, he is hidden of
mouth, his mouth is silent, that which he uttereth is secret, he
fulfilleth eternity and taketh possession of everlastingness of
existence as Hetep, the lord Hetep. The god Horus maketh himself to be
strong like unto the Hawk which is one thousand cubits in length and two
thousand--cubits in width--in life; he hath equipments with him, and he
journeyeth on and cometh where the seat of his heart wisheth in the
Pools thereof and in the cities thereof. He was begotten in the
birth-chamber of the god of the city, he hath offerings--made unto
him--of the food of the god of the city, he performeth that which is
meet to do therein, and the union thereof, in the matter of everything
of the birth-chamber of the divine city. When--he--setteth in life like
crystal he performeth everything therein, and these things are like unto
the things which are done in the Lake of double Fire, wherein there is
none that rejoiceth, and wherein are all manner of evil things. The god
Hetep goeth in, and cometh out, and goeth backward--in--that, Field that
gathereth together all manner of things for the birth-chamber of the god
of the city. When he setteth in life like crystal he performeth all
manner

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

of things therein which are like unto the things which are done in the
Lake of double Fire, wherein there is none that rejoiceth, and wherein
are no evil things whatsoever. --Let me--live with the god Hetep,
clothed and not despoiled by the lords of the north (?) and may the
lords of divine things bring food unto me; may he make me to go forward
and may I come forth, and may he bring my power to me there, and may I
receive it, and may my equipment be from the god Hetep. May I gain the
mastery over the great and mighty word which is in my body in this my
place, and by it I will remember and I will forget. Let me go forward in
my journey, and let me plough. I am at peace in the divine city <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md), and I know the waters, cities, nomes, and
lakes which are in Sekhet-hetep. I exist therein, I am strong therein, I
become a khu therein, I eat therein, I sow seed therein, I reap the
harvest therein, I plough therein, I make love therein, I am at peace
with the god Hetep therein. Behold I scatter seed therein, I sail about
among its lakes and I come forward to the cities thereof, O divine
Hetep. Behold my mouth is equipped with thy horns--for teeth--, grant me
an overflowing supply of the food whereon the kas and

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

khus--live--. I have passed the judgment of Shu upon him that knoweth
him, so that I may go forth to the cities thereof, and may sail about
among its lakes and may walk about in Sekhet-hetep; and behold, Ra is in
heaven, and behold, the god Hetep is its double offering. I have come
onward to its land, I have put on my girdle (?), I have come forth so
that the gifts which are about to be given unto me may be given, I have
made gladness for myself. I have laid hold upon my strength which the
god Hetep hath greatly increased for me. O Unen-em-hetep, <span
id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md) I have entered into thee and my soul
followeth after me, and my divine food is upon both my hands, O Lady of
the two lands, <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md) who establishest my
word whereby I remember and forget; I would live without injury, without
any injury--being done--unto me, oh, grant to me, oh, do thou grant to
me, joy of heart. Make thou me to be at peace, bind thou up my sinews
and muscles, and make me to receive the air. O Un (en)-em-hetep, thou
Lady of the winds, I have entered into thee and I have opened--i.e.,
shown--my head. Ra falleth asleep,

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

but I am awake, and there is the goddess Hast at the gate of heaven by
night. Obstacles have been set before me, but I have gathered together
what he hath emitted. I am in my city. O Nut-urt, <span
id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) I have entered into thee and I have
counted my harvest, and I go forward to Uakh. <span
id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40.md) I am the bull enveloped in turquoise, the
lord of the Field of the Bull, the lord of the divine speech of the
goddess Septer--Sothis--at her hours. O Uakh, I have entered into thee,
I have eaten my bread, I have gotten the mastery over choice pieces of
the flesh of oxen and of feathered fowl, and the birds of Shu have been
given unto me; I follow after the gods and--I come after--the divine
kas. O Tchefet, <span id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41.md) I have entered in to
thee. I array myself in apparel, and I gird myself with the sa garment
of Ra; now behold,--he is--in heaven and those who dwell therein follow
Ra, and--I--follow Ra in heaven. O Unen-em-hetep, lord of the two lands,
I have entered into thee, and I have plunged into the lakes of Tchesert;
behold me, for all filth hath departed from me. The Great God groweth
therein, and behold, I have found--food therein--; I have

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

snared feathered fowl and I feed upon the finest--of them--. O
Qenqentet, <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) I have entered into thee,
and I have seen the Osiris--my father--, and I have gazed upon my
mother, and I have made love. I have caught the worms and serpents, and
I am delivered. And I know the name of the god who is opposite to the
goddess Tchesert, and who hath straight hair and is equipped with two
horns; he reapeth, and I both plough and reap. O Hast, I have entered in
to thee, I have driven back those who would come to the
turquoise--sky--, and I have followed the winds of the company of the
gods. The Great God hath given my head unto me, and he who hath bound on
me my head is the Mighty one who hath turquoise (?) eyes, namely,
Ari-en-ab-f--i.e., he doeth as he pleaseth--. O Usert, <span
id="fr_43"></span>[2](#fn_43.md) I have come into thee at the head of the
house wherein divine food is brought for me. O Smam, <span
id="fr_44"></span>[3](#fn_44.md) I have come into thee. My heart watcheth,
my head is equipped with the white crown, I am led into celestial
regions, and I make to flourish terrestrial objects, and there is joy of
heart for the

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Bull, and for celestial beings, and for the
company of the gods. I am the god who is the Bull, the lord of the gods,
as he goeth forth from the turquoise--sky---. O divine nome of wheat and
barley, I have come into thee, I have come forward to thee and I have
taken up that which followeth me, namely the best of the libations of
the company of the gods. I have tied up my boat in the celestial lakes,
I have lifted up the post at which to anchor, I have recited the
prescribed words with my voice, and I have ascribed praise unto the gods
who dwell in Sekhet-hetep."

### OF KNOWING THE SOULS OF PE

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 18)

Another chapter of knowing the souls of Pe. The overseer of the palace,
the chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant, saith:

"--Hail, --Khat, who dwellest in Khat, in Anpet, <span
id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md) and in the nome of Khat! --Hail,--ye
goddesses of the class who dwell in the city of Pe, ye celestial lands
(?), ye stars, and ye divine beings, who give cakes and ale (?), do ye
know for what reason the city of Pe hath been given unto Horus? I, even
I, know though ye knoweth it not. Behold

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ra gave the city unto him in return for the
injury in his eye, for which cause Ra said to Horus, 'Let me see what is
coming to pass in thine eye,' and forthwith he looked thereat. Then Ra
said to Horus, 'Look at that black pig,' and he looked, and straightway
an injury was done unto his eye,--namely--, a mighty storm--took
place--. Then said Horus unto Ra, 'Verily, my eye seems as if it were an
eye upon which Suti had inflicted a blow';--and thus saying--he ate his
heart. <span id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) Then said Ra to those gods,
'Place ye him in his chamber, and he shall do well.' Now the black pig
was Suti who had transformed himself into a black pig, and it was he who
had aimed the blow of fire which was in the eye of Horus. Then said Ra
unto those gods, 'The pig is an abominable thing unto Horus; oh, but he
shall do well although the pig is an abomination unto him.' Then the
company of the gods, who were among the divine followers of Horus when
he existed in the form of his own child, said, 'Let sacrifice be
made--to the gods--of his bulls, and of his goats, and of his pigs.' Now
the father of Mesthi, Hapi, Tuamautef and Qebhsennuf is Horus, and their
mother is Isis. Then said Horus to Ra, 'Give me two divine brethren in
the

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

city of Pe and two divine brethren in the city of Nekhen, who--have
sprung--from my body and who shall be with me in the guise of
everlasting judges, then shall the earth blossom and thunderclouds and
rain be blotted out.' And the name of Horus became 'Her-uatch-f'--i.e.,
Prince of his emerald stone.--I, even I, know the Souls of Pe, namely,
Horus, Mesthi, and Hapi."

### OF THE SWALLOW

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 10)

The chapter of making the transformation into a swallow. The
chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant, saith:

"I am a swallow, I am a swallow. I am the scorpion, the daughter of Ra.
Hail, ye gods, whose scent is sweet; hail, ye gods, whose scent is sweet
I --Hail--, Flame, which cometh forth from the horizon! Hail, thou who
art in the city, I have brought the Warden of his Bight therein. Oh,
stretch out unto me thy hand so that I may be able to pass my days in
the Pool of Double Fire, and let me advance with my message, for I have
come with words to tell. Oh, open--thou--the doors to me and I will
declare the things which have been seen by me. Horus hath become the
divine Prince

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

of the Boat of the Sun, and unto him hath been given the throne of his
divine father Osiris, and Set, that son of Nut,--lieth--under the
fetters which he had made for me. I have made a computation of what is
in the city of Sekhem, I have stretched out both my hands and arms at
the word (?) of Osiris, I have passed on to judgment, and I have come
that--I--may speak, grant that I may pass on and declare my tidings. I
enter in,--I--am-judged, and--I--come forth worthy at the gate of
Neb-er-tcher. I am pure at the great place of the passage of souls, I
have done away with my sins, I have put away mine offences, and I have
destroyed the evil which appertained unto my members upon earth. Hail,
ye divine beings who guard the doors, make ye for me a way, for, behold,
I am like unto you. I have come forth by day, I have journeyed on, on my
legs, and I have gained the mastery over my footsteps--before--the God
of Light, I know the hidden ways and the doors of the Sekhet-Aaru,
verily I, even I, have come. I have overthrown mine enemies upon earth,
and yet my perishable body is in the gravel"

 

If this chapter be known--by the deceased--he shall come forth by day,
he shall not be turned back

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

at any gate in the underworld, and he shall make his transformation into
a swallow regularly and continually.

### TRANSFORMATION INTO A LOTUS

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 11)

The chapter of making the transformation into a lotus. The overseer of
the palace, the chancellor-in-chief, Nu, saith:

"I am the pure Lotus which springeth up from the divine splendor that
belongeth to the nostrils of Ra. I have made--my way--, and I follow on
seeking for him who is Horus. I am the pure one who cometh forth out of
the Field."

### TRANSFORMATION INTO A LOTUS

(From the Papyrus of Paqrer--see Naville, op. cit., Bd. I, Bl. 93)

The chapter of making the transformation into a lotus. Saith Osiris
Paqrer:

"Hail, thou lotus, thou type of the god Nefer-Temu! I am the man that
knoweth you, and I know your names among--those of--the gods, the lords
of the underworld, and I am one of you. Grant ye that--I--may see the
gods who are the divine guides in the Tuat--underworld,--and grant ye
unto me a place in the underworld near unto the

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

lords of Amentet. Let me arrive at a habitation in the land of Tchesert,
and receive me, O all ye gods, in the presence of the lords of eternity.
Grant that my soul may come forth whithersoever it pleaseth, and let it
not be driven away from the presence of the great company of Gods."

### TRANSFORMATION INTO PTAH

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheets 9 and 10)

The chapter of making the transformation into Ptah, of eating cakes, and
of drinking ale, and of unfettering the steps, and of becoming a living
being in Annu--Heliopolis. The chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant,
saith:

"I fly like a hawk, I cackle like the smen goose, and I preach upon that
abode of the underworld--aat--on the festival of the great Being. That
which is an abomination unto me, I have not eaten; filth is an
abomination unto me and I have not eaten thereof, and that which is an
abomination unto my ka hath not entered into my belly. Let me, then,
live upon that which the gods and the Khus decree for me; let me live
and let me have power over cakes; let me eat them before the gods and
the Khus--who have a favor--unto me; let me have

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

power over--these cakes--and let me eat of them under the--shade of
the--leaves of the palm tree of the goddess Hathor, who is my divine
Lady. Let the offering of the sacrifice, and the offering of cakes, and
vessels of libations be made in Annu; let me clothe myself in the taau
garment--which I shall receive--from the hand of the goddess Tait; let
me stand up and let me sit down wheresoever I please. My head is like
unto that of Ra, and--when my members are--gathered together--I am--like
unto Tem; the four--sides of the domain--of Ra, and the width of the
earth four times. I come forth. My tongue is like unto that of Ptah and
my throne is like unto that of the goddess Hathor, and I make mention of
the words of Tem, my father, with my mouth. He it is who constraineth
the handmaid, the wife of Seb, and before him are bowed--all--heads, and
there is fear of him. Hymns of praise are repeated for--me--by reason
of--my--mighty acts, and I am decreed to be the divine Heir of Seb, the
lord of the earth, and to be the protector therein. The god Seb
refresheth me, and he maketh his risings to be mine. Those who dwell in
Annu bow down their heads unto me, for I am their lord and I am their
bull. I am more powerful than the lord of time, and I shall enjoy

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

the pleasures of love, and shall gain the mastery over millions of
years.

### OF PERFORMING TRANSFORMATIONS

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 10)

The chapter of performing the transformation into a hawk of gold. The
chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant, saith:

"I have risen, I have risen like a mighty hawk--of gold--that cometh
forth from his egg; I fly and I alight like the hawk which hath a back
four cubits wide, and the wings of which are Eke unto the
mother-of-emerald of the south. I have come forth from the interior of
the Sektet boat, and my heart hath been brought unto me from the
mountain of the east. I have alighted upon the Atet boat, and those who
were dwelling in their companies have been brought unto me, and they
bowed low in paying homage unto me and in saluting me with cries of joy.
I have risen, I have gathered myself together like the beautiful hawk of
gold, which hath the head of a Bennu bird, and Ra entereth in day by day
to hearken unto my words; I have taken my seat among those first-born
gods of Nut. I am established, and the divine Sekhet-hetep is before me,
I have eaten therein, I have become a khu therein, I

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

have an abundance therein--as much as I desire--the god Nepra hath given
to me my throat, and I have gained the mastery over that which
guardeth--or belongeth to--my head."

### COMING FORTH BY DAY

(From the Papyrus of Mes-em-neter, Naville, op. cit., Bd. I, Bl. 81)

Another chapter:

"I am the Fire-god, the divine brother of the Fire-god, and--I
am--Osiris the brother of Isis. My divine son, together with his mother
Isis, hath avenged me on mine enemies. My enemies have wrought
every--kind of--evil, therefore their arms, and hands, and feet, have
been fettered by reason of their wickedness which they have wrought upon
me. I am Osiris, the first-born of the divine womb, the first-born of
the gods, and the heir of my father Osiris-Seb (?). I am Osiris, the
lord of the heads that live, mighty of breast and powerful of back, with
a phallus which goeth to the remotest limits--where---men and
women--live--. I am Sah--Orion--who travelleth over his domain and who
journeyeth along before the stars of heaven,--which is--the belly of my
mother Nut; she conceived me through her love, and she gave birth to me
because it was her will to do so. I am Anpu--Anubis--on

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

the day of the god Sepa. I am the Bull at the head of the meadow. I,
even I, am Osiris who imprisoned his father together with his mother on
the day of making the great slaughter; now--his--father is Seb,
and--his--mother is Nut. I am Horus, the first-born of Ra of the
risings. I am Anpu--Anubis--on the day of--the god Sepa. I, even I, am
the lord Tem. I am Osiris. Hail, thou divine first-born, who dost enter
and dost speak before the divine Scribe and Doorkeeper of Osiris, grant
that I may come. I have become a khu, I have been judged, I have become
a divine being, I have come, and I have avenged mine own body. I have
taken up my seat by the divine birth-chamber of Osiris, and I have
destroyed the sickness and suffering which were there. I have become
mighty, and I have become a divine being by the side of the
birth-chamber of Osiris, I am brought forth with him, I renew my youth,
I take possession of my two thighs which are in the place where is
Osiris, and I open the mouth of the gods therewith, I take my seat by
his side, and Thoth cometh forth, and--I am--strengthened in heart with
thousands of cakes upon the altars of my divine father, and with my
beasts, and with my cattle, and with my red feathered fowl, and with my
oxen, and with my

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

geese, and with my ducks, for Horus my Chieftain, and with the offerings
which I make to Thoth, and with the sacrifices which I offer up to
An-heri-ertaitsa."

### THE CHAPTER OF BRINGING CHARMS TO OSIRIS

(From the Papyrus of Ani, British Museum, No. 10,470, sheet 15)

The chapter of bringing charms unto Osiris Ani--in the underworld. He
saith:

"I am Tem-Khepera, who brought himself into being upon the thigh of his
divine mother. Those who are in Nu--i.e., the sky--are made wolves, and
those who are among the sovereign princes are become hyenas. Behold, I
gather together the charm--from every place where--it is, and from every
man with whom it is, swifter than greyhounds and quicker than light.
Hail, thou who towest along the Makhent boat of Ra, the stays of thy
sails and of thy rudder are taut in the wind as thou sailest up the Pool
of Fire in the underworld. Behold, thou gatherest together the charm
from every place where it is, and from every man with whom it is,
swifter than greyhounds and quicker than light,--the charm--which
created the forms of being from the . . . mother, and which either
created the gods or maketh them silent, and which

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

giveth the heat of fire unto the gods. Behold, the charm is given unto
me, from wherever it is--and from him with whom it is--, swifter than
greyhounds and quicker than light," or--as others say--"quicker than a
shadow."

### THE CHAPTER OF MEMORY

(From the Papyrus of Nu, British Museum, No. 10,477, sheet 5)

The chapter of making a man to possess memory in the underworld. The
chancellor-in-chief, Nu, triumphant, the overseer of the palace, the son
of the chief chancellor Amen-hetep, saith:

"May my name be given to me in the Great House, and may I remember my
name in the House of Fire on the night of counting the years and of
telling the number of the months. I am with the Divine One, and I sit on
the eastern side of heaven. If any god whatsoever should advance unto
me, let me be able to proclaim his name forthwith."

### THE CHAPTER OF GIVING A HEART TO OSIRIS

(From the Papyrus of Ani, British Museum, No. 10,470, sheet 15)

The chapter of giving a heart to Osiris Ani in the underworld. He saith:

"May my heart--ah--be with me in the House of Hearts! May my
heart--hat--be with me in

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

the House of Hearts! May my heart be with me, and may it rest
there,--or--I shall not eat of the cakes of Osiris on the eastern side
of the Lake of Flowers, neither shall I have a boat wherein to go down
the Nile, nor another wherein to go up, nor shall I be able to sail down
the Nile with thee. May my mouth--be given--to me that I may speak
therewith, and my two legs to walk therewith, and my two hands and arms
to overthrow my foe. May the doors of heaven be opened unto me; may Seb,
the Prince of the gods, open wide his two jaws unto me, may he open my
two eyes which are blindfolded; may he cause me to stretch apart my two
legs which are bound together; and may Anpu-Anubis--make my thighs firm
so that I may stand upon them. May the goddess Sekhet make me to rise so
that I may ascend unto heaven, and may that be done which I command in
the House of ka--double--of Ptah--i.e., Memphis--. I understand with my
heart. I have gained the mastery over my heart, I have gained the
mastery over my two hands, I have gained the mastery over my legs, I
have gained the power to do whatsoever my ka--double--pleaseth. My soul
shall not be fettered to my body at the gates of the underworld; but I
shall enter in peace and I shall come forth in peace."

# HYMN TO RA

(From the Papyrus of Ani, British Museum, No. 10,470, sheet 20)

A hymn of praise to Ra when he riseth in the eastern part of heaven.
Those who are in his train rejoice, and lo! Osiris Ani, victorious
saith:

"Hail thou Disk, thou lord of rays, who risest on

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

the horizon day by day! Shine thou with thy beams of light upon the face
of Osiris Ani, who is victorious; for he singeth hymns of praise unto
thee at dawn, and he maketh thee to set at eventide with words of
adoration. May the soul of Osiris Ani, the triumphant one, come forth
with thee into heaven, may he go forth in the Mater boat. May he come
into port in the Sekter boat, and may he cleave his path among the
never-resting stars in the heavens."
