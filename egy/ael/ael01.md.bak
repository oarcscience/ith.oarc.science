### PREFACE

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> this book I have retold the legends of
the Gods of ancient Egypt, legends, which were current in the "morning
of the world," preserved to the present day engraved on stone and
written on papyri. I have told them in my own way, adhering strictly to
the story, but arranging the words and phrases according to the English
method; retaining, however, as far as possible the expressions and
metaphors of the Egyptian. In some cases I have inserted whole sentences
in order to make the sense clear; these are in places where the story
divides naturally into several parts, as in "The Battles of Horus," and
"The Regions of Night and Thick Darkness"; where each incident, so like
the one preceding and the one following, is kept distinct in the mind of
the reader by this means. This repetition is quite in accordance with
the style of Egyptian literature.

The book is intended entirely for the general public, who are
increasingly interested in the religion and civilisation of ancient
Egypt, but

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

whose only means of obtaining knowledge of that country is apparently
through magazine stories in which a mummy is the principal character. It
may be worth noting that in these legends of ancient Egypt mummies are
not mentioned, except in the Duat, the home of the dead, where one
naturally expects to find them.

Though the book is intended for the unscientific reader, I have made
some provision for the more serious student, in the Notes at the end. In
these I have given the origin of the legend, the book or books in which
that original is published, and the book where the translation into a
modern language by one of the great scholars of the day can be found.
Other translations there are in plenty, which can be seen in specialist
libraries; many of these, however, are of use only to a student of
Egyptian literature and language.

I have arranged the sequence of the stories according to my own ideas:
first, the legends of various, one might almost say miscellaneous, gods;
then the legends of Osiris and the deities connected with him; lastly,
the legends of Ra. At the very end are Notes on the legends, and a short
index of all the gods mentioned.
