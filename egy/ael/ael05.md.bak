### II

### THE KING'S DREAM

<span class="smallcaps">Long</span>, long ago lived Thothmes, King of
Egypt; Lord of the Two Lands was he, Wearer of the double Diadem, he
whom the Gods loved. He was not that Thothmes, the mighty Bull, who
conquered Syria, Nubia, and the nine Archer-tribes. But he bore the same
name, and was a great and valorous king; Syria bowed before him, Nubia
was his servant, and he trod the nine Archer-tribes beneath his feet.
When he was a child, he was like unto Harpocrates, the son of Isis, he
who was born in the marshes of the North Country. Beautiful was he with
the beauty of the Gods, in form like Horus, the Avenger of his father.

And in all manly sports did he excel; he hunted the wild game on the
deserts both north and south of Memphis, he coursed the lions and the
deer, he shot arrows at a target, he drove in his chariot, and his
horses were fleeter than the wind. Alone did he hunt, or with two
companions only, and none knew the path that he

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

would follow, for in the desert none live save wild beasts.

When his followers required rest in the heat of the day, he took them to
the great statue of Harmachis close to Kher-aha, where the Road of the
God leads eastward to On. Of stone was this mighty figure, hewn out of
the living rock, his face the face of a man, stern and majestic, turned
to the rising sun, his body the body of a lion; upon his brow is the
death-dealing snake with head erect, ready to strike. Men call this
figure Harmachis, and the Sphinx, and the Father of Terrors. Great and
exalted is this figure of the God, resting in his chosen place; mighty
is his power, for the Shadow of the Sun is upon him. The temples of
Memphis and the temples of every town on both sides adore him, they
stretch out their hands to him in adoration, sacrifices and libations
are made before him.

One day, ere Thothmes was yet king, before he had ascended the throne of
Horus the Living One, it came to pass that he hunted alone in the
desert, and it was noontide. Very fierce was the heat, very blinding the
sunbeams, and he rested in the shadow of the great God. And as he
rested, heated and weary, in the coolness of the shadow, sleep heavy and
deep came upon him at the moment when the sun reached the zenith.

Thus he slept at broad midday, and in his sleep dreams and visions came
to him. In his dream

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

he stood before the giant figure of the God, but no longer was it of
stone, for behold it was the God himself. The breath of life was in him,
and his lips moved, and he spoke with gentle speech as a father speaks
with his child, for his words were words of blessing.

"See now, O my son Thothmes," he said, "look at me, behold me. I am thy
father, I who am Harmachis, and Ra, and Khepera, and Atmu also. For I am
the Sun-god to whom all lands are subject. Through me alone shall the
kingdom of Egypt come to thee; thou shalt wear the White Crown of the
South Land and the Red Crown of the North Land, thou shalt sit upon the
throne of Geb the inheritor. To thee shall belong the whole land in its
length and breadth, that land which the universal Lord makes glorious.
Want and trouble shall never come nigh thee, for gifts shall be brought
to thee from every country, near and afar; the duration of thy life
shall be for many years; my face shall be towards thee and my heart
shall incline to thee if thou wilt do for me that which I desire of
thee."

And Thothmes looked, and he saw that the figure lay half-buried in the
sand, and it seemed as though the God struggled to free himself, for
naught but the head appeared above the plain, and the sands came up
about him like the waves of the sea when they swallow up a ship that is
on the rocks.

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

Then the Majesty of the God spoke again, and said, "The sand of the
desert on which I rest is about me, it overwhelms me, it covers me.
Hasten to do that which my heart desires, for I know that thou art a son
who honours the behests of his father."

Sleep fell from the eyelids of Thothmes, and he awoke.

\[Here the inscription is broken away and the end of the story is not
