### SECOND DIVISION OF THE TUAT.

#### II. THE KINGDOM OF KHENTI-AMENTI-OSIRIS ACCORDING TO THE BOOK OF GATES.

To advance into this Division the Boat of AFU-RA must first pass through
the Gate which is guarded by the huge serpent SAA-SET, and this done the
god now takes upon himself the form in which he appears in the BOOK
AM-TUAT, i.e., that of a ram-headed man. The snake-goddess MEHEN, which
surrounded the disk enclosing a beetle, now envelops the shrine in which
he stands; it must be noted that SA and HEKAU stand, as before, in the
Boat, which is now towed along by four gods of the Tuat, who represent
the four quarters of the earth and the four cardinal points. The Boat is
received by a company of thirteen gods, who are apparently under the
rule of a god who holds a staff. The object of the visit of AFU-RA is to
"weigh words and deeds in Ament, to make a distinction between the great
and little gods, to assign thrones to the Spirits \[who are pure\], to
dismiss the damned to the place set apart for them, and to destroy their
bodies." (vol. ii., p. 91). Now this is an important statement, for it
distinctly implies that a judgment of the dead takes place in the Second
Division, or Hour, of the Tuat,

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

which is here called AMENT, that the positions of the dead are graded,
and that reward and punishment are meted out to the dead, according to
their deserts. It is said by AFU-RA to the dwellers in AMENT, "the dead
(*mitu*) shall not enter in after you"; which proves that, wherever the
place of punishment was, it was not in the SECOND Division of the Tuat.
The gods who assist AFU-RA in his work of judgment are said to live upon
the offerings made to them upon earth; here was a direct inducement to
the faithful to make offerings regularly to the gods of the Tuat, and it
was understood that such acts of piety would tell on their behalf when
their words and deeds came to be weighed in Ament. The reader will note
that it is AFU-RA who is the judge here, and not Osiris.

Examining now the beings who are on both banks of the river we see that
they fall naturally into two classes, viz., the good and the bad; the
former are on the right hand of the god, and the latter on his left,
just as saints and sinners are arraigned before God's throne in
mediaeval pictures of the Judgment. The good are divided into two
classes, "the HETEPTIU who praise RA," and the "MAATIU who dwell in the
Tuat" (vol. ii., p. 93). The HETEPTIU are thus called because they made
"offerings" (*hetepet*) to Ra upon earth, and burned incense to him;
they also sang praises to RA and worshipped him upon earth, and uttered
*hekau*, or words of power, against APEP, the

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

arch-foe of Ra (vol. ii., p. 94). From this text we see that it was not
enough for the followers of Ra to praise him and give him gifts, but
that they must also use magical words and formulae in order that Ra's
foe may be destroyed; and, because when they were upon earth they made
offerings to the Tuat-gods, now that they are themselves in the Tuat and
have need of food, Ra declares that offerings made to them shall never
fail, and their souls shall never be destroyed. The MAATIU beings have
this name given to them because, as the text says, "they spoke *Maat*,"
i.e., what is true, "upon earth"; moreover, "they did not approach the
*neterit*." Now the word *neterit* usually means "goddesses," but here
it has an unusual determinative, which, however, suggests that it is
used to express some idea of "evil" in connexion with the gods or
goddesses, such as blasphemy, or contempt, or apostacy. On the whole it
seems most likely that *neterit* means "false gods," that is to say,
gods whom Ra would not recognize as such, and that the feminine form of
the word, with the unusual determinative, indicates they were weak and
miserable beings. As a reward for their veracity and orthodoxy (?) upon
earth, the food on which they live is *Maat*, i.e., truth, and they
themselves become *Maat*, or TRUTH itself, and they are permitted to
invoke the god in the Gate. Ra, moreover, gives them the mastery over
the waters of the region, which, though cool and refreshing to the
MAATIU beings

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

themselves, become "waters of fire" (vol. ii., p. 95) to those who are
sinners and are involved in wickedness. We have already seen that the
wicked were not allowed to enter this Division, therefore it appears
that it was held to be possible for the dead round about it to attempt
to drink of the cool waters, which straightway turned into fire and
consumed them.

Turning now to those beings who stand to the left of the Boat (vol. ii.,
pp. 96-99), we see that they are twenty-four in number; of these four
lie dead, or helpless, and are called ENENIU, i.e., the "Inert," and
twenty stand with their backs bowed, and their arms tied at their elbows
behind them, in an agonizing position. Here, it is clear, are beings who
are fettered and stand awaiting their doom. The charges made against
them are to the effect that: 1. They blasphemed Ra upon earth. 2. They
invoked evil upon him that was in the Egg. 3. They thrust aside the
right. 4. They spoke against KHUTI. The god referred to as being "in the
Egg" is, of course, a form of the Sun-god, and we know from the LIVth
Chapter of the Book of the Dead, that the EGG was laid by KENKENUR, or
the "Great Cackler." The good KHUTI is the form of the Sun-god at
sunrise and sunset, and thus we see that all the sins which were
committed by the ENENIU and their fettered companions were against Ra,
and against forms of him. The name given to these is "STAU," i.e.,
"Apostates of the Hall of Ra," and sentence of doom is passed upon them
by TEMU on behalf of Ra; it is

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

decreed that their arms shall never be untied again, that their bodies
shall be cut to pieces, and that their souls shall cease to exist (vol.
ii., p. 97). Such are the things which take place in the Second Division
of the Tuat according to the BOOK OF GATES, and, view them in whatever
way we may, it is impossible not to conclude that the Egyptians thought
that those who praised and worshipped Ra upon earth were rewarded with
good things, whilst those who treated him lightly were punished. It is
evident also that the offering up of propitiatory sacrifices and making
of peace offerings were encouraged by the religion of Osiris, as being
good both for gods and men.
