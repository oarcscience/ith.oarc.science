### NINTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT.

#### I. KINGDOM OF OSIRIS ACCORDING TO THE BOOK AM-TUAT.

The name of this DIVISION, or HOUR, Or CITY, is BEST-ARU-ANKHET-KHEPERU,
the Gate is called SAA-EM-KEB, and its Hour-goddess is
TUATET-MAKETET-EN-NEB-S. The Boat of AFU-RA now enters the last of the
four DIVISIONS of the Kingdom of Osiris, and moves without the aid of
towing. Immediately in front of it are twelve sailor-gods, each grasping
a short paddle with both hands; they appear to have been depicted in
front of the Boat because there was no room for them in it. The god is
still under the form of MEHEN, and is still passing over the secret path
of AMENTET, and his Sailors sing to him, and as they do so they scatter
water from the stream with their paddles on the Spirits who dwell in
this City (vol. i., pp. 189-191). In front of these are three deities,
seated on baskets, and the god HETEP-NETERU-TUAT; they accompany the
Boat of AFU-RA, and it is their duty to provide food, or offerings, for
the gods who are in the DIVISION. On the right of the path of the god
are twelve uraei, who lighten the darkness by means of the fire which
they pour out from their

mouths: they rest upon objects which suggest that they have received
their places in this DIVISION because all the appointed funeral rites
and ceremonies were duly performed for them (vol. i., p. 201). In front
of these are the nine gods who represent the field-labourers in the Tuat
(vol. i., pp. 204, 205), and each holds a heavy stick, similar to that
which the peasants in Egypt have always carried to protect themselves.
Their "ganger" is HERU-HER-SHE-TUAT, i.e., "He who is over the lakes (or
sand) in the Tuat."

On the left of the path of the god are twelve gods, each of whom is
seated on a weaving instrument (vol. i., p. 195), and twelve goddesses
(vol. i., p. 199); the gods are the TCHATCHA, or "Great Chiefs" of
Osiris, and their duty is to avenge Osiris each day, and to overthrow
the enemies of Osiris, and the goddesses spring into existence when they
hear the god's voice, and sing praises to Osiris each day.
