### COL. V.

\(1\) And you set up your \[planisphere?\] and you stamp on the ground
with your foot seven times and recite these charms to the Foreleg,
turning (?) to the North seven times (2) and you return, down and go to
a dark recess.

\(3\) A question-form, tested. You go to a dark clean recess with its
face open to the south and you purify it with (4) natron-water, and you
take a new white lamp in which no red earth or gum-water has been put
and place a clean wick (5) in it and fill it with real oil after writing
this name and these figures on the wick with ink of myrrh beforehand;
(6) and you lay it on a new brick before you, its underside being spread
with sand; and you pronounce these spells over the lamp again another
seven times. You display frankincense in front of (7) the lamp and you
look at the lamp; then you see the god about the lamp and you lie down
on a rush mat without speaking (8) to any one on earth. Then he makes
answer to you by dream. Behold its invocation. Formula: (*In margin*:
Behold the spells which you write on the wick; Bakhukhsikhukh, *and
figures*)

\(9\) 'Ho! I am Murai, Muribi, Babel, Baoth, Bamui, the great
Agathodaemon, (10) Muratho, the ... form of soul that resteth above in
the heaven of heavens, (11) Tatot (*bis*), Bouel (*bis*), Mouihtahi (?)
(*bis*), Lahi (*bis*), Bolboel, I (*bis*), Aa, Tat (*bis*), Bouel
(*bis*), Yohel (*bis*),the first servant (12) of the great god, he who
giveth light exceedingly, the companion of the flame, he in whose mouth
is the fire that is not quenched, the great god who is seated (13) in
the fire, he who is in the midst of the fire which is in the lake of
heaven, in whose hand is the greatness and the power of god; reveal
thyself to me(14) here to-day in the fashion, of thy revelation to Moses
which thou didst make upon the mountain, before whom thou thyself didst
create darkness and light, (15)--*insertion*--I pray thee that thou
reveal thyself to me here to-night and speak with me and give me answer
in truth without falsehood; for I will glorify thee (16) in Abydos, I
will glorify thee in heaven before Phre, I will glorify thee before the
Moon, I will glorify thee (17) before him who is upon the throne, who is
not destroyed, he (= thou) of the great glory, Peten (*bis*), Pater,
Enphe (*bis*), (18) O god who is above heaven, in whose hand is the
beautiful staff, who created deity, deity not having created him. Come
down &lt;in&gt; to me (19) into the midst of this flame that is here
before thee, thou of Boel (*bis*),and let me see the business that I ask
about (20) to-night truly without falsehood. Let it be seen (?), let it
be heard (?), O great god Sisihoout, otherwise said Armioouth, come (21)
in before me and give me answer to that which

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span> <span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

\[paragraph continues\] I shall ask about, truly without falsehood. O
great god that is on the mountain (22) of Atuki (of Gabaon), Khabaho,
Takrtat, come in to me, let my eyes be opened to-night for any given
thing (23) that I shall ask about, truly without falsehood . the voice
(?) of the Leasphot, Neblot ... lilas.' Seven times: and you lie down
(24) without speaking.

The ointment which you put on your eyes when you are about to inquire of
the lamp in any lamp-divination: you take some flowers (25) of the Greek
bean; you find them in the place of the garland-seller, otherwise said
of the lupin-seller; you take them fresh and put them (26) in a
*lok*-vessel of glass and stop its mouth very well for twenty days in a
secret dark place. After twenty days, if you (27) take it out and open
it, you find a pair (?) of testicles in it with a phallus. You leave it
for forty days and when you take it out (28) and open it, you find that
it has become bloody; then you put it on a glass thing and put the glass
thing into a pottery thing (29) in a place hidden at all times. When you
desire to make inquiry of the lamp with it at any time if you fill your
eyes with this (30) blood aforesaid, and if you go in to pronounce a
spell over the lamp you see a figure of a god standing behind (?) the
lamp, and he speaks (31) with you concerning the question which you
wish; or you lie down and he comes to you. If he does not come to

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span> <span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

you, you rise and pronounce his compulsion. (32) You must lie down on
green reeds, being pure from a woman, your head being turned to the
south and your face being turned to the north and the face of the lamp
being turned northwards likewise.

\(33\) *insert above*--'I pray thee to reveal thyself to me here
to-night and speak with me and give me answer truly concerning the given
matter which I ask thee about.'
