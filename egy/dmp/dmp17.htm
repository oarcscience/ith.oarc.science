<p>(1) That which another man said to me; 'Open my eyes,' unto four times. (2) [A vessel-divination:] 'Open my eyes; open thy eyes,' (and) vice versa, unto three times. 'Open, Tat; Open, Nap,' three times; (3) 'open [unto me?]' three [times?], 'for I am Artamo, born of Hame-o (?), the great basilisk of the East, rising in glory together with thy father (4)at dawn; hail (<i>bis</i>), Heh, open to me Hah,' you say it with a drawling (?) voice, 'Artamo, open to me Hah; if thou dost (5) not open to me Hah, I will make thee open to me Hah.

O ye of the Atef-crown, ye of Pephnun, Masphoneke; (11) hail! let all that I have said come to pass here to-day; say, hail! thou art Tham, Thamthom, Thamathom, (12) Tharnathomtham, Thamathouthi, Amon (<i>bis</i>), thy correct name, whom they call Thom, (13) Anakthom; thou art Itth; Thouthi is thy name, Sithom, Anithom Op-sao (?), Shatensro (14) black; open to me the mouths of my vessel here to-day; come to me to the mouths of my vessel, my bandage (?), let (15) my cup make the reflection (?) of heaven; may the hounds of the <i>hulot</i> give me that which is just in the abyss; may they tell me (16) that about which I inquire here to-day truly (<i>bis</i>), there being no falsehood in them <A NAME="img_10100"></A>

(17) Formula: you take a bowl of bronze, you engrave a figure of Anubis in it; you fill it with water left to settle (?) and (18) guarded(?) lest(?) the sun should reach it; you finish its (sur-)face (of the water) with fine oil. You place it on [three?] new bricks, their lower sides being sprinkled (19) with sand; you put four other bricks under the child; you make the child lie down upon (?) his stomach; (20) you cause him (?) to place his chin on the brick of the vessel; you make him look into</p>

<p>the oil, he having a cloth spread over his head, (21) there being a lighted lamp on his right, and a censer with fire on his left; you put a leaf of (22) Anubis-plant on the lamp, you put this incense on (the fire); you recite these spells, which are above, to the vessel seven times. The incense which you put (23) on (the fire): frankincense (?), wax (?), styrax, turpentine (?), date-stone (?); grind them with wine; you make them into a (24) ball and put them on (the fire).

Anubis, this soldier(?), this Kam, (26) this Kem ... Pisreithi (<i>bis</i>), Sreithi (<i>bis</i>), Abrithi is thy name, by thy correct name.'

You do it also (31) by vessel-inquiry alone, excellent (<i>bis</i>), tried (?), tested nine times.</p>
