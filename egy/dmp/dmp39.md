### VERSO COL VII.

\(1\) Another to follow it: Juice of a cucumber which has been rubbed
down, one ladleful (?), water of the ears of a *kle*-animal, one
ladleful (?) like the ladle (2) of a (wine-)cup; you add a
*uteh*-measure of good wine to them; and she drinks it at midday, before
she has (3) eaten anything whatever, after bathing in the bath, which
she has done before; when evening comes, you put the rag (?) (4) with
honey on her as above for seven days.

Another to follow: You take a new dish; you put (5) ten *uteh*-measures
of old sweet wine on it; you put a half *kite* of fresh rue on it from
(6) dawn till midday; let her bathe in the bath, and come out and drink
it. When it is evening (7) you put honey on her as above again for seven
days.
