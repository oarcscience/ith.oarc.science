### VERSO COL. VI.

\(1\) A remedy to cure water in a woman. The first remedy; salt and oil;
pound; apply to the vulva (?) daily (?) two days.

\(2\) After the two days, the second remedy: White lead, you pound it
with a little pigment from an oil-dealer (3) very carefully; you put
true oil of fine quality to it, together with an egg and pound them; you
take a strip (4) of linen cloth which is fine-spun (?); you dip it in
this medicament. She must bathe in the bath, she must (5) wash in good
wine; you put the medicated strip on her; you draw (?) it in (and) (6)
out of her vulva for a short time, like the phallus of a man, until the
medicament (7) spreads (?), you remove it, you leave her till evening;
when evening comes, you dip a bandage (?) in genuine honey, (8) you put
it on her until morning, for three, otherwise said four, days.
