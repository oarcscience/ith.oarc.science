### VERSO COL. XVII.

\(1\) A spell to bring \[a woman\] to a man (and?) to send dreams,
otherwise said, to dream dreams, also.

\(2\) (A line of symbols or secret signs.)

\(3\) You write this on a rush-leaf and you place (it) under your head;
you go to sleep; then (4) it makes dreams and it sends dreams. If you
will do it to send dreams, you put it (the leaf) on the mouth of a
mummy. (5) It brings a woman also; you write this name on the rush-leaf
with the blood of a .... or a hoopoe (?); (6) and you put the hair of
the woman in the leaf, and put it on the mouth of the mummy; and you
write on the earth with this name, saying: 'Bring (7) N. daughter of N.
to the house in the sleeping-place in which is N. son of N.' (8) Now it
is also an αγωγιμον.
