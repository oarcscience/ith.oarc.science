blinded.

\(32\) Another: You put a bat's blood; this is the manner of it again.

\(33\) Another: You drown a hawk in a jar of wine; you make the man
drink it; (34) then it does its work. A shrew-mouse (?) in the same way;
it does (35) its work also. Its gall also, you add it to the wine, (36)
then it does its work very much. You put the gall (37) of an Alexandrian
weasel into any food; then it does its work. You put a (38) two-tailed
lizard into the oil and you cook it with it; you anoint (39) the man
with it; then it does its work.
