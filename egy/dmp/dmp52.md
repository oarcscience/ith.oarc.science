### VERSO COL. XX.

\(1\) To heal ophthalmia (?) in a man. '\[Ho?\] Amon, this lofty male,
this male of Ethiopia, who came down (2) from Meroe to Egypt, he finds
my son Horus betaking himself as fast as his feet move (?), and he
injured (?) him (3) in his head with three spells in Ethiopian language,
and he finds N. son of N. and carries him as fast as his feet move(?),
(4) and injures his head with three spells in Ethiopian language:
Gentini, Tentina, (5) Kwkwby, \[Ak\]khe, Akha.' (6) (Say it) to a little
oil; add salt and nasturtium seed to it, you anoint the man who has
ophthalmia (?) with it. (7) You also write this on a new papyrus; you
make it into a written amulet on his body:--'Thou art this eye of
heaven' in the writings (followed by an eye with rays, as drawn in the
papyrus).
