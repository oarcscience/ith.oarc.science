St, St, St, Ihe, Iaho, seek (?); let there come to me the god in whose

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span> <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

each time, and you cry, 'I cast fury at thee of him who cutteth thee, of
him who devoureth thee. (5) Let the darkness separate from the light
before me. Ho! god, Hu-hos, Rikhetem, Si (*bis*), Aho (?), Ah, Mai (?)
("I do not"?), (6) Kha, Ait, Ri-shfe, Bibiu, Iaho, Ariaha (*bis*),
Arainas ("do for her"), Euesetho ("they will turn the face"), Bekes, Gs,
Gs, Gs, Gs, (7) Ianian, Eren, Eibs, Ks, Ks, Ks, Ks, let the god come to
me in whose hand is the command and give me answer as to everything
about which I (8) inquire here to-day. Come in Piatoou, Khitore; ho!
Shop, Shope, Shop, Abraham, the apple (?) of the Eye of the Uzat, (9)
Kmr, Kmr, Kmr, Kmr, Kmro, so as to create, Kom, Kom-wer-wot, Sheknush
(?) is thy real name, let answer be told to me (10) as to everything
about which I ask here to-day. Come to me Bakaxikhekh, tell me answer to
everything which I ask about here to-day truly (11) without telling me
falsehood.' Formula. Seven times.

\(12\) A direct (?) inquiry by (?) the voice of Pasash (?) the priest of
Kes; he (the informant) tells it, saying it is tested, nine times: (13)
'I am Ramshau, Shau, Ramshau son of Tapshau, of his mother Tapshau, if
it be that (14) any given thing shall happen, do not come to me with thy
face of Pekhe; thou shalt come to me in thy form of a priest, (15) in
thy figure of a servant of the temple. (But) if it shall not come to
pass, thou (shalt) come to me in thy form of a Kalashire, (16) for I am
Ramshau, Shau, Ramshau, the son of Tapshau, of his

mother Tapshau.' \[Say it\] opposite (17) the Shoulder constellation on
the third day of the month, there being a clove of three-lobed white
garlic and there being three needles (18) of iron piercing it, and
recite this to it seven times; and put it at thy head. Then he attends
to you and speaks with you.
