### VERSO COL. XII.

(1, 2) 'I am the great Shaay (otherwise said, the great Sheray?), who
makes magic for the great Triphis, the lady of Koou (?) (3) Lol Milol,
the water of thy brother (?) is that which is in my mouth, the fat of
Hathor, worthy of love, is (4) that which is in my heart; my heart
yearns, my heart loves. The (?) longing such as a she-cat (5) feels for
a male cat, a longing such as a she-wolf feels for a he-wolf, a longing
such as a bitch feels for (6) a dog, the longing which the god, the son
of Sopd (?), felt for Moses going to the hill of Ninaretos (7) to offer
water unto his god, his lord, his Yaho, Sabaho, his Glemura-muse,
Plerube ..., S Mi (8) Abrasax, Senklai--let N. daughter of N. feel it
for N. son of N.; (9) let her feel a yearning, a love, a madness great
......, she seeking for him (going) to every place. The fury (10) of
Yaho, Sabaho, Horyo ... Pantokrator, Antorgator, (11) Arbanthala, Thalo,
Thalax: for I cast fury upon you.
