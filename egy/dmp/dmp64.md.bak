### VERSO COL XXXII.

\(1\) To make ........ rave for a man. (2) You take a live shrew-mouse
(?), (3) and take out its gall and put it in one place, (4) and take its
heart and put it in another place. You (5) take its whole body, you
pound it very much; (6) when it is dry, you take a little of the pounded
stuff with a (7) little blood of your second finger, (that) of the
heart, (8) of your left hand, and put it in a cup of wine (9) and you
make the woman drink it, then she has a passion for you.

\(10\) You put its gall into a cup of wine, then she dies (11)
instantly; or put it in meat or some food.

\(12\) You put its heart in a ring of gold and put it (13) on your hand;
then it gives you great praise, love, and respect.
