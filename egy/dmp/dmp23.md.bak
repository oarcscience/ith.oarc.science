### COL. XX.

\(1\) \[Spell\] spoken to the sting: (2) 'I am the Kings son, eldest and
first, Anubis. My mother Sekhmet-Isis (?), she came (?) after me (3)
forth to the land of Syria, to the hill of the land of Heh, to the nome
of those cannibals, saying, (4) "Haste (*bis*), quick (*bis*) my child,
King's son, eldest and first, Anubis," saying, "Arise and come (5) to
Egypt, for thy father Osiris is King of Egypt, he is ruler over (6) the
whole land; all the gods of Egypt are assembled to receive the crown
from his hand." (7) The moment of saying those things she brought me a
blow (?),

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span> <span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

fell my tail (?) upon me. (8) It (?) gathered together (?), it (?)
coming to me with a sting (?): I sat down and (9) wept. Isis, my mother,
sat before me, saying to me, "Do not (10) weep (*bis*), my child, King's
son, eldest and first, Anubis; lick with thy tongue on thy heart,
repeatedly (?) (11) far as the edges of the wound (?); lick the edges of
the wound (?) as far as the edges of thy (12) tail (?). What thou wilt
lick up, thou swallowest it; do not spit it out on the ground; for thy
(13) tongue is the tongue of the Agathodaemon, thy tongue (?) is that of
Atum."'

\(14\) And you lick it with your tongue, while it is bleeding,
immediately; thereafter, you recite to a little (15) oil and you recite
to it seven times, you put it on the sting daily; you (16) soak a strip
of linen, you put it on it.

\(17\) \[The spell\] which you say to the oil to put it on the sting
daily: (18) 'Isis sat reciting to the oil Abartat and lamenting (?) to
the true oil, (19) saying, "Thou being praised, I will praise thee, O
oil, I will praise (20) thee, thou being praised by the Agathodaemon;
thou being applauded (?) by me myself, I will praise thee (21) for ever,
O herb oil--otherwise true oil--O sweat of the Agathodaemon, amulet (?)
of Geb. It is Isis who (22) makes invocation to the oil. O true oil, O
drop of

rain, O water-drawing of the planet Jupiter (23) which cometh down from
the sun-boat at dawn, thou wilt make the healing effect (?) of the dew
of dawn which heaven hath cast (24) on to the earth upon every tree,
thou wilt heal the limb which is paralysed (?), thou wilt make a remedy
(25) for him that liveth; for I will employ thee for the sting of the
King's son, eldest and first, Anubis, my child, (26) that thou mayest
fill it; wilt thou not make it well? For I will employ thee for (the?)
sting of N. the son of N., (27) that thou mayest fill it; wilt thou not
make it well?"' Seven times.

Spell spoken to fetch a bone out of a throat.

\(28\) 'I am he whose head reaches the sky and his feet reach the abyss,
who hath raised up (?) this crocodile in Pizeme (?) (29) of Thebes; for
I am Sa, Sime, Tamaho, is my correct name, Anouk (*bis*), saying,
hawk's-egg (30) is that which is in my mouth, ibis-egg is that which is
in my belly; saying, hope of god, bone of man, bone of bird, bone of
fish, (31) bone of animal, bone of everything, there being nothing
besides; paying, that which is in thy belly let it come to thy heart;
that which is in thy heart, (32) let it come to thy mouth; that which is
in thy mouth, let it come to my hand here to-day; for I am he who is in
the seven heavens, who standeth (33) in the seven sanctuaries, for I am
the son of the god who liveth.' (Say it) to a cup of water seven times:
thou causest the woman (*sic*) to drink it.
