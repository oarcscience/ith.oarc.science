# CHRISTIANITY UNDER THE BYZANTINE EMPERORS.

When quiet was re-established in Egypt by the Roman armies, after more
than sixty years of civil troubles, it was found to be no longer the
same country that it had been under the Antonines. The framework of
society had been broken, the Greeks had lessened in numbers and still
more in weight. Greek toleration of all religions and of all modes of
thought then gave way to Egyptian more bigoted earnestness. The bright
days of Egypt as a Greek kingdom ended with the rebellions against
Gallienus, Aurelian, and Dioclesian. The native Egyptians and the old
superstitions then rise again into notice, as Greek civilization sinks
around them. The building of Constantinople, and the removal of the scat
of government from Rome to that new Greek city, yet further lessened the
numbers, and thus the rank of the Greeks in Alexandria. Among the
Christians, the more superstitious Egyptians, whose religion was still
polytheism under a Christian form, as being now the more numerous, are
able in their turn to call the Greek Christians heretics. Then began the
celebrated Arian controversy, as to whether Jesus Christ were a God or a
created being; and the same intolerance, which ten centuries earlier
would not allow the Libyans to eat beef, is now uneasy at there being
two opinions about the miraculous

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

birth of the Saviour. The opinions of Arius were tile same as those of
the late Bishop Dionysius, that Jesus was the First of Created Beings.
But what was orthodoxy before the rebellions, while the Greeks were able
to treat the Egyptians as slaves, was heresy since the Egyptians had
found out their weight and power; and the young and able Athanasius, a
Greek deacon in the Alexandrian church, rose into importance by taking
the Egyptian side in the controversy.

It was not in the first instance seen that the dispute was in reality a
political struggle between the Egyptians and the Greeks, but it took the
form of a religious argument as to whether Jesus was an uncreated being
of out, substance with God, or was inferior to the Father. The quarrel
in Alexandria unsettled the faith of the world, so much was that city a
guide both to the east and west in matters of religion; and the Emperor
Constantine was persuaded to call a council of bishops to meet at Nicæa,
in Asia Minor, to settle the question. Unfortunately the decline of
civilization, and the increase of ignorance during the last two
centuries had been as great in Greece and Italy as in Alexandria. The
civil wars between rival emperors, the licence of the soldiers, the
inroads of the barbarians, and the progress of despotism, had crushed
free thought and genius everywhere. The Roman or western half of the
known world was wholly without a writer of any kind, except in the ranks
of the prejudiced theologians; and in the Greek or Eastern provinces
what little learning or cultivation remained was chiefly to be found in
Alexandria. Hence when the creed of Christendom was to be settled by the
votes of the bishops, after Egyptian superstition had already gained a
strong footing in Alexandria, any purer or more simple views of
Christianity,

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

stood little chance of holding their ground in an assembly of divines
summoned from yet wider and more ignorant provinces.

At Nicæa, as is usually the case in an assembly of divines, the more
superstitious talked down and frowned down the more reasonable. The
Emperor sided with the Egyptians, which may be explained by what we have
before seen, because Greece and Rome had been used to look up to Egypt
as their teacher in religion; and he had lately, on building
Constantinople, received from Alexandria fifty copies of Church Lessons,
for the use of his new churches. The Egyptian opinions, supported by the
eloquence and earnestness of the young Athanasias, the spokesman of the
Egyptian bishops, prevailed. He drew up the celebrated form of words,
now known by the name of the Nicene Creed, as a statement of the
opinions which the Egyptians contended for; and the Council ended their
labours by ordering everybody to receive it as thc true Christian faith.

The controversy was by no means at once settled by this decree. When
Constantine saw that the quarrel was more political than religious, he
took the other side of the question, and joined the Greeks; and Egypt
continued almost in rebellion on a point of controversial theology
during the reigns of Constantine, Constantius, Julian, Jovian, and
Valens. For forty years Athanasius, the darling hero of the Egyptians,
was able to defy the power of the Emperors, and after his death peace
was restored only on the accession of Theodosius, who took the side of
the Egyptians, and allowed them in their turn to persecute the more
enlightened Arian Greeks. From that time forward the Christianity of the
superstitious Egyptians became the Christianity of the majority in
Alexandria,

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

and after a time, with very few variations, the Christianity of the
greater part of the world.

The aim of the Nicene Creed was to require everybody to acknowledge,
that Jesus Christ was a God, in such clear and forcible terms as to turn
out of the Church all who would not follow the Egyptians in the mystical
opinions which they had introduced, so that there should be no escape
for those who believed in one only God, and who gave any whatever lower
rank to the Saviour. It declares that there is one God, the Maker of all
things, and yet that the one Lord Jesus Christ was not made; that he
also was very God of very God, and was yet crucified by Pontius Pilate;
that he had been previously incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin
Mary and made man, although of one substance with the Father. All this
carried with it no contradiction to the mind of the Egyptians. They were
used to being told and believing that two Gods could be one God. They
were used to hear of a God being put to death, as they had always held
that Osiris, though a god, had been put to death. They were used to hear
of children being born of an earthly mother, and having no earthly
father, as they held that many of their kings were so born, being
incarnate by the god Amun-Ra. But Athanasius did not introduce into his
creed any Egyptian mysticism to support it, nor did he try to explain
away its inconstency by any play upon words. The Nicene Creed does not
mention the Trinity nor the two natures of Christ, but leaves the
contradictions stated in the boldest terms. The well-known Athanasian
Creed, in which an explanation of the difficulties has been attempted,
is supposed to have been written two or three hundred years later, and
the name of the great Alexandrian bishop has been given to it, either
dishonestly, or because it was thought to represent

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

his opinions. This later creed states that though "the Father is God,
the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God, yet they are not three Gods,
but one God." This is the Egyptian doctrine of plurality in unity, which
is represented in numerous sculptures, and explained in pages
[12](emec03.htm#page_12) and [98](emec08.htm#page_98.md). It then asserts
the two natures of Christ, that he is both "perfect God and perfect
man." This was meant to get over the difficulty of a dying God which had
been ridiculed by Xenophanes, in the case of Osiris, five centuries
before the Christian era; when he told the Egyptians that if Osiris was
a man they should not worship him, and if he was a god they need not
lament his sufferings. But this Athanasian Creed, though setting forth
the Egyptian opinions, was an offspring of the Latin church, and it is
very doubtful whether it would have been wholly approved of by
Athanasius. The Egyptians had raised Mary, the wife of Joseph, almost
into a goddess, at least into "the mother of God," who had imparted no
portion of human nature to her son; they denied the two natures of
Christ, and clung faithfully to t he words of their own Nicene Creed,
which declared that he was "of one substance with the Father."

It was during these years of civil trouble and political agitation that
Christianity, or at least a form of religion which called itself
Christian, spread over the whole of Egypt. That large class of the
population which a few years before formed the priesthood of the old
temples, were now Christian monks. They were all zealous supporters of
Athanasius, and all earnest against the Arian opinions of the Greeks.
For their use, three Egyptian translations of the Bible were made, one
into the language used in the western half of the Delta, called Coptic,
a second into that of the Eastern half, called Bashmuric,

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

and a third into the Thebaic, for the use of Upper Egypt and Nubia. They
readily fitted the old temples to the new religion. Their opinions had
undergone but small change. On the rock temple of Kneph, opposite Abou
Simbel, they painted the figure of the Saviour, with a glory round his
head upon the and thus it became a Christian church (see Fig.
[101](#img_101).md) The great court-yard of the temple of Medinet Abou, at
Thebes, was is used as a

cathedral church dedicated to St. Athanasius. In some cases, they
removed from before their eyes the memorials of the old superstition, by
covering up the sculptures on the walls with mud from the Nile, and
white plaster. In other cases, they contented themselves with making a
slight change in the sculpture, as at the temple of Asseboua, in Nubia,
where they painted the figure of the Apostle Peter over that of the old
god of the temple, and the

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

sculpture now represents King Rameses II. presenting his offerings to
the Christian Saint (see Fig. [102](#img_102).md).

By the burst of enthusiasm in favour of Athanasius, the Nicene Creed
became the received religion of all native Egyptians, and beyond them of
those Alexandrians who aimed at rising into importance by taking the
popular side in the quarrel. Arianism, on the other hand, even when
supported by, the weak government of the Emperor, lost ground rapidly,
and it soon took refuge in the fortified camps of the Greek soldiers. A
church was dedicated to the Arian bishop George, within the walls of the
strong castle of Babylon, opposite Memphis, and another at Ptolemais,
where the Greek garrison collected the toll of the Thebaid, and where
the modern village vet bears his name, and is called by the Arabs
Geergeh, St. George became a favourite saint with the Greeks in Egypt,
and in those few spots where the Greek soldiers were masters of the
churches, this Arian and unpopular bishop was often painted on the
walls, riding triumphantly on horseback, and slaying the great serpent
or dragon of Athanasian error.

At this time a marked separation was taking place between the opinions
of Constantinople, the chief seat of

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

the Greek Church, and those of Egypt and Rome. The more civilized
Constantinople held aloof for the present from the more, superstitious
Egypt as its religious guide. But the case was far otherwise with Rome.
Since the building of Constantinople, and the removal of the seat of
government to that city, no political quarrel separated Rome from Egypt.
Pagan Rome, ever since the union of the two countries under Augustus,
except when interrupted by the rebellions, had been eagerly copying the
superstitions of Egypt, and Christian Rome still followed the same
course.

When in the reign of Constantine the country was quiet, thc intercourse
between the Egyptian and the Roman churches was renewed under still more
favourable circumstances, because the city of Alexandria had become more
Egyptian and less Greek than ever it had been before. Constans, the next
Emperor of Rome, openly gave his support to Athanasius when in
rebellious disobedience to Constantius, his own sovereign; and the
opinions of Athanasius, received the support of the whole Roman church.

At the end of the third century Hesychius, of Alexandria, had published
a new edition of the Greek Bible with a corrected text, and such was the
credit of Alexandria, as the chief seat of Christian learning,, that all
distant churches sent there for copies of the Scriptures. When Constans
wanted copies of the Greek scriptures for Rome, he sent for them to
Alexandria, and received the approved text from Athanasius. In this, a
matter of learning belonging to the last century, the Roman Emperor
acted wisely, but in the matter of religious opinions the case was far
otherwise.

Alexandria in the fourth century was very different from

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

that Alexandria which had earned its high character for criticism and
scholarship, though the change, in the eyes of the Roman church, was a
change for the better; and they were equally pleased to import from the
same city Alexandrian manuscripts and Egyptian superstitions. All
Christendom was copying the monastic institutions of the Thebaid. Italy
and the West acknowledged Egypt as their best instructress in all
ecclesiastical matters; and the approval which they, gave to the
ecclesiastical institutions could hardly have been yielded so cordially,
unless they at the same time gave a full approval to the religious
opinions.

As the Egyptians excelled all other Christians in the practice of
self-denial and fleshly mortification, so their religion was naturally
thought the most pleasing to God, and their theological views the
soundest. Natives of Italy, not content with living in their own
monasteries under the strict Theban rules, flocked into Egypt to place
themselves under the severe discipline, and to learn the opinions of the
ignorant Egyptian monks. As these Latin monks did not understand either
Coptic or Greek, they found some difficulty in regulating their lives
with the wished for exactness; and the rules of Pacomius, of Theodorus,
and of Oresiesis, the most celebrated of the founders, were sent to St.
Jerome at Rome, to be by him translated into Latin, for the use of these
settlers in the Thebaid. The two countries shaped their opinions so
nearly in the same mould, that when St. Jerome visited Egypt he found
the church there holding what he called the true Roman faith. Two at
least of these teachers of monastic discipline were clearly Egyptians,
not Greeks. Their names, Pachomius, or Pa-chem, *a priest of the god
Chem*, and Oresiesis, or Hor-se-isis, *Horus the son of Isis*,

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

even without the evidence of the foregoing pages, might have led us to
suppose that the source of their theology, both for themselves and for
the, Theban monasteries under their rule, was as much Pagan as
Christian.

The closeness with which Western Europe followed, Egypt may be seen even
in smaller matters. St. Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan, calls Jesus "the
good Scarabæus, who rolled up before him the hitherto unshapen mud of
our bodies," thus giving to him one of the names and characters of the
god Horus, who is pictured as a scarabæus, with a ball of mud between
his feet (see Fig. [103](#img_103).md). The ball, which usually means the
sun, would seem to have sometimes meant the sins of mankind; and the
goddesses Isis and Nephthys are often represented as rolling the same
ball before them. St. Augustin also, during the greater part of his
life, was a Manichæan, and held the Gnostic opinion of a god of goodness
and a god of evil; and he was so far an admirer of the Egyptians, or at
least of their practice of making mummies, as to say that they were the
only Christians who really and fully, believed in a future resurrection
from the dead.

Fig. 103.

If St. Jerome, when noting the religious agreement between Rome and
Egypt, really fancied that in anything whatever Rome had been the
teacher, he had read history to very little purpose. But Rome and Egypt
then held the same views of Christianity, which have since been known as
the opinions of the Roman church, and which were at the time rejected as
too superstitious by many of the more learned bishops of Constantinople,
Asia Minor, and Syria, who for the time held back from the Athanasian
opinions.

Hence arose the separate establishment of the Greek

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

church, which for a short time was Arian, and which from political
causes has ever since been disjoined from the Roman church. Political
causes also, arising from the disturbed state of the world in the fifth
century, presently separated Egypt from Italy; and then the Coptic and
the Roman church ceased to hold so exactly the same opinions. As Greek
intelligence offered every year less check to Egyptian ignorance, the
Coptic church became yet more superstitious; though, fortunately for
Rome, that city was no longer in danger of being led to follow.

The churches of Constantinople and Greece, with the Greek churches of
Asia Minor and Syria, did not, as we have said, at first move towards
the Egyptian opinions quite so fast as Italy and the west. But the
change from the earlier faith was presently quickened in the East by
political circumstances. On the death of the Emperor Valens in A.D. 379,
Theodosius, a general who hail been born in Spain, and brought up in
Western Christianity, was made Emperor of Constantinople and the East.
The disturbed state of his dominions called for the strong arm of
military despotism; and Theodosius required the church to give the same
obedience to his simple will that he received from the army. He at once
dismissed the Arian patriarch of Constantinople, and ordered all the
clergy to be turned out of their churches if they would not receive the
Nicene Creed. He summoned a council of bishops to meet at
Constantinople, for the purpose of having the Nicene Creed declared to
be the creed of the church of the whole world. He did not summon to it
either the Egyptian bishops or the Western bishops; they already held
the Nicene faith. He summoned only the Eastern church, and in that
council, under his orders, the Nicene Creed was reenacted forty-five
years after the Arians had been allowed

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

to re-enter the church. The Council of Constantinople also added to the
creed the clauses which declare the Holy Spirit to be a person who ought
to be worshipped equally with God and Jesus, leaving the Nicene Creed
very nearly as it is now read, and thus for the first time establishing
the Trinity as now understood by the so-called orthodox Christians.

The book trade of Alexandria gave the Egyptian opinions a great
importance in the Christian world. All the oldest and best manuscripts
of the Greek Bible now remaining were written by Alexandrian penmen,
that of Paris, that of the Vatican, that of Cambridge, that of the
British Museum, and that from 'Mount Sinai, now in Russia. In Alexandria
were made the Ethiopic version, and probably the early Latin version.
The Armenian version and the old Syriac version were corrected in
Alexandria, from the most approved and earliest Greek text.

These are strong proofs of the rank which that city held, and of its
power to guide the opinions of foreign Christians. Nor were corn and
books the only products which other countries received from Egypt,
either as tribute or by purchase.

About the middle of the fourth century there was a general digging up of
the bodies of the most celebrated Christians of former ages to heal the
diseases and strengthen the faith of the living. The tombs of Egypt,
crowded with mummies which had lain there for centuries, could of course
furnish relics more easily than most countries; and Constantinople then
received from Egypt a quantity of bones, which were supposed to be those
of the martyrs slain in the Pagan persecutions. The Archbishop, John
Chrysostome, received them gratefully, and

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

though himself smarting under the reproach that he was not orthodox,
according to the measure of the superstitious Egyptians, he thanks God
that Egypt, which sent forth its corn to feed its hungry neighbours,
could also send the bodies of so many martyrs to sanctify their
churches. And Gregory, of Nazianzus, a little before had remarked that
Egypt was the most Christ-loving of countries, and adds, with true
simplicity, that, wonderful to say, after having so lately worshipped
bulls, goats, and crocodiles, it was now teaching the world the worship
of the Trinity in the truest form.
