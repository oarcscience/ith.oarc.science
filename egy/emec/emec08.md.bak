# CHRISTIANITY UNDER THE ROMAN EMPERORS.

CHRISTIANITY was first preached in Egypt by the Evangelist Mark about
thirty years after the Crucifixion. He had sailed with Barnabas to
Cyprus (Acts xv. 39), and thence probably went on to Alexandria. There
he appointed, as the first of a succession of bishops, Ananiah, a Jew.
The succeeding bishops seem to have been Greeks; so we may suppose that
in Alexandria the religion made less progress with the Jews. Indeed, how
fast Christianity spread during the first hundred years, among the
sceptical Greeks of that city, is unknown. But at the end of that time
we find full proof of how largely the Egyptians had embraced it by our
finding the extent to which Egyptian opinions were received among the
Christians. Egyptian mysticism, which had found such a ready entrance
into the Greek and Roman Paganism, was not harmless when it came in
contact with Christianity, whether it appeared in its own dress, or
concealed under the guise of Alexandrian philosophy. From the very first
we hear of it as an enemy to be shunned. The Apostle Paul wisely advises
Timothy to avoid the antitheses of Gnosticism, or "the oppositions of
Science falsely so called" (1 Tim. vi. 20). This Gnosticism was one of
the forms in which we shall presently see mysticism uniting itself to
Christianity in Alexandria. The Alexandrian opinions also appear in the
Canonical

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Epistle to the Hebrews. There Jesus is no longer
the Teacher of a new Religion, as in the gospels, but he acts as a
mediator or advocate before the judge on behalf of mankind, as in the
writings of the Son of Sirach, and as we have seen the Egyptian lesser
gods acting (in page [51](emec03.htm#page_51).md), not as a mediator to
persuade the sinner to repent, but to persuade the judge to forgive the
sin. And his death is no longer that of a martyr to the great cause of
regenerating his fellow-creatures, but it is somewhat of an atoning
sacrifice, made to propitiate the judge, a doctrine which is shown on
the sculpture in Fig. [70](emec03.htm#img_70.md), page
[51](emec03.htm#page_51.md). These Alexandrian opinions were probably held
by Apollos of Alexandria and Barnabas of Cyprus; and it was against some
such "philosophy and vain deceit after the traditions of men,"
accompanied by a "voluntary humility and worshipping of angels," that
Paul warns the Colossians (ii. 8; ii. 18; iv. 10). Soon afterwards were
added to the Gospel of Matthew the first two chapters, giving to Jesus a
miraculous birth, without an earthly father, chapters of which we have
historic information that they formed no part of the original Gospel,
and which receive no support from the Gospels of Mark or John, or from
any of the Epistles. The first two, chapters also in Luke, the poetical
chapters, though they allow Jesus to be the son of Joseph as well as of
Mary, equally show their Egyptian origin. They give the circumstances
attending his birth almost as if they were copied from the Egyptian
sculpture in page 18, where we have seen the annunciation, the
conception, the birth, and the adoration of the child, who afterwards
became King Amunotph III.

In the year A.D. 160, a hundred years after Mark had landed in
Alexandria, we find four bishops governing as many Egyptian churches,
which had adopted Christianity

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

in some form or other. But whenever we hear of these Egyptian
Christians, they are by the Greeks called Heretics. Numbers of them had
readily consented to be baptised, and to fling away the belief in their
old gods. But their new religious opinions had very little in common
with the religion preached by Jesus and his apostles. Their Persian
conquerors, though too tyrannical to win many minds from Polytheism, may
yet have helped to undermine the belief in gods whose statues the). had
broken. The Greek conquerors, whose ridicule gained weight from their
greater refinement, had further weakened the faith of some minds. Thus
the Egyptians may have been somewhat prepared by their own doubts,
though in a less degree than the Greeks and Romans, for the introduction
of a new religion. But on the other hand, if the Egyptians had fewer
theological doubts, they had more religious earnestness; and
Christianity made its way, not only because the nations were opening
their eyes to their intellectual errors, but because they were rising to
an aim after more moral purity. Of the Pagan nations best known to us,
the Egyptians were the most real believers in a resurrection from the
dead, in a day of judgment, and in a future state of rewards and
punishments. Through these doctrines a wide door was open for the
entrance of Christianity. Having been polytheists, they readily received
Jesus Christ as a god in the place of some of their own; and that he
should have been put to death by his enemies, could present no
difficulty to their minds, as the), had always been taught that their
own god, Osiris, had died by, an equally cruel death. Horus, the son,
during the latter century, had risen to the rank of judge, and to be
thought more of than Osiris, and hence Jesus was soon thought more
worthy of worship than our Heavenly Father. A

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

dying god was one of the great facts in their religious philosophy; and
though they rejected their own gods, they could by no means so easily
reject their old opinions. However, the despised Egyptians, on owning
themselves Christians, and submitting to baptism, were at once received
as equals in the society of the Greek Christians. They were raised, not
legally, but socially, from slaves to be freemen. That any of the
Greeks, their masters, should take the trouble to preach to them, to
persuade them, to try to win them over to their own views of religion,
was an honour which they had never before received; and as they owed it
to Christianity, they cannot but have been led to look upon Christianity
with favourable eyes.

The new religious opinions, however, of the Egyptians had very little in
common with the religion of the Apostles. They took such parts of the
Gospel as suited their views, and could be fitted on to their old
religion; but these rays of light they mixed up and buried under such a
mass of superstition, that the Apostles themselves would not easily have
recognised their own doctrines. The Christianity of the Egyptians, thus
corrupted by the old Paganism of the country, shows itself in Alexandria
first under the name of the Gnostic heresy. Gnosticism, that is, science
or knowledge was the proud name given by its professors to a confused
mixture of Greek philosophy and Egyptian superstition, to which they
made no difficulty of adding Christianity. We learn something of it from
the writers who oppose it, and something of it from their own sculptured
gems, and something, even, from the Alexandrian coins of the emperors.
As it was founded on a union between Greek, Egyptian, and Jewish
opinions, it probably took its rise in Heliopolis, which was the most
celebrated school before the building of Alexandria. But

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

afterwards it spread from Alexandria to all the countries where Greek
was spoken.

The peculiarities of the Gnostics very much show themselves in the
attempt to explain the origin of evil--that never-failing source of
difficulty to philosophical reasoners. They held the Eastern opinion of
two equal and co-eternal Beings, the one the author of good, and the
other of evil; that between these two there was an unceasing warfare, as
between light and darkness, life and death, spirit and matter. These are
the "oppositions of science, falsely so, called," against which the
Apostle Paul warned Timothy. The Gnostics held that matter was
essentially evil, and consequently that God could not be its author.
Even the Apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon says that God did not create
death. The Supreme God and the Creator of the World were with the
Gnostics two different Beings, and the latter was looked upon as the God
of the Jews and the author of the Mosaic law. In this scheme, the Being
with whom men have chiefly to do, either in this world or in the next,
is the Creator of the World, the author of evil; and we see its
connection with the old Egyptian opinions, by the engraved figures on
the coins and gems. On Fig. [92](#img_92.md), an Alexandrian coin of
Hadrian, we see the Serpent of Good and the Serpent of Evil, both so,
common on the Egyptian monuments. The former is well distinguished by
his swollen chest, but it is the latter, the Serpent of Evil, that wears
the crown of Osiris as judge of the dead. On a coin of Antoninus (Fig
[93](#img_93).md) the Serpent of Evil is represented as Serapis, having the
head of an old man with a basket on the top, as the great god and judge,
while on.

Fig. 92

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

the engraved gem (Fig. [94](#img_94).md) the same serpent has a glory round
its head, and is entitled the Spirit of Evil, and underneath it is
written the magical word, Abrasax, hurl me not, an Egyptian word, which
the Greeks made use of, as believing that the evil spirits were better
acquainted with the Egyptian language than with the Greek. From thus
representing the creator of the world under the form of a serpent, some
of the Gnostics were named Ophitæ, or Serpent-worshippers; and in giving
to this Being the name of Jao, a word written on his shield in Fig.
[95](#img_95.md), they declared him to be the Jah, or Jehovah of the Jews.

Another favourite doctrine of the Gnostics was that of Æons, or
spiritual beings, which proceeded from the Almighty, or, rather, into
which the Almighty had in part divided himself. These were seven in
number, of whom one was the Christ, who came down and dwelt in the body
of Jesus. This opinion of a, god dividing himself into several persons,
or characters, was part of the old Egyptian mythology, as we have seen
in page [12](emec03.htm#page_12.md); and these seven spirits, or Æons, we
met with in the Greek translation of Isaiah, in page
[62](emec04.htm#page_62.md). The Gnostics, classing them with the Almighty
as eight persons who together made only one God, worshipped them under
the name of the Ogdoad, which is, the earliest system of plurality in
unity that we meet with among Christians of any sect. As the everlasting
God

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

was himself Eternity, so these angelic beings which proceeded from him
were called Æons, ages, or limited periods of time, a name which seems
to deny that they are of equal rank with the Eternal Being. And in the
Epistle to the Hebrews, a book which shows much acquaintance with
Alexandrian opinions, the Almighty is described as God who made the Æons
or ages (chap. i. 2). A later sect of Gnostics raised the number of Æons
to thirty.

As the hostility of Matter to Spirit was the cause of all evil, the aim
of Gnosticism Was to purify its followers from the corruptions of
Matter; and this Was to be done by making them more perfect in Gnosis or
mystical knowledge. And hence some thought that the body was to be kept
under the practice of self-denial, and by a rigid system of discipline;
While others who had persuaded themselves that their knowledge was
everything, despised the distinctions of the moral law, and, justly or
unjustly, were accused of gross vice.

These speculative and mystical opinions, which show themselves among the
Christians in the form of Gnosticism, and among the Jews and Greek
Pagans in the more modified form of New Platonism, took their rise in
the School of Heliopolis, where the opinions of Jews, Greeks, and
Egyptians had freely mingled, and had each made some change in the
others. We have spoken of the changes introduced into Christianity by
this mixing together of races; but the change in the old Egyptian
religion shows in itself in an approach towards the worship of one God.
It was to be brought about by the help of various subtleties, without
rejecting the old Polytheism, and chiefly by means of the doctrine of
Plurality in Unity, by which, as We have before seen, they, readily
divided one God into several persons, and equally readily united several
Gods into one

person. Plutarch tells us that they worshipped Osiris, Isis, and Horus,
under the form of a triangle, of which Horus was the shorter side. Of
these representations of the Egyptian Trinity, we have many small
specimens in our museums (see Fig. [96](#img_96).md). He further tells us
that they held that everything perfect had three parts, and, therefore,
that their god of goodness made himself threefold, while their god of
evil remained single. On an Alexandrian coin of Trajan we see a winged
sphinx, With three heads, leaning on a wheel, representing this
threefold divinity (see Fig. [97](#img_97).md). It reminds us of the Greek
Cerberus, and which we might almost suppose to be the wicked Typhon, the
accusing hippopotamus. Who was one of the Cabeiri, if such an opinion
did not contradict the rule quoted by Plutarch, that the god of evil
remained single. It reminds us also of the living creatures of Ezekiel,
chap. i., each of which had four heads and four wings, except that the
creature described by the prophet had a wheel for each of the four
faces. And indeed the same sphinx, leaning on a Wheel, was made use of
by the Gnostic Christians to represent Jesus Christ, as in the engraved
gem, Fig. [98](#img_98.md), where we see the White horse of the Book of
Revelation vi. 2, "And he that sat on it had a bow, and a crown was
given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer," trampling

down, as we see, the Dragon, or serpent of Evil, while the figure of
Victory presents to him the crown or diadem of royalty. An Alexandrian
coin of the 11th year of Domitian represents another vision of the Book
of Revelation--namely, the Spirit of Death, in the form of a serpent,
riding on the Pale Horse (see Fig. [99](#img_99).md). As this was made
after the Book of Revelation was written, so also may have been the gem,
Fig. [98](#img_98.md).

Fig. 99

In the Book of Revelation, however, written in the year A.D. 69, we find
many traces of the Gnostic or at least Egyptian opinions. One as in the
seven spirits which were before the throne of God, in chap. i. 4, and
which are again mentioned under the form of lamps, chap. iv. 5, and as
eyes, in chap. v. 6. In page [80](emec06.htm#page_80.md), we have shown
that the writers of the Septuagint introduced these seven spirits into
Isaiah xi. 2. Another Egyptian figure is in the war against the Dragon,
or serpent of evil, in chap xii., which is represented several times on
the sarcophagus of Oimenepthah I., made perhaps B.C. 1200, and mentioned
in page [43](emec03.htm#page_43.md). The description of heaven, in chap. v.
5, the Jude on his throne, the four-and-twenty elders around the throne,
the four living creatures with animals' heads, the Lamb standing before
the throne,, and the book-roll, would all seem in scenic effect to be
copied from the Trial Scene described in page [41](emec03.htm#page_41.md),
though in its purpose it is very unlike. The horses' tails ending in
snakes' heads we see on the gem, page [99](#page_99.md).

The learned Greeks of Alexandria, whether Pagans or Christians, by no
means held the superstitious Egyptian opinions, though certainly Greek
philosophy had been not a little changed by having been cultivated for
four centuries side by side with astrology, fortune-telling, priestly

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

oracles, the Eleusinian mysteries, and the ceremonies in the great
temple of Serapis. But the cold criticism and scepticism of the Museum,
may have driven many minds to feel more pleasure in credulity. Clemens
shows some love of mysticism in his fondness for the sacred power of
numbers, and Origen in his finding am allegory or second meaning hidden
under the simple history of the Bible. And the praiseworthy wish to
convert the Egyptians to Christianity led to describing the new religion
in terms as near as possible to the old Paganism.

Clemens, in his words, though not so much in the meaning of his words,
goes a long way to meet the opinions of the Egyptian Christians. He
writes in favour of Gnosticism, *Science or Knowledge*, and though he is
far from meaning the "Science falsely so called," spoken of by the
Apostle Paul, which now goes by the name of Gnosticism, yet he cannot
but have given some countenance to it, by adopting the language of his
mystical neighbours. He describes every good man as having it in his
power to rise from being a slave, to become a faithful servant of God,
then a son, and at last a God walking in the flesh. Such words were
understood figuratively, as they were meant, by the Platonic Christians
of Alexandria; and it is only in sound that they agreed with the
opinions of the Egyptians, who had accepted a belief in Jesus by
considering him sometimes a god who had been put to death like Osiris,
and sometimes a son of God in the same sense as their own Horus. But
these words,, though at first used figuratively, coloured the opinions
of those who understood them literally.

If the Platonic Christians fancied that they were in any degree bringing
over the Egyptians towards their own opinions by thus going forward to
meet them, they were

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

very much mistaken. The attempt to bridge over the gulf which separated
the two opinions, did less to win the polytheists to Christianity than
it did to make the Christianity of the country polytheistic. At the same
time this concealing the difference between the two classes of
believers, was very much driving away from Christianity the Jewish
converts, who, like the Egyptians, though in an opposite direction, were
equally straightforward in holding their opinions, and in the manner of
expressing them.

Soon after the time of Clemens and Origen, the Alexandrian opinions
again moved a step further towards the Egyptians. Dionysius, Bishop of
Alexandria, after first writing against the Gnostics, who said that
there were thirty persons in the Godhead, then writes to defend the new
doctrine of a Trinity against Paul, the Syrian bishop, who said that God
was One and undivided, and that Jesus was a man; and then again,
Dionysius writes against Sabellius, Bishop of Cyrene, who, like Paul the
Syrian, said that God was One and undivided, but, unlike Paul, added
that he had appeared on earth in the form of Jesus. Against these
opposite opinions Dionysius defended a Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit, but in so doing he by no means comes up to the Egyptian
standard. He distinctly denies to Jesus any higher rank than that of
the, first of created beings. His Trinity may be called the Arian
Trinity, and is important as it marks one of the steps by which the
Alexandrians were slowly fitting their mysticism to the Egyptian
polytheism. The only advance which the Egyptians in return made towards
the Greeks, was in the sect of the Docetæ, who were willing to get over
the difficulty of a dying God, by their doctrine of apparitions. The
said that Jesus died only in appearance, and hence their name of Docetæ,
or *Seemers*. In the

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

same way the Egyptians, five centuries earlier, had told Herodotus that
Helen had been carried to Troy only in appearance, and that her real
body had never been there. But the Greeks did not accept this view of
the matter.

For the persecution of the Christians, both Greek and Egyptian, which
began with the third century, we must seek all explanation in the state
of the country in the years before the Egyptian rebellions. The Greek
Christians had courted the Egyptians, had preached to them, had in part
educated them, had raised them in their own eyes, and had made common
cause with them, and thus, made them discontented under their foreign
rulers. This religious stir the government tried to stop, and the
persecution of the Christians was as much political as religious. The
Greeks, or the Roman government, which was very much in the hands of the
Greeks, would probably never have been roused into intolerance unless
the peace of the country had been threatened by an increased activity of
mind among the Egyptians. The rebellion which followed made a vet
further change in the religion. When the rebellion broke out, the union
between Greek Christians, and Egyptian Christians was broken; and when
the rebellions were over, the Egyptians no longer acknowledged by the
Greeks as their religious partners.

From the death of Alexander Severus, in the year A.D. 235, till the
accession of Constantine in A.D. 323, Egypt was torn to pieces by civil
wars between rival emperors, by the invasion of the Syrians, and yet
more by repeated rebellions of the native Egyptians against the power of
Rome. While the disturbances continued Greek opinions were going fast
out of favour with the Egyptians; the Greek mind was losing its,
supremacy, and Egyptian Christianity was henceforth to be for the most
part under

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

the guidance of Egyptians themselves. It was at the end of the third
century, during the years of trouble, that the worship of the Persian
Mithra, the god of the sun, was introduced into Egypt. In the Persian
system of two gods, one good and the other wicked, Mithra was the god of
goodness. The symbol in his worship best known is the figure of a hero,
in Phrygian cap and trowsers, mounted on a sinking bull, and stabbing it
in sacrifice to the unseen god, while a dog licks up the blood from the
wound (see Fig. [100](#img_100).md). This new worship received little
favour in Egypt or Alexandria, and its ignorant followers were as

Click to view](img/10400.jpg.md)

Fig. 100

wickedly accused of slaying their fellow citizens on the altars of the
Persian god. The only part of this religion that gained a cordial
welcome was the doctrine of Manicheism, a doctrine so closely akin to
Gnosticism that it was hardly new. It was the doctrine of two supreme
principles equally eternal and self-existent. One was mind and the other
matter, one causing the happiness and the other the misery of men, one
living in light and the other in darkness. This opinion, like the
Antitheses of Gnosticism, had its rise in the difficulty of explaining
the origin of sin, and of understanding how a merciful Creator could
allow the existence of evil. The ignorant, in all ages of Christianity,
have held the same opinion in

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

one form or other, thinking that sin arose from the contrivances of a
Devil, whom the All-powerful was not powerful enough to overcome, or
else from the wickedness of the flesh itself. The Jews alone proclaimed
that God created good, and God created evil. But the Jewish converts
were now declared heretics by the more superstitious converts from
Paganism, who were every year making the, standard of orthodoxy conform
more and more to Egyptian ignorance, and less to Greek intelligence.
Hence Manicheism and the belief in a Devil took deep hold of the
Egyptian Christians.
