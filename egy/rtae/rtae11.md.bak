### LECTURE VII

#### THE SOCIAL FORCES MAKE THEIR IMPRESSION ON RELIGION—THE RISE OF SOCIAL REFORMERS—THE EARLIEST SOCIAL REGENERATION

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> story of the Misanthrope, although
that of an *individual* experience, nevertheless involves contemplation
of society to whose failings this individual experience of the writer
was largely due. But the subject himself remained the chief or exclusive
concern. On the other hand, concern for social misfortune, the ability
to contemplate and discern the unworthiness of men, the calamities that
befall society, and the chronic misery which afflicts men as a body also
appear as the subject of dark and pessimistic reflections in this
remarkable age of growing self-consciousness and earliest
disillusionment. A priest of Heliopolis, named Khekheperre-sonbu, born
under Sesostris II (1906–1887 B.C.), gave expression to his sombre
musings on society in a composition which was still circulating some
four hundred years later when a scribe of the Eighteenth Dynasty copied
it upon a board now preserved in the British Museum. <span
id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_622.md) It is of especial interest, as
indicating at the outset that such men of the Feudal Age were perfectly
conscious that they were thinking upon new lines, and that they had
departed far

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

from the wisdom of the fathers. The little tractate reads as follows:

"The collection of words, the gathering of sayings, the pursuit of
utterances with searching of heart, made by the priest of Heliopolis, .
. . Khekheperre-sonbu, called Onkhu. He says: 'Would that I had unknown
utterances, sayings that are unfamiliar, even new speech that has not
occurred (before), free from repetitions, not the utterance of what has
⌈long⌉ passed, which the ancestors spake. I squeeze out my breast <span
id="fr_623"></span>[1](#fn_623.md) for what is in it, in dislodging all
that I say; for it is but to repeat what has been said when what has
(already) been said has been said. There is no ⌈support⌉ for the speech
of the ancestors when the descendants find it. . . . "'

"'I have spoken this in accordance with what I have seen, beginning with
the first men down to those who shall come after. Would that I might
know what others have not known, even what has not been repeated, that I
might speak them and that my heart might answer me; that I might make
clear to it (my heart) concerning my ill, that I might throw off the
burden that is on my back. . . ."'

"'I am meditating on the things that have happened, the events that have
occurred in the land. Transformations go on, it is not like last year,
one year is more burdensome than the next. . . . Righteousness is cast
out, iniquity is in the midst of the council-hall. The plans of the gods
are violated, their dispositions are disregarded. The land is in
distress, mourning is in every place, towns and districts are in
lamentation. All men alike are under wrongs; as for respect, an end is
made of it. The lords of quiet are disquieted. A morning comes every day
and

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

turns back again to what has been (formerly). When I would speak
⌈thereof⌉, my limbs are heavy laden. I am distressed because of my
heart, it is suffering to hold my peace concerning it. Another heart
would bow down, (but) a brave heart in distress is the companion of its
lord. Would that I had a heart able to suffer. Then would I rest in it.
I would load it with words of . . . that I might dislodge through it my
malady.'"

"He said to his heart: 'Come then, my heart, that I may speak to thee
and that thou mayest answer for me my sayings and mayest explain to me
that which is in the land. . . . I am meditating on what has happened.
Calamities come in to-day, to-morrow ⌈afflictions⌉ are not past. All men
are silent concerning it, (although) the whole land is in great
disturbance. Nobody is free from evil; all men alike do it. Hearts are
sorrowful. He who gives commands is as he to whom commands are given;
the heart of both of them is content. Men awake to it in the morning
daily, (but) hearts thrust it not away. The fashion of yesterday therein
is like to-day and resembles it ⌈because of⌉ many things. . . . There is
none so wise that he perceives, and none so angry that he speaks. Men
awake in the morning to suffer every day. Long and heavy is my malady.
The poor man has no strength to save himself from him that is stronger
than he. It is painful to keep silent concerning the things heard, (but)
it is suffering to reply to the ignorant man. To criticise an utterance
causes enmity, (for) the heart receives not the truth, and the reply to
a matter is not endured. All that a man desires is his own utterance. .
. .'"

"'I speak to thee, my heart; answer thou me, (for) a heart assailed is
not silent. Lo, the affairs of the servant

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

are like (those of) the master. Manifold is the burden upon thee.'

Here is a man deeply stirred by the corruption of his fellows. He
contemplates society as a whole, and while he constantly gives
expression to his own misery in view of such a prospect, it is not his
own suffering which is the chief burden of his utterance. His concern is
for society, shackled by its own inertia, incapable of discerning its
own misery, or, if at all conscious of it, without the initiative to
undertake its own regeneration. Many of his reflections might find
appropriate place in the mouth of a morally sensitive social observer of
our own times. It is evident, then, that we have reached an age when for
the first time in history men have awakened to a deep sense of the moral
unworthiness of society. Nor was this conviction confined to the
reflections of an humble Heliopolitan priest. It speaks also in the
disillusionment of Amenemhet I, the great founder of the dynasty under
which these momentous developments in thought were taking place. He
strikes the same sombre note to which, as we have seen, even the harper
at their feasts attuned his instrument. This king has left us a brief
word of counsel addressed to his son, Sesostris I, who was to succeed
him—counsel very evidently uttered after a base attempt upon the old
king's life by those whom he trusted. <span
id="fr_624"></span>[1](#fn_624.md)

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"He saith, while distinguishing righteousness,  
 For his son    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
   .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
 Hearken to that which I say to thee,  
 That thou mayest be king of the earth,  
 That thou mayest be ruler of the lands,  
 That thou mayest increase good.  
 ⌈Harden⌉ thyself against all subordinates.  
 The people give heed to him who terrorizes them.  
 Approach them not alone,  
 Fill not thy heart with a brother,  
 Know not a friend,  
 Nor make for thyself intimates,  
 Wherein there is no end.  
 When thou sleepest, guard for thyself thine own heart;  
 For a man has no people  
 In the day of evil.  
 I gave to the beggar, I nourished the orphan;  
 I admitted the insignificant as well as him who was of great account.  
 (But) he who ate my food made insurrection;  
 He to whom I gave my hand aroused fear therein."</span>

</div>

This is all followed by the story of the attempt on his life, an
incident which accounts to some extent for the disillusionment of the
embittered old king.

The unrelieved pessimism of the Misanthrope, of our Heliopolitan priest,
and of Amenemhet I was not, however, universal. There were men who,
while fully recognizing the corruption of society, nevertheless dared
dream of better days. Another moral prophet of this great age has put
into dramatic setting not only his passionate arraignment of the times,
but also constructive admonitions looking toward the regeneration of
society and the golden age that might ensue. This, perhaps the most
remarkable document of this group of social and moral tractates of the
Feudal Age, may be called the Admonitions

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

of Ipuwer. <span id="fr_625"></span>[1](#fn_625.md) The beginning of the
papyrus containing the narrative introduction setting forth the
circumstances under which the sage utters his reflections is
unfortunately lost. The situation in its chief externals is, however,
clear. The wise man Ipuwer, in the presence of the king himself and some
others, possibly the assembled court, delivers a long and impassioned
arraignment of the times concluding with counsel and admonition. A brief
rejoinder by the king follows, and a few words of reply by the sage
conclude the pamphlet. Of the long oration by the wise man, constituting
the bulk of the document, over two-thirds is occupied by this
arraignment; that is, nearly ten out of nearly fourteen pages. This
indictment displays no logical arrangement of content, though there has
been evident effort to dispose the utterances of the sage in strophic
form, each strophe beginning with the same phrase, just as in the poems
of the Misanthrope. In the following paragraphs we shall endeavor to
summarize by subjects the chief content of the arraignment, with
sufficient quotation to indicate the character of the wise man's
utterances. The fragmentary condition of the papyrus, and the intense
difficulty

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

of the language employed make a continuous translation, even with
copious commentary, quite out of the question. <span
id="fr_626"></span>[1](#fn_626.md)

With searching vision the sage sweeps his eye over the organized life of
the Nile-dwellers and finds all in confusion. Government is practically
suspended, "the laws of the judgment-hall are cast forth, men walk upon
\[them\] in the public places, the poor break them open in the midst of
the streets. Indeed, the poor man (thus) attains to the power of the
Divine Ennead; that (old and respected) procedure of the Houses of the
Thirty (Judges) is divulged. Indeed, the great judgment-hall is
⌈thronged⌉, poor men go and come in the Great Houses (law-courts)" (6,
9–12). "Indeed, as for the ⌈splendid⌉ judgment-hall, its writings are
carried away; the private office that was is exposed. . . . Indeed,
departmental offices are opened, their writings 'are carried away, <span
id="fr_627"></span>[2](#fn_627) (so that.md) serfs become lords of ⌈serfs⌉.
Indeed, officials are slain, their writings are carried away. Woe is me
for the misery of this time. Indeed, the scribes of the \[produce',
their writings are rejected; the grain of Egypt is any corner's" (6,
5–9). "Behold, the district councils of the land are expelled from the
land, the . . . are expelled from the royal houses" (7, 9–10).

This disorganization of government is due to a state of violence and
warfare within the land. "A man smites his brother of the same mother.
What is to be done?" (5, 10).

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Behold a man is
slain by the side of his brother, while he (the brother) ⌈forsakes⌉ him
to save his own limbs" (9, 3). "A man regards his son as his enemy" (1,
5). "A man goes to plough bearing his shield. . . . Indeed, . . . the
archer is ready, the violent is in every place. There is no man of
yesterday" (2, 2). "Behold the man (who gains) a noble lady as wife, her
father protects him; he who is without \[such protection\], they slay
him" (8, 8–9). "Blood is everywhere; there is no ⌈lack⌉ of death; the
swathing (of the dead) speaks, before one comes near it" (2, 6). "Behold
a few lawless men are endeavoring to deprive the land of the kingship.
Behold men are endeavoring to revolt against the Uræus (the royal
serpent) . . . which pacifies the Two Lands" (7, 2–4). "Indeed,
Elephantine and ⌈Thinis⌉ are the \[⌈domain⌉\] of Upper Egypt, (but)
civil war pays no revenues" (3, 10–11).

To this condition of disorganization and revolt within are added the
terrors of foreign invasion. "Indeed, the desert is in the land; the
districts (of Egypt) are devastated; foreign bowmen come to Egypt" (3,
1). "Indeed, the Marshes (of the Delta) throughout are not hidden.
Although Lower Egypt is proud of (its) trodden highways, what is to be
done? . . . Behold, it is ⌈in the hand⌉ of those who knew it not like
those who knew it. Asiatics are skilled in the workmanship of the
Marshes" (4, 5–8).

A prey to internal disorder and revolt, helpless before the raids of the
Asiatics on the eastern frontiers of the Delta, the property of Egypt is
destroyed and the economic processes of the land cease. "Behold, all the
craftsmen, they do no work; the enemies of the land impoverish its
crafts. \[Behold, he who reaped\] the harvest

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

knows naught of it; he who has not ploughed \[⌈fills his granaries. When
the harvest⌉\] occurs, it is not reported. The scribe \[⌈idles in his
bureau, there is no work for⌉\] his hands therein" (9, 6–8). "Indeed,
when the Nile overflows, no one ploughs for him (the Nile). Every man
says, 'We know not what has happened in the land' (2, 3). "Behold,
cattle are left straying; there is none gathering them together. Every
man brings for himself those that are branded with his name" (9, 2–3).
As meat thus disappears, men eat "of herbs washed down with water. . . .
Indeed, grain has perished on every side. Men are deprived of clothing,
⌈perfumes⌉, and ointments. All men say, 'There is none.' The storehouse
is laid waste; its keeper is stretched on the ground" (6, 1–4). "Civil
war pays no taxes. Scanty are ⌈grain⌉, charcoal, . . .  <span
id="fr_628"></span>[1](#fn_628.md) the labor of the craftsmen. . . . For
what is a treasury without its revenues?" (3, 10–11).

Under such economic conditions at home, foreign commerce decays and
disappears. "Men sail not northward to \[Byb\]los to-day. What shall we
do for cedars for our mummies, with the tribute of which priests are
buried; and with the oil of which \[princes\] are embalmed as far as
Keftyew. <span id="fr_629"></span>[2](#fn_629.md) They return no more.
Scanty is gold, ended are the . . . of all crafts. . . . What a great
thing that the natives of the oases (still) come bearing their festal
produce!" (3, 6–9). <span id="fr_630"></span>[3](#fn_630.md)

Such conditions might be expected, for the public safety of men and
merchandise has vanished. "Although the

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

roads are guarded, men sit in the thickets until the benighted traveller
comes, in order to seize his burden. That which is upon him is taken
away. He is beaten with blows of a stick and wickedly slain" (5, 11–12).
Indeed, the land turns around (the order of things is overturned) as
does a potter's wheel. He who was a robber is lord of wealth, \[⌈the
rich man⌉\] is (now) one plundered (2, 8–9). "Indeed, chests of ebony
are smashed and luxurious acacia-wood is split into ⌈billets⌉" (3, 4–6).
"Indeed, gates, columns, and ⌈walls⌉ are burned up" (2, 10). As in the
Song of the Harper and the despair of the Misanthrope, the provisions
for the dead are violated and serve no purpose. "Behold, though one be
buried as a (royal) falcon on the bier, that which the pyramid concealed
(the sepulchre) has become empty" (7, 2). When even the royal tombs are
not respected men make but little attempt to build a tomb. "Indeed, many
dead are buried in the river; the stream is a tomb and the embalming
place has become a stream" (2, 6–7). "Those who were in the embalming
place are laid away on the high ground" (instead of in a tomb) (4, 4).
"Behold, the owners of tombs are driven out upon the high ground."

Thus, as the figure of the "potter's wheel" suggests, all is overturned.
Social conditions have suffered complete upheaval. In the longest series
of utterances all similarly constructed, in the document, the sage sets
forth the altered conditions of certain individuals and classes of
society, each utterance contrasting what was with what now is. "Behold,
he who had no yoke of oxen is (now) possesser of a herd; and he who
found no plough-oxen for himself is (now) owner of a herd. Behold, he
who had no grain is (now) owner of granaries; and he who used to fetch
grain for himself, (now) has it issued

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (from his own
granary)" (9, 3–5). "Behold, the owner of wealth (now) passes the night
thirsting (instead of banqueting); and he who used to beg for himself
his dregs is now owner of ⌈overflowing⌉ bowls. Behold, the owners of
robes are (now) in rags; and he who wove not for himself is (now) owner
of fine linen" (7, 10–12). Thus the sage goes on with one contrast after
another. In such a state as this society is perishing. "Men are few; he
who lays away his fellow in the earth is everywhere" (2, 13–14). "There
is dearth of women and no conception (of children); Khnum (creator of
man) fashions not (men) by reason of the state of the land."

In the general ruin moral decadence is, of course, involved, though it
is not emphasized as the cause of the universal misery. "The man of
virtues walks in mourning by reason of what has happened in the land"
(1, 8); others say, "If I knew where the god is, then would I make
offerings to him" (5, 3). "Indeed, \[righteousness\] is in the land
(only) in this its name; what men do, in appealing to it, is
iniquity" <span id="fr_631"></span>[1](#fn_631) (5, 3–4.md). Little wonder
that there is universal despair. "Indeed, mirth has perished, it is no
longer made; it is sighing that is in the land, mingled with
lamentations" (3, 13–14). "Indeed, great and small \[say\], 'I would
that I might die.' Little children say, 'Would there were none to keep
me alive'" (4, 2–3). "Indeed, all small cattle, their hearts weep; the
cattle sigh by reason of the state of the land" (5, 5). The sage cannot
view all this dispassionately; he, too, is

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

deeply affected by the universal calamity and prays for the end of all.
"Would that there might be an end of men, that there might be no
conception, no birth. If the land would but cease from noise, and strife
be no more" (5, 12–6, 1). He even chides himself that he has not
endeavored to save the situation before. "Would that I had uttered my
voice at that time, that it might save me from the suffering wherein I
am" (6, 5). "Woe is me for the misery in this time!" (6, 8).

Such is the dark picture painted by the Egyptian sage. This arraignment,
occupying, as we have said, nearly two-thirds of the document as
preserved, must be regarded as setting forth the conditions in Egypt at
a very definite time. The close relationship in language, thought, and
point of view between this tractate of Ipuwer and the other social
pamphlets known to belong to the Feudal Age, leave little question as to
the date of our document. The unhappy state of Egypt depicted by the
sage must have existed in the obscure and little-known period
immediately preceding the Feudal Age (Middle Kingdom).

As might be imagined from the intense grief with which Ipuwer views the
misery of the time, he is not content to leave his generation in this
hopeless state. He now turns to exhortation, urging his countrymen first
to destroy the enemies of the king. Five short utterances (10, 6–11)
begin with the words: "Destroy the enemies of the august residence" (of
the king), although the papyrus is too fragmentary at this point to
determine clearly what followed each repetition of the injunction. At
least eight similar injunctions follow, each beginning with the word
"Remember!" (10, 12–11, 10) and calling upon all men to resume all
sacred observances on behalf of the gods. This second group of
exhortations is gradually

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

involved in ever-increasing obscurity as the fragmentary condition of
the papyrus grows worse. Out of a large lacuna at last <span
id="fr_632"></span>[1](#fn_632.md) there emerges the most important passage
in the entire speech of the sage, and one of the most important in the
whole range of Egyptian literature.

In this remarkable utterance the sage looks forward to the restoration
of the land, doubtless as a natural consequence of the admonitions to
reform which he has just laid upon the hearts of his countrymen. He sees
the ideal ruler for whose advent he longs. That ideal king once ruled
Egypt as the Sun-god, Re, and as the sage recalls that golden age, he
contrasts it with the iniquitous reign under which the land now suffers.
"He brings cooling to the flame. It is said he is the shepherd <span
id="fr_633"></span>[2](#fn_633.md) of all men. There is no evil in his
heart. When his herds are few, he passes the day to gather them
together, their hearts being fevered. <span
id="fr_634"></span>[3](#fn_634.md) Would that he had discerned their
character in the first generation. Then would he have smitten evil. He
would have stretched forth his arm against it. He would have smitten the
⌈seed⌉ thereof and their inheritance. . . . Where is he to-day? Doth he
sleep perchance? Behold his might is not seen" (11, 13–12, 6).

While there is no unquestionably predictive element in this passage, it
is a picture of the ideal sovereign, the righteous ruler with "no evil
in his heart," who goes about like a "shepherd" gathering his reduced
and thirsty herds.

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Such a righteous
reign, like that of David, has been, and may be again. The element of
hope, that the advent of the good king is imminent, is unmistakable in
the final words: "Where is he to-day? Doth he sleep perchance? Behold
his might is not seen." With this last utterance one involuntarily adds,
"as yet." The peculiar significance of the picture lies in the fact
that, if not the social programme, at least the social ideals, the
golden dream of the thinkers of this far-off age, already included the
ideal ruler of spotless character and benevolent purposes who would
cherish and protect his own and crush the wicked. Whether the coming of
this ruler is definitely predicted or not, the vision of his character
and his work is here unmistakably lifted up by the ancient sage—lifted
up in the presence of the living king and those assembled with him, that
they may catch something of its splendor. This is, of course, Messianism
nearly fifteen hundred years before its appearance among the
Hebrews." <span id="fr_635"></span>[1](#fn_635.md)

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

In the mind of the sage the awful contrast between the rule of the ideal
king and that of the living Pharaoh in whose presence he stands now
calls forth the fiercest denunciation of his sovereign. Like
Nathan <span id="fr_636"></span>[1](#fn_636.md) with his biting words,
"Thou art the man," he places the responsibility for all that he has so
vividly recalled upon the shoulders of the king. "Taste, Knowledge, and
Righteousness are with thee," he says, (but) "it is strife which thou
puttest in the land, together with the sound of tumult. Lo, one makes
attack upon another. Men conform to that which thou hast commanded. If
three men go upon a road, they are found to be two, (for) they who are
many slay the few. Is there a herdman who loves death, (that is, for his
herds)? Wherefore thou commandest

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

to make answer: 'It is because one man loves, (but) another hates' . . .
(Nay, I say) thou hast (so) done as to bring forth these things. Thou
hast spoken lies" (12, 12–13, 2). Having thus given the king the lie in
response to his supposed reply, the wise man for a moment reverts to
description of the desolate condition of society which occupied him in
the long arraignment. The progress of his thought, however, is toward
the future betterment to which he admonished after the conclusion of the
arraignment, and his bitter denunciation of the king; now, therefore,
the misery for which he is responsible merges into a final picture of
"joy and prosperity" (13, 9–14, 5) in eight strophes, each beginning
with a refrain of somewhat uncertain meaning.

The sage has completed his long address, and the king now actually
replies, though we are unable to recover it from the broken fragments of
the tattered page on which

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

it appears. A brief reply of Ipuwer ensues, beginning, "That which
Ipuwer said when he replied to the majesty of the sovereign." It is very
obscure, but seems to remind the king ironically that he has but done
what the inertia and indifference of a corrupt generation desired, and
here, as Gardiner shows, the tractate probably ended.

In recognizing the depths to which a degenerate and corrupt society and
government have descended, our sage has much in common with the
Misanthrope. The latter, however, found his individual fortunes so
fatally involved in the general catastrophe that there was no hope, and
he desired death as the only solution. Ipuwer, on the other hand, quite
unmistakably looks toward a future redemption of society. The appearance
in this remote age of the necessary detachment and the capacity to
contemplate society, things before unknown in the thought of man, is a
significant phenomenon. Still more significant, however, is this vision
of the possible redemption of society, and the agent of that redemption
as a righteous king, who is to shield his own and to purge the earth of
the wicked. This is but the earliest emergence of a. social idealism
which among the Hebrews we call "Messianism." Such a conception might go
far in the early East. After centuries of circulation in Egypt, the tale
picturing the trial of the virtue of a good youth, as we have it in the
Story of the Two Brothers, passed over into Palestine, to be
incorporated in the mosaic which has descended to us as the story of
Joseph. How such materials migrated among the peoples of the eastern
Mediterranean has been demonstrated by the recent recovery of the
Aramaic original of the Story of Akhikar. Under these circumstances it
is more than possible that the imagination of the literary prophets of
the Hebrews was first touched by some knowledge

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

of the Egyptian vision of the ideal age and the ideal king set forth in
such a tractate as that of Ipuwer, and wandering into Palestine, as did
the Tale of the Two Brothers.

We see, then, that not all of the social thinkers at the court of the
Pharaoh in the Feudal Age shared the unqualified pessimism which we had
thus far found in their earlier teachings; nor, on the other hand, did
they follow exclusively the fair but elusive vision of this Messianic
dreamer. Not an ideal king only, but a body of just officials should
usher in the era of social justice in the thought of some. The men of
this school as they scanned life, held wholesome and practical
principles of right living applicable to the daily situation of the
average member of the official class. These views have found expression
in at least two tractates which have descended to us: The Eloquent
Peasant and the Wisdom of Ptahhotep. The first, whose author, as so
commonly in this impersonal age, we do not know, is in the form of a
picturesque Oriental tale, conceived solely to furnish a dramatic
setting for a series of disquisitions on the proper character and spirit
of the just official, and the resulting social and administrative
justice toward the poor. It is not a little interesting to discern this
ancient thinker of four thousand years ago wrestling with a difficulty
which has since then continued to be one of the most refractory problems
of all administrators in the East, a problem which has not been wholly
solved even under the skilled and experienced administration of England
in Egypt at the present day.

The tale of the Eloquent Peasant is as follows. <span
id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_637.md) A

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

peasant of the Fayum region in the Natron district, living in a village
called the Salt-Field, loads a small train of donkeys with the produce
of his village and goes down to Heracleopolis, near the mouth of the
Fayum, to trade for grain. On the way thither he is obliged to pass the
establishment of one Thutenakht, a subordinate official among the people
of Rensi, <span id="fr_638"></span>[1](#fn_638.md) who was grand steward of
the Pharaoh himself, Heracleopolis being the royal residence at the time
in which the action is placed (Ninth or Tenth Dynasty). Now, when
Thutenakht sees the donkeys of the peasant approaching, he at once
devises a plan for seizing them. Sending a servant hastily to the house,
he secures thence some pieces of linen, which he spreads out in the
highway so as to fill it entirely from the edge of the grain-field on
the upper side to the water of the canal on the lower. The unsuspecting
peasant approaches, as the tale, with a discernible touch of the
writer's indignation, states, "on the way belonging to every one," which
Thutenakht has thus blocked. Fearing the water below, the peasant turns
upward to skirt the edge of the grain-field.

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As the donkeys
pass, one of them nips a mouthful of the tempting grain, at once
affording the wily Thutenakht the opportunity he desired. The peasant
pathetically maintains the attitude and the speech of deprecatory but
not servile courtesy, until with loud complaint Thutenakht seizes the
asses. Thereupon the peasant repeats his former courteous remonstrance,
but adds a bold protest. "My way is right. One side is blocked. I bring
my ass along the edge thereof, and thou seizest him because he has
plucked a mouthful of the grain. Now, I know the lord of this domain. It
belongs to the grand steward, Meru's son, Rensi. Now, it is he who
drives off every robber in this whole land. Shall I then be robbed in
his domain!" Infuriated by the peasant's boldness, Thutenakht seizes a
branch of green tamarisk, mercilessly beats his victim, and, in spite of
the peasant's cries and protests, drives off the asses to his own
quarters. After four days of fruitless pleading for the return of the
asses, the unhappy peasant, all the time knowing that his family at home
is on the verge of starvation, determines to apply to the grand steward
himself, on whose domain the outrage occurred. He is the more encouraged
in so doing by the proverbial reputation for justice which the grand
steward enjoys. As the peasant approaches the city, he fortunately meets
the grand steward issuing from the shore-gate of his estate and going
down to embark in his state barge on the canal. By the most ceremonious
politeness and complete command of the current diplomacy of address, the
peasant gains the ear of the great man for a moment as he passes, so
that he sends a body-servant to hear the peasant's story. When the
servant has returned and communicated Thutenakht's theft to Rensi, the
grand steward lays the affair before his suite of officials.

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Their reply is the
author's skilfully created occasion for bringing before the reader,
without comment, the current and conventional treatment of such
complaints of the poor in official circles. The colleagues of the grand
steward at once range themselves on the side of their subordinate, the
thievish Thutenakht. They reply to Rensi, with much indifference, that
the case is probably one of a peasant who has been paying his dues to
the wrong superior officer, and that Thutenakht has merely seized dues
which rightfully belonged to him. They ask with indignation, "Shall
Thutenakht be punished for a little natron and a little salt? (Or at
most) let it be commanded him to replace it and he will replace it." It
is characteristic of their class that they quite ignore the asses, the
loss of which means starvation to the peasant and his family.

Meantime the peasant stands by and hears his fatal loss thus slurred
over and ignored by those in authority. The grand steward meanwhile
stands musing in silence. It is a tableau which epitomizes ages of
social history in the East: on the one hand, the brilliant group of the
great man's sleek and subservient suite, the universal type of the
official class; and, on the other, the friendless and forlorn figure of
the despoiled peasant, the pathetic personification of the cry for
social justice. This scene is one of the earliest examples of that
Oriental skill in setting forth abstract principles in concrete
situations, so wonderfully illustrated later in the parables of Jesus.
Seeing that the grand steward makes no reply, the peasant makes another
effort to save his family and himself from the starvation which
threatens them all. He steps forward and with amazing eloquence
addresses the great man in whose hands his case now rests, promising

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

him a fair voyage as he embarks on the canal and voicing the fame of the
grand steward's benevolence on which he had reckoned. "For thou art the
father of the orphan, the husband of the widow, the brother of the
forsaken, the kilt of the motherless. Let me put thy name in this land
above every good law, O leader free from avarice, great man free from
littleness, who destroys falsehood and brings about truth. Respond to
the cry which my mouth utters, when I speak, hear thou. Do justice, thou
who art praised, whom the praised praise. Relieve my misery. Behold me,
I am heavy laden; prove me, to I am in sorrow." <span
id="fr_639"></span>[1](#fn_639.md)

The grand steward is so pleased with the peasant's extraordinary
readiness in speech, that he leaves him without giving any decision in
his case, and proceeds at once to the court, where he says to the king:
"My lord, I have found one of these peasants who is verily beautiful of
speech." The king, greatly pleased, charges the grand steward to lead
the peasant on without giving him a decision, in order that he may
deliver himself of further addresses. The king likewise commands that
what the peasant says shall be carefully written down, and that meantime
he shall be supplied with food and maintenance and that a servant be
sent to his village to see that his family suffers no want in the
interval. As a result of these arrangements, the peasant makes no less
than eight successive appeals to Rensi.

These addresses to the grand steward at first reflect the grievous
disappointment of the peasant in view of the great man's reputation for
unswerving justice. He therefore begins his second address with
reproaches, which

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rensi interrupts
with threats. The peasant, like Ipuwer in his arraignment of the king,
is undaunted and continues his reproof. The third speech reverts to
praises like those of his first appeal to Rensi. "O grand steward, my
lord! Thou art Re, lord of the sky together with thy court. All the
affairs of men (are thine). Thou art like the flood (inundation), thou
art the Nile that makes green the fields and furnishes the waste lands.
Ward off the robber, protect the wretched, become not a torrent against
him who pleads. Take heed, (for) eternity draws near. Prefer acting as
it is (proverbially) said, 'It is the breath of the nostrils to do
justice' (or 'right, righteousness, truth'). Execute punishment on him
to whom punishment is due, and none shall be like thy correctness. Do
the balances err? Does the scale-beam swerve to one side? . . . Speak
not falsehood, (for) thou art great (and therefore responsible). Be not
light, (for) thou art weighty. Speak not falsehood, for thou art the
balances. Swerve not, for thou art a correct sum. Lo, thou art at one
with the balances. If they tip (falsely) thou tippest (falsely). . . .
Thy tongue is the index (of the balances), thy heart is the weight, thy
two lips are the beam thereof" (11. 140–167).

These comparisons of the grand steward's character and functions with
the balances appear repeatedly in the speeches of the peasant. <span
id="fr_640"></span>[1](#fn_640.md) Their lesson is evident. The norm of
just procedure is in the hands of the ruling class. If they fail, where
else shall it be found? It is expected that they shall weigh right and
wrong and reach a just decision with the infallibility of accurate
balances. They form a symbol which became widely current in Egyptian

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

life, till the scales appear as the graphic means of depicting the
judgment of each soul in the hereafter. Indeed in the hands of blind
Justice they have survived even into our own day. But this symbol had
its origin among these social thinkers of the Feudal Age in Egypt four
thousand years ago. It should be noticed, too, that the peasant reminds
the grand steward of his own appearance before the judgment of the
impartial balances. "Take heed," says he, "(for) eternity draws near."
This is one of few appeals against injustice to the future
responsibility of the oppressor. It is found once more also in this
document, in the second speech of the peasant. <span
id="fr_641"></span>[1](#fn_641.md)

The threats of the peasant now prove too keen for the grand steward as
he stands before the palace, and he despatches two servants to flog the
unhappy man. Nevertheless he awaits Rensi's coming, as he issues from
the state temple of the residence, to address him in a fourth speech,
and proceeds then in a fifth to even sharper denunciation. "Thou art
appointed," he says, "to hear causes, to judge two litigants, to ward
off the robber. But thou makest common cause with the thief. Men love
thee, although thou art a transgressor. Thou art set for a dam for the
afflicted, to save him from drowning." <span
id="fr_642"></span>[2](#fn_642.md)

Still there is no response from Rensi, and the peasant begins a sixth
address with renewed appeal to the great man's sense of justice and his
reputation for benevolence. "O grand steward, my lord! ⌈Destroy⌉
falsehood, bring about justice. Bring about every good thing, destroy
\[every evil\] thing; like the coming of satiety, that it may end
hunger; (or) clothing, that it may end nakedness; like the peaceful sky
after the violent tempest, that it may

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

warm those who suffer cold; like fire that cooks what is raw; like water
that quenches thirst." <span id="fr_643"></span>[1](#fn_643.md)

As Rensi remains unresponsive to this appeal, the wretched peasant is
again goaded to denunciation. "Thou art instructed, thou art educated,
thou art taught, but not for robbery. Thou art accustomed to do like all
men and thy kin are (likewise) ensnared. (Thou) the rectitude of all
men, art the (chief) transgressor of the whole land. The gardener of
evil, waters his domain with iniquity that his domain may bring forth
falsehood, in order to flood the estate with wickedness." <span
id="fr_644"></span>[2](#fn_644.md) Even such denunciation seems now to
leave the grand steward entirely indifferent and the peasant approaches
for his seventh speech. He begins with the usual florid encomium in
which the grand steward is the "rudder of the whole land according to
whose command the land sails," <span id="fr_645"></span>[3](#fn_645.md) but
turns soon to his own miserable condition. "My body is full, and my
heart is burdened," he complains; "there is a break in the dam and the
waters thereof rush out. (Thus) my mouth is opened to speak." Then as
the indifference of this man of just and benevolent reputation
continues, the unhappy peasant's provocation is such that the silence of
the grand steward appears as something which would have aroused the
speech of the most stupid and faltering of pleaders. "There is none
silent whom thou wouldst not have roused to speech. There is none
sleeping whom thou wouldst not have wakened. There is none unskilled
whom thou wouldst not have made efficient. There is no closed mouth
which thou wouldst not have opened. There is none ignorant

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

whom thou wouldst not have made wise. There is none foolish whom thou
wouldst not have taught." <span id="fr_646"></span>[1](#fn_646.md) Unable
to restrain the tide of his indignation, therefore, the peasant goes on
to his eighth speech and continued denunciation. "Thy heart is
avaricious; it becomes thee not. Thou robbest; it profiteth thee not. .
. . The officials who were installed to ward off iniquity are a refuge
for the unbridled, (even) the officials who were installed to ward off
falsehood." <span id="fr_647"></span>[2](#fn_647.md) The appeal to justice,
however, is not abandoned, and the peasant returns to it in the most
remarkable utterances in this remarkable tractate. "Do justice for the
sake of the lord of justice . . . thou (who art) Pen and Roll and
Writing Palette, (even) Thoth <span id="fr_648"></span>[3](#fn_648.md) who
art far from doing evil. . . . For justice (or 'righteousness, right,
truth') is for eternity. It descends with him that doeth it into the
grave, when he is placed in the coffin and laid in the earth. His name
is not effaced on earth; he is remembered because of good. Such is the
exact summation of the divine word." Upon these impressive words follows
naturally the question whether, in spite of this, injustice is still
possible; and so the peasant asks: "Do the balances indeed swerve? Do
the scales indeed incline to one side?" Or is it merely that no decision
at all has been reached to right the shameful wrong which he has
suffered? And yet the just magistrate who might have righted it has been
present from the beginning. "Thou hast not been sick, thou hast not
fled, thou hast not ⌈hidden thyself⌉! (But) thou hast not given me
requital for this good word which came out of

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

the mouth of Re himself: 'Speak the truth, do the truth. <span
id="fr_649"></span>[1](#fn_649.md) For it is great, it is mighty, it is
enduring. The reward thereof shall find thee, and it shall follow (thee)
unto blessedness hereafter.'" <span id="fr_650"></span>[2](#fn_650.md)

No response from Rensi follows these noble words. The peasant lifts up
his voice again in a final despairing plea, his ninth address. He
reminds the grand steward of the dangers of consorting with deceit; he
who does so "shall have no children and no heirs on earth. As for him
who sails with it (deceit), he shall not reach the land, and his vessel
shall not moor at her haven. . . . There is no yesterday for the
indifferent. There is no friend for him who is deaf to justice. There is
no glad day for the avaricious. . . . Lo, I make my plea to thee, but
thou hearest it not. I will go and make my plea because of thee to
Anubis." In view of the fact that Anubis is a god of the dead, the
peasant doubtless means that he goes to take his own life. The grand
steward sends his servants to bring him back as he departs, and some
unintelligible words pass between them. Meantime, Rensi "had committed
to a roll every petition (of the peasant) unto \[this\] day." It is
[supposedly](errata.htm#5.md) a copy of this roll which has descended to
us; but, unfortunately, the conclusion has been torn off. We can only
discern that the roll prepared by Rensi's secretaries is taken by him to
the king, who found "it more pleasant to (his) heart than anything in
this whole land." <span id="fr_651"></span>[3](#fn_651.md) The king
commands

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

the grand steward to decide the peasant's case, the attendants bring in
the census-rolls, which determine where he officially belongs, his exact
legal and social status, the number of people in his household, and the
amount of his property. Less than a dozen broken words follow, from
which it is probable that Thutenakht was punished, and that the
possessions of that greedy and plundering official were bestowed upon
the peasant.

The high ideal of justice to the poor and oppressed set forth in this
tale is but a breath of that wholesome moral atmosphere which pervades
the social thinking of the official class. It is remarkable, indeed, to
find these aristocrats of the Pharaoh's court four thousand years ago
sufficiently concerned for the welfare of the lower classes to have
given themselves the trouble to issue what are very evidently propaganda
for a régime of justice and kindness toward the poor. They were
pamphleteers in a crusade for social justice. They have made this
particular pamphlet, too, very pleasant reading for the patrician class
to whom it was directed. In spite of the constant obscurity of the
language, the florid style, and the bold and extreme figures of speech,
it enjoyed a place as literature of a high order in its day. It is
evidently in the approved style of its age, and the pungent humor which
here and there reaches the surface could but enhance the literary
reputation of the tractate in the estimation of the humor-loving
Egyptians. But it was literature with a moral purpose.

It is probable that the Wisdom of Ptahhotep, <span
id="fr_652"></span>[1](#fn_652.md) the other

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

social tractate of the official class, did not enjoy the same
popularity. It is not so clearly cast in the form of a tale, though it
does not lack dramatic setting. Like the Eloquent Peasant, the action is
placed under an earlier king. Indeed, the most important manuscript of
Ptahhotep purports to contain also the wisdom of a still earlier sage
who lived a thousand years before the Feudal Age. The composition
attributed to the earlier wise man preceded that of Ptahhotep in the
roll and probably formed its beginning and first half. All but a few
passages at the end have been torn off, but its conclusion is
instructive as furnishing part of the historical setting of earlier days
in which this school of sages were wont to place their teachings.
Following the last fourteen lines of his instruction, all that is
preserved, we find the conclusion of the unknown sage's life:

"The vizier (for such he purports to have been) caused his children to
be summoned, after he had discerned the

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

fashion of men and their character ⌈came to him⌉. <span
id="fr_653"></span>[1](#fn_653.md) . . . He said to them: As for everything
that is in writing in this roll, hear it as I say it ⌈as an added
obligation⌉.' They threw themselves upon their bellies, they read it
according to that which was in writing. It was pleasanter to their
hearts than anything that is in this whole land. <span
id="fr_654"></span>[2](#fn_654.md) Then they rose up and they sat down
accordingly. Then the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Huni
died, and the majesty of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt Snefru was
established as excellent king in this whole land. Then Kegemne was
appointed to be governor of the (residence) city and vizier. It (the
book) is ended." <span id="fr_655"></span>[3](#fn_655.md) Presumably, the
career of the nameless old vizier and sage of the Third Dynasty, into
whose mouth the wisdom of the Twelfth Dynasty was put, ended with the
life of his king and the advent of a new vizier. <span
id="fr_656"></span>[4](#fn_656.md) It is evident that social ethics as
taught by the sages of the Twelfth Dynasty (Feudal Age) was also
commonly attributed by them to the viziers of the Pyramid Age, for we
shall find that this was the case also with the Wisdom of Ptahhotep,
which was the next roll taken up by the copyist as he resumed this pen,
leaving an interval to mark the end of the old book which he had just
finished.

The Wisdom of Ptahhotep begins: "The instruction of the governor of the
city and vizier, Ptahhotep, under the majesty of the king of Upper and
Lower Egypt, Isesi, who lives for ever and ever. The governor of the
city and vizier Ptahhotep says, O king, my lord, infirmity comes on, old
age advances, the limbs weaken,

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> ⌈feebleness⌉ is
renewed, strength perishes because of the languor of the heart
(understanding). The mouth is silent and speaks not; the eyes wax small,
the ears are dulled. The languid heart sleeps every day. The heart
forgets, it remembers not yesterday. . . . That which is good becomes
evil. All taste departs. That which old age does to people is evil in
everything. The nostrils are stopped up, they breathe not. It is evil
whether one stands or sits. Let thy servant be commanded to furnish the
staff of old age. <span id="fr_657"></span>[1](#fn_657.md) Let my son stand
in my place, and let me instruct him according to the word of those who
have heard the manner of the ancestors, that (word) which the
forefathers served, (variant: "which the gods have heard"). May they do
likewise for thee; may revolt be suppressed among the people (of Egypt),
may the Two Lands serve thee."'

"Said his majesty: 'Instruct him after the word of old. May he do
marvels among the children of the princes. . . .'"

The Wisdom of Ptahhotep then purports to have been uttered by a
historical personage on a particular occasion. In the Fifth Dynasty, to
which king Isesi belonged, there was indeed a line of viziers named
Ptahhotep, who transmitted the office from father to son. The reign of
Isesi fell about five hundred years earlier than the Feudal Age in which
we find his wise vizier's wisdom in circulation. Ptahhotep petitions the
king to appoint his son to the vizierial office in his place, because of
advancing old age, the ills of which he graphically enumerates. In order

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

that his son may be informed in the duties of so important an office,
the vizier craves of the king permission to instruct him. While it is
characteristic of the attitude of the inner official circle that the
wisdom communicated should be designated as that which has descended
from the fathers, its cautious mandates for right and wholesome living
and for discreet official conduct may quite conceivably represent the
sum total of the ripe experience of many generations of official life.
While such men as the Misanthrope, Khekheperre-sonbu, and to a large
extent also even Ipuwer had lost all confidence in the conventional
virtue of the official world, the doctrines of the Eloquent Peasant and
the Wisdom of Ptahhotep reveal to us that at least a nucleus of the best
men of the official class and the court still felt confidence in the
good old manner of living which had come down from their predecessors,
if carefully conserved, and the principles of virtue persistently
inculcated. Like all such fancied conservation, it contains clear
evidences of the current and modern point of view, so much so indeed
that there is ground for another interpretation of the historical
setting, namely, that it was used merely to give prestige to a set of
teachings which were for the most part modern. If so, the device is in
sharp contrast with the open avowal of Khekheperre-sonbu that he sought
new views and words which had not become hackneyed by generations of
use.

Having received the king's permission, Ptahhotep enters upon the
instruction of his son. "Beginning of the sayings of the good word which
the hereditary prince, the count, the divine father, the priest, the
eldest son of the king, of his body, the governor of the city, the
vizier, Ptahhotep said, as instruction of the ignorant to knowledge,
according to the correctness of the good word, as a

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

profitable thing for him who is obedient to it, and as an evil thing for
him who transgresses it." <span id="fr_658"></span>[1](#fn_658.md)

The introduction concludes with a short paragraph on the desirability of
humility in wisdom in spite of its high value. Then begin the
forty-three paragraphs into which the Wisdom of Ptahhotep is divided.
There is not space here either for the entire text of this excessively
difficult tractate or for the commentary necessary to make it
intelligible to the modern reader. Nor even so, on the basis of our
modern knowledge of the language, is it possible to render the document
as a whole. <span id="fr_659"></span>[2](#fn_659.md)

The following table of the rubrics heading the paragraphs and suggesting
in each case the subject discussed will serve, however, to indicate the
ground which the wise man endeavored to cover. Where distinctly ethical
problems are involved I have added to the rubric as much of the text as
I found intelligible.

1\. "If thou findest a wise man in his time, a leader of understanding
more excellent than thou, bend thy arms and bow thy back" <span
id="fr_660"></span>[3](#fn_660) (5, 10–12.md).

2\. "If thou findest a wise man in his time, thy equal, . . . be not
silent when he speaks evil. Great is the approval by those who hear, and
thy name will be good in the knowledge of the princes" (5, 13–14).

3\. "If thou findest a wise man in his time, a poor man

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

and not thy equal, be not overbearing against him when he is
unfortunate" (6, 1–2).

4\. "If thou art a leader (or 'administrator') issuing ordinances for
the multitude, seek for thee every excellent matter, that thy ordinance
may endure without evil therein. Great is righteousness (truth, right,
justice), enduring . . .; it has not been disturbed since the time of
Osiris" (6, 3–7).

5\. "Put no fear (of thee?) among the people. . . . What the god
commands is that which happens. Therefore live in the midst of quiet.
What they (the gods?) give comes of itself" (6, 8–10).

6\. "If thou art a man of those who sit by the seat of a man greater
than thou, take what (food) he gives, . . . look at what is before thee,
and bombard <span id="fr_661"></span>[1](#fn_661.md) him not with many
glances (don't stare at him). . . . Speak not to him until he calls. One
knows not what is unpleasant to (his) heart. Speak thou when he greets
thee, and what thou sayest will be agreeable to (his) heart" (6, 11–7,
3).

7\. "If thou art a man of ⌈those who⌉ enter, whom (one) prince sends to
(another) prince, . . . execute for him the commission according as he
saith. Beware of \[altering-I a word which (one) prince ⌈speaks⌉ to
(another) prince, by displacing the truth with the like of it" (7, 3–5).

8\. "If thou ploughest and there is growth in the field, the god gives
it (as) increase in thy hand. Satisfy not thine own mouth beside thy
kin" (7, 5–6).

9\. "If thou art insignificant, follow an able man and all thy
proceedings shall be good before the god" (7, 7–8).

10\. "Follow thy desire as long as thou livest. Do not more than is told
(thee). Shorten not the time of following desire. It is an abomination
to encroach upon the

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

time thereof. ⌈Take⌉ no ⌈care⌉ daily beyond the maintenance of thy
house. When possessions come, follow desire, (for) possessions are not
complete when he (the owner) is ⌈harassed⌉ (7, 9–10).

11\. "If thou art an able man" (give attention to the conduct of thy
son) (7, 10–8, 1).

12\. "If thou art in the judgment-hall, standing or sitting" (8, 2–6).

13\. "If thou art together with people" (8, 6–11).

14\. "Report thy procedure without ⌈reservation⌉. Present thy plan in
the council of thy lord" (8, 11–13).

15\. "If thou art a leader" (or "administrator") (8, 14–9, 3).

16\. "If thou art a leader (or 'administrator'), hear ⌈quietly⌉ the
speech of the petitioner. He who is suffering wrong desires that his
heart be cheered to do that on account of which he has come. . . . It is
an ornament of the heart to hear kindly" (9, 3–6).

17\. "If thou desirest to establish friendship in a house, into which
thou enterest as lord, as brother, or as friend, wheresoever thou
enterest in, beware of approaching the women. . . . A thousand men are
undone for the enjoyment of a brief moment like a dream. Men gain (only)
death for knowing them" (9, 7–13).

18\. "If thou desirest that thy procedure be good, withhold thee from
all evil, beware of occasion of avarice. . . . He who enters therein
does not get on. It corrupts fathers, mothers, and mother's brothers. It
⌈divides⌉ wife and man; it is plunder (made up) of everything evil; it
is a bundle of everything base. Established is the man whose standard is
righteousness, who walks according to its way. He is used to make his
fortune thereby, (but) the avaricious is houseless" (9, 13–10, 5).

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

19\. "Be not avaricious in dividing. . . . Be not avaricious toward thy
kin. Greater is the fame of the gentle than (that of) the harsh" (10,
5–8).

20\. "If thou art successful, establish thy house. Love thy wife in
husbandly embrace, fill her body, clothe her back. The recipe for her
limbs is ointment. Gladden her heart as long as thou livest. She is a
profitable field for her lord" (10, 8–12). <span
id="fr_662"></span>[1](#fn_662.md)

21\. "Satisfy those who enter to thee (come into thy office) with that
which thou hast" (11, 1–4).

22\. "Repeat not a word of ⌈hearsay⌉" (11, 5–7).

23\. "If thou art an able man who sits in the council of his lord,
summon thy understanding to excellent things. Be silent" (for speech is
difficult) (11, 8–11).

24\. "If thou art a strong man, establish the respect of thee by wisdom
and by quietness of speech" (11, 12–12, 6).

25\. "⌈Approach⌉ not a prince in his time" <span
id="fr_663"></span>[2](#fn_663) (12, 6–9.md).

26\. "Instruct a prince (or 'official') in that which is profitable for
him" (12, 9–13).

27\. "If thou art the son of a man of the council, commissioned to
content the multitude, . . . be not partial. Beware lest he (the man of

29\. "If thou becomest great after thou wert little, and gettest
possessions after thou wert formerly poor in the city, . . . be not
⌈proud⌉-hearted because of thy wealth. It has come to thee as a gift of
the god" (13, 6–9).

30\. "Bend thy back to thy superior, thy overseer of the king's house,
and thy house shall endure because of his (or 'its') possessions and thy
reward shall be in the place thereof. It is evil to show disobedience to
a superior. One lives as long as he is gentle" (13, 9–14, 4).

31\. "Do not practise corruption of children" (14, 4–6).

32\. "If thou searchest the character of a friend, . . . transact the

thy plans will progress. As for the matter of the righteousness thereof,
it is their worth. The memory thereof shall ⌈circulate⌉ in the mouths of
men, because of the beauty of their utterances. Every word will be
carried on and not perish in this land forever. . . . He who understands
⌈discretion⌉ is profitable in establishing that through which he
succeeds on earth. A wise man is ⌈satisfied⌉ by reason of that which he
knows. As for a prince of good qualities, ⌈they are in⌉ his heart and
his tongue. His lips are right when he speaks, his eyes see, and his
ears together hear what is profitable for his son. Do right
(righteousness, truth, justice), free from lying" (15, 8–16, 2).

38\. "Profitable is hearkening for a son that hearkens. . . . How good
it is when a son receives that which his

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

father says. He shall reach advanced age thereby. A hearkener is one
whom the god loves. Who hearkens not is one whom the god hates. It is
the heart (= understanding) which makes its possessor a hearkener or one
not hearkening. The life prosperity and health of a man is his heart.
The hearkener is one who hears and speaks. He who does what is said, is
one who loves to hearken. How good it is when a son hearkens to his
father! How happy is he to whom these things are said! . . . His memory
is in the mouth of the living who are on earth and those who shall be"
(16, 3–12).

39\. "If the son of a man receives what his father says, none of his
plans will miscarry. Instruct as thy son one who hearkens, who shall be
successful in the judgment of the princes, who directs his mouth
according to that which is said to him. . . . How many mishaps befall
him who hearkens not! The wise man rises early to establish himself,
while the fool is ⌈scourged⌉" (16, 13–17, 4).

40\. "As for the fool who hearkens not, he accomplishes nothing. He
regards wisdom as ignorance, and what is profitable as diseased. . . .
His life is like death thereby, . . . he dies, living every day. Men
pass by (avoid?) his qualities, because of the multitude of evils upon
him every day" (17, 4–9).

41\. "A son who hearkens is a follower of Horus. He prospers after he
hearkens. He reaches old age, he attains reverence. He speaks likewise
to his (own) children, renewing the instruction of his father. Every man
who instructs is like his sire. He speaks with his children; then they
speak to their children. Attain character, . . . make righteousness to
flourish and thy children shall live" (17, 10–18, 12).

42\. Concerns "thy heart" (understanding) and "thy

mouth." "Let thy attention be steadfast as long as thou speakest,
whither thou directest thy speech. May the princes who shall hear say,
'How good is that which comes out of his mouth!"' (18, 12–19, 3).

43\. "So do that thy lord shall say to thee, 'How good is the
instruction of his father from whose limbs he came forth! He has spoken
to him; it is in (his) body throughout. Greater is that which he has
done than that which was said to him.' Behold, a good son, whom the god
gives, renders more than that which his lord says to him. He does right
(righteousness, etc.), his heart acts according to his way. According as
thou attainest me ('what I have attained'), thy limbs shall be healthy,
the king shall be satisfied with all that occurs, and thou shalt attain
years of life not less \[⌈than⌉\] I have passed on earth. I have
attained one hundred and ten years of life, while the king gave to me
praise above (that of) the ancestors (in the vizierial office) because I
did righteousness for the king even unto the place of reverence (the
grave)" <span id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_664) (19, 3–8.md).

In the Wisdom of Ptahhotep we have what purports to be the ripe worldly
wisdom of a seasoned old statesman and courtier, with a long life of
experience with men and affairs behind him. Nor do they in any way belie
their assumed authorship. It is easy to picture a self-satisfied old
prince looking back with vast complacency upon his long career, and
drawing out of his wide experience, with no attempt at arrangement, the
precepts of conduct, official and personal, which he has found valuable.
As a matter of fact, however, it is evident that

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

we have here a collection of precepts which had grown up among the
officials of the Egyptian state when this compilation was made, and put
into the mouth of Ptah-hotep. Some of them are doubtless much older than
the collection itself; but in the main they reflect to us the
conventional daily philosophy of the wisest among the official body in
the Feudal Age.

Over half of these admonitions deal with personal character and conduct,
while the remainder have to do with administration and official
conduct. <span id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_665.md) In general they inculcate
gentleness, moderation, and discretion without lack of self-assertion,
displaying indeed the soundest good sense in the poise and balance to
which they commend the young man. There is none of the sombre pessimism
of the Misanthrope or Khekheperre-sonbu. Life is abundantly worth while.
A wholesome amount of pleasure is to be taken, and official or other
burdens are not to be allowed to curtail the hours of relaxation (see
paragraph 10). Moreover, a man should always wear a cheerful face, for
"there is no use in crying over spilt milk." Finally the dominant note
is a commanding moral earnestness which pervades the whole homely
philosophy of the old vizier's wisdom. The most prominent imperative
throughout is "do right," and "deal justly with all."

So prominent are justice, character, and moral ideals in the surviving
documents of this great age, that I am

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

confident we should place here the Installation of the Vizier, a
traditional address orally delivered to the vizier by the king in person
whenever a new incumbent was inducted into the vizierial office. <span
id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_666.md) This remarkable address shows that the
spirit of the Wisdom of Ptahhotep and the Eloquent Peasant was not
exclusively a matter of homely proverbial philosophy, current precepts
of conduct, or a picturesque story with a moral. This spirit of social
justice pervaded even the very structure of the state and had reached
the throne itself. The address is as follows:

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

"Regulation laid upon the vizier X. <span
id="fr_667"></span>[1](#fn_667.md) The council was conducted into the
audience hall of Pharaoh, Life! Prosperity! Health! One (= the king)
caused that there be brought in the vizier X, newly appointed."

"Said his majesty to him, 'Look to the office of the vizier; be watchful
over all that is done therein. Behold it is the established support of
the whole land.'

"'Behold, as for the vizierate, it is not sweet; behold, it is bitter,
as ⌈he is named⌉. \[Behold\], he is copper enclosing the gold of his
\[lord's\] house. Behold it (the vizierate) is not to show
respect-of-persons to princes and councillors; it is not to make for
himself slaves of any people.'

"'Behold, as for a man in the house of his lord, his ⌈conduct⌉ is good
for him (the lord). (But) lo, he does not the same for another' (than
the lord). <span id="fr_668"></span>[2](#fn_668.md)

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

"'Behold, when a petitioner comes from Upper or Lower Egypt (even) the
whole land, equipped with . . . see thou to it that everything is done
in accordance with law; that everything is done according to the custom
thereof, \[giving\] to \[⌈every man⌉\] his right. Behold a prince is in
a conspicuous place, water and wind report concerning all that he does.
For behold, that which is done by him never remains unknown.'

"'When he takes up a matter \[for a petition\]er according to his case,
he (the vizier) shall not proceed by the statement of a departmental
officer. <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_669.md) But it (the matter under
consideration) shall be known by the statement of one designated by him
(the vizier), saying it himself in the presence of a departmental
officer with the words: "It is not that I raise my voice; (but) I send
the petitioner \[according to\] his \[case to ⌈another court⌉\] or
prince." Then that which has been done by him has not been
misunderstood.'

"'Behold the refuge of a prince is to act according to the regulation by
doing what is said' (to him). <span id="fr_670"></span>[2](#fn_670.md) A
petitioner who has been adjudged \[⌈shall not say⌉\]: 'My right has not
been given to. \[me\].'

"'Behold, it is a saying which was in the ⌈vizierial installation⌉ of
Memphis in the utterance of the king in urging the vizier to moderation
. . . "\[Bewar\]e of that which is said of the vizier Kheti. It is said
that he discriminated against some of the people of his own kin \[in
favor of\] strangers, for fear lest it should be said of him that he
\[favored\] his \[kin dishon\]estly. When one of

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

them appealed against the judgment which he thought ⌈to make⌉ him, he
persisted in his discrimination." Now that is more than justice.'

"'Forget not to judge justice. It is an abomination of the god to show
partiality. This is the teaching. Therefore do thou accordingly. Look
upon him who is known to thee like him who is unknown to thee; and him
who is near the king like him who is far from \[his house\]. Behold, a
prince who does this, he shall endure here in this place.'

"'Pass not over a petitioner without regarding his speech. If there is a
petitioner who shall appeal to thee, being one whose speech is not what
is said, <span id="fr_671"></span>[1](#fn_671.md) dismiss him after having
let him hear that on account of which thou dismissest him. Behold, it is
said: "A petitioner desires that his saying be regarded rather than the
hearing of that on account of which he has come."'

"'Be not wroth against a man wrongfully; (but) be thou wroth at that at
which one should be wroth.'

"'Cause thyself to be feared. Let men be afraid of thee. A prince is a
prince of whom one is afraid. Behold, the dread of a prince is that he
does justice. Behold, if a man causes himself to be feared a multitude
of times, there is something wrong in him in the opinion of the people.
They do not say of him, "He is a man (indeed)." Behold, the ⌈fear⌉ of a
prince \[⌈deters⌉\] the liar, when he (the prince) proceeds according to
the dread of him. Behold, this shalt thou attain by administering this
office, doing justice.'

"'Behold, men expect the doing of justice in the procedure \[of\] the
vizier. Behold, that is its (justice's) customary

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[⌈law⌉\] since
the god. Behold, it is said concerning the scribe of the vizier: "A just
scribe," is said of him. Now, as for the hall' in which thou "hearest"
there is an audience-hall therein \[⌈for⌉\] ⌈the announcement⌉ of
judgments. Now, as for "him who shall do justice before all the people,"
it is the vizier.'

"'Behold, when a man is in his office, he acts according to what is
commanded him. \[Behold\] the success of a man is that he act according
to what is said to him. Make no \[⌈delay⌉\] at all in justice, the law
of which thou knowest. Behold, it becomes the arrogant that the king
should love the timid more than the arrogant.' <span
id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_672.md)

"'Now mayest thou do according to this command that is given thee—behold
it is the manner of ⌈success⌉ besides giving thy attention to the
⌈crown⌉-lands, and making the establishment thereof. If thou happenest
to inspect, then shalt thou send to inspect the overseer of
⌈land-measuring⌉ and the ⌈patrol of the overseer of land-measuring⌉. If
there be one who shall inspect before thee, then thou shalt question
him.'

"'\[Behold the regulation\] that is laid up\[on\] thee.'"

The chief emphasis throughout this remarkable state document is on
social justice. The vizierate is not for the purpose of showing any
preference "to princes and councillors" nor to enslave any of the
people. All justice administered shall be according to law in every
case, not forgetting that the vizier's position is a very conspicuous
one, so that all his proceedings are widely known among the people. Even
the waters and the winds report his doings to all. Nor does justice mean
that any

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

injustice shall be shown those who may be of high station, as in the
famous case of the ancient Memphite vizier Kheti, who made a decision
against his own kin in spite of the inherent merits of the case. This is
not justice. On the other hand, justice means strict impartiality,
treating without distinction, known and unknown, him who is near the
king's person and him who enjoys no connection with the royal house.
Such administration as this will secure the vizier a long tenure of
office. While the vizier must display the greatest discretion in his
wrath, he must so demean himself as to ensure public respect and even
fear, but this fear shall have its sole basis in the execution of
impartial justice; for the true "dread of a prince is that he does
justice." Hence he will not find it necessary repeatedly and
ostentatiously to excite the fear of the people, which produces a false
impression among them. The administration of justice will prove a
sufficient deterrent. Men expect justice from the vizier's office, for
justice has been its customary law since the reign of the Sun-god on
earth, and he whom they proverbially call "him who shall do justice
before all the people" is the vizier. A man's success in office depends
upon his ability to follow instructions. Therefore let there be no delay
in the dispensation of justice, remembering that the king loves the
timid and defenceless more than the arrogant. Then with a reference to
the lands which probably formed the royal fortune, and the inspection of
the officials in charge of them, the king concludes this veritable magna
charta of the poor with the words: "Behold the regulation that is laid
upon thee."

It should be noted that this programme of social kindness and justice,
in which the king loves the timid and defenceless more than the powerful
and arrogant, is distinctly

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

religious in motive. "It is an abomination of the god," says the king,
"to show partiality." Moreover, justice has been the traditional law of
the vizier's office since the time when the Sun-god ruled in Egypt. The
rule of the Pharaoh which was supposed to continue the blood and the
line of Re was likewise continuing the justice of the Sun-god's ancient
régime on earth. The king lays his mandate unequivocally upon the
vizier, but at the same time he does not hesitate to appeal to a higher
court. The vizier must do justice because the great god of the state
abhors injustice, and not solely because the king enjoins it. Twelve to
thirteen hundred years later we find the Hebrew prophets boldly
proclaiming the moral sovereignty of Jehovah as over that of the king,
but how many generations of seemingly fruitless ministry were required
before this contention of the prophets found expression in the spirit of
the Hebrew government, much less in royal pronouncements such as this of
the Feudal Age in Egypt. Was it the vision of the ideal king held up at
the court by Ipuwer, the sombre picture of the corruption of men painted
by the Misanthrope, the picturesque scene of official oppression
disclosed in the story of the Eloquent Peasant, or the conventional
tableau of father counselling son presented in the Wisdom of Ptahhotep,
which finally so enveloped the throne in an atmosphere of social justice
that the installation of the prime-minister and chief-justice of the
realm, for such the vizier was, called forth from the king a speech from
the throne, an official expression by the head of the state to its
highest executive officer, embodying the fundamental principles of
social justice? We have not been accustomed to associate such principles
of government with the early East, nor, indeed, even with the modern
Orient.

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indeed, when we
examine the Laws of Hammurabi, which date from the same age, we find the
administration of justice conditioned by clear recognition of social
classes. For the same crime the penalty and the damages vary according
to the social class of the individuals involved. In the Installation of
the Egyptian vizier such distinctions are obliterated and all are to be
treated alike. When Plato in his essay on Politics made the State the
organized embodiment of justice, he probably little knew that fifteen
hundred years earlier Egypt had adopted this ideal and endeavored to
make it reality; or is this another evidence that Plato had been in
Egypt, and an idea which he appropriated there?

The influence of such lofty ideals of social justice, which thus found
the highest expression in government, was no doubt in large measure due
to the form in which they circulated among all classes. Such doctrines,
had they been enunciated as abstract principles, would have attracted
little attention and exerted little or no influence. The Egyptian,
however, always thought in concrete terms and in graphic forms. He
thought not of theft but of a thief, not of love but of a lover, not of
poverty but of a poor man: he sees not social corruption but a corrupt
society. Hence the Misanthrope, a *man* in whom social injustice found
expression in the picture of a despairing soul who tells of his despair
and its causes; hence Ipuwer, a *man* in whom dwelt the vision to
discern both the deadly corruption of society and the golden dream of an
ideal king restoring all; hence the Eloquent Peasant, a *man* suffering
official oppression and crying out against it; hence Ptahhotep, a *man*
meeting the obligations of office with wholesome faith in righteous
conduct and just administration to engender happiness, and passing on
this

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

experience to his son; hence even the Instruction of Amenemhet, a *king*
suffering shameful treachery, losing faith in men and likewise
communicating his experience to his son. The result is that the
doctrines of these social thinkers were placed in a dramatic setting,
and the doctrines themselves find expression in dialogue growing out of
experiences and incidents represented as actual. In the East, and
doubtless everywhere, such teachings, we repeat, make the most universal
and the most powerful appeal in this form. It was the form into which
the problem of suffering, as graphically exemplified in the story of
Job, most naturally fell. The Story of Akhikar, recently recovered in
its ancient Aramaic form, is unquestionably a discourse on the folly of
ingratitude which belongs in the same class; while the most beautiful of
all such tales, the parables of Jesus, adopt the method and the form for
ages current in the East. When Plato wished to discourse on the
immortality of the soul, he assumed as his dramatic setting the death of
Socrates, and the doctrines which he wished to set forth took the form
of conversation between Socrates and his friends. <span
id="fr_673"></span>[1](#fn_673.md) It is hardly conceivable that this
method of moralizing and philosophizing in dialogue after an
introduction which throws the whole essentially into the form of a tale,
a method which produced so many documents in Egypt, had no influence on
the emergence of the dialogue form in Asia and Europe. It is not likely
that the form originated independently among the Aramæans, Hebrews, and
Greeks. The wide international circulation of the Akhikar tale, as we
have said before, demonstrates how such literary products could travel,
and it is perhaps significant that the

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

oldest form of the Akhikar tale was found in Egypt. In any case it is
evident that the form of the teachings of these early social thinkers
and reformers contributed much to give them a wide and powerful
influence, an influence which finally reached the throne itself, as we
have seen.

While we are, unhappily, unable to trace further the influence of these
men in the practical legislation of this age, for the laws of Egypt have
perished, the pervading power of their teaching is evident in the
mortuary inscriptions of the period. We leave the court and journey to
the provinces and baronies, where we find on the tomb door of such a
baron as Ameni of Benihasan the following account of his administrative
policy as lord of a barony:

"There was no citizen's daughter whom I misused, there was no widow whom
I afflicted, there was no peasant whom I repulsed (evicted?), there was
no herdman whom I repelled, there was no overseer of five whose people I
took away for (unpaid) taxes. There was none wretched in my community,
there was none hungry in my time. When years of famine came, I ploughed
all the fields of the Oryx barony (his estate) as far as its southern
and its northern boundary, preserving its people alive, furnishing its
food so that there was none hungry therein. I gave to the widow as (to)
her who had a husband. I did not exalt the great (man) above the small
(man) in anything that I gave. Then came great Niles (inundations),
possessors of grain and all things, (but) I did not collect the arrears
of the field." <span id="fr_674"></span>[1](#fn_674.md)

In this record we seem to hear an echo of the Installation of the
Vizier, especially in the statement, "I did not exalt the great man
above the small man in anything

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

that I gave." It is easy to believe that such a baron as this had been
present at court and had heard the instructions of the Pharaoh at the
vizier's inauguration. If the administration of Ameni was in any measure
what he claims for it, we must conclude that the social teachings of the
wise at the court were widely known among the great throughout the
kingdom. Even though we may conclude that he has idealized his rule to a
large extent, we have still to account for his desire to create such an
impression as we gain from his biography. It is evident that the ideals
of social justice, so insistently set forth in the literature of the
age, had not only reached the king, but they had also exerted a profound
influence among the ruling class everywhere.

Herein, then, we may discern a great transformation. The pessimism with
which the men of the early Feudal Age, <span
id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_675.md) as they beheld the desolated cemeteries
of the Pyramid Age, or as they contemplated the hereafter, and the
hopelessness with which some of them regarded the earthly life were met
by a persistent counter-current in the dominant gospel of righteousness
and social justice set forth in the hopeful philosophy of more
optimistic social thinkers, men who saw hope in positive effort toward
better conditions. We must regard the Admonitions of Ipuwer and the Tale
of the Eloquent Peasant as striking examples of such efforts, and we
must recognize in their writings the weapons of the earliest known group
of moral and social crusaders. What more could such a man as Ipuwer have
wished than the address delivered by the king at the installation of the
vizier? A

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

king capable of delivering such an address approaches the stature of
that ideal king of whom Ipuwer dreamed.

There can be no doubt that that ideal king was Re, the moral glories of
whose reign were to be renewed in his Pharaonic representative on earth.
It is to the approval and to the traditional character of the reign of
the Sun-god that the king appealed as the final basis for his
instruction to the vizier. It is Re who is dominant in the thinking of
these social philosophers of the Feudal Age. In the Song of the Harper
even the mummy of the dead is set up before Re. It is to Re that the
Misanthrope looks for justification in the hereafter, and
Khekheperre-sonbu was a priest of the Sun-city of Heliopolis. Ipuwer's
vision of the future ideal king emerges from reminiscence of the
blessedness of Re's earthly reign among men; while the summary of the
whole appeal of the Eloquent Peasant is contained in "that good word
which came out of the mouth of Re himself: 'Speak truth, do truth (or
"righteousness"), for it is great, it is mighty, it is enduring." The
moral obligations emerging in the Solar theology thus wrought the
earliest social regeneration and won the earliest battle for social
justice of which we know anything in history. It is evident here also,
as in the Pyramid Texts, that the connection of Osiris with ideals of
righteousness and justice is secondary. He was tried and found innocent
in the great hall at Heliopolis, that is before the *Solar* bar of
justice, recognized, at the time when the Osiris myth was forming, as
the tribunal before which he must secure acquittal, and his later
exaltation as judge is but the Solarization of the Osirian functions on
the basis of the Solar judgeship so common in the Pyramid Texts. In the
Pyramid Texts, Osiris had already climbed upon the celestial throne of

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Re; we shall see
him now also appropriating Re's judgment-seat. <span
id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_676.md)

We discern the Egyptians, then, developing at a surprisingly early date
a sense of the moral unworthiness of man and a consciousness of
deep-seated moral obligation to which he has been largely untrue. Their
beginnings lie too far back to be discernible, but as they developed
they found practical expression in the idealized kingship whence they
were quickly reflected into the character and the activities of Re, the
ideal king. The moral obligation which men felt within them became a
fiat of the god, their own abomination of injustice soon became that of
the god, and their own moral ideals, thus becoming likewise those of the
god, gained a new mandatory power. The idealized kingship of Re, the
possible recurrence of such a beneficent rule, brought with it golden
visions of a Messianic kingdom. Furthermore, Re became the great moral
arbiter before whom all might receive justice. Even Osiris had thus been
subjected to the moral ordeal before the Sun-god in his great hall of
justice at Heliopolis, as the Osirian myth narrates. It is not necessary
to deny to early Osirian belief some ethical content, of which we found
indications likewise in the local faiths of a number of Egyptian gods of
the Pyramid Age; but here again it should not be forgotten that the
Pyramid Texts have preserved traces of a view of Osiris which, far from
making him the ideal king and the friend of man, discloses him as an
enemy of the dead and hostile to men. <span
id="fr_677"></span>[2](#fn_677.md) It is not until the Feudal Age that

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Osiris
unmistakably emerges as the champion of righteousness. Ptahhotep, with
the complaisant optimism which characterizes his maxims, avers that
righteousness has not been "disturbed since the time of Osiris," meaning
the time when Osiris ruled on earth as a righteous king. <span
id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_678.md) While the political triumph of Re
largely created the religious atmosphere which environed these social
philosophers of the court, we shall now observe Osiris and Re, side by
side, in the moral thinking of the age.

It was now not only religious belief and social axiom, but also formally
announced royal policy, that before the bar of justice the great and the
powerful must expect the same treatment and the same verdict accorded to
the poor and the friendless. It is not the province of these lectures to
discover to what extent practical administration made these ideals
effective. That is a matter of history for the investigation of which
the materials are unhappily very scanty. Later conditions would indicate
that the ideal remained largely unrealized. It can hardly be doubted,
however, that such doctrines of social justice as we have found in this
age contributed powerfully to develop the conviction that not the man of
power and wealth, but the man of justice and righteousness, would be
acceptable before the great god's judgment-seat. Here then ends the
special and peculiar claim of the great and powerful to consideration
and to felicity in the hereafter, and the democratization of blessedness
beyond the grave begins. The friendless peasant pleading with the grand
steward says to him, "Beware! Eternity approaches." Ameni, the great
lord of Benihasan, sets forth upon his tomb door, as we have seen, the
record of social justice in his treatment of all as the best passport he
can devise

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

for the long journey. Over and over again the men of the Feudal Age
reiterate in their tombs their claims to righteousness of character.
"Sesenebnef has done righteousness, his abomination was evil, he saw it
not," <span id="fr_679"></span>[1](#fn_679.md) says an official of the time
on his sarcophagus. The mortuary texts which fill the cedar coffins of
this age <span id="fr_680"></span>[2](#fn_680.md) show clearly that the
consciousness of moral responsibility in the hereafter has greatly
deepened since the Pyramid Age. The balances of justice to which the
peasant appealed so often and so dramatically are now really finding
place in the drama of justification hereafter. "The doors of the sky are
opened to thy beauty," says one to the deceased; "thou ascendest, thou
seest Hathor. Thy evil is expelled, thy iniquity is wiped away, by those
who weigh with the balances on the day of reckoning." <span
id="fr_681"></span>[3](#fn_681.md) Just as the peasant so often called the
grand steward the balances of justice, so the deceased may be possessed
of character as true and unswerving as the scales themselves. Hence we
find the Coffin Texts saying, "Lo, this —— (name of the deceased) is the
balances of Re, wherewith he weighs truth" (or righteousness). <span
id="fr_682"></span>[4](#fn_682.md) It is evident also whose are the
balances of truth and who the judge who presides over them. It is as
before the Sun-god, before whom even Osiris had been tried. A similar
connection of the judgment with Re places it in the cabin of the Solar
barque. <span id="fr_683"></span>[5](#fn_683.md)

The moral requirement of the great judge has become a matter of course.
The dead says: "I have led the way before him and behind him. He loves
righteousness and hates evil, upon his favorite ways of righteousness
whereon

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

the gods lead." <span id="fr_684"></span>[1](#fn_684.md) When the dead man
entered those righteous paths of the gods, it was with a sense of moral
unworthiness left behind. "My sin is expelled," he said, "my iniquity is
removed. I have cleansed myself in those two great pools which are in
Heracleopolis." <span id="fr_685"></span>[2](#fn_685.md) Those ceremonial
washings which were so common in the Pyramid Texts have now become
distinctly moral in their significance. "I go upon the way where I wash
my head in the Lake of Righteousness," says the dead man. <span
id="fr_686"></span>[3](#fn_686.md) Again and very often the deceased claims
that his life has been blameless: "I am one who loved righteousness, my
abomination was evil." <span id="fr_687"></span>[4](#fn_687.md) "I sit down
justified, I rise up justified." <span id="fr_688"></span>[5](#fn_688.md)
"I have established righteousness, I have expelled evil." <span
id="fr_689"></span>[6](#fn_689.md) "I am a lord of offering, my abomination
is evil." <span id="fr_690"></span>[7](#fn_690.md)

A number of times the Osirian Horus appears as the moral champion of the
dead, to whom he says: "I am thy son Horus, I have caused that thou be
justified in the council." <span id="fr_691"></span>[8](#fn_691.md) This of
course means the identification of the dead with Osiris, and the
enjoyment of the same justification which had been granted Osiris. Hence
Horus says to the dead: "O Osiris X! I have given to thee justification
against thy enemies on this good day." <span
id="fr_692"></span>[9](#fn_692.md) This justification was of course not
that granted by Osiris, but by the Sun-god, as shown by such utterances
of Horus as this: "I put righteousness before him (the deceased) like
Atum" (the Sun-god). <span id="fr_693"></span>[10](#fn_693.md) Now, the
justification before the Sun-god was accomplished by Thoth, as advocate
of the

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

accused, Thoth having been, according to the Solar myth, the vizier of
the Sun-god. Hence we find in the Coffin Texts a "Chapter of
Justification before Thoth, Hereditary Prince of the Gods," although the
text of the chapter unfortunately consists of mortuary ceremonies on
behalf of Osiris, and makes but one reference to justification in
mentioning "the beautiful paths of justification." <span
id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_694.md) In the justification of Osiris himself,
Thoth had figured as his defender, and the justification in the
foregoing chapter is probably Osirian, though it does not unequivocally
make Osiris the judge. The ethical significance of Osiris is evident in
a passage where the deceased, identified with Osiris, says: "I perish
not, I enter as truth, I \[support\] truth, I am lord of truth, I go
forth as truth, . . . I enter in as truth"; <span
id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_695.md) or again where Osiris says: "I am
Osiris, the god who does righteousness, I live in it." <span
id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_696.md)

But Osiris early discloses himself as the judge. We hear in the Coffin
Texts of "the Great Council (or court of justice) of Osiris" as early as
the Ninth or Tenth Dynasty (twenty-fourth to twenty-second
centuries). <span id="fr_697"></span>[4](#fn_697.md) In the same text the
dead (or possibly Horus) says: "I have commanded those who are in the
Great Council in the cavern of Osiris; I have repeated it in the
presence of Mat (Goddess of Truth), to cause that I prevail over that
foe." <span id="fr_698"></span>[5](#fn_698.md) It is perhaps this council
that is meant when the dead is assured, "Thou art justified on the day
when judgment is rendered in the council of the Lord of Gem-wet,"
although I am not certain that Osiris was the Lord of Gemwet. <span
id="fr_699"></span>[6](#fn_699.md) According to another notion there were
seven of these "councils" or courts of Osiris, and we find a

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

prayer that the soul of the deceased may be justified "against his
enemies in the sky, in the earth, and in these seven councils of
Osiris." <span id="fr_700"></span>[1](#fn_700.md) Doubtless the popularity
of Osiris had much to do with the spread of the conviction, now
universal, that *every* soul must meet this ethical ordeal in the
hereafter. It now became, or let us say that at the advent of the Middle
Kingdom it had become, the custom to append to the name of every
deceased person the epithet "justified."

In the Pyramid Texts this epithet had been received only by the Pharaoh,
for *royal* Osirianism identified the king with the justified Osiris and
prefixed "Osiris" to the king's name. A new element now entered the old
*popular* Osirianism, and the process which was democratizing the
splendid royal hereafter now began to identify every dead man with
Osiris, so that he not only as of old entered the kingdom of Osiris to
enjoy the god's protection and favor, but he now *became* Osiris and was
conceived as king. Even in burials of simple folk, the mummy was
fashioned and laid on the back like that of Osiris, and amulets
representing the royal insignia of the Pharaoh were painted on the
inside of the coffin or laid beside the body. <span
id="fr_701"></span>[2](#fn_701.md) The popular power of the ancient god is
evident in the new custom of prefixing the name of Osiris to that of the
dead man. He might be and was frequently identified with the Sun-god
too, but as a departed spirit it was by the name of Osiris that he was
designated.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_622"></span>[199:1](rtae11.htm#fr_622.md) British Museum,
5645. Although long exhibited, its content was first discerned and
published by <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span>, in his
*Admonitions of an Egyptian Sage*, as an Appendix, pp. 95–112 and pls.
17–18. The above rendering is chiefly that of <span
class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span>.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[200:1](rtae11.htm#fr_623.md) Literally "body" or
"belly," the seat of mind.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[202:1](rtae11.htm#fr_624.md) The text is
preserved in seven corrupt hieratic manuscripts of the Empire dating
from the age near the end of the reign of Ramses II. The latest and best
treatment and text are by <span class="smallcaps">Griffith</span>
(*Zeitschr. für aegyptische Sprache*, 34, 35–49). An excellent
translation of the clearer passages by <span
class="smallcaps">Erman</span> in *Aus den Papyrus des koeniglichen
Museums zu Berlin*, 44–45. The above version is indebted to both; see
BAR, I, 474–483. For the old bibliography see <span
class="smallcaps">Maspero</span>, *Dawn of Civilization*, 467, n. 2.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[204:1](rtae11.htm#fr_625.md) So <span
class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span>. A papyrus in the Leiden Museum, No.
344. It is 378 centimetres long and 18 centimetres high, and contains
seventeen pages of writing. Although early published by <span
class="smallcaps">Leemans</span> in his *Aegyptische Monumenten* (pls.
cv–cxiii), it is in such a bad state of preservation, and is furthermore
so obscure and difficult in language and subject-matter, that it
resisted the attempts of scholars to determine its content until 1903,
when H. O. <span class="smallcaps">Lange</span> published a sketch of
the document, with selected translations, showing it to be a
socio-prophetic tractate: *Prophezeiungen eines aegyptischen Weisen*, in
*Sitzungsber. der Kgl. Preuss. Akad.*, 1903, 601 *ff*. In 1909 the
papyrus was published *in extenso*, in what will remain the standard
edition, by <span class="smallcaps">Alan H. Gardiner</span> (The
*Admonitions of an Egyptian Sage*, Leipzig, 1909), with fuller
discussion and closer determination of the exact character of the
document.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[205:1](rtae11.htm#fr_626.md) The above
translations are chiefly those of <span
class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span>, who has been commendably cautious in
his renderings. Besides his own thorough work on the document, he has
incorporated the proverbially penetrating observations and renderings of
<span class="smallcaps">Sethe</span>.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[205:2](rtae11.htm#fr_627.md) This was
particularly heinous from the orderly Egyptian's point of view; the
withdrawing of writings and records from the public offices for purposes
of evidence or consultation was carefully regulated. The regulations
governing the vizier's office have survived; see BAR, II, 684.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[207:1](rtae11.htm#fr_628.md) Three sorts of wood
follow.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[207:2](rtae11.htm#fr_629.md) Vocalize Kaftoyew,
Caphtor (as first suggested by <span
class="smallcaps">Spiegelberg</span>), that is Crete.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[207:3](rtae11.htm#fr_630.md) This last remark is
of course ironical in reference to the fact that the only traffic with
the outside world left to Egypt is the scanty produce of the oases which
still filters in.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[209:1](rtae11.htm#fr_631.md) The restoration of
"righteousness" is due to <span class="smallcaps">Sethe</span>, and in
view of its frequent occurrence, as the opposite of the word here used
as "inquity" (ysft), from the Pyramid Texts on, the restoration fits the
context admirably, but <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span> states
that the traces in the lacuna do not favor the restoration. The original
hieratic of the passage is not included in his publication.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[211:1](rtae11.htm#fr_632.md) Latter part of [p.
11](rtae05.htm#page_11.md).

<span id="fn_633"></span>[211:2](rtae11.htm#fr_633.md) Or "herdman." The
Sun-god is called "a valiant herdman who drives his cattle" in a
Sun-hymn of the Eighteenth Dynasty (see below, [p.
316](rtae13.htm#page_316).md), and this, it seems to me, makes quite
certain <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner's</span> conclusion (on other
grounds) that this passage is a description of the reign of Re.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[211:3](rtae11.htm#fr_634.md) This probably means
thirsty, perhaps a symbol for afflicted. Compare the hearts of the
cattle "weeping" above, [p. 209](#page_209.md).

<span id="fn_635"></span>[212:1](rtae11.htm#fr_635.md) <span
class="smallcaps">Lange</span> first called attention to the Messianic
character of this passage. His interpretation, however, was that the
passage definitely *predicts* the coming of the Messianic king. <span
class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span> has successfully opposed <span
class="smallcaps">Lange's</span> conclusion as far as *prediction* is
concerned, and by his full and careful commentary has contributed much
to our understanding of the passage. But no student of Hebrew prophecy
can follow <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span> in his next step,
viz., that by the elimination of the predictive element we deprive the
document of its prophetic character. This is simply to import a modern
English meaning of the word prophecy as prediction into the
interpretation of these ancient documents, particularly Hebrew
literature. <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner's</span> final conclusion
is: "I must once more affirm that there is no certain or even likely
trace of prophecies in any part of this book" (*Admonitions*, p. 17). In
the same paragraph he states the "specific problem" of the document to
be "the conditions of social and political well-being." This is, of
course, the leading theme of Hebrew prophecy. On the basis of any
sufficient definition of Hebrew prophecy, including the contemplation of
social and political evils, and admonitions for their amelioration, the
utterances of <span id="page_213">p. 213</span> Ipuwer are prophecy
throughout (see *infra*, [p. 215](#page_215).md). With reference to the
"Messianic" passage above, its Messianic character does not in the
slightest depend upon its *predictive* character. <span
class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span> is surely right (against <span
class="smallcaps">Lange</span>) in making the long arraignment not
prediction, but a description of actually existent conditions. The
admonitions which follow, however, definitely look to the future, in
which the sage expects the people to carry out his injunctions. The
"Messianic" passage follows directly upon these admonitions, and itself
is followed by a rebuke to the king merging into a picture which, in
<span class="smallcaps">Gardiner's</span> words, describes "the joy and
prosperity of the land in a happier age" (*ibid.*, p. 87). Indeed in
<span class="smallcaps">Gardiner's</span> own opinion the "Messianic"
passage concludes with a "return to a consideration of the future
prospects of Egypt," so that at the end "we touch firm ground in three
sentences that clearly refer to the looked-for (but not necessarily
prophesied) redeemer: 'Where is he to-day? Doth he sleep perchance?
Behold ye, his might is not seen'" (*ibid.*, p. 80). The parenthesis is
<span class="smallcaps">Gardiner's</span>, and what he means is, of
course, that the "redeemer" is looked for, but not necessarily
*predicted*. It is solely this entirely insufficient conception of
Hebrew prophecy as "prediction" which eventuates in <span
class="smallcaps">Gardiner's</span> conclusion, "that there is too much
uncertainty about the matter for it to be made the basis of any
far-reaching conclusions as to the influence of Egyptian upon Hebrew
literature" (*ibid.*, p. 15). The "uncertainty," <span id="page_214">p.
214</span> as <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span> here specifies it,
concerns solely <span class="smallcaps">Lange's</span> interpretation of
the "Messianic" passage as predictive; though even, according to <span
class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span>, the latter part of the "Messianic"
passage looks forward to a "redeemer" yet to come. The Messianic vision
with the Hebrew prophets was often but a great hope, sometimes rising to
conviction that the hope would be realized. It was a vision toward the
realization of which they desired to contribute. It was but an early
form of social idealism, which evidently began (so far as we know) in
Egypt, and emerged in lofty form among the Hebrews also. A unique
detachment and capacity to contemplate society, emerging for the first
time in history in the Feudal Age in Egypt, produced these social
tractates above discussed. If the story of the Two Brothers, after
centuries of circulation in Egypt, reached Palestine to find embodiment
in the tale of Joseph, it is more than possible that the pamphlets of
Ipuwer and the men of his class similarly entered Palestine and
suggested to the idealists of Israel the conception of the righteous
king and redeemer. I ought, perhaps, to add that in a letter to me <span
class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span> disclaims regarding prediction as
constituting "prophecy," but I have had to deal with his argument as I
found it in his admirable volume.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[213:1](rtae11.htm#fr_636.md) The similarity was
noticed by <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span>.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[216:1](rtae11.htm#fr_637.md) The tale of the
Eloquent Peasant is preserved in six papyri, three of which are now in
the Berlin Museum (P. 10499, P. 3023, P. 3025); one in the British
Museum (Papyrus Butler 527, Brit. Mus., No. <span id="page_217">p.
217</span> 10274, *recto*, containing only forty lines); and two in the
Amherst collection (consisting of fragments belonging to Berlin, P. 3023
and P. 3025). The Berlin papyri, P. 3023 and P. 3025, were published by
<span class="smallcaps">Lepsius</span>, *Denkmaeler*, VI, 108–110. A
final standard publication, including all three of the Berlin papyri,
was issued by the Berlin Museum in 1908 (*Die Klagen des Bauern*,
bearbeitet von <span class="smallcaps">F. Vogelsang</span> and <span
class="smallcaps">Alan H. Gardiner</span>, Leipzig, 1908). It contains a
careful translation. See also <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span>,
*Eine neue Handschrift des Sinuhegedichtes* (*Sitzungsber. der Kgl.
Preuss. Akad.*, 1907, p. 142), on the discovery of Berlin P. 10499.
Papyrus Butler was published by <span class="smallcaps">Griffith</span>
in *Proceedings of the Soc. of Bibl. Arch.*, XIV, 1892, pp. 451 *ff*.
The Amherst fragments were published by <span
class="smallcaps">Newberry</span> in *The Amherst Papyri*, London, 1899.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[217:1](rtae11.htm#fr_638.md) This name was
formerly read "Meruitensi." The proper reading, "Rensi," was established
by <span class="smallcaps">Sethe</span>, *Zeitschr. für aegypt.
Sprache*, 49, 95 *ff*.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[220:1](rtae11.htm#fr_639.md) In the older Berlin
papyrus the conclusion reads: "Count me (or 'prove me'), lo, I am few."

<span id="fn_640"></span>[221:1](rtae11.htm#fr_640.md) It is a comparison
which the great nobles of the Feudal Age were fond of using on their
tomb stem; *e.g.*, BAR, I, 745, 531.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[222:1](rtae11.htm#fr_641.md) Berlin, P. 3023, l.
95.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[222:2](rtae11.htm#fr_642.md) *Ibid.*, ll. 234–8.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[223:1](rtae11.htm#fr_643.md) *Ibid.*, ll. 240–8.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[223:2](rtae11.htm#fr_644.md) *Ibid.*, ll. 260–5 =
Berlin, P. 3025, ll. 14–20.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[223:3](rtae11.htm#fr_645.md) *Ibid.*, ll. 267–8.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[224:1](rtae11.htm#fr_646.md) *Ibid.*, ll. 285–8.
The negative has been omitted by the scribe in the second half (the
relative clause) of each one of these sentences. This is doubtless due
to the customary confusion in many languages in sentences where two
negatives occur.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[224:2](rtae11.htm#fr_647.md) *Ibid*., ll. 292–8.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[224:3](rtae11.htm#fr_648.md) God of writing and
legal procedure.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[225:1](rtae11.htm#fr_649.md) In such an utterance
as this it is important to remember that "truth" is always the same word
which the Egyptian employs for "right, righteousness, justice,"
according to the connection in which it is used. In such an injunction
as this we cannot distinguish any particular one of these concepts to
the exclusion of the rest.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[225:2](rtae11.htm#fr_650.md) *Ibid.*, ll.
307–322. The word rendered "blessedness hereafter" means "reverence,"
the state of the revered dead.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[225:3](rtae11.htm#fr_651.md) The same words are
used regarding the vizier's wisdom in Pap. Prisse (2, 6–7). See below,
[p. 228](#page_228.md).

<span id="fn_652"></span>[226:1](rtae11.htm#fr_652.md) The Wisdom of
Ptahhotep is preserved in five manuscripts: (1) the Papyrus Prisse in
the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris, Nos. 183194; (2) the three papyri in
the British Museum, Nos. 10371, 10435, and 10509; a wooden
writing-tablet, or board, in the Cairo Museum, known as the Tablette
Carnarvon, No. 41790. The Papyrus Prisse was published by the owner,
<span class="smallcaps">E. Prisse D’Avennes</span> (*Fac-similé d’un*
<span id="page_227">p. 227</span> *papyrus égyptien*, Paris, 1847). It
was republished, together with all the other manuscripts (except B. M.,
10509), by <span class="smallcaps">G. Jéquier</span> (*Le Papyrus
Prisse, et ses variantes*, Paris, 1911). The Carnarvon tablet was
published in transcription, with discussion of its relation to the
Papyrus Prisse by <span class="smallcaps">Maspero</span>, in Recueil de
travaux, XXXI, 146–153, and afterward by the <span
class="smallcaps">Earl of Carnarvon</span> in his beautiful volume,
*Five Years' Excavations at Thebes*, Oxford Univ. Press, 1912 (discussed
by <span class="smallcaps">Griffith</span>, pp. 36–37, and reproduced
pl. xxvii). The five columns contained in Brit. Mus. Pap., No. 10509,
were published by <span class="smallcaps">Budge</span>, *Fac-similes of
Egyptian Hieratic Papyri in the British Museum*, London, 1910, pls.
xxxiv-xxxviii, pp. xvii-xxi. This reached me too late to be employed
above. Like the other Wisdom literature, or semi-philosophical tractates
discussed above, Papyrus Prisse is excessively difficult. The old
translations, as their divergences from each other show, are too
conjectural to be used with safety. An exhaustive study on the basis of
modern grammatical knowledge would undoubtedly render much of it
intelligible, although a large proportion of it is too obscure and too
corrupt in text ever to be translated with certainty.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[228:1](rtae11.htm#fr_653.md) On the rendering,
see <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span>, *Admonitions*, p. 107, n.
1.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[228:2](rtae11.htm#fr_654.md) The same statement
is made regarding the roll containing the speeches of the Eloquent
Peasant. See above, [p. 225](#page_225.md).

<span id="fn_655"></span>[228:3](rtae11.htm#fr_655.md) Papyrus Prisse, pp.
1 and 2.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[228:4](rtae11.htm#fr_656.md) This vizier,
Kegemne, was also a famous wise man.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[229:1](rtae11.htm#fr_657.md) Literally "old man's
staff," which is a technical term for son and heir or successor. See
BAR, I, 692, and <span class="smallcaps">Griffith</span> in the notes on
*Bersheh*, I, pl. xxxiii. What is meant is, that the vizier, as the
narrative shows, desires to be commanded to instruct his son as his
successor.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[231:1](rtae11.htm#fr_658.md) The Carnarvon Tablet
ends here. It furnishes some valuable variants which have been
incorporated above.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[231:2](rtae11.htm#fr_659.md) We very much need an
exhaustive treatment of the text, with careful word studies such as
<span class="smallcaps">Gardiner</span> has prepared for the
*Admonitions of Ipuwer*. The summary offered above makes no pretension
to rest upon any such study of the text, but perhaps presents enough for
the purposes of this volume. See also <span
class="smallcaps">Griffith</span>, in Warner's *Library of the World's
Best Literature*.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[231:3](rtae11.htm#fr_660.md) These references
include the entire paragraph in each case. All refer to Pap. Prisse.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[232:1](rtae11.htm#fr_661.md) The word really
means "to shoot."

<span id="fn_662"></span>[234:1](rtae11.htm#fr_662.md) Mohammed makes
essentially the same remark in the Koran.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[234:2](rtae11.htm#fr_663.md) "In his time" is
seemingly an idiom for some particular mood. See also paragraphs 1–3
above.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[237:1](rtae11.htm#fr_664.md) This is the end of
the original, for the scribe's docket in red follows, reading as usual:
"It is finished from its beginning to its end according to what was
found in writing" (19, 9).

<span id="fn_665"></span>[238:1](rtae11.htm#fr_665.md) We may divide the
paragraphs as numbered above roughly as follows:

Personal character and conduct, paragraphs 1–3, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 17,
18, 19, 22, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41. Total, 23
paragraphs.

Administration and official conduct: 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 14, 15, 16, 21, 23,

<span id="fn_666"></span>[239:1](rtae11.htm#fr_666.md) This document has
survived in three different copies, each a hieroglyphic wall
inscription, in three different tombs of the Eighteenth Dynasty at
Thebes. The best preserved and most important of the three is in the
tomb of Rekhmire, vizier under Thutmose III (1501–1447 B.C.). The other
two copies are in the tomb of Woser, uncle and predecessor of Rekhmire,
and the tomb of Hapu, vizier under Thutmose IV (1420–1411 B.C.). These
two are little more than fragments. The inscription was published, on
the basis of the Rekhmire text, by <span
class="smallcaps">Newberry</span>, who first discovered it (*The Life of
Rekhmara*, London, 1900, pls. ix–x). <span
class="smallcaps">Newberry</span> placed the materials from the tombs of
Woser and Hapu at <span class="smallcaps">Gardiner's</span> disposal,
who then re-edited the text with excellent commentary and translation
(the *Installation of a Vizier*, *Recueil de travaux*, XXVI, 1–19). The
document is exceedingly difficult in language and still shows serious
lacunæ. Further study was given it by <span
class="smallcaps">Sethe</span>, who re-edited the text in his *Urkunden*
(IX, 1086 *ff*.). He secured successive collations of all the originals
from <span class="smallcaps">Davies</span>, and published a final and
much improved text with full commentary and translation (*Die Einsetzung
des Veziers unter der* 18. *Dynastie*, Leipzig, 1909, in *Untersuchungen
zur Geschichte and Altertumskunde Aegyptens*, V, 2). The above
translation is an adaptation of <span class="smallcaps">Sethe</span>,
and should be used in place of my former translation in my *Ancient
Records* (II, 665–670). While all the texts date from the fifteenth
century B.C., the reasons for placing the document in the Middle
Kingdom, at least several centuries earlier, seem to me conclusive. The
document refers to a precedent from the Pyramid Age (Old Kingdom), and
it is in spirit and thought closely related to the social documents of
the Feudal Age above discussed. Employing the canons of historical
criticism current elsewhere, if this document had not borne a date, it
would <span id="page_240">p. 240</span> have been placed in the Middle
Kingdom by any unbiassed critic. It shows particularly close affinity to
the Wisdom of Ptahhotep (Papyrus Prisse), duplicating not a few of its
ideas, and even employing also the same form in some cases. For example
regarding proper and kind treatment of a petitioner the two texts say:

"A petitioner desires that his utterance be regarded rather than the
hearing of that on account of which he has come" (Installation, l. 17).

"He who is suffering wrong desires that his heart be cheered to do that
on account of which he has come" (Wisdom of Ptahhotep, Prisse 9, 5; see
paragraph 16, above).

There is not space here to array the parallel materials, but I hope to
do this elsewhere in a special study. I may call attention to Prisse 11,
12–13, and 10, 6–7 as containing doctrines identical with those in the
Installation. Perhaps the most conclusive evidence is the social policy
of Ameni ("I did not exalt the great above the small"), almost an
epitome of the Installation address, and of unquestionable Middle
Kingdom date.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[240:1](rtae11.htm#fr_667.md) Here of course was
the name of the vizier, varying from incumbent to incumbent.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[240:2](rtae11.htm#fr_668.md) The meaning of
course is that the vizier is to be loyal to his lord, the king, to whose
house he is attached.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[241:1](rtae11.htm#fr_669.md) That is, an officer
belonging to the staff of the vizier who has heard the matters reported
at second hand, lest misunderstanding should result, when the vizier
handles or acts on cases from another court.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[241:2](rtae11.htm#fr_670.md) Compare <span
class="smallcaps">Prisse</span>, 7, 9.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[242:1](rtae11.htm#fr_671.md) Meaning either what
is said and thus proven by witnesses, or what should not be said,
impropriety of speech.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[243:1](rtae11.htm#fr_672.md) The same contrast
between the "timid" and the "arrogant" or "violent-hearted" is found in
Ipuwer (11, 13), and is another connection between the Installation and
the Feudal Age documents.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[247:1](rtae11.htm#fr_673.md) The analogy of the
Platonic dialogues was noticed by <span

<span id="fn_675"></span>[249:1](rtae11.htm#fr_675.md) Such views are dated
with considerable precision early in the Twelfth Dynasty by the
Instruction of Amenemhet, the first king of the dynasty.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[251:1](rtae11.htm#fr_676.md) The Heliopolitan
trial of Osiris is in itself enough to dispose of the extraordinary
contention of <span class="smallcaps">Budge</span> (in his two volumes
on Osiris) that the Sun-god is a secondary phenomenon of foreign origin,
imported into Egypt after the supremacy of the Osirian faith was
established.

justification is probably a magical formula. It is repeatedly addressed
to the personified parts—rudder, mast, sail, etc.—of the sacred Osiris
barque at Abydos, each being adjured to "justify" the soul of the
deceased. (*Cf*. forty-eight names of a barque in <span
class="smallcaps">Lacau</span>, XXVII, *Rec*., 30, 65 *ff*., and Book of
the Dead, xcix.) It is possible that "justify" implies little of ethical
content here, and that it may be chiefly legal. On the use of
"justified" as a juristic verdict, see <span
