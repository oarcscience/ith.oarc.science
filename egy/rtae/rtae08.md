### LECTURE IV

#### REALMS OF THE DEAD—THE EARLIEST CELESTIAL HEREAFTER

WE have followed the royal pilgrim as he passed through the celestial
gates, where he awaited announcement of his arrival to the Sun-god, in
whose realm he must now abide. We behold his heralds hastening to
announce his advent. "Thy messengers go, thy swift messengers run, thy
heralds make haste. They announce to Re that thou hast come, (even) this
king Pepi." <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_385) We hear their message
as they shout, "'Behold, he comes! Behold, he comes!' says Sehpu. Behold
the son of Re comes, the beloved of Re comes,' says Sehpu, 'who was made
to come by Horus.'" <span id="fr_386"></span>[2](#fn_386) The gods crowd
down to the shore. "This king Pepi found the gods standing, wrapped in
their garments, their white sandals on their feet. They cast off their
white sandals to the earth, they throw off their garments. 'Our heart
was not glad until thy coming,' say they." <span
id="fr_387"></span>[3](#fn_387) Again they are overcome with awe as they
hear the proclamation of the heralds and behold the king approaching. Re
stands before the gates of the horizon leaning upon his sceptre, while
the gods are grouped about him. "The

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

gods are silent before thee, the Nine Gods have laid their hands upon
their mouths," says the herald voice. <span
id="fr_388"></span>[1](#fn_388)

It may be, however, that the king finds himself without any messenger to
despatch to Re, and in this case the ferryman may be induced to announce
his coming. <span id="fr_389"></span>[2](#fn_389) Otherwise, as he
approaches the gate the gate-keeper is called upon to perform this
office. "Ho, Methen! Keeper of the great gate! Announce this king Pepi
to these two great gods" (Re and Horus). <span
id="fr_390"></span>[3](#fn_390) He may even be obliged to intrust his
case to the good offices of Re's body servant, affording an interesting
side-light on the possible methods of gaining the royal ear in this
distant age. "O ye who are over the offering and the libation! Commit
king Unis to Fetekta, the servant of Re, that he may commit him to Re
himself." <span id="fr_391"></span>[4](#fn_391) More often the gods
themselves, who have greeted him with acclamation, or have stood in awed
silence at his coming, proclaim it far and near, after they have
announced him to Re: "O Re-Atum! This king Unis comes to thee, an
imperishable glorious-one, lord of the affairs of the place of the four
pillars (the sky). Thy son comes to thee. This king Unis comes to thee."
Then Set and Nephthys hasten to the south, where they proclaim his
coming "to the gods of the south and their spirits": "This king Unis
comes indeed, an imperishable glorious-one. When he desires that ye die,
ye die; when he desires that ye live, ye live." To the north Osiris and
Isis say: "This king Unis comes indeed, an imperishable glorious-one,
like the morning star over the Nile. The spirits dwelling in the water
praise him. When he desires that he live, he lives; when he desires that
he die, he dies." Thoth hastens to the west with the words: "This king

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Unis comes indeed,
an imperishable spirit, adorned with the jackal on the sceptre before
the western height. <span id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_392) He numbers the
hearts, he takes possession of the hearts. When he desires that he live,
he lives; when he desires that he die, he dies." Finally Horus, speeding
to the east, proclaims: "This king Unis comes indeed, an imperishable
spirit. When he desires that he live, he lives; when he desires that he
die, he dies." In conclusion of this fourfold announcement at the
cardinal points, the voice again cries to Re, "O Re-Atum! Thy son comes
to thee, Unis comes to thee. Lift him up to thee, enfold thou him in thy
embrace. He is thy bodily son forever." <span
id="fr_393"></span>[2](#fn_393)

Thus received by his father, the question of the status of the royal
pilgrim at once arises. His ambitions sometimes seem lowly enough, and
he is even amusingly unceremonious in carrying them out. Yonder sits Re
at his "divan" with his secretary at his side, the scribe having his two
pens thrust behind his ears, while a large roll of papyrus is spread
across his knees. As the king approaches a voice is heard: "O scribe,
scribe! Break thy writing kit, smash thy two pens, destroy thy papyrus
rolls. O Re! Expel him from his post and put king Pepi in his
place." <span id="fr_394"></span>[3](#fn_394) Thus ensconced in a snug
post as secretary of the ruler of the celestial realm, "King Unis sits
before him (Re), king Unis opens his chests (of papers), king Unis
breaks open his edicts, king Unis seals his decrees, king Unis
despatches his messengers who weary not, king Unis does what he (Re)
says to king Unis." <span id="fr_395"></span>[4](#fn_395) Thus the king
becomes the counsellor of the Sun-god, "the wise one bearing the divine
book on the right of

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Re." <span
id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_396) Again we find the dead Pharaoh serving
as a priest "before Re, bearing this jar, which purifies the Southland
before Re, when he comes forth from his horizon." <span
id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_397) He may even appear as Uneg, the son and
body-servant of Re, <span id="fr_398"></span>[3](#fn_398) and we behold
him as "a star . . . long of stride, bringing the provisions of the
(daily) journey to Re every day." <span id="fr_399"></span>[4](#fn_399)

More often the greatest intimacy and familiarity now develop between the
Sun-god and the newly arrived king; "every beautiful place where Re
goes, he finds this king Pepi there." <span
id="fr_400"></span>[5](#fn_400) Should there be any difficulties in the
way, the dead king recites a magical hymn <span
id="fr_401"></span>[6](#fn_401) in praise of the Sun-god, which smoothes
the way to perfect fellowship with Re. The priestly editor has added the
assurance: "Now he who knows this chapter of Re, and he doeth them,
(even) these charms of Harakhte (the Horizon-god), he shall be the
familiar of Re, he shall be the friend of Harakhte. King Pepi knows it,
this chapter of Re; king Pepi doeth them, these charms of Harakhte. King
Pepi is the familiar of Re, king Pepi is the companion of
Harakhte." <span id="fr_402"></span>[7](#fn_402) Thus the departed
Pharaoh may "sit at his (Re's) shoulder, and Re does not permit him to
throw himself upon the earth (in obeisance), knowing that he (the king)
is greater than he (Re)." <span id="fr_403"></span>[8](#fn_403) In the
quaint imagination of the priestly editor, the king may even become the
lotus flower, which the god holds to his nose. <span
id="fr_404"></span>[9](#fn_404)

But that association with Re in which the Egyptian took the greatest
delight was the voyage with him across the sky in his daily journey to
the west. As the cool Nile breezes and the picturesque life of the
refreshing river

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

were the central picture in his earthly life, so he looked forward to
finding the celestial Nile the source of the same joy in the life
hereafter. "Thou embarkest in this barque of Re, to which the gods love
to ascend, in which they love to embark, in which Re is rowed to the
horizon." <span id="fr_405"></span>[1](#fn_405) The simplest form of
this belief places the dead king among the crew of the Solar barque.
"King Pepi receives to himself his oar, he takes his seat, he seats
himself in the bow of the ship, . . . he rows Re to the west." <span
id="fr_406"></span>[2](#fn_406) If there is no other way to secure
passage in the beautiful "sunbeam-barque," <span
id="fr_407"></span>[3](#fn_407) the once splendid Pharaoh is permitted
to come along as little better than a stowaway and to bail out the
craft. <span id="fr_408"></span>[4](#fn_408)

The theological theory of the state in the Pyramid Age, as we have seen,
represents the Pharaoh as the son of the Sun-god. The Pyramid Texts of
course take full advantage of this circumstance, and often call upon Re
to recognize and protect his son. The dead Pharaoh boldly approaches the
Sun-god with the words: "I, O Re, am this one of whom thou didst say, .
. . 'My son!' My father art thou, O Re. . . . Behold king Pepi, O Re.
This king Pepi is thy son. . . . This king Pepi shines in the east like
Re, he goes in the west like Kheprer. This king Pepi lives on that
whereon Horus (son of Re) lord of the sky lives, by command of Horus
lord of the sky." <span id="fr_409"></span>[5](#fn_409) As Re, however,
was his own son, begotten every day and born every morning, the sonship
of the Pharaoh ultimately leads to his identity with Re, and the
priestly elaborators of the Pyramid Texts had no hesitation in reaching
this result. This was the more easy in that they had made the king
divine by subtle ceremonies, especially the burning

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

of incense, at his interment. <span id="fr_410"></span>[1](#fn_410) Even
without encroaching upon the position of Re the dead Pharaoh is pictured
as divine, and his divinity is proclaimed to the denizens of the other
world. "Lift up your faces, gods dwelling in Dewat. <span
id="fr_411"></span>[2](#fn_411) King Unis has come that ye may see him
become a great god. . . . Protect yourselves all of you. King Unis
commands men; king Unis judges the living in the court of the region of
Re. King Unis speaks to this pure region which he has visited, that he
may dwell therein with the judge of the two gods. King Unis is mighty
beside him (Re). King Unis bears the sceptre; it purifies king Unis.
King Unis sits with them that row Re; king Unis commands good that he
may do it. King Unis is a great god." <span
id="fr_412"></span>[3](#fn_412)

This divinity is unmistakably defined more than once. "King Teti is this
eye of Re, that passes the night, is conceived and born every
day." <span id="fr_413"></span>[4](#fn_413) "His mother the sky bears
him living every day like Re. He dawns with him in the east, he sets
with him in the west, his mother Nut (the sky) is not void of him any
day. He equips king Pepi II with life, he causes his heart joy, he
causes his heart pleasure." <span id="fr_414"></span>[5](#fn_414) "Thou
camest forth as king Pepi, king Pepi came forth as thou." <span
id="fr_415"></span>[6](#fn_415) The dead king does not merely receive
the office and station of Re, he actually becomes Re. "Thy body is in
king Pepi, O Re; preserve alive thy body in king Pepi, O Re." <span
id="fr_416"></span>[7](#fn_416) "King Teti is thou (Re), thou art king
Teti; thou shinest in king Teti, king Teti shines in thee." <span
id="fr_417"></span>[8](#fn_417) He is even identified with Atum limb by
limb, <span id="fr_418"></span>[9](#fn_418) or with Atum and the Solar
gods, who are themselves identified with Atum. <span
id="fr_419"></span>[10](#fn_419) Thus he becomes king

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

of the sky in Re's place. "Thou embarkest therein (in the Sun-barque)
like Re; thou sittest down on this throne of Re, that thou mayest
command the gods; for thou art Re, who came forth from Nut, who begets
Re every day." <span id="fr_420"></span>[1](#fn_420) There are indeed
hints that the Pharaoh takes forcible possession of the Sun-god's
throne, <span id="fr_421"></span>[2](#fn_421) and their identity does
not exclude the idea of his being dispossessed, or even of his continued
benefits to the Pharaoh, though these are sometimes mutual. The voice
says to Re: "Make king Teti sound, and Teti will make thee sound; make
king Teti green (fresh, youthful), and Teti will make thee green," and
thus a mystical relationship with Hathor, the eye of Re, is established,
"which turns back the years from king Teti" and they pass over him
without increasing his age. <span id="fr_422"></span>[3](#fn_422)

Perhaps the finest fragment of literature preserved in the Pyramid Texts
is a Sun-hymn <span id="fr_423"></span>[4](#fn_423) in which the king is
identified with the Sun-god. The hymn addresses Egypt in a long and
imposing enumeration of the benefits which she enjoys under the
protection and sovereignty of the Sun-god. Hence Egypt offers him her
wealth and produce. Now in view of the fact that the Pharaoh is
identified with the Sun-god, the Pharaoh, therefore, confers the same
benefits on Egypt, and must therefore receive the same gifts from Egypt.
The entire hymn is therefore repeated with the insertion of the
Pharaoh's name wherever that of Re or Horus occurs in the original
hymn, <span id="fr_424"></span>[5](#fn_424) and

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

thus the king appropriates to himself all the homage and offerings
received by the Sun-god from Egypt.

But the imagination of the priests does not stop here. Equality or
identity with Re is not enough, and we behold the translated Pharaoh a
cosmic figure of elemental vastness, even superior to the Sun-god in the
primeval darkness. The mysterious voice cries: "Father of king Teti!
Father of king Teti in darkness! Father of king Teti, Atum in darkness!
Bring thou king Teti to thy side that he may kindle for thee the light;
that he may protect thee, as Nun (the primeval ocean) protected these
four goddesses on the day when they protected the throne, (even) Isis,
Nephthys, Neit, and Serket." <span id="fr_425"></span>[1](#fn_425) The
dead king sweeps the sky as a devouring fire as soon as "the arm of the
sunbeams is lifted with king Unis." <span
id="fr_426"></span>[2](#fn_426) Again we see him towering between earth
and sky: "This his right arm, it carries the sky in satisfaction; this
his left arm, it supports the earth in joy." <span
id="fr_427"></span>[3](#fn_427) The imagination runs riot in figures of
cosmic power, and the king becomes "the outflow of the rain, he came
forth at the origin of water"; <span id="fr_428"></span>[4](#fn_428) or
he gains the secret and the power of all things as "the scribe of the
god's-book, which says what is and causes to be what is not." <span
id="fr_429"></span>[5](#fn_429) He came forth before the world or death
existed. "The mother of king Pepi became pregnant with him, O Dweller in
the ⌈nether sky⌉; this king Pepi was born by his father Atum before the
sky came forth, before the earth came forth, before men came forth,
before gods were born, before death came forth. This king Pepi escapes
the day of death as Set

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

escaped the day of death. This king Pepi belongs to your ⌈company⌉, ye
gods of the ⌈nether sky⌉, who cannot perish by their enemies; this king
Pepi perishes not by his enemies. (Ye) who die not by a king, this king
Pepi dies not by a king; (ye) who die not by any dead, king Pepi dies
not by any dead." <span id="fr_430"></span>[1](#fn_430) When in process
of time the gods were born, the king was present at their birth.

The mergence of the king into the very body and being of Re is analogous
to his assimilation by the gods as a group. One of the most remarkable
passages in the Pyramid Texts employs the ceremony and the
suggestiveness of incense-burning as a sympathetic agency by which, as
the odorous vapor arises from earth to the gods, it bears aloft the
fragrance of the king to mingle with that of the gods, and thus to draw
them together in fellowship and association. The passage is of
importance as a very early priestly interpretation of the significance
of incense as fellowship with the gods. The passage reads:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The fire is laid, the fire shines;  
 The incense is laid on the fire, the incense shines.  
 Thy fragrance comes to king Unis, O Incense;  
 The fragrance of king Unis comes to thee, O Incense.  
 Your fragrance comes to king Unis, O ye gods;  
 The fragrance of king Unis comes to you, O ye gods.  
 King Unis is with you, ye gods;  
 Ye are with king Unis, ye gods.  
 King Unis lives with you, ye gods;  
 Ye live with king Unis, ye gods.  
 King Unis loves you, ye gods;  
 Love ye him, ye gods." <span id="fr_431"></span>[2](#fn_431)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

This fellowship thus mystically symbolized is in sharp contrast with a
dark and forbidding picture, surviving from vastly remote prehistoric
days, in which we see the savage Pharaoh ferociously preying upon the
gods like a blood-thirsty hunter in the jungle. The passage begins with
the terrifying advent of the Pharaoh in the sky:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Clouds darken the sky,  
 The stars rain down,  
 The Bows (a constellation) stagger,  
 The bones of the hell-hounds tremble,  
 The ⌈porters⌉ are silent,  
 When they see king Unis dawning as a soul,  
 As a god living on his fathers, Feeding on his mothers.  
 King Unis is lord of wisdom,  
 Whose mother knows not his name.  
 The honor of king Unis is in the sky,  
 His might is in the horizon,  
 Like Atum his father who begat him.  
 When he begat him, he was stronger than he.  
  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    . <span
id="fr_432"></span>[1](#fn_432)  
 King Unis is one who eats men and lives on gods,  
 Lord of messengers, who ⌈despatches⌉ his messages;  
 It is 'Grasper-of-Forelocks' living in Kehew  
 Who binds them for king Unis. It is the serpent 'Splendid-Head'  
 Who watches them for him and repels them for him.  
 It is 'He-who-is-upon-the-Willows'  
 Who lassoes them for him.  
 It is 'Punisher-of-all-Evil-doers'  
 Who stabs them for king Unis.  
 He takes out for him their entrails,  
 He is a messenger whom he (king Unis) sends to ⌈punish⌉.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Shesmu cuts them up for king Unis  
And cooks for him a portion of them  
In his evening kettles (or 'as his evening kettles = meal').  
King Unis is he who eats their charms,  
And devours their glorious ones (souls).  
Their great ones are for his morning portion,  
Their middle(-sized) ones are for his evening portion,  
Their little ones are for his night portion.  
Their old men and their old women are for his incense-burning.  
It is the 'Great-Ones-North-of-the-Sky'  
Who set for him the fire to the kettles containing them,  
With the legs of their oldest ones (as fuel).  
The 'Dwellers-in-the-Sky' revolve for king Unis (in his service).  
⌈The kettles are replenished⌉ for him with the legs of their women.  
He has encircled all the Two Skies (corresponding to the Two Lands),  
He has revolved about the two regions.  
King Unis is the 'Great Mighty-One'  
Who overpowers the 'Mighty Ones'  
  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
Whom he finds in his way, him he devours. . . . <span
id="fr_433"></span>[1](#fn_433)  
The protection of king Unis is before all the noble (dead) Who dwell in
the horizon.  
King Unis is a god, older than the eldest.  
Thousands revert to him,  
Hundreds are offered to him.  
Appointment as 'Great One' is given to him  
By Orion, father of gods.  
King Unis has dawned again in the sky,  
⌈Shining⌉ as lord of the horizon.  
  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
He has taken the hearts of the gods;  
He has eaten the Red,  
He has swallowed the Green.  
King Unis is nourished on satisfied organs,  
He is satisfied, living on their hearts and their charms.  
  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
Their charms are in his belly.  
The dignities of king Unis are not taken away from him;</span>

</div>

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">He hath swallowed the knowledge of every god.  
The lifetime of king Unis is eternity,  
His limit is everlastingness in this his dignity of:  
'If-he-wishes-he-does,  
If-he-wishes-not-he-does-not,' <span id="fr_434"></span>[1](#fn_434)  
Who dwells in the limits of the horizon for ever and ever.  
Lo, their (the gods’) soul is in the belly of king Unis,  
Their Glorious Ones are with king Unis.  
The plenty of his portion is more than (that of) the gods.  
  .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
Lo, their soul is with king Unis." <span
id="fr_435"></span>[2](#fn_435)</span>

</div>

In this remarkable picture the motive of the grotesque cannibalism is
perfectly clear. The gods are hunted down, lassoed, bound, and
slaughtered like wild cattle, that the king may devour their substance,
and especially their internal organs, like the heart where the
intelligence had its seat, in the belief that he might thus absorb and
appropriate their qualities and powers. When "he has taken the hearts of
the gods," "he has swallowed the knowledge of every god," and "their
charms are in his belly"; and because the organs of the gods which he
has devoured are plentifully satisfied with food, the king cannot
hunger, for he has, as it were, eaten complete satiety.

This introduces us to a subject to which the Pyramid Texts devote much
space—the question of the food supply in the distant realm of the
Sun-god. To explain the apparently aimless presentation of food at the
tomb, where, in the Solar belief the dead no longer tarried, it was
assumed that the food offered there was transmitted to the dead in
various ways. Sometimes it is Thoth who conveys the food from the tomb
to the sky and delivers

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

it to the dead king; <span id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_436) again it is
the two Solar barques who transport it thither. <span
id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_437) The "Imperishable Stars" too may convey
the food offered on earth to the kas in the sky <span
id="fr_438"></span>[3](#fn_438) or the ferryman may be prevailed upon to
do so. <span id="fr_439"></span>[4](#fn_439) In any case the chief dread
felt by the Egyptian for the hereafter was fear of hunger, and
especially the danger that he might be reduced to the detestable
extremity of consuming his own uncleanness. "The abomination of king
Unis is offal; he rejects urine, he eats it not." <span
id="fr_440"></span>[5](#fn_440)

More commonly the celestial region where he tarries furnishes all his
necessities. As son of Re, born of the Sky-goddess, he is frequently
represented as suckled by one of the Sky-goddesses or some other
divinity connected with Re, especially the ancient goddesses of the
prehistoric kingdoms of South and North. These appear as "the two
vultures with long hair and hanging breasts; . . . they draw their
breasts over the mouth of king Pepi, but they do not wean him
forever"; <span id="fr_441"></span>[6](#fn_441) or we find them as the
two crowns of the two kingdoms personified as goddesses: "This king Pepi
knows his mother, he forgets not his mother: (even) the White Crown
shining and broad that dwells in Nekheb, mistress of the southern palace
. . . and the bright Red Crown, mistress of the regions of Buto. O
mother of this king Pepi . . . give thy breast to this king Pepi, suckle
this king Pepi therewith." To this the goddess responds: "O my son Pepi,
my king, my breast is extended to thee, that thou mayest suck it, my
king, and live, my king, as long as thou art little." <span
id="fr_442"></span>[7](#fn_442) This

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

incident exhibits more of the naturally and warmly human than anything
else in the Solar theology.

Besides this source of nourishment, and the very bodies of the gods
themselves, <span id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_443) there were also the
offerings of all Egypt, as we have seen in the ancient Sun-hymn, where
the dead king receives all that is offered by Egypt to Re (pp.
[13](rtae05.htm#page_13)–[14](rtae05.htm#page_14)). It is taken for
granted that the celestial revenues belong to the king, and that they
will me*et al*l his wants. We hear the voice calling for the mortuary
revenues in his behalf: "An offering which the king gives! An offering
which Anubis gives! Thy thousand of young antelope from the highland,
they come to thee with bowed head. An offering which the king gives! An
offering which Anubis gives! Thy thousand of bread! Thy thousand of
beer! Thy thousand of incense, that came forth from the palace hall! Thy
thousand of everything pleasant! Thy thousand of cattle! Thy thousand of
everything thou eatest, on which thy desire is set!" <span
id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_444) The Pyramid Texts delight to picture the
plenty which the king is to enjoy. "Plenty has extended her arm toward
king Teti. The two arms of king Teti have embraced fisher and fowler,
(even) all that the field furnishes to her son, the
fisher-fowler." <span id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_445) We even see him
going about with sack and basket collecting quantities of food, <span
id="fr_446"></span>[4](#fn_446) food of the gods which cannot perish,
"bread which cannot dry up" and "beer which cannot grow stale." <span
id="fr_447"></span>[5](#fn_447) For the voice prays to the Sun-god:
"Give thou bread to this king Pepi from this thy eternal bread, thy
everlasting beer," <span id="fr_448"></span>[6](#fn_448) and we read
that "this king Pepi receives his

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

provision from that which is in the granary of the Great God (Re)" <span
id="fr_449"></span>[1](#fn_449) and his "bread is the bread of the god
which is in the palace hall." <span id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_450)
There in "the good seat of the Great God, in which he does the things to
be done with the revered (dead), he appoints them to food and assigns
them to fowling . . .; he appoints king Pepi to food, he assigns king
Pepi to fowling." <span id="fr_451"></span>[3](#fn_451) He is surrounded
by plenty: "He who is behind him belongs to food, lie who is before him
belongs to snared fowl," <span id="fr_452"></span>[4](#fn_452) and thus
"that land into which king Unis goes—he thirsts not in it, he hungers
not in it forever," <span id="fr_453"></span>[5](#fn_453) for there
"Appetite belongs to the morning meal of the king, Plenty belongs to his
evening meal." <span id="fr_454"></span>[6](#fn_454) Again a voice
summons him: "Ho, king Pepi! . . . Raise thee up! Arise! Sit down to thy
thousand of bread, thy thousand of beer, thy thousand of oxen, thy
thousand of geese, thy thousand of everything whereon the god
lives." <span id="fr_455"></span>[7](#fn_455) There can be no failure of
the source of supply: "a god does not escape from what he has said.
(Therefore) he will furnish to thee thy thousand of bread, thy thousand
of beer, thy thousand of oxen, thy thousand of geese, thy thousand of
everything on which the god lives." <span
id="fr_456"></span>[8](#fn_456)

There were, to be sure, certain contingencies to be guarded against,
lest some one else should secure the provisions intended for the king.
"This king Pepi eats this his sole bread alone; he does not give it to
the one behind him;" <span id="fr_457"></span>[9](#fn_457) nor does he
permit the fowl of the air to plunder him of his portion. <span
id="fr_458"></span>[10](#fn_458) If necessary he may resort to magical
means, so cunningly devised that he is enabled to banish hunger and
thirst and drive them far away.

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Hunger! Come not
to king Teti. Hasten to Nun (the primeval flood), go to the flood. King
Teti is sated; he hungers not by reason of this bread of Horus which he
has eaten, which his eldest daughter made for him. He is satisfied
therewith, he takes this land therewith. King Teti thirsts not by reason
of Shu; he hungers not by reason of Tefnut. Hapi, Dewamutef, Kebehsenuf,
and Imset (the four sons of Horus), they expel this hunger which is in
the body of king Teti, and this thirst which is in the lips of king
Teti." <span id="fr_459"></span>[1](#fn_459)

Finally one of the most, if not the most, important of the numerous
sources from which the departed Pharaoh hoped to draw his sustenance in
the realm of Re was the tree of life in the mysterious isle in the midst
of the Field of Offerings, in search of which he sets out in company
with the Morning Star. The Morning Star is a gorgeous green falcon, a
Solar divinity, identified with "Horus of Dewat." He has four faces,
corresponding to the four Horuses of the East, with whom he is doubtless
also identified. <span id="fr_460"></span>[2](#fn_460) We find him
standing in the bow of his celestial barque of seven hundred and seventy
cubits in length, and there the voice addresses him: "Take thou this
king Pepi with thee in the cabin of thy boat. . . . Thou takest this thy
favorite harpoon, thy staff which ⌈pierces⌉ the canals, whose points are
the rays of the sun, whose barbs are the claws of Mafdet. King Pepi cuts
off therewith the heads of the adversaries, dwelling in the Field of
Offerings, when he has descended to the sea. Bow thy head, decline thy
arms, O Sea! The children of Nut are these

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Pepi and the
Morning Star) who have descended to thee, wearing their garlands on
their heads, wearing their garlands at their throats." Here the homage
of the sea is claimed because Pepi and the Morning Star are bent upon a
beneficent errand for Isis and Horus. <span
id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_461) The story then proceeds: "This king Pepi
opened his path like the fowlers, he exchanged greetings with the lords
of the kas, he went to the great isle in the midst of the Field of
Offerings over which the gods make the swallows fly. The swallows are
the Imperishable Stars. They give to this king Pepi this tree of life,
whereof they live, that ye (Pepi and the Morning Star) may at the same
time live thereof." <span id="fr_462"></span>[2](#fn_462)

But the most sinister enemies may contrive to deprive the king of the
sustenance which we have seen to be so elaborately provided. They may
even lurk in his own body, especially in his nostrils, where they may
appropriate the food intended for the king. <span
id="fr_463"></span>[3](#fn_463) In this early age, however, enemies and
dangers in the hereafter have not been multiplied by the priests as they
were later in the Book of the Dead. There are precautions against them,
like the dread name received by the king, a name so potent that his
enemies all fear it and flee away. "Re calls thee in this thy name of
which all the Glorious are afraid. Thy terror is against hearts like the
terror of Re when he rises in the horizon." <span
id="fr_464"></span>[4](#fn_464) Besides the name the dead king also
receives a peculiar costume or a "recognizance," which at once
distinguishes and protects him against attack from those who might
mistake him for an enemy. <span id="fr_465"></span>[5](#fn_465)

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Charms, as we have
already shown, were among the equipment furnished by the Pyramid Texts,
and not a few of these are of a protective character. The enemy against
which these are most often directed in the Pyramid Texts is serpents. It
was of course natural that the dead, who were buried in the earth, out
of which serpents come forth, should be especially exposed to this
danger. In the case of the king also, there was another reason. In the
myth of Re, he was stung by a serpent and forced to reveal his name to
Isis. The departed Pharaoh who is identified with Re must necessarily
meet the same danger, and from it he is protected by numerous serpent
charms in the Pyramid Texts. In such charms it is quite in accordance
with the Solar tale to find Re invoked to exorcise the dangerous
reptile. "O serpent, turn back, for Re sees thee" were words which came
very naturally to the lips of the Egyptian of this age. <span
id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_466) While all the great goddesses of Egypt
are said to extend their protection over the king, it is especially the
Sky-goddess Nut who shields him from all harm. <span
id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_467)

The men in whose hands the Pyramid Texts grew up took the greatest
delight in elaborating and reiterating in ever new and different
pictures the blessedness enjoyed by the king, thus protected,
maintained, and honored in the Sun-god's realm. Their imagination flits
from figure to figure, and picture to picture, and allowed to run like
some wild tropical plant without control or guidance, weaves a complex
fabric of a thousand hues which refuse

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

to merge into one harmonious or coherent whole. At one moment the king
is enthroned in Oriental splendor as he was on earth, at another he
wanders in the Field of Rushes in search of food; here he appears in the
bow of the Solar barque, yonder he is one of the Imperishable Stars
acting as the servant of Re. There is no endeavor to harmonize these
inconsistent representations, although in the mass we gain a broad
impression of the eternal felicity of a godlike ruler, "who puts his
annals (the record of his deeds) among his people, and his love among
the gods." <span id="fr_468"></span>[1](#fn_468) "The king ascends to
the sky among the gods dwelling in the sky. He stands on the great
\[dais', he hears (in judicial session) the (legal) affairs of men. Re
finds thee upon the shores of the sky in this lake that is in Nut (the
Sky-goddess). 'The arriver comes!' say the gods. He (Re) gives thee his
arm on the stairway to the sky. 'He who knows his place comes,' say the
gods. O Pure One, assume thy throne in the barque of Re and sail thou
the sky. . . . Sail thou with the Imperishable Stars, sail thou with the
Unwearied Stars. Receive thou the ⌈tribute⌉ of the Evening Barque,
become thou a spirit dwelling in Dewat. Live thou this pleasant life
which the lord of the horizon lives." <span
id="fr_469"></span>[2](#fn_469) "This king Pepi goes to the Field of
Life, the birthplace of Re in the sky. He finds Kebehet approaching him
with these her four jars with which she refreshes the heart of the Great
God (Re) on the day when he awakes (or 'by day when he awakes'). She
refreshes the heart <span id="fr_470"></span>[3](#fn_470) of this king
Pepi therewith to life, she purifies him, she cleanses him. He receives
his provision from that which is in the granary of the Great God;

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

he is clothed by the Imperishable Stars." <span
id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_471) To Re and Thoth (the sun and the moon)
the voice cries: "Take ye this king Unis with you that he may eat of
that which ye eat, and that he may drink of that which ye drink, that he
may live on that whereon ye live, that he may sit in that wherein ye
sit, that he may be mighty by that whereby ye are mighty, that he may
sail in that wherein ye sail. The booth of king Unis is plaited
(erected) in the reeds, the pool of king Unis is in the Field of
Offerings. His offering is among you, ye gods. The water of king Unis is
wine like (that of) of Re. King Unis circles the Sky like Re, he
traverses the sky like Thoth." <span id="fr_472"></span>[2](#fn_472) The
voice summons the divine nourishment of the king: "Bring the milk of
Isis for king Teti, the flood of Nephthys, the circuit of the lake, the
waves of the sea, life, prosperity, health, happiness, bread, beer,
clothing, food, that king Teti may live therefrom." <span
id="fr_473"></span>[3](#fn_473) "Lo, the two who are on the throne of
the Great God (Re), they summon this king Pepi to life and satisfaction
forever; they (the two) are Prosperity and Health." <span
id="fr_474"></span>[4](#fn_474) Thus "it is better with him to-day than
yesterday," <span id="fr_475"></span>[5](#fn_475) and we hear the voice
calling to him: "Ho! King Pepi, pure one! Re finds thee standing with
thy mother Nut. She leads thee in the path of the horizon and thou
makest thy abiding place there. How beautiful it is together with thy ka
for ever and ever." <span id="fr_476"></span>[6](#fn_476)

Over and over again the story of the king's translation to the sky is
brought before us with an indomitable conviction and insistence which it
must be concluded were thought to make the words of inevitable power and
effect. Condensed into a paragraph the whole sweep of the king's

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

celestial career is brought before us in a few swift strokes, each like
a ray of sunshine touching for but an instant the prominences of some
far landscape across which we look. Long successions of such paragraphs
crowd one behind another like the waves of the sea, as if to overwhelm
and in their impetuous rush to bear away as on a flood the insistent
fact of death and sweep it to utter annihilation. It is difficult to
convey to the modern reader the impression made by these thousands of
lines as they roll on in victorious disregard of the invincibility of
death, especially in those epitomizations of the king's celestial career
which are so frequent, the paragraphs here under discussion. In so far
as they owe their impressiveness to their mere bulk, built up like a
bulwark against death, we can gain the impression only by reading the
whole collection through. The general character of such individual
epitomizing paragraphs is perhaps suggested by such as the following.
The voice addresses the king: "Thy seats among the gods abide; Re leans
upon thee with his shoulder. Thy odor is as their odor, thy sweat is as
the sweat of the Eighteen Gods. Thou dawnest, O king Teti, in the royal
hood; thy hand seizes the sceptre, thy fist grasps the mace. Stand, O
king Teti, in front of the two palaces of the South and the North. Judge
the gods, (for) thou art of the elders who surround Re, who are before
the Morning Star. Thou art born at thy New Moons like the moon. Re leans
upon thee in the horizon, O king Teti. The Imperishable Stars follow
thee, the companions of Re serve thee, O king Teti. Thou purifiest
thyself, thou ascendest to Re; the sky is not empty of thee, O king
Teti, forever." <span id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_477) "King Teti
purifies himself; he receives to himself his pure seat that is in the
sky. He

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

abides, the beautiful seats of king Teti abide. He receives to himself
his pure seat that is in the barque of Re. The sailors who row Re, they
(also) row king Teti. The sailors who carry Re around behind the
horizon, they carry (also) king Teti around behind the horizon." <span
id="fr_478"></span>[1](#fn_478) "O king Neferkere! the mouth of the
earth opens to thee, Geb (the Earth-god) speaks to thee: 'Thou art great
like a king, mighty like Re.' Thou purifiest thyself in the Jackal-lake,
thou cleansest thyself in the lake of Dewat. 'Welcome to thee,' say the
Eighteen Gods. The eastern door of the sky is opened to thee by
Yemen-kau; Nut has given to thee her arms, O king Neferkere, she of the
long hair and pendent breasts. She guides thee to the sky, she does not
put king Neferkere down (again) to the earth. She bears thee, O king
Neferkere, like Orion; she makes thy abiding place before the Double
Palace (of Upper and Lower Egypt transferred to the sky). King Neferkere
descends into the barque like Re, on the shores of the Lily-lake. King
Neferkere is rowed by the Unwearied Stars, he commands the Imperishable
Stars." <span id="fr_479"></span>[2](#fn_479)

Such in the main outlines were the beliefs held by the Egyptian of the
Old Kingdom (2980–2475 B.C.) concerning the Solar hereafter. There can
be no doubt that at some time they were a fairly well-defined group,
separable as a group from those of the Osirian faith. To the Osirian
faith, moreover, they were opposed, and evidences of their
incompatibility, or even hostility, have survived. We find it said of Re
that "he has not given him (the king) to Osiris, he (the king) has not
died the death; he has become a Glorious One in the horizon"; <span
id="fr_480"></span>[3](#fn_480) and still more unequivocal is the
following: "Re-Atum does not give thee to Osiris. He (Osiris) numbers
not thy heart, he

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

gains not power over thy heart. Re-Atum gives thee not to Horus (son of
Osiris). He numbers not thy heart, he gains not power over thy heart.
Osiris! thou hast not gained power over him, thy son (Horus) has not
gained power over him. Horus! thou hast not gained power over him, thy
father (Osiris) has not gained power over him." <span
id="fr_481"></span>[1](#fn_481) It is evident that to the devotee of the
Solar faith, Osiris once represented the realm and the dominion of
death, to which the follower of Re was not delivered up. In harmony with
this is the apprehension that the entire Osirian group might enter the
pyramid with evil intent. As a great Solar symbol it was necessary to
protect the pyramid from the possible aggressions of Osiris, the Osirian
Horus, and the other divinities of the Osirian group. <span
id="fr_482"></span>[2](#fn_482) At a very early age the beliefs of both
the Solar and the Osirian religion merged as we have seen in the first
lecture. While the nucleus of each group of myths is fairly
distinguishable from the other, the coalescence of the Solar and Osirian
conceptions of the hereafter has left us a very difficult process of
analysis if we undertake to separate them. There is a certain body of
beliefs regarding the hereafter which we may designate as Solar, and
another group which are unquestionably Osirian, but the two faiths have
so interpenetrated each other that there is much neutral territory which
we cannot assign to either, to the entire exclusion of the other. It is
clear that in the Solar faith we have a state theology, with all the
splendor and the prestige of its royal patrons behind it; while in that
of Osiris we are confronted by a religion of the people, which made a
strong appeal to the individual believer. It is not impossible that the
history of the early sequence of these beliefs was thus: We

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

should begin with a primitive belief in a subterranean kingdom of the
dead which claimed all men. As an exclusive privilege of kings at first,
and then of the great and noble, the glorious celestial hereafter which
we have been discussing, finally emerged as a Solar kingdom of the dead.
When the growing prestige of Osiris had displaced the older mortuary
gods (like Anubis) Osiris became the great lord of the Nether World, and
Osiris and his realm entered into competition with the Solar and
celestial hereafter. In the mergence of these two faiths we discern for
the first time in history the age-long struggle between the state form
of religion and the popular faith of the masses. It will be the purpose
of the next lecture to disengage as far as may be the nucleus of the
Osirian teaching of the after life, and to trace the still undetermined
course of its struggle with the imposing celestial theology whose
doctrine of the royal dead we have been following.

also Ut. 339, 340, 400, 438. The charm quoted above may be Osirian, in
view of "the bread of Horus," but the distinction between Osirian and
Solar elements is here of slight consequence.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[134:1](rtae08.htm#fr_461) This introduction of
an Osirian incident here does not alter the clearly Solar character of
the story, in which Pepi goes in search of the tree of life with the
Morning Star, a Sun-god, carrying a spear of sunbeams.

450–2, 484, 589, 681, and § 2107. Many of these are strongly colored by
Osirian theology; indeed Ut. 443–7 are largely Osirian, but the original
character of Nut's functions in the celestial and Solar theology is
clear.
