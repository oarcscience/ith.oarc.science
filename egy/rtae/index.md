Most of the 19th century work in Egyptology was done by German, French
or English researchers. James Henry Breasted (1865-1935) was the first
American citizen to get a PhD in Egyptology, at the University of
Berlin. In this book, Breasted details the evolution of religious belief
through thousands of years of Egyptian history. He describes (and quotes
extensively from) the great funerary texts, most importantly the Pyramid
texts, as well as the Coffin texts and the Book of the Dead. He covers
the history of Egyptian religion from the earliest Osiran beliefs up to
the groundbreaking monotheism of Akhenaton. This book is a must-read for
anyone interested in Egyptian religion.--J.B. Hare, April 25th, 2009.
