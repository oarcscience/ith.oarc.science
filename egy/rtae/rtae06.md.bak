### LECTURE II

#### LIFE AFTER DEATH—THE SOJOURN IN THE TOMB—DEATH MAKES ITS IMPRESSION ON RELIGION

<span class="smallcaps">Among</span> no people ancient or modern has the
idea of a life beyond the grave held so prominent a place as among the
ancient Egyptians. This insistent belief in a hereafter may perhaps have
been, and experience in the land of Egypt has led me to believe it was,
greatly favored and influenced by the fact that the conditions of soil
and climate resulted in such a remarkable preservation of the human body
as may be found under natural conditions nowhere else in the world. In
going up to the daily task on some neighboring temple in Nubia, I was
not infrequently obliged to pass through the corner of a cemetery, where
the feet of a dead man, buried in a shallow grave, were now uncovered
and extended directly across my path. They were precisely like the rough
and calloused feet of the workmen in our excavations. How old the grave
was I do not know, but any one familiar with the cemeteries of Egypt,
ancient and modern, has found numerous bodies or portions of bodies
indefinitely old which seemed about as well preserved as those of the
living. This must have been a frequent experience of the ancient
Egyptian, <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md) and like Hamlet with the
skull of Yorick in his hands, he must often have pondered deeply as he
contemplated these silent witnesses. The surprisingly perfect state of
preservation in which he found his ancestors whenever the digging of a
new grave disclosed them, must have greatly stimulated

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

his belief in their continued existence, and often aroused his
imagination to more detailed pictures of the realm and the life of the
mysterious departed. The earliest and simplest of these beliefs began at
an age so remote that they have left no trace in surviving remains. The
cemeteries of the prehistoric communities along the Nile, discovered and
excavated since 1894, disclose a belief in the future life which was
already in an advanced stage. Thousands of graves, the oldest of which
cannot be dated much later than the fifth millennium B.C., were dug by
these primitive people in the desert gravels along the margin of the
alluvium. In the bottom of the pit, which is but a few feet in depth,
lies the body with the feet drawn up toward the chin and surrounded by a
meagre equipment of pottery, flint implements, stone weapons, and
utensils, and rude personal ornaments, all of which were of course
intended to furnish the departed for his future life.

From the archaic beliefs represented in such burials as these it is a
matter of fifteen hundred years to the appearance of the earliest
written documents surviving to us—documents from which we may draw
fuller knowledge of the more developed faith of a people rapidly rising
toward a high material civilization and a unified governmental
organization, the first great state of antiquity. Much took place in the
thought of this remote people during that millennium and a half, but for
another half millennium after the beginning of written documents we are
still unable to discern the drift of the development. For two thousand
years, therefore, after the stage of belief represented by the earliest
burials just mentioned, that development went on, though it is now a
lost chapter in human thought which we shall never recover.

When we take up the course of the development about

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 3000 B.C., we have
before us the complicated results of a commingling of originally
distinct beliefs which have long since interpenetrated each other and
have for many centuries circulated thus a tangled mass of threads which
it is now very difficult or impossible to disentangle.

Certain fundamental distinctions can be made, however. The early belief
that the dead lived in or at the tomb, which must therefore be equipped
to furnish his necessities in the hereafter, was one from which the
Egyptian has never escaped entirely, not even at the present day. As
hostile creatures infesting the cemeteries, the dead were dreaded, and
protection from their malice was necessary. Even the pyramid must be
protected from the malignant dead prowling about the necropolis, and in
later times a man might be afflicted even in his house by a deceased
member of his family wandering in from the cemetery. His mortuary
practices therefore constantly gave expression to his involuntary
conviction that the departed continued to inhabit the tomb long after
the appearance of highly developed views regarding a blessed hereafter
elsewhere in some distant region. We who continue to place flowers on
the graves of our dead, though we may at the same time cherish beliefs
in some remote paradise of the departed, should certainly find nothing
to wonder at in the conflicting beliefs and practices of the ancient
Nile-dweller five thousand years ago. Side by side the two beliefs
subsisted, that the dead continued to dwell in or near the tomb, and at
the same time that he departed elsewhere to a distant and blessed realm.

In taking up the first of these two beliefs, the sojourn in the tomb, it
will be necessary to understand the Egyptian notion of a person, and of
those elements of the human personality which might survive death. These
views are of

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

course not the studied product of a highly trained and long-developed
self-consciousness. On the contrary, we have in them the involuntary and
unconscious impressions of an early people, in the study of which it is
apparent that we are confronted by the earliest chapter in
folk-psychology which has anywhere descended to us from the past.

On the walls of the temple of Luxor, where the birth of Amenhotep III
was depicted in sculptured scenes late in the fifteenth century before
Christ, we find the little prince brought in on the arm of the Nile-god,
accompanied apparently by another child. This second figure, identical
in external appearance with that of the prince, is a being called by the
Egyptians the "ka"; it was born with the prince, being communicated to
him by the god. <span id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md) This curious
comrade of an individual was corporeal <span
id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_126.md) and the fortunes of the two were ever
afterward closely associated; but the ka was not an element of the
personality, as is so often stated. It seems to me indeed from a study
of the Pyramid Texts, that the nature of the ka has been fundamentally
misunderstood. He was a kind of superior genius intended to guide the
fortunes of the individual *in the hereafter*, or it was in the world of
the hereafter that he chiefly if not exclusively had his abode, and
there he awaited the coming of his earthly companion. In the oldest
inscriptions the death of a man may be stated by saying that "he goes to
his ka"; <span id="fr_127"></span>[3](#fn_127.md) when Osiris dies he "goes
to his ka." <span id="fr_128"></span>[4](#fn_128.md) Hence the dead are
referred to as those "who have gone to their kas." <span
id="fr_129"></span>[5](#fn_129.md) Moreover, the ka was really

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

separated from its *protégé* by more than the mere distance to the
cemetery, for in one passage the deceased "goes to his ka, to the
sky." <span id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130.md) Similarly the sojourn in the
hereafter is described as an association with the ka, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md) and one of the powers of the blessed
dead was to have dominion over the other kas there. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_132.md) In their relations with each other the
ka was distinctly superior to his mundane companion. In the oldest texts
the sign for the ka, the uplifted arms, are frequently borne upon the
standard which bears the signs for the gods. "Call upon thy ka, like
Osiris, that he may protect thee from all anger of the dead," <span
id="fr_133"></span>[4](#fn_133.md) says one to the deceased; and to be the
ka of a person is to have entire control over him. Thus in addressing
Osiris it is said of Set, "He (Horus) has smitten Set for thee, bound;
thou art his (Set's) ka." <span id="fr_134"></span>[5](#fn_134.md) In the
hereafter, at least, a person is under the dominion of his own ka. The
ka assists the deceased by speaking to the great god on his behalf, and
after this intercession, by introducing the dead man to the god
(Re). <span id="fr_135"></span>[6](#fn_135.md) He forages for the deceased
and brings him food that they both may eat together, <span
id="fr_136"></span>[7](#fn_136.md) and like two guests they sit together at
the same table. <span id="fr_137"></span>[8](#fn_137.md) But the ka is ever
the protecting genius. The dead king Pepi "lives with his ka; he (the
ka) expels the evil that is before Pepi, he removes the evil that is
behind Pepi, like the boomerangs of the lord of Letopolis, which remove
the evil that is before him and expel the evil that is behind
him." <span id="fr_138"></span>[9](#fn_138.md) Notwithstanding their
intimate association, there was danger that the ka might fail

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

to recognize his *protégé*, and the departed therefore received a
garment peculiar to him, by means of which the ka may not mistake him
for an enemy whom he might slay. <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_139.md)
So strong was the ka, and so close was his union with his *protégé*,
that to have control over a god or a man it was necessary to gain the
power over his ka also, <span id="fr_140"></span>[2](#fn_140.md) and
complete justification of the deceased was only certain when his ka also
was justified. <span id="fr_141"></span>[3](#fn_141.md) Thus united, the
deceased and his protecting genius lived a common life in the hereafter,
and they said to the dead: "How beautiful it is in the company of thy
ka!" <span id="fr_142"></span>[4](#fn_142.md) The mortuary priest whose
duty it was to supply the needs of the deceased in the hereafter was for
this reason called "servant of the ka," and whatever he furnished the ka
was shared by him with his *protégé*, as we have seen him foraging for
his charge, and securing for him provisions which they ate together.
Eventually, that is after a long development, we find the tombs of about
2000 B.C. regularly containing prayers for material blessings in the
hereafter ending with the words: "for the ka of X" (the name of the
deceased).

While the relation of the ka to the dead is thus fairly clear, it is not
so evident in the case of the living. His protecting power evidently had
begun at the birth of the individual, though he was most useful to his
*protégé* after earthly life was over. We find the ka as the protecting
genius of a mortuary temple dwelling on earth, but it is certainly
significant that it is a mortuary building which he protects. Moreover
the earliest example of such a *local* genius is Osiris, a mortuary god,
who is said to become the ka of a pyramid and its temple, that they may
enjoy

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

his protection. <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143.md) As we stated
above, however, the ka was not an element of the personality, and we are
not called upon to explain him physically or psychologically as such. He
is roughly parallel with the later notion of the guardian angel as found
among other peoples, and he is of course far the earliest known example
of such a being. It is of importance to note that in all probability the
ka was originally the exclusive possession of kings, each of whom thus
lived under the protection of his individual guardian genius, and that
by a process of slow development the privilege of possessing a ka became
universal among all the people. <span id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_144.md)

The actual personality of the individual in life consisted, according to
the Egyptian notion, in the visible body, and the invisible
intelligence, the seat of the last being considered the "heart" or the
"belly," <span id="fr_145"></span>[3](#fn_145.md) which indeed furnished
the chief designations for the intelligence. Then the vital principle
which, as so frequently among other peoples, was identified with the
breath which animated the body, was not clearly distinguished from the
intelligence. The two together were pictured in one symbol, a

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

human-headed bird with human arms, which we find in the tomb and coffin
scenes depicted hovering over the mummy and extending to its nostrils in
one hand the figure of a swelling sail, the hieroglyph for wind or
breath, and in the other the so-called *crux ansata*, or symbol of life.
This curious little bird-man was called by the Egyptians the "ba." The
fact has been strangely overlooked that originally the ba came into
existence really for the first time at the death of the individual. All
sorts of devices and ceremonies were resorted to that the deceased might
at death become a ba, or as the Pyramid Texts, addressing the dead king,
say, "that thou mayest become a ba among the gods, thou living as (or
'in') thy ba." <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146.md) There was a
denominative verb "ba," meaning "to become a ba." Ba has commonly been
translated as "soul," and the translation does indeed roughly correspond
to the Egyptian idea. It is necessary to remember, however, in dealing
with such terms as these among so early a people, that they had no
clearly defined notion of the exact nature of such an element of
personality. It is evident that the Egyptian never wholly dissociated a
person from the body as an instrument or vehicle of sensation, and they
resorted to elaborate devices to restore to the body its various
channels of sensibility, after the ba, which comprehended these very
things, had detached itself from the body. He thought of his departed
friend as existing in the body, or at least as being in outward
appearance still possessed of a body, as we do, if we attempt to picture
our departed friend at all. Hence, when depicted in mortuary paintings,
the departed of course appears as he did in life. <span
id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_147.md)

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

In harmony with these conceptions was the desire of the surviving
relatives to insure physical restoration to the dead. Gathered with the
relatives and friends of the deceased, on the flat roof of the massive
masonry tomb, the mortuary priest stood over the silent body and
addressed the departed: "Thy bones perish not, thy flesh sickens not,
thy members are not distant from thee." <span
id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md) Or he turns to the flesh of the dead
itself and says: "O flesh of this king Teti, decay not, perish not; let
not thy odor be evil." <span id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_149.md) He utters a
whole series of strophes, each concluding with the refrain: "King Pepi
decays not, he rots not, he is not bewitched by your wrath, ye
gods." <span id="fr_150"></span>[3](#fn_150.md)

However effective these injunctions may have been, they were not
considered sufficient. The motionless body must be resuscitated and
restored to the use of its members and senses. This resurrection might
be the act of a favoring god or goddess, as when accomplished by Isis or
Horus, or the priest addresses the dead and assures him that the
Sky-goddess

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

will raise him up: "She sets on again for thee thy head, she gathers for
thee thy bones, she unites for thee thy members, she brings for thee thy
heart into thy body." <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md) Sometimes
the priest assumes that the dead does not even enter the earth at
interment and assures the mourning relatives: "His abomination is the
earth, king Unis enters not Geb (the Earth-god). When he perishes,
sleeping in his house on earth, his bones are restored, his injuries are
removed." <span id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152.md) But if the inexorable
fact be accepted that the body now lies in the tomb, the priest
undauntedly calls upon the dead: "Arise, dwellers in your tombs. Loose
your ⌈bandages,⌉ throw off the sand from thy (*sic!*) face. Lift thee up
from upon thy left side, support thyself on thy right side. Raise thy
face that thou mayest look at this which I have done for thee. I am thy
son, I am thy heir." <span id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153.md) He assures
the dead: "Thy bones are gathered together for thee, thy members are
prepared for thee, thy ⌈impurities⌉ are thrown off for thee, thy
bandages are loosed for thee. The tomb is opened for thee, the coffin is
broken open for thee." <span id="fr_154"></span>[4](#fn_154.md) And yet the
insistent fact of death so inexorably proclaimed by the unopened tomb
led the priest to call upon the dead to waken and arise before each
ceremony which he performed. As he brings food and drink we find him
calling: "Raise thee up, king Pepi, receive to thee thy water. Gather to
thee thy bones, stand thou up upon thy two feet, being a glorious one
before the glorious. Raise thee up for this thy bread which cannot dry
up, and thy beer which cannot become stale." <span
id="fr_155"></span>[5](#fn_155.md)

But even when so raised the dead was not in possession

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

of his senses and faculties, nor the power to control and use his body
and limbs. His mourning friends could not abandon him to the uncertain
future without aiding him to recover all his powers. "King Teti's mouth
is opened for him, king Teti's nose is opened for him, king Teti's ears
are opened for him," <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_156.md) says the
priest, and elaborate ceremonies were performed to accomplish this
restoration of the senses and the faculty of speech. <span
id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_157.md)

All this was of no avail, however, unless the unconscious body received
again the seat of consciousness and feeling, which in this restoration
of the mental powers was regularly the heart. "The heart of king Teti is
not taken away," <span id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_158.md) says the ritual;
or if it has gone the Sky-goddess "brings for thee thy heart into thy
body (again)." <span id="fr_159"></span>[4](#fn_159.md)

Several devices were necessary to make of this unresponsive mummy a
living person, capable of carrying on the life hereafter. He has not
become a ba, or a soul merely by dying, as we stated in referring to the
nature of the ba. It was necessary to aid him to become a soul. Osiris
when lying dead had become a soul by receiving from his son Horus the
latter's eye, wrenched from the socket in his conflict with Set. Horus,
recovering his eye, gave it to his father, and on receiving it Osiris at
once became a soul. From that time any offering to the dead might be,
and commonly was, called the "eye of Horus, "and might thus produce the
same effect as on Osiris.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Raise thee up,"
says the priest, "for this thy bread, which cannot dry up, and thy beer
which cannot become stale, *by which thou shalt become a soul*." <span
id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160.md) The food which the priest offered
possessed the mysterious power of effecting the transformation of the
dead man into a soul as the "eye of Horus" had once transformed Osiris.
And it did more than this, for the priest adds, "by which thou shalt
become one prepared." <span id="fr_161"></span>[2](#fn_161.md) To be "one
prepared" or, as the variants have it, "one equipped," is explained in
the tombs of the Old Kingdom, where we find the owner boasting, "I am an
excellent, equipped spirit, I know every secret charm of the
court." <span id="fr_162"></span>[3](#fn_162.md) This man, a provincial
noble, is proud of the fact that he was granted the great boon of
acquaintance with the magical mortuary equipment used for the king at
the court, an equipment intended to render the dead invulnerable and
irresistible in the hereafter. We are able then to understand another
noble of the same period when he says: "I am an excellent equipped
spirit (literally, 'glorious one') whose mouth knows," <span
id="fr_163"></span>[4](#fn_163.md) meaning his mouth is familiar with the
mortuary magical equipment, which he is able to repeat whenever needed:
Similarly one of the designations of the departed in the Pyramid Texts
is "the glorious by reason of their equipped mouths." <span
id="fr_164"></span>[5](#fn_164.md) Finally this strangely potent bread and
beer which the priest offers the dead, not only makes him a "soul" and
makes him "prepared," but it also gives him "power" or makes him a
"mighty one." <span id="fr_165"></span>[6](#fn_165.md) The "power"
conferred was in the first place intended to control the body of the
dead and guide its actions, and without this power intended for this
specific purpose it is evident the Egyptian believed the dead to be
helpless. <span id="fr_166"></span>[7](#fn_166.md) This "power" was also

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

intended to give the dead ability to confront successfully the uncanny
adversaries who awaited him in the beyond. It was so characteristic of
the dead, that they might be spoken of as the "mighty" as we say the
"blessed," and it was so tangible a part of the equipment of the
departed that it underwent purification together with him. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167.md) This "power" finally gave the deceased
also "power" over all other powers within him, and the priest says to
him, "Thou hast power over the powers that are in thee." <span
id="fr_168"></span>[2](#fn_168.md)

From these facts it is evident that the Egyptians had developed a rude
psychology of the dead, in accordance with which they endeavored to
reconstitute the individual by processes *external to him*, under the
control of the survivors, especially the mortuary priest who possessed
the indispensable ceremonies for accomplishing this end. We may
summarize it all in the statement that after the resuscitation of the
body, there was a mental restoration or a reconstitution of the
faculties one by one, attained especially by the process of making the
deceased a "soul" (ba), in which capacity he again existed as a
*person*, possessing all the powers that would enable him to subsist and
survive in the life hereafter. It is therefore not correct to attribute
to the Egyptians a belief in the *immortality* of the soul strictly
interpreted as imperishability or to speak of his "ideas of
immortality." <span id="fr_169"></span>[3](#fn_169.md)

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

That life now involved an elaborate material equipment, a monumental
tomb with its mortuary furniture. The massive masonry tomb, like a
truncated pyramid with very steep sides, was but the rectangular
descendant of the prehistoric tumulus, with a retaining wall around it,
once of rough stones, now of carefully laid hewn stone masonry, which
has taken on some of the incline of its ancient ancestor, the sand heap,
or tumulus, still within it. In the east side of the superstructure,
which was often of imposing size, was a rectangular room, perhaps best
called a chapel, where the offerings for the dead might be presented and
these ceremonies on his behalf might be performed. For, notwithstanding
the elaborate reconstitution of the dead as a person, he was not
unquestionably able to maintain himself in the hereafter without
assistance from his surviving relatives. All such mortuary arrangements
were chiefly Osirian, for in the Solar faith the Sun-god did not die
among men, nor did he leave a family to mourn for him and maintain
mortuary ceremonies on his behalf. To be sure, the oldest notion of the
relation

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

of Osiris to the dead, which is discernible in the Pyramid Texts,
represents him as hostile to them, but this is an archaic survival of
which only a trace remains. <span id="fr_170"></span>[1](#fn_170.md) As a
son of Geb the Earth-god, it was altogether natural to confide the dead
to his charge. <span id="fr_171"></span>[2](#fn_171.md)

It was the duty of every son to arrange the material equipment of his
father for the life beyond—a duty so naturally and universally felt that
it involuntarily passed from the life of the people into the Osiris myth
as the duty of Horus toward his father Osiris. It was an obligation
which was sometimes met with faithfulness in the face of difficulty and
great danger, as when Sebni of Elephantine received news of the death of
his father, Mekhu, in the Sudan, and at once set out with a military
escort to penetrate the country of the dangerous southern tribes and to
rescue the body of his father. The motive for such self-sacrifice was of
course the desire to recover his father's body that it might be embalmed
and preserved, in order that the old man might not lose all prospect of
life beyond. Hence it was that when the son neared the frontier on his
return, he sent messengers to the court with news of what had happened,
so that as he re-entered Upper Egypt he was met by a company from the
court, made up of the embalmers, mortuary priests, and mourners, bearing
fragrant oil, aromatic gums, and fine linen, that all the ceremonies of
embalmment, interment, and complete equipment for the hereafter might be
completed at once, before the body should further perish. <span
id="fr_172"></span>[3](#fn_172.md)

The erection of the tomb was an equally obvious duty incumbent upon sons
and relatives, unless indeed that father was so attached to his own
departed father that he desired to rest in his father's tomb, as one
noble of the

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

twenty-sixth century B.C. informs us was his wish. He says: "Now I
caused that I should be buried in the same tomb with this Zau (his
father's name) in order that I might be with him in the same place; not,
however, because I was not in a position to make a second tomb; but I
did this in order that I might see this Zau every day, in order that I
might be with him in the same place." <span
id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_173.md) This pious son says further: "I buried
my father, the count Zau, surpassing the splendor, surpassing the
goodliness of any ⌈equal⌉ of his who was in this South" (meaning Upper
Egypt). <span id="fr_174"></span>[2](#fn_174.md)

From the thirty-fourth century on, as the tombs of the First Dynasty at
Abydos show, it had become customary for favorite officials and
partisans of the Pharaoh to be buried in the royal cemetery, forming a
kind of mortuary court around the monarch whom they had served in life.
Gradually the king became more and more involved in obligations to
assist his nobles in the erection of their tombs and to contribute from
the royal treasury to the splendor and completeness of their funerals.
The favorite physician of the king receives a requisition on the
treasury and the royal quarries for the labor and the transportation
necessary to procure him a great and sumptuous false door of massive
limestone for his tomb, and he tells us the fact with great satisfaction
and much circumstance in his tomb inscriptions. <span
id="fr_175"></span>[3](#fn_175.md) We see the Pharaoh in the royal
palanquin on the road which mounts from the valley to the desert
plateau, whither he has ascended to inspect his pyramid, now slowly
rising on the margin of the desert overlooking the valley. Here he
discovers the unfinished

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

tomb of Debhen, one of his favorites, who may have presumed upon a
moment of royal complaisance to call attention to its unfinished
condition. The king at once details fifty men to work upon the tomb of
his *protégé*, and afterward orders the royal engineers and quarrymen
who are at work upon a temple in the vicinity to bring for the fortunate
Debhen two false doors of stone, the blocks for the façade of the tomb,
and likewise a portrait statue of Debhen to be erected therein. <span
id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_176.md) One of the leading nobles who was
flourishing at the close of the twenty-seventh century B.C. tells us in
his autobiography how he was similarly favored: "Then I besought . . .
the majesty of the king that there be brought for me a limestone
sarcophagus from Troja (royal quarries near Cairo, from which much stone
for the pyramids of Gizeh was taken). The king had the treasurer of the
god (= Pharaoh's treasurer) ferry over, together with a troop of sailors
under his hand, in order to bring for me this sarcophagus from Troja;
and he arrived with it in a large ship belonging to the court (that is,
one of the royal galleys), together with its lid, the false door . . .
(several other blocks the words for which are not quite certain in
meaning), and one offering-tablet." <span
id="fr_177"></span>[2](#fn_177.md)

In such cases as these, and indeed quite frequently, the king was
expected to contribute to the embalmment and burial of a favorite noble.
We have already seen how the Pharaoh sent out his body of mortuary
officials, priests, and embalmers to meet Sebni, returning from the
Sudan with his father's body. <span id="fr_178"></span>[3](#fn_178.md)
Similarly he despatched one of his commanders to rescue the body of an
unfortunate noble who with his entire military escort had been massacred
by the Bedwin on the shores of the Red Sea, while building

a ship for the voyage to Punt, the Somali coast, in all likelihood the
land of Ophir of the Old Testament. Although the rescuer does not say so
in his brief inscription, it is evident that the Pharaoh desired to
secure the body of this noble also in order to prepare it properly for
the hereafter. <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_179.md) Such solicitude can
only have been due to the sovereign's personal attachment to a favorite
official. This is quite evident in the case of Weshptah, one of the
viziers of the Fifth Dynasty about 2700 B.C. The king, his family, and
the court were one day inspecting a new building in course of
construction under Weshptah's superintendence, for, besides being grand
vizier, he was also chief architect. All admire the work and the king
turns to praise his faithful minister when he notices that Weshptah does
not hear the words of royal favor. The king's exclamation alarms the
courtiers, the stricken minister is quickly carried to the court, and
the priests and chief physicians are hurriedly summoned. The king has a
case of medical rolls brought in, but all is in vain. The physicians
declare his case hopeless. The king is smitten with sorrow and retires
to his chamber, where he prays to Re. He then makes all arrangements for
Weshptah's burial, ordering an ebony coffin made and having the body
anointed in his own presence. The dead noble's eldest son was then
empowered to build the tomb, which the king furnished and endowed. <span
id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_180.md) The noble whose pious son wished to rest
in the same tomb with him (p. 64) enjoyed similar favor at the king's
hands. His son says: "I requested as an honor from the majesty of my
lord, the king of Egypt, Pepi II, who lives forever, that there be
levied a coffin, clothing, and festival perfume for this Zau (his dead
father). His majesty caused that the custodian

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

of the royal domain should bring a coffin of wood, festival perfume,
oil, clothing, two hundred pieces of first-grade linen and of fine
southern linen . . . taken from the White House (the royal treasury) of
the court for this Zau." <span id="fr_181"></span>[1](#fn_181.md)

Interred thus in royal splendor and equipped with sumptuous furniture,
the maintenance of the departed, in theory at least, *through all time*
was a responsibility which he dared not intrust exclusively to his
surviving family or eventually to a posterity whose solicitude on his
behalf must continue to wane and finally disappear altogether. The noble
therefore executed carefully drawn wills and testamentary endowments,
the income from which was to be devoted exclusively to the maintenance
of his tomb and the presentation of oblations of incense, ointment,
food, drink, and clothing in liberal quantities and at frequent
intervals. The source of this income might be the revenues from the
noble's own lands or from his offices and the perquisites belonging to
his rank, from all of which a portion might be permanently diverted for
the support of his tomb and its ritual. <span
id="fr_182"></span>[2](#fn_182.md)

In a number of cases the legal instrument establishing these foundations
has been engraved as a measure of safety on the wall inside the
tomb-chapel itself and has thus been preserved to us. At Siut Hepzefi
the count and baron of the province has left us ten elaborate contracts
on the inner wall of his tomb-chapel, intended to perpetuate the service
which he desired to have regularly celebrated at his tomb or on his
behalf. <span id="fr_183"></span>[3](#fn_183.md)

The amount of the endowment was sometimes surprisingly

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

large. In the twenty-ninth century B.C., the tomb of prince Nekure, son
of king Khafre of the Fourth Dynasty, was endowed from the prince's
private fortune with no less than twelve towns, the income of which went
exclusively to the support of his tomb. A palace steward in Userkaf's
time, in the middle of the twenty-eighth century B.C., appointed eight
mortuary priests for the service of his tomb, and a baron of Upper Egypt
two centuries and a half later endowed his tomb with the revenues from
eleven villages and settlements. The income of a mortuary priest in such
a tomb was, in one instance, sufficient to enable him to endow the tomb
of his daughter in the same way. In addition to such private resources,
the death of a noble not infrequently resulted in further generosity on
the part of the king, who might either increase the endowment which the
noble had already made during his life, or even furnish it entirely from
the royal revenues. <span id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_184.md)

The privileges accruing to the dead from these endowments, while they
were intended to secure him against all apprehension of hunger, thirst,
or cold in the future life, seem to have consisted chiefly in enabling
him to share in the most important feasts and celebrations of the year.
Like all Orientals the Egyptian took great delight in religious
celebrations, and the good cheer which abounded on such occasions he was
quite unwilling to relinquish when he departed this world. The calendar
of feasts, therefore, was a matter of the greatest importance to him,
and he was willing to divert plentiful revenues to enable him to
celebrate all its important days in the hereafter as he had once so
bountifully done among his friends on earth. He really expected,
moreover, to celebrate these

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

joyous occasions among his friends in the temple just as he once had
been wont to do, and to accomplish this he had a statue of himself
erected in the temple court. Sometimes the king, as a particular
distinction granted to a powerful courtier, commissioned the royal
sculptors to make such a statue and station it inside the temple door.
In his tomb likewise the grandee of the Pyramid Age set up a sumptuous
stone portrait statue of himself, concealed in a secret chamber hidden
in the mass of the masonry. Such statues, too, the king not infrequently
furnished to the leading nobles of his government and court. It was
evidently supposed that this portrait statue, the earliest of which we
know anything in art, might serve as a body for the disembodied dead,
who might thus return to enjoy a semblance at least of bodily presence
in the temple, or again in the same way return to the tomb-chapel, where
he might find other representations of his body in the secret chamber
close by the chapel. <span id="fr_185"></span>[1](#fn_185.md)

We discern in such usages the emergence of a more highly developed and
more desirable hereafter, which has gradually supplanted the older and
simpler views. The common people doubtless still thought of their dead
either as dwelling in the tomb, or at best as inhabiting the gloomy
realm of the west, the subterranean kingdom ruled by the old mortuary
gods eventually led by Osiris. But for the great of the earth, the king
and his nobles at least, a happier destiny had now dawned. They might
dwell at will with the Sun-god in his glorious celestial kingdom. In the
royal tomb we can henceforth discern the emergence of this Solar
hereafter (*cf.* pp. [140](rtae08.htm#page_140)–1.md).

<span id="fn_144"></span>[55:2](rtae06.htm#fr_144.md) I owe this last
remark to <span class="smallcaps">Steindorff</span>, who has recently
published a reconsideration of the ka (*Zeitschrift für aegypt.
Sprache*, 48,151, *ff*.), disproving the old notion that the mortuary
statues in the tombs, especially of the Old Kingdom, are statues of the
ka. He is undoubtedly right. After the collection of the above data it
was gratifying to receive the essay of <span
class="smallcaps">Steindorff</span> and to find that he had arrived at
similar conclusions regarding the nature and function of the ka, though
in making the ka so largely mortuary in function I differ with him.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[55:3](rtae06.htm#fr_145.md) See above, pp. 44–45;

<span id="fn_147"></span>[56:2](rtae06.htm#fr_147.md) There were other
*designations* of the dead, but there were not additional elements of
his personality besides the ba and the body, as we find it so commonly
stated in the current discussions of this subject. Thus the dead were
thought of as "glorious" (y’ḫw), <span id="page_57">p. 57</span> and in
the Pyramid Texts are frequently spoken of as the "glorious" just as we
say the "blessed." The fact that they later spoke of "his y’ḫw," that is
"his glorious one," does not mean that the y’ḫw was another element in
the personality. This is shown in the reference to Osiris when he died,
as "going to his y’ḫw" (Pyr. § 472), which is clearly a substitution of
y’ḫw for ka, in the common phrase for dying, namely, "going to his ka."
The use of y’ḫw with the pronoun, namely, "his y’ḫw," is rare in the
Pyramid Texts, but came into more common use in the Middle Kingdom, as
in the Misanthrope, who addresses his soul as his y’ḫw. Similarly the
"shadow" is only another symbol, but not another element of the
personality. There is no ground for the complicated conception of a
person in ancient Egypt as consisting, besides the body of a ka, a ba
(soul), a y’ḫw (spirit), a shadow, etc. Besides the body and the ba
(soul), there was only the ka, the protecting genius, which was not an
element of the personality as we have said.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[61:3](rtae06.htm#fr_169.md) The above does not
exhaust the catalogue of qualities which were thought valuable to the
dead and were communicated to him in the Pyramid Texts. Thus they say of
the deceased: "His *fearfulness* (b’w) is on his head, his *terror* is
at his side, his *magical charms* are before him" (Pyr. § 477). For
"fearfulness" a variant text has "lion's-head" (Pyr. § 940), which was a
mask placed over the head of the deceased. With this should be compared
the equipment of the deceased with a jackal's face, not infrequently
occurring (*e.g.*, Pyr. § 2098), which of course is a survival of the
influence of the ancient mortuary <span id="page_62">p. 62</span> god,
of the jackal head, Anubis. Two other variant passages (§ 992 and §
1472) have "ba" (soul) instead of "fearfulness" above. This threefold
equipment was that of Osiris. It is found several times, *e.g.*, in §
1559, where the text states: "His *power* is within him, his *soul* (ba)
is behind him, his *preparation* (or equipment) is upon him, which Horus
gave to Osiris." Again it is fourfold, as in Pyr. § 1730, where the
appropriate recitation is enjoined

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"that he may be a *glorious one* thereby,  
 that he may be a *soul* thereby,  
 that he may be an *honored one* thereby,  
 that he may be a *powerful* (or mighty) one thereby"  
                                             (Pyr. § 1730).</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Similarly the
ceremony of offering ointment to the dead is performed, and as a result
the priest says, "Thou art a soul thereby, thou art a mighty one
thereby, thou art an honored one thereby" (Pyr. § 2075), omitting the
"equipment" or "preparation." It is also omitted in Pyr. § 2096 and §
2098.

Texts, nor does the inscription regularly placed on such a statue ever
refer to it as a statue of the ka. Later see also <span
