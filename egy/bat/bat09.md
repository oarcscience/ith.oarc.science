\[paragraph continues\] "This great god travelleth through this city,

this country towards the place of the body of Osiris." . . . "The
Majesty of this great god \[speaketh to\] the gods who are in this
country when he arriveth at these houses which are hidden, and which
contain the image of Osiris. This god crieth \[to the hidden forms which

passeth them by."

The Four Kings of the South.

 

In the abode of Osiris are sixteen gods in mummied forms. The first four
are bearded, and wear the *menat* and the White Crown, and each is

four are bearded, and are described as HETEPTIU, the third four are
bearded, and wear the *menat* and the Red Crown, and each is described
by the title bat, and the fourth four are bearded, and are called

KHU, i.e., "Spirits." Immediately in front of these gods is an enormous
serpent with five heads, which is called ASH-HRAU, i.e., the

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

"Saith the Majesty of this great god to the kings of the South, to the
HETEPTIU, to the kings of the North, and to the Spirits who are in this
City:--May your royal state and condition be with you, may ye receive

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

your White Crowns, and ye HETEPTIU \[may ye receive\] your offerings,
and ye kings of the North may ye receive your Red Crowns, and ye SPIRITS
may ye receive your appointed rites; may your offerings be unto you, and
may ye be in peace. May ye have power over your souls, may ye be
adored(?), may ye have sovereignty over your city, may ye have peace in
your fields, may ye join yourselves to (i.e., attain to) your secret
things with your crowns (?), may your appointed rites be paid to you,
may your sacrifices of propitiation be made to you, and give to the gods
their mouth. Avenge ye me in \[this\] land, and hack in pieces the
serpent Apep, O ye kings of the South, ye Heteptiu, ye kings of the
North, and ye Spirits, who dwell in \[this\] land."

"Those who are in this picture stand up in their places, and they hear
the voice of the great god, the lord of the dead body, that is to say,
KHEPERA in his own flesh . . . . . . in the act of guarding."

Of the Serpent of Many Faces it is said, "Of him who is in this picture,
with his tail in his mouth, his work is to rise up with this image, to
journey to the West in his form, and to travel to every place of the
Tuat. Through the voice of Ra it is that the figures who are in him
advance."

The text which runs in the border above the upper register reads:--

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

"\[This is\] the hidden path of Amentet, on the water of which is
transported this great god in his boat to arrange the lots (or, plans)
of those who are in the Tuat. If their names be uttered, if their bodies
be known, if their true forms and the knowledge of their hours be known,
and the qualities of this secret figure of the Tuat (which are
unknowable), by any man whatsoever: or if an exact representation in
drawing be made of what is in the Hidden Place (Ament) of the Tuat,
which is to the south of the Ât of Amentet: whosoever knoweth this thing
shall be one who is fully provided with food in the Tuat, and he shall
partake in the offerings which are made to the gods who are in the
following of Osiris, and he shall have (i.e., receive) the offerings
which all his kinsfolk are in duty bound to make to him upon earth."

souls come into being, ye who are united to your shades, who lift up
your feet and who move onwards by your thighs, unite ye yourselves to
your flesh, and let not your members be fettered. They have their life
through the voice of this great god every day, and the work which they
do is to watch the two comings of the god Khuti."

Concerning the nine serpents it is said:--

"The Majesty of this great god speaketh words to these male gods who are
at the head of this city:--"Hail, O nine forms of the divine spirits,
whose faces are of flames, who are provided with your knives, burn ye up
the enemies of Khepera, hack in pieces their shades, for ye are the
warders of the Hidden Flesh, which is made of Nu, your habitation, for
it is ye who dwell in the Water of TA-THENEN, and it is for you that the
magical powers of Khepera come into being. They have their means of
living from the word of Ra every day. The work which they do in the Tuat
is to hack asunder the dead, and to cause the spirits to be destroyed."
