up his place in this City in the water, whereupon those who live in the
water make use of their weapons, and they spring into life at the sound
of the working of the sailors, who are gods, \[in the boat of Ra\]."

2\. "Those who are in this picture are they who are on the two sides of
THES-HRAU, who is the Soil of SEKRI, the governor of the TUAT. This
figure (i.e., the serpent) even in the form in which it is, travelleth

and it entereth in with him in the earth every day."

ready your javelins, bend your bows, and destroy ye for me my enemies
who are in darkness; be ye at the portal of your horizon, and follow ye
in my train when I unite myself to those who make adoration to my flesh
in the MANTIT BOAT. It is, they who drive back the SEBI serpent of
NEHA-HRA in the thick darkness, and when this great. god passeth on into
the Eastern Hall of the horizon, they also travel on in the train of
this god." Over the upper register runs a line of text, which reads:

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "\[This is\] the hidden Circle of Amentet, where
KHEPER uniteth himself to the form of Ra, and where the gods, and the

of these things be made according to the figures which are depicted on
the east of the hidden chamber of the Tuat, and if \[a man\] knoweth it,
together with the names \[of the gods\], he shall journey round about
and shall pass through the Tuat, and he shall not be turned back from
making himself a companion of Ra."

goddesses on\] the left come forth from the double serpent MANENUI, and
\[the two\] on the right come forth from the axe SETFIT. They gather
together the souls on earth, and they make pure the mighty spirits in
the Tuat by the hidden figures which are therein, and \[afterwards\]
they swallow their own spirits (or, souls) after this great god hath
passed them by."

his Eye for Horus, stablish ye his Eye for Horus, and make ye Horus to
unite himself to his emanation (or, to that which floweth from his
eyes), praise ye Horus by reason of his Eye, and stablish ye his first

by their names, they unite themselves and come into life in the shades
which are in the mouth of the great god, and their souls journey onwards

which accompanied the lakes of water:
