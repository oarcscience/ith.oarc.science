# CHAPTER XII.

### THE TWELFTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED THEN-NETERU.

THE TWELFTH DIVISION <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) of the Tuat,
which is passed through by the Sun-god during the TWELFTH HOUR of the
night, is introduced by three lines of text, which read:--

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

<span id="img_25700"></span> ![](img/25700.jpg)"The Majesty of this
great god taketh up his position in this Circle, which is the uttermost
limit of thick darkness, and this great god is born in his form of
Khepera in this Circle, and Nut and Nu are in this Circle for the birth
of this great god when he cometh forth from the Tuat and taketh up his
position in the Matet Boat, and when he riseth up from the thighs of
Nut. The name of the Gate of this City is THEN-NETERU. The name of this
City is KHEPER-KEKIU-KHAU-MESTU. The name of the hour of the night
wherein this god cometh into being is MAA-NEFERT-RA."

Above the whole scene is a line of hieroglyphics, which describes it
as:--

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

"The hidden Circle in the Tuat wherein this great god is born; he cometh
forth into the pool of Nu, and he taketh up his place in the body of
Nut. Whosoever shall make a copy thereof according to the copies which
exist in writing upon the east \[wall

of\] the palace, and shall know it upon earth, it shall act as a magical
protector for him both in heaven and upon earth."

In the middle register are:--

1\. The boat of the sun, in which stands the god under a canopy formed
by the body of the serpent Mehen; on his head are horns and a disk. In

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

i.e., Khepera, which takes the place of the solar disk that rested on
the prow of the boat in the Eleventh Hour.

The text reads: "This great god in this picture journeyeth along through
this City by means of the faithful servants (*amkhiu*) of this hidden
image ANKH-NETERU. His gods draw him along by a cord, and he entereth
into his tail and cometh forth from his mouth, and cometh to the birth
under the form of Khepera, and the gods who are in his boat \[do\]
likewise. He taketh up his place on the face of the hidden image of the
horn (or, forehead) of the sky at the end of the thick darkness, and his
hands seal lip the Tuat. Then this great god taketh up his position in
the Eastern Horizon of heaven, and Shu receiveth him, and he cometh into
being in the East."

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "Those who are in this picture draw this great
god through the tail (or, bowels) of the serpent Ankh-neteru. The loyal
servants of Ra who are in his following are the product of his hands,
and they are born on the earth each day after the birth of this great
god in the eastern portion of the sky. They enter into this hidden image
of Ankh-neteru in the form of loyal servants, and they come forth in the
renewed forms of Ra every day. When they tarry upon the earth it is an
abomination to them to utter the name of the god."

heaven. This is the hidden image of the serpent Ankh-neteru, which is by
his den in the Tuat, and he resteth in \[his\] place every day. This
great god speaketh to him in \[his\] name of NA, \[and the space covered
by\] his forepaws and legs is one thousand three hundred cubits long . .

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

from the serpent ANKH-NETERU, and they tow this great god into the sky,

boat in the sky."

great god when he setteth out for this City. They follow after this god,
and the flames which issue from their mouths drive away Apep on behalf
of Ra into the Hall of the East of the Horizon. They journey round about
the upper heavens in his following \[remaining\] in their places, and
they restore these gods after this great god hath passed by the hidden
chamber of the sky, and then they take up their positions \[again\] in
their own abodes. They give pleasure to the hearts of the gods of
Amentet through Ra-Heru-khut, and their work upon the earth is to drive
away those who

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

are in the darkness by the flames of their uraei which are behind them,
and they guide Ra along, and they smite Apep for him in the sky."

this great god from dawn, when he taketh up his position in the Hall of
the east of the sky. They say unto Ra, 'O thou who art the producer of
\[thine own\] birth, who dost bring into being \[thine own\] being,
\[lord of\] homage of every soul . . . . .. Heaven belongeth to thy
soul, which taketh up its place therein, and the earth belongeth to thy
body, thou lord of homage. Thou sailest over the Horizon, thou takest up
thy place in thy shrine, the gods in their bodies praise thee; descend
thou into the sky and take thou thy two souls through thy magical
protectors.' The work of these gods in the Tuat is to praise this great
god, and they stand in this City and they count up (or, verify) the gods
of the country of Mafket (i.e., Sinai). They descend (?) to earth
\[before\] Ra after he hath taken up his position in the sky and doth
rise upon the eyes of mankind in their circles."

\[paragraph continues\] 1. "Those who are in this picture in their own
bodies join themselves unto Ra in the sky to receive this great god at
his coming forth among them in the east of the sky each day. They

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

they have in the Tuat \[belong to\] this Circle."

2\. "Those who are in this picture with their paddles drive Apep to the

god every day, and they receive their protection for this Circle."

O thou who art over the darkness! Life \[to thee\] in all thy majesty!
Life \[to thee\], O governor of Amentet, Osiris, who art over the beings
of Amentet! Life to thee! Life to thee! O thou who art over the Tuat,
the winds of Ra are to thy nostrils, and the nourishment of Kheper is
with thee. Thou livest, and ye live. Hail to Osiris, the lord of the
living, that is to say, of the gods who are with Osiris, and who came
into being with him the first time.' Those who are behind this hidden
Image in this Circle wherein he liveth have their nourishment from the
words of this god in their own Tuat."

4\. He who is in this picture in the invisible form of Horus in the
thick darkness, is the hidden image which Shu lifteth up beneath the
sky, and KEB-UR cometh forth in the earth in this image."

or border formed of earth and stones, or perhaps granite. At the middle

this world, and joined to it is the head of the "image of Shu," with his
arms stretched out along the rounded border of the Tuat. Above his head

the Sun-god, and below is the "image of Af," that is to say, the body of
the night Sun-god, which has been cast away.
