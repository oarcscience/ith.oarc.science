</FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman" SIZE=1>The Boat of Af in the Second Hour</FONT><FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman">.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>during the SECOND HOUR of the night, the Boat of the Ram-headed god AF is seen making its way along the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A></P>
<P>stream which flows, as before, through the division lengthwise; the crew consists of the same gods, and they occupy the same positions in the boat as they did in the First Division. It is, however, important to notice that immediately in front of Ap-uat we see two serpents, which are called Isis and Nephthys respectively, occupying the front of the boat. No carpet or mat hangs over the bows of the boat, and the utchat is not represented on its side; the boat moves over the waters by means of some power exerted either by itself or by some of the gods who stand in it. In front of the boat of AF the way is led by a procession of four boats, which are moved, presumably, by the same power which moves the boat of Ra.</P>
<P>The FIRST BOAT has ends which terminate in bearded human heads, and its celestial and solar character is attested by the sign for "heaven," and the <I>utchat</I>, <A NAME="img_utchat"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/utchat.jpg"> with which its sides are ornamented. The object of this boat is to support the disk of the full moon, which rests within a crescent upon a support divided into thirteen sections, each typifying a day; thus the full moon as it appears on the fourteenth day of the month is here represented. By the disk kneels a god who is "supporting Maat," which is symbolized by a feather, and is described by the word MAAT written between it and the support of the moon's disk. In the mutilated text above the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A></P>
<P>boat it is said that "this great god approacheth this region, and he is conveyed along in the boats of the earth, by means of their . . . . ., and he paddleth along through this Field and uttereth words,"</P>

<P>bearded human heads, but each is surmounted by a pair of plumes. In the centre of the boat, between two goddesses, stands a huge sistrum, which is the symbol of the goddess Hathor, and indicates that the boat is that of HATHOR, or of HATHOR-ISIS. In the fore part of the boat is a beetle, which is described as "This great god NEPER,"</P>

<P>The prow of the THIRD BOAT is surmounted by a crown of the South, and the stern by a crown of the North, and between the two sceptres, which symbolize the gods ANPU and AP-UAT, i.e., the jackal-headed</P>

<P>deity who is kneeling in the middle of the boat. In the centre kneels a woman without arms, and before and behind her stands a man, who is likewise without arms. At each end of the boat grows a plant or, perhaps, a large ear of wheat, which indicates that the boat is that of the form of Osiris as the god of vegetation, who is known by the name NEPER. The legend by the ear of corn in the front of the boat reads, "the boat which conveyeth Neper," and that by the ear in the stern, "collector of herbs and plants," The deity in the boat, or the boat itself perhaps, is called HEPT-MENA-F-TUA-UAA-F. This boat is the boat of the god NEPER, the god of grain, and a form of Osiris as the god of vegetation; it may be noted that its side has no <I>utchat</I> upon it.</P>

<P>"[Those who are in this picture] praise this great god after he hath come forth to them, and behold, it is their words which lead him to them; they lament when he hath passed onwards, having spoken words to them. Behold, these gods are they who make the words of those who are upon earth to reach [the god],and it is they who make souls to approach their forms. Their work consisteth in causing to come into being the offerings of the night, and in performing the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></P>
<P>overthrow [of enemies] at their hour. It is they who guard the day, and who bring on the night until this great god cometh forth from out of the thick darkness to repose in this Court of the eastern horizon of heaven. They cry out in lamentation to this great god, and they utter wailings for him after he hath passed by them. Those who know them shall come forth by day, and he shall be able to journey during the night to the divisions of the great double city."</P>
<P>The texts which describe the duties of the gods in the lower register read:--</P>
<P><A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A></P>
<P>"[Those who are in this picture give unto this great god the seasons] and the years which are in their hands. When this great god hath made speech with them, they answer him, and they have life through the voice of this great god, and their throats draw in breath, for when he crieth to them he ordereth them what they are to do, and he appointeth to them green herbs in abundance in their field. And they supply with the green herbs of URNES the gods who are in the following of Ra, and they make offerings of water to the spirits by the command of this great god, and they kindle flames of fire in order to burn up the enemies of Ra, and there is wailing to them, and they lament after this great god hath passed them by. AM-NEBAUI is the guardian of this Field; whosoever knoweth [this] is in the condition of a spirit equipped with [words of power], and [the gods] protect [him]."</P>

<P>The gods of the Tuat speak to this great god as he entereth in with understanding to the boundary, and he is borne over NET-RA into URNES, saying, "Hail, thou who risest as a Mighty Soul (KHA-BA-AA), who hast received [the things which belong to] the Tuat, AF, thou guardian of heaven . . . . . thou livest, O AF, in TA-TESERT. Come thou, and cast thou thine eye in thy name of Living One, Khepera, at the head of the Tuat. Traverse thou this Field, O thou who hast might, bind thou with fetters the HAU serpent, and smite thou the serpent Neha-hra. There is rejoicing in heaven, and there are shouts of gladness upon the earth at the entrance of thy (literally, his) body. He who shineth sendeth forth light, and the URU gods give light [at dawn; destroy thou] the</P>
<P><A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A></P>
<P>darkness which is in AMENT in thy name of SEKHER-SHETAU-UR-A, illumine thou the thick darkness, O AF. His jawbones are to him, and Ra taketh up his position in AMENT. Thy boat is to thee, and it is thy right, thou art guided along, and those who convey thee over the water and who dwell in the earth make calamities to come upon APEP straightway on thy behalf. Thy protector is the Star-God (SBA), thou art praised and adored, thy soul passeth on, thou goest onward and thy body is equipped with power, and the regions (?) are opened [to thee]. The doors of the hidden land are opened [before thee], OSIRIS cometh unto thee, OSIRIS avengeth thee, and thy word is <I>maat</I> against thy enemies. Thou goest to rest, thou goest to rest in AMENT, and thou comest into being in the form of KHEPERA in the East."</P>
<P>This great god sendeth forth words to the gods who dwell in the, Tuat and to those who inhabit URNES, saying, "Open ye your hidden doors so that the god AF may look [upon you] and may throw aside your darkness, and that ye may draw your water from URNES, and your bread from . . . . . ., and that wind may come to your nostrils, and that ye may not be destroyed and overcome by your own foul odour, and that ye may not be choked by your own dung, and that ye may untie and cast away your swathings, and that ye may lift up your legs and walk upon them, and that ye may stretch out your arms, and that your souls may not be made to remove themselves from</P>
<P><A NAME="page_42"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 42</FONT></A></P>
<P>you. O ye who live in your forms, and who utter your words of magical power, who are provided with your swords [whereby] ye may hack in pieces the enemies of Osiris, whose seasons are permanent, whose years are well established, who pass your state of being [in] your hours, who dwell in your estates, who have your barley in your bread cakes, who have loaves of bread made of the grain which is yours, whose word is <I>maat</I>, depart from my boats, and retreat before [my] images, [that I] may vivify anew this your Field, the Field . . . . . . living ones. [My] soul is among . . . . . . you who have done battle on my behalf, who have protected me against Apep, who have life through my soul, who have being through my bodies, who stablish your seats of holiness which have been decreed to you that ye may exist therein, [who are with your souls] by day, who are in my following in the Tuat, when I make my way through the night and when I destroy the darkness, O grant me your help so that I may travel on in the following of my eye, and that I may journey forwards with those who go to my place in the East. Utter ye cries of joy, O gods of the Tuat, for I avenge you, [utter ye cries of joy,] for I order your destinies."</P>
<P>When they have addressed this god whilst rowing along his boat Am-TA, they cry out, and they bring him to rest in the Field of the NEPERTIU gods who are in the following of Osiris. If these scenes be done [in writing] according to the similitudes which are in the</P>

<P>hidden place of the palace, and if a man hath knowledge of [these] words . . . . they shall act as magical protectors of a man upon earth, regularly, unfailingly, and eternally. The name of this hour is SESHET-MAKET-NEB-S.</P>
