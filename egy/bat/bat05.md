# CHAPTER II.

### THE SECOND DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED URNES.

IN the Scene that illustrates the SECOND DIVISION of the Tuat, which is
passed through by the Sun-god

The Boat of Af in the Second Hour.

 

during the SECOND HOUR of the night, the Boat of the Ram-headed god AF
is seen making its way along the

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

stream which flows, as before, through the division lengthwise; the crew
consists of the same gods, and they occupy the same positions in the
boat as they did in the First Division. It is, however, important to
notice that immediately in front of Ap-uat we see two serpents, which
are called Isis and Nephthys respectively, occupying the front of the
boat. No carpet or mat hangs over the bows of the boat, and the utchat
is not represented on its side; the boat moves over the waters by means
of some power exerted either by itself or by some of the gods who stand
in it. In front of the boat of AF the way is led by a procession of four
boats, which are moved, presumably, by the same power which moves the
boat of Ra.

The FIRST BOAT has ends which terminate in bearded human heads, and its
celestial and solar character is attested by the sign for "heaven," and
the *utchat*, <span id="img_utchat"></span> ![](img/utchat.jpg) with
which its sides are ornamented. The object of this boat is to support
the disk of the full moon, which rests within a crescent upon a support
divided into thirteen sections, each typifying a day; thus the full moon
as it appears on the fourteenth day of the month is here represented. By
the disk kneels a god who is "supporting Maat," which is symbolized by a
feather, and is described by the word MAAT written between it and the
support of the moon's disk. In the mutilated text above the

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

boat it is said that "this great god approacheth this region, and he is
conveyed along in the boats of the earth, by means of their . . . . .,
and he paddleth along through this Field and uttereth words,"

The Boat of the Full Moon.

 

The name of the fore part of the boat appears to be URER, and in front
of the boat is written "Chief of the gods of the Tuat;"

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

the hieroglyphics above the full moon read <span id="img_02400"></span>
![](img/02400.jpg), and those above the stern of the boat read, "Field
of him that beareth up URNES."

The ends of the SECOND BOAT likewise terminate in

 

<span id="img_02401"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

The Boat of the goddess Hathor.

 

bearded human heads, but each is surmounted by a pair of plumes. In the
centre of the boat, between two goddesses, stands a huge sistrum, which
is the symbol of the goddess Hathor, and indicates that the boat is that
of HATHOR, or of HATHOR-ISIS. In the fore part of the boat is a beetle,
which is described as "This great god NEPER,"

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Above the goddess to the left of the sistrum are
written the words, "their boats send forth their words," over the plumed
head in front is written <span id="img_02500"></span> ![](img/02500.jpg)
and over that at the other end of the boat, "Osiris crieth to it."

The Boat of the Lizard-god.

 

On the side of the boat are the signs <span id="img_utchat"></span>
![](img/utchat.jpg) and <span id="img_02502"></span> ![](img/02502.jpg).

The prow of the THIRD BOAT is surmounted by a crown of the South, and
the stern by a crown of the North, and between the two sceptres, which
symbolize the gods ANPU and AP-UAT, i.e., the jackal-headed

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

gods of the South and North, is a huge lizard, from the back of which
spring the head of Osiris and a White Crown. On the side of the boat are
the signs <span id="img_utchat"></span> ![](img/utchat.jpg) and <span
id="img_02502"></span> ![](img/02502.jpg). Above the crown of the North
is the legend U-UR, which, however, probably refers to the sceptre near
it; above the lizard we have

The Boat of the Grain-god Neper.

 

<span id="img_02603"></span> ![](img/02603.jpg) the foremost sceptre
<span id="img_02604"></span> ![](img/02604.jpg), and immediately in
front is <span id="img_02605"></span> ![](img/02605.jpg) and under the
front of the boat is <span id="img_02606"></span> ![](img/02606.jpg).

The prow and stern of the FOURTH BOAT terminate in heads of uraei, each
of which is turned towards the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

deity who is kneeling in the middle of the boat. In the centre kneels a
woman without arms, and before and behind her stands a man, who is
likewise without arms. At each end of the boat grows a plant or,
perhaps, a large ear of wheat, which indicates that the boat is that of
the form of Osiris as the god of vegetation, who is known by the name
NEPER. The legend by the ear of corn in the front of the boat reads,
"the boat which conveyeth Neper," and that by the ear in the stern,
"collector of herbs and plants," The deity in the boat, or the boat
itself perhaps, is called HEPT-MENA-F-TUA-UAA-F. This boat is the boat
of the god NEPER, the god of grain, and a form of Osiris as the god of
vegetation; it may be noted that its side has no *utchat* upon it.

The text referring to the gods in the upper register reads:--

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

"\[Those who are in this picture\] praise this great god after he hath
come forth to them, and behold, it is their words which lead him to
them; they lament when he hath passed onwards, having spoken words to
them. Behold, these gods are they who make the words of those who are
upon earth to reach \[the god\],and it is they who make souls to
approach their forms. Their work consisteth in causing to come into
being the offerings of the night, and in performing the

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

overthrow \[of enemies\] at their hour. It is they who guard the day,
and who bring on the night until this great god cometh forth from out of
the thick darkness to repose in this Court of the eastern horizon of
heaven. They cry out in lamentation to this great god, and they utter
wailings for him after he hath passed by them. Those who know them shall
come forth by day, and he shall be able to journey during the night to
the divisions of the great double city."

The texts which describe the duties of the gods in the lower register
read:--

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

"\[Those who are in this picture give unto this great god the seasons\]
and the years which are in their hands. When this great god hath made
speech with them, they answer him, and they have life through the voice
of this great god, and their throats draw in breath, for when he crieth
to them he ordereth them what they are to do, and he appointeth to them
green herbs in abundance in their field. And they supply with the green
herbs of URNES the gods who are in the following of Ra, and they make
offerings of water to the spirits by the command of this great god, and
they kindle flames of fire in order to burn up the enemies of Ra, and
there is wailing to them, and they lament after this great god hath
passed them by. AM-NEBAUI is the guardian of this Field; whosoever
knoweth \[this\] is in the condition of a spirit equipped with \[words
of power\], and \[the gods\] protect \[him\]."

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

The five lines of text which contain the address of the gods to Ra, and
the answer of the god, read:--

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span> <span id="page_39">p. 39</span> <span
id="page_40">p. 40</span>

The gods of the Tuat speak to this great god as he entereth in with
understanding to the boundary, and he is borne over NET-RA into URNES,
saying, "Hail, thou who risest as a Mighty Soul (KHA-BA-AA), who hast
received \[the things which belong to\] the Tuat, AF, thou guardian of
heaven . . . . . thou livest, O AF, in TA-TESERT. Come thou, and cast
thou thine eye in thy name of Living One, Khepera, at the head of the
Tuat. Traverse thou this Field, O thou who hast might, bind thou with
fetters the HAU serpent, and smite thou the serpent Neha-hra. There is
rejoicing in heaven, and there are shouts of gladness upon the earth at
the entrance of thy (literally, his) body. He who shineth sendeth forth
light, and the URU gods give light \[at dawn; destroy thou\] the

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

darkness which is in AMENT in thy name of SEKHER-SHETAU-UR-A, illumine
thou the thick darkness, O AF. His jawbones are to him, and Ra taketh up
his position in AMENT. Thy boat is to thee, and it is thy right, thou
art guided along, and those who convey thee over the water and who dwell
in the earth make calamities to come upon APEP straightway on thy
behalf. Thy protector is the Star-God (SBA), thou art praised and
adored, thy soul passeth on, thou goest onward and thy body is equipped
with power, and the regions (?) are opened \[to thee\]. The doors of the
hidden land are opened \[before thee\], OSIRIS cometh unto thee, OSIRIS
avengeth thee, and thy word is *maat* against thy enemies. Thou goest to
rest, thou goest to rest in AMENT, and thou comest into being in the
form of KHEPERA in the East."

This great god sendeth forth words to the gods who dwell in the, Tuat
and to those who inhabit URNES, saying, "Open ye your hidden doors so
that the god AF may look \[upon you\] and may throw aside your darkness,
and that ye may draw your water from URNES, and your bread from . . . .
. ., and that wind may come to your nostrils, and that ye may not be
destroyed and overcome by your own foul odour, and that ye may not be
choked by your own dung, and that ye may untie and cast away your
swathings, and that ye may lift up your legs and walk upon them, and
that ye may stretch out your arms, and that your souls may not be made
to remove themselves from

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

you. O ye who live in your forms, and who utter your words of magical
power, who are provided with your swords \[whereby\] ye may hack in
pieces the enemies of Osiris, whose seasons are permanent, whose years
are well established, who pass your state of being \[in\] your hours,
who dwell in your estates, who have your barley in your bread cakes, who
have loaves of bread made of the grain which is yours, whose word is
*maat*, depart from my boats, and retreat before \[my\] images, \[that
I\] may vivify anew this your Field, the Field . . . . . . living ones.
\[My\] soul is among . . . . . . you who have done battle on my behalf,
who have protected me against Apep, who have life through my soul, who
have being through my bodies, who stablish your seats of holiness which
have been decreed to you that ye may exist therein, \[who are with your
souls\] by day, who are in my following in the Tuat, when I make my way
through the night and when I destroy the darkness, O grant me your help
so that I may travel on in the following of my eye, and that I may
journey forwards with those who go to my place in the East. Utter ye
cries of joy, O gods of the Tuat, for I avenge you, \[utter ye cries of
joy,\] for I order your destinies."

When they have addressed this god whilst rowing along his boat Am-TA,
they cry out, and they bring him to rest in the Field of the NEPERTIU
gods who are in the following of Osiris. If these scenes be done \[in
writing\] according to the similitudes which are in the

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

hidden place of the palace, and if a man hath knowledge of \[these\]
words . . . . they shall act as magical protectors of a man upon earth,
regularly, unfailingly, and eternally. The name of this hour is
SESHET-MAKET-NEB-S.
