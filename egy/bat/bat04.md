# CHAPTER I.

### THE FIRST DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED NET-RA.

IN the scene that illustrates the FIRST DIVISION of the Tuat, which is
passed through by the Sun-god during the FIRST HOUR of the night, we see
that the centre of the middle section is divided lengthwise into

two parts by a river which flows along it. In the upper part is the boat
of the dead Sun-god AF, who is in the form of a rain-headed man; he
wears a disk upon his head, and stands within a shrine in the SEKTET
boat, i.e., the boat in which the god travels

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

from noon to sunset. In front of the shrine in the boat stand the three
deities, AP-UAT, SA, and the "Lady of the Boat," who wears on her head a
disk and horns. Behind the shrine stand five gods, each having the head
of a man; the names of the first four are HERU-HEKENU, KA-SHU, i.e., the
"double of Shu," NEHES, i.e., the "Look-out," and HU, and the fifth is
the Steersman KHERP. On the high prow of the Sektet boat hangs an object
which is said to be a carpet by some, and a reed mat by others, and on
the side, near the curve of the prow, is an *utchat*. In front of the
boat march:--

1\. The two goddesses MAAT, the one representing the South of Egypt, and
the other the North.

2\. The god NEKENT-F, who holds a spear, or knife, in his left hand.

3\. The god KHENTI AMENTET, bearded, and in mummy form, and wearing the
White Crown and the Menat.

4\. The god SEKHET, or as it is written here SEKHMET, lioness-headed.

5\. The god SEHETCH-UR, ram-headed.

6\. Four Terms, the first of which is called UT-METU-RA,

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

the second UT-METU-TEM, the third UT-METU-KHEPERA, and the fourth
UT-METU-ASAR.

7\. The leader of the company, who is called TCHA-UNNUT; by his side is
a serpent, called SA (?), that stands on his tail.

 

<span id="img_00500"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

The gods Khenti-Amentet, Sekhet, Sebeteh-ur, the Four-Terms, and
Teha-Unnut.

 

This scene is explained by the horizontal line of inscription written
above it, and the hieroglyphic text, based on the editions of Lefébure
and Champollion, reads:--

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

"The name of this Field is 'MAATI.' This god arriveth in the SEKTET
BOAT, he maketh a way through the Court of this city, which is two
hundred and twenty measures in length, which he travelleth through to
URNES. He passeth through the water, which is three hundred measures in
extent, and he bestoweth the fields upon the gods who follow him. NET-RA
is the name of this Field, ARNEBAUI is the name of the guardian \[of
this Field\]. This god beginneth to declare in this region the words
which perform the destinies (?) of those who are in the Tuat."

In the lower part of the middle section of the scene we have another
boat, in the centre. of which is a beetle; on one side of the beetle is
a god with his knees in the direction of the prow of the boat, but
having his head turned behind him and his hands raised in adoration of
the beetle, and on the other is a god who also has his hands raised in
adoration of the same object. The legend reads "the coming into being of
Osiris"; as the boat has

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

no reed mat or carpet hanging from the prow, we may assume that it is
intended to represent the Atet or Matet Boat, i.e., the boat in which
the Sun-god travelled over the sky from sunrise to noon.

The Boat of the Birth of Osiris, with serpents and gods.

 

\[paragraph continues\] In front of the boat glide three serpents, which
are called SEK-RE, SEFA, and NEPEN, and in front of these march four
man-headed

god called NABTI, who holds a crook in each hand, NET, or NEITH, goddess

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

of the South, NET, or NEITH, goddess of the North, and the goat goddess
ARTET. The two hawk-headed gods are called TCHATUI and METI, and the
four following gods ABENTI, BENBETI, SEKHTI, and SEKHET (?).

The explanation of this scene is given by the horizontal line of
hieroglyphic text written above it, which reads:--

"\[The god cometh to\] this Court, he passeth through it in the form of
a ram, and he maketh his transformations therein. After he hath passed
through this Court, the dead who are in his following do not \[go with
him\], but they remain in this Court, and he speaketh

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

according to the ordinances of the hidden house, and after the manner of

The Address which the Sun-god makes to the gods in the First Division of
the Tuat reads: <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)--

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span> <span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

The Majesty of this god standeth up after he hath taken up his position
in this Court, and he addresseth words to the gods who are therein,
saying, "Open ye to me your doors, and let me come into your Courts!
Give ye light unto me, and make ye yourselves guides to me, O ye who
came into being, from my members, my word hath gone forth to you. Ye are
made of my bodies, I have made you, having fashioned you of my soul, I
have created you, I have made you by means

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

of my enchantments, \[and\] I have come to avenge myself the blood of my
members which have risen up against me, and I will bring to destruction
that which hath been made for it. I will make perfect with the . . . . .
. of my forms Osiris Khenti Amenti. Open to me the doors with your
hands, O ye Apes, unfold to me the portals of the Courts, O ye Apes,
\[and welcome\] the gods (or, goddesses) who have come into being from
my divine Souls, come ye into being, come ye into being for(?) KHEPERA,
O ye who have your being at the head of the Tuat. Stand ye up, in URNES,
and stablish ye yourselves on the secret banks thereof, and work ye for
the gods of Tuat in the Court which ye guard, possess ye your plans in
your seats, in your domains and in your fields."

The gods of this Court say unto Ra, "O great god, \[the doors\] are
opened to thee, and the portals of the secret Ament are thrown open
before thee, the doors of Nut the great are thrown wide open, illumine
thou the darkness of night (or, thick darkness), provide for that which
is in the place of destruction, and approach thou in thy name of Ra the
place where is OSIRIS KHENTI AMENTI. There is a shout of joy to Ra at
the entrance to the doors of the earth (?). Praise be to thee and make
thou perfect the light, and enter thou \[in through the habitations\] of
the Great Country. The Apes (*ambenti*) open the doors to thee, the Apes
(*amhetetu*) unfold to thee the portals, the serpents sing, and exalt
thee, and the divine serpents

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

lighten thy darkness for thee . . . . . . . O Ra, the goddess of the
hour cometh to thee, the two SOUL GODDESSES tow thee along in thy form,
and thou takest up thy position on the ground of the Field of \[this\]
land. Thou hast taken possession of the night, and thou wilt bring in
the day, and \[thou\] dost likewise make long the hours, and thy boat
cometh to rest. Thou seizest the grain of the god HENBET in thy secret
place (?) NET. Thou openest NET-RA, "thou uncoverest the god TCHEBA, the
uraeus goddesses (*neterit*) of URNES acclaim thee, the uraeus goddesses
(*nehenuit*) ascribe praise to thee, thy word is *maat* against thine
enemies, thou givest tribulations to those who are condemned."

The Majesty of this god uttereth words after he hath come forth into
this Court, he doeth battle at the fortifications thereof, the doors of
this \[Court\] are strong, saying, "Shut \[your doors\] by your bolts.
Come ye to me, advance ye to me, make ye your way \[to me\], and ye
shall abide in your place; take ye up your stand on the banks of the
stream \[URNES\]." This great god passeth them by, and they (i.e., the
gods) wail when he hath gone by them in the FIELD OF URNES. \[The
goddess of\] the hour who guideth \[this great god\] through this Court
is "USHEM-HAT-KHEFTIU-NU-RA,"
