# CHAPTER IX.

### THE NINTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED BEST-ARU-ANKHET-KHEPERU.

HAVING passed through the EIGHTH DIVISION of the Tuat, the boat of the
sun arrives at the NINTH DIVISION, which is passed through by the sun
during the NINTH HOUR of the night. The opening text reads:--

"This great god taketh up his place in this Circle,

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

and he addresseth words from his boat to those who are in it. The divine
sailors join the boat of this great god in this City. The name of the
gate of this City through which this god entereth and taketh up his
place on the stream which is in this City is SAA-EM-KEB; the name of
this City is BEST-ARU-ANKHET-KHEPERU; the name of the Hour of the night
which guideth this great god is TUATET-MAKETET-EN-NEB-S."

The line of text which runs above the upper register reads:--

"The hidden Circle of Amentet, through which this great god travelleth
and taketh up his place in the Tuat. If these things be made with their
names after the manner of this figure which is depicted at the east of
the hidden house of the Tuat, and if a man knoweth their names whilst he
is upon earth, and knoweth their places in Amenti, \[he shall attain

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

to\] his own place in the Tuat, and he shall stand up in all places
which belong to the gods whose voices (or, words) are *maat*, even as
the divine sovereign chiefs (*tchatcha*) of Ra, and the mighty ones of
the palace (Pharaohs?), and \[this knowledge\] shall be of benefit to
him upon earth."

of\] those who are overthrown in the Tuat. It is they who drive back the
serpents of every kind which are on the ground, and which are unknown in
their forms to the god of the Tuat. They make themselves to live by

those advance who endow with magical power the dead by the mystery of
their formulae. Those who know this shall see their magical formulæ, and
shall not pass through their flames."
