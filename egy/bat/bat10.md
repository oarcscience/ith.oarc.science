# CHAPTER VII.

### THE SEVENTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED THEPHET-ASAR.

THE scene that illustrates the SEVENTH DIVISION of the Tuat, which is
passed through by the Sun-god during the SEVENTH HOUR of the Right, is
introduced by three lines of text, which read:--

"The Majesty of this great god taketh up his abode in the Hall of
Osiris, and the Majesty of this god

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

addresseth words to the Hall of the gods who dwell therein. This god
performeth all the rites proper \[for entering\] this Hall, and he
advanceth on his way [against](errata.htm#0.md) Apep by means of the words
of power of Isis, and by means of the words of power of the Sovereign
God. The name of the gate of this City wherethrough passeth this god is
RUTI-ASAR. The name of this City is THEPHET-SHETA. The name of the hour
of the night which guideth this great god into it is
KHEFTES-HAU-HESQET-\[NEHA\]-HRA."

The Boat of Af, the dead Sun-god, in the Seventh Hour.

 

In the middle register are:--

1\. The boat of Ra, who stands under a canopy formed by the body of the
serpent MEHEN; the god is ram-headed and wears a disk on his head, and
his name AFU is written twice near him. In front of him stand HEKA-SER
and SA, and ISIS, who has both arms stretched out before her, and is
reciting the words of power which shall make the boat to advance.

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

Behind the god stand HERU-HEKEN, KA-SHU, NEHES, HU, and the "protector
of the boat." Above the boat is written:--"This great god journeyeth in
this City in the path of the Circle of SAR (Osiris) by means of the
utterances of the words of power of Isis and of the words of power of
SER, so that he may journey on his way against NEHA-HRA. If these words
of power of Isis, and those of SER be uttered, APEP shall be turned back
and shall be shut up in Ament, in the hidden place of the Tuat; if they
be uttered on the earth it shall be so likewise. Whosoever shall utter
them shall become one of those who are in the boat of Ra, both in heaven
and upon earth; but whosoever knoweth not these figures shall not know
how to repulse NEHA-HRA."

2\. The serpent NEHA-HRA, which is transfixed to the ground by means of
six knives. The goddess SERQET stands with a band round his neck in the
act of

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

strangling him, and the god HER-TESU-F stands by his tail, round which
he is tying a fetter. The text which refers to him reads:

"He who is in this picture is Apep, and he surroundeth his country,
which is in the Tuat; TCHAU is the name of this district, which is four
hundred and forty cubits

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

in length, and four hundred and forty cubits in breadth, and his voice
guideth the gods to him. He who is with (?) him after this great god
hath made his passage through this City, halteth (?) with AFU, opposite
to the country whereover he would make a way; behold, SERQET is at the
head \[of Apep\], and HER-TESU-F placeth his deadly fetter about his
feet after Isis hath taken possession of the words of power of SER of
two-fold strength, \[and Ra\] giveth their it words of power. Whosoever
knoweth it (i.e., this picture and the text) upon earth shall not be one
of those of whose water NEHA-HRA drinketh."

\[paragraph continues\] "The goddesses who hack at Apep in the Tuat, who

Apep in the Tuat each day."

7-10. The four coffers of Osiris, concerning which it is said: "\[These
are the\] hidden magical figures of the Tuat, the funeral shrines of the
hidden heads. \[When\] those who reached this region \[come there, the
hidden heads\] appear, \[and when they have heard the voice of RA\] they
eat their own forms, after this great god hath passed them by." The line
of hieroglyphics above the upper register reads:

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

the words of power of Isis, and by means of the words of power of SEMSU
(?), and the utterances of this great god himself \[act as\] magical
protectors, and perform the slaughters of APEP in the Tuat, in this
Circle in his windings in the sky. Whosoever shall make \[a copy of\]
these \[pictures\] according to the similitudes which are in writing at
the northern side of the hidden palace in the Tuat they shall act for
him that maketh them as magical protectors in heaven and in earth.
Whosoever knoweth them shall be as the SPIRITS with Ra."

which is formed by the body of a monster serpent called
ANKH-ARU-TCHEFAU-ANKH-ARU. The text which refers to the first three gods
reads: "The Majesty of this great and holy god saith, Grant thou me to
come forth on the path by thy spittle(?) and by \[thy\] throat and let
me utter the word which is *maat* to Ankhit, and let me open thy fold,
for I have come to illumine the darkness, and to embrace him that is in
Mehen." The text which refers to AFU-ASAR reads:

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

on their arrival before thee. Thine enemies are beneath thy feet, thou
hast gained the mastery over those who have worked against thee. The
flames \[of fire\] are against them, he burneth them up with his blazing
knife which is over them, he hacketh them in pieces and choppeth them up
with his slaughtering knife, and he reckoneth up his members each day. O
let me pass over thee in peace."

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>
