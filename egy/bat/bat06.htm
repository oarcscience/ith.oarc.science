<P>during the THIRD HOUR of the night, we see the boat of the god making its way over the waters of the river</P>
<P><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></P>
<P>in the underworld. The dead Sun-god AF stands within a shrine in the form of a ram-headed man, as before, but there is a change in the composition of the crew, which now consists only of four mariners, two of whom stand before the shrine and two behind, and the goddess of the hour and a hawk-beaded deity, one of</P>

<P>the forms of Horus, who is occupied in tying loops of rope to the elongated hawk-headed rowlocks in which the paddles may be worked. The boat of AF follows in the train of three boats, which may be thus described:--</P>
<P>The foremost boat is called UAA-PENAT,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_46"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 46</FONT></A></P>
<P>i.e., "The boat which capsizeth"; it contains three hawk-headed forms of the god Horus, and is steered by two male figures, who stand one in the bows and the other at the stern. In the middle of the boat stand the hawk-god BAK, and the hawk-goddess BAKET, and behind them, standing on a snake, is the</P>

<P>third form of Horus. Between the front steersman and BAKET is the serpent TEKA-HRA, i.e., "Fiery face," and the aft steersman bears a name of similar meaning, NAB-HRA.</P>
<P>The second boat is called UAA-HERER,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_47"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 47</FONT></A></P>
<P>i.e., "The boat of Rest," and has in the middle an Osiris god in the form of a mummy; each end of the boat terminates in the head of a cynocephalus, and it is steered by two beings, one of whom is called TESEM-HRA-F, i.e., "He whose face is like a knife," and the other KHEN-EN-URT-F,</P>
