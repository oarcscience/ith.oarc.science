### THE THIRD DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED NET-NEB-UA-KHEPER-AUT.

IN the scene which illustrates the THIRD DIVISION of the Tuat, which is
passed through by the Sun-god

The Boat of Af, the dead Sun-god, in the Third Hour.

 

during the THIRD HOUR of the night, we see the boat of the god making
its way over the waters of the river

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

in the underworld. The dead Sun-god AF stands within a shrine in the
form of a ram-headed man, as before, but there is a change in the
composition of the crew, which now consists only of four mariners, two
of whom stand before the shrine and two behind, and the goddess of the
hour and a hawk-beaded deity, one of

the forms of Horus, who is occupied in tying loops of rope to the
elongated hawk-headed rowlocks in which the paddles may be worked. The
boat of AF follows in the train of three boats, which may be thus
described:--

The foremost boat is called UAA-PENAT,

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

i.e., "The boat which capsizeth"; it contains three hawk-headed forms of
the god Horus, and is steered by two male figures, who stand one in the
bows and the other at the stern. In the middle of the boat stand the
hawk-god BAK, and the hawk-goddess BAKET, and behind them, standing on a
snake, is the

 

<span id="img_04600"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

The Boat of Rest.

 

third form of Horus. Between the front steersman and BAKET is the
serpent TEKA-HRA, i.e., "Fiery face," and the aft steersman bears a name
of similar meaning, NAB-HRA.

The second boat is called UAA-HERER,

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

i.e., "The boat of Rest," and has in the middle an Osiris god in the
form of a mummy; each end of the boat terminates in the head of a
cynocephalus, and it is steered by two beings, one of whom is called
TESEM-HRA-F, i.e., "He whose face is like a knife," and the other
KHEN-EN-URT-F,

 

<span id="img_04700"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/04700.jpg.md)  
The Boat of the Branch.

 

i.e., "The ferryman who resteth not." The Osiris god stands between two
gods, one of whom is called AU-MATU, and the serpent which stands on its
tail between the steersman in the bows and the first god is called
SET-EM-HRA-F.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

The third boat is called PA-KHET, "The Branch," and each end terminates
in the head of a lion. In the middle of it stands the form of Osiris,
who is called SHEFSHEF, and he wears on his head a pair of ram's horns;
his arms and the upper

portion of his body are swathed. Behind him stands the mummied form
called AM-TA, and before him the god NEB-UAST. Of the two steersmen,
only the name of the second, KHEN, or KHENNU is given; the name of the
serpent

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

which stands on its tail is SET-EM-MAAT-F.

The procession of boats is met by four forms of Osiris, who stand with
the upper portion of their bodies swathed. Their names are:--1. NEB-NET,
2. MENI, ARA-TCHERU, 4. MAA-TCHERU.

The text written above the boats reads:--

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

"This great god journeyeth over NET-NEB-UA-KHEPER-AUT (i.e., the Water
of the Lord One, the Creator of food). \[He who is in\] this picture
transporteth the boats which are in the earth, and he paddleth Osiris to
this City. This great god resteth for a period in this City, and he
sendeth forth his voice to Osiris, and to those who are in his
following, and \[then\] these hidden boats guide him into this Field.
This great god paddleth through this Field towards the Hour TENT-BAIU,
and these boats journey round to the district of THETTU, after
traversing this City. Whosoever knoweth these things shall have both his
habitation and his bread with Ra."

over them, and their shadows are united unto them, and after this great
god hath addressed them, they speak to him, and they say words of praise
to him, and they weep after he hath passed them by. The work which is
theirs in Amentet is to take vengeance upon the Seba fiend of Ra, to
make Nu to come into being, to make Hap (i.e., the Nile) to flow, and

he hath come forth in the earth from them, they send forth their voice,

hands.

The text relating to the above reads:--

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

"Those who are in this picture \[and those who are in\] the house of TET
praise this great god, and when this great god hath sent forth words to
them, they come to life, for when he hath called to them and hath sent
forth his words to them \[they have\] their water, and they receive
their due (literally, heads) in addition to the utterance of his mouth.
The work which they have to do in Ament is to hew and to hack souls in
pieces, and set restraint upon shadows, and to destroy such doomed
beings as have their being in their place of destruction which blazeth
with

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

fire. They send forth flames and they cause fires to spring up, and the
enemies are as those who have their knives over (or, on) their heads.
They wail and they lament when this great god hath passed them by. The
name of the warder of this Field is KHETRA. Whosoever knoweth this shall
be in the condition of a spirit who hath dominion over his legs."

M. Maspero, in his description of the THIRD HOUR, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

includes an extract from the speech which the Sun-god Ra makes to the
inhabitants of NET-NEB-UA-KHEPER-AUT; as he points out, though three
copies of the speech are extant, all are mutilated (see Lefébure,

Le Tombeau de Seti I<sup>er</sup>., 1<sup>re</sup> partie, pll.
xv.-xvii., pll. xviii.-xx., and pl. xxii.), and it is impossible at
present to reconstruct the text, although the general meaning of several
sentences is clear enough.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[60:1](bat06.htm#fr_1.md) The portions rendered by
M. Maspero read thus:--Ce grand dieu dit aux *Biou shetiou* (Ames
mystérieuses) qui suivent Osiris: "O vous dont j'ai rendu mystérieuses,
dont j'ai occulté les âmes, que j'ai mis à la suite d'Osiris pour le
défendre, pour escorter ses images, pour anéantir ceux qui l'attaquent,
si bien que le dieu Hon est à toi, ô Osiris, derrière toi, pour te
défendre, pour escorter tes images, pour anéantir ceux qui l'attaquent,
si bien que Hon est à toi, ô Osiris, que Sa est à toi, ô Khontamentit,
vous dont les formes sont stables, vous dont les rites assurent
l'existence, vous qui respirez l'air \[de vos narines, qui voyez\] de
vos faces, qui écoutez de vos oreilles, qui êtes coiffés de vos coufièh,
qui êtes vêtus de vos bandelettes, qui avez des revenus d'offrandes à
vous sur terre par l'office des prêtres du dieu, qui avez des champs à
vous de votre propre domaine, vous dont les âmes ne sont point
renversées, dont les corps ne sont point culbutés, ouvrez vos cercles et
tenez-vous à vos places, car je suis venu pour voir mes corps, inspecter
mes images qui sont dans l'autre monde, et vous m'avez convoyé pour me
permettre de leur apporter mon aide, si bien que je conduis à la rame
ton âme au ciel, ô Osiris, ton âme à la terre, ô Khontaougrit, avec tes
dieux derrière toi, tes mânes devant toi, ton être et tes formes \[sur
toi?\], et alors ton mâne est enchanté, ô Osiris, vos mânes sont
enchantés, ô vous qui suivez Osiris. Je monte en terre et le jour est
derrière moi; je traverse la nuit, et mon âme se réunit à vos formes
pendant le jour, j'accomplis de nuit les rites qui vous sont
nécessaires, j'ai créé vos âmes pour moi, afin qu'elles soient derrière
moi, et ce que j'ai fait pour elles vous empêche de tomber au lieu
d'anéantissement."
