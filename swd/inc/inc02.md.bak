### Invitation to the New Church

<span class="margnote"><span id="51.">51.</span></span>

That it is allowable to confirm the truths of the church by reason or by
the understanding, as much as it pleases, and also by various things in
nature; and in proportion as truths are so confirmed, they become rooted
and shine. It is also allowable to confirm truths by the Word, wherever
it pleases, and also to apply for this purpose many things from the
Word; and then the Word is not falsified thereby. Those expressions of
Scripture through which truths are confirmed, ascend into heaven; they
are like the fumes of frankincense; but on the other hand if falsities
are confirmed from the Word, they do not ascend into heaven, but are
rejected; and they are dispersed on the way with a loud report. This I
have heard thousands of times.

The manifestation of the Lord, and intromission into the spiritual
world, surpass all miracles. This has not been granted to anyone since
the creation, as it has been to me. The men of the golden age, indeed,
conversed with the angels; but it was not granted to them to be in any
other than natural light; but to me it is granted to be in both
spiritual and natural light at the same time. By this means it has been
granted to me to see the wonderful things of heaven, to be together with
the angels like one of them, and at the same time to draw forth truths
in light, and thus to perceive and teach them; consequently to be led by
the Lord. But as concerns miracles, they would have been nothing else
than snares for seducing men; as the Lord says (Matt. 24:24); and as is
related of the magician Simon, that: He bewitched the nations in
Samaria, who believed that these things were done from the great power
of God (Acts 8:9 seq.). What else are the miracles among the Papists,
than snares and deceptions? What else do they teach, than that they
themselves should be worshipped as deities, and that they should recede
from the worship of the Lord? Have wonder-working images any other
effect? Have the idols or corpses of saints throughout the papal
dominion any other purpose? Those of Anthony of Padua, of the three wise
men at Cologne, and of all the rest, whose miracles fill the
monasteries? What have these miracles taught concerning Christ? What
concerning heaven and life eternal? Not a syllable.

That it is impossible for any church, and for any system of religion to
exist, unless it is believed that God is one. When, therefore, the
Divine Trinity is believed to be divided into three Persons, how can the
metaphysical term essence make one out of three? So long as the
properties of each person are diverse, yea, so diverse that they are
said not to be communicable? And so long as the equal and particular
persons subsist by themselves, and one person has no part and no quality
in the other person, or of the other person? But when it is believed
that the one God is not only the Creator, but also the Redeemer and
Operator, then we have one God; and then for the first time the church
exists and subsists, and religion lives. And thus union of three cannot
be given otherwise, than it is in every man, as soul, body, and
proceeding. These three make one man: why not God, who is Himself the
Man from firsts to ultimates? These things concerning God Man have been
explained in Divine Love and Wisdom, and may be consulted. It is also
shown that \[the soul\] is neither ether, nor air, nor wind; that the
soul of every man is the man himself, follows thence. As we have now one
God in the church, who is God Man and Man God, this church is called the
crown of all the churches.

That in Christ man is God is to be shown from three places in the
Formula Concordiae (from Paul, Rom. 14:11; Col. 2:9; from John's first
Epistle 5:20-21), and from the Lord's words that: 1. God was the Word,
and the Word was made flesh. 2. All things of the Father are His. 3. All
of the Father come to Him. 4. As the Father hath life in Himself, so has
the Son (Life in Himself is God). 5. The Father and He are one. 6. He is
in the Father, and the Father in Him. 7. He who seeth Him, seeth the
Father. 8. He is the God of heaven and earth. 9. He governs the
universe. (From the Creed.) 10. He is called "Jehovah, the Redeemer."
11. He is called "Jehovah, our Righteousness." 12. It is said that
"Jehovah would come into the world." 13. In the Apocalypse (Chap. 1) it
is said, that He is "the first and the Last." 14. In a word, He is God
the Father who is invisible, in the Human which is visible before minds.
Because there is thus One God in the church, the church is the church,
etc., etc. From the Athanasian Creed it is said: As the soul and body is
one man: so God and Man in Christ is one Person; then that the Human
Nature was taken into God.

CONCERNING MIRACLES. (From the sons of Israel.) (From the Lord's words
concerning Dives and Lazarus.) (From the Lord's words, Matt. 24:24.) The
Papal miracles (which are to be enumerated). That they only seduce, and
do not teach anything; their sole purpose is that they may be invoked as
deities; and indeed to this end that gold and silver may be brought to
the monasteries; that is, that they may scrape together the treasures of
the whole world. The miracles of many of them, as of Anthony at Padua;
those by the three wise men at Cologne; those of the wonder-working
images, at which treasures are collected, everywhere in the monasteries,
where the walls are covered with pictures of the miracles wrought by
their saints, and their idols; the books concerning the miracles of
Paris and others. What other purpose have they, than that they may be
invoked, to the end that gifts may be scraped together? But who among
them has thus far taught the way to heaven, and the truths of the church
out of the Word? For this reason it has pleased the Lord to prepare me
from my earliest youth to perceive the Word, and He has introduced me
into the spiritual world, and has enlightened me with the light of His
Word more proximately. From this it is manifest that this surpasses all
miracles. Beelzebub did more miracles than other Gentile gods, as is
evident from the Old Testament; and also the magician Simon.

That the Lord made the Natural Man in Himself Divine, in order that He
might be the First and the Last; and that He might thus enter with men
even into their natural man, and might teach and lead it from the Word.
For He rose with His whole natural or external man, and did not leave
anything of it in the sepulcher; on which account He said that He had
bones and flesh, which spirits have not; and \[hence it is\] that He ate
and drank with His disciples of natural food, and in their sight. That
He was Divine, He showed by passing through doors, and by becoming
invisible, which never could have been done, unless His Natural Man
itself also had been made Divine with Him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="57.">57.</span></span>

That all those things which the orthodox at the present day say
concerning the sending of the Holy Spirit fall to the ground, as soon as
it is known that the Lord is constantly present with every man, and
causes the man to live; and that He resides with man in order that he
may go and meet the Lord; and that even if he does not go and meet the
Lord, he still has rationality, which would be impossible without the
Lord's presence. If the Lord were absent from man, the man would not be
a beast, but like some corpse which would be dissipated. This is meant
in Genesis by: God breathed into him a living soul (Gen. 2:7).

<span class="margnote"><span id="58.">58.</span></span>

It shall here be shown from the Word, that the Lord is the "Kingdom of
God"; thus, that He is heaven and the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="59.">59.</span></span>

It shall be shown that the greatest power is in correspondences; because
in them heaven and the world, or the spiritual and the natural, are
together. That for this reason the Word was written by mere
correspondences; wherefore, through it there is the conjunction of man
with heaven, and thus with the Lord. The Lord also by this means is in
firsts and at the same time in ultimates. On this account the sacraments
have been instituted through correspondences, and therefore there is the
Divine power in them.
