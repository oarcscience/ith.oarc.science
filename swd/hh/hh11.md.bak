### Heaven and Hell

<span class="margnote"><span id="501.">501.</span></span>

Let it be understood that man is wholly such as his interiors are, and
not such as his exteriors are separate from his interiors. This is
because his interiors belong to his spirit, and the life of his spirit
is the life of man, for from it his body lives; and because of this such
as a man's interiors are such he continues to be to eternity. But as the
exteriors pertain to the body they are separated after death, and those
of them that adhere to the spirit are laid asleep, and serve purely as a
plane for the interiors, as has been shown above in treating of the
memory of man which continues after death. This makes evident what is
man's own and what is not his own, namely, that with the evil man
nothing that belongs to his exterior thought from which he speaks, or to
the exterior will from which he acts, is his own, but only that which
belongs to his interior thought and will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="502.">502.</span></span>

When the first state, which is the state of the exteriors treated of in
the preceding chapter, has been passed through, the man-spirit is let
into the state of his interiors, or into the state of his interior will
and its thought, in which he had been in the world when left to himself
to think freely and without restraint. Into this state he unconsciously
glides, just as when in the world he withdraws the thought nearest to
his speech, that is, from which he speaks, towards his interior thought
and abides in the latter. Therefore in this state of his interiors the
man-spirit is in himself and in his very life; for to think freely from
his own affection is the very life of man, and is himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="503.">503.</span></span>

In this state the spirit thinks from his very will, thus from his very
affection, or from his very love; and thought and will then make one,
and one in such a manner that he seems scarcely to think but only to
will. It is nearly the same when he speaks, yet with the difference that
he speaks with a kind of fear that the thoughts of the will may go forth
naked, since by his social life in the world this has come to be a part
of his will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="504.">504.</span></span>

All men without exception are let into this state after death, because
it is their spirit's own state. The former state is such as the man was
in regard to his spirit when in company; and that is not his own state.
That this state, namely, the state of the exteriors into which man first
comes after death (as shown in the preceding chapter) is not his own
state, many things show, for example, that spirits not only think but
also speak from their affection, since their speech is from their
affection (as has been said and shown in the chapter on the speech of
angels, n. 234-245). It was in this way that man had thought while in
the world when he was thinking within himself, for at such times his
thought was not from his bodily words, but he \[mentally\] saw the
things, and in a minute of time saw more than he could afterwards utter
in half an hour. Again that the state of the exteriors is not man's own
state or the state of his spirit is evident from the fact that when he
is in company in the world he speaks in accord with the laws of moral
and civil life, and at such times interior thought rules the exterior
thought, as one person rules another, to keep him from transgressing the
limits of decorum and good manners. It is evident also from the fact
that when a man thinks within himself, he thinks how he must speak and
act in order to please and to secure friendship, good will, and favor,
and this in extraneous ways, that is, otherwise than he would do if he
acted in accordance with his own will. All this shows that the state of
the interiors that the spirit is let into is his own state, and was his
own state when he was living in the world as a man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="505.">505.</span></span>

When the spirit is in the state of his interiors it becomes clearly
evident what the man was in himself when he was in the world, for at
such times he acts from what is his own. He that had been in the world
interiorly in good then acts rationally and wisely, and even more wisely
than in the world, because he is released from connection with the body,
and thus from those earthly things that caused obscurity and interposed
as it were a cloud. But he that was in evil in the world then acts
foolishly and insanely, and even more insanely than in the world,
because he is free and under no restraint. For while he lived in the
world he was sane in outward appearance, since by means of externals he
made himself appear to be a rational man; but when he has been stripped
of his externals his insanities are revealed. An evil man who in
externals takes on the semblance of a good man may be likened to a
vessel shining and polished on the outside and covered with a lid,
within which filth of all kinds is hidden, in accordance with the Lord's
saying: Ye are like whited sepulchers, which outwardly appear beautiful,
but inwardly are full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness (Matt.
23:27).

<span class="margnote"><span id="506.">506.</span></span>

All that have lived a good life in the world and have acted from
conscience, who are such as have acknowledged the Divine and have loved
Divine truths, especially such as have applied those truths to life,
seem to themselves, when let into the state of their interiors, like one
aroused from sleep into full wakefulness, or like one passing from
darkness into light. They then think from the light of heaven, thus from
an interior wisdom, and they act from good, thus from an interior
affection. Heaven flows into their thoughts and affections with an
interior blessedness and delight that they had previously had no
knowledge of; for they have communication with the angels of heaven.
They then acknowledge the Lord and worship Him from their very life, for
being in the state of their interiors they are in their proper life (as
has been said just above, n. 505); and as freedom pertains to interior
affection they then acknowledge and worship the Lord from freedom. Thus,
too, they withdraw from external sanctity and come into that internal
sanctity in which worship itself truly consists. Such is the state of
those that have lived a Christian life in accordance with the
commandments in the Word. \[2\] But the state of those that have lived
an evil life in the world and who have had no conscience, and have in
consequence denied the Divine, is the direct opposite of this. For
everyone who lives an evil life, inwardly in himself denies the Divine,
however much he may suppose when in external thought that he
acknowledges the Lord and does not deny Him; for acknowledging the
Divine and living an evil life are opposites. When such in the other
life enter into the state of their interiors, and are heard speaking and
seen acting, they appear foolish; for from their evil lusts they burst
forth into all sorts of abominations, into contempt of others, ridicule
and blasphemy, hatred and revenge; they plot intrigues, some with a
cunning and malice that can scarcely be believed to be possible in any
man. For they are then in a state of freedom to act in harmony with the
thoughts of their will, since they are separated from the outward
conditions that restrained and checked them in the world. In a word,
they are deprived of their rationality, because their reason while they
were in the world did not have its seat in their interiors, but in their
exteriors; and yet they seemed to themselves to be wiser than others.
\[3\] This being their character, while in the second state they are let
down by short intervals into the state of their exteriors, and into a
recollection of their actions when they were in the state of their
interiors; and some of them then feel ashamed, and confess that they
have been insane; some do not feel ashamed; and some are angry because
they are not permitted to remain permanently in the state of their
exteriors. But these are shown what they would be if they were to
continue in that state, namely, that they would attempt to accomplish in
secret ways the same evil ends, and by semblances of goodness, honesty,
and justice, would mislead the simple in heart and faith, and would
utterly destroy themselves; for their exteriors would at length burn
with the same fire as their interiors, and their whole life would be
consumed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="507.">507.</span></span>

When in this second state spirits become visibly just what they had been
in themselves while in the world, what they then did and said secretly
being now made manifest; for they are now restrained by no outward
considerations, and therefore what they have said and done secretly they
now say and endeavor to do openly, having no longer any fear of loss of
reputation, such as they had in the world. They are also brought into
many states of their evils, that what they are may be evident to angels
and good spirits. Thus are hidden things laid open and secret things
uncovered, in accordance with the Lord's words: There is nothing covered
up that shall not be revealed, and hid that shall not be known.
Whatsoever ye have said in the darkness shall be heard in the light, and
what ye have spoken in the ear in the inner chambers shall be proclaimed
on the housetops (Luke 12:2, 3). And elsewhere: I say unto you, that
every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in
the day of judgment (Matt. 12:36).

<span class="margnote"><span id="508.">508.</span></span>

The nature of the wicked in this state cannot be described in a few
words, for each one is insane in accord with his own lusts, and these
are various; therefore I will merely mention some special instances from
which conclusions may be formed respecting the rest. Those that have
loved themselves above everything, and in their occupations and
employments have looked to their own honor, and have performed uses and
found delight in them not for the use's sake but for the sake of
reputation, that they might because of them be esteemed more worthy than
others, and have thus been fascinated by their reputation for honor, are
more stupid in this second state than others; for so far as one loves
himself he is separated from heaven, and so far as he is separated from
heaven he is separated from wisdom. \[2\] But those that have not only
been in self-love but have been crafty also, and have raised themselves
to honors by means of crafty practices, affiliate themselves with the
worst of spirits, and learn magic arts, which are abuses of Divine
order, and by means of these they assail and infest all who do not honor
them, laying snares, fomenting hatred, burning with revenge, and are
eager to vent their rage on all who do not yield to them; and they rush
into all these enormities so far as their fiendish companions favor
them; and at length they meditate upon how they can climb up into heaven
to destroy it, or be worshiped there as gods. To such length does their
madness carry them. \[3\] Papists of this character are more insane than
the rest, for they cherish the notion that heaven and hell are subject
to their power, and that they can remit sins at pleasure, claiming to
themselves all that is Divine, and calling themselves Christ. This
persuasion is such with them that wherever it flows in it disturbs the
mind and induces darkness even to pain. Such are nearly the same in both
the first and the second state; but in the second they are without
rationality. Of their insanities and their lot after this state some
particulars will be given in the treatise on The Last Judgement and the
Destruction of Babylon. \[4\] Those that have attributed creation to
nature, and have therefore in heart if not with the lips denied the
Divine, and thus all things of the church and of heaven, affiliate with
their like in this second state, and call everyone a god who excels in
craftiness, worshiping him even with Divine honors. I have seen such in
an assembly adoring a magician, debating about nature, and behaving like
fools, as if they were beasts under a human form, while among them there
were some who in the world had been in stations of dignity, and some who
had been esteemed learned and wise. So with others in other states.
\[5\] From these few instances it may be inferred what those are who
have the interiors of their minds closed heaven- wards, as is the case
with all who have received no influx out of heaven through
acknowledgment of the Divine and a life of faith. Everyone can judge
from himself how he would act if, being such, he were left free to act
with no fear of the law and no fear in regard to his life, and with no
outward restraints, such as fear of injury to one's reputation or of
loss of honor and gain and consequent pleasures. \[6\] Nevertheless, the
insanity of such is restrained by the Lord that it may not rush beyond
the limits of use; for even such spirits perform some use. In them good
spirits see what evil is and its nature, and what man is when he is not
led by the Lord. Another of their uses is their collecting together evil
spirits like themselves and separating them from the good; and another,
that the truths and goods that the evil had outwardly professed and
feigned are taken away from them, and they are brought into the evils of
their life and the falsities of their evil, and are thus prepared for
hell. \[7\] For no one enters hell until he is in his own evil and the
falsities of evil, since no one is permitted there to have a divided
mind, that is, to think and speak one thing and to will another. Every
evil spirit there must think what is false from evil, and speak from the
falsity of evil, in both respects from the will, thus from his own
essential love and its delight and pleasure, in the same way that he
thought while in the world when he was in his spirit, that is, in the
same way as he thought in himself when he thought from interior
affection. The reason is that the will is the man himself, and not the
thought except so far as it partakes of the will, the will being the
very nature itself or disposition of the man. Therefore man's being let
into his will is being let into his nature or disposition, and likewise
into his life; for by his life man puts on a nature; and after death he
continues to be such as the nature is that he has acquired by his life
in the world; and with the evil this nature can no longer be amended and
changed by means of the thought or by the understanding of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="509.">509.</span></span>

When evil spirits are in this second state, as they rush into evils of
every kind they are subjected to frequent and grievous punishments. In
the world of spirits there are many kinds of punishment; and there is no
regard for person, whether one had been in the world a king or a
servant. Every evil carries its punishment with it, the two making one;
therefore whoever is in evil is also in the punishment of evil. And yet
no one in the other world suffers punishment on account of the evils
that he had done in this world, but only on account of the evils that he
then does; although it amounts to the same and is the same thing whether
it be said that men suffer punishment on account of their evils in the
world or that they suffer punishment on account of the evils they do in
the other life, since everyone after death returns into his own life and
thus into like evils; and the man continues the same as he had been in
the life of the body (n. 470-484). Men are punished for the reason that
the fear of punishment is the sole means of subduing evils in this
state. Exhortation is no longer of any avail, neither is instruction or
fear of the law and of the loss of reputation, since everyone then acts
from his nature; and that nature can be restrained and broken only by
punishments. But good spirits, although they had done evils in the
world, are never punished, because their evils do not return. Moreover,
I have learned that the evils they did were of a different kind or
nature, not being done purposely in opposition to the truth, or from any
other badness of heart than that which they received by inheritance from
their parents, and that they were borne into this by a blind delight
when they were in externals separate from internals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="510.">510.</span></span>

Everyone goes to his own society in which his spirit had been in the
world; for every man, as regards his spirit, is conjoined to some
society, either infernal or heavenly, the evil man to an infernal
society and the good man to a heavenly society, and to that society he
is brought after death (see n. 438). The spirit is led to his society
gradually, and at length enters it. When an evil spirit is in the state
of his interiors he is turned by degrees toward his own society, and at
length, before that state is ended, directly to it; and when that state
is ended he himself casts himself into the hell where those are who are
like himself. This act of casting down appears to the sight like one
falling headlong with the head downwards and the feet upwards. The cause
of this appearance is that the spirit himself is in an inverted order,
having loved infernal things and rejected heavenly things. In this
second state some evil spirits enter the hells and come out again by
turns; but these do not appear to fall headlong as those do that are
fully vastated. Moreover, the society itself in which they had been as
regards their spirit while in the world is shown to them when they are
in the state of their exteriors, that they may thus learn that even
while in the life of the body they were in hell, although not in the
same state as those that are in hell itself, but in the same state as
those who are in the world of spirits. Of this state, as compared with
those that are in hell, more will be said hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="511.">511.</span></span>

In this second state the separation of evil spirits from good spirits
takes place. For in the first state they are together, since while a
spirit is in his exteriors he is as he was in the world, thus the evil
with the good and the good with the evil; but it is otherwise when he
has been brought into his interiors and left to his own nature or will.
The separation of evil spirits from good spirits is effected by various
means; in general by their being taken about to those societies with
which in their first state they had communication by means of their good
thoughts and affections, thus to those societies that they had induced
to believe by outward appearances that they were not evil. Usually they
are led about through a wide circle, and everywhere what they really are
is made manifest to good spirits. At the sight of them the good spirits
turn away; and at the same time the evil spirits who are being led about
turn their faces away from the good towards that quarter where their
infernal society is, into which they are about to come. Other methods of
separation, which are many, will not now be mentioned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="512.">512.</span></span>

LIII\. THIRD STATE OF MAN AFTER DEATH, WHICH IS A STATE OF INSTRUCTION
FOR THOSE WHO ENTER HEAVEN. The third state of man after death, that is,
of his spirit, is a state of instruction. This state is for those who
enter heaven and become angels. It is not for those who enter hell,
because such are incapable of being taught, and therefore their second
state is also their third, ending in this, that they are wholly turned
to their own love, thus to that infernal society which is in a like
love. When this has been done they will and think from that love and as
that love is infernal they will nothing but what is evil and think
nothing but what is false; and in such thinking and willing they find
their delights, because these belong to their love; and in consequence
of this they reject everything good and true which they had previously
adopted as serviceable to their love as means. \[2\] Good spirits, on
the other hand, are led from the second state into the third, which is
the state of their preparation for heaven by means of instruction. For
one can be prepared for heaven only by means of knowledges of good and
truth, that is, only by means of instruction, since one can know what
spiritual good and truth are, and what evil and falsity are, which are
their opposites, only by being taught. One can learn in the world what
civil and moral good and truth are, which are called justice and
honesty, because there are civil laws in the world that teach what is
just, and there is interaction with others whereby man learns to live in
accordance with moral laws, all of which have relation to what is honest
and right. But spiritual good and truth are learned from heaven, not
from the world. They can be learned from the Word and from the doctrine
of the church that is drawn from the Word and yet unless man in respect
to his interiors which belong to his mind is in heaven spiritual good
and truth cannot flow into his life; and man is in heaven when he both
acknowledges the Divine and acts justly and honestly for the reason that
he ought so to act because it is commanded in the Word. This is living
justly and honestly for the sake of the Divine, and not for the sake of
self and the world, as ends. \[3\] But no one can so act until he has
been taught, for example, that there is a God, that there is a heaven
and a hell, that there is a life after death, that God ought to be loved
supremely, and the neighbor as oneself, and that what is taught in the
Word, ought to be believed because the Word is Divine. Without a
knowledge and acknowledgment of these things man is unable to think
spiritually; and if he has no thought about them he does not will them;
for what a man does not know he cannot think, and what he does not think
he cannot will. So it is when man wills these things that heaven flows
into his life, that is, the Lord through heaven, for the Lord flows into
the will and through the will into the thought, and through both into
the life, and the whole life of man is from these. All this makes clear
that spiritual good and truth are learned not from the world but from
heaven, and that one can be prepared for heaven only by means of
instruction. \[4\] Moreover, so far as the Lord flows into the life of
any one He instructs him, for so far He kindles the will with the love
of knowing truths and enlightens the thought to know them; and so far as
this is done the interiors of man are opened and heaven is implanted in
them; and furthermore, what is Divine and heavenly flows into the honest
things pertaining to moral life and into the just things pertaining to
civil life in man, and makes them spiritual, since man then does these
things from the Divine, which is doing them for the sake of the Divine.
For the things honest and just pertaining to moral and civil life which
a man does from that source are the essential effects of spiritual life;
and the effect derives its all from the effecting cause, since such as
the cause is such is the effect.

<span class="margnote"><span id="513.">513.</span></span>

Instruction is given by the angels of many societies, especially those
in the northern and southern quarters, because those angelic societies
are in intelligence and wisdom from a knowledge of good and truth. The
places of instruction are towards the north and are various, arranged
and distinguished according to the kinds and varieties of heavenly
goods, that all and each may be instructed there according to their
disposition and ability to receive; the places extending round about to
a great distance. The good spirits who are to be instructed are brought
by the Lord to these places when they have completed their second state
in the world of spirits, and yet not all; for there are some that have
been instructed in the world, and have been prepared there by the Lord
for heaven, and these are taken up into heaven by another way-some
immediately after death, some after a short stay with good spirits,
where the grosser things of their thoughts and affections which they had
contracted from honors and riches in the world are removed, and in that
way they are purified. Some first endure vastations, which is effected
in places under the soles of the feet, called the lower earth, where
some suffer severely. These are such as had confirmed themselves in
falsities and yet had led good lives, for when falsities have been
confirmed they inhere with much force, and until they have been
dispersed truths cannot be seen, and thus cannot be accepted. But
vastations and how they are effected have been treated of in the Arcana
Coelestia, from which the notes below have been collected. <span
id="fr_276"></span>[513-1](#fn_276.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="514.">514.</span></span>

All who are in places of instruction dwell apart; for each one is
connected in regard to his interiors with that society of heaven which
he is about to enter; thus as the societies of heaven are arranged in
accord with the heavenly form (see above, n. 200-212), so are the places
there where instruction is given; and for this reason when those places
are viewed from heaven something like a heaven in a smaller form is
seen. They are spread out in length from east to west, and in breadth
from south to north; but the breadth appears to be less than the length.
The arrangement in general is as follows. In front are those who died in
childhood and have been brought up in heaven to the age of early youth;
these after passing the state of their infancy with those having charge
of them, are brought hither by the Lord and instructed. Behind these are
the places where those are taught who died in adult age, and who in the
world had an affection for truth derived from good of life. Again,
behind these are those who in the world were connected with the
Mohammedan religion, and lived a moral life and acknowledged one Divine,
and the Lord as the very Prophet. When these withdraw from Mohammed,
because he can give them no help, they approach the Lord and worship Him
and acknowledge His Divinity, and they are then instructed in the
Christian religion. Behind these more to the north are the places of
instruction of various heathen nations who in the world have lived a
good life in conformity with their religion, and have thereby acquired a
kind of conscience, and have done what is just and right not so much
from a regard to the laws of their government, as from a regard to the
laws of religion, which they believed ought to be sacredly observed, and
in no way violated by their doings. When these have been taught they are
all easily led to acknowledge the Lord, because it is impressed on their
hearts that God is not invisible, but is visible under a human form.
These in number exceed all the rest, and the best of them are from
Africa.

<span class="margnote"><span id="515.">515.</span></span>

But all are not taught in the same way, nor by the same societies of
heaven. Those that have been brought up from childhood in heaven, not
having imbibed falsities from the falsities of religion or defiled their
spiritual life with the dregs pertaining to honors and riches in the
world, receive instruction from the angels of the interior heavens;
while those that have died in adult age receive instruction mainly from
angels of the lowest heaven, because these angels are better suited to
them than the angels of the interior heavens, who are in interior wisdom
which is not yet acceptable to them. But the Mohammedans receive
instruction from angels who had been previously in the same religion and
had been converted to Christianity. The heathen, too, are taught by
their angels.

<span class="margnote"><span id="516.">516.</span></span>

All teaching there is from doctrine drawn from the Word, and not from
the Word apart from doctrine. Christians are taught from heavenly
doctrine, which is in entire agreement with the internal sense of the
Word. All others, as the Mohammedans and heathen, are taught from
doctrines suited to their apprehension, which differ from heavenly
doctrine only in this, that spiritual life is taught by means of moral
life in harmony with the good tenets of their religion from which they
had derived their life in the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="517.">517.</span></span>

Instruction in the heavens differs from instruction on earth in that
knowledges are not committed to memory, but to life; for the memory of
spirits is in their life, for they receive and imbibe everything that is
in harmony with their life, and do not receive, still less imbibe, what
is not in harmony with it; for spirits are affections, and are therefore
in a human form that is similar to their affections. \[2\] Being such
they are constantly animated by an affection for truth that looks to the
uses of life; for the Lord provides for everyone's loving the uses
suited to his genius; and that love is exalted by the hope of becoming
an angel. And as all the uses of heaven have relation to the general
use, which is the good of the Lord's kingdom, which in heaven is the
fatherland, and as all special and particular uses are to be valued in
proportion as they more closely and fully have regard to that general
use, so all of these special and particular uses, which are innumerable,
are good and heavenly; therefore in everyone an affection for truth is
so conjoined with an affection for use that the two make one; and
thereby truth is so implanted in use that the truths they acquire are
truths of use. In this way are angelic spirits taught and prepared for
heaven. \[3\] An affection for truth that is suited to the use is
insinuated by various means, most of which are unknown in the world;
chiefly by representatives of uses which in the spiritual world are
exhibited in a thousand ways, and with such delights and pleasures that
they permeate the spirit from the interiors of its mind to the exteriors
of its body, and thus affect the whole; and in consequence the spirit
becomes as it were his use; and therefore when he comes into his
society, into which he is initiated by instruction, he is in his life by
being in his use. <span id="fr_277"></span>[517-1](#fn_277.md) From all
this it is clear that knowledges, which are external truths, do not
bring any one into heaven; but the life itself, which is a life of uses
implanted by means of knowledges.

<span class="margnote"><span id="518.">518.</span></span>

There were some spirits who had convinced themselves, by thinking about
it in the world, that they would go to heaven and be received before
others because of their learning and their great knowledge of the Word
and of the doctrines of their churches, believing that they were wise in
consequence, and were such as are meant by those of whom it is said that
They shall shine as the brightness of the firmament, and as the stars
(Daniel 12:3). But these were examined to see whether their knowledges
resided in the memory or in the life. Such of them as had a genuine
affection of truth, that is, who had uses separated from what pertains
to the body and the world as their end, which are essentially spiritual
uses--these, when they had been instructed, were received into heaven;
and it was then given them to know what it is that shines in heaven,
namely, Divine truth (which is the light of heaven) in use, which is a
plane that receives the rays of that light and turns them into various
splendors. But those in whom knowledges resided merely in the memory,
and who had acquired therefrom an ability to reason about truths and to
prove what they had already accepted as principles, seeing such
principles, after they had confirmed them, as truths, although they were
falsities, these, as they were in no heavenly light, and yet were in a
belief derived from the conceit that usually adheres to such
intelligence that they were more learned than others, and would for that
reason enter heaven and be served by the angels, in order that they
might be withdrawn from their delusive faith, were taken up to the first
or outmost heaven to be introduced into an angelic society. But at the
very threshold their eyes began to be darkened by the inflowing of the
light of heaven, and their understanding to be disturbed, and at length
they began to gasp as if at the point of death; and as soon as they felt
the heat of heaven, which is heavenly love, they began to be inwardly
tormented. They were therefore cast down, and afterwards were taught
that knowledges do not make an angel, but the life itself, which is
gained by means of knowledges, for knowledges regarded in themselves are
outside of heaven; but life acquired by means of knowledges is within
heaven.

When spirits have been prepared for heaven by instruction in the places
above described, which is effected in a short time on account of their
being in spiritual ideas that comprehend many particulars together, they
are clothed with angelic garments, which are mostly glowing white as if
made of fine linen; and they are thus brought to the way that leads
upwards towards heaven, and are delivered there to angel guards, and
afterwards are received by other angels and introduced into societies
and into many blessednesses there. After this each one is led by the
Lord into his own society, which is also effected by various ways,
sometimes by winding paths. The ways by which they are led are not known
to any angel, but are known to the Lord alone. When they come to their
own society their interiors are opened; and as these are in conformity
with the interiors of the angels who are in that society they are
immediately recognized and received with joy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="520.">520.</span></span>

To this I will add a memorable fact respecting the ways that lead from
these places to heaven, by which the newly arrived angels are
introduced. There are eight ways, two from each place of instruction,
one going up in an eastern direction the other towards the west. Those
that enter the Lord's celestial kingdom are introduced by the eastern
way, while those that enter the spiritual kingdom are introduced by the
western way. The four ways that lead to the Lord's celestial kingdom
appear adorned with olive trees and fruit trees of various kinds; but
those that lead to the Lord's spiritual kingdom appear adorned with
vines and laurels. This is from correspondence, because vines and
laurels correspond to affection for truth and its uses, while olives and
fruits correspond to affection for good and its uses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="521.">521.</span></span>

NO ONE ENTERS HEAVEN BY MERCY APART FROM MEANS. Those that have not been
instructed about heaven and the way to heaven, and about the life of
heaven in man, suppose that being received into heaven is a mere matter
of mercy, and is granted to those that have faith, and for whom the Lord
intercedes; thus that it is an admission from mere favor; consequently
that all men without exception might be saved if the Lord so pleased,
and some even believe that all in hell might be so saved. But those who
so think know nothing about man, that he is just such as his life is,
and that his life is such as his love is, both in respect to the
interiors pertaining to his will and understanding and in respect to the
exteriors pertaining to his body; also that his bodily form is merely
the external form in which the interiors exhibit themselves in effect;
consequently that one's love is the whole man (see above, n. 363). Nor
do they know that the body lives not from itself, but from its spirit,
and that a man's spirit is his essential affection, and his spiritual
body is nothing else than his affection in human form, and in such a
form it appears after death (see above, n. 453-460). So long as man
remains ignorant of all this he may be induced to believe that salvation
involves nothing but the Divine good pleasure, which is called mercy and
grace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="522.">522.</span></span>

But first let us consider what the Divine mercy is. The divine mercy is
pure mercy towards the whole human race, to save it; and it is also
unceasing towards every man, and is never withdrawn from any one; so
that everyone is saved who can be saved. And yet no one can be saved
except by Divine means, which means the Lord reveals in the Word. The
Divine means are what are called Divine truths, which teach how man must
live in order to be saved. By these truths the Lord leads man to heaven,
and by them He implants in man the life of heaven. This the Lord does
for all. But the life of heaven can be implanted in no one unless he
abstains from evil, for evil obstructs. So far, therefore, as man
abstains from evil he is led by the Lord out of pure mercy by His Divine
means, and this from infancy to the end of his life in the world and
afterwards to eternity. This is what is meant by the Divine mercy. And
from this it is evident that the mercy of the Lord is pure mercy, but
not apart from means, that is, it does not look to saving all out of
mere good pleasure, however they may have lived.

<span class="margnote"><span id="523.">523.</span></span>

The Lord never does anything contrary to order, because He Himself is
Order. The Divine truth that goes forth from the Lord is what
constitutes order; and Divine truths are the laws of order. It is in
accord with these laws that the Lord leads man. Consequently to save man
by mercy apart from means would be contrary to Divine order, and what is
contrary to Divine order is contrary to the Divine. Divine order is
heaven in man, and man has perverted this in himself by a life contrary
to the laws of order, which are Divine truths. Into this order man is
brought back by the Lord out of pure mercy by means of the laws of
order; and so far as he is brought back into this order he receives
heaven in himself; and he that receives heaven in himself enters heaven.
This again makes evident that the Lord's Divine mercy is pure mercy, and
not mercy apart from means. <span id="fr_278"></span>[523-1](#fn_278.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="524.">524.</span></span>

If men could be saved by mercy apart from means all would be saved, even
those in hell; in fact, there would be no hell, because the Lord is
mercy itself, love itself, and goodness itself. Therefore it is
inconsistent with His Divine to say that He is able to save all apart
from means and does not save them. It is known from the Word that the
Lord wills the salvation of all, and the damnation of no one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="525.">525.</span></span>

Most of those who enter the other life from the Christian world bring
with them this belief that they can be saved by mercy apart from means,
and pray for that mercy; but when examined they are found to believe
that entering heaven is merely gaining admission, and that those who are
let in are in heavenly joy. They are wholly ignorant of what heaven is
and what heavenly joy is, and consequently are told that the Lord denies
heaven to no one, and that they can be admitted and can stay there if
they desire it. Those who so desired were admitted; but as soon as they
reached the first threshold they were seized with such anguish of heart
from a draught of heavenly heat, which is the love in which angels are,
and from an inflow of heavenly light, which is Divine truth, that they
felt in themselves infernal torment instead of heavenly joy, and struck
with dismay they cast themselves down headlong. Thus they were taught by
living experience that it is impossible to grant heaven to any one from
mercy apart from means.

<span class="margnote"><span id="526.">526.</span></span>

I have occasionally talked with angels about this, and have told them
that most of those in the world who live in evil, when they talk with
others about heaven and eternal life, express no other idea than that
entering heaven is merely being admitted from mercy alone. And this is
believed by those especially who make faith the only medium of
salvation. For such from the principles of their religion have no regard
to the life and the deeds of love that make life, and thus to none of
the other means by which the Lord implants heaven in man and renders him
receptive of heavenly joy; and as they thus reject every actual
mediation they conclude, as a necessary consequence of the principle,
that man enters heaven from mercy alone, to which mercy God the Father
is believed to be moved by the intercession of the Son. \[2\] To all
this the angels said that they knew such a tenet follows of necessity
from the assumption that man is saved by faith alone, and since that
tenet is the head of all the rest, and since into it, because it is not
true, no light from heaven can flow, this is the source of the ignorance
that prevails in the church at this day in regard to the Lord, heaven,
the life after death, heavenly joy, the essence of love and charity, and
in general, in regard to good and its conjunction with truth,
consequently in regard to the life of man, whence it is and what it is;
when it should be known that thought never constitutes any one's life,
but the will and the consequent deeds; and that the life is from the
thought only to the extent that the thought is derived from the will;
neither is life from the faith except so far as the faith is derived
from love. Angels are grieved that these persons do not know that faith
alone is impossible in any one, since faith apart from its origin, which
is love, is nothing but knowledge, and in some is merely a sort of
persuasion that has the semblance of faith (see above, n. 482). Such a
persuasion is not in the life of man, but outside of it, since it is
separated from man unless it coheres with his love. \[3\] The angels
said further that those who hold to this principle concerning the
essential means of salvation in man must needs believe in mercy apart
from means, for they perceive both from natural light and from the
experience of sight that faith separate does not constitute the life of
man, since those who lead an evil life are able to think and to be
persuaded the same as others; and from this comes the belief that the
evil as well as the good can be saved, provided that at the hour of
death they talk with confidence about intercession, and about the mercy
that is granted through that intercession. The angels declared that they
had never yet seen any one who had lived an evil life received into
heaven from mercy apart from means, whatever trust or confidence (which
is preeminently meant by faith) he had exhibited in his talk in the
world. \[4\] When asked about Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, David, and the
apostles, whether they were not received into heaven from mercy apart
from means, the angels replied that not one of them was so received, but
everyone in accordance with his life in the world; that they knew where
these were, and that they were no more esteemed there than others. They
said that these persons are mentioned with honor in the Word for the
reason that in the internal sense the Lord is meant by them - by
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Lord in respect to the Divine and the
Divine Human; by David the Lord in respect to the Divine royalty; and by
the apostles the Lord in respect to Divine truths; also that when the
Word is read by man the angels have no perception whatever of these men,
for their names do not enter heaven; but they have instead a perception
of the Lord as He has just been described; consequently in the Word that
is in heaven (see above, n. 259) there are no such names mentioned,
since that Word is the internal sense of the Word that is in the
world. <span id="fr_279"></span>[526-1](#fn_279.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="527.">527.</span></span>

I can testify from much experience that it is impossible to implant the
life of heaven in those who in the world have lived a life opposite to
the life of heaven. There were some who had believed that when after
death they should hear Divine truths from the angels they would readily
accept them and believe them, and consequently live a different life,
and could thus be received into heaven. But this was tried with very
many, although it was confined to those who held this belief, and was
permitted in their case to teach them that repentance is not possible
after death. Some of those with whom the experiment was made understood
truths and seemed to accept them; but as soon as they turned to the life
of their love they rejected them, and even spoke against them. Others
were unwilling to hear them, and at once rejected them. Others wished to
have the life of love that they had contracted from the world taken away
from them, and to have the angelic life, or the life of heaven, infused
in its place. This, too, was permitted to be done; but as soon as the
life of their love was taken away they lay as if dead, with their powers
gone. By these and other experiments the simple good were taught that no
one's life can by any means be changed after death; and that an evil
life can in no way be converted into a good life, or an infernal life
into an angelic life, for every spirit from head to heel is such as his
love is, and therefore such as his life is; and to convert his life into
its opposite is to destroy the spirit completely. The angels declare
that it would be easier to change a night-owl into a dove, or a
horned-owl into a bird of paradise, than to change an infernal spirit
into an angel of heaven. That man after death continues to be such as
his life had been in the world can be seen above in its own chapter (n.
470-484). From all this it is evident that no one can be received into
heaven from mercy apart from means.

<span class="margnote"><span id="528.">528.</span></span>

IT IS NOT SO DIFFICULT TO LIVE THE LIFE THAT LEADS TO HEAVEN AS IS
BELIEVED. There are some who believe that to live the life that leads to
heaven, which is called the spiritual life, is difficult, because they
have been told that man must renounce the world, must divest himself of
the lusts called the lusts of the body and the flesh, and must live
spiritually; and they understand this to mean that they must discard
worldly things, which consist chiefly in riches and honors; that they
must walk continually in pious meditation on God, salvation, and eternal
life; and must spend their life in prayers and in reading the Word and
pious books. Such is their idea of renouncing the world, and living in
the spirit and not in the flesh. But that this is not at all true it has
been given me to know by much experience and from conversation with the
angels. I have learned, in fact, that those who renounce the world and
live in the spirit in this manner acquire a sorrowful life that is not
receptive of heavenly joy, since everyone's life continues the same
after death. On the contrary, to receive the life of heaven a man must
needs live in the world and engage in its business and employments, and
by means of a moral and civil life there receive the spiritual life. In
no other way can the spiritual life be formed in man, or his spirit
prepared for heaven; for to live an internal life and not at the same
time an external life is like dwelling in a house that has no
foundation, that gradually sinks or becomes cracked and rent asunder, or
totters till it falls.

<span class="margnote"><span id="529.">529.</span></span>

When the life of man is scanned and explored by rational insight it is
found to be threefold, namely, spiritual, moral, and civil, with these
three lives distinct from each other. For there are men who live a civil
life and not as yet a moral and spiritual life; and there are men who
live a moral life and not as yet a spiritual life; and there are those
who live a civil life, a moral life, and a spiritual life at the same
time. These live the life of heaven; but the former live the life of the
world separated from the life of heaven. This shows, in the first place,
that the spiritual life is not a life separated from natural life or the
life of the world, but is joined with it as the soul is joined with its
body, and if it were separated it would be, as was said, like living in
a house that has no foundation. For moral and civil life is the active
plane of the spiritual life, since to will well is the province of the
spiritual life, and to act well of the moral and civil life, and if the
latter is separated from the former the spiritual life consists solely
of thought and speech, and the will, left with no support, recedes; and
yet the will is the very spiritual part of man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="530.">530.</span></span>

That it is not so difficult as some believe to live the life that leads
to heaven will now be shown. Who cannot live a civil and moral life? For
everyone from his childhood is initiated into that life, and learns what
it is by living in the world. Moreover, everyone, whether evil or good,
lives that life; for who does not wish to be called honest, and who does
not wish to be called just? Almost everyone practices honesty and
justice outwardly, so far as to seem to be honest and just at heart, or
to seem to act from real honesty and justice. The spiritual man ought to
live in like manner, and can do so as easily as the natural man can,
with this difference only, that the spiritual man believes in the
Divine, and acts honestly and justly, not solely because to so act is in
accord with civil and moral laws, but also because it is in accord with
Divine laws. As the spiritual man, in whatever he is doing, thinks about
Divine things, he has communication with the angels of heaven; and so
far as this takes place he is conjoined with them; and thereby his
internal man, which regarded in itself is the spiritual man, is opened.
When man comes into this state he is adopted and led by the Lord,
although himself unconscious of it, and then whatever he does that is
honest and just pertaining to moral and civil life, is done from a
spiritual motive; and doing what is honest and just from a spiritual
motive is doing it from honesty and justice itself, or doing it from the
heart. \[2\] His justice and honesty appear outwardly precisely the same
as the justice and honesty of natural men and even of evil and infernal
men; but in inward form they are wholly unlike. For evil men act justly
and honestly solely for the sake of themselves and the world; and
therefore if they had no fear of laws and penalties, or the loss of
reputation, of honor, of gain, and of life, they would act in every
respect dishonestly and unjustly, since they neither fear God nor any
Divine law, and therefore are not restrained by any internal bond;
consequently they would use every opportunity to defraud, plunder, and
spoil others, and this from delight. That inwardly they are such can be
clearly seen from those of the same character in the other life, while
everyone's externals are taken away, and his internals in which he at
last lives to eternity are opened (see above, n. 499-511). As such then
act without external restraints, which are, as just said, fear of the
law, of the loss of reputation, of honor, of gain, and of life, they act
insanely, and laugh at honesty and justice. \[3\] But those who have
acted honestly and justly from regard to Divine laws, when their
externals are taken away and they are left to their internals, act
wisely, because they are conjoined to the angels of heaven, from whom
wisdom is communicated to them. From all this it can now be seen, in the
first place, that when the internal man, that is, the will and thought,
are conjoined to the Divine, the civil and moral life of the spiritual
man may be wholly like the civil and moral life of the natural man (see
above, n. 358-360).

<span class="margnote"><span id="531.">531.</span></span>

Furthermore, the laws of spiritual life, the laws of civil life, and the
laws of moral life are set forth in the ten commandments of the
Decalogue; in the first three the laws of spiritual life, in the four
that follow the laws of civil life, and in the last three the laws of
moral life. Outwardly the merely natural man lives in accordance with
the same commandments in the same way as the spiritual man does, for in
like manner he worships the Divine, goes to church, listens to
preachings, and assumes a devout countenance, refrains from committing
murder, adultery, and theft, from bearing false witness, and from
defrauding his companions of their goods. But all this he does merely
for the sake of himself and the world, to keep up appearances; while
inwardly such a person is the direct opposite of what he appears
outwardly, since in heart he denies the Divine, in worship acts the
hypocrite, and when left to himself and his own thoughts laughs at the
holy things of the church, believing that they merely serve as a
restraint for the simple multitude. \[2\] Consequently he is wholly
disjoined from heaven, and not being a spiritual man he is neither a
moral man nor a civil man. For although he refrains from committing
murder he hates everyone who opposes him, and from his hatred burns with
revenge, and would therefore commit murder if he were not restrained by
civil laws and external bonds, which he fears; and as he longs to do so
it follows that he is continually committing murder. Although he does
not commit adultery, yet as he believes it to be allowable he is all the
while an adulterer, since he commits adultery to the extent that he has
the ability and as often as he has opportunity. Although he does not
steal, yet as he covets the goods of others and does not regard fraud
and wicked devices as opposed to what is lawful, in intent he is
continually acting the thief. The same is true of the commandments
relating to moral life, which forbid false witness and coveting the
goods of others. Such is every man who denies the Divine, and who has no
conscience derived from religion. That he is such is clearly evident
from those of like character in the other life when their externals have
been removed and they are let into their internals. As they are then
separated from heaven they act in unity with hell, and in consequence
are affiliated with those who are in hell. \[3\] It is not so with those
who in heart have acknowledged the Divine, and in the actions of their
lives have had respect to Divine laws, and have lived as fully in accord
with the first three commandments of the Decalogue as they have in
accordance with the others. When the externals of such are removed and
they are let into their internals they are wiser than they were in the
world; for entering into their internals is like entering from darkness
into light, from ignorance into wisdom, and from a sorrowful life into a
happy life, because they are in the Divine, thus in heaven. This has
been said to make known what the one kind of man is and what the other
is, although they have both lived the same external life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="532.">532.</span></span>

Everyone may know that thoughts are led or tend in accord with the
intentions, that is, in the directions that one intends; for thought is
man's internal sight, and resembles the external sight in this, that to
whatever point it is directed or aimed, thither it turns and there it
rests. Therefore when the internal sight or the thought is turned
towards the world and rests there, the thought in consequence becomes
worldly; when it turns to self and self-honor it becomes corporeal; but
when it is turned heavenwards it becomes heavenly. So, too, when turned
heavenwards it is elevated; but when turned selfward it is drawn down
from heaven and immersed in what is corporeal; and when turned towards
the world it is also turned down-wards from heaven, and is spent upon
those objects that are presented to the natural sight. \[2\] Man's love
is what constitutes his intention and determines his internal sight or
thought to its objects; thus the love of self fixes it upon self and its
objects, the love of the world upon worldly objects, and the love of
heaven upon heavenly objects; and when the love is known the state of
the interiors which constitute the mind can be known, that is, the
interiors of one who loves heaven are raised towards heaven and are
opened above; while the interiors of one who loves the world or who
loves himself are closed above and are opened outwardly. From this the
conclusion follows that when the higher regions of the mind are closed
above, man can no longer see the objects pertaining to heaven and the
church, but those objects are in thick darkness to him; and what is in
thick darkness is either denied or not understood. And this is why those
that love themselves and the world above all things since the higher
regions of their minds are closed, in heart deny Divine truths; and if
from their memory they say anything about them they nevertheless do not
understand them. Moreover, they regard them in the same way as they
regard worldly and corporeal things. And being such they are able to
direct the mind to those things only that enter through the senses of
the body, and in these alone do they find delight. Among these are also
many things that are filthy, obscene, profane and wicked; and these
cannot be removed, because into the minds of such no influx from heaven
is possible, since their minds, as just now said, are closed above.
\[3\] Man's intention, by which his internal sight or thought is
determined, is his will; for what a man wills he intends, and what he
intends he thinks. Therefore when his intention is heavenward his
thought is determined heavenward, and with it his whole mind, which is
thus in heaven; and from heaven he beholds the things of the world
beneath him like one looking down from the roof of a house. So the man
that has the interiors of his mind open can see the evils and falsities
that are in him, for these are beneath the spiritual mind. On the other
hand, the man whose interiors are not open is unable to see his evils
and falsities, because he is not above them but in them. From all this
one may conclude whence man has wisdom and whence insanity, also what a
man will be after death when he is left to will and think and to act and
speak in accordance with his interiors. All this also has been said in
order to make clear what constitutes a man's interior character, however
he may seem outwardly to resemble others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="533.">533.</span></span>

That it is not so difficult to live the life of heaven as some believe
can now be seen from this, that when any thing presents itself to a man
that he knows to be dishonest and unjust, but to which his mind is
borne, it is simply necessary for him to think that it ought not to be
done because it is opposed to the Divine precepts. If a man accustoms
himself so to think, and from so doing establishes a habit of so
thinking, he is gradually conjoined to heaven; and so far as he is
conjoined to heaven the higher regions of his mind are opened; and so
far as these are opened he sees whatever is dishonest and unjust, and so
far as he sees these evils they can be dispersed, for no evil can be
dispersed until it is seen. Into this state man is able to enter because
of his freedom, for is not any one able from his freedom to so think?
And when man has made a beginning the Lord quickens all that is good in
him, and causes him not only to see evils to be evils, but also to
refrain from willing them, and finally to turn away from them. This is
meant by the Lord's words, My yoke is easy and My burden is light (Matt.
11:30). But it must be understood that the difficulty of so thinking and
of resisting evils increases so far as man from his will does evils, for
in the same measure he becomes accustomed to them until he no longer
sees them, and at length loves them and from the delight of his love
excuses them, and confirms them by every kind of fallacy, and declares
them to be allowable and good. This is the fate of those who in early
youth plunge into evils without restraint, and also reject Divine things
from the heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="534.">534.</span></span>

The way that leads to heaven, and the way that leads to hell were once
represented to me. There was a broad way tending towards the left or the
north, and many spirits were seen going in it; but at a distance a large
stone was seen where the broad way came to an end. From that stone two
ways branched off, one to the left and one in the opposite direction to
the right. The way that went to the left was narrow or straitened,
leading through the west to the south, and thus into the light of
heaven; the way that went to the right was broad and spacious, leading
obliquely downwards towards hell. All at first seemed to be going the
same way until they came to the large stone at the head of the two ways.
When they reached that point they divided; the good turned to the left
and entered the straitened way that led to heaven; while the evil, not
seeing the stone at the fork of the ways fell upon it and were hurt; and
when they rose up they ran on in the broad way to the right which went
towards hell. \[2\] What all this meant was afterwards explained to me.
The first way that was broad, wherein many both good and evil went
together and talked with each other as friends, because there was no
visible difference between them, represented those who externally live
alike honestly and justly, and between whom seemingly there is no
difference. The stone at the head of the two ways or at the corner, upon
which the evil fell and from which they ran into the way leading to
hell, represented the Divine truth, which is rejected by those who look
towards hell; and in the highest sense this stone signified the Lord's
Divine Human. But those who acknowledged the Divine truth and also the
Divine of the Lord went by the way that led to heaven. By this again it
was shown that in externals the evil lead the same kind of life as the
good, or go the same way, that is, one as readily as the other; and yet
those who from the heart acknowledge the Divine, especially those within
the church who acknowledge the Divine of the Lord, are led to heaven;
while those who do not are led to hell. \[3\] The thoughts of man that
proceed from his intention or will are represented in the other life by
ways; and ways are visibly presented there in exact accord with those
thoughts of intention; and in accord with his thoughts that proceed from
intention everyone walks. For this reason the character of spirits and
their thoughts are known from their ways. This also makes clear what is
meant by the Lord's words: Enter ye in through the narrow gate; for wide
is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many
be they that enter in thereby; for straitened is the way and narrow the
gate that leadeth to life, and few be they who find it (Matt. 7:13, 14).
The way that leads to life is straitened not because it is difficult but
because there are few who find it, as is said here. The stone seen at
the corner where the broad and common way ended, and from which two ways
were seen to lead in opposite directions, illustrated what is signified
by these words of the Lord: Have ye not read what is written? The stone
which the builders rejected was made the head of the corner. Whosoever
shall fall upon that stone shall be broken (Luke. 20:17, 18). "Stone"
signifies Divine truth, and "the stone of Israel" the Lord in respect to
His Divine Human; the "builders" mean those who are of the church; "the
head of the corner" is where the two ways are; "to fall" and "to be
broken" is to deny and perish. <span id="fr_280"></span>[534-1](#fn_280.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="535.">535.</span></span>

I have been permitted to talk with some in the other life who had
withdrawn from worldly affairs that they might live in a pious and holy
manner, also with some who had afflicted themselves in various ways,
believing that they were thereby renouncing the world and subduing the
lusts of the flesh. But as most of these have thus acquired a sorrowful
life and had withdrawn from the life of charity, which life can be lived
only in the midst of the world, they are incapable of being affiliated
with angels, because the life of angels is a life of joy resulting from
a state of blessedness, and consists in performing good deeds, which are
works of charity. Moreover, those who have lived a life withdrawn from
worldly employments are inflamed with the idea of their own merit, and
are continually desiring heaven on that account, and thinking of
heavenly joy as a reward, utterly ignorant of what heavenly joy is. When
such are admitted into the company of angels and into their joy, which
discards merit and consists in active labors and practical services, and
in a blessedness resulting from the good thereby accomplished, they are
astonished like one who has found out something quite foreign to his
belief; and since they are not receptive of that joy they go away and
ally themselves with spirits of their own kind that have lived in the
world a life like their own. \[2\] But those who have lived an outwardly
holy life, constantly attending church and praying and afflicting their
souls, and at the same time have thought constantly of themselves that
they would be esteemed and honored for all this above others, and
finally after death would be accounted saints - such in the other life
are not in heaven because they have done all this for the sake of
themselves. And as they have defiled Divine truths by the self-love in
which they have immersed them, some of them are so insane as to think
themselves gods; and are consequently in hell among those like
themselves. Some are cunning and deceitful, and are in the hells of the
deceitful. These are such as by means of cunning arts and devices have
maintained such pious conduct as induced the common people to believe
that they possessed a Divine sanctity. \[3\] Of this character are many
of the Roman Catholic saints. I have been permitted to talk with some of
them, and their life was then plainly disclosed, such as it had been in
the world and as it was afterwards. All this has been said to make known
that the life that leads to heaven is not a life withdrawn from the
world, but a life in the world; and that a life of piety separated from
a life of charity, which is possible only in the world, does not lead to
heaven; but a life of charity does; and a life of charity consists in
acting honestly and justly in every employment, in every business, and
in every work, from an interior, that is, from a heavenly, motive; and
this motive is in that life whenever man acts honestly and justly
because doing so is in accord with the Divine laws. Such a life is not
difficult. But a life of piety separate from a life of charity is
difficult; and as much as such a life is believed to lead towards heaven
so much it leads away from heaven. <span

<span class="margnote"><span id="536.">536.</span></span>

THE LORD RULES THE HELLS. Above, in treating of heaven it has been
everywhere shown (especially in n. 2-6) that the God of heaven is the
Lord, thus that the whole government of the heavens is the Lord's
government. And as the relation of heaven to hell and of hell to heaven
is like the relation between two opposites which mutually act contrary
to each other, and from the action and re-action of which an equilibrium
results, which gives permanence to all things of their action and
reaction, so in order that all things and each thing may be kept in
equilibrium it is necessary that He who rules the one should rule the
other; for unless the same Lord restrained the uprisings from the hells
and checked insanities there the equilibrium would perish and everything
with it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="537.">537.</span></span>

But something about that equilibrium shall first be told. It is
acknowledged that when two things mutually act against each other, and
as much as one reacts and resists the other acts and impels, since there
is equal power on either side, neither has any effect, and both can then
be acted upon freely by a third. For when the force of the two is
neutralized by equal opposition the force of a third has full effect,
and acts as easily as if there were no opposition. \[2\] Such is the
equilibrium between heaven and hell. Yet it is not an equilibrium like
that between two bodily combatants whose strength is equal; but it is a
spiritual equilibrium, that is, an equilibrium of falsity against truth
and of evil against good. From hell falsity from evil continually
exhales, and from heaven truth from good. It is this spiritual
equilibrium that causes man to think and will in freedom; for whatever a
man thinks and wills has reference either to evil and falsity therefrom
or to good and truth therefrom. \[3\] Therefore when he is in that
equilibrium he is in freedom either to admit or accept evil and its
falsity from hell or to admit or accept good and its truth from heaven.
Every man is held in this equilibrium by the Lord, because the Lord
rules both heaven and hell. But why man is held in this freedom by such
an equilibrium, and why evil and falsity are not taken away from him and
good and truth implanted in him by Divine power will be told hereafter
in its own chapter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="538.">538.</span></span>

A perception of the sphere of falsity from evil that flows forth from
hell has often been granted me. It was like a perpetual effort to
destroy all that is good and true, combined with anger and a kind of
fury at not being able to do so, especially an effort to annihilate and
destroy the Divine of the Lord, and this because all good and truth are
from Him. But out of heaven a sphere of truth from good was perceived,
whereby the fury of the effort ascending from hell was restrained. The
result of this was an equilibrium. This sphere from heaven was perceived
to come from the Lord alone, although it appeared to come from the
angels in heaven. It is from the Lord alone, and not from the angels,
because every angel in heaven acknowledges that nothing of good and of
truth is from himself, but all is from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="539.">539.</span></span>

In the spiritual world truth from good is the source of all power, and
falsity from evil has no power whatever. This is because the Divine
Itself in heaven is Divine good and Divine truth, and all power belongs
to the Divine. Falsity from evil is powerless because truth from good is
the source of all power, and in falsity from evil there is nothing of
truth from good. Consequently in heaven there is all power, and none in
hell; for everyone in heaven is in truths from good, and everyone in
hell is in falsities from evil. For no one is admitted into heaven until
he is in truths from good, neither is any one cast down into hell until
he is in falsities from evil, (That this is so can be seen in the
chapters treating of the first, second, and third states of man after
death, n. 491-520; and that all power belongs to truth from good can be
seen in the chapter on the power of angels in heaven, n. 228-233.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="540.">540.</span></span>

Such, then, is the equilibrium between heaven and hell. Those who are in
the world of spirits are in that equilibrium, for the world of spirits
is midway between heaven and hell. From the same source all men in the
world are kept in a like equilibrium, since men in the world are ruled
by the Lord by means of spirits in the world of spirits, as will be
shown hereafter in its own chapter. No such equilibrium would be
possible unless the Lord ruled both heaven and hell and regulated both
sides. Otherwise falsities from evil would preponderate, and would
affect the simple good who are in the outmosts regions of heaven, and
who can be more easily perverted than the angels themselves; and thereby
equilibrium would perish, and with it freedom in men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="541.">541.</span></span>

Hell, like heaven, is divided into societies, and into as many societies
as there are in heaven; for every society in heaven has a society
opposite to it in hell, and this for the sake of equilibrium. But evils
and falsities therefrom are what distinguish the societies in hell, as
goods and truths therefrom are what distinguish the societies in heaven.
That for every good there is an opposite evil, and for every truth an
opposite falsity may be known from this, that nothing can exist without
relation to its opposite, and what anything is in kind and degree can be
known from its opposite, and from this all perception and sensation is
derived. For this reason the Lord continually provides that every
society in heaven shall have an opposite in some society of hell, and
that there shall be an equilibrium between the two.

<span class="margnote"><span id="542.">542.</span></span>

As hell is divided into the same number of societies as heaven, there
are as many hells as there are societies of heaven; for as each society
of heaven is a heaven in smaller form (see above, n. 51-58), so each
society in hell is a hell in smaller form. As in general there are three
heavens, so in general there are three hells, a lowest, which is
opposite to the inmost or third heaven, a middle, which is opposite to
the middle or second heaven, and a higher, which is opposite to the
outmost or first heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="543.">543.</span></span>

How the hells are ruled by the Lord shall be briefly explained. In
general the hells are ruled by a general outflow from the heavens of
Divine good and Divine truth whereby the general endeavor flowing forth
from the hells is checked and restrained; also by a particular outflow
from each heaven and from each society of heaven. The hells are ruled in
particular by means of the angels, to whom it is granted to look into
the hells and to restrain insanities and disturbances there; and
sometimes angels are sent to them who moderate these insanities and
disturbances by their presence. But in general all in the hells are
ruled by means of their fears. Some are ruled by fears implanted in the
world and still inherent in them; but as these fears are not sufficient,
and gradually subside, they are ruled by fears of punishments; and it is
especially by these that they are deterred from doing evil. The
punishments in hell are manifold, lighter or more severe in accordance
with the evils. For the most part the more wicked, who excel in cunning
and in artifices, and who are able to hold the rest in subjection and
servitude by means of punishments and consequent terror, are set over
them; but these governors dare not pass beyond the limits prescribed to
them. It must be understood that the sole means of restraining the
violence and fury of those who are in the hells is the fear of
punishment. There is no other way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="544.">544.</span></span>

It has been believed heretofore in the world that there is one devil
that presides over the hells; that he was created an angel of light; but
having become rebellious he was cast down with his crew into hell. This
belief has prevailed because the Devil and Satan, and also Lucifer, are
mentioned by name in the Word, and the Word in those places has been
understood according to the sense of the letter. But by "the devil" and
"Satan" there hell is meant, "devil" meaning the hell that is behind,
where the worst dwell, who are called evil genii; and "Satan" the hell
that is in front, where the less wicked dwell, who are called evil
spirits; and "Lucifer" those that belong to Babel, or Babylon, who would
extend their dominion even into heaven. That there is no one devil to
whom the hells are subject is evident also from this, that all who are
in the hells, like all who are in the heavens, are from the human race
(see n. 311-317); and that those who have gone there from the beginning
of creation to this time amount to myriads of myriads, and everyone of
them is a devil in accord with his opposition to the Divine while he
lived in the world (see above, n. 311, 312).

<span class="margnote"><span id="545.">545.</span></span>

THE LORD CASTS NO ONE INTO HELL; THE SPIRIT CASTS HIMSELF DOWN. An
opinion has prevailed with some that God turns away His face from man,
casts man away from Himself, and casts him into hell, and is angry with
him on account of his evil; and some believe also that God punishes man
and does evil to him. In this opinion they establish themselves by the
sense of the letter of the Word, where such things are declared, not
knowing that the spiritual sense of the Word, by which the sense of the
letter is made clear, is wholly different; and consequently that the
genuine doctrine of the church, which is from the spiritual sense of the
Word, teaches otherwise, namely, that God never turns away His face from
man, and never casts man away from Himself, that He casts no one into
hell and is angry with no one. <span id="fr_282"></span>[545-1](#fn_282.md)
Everyone, moreover, whose mind is enlightened perceives this to be true
when he reads the Word, from the simple truth that God is good itself,
love itself, and mercy itself; and that good itself cannot do evil to
any one, and love itself and mercy itself can not cast man away from
itself, because this is contrary to the very essence of mercy and love,
thus contrary to the Divine Itself. Therefore those who think from an
enlightened mind clearly perceive, when they read the Word, that God
never turns Himself away from man; and as He never turns Himself away
from him He deals with him from goodness, love, and mercy, that is,
wills good to him, loves him, and is merciful to him. And from this they
see that the sense of the letter of the Word, in which such things are
declared, has stored up within itself a spiritual sense, and that these
expressions that are used in the sense of the letter in accommodation to
man's apprehension and according to his first and general ideas are to
be explained in accordance with the spiritual sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="546.">546.</span></span>

Those who are enlightened see further that good and evil are two
opposites, and are therefore opposed as heaven and hell are, and that
all good is from heaven and all evil from hell; and as it is the Divine
of the Lord that makes heaven (n. 7-12), nothing but good flows into man
from the Lord, and nothing but evil from hell; thus the Lord is
continually withdrawing man from evil and leading him to good, while
hell is continually leading man into evil. Unless man were between these
two, he could have no thought nor any will, still less any freedom or
any choice; for all these man has by virtue of the equilibrium between
good and evil; consequently if the Lord should turn Himself away,
leaving man to evil alone, man would cease to be man. All this shows
that the Lord flows into every man with good, into the evil man as well
as the good; but with the difference that the Lord is continually
withdrawing the evil man from evil and is continually leading the good
man to good; and this difference lies in the man himself, because he is
the recipient.

<span class="margnote"><span id="547.">547.</span></span>

From this it is clear that it is from hell that man does evil, and from
the Lord that he does good. But man believes that whatever he does he
does from himself, and in consequence of this the evil that he does
sticks to him as his own; and for this reason man is the cause of his
own evil, and in no way the Lord. Evil in man is hell in him, for it is
the same thing whether you say evil or hell. And since man is the cause
of his own evil he is led into hell, not by the Lord but by himself. For
so far is the Lord from leading man into hell that it is He who delivers
man from hell, and this He does so far as man does not will and love to
be in his own evil. All of man's will and love continues with him after
death (n. 470-484). He who wills and loves evil in the world wills and
loves the same evil in the other life, but he no longer suffers himself
to be withdrawn from it. If, therefore, a man is in evil he is tied to
hell, and in respect to his spirit is actually there, and after death
desires nothing so much as to be where his evil is; consequently it is
man who casts himself into hell after death, and not the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="548.">548.</span></span>

How this comes about shall also be explained. When man enters the other
life he is received first by angels, who perform for him all good
offices, and talk with him about the Lord, heaven, and the angelic life,
and instruct him in things that are true and good. But if the man, now a
spirit, be one who knew about these things in the world, but in heart
denied or despised them, after some conversation he desires and seeks to
get away from these angels. As soon as the angels perceive this they
leave him. After some interaction with others he at length unites
himself with those who are in evil like his own (see above, n. 445-452).
When this takes place he turns himself away from the Lord and turns his
face towards the hell to which he had been joined in the world, in which
those abide who are in a like love of evil. All this makes clear that
the Lord draws every spirit to Himself by means of angels and by means
of influx from heaven; but those spirits that are in evil completely
resist, and as it were tear themselves away from the Lord, and are drawn
by their own evil, thus by hell, as if by a rope. And as they are so
drawn, and by reason of their love of evil are eager to follow, it is
evident that they themselves cast themselves into hell by their own free
choice. Men in the world because of their idea of hell are unable to
believe that this is so. In fact, in the other life before the eyes of
those who are outside of hell it does not so appear; but only so to
those who cast themselves into hell, for such enter of their own accord.
Those who enter from a burning love of evil appear to be cast headlong,
with the head downwards and the feet upwards. It is because of this
appearance that they seem to be cast into hell by Divine power. (But
about this more will be said below, n. 574.) From all this it can be
seen that the Lord casts no one into hell, but everyone casts himself
into hell, both while he is living in the world and also after death
when he comes among spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="549.">549.</span></span>

The Lord from His Divine Essence, which is goodness, love, and mercy, is
unable to deal in the same way with every man, because evils and their
falsities prevent, and not only quench His Divine influx but even reject
it. Evils and their falsities are like black clouds which interpose
between the sun and the eye, and take away the sunshine and the serenity
of its light; although the unceasing endeavor of the sun to dissipate
the opposing clouds continues, for it is operating behind them; and in
the meantime transmits something of obscure light into the eye of man by
various roundabout ways. It is the same in the spiritual world. The sun
there is the Lord and the Divine love (n. 116-140); and the light there
is the Divine truth (n. 126-140); black clouds there are falsities from
evil; the eye there is the understanding. So far as any one in that
world is in falsities from evil he is encompassed by such a cloud, which
is black and dense according to the degree of his evil. From this
comparison it can be seen that the Lord is unceasingly present with
everyone, but that He is received variously.

<span class="margnote"><span id="550.">550.</span></span>

Evil spirits are severely punished in the world of spirits in order that
by means of punishments they may be deterred from doing evil. This also
appears to be from the Lord; and yet nothing of punishment there is from
the Lord, but is from the evil itself; since evil is so joined with its
own punishment that the two cannot be separated. For the infernal crew
desire and love nothing so much as doing evil, especially inflicting
punishments and torment upon others; and they maltreat and inflict
punishments upon everyone who is not protected by the Lord. When,
therefore, evil is done from an evil heart, because it thereby discards
all protection from the Lord, infernal spirits rush upon the one who
does the evil, and inflict punishment. This may be partly illustrated by
evils and their punishments in the world, where the two are also joined.
For laws in the world prescribe a penalty for every evil; therefore he
that rushes into evil rushes also into the penalty of evil. The only
difference is that in the world the evil may be concealed; but in the
other life it cannot be concealed. All this makes clear that the Lord
does evil to no one; and that it is the same as it is in the world,
where it is not the king nor the judge nor the law that is the cause of
punishment to the guilty, because these are not the cause of the evil in
the evil doer.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_276"></span>[513-1](hh11.htm#fr_276.md) Vastations are
effected in the other life, that is, those that pass into the other life
from the world are vastated (n. 698, 7122, 7474, 9763). The well
disposed are vastated in respect to falsities, while the evil are
vastated in respect to truths (n, 7474, 7541, 7542). The well disposed
undergo vastations that they also may be divested of what pertains to
the earth and the world, which they had contracted while living in the
world (n. 7186, 9763). Also that evils and falsities may be removed, and
thus there may be room for the influx of goods and truths out of heaven
from the Lord, and ability to accept these (n. 7122, 9330). Elevation
into heaven is impossible until such things have been removed, because
they obstruct heavenly things and are not in harmony with them (n. 6928,
7122, 7186, 7541, 7542, 9763). Those who are to be raised up into heaven
are thus prepared for it (n. 4728, 7090). It is dangerous to come into
heaven before being prepared (n. 537, 538). The state of enlightenment
and the joy of those who come out of vastation and are raised up into
heaven, and their reception there (n. 2699, 2701, 2704). The region
where those vastations are effected is called the lower earth (n. 4728,
7090). That region is under the soles of the feet surrounded by the
hells; its nature described (n. 4940-4951, 7090); from experience (n.
699). What the hells are which more than others infest and vastate (n.
7317, 7502, 7545). Those that have infested and vastated the well
disposed are afterwards afraid of them, shun them, and turn away from
them (n. 7768). These infestations and vastations are effected in
different ways in accordance with the adhesion of evils and falsities,
and they continue in accordance with their quality and quantity (n.
1106-1113). Some are quite willing to be vastated (n. 1107). Some are
vastated by fears (n. 4942). Some by being infested with the evils they
have done in the world, and with the falsities they have thought in the
world, from which they have anxieties and pangs of conscience (n. 1106).
Some by spiritual captivity, which is ignorance of truth and
interception of truth, combined with a longing to know truths (n. 1109,
2694). Some by sleep; some by a middle state between wakefulness and
sleep (n. 1108). Those that have placed merit in works seem to
themselves to be cutting wood (n. 1110). Others in other ways, with
great variety (n. 699).

<span id="fn_277"></span>[517-1](hh11.htm#fr_277.md) Every good has both
its delight and its quality from uses and in accordance with uses;
therefore such as the good is such the use is (n. 3049, 4984, 7038).
Angelic life consists in the goods of love and charity, thus in
performing uses (n. 454). The Lord and therefore the angels, have regard
to nothing in man but ends which are uses (n. 1317, 1645, 5854). The
kingdom of the Lord is a kingdom of uses (n. 454, 696, 1103, 3645, 4054,
7038). Serving the Lord is performing uses (n. 7038). What man is, such
are his uses (n. 1568, 3570, 4054, 6571, 6935, 6938, 10284).

<span id="fn_278"></span>[523-1](hh11.htm#fr_278.md) Divine truth going
forth from the Lord is the source of order, and Divine good is the
essential of order (n. 1728, 2258, 8700, 8988). Thus the Lord is order
(n. 1919, 2011, 5110, 5703, 10336, 10619). Divine truths are the laws of
order (n. 2447, 7995). The whole heaven is arranged by the Lord in
accordance with His Divine order (n. 3038, 7211, 9128, 9338, 10125,
10151, 10157). Therefore the form of heaven is a form in accord with the
Divine order (n. 4040-4043, 6607, 9877). So far as a man is living in
accordance with order, that is, so far as he is living in good in
accordance with Divine truths, he is receiving heaven in himself (n.
4839). Man is the being in whom are brought together all things of
Divine order, and by creation he is Divine order in form, because he is
a recipient of Divine order (n. 3628, 4219, 4220, 4223, 4523, 4524,
5214, 6013, 6057, 6605, 6626, 9706, 10156, 10472). Man is not born into
good and truth but into evil and falsity, thus not into Divine order but
into the opposite of order, and for this reason he is born into pure
ignorance; consequently it is necessary for him to be born anew, that
is, to be regenerated, which is effected by the Lord by means of Divine
truths, that be may be brought back into order (n. 1047, 2307, 2308,
3518, 8480, 8550, 10283, 10284, 10286, 10731). When the Lord forms man
anew, that is, regenerates him, He arranges all things in him in harmony
with order, that is, in the form of heaven (n. 5700, 6690, 9931, 10303).
Evils and falsities are contrary to order; nevertheless those who are in
them are ruled by the Lord not in accordance with order but from order
(n. 4839, 7877, 10777). It is impossible for a man who lives in evil to
be saved by mercy alone, for that would be contrary to Divine order (n.
8700).

<span id="fn_279"></span>[526-1](hh11.htm#fr_279.md) In the internal sense
of the Word by Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the Lord in respect to the
Divine itself and the Divine Human is meant (n. 1893, 4615, 6098, 6185,
6276, 6804, 6847). In heaven Abraham is unknown (n. 1834, 1876, 3229).
By David the Lord in respect to the Divine royalty is meant (n. 1888,
9954). The twelve apostles represented the Lord in respect to all things
of the church, that is, all things pertaining to faith and love (n.
2129, 3354, 3488, 3858, 6397). Peter represented the lord in respect to
faith, James in respect to charity, and John in respect to the works of
charity (n. 3750, 10087). The twelve apostles sitting on twelve thrones
and judging the twelve tribes of Israel, signified that the Lord will
judge in accord with the truths and goods of faith and love (n. 2129,
6397). The names of persons and of places in the Word do not enter
heaven, but are changed into things and states; and in heaven these
names cannot even be uttered (n. 1876, 5225, 6516, 10216, 10282, 10432).
Moreover, the angels think abstractedly from persons (n. 8343, 8985,
9907).

<span id="fn_280"></span>[534-1](hh11.htm#fr_280.md) "Stone" signifies
truth (n. 114, 643, 1298, 3720, 6426, 8609, 10376). For this reason the
law was inscribed on tables of stone (n. 10376). "The stone of Israel"
means the Lord in respect to the Divine truth and His Divine Human (n.
6426).

<span id="fn_281"></span>[535-1](hh11.htm#fr_281.md) A life of piety
separated from a life of charity is of no avail, but united with charity
it is profitable for all things (n. 8252, 8253). Charity to the neighbor
consists in doing what is good, just, and right in every work and in
every employment (n. 8120-8122). Charity to the neighbor takes in all
things and each thing that a man thinks, wills, and does (n. 8124). A
life of charity is a life in accordance with the Lord's commandments (n.
3249). Living in accordance with the Lord's commandments is loving the
Lord (n. 10143, 10153, 10310, 10578, 10645). Genuine charity claims no
merit, because it is from interior affection and consequent delight (n.
2371, 2380, 2400, 3816, 3887, 6388-6393). Man continues to be after
death such as was his life of charity in the world (n. 8256). Heavenly
blessedness flows in from the Lord into a life of charity (n. 2363).
Mere thinking admits no one into heaven; it must be accompanied by
willing and doing good (n. 2401, 3459). Unless doing good is joined with
willing good and thinking good there is no salvation nor any conjunction
of the internal man with the external (n. 3987).

<span id="fn_282"></span>[545-1](hh11.htm#fr_282.md) In the Word anger and
wrath are attributed to the Lord, but they are in man, and it is so
expressed because such is the appearance to man when he is punished and
damned (n. 798, 5798, 6997, 8284, 8483, 8875, 9306, 10431). Evil also is
attributed to the Lord, although nothing but good is from Him (n. 2447,
6071, 6991, 6997, 7533, 7632, 7679, 7926, 8227, 8228, 8632, 9306). Why
it is so expressed in the Word (n. 6071, 6991, 6997, 7632, 7643, 7679,
7710, 7926, 8282, 9010, 9128). The Lord is pure mercy and clemency (n.
6997, 8875).
