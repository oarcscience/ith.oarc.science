### Heaven and Hell

<span class="margnote"><span id="101.">101.</span></span>

Especially it must be understood that all correspondence with heaven is
with the Lord's Divine Human, because heaven is from Him, and He is
heaven, as has been shown in previous chapters. For if the Divine Human
did not flow into all things of heaven, and in accordance with
correspondences into all things of the world, no angel or man could
exist. From this again it is evident why the Lord became Man and clothed
His Divine from first to last with a Human. It was because the Divine
Human, from which heaven existed before the Lord's coming, was no longer
sufficient to sustain all things, for the reason that man, who is the
foundation of the heavens, had subverted and destroyed order. What the
Divine Human was before the Lord's coming, and what the condition of
heaven was at that time may be seen in the extracts appended to the
preceding chapter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="102.">102.</span></span>

Angels are amazed when they hear that there are men who attribute all
things to nature and nothing to the Divine, and who also believe that
their body, into which so many wonders of heaven are gathered, is a
product of nature. Still more are they amazed that the rational part of
man is believed to be from nature, when, if men will but lift their
minds a little, they can see that such effects are not from nature but
from the Divine; and that nature has been created simply for clothing
the spiritual and for presenting it in a correspondent form in the
outmost of order. Such men they liken to owls, which see in darkness,
but in light see nothing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="103.">103.</span></span>

THERE IS A CORRESPONDENCE OF HEAVEN WITH ALL THINGS OF THE EARTH. What
correspondence is has been told in the preceding chapter, and it has
there been shown that each thing and all things of the animal body are
correspondences. The next step is to show that all things of the earth,
and in general all things of the universe, are correspondences.

<span class="margnote"><span id="104.">104.</span></span>

All things of the earth are distinguished into three kinds, called
kingdoms, namely, the animal kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, and the
mineral kingdom. The things of the animal kingdom are correspondences in
the first degree, because they live; the things of the vegetable kingdom
are correspondences in the second degree, because they merely grow; the
things of the mineral kingdom are correspondences in the third degree,
because they neither live nor grow. Correspondences in the animal
kingdom are living creatures of various kinds, both those that walk and
creep on the ground and those that fly in the air; these need not be
specially named, as they are well known. Correspondences in the
vegetable kingdom are all things that grow and abound in gardens,
forests, fields, and meadows; these, too, need not be named, because
they are well known. Correspondences in the mineral kingdom are metals
more and less noble, stones precious and not precious, earths of various
kinds, and also the waters. Besides these the things prepared from them
by human activity for use are correspondences, as foods of every kind,
clothing, dwellings and other buildings, with many other things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="105.">105.</span></span>

Also the things above the earth, as the sun, moon, and stars, and those
in the atmosphere, as clouds, mists, rain, lightning and thunder, are
likewise correspondences. Things resulting from the presence and absence
of the sun, as light and shade, heat and cold, are also correspondences,
as well as those that follow in succession therefrom, as the seasons of
the year, spring, summer, autumn, and winter; and the times of day,
morning, noon, evening, and night.

<span class="margnote"><span id="106.">106.</span></span>

In a word, all things that have existence in nature, from the least to
the greatest thereof, are correspondences. <span
id="fr_75"></span>[106-1](#fn_75.md) They are correspondences because the
natural world with all things in it springs forth and subsists from the
spiritual world, and both worlds from the Divine. They are said to
subsist also, because everything subsists from that from which it
springs forth, subsistence being a permanent springing forth; also
because nothing can subsist from itself, but only from that which is
prior to itself, thus from a First, and if separated from that it would
utterly perish and vanish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="107.">107.</span></span>

Everything in nature that springs forth and subsists in accordance with
Divine order is a correspondence. Divine order is caused by the Divine
good that flows forth from the Lord. It begins in Him, goes forth from
Him through the heavens in succession into the world, and is terminated
there in outmosts; and everything there that is in accordance with order
is a correspondence. Everything there is in accordance with order that
is good and perfect for use, because everything good is good in the
measure of its use; while its form has relation to truth, truth being
the form of good. And for this reason everything in the whole world and
of the nature thereof that is in Divine order has reference to good and
truth. <span id="fr_76"></span>[107-1](#fn_76.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="108.">108.</span></span>

That all things in the world spring from the Divine, and are clothed
with such things in nature as enable them to exist there and perform
use, and thus to correspond, is clearly evident from the various things
seen in both the animal and vegetable kingdoms. In both there are things
that any one who thinks interiorly can see to be from heaven. For
illustration a few things out of a countless number may be mentioned;
and first some things from the animal kingdom. Many are aware what
knowledge there is engrafted as it were in every animal. Bees know how
to gather honey from flowers, to build cells out of wax in which to
store their honey, and thus provide food for themselves and their
families, even for a coming winter. That a new generation may be born
their queen lays eggs, and the rest take care of them and cover them.
They live under a sort of government which all know by instinct. They
preserve the working bees and cast out the drones, depriving them of
their wings; besides other wonderful things implanted in them from
heaven for the sake of their use, their wax everywhere serving the human
race for candles, their honey for adding sweetness to food. \[2\] Again,
what wonders do we see in worms, the meanest creatures in the animal
kingdom! They know how to get food from the juice of the leaves suited
to them, and afterward at the appointed time to invest themselves with a
covering and enter as it were into a womb, and thus hatch offspring of
their own kind. Some are first turned into nymphs and chrysalides,
spinning threads about themselves; and this travail being over they come
forth clad with a different body, furnished with wings with which they
fly in the air as in their heaven, and celebrate marriages and lay eggs
and provide posterity for themselves. \[3\] Besides these special
instances all creatures in general that fly in the air know the proper
food for their nourishment, not only what it is but where to find it;
they know how to build nests for themselves, one kind in one way and
another kind in another way; how to lay their eggs in the nests, how to
sit upon them, how to hatch their young and feed them, and to turn them
out of their home when they are able to shift for themselves. They know,
too, their enemies that they must avoid and their friends with whom they
may associate, and this from early infancy; not to mention the wonders
in the eggs themselves, in which all things lie ready in their order for
the formation and nourishment of the chicks; besides numberless other
things. \[4\] Who that thinks from any wisdom of reason will ever say
that these instincts are from any other source than the spiritual world,
which the natural serves in clothing what is from it with a body, or in
presenting in effect what is spiritual in the cause? The beasts of the
earth and the birds of the air are born into all this knowledge, while
man, who is far superior to them, is not; for the reason that animals
are in the order of their life, and have not been able to destroy what
is in them from the spiritual world, because they have no rational
faculty. Man, on the other hand, whose thought is from the spiritual
world, having perverted what is in him from that world by a life
contrary to order, which his rational faculty has favored, must needs be
born into mere ignorance and afterwards be led back by Divine means into
the order of heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="109.">109.</span></span>

How the things in the vegetable kingdom correspond can be seen from many
instances, as that little seeds grow into trees, put forth leaves,
produce flowers, and then fruit, in which again they deposit seed, these
things taking place in succession and existing together in an order so
wonderful as to be indescribable in a few words. Volumes might be
filled, and yet there would be still deeper arcana, relating more
closely to their uses, which science would be unable to exhaust. Since
these things, too, are from the spiritual world, that is, from heaven,
which is in the human form (as has been shown above in its own chapter),
so all the particulars in this kingdom have a certain relation to such
things as are in man, as some in the learned world know. That all things
in this kingdom also are correspondences has been made clear to me by
much experience. Often when I have been in gardens and have been looking
at the trees, fruits, flowers, and plants there, I have recognized their
correspondences in heaven, and have spoken with those with whom these
were, and have been taught whence and what they were.

<span class="margnote"><span id="110.">110.</span></span>

But at the present day no one can know the spiritual things in heaven to
which the natural things in the world correspond except from heaven,
since the knowledge of correspondences is now wholly lost. But the
nature of the correspondence of spiritual things with natural I shall be
glad to illustrate by some examples. The animals of the earth correspond
in general to affection, mild and useful animals to good affections,
fierce and useless ones to evil affections. In particular, cattle and
their young correspond to the affections of the natural mind, sheep and
lambs to the affections of the spiritual mind; while birds correspond,
according to their species, to the intellectual things of the natural or
the spiritual mind. <span id="fr_77"></span>[110-1](#fn_77.md) For this
reason various animals, as cattle and their young, rams, sheep,
he-goats, and she-goats, he-lambs and she-lambs, also pigeons and
turtledoves, were devoted to a sacred use in the Israelitish Church,
which was a representative church, and sacrifices and burnt offerings
were made of them. For they correspond in that use to spiritual things,
and in heaven these were understood in accordance with the
correspondences. Moreover, animals according to their kinds and species,
because they have life, are affections; and the life of each one is
solely from affection and in accordance with affection; consequently
every animal has an innate knowledge that is in accord with its life's
affection. Man is like an animal so far as his natural man is concerned,
and is therefore likened to animals in common speech; for example, if he
is gentle he is called a sheep or lamb, if fierce a bear or wolf, if
cunning a fox or serpent, and so on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="111.">111.</span></span>

There is a like correspondence with things in the vegetable kingdom. In
general, a garden corresponds to the intelligence and wisdom of heaven;
and for this reason heaven is called the Garden of God, and
Paradise; <span id="fr_78"></span>[111-1](#fn_78.md) and men call it the
heavenly paradise. Trees, according to their species, correspond to the
perceptions and knowledges of good and truth which are the source of
intelligence and wisdom. For this reason the ancient people, who were
acquainted with correspondences, held their sacred worship in
groves; <span id="fr_79"></span>[111-2](#fn_79.md) and for the same reason
trees are so often mentioned in the Word, and heaven, the church, and
man are compared to them; as the vine, the olive, the cedar, and others,
and the good works done by men are compared to fruits. Also the food
derived from trees, and more especially from the grain harvests of the
field, corresponds to affections for good and truth, because these
affections feed the spiritual life, as the food of the earth does the
natural life; <span id="fr_80"></span>[111-3](#fn_80.md) and bread from
grain, in a general sense, because it is the food that specially
sustains life, and because it stands for all food, corresponds to an
affection for all good. It is on account of this correspondence that the
Lord calls Himself the bread of life; and that loaves of bread had a
holy use in the Israelitish Church, being placed on the table in the
tabernacle and called "the bread of faces;" also the Divine worship that
was performed by sacrifices and burnt offerings was called "bread."
Moreover, because of this correspondence the most holy act of worship in
the Christian Church is the Holy Supper, in which bread is given, and
wine. <span id="fr_81"></span>[111-4](#fn_81.md) From these few examples
the nature of correspondence can be seen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="112.">112.</span></span>

How conjunction of heaven with the world is effected by means of
correspondences shall also be told in a few words. The Lord's kingdom is
a kingdom of ends, which are uses; or what is the same thing, a kingdom
of uses which are ends. For this reason the universe has been so created
and formed by the Divine that uses may be every where clothed in such a
way as to be presented in act, or in effect, first in heaven and
afterwards in the world, thus by degrees and successively, down to the
outmost things of nature. Evidently, then, the correspondence of natural
things with spiritual things, or of the world with heaven, is through
uses, and uses are what conjoin; and the form in which uses are clothed
are correspondences and are conjunctions just to the extent that they
are forms of uses. In the nature of the world in its threefold kingdom,
all things that exist in accordance with order are forms of uses, or
effects formed from use for use, and this is why the things in nature
are correspondences. But in the case of man, so far as he is in
accordance with Divine order, that is, so far as he is in love to the
Lord and in charity towards the neighbor, are his acts uses in form, and
correspondences, and through these he is conjoined to heaven. To love
the Lord and the neighbor means in general to perform uses. <span
id="fr_82"></span>[112-1](#fn_82.md) Furthermore, it must be understood
that man is the means by which the natural world and the spiritual world
are conjoined, that is, man is the medium of conjunction, because in him
there is a natural world and there is a spiritual world (see above, n.
57); consequently to the extent that man is spiritual he is the medium
of conjunction; but to the extent that a man is natural, and not
spiritual, he is not a medium of conjunction. Nevertheless, apart from
this mediumship of man, a Divine influx into the world and into the
things pertaining to man that are of the world goes on, but not into
man's rational faculty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="113.">113.</span></span>

As all things that are in accord with Divine order correspond to heaven,
so all things contrary to Divine order correspond to hell. All things
that correspond to heaven have relation to good and truth; but those
that correspond to hell have relation to evil and falsity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="114.">114.</span></span>

Something shall now be said about the knowledge of correspondences and
its use. It has been said above that the spiritual world, which is
heaven, is conjoined with the natural world by means of correspondences;
therefore by means of correspondences communication with heaven is
granted to man. For the angels of heaven do not think from natural
things, as man does; but when man has acquired a knowledge of
correspondences he is able, in respect to the thoughts of his mind, to
be associated with the angels, and thus in respect to his spiritual or
internal man to be conjoined with them. That there might be such a
conjunction of heaven with man the Word was written wholly by
correspondences, each thing and all things in it being
correspondent. <span id="fr_83"></span>[114-1](#fn_83.md) If man,
therefore, had a knowledge of correspondences he would understand the
spiritual sense of the Word, and from that it would be given him to know
arcana of which he sees nothing in the sense of the letter. For there is
a literal sense and there is a spiritual sense in the Word, the literal
sense made up of such things as are in the world, and the spiritual
sense of such things as are in heaven. And such a Word, in which
everything down to the least jot is a correspondence, was given to men
because the conjunction of heaven with the world is effected by means of
correspondences. <span id="fr_84"></span>[114-2](#fn_84.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="115.">115.</span></span>

I have been taught from heaven that the most ancient men on our earth,
who were celestial men, thought from correspondences themselves, the
natural things of the world before their eyes serving them as means of
thinking in this way; and that they could be in fellowship with angels
and talk with them because they so thought, and that thus through them
heaven was conjoined to the world. For this reason that period was
called the Golden Age, of which it is said by ancient writers that the
inhabitants of heaven dwelt with men and associated with them as friends
with friends. But after this there followed a period when men thought,
not from correspondences themselves, but from a knowledge of
correspondences, and there was then also a conjunction of heaven with
man, but less intimate. This period was called the Silver Age. After
this there followed men who had a knowledge of correspondences but did
not think from that knowledge, because they were in natural good, and
not, like those before them in spiritual good. This period was called
the Copper Age. After this man gradually became external, and finally
corporeal, and then the knowledge of correspondences was wholly lost,
and with it a knowledge of heaven and of the many things pertaining to
heaven. It was from correspondence that these ages were named from gold,
silver, and copper, <span id="fr_85"></span>[115-1](#fn_85.md) and for the
reason that from correspondence gold signifies celestial good in which
were the most ancient people, silver spiritual good in which were the
ancient people that followed, and copper natural good in which were the
next posterity; while iron, from which the last age takes its name,
signifies hard truth apart from good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="116.">116.</span></span>

THE SUN IN HEAVEN. In heaven neither the sun of the world, nor anything
from that sun, is seen, because it is wholly natural. For nature has its
beginning from that sun, and whatever is produced by means of it is
called natural. But the spiritual, to which heaven belongs, is above
nature and wholly distinct from what is natural; and there is no
communication between the two except by correspondences. What the
distinction between them is may be understood from what has been already
said about degrees (n. 38), and what the communication is from what has
been said in the two preceding chapters about correspondences.

<span class="margnote"><span id="117.">117.</span></span>

Although the sun of the world is not seen in heaven, nor anything from
that sun, there is nevertheless a sun there, and light and heat, and all
things that are in the world, with innumerable others, but not from a
like origin; since the things in heaven are spiritual, and those in the
world are natural. The sun of heaven is the Lord; the light there is the
Divine truth and the heat the Divine good that go forth from the Lord as
a sun. From this origin are all things that spring forth and are seen in
the heavens. This light and heat and things existing therefrom in heaven
will be treated of in the following chapters; in this chapter we will
speak only of the sun there. In heaven the Lord is seen as a sun, for
the reason that He is Divine love, from which all spiritual things, and
by means of the sun of the world all natural things, have their
existence. That love is what shines as a sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="118.">118.</span></span>

That the Lord is actually seen in heaven as a sun I have not only been
told by angels, but it has occasionally been granted me to see it; and
therefore what I have heard and seen respecting the Lord as a sun I
shall be glad to tell in a few words. The Lord is seen as a sun, not in
heaven, but high above the heavens; and not directly overhead or in the
zenith, but before the faces of the angels at a middle height. He is
seen at a considerable distance, in two places, one before the right eye
and the other before the left eye. Before the right eye He is seen
exactly like a sun, as it were, with a glow and size like that of the
sun of the world. But before the left eye He is not seen as a sun, but
as a moon, glowing white like the moon of our earth, and of like size,
but more brilliant, and surrounded with many little moons, as it were,
each of them of similar whiteness and splendor. The Lord is seen so
differently in two places because every person sees the Lord in
accordance with the quality of his reception of the Lord, thus He is
seen in one way by those that receive Him with the good of love, and in
another by those that receive Him with the good of faith. Those that
receive Him with the good of love see Him as a sun, fiery and flaming,
in accordance with their reception of Him; these are in His celestial
kingdom; while those that receive Him with the good of faith see Him as
a moon, white and brilliant in accordance with their reception of Him,
and these are in His spiritual kingdom. <span
id="fr_86"></span>[118-1](#fn_86.md) This is so because good of love
corresponds to fire; therefore in the spiritual sense fire is love; and
the good of faith corresponds to light, and in the spiritual sense light
is faith. <span id="fr_87"></span>[118-2](#fn_87.md) And the Lord appears
before the eyes because the interiors, which belong to the mind, see
through the eyes, from good of love through the right eye, and from good
of faith through the left eye; <span id="fr_88"></span>[118-3](#fn_88.md)
since with angels and also with men all things at the right correspond
to good from which truth is derived, and all at the left to truth that
is from good. <span id="fr_89"></span>[118-4](#fn_89.md) Good of faith is
in its essence truth from good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="119.">119.</span></span>

This is why in the Word the Lord in respect to love is likened to the
sun, and in respect to faith to the moon; also that the "sun" signifies
love from the Lord to the Lord, and the "moon" signifies faith from the
Lord in the Lord, as in the following passages: The light of the moon
shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be
sevenfold, as the light of seven days (Isa. 30:26). And when I shall
extinguish thee I will cover the heavens and make the stars thereof
dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not make her
light to shine. All luminaries of light in the heavens will I make dark
over thee, and I will set darkness upon thy land (Ezek. 32:7, 8). I will
darken the sun in his going forth, and the moon shall not make her light
to shine (Isa. 13:10) The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the
stars shall withdraw their shining. The sun shall be turned into
darkness and the moon into blood (Joel 2:2, 10, 31; 3:16). The sun
became black as sackcloth and hair, and the moon became as blood, and
the stars fell unto the earth (Apoc. 6:12, 13). Immediately after the
affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall
not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven (Matt. 24:29).
And elsewhere. In these passages the "sun" signifies love, and the
"moon" faith, and the "stars" knowledges of good and truth. <span
id="fr_90"></span>[119-1](#fn_90.md) These are said to be darkened, to lose
their light, and to fall from heaven, when they are no more. That the
Lord is seen as a sun in heaven is evident also from His appearance when
transfigured before Peter, James, and John, That His face did shine as
the sun (Matt. 17:2). These disciples thus saw the Lord when they were
withdrawn from the body, and were in the light of heaven. It was because
of this correspondence that the ancient people, with whom was a
representative church, turned the face to the sun in the east when they
were in Divine worship; and for the same reason they gave to their
temples an eastern aspect.

<span class="margnote"><span id="120.">120.</span></span>

How great the Divine love is and what it is can be seen by comparison
with the sun of the world, that it is most ardent, if you will believe
it, much more ardent than that sun. For this reason the Lord as a sun
does not flow without mediums into the heavens, but the ardor of His
love is gradually tempered on the way. These temperings appear as
radiant belts about the sun; furthermore, the angels are veiled with a
thin adapting cloud to prevent their being harmed by the influx. <span
id="fr_91"></span>[120-1](#fn_91.md) For this reason the heavens are more
or less near in accordance with reception. As the higher heavens are in
good of love they are nearest to the Lord as the sun; and as the lower
heavens are in good of faith they are farther away from Him. But those
that are in no good, like those in hell, are farthest away, at different
distances in accordance with their opposition to good. <span
id="fr_92"></span>[120-2](#fn_92.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="121.">121.</span></span>

When, however, the Lord appears in heaven, which often occurs, He does
not appear encompassed with a sun, but in the form of an angel, yet
distinguished from angels by the Divine shining through from His face,
since He is not there in person, for in person the Lord is constantly
encompassed by the sun, but He is present by look. For it is a common
occurrence in heaven for persons to appear to be present in a place
where their look is fixed or is terminated, even when this place is far
away from where they really are. This presence is called the presence of
internal sight, which will be treated of further on. I have also seen
the Lord out of the sun in an angelic form, at a height a little below
the sun; also near by in a like form, with shining face, and once in the
midst of angels as a flame-like radiance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="122.">122.</span></span>

To the angels the sun of the world appears like a dense darkness
opposite to the sun of heaven, and the moon like a darkness opposite to
the moon of heaven, and this constantly; and for the reason that the
world's fieriness corresponds to the love of self, and the light from it
corresponds to what is false from that love; and the love of self is the
direct opposite of the Divine love; and what is false from that love is
the direct opposite of the Divine truth; and the opposite of the Divine
love and the Divine truth is to the angels thick darkness. Therefore, in
the Word, to worship the sun and moon of this world and bow down to
them, signifies to love self and the falsities that spring from the love
of self, and it is said that such would be cut off. (Deut. 4:19; 16:3-5;
Jer. 8:1, 2; Ezek. 8:15, 16, 18; Apoc. 16:8; Matt. 13:6). <span
id="fr_93"></span>[122-1](#fn_93.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="123.">123.</span></span>

As it is from the Divine love that is in and from Him that the Lord
appears in heaven like a sun, so all in the heavens are turned
constantly to Him those in the celestial kingdom to Him as a sun and
those in the spiritual kingdom to Him as a moon. But those that are in
hell turn themselves to an opposite darkness and dense darkness, that
is, they turn backwards, away from the Lord; and for the reason that all
in the hells are in love of self and the world, thus antagonistic to the
Lord. Those who turn themselves to the dense darkness that is in the
place where this world's sun is are in the hells behind, and are called
genii; while those that turn themselves to the darkness that is in the
place of the moon are in the hells more in front, and are called
spirits. This is why those in the hells are said to be in darkness, and
those in the heavens in light, "darkness" signifying falsity from evil,
and "light" truth from good. They so turn themselves because all in the
other life look towards what rules in their interiors, thus to their
loves; and with angels and spirits the interiors determine the face; and
in the spiritual world quarters are not fixed, as in the natural world,
but are determined by the face. In respect to his spirit man turns
himself in like manner as a spirit does, backwards from the Lord if he
is in love of self and the world, and towards the Lord if he is in love
to the Lord and the neighbor. But of this man is ignorant, because he is
in the natural world where quarters are determined by the rising and
setting of the sun. But as this cannot be easily comprehended by men it
will be elucidated hereafter when Quarters, Space, and Time in Heaven
are treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="124.">124.</span></span>

Because the Lord is the sun of heaven and everything that is from Him
looks to Him, He is also the common center, the source of all direction
and determination. <span id="fr_94"></span>[124-1](#fn_94.md) So, too, all
things beneath are in His presence and under His auspices, both in the
heavens and on the earths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="125.">125.</span></span>

From all this what has been said and shown in previous chapters about
the Lord may now be seen in clearer light, namely: That He is the God of
heaven (n. 2-6). That it is His Divine that makes heaven (n. 7-12). That
the Lord's Divine in heaven is love to Him and charity towards the
neighbor (n. 13-19). That there is a correspondence of all things of the
world with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord (n. 87-115). Also
that the sun and moon of the world are correspondences (n. 105).

<span class="margnote"><span id="126.">126.</span></span>

LIGHT AND HEAT IN HEAVEN. That there is light in the heavens those who
think from nature alone cannot comprehend; and yet such is the light in
the heavens that it exceeds by many degrees the noon-day light of the
world. That light I have often seen, even during the evening and night.
At first I wondered when I heard the angels say that the light of this
world is little more than a shadow in comparison with the light of
heaven; but having seen it I can testify that it is so. The brightness
and splendor of the light of heaven are such as cannot be described. All
things that I have seen in the heavens have been seen in that light,
thus more clearly and distinctly than things in this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="127.">127.</span></span>

The light of heaven is not a natural light, like the light of the world,
but a spiritual light, because it is from the Lord as a sun, and that
sun is the Divine love (as has been shown in the foregoing chapter).
That which goes forth from the Lord as a sun is called in the heavens
Divine truth, but in its essence it is Divine good united to Divine
truth. From this the angels have light and heat, light from Divine
truth, and heat from Divine good. As the light of heaven, and the heat
also, are from such a source, it is evident that they are spiritual and
not natural. <span id="fr_95"></span>[127-1](#fn_95.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="128.">128.</span></span>

The Divine truth is light to the angels because the angels are spiritual
and not natural. Spiritual beings see from their sun, and natural beings
from theirs. It is from Divine truth that angels have understanding, and
their understanding is their inner sight, which flows into and produces
their outer sight; therefore in heaven whatever is seen from the Lord as
the sun is seen in light. <span id="fr_96"></span>[128-1](#fn_96.md) This
being the source of light in heaven the light is varied there in
accordance with the reception of Divine truth from the Lord; or what is
the same, in accordance with the intelligence and wisdom in which the
angels are, thus differently in the celestial kingdom and in the
spiritual kingdom, and differently in each society. In the celestial
kingdom the light appears flaming because the angels there receive light
from the Lord as a sun; but in the spiritual kingdom the light is
shining white, because the angels there receive light from the Lord as a
moon (see above, n. 118). So, too, the light differs in different
societies, and again in each society, those that are at the center being
in greater light and those in the circumference in less light (see n.
43). In a word, the angels have light in the same degree in which they
are recipients of Divine truth, that is, are in intelligence and wisdom
from the Lord; <span id="fr_97"></span>[128-2](#fn_97.md) and this is why
the angels of heaven are called angels of light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="129.">129.</span></span>

As the Lord in the heavens is Divine truth, and the Divine truth there
is light, so in the Word He is called Light, likewise all truth is from
Him, as in the following passages: Jesus said, I am the light of the
world; he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have
the light of life (John 8:12). As long as I am in the world I am the
light of the world (John 9:5). Jesus said, Yet a little while is the
light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness overtake
you. While ye have the light believe in the light, that ye may be sons
of light. I have come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth
in Me may not abide in darkness (John 12:35, 36, 46). Light has come
into the world, but men have loved the darkness rather than the light
(John 3:19). John says of the Lord: This is the true light which
lighteneth every man (John 1:9). The people that sit in darkness have
seen a great light, and to them that were sitting in the shadow of death
light is sprung up (Matt. 4:16). I will give thee for a covenant of the
people, for a light of the Gentiles (Isa. 13:6). I have established Thee
for a light of the Gentiles that Thou mayest be My salvation unto the
end of the earth (Isa. 19:6). The nations of them that are saved shall
walk in His light (Apoc. 21:24). Send out Thy light and Thy truth; let
them lead me (Psalm 43:3). In these and other passages the Lord is
called light from Divine truth, which is from Him; and the truth itself
is likewise called light. As light in the heavens is from the Lord as a
sun, so when He was transfigured before Peter, James, and John: His face
did shine as the sun, and His raiment was white as the light (Matt.
17:2). And His garments became shining, exceeding white as snow, so as
no fuller on earth can whiten them (Mark 9:3; Matt. 17:2). The Lord's
garments had this appearance because they represented Divine truth which
is from Him in the heavens, "garments" also in the Word signifying
truths, <span id="fr_98"></span>[129-1](#fn_98.md) consequently it is said
in David: O Jehovah, Thou coverest Thyself with light as with a garment
(Psalm 104:2).

<span class="margnote"><span id="130.">130.</span></span>

That light in the heavens is spiritual and that this light is Divine
truth may be inferred also from the fact that men as well as angels have
spiritual light, and have enlightenment from that light so far as they
are in intelligence and wisdom from Divine truth. Man's spiritual light
is the light of his understanding, and the objects of that light are
truths, which he arranges analytically into groups, forms into reason,
and from them draws conclusions in series. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[130-1](#fn_99.md) The natural man does not know that the
light from which the understanding sees such things is a real light, for
he neither sees it with his eyes nor perceives it by thought. And yet
there are many who recognize this light, and distinguish it from the
natural light in which those are who think naturally and not
spiritually. Those think naturally who take account of the world only,
and attribute all things to nature; while those think spiritually who
take account of heaven and attribute all things to the Divine. It has
often been granted me to perceive and also to see that there is a true
light that enlightens the mind, wholly distinct from the light that is
called natural light \[lumen\]. I have been raised up interiorly into
that light by degrees; and as I was raised up my understanding became so
enlightened as to enable me to perceive what I did not perceive before,
and finally such things as I could not even comprehend by thought from
natural light. Sometimes I felt indignant that I could not comprehend
these things when they were so clearly and plainly perceived in the
light of heaven. <span id="fr_100"></span>[130-2](#fn_100.md) Because there
is a light that belongs to the understanding, the same things are said
of it as of the eye, as that it sees and is in light when it perceives,
and is in obscurity and shade when it does not perceive, and so on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="131.">131.</span></span>

As the light of heaven is Divine truth, that light is also Divine wisdom
and intelligence; therefore to be raised up into the light of heaven
means the same as to be raised up into intelligence and wisdom and
enlightened. For this reason the angels have light in just the same
degree as they have intelligence and wisdom. Because the light of heaven
is Divine wisdom, in that light the character of everyone is recognized.
The interiors of everyone lie open to view in his face just as they are,
with not the least thing hidden. And interior angels love to have all
things that pertain to them lying open, since they will nothing but
good. It is otherwise with those beneath heaven, who do not will what is
good, and for that reason fear greatly to be seen in the light of
heaven. And wonderful to tell, while those in hell appear to one another
as men, in the light of heaven they appear as monsters, with a horrid
face and body, the exact form of their own evil. <span
id="fr_101"></span>[131-1](#fn_101.md) In respect to his spirit man
appears, when seen by angels, in a like way; if good as a man, beautiful
in accord with his good; if evil as a monster, ugly in accord with his
evil. From this it is clear that in the light of heaven all things are
made manifest, and for the reason that the light of heaven is Divine
truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="132.">132.</span></span>

As Divine truth is light in the heavens, so all truths wherever they
are, whether within an angel or outside of him, or whether within the
heavens or outside of them, emit light. Nevertheless, truths outside of
the heavens do not shine as truths within the heavens do. Truths outside
of the heavens shine coldly, like something snowy, without heat, because
they do not draw their essence from good, as truths within the heavens
do; therefore that cold light vanishes as soon as the light of heaven
falls on it, and if there is evil underneath it it is turned into
darkness. This I have occasionally seen, with many other noteworthy
things about the shining of truth, which must be omitted here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="133.">133.</span></span>

Something shall now be said about the heat of heaven. That heat in its
essence is love. It goes forth from the Lord as a sun, which is Divine
love in the Lord and from the Lord, as has been shown in the preceding
chapter. It is evident, therefore, that the heat of heaven, like the
light of heaven, is spiritual, because from the same source. <span
id="fr_102"></span>[133-1](#fn_102.md) There are two things that go forth
from the Lord as a sun, Divine truth and Divine good; Divine truth is
manifested in the heavens as light, and Divine good as heat; and yet
Divine truth and Divine good are so united that they are not two, but
one. Nevertheless, with angels they are separate, for there are angels
that receive more of Divine good than of Divine truth, and there are
those that receive more of Divine truth than of Divine good. Those who
receive more of Divine good are in the Lord's celestial kingdom, and
those who receive more of Divine truth are in His spiritual kingdom.
Those that receive both in a like degree are the most perfect angels.

<span class="margnote"><span id="134.">134.</span></span>

The heat of heaven, like the light of heaven, is everywhere different.
It is different in the celestial kingdom from what it is in the
spiritual kingdom, and it is different in each society therein. It
differs both in degree and in quality. It is more intense and more pure
in the Lord's celestial kingdom, because the angels there receive more
of Divine good; and it is less intense and pure in His spiritual
kingdom, because the angels there receive more of Divine truth. Also in
each society the heat differs in accordance with reception. There is
heat in the hells, but it is unclean heat. <span
id="fr_103"></span>[134-1](#fn_103.md) The heat in heaven is what is meant
by holy and heavenly fire, and the heat of hell by profane and infernal
fire. Both mean love - heavenly fire meaning love to the Lord and love
to the neighbor and every affection of those loves, and infernal fire
meaning love of self and love of the world and every lust of those
loves. That love is heat from a spiritual source is shown from one's
growing warm with love; for in accordance with the strength and nature
of his love a man is inflamed and grows warm; and the heat of his love
is made manifest when it is opposed. From this also it is customary to
speak of being inflamed, growing hot, burning, boiling, being on fire,
both in regard to the affections of the love of good and the lusts of
the love of evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="135.">135.</span></span>

Love going forth from the Lord as a sun is felt in heaven as heat,
because the interiors of the angels are in a state of love from the
Divine good that is from the Lord; and in consequence their exteriors
which grow warm therefrom are in a state of heat. For this reason heat
and love so correspond to each other in heaven that everyone there is in
heat such as his love is, according to what has been said just above.
This world's heat does not enter heaven at all, because it is too gross,
and is natural, and not spiritual; but with men it is otherwise, because
they are in both the spiritual world and the natural world. As to their
spirits they grow warm in exact accordance with their loves; but as to
the body they grow warm both from the heat of their spirit and from the
heat of the world. The former flows into the latter, because they
correspond. The nature of the correspondence of the two kinds of heat
can be seen from animal life, in that the love of animals-the chief of
which is the love of propagating offspring of their kind-bursts forth
and becomes active in accordance with the presence and influence of heat
from the sun of the world, which is the heat of the spring and the
summer seasons. Those who believe that the world's heat flows in and
excites these loves are greatly mistaken, for there can be no influx
from the natural into the spiritual, but only from the spiritual into
the natural. This influx is of Divine order, but the other would be
contrary to Divine order. <span id="fr_104"></span>[135-1](#fn_104.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="136.">136.</span></span>

Angels, like men, have understanding and will. The light of heaven
constitutes the life of their understanding, because that light is
Divine truth and Divine wisdom therefrom; and the heat of heaven
constitutes the life of their will, because that heat is Divine good and
Divine love therefrom. The veriest life of the angels is from heat, and
from light only so far as heat is in it. That life is from heat is shown
by the fact that when heat is taken away life perishes. The same is true
of faith without love or of truth without good; since the truth that is
called truth of faith is light, and the good that is called good of love
is heat.  <span id="fr_105"></span>[136-1](#fn_105.md) This is more clearly
shown by the heat and light of the world, to which the heat and light of
heaven correspond. By the world's heat when conjoined with light, as in
spring and summer, all things on the earth are quickened and grow, but
by light separate from heat nothing is quickened or grows, but
everything lies torpid and dies. They are not conjoined in winter, when
heat is absent though light remains. From this correspondence heaven is
called paradise, since truth is there joined with good, or faith with
love, as light is with heat in springtime on the earth. All this makes
more clear the truth set forth in its own chapter (n. 13-19), that the
Divine of the Lord in Heaven is love to Him and charity towards the
neighbor.

<span class="margnote"><span id="137.">137.</span></span>

It is said in John: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with
God, and God was the Word. All things were made through Him, and without
Him was not any thing made that hath been made. In Him was life, and the
life was the light of men. He was in the world, and the world was made
through Him. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld
His glory (1:1-14). Evidently the Lord is here meant by "the Word," for
it is said that "the Word became flesh." But what is specifically meant
by "the Word" is not known and shall therefore be explained. Here "the
Word" means the Divine truth which is in the Lord and from the
Lord; <span id="fr_106"></span>[137-1](#fn_106.md) and this is why it is
also called "the Light," which is the Divine truth, as has been already
shown in this chapter. That it was by means of Divine truth that all
things were created and made shall now be explained. \[2\] In heaven
Divine truth has all power, and apart from it there is no power
whatever. <span id="fr_107"></span>[137-2](#fn_107.md) From the Divine
truth angels are called powers, and are powers to the extent that they
are recipients or receptacles of it. By means of it they prevail over
the hells and over all that oppose them. A thousand enemies there cannot
stand against a single ray of the light of heaven, which is Divine
truth. As angels are angels by their reception of Divine truth it
follows that the entire heaven is from no other source, since heaven
consists of angels. \[3\] That there is such power in Divine truth those
cannot believe that have no other idea of truth than that it is thought
or speech, which has in it no power except as others do it from
obedience. But Divine truth has power in itself, and such power that by
means of it heaven was created and the world with all things therein.
That there is such power in Divine truth may be shown by two
comparisons-by the power of truth and good in man, and by the power of
light and heat from the sun in the world. By the power of good and truth
in man, in that everything that a man does he does from his
understanding and will-from his will by means of good and from his
understanding by means of truth; for all things in the will have
relation to good and all things in the understanding have relation to
truth. <span id="fr_108"></span>[137-3](#fn_108.md) Therefore it is from
good and truth that man moves his whole body, and a thousand things
therein rush with one accord to do their will and pleasure. This makes
clear that the whole body is formed for subservience to good and truth,
consequently is formed by good and truth. \[4\] By the power of heat and
light from the sun in the world, in that all things that grow in the
world, as trees, cereals, flowers, grasses, fruits, and seeds, come into
existence wholly by means of the heat and light of the sun; which shows
what power of producing there is in them. What, then, must be the power
in Divine light, which is Divine truth, and in Divine heat, which is
Divine good? Because heaven has its existence from these, so does the
world have its existence therefrom, since the world has its existence by
means of heaven, as has been already shown. From all this the meaning of
these words can be seen that "all things were made through the Word, and
without the Word was not anything made that has been made;" also that
"the world was made through Him," that is, through Divine truth from the
Lord. <span id="fr_109"></span>[137-4](#fn_109.md) For the same reason, in
the Book of Creation, light is first spoken of, and then the things that
are from light (Gen. 1:3, 4). For this reason also all things in the
universe, both in heaven and in the world, have relation to good and
truth and to their conjunction, in order to be any thing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="139.">139.</span></span>

It must be understood that the Divine good and the Divine truth that are
from the Lord as a sun in the heavens are not in the Lord, but are from
the Lord. In the Lord there is only Divine love, which is the Being
\[Esse\] from which the Divine good and the Divine truth spring. Outgo
\[existere\] from being \[esse\] is meant by going forth \[procedere\].
This, too, can be made clear by comparison with the world's sun. The
heat and light that are in the world are not in the sun, but are from
the sun. In the sun there is fire only, and it is from this that heat
and light spring and go forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="140.">140.</span></span>

Since the Lord as a sun is Divine love, and Divine love is Divine good
itself, the Divine that goes forth from the Lord, which is His Divine in
heaven, is called, for the sake of distinction, Divine truth, although
it is in fact Divine good united to Divine truth. This Divine truth is
what is called the Holy that goes forth from Him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="141.">141.</span></span>

THE FOUR QUARTERS IN HEAVEN. Both in heaven and in the world there are
four quarters, east, south, west, and north, determined in each world by
its own sun; in heaven by the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, in the
world by the sun of the world. And yet there are great differences
between them. In the first place, in the world that is called the south
where the sun is in its greatest altitude above the earth, north where
it is in its opposite position beneath the earth, east where it rises at
an equinox, and west where it then sets. Thus in the world it is from
the south that all the quarters are determined. But in heaven that is
called the east where the Lord is seen as a sun, opposite to this is the
west, at the right is the south in heaven, and at the left the north;
and this in whatever direction the face and the body are turned. Thus in
heaven it is from the east that all the quarters are determined. That is
called the east \[oriens\] where the Lord is seen as a sun, because all
origin \[origo\] of life is from Him as a sun; moreover, so far as
angels receive heat and light or love and intelligence from the Lord He
is said to arise \[exoriri\] upon them. For the same reason the Lord is
called the East \[Oriens\] in the Word. <span
id="fr_110"></span>[141-1](#fn_110.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="142.">142.</span></span>

Another difference is that to the angels the east is always before the
face, the west behind, the south to the right, and the north to the
left. But since this cannot be easily comprehended in the world, for the
reason that men turn the face to every quarter, it shall be explained.
The entire heaven turns itself to the Lord as to its common center; to
that center do all the angels turn themselves. Also on the earth, as is
well known, there is a directing of all things towards a common center;
but there is this difference between this directing in the world and
that in heaven, that in heaven the front parts are turned to the common
center, but in the world the lower parts of the body. In the world this
directing is called centripetal force, also gravitation. The interiors
of angels are actually turned forwards; and since interiors manifest
themselves in the face it is the face that determines the
quarters. <span id="fr_111"></span>[142-1](#fn_111.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="143.">143.</span></span>

It is still more difficult to comprehend in the world that in every
turning of their face and body the angels have the east before the face,
since man according as he turns, has every quarter before his face. This
shall also be explained. Although angels, like men, turn and direct
their faces and bodies in every direction, they nevertheless have the
east always before their eyes. But the turnings of angels are unlike the
turnings of men, because they are from a different origin. They appear
alike, but they are not. The origin of these turnings is their ruling
love, and from this all directions with angels and spirits are
determined, for, as just said, their interiors are actually turned
towards their common center, which in heaven is the Lord as a sun;
consequently their ruling love is always before their face, because
their love is always before their interiors, and the face has existence
from the interiors, for it is their outward form; and in the heavens
this love is the Lord as a sun because it is from Him that they have
their love. <span id="fr_112"></span>[143-1](#fn_112.md) And as the Lord
Himself is in angels in His love, it is the Lord who causes them to look
to Him whithersoever they turn. This cannot be explained any farther
now; but it will be made clearer to the understanding in subsequent
chapters, especially where representations and appearances, and time and
space in heaven, are treated of. That the angels have the Lord
constantly before their faces it has been granted me to know and also to
perceive from much experience; for whenever I have been in company with
angels I have noticed the Lord's presence before my face, not actually
seen, and yet perceptible in a light; and angels have often testified
that this is so. As the Lord is constantly before the faces of the
angels, so it is said in the world of those who believe in the Lord and
love Him that they have God before their eyes and their face, and that
they look to God, and see God. These expressions have their origin in
the spiritual world, from which are many things in human speech,
although their source is unknown to men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="144.">144.</span></span>

This turning to the Lord is among the wonderful things in heaven. There
may be many together in one place, some turning the face and body one
way and some another, and yet all see the Lord before them, and have
everyone has the south at his right, the north at his left, and the west
behind him. Another wonderful thing is that, although the angels look
only to the east they have also a look towards the other three quarters;
but the look to these is from their interior sight, which pertains to
their thought. And it is yet another wonderful thing that in heaven no
one is ever permitted to stand behind another and look at the back of
his head, for this would disturb the influx of good and truth from the
Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="145.">145.</span></span>

The Lord is seen by the angels, and the angels are seen by the Lord in
another way. Angels see the Lord through their eyes; but the Lord sees
the angels in the forehead, and this for the reason that the forehead
corresponds to love, and it is through love that the Lord flows into
their will, while it is through the understanding, to which the eyes
correspond, that He causes Himself to be seen. <span
id="fr_113"></span>[145-1](#fn_113.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="146.">146.</span></span>

The quarters in the heavens that give form to the Lord's celestial
kingdom differ from the quarters in the heavens that give form to His
spiritual kingdom, for the reason that He is seen by the angels in His
celestial kingdom as a sun, but by the angels in His spiritual kingdom
as a moon; and where the Lord is seen is the east. The distance there
between the position of the sun and that of the moon is thirty degrees,
and there is a like difference in the position of the quarters. That
heaven is divided into two kingdoms, called the celestial kingdom and
the spiritual kingdom, may be seen in its own chapter (n. 20-28); and
that the Lord is seen in the celestial kingdom as a sun, and in the
spiritual kingdom as a moon (n. 118). But it does not follow that the
quarters of heaven become confused on this account, for neither can the
spiritual angels ascend among the celestial angels, nor the celestial
descend among the spiritual, as may be seen above (n. 35).

<span class="margnote"><span id="147.">147.</span></span>

This makes clear the nature of the Lord's presence in the heavens, that
He is every where and with everyone in the good and truth that go forth
from Him; consequently He is with angels in what is His own, as has been
said above (n. 12). The perception of the Lord's presence is in their
interiors; and it is from these that their eyes see, and it is by this
continuity that they see the Lord outside of themselves. This shows what
is meant by the Lord's being in them and they in Him, according to His
own words: Abide in Me and I in you (John 15:4). He that eateth My flesh
and drinketh My blood abideth in Me and I in him (John 6:56). "The
Lord's flesh" signifies Divine good and "His blood" Divine truth. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[147-1](#fn_114.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="148.">148.</span></span>

All in the heavens have their own places of abode in accordance with the
quarters. Those who are in the good of love dwell towards the east and
west, those who are in clear perception of it towards the east, and
those who are in obscure perception of it towards the west. Those who
are in wisdom from the good of love dwell towards the south and
north-those who are in the clear light of wisdom towards the south, and
those who are in obscure light of it towards the north. The angels of
the Lord's spiritual kingdom and those of His celestial kingdom dwell in
a like order, but differently as their good of love and light of truth
from good differ; for in the celestial kingdom the love is love to the
Lord, and the light of truth therefrom is wisdom; while in the spiritual
kingdom there is love towards the neighbor, which is called charity, and
the light of truth therefrom is intelligence, which is also called faith
(see above, n. 23). The quarters differ also in the two kingdoms by
thirty degrees, as has been said just above (n. 146).

<span class="margnote"><span id="149.">149.</span></span>

In like order the angels in each society in heaven dwell in relation to
one another-towards the east there those who are in greater degree of
love and charity, towards the west those who are in less degree; towards
the south those who are in greater light of wisdom and intelligence, and
towards the north those who are in less. This arrangement prevails
because each society represents heaven, and is a heaven in a smaller
form (see above, n. 51-58). The same arrangement prevails in their
assemblies. They are brought into this order by virtue of the form of
heaven, from which everyone knows his own place. The Lord also provides
that there be in each society those of every kind, for the reason that
in form heaven is every where like itself; and yet the arrangement of
the whole heaven differs from the arrangement of a society as what is
general from its parts, since the societies towards the east surpass
those towards the west, and those towards the south surpass those
towards the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="150.">150.</span></span>

Because of this the quarters in the heavens signify such things as
pertain to those that dwell in them, - the east signifying love and its
good clearly perceived, the west the same obscurely perceived, the south
wisdom and intelligence in clear light, and the north the same in
obscure light. And because of this signification of the quarters in
heaven they have a like signification in the internal or spiritual sense
of the Word, <span id="fr_115"></span>[150-1](#fn_115.md) since the
internal or spiritual sense of the Word is in entire accord with what is
in heaven.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_75"></span>[106-1](hh03.htm#fr_75.md) All things that are in
the world and its three kingdoms correspond to the heavenly things that
are in heaven, that is, the things in the natural world correspond to
the things in the spiritual world (n. 1632, 1881, 2758, 2760-2763,
2987-3003, 3213-3227, 3483, 3624-3649, 4044, 4053, 4116, 4366, 4939,
5116, 5377, 5428, 5477, 9280). By correspondences the natural world is
conjoined to the spiritual world (n. 8615). For this reason all nature
is a theatre representative of the Lord's kingdom (n. 2758, 2999, 3000,
3483, 4938, 4939, 8848, 9280).

<span id="fn_76"></span>[107-1](hh03.htm#fr_76.md) Everything in the
universe, both in heaven and in the world, that is in accordance with
order, has reference to good and truth (n. 2451, 3166, 4390, 4409, 5232,
7256, 10122); and to the conjunction of these, in order to be any thing
(n. 10555).

<span id="fn_77"></span>[110-1](hh03.htm#fr_77.md) From correspondence
animals signify affections; mild and useful animals good affections,
fierce and useless ones evil affections (n. 41, 45, 46, 142, 143, 246,
714, 716, 719, 2179, 2180, 3519, 9280); illustrated by experience from
the spiritual world (n. 3218, 5198, 9090). Influx of the spiritual world
into the lives of animals in. 1633, 3646). Cattle and their young from
correspondence signify affections of the natural mind (n. 2180, 2566,
9391, 10132, 10407). What sheep signify (n. 4169, 4809); and lambs (n.
3994, 10132). Flying creatures signify intellectual things (n. 40, 745,
776, 778, 866, 988, 991, 5149, 7441); with a difference according to
their genera and species, from experience in the spiritual world (n.
3219).

<span id="fn_78"></span>[111-1](hh03.htm#fr_78.md) From correspondence a
garden and a paradise signify intelligence and wisdom (n. 100, 108);
from experience (n. 3220). All things that have a correspondence have in
the Word the same significance (n. 2896, 2987, 2989, 2990, 2991, 3002,
3225).

<span id="fn_79"></span>[111-2](hh03.htm#fr_79.md) Trees signify
perceptions and knowledges (n. 103, 2163, 2682, 2722, 2972, 7692). For
this reason the ancient people held Divine worship in groves under trees
according to their correspondence (n. 2722, 4552). Influx of heaven into
subjects of the vegetable kingdom, as into trees and plants (n. 3648).

<span id="fn_80"></span>[111-3](hh03.htm#fr_80.md) From correspondence
foods signify such things as nourish the spiritual life (n. 3114, 4459,
4792, 4976, 5147, 5293, 5340, 5342, 5410, 5426, 5576, 5582, 5588, 5655,
5915, 6277, 8562, 9003).

<span id="fn_81"></span>[111-4](hh03.htm#fr_81.md) Bread signifies every
good that nourishes the spiritual life of man (n. 2165, 2177, 3478,
3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 9323, 9545, 10686). Such was the
signification of the loaves that were on the table in the tabernacle (n.
3478, 9545). Sacrifices in general were called bread (n. 2165). Bread
includes all food (n. 2165). Thus it signifies all heavenly and
spiritual food (n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3478, 6118, 8410).

<span id="fn_82"></span>[112-1](hh03.htm#fr_82.md) Every good has its
delight as well as its quality from use and in accordance with use;
therefore such as the use is, such is the good (n. 3049, 4984, 7038).
Angelic life consists in the goods of love and charity, that is, in
performing uses (n. 454). The Lord, and consequently the angels, look
only, in regard to man, to ends, which are uses (n. 1317, 1645, 5854).
The Lord's kingdom is a kingdom of uses that is, of ends (n. 454, 696,
1103, 3645, 4054, 7038). Serving the Lord is performing uses (n. 7038).
Each thing and all things in man have been formed for use (n. 3626,
4104, 5189 9297; also from use, that is, the use is prior to the organic
forms in man through which the use is performed, because use is from the
inflowing of the Lord through heaven in. 4223, 4926). Moreover man's
interiors, which constitute his mind, when he grows to maturity are
formed from use and for use (n. 1964, 6815, 9297). Consequently man is
such as are the uses with him (n. 1568, 3570, 4054, 6571, 6935, 6938,
10284). Uses are the ends for the sake of which (n. 3565, 4054, 4104,
6815). Use is the first and the last, thus the all of man (n. 1964).

<span id="fn_83"></span>[114-1](hh03.htm#fr_83.md) The Word was written
wholly by correspondences (n. 8615). By means, of the Word man has
conjunction with heaven (n. 2899, 6943, 9396, 9400, 9401, 10375, 10452).

<span id="fn_84"></span>[114-2](hh03.htm#fr_84.md) Concerning the spiritual
sense of the Word see the little work on The White Horse referred to in
the Apocalypse.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[115-1](hh03.htm#fr_85.md) Gold from correspondence
signifies celestial good (n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 9510,
9874, 9881). Silver signifies spiritual good, that is, truth from a
celestial origin (n. 1551, 1552, 2954, 5658). Copper signifies natural
good (n. 425, 1551). Iron signifies truth in the outmost of order (n.
425, 426).

<span id="fn_86"></span>[118-1](hh03.htm#fr_86.md) The Lord is seen in
heaven as a sun, and is the sun of heaven (n. 1053, 3636, 3643, 4060).
The Lord is seen as a sun by those who are in His celestial kingdom,
where love to Him reigns, and as a moon by those who are in His
spiritual kingdom, where charity to the neighbor and faith reign (n.
1521, 1529-1531, 1837, 4696). The Lord is seen as a sun at a middle
height before the right eye, and an a moon before the left eye (n. 1053,
1521, 1529-1531, 3636, 3643, 4321, 5097, 7078, 7083, 7173, 7270, 8812,
10809). The Lord is seen as a sun and as a moon (n. 1531, 7173). The
Lord's Divine Itself is far above His Divine in heaven (n. 7270, 8760).

<span id="fn_87"></span>[118-2](hh03.htm#fr_87.md) "Fire" in the Word
signifies love, both in a good sense and in a bad sense (n. 934, 4906,
5215). Holy or heavenly fire signifies the Divine Love (n. 934, 6314,
6832). Infernal fire signifies love of self and of the world and every
lust of those loves (n. 1861, 5071, 6314, 6832, 7575, 10747). Love is
the fire of life and life itself is really from it (n. 4906, 5071, 6032,
6314). "Light" signifies the truth of faith (n. 3195, 3485, 3636, 3643,
3993, 4302, 4413, 4415, 9548, 9684).

<span id="fn_88"></span>[118-3](hh03.htm#fr_88.md) The sight of the left
eye corresponds to truths of faith, and the sight of the right eye to
their goods (n. 4410, 6923).

<span id="fn_89"></span>[118-4](hh03.htm#fr_89.md) The things on man's
right have relation to good from which is truth, and those on his left
to truth from good (n. 9495, 9604).

<span id="fn_90"></span>[119-1](hh03.htm#fr_90.md) "Stars" and
"constellations" in the Word signify knowledges of good and truth (n.
2495, 2849, 4697).

<span id="fn_91"></span>[120-1](hh03.htm#fr_91.md) What the Lord's Divine
love is, and how great it is, illustrated by comparison with the fire of
this world's sun (n. 6834, 6849, 8644). The Lord's Divine love is love
toward the whole human race to save it (n. 1820, 1865, 2253, 6872). The
love that first goes forth from the fire of the Lord's love does not
enter heaven, but is seen as radiant belts about the sun (n. 7270). The
angels are veiled with a corresponding thin cloud, to prevent their
being harmed by the glow of burning love (n. 6849).

<span id="fn_92"></span>[120-2](hh03.htm#fr_92.md) The Lord's presence with
the angels is in proportion to their reception of good of love and faith
from Him (n. 904, 4198, 4320, 6280, 6832, 7042, 8819, 9680, 9682, 9683,
10106, 10811). The Lord appears to each one in accordance with what he
is (n. 1861, 3235, 4198, 4206). The hells are at a distance from the
heavens because they cannot bear the presence of Divine love from the
Lord (n. 4299, 7519, 7738, 7989, 8137, 8265, 9327). For this reason the
hells are very far away from the heavens, and this is the "great gulf"
(n. 9346, 10187).

<span id="fn_93"></span>[122-1](hh03.htm#fr_93.md) The sun of the world is
not seen by the angels, but in its place something dark behind, opposite
to the sun of heaven or the Lord (n. 7078, 9755). In the opposite sense
the sun signifies the love of self (n. 2441); and in this sense "to
worship the sun" signifies to worship what is contrary to heavenly love
or to the Lord (n. 2441, 10584). To those in the hells the sun of heaven
is thick darkness (n. 2441).

<span id="fn_94"></span>[124-1](hh03.htm#fr_94.md) The Lord is the common
center to which all things of heaven turn (n. 3633, 3641).

<span id="fn_95"></span>[127-1](hh03.htm#fr_95.md) All light in the heavens
is from the Lord as a sun (n. 1053, 1521, 3195, 3341, 3636, 3643, 4415,
9548, 9684, 10809). The Divine truth that goes forth from the Lord
appears in heaven as light, and furnishes all the light of heaven (n.
3195, 3222, 3223, 5400, 8644, 9399, 9548, 9684).

<span id="fn_96"></span>[128-1](hh03.htm#fr_96.md) The light of heaven
illumines both the sight and the understanding of angels and spirits (n.
2776, 3138).

<span id="fn_97"></span>[128-2](hh03.htm#fr_97.md) The light in heaven is
in harmony with the intelligence and wisdom of the angels (n. 1524,
1529, 1530, 3339). Differences of light in the heavens are as many as
there are angelic societies; and as there are in the heavens endless
varieties of good and truth, so are there of wisdom and intelligence (n.
684, 690, 3241, 3744, 3745, 4414, 5598, 7236, 7833, 7836).

<span id="fn_98"></span>[129-1](hh03.htm#fr_98.md) In the Word "garments"
signify truths, because truths clothe good (n. 1073, 2576, 5248, 5319,
5954, 9216, 9952, 10536). The Lord's garments when He was transfigured
signified Divine truth going forth from His Divine love (n. 9212, 9216).

<span id="fn_99"></span>[130-1](hh03.htm#fr_99.md) Man is rational because
his understanding is illumined by the light of heaven (n. 1524, 3138,
3167, 4408, 6608, 8707, 9128, 9399, 10569). The understanding is
enlightened because it is a recipient of truth (n. 6222, 6608, 10659).
The understanding is enlightened to the extent that man receives truth
in good from the lord (n. 3619). The understanding is such as are the
truths from good by which it is formed (n. 10064). The understanding has
light from heaven, as the sight has light from the world (n. 1524, 5114,
6608, 9128). The light of heaven from the Lord is always present with
man, but it flows in only in the degree that man is in truth from good
(n. 4060, 4214).

<span id="fn_100"></span>[130-2](hh03.htm#fr_100.md) When man is raised up
from the sensual he comes into a milder light, and at length into
heavenly light (n. 6313, 6315, 9407). When man is raised up into
intelligence there is an actual elevation into the light of heaven (n.
3190). How great a light was perceived when I was withdrawn from worldly
ideas (n. 1526, 6608).

<span id="fn_101"></span>[131-1](hh03.htm#fr_101.md) Those in the hells, in
their own light, which is like the light from burning coals, appear to
themselves as men but in the light of heaven they appear as monsters (n.
4531, 4533, 4674, 5057, 5058, 6605, 6626).

<span id="fn_102"></span>[133-1](hh03.htm#fr_102.md) There are two sources
of heat and also two sources of light, the sun of the world and the sun
of heaven (n. 3338, 5215, 7324). Heat from the Lord as a sun is
affection of love (n. 3636, 3643). Therefore spiritual heat in its
essence is love (n. 2146, 3338, 3339, 6314).

<span id="fn_103"></span>[134-1](hh03.htm#fr_103.md) There is heat in the
hells, but it is unclean (n. 1773, 2757, 3340). The odor from it is like
the odor from dung and excrement in the world and in the worst hells
like the odor of dead bodies (n. 814, 815, 817, 819, 820, 943, 944,
5394).

<span id="fn_104"></span>[135-1](hh03.htm#fr_104.md) There is spiritual
influx, but not physical, that is, there is influx from the spiritual
world into the natural, but not from the natural world into the
spiritual (n. 3219, 5119, 5259, 5427, 5428, 5477, 6322, 9109, 9110,
9111).

<span id="fn_105"></span>[136-1](hh03.htm#fr_105.md) Truths apart from good
are not in themselves truths because they have no life; for truths have
all their life from good (n. 9603). Thus truths apart from good are like
a body without a soul (n. 3180, 9154). Truths apart from good are not
accepted by the Lord (n. 4368). What truth apart from good, that is,
what faith apart from love is, and what truth from good or faith from
love is (n. 1949-1951, 1964, 5830, 5951). It amounts to the same thing
whether you say truth or faith, or whether you say good or love, since
truth is of faith and good is of love (n. 2839, 4352, 4353, 4997, 7178,
7623, 7624, 10367).

<span id="fn_106"></span>[137-1](hh03.htm#fr_106.md) In the Sacred
Scripture word signifies various things, namely, speech, thought of the
mind, any thing that really exists, also something, and in the highest
sense Divine truth, and the Lord (n. 9987). "Word" signifies Divine
truth (n. 2803, 2894, 4692, 5075, 5272, 9383, 9987). "Word" signifies
the Lord (n. 2533, 2859).

<span id="fn_107"></span>[137-2](hh03.htm#fr_107.md) Divine truth going
forth from the Lord has all power (n. 6948, 8200). Truth from good has
all power in heaven (n. 3091, 3563, 6344, 6423, 8304, 9643, 10019,
10182). Angels are called powers, and are powers by the reception of
Divine truth from the Lord (n. 9639). Angels are recipients of Divine
truth from the Lord and therefore in the Word are sometimes called gods
(n. 4295, 4402, 7873, 8192, 8301).

<span id="fn_108"></span>[137-3](hh03.htm#fr_108.md) The understanding is a
recipient of truth, and the will a recipient of good (n. 3623, 6125,
7503, 9300, 9930). Therefore all things in the understanding have
relation to truths, whether they are really truths or are believed by
man to be truths, and all things in the will in like manner have
relation to goods (n. 803, 10122).

<span id="fn_109"></span>[137-4](hh03.htm#fr_109.md) Divine truth going
forth from the Lord is the only real thing (n. 6880, 7004, 8200). By
means of Divine truth all things were created and made (n. 2803, 2884,
5272, 7678).

<span id="fn_110"></span>[141-1](hh03.htm#fr_110.md) In the highest sense
the Lord is the east \[oriens\], because He is the sun of heaven, which
is always rising and never setting (n. 101, 5097, 9668).

<span id="fn_111"></span>[142-1](hh03.htm#fr_111.md) In heaven all turn
themselves to the Lord (n. 9828, 10130, 10189, 10420). Nevertheless, it
is not the angels that turn themselves to the Lord, but the Lord turns
the angels to Himself (n. 10189). It is not that the angels are present
with the Lord, but the Lord is present with the angels (n. 9415).

<span id="fn_112"></span>[143-1](hh03.htm#fr_112.md) In the spiritual world
all constantly turn themselves to their loves; and the quarters there
have their beginning in the face and are determined by it (n. 10130,
10189, 10420, 10702). The face is formed to a correspondence with the
interiors (n. 4791-4805, 5695). Therefore the interiors shine forth from
the face (n. 3527, 4066, 4796). With angels the face makes one with the
interiors (n. 4796, 4797, 4799, 5695, 8250). The influx of the interiors
into the face and its muscles (n. 3631, 4800).

<span id="fn_113"></span>[145-1](hh03.htm#fr_113.md) The forehead
corresponds to heavenly love; therefore in the Word the "forehead"
signifies that love (n. 9936). The eye corresponds to the understanding,
because the understanding is internal sight (n. 2701, 4410, 4526, 9051,
10569). For this reason "to lift up the eyes" and "to see" signifies to
understand, perceive, and observe (n. 2789, 2829, 3198, 3202, 4083,
4086, 4339, 5684).

<span id="fn_114"></span>[147-1](hh03.htm#fr_114.md) In the Word "the
Lord's flesh" signifies His Divine Human, and the Divine good of His
love (n. 3813, 7850, 9127, 10283). And "the Lord's blood" signifies
Divine truth and the holy of faith (n. 4735, 4978, 6978, 7317, 7326,
7846, 7850, 7877, 9127, 9393, 10026, 10033, 10152, 10210).

<span id="fn_115"></span>[150-1](hh03.htm#fr_115.md) In the Word the "east"
signifies love clearly perceived (n. 1250, 3708); the "west" love
obscurely perceived (n. 3708, 9653); the "south" a state of light, that
is, of wisdom and intelligence (n. 1458, 3708, 5672); and the "north"
that state in obscurity (n. 3708).
