### Heaven and Hell

<span class="margnote"><span id="401.">401.</span></span>

One who is in the love of self and love of the world perceives while he
lives in the body a sense of delight from these loves and also in the
particular pleasures derived from these loves. But one who is in love to
God and in love towards the neighbor does not perceive while he lives in
the body any distinct sense of delight from these loves or from the good
affections derived from them, but only a blessedness that is hardly
perceptible, because it is hidden away in his interiors and veiled by
the exteriors pertaining to the body and dulled by the cares of the
world. But after death these states are entirely changed. The delights
of love of self and of the world are then turned into what is painful
and direful, because into such things as are called infernal fire, and
by turns into things defiled and filthy corresponding to their unclean
pleasures, and these, wonderful to tell, are then delightful to them.
But the obscure delight and almost imperceptible blessedness of those
that had been while in the world in love to God and in love to the
neighbor are then turned into the delight of heaven, and become in every
way perceived and felt, for the blessedness that lay hidden and
unrecognized in their interiors while they lived in the world is then
revealed and brought forth into evident sensation, because such had been
the delight of their spirit, and they are then in the spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="402.">402.</span></span>

In uses all the delights of heaven are brought together and are present,
because uses are the goods of love and charity in which angels are;
therefore everyone has delights that are in accord with his uses, and in
the degree of his affection for use. That all the delights of heaven are
delights of use can be seen by a comparison with the five bodily senses
of man. There is given to each sense a delight in accordance with its
use; to the sight, the hearing, the smell, the taste, and the touch,
each its own delight; to the sight a delight from beauty and from forms,
to the hearing from harmonious sounds, to the smell from pleasing odors,
to taste from fine flavors. These uses which the senses severally
perform are known to those who study them, and more fully to those who
are acquainted with correspondences. Sight has such a delight because of
the use it performs to the understanding, which is the inner sight; the
hearing has such a delight because of the use it performs both to the
understanding and to the will through giving attention; the smell has
such a delight because of the use it performs to the brain, and also to
the lungs; the taste has such a delight because of the use it performs
to the stomach, and thus to the whole body by nourishing it. The delight
of marriage, which is a purer and more exquisite delight of touch,
transcends all the rest because of its use, which is the procreation of
the human race and thereby of angels of heaven. These delights are in
these sensories by an influx of heaven, where every delight pertains to
use and is in accordance with use.

<span class="margnote"><span id="403.">403.</span></span>

There were some spirits who believed from an opinion adopted in the
world that heavenly happiness consists in an idle life in which they
would be served by others; but they were told that happiness never
consists in abstaining from work and getting satisfaction therefrom.
This would mean everyone's desiring the happiness of others for himself,
and what everyone wished for no one would have. Such a life would be an
idle not an active life, and would stupefy all the powers of life; and
everyone ought to know that without activity of life there can be no
happiness of life, and that rest from this activity should be only for
the sake of recreation, that one may return with more vigor to the
activity of his life. They were then shown by many evidences that
angelic life consists in performing the good works of charity, which are
uses, and that the angels find all their happiness in use, from use, and
in accordance with use. To those that held the opinion that heavenly joy
consists in living an idle life and drawing breaths of eternal joy in
idleness, a perception was given of what such a life is, that they might
become ashamed of the idea; and they saw that such a life is extremely
sad, and that all joy thus perishing they would in a little while feel
only loathing and disgust for it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="404.">404.</span></span>

There were some spirits who thought themselves better instructed than
others, and who said that they had believed in the world that heavenly
joy would consist solely in praising and giving glory to God, and that
this would be an active life. But these were told that praising and
giving glory to God is not a proper active life, also that God has no
need of praises and glorification, but it is His will that they should
perform uses, and thus the good works that are called goods of charity.
But they were unable to associate with goods of charity any idea of
heavenly joy, but only of servitude, although the angels testified that
this joy is most free because it comes from an interior affection and is
conjoined with ineffable delight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="405.">405.</span></span>

Almost all who enter the other life think that hell is the same to
everyone, and heaven the same; and yet in both there are infinite
varieties and diversities, and in no case is hell or heaven wholly the
same to one as to another; as it is impossible that any one man, spirit
or angel should ever be wholly like another even as to the face. At my
mere thought of two being just alike or equal the angels expressed
horror, saying that everyone thing is formed out of the harmonious
concurrence of many things, and that the one thing is such as that
concurrence is; and that it is thus that a whole society in heaven
becomes a one, and that all the societies of heaven together become a
one, and this from the Lord alone by means of love. <span
id="fr_251"></span>[405-1](#fn_251.md) Uses in the heavens are likewise in
all variety and diversity, and in no case is the use of one wholly the
same as and identical with the use of another; so neither is the
happiness of one the same as and identical with the happiness of
another. Furthermore, the delights of each use are innumerable, and
these innumerable delights are likewise various, and yet conjoined in
such order that they mutually regard each other, like the uses of each
member, organ, and viscus, in the body, and still more like the uses of
each vessel and fiber in each member, organ and viscus; each and all of
which are so affiliated as to have regard to another's good in their own
good, and thus each in all, and all in each. From this universal and
individual aspect they act as one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="406.">406.</span></span>

I have talked at times with spirits that had recently come from the
world about the state of eternal life, saying that it is important to
know who the Lord of the kingdom is, and what kind and what form of
government it has. As nothing is more important for those entering
another kingdom in the world than to know who and what the king is, and
what the government is, and other particulars in regard to the kingdom,
so is it of still greater consequence in regard to this kingdom in which
they are to live to eternity. Therefore they should know that it is the
Lord who governs both heaven and the universe, for He who governs the
one governs the other; thus that the kingdom in which they now are is
the Lord's; and that the laws of this kingdom are eternal truths, all of
which rest upon the law that the Lord must be loved above all things and
the neighbor as themselves; and even more than this, if they would be
like the angels they must love the neighbor more than themselves. On
hearing this they could make no reply, for the reason that although they
had heard in the life of the body something like this they had not
believed it, wondering how there could be such love in heaven, and how
it could be possible for any one to love his neighbor more than himself.
But they were told that every good increases immeasurably in the other
life, and that while they cannot go further in the life of the body than
to love the neighbor as themselves, because they are immersed in what
concerns the body, yet when this is set aside their love becomes more
pure, and finally becomes angelic, which is to love the neighbor more
than themselves. For in the heavens there is joy in doing good to
another, but no joy in doing good to self unless with a view to its
becoming another's, and thus for another's sake. This is loving the
neighbor more than oneself. They were told that the possibility of such
a love is shown in the world in the marriage love of some who have
suffered death to protect a consort from injury, in the love of parents
for their children, as in a mother's preferring to go hungry rather than
see her child go hungry; in sincere friendship, in which one friend will
expose himself to danger for another; and even in polite and pretended
friendship that wishes to emulate sincere friendship, in offering the
better things to those to whom it professes to wish well, and bearing
such good will on the lips though not in the heart; finally, in the
nature of love, which is such that its joy is to serve others, not for
its own sake but for theirs. But all this was incomprehensible to those
who loved themselves more than others, and in the life of the body had
been greedy of gain; most of all to the avaricious.

<span class="margnote"><span id="407.">407.</span></span>

There was one who in the life of the body had exercised power over
others, and who had retained in the other life the desire to rule; but
he was told that he was now in another kingdom, which is eternal, and
that his rule on earth had perished, and that he was now where no one is
esteemed except in accordance with his goodness and truth, and that
measure of the Lord's mercy which he enjoyed by virtue of his life in
the world; also that the same is true in this kingdom as on the earth,
where men are esteemed for their wealth and for their favor with the
prince, wealth here being good and truth, and favor with the prince the
mercy bestowed on man by the Lord in accordance with his life in the
world. Any wish to rule otherwise would make him a rebel, since he is in
another's kingdom. On hearing these things he was ashamed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="408.">408.</span></span>

I have talked with spirits who believed heaven and heavenly joy to
consist in their being great; but such were told that in heaven he that
is least is greatest, since he is called least who has, and wishes to
have, no power or wisdom from himself, but only from the Lord, he that
is least in that sense having the greatest happiness, and as he has the
greatest happiness, it follows that he is greatest; for he has thereby
from the Lord all power and excels all in wisdom. What is it to be the
greatest unless to be the most happy? For to be the most happy is what
the powerful seek through power and the rich through riches. It was
further said that heaven does not consist in a desire to be least for
the purpose of being greatest, for that would be aspiring and longing to
be the greatest; but it consists in desiring from the heart the good of
others more than one's own, and in serving others with a view to their
happiness, not with recompense as an end, but from love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="409.">409.</span></span>

Heavenly joy itself, such as it is in its essence, cannot be described,
because it is in the inmost of the life of angels and therefrom in
everything of their thought and affection, and from this in every
particular of their speech and action. It is as if the interiors were
fully opened and unloosed to receive delight and blessedness, which are
distributed to every least fiber and thus through the whole. Thus the
perception and sensation of this joy is so great as to be beyond
description, for that which starts from the inmosts flows into every
particular derived from the inmosts, propagating itself away with
increase towards the exteriors. Good spirits who are not yet in that
joy, because not yet raised up into heaven, when they perceive a sense
of that joy from an angel from the sphere of his love, are filled with
such delight that they come as it were into a delicious trance. This
sometimes happens with those who desire to know what heavenly joy is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="410.">410.</span></span>

When certain spirits wished to know what heavenly joy is they were
allowed to feel it to such a degree that they could no longer bear it;
and yet it was not angelic joy; it was scarcely in the least degree
angelic, as I was permitted to perceive by sharing it, but was so slight
as to be almost frigid; nevertheless they called it most heavenly,
because to them it was an inmost joy. From this it was evident, not only
that there are degrees of the joys of heaven, but also that the inmost
joy of one scarcely reaches to the outmost or middle joy of another;
also that when any one receives his own inmost joy he is in his heavenly
joy, and cannot endure what is still more interior, for such a joy
becomes painful to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="411.">411.</span></span>

Certain spirits, not evil, sinking into a quiescence like sleep, were
taken up into heaven in respect to the interiors of their minds; for
before their interiors are opened spirits can be taken up into heaven
and be taught about the happiness of those there. I saw them in the
quiescent state for about half an hour, and afterwards they relapsed
into their exteriors in which they were before, and also into a
recollection of what they had seen. They said that they had been among
the angels in heaven, and had there seen and perceived amazing things,
all of which were resplendent as if made of gold, silver, and precious
stones, in exquisite forms and in wonderful variety; also that angels
are not delighted with the outward things themselves, but with the
things they represented, which were Divine, ineffable, and of infinite
wisdom, and that these were their joy; with innumerable other things
that could not be described in human language even as to a
ten-thousandth part, or fall into ideas which partake of any thing
material.

<span class="margnote"><span id="412.">412.</span></span>

Scarcely any who enter the other life know what heavenly blessedness and
happiness are, because they do not know what internal joy is, deriving
their perception of it solely from bodily and worldly gladness and joy;
and in consequence what they are ignorant of they suppose to be nothing,
when in fact bodily and worldly joys are of no account in comparison. In
order, therefore, that the well disposed, who do not know what heavenly
joy is, may know and realize what it is, they are taken first to
paradisal scenes that transcend every conception of the imagination.
They then think that they have come into the heavenly paradise; but they
are taught that this is not true heavenly happiness; and they are
permitted to realize such interior states of joy as are perceptible to
their inmost. They are then brought into a state of peace even to their
inmost, when they confess that nothing of it is in the least expressible
or conceivable. Finally they are brought into a state of innocence even
to their inmost sense. Thus they are permitted to learn what true
spiritual and heavenly good is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="413.">413.</span></span>

But that I might learn the nature of heaven and heavenly joy I have
frequently and for a long time been permitted by the Lord to perceive
the delights of heavenly joys; but while I have been enabled to know by
living experience what they are I am not at all able to describe them.
Nevertheless, that some idea of them may be formed, something shall be
said about them. Heavenly joy is an affection of innumerable delights
and joys, which together present something general, and in this general,
that is, this general affection, are harmonies of innumerable affections
that come to perception obscurely, and not distinctly, because the
perception is most general. Nevertheless I was permitted to perceive
that there are innumerable things in it, in such order as cannot be at
all described, those innumerable things being such as flow from the
order of heaven. The order in the particulars of the affection even to
the least, is such that these particulars are presented and perceived
only as a most general whole, in accordance with the capacity of him who
is the subject. In a word, each general affection contains infinite
affections arranged in a most orderly form, with nothing therein that is
not alive, and that does not affect all of them from the inmosts; for
heavenly joys go forth from inmosts. I perceived also that the joy and
ecstasy came as from the heart, diffusing most softly through all the
inmost fibers, and from these into the bundles of fibers, with such an
inmost sense of delight that the fiber seemed to be nothing but joy and
ecstasy, and everything perceptive and sensitive therefrom seemed in
like manner to be alive with happiness. Compared with these joys the joy
of bodily pleasures is like a gross and pungent dust compared with a
pure and most gentle aura. I have noticed that when I wished to transfer
all my delight to another, a more interior and fuller delight
continually flowed in in its place, and the more I wished this, the more
flowed in; and this was perceived to be from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="414.">414.</span></span>

Those that are in heaven are continually advancing towards the spring of
life, with a greater advance towards a more joyful and happy spring the
more thousands of years they live; and this to eternity, with increase
according to the growth and degree of their love, charity, and faith.
Women who have died old and worn out with age, if they have lived in
faith in the Lord, in charity to the neighbor, and in happy marriage
love with a husband, advance with the succession of years more and more
into the flower of youth and early womanhood, and into a beauty that
transcends every conception of any such beauty as is seen on the earth.
Goodness and charity are what give this form and thus manifest their own
likeness, causing the joy and beauty of charity to shine forth from
every least particular of the face, and causing them to be the very
forms of charity. Some who beheld this were struck with amazement. The
form of charity that is seen in a living way in heaven, is such that it
is charity itself that both forms and is formed; and this in such a
manner that the whole angel is a charity, as it were, especially the
face; and this is both clearly seen and felt. When this form is beheld
it is beauty unspeakable, affecting with charity the very inmost life of
the mind. In a word, to grow old in heaven is to grow young. Such forms
or such beauties do those become in the other life who have lived in
love to the Lord and in charity towards the neighbor. All angels are
such forms in endless variety; and of these heaven is constituted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="415.">415.</span></span>

XLIII\. THE IMMENSITY OF HEAVEN. The immensity of the heaven of the Lord
is evident from many things that have been said and shown in the
foregoing chapters, especially from this, that heaven is from the human
race (n. 311-317), both from those born within the church and from those
born out of it (n. 318-328); thus it consists of all from the beginning
of this earth that have lived a good life. How great a multitude of men
there is in this entire world any one who knows anything about the
divisions, the regions, and kingdoms of the earth may conclude. Whoever
goes into a calculation will find that several thousands of men die
every day, that is, some myriads of millions every year; and this from
the earliest times, since which several thousands of years have elapsed.
All of these after death have gone into the other world, which is called
the spiritual world, and they are constantly going into it. But how many
of these have become or are becoming angels of heaven cannot be told.
This I have been told, that in ancient times the number was very great,
because men then thought more interiorly and spiritually, and from such
thought were in heavenly affection; but in the following ages not so
many, because in the process of time man became more external and began
to think more naturally, and from such thought to be in earthly
affection. All of this shows how great heaven is even from the
inhabitants of this earth alone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="416.">416.</span></span>

The immensity of the heaven of the Lord is shown also by this, that all
children, whether born within the church or out of it, are adopted by
the Lord and become angels; and the number of these amounts to a fourth
or fifth part of the whole human race on the earth. That every child,
wherever born, whether within the church or out of it, whether of pious
or impious parents, is received by the Lord when it dies, and is brought
up in heaven, and is taught and imbued with affections for good, and
through these with knowledges of truth, in accordance with Divine order,
and as he becomes perfected in intelligence and wisdom is brought into
heaven and becomes an angel, can be seen above (n. 329-345). From all
this a conclusion may be formed of the multitude of angels of heaven,
derived from this source alone, from the first creation to the present
time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="417.">417.</span></span>

Again, how immense the heaven of the Lord is can be seen from this, that
all the planets visible to the eye in our solar system are earths, and
moreover, that in the whole universe there are innumerable earths, all
of them full of inhabitants. These have been treated of particularly in
a small work on those earths from which I will quote the following
passage: It is fully known in the other life that there are many earths
inhabited by men from which spirits and angels come; for everyone there
who desires from a love of truth and of use to do so is permitted to
talk with spirits of other earths, and thus be assured that there is a
plurality of worlds, and learn that the human race is not from one earth
alone, but from innumerable earths. I have frequently talked about this
with spirits of our earth, and was told that any intelligent person
ought to know from many things that he does know that there are many
earths inhabited by men; for it may be reasonably inferred that immense
bodies like the planets, some of which exceed this earth in magnitude,
are not empty masses created merely to be borne through space and to be
carried around the sun, and to shine with their scanty light for the
benefit of a single earth, but must have a more important use. He that
believes, as everyone must believe, that the Divine created the universe
for no other end than that the human race might exist, and heaven
therefrom, for the human race is a seminary of heaven, must needs
believe that wherever there is an earth there are men. That the planets
visible to us because they are within the limits of our solar system are
earths is evident from their being bodies of earthy matters, which is
known from their reflecting the sun's light, and from their not
appearing, when viewed through telescopes, like stars, sparkling with
flame, but like earths varied with darker portions; also from their
passing like our earth around the sun and following in the path of the
zodiac, thus making years and seasons of the year, spring, summer,
autumn, and winter, also revolving on their axes like our earth, making
days and times of the day, morning, mid-day, evening, and night; also
from some of them having moons, called satellites, that revolve around
their earth at stated times, as the moon does around ours; while the
planet Saturn, being at a greater distance from the sun, has also a
large luminous belt which gives much light, though reflected, to that
earth. Who that knows all this and thinks rationally can ever say that
the planets are empty bodies? Moreover, I have said to spirits that man
might believe that there are more earths in the universe than one, from
the fact that the starry heaven is so immense, and the stars there so
innumerable, and each of them in its place or in its system a sun,
resembling our sun, although of a varying magnitude. Any one who duly
weighs the subject must conclude that such an immense whole must needs
be a means to an end that is the final end of creation; and this end is
a heavenly kingdom in which the Divine may dwell with angels and men.
For the visible universe or the heaven illumined by stars so numberless,
which are so many suns, is simply a means for the existence of earths
with men upon them from whom the heavenly kingdom is derived. From all
this a rational man must needs conclude that so immense a means to so
great an end could not have been provided merely for the human race on a
single earth. What would this be for a Divine that is infinite, to which
thousands and even myriads of earths, all of them full of inhabitants,
would be little and scarcely anything? There are spirits whose sole
pursuit is the acquisition of knowledges, because their delight is in
this alone; and for this reason they are permitted to wander about, and
even to pass out of our solar system into others, in acquiring
knowledge. These spirits, who are from the planet Mercury, have told me
that there are earths with men upon them not only in this solar system
but also beyond it in the starry heaven in immense numbers. It was
calculated that with a million earths in the universe, and on each earth
three hundred millions of men, and two hundred generations in six
thousand years, and a space of three cubic ells allowed to each man or
spirit, the total number of so many men or spirits would not fill the
space of this earth, and scarcely more than the space of one of the
satellites about one of the planets - a space in the universe so small
as to be almost invisible, since a satellite can scarcely be seen by the
naked eye. What is this for the Creator of the universe, to whom it
would not be sufficient if the whole universe were filled, since He is
infinite? I have talked with angels about this, and they said that they
had a similar idea of the fewness of the human race compared with the
infinity of the Creator, although their thought is from states, not from
spaces, and that in their thought earths amounting to as many myriads as
could possibly be conceived of would still be nothing at all to the
Lord. The earths in the universe, with their inhabitants, and the
spirits and angels from them, are treated of in the above mentioned
work. What is there related has been revealed and shown to me to the
intent that it may be known that the heaven of the Lord is immense, and
that it is all from the human race; also that our Lord is every where
acknowledged as the God of heaven and earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="418.">418.</span></span>

Again, the immensity of the heaven of the Lord is shown in this, that
heaven in its entire complex reflects a single Man, and corresponds to
all things and each thing in man, and that this correspondence can never
be filled out, since it is a correspondence not only with each of the
members, organs, and viscera of the body in general, but also with all
and each of the little viscera and little organs contained in these in
every minutest particular, and even with each vessel and fiber; and not
only with these but also with the organic substances that receive
interiorly the influx of heaven, from which come man's interior
activities that are serviceable to the operations of his mind; since
everything that exists interiorly in man exists in forms which are
substances, for anything that does not exist in a substance as its
subject is nothing. There is a correspondence of all these things with
heaven, as can be seen from the chapter treating of the correspondence
of all things of heaven with all things of man (n. 87-102). This
correspondence can never be filled out because the more numerous the
angelic affiliations are that correspond to each member the more perfect
heaven becomes; for every perfection in the heavens increases with
increase of number; and this for the reason that all there have the same
end, and look with one accord to that end. That end is the common good;
and when that reigns there is, from the common good, good to each
individual, and from the good of each individual there is good to the
whole community. This is so for the reason that the Lord turns all in
heaven to Himself (see above, n. 123), and thereby makes them to be one
in Himself. That the unanimity and concord of many, especially from such
an origin and held together by such a bond, produces perfection,
everyone with a reason at all enlightened can see clearly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="419.">419.</span></span>

I have also been permitted to see the extent of the inhabited and also
of the uninhabited heaven; and the extent of the uninhabited heaven was
seen to be so great that it could not be filled to eternity even if
there were many myriads of earths, and as great a multitude of men on
each earth as on ours. (On this also see the treatise on The Earths in
the Universe, n. 168.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="420.">420.</span></span>

That heaven is not immense, but it is of limited extent, is a conclusion
that some have derived from certain passages in the Word understood
according to the sense of its letter; for example, where it is said that
only the poor are received into heaven, or only the elect, or only those
within the church, and not those outside of it, or only those for whom
the Lord intercedes; that heaven is closed when it is filled, and that
this time is predetermined. But such are unaware that heaven is never
closed, and that there is no time predetermined, or any limit of number;
and that those are called the "elect" who are in a life of good and
truth; <span id="fr_252"></span>[420-1](#fn_252.md) and those are called
"poor" who are lacking in knowledges of good and truth and yet desire
them; and such from that desire are also called hungry. <span
id="fr_253"></span>[420-2](#fn_253.md) Those that have conceived an idea of
the small extent of heaven from the Word not understood believe it to be
in one place, where all are gathered together; when, in fact, heaven
consists of innumerable societies (see above, n. 41-50). Such also have
no other idea than that heaven is granted to everyone from mercy apart
from means, and thus that there is admission and reception from mere
favor; and they fail to understand that the Lord from mercy leads
everyone who accepts Him, and that he accepts Him who lives in
accordance with the laws of divine order, which are the precepts of love
and of faith, and that the mercy that is meant is to be thus led by the
Lord from infancy to the last period of life in the world and afterwards
to eternity. Let them know, therefore, that every man is born for
heaven, and that he is received that receives heaven in himself in the
world, and he that does not receive it is shut out.

<span class="margnote"><span id="421.">421.</span></span>

WHAT THE WORLD OF SPIRITS IS. The world of spirits is not heaven, nor is
it hell, but it is the intermediate place or state between the two; for
it is the place that man first enters after death; and from which after
a suitable time he is either raised up into heaven or cast down into
hell in accord with his life in the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="422.">422.</span></span>

The world of spirits is an intermediate place between heaven and hell
and also an intermediate state of the man after death. It has been shown
to me not only that it is an intermediate place, having the hells below
it and the heavens above it, but also that it is in an intermediate
state, since so long as man is in it he is not yet either in heaven or
in hell. The state of heaven in man is the conjunction of good and truth
in him; and the state of hell is the conjunction of evil and falsity in
him. Whenever good in a man-spirit is conjoined to truth he comes into
heaven, because that conjunction, as just said, is heaven in him; but
whenever evil in a man-spirit is conjoined with falsity he comes into
hell, because that conjunction is hell in him. That conjunction is
effected in the world of spirits, man then being in an intermediate
state. It is the same thing whether you say the conjunction of the
understanding and the will, or the conjunction of good and truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="423.">423.</span></span>

Let something first be said about the conjunction of the understanding
and the will, and its being the same thing as the conjunction of good
and truth, that being the conjunction that is effected in the world of
spirits. Man has an understanding and a will. The understanding receives
truths and is formed out of them, and the will receives goods and is
formed out of them; therefore whatever a man understands and thinks from
his understanding he calls true, and whatever a man wills and thinks
from his will he calls good. From his understanding man can think and
thus perceive both what is true and what is good; and yet he thinks what
is true and good from the will only when he wills it and does it. When
he wills it and from willing does it, it is both in his understanding
and in his will, consequently in the man. For neither the understanding
alone nor the will alone makes the man, but the understanding and will
together; therefore whatever is in both is in the man, and is
appropriated to him. That which is in the understanding alone is in man,
and yet not really in him; it is only a thing of his memory, or a matter
of knowledge in his memory about which he can think when in company with
others and outside of himself, but not in himself; that is, about which
he can speak and reason, and can simulate affections and gestures that
are in accord with it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="424.">424.</span></span>

This ability to think from the understanding and not at the same time
from the will is provided that man may be capable of being reformed; for
reformation is effected by means of truths, and truths pertain to the
understanding, as just said. For in respect to his will man is born into
every evil, and therefore of himself wills good to no one but himself;
and one who wills good to himself alone delights in the misfortunes that
befall another, especially when they tend to his own advantage; for his
wish is to divert to himself the goods of all others, whether honors or
riches, and so far as he succeeds in this he inwardly rejoices. To the
end that this will of man may be corrected and reformed, an ability to
understand truths, and an ability to subdue by means of truths the
affections of evil that spring from the will, are given to man. This is
why man has this ability to think truths with his understanding, and to
speak them and do them. But until man is such that he wills truths and
does them from himself, that is, from the heart, he is not able to think
truths from his will. When he becomes such, whatever he thinks from his
understanding belongs to his faith, and whatever he thinks from his will
belongs to his love; and in consequence his faith and his love, like his
understanding and his will, are conjoined in him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="425.">425.</span></span>

To the extent, therefore, that the truths of the understanding and the
goods of the will are conjoined, that is, to the extent that a man wills
truths and does them from his will, he has heaven in himself, since the
conjunction of good and truth, as just said, is heaven. And on the other
hand, just to the extent that the falsities of the understanding and the
evils of the will are conjoined man has hell in himself, since the
conjunction of falsity and evil is hell. But so long as the truths of
the understanding and the goods of the will are not conjoined man is in
an intermediate state. At the present time nearly everyone is in such a
state that he has some knowledge of truths, and from his knowledge and
understanding gives some thought to them, and conforms to them either
much or little or not at all, or acts contrary to them from a love of
evil and consequent false belief. In order, therefore, that man may have
in him either heaven or hell, he is first brought after death into the
world of spirits, and there with those who are to be raised up into
heaven good and truth are conjoined, and with those who are to be cast
down into hell evil and falsity are conjoined. For neither in heaven nor
in hell is any one permitted to have a divided mind, that is, to
understand one thing and to will another; but everyone must understand
what he wills, and will what he understands. Therefore in heaven he who
wills good understands truth, while in hell he who wills evil
understands falsity. So in the intermediate state the falsities that the
good have are put away, and truths that agree and harmonize with their
good are given them; while the truths that the evil have are put away,
and falsities that agree and harmonize with their evil are given them.
This shows what the world of spirits is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="426.">426.</span></span>

In the world of spirits there are vast numbers, because the first
meeting of all is there, and all are there explored and prepared. The
time of their stay in that world is not fixed; some merely enter it, and
are soon either taken into heaven or are cast down into hell; some
remain only a few weeks, some several years, but not more than thirty.
These differences in the time they remain depend on the correspondence
or lack of correspondence of man's interiors with his exteriors. How man
is led in that world from one state into another and prepared shall now
be told.

<span class="margnote"><span id="427.">427.</span></span>

As soon as men after death enter the world of spirits the Lord clearly
discriminates between them; and the evil are at once attached to the
infernal society in which they were, as to their ruling love while in
the world; and the good are at once attached to the heavenly society in
which they were as to their love, charity and faith while in the world.
But although they are thus divided, all that have been friends and
acquaintances in the life of the body, especially wives and husbands,
and also brothers and sisters, meet and converse together whenever they
so desire. I have seen a father talking with six sons, whom he
recognized, and have seen many others with their relatives and friends;
but having from their life in the world diverse dispositions, after a
short time they separate. But those who have passed from the world of
spirits into heaven or into hell, unless they have a like disposition
from a like love, no longer see or know each other. The reason that they
see each other in the world of spirits, but not in heaven or in hell, is
that those who are in the world of spirits are brought into one state
after another, like those they experienced in the life of the body; but
afterwards all are brought into a permanent state in accord with their
ruling love, and in that state one recognizes another only by similarity
of love; for then similarity joins and dissimilarity disjoins (see
above, n. 41-50).

<span class="margnote"><span id="428.">428.</span></span>

As the world of spirits is an intermediate state between heaven and hell
with man, so it is an intermediate place with the hells below and the
heavens above. All the hells are shut towards that world, being open
only through holes and clefts like those in rocks and through wide
openings that are so guarded that no one can come out except by
permission, which is granted in cases of urgent necessity (of which
hereafter). Heaven, too, is enclosed on all sides; and there is no
passage open to any heavenly society except by a narrow way, the
entrance to which is also guarded. These outlets and entrances are what
are called in the Word the gates and doors of hell and of heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="429.">429.</span></span>

The world of spirits appears like a valley between mountains and rocks,
with windings and elevations here and there. The gates and doors of the
heavenly societies are visible to those only who are prepared for
heaven; others cannot find them. There is one entrance from the world of
spirits to each heavenly society, opening through a single path which
branches out in its ascent into several. The gates and doors of the
hells also are visible only to those who are about to enter, to whom
they are then opened. When these are opened gloomy and seemingly sooty
caverns are seen tending obliquely downwards to the abyss, where again
there are many doors. Through these caverns nauseous and fetid stenches
exhale, which good spirits flee from because they abominate them, but
evil spirits seek for them because they delight in them. For as everyone
in the world has been delighted with his own evil, so after death he is
delighted with the stench to which his evil corresponds. In this respect
the evil may be likened to rapacious birds and beasts, like ravens,
wolves, and swine, which fly or run to carrion or dunghills when they
scent their stench. I heard a certain spirit crying out loudly as if
from inward torture when struck by a breath flowing forth from heaven;
but he became tranquil and glad as soon as a breath flowing forth from
hell reached him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="430.">430.</span></span>

With every man there are two gates; one that leads to hell and that is
open to evils and their falsities; while the other leads to heaven and
is open to goods and their truths. Those that are in evil and its
falsity have the gate to hell opened in them, and only through chinks
from above does something of light from heaven flow into them, and by
that inflowing they are able to think, to reason, and to speak; but the
gate to heaven is opened in those that are in good and its truth. For
there are two ways that lead to the rational mind of man; a higher or
internal way through which good and truth from the Lord enter, and a
lower or external way through which evil and falsity enter from hell.
The rational mind itself is at the middle point to which the ways tend.
Consequently, so far as light from heaven is admitted man is rational;
but so far as it is not admitted he is not rational, however rational he
may seem to himself to be. This has been said to make known the nature
of the correspondence of man with heaven and with hell. While man's
rational mind is being formed it corresponds to the world of spirits,
what is above it corresponding to heaven and what is below to hell. With
those preparing for heaven the regions above the rational mind are
opened, but those below are closed to the influx of evil and falsity;
while with those preparing for hell the parts below it are opened, and
the parts above it are closed to the influx of good and truth. Thus the
latter can look only to what is below themselves, that is, to hell;
while the former can look only to what is above themselves, that is, to
heaven. To look above themselves is to look to the Lord, because He is
the common center to which all things of heaven look; while to look
below themselves is to look backwards from the Lord to the opposite
center, to which all things of hell look and tend (see above, n. 123,
124).

<span class="margnote"><span id="431.">431.</span></span>

In the preceding pages whenever spirits are mentioned those that are in
the world of spirits are meant; but when angels are mentioned those that
are in heaven are meant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="432.">432.</span></span>

XLV\. IN RESPECT TO HIS INTERIORS EVERY MAN IS A SPIRIT. Whoever duly
considers the subject can see that as the body is material it is not the
body that thinks, but the soul, which is spiritual. The soul of man,
upon the immortality of which many have written, is his spirit, for this
as to everything belonging to it is immortal. This also is what thinks
in the body, for it is spiritual, and what is spiritual receives what is
spiritual and lives spiritually, which is to think and to will.
Therefore, all rational life that appears in the body belongs to the
soul, and nothing of it to the body; for the body, as just said, is
material, and the material, which is the property of the body, is added
to and apparently almost joined to the spirit, in order that the spirit
of man may be able to live and perform uses in the natural world, all
things of which are material and in themselves devoid of life. And as it
is the spiritual only that lives and not the material, it can be seen
that whatever lives in man is his spirit, and that the body merely
serves it, just as what is instrumental serves a moving living force. An
instrument is said indeed to act, to move, or to strike; but to believe
that these are acts of the instrument, and not of him who acts, moves,
or strikes by means of the instrument, is a fallacy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="433.">433.</span></span>

As everything in the body that lives, and that acts and feels from that
life, belongs exclusively to the spirit, and nothing of it to the body,
it follows that the spirit is the man himself; or what is the same
thing, that a man viewed in himself is a spirit possessing a like form;
for whatever lives and feels in man belongs to his spirit and everything
in man, from his head to the sole of his foot, lives and feels; and in
consequence when the body is separated from its spirit, which is what is
called dying, man continues to be a man and to live. I have heard from
heaven that some who die, while they are lying upon the bier, before
they are resuscitated, continue to think even in their cold body, and do
not know that they are not still alive, except that they are unable to
move a particle of matter belonging to the body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="434.">434.</span></span>

Unless man were a subject which is a substance that can serve a source
and containant he would be unable to think and will. Any thing that is
supposed to exist apart from a substantial subject is nothing. This can
be seen from the fact that a man is unable to see without an organ which
is the subject of his sight, or to hear without an organ which is the
subject of his hearing. Apart from these organs, sight and hearing are
nothing and have no existence. The same is true of thought, which is
inner sight, and of perception, which is inner hearing; unless these
were in substances and from substances which are organic forms and
subjects, they would have no existence at all. All this shows that man's
spirit as well as his body is in a form, and that it is in a human form,
and enjoys sensories and senses when separated from the body the same as
when it was in it, and that all the life of the eye and all the life of
the ear, in a word, all the life of sense that man has, belongs not to
his body but to his spirit, which dwells in these organs and in their
minutest particulars. This is why spirits see, hear, and feel, as well
as men. But when the spirit has been loosed from the body, these senses
are exercised in the spiritual world, not in the natural world. The
natural sensation that the spirit had when it was in the body it had by
means of the material part that was added to it; but it then had also
spiritual sensations in its thinking and willing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="435.">435.</span></span>

All this has been said to convince the rational man that viewed in
himself man is a spirit, and that the corporeal part that is added to
the spirit to enable it to perform its functions in the natural and
material world is not the man, but only an instrument of his spirit. But
evidences from experience are preferable, because there are many that
fail to comprehend rational deductions; and those that have established
themselves in the opposite view turn such deductions into grounds of
doubt by means of reasonings from the fallacies of the senses. Those
that have established themselves in the opposite view are accustomed to
think that beasts likewise have life and sensations and thus have a
spiritual part, the same as man has, and yet that part dies with the
body. But the spiritual of beasts is not the same as the spiritual of
man is; for man has what beasts have not, an inmost, into which the
Divine flows, raising man up to Itself, and thereby conjoining man to
Itself. Because of this, man, in contrast with beasts, has the ability
to think about God and about the Divine things of heaven and the church,
and to love God from these and in these, and thus be conjoined to Him;
and whatever can be conjoined to the Divine cannot be dissipated, but
whatever cannot be conjoined is dissipated. The inmost that man has, in
contrast with beasts, has been treated of above (n. 39), and what was
there said will here be repeated, since it is important to have the
fallacies dispelled that have been engendered in the minds of many who
from lack of knowledge and trained intellect are unable to form rational
conclusions on the subject. The words are these: I will mention a
certain arcanum respecting the angels of the three heavens, which has
not hitherto come into any one's mind, because degrees have not been
understood. In every angel and in every man there is an inmost or
highest degree, or an inmost or highest something, into which the Divine
of the Lord first or most directly flows, and from which it disposes the
other interiors in him that succeed in accordance with the degrees of
order. This inmost or highest degree may be called the entrance of the
Lord to the angel or man, and His veriest dwelling-place in them. It is
by virtue of this inmost or highest that a man is a man, and
distinguished from the animals, which do not have it. From this it is
that man, unlike the animals, is capable, in respect to all his
interiors which pertain to his mind and disposition, of being raised up
by the Lord to Himself, of believing in the Lord, of being moved by love
to the Lord, and thereby beholding Him, and of receiving intelligence
and wisdom, and speaking from reason. Also it is by virtue of this that
he lives to eternity. But what is arranged and provided by the Lord in
this inmost does not distinctly fall into the perception of any angel,
because it is above his thought and transcends his wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="436.">436.</span></span>

That in respect to his interiors man is a spirit I have been permitted
to learn from much experience, which, to employ a common saying, would
fill volumes if I were to describe it all. I have talked with spirits as
a spirit, and I have talked with them as a man in the body; and when I
talked with them as a spirit they knew no otherwise than that I myself
was a spirit and in a human form as they were. Thus did my interiors
appear before them, for when talking with them as a spirit my material
body was not seen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="437.">437.</span></span>

That in respect to his interiors man is a spirit can be seen from the
fact that after his separation from the body, which takes place when he
dies, man goes on living as a man just as before. That I might be
convinced of this I have been permitted to talk with nearly everyone I
had ever known in their life in the body; with some for hours, with some
for weeks and months, and with some for years, and this chiefly that I
might be sure of it and might testify to it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="438.">438.</span></span>

To this may be added that every man in respect to his spirit, even while
he is living in the body, is in some society with spirits, although he
does not know it; if a good man he is by means of spirits in some
angelic society; if an evil man in some infernal society; and after
death he comes into that same society. This has been often told and
shown to those who after death have come among spirits. Man, to be sure,
does not appear in that society as a spirit while he is living in the
world, for the reason that he then thinks naturally; but when one is
thinking abstractly from the body, because he is then in the spirit, he
sometimes appears in his society; and when seen he is easily
distinguished from the spirits there, for he goes about meditating and
in silence, not looking at others, and apparently not seeing them; and
as soon as any spirit speaks to him he vanishes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="439.">439.</span></span>

To make clear that man in respect to his interiors is a spirit I will
relate from experience what happens when man is withdrawn from the body,
and what it is to be carried away by the spirit to another place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="440.">440.</span></span>

First, as to withdrawal from the body, it happens thus. Man is brought
into a certain state that is midway between sleeping and waking, and
when in that state he seems to himself to be wide awake; all the senses
are as perfectly awake as in the completest bodily wakefulness, not only
the sight and the hearing, but what is wonderful, the sense of touch
also, which is then more exquisite than is ever possible when the body
is awake. In this state spirits and angels have been seen to the very
life, and have been heard, and what is wonderful, have been touched,
with almost nothing of the body intervening. This is the state that is
called being withdrawn from the body, and not knowing whether one is in
the body or out of it. I have been admitted into this state only three
or four times, that I might learn what it is, and might know that
spirits and angels enjoy every sense, and that man does also in respect
to his spirit when he is withdrawn from the body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="441.">441.</span></span>

As to being carried away by the spirit to another place, I have been
shown by living experience what it is, and how it is done, but only two
or three times. I will relate a single instance. Walking through the
streets of a city and through fields, talking at the same time with
spirits, I knew no otherwise than that I was fully awake, and in
possession of my usual sight. Thus I walked on without going astray, and
all the while with clear vision, seeing groves, rivers, palaces, houses,
men, and other objects. But after walking thus for some hours, suddenly
I saw with my bodily eyes, and noted that I was in another place. Being
greatly astonished I perceived that I had been in the same state as
those who were said to have been led away by the spirit into another
place. For in this state the distance, even though it be many miles, and
the time, though it be many hours or days, are not thought of; neither
is there any feeling of fatigue; and one is led unerringly through ways
of which he himself is ignorant, even to the destined place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="442.">442.</span></span>

But these two states of man, which are his states when he is in his
interiors, or what is the same, when he is in the spirit, are
extraordinary; but as they are states known about in the church, they
were exhibited to me only that I might know what they are. But it has
been granted to me now for many years to speak with spirits and to be
with them as one of them, even in full wakefulness of the body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="443.">443.</span></span>

That in respect to his interiors man is a spirit there are further
evidences in what has been said and shown above (n. 311-317), where it
is explained that heaven and hell are from the human race.

<span class="margnote"><span id="444.">444.</span></span>

That man is a spirit in respect to his interiors means in respect to the
things pertaining to his thought and will, for these are the interiors
themselves that make man to be man, and such a man as he is in respect
to these interiors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="445.">445.</span></span>

XLVI\. THE RESUSCITATION OF MAN FROM THE DEAD AND HIS ENTRANCE INTO
ETERNAL LIFE. When the body is no longer able to perform the bodily
functions in the natural world that correspond to the spirit's thoughts
and affections, which the spirit has from the spiritual world, man is
said to die. This takes place when the respiration of the lungs and the
beatings of the heart cease. But the man does not die; he is merely
separated from the bodily part that was of use to him in the world,
while the man himself continues to live. It is said that the man himself
continues to live since man is not a man because of his body but because
of his spirit, for it is the spirit that thinks in man, and thought with
affection is what constitutes man. Evidently, then, the death of man is
merely his passing from one world into another. And this is why in the
Word in its internal sense "death" signifies resurrection and
continuation of life. <span id="fr_254"></span>[445-1](#fn_254.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="446.">446.</span></span>

There is an inmost communication of the spirit with the breathing and
with the beating of the heart, the spirit's thought communicating with
the breathing, and its affection, which is of love, with the
heart; <span id="fr_255"></span>[446-1](#fn_255.md) consequently when these
two motions cease in the body there is at once a separation. These two
motions, the respiration of the lungs and the beating of heart, are the
very bond on the sundering of which the spirit is left to itself; and
the body being then deprived of the life of its spirit grows cold and
begins to decay. This inmost communication of the spirit of man is with
the respiration and with the heart, because on these all vital motions
depend, not only in general but in every particular. <span
id="fr_256"></span>[446-2](#fn_256.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="447.">447.</span></span>

After the separation the spirit of man continues in the body for a short
time, but only until the heart's action has wholly ceased, which happens
variously in accord with the diseased condition that causes death, with
some the motion of the heart continuing for some time, with others not
so long. As soon as this motion ceases the man is resuscitated; but this
is done by the Lord alone. Resuscitation means the drawing forth of the
spirit from the body, and its introduction into the spiritual world;
this is commonly called the resurrection. The spirit is not separated
from the body until the motion of the heart has ceased, for the reason
that the heart corresponds to the affection of love, which is the very
life of man, for it is from love that everyone has vital heat; <span
id="fr_257"></span>[447-1](#fn_257.md) consequently as long as this
conjunction continues correspondence continues, and thereby the life of
the spirit in the body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="448.">448.</span></span>

How this resuscitation is effected has both been told to me and shown to
me in living experience. The actual experience was granted to me that I
might have a complete knowledge of the process.

<span class="margnote"><span id="449.">449.</span></span>

As to the senses of the body I was brought into a state of
insensibility, thus nearly into the state of the dying; but with the
interior life and thought remaining unimpaired, in order that I might
perceive and retain in the memory the things that happened to me, and
that happen to those that are resuscitated from the dead. I perceived
that the respiration of the body was almost wholly taken away; but the
interior respiration of the spirit went on in connection with a slight
and tacit respiration of the body. Then at first a communication of the
pulse of the heart with the celestial kingdom was established, because
that kingdom corresponds to the heart in man. <span
id="fr_258"></span>[449-1](#fn_258.md) Angels from that kingdom were seen,
some at a distance, and two sitting near my head. Thus all my own
affection was taken away although thought and perception continued.
\[2\] I was in this state for some hours. Then the spirits that were
around me withdrew, thinking that I was dead; and an aromatic odor like
that of an embalmed body was perceived, for when the celestial angels
are present everything pertaining to the corpse is perceived as
aromatic, and when spirits perceive this they cannot approach; and in
this way evil spirits are kept away from man's spirit when he is being
introduced into eternal life. The angels seated at my head were silent,
merely sharing their thoughts with mine; and when their thoughts are
received the angels know that the spirit of man is in a state in which
it can be drawn forth from the body. This sharing of their thoughts was
effected by looking into my face, for in this way in heaven thoughts are
shared. \[3\] As my thought and perception continued, that I might know
and remember how resuscitation is effected, I perceived the angels first
tried to ascertain what my thought was, whether it was like the thought
of those who are dying, which is usually about eternal life; also that
they wished to keep my mind in that thought. Afterwards I was told that
the spirit of man is held in its last thought when the body expires,
until it returns to the thoughts that are from its general or ruling
affection in the world. Especially was I permitted to see and feel that
there was a pulling and drawing forth, as it were, of the interiors of
my mind, thus of my spirit, from the body; and I was told that this is
from the Lord, and that the resurrection is thus effected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="450.">450.</span></span>

The celestial angels who are with the one that is resuscitated do not
withdraw from him, because they love everyone; but when the spirit comes
into such a state that he can no longer be affiliated with celestial
angels, he longs to get away from them. When this takes place angels
from the Lord's spiritual kingdom come, through whom is given the use of
light; for before this he saw nothing, but merely thought. I was shown
how this is done. The angels appeared to roll off, as it were, a coat
from the left eye towards the bridge of the nose, that the eye might be
opened and be enabled to see. This is only an appearance, but to the
spirit it seemed to be really done. When the coat thus seems to have
been rolled off there is a slight sense of light, but very dim, like
what is seen through the eyelids on first awakening from sleep. To me
this dim light took on a heavenly hue, but I was told afterwards that
the color varies. Then something is felt to be gently rolled off from
the face, and when this is done spiritual thought is awakened. This
rolling off from the face is also an appearance, which represents the
spirit's passing from natural thought into spiritual thought. The angels
are extremely careful that only such ideas as savor of love shall
proceed from the one resuscitated. They now tell him that he is a
spirit. When he has come into the enjoyment of light the spiritual
angels render to the new spirit every service he can possibly desire in
that state; and teach him about the things of the other life so far as
he can comprehend them. But if he has no wish to be taught the spirit
longs to get away from the company of the angels. Nevertheless, the
angels do not withdraw from him, but he separates himself from them; for
the angels love everyone, and desire nothing so much as to render
service, to teach, and to lead into heaven; this constitutes their
highest delight. When the spirit has thus withdrawn he is received by
good spirits, and as long as he continues in their company everything
possible is done for him. But if he had lived such a life in the world
as would prevent his enjoying the company of the good he longs to get
away from the good, and this experience is repeated until he comes into
association with such as are in entire harmony with his life in the
world; and with such he finds his own life, and what is surprising, he
then leads a life like that which he led in the world.

various things, and receives thereby its form and quality and perfection
in accordance with the quality of the harmony and concurrence (n. 457,
3241, 8003). There is an infinite variety and never any one thing the
same as another (n. 7236, 9002). It is the same in the heavens (n. 3744,
4005, 7236, 7833, 7836, 9002). In consequence all the societies in the
heavens and all the angels in a society are distinct from each other
because they are in different goods and uses (n. 690, 3241, 3519, 3804,
3986, 4067, 4149, 4263, 7236, 7833). The Lord's Divine love arranges all
into a heavenly form, and so conjoins them that they are as a single man
(n. 457, 3986, 5598).

<span id="fn_252"></span>[420-1](hh09.htm#fr_252.md) Those are the elect
who are in a life of good and truth (n. 3755, 3900). Election and
reception into heaven are not from mercy, as that term is understood,
but are in accordance with the life (n. 5057, 5058). There is no mercy
of the Lord apart from means, but only through means, that is, to those
that live in accordance with His precepts; such the Lord from His mercy
leads continually in the world, and afterwards to eternity (n. 8700,
10659).

<span id="fn_253"></span>[420-2](hh09.htm#fr_253.md) By the "poor," in the
Word, those are meant who are spiritually poor, that is, who are
ignorant of truth and yet wish to he taught (n. 9209, 9253, 10227). Such
are said to hunger and thirst, which is to desire knowledges of good and
of truth, by which there is introduction into the church and into heaven
(n. 4958, 10227).

<span id="fn_254"></span>[445-1](hh09.htm#fr_254.md) In the Word "death"
signifies resurrection, for when man dies his life still goes on (n.
3498, 3505, 4618, 4621, 6036, 6221).

<span id="fn_255"></span>[446-1](hh09.htm#fr_255.md) The heart corresponds
to the will, thus to the affection which belongs to the love, while the
respiration of the lungs corresponds to the understanding, thus to the
thought (n. 3888). From this the "heart" in the Word signifies the will
and love (n. 7542, 9050, 10336). The "soul" signifies understanding,
faith, and truth; therefore "from the soul and from the heart" signifies
what is from the understanding, faith, and truth, and what is from the
will, love, and good (n. 2930, 9050). The correspondence of the heart
and lungs with the Greatest Man, or heaven (n. 3883-3895).

<span id="fn_256"></span>[446-2](hh09.htm#fr_256.md) The beating of the
heart and the respiration of the lungs reign in the body throughout, and
flow mutually into every part (n. 3887, 3889, 3890).

<span id="fn_257"></span>[447-1](hh09.htm#fr_257.md) Love is the being
\[esse\] of the life of man (n. 5002). Love is spiritual heat, and
therefore the very vital itself of man (n. 1589, 2146, 3338, 4906,
7081-7086, 9954, 10740). Affection is a continuation of love (n. 3938).

<span id="fn_258"></span>[449-1](hh09.htm#fr_258.md) The heart corresponds
to the Lord's celestial kingdom, the lungs to His spiritual kingdom (n.
3635, 3886, 3887).
