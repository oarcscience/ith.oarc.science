### Heaven and Hell

<span class="margnote"><span id="201.">201.</span></span>

It is important to know what the form of heaven is, because not only is
all affiliation there in accordance with it, but also all mutual
communication, and in consequence of this all extension of thoughts and
affections, and thus all the intelligence and wisdom of angels. From
this it follows that each one there is wise just to the extent that he
is in the form of heaven, and is thus a form of heaven. It makes no
difference whether you say in the form of heaven, or in the order of
heaven, since the form of any thing is from its order and in accordance
with its order. <span id="fr_146"></span>[201-1](#fn_146.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="202.">202.</span></span>

Let us consider first what is meant by being in the form of heaven. Man
was created both in the image of heaven and in the image of the world;
his internal in the image of heaven, and his external in the image of
the world (see above, n. 57); and in the image means the same thing as
in accordance with the form. But as man by the evils of his will and
consequent falsities of thought has destroyed in himself the image of
heaven, that is, the form of heaven, and in place of it has brought in
the image and form of hell, his internal is closed up from his very
birth; and this is why man is born into pure ignorance, while animals of
every kind are not. And that man may have the image of heaven or form of
heaven restored to him he must be taught the things that pertain to
order; since form, as has been said, is in accord with order. The Word
contains all the laws of Divine order, for its precepts are the laws of
Divine order; therefore to the extent that man knows these and lives in
accordance with them his internal is opened and the order or image of
heaven is there formed anew. This makes clear what is meant by being in
the form of heaven, namely, that it is to live in accordance with those
things that are in the Word. <span id="fr_147"></span>[202-1](#fn_147.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="203.">203.</span></span>

So far as any one is in the form of heaven he is in heaven, and is, in
fact, a heaven in the least form (n. 57); consequently he is to the same
extent in intelligence and wisdom; for as has been said above, all the
thought of his understanding and all the affection of his will extend
themselves on every side into heaven in accord with its form, and
wonderfully communicate with the societies there, and these in turn with
him. <span id="fr_148"></span>[203-1](#fn_148.md) \[2\] There are some who
do not believe that thoughts and affections really extend themselves
around about them, but believe that they are within them, because
whatever they think they see within in themselves, and not as distant;
but such are greatly mistaken. For as the sight of the eye has extension
to remote objects, and is affected in accordance with the order of the
things seen in that extension, so the interior sight, which is that of
the understanding, has a like extension in the spiritual world, although
not perceived by man, for the reason given above (n. 196). The only
difference is that the sight of the eye is affected in a natural way,
because it is affected by the things in the natural world, while the
sight of the understanding is affected in a spiritual way, because by
the things in the spiritual world, all of which have relation to good
and truth; and man's ignorance of this is because of his not knowing
that there is any light that enlightens the understanding; and yet
without the light that enlightens the understanding man could not think
at all (of which light see above, n. 126-132). \[3\] There was a certain
spirit who believed that his thought was from himself, thus without any
extension outside of himself and communication thereby with societies
outside of him. That he might learn that this was not true his
communication with neighboring societies was cut off, and in
consequence, not only was he deprived of thought but he fell down as if
lifeless, although tossing his arms about like a new-born infant. After
a while the communication was restored to him, and then as it was
gradually restored he returned into the state of his thought. \[4\] When
other spirits had seen this they confessed that all thought and
affection, and in consequence, everything of life, flow in in accordance
with communication, since everything of man's life consists in his
ability to think and be moved by affection, or what is the same, in his
ability to understand and will. <span
id="fr_149"></span>[203-2](#fn_149.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="204.">204.</span></span>

But let it be understood that intelligence and wisdom vary with everyone
in accordance with this communication, those whose intelligence and
wisdom are formed out of genuine truths and goods having communication
with societies in accordance with the form of heaven; while those whose
intelligence and wisdom are not formed out of genuine truths and goods,
and yet out of what is in accord therewith, have a broken and variously
coherent communication, since it is not with societies that are in a
series in which there is a form of heaven. On the other hand, those that
are not in intelligence and wisdom, because they are in falsities from
evil, have communication with societies in hell; and their extension is
determined by the degree of their confirmation. Let it also be known
that this communication with societies is not such a communication with
them as is clearly perceptible to those there, but is a communication
with what they really are, which is in them and flows from them. <span
id="fr_150"></span>[204-1](#fn_150.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="205.">205.</span></span>

There is an affiliation of all in heaven in accordance with spiritual
relationships, that is, relationships of good and truth in their order.
It is so in the whole heaven; so in each society, and so in each house.
Because of this angels who are in like good and truth recognize each
other, as relatives by blood and marriage do on the earth, precisely as
if they had been acquainted from infancy. The good and truth in each
angel, which constitute his wisdom and intelligence, are affiliated in
like manner; they recognize each other in like manner, and as they
recognize each other they join themselves together; <span
id="fr_151"></span>[205-1](#fn_151.md) and in consequence those in whom
truths and goods are thus joined in accordance with a form of heaven see
things following one another in series, and how they cohere widely round
about; but those in whom goods and truths are not conjoined in
accordance with the form of heaven do not see this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="206.">206.</span></span>

In each heaven there is such a form, and in accordance with it the
angels have communication and extension of thoughts and affections, and
thus in accordance with it they have intelligence and wisdom. But the
communication of one heaven with another is different, that is, of the
third or inmost with the second or middle, and of this with the first or
outmost. But the communication between the heavens should not be called
communication but influx. About this something shall now be said. That
there are three heavens distinct from each other can be seen above in
its own chapter (n. 29-40).

<span class="margnote"><span id="207.">207.</span></span>

That between one heaven and another there is influx but not
communication can be seen from their relative position. The third or
inmost heaven is above, the second or middle heaven is below, and the
first or outmost heaven is still lower. There is a like arrangement in
all the societies in each heaven, for example, some dwell on elevated
places that appear like mountains (n. 188); on the top of which those of
the inmost heaven dwell; below these are the societies of the second
heaven, below these again the societies of the outmost heaven. The same
is true every where, both in elevated places and in those not elevated.
A society of a higher heaven has no communication with a society of a
lower except by correspondences (see above, n. 100); and communication
by correspondences is what is called influx.

<span class="margnote"><span id="208.">208.</span></span>

One heaven is joined with another, or a society of one heaven with the
society of another, by the Lord alone, both by direct and by mediate
influx, directly from Himself, and mediately through the higher heavens
in order into the lower. <span id="fr_152"></span>[208-1](#fn_152.md) As
the conjunction of the heavens by this inflowing is from the Lord alone
there is a most careful precaution against any angel of a higher heaven
looking down into a society of a lower heaven and talking with any one
there; for the angel is thus immediately deprived of his intelligence
and wisdom. The reason of this also shall be told. As there are three
degrees of heaven, so each angel has three degrees of life, those in the
inmost heaven having the third or inmost degree open, while the second
and first degrees are closed; those in the middle heaven have the second
degree opened and the first and third closed; and those in the lowest
heaven have the first degree opened and the second and third closed.
Consequently, as soon as an angel of the third heaven looks down into a
society of the second heaven and talks with any one there his third
degree is at once closed; and as his wisdom resides in that degree, if
that is closed he is deprived of his wisdom, for he has none in the
second or first degree. This is what is meant by the words of the Lord
in Matthew: He that is on the housetop, let him not go down to take what
is in his house; and he that is in the field, let him not turn back to
take his garment (24:17, 18). And in Luke: In that day he that shall be
on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take
them away; and he that is in the field let him not turn back. Remember
Lot's wife (17:31, 32).

<span class="margnote"><span id="209.">209.</span></span>

No influx is possible from the lower heavens into the higher, because
this is contrary to order; but there is influx from the higher heavens
into the lower. Moreover, the wisdom of the angels of a higher heaven
surpasses the wisdom of the angels of a lower heaven as a myriad to one;
and this is another reason why the angels of a lower heaven cannot
converse with those of a higher heaven; and in fact when they look
towards them they do not see them, the higher heaven appearing like a
cloudy something over their heads. But the angels of a higher heaven can
see those in a lower heaven, although if permitted to talk with them
they would lose their wisdom, as has been said above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="210.">210.</span></span>

The thoughts and affections as well as the speech of the angels of the
inmost heaven are never perceived in the middle heaven, because they so
transcend what is there. But when it pleases the Lord there is seen in
the lower heavens from that source something like a flame, and from the
thoughts and affections in the middle heaven there is seen in the
outmost heaven something luminous, and sometimes a cloud glowing white
and variegated. From that cloud, its ascent, descent, and form, what is
being said there is in some measure known.

<span class="margnote"><span id="211.">211.</span></span>

From all this it can be seen what the form of heaven is, namely, that it
is the most perfect of all in the inmost heaven; in the middle heaven it
is also perfect, but in a lower degree, and in the outmost heaven in a
degree still lower; also that the form of one heaven has its permanent
existence from another by means of influx from the Lord. But what
communication by influx is cannot be understood unless it is known what
degrees of height are, and how they differ from degrees of length and
breadth. What these different degrees are may be seen above (n 38).

<span class="margnote"><span id="212.">212.</span></span>

When it comes to the particulars of the form of heaven and how it
proceeds and flows, this not even the angels can comprehend. Some
conception of it can be gained from the form of all things in the human
body, when this is scanned and investigated by an acute and wise man;
for it has been shown above, in their respective chapters, that the
entire heaven reflects a single man (see n. 59-72) and that all things
in man correspond to the heavens (n. 87-102). How incomprehensible and
inexplicable that form is is evident only in a general way from the
nervous fibers, by which each part and all parts of the body are woven
together. What these fibers are, and how they proceed and flow in the
brain, the eye cannot at all perceive; for innumerable fibers are there
so interwoven that taken together they appear like a soft continuous
mass; and yet it is in accord with these that each thing and all things
of the will and understanding flow with the utmost distinctness into
acts. How again they interweave themselves in the body is clear from the
various plexuses, such as those of the heart, the mesentery, and others;
and also from the knots called ganglions, into which many fibers enter
from every region and there intermingle, and when variously joined
together go forth to their functions, and this again and again; besides
like things in every viscus, member, organ, and muscle. Whoever examines
these fibers and their many wonders with the eye of wisdom will be
utterly bewildered. And yet the things seen with the eye are few, and
those not seen are still more wonderful because they belong to an inner
realm of nature. It is clearly evident that this form corresponds to the
form of heaven, because all the workings of the understanding and the
will are within it and are in accordance with it; for it is in
accordance with this form that whatever a man wills passes spontaneously
into act, and whatever he thinks spreads through the fibers from their
beginnings even to their terminations, which is the source of
sensations; and inasmuch as it is the form of thought and will, it is
the form of intelligence and wisdom. Such is the form that corresponds
to the form of heaven. And from this it can be known that such is the
form in accordance with which every affection and thought of angels
extends itself, and that so far as the angels are in that form they are
in intelligence and wisdom. That this form of heaven is from the Divine
Human of the Lord can be seen above (n. 78-86). All this has been said
to make clear also that the heavenly form is such that even as to its
generals it can never be completely known, thus that it is
incomprehensible even to the angels, as has been said above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="213.">213.</span></span>

GOVERNMENTS IN HEAVEN. As heaven is divided into societies, and the
larger societies consist of some hundreds of thousands of angels (n.
50), and all within a society, although in like good, are not in like
wisdom (n. 43), it must needs follow that governments exist there, since
order must be observed, and all things of order must be guarded. But the
governments in the heavens differ; they are of one sort in societies
that constitute the Lord's celestial kingdom, and of another sort in the
societies that constitute His spiritual kingdom; they differ also in
accordance with the functions of the several societies. Nevertheless, no
other government than the government of mutual love is possible in the
heavens, and the government of mutual love is heavenly government.

<span class="margnote"><span id="214.">214.</span></span>

Government in the Lord's celestial kingdom is called righteousness
because all in that kingdom are in the good of love to the Lord from the
Lord, and whatever is from that good is called righteous. Government
there belongs to the Lord alone. He leads them and teaches them in the
affairs of life. The truths that are called truths of judgment are
written on their hearts; everyone knows them, perceives them, and sees
them; <span id="fr_153"></span>[214-1](#fn_153.md) and in consequence
matters of judgment there never come into question, but only matters of
righteousness, which belong to the life. About these matters the less
wise consult the more wise, and these consult the Lord and receive
answers. Their heaven, that is, their inmost joy, is to live rightly
from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="215.">215.</span></span>

In the Lord's spiritual kingdom the government is called judgment;
because those in that kingdom are in spiritual good, which is the good
of charity towards the neighbor, and that good in its essence is
truth; <span id="fr_154"></span>[215-1](#fn_154.md) and truth pertains to
judgment, as good pertains to righteousness. <span
id="fr_155"></span>[215-2](#fn_155.md) These, too, are led by the Lord, but
mediately (n. 208); and in consequence they have governors, few or many
according to the need of the society in which they are. They also have
laws according to which they live together. The governors administer all
things in accordance with the laws, which they understand because they
are wise, and in doubtful matters they are enlightened by the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="216.">216.</span></span>

As government from good, which is the kind of government that exists in
the Lord's celestial kingdom, is called righteousness; and government
from truth, which is the kind of government that exists in the Lord's
spiritual kingdom, is called judgment, so the terms "righteousness and
judgment" are used in the Word when heaven and the church are treated
of, "righteousness" signifying celestial good, and "judgment" spiritual
good, which good, as has been said above, is in its essence truth, as in
the following passages: Of peace there shall be no end upon the throne
of David and upon His kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it in
judgment and in righteousness from henceforth and even to eternity
(Isaiah 9:7). By "David" here the Lord is meant; <span
id="fr_156"></span>[216-1](#fn_156.md) and by "His kingdom" heaven, as is
evident from the following passage: I will raise unto David a righteous
Branch, and He shall reign as King, and shall deal intelligently and
shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land (Jer. 23:5).
Jehovah is exalted, for He dwelleth on high; He hath filled Zion with
judgment and righteousness (Isaiah 33:5). "Zion" also means heaven and
the church. <span id="fr_157"></span>[216-2](#fn_157.md) I, Jehovah, doing
judgment and righteousness on the earth, for in these things I delight
(Jer. 9:24). I will betroth thee unto Me forever, and I will betroth
thee unto Me in righteousness and judgment (Hosea 2:19). O Jehovah, in
the heavens Thy righteousness is like the mountains of God, and Thy
judgments are like the great deep (Psalm 36:5, 6). They ask of Me the
judgments of righteousness, they long for an approach unto God (Isaiah
58:2). So in other places.

<span class="margnote"><span id="217.">217.</span></span>

In the Lord's spiritual kingdom there are various forms of government,
differing in different societies, the variety being in accord with the
functions performed by the societies; and the functions of these are in
accord with the functions of all things in man to which they correspond.
That these are various is well known, the heart having one function, the
lungs another, the liver another, the pancreas and spleen another, and
each sensory organ another. As in the body these organs perform various
services, so there are various services pertaining to the societies in
the Greatest Man, which is heaven for the societies there correspond to
these organs. That there is a correspondence of all things of heaven
with all things of man may be seen in its own chapter above (n. 87-102).
But all these forms of government agree in this, that they look to the
public good as their end, and in that good to the good of the
individual. <span id="fr_158"></span>[217-1](#fn_158.md) And this is so
because everyone in the whole heaven is under the auspices of the Lord,
who loves all, and from Divine love ordains that there shall be a common
good, from which each individual shall receive his own good. Each one,
moreover, receives good according as he loves the common good; for so
far as he loves the common good he loves all and everyone; and as that
love is love of the Lord he is to that extent loved by the Lord, and
good comes to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="218.">218.</span></span>

From all this it can be seen what the governors there are, namely, that
they are such as are preeminent in love and wisdom, and therefore desire
the good of all, and from wisdom know how to provide for the realization
of that good. Such governors do not domineer or dictate, but they
minister and serve (to serve meaning to do good to others from a love of
the good, and to minister meaning to see to it that the good is done);
nor do they make themselves greater than others, but less, for they put
the good of society and of the neighbor in the first place, and put
their own good last; and whatever is in the first place is greater and
what is last is less. Nevertheless, the rulers have honor and glory;
they dwell in the midst of the society, in higher position than the
rest, and also in magnificent palaces; and this glory and honor they
accept not for the sake of themselves but for the sake of obedience; for
all there know that they have this honor and glory from the Lord, and on
that account should be obeyed. This is what is meant by the Lord's words
to His disciples Whosoever would become great among you let him be your
minister; and whosoever would be first among you let him be your
servant; as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to
minister (Matt. 20:27, 28). He that is greatest among you let him be as
the least, and he that is chief as he that doth minister (Luke 22:26).

<span class="margnote"><span id="219.">219.</span></span>

Also in each house there is a like government in a lesser form. In every
house there is a master and there are servants; the master loves the
servants and the servants love the master, consequently they serve each
other from love. The master teaches how they ought to live, and tells
what is to be done; the servants obey and perform their duties. To
perform use is the delight of everyone's life. This shows that the
Lord's kingdom is a kingdom of uses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="220.">220.</span></span>

Also in the hells there are governments, for without governments they
could not be kept in restraint; but the governments there are opposite
to the governments in the heavens; they are governments of the love of
self. Everyone there wishes to dictate to others and to be over others.
They hate those that do not favor them, and make them objects of their
vengeance and fury, for such is the nature of the love of self.
Therefore the more malignant are set over them as governors, and these
they obey from fear. <span id="fr_159"></span>[220-1](#fn_159.md) But of
this below, where the hells are treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="221.">221.</span></span>

DIVINE WORSHIP IN HEAVEN. Divine worship in the heavens is not unlike in
externals Divine worship on the earth, but in internals it is different.
In the heavens, as on the earth, there are doctrines, preachings, and
church edifices. In essentials the doctrines there are everywhere the
same; but in the higher heavens they contain more interior wisdom than
in the lower. The preachings are in harmony with the doctrines; and as
they have houses and palaces (n. 183-190), so they have also church
edifices, in which there is preaching. Such things exist in heaven,
because the angels are being perfected continually in wisdom and love.
For they possess, as men do, understanding and will; and both their
understanding and their will are capable of being continually perfected,
the understanding by means of truths of intelligence, and the will by
means of the goods of love. <span id="fr_160"></span>[221-1](#fn_160.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="222.">222.</span></span>

But essential Divine worship in the heavens does not consist in going to
church and hearing preaching, but in a life of love, charity, and faith,
in accordance with doctrine; preachings in churches serve solely as
means of instruction in matters of life. I have talked with angels on
this subject, and have told them that it is believed in the world that
Divine worship consists solely in attending church, listening to the
preaching, observing the sacrament of the Supper three or four times a
year, and performing other acts of worship according to the requirements
of the church; also devoting special times to prayers, and at such
times, behaving devoutly. The angels said that these are outward acts
that ought to be done, but are of no avail unless there is an internal
from which they proceed, which is a life in accordance with the precepts
that doctrine teaches.

<span class="margnote"><span id="223.">223.</span></span>

That I might learn about their meeting in places of worship, I have been
permitted at times to attend and to hear the preaching. The preacher
stands in a pulpit at the east. Those who are in the light of wisdom
more than others sit in front of him; those who are in less light sit to
the right and left of these. There is a circular arrangement of the
seats, so that all are in the preacher's view, no one so sitting at
either side as to be out of his view. At the entrance, which is at the
east of the building and on the left of the pulpit, those stand who are
being initiated. No one is permitted to stand behind the pulpit; when
there is any one there the preacher becomes confused. It is the same if
any one in the congregation dissents; and for this reason the dissenter
must needs turn away his face. The wisdom of the preachings is such as
to be above all comparison with the preachings of this world, for those
in the heavens are in interior light. The church edifices in the
spiritual kingdom are apparently built of stone, and those in the
celestial kingdom of wood; because stone corresponds to truth, and those
who are in the spiritual kingdom are in truth, while wood corresponds to
good, and those in the celestial kingdom are in good. <span
id="fr_161"></span>[223-1](#fn_161.md) In that kingdom the sacred edifices
are not called churches but houses of God. In that kingdom they are
without magnificence; but in the spiritual kingdom they are more or less
magnificent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="224.">224.</span></span>

I have also talked with one of the preachers about the holy state in
which those are who listen to the preaching in the churches. He said
that everyone is pious, devout, and holy in harmony with his interiors,
which pertain to love and faith, for holiness itself is in love and
faith, because the Divine of the Lord is in them. He also said that he
did not know what outward holiness is apart from love and faith; and
when he thought about it he said that perhaps it is something
counterfeiting holiness in outward appearance, either conventional or
hypocritical; and that such holiness is kindled and sustained by
spurious fire from the love of self and the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="225.">225.</span></span>

All the preachers are from the Lord's spiritual kingdom; none are from
the celestial kingdom. They are from the spiritual kingdom because the
angels there are in truths from good, and all preaching must be from
truths. There are no preachers from the celestial kingdom because those
who are there are in the good of love, and they see and perceive truths
from good, but do not talk about them. But although the angels in the
celestial kingdom perceive and see truths there are preachings there,
since by means of preachings they are enlightened in the truths that
they already know, and are perfected by many truths that they did not
know before. As soon as they hear truths they acknowledge them and thus
perceive them; and the truths they perceive they love, and by living in
accordance with them they make them to be of their life, declaring that
living in accordance with truths is loving the Lord. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[225-1](#fn_162.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="226.">226.</span></span>

All preachers are appointed by the Lord, and have therefrom a gift for
preaching. No others are permitted to preach in the churches. They are
not called priests, but preachers. They are not called priests because
the celestial kingdom is the priesthood of heaven; for priesthood
signifies the good of love to the Lord, and those in the celestial
kingdom are in that good; while the spiritual kingdom is the kingship of
heaven, for kingship signifies truth from good, and those in the
spiritual kingdom are in that truth (see above, n. 24). <span
id="fr_163"></span>[226-1](#fn_163.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="227.">227.</span></span>

The doctrines with which their preachings are in accord all look to life
as their end, and none look to faith separate from the life. The
doctrine of the inmost heaven is more full of wisdom than the doctrine
of the middle heaven, and this more full of intelligence than the
doctrine of the outmost heaven; for in each heaven the doctrines are
adapted to the perceptions of the angels. The essential of all doctrines
is acknowledging the Divine Human of the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="228.">228.</span></span>

THE POWER OF THE ANGELS OF HEAVEN. That the angels possess power cannot
be comprehended by those who know nothing about the spiritual world and
its influx into the natural world. Such think that angels can have no
power because they are spiritual and are even so pure and unsubstantial
that no eye can see them. But those who look more interiorly into the
causes of things take a different view. Such know that all the power
that a man has is from his understanding and will (for apart from these
he is powerless to move a particle of his body), and his understanding
and will are his spiritual man. This moves the body and its members at
its pleasure; for whatever it thinks the mouth and tongue speak, and
whatever it wills the body does; and it bestows its strength at
pleasure. As man's will and understanding are ruled by the Lord through
angels and spirits, so also are all things of his body, because these
are from the will and understanding; and if you will believe it, without
influx from heaven man cannot even move a step. That this is so has been
shown me by much experience. Angels have been permitted to move my
steps, my actions, and my tongue and speech, as they pleased, and this
by influx into my will and thought; and I have learned thereby that of
myself I could do nothing. I was afterwards told by them that every man
is so ruled, and that he can know this from the doctrine of the church
and from the Word, for he prays that God may send His angels to lead
him, direct his steps, teach him, and inspire in him what to think and
what to say, and other like things; although he says and believes
otherwise when he is thinking by himself apart from doctrine. All this
has been said to make known what power angels have with man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="229.">229.</span></span>

But so great is the power of angels in the spiritual world that if I
should make known all that I have witnessed in regard to it it would
exceed belief. Any obstruction there that ought to be removed because it
is contrary to Divine order the angels cast down or overthrow merely by
an effort of the will and a look. Thus I have seen mountains that were
occupied by the evil cast down and overthrown, and sometimes shaken from
end to end as in earthquakes; also rocks cleft asunder to their bottoms,
and the evil who were upon them swallowed up. I have seen also hundreds
of thousands of evil spirits dispersed by angels and cast down into
hell. Numbers are of no avail against them; neither are devices,
cunning, or combinations; for they see through them all, and disperse
them in a moment. (But more may be seen on this subject in the account
of The Destruction of Babylon.) Such power do angels have in the
spiritual world. It is evident from the Word that they have like power
in the natural world also when it is permitted; for instance, that they
have given to destruction entire armies; and that they brought on a
pestilence from which seventy thousand men died. Of this angel it is
said: The angel stretched out his hand against Jerusalem to destroy it
but Jehovah repented Him of the evil, and said to the angel that
destroyed the people, It is enough, now stay thy hand. And David saw the
angel that smote the people (2 Samuel 24:16, 17); besides other
passages. Because the angels have such power they are called powers; as
in David: Bless Jehovah, ye angels, mighty in power (Psalm 103:20).

<span class="margnote"><span id="230.">230.</span></span>

But it must be understood that the angels have no power whatever from
themselves, but that all their power is from the Lord; and that they are
powers only so far as they acknowledge this. Whoever of them believes
that he has power from himself instantly becomes so weak as not to be
able to resist even a single evil spirit. For this reason angels ascribe
no merit whatever to themselves, and are averse to all praise and glory
on account of any thing they do, ascribing all the praise and glory to
the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="231.">231.</span></span>

It is the Divine truth that goes forth from the Lord that has all power
in the heavens, for the Lord in heaven is Divine truth united to Divine
good (see n. 126-140). To the extent that angels are receptions of this
truth they are powers. <span id="fr_164"></span>[231-1](#fn_164.md)
Moreover each one is his own truth and his own good because each one is
such as his understanding and will are. The understanding pertains to
truth because everything of it is from truths, and the will pertains to
good because everything of it is from goods; for whatever any one
understands he calls truth, and whatever he wills he calls good. From
this it is that everyone is his own truth and his own good. <span
id="fr_165"></span>[231-2](#fn_165.md) Therefore so far as an angel is
truth from the Divine and good from the Divine he is a power, because to
that extent the Lord is in him. And as no one's good and truth are
wholly like or the same as another's, since in heaven, as in the world,
there is endless variety (n. 20), so the power of one angel is not like
the power of another. Those who constitute the arms in the Greatest Man,
or heaven, have the greatest power because such are more in truths than
others, and into their truths good flows from the entire heaven.
Moreover, the power of the whole man passes into the arms, and by means
of these the whole body exercises its powers. It is for this reason that
in the Word "arms" and "hand" signify powers. <span
id="fr_166"></span>[231-3](#fn_166.md) Sometimes on this account a naked
arm is seen in heaven so powerful as to be able to break in pieces
everything in its way, even though it were a great rock on the earth.
Once it was moved towards me, and I perceived that it was able to crush
my bones to atoms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="232.">232.</span></span>

It has been shown above (n. 137) that the Divine truth that goes forth
from the Lord has all power, and that angels have power to the extent
that they are receptions of Divine truth from the Lord. But angels are
so far receptions of Divine truth as they are receptions of Divine good,
for truths have all their power from good, and none apart from good. So,
too, good has all its power through truths, and none apart from truths.
Power springs from the conjunction of these two. The same is true of
faith and love; for it is the same whether you say truth or faith, since
everything of faith is truth; also it is the same whether you say good
or love, since everything of love is good. <span
id="fr_167"></span>[232-1](#fn_167.md) The great power that angels have by
means of truths from good is shown also from this, that when an evil
spirit is merely looked at by the angels he falls into a swoon, and does
not appear like a man, and this until the angel turns away his eyes.
Such an effect is produced by the look of the eyes of angels, because
the sight of angels is from the light of heaven, and the light of heaven
is Divine truth (see above, n. 126-132). Moreover, the eyes correspond
to truths from good. <span id="fr_168"></span>[232-2](#fn_168.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="233.">233.</span></span>

As truths from good have all power, so falsities from evil have no power
at all; <span id="fr_169"></span>[233-1](#fn_169.md) and as all in hell are
in falsities from evil they have no power against truth and good. But
what power they have among themselves, and what power evil spirits have
before they are cast into hell, will be told hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="234.">234.</span></span>

THE SPEECH OF ANGELS. Angels talk with each other just as men do in the
world, and on various subjects, as on domestic matters, and on matters
of the civil state, and of moral, and spiritual life. And there is no
difference except that their talk is more intelligent than that of men,
because it is from more interior thought. I have been permitted to
associate with them frequently, and to talk with them as friend with
friend, and sometimes as stranger with stranger; and as I was then in a
state like theirs I knew no otherwise than that I was talking with men
on the earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="235.">235.</span></span>

Angelic speech, like human speech, is distinguished into words; it is
also audibly uttered and heard; for angels, like men, have mouth,
tongue, and ears, and an atmosphere in which the sound of their speech
is articulated, although it is a spiritual atmosphere adapted to angels,
who are spiritual. In their atmosphere angels breathe and utter words by
means of their breath, as men do In their atmosphere. <span
id="fr_170"></span>[235-1](#fn_170.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="236.">236.</span></span>

In the entire heaven all have the same language, and they all understand
one another, to whatever society, near or remote, they belong. Language
there is not learned but is instinctive with everyone, for it flows from
their very affection and thought, the tones of their speech
corresponding to their affections, and the vocal articulations which are
words corresponding to the ideas of thought that spring from the
affections; and because of this correspondence the speech itself is
spiritual, for it is affection sounding and thought speaking. \[2\] Any
one who gives any thought to it can see that all thought is from
affection which pertains to love, and that the ideas of thought are the
various forms into which the general affection is distributed; for no
thought or idea is possible apart from affection-the soul and life of
thought is from affection. This enables angels to know, merely from
another's speech, what he is-from the tone what his affection is, and
from the vocal articulations or words what his mind is. The wiser angels
know what the ruling affection is from a single series of words, for
that affection is what they chiefly attend to. \[3\] It is known that
each individual has a variety of affections, one affection when in joy,
another when in grief, another when in sympathy and compassion, another
when in sincerity and truth, another when in love and charity, another
when in zeal or in anger, another when in simulation and deceit, another
when in quest of honor and glory, and so on. But the ruling affection or
love is in all of these; and for this reason the wiser angels, because
they perceive that love, know from the speech the whole state of
another. \[4\] This it has been granted me to know from much experience.
I have heard angels disclosing the character of another's life merely
from hearing him speak. They also said that from any ideas of another's
thought they could know all things of his life, because from those ideas
they know his ruling love, in which are all things in their order. They
know also that man's book of life is nothing else.

<span class="margnote"><span id="237.">237.</span></span>

Angelic language has nothing in common with human languages except
certain words that are the sounds of a specific affection; yet this is
true not of the words themselves but of their sounds; on which subject
something will be said in what follows That angelic language has nothing
in common with human languages is evident from the fact that angels are
unable to utter a single word of human language. This was tried but they
could not do it, because they can utter nothing except what is in entire
agreement with their affections; whatever is not in agreement is
repugnant to their very life, for life belongs to affection, and their
speech is from their life. I have been told that the first language of
men on our earth coincided with angelic language because they had it
from heaven; and that the Hebrew language coincides with it in some
respects.

<span class="margnote"><span id="238.">238.</span></span>

As the speech of angels corresponds to their affection, and their
affection belongs to their love, and as the love of heaven is love to
the Lord and love towards the neighbor (see above, n. 13-19), it is
evident how choice and delightful their talk must be, affecting not the
ears only but also the interiors of the mind of those who listen to it.
There was a certain hard-hearted spirit with whom an angel spoke. At
length he was so affected by what was said that he shed tears, saying
that he had never wept before, but he could not refrain, for it was love
speaking.

<span class="margnote"><span id="239.">239.</span></span>

The speech of angels is likewise full of wisdom because it proceeds from
their interior thoughts, and their interior thought is wisdom, as their
interior affection is love, and in their speech their love and wisdom
unite. For this reason their speech is so full of wisdom that they can
express in a single word what man cannot express in a thousand words
also the ideas of their thought include things that are beyond man's
comprehension, and still more his power of expression. This is why the
things that have been heard and seen in heaven are said to be ineffable,
and such as ear hath never heard nor eye seen. \[2\] That this is true I
have also been permitted to learn by experience. At times I have entered
into the state in which angels are, and in that state have talked with
them, and I then understood everything. But when I was brought back into
my former state, and thus into the natural thought proper to man, and
wished to recall what I had heard I could not; for there were thousands
of things unadapted to the ideas of natural thought, and therefore
inexpressible except by variegations of heavenly light, and thus not at
all by human words. \[3\] Also the ideas of thought of the angels from
which their words spring are modifications of the light of heaven, and
the affections from which the tones of the words spring are variations
of the heat of heaven, the light of heaven being Divine truth or wisdom,
and the heat of heaven the Divine good or love (see above, n. 126-140);
and the angels have their affection from the Divine love, and their
thought from the Divine wisdom. <span
id="fr_171"></span>[239-1](#fn_171.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="240.">240.</span></span>

Because the speech of angels proceeds directly from their affection, and
the ideas of their thought are the various forms into which their
general affection is distributed (see above, n. 236), angels can express
in a moment what a man cannot express in half an hour; also they can set
forth in a few words what has been expressed in writing on many pages;
and this, too, has been proved to me by much experience. <span
id="fr_172"></span>[240-1](#fn_172.md) Thus the angels' ideas of thought
and the words of their speech make one, like effecting cause and effect;
for what is in the ideas of thought as cause is presented in the words
as effect, and this is why every word comprehends in itself so many
things. Also all the particulars of angelic thought, and thus of angelic
speech, appear when presented to view like a thin wave or circumfluent
atmosphere, in which are innumerable things in their order derived from
angelic wisdom, and these enter another's thought and affect him. The
ideas of thought of everyone, both angel and man, are presented to view
in the light of heaven, whenever the Lord pleases. <span
id="fr_173"></span>[240-2](#fn_173.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="241.">241.</span></span>

The speech of angels of the Lord's celestial kingdom resembles the
speech of the angels of His spiritual kingdom, but it is from more
interior thought. Celestial angels are in good of love to the Lord, and
therefore speak from wisdom; while spiritual angels are in the good of
charity towards the neighbor, which in its essence is truth (n. 215),
and therefore speak from intelligence, for wisdom is from good, and
intelligence is from truth. For this reason the speech of celestial
angels is like a gentle stream, soft, and as it were continuous; but the
speech of spiritual angels is slightly vibratory and divided. The speech
of celestial angels has much of the tones of the vowels u and o; while
the speech of spiritual angels has much of the tones of e and i\*; for
the vowels stand for tone, and in the tone there is affection, the tone
of the speech of angels corresponding to their affection, as has been
said above (n. 236); while the vocal articulations, which are words,
correspond to the ideas of thought which spring from affection. As the
vowels are not essential to a language, but serve by means of tones to
elevate the words to the various affections according to each one's
state, so in the Hebrew tongue the vowels are not expressed, and are
also variously pronounced. From this a man's quality in respect to his
affection and love is known to the angels. Also in the speech of
celestial angels there are no hard consonants, and it rarely passes from
one consonant to another without the interposition of a word beginning
with a vowel. This is why in the Word the particle "and" is so often
interposed, as can be seen by those who read the Word in the Hebrew, in
which this particle is soft, beginning and ending with a vowel sound.
Again, in the Word, in Hebrew, it can in some measure be seen from the
words used whether they belong to the celestial class or the spiritual
class, that is, whether they involve good or truth. Those involving good
partake largely of the sounds of u and o, and also somewhat of a, while
those involving truth partake of the sounds of e and i. Because it is
especially in tones that affections express themselves, so in human
speech, when great subjects are discussed, such as heaven \[caelum\] and
God \[Deus\], those words are preferred that contain the vowels u and o;
and musical tones, whenever such themes are to be expressed, rise to the
same fullness; but not when less exalted themes are rendered. By such
means musical art is able to express affections of various kinds. \*
\[As these vowels are pronounced in European language. - Tr.\]

<span class="margnote"><span id="242.">242.</span></span>

In angelic speech there is a kind of symphony that cannot be
described; <span id="fr_174"></span>[242-1](#fn_174.md) which comes from
the pouring forth and diffusion of the thoughts and affections from
which speech flows, in accordance with the form of heaven, and all
affiliation and all communication in heaven is in accordance with that
form. That angels are affiliated in accordance with the form of heaven,
and that their thoughts and affections flow in accordance with it may be
seen above (n. 200-212).

<span class="margnote"><span id="243.">243.</span></span>

Speech like that in the spiritual world is inherent in every man in his
interior intellectual part; but man does not know this, because this
speech does not with man, as with angels, fall into words analogous to
affection; nevertheless this is what causes man, when he enters the
other life, to come into the same speech as spirits and angels, and thus
to know how to speak without instruction. <span
id="fr_175"></span>[243-1](#fn_175.md) But more on this subject hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="244.">244.</span></span>

In heaven, as has been said above, all have one speech; but it is varied
in this respect, that the speech of the wise is more interior and more
full of variations of affections and ideas of thought, while the speech
of the less wise is more external and less full; and the speech of the
simple is still more external, consisting of words from which the
meaning is to be gathered in the same way as when men are talking to one
another. There is also speech by the face, terminating in something
sonorous modified by ideas. Again, there is speech in which heavenly
representatives are mingled with the ideas, and go forth from ideas to
sight. There is also speech by gestures that correspond to affections,
and represent things like those expressed by their words. There is
speech by means of the generals of affections and the generals of
thoughts. There is speech like thunder; besides other kinds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="245.">245.</span></span>

The speech of evil and infernal spirits is likewise natural to them
because it is from affections; but it is from evil affections and
consequent filthy ideas, to which angels are utterly averse. Thus the
modes of speaking in hell are opposite to those of heaven; and in
consequence evil spirits cannot endure angelic speech, and angels cannot
endure infernal speech. To the angels infernal speech is like a bad odor
striking the nostrils. The speech of hypocrites, who are such as are
able to feign themselves angels of light, resembles in respect to words
the speech of angels, but in respect to affections and consequent ideas
of thought it is the direct opposite. Consequently, when the inner
nature of their speech is perceived as wise angels perceive it, it is
heard as the gnashing of teeth, and strikes with horror.

<span class="margnote"><span id="246.">246.</span></span>

THE SPEECH OF ANGELS WITH MAN. Angels who talk with man do not talk in
their own language, nor in any language unknown to man, but in the man's
own language, or in some other language with which he is acquainted.
This is so because when angels speak with man they turn themselves to
him and conjoin themselves with him; and this conjunction of angel with
man causes the two to be in like thought; and as man's thought coheres
to his memory, and this is the source of his speech, the two have the
same language. Moreover, when an angel or a spirit comes to a man, and
by turning to him is conjoined to him, he so enters into the entire
memory of the man that he is scarcely conscious that he does not himself
know whatever the man knows, including his languages. \[2\] I have
talked with angels about this, and have said that perhaps they thought
that they were addressing me in my mother tongue, since it is so
perceived; and yet it was I and not they that spoke; and that this is
evident from the fact that angels cannot utter a single word of human
language (see n. 237); furthermore, human language is natural and they
are spiritual, and spiritual beings cannot give expression to any thing
in a natural way. To this they replied that they are aware that their
conjunction with the man with whom they are speaking is with his
spiritual thought; but because his spiritual thought flows into his
natural thought, and his natural thought coheres to his memory, the
language of the man and all his knowledge appear to them to be their
own; and that this is so for this reason, that while it is the Lord's
pleasure that there should be such a conjunction with and sort of
insertion of man into heaven, yet the state of man is now such that
there can no longer be such conjunction with angels, but only with
spirits who are not in heaven. \[3\] When I talked about this with
spirits also they were unwilling to believe that it is the man that
speaks, insisting that they spoke in man, also that man's knowledge is
their knowledge and not the man's knowledge, consequently that
everything that man knows is from them. I tried to convince them by many
proofs that this is not true, but in vain. Who are meant by spirits and
who are meant by angels will be told further on when the world of
spirits is treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="247.">247.</span></span>

There is another reason why angels and spirits conjoin themselves so
closely with man as not to know but that what is man's is their own,
namely, that there is such conjunction between the spiritual world and
the natural world in man that the two are seemingly one. But inasmuch as
man has separated himself from heaven the Lord has provided that there
should be angels and spirits with each individual, and that man should
be ruled by the Lord through these. This is the reason for such close
conjunction. It would have been otherwise if man had not separated
himself; for in that case he might have been ruled by the Lord through
the general influx from heaven, without spirits and angels being
adjoined to him. But this subject will be specially considered in what
follows when the conjunction of heaven with man is treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="248.">248.</span></span>

The speech of an angel or spirit with man is heard by him as audibly as
the speech of man with man, yet by himself only, and not by others who
stand near; and for the reason that the speech of an angel or spirit
flows first into a man's thought, and by an inner way into his organ of
hearing, and thus moves it from within; while the speech of man with man
flows first into the air and by an outward way into his organ of
hearing, and moves it from without. Evidently, then, the speech of an
angel or spirit with man is heard within him; but as the organs of
hearing are thus equally moved, the speech is equally audible. That the
speech of an angel or a spirit flows down from within even into the ear
has been made clear to me by the fact that it flows also into the
tongue, causing a slight vibration, but without any such motion as when
the man himself by means of the tongue forms the sound of speech into
words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="249.">249.</span></span>

But at the present day to talk with spirits is rarely granted because it
is dangerous; <span id="fr_176"></span>[249-1](#fn_176.md) for then the
spirits know, what otherwise they do not know, that they are with man;
and evil spirits are such that they hold man in deadly hatred, and
desire nothing so much as to destroy him both soul and body, and this
they do in the case of those who have so indulged themselves in
fantasies as to have separated from themselves the enjoyments proper to
the natural man. Some also who lead a solitary life sometimes hear
spirits talking with them, and without danger; but that the spirits with
them may not know that they are with man they are at intervals removed
by the Lord; for most spirits are not aware that there is any other
world than that in which they live, and therefore are unaware that there
are men anywhere else; and this is why man is not permitted to speak
with them in return. If he did they would know. Again, those who
meditate much on religious subjects, and are so intent upon them as to
see them as it were inwardly within themselves, begin to hear spirits
speaking with them; for religious persuasions, whatever they are, when
man dwells upon them by himself and does not adapt them to the various
things of use in the world, penetrate to the interiors and rest there,
and occupy the whole spirit of the man, and even enter into the
spiritual world and act upon the spirits there. But such persons are
visionaries and enthusiasts; and whatever spirit they hear they believe
to be the Holy Spirit, when, in fact, such spirits are enthusiastic
spirits. Such spirits see falsities as truths, and so seeing them they
induce not themselves only but also those they flow into to believe
them. Such spirits, however, have been gradually removed, because they
began to lure others into evil and to gain control over them.
Enthusiastic spirits are distinguished from other spirits by their
believing themselves to be the Holy Spirit, and believing what they say
to be Divine. As man honors such spirits with Divine worship they do not
attempt to harm him. I have sometimes talked with them, and the wicked
things they infused into their worshipers were then disclosed. They
dwell together towards the left, in a desert place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="250.">250.</span></span>

But to speak with the angels of heaven is granted only to those who are
in truths from good, especially to those who are in the acknowledgment
of the Lord and of the Divine in His Human, because this is the truth in
which the heavens are. For, as it has been shown above, the Lord is the
God of heaven (n. 2-6); it is the Divine of the Lord that makes heaven
(n. 7-12); the Divine of the Lord in heaven is love to Him and charity
towards the neighbor from Him (n. 13-19); the whole heaven in one
complex reflects a single man; also every society of heaven; and every
angel is in complete human form, and this from the Divine Human of the
Lord (n. 59-86). All of which makes evident that only those whose
interiors are opened by Divine Truths, even to the Lord, are able to
speak with the angels of heaven, since it is into these truths with man
that the Lord flows, and when the Lord flows in heaven also flows in.
Divine truths open the interiors of man because man was so created as to
be in respect to his internal man an image of heaven, and in respect to
his external an image of the world (n. 57); and the internal man is
opened only by means of Divine truth going forth from the Lord, because
that is the light of heaven and the life of heaven (n. 126-140).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_146"></span>[201-1](hh05.htm#fr_146.md) The form of heaven is
a form in accordance with the Divine order (n. 4040-4043, 6607, 9877).

<span id="fn_147"></span>[202-1](hh05.htm#fr_147.md) Divine truths are the
laws of order (n. 2447, 7995). Man is a man to the extent that he lives
in accordance with order, that is, to the extent that he is in good in
accordance with Divine truths (n. 4839, 6605, 6626). All things of
Divine order are gathered up in man and he is from creation Divine order
in form (n. 4219, 4220, 4222, 4223, 4523, 4524, 5114, 6013, 6057, 6605,
6626, 9706, 10156, 10472). Man is not born into good and truth, but into
evil and falsity, that is, into the opposite of Divine order, and
consequently into pure ignorance; and for this reason he must needs be
born anew that is, be regenerated, which is effected by means of Divine
truths from the Lord, that he may be introduced into order (n. 1047,
2307, 2308, 3518, 3812, 8480, 8550, 10283, 10284, 10286, 10731). When
the Lord forms man anew, that is, regenerates him, He arranges all
things in him in accordance with order, which means, into the form of
heaven (n. 5700, 6690, 9931, 10303).

<span id="fn_148"></span>[203-1](hh05.htm#fr_148.md) Everyone in heaven has
communication of life, which may be called its extension into angelic
societies round about, according to the quantity and quality of his good
(n. 8794, 8797). Thoughts and affections have such extension (n. 2470,
6598-6613). They are united and separated in accordance with the ruling
affections (n. 4111).

<span id="fn_149"></span>[203-2](hh05.htm#fr_149.md) There is only one
Life, from which all, both in heaven and in the world, live (n. 1954,
2021, 2536, 2658, 2886-2889, 3001, 3484, 3742, 5847, 6467). That life is
from the Lord above (n. 2886-2889, 3344, 3484, 4319, 4320, 4524, 4882,
5986, 6325, 6468-6470, 9276, 10196). It flows into angels, spirits, and
men, in a wonderful manner (n. 2886-2889, 3337, 3338, 3484, 3742). The
Lord flows in from His Divine love, which is such that what is its own
it wills should be another's (n. 3472, 4320). For this reason life
appears to be in man, and not flowing in (n. 3742, 4320). Of the joy of
angels, perceived and confirmed by what they told me, because of their
not living from themselves but from the Lord (n. 6469). The evil are
unwilling to be convinced that life flows in (n. 3743). Life from the
Lord flows in also with the evil (n. 2706, 3743, 4417, 10196). But they
turn good into evil, and truth into falsity; for such as man is such is
his reception of life illustrated (n. 4319, 4320, 4417).

<span id="fn_150"></span>[204-1](hh05.htm#fr_150.md) Thought pours itself
into societies of spirits and of angels round about (n. 6600-6605).
Still it does not move or disturb the thoughts of the societies (n.
6601, 6603).

<span id="fn_151"></span>[205-1](hh05.htm#fr_151.md) Good recognizes its
truth, and truth its good (n. 2429, 3101, 3102, 3161, 3179, 3180, 4358,
5704, 5835, 9637). In this way good and truth are conjoined (n. 3834,
4096, 4097, 4301, 4345, 4353, 4364, 4368, 5365, 7623-7627, 7752-7762,
8530, 9258, 10555). This is effected by influx from heaven (n. 9079).

<span id="fn_152"></span>[208-1](hh05.htm#fr_152.md) There is direct influx
from the Lord and mediate influx through heaven (n. 6063, 6307, 6472,
9682, 9683). There is a direct influx of the Lord into the minutest
parts of all things (n. 6058, 6474-6478, 8717, 8728). Of the mediate
influx of the Lord through the heavens (n. 4067, 6982, 6985, 6996).

<span id="fn_153"></span>[214-1](hh05.htm#fr_153.md) The celestial angels
do not think and speak from truths, as the spiritual angels do, because
they have from the Lord a perception of all things of truth (n. 202,
597, 607, 784, 1121, 1384, 1398, 1442, 1919, 7680, 7877, 8780, 9277,
10336). In respect to truths the celestial angels say, Yea, yea, or Nay,
nay; but the spiritual angels reason about them whether they are true or
not (n. 2715, 3246, 4448, 9166, 10786, where the Lord's words, Let your
speech be Yea, yea, Nay, nay; what is beyond these is from evil (Matt.
5:37). are explained).

<span id="fn_154"></span>[215-1](hh05.htm#fr_154.md) Those in the spiritual
kingdom are in truths, and those in the celestial kingdom are in good
(n. 863, 875, 927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 1555, 2256, 4328, 4493, 5113, 9596)
The good of the spiritual kingdom is the good of charity towards the
neighbor and this good in its essence is truth (n. 8042, 10296).

<span id="fn_155"></span>[215-2](hh05.htm#fr_155.md) In the Word
"righteousness" is predicated of good, and "Judgment" of truth therefore
"to do righteousness and judgment" means good and truth (n. 2235, 9857).
"Great judgments" means the law of Divine order, thus Divine truths (n.
7206).

<span id="fn_156"></span>[216-1](hh05.htm#fr_156.md) By "David" in the
prophetic parts of the Word, the Lord is meant (n. 1888, 9954).

<span id="fn_157"></span>[216-2](hh05.htm#fr_157.md) In the Word "Zion"
means the church, and specifically the celestial church (n. 2362, 9055).

<span id="fn_158"></span>[217-1](hh05.htm#fr_158.md) Every man and every
community, also one's country and the church and in the universal sense
the kingdom of the Lord, is a neighbor, and to do good to these from
love of good in accordance with their state is to love the neighbor;
that is, the neighbor is the good of these, which is the common good
that must be consulted (n. 6818-6824, 8123). Civil good also, which is
justice, is a neighbor (n. 2915, 4730, 8120-8123). Therefore charity
towards the neighbor extends itself to all things and each thing of the
life of man; and loving good and doing good from love of good and truth,
and also doing what is just from a love of what is just in every
function and in every work, is loving the neighbor (n. 2417, 8121-8124).

<span id="fn_159"></span>[220-1](hh05.htm#fr_159.md) There are two kinds of
rule, one from love towards the neighbor the other from love of self (n.
10814). From the rule that is from love towards the neighbor flow all
goods and all happinesses (n. 10160, 10814). In heaven no one desires to
rule from the love of self, but all desire to minister, which means to
rule from love to the neighbor; this is the source of their great power
(n. 5732). From rule from the love of self all evils flow in (n. 10038).
When the loves of self and the world had begun to prevail men were
compelled to subject themselves to governments as a means of security
(n. 7364, 10160, 10814).

<span id="fn_160"></span>[221-1](hh05.htm#fr_160.md) The understanding is
receptive of truth, and the will of good (n. 3623, 6125, 7503, 9300,
9930). As all things have relation to truth and good, so everything of
man's life has relation to understanding and will (n. 803, 10122).
Angels are perfected to eternity (n. 4803, 6648).

<span id="fn_161"></span>[223-1](hh05.htm#fr_161.md) "Stone" signifies
truth (n. 114, 643, 1298, 3720, 6426, 8609, 10376). "Wood" signifies
good (n. 643, 3720, 8354). For this reason the most ancient people, who
were in celestial good, had sacred buildings of wood (n. 3720).

<span id="fn_162"></span>[225-1](hh05.htm#fr_162.md) Loving the Lord and
the neighbor is living in accordance with the Lord's commandments (n.
10143, 10153, 10310, 10578, 10645, 10683).

<span id="fn_163"></span>[226-1](hh05.htm#fr_163.md) Priests represented
the Lord in respect to the Divine good, kings in respect to Divine truth
(n. 2015, 6148). Therefore, in the Word a "priest" signifies those who
are in the good of love to the Lord, and the priesthood signifies that
good (n. 9806, 9809). A "king" in the Word signifies those who are in
Divine truth, and therefrom kingship signifies truth from good (n. 1672,
2015, 2069, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044).

<span id="fn_164"></span>[231-1](hh05.htm#fr_164.md) Angels are called
powers and are powers from their reception of Divine truth from the Lord
(n. 9639). Angels are recipients of Divine truth from the Lord and on
this account are sometimes called "gods" in the Word (n. 4295, 4402,
7268, 7873, 8192, 8301, 9160)

<span id="fn_165"></span>[231-2](hh05.htm#fr_165.md) A man or an angel is
his own good and his own truth, thus his own love and his own faith (n.
10298, 10367). He is his own understanding and his own will, for
everything of life is there from; the life of good is from the will, and
the life of truth is from the understanding (n. 10076 10177 10264,
10284).

<span id="fn_166"></span>[231-3](hh05.htm#fr_166.md) The correspondence of
the hands, arms, and shoulders, with the Greatest man or heaven (n.
4931-4937). In the Word, "arms" and hands signify power (n. 878, 3091,
4932, 4933, 6947, 10019).

<span id="fn_167"></span>[232-1](hh05.htm#fr_167.md) All power in heaven is
the power of truth from good, thus of faith from loves (n. 3091, 3563,
6423, 8304, 9643, 10019, 10182). All power is from the Lord, because
from Him is every truth of faith and every good of love (n. 9327, 9410).
This power is meant by the keys given to Peter (n. 6344). It is Divine
truth going forth from the Lord that has all power (n. 6948, 8200). This
power of the lord is what is meant by "sitting at the right hand of
Jehovah" (n. 3387, 4592, 4933, 7518, 7673, 8281, 9133). The right had
means power (n. 10019).

<span id="fn_168"></span>[232-2](hh05.htm#fr_168.md) The eyes correspond to
truths from good (n.4403-4421, 4523-4534, 6923).

<span id="fn_169"></span>[233-1](hh05.htm#fr_169.md) Falsity from evil has
no power, because truth from food has all power (n 6784, 10481).

<span id="fn_170"></span>[235-1](hh05.htm#fr_170.md) In the heavens there
is respiration, but it is of an interior kind (n. 3884, 3885) from
experience (n. 3884, 3885, 3891, 3893). There are differing respirations
there, varying in accordance with their states (n. 1119, 3886, 3887,
3889, 3892, 3893). The evil are wholly unable to breathe in heaven, and
they are suffocated if they go there (n. 3894).

<span id="fn_171"></span>[239-1](hh05.htm#fr_171.md) The ideas of angels,
from which they speak, are expressed by wonderful variegations of the
light of heaven (n. 1646, 3343, 3993).

<span id="fn_172"></span>[240-1](hh05.htm#fr_172.md) Angels can express by
their speech in a moment more than a man can express by his in half an
hour; and they can also express things that do not fall into the
expressions of human speech (n. 1641-1643, 1645, 4609, 7089).

<span id="fn_173"></span>[240-2](hh05.htm#fr_173.md) The innumerable things
contained in one idea of thought (n. 1008, 1869, 4946, 6613-6618). The
ideas of man's thought are opened in the other life, and what they are
is presented to view to the life (n. 1869, 3310, 5510). What their
appearance is (n. 6601, 8885). The ideas of angels of the inmost heaven
present an appearance of flamy light (n. 6615). The ideas of angels of
the outmost heaven present an appearance of thin white clouds (n. 6614).
An angelic idea seen, from which there was a radiation towards the Lord
(n. 6620). Ideas of thought extend themselves widely into the societies
of angels round about (n. 6598-6613).

<span id="fn_174"></span>[242-1](hh05.htm#fr_174.md) In angelic speech
there is a symphony with harmonious cadence (n. 1648, 1649, 7191).

<span id="fn_175"></span>[243-1](hh05.htm#fr_175.md) There is spiritual or
angelic speech belonging to man, though he does not know it (n. 4104).
The ideas of the internal man are spiritual, but during his life in the
world man perceives them naturally, because he then thinks in what is
natural (n. 10236, 10237, 10551). Man comes after death into his
interior ideas (n. 3226, 3342, 3343, 10568, 10604). Those ideas then
form his speech (n. 2470-2479).

<span id="fn_176"></span>[249-1](hh05.htm#fr_176.md) Man is able to talk
with spirits and angels; and the ancient people frequently talked with
them (n. 67-69, 784, 1634, 1636, 7802). In some earths angels and
spirits appear in human form and talk with the inhabitants (n. 10751,
10752). But on this earth at this day it is dangerous to talk with
spirits, unless man is in true faith, and is led by the Lord (n. 784,
9438, 10751).
