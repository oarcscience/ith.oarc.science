The Lord, speaking in the presence of His disciples of the consummation
of the age, which is the final period of the church, <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1-1](#fn_0.md) says, near the end of what He foretells
about its successive states in respect to love and faith: <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1-2](#fn_1.md) Immediately after the tribulation of those
days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,
and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens
shall be shaken. And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in
heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn; and they shall
see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great
glory. And He shall send forth His angels with a trumpet and a great
sound; and they shall gather together His elect from the four winds,
from the end to end of the heavens (Matt. 24:29-31). Those who
understood these words according to the sense of the letter have no
other belief than that during that latest period, which is called the
final judgment, all these things are to come to pass just as they are
described in the literal sense, that is, that the sun and moon will be
darkened and the stars will fall from the sky, that the sign of the Lord
will appear in the sky, and He Himself will be seen in the clouds,
attended by angels with trumpets; and furthermore, as is foretold else
where, that the whole visible universe will be destroyed, and afterwards
a new heaven with a new earth will come into being. Such is the opinion
of most men in the church at the present day. But those who so believe
are ignorant of the arcana that lie hid in every particular of the Word.
For in every particular of the Word there is an internal sense which
treats of things spiritual and heavenly, not of things natural and
worldly, such as are treated of in the sense of the letter. And this is
true not only of the meaning of groups of words, it is true of each
particular word. <span id="fr_2"></span>[1-3](#fn_2.md) For the Word is
written solely by correspondences, <span id="fr_3"></span>[1-4](#fn_3.md)
to the end that there may be an internal sense in every least particular
of it. What that sense is can be seen from all that has been said and
shown about it in the Arcana Coelestia; also from quotations gathered
from that work in the explanation of The White Horse spoken of in the
Apocalypse. It is according to that sense that what the Lord says in the
passage quoted above respecting His coming in the clouds of heaven is to
be understood. The "sun" there that is to be darkened signifies the Lord
in respect to love; <span id="fr_4"></span>[1-5](#fn_4.md) the "moon" the
Lord in respect to faith; <span id="fr_5"></span>[1-6](#fn_5.md) "stars"
knowledges of good and truth, or of love and faith; <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1-7](#fn_6.md) "the sign of the Son of man in heaven" the
manifestation of Divine truth; "the tribes of the earth" that shall
mourn, all things relating to truth and good or to faith and love; <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1-8](#fn_7.md) "the coming of the Lord in the clouds of
heaven with power and glory" His presence in the Word, and
revelation, <span id="fr_8"></span>[1-9](#fn_8.md) "clouds" signifying the
sense of the letter of the Word, <span id="fr_9"></span>[1-10](#fn_9.md)
and "glory" the internal sense of the Word; <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1-11](#fn_10.md) " the angels with a trumpet and great
voice" signify heaven as a source of Divine truth. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1-12](#fn_11.md) All this makes clear that these words
of the Lord mean that at the end of the church, when there is no longer
any love, and consequently no faith, the Lord will open the internal
meaning of the Word and reveal arcana of heaven. The arcana revealed in
the following pages relate to heaven and hell, and also to the life of
man after death. The man of the church at this date knows scarcely
anything about heaven and hell or about his life after death, although
all these matters are set forth and described in the Word; and yet many
of those born within the church refuse to believe in them, saying in
their hearts, "Who has come from that world and told us?" Lest,
therefore, such a spirit of denial, which especially prevails with those
who have much worldly wisdom, should also infect and corrupt the simple
in heart and the simple in faith, it has been granted me to associate
with angels and to talk with them as man with man, also to see what is
in the heavens and what is in the hells, and this for thirteen years; so
now from what I have seen and heard it has been granted me to describe
these, in the hope that ignorance may thus be enlightened and unbelief
dissipated. Such immediate revelation is granted at this day because
this is what is meant by the Coming of the Lord. \[REFERENCES TO THE
AUTHOR'S ARCANA COELESTIA.\]

<span class="margnote"><span id="2.">2.</span></span>

THE GOD OF HEAVEN IS THE LORD First of all it must be known who the God
of heaven is, since upon that all the other things depend. Throughout
all heaven no other than the Lord alone is acknowledged as the God of
heaven. There it is said, as He Himself taught, That He is one with the
Father; that the Father is in Him, and He in the Father; that he who
sees Him sees the Father; and that everything that is holy goes forth
from Him (John 10:30, 35; 14:9-11; 16:13-15). I have often talked with
angels on this subject, and they have invariably declared that in heaven
they are unable to divide the Divine into three, because they know and
perceive that the Divine is One and this One is in the Lord. They also
said that those of the church who come from this world having an idea of
three Divine beings cannot be admitted into heaven, since their thought
wanders from one Divine being to another; and it is not allowable there
to think three and say one. <span id="fr_12"></span>[2-1](#fn_12.md)
Because in heaven everyone speaks from his thought, since speech there
is the immediate product of the thought, or the thought speaking.
Consequently, those in this world who have divided the Divine into
three, and have adopted a different idea of each, and have not made that
idea one and centered it in the Lord, cannot be received into heaven,
because in heaven there is a sharing of all thoughts, and therefore if
any one came thinking three and saying one, he would be at once found
out and rejected. But let it be known that all those who have not
separated what is true from what is good, or faith from love, accept in
the other life, when they have been taught, the heavenly idea of the
Lord, that He is the God of the universe. It is otherwise with those who
have separated faith from life, that is, who have not lived according to
the precepts of true faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3.">3.</span></span>

Those within the church who have denied the Lord and have acknowledged
the Father only, and have confirmed themselves in that belief, are not
in heaven; and as they are unable to receive any influx from heaven,
where the Lord alone is worshiped, they gradually lose the ability to
think what is true about any subject whatever; and finally they become
as if dumb, or they talk stupidly, and ramble about with their arms
dangling and swinging as if weak in the joints. Again, those who, like
the Socinians, have denied the Divinity of the Lord and have
acknowledged His Humanity only, are likewise outside of heaven; they are
brought forward a little towards the right and are let down into the
deep, and are thus wholly separated from the rest that come from the
Christian world. Finally, those who profess to believe in an invisible
Divine, which they call the soul of the universe \[Ens universi\], from
which all things originated, and who reject all belief in the Lord, find
out that they believe in no God; since this invisible Divine is to them
a property of nature in her first principles, which cannot be an object
of faith and love, because it is not an object of thought. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[3-1](#fn_13.md) Such have their lot among those called
Naturalists. It is otherwise with those born outside the church, who are
called the heathen; these will be treated of hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4.">4.</span></span>

Infants, who form a third part of heaven, are all initiated into the
acknowledgment and belief that the Lord is their Father, and afterwards
that He is the Lord of all, thus the God of heaven and earth. That
children grow up in heaven and are perfected by means of knowledges,
even to angelic intelligence and wisdom, will be seen in the following
pages.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5.">5.</span></span>

Those who are of the church cannot doubt that the Lord is the God of
heaven, for He Himself taught, That all things of the Father are His
(Matt. 11:27; John 16:15; 17:2). And that He hath all power in heaven
and on earth (Matt. 28:18). He says "in heaven and on earth," because He
that rules heaven rules the earth also, for the one depends upon the
other. <span id="fr_14"></span>[5-1](#fn_14.md) "Ruling heaven and earth"
means to receive from the Lord every good pertaining to love and every
truth pertaining to faith, thus all intelligence and wisdom, and in
consequence all happiness, in a word, eternal life. This also the Lord
taught when He said: He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but
he that believeth not the Son shall not see life (John 3:36). Again: I
am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth on Me, though he die
yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and believeth on Me shall never
die (John 11:26, 26). And again: I am the way, the truth, and the life
(John 14:6).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6.">6.</span></span>

There were certain spirits who while living in the world had professed
to believe in the Father; but of the Lord they had the same idea as of
any other man, and therefore did not believe Him to be the God of
heaven. For this reason they were permitted to wander about and inquire
wherever they wished whether there were any other heaven than the heaven
of the Lord. They searched for several days, but nowhere found any.
These were such as place the happiness of heaven in glory and dominion;
and as they were unable to get what they desired, and were told that
heaven does not consist in such things, they became indignant, and
wished for a heaven where they could lord it over others and be eminent
in glory like that in the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7.">7.</span></span>

II\. IT IS THE DIVINE OF THE LORD THAT MAKES HEAVEN. The angels taken
collectively are called heaven, for they constitute heaven; and yet that
which makes heaven in general and in particular is the Divine that goes
forth from the Lord and flows into the angels and is received by them.
And as the Divine that goes forth from the Lord is the good of love and
the truth of faith, the angels are angels and are heaven in the measure
in which they receive good and truth from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8.">8.</span></span>

Everyone in the heavens knows and believes and even perceives that he
wills and does nothing of good from himself, and that he thinks and
believes nothing of truth from himself, but only from the Divine, thus
from the Lord; also that good from himself is not good, and truth from
himself is not truth, because these have in them no life from the
Divine. Moreover, the angels of the inmost heaven clearly perceive and
feel the influx, and the more of it they receive the more they seem to
themselves to be in heaven, because the more are they in love and faith
and in the light of intelligence and wisdom, and in heavenly joy
therefrom; and since all these go forth from the Divine of the Lord, and
in these the angels have their heaven, it is clear that it is the Divine
of the Lord, and not the angels from anything properly their own that
makes heaven. <span id="fr_15"></span>[8-1](#fn_15.md) This is why heaven
is called in the Word the "dwelling-place" of the Lord and "His throne,"
and those who are there are said to be in the Lord. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[8-2](#fn_16.md) But in what manner the Divine goes forth
from the Lord and fills heaven will be told in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9.">9.</span></span>

Angels from their wisdom go still further. They say that not only
everything good and true is from the Lord, but everything of life as
well. They confirm it by this, that nothing can spring from itself, but
only from something prior to itself; therefore all things spring from a
First, which they call the very Being \[Esse\] of the life of all
things. And in like manner all things continue to exist, for continuous
existence is a ceaseless springing forth, and whatever is not
continually held by means of intermediates in connection with the First
instantly disperses and is wholly dissipated. They say also that there
is but One Fountain of life, and that man's life is a rivulet therefrom,
which if it did not unceasingly continue from its fountain would
immediately flow away. \[2\] Again, they say that from this One Fountain
of life, which is the Lord, nothing goes forth except Divine good and
Divine truth, and that each one is affected by these in accordance with
his reception of them, those who receive them in faith and life find
heaven in them while those who reject them or stifle them change them
into hell; for they change good into evil and truth into falsity, thus
life into death. Again, that everything of life is from the Lord they
confirm by this: that all things in the universe have relation to good
and truth,-the life of man's will, which is the life of his love, to
good; and the life of his understanding, which is the life of his faith,
to truth; and since everything good and true comes from above it follows
that everything of life must come from above. \[3\] This being the
belief of the angels they refuse all thanks for the good they do, and
are displeased and withdraw if any one attributes good to them. They
wonder how any one can believe that he is wise from himself or does
anything good from himself. Doing good for one's own sake they do not
call good, because it is done from self. But doing good for the sake of
good they call good from the Divine; and this they say is the good that
makes heaven, because this good is the Lord. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[9-1](#fn_17.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="10.">10.</span></span>

Such spirits as have confirmed themselves during their life in the world
in the belief that the good they do and the truth they believe is from
themselves, or is appropriated to them as their own (which is the belief
of all who place merit in good actions and claim righteousness to
themselves) are not received into heaven. Angels avoid them. They look
upon them as stupid and as thieves; as stupid because they continually
have themselves in view and not the Divine; and as thieves because they
steal from the Lord what is His. These are averse to the belief of
heaven, that it is the Divine of the Lord in the angels that makes
heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11.">11.</span></span>

The Lord teaches that those that are in heaven and in the church are in
the Lord and the Lord is in them, when He says: Abide in Me and I in
you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the
vine, so neither can ye, except ye abide in Me. I am the Vine, ye are
the branches. He that abideth in Me and I in him, the same beareth much
fruit; for apart from Me ye can do nothing (John 15:4, 5).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12.">12.</span></span>

From all this it can now be seen that the Lord dwells in the angels of
heaven in what is His own, and thus that the Lord is the all in all
things of heaven; and this for the reason that good from the Lord is the
Lord in angels, for what is from the Lord is the Lord; consequently
heaven to the angels is good from the Lord, and not anything of their
own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13.">13.</span></span>

III\. IN HEAVEN THE DIVINE OF THE LORD IS LOVE TO HIM AND CHARITY
TOWARDS THE NEIGHBOR. The Divine that goes forth from the Lord is called
in heaven Divine truth, for a reason that will presently appear. This
Divine truth flows into heaven from the Lord from His Divine love. The
Divine love and the Divine truth therefrom are related to each other as
the fire of the sun and the light therefrom in the world, love
resembling the fire of the sun and truth therefrom light from the sun.
Moreover, by correspondence fire signifies love, and light truth going
forth from love. <span id="fr_18"></span>[13-1](#fn_18.md) From this it is
clear what the Divine truth that goes forth from the Lord's Divine love
is-that in its essence it is Divine good joined to Divine truth, and
being so conjoined it vivifies all things of heaven; just as in the
world when the sun's heat is joined to light it makes all things of the
earth fruitful, which takes place in spring and summer. It is otherwise
when the heat is not joined with the light, that is, when the light is
cold; then all things become torpid and lie dead. With the angels this
Divine good, which is compared to heat, is the good of love; and Divine
truth, which is compared to light, is that through which and out of
which good of love comes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14.">14.</span></span>

The Divine in heaven which makes heaven is love, because love is
spiritual conjunction. It conjoins angels to the Lord and conjoins them
to one another, so conjoining them that in the Lord's sight they are all
as one. Moreover, love is the very being \[esse\] of everyone's life;
consequently from love both angels and men have life. Everyone who
reflects can know that the inmost vitality of man is from love, since he
grows warm from the presence of love and cold from its absence, and when
deprived of it he dies. <span id="fr_19"></span>[14-1](#fn_19.md) But it is
to be remembered that the quality of his love is what determines the
quality of each one's life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="15.">15.</span></span>

In heaven there are two distinct loves, love to the Lord and love
towards the neighbor, in the inmost or third heaven love to the Lord, in
the second or middle heaven love towards the neighbor. They both go
forth from the Lord, and they both make heaven. How these two loves are
distinct and how they are conjoined is seen in heaven in clear light,
but in the world only obscurely. In heaven loving the Lord does not mean
loving Him in respect to His person, but it means loving the good that
is from Him; and to love good is to will and do good from love; and to
love the neighbor does not mean loving a companion in respect to his
person, but loving the truth that is from the Word; and to love truth is
to will and do it. This makes clear that these two loves are distinct as
good and truth are distinct, and that they are conjoined as good is
conjoined with truth. <span id="fr_20"></span>[15-1](#fn_20.md) But this
can scarcely be comprehended by men unless it is known what love is,
what good is, and what the neighbor is. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[15-2](#fn_21.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="16.">16.</span></span>

I have repeatedly talked with angels about this matter. They were
astonished, they said, that men of the church do not know that to love
the Lord and to love the neighbor is to love what is good and true, and
to do this from the will, when they ought to know that one evinces love
by willing and doing what another wishes, and it is this that brings
reciprocal love and conjunction, and not loving another without doing
what he wishes, which in itself is not loving; also that men should know
that the good that goes forth from the Lord is a likeness of Him, since
He is in it; and that those who make good and truth to belong to their
life by willing them and doing them become likenesses of the Lord and
are conjoined to Him. Willing is loving to do. That this is so the Lord
teaches in the Word, saying, He that hath My commandments and doeth
them, he it is that loveth Me; and I will love him and will make My
abode with him (John 14:21, 23). And again: If ye do My commandments ye
shall abide in My love (John 15:10).

<span class="margnote"><span id="17.">17.</span></span>

All experience in heaven attests that the Divine that goes forth from
the Lord and that affects angels and makes heaven is love; for all who
are in heaven are forms of love and charity, and appear in ineffable
beauty, with love shining forth from their faces, and from their speech
and from every particular of their life. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[17-1](#fn_22.md) Moreover, there are spiritual spheres
of life emanating from and surrounding every angel and every spirit, by
which their quality in respect to the affections of their love is known,
sometimes at a great distance. For with everyone these spheres flow
forth from the life of his affection and consequent thought, or from the
life of his love and consequent faith. The spheres that go forth from
angels are so full of love as to affect the inmosts of life of those who
are with them. They have repeatedly been perceived by me and have thus
affected me. <span id="fr_23"></span>[17-2](#fn_23.md) That it is love from
which angels have their life is further evident from the fact that in
the other life everyone turns himself in accordance with his love-those
who are in love to the Lord and in love towards the neighbor turning
themselves always to the Lord, while those who are in love of self turn
themselves always away from the Lord. This is so, however their bodies
may turn, since with those in the other life spaces conform to the
states of their interiors, likewise quarters, which are not constant as
they are in this world, but are determined in accordance with the
direction of their faces. And yet it is not the angels that turn
themselves to the Lord; but the Lord turns to Himself those that love to
do the things that are from Him. <span id="fr_24"></span>[17-3](#fn_24.md)
But more on this subject hereafter, where the quarters in the other life
are treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="18.">18.</span></span>

The Divine of the Lord in heaven is love, for the reason that love is
receptive of all things of heaven, such as peace, intelligence, wisdom
and happiness. For love is receptive of each and all things that are in
harmony with it; it longs for them, seeks them, and drinks them in as it
were spontaneously, for it desires unceasingly to be enriched and
perfected by them. <span id="fr_25"></span>[18-1](#fn_25.md) This, too, man
well knows, for with him love searches as it were the stores of his
memory and draws forth all things that are in accord with itself,
collecting and arranging them in and under itself-in itself that they
may be its own, and under itself that they may be its servants; but
other things not in accord with it it discards and expels. That there is
present in love every capacity for receiving truths in harmony with
itself, and a longing to conjoin them to itself, has been made clear
also by the fact that some who were simple-minded in the world were
taken up into heaven, and yet when they were with the angels they came
into angelic wisdom and heavenly blessedness, and for the reason that
they had loved what is good and true for its own sake, and had implanted
it in their life, and had thereby become capacities for receiving heaven
with all that is ineffable there. But those who are in love of self and
of the world have no capacity for receiving what is good and true; they
loathe and reject it, and at its first touch and entrance they flee and
associate themselves with those in hell who are in loves like their own.
There were spirits who had doubts about there being such capacities in
heavenly love, and who wished to know whether it were true; whereupon
they were let into a state of heavenly love, whatever opposed being for
the time removed, and were brought forward some distance, where there
was an angelic heaven, and from it they talked with me, saying that they
perceived a more interior happiness than they could possibly express in
words, and they lamented greatly that they must return into their former
state. Others also were taken up into heaven; and the higher or more
interiorly they were exalted the more of intelligence and wisdom were
they admitted into, such as enabled them to perceive what had before
been incomprehensible to them. From this it is clear that the love that
goes forth from the Lord is receptive of heaven and all things therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="19.">19.</span></span>

That love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor include in
themselves all Divine truths is made evident by what the Lord Himself
said of these two loves: Thou shalt love thy God with all thy heart and
with all thy soul. This is the greatest and first commandment. And the
second, like unto it, is, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On
these two commandments hang the law and the prophets (Matt. 22:37-40).
"The law and the prophets" are the whole Word, thus all Divine truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="20.">20.</span></span>

IV\. HEAVEN IS DIVIDED INTO TWO KINGDOMS. As there are infinite
varieties in heaven, and no one society nor any one angel is exactly
like any other, <span id="fr_26"></span>[20-1](#fn_26.md) there are in
heaven general, specific, and particular divisions. The general division
is into two kingdoms, the specific into three heavens, and the
particular into innumerable societies. Each of these will be treated of
in what follows. The general division is said to be into kingdoms,
because heaven is called "the kingdom of God."

<span class="margnote"><span id="21.">21.</span></span>

There are angels that receive more interiorly the Divine that goes forth
from the Lord, and others that receive it less interiorly; the former
are called celestial angels, and the latter spiritual angels. Because of
this difference heaven is divided into two kingdoms, one called the
Celestial Kingdom, the other the Spiritual Kingdom. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[21-1](#fn_27.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="22.">22.</span></span>

As the angels that constitute the celestial kingdom receive the Divine
of the Lord more interiorly they are called interior and also higher
angels; and for the same reason the heavens that they constitute are
called interior and higher heavens. <span
id="fr_28"></span>[22-1](#fn_28.md) They are called higher and lower,
because these terms designate what is interior and what is
exterior. <span id="fr_29"></span>[22-2](#fn_29.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="23.">23.</span></span>

The love in which those are, who are in the celestial kingdom is called
celestial love, and the love in which those are who are in the spiritual
kingdom is called spiritual love. Celestial love is love to the Lord,
and spiritual love is love towards the neighbor. And as all good
pertains to love (for good to any one is what he loves) the good also of
the other kingdom is called celestial, and the good of the other
spiritual. Evidently, then, the two kingdoms are distinguished from each
other in the same way as good of love to the Lord is distinguished from
good of love towards the neighbor. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[23-1](#fn_30.md) And as the good of love to the Lord is
an interior good, and that love is interior love, so the celestial
angels are interior angels, and are called higher angels.

<span class="margnote"><span id="24.">24.</span></span>

The celestial kingdom is called also the Lord's priestly kingdom, and in
the Word "His dwelling-place;" while the spiritual kingdom is called His
royal kingdom, and in the Word "His throne." And from the celestial
Divine the Lord in the world was called "Jesus," while from the
spiritual Divine He was called "Christ."

<span class="margnote"><span id="25.">25.</span></span>

The angels in the Lord's celestial kingdom, from their more interior
reception of the Divine of the Lord, far excel in wisdom and glory the
angels that are in His spiritual kingdom; for they are in love to the
Lord, and consequently are nearer and more closely conjoined to
Him. <span id="fr_31"></span>[25-1](#fn_31.md) These angels are such
because they have received and continue to receive Divine truths at once
in their life, and not first in memory and thought, as the spiritual
angels do. Consequently they have Divine truths written in their hearts,
and they perceive them, and as it were see them, in themselves; nor do
they ever reason about them whether they are true or not. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[25-2](#fn_32.md) They are such as are described in
Jeremiah: I will put my law in their mind, and will write it in their
heart. They shall teach no more everyone his friend and everyone his
brother, saying, Know ye Jehovah. They shall know Me, from the least of
them even to the greatest of them (31:33, 34). And they are called in
Isaiah: Taught of Jehovah (54:13). That the "taught of Jehovah" are
those who are taught by the Lord He Himself teaches in John (6:45, 46).

<span class="margnote"><span id="26.">26.</span></span>

It has been said that these angels have wisdom and glory above others
for the reason that they have received and continue to receive Divine
truths at once in their life. For as soon as they hear Divine truths,
they will and do them, instead of storing them up in the memory and
afterwards considering whether they are true. They know at once by
influx from the Lord whether the truth they hear is true; for the Lord
flows directly into man's willing, but mediately through his willing
into his thinking. Or what is the same, the Lord flows directly into
good, but mediately through good into truth. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[26-1](#fn_33.md) That is called good which belongs to
the will and action therefrom, while that is called truth that belongs
to the memory and to the thought therefrom. Moreover, every truth is
turned into good and implanted in love as soon as it enters into the
will; but so long as truth remains in the memory and in the thought
therefrom it does not become good, nor does it live, nor is it
appropriated to man, since man is a man from his will and understanding
therefrom, and not from his understanding separated from his will. <span
id="fr_34"></span>[26-2](#fn_34.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="27.">27.</span></span>

Because of this difference between the angels of the celestial kingdom
and the angels of the spiritual kingdom they are not together, and have
no interaction with each other. They are able to communicate only
through intermediate angelic societies, which are called
celestial-spiritual. Through these the celestial kingdom flows into the
spiritual; <span id="fr_35"></span>[27-1](#fn_35.md) and from this it comes
to pass that although heaven is divided into two kingdoms it
nevertheless makes one. The Lord always provides such intermediate
angels through whom there is communication and conjunction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="28.">28.</span></span>

As the angels of these two kingdoms will be fully treated of in what
follows, particulars are here omitted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="29.">29.</span></span>

THERE ARE THREE HEAVENS. There are three heavens, entirely distinct from
each other, an inmost or third, a middle or second, and an outmost or
first. These have a like order and relation to each other as the highest
part of man, or his head, the middle part, or body, and the lowest, or
feet; or as the upper, the middle, and the lower stories of a house. In
the same order is the Divine that goes forth and descends from the Lord;
consequently heaven, from the necessity of order, is threefold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="30.">30.</span></span>

The interiors of man, which belong to his mind and disposition, are also
in like order. He has an inmost, a middle, and an outmost part; for when
man was created all things of Divine order were brought together in him,
so that he became Divine order in form, and consequently a heaven in
miniature. <span id="fr_36"></span>[30-1](#fn_36.md) For this reason also
man, as regards his interiors, has communication with the heavens and
comes after death among the angels, either among those of the inmost, or
of the middle, or of the outmost heaven, in accordance with his
reception of Divine good and truth from the Lord during his life in the
world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="31.">31.</span></span>

The Divine that flows in from the Lord and is received in the third or
inmost heaven is called celestial, and in consequence the angels there
are called celestial angels; the Divine that flows in from the Lord and
is received in the second or middle heaven is called spiritual, and in
consequence the angels there are called spiritual angels; while the
Divine that flows in from the Lord and is received in the outmost or
first heaven is called natural; but as the natural of that heaven is not
like the natural of the world, but has the spiritual and the celestial
within it, that heaven is called the spiritual-natural and the
celestial-natural, and in consequence the angels there are called
spiritual-natural and celestial-natural. <span
id="fr_37"></span>[31-1](#fn_37.md) Those who receive influx from the
middle or second heaven, which is the spiritual heaven, are called
spiritual-natural; and those who receive influx from the third or inmost
heaven, which is the celestial heaven, are called celestial-natural. The
spiritual-natural angels and the celestial-natural angels are distinct
from each other; nevertheless they constitute one heaven, because they
are in one degree.

<span class="margnote"><span id="32.">32.</span></span>

In each heaven there is an internal and an external; those in the
internal are called there internal angels, while those in the external
are called external angels. The internal and the external in the
heavens, or in each heaven, hold the same relation as the voluntary and
intellectual in man-the internal corresponding to the voluntary, and the
external to the intellectual. Everything voluntary has its intellectual;
one cannot exist without the other. The voluntary may be compared to a
flame and the intellectual to the light therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="33.">33.</span></span>

Let it be clearly understood that with the angels it is the interiors
that cause them to be in one heaven or another; for as their interiors
are more open to the Lord they are in a more interior heaven. There are
three degrees of interiors in each angel and spirit, and also in man.
Those in whom the third degree is opened are in the inmost heaven. Those
in whom the second degree is opened, or only the first, are in the
middle or in the outmost heaven. The interiors are opened by reception
of Divine good and Divine truth. Those who are affected by Divine truths
and admit them at once into the life, thus into the will and into action
therefrom, are in the inmost or third heaven, and have their place there
in accordance with their reception of good from affection for truth.
Those who do not admit truths at once into the will but into the memory,
and thence into the understanding, and from the understanding will and
do them, are in the middle or second heaven. But those who live morally
and who believe in a Divine, and who care very little about being
taught, are in the outmost or first heaven. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[33-1](#fn_38.md) From this it is clear that the states
of the interiors are what make heaven, and that heaven is within
everyone, and not outside of him; as the Lord teaches when He says: The
kingdom of God cometh not with observation, neither shall they say, Lo
here, or Lo there; for behold the kingdom of God ye have within you
(Luke 17:20, 21).

<span class="margnote"><span id="34.">34.</span></span>

Furthermore, all perfection increases towards interiors and decreases
towards exteriors, since interiors are nearer to the Divine, and are in
themselves pure, while exteriors are more remote from the Divine and are
in themselves grosser. <span id="fr_39"></span>[34-1](#fn_39.md)
Intelligence, wisdom, love, everything good and the resulting happiness,
are what constitute angelic perfection; but not happiness apart from
these, for such happiness is external and not internal. Because in the
angels of the inmost heaven the interiors have been opened in the third
degree their perfection immeasurably surpasses the perfection of angels
in the middle heaven, whose interiors have been opened in the second
degree. So the perfection of these angels exceeds in like measure the
perfection of angels of the outmost heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="35.">35.</span></span>

Because of this distinction an angel of one heaven cannot go among the
angels of another heaven, that is, no one can ascend from a lower heaven
and no one can descend from a higher heaven. One ascending from a lower
heaven is seized with a distress even to anguish, and is unable to see
those who are there, still less to talk with them; while one descending
from a higher heaven is deprived of his wisdom, stammers in his speech,
and is in despair. There were some from the outmost heaven who had not
yet been taught that the interiors of angels are what constitute heaven,
and who believed that they might come into a higher heavenly happiness
by simply gaining access to a heaven where higher angels are. These were
permitted to enter among such angels. But when they were there they
could see no one, however much they searched, although there was a great
multitude present; for the interiors of the newcomers not having been
opened in the same degree as the interiors of the angels there, their
sight was not so opened. Presently they were seized with such anguish of
heart that they scarcely knew whether they were alive or not. Therefore
they hastily betook themselves to the heaven from which they came, glad
to get back among their like, and pledging themselves that they would no
longer covet higher things than were in agreement with their life.
Again, I have seen some let down from a higher heaven; and these were
deprived of their wisdom until they no longer knew what their own heaven
was. It is otherwise when, as is often done, angels are raised up by the
Lord out of a lower heaven into a higher that they may behold its glory;
for then they are prepared beforehand, and are encompassed by
intermediate angels, through whom they have communication with those
they come among. From all this it is plain that the three heavens are
entirely distinct from each other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="36.">36.</span></span>

Those, however, who are in the same heaven can affiliate with any who
are there; but the delights of such affiliation are measured by the
kinships of good they have come into; of which more will be said in the
following chapters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="37.">37.</span></span>

But although the heavens are so distinct that there can be no
companionship between the angels of one heaven and the angels of
another, still the Lord joins all the heavens together by both direct
and mediate influx-direct from Himself into all the heavens, and mediate
from one heaven into another. <span id="fr_40"></span>[37-1](#fn_40.md) He
thus makes the three heavens to be one, and all to be in such connection
from the First to the Last that nothing unconnected is possible.
Whatever is not connected through intermediates with the First can have
no permanent existence, but is dissipated and becomes nothing. <span
id="fr_41"></span>[37-2](#fn_41.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="38.">38.</span></span>

Only he who knows how degrees are related to Divine order can comprehend
how the heavens are distinct, or even what is meant by the internal and
the external man. Most men in the world have no other idea of what is
interior and what is exterior, or of what is higher and what is lower,
than as something continuous, or coherent by continuity, from purer to
grosser. But the relation of what is interior to what is exterior is
discrete, not continuous. Degrees are of two kinds, those that are
continuous and those that are not. Continuous degrees are related like
the degrees of the waning of a light from its bright blaze to darkness,
or like the degrees of the decrease of vision from objects in the light
to those in the shade, or like degrees of purity in the atmosphere from
bottom to top. These degrees are determined by distance. \[2\] On the
other hand, degrees that are not continuous, but discrete, are
distinguished like prior and posterior, like cause and effect, and like
what produces and what is produced. Whoever looks into the matter will
see that in each thing and all things in the whole world, whatever they
are, there are such degrees of producing and compounding, that is, from
one a second, and from that a third, and so on. \[3\] Until one has
acquired for himself a perception of these degrees he cannot possibly
understand the differences between the heavens, nor between the interior
and exterior faculties of man, nor the differences between the spiritual
world and the natural world, nor between the spirit of man and his body.
So neither can he understand the nature and source of correspondences
and representations, or the nature of influx. Sensual men do not
apprehend these differences, for they make increase and decrease, even
according to these degrees, to be continuous, and are therefore unable
to conceive of what is spiritual otherwise than as a purer natural. And
in consequence they remain outside of and a great way off from
intelligence. <span id="fr_42"></span>[38-1](#fn_42.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="39.">39.</span></span>

Finally, a certain arcanum respecting the angels of the three heavens,
which has not hitherto come into any one's mind, because degrees have
not been understood, may be related. In every angel and also in every
man there is an inmost or highest degree, or an inmost or highest
something, into which the Divine of the Lord primarily or proximately
flows, and from which it disposes the other interiors in him that follow
in accordance with the degrees of order. This inmost or highest degree
may be called the entrance of the Lord to the angel or man, and His
veriest dwelling-place in them. It is by virtue of this inmost or
highest that a man is a man, and is distinguished from irrational
animals, for these do not have it. From this it is that man, unlike the
animals, is capable, in respect to all his interiors which pertain to
his mind and disposition, of being raised up by the Lord to Himself, of
believing in the Lord, of being moved by love to the Lord, and thereby
beholding Him, and of receiving intelligence and wisdom, and speaking
from reason. Also, it is by virtue of this that he lives to eternity.
But what is arranged and provided by the Lord in this inmost does not
distinctly flow into the perception of any angel, because it is above
his thought and transcends his wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="40.">40.</span></span>

These now are the general truths respecting the three heavens; but in
what follows each heaven will be particularly treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="41.">41.</span></span>

VI\. THE HEAVENS CONSIST OF INNUMERABLE SOCIETIES. The angels of each
heaven are not together in one place, but are divided into larger and
smaller societies in accordance with the differences of good of love and
of faith in which they are, those who are in like good forming a single
society. Goods in the heavens are in infinite variety, and each angel is
as it were his own good. <span id="fr_43"></span>[41-1](#fn_43.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="42.">42.</span></span>

Moreover, the angelic societies in the heavens are at a distance from
each other as their goods differ in general and in particular. For in
the spiritual world the only ground of distance is difference in the
state of interiors, thus in the heavens difference in the states of
love, those who differ much being far apart, and those who differ but
little being but little apart, and likeness causing them to be
together. <span id="fr_44"></span>[42-1](#fn_44.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="43.">43.</span></span>

All who are in the same society are arranged in like manner in respect
to each other; those who are more perfect, that is, who excel in good,
thus in love, wisdom, and intelligence, being in the middle; those who
are less pre-eminent being round about at a distance in accordance with
the decrease of their perfection. The arrangement is like light
diminishing from the middle to the circumference, those who are in the
middle being in the greatest light, and those towards the circumference
in less and less.

<span class="margnote"><span id="44.">44.</span></span>

Like are drawn spontaneously as it were to their like; for with their
like they are as if with their own and at home, but with others they are
as if with strangers and abroad; also when with their like they are in
their freedom, and consequently in every delight of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="45.">45.</span></span>

All this makes clear that all in the heavens are affiliated by good, and
are distinguished according to the quality of the good. Nevertheless it
is not the angels who thus affiliate themselves, but the Lord, from whom
the good is. The Lord leads them, conjoins and separates them, and
preserves them in freedom proportionate to their good. Thus He holds
everyone in the life of his love and faith, of his intelligence and
wisdom, and the resulting happiness. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[45-1](#fn_45.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="46.">46.</span></span>

Again, all who are in like good, even though they have never seen each
other before, know each other, just as men in the world do their
kinsmen, near relations, and friends; and for the reason that in the
other life there are none but spiritual kinships, relationships, and
friendships, thus such as spring from love and faith. <span
id="fr_46"></span>[46-1](#fn_46.md) This it has sometimes been granted me
to see, when I have been in the spirit, and thus withdrawn from the
body, and in the society of angels. Some of those I then saw seemed as
if I had known them from childhood, but others as if not known at all.
Those whom I seemed to have known from childhood were such as were in a
state similar to that of my spirit; but those who seemed unknown were in
a dissimilar state.

<span class="margnote"><span id="47.">47.</span></span>

All who form the same angelic society resemble each other in countenance
in a general way, but not in particulars. How these general resemblances
are related to differences in particulars can in some measure be seen
from like things in the world. It is well known that with every race
there is a certain general resemblance of face and eyes, by which it is
known and distinguished from all other races. This is still more true of
different families. In the heavens this is much more fully the case,
because there all the interior affections appear in and shine forth from
the face, for there the face is the external and representative form of
those affections. No one there can have any other face than that of his
own affection. It was also shown how this general likeness is varied in
particulars with individuals in the same society. A face like an angel's
appeared to me, and this was varied in accordance with such affections
for good and truth as are in those who belong to a single society. These
changes went on for a long time, and I noticed that the same face in
general continued as a ground work, all besides being what was derived
and produced from that. Thus by means of this face the affections of the
whole society were exhibited, whereby the faces of those in it are
varied. For, as has been said above, the faces of angels are the forms
of their interiors, thus of the affections that belong to their love and
faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="48.">48.</span></span>

From this it also comes to pass that an angel who excels in wisdom
instantly sees the quality of another from his face. In heaven no one
can conceal his interiors by his expression, or feign, or really deceive
and mislead by craft or hypocrisy. There are hypocrites who are experts
in disguising their interiors and fashioning their exteriors into the
form of that good in which those are who belong to a society, and who
thus make themselves appear angels of light; and these sometimes
insinuate themselves into a society; but they cannot stay there long,
for they begin to suffer inward pain and torture, to grow livid in the
face, and to become as it were lifeless. These changes arise from the
contrariety of the life that flows in and affects them. Therefore they
quickly cast themselves down into hell where their like are, and no
longer want to ascend. These are such as are meant by the man found
among the invited guests at the feast not clothed with a wedding
garment, who was cast out into outer darkness Matt. 22:11, seq.).

<span class="margnote"><span id="49.">49.</span></span>

All the societies of heaven have communication with one another, though
not by open interaction; for few go out of their own society into
another, since going out of their own society is like going away from
themselves or from their own life, and passing into another life which
is less congenial. But all the societies communicate by an extension of
the sphere that goes forth from the life of each. This sphere of the
life is the sphere of the affections of love and faith. This sphere
extends itself far and wide into the surrounding societies, and farther
and wider in proportion as the affections are the more interior and
perfect. <span id="fr_47"></span>[49-1](#fn_47.md) In the measure of that
extension do the angels have intelligence and wisdom. Those that are in
the inmost heaven and in the middle of it have extension into the entire
heavens; thus there is a sharing of all in heaven with each one, and of
each one with all. <span id="fr_48"></span>[49-2](#fn_48.md) But this
extension will be considered more fully hereafter, where the form of
heaven in accord with which the angelic societies are arranged, and also
the wisdom and intelligence of angels, will be treated of, for in
accordance with that form all extension of affections and thoughts
proceeds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="50.">50.</span></span>

It has been said above that in the heavens there are larger and smaller
societies. The larger consist of myriads of angels, the smaller of some
thousands, and the least of some hundreds. There are also some that
dwell apart, house by house as it were, and family by family. Although
these live in this scattered way, they are arranged in order like those
who live in societies, the wiser in the middle and the more simple in
the borders. Such are more closely under the Divine auspices of the
Lord, and are the best of the angels.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[1-4](hh01.htm#fr_3.md) The Word is written solely
by correspondences, and for this reason each thing and all things in it
have a spiritual meaning (n. 1404, 1408, 1409, 1540, 1619, 1659, 1709,
1783, 2900, 9086).

<span id="fn_4"></span>[1-5](hh01.htm#fr_4.md) In the Word the sun"
signifies the Lord in respect to love, and in consequence love to the
Lord (n. 1529, 1837, 2441, 2495, 4060, 4696, 7083, 10809).

<span id="fn_5"></span>[1-6](hh01.htm#fr_5.md) In the Word the "moon"
signifies the Lord in respect to faith, and in consequence faith in the
Lord (n. 1529, 1530, 2495, 4060, 4696, 7083).

<span id="fn_6"></span>[1-7](hh01.htm#fr_6.md) In the Word "stars" signify
knowledges of good and truth (n. 2495, 2849,4697).

<span id="fn_7"></span>[1-8](hh01.htm#fr_7.md) "Tribes" signify all truths
and goods in the complex, thus all things of faith and love (n. 3858,
3926, 4060, 6335).

<span id="fn_8"></span>[1-9](hh01.htm#fr_8.md) The coming of the Lord
signifies His presence in the Word, and revelation (n 3900,4060).

<span id="fn_9"></span>[1-10](hh01.htm#fr_9.md) In the Word clouds signify
the Word in the letter or the sense of its letter (n. 4060, 4391, 5922,
6343, 6752, 8106, 8781, 9430, 10551, 10574).

<span id="fn_10"></span>[1-11](hh01.htm#fr_10.md) In the Word "glory"
signifies Divine truth as it is in heaven and as it is in the internal
sense of the Word (n. 4809, 5922, 8267, 8427, 9429, 10574).

<span id="fn_11"></span>[1-12](hh01.htm#fr_11.md) A "trumpet" or "horn"
signifies Divine truth in heaven, and revealed from heaven (n. 8158,
8823, 8915); and "voice" has a like signification (n. 6771, 9926).

<span id="fn_12"></span>[2-1](hh01.htm#fr_12.md) Christians were examined
in the other life in regard to their idea of the one God and it was
found that they held the idea of three Gods (n. 2329, 5256, 10736,
10738, 10821). A Divine trinity in the Lord is acknowledged in heaven
(n. 14, 15, 1729, 2005, 5256, 9303).

<span id="fn_13"></span>[3-1](hh01.htm#fr_13.md) A Divine that cannot be
perceived by any idea cannot be received by faith (n. 4733, 5110, 5663,
6982, 6996, 7004, 7211, 9356, 9359, 9972, 10067, 10267).

<span id="fn_14"></span>[5-1](hh01.htm#fr_14.md) The entire heaven is the
Lord's (n. 2751, 7086). He has all power in the heavens and on the
earths (n. 1607, 10089, 10827). As the Lord rules heaven He rules also
all things that depend thereon, thus all things in the world (n. 2026,
2027, 4523, 4524). The Lord alone has power to remove the hells, to
withhold from evil and hold in good, and thus to save (n. 10019).

<span id="fn_15"></span>[8-1](hh01.htm#fr_15.md) The angels of heaven
acknowledge all good to be from the Lord, and nothing from themselves,
and the Lord dwells in them in His own and not in their own (n. 9338,
10125, 10151, 10157). Therefore in the Word by "angels" something of the
Lord is meant (n. 1925, 2821, 3039, 4085, 8192, 10528). Furthermore,
angels are called "gods" from the reception of the Divine from the Lord
(n. 4295, 4402, 7268, 7873, 8192, 8301). Again, all good that is good,
and all truth that is truth, consequently all peace, love, charity, and
faith, are from the Lord (n. 1614, 2016, 2751, 2882, 2883, 2891, 2892,
2904). Also all wisdom and intelligence (n. 109, 112, 121, 124).

<span id="fn_16"></span>[8-2](hh01.htm#fr_16.md) Those who are in heaven
are said to be in the Lord (n. 3637, 3638).

<span id="fn_17"></span>[9-1](hh01.htm#fr_17.md) Good from the Lord has the
Lord inwardly in it, but good from one's own has not (n. 1802, 3951,
8480).

<span id="fn_18"></span>[13-1](hh01.htm#fr_18.md) In the Word "fire"
signifies heavenly love and infernal love (n. 934, 4906, 5215). "Holy
and heavenly fire" signifies Divine love, and every affection that
belongs to that love (n. 934, 6314, 6832). "Light" from fire signifies
truth going forth from good of love; and light in heaven signifies
Divine truth (n. 3195, 3485, 3636, 3643, 3993, 4302, 4413, 4415, 9548,
9684).

<span id="fn_19"></span>[14-1](hh01.htm#fr_19.md) Love is the fire of life,
and life itself is actually therefrom (n. 4906, 5071, 6032, 6314).

<span id="fn_20"></span>[15-1](hh01.htm#fr_20.md) To love the Lord and the
neighbor is to live according to the Lord's commandments (n. 10143,
10153, 10310, 10578, 10648).

<span id="fn_21"></span>[15-2](hh01.htm#fr_21.md) To love the neighbor is
not to love the person, but to love that in him from which he is what he
is, that is, his truth and good (n. 5028. 10336). Those who love the
person, and not that in him from which he is what he is, love evil and
good alike (n. 3820). Charity is willing truths and being affected by
truths for the sake of truths (n. 3876, 3877). Charity towards the
neighbor is doing what is good, just, and right, in every work and in
every function (n. 8120-8122).

<span id="fn_22"></span>[17-1](hh01.htm#fr_22.md) Angels are forms of love
and charity (n. 3804, 4735, 4797, 4985, 5199, 5530, 9879, 10177).

<span id="fn_23"></span>[17-2](hh01.htm#fr_23.md) A spiritual sphere, which
is a sphere of the life, overflows and pours forth from every man,
spirit, and angel, and encompasses them (n. 4464, 5179, 7454, 8630). It
flows from the life of their affection and consequent thought (n. 2489,
4464, 6206).

<span id="fn_24"></span>[17-3](hh01.htm#fr_24.md) Spirits and angels turn
themselves constantly to their loves, and those in the heavens turn
themselves constantly to the Lord (n. 10130, 10189, 10420, 10702).
Quarters in the other life are to each one in accordance with the
direction of his face, and are thereby determined, otherwise than in the
world (n. 10130, 10189, 10420, 10702).

<span id="fn_25"></span>[18-1](hh01.htm#fr_25.md) Innumerable things are
contained in love, and love gathers to itself all things that are in
harmony with it (n. 2500, 2572, 3078, 3189, 6323, 7490, 7750).

<span id="fn_26"></span>[20-1](hh01.htm#fr_26.md) There is infinite
variety, and nowhere any thing the same as another (n. 7236, 9002). Also
in the heavens there is infinite variety (n. 684, 690, 3744, 5598,
7236). Varieties in heaven are varieties of good (n. 3744, 4005, 7236,
7833, 7836, 9002). All societies in the heavens, and all angels in a
society, are thereby distinguished from each other (n. 690, 3241, 3519,
3804, 3986, 4067, 4149, 4263, 7236, 7833, 7836). Nevertheless they are
all made one by love from the Lord (n. 457, 3986).

<span id="fn_27"></span>[21-1](hh01.htm#fr_27.md) Heaven as a whole is
divided into two kingdoms, a celestial kingdom and a spiritual kingdom
(n. 3887, 4138). The angels of the celestial kingdom receive the Divine
of the lord in their voluntary part, thus more interiorly than the
spiritual angels, who receive it in their intellectual part (n. 5113,
6367, 8521, 9936, 9995. 10124).

<span id="fn_28"></span>[22-1](hh01.htm#fr_28.md) The heavens that
constitute the celestial kingdom are called higher while those that
constitute the spiritual kingdom are called lower (n. 10068).

<span id="fn_29"></span>[22-2](hh01.htm#fr_29.md) Interior things are
portrayed by higher things, and higher things signify interior things
(n. 2148, 3084, 4599, 5146, 8325).

<span id="fn_30"></span>[23-1](hh01.htm#fr_30.md) The good of the celestial
kingdom is good of love to the Lord, and the good of the spiritual
kingdom is good of charity towards the neighbor (n. 3691, 6435, 9468,
9680, 9683, 9780).

<span id="fn_31"></span>[25-1](hh01.htm#fr_31.md) The celestial angels
immeasurably surpass in wisdom the spiritual angels (n. 2718, 9995). The
nature of the distinction between celestial angels and spiritual angels
(n. 2088, 2669, 2708, 2715, 3235, 3240, 4788, 7068, 8521, 9277, 10295).

<span id="fn_32"></span>[25-2](hh01.htm#fr_32.md) The celestial angels do
not reason about truths of faith, because they perceive them in
themselves; but the spiritual angels reason about them whether they are
true or not (n. 202, 337, 597, 607, 784, 1121, 1384, 1898, 1919, 3246,
4448, 7680, 7877, 8780, 9277, 10786).

<span id="fn_33"></span>[26-1](hh01.htm#fr_33.md) The Lord's influx is into
good and through good into truth, and not the reverse; thus into the
will and through that into the understanding, and not the reverse (n.
5482, 5649, 6027, 8685, 8701, 10153).

<span id="fn_34"></span>[26-2](hh01.htm#fr_34.md) The will of man is the
very being \[esse\] of his life, and the receptacle of the good of love,
while his understanding is the outgo \[existere\] of his life therefrom,
and the receptacle of the truth and good of faith (n. 3619, 5002, 9282).
Thus the will's life is the chief life of man, and the life of the
understanding goes forth therefrom (n. 585, 590, 3619, 7342, 8885, 9282,
10076, 10109, 10110). Whatever is received by the will comes to be the
life, and is appropriated to man (n. 3161, 9386, 9393). Man is a man
from his will and his understanding therefrom (n. 8911, 9069, 9071,
10076, 10109, 10110). Moreover, everyone who wills and understands
rightly is loved and valued by others, while he that understands rightly
and does not will rightly is rejected and despised (n. 8911, 10076).
Also, after death man remains such as his will and his understanding
therefrom have been, while the things that pertain to the understanding
and not also to the will then vanish, because they are not in the man
(n. 9069, 9071, 9282, 9386, 10153).

<span id="fn_35"></span>[27-1](hh01.htm#fr_35.md) Between the two kingdoms
there is communication and conjunction by mean's of angelic societies
which are called celestial-spiritual (n. 4047, 6435, 8796, 8802). The
influx of the Lord through the celestial kingdom into the spiritual (n.
3969, 6366).

<span id="fn_36"></span>[30-1](hh01.htm#fr_36.md) All things of Divine
order are brought together in man, and by creation man is Divine order
in form (n. 3628, 4219, 4220, 4223, 4523, 4524, 5114, 5168, 6013, 6057,
6605, 6626, 9706, 10156, 10472). In man the internal man was formed
after the image of heaven, and the external after the image of the
world, and this is why man was called by the ancients a microcosm (n.
3628, 4523, 5115, 6013, 6057, 9279, 9706, 10156, 10472). Thus man is
respect to his interiors is by creation a heaven in least form after the
image of the greatest; and such also man becomes when he has been
created anew or regenerated by the Lord (n. 911, 1900, 1928, 3624-3631,
3634, 3884, 4041, 4279, 4523, 4524, 4625, 6013, 6057, 9279, 9632).

<span id="fn_37"></span>[31-1](hh01.htm#fr_37.md) There are three heavens,
inmost, middle, and outmost, or third, second, and first (n. 684 9594,
10270). Goods therein also follow in triple order (n. 4938, 4939, 9992,
10005, 10017). The good of the inmost or third heaven is called
celestial, the good of the middle or second is called spiritual, and the
good of the outmost or first, spiritual-natural (n. 4279, 4286, 4938,
4939, 9992, 10005, 10017, 10068).

<span id="fn_38"></span>[33-1](hh01.htm#fr_38.md) There are as many degrees
of life in man as there are heavens, and these are opened after death in
accordance with his life (n. 3747, 9594). Heaven is in man (n. 3884).
Therefore he that has received heaven into himself in the world, comes
into heaven after death in. 10717).

<span id="fn_39"></span>[34-1](hh01.htm#fr_39.md) Interiors are more
perfect because nearer to the Divine (n. 3405, 5146,5147). In the
internal there are thousands and thousands of things that appear in the
external as one general thing (n. 5707). As far as man is raised from
externals towards interiors, so far he comes into light and thus into
intelligence and the elevation is like rising out of a cloud into
clearness (n. 4598, 6183, 6313).

<span id="fn_40"></span>[37-1](hh01.htm#fr_40.md) Influx from the Lord is
direct from Himself and also mediate through on heaven into another, and
in like manner into man's interiors (n. 6063, 6307, 6472, 9682, 9683).
Direct influx of the Divine from the Lord (n. 6058, 6474-6478, 8717,
8728). Mediate influx through the spiritual world into the natural world
(n. 4067, 6982, 6985, 6996).

<span id="fn_41"></span>[37-2](hh01.htm#fr_41.md) All things spring from
things prior to themselves, thus from a First, and in like inner
subsist, because subsistence is unceasing springing forth; therefore
nothing unconnected is possible (n. 3626-3628, 3648, 4523, 4524, 6040,
6056).

<span id="fn_42"></span>[38-1](hh01.htm#fr_42.md) Things interior and
things exterior are not continuous but distinct and discrete according
to degrees, and each degree has its bounds (n. 3691, 5114, 5145, 8603,
10099). One thing is formed from another, and the things so formed are
not continuously purer and grosser (n. 6326, 6465). Until the difference
between what is interior and what is exterior according to such degrees
is perceived, neither the internal and external man nor the interior and
exterior heavens can be clearly understood (n. 5146, 6465, 10099,
10181).

<span id="fn_43"></span>[41-1](hh01.htm#fr_43.md) There is infinite
variety, and never any thing the same with any other (n. 7236, 9002). So
in the heavens there is infinite variety (n. 684, 690, 3744, 5598,
7236). Varieties in the heavens, which are infinite, are varieties of
good (n. 3744, 4005, 7236, 7833, 7836, 9002). These varieties exist
through truths, which are manifold from which is each one's good (n.
3470, 3804, 4149, 6917, 7236). It is because of this that all the
societies in the heavens, and all angels in a society, are distinct from
each other (n. 690, 3241, 3519, 3804, 3986, 4067, 4149, 4263, 7236,
7833, 836). Nevertheless they all make one through love from the Lord
(n. 457, 3986).

<span id="fn_44"></span>[42-1](hh01.htm#fr_44.md) All the societies of
heaven have a constant position in accordance with the differences of
their state of life, thus in accordance with the differences of love and
faith (n. 1274, 3638, 3639). Wonderful things in the other life, that
is, in the spiritual world, respecting distance, situation, place space
and time (n. 1273-1277).

<span id="fn_45"></span>[45-1](hh01.htm#fr_45.md) All freedom pertains to
love and affection, since what a man loves, that he does freely (n.
2870, 3158, 8987, 8990, 9555, 9591). Because freedom pertains to love
everyone's life and delight is therefrom (n. 2873). Nothing appears as
one's own, except what is from his freedom (n. 2880). The veriest
freedom is to be led by the Lord, because one is thus led by the love of
good and truth (n. 892, 905, 2872, 2886, 2890-2892, 9096, 9586-9591).

<span id="fn_46"></span>[46-1](hh01.htm#fr_46.md) All nearness,
relationship, connections, and as it were ties of blood, in heaven are
from good and in accordance with its agreements and differences (n. 685,
917, 1394, 2739, 3612, 3815, 4121).

<span id="fn_47"></span>[49-1](hh01.htm#fr_47.md) A spiritual sphere, which
is the sphere of life flows out from every man, spirit, and angel, and
encompasses them (n. 4464, 5179, 7454, 5630). It flows forth from the
life of their affection and thought (n. 2459, 4464. 6206). These spheres
extend themselves far into angelic societies in accordance with the
quality and quantity of their good (n. 6598-6612, 8063, 5794, 5797).

<span id="fn_48"></span>[49-2](hh01.htm#fr_48.md) In the heavens a sharing
of all goods is possible because heavenly love shares with another
everything that is its own (n. 549, 550, 1390, 1391, 1399, 10130,
10723).
