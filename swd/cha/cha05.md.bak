### Charity

<span class="margnote"><span id="201.">201.</span></span>

As regards the FIRST, No one can have charity except from the Lord.
Here, as in what follows, we name only the Lord, because the Lord is the
only God; for He is God of heaven and earth, as He himself teaches. .
. <span id="fr_28"></span>[201-1](#fn_28.md) He and the Father are one,
like soul and body, as He also teaches . . . .  <span
id="fr_29"></span>[201-2](#fn_29.md) He and the Spirit are the same, like
the Divine in Him, and the Divine from Him. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[201-3](#fn_30.md) Thus He Himself is the One Only God;
and thus the Divine Trinity is in His Person, and is named the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Now, because the whole Church, and all
religion, is founded upon the idea of God, and upon the idea that God is
one, and because this idea exists to no purpose unless God is one in
Essence and in Person, and unless this unity of the trinity and trinity
of the unity is in the Lord alone, therefore here at the very beginning,
and afterwards in what follows, we name the Lord only. See, besides, THE
DOCTRINE OF THE NEW JERUSALEM CONCERNING THE LORD, from beginning to
end; also ANGELIC WISDOM CONCERNING THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE, nos. \[157,
262, 263\]. <span id="fr_31"></span>[201-4](#fn_31.md) The reason no one
can have charity except from the Lord, is that by charity is meant every
good a man does to others; and the good a man does to others is indeed
good for those to whom it is done, but it is not good him by whom is
done, unless it is from God. For no good that is in itself a good, and
is called a good of charity, and in its essence is a spiritual good, can
flow forth from man, but from the Lord only. For, in order that a good
of charity, or a spiritual good, may exist, the Lord must be in the
Good, must indeed be the Good; for it proceeds from Him, and what
proceeds from anyone derives its essence from Him; for He Himself is in
what is His Own. If, therefore, the Lord were not the Good a man does to
the neighbour, or, what is the same, unless the good a man does to the
neighbour were from the Lord, it would not have an essence of good in
it, but an essence of evil, for the man would be in it; and a man in
himself and in his proprium is nothing but evil. This evil must first be
removed, in order that the good proceeding from the man may not be the
man's but the Lord's. A man is only a recipient of life: he is not life
in himself, for, if he were life in himself, he would be God; and
therefore, man is only a recipient of good, for good is of life, because
love and wisdom are life, and good is of love, and truth is of wisdom.
This life cannot be made over to man as his own; for man is finite and
created, and the Lord cannot create and finite Himself in another. In
that case, He Himself would no longer exist, and then the entire human
race, and each individual by himself, would be God. To think this is not
only irrational, but abominable also. In the spiritual world, such an
idea about God and man stinks like a corpse. From all this it can be
taken as established that there cannot be any good, which is in itself
good, and is termed a good of charity, from man; it must be from the
Lord, who alone is Good itself, thus is in Himself Good. This, the Lord
does, indeed, produce from Himself, but through man. There is no subject
through which the Lord produces good from Himself, other than man.
Nevertheless the Lord has given man the faculty of feeling it in
himself, indeed, as from himself, and therefore as his own, to the end
that he may do it. For if he felt it was not from himself, but from the
Lord, he would not do it; for he would then believe himself to be not a
man, not even alive, and at length scarcely otherwise than like an
automaton. And, from experience, I know that a man would rather die,
than live perceptibly from another in himself. Indeed, unless a man felt
the good he does as being from himself, the good would not remain in him
either, but would flow through, like water through a water-skin all full
of holes; nor could he then be formed for heaven, that is, reformed and
regenerated, and so, being saved, live to eternity. Lest, however, a
man, owing to this appearance, should attribute to himself the good or
charity he does to the neighbour, and thereby appropriate evil to
himself, in place of good, through believing he lives from himself, and
consequently does the good from himself, thus attributing to himself
what is the Lord's, it has pleased the Lord to reveal this in His Word,
and to teach it. For the Lord says, "He that abideth in Me, and I in
him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without Me ye can do
nothing" (John xv. 5, and elsewhere).

<span class="margnote"><span id="202.">202.</span></span>

2\. No one can have charity from the Lord unless he shuns evils as sins.
By charity, here as above, is meant the good a man does to the
neighbour. Everyone is able to do good to the neighbour, an evil man as
well as a good man; but no one is able to do it by reason of good in
himself, except from the Lord, and unless he shuns evils as sins. That
no one is able to do good to the neighbour by reason of good in himself,
except from the Lord, has been shown just above. The reason no one is
able to do it unless he shuns evils as sins, is that the Lord cannot
inflow into anyone with good so that it is received, unless the evils in
him are removed; for evils do not receive good, they reject it. For it
is the same with a man who is in evils, as it is with devils in hell.
With devils, the Lord inflows with good, in just the same way as He
inflows with angels in heaven; but the devils do not receive it, they
turn the good into evil, and the truth into falsity, for their life's
form is such, and everything that inflows is turned into a likeness of
the form; just as the pure heat of the sun is turned into putrid and
noisome smells when it inflows into urine that has been stagnant, into
dung, and into corpses. In the same way, the pure light of the sun,
inflowing into objects in which all things are disordered, is turned
into hideous colours. It is the same with heavenly heat, which is Divine
Good, and heavenly light, which is Divine Truth, in the case of a man
whose life's form is inverted, and so is opposed to the heavenly form.
From this it is evident that, as long as a man is not shunning evils as
sins, he cannot be doing otherwise than loving evils; and the love with
everyone makes the form of his life. It is comparatively like a bad
tree, which receives heat and light from the sun just as a good tree
does, but still can only produce fruit that is a likeness of its own
form, and therefore bad. It is, too, comparatively like malignant and
noxious plants, which derive from the sun's heat and light the life by
which they grow, just the same as good and useful plants, and yet can
produce nothing but what agrees with their own form. Every man is the
form of his own love. Nothing else forms a man in respect of his
spiritual part, but his love. If he loves evils, he becomes a form of
evil, which is an infernal form; whereas if he loves goods, he becomes a
form of good, which is a heavenly form. From this it is evident that
unless a man shuns evils as sins, the form of his mind \[mens\] becomes,
in respect of its spiritual things, an infernal form, which in itself
does not receive any good from the Lord, and consequently does not bring
forth any good that is in itself good. The Lord can bring forth good
through any man, and He can turn the evil that an evil man brings forth
into good. He can rouse an evil man to do good from selfish and worldly
considerations; but in that case the Lord does not inflow into the evil
of the man himself, but round about it into the surrounding things in
him, thus into his external, by means of which the man wants to appear
like a good man. That good, therefore, is good so far as the surface
goes, but intrinsically is evil. With hypocrites, it is like gilded
dung, so that scarcely anyone thinks it to be other than pure gold;
nevertheless, if it is brought near to a sensitive nostril, the smell of
the dung in it is perceived. These things, however, are fully shown in
THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM, in the section where it is
shown that, in so far as a man shuns evils as sins, he does goods, not
from himself, but from the Lord, nos. 18-31; to which I will add only
this, that every one can see this from merely general influx out of
heaven. Take anyone you like, servant, farmer, workman, ship-captain, or
merchant, provided only he has something rational, and tell him only
that he who hates evil does good, and all of them will see it clearly.
And, inasmuch as they know that all good is from God, tell them that, in
so far is a man hates evil because it is against God, he does good from
God; and they will see it. But say the same things to someone who has
confirmed himself in faith alone, and accordingly at the same time in
the idea that no one can do good from himself, and he will not see it;
for false things have closed his rational sight or understanding, but
not that of the others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="203.">203.</span></span>

3\. A man ought to shun evils as sins, as from himself, while doing so
nevertheless from the Lord. Who, having read the Word, and having some
religion, does not know that evils are sins? This is what the Word
teaches from beginning to end, and this is the whole of religion. Evils
are termed sins on account of their being contrary to the Word, and to
religion. Who does not know that no one can shun evils as sins unless he
does so as from himself? Who can repent any other way? Does not a man
say within himself, "I won't do this. I will give up doing this. Indeed,
when it recurs, I will fight against it and overcome it"? No one ever
speaks in this is way within himself, however, unless he believes in
God. He who does not believe in God does not reckon an evil as a sin,
and so does not fight against it, but rather in favour of it. But he who
believes in God says also within himself, "With God's help I will
overcome it"; and so he makes supplication, and gets help. This is not
denied to anyone, but is given to him, because the Lord, from His Divine
Love, is in the continual endeavour to reform and regenerate man, and so
to purify him from evils, and this constant endeavour of the Lord comes
into effect, when the man truly desires it, and makes an effort for it.
In this and no other way does a man receive the power to resist evils
and to fight against them. Before this, he does not receive it, he
rejects it. This, then, is shunning evils as sins as from oneself, while
doing so nevertheless from the Lord. But on this subject, THE DOCTRINE
OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM, nos. 101-107, may also be seen; to which
I will add this: Say to a man of sound reason, "Only believe that
Christ, the Son of God, redeemed you from hell, and thus from all evil,
and beseech God the Father to forgive you your sins on that account, and
He will do so; and in that case there will be no need for you, as of
yourself, to shun evils as sins. You can't do anything of yourself, can
you? What is 'as of yourself,' then?" And picking up a pebble, or a
little bit of wood, tell him, "Are you any more able to do anything
towards justification and salvation than this pebble, or little bit of
wood?" Then the man of some reason will reply, "I know I can do nothing
of myself, but all the same I should repent of evils. This, the Lord
Himself taught: His apostles taught it: Paul taught it: the Word teaches
it, and so does all Religion. When I practise repentance, shall I not be
doing something as of myself?" Suppose you then say, "What will you be
doing, seeing you can do nothing? Do it if you like: I repent through
faith, and faith saves without works." But the man of sound reason will
reply, "You are mistaken, Sir. The Lord taught that I am both to do and
to believe. For you, let it be faith; for me there shall be faith and
works together. I know that after death a man will have to render an
account of his works, and that everyone's believing is according to his
doing."

<span class="margnote"><span id="204.">204.</span></span>

4\. In so far as anyone does not shun evils as sins, he remains in them.
Man was created into the image and likeness of God, and made so that he
might be a recipient of the Lord's love and wisdom. But, because he did
not want to be a recipient, but wanted to be actual love and wisdom, and
thus like God, he consequently inverted his form, and so turned away his
affections and thoughts from the Lord to himself, and so began to love,
even to worship, himself more than the Lord. In this way he estranged
himself from the Lord, and looked backwards away from Him, thereby
perverting the image and likeness of God in himself, and making it into
an image and likeness of hell. This is signified by his eating of the
tree of the knowledge of good and evil. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[204-1](#fn_32.md) By the serpent which he obeyed is
signified the sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural man, and its
lust. The sensual, because it exists in the world, and admits therefrom
the objects it desires, loves the things of the world; and, if it is
allowed to rule, it draws the mind \[mens\] away from the objects of
heaven, which are goods of love and truths of wisdom, in themselves
Divine. This is the origin of man being, in respect of his proprium,
nothing but evil, and of his being born into it from parents. But means
have been provided by the Lord, so that he may not perish on account of
this; and these are, to look to the Lord and acknowledge that every good
of love and every truth of wisdom is from Him, and nothing from man
himself. In this way man inverts his form, turning away from himself and
turning round to the Lord; thus he returns to the state into which he
was created, which was, as has been said, that he might be a recipient
of good and truth from the Lord, not from himself at all. Man's proprium
having, by this inversion, become evil only, there is the other means of
recovering the image of God, shunning evils as sins. For if a man does
not shun evils as sins, but only shuns them as hurtful, he is still not
looking to the Lord, but to himself, and so continues in a perverted
state. When, however, he shuns evils as sins, he is also shunning them
because they are against the Lord and contrary to His Divine laws; and
then he beseeches the Lord for help and for power to resist them; and
this power, when besought, is never denied. It is by these two means
that a man is purified from his innate evils. Consequently, if he does
not adopt these two means, he cannot but remain such as he was born. He
cannot be purified from evils if he only looks to God and prays; for in
that case he believes, after having prayed, either that he is entirely
without sins, or that they have been remitted, by which he understands
that they have been taken away. But in that case he still remains in
them; and to remain in them is to increase them; for they are like a
disease that eats away everything round about it and brings death. Nor
are evils removed by only shunning them; for in that case the man is
looking to himself, and he thereby strengthens the origin of evil, which
was, that he turned himself backwards, away from the Lord, and round
towards himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="205.">205.</span></span>

5\. In so far as anyone does not recognize and know what sins are, he
sees no otherwise than he is without sin. Every man loves his proprium,
both the voluntary proprium and the intellectual. The voluntary proprium
is evil, and the intellectual proprium is falsity from that evil, thus
it is the falsity of evil. And because every man loves his proprium, he
is thus loving the evil and its falsity; and, because everything that is
loved is also delightful, therefore he knows no otherwise than that the
evil he has is good, and that its falsity is truth - for that which is
said to be good is all that which is delightful. From these things it
can be seen at the outset that, if a man does not recognize and know
what sins are, to that extent he sees no otherwise than that he is
without sin. But, inasmuch as a man loves his own evil and its falsity,
because he loves his proprium, he is not able from himself to know which
thing is evil, and what thing is falsity from it; he has to see it from
some other source. He must see it from the precepts of religion, all of
which have reference to the ten precepts of the Decalogue. If at heart
he rejects these precepts, he cannot by any means see otherwise than
that he is without sin; and in that case, having been initiated from
childhood into the worship of God, and being aware from the Church's
teaching that he is a sinner from his very origin and subsequent birth,
he sets about confessing that he is a sinner; but nevertheless, being
unaware of what sin is, he believes all the time that he is not a
sinner. I have heard people declaring that they were sinners, that they
were in sins of every kind from conception and birth, that, from the
head to the sole of the foot, there was no soundness in them, and more
things of the same kind; but, because they did not know what sin is,
they did not know that the love of self, and arrogance, are the heads of
all sins. They did not know that bearing hatred and taking revenge just
because one is not honoured and worshipped as a demigod, is a sin, nor
that slandering the neighbour out of enmity and thus bearing false
witness against him, is a sin; nor that deceiving anyone by word or
deed, is a sin; that despising another in comparison with oneself,
envying him his goods, being covetous of them, are sins. They did not
know, either, that claiming merit for performing the various acts of
worship towards God, in matters both of faith and of charity, is a sin;
besides innumerable other things. I have heard them say that they did
not know such things were sins; nor anything, indeed, no matter what the
nature of it, that one thinks but does not say, or wills but does not
do. On account of this ignorance one of them said he did not know he was
a sinner - "and if I am," he said, "I am purified from them when I have
said this prayer, 'I know not my sins, O God, take them away.'" But when
the same person examined himself, which took place in the world of
spirits, he noticed that his sins were so numerous that he could not
tell them all. He saw, too, that he could, if he wanted to, recognize
and know them. He said, however, that he did not want to, as he would
then have to abstain from thinking and willing them, to do which would
conflict with the delight of his life. From these things it is now
evident that, in so far as any one does not recognize and know what sins
are, he sees no otherwise than that he is without sin.

<span class="margnote"><span id="206.">206.</span></span>

6\. In so far as anyone recognizes and knows what sins are, he can see
them in himself, confess them before the Lord, and repent of them. This
follows as a result of all that has now been said. Therefore, in order
that a man may see what sins are, the "first" of the Word was the
Decalogue. For that reason also the Decalogue is a complex of all things
of the Word. That is why it is called the Ten Words, the Ten Words
signifying all truths in the complex. For the same reason, too, there
are similar precepts among all nations in the universe with whom there
is religion. Moreover, the man who knows that they are Divine laws, and
that consequently anyone acting contrary to them is acting against God,
or sinning, can receive Divine influx, and with that, too, a will or
effort as of himself, that he would like to give up doing them and
repent. The confession of one's sins before the Lord brings about
conjunction with Him, and a reception of influx from Him; and then the
Lord does it, while giving to the man to do it all the time as of
himself. Otherwise the man would not do it. The Lord then operates
through his inmost things right down to the outermost, and removes the
lustings that are the roots of evil. This it is impossible for the man
himself to do of himself. Of himself man acts upon the outermost things
only, whereas it is the inmost things that make these. Therefore, if a
man of himself were to remove the outermost things, the lustings would
still remain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="207.">207.</span></span>

7\. Good before repentance is not good, nor, before repentance, is
charity charity. Before repentance a man is in evil; he is evil only,
for he is a form of evil and an image of hell. By repentance, however,
the evil is removed and good is implanted. From which it follows that
the good before repentance is not good. Before repentance the good is
not done from the Lord, but from the man; and therefore it has not an
essence of good but an essence of evil within it, however much in its
form it appears outwardly as good. This is not recognized in the world,
but it is after death, manifestly. It is heard in the very tone of his
speech, and more, which evil there is in it, whether there is
deceitfulness, enviousness, vaingloriousness, haughtiness,
blasphemousness, or what is hypocritical, or even a desire for reward.
All the words of his speech derive their tone from the evil that is in
it and regards only itself. After repentance, however, the good is quite
a different thing. It is a full good, open from the Lord Himself. It is
lovely, innocent, pleasing, heavenly. There is the Lord and heaven in
it, there is good itself in it. It is alive; it is formed out of truths
though being from good, in good, and towards good; it is nothing else
but some use to the neighbour; and hence it is serving. With every
breath it puts away itself and its proprium, thus putting away evil. Its
form is like the form of a lovely and beautifully coloured flower,
shining out brilliantly under the sun's rays. Consequently, too, in the
case of those who are in good, they are forms that can never be
comprehended by the natural man: <span id="fr_33"></span>[207-1](#fn_33.md)
they cannot be depicted, nor can they be described: the forms they have
are forms of good. It is rightly said that they are forms of good; yet
the form itself consists of truths, while its life is the good of love;
for the good sets the truths into a form suited to itself, and makes
every one of its truths living. This is what good after repentance is
like.

<span class="margnote"><span id="208.">208.</span></span>

8\. Consequently, the "first" of charity is to look to the Lord and shun
evils as sins, which is done by repentance. Who does not see that before
a man can do good that is good, he must be cleansed from his evils? Does
not a cup have to be cleansed? And if it is not cleansed, does not the
wine get a taste from its uncleanness? And does not a dish have to be
cleansed before food is put on it? For if the inside of the dish is all
unclean, will not the food excite aversion? How can anything pure inflow
from heaven into a man, when he is wholly impure and unclean? Must not
the impure and unclean things be removed first? If you let your bedroom
get filled with excreta, would not the whole house have an offensive
smell? Could anyone go into it? Would not anyone going in say, "I
can't," and would he not turn away from the house, saying, "It's only
fit for swine"? Consequently, before the Lord can inflow with good, evil
must be removed; for influx before that is dangerous, as the good is
turned into evil and increases it. The first thing, therefore, is to
remove evil, and afterwards to inflow with good, and bring it into
operation by means of the man. Anyone attempting to do good from the
Lord, before evil has been removed by repentance, or without shunning
evils as sins, is attempting what is impossible, and such things as may
make him worse, inasmuch as, in the case of a wicked man, the good is
turned into evil, and in that way it is profaned. That evil must be
removed first, is clearly evident from the precepts of the Decalogue.
Who is loving a person, when he wants to kill him, or hates him? Who is
loving the neighbour, when he commits whoredom with someone else's wife?
Who is loving the neighbour, when he defrauds him? Who is loving the
neighbour, when he slanders him? Who is loving the neighbour, when he
covets what belongs to him? Those evils, therefore, must first be
removed; and in the measure that they are being removed, to that extent
the neighbour is being loved. Paul speaks of these things thus: . .
. <span id="fr_34"></span>[208-1](#fn_34.md) But people ask whether love
towards the neighbour should be first, or whether shunning those evils
should be first. Everyone can see that shunning those evils should be
first, inasmuch as a man is born into evil. Is it not necessary then for
him to repent?

<span class="margnote"><span id="209.">209.</span></span>

II THE "SECOND" OF CHARITY IS TO DO GOOD TO THE NEIGHBOUR. Isaiah,
chapter i.; also concerning the cup and dish that are to be cleansed
inside first. <span id="fr_35"></span>[209-1](#fn_35.md) If this cleansing
is not done, they still appear good outwardly. This is Pharisaic or
hypocritical good, or something natural in which there is nothing
spiritual, thus it is spurious good; and if done for the sake of
salvation, it is good done for reward. But these things are to be
illustrated in this order: (1) Not wishing to do evil to the neighbour,
is loving him. (2) Wishing to do good to the neighbour, is loving him.
(3) In so far as a man does not wish to do evil to the neighbour, he
wishes to do him good from charity; but not the reverse. (4) From this
it follows, that the "first" of charity is to look to the Lord and shun
evils as sins; and that the "second" of charity is to do good to the
neighbour.

<span class="margnote"><span id="210.">210.</span></span>

1\. Not wishing to do evil to the neighbour, is loving him. For no one
who loves another, does evil to him. Paul, too, says that he who loves
the neighbour keeps the precepts of the Decalogue; he does not wish to
kill; he does not wish to commit whoredom with someone else's wife; he
does not wish to steal; he does not bear false witness; "therefore, he
says," fulfilling the law is what charity is." <span
id="fr_36"></span>[210-1](#fn_36.md) But, people ask, which is first, and
which comes after? Whether loving the neighbour is first, and from that
love not doing those evils - or whether removing them from oneself is
first, and in that way loving the neighbour? It is evident enough that
he who loves the neighbour does not do those evils. But people ask, how
is anyone able to love the neighbour? Is he able to do so before he
shuns those evils, and fights against them? It appears as if this love
itself fights and so it does, though not before the man is in it. But,
that he cannot come into that love, unless he first removes those evils,
can be taken as established from the fact that every man by birth is in
evils of every kind, that he lusts only after what is evil, and that, if
he does not repent of them, he remains in them. Consequently those evils
stand in the way of his being able to love the neighbour from that
spiritual love. And Paul, therefore, says also, that the flesh is
against the spirit, and that the flesh with its lusting must be
crucified, <span id="fr_37"></span>[210-2](#fn_37.md) and that thus a man
becomes spiritual, and a new creature. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[210-3](#fn_38.md) From this it may be seen that, in so
far as a man crucifies the flesh, he lives in the spirit. Accordingly,
man being such by birth, it follows that his spirit cannot love the
neighbour unless he crucifies his flesh, which is done by repentance;
and that, in so far as he does this, he loves the neighbour from the
spirit, that is, inwardly; and that loving the neighbour from the heart,
previous to this, is against man's nature. A belief has gathered
strength in Christendom, that he who has faith loves the neighbour; but
this belief is erroneous. No one can have a faith that has anything
living in it, unless he shuns evils as sins, indeed, he has it to the
extent that he shuns them. From these things it is now evident that the
"first" of charity is not to do evil to the neighbour; for not doing
evil to the neighbour is fighting against the evils in oneself, and
repenting of them; and that the "second" of charity is to do good to the
neighbour. It is possible for anyone, from the principle that it is
Christian not to do evil to the neighbour, actually not to do it; but he
who, from that principle alone, does not do evil to the neighbour, and
does good to him, is still not loving him. His not doing evil to him is
out of obedience to Divine law, not from the affection of love towards
the neighbour. No one has any knowledge of this affection: he, however,
who shuns evils as sins, that is, who does not love evils, comes into
the affection of that love. Not doing evil but doing good from obedience
is one thing, and not doing evil but good to the neighbour from an
affection of love towards him is another. The difference is like that
between the heat and light by night from the moon and stars, and the
heat and light by day from the sun. In the obedience there is not any of
the heat of that love, nor any of its light; but in the affection there
is; for the of love is heat. Consequently, they who have done good from
obedience are in the lowest regions of heaven, and in a light and heat
like that, of the moon. Indeed, the light of their understanding is in
the shade: they do not see any spiritual truths in light. The
distinction between them, moreover, is that those who do good from
obedience are doing it from fear of punishment, and for the same reason
also they abstain from doing evil; whereas those who do good from
affection are not doing it from fear of punishment; and, further, those
who do good from obedience are natural, while those who do it from
affection are spiritual. Again, those who do good from obedience are
those who are being reformed - this, moreover, comes first; <span
id="fr_39"></span>[210-4](#fn_39.md) whereas those who do good from
affection are being regenerated - this comes next in order. All who have
been under the belief that man is saved by faith alone, if they are
living in a Christian manner, confessing they are sinners, but without
having examined themselves, do good from obedience, not from affection;
indeed, they have no knowledge at all of faith, or of love, or of God,
except what they hear from a preacher: they do good deeds, nevertheless.

<span class="margnote"><span id="211.">211.</span></span>

The affection itself of love is like a flame, from which there is light
in truths. The reason for this is that the Lord inflows into a man's
affection, and gives light. Moreover, love, in the spiritual world,
appears from afar as a flame. Sometimes what look like flames descend
from heaven, and these flames are affections of good and truth so
appearing. It is like someone doing homage to a king, a governor, or a
person in authority, in accordance with the rules of rank, and thus
outwardly loving him, without, however, inwardly loving him. He loves
him because he sees in him . . .

<span class="margnote"><span id="212.">212.</span></span>

XII WHERE THERE IS NO TRUTH OF FAITH, THE CHURCH DOES NOT EXIST; AND
WHERE THERE IS NO GOOD OF LIFE, RELIGION DOES NOT EXIST. The Church and
religion make one, like truth and good. And because truth is of faith
and good is of charity, they make one as faith and charity do; and, in
order that it may be still more clearly understood, they make one as do
the understanding and the will. It is well known that it is possible for
a man to understand well and all the while not will well, and to
understand truths and thence give utterance to them, and yet not from
willing them do them. But when he wills as he understands, and does as
he says, then the will and the understanding with him make one. It is
similar in the case of the Church and religion. The Church is a Church
from its doctrine; and religion is religion from a life in accordance
with doctrine. And the doctrine ought to be composed of truths, and the
life ought to be made up of goods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="213.">213.</span></span>

But, in order that these things may come into a clearer light, they must
be explained in the following order: (1) All the truths of faith in the
Church are from the Word. (2) The truths of faith that are from the Word
teach what is to be believed and what is to be done, so that a man's lot
may be eternal life. (3) It is said "the Church" on account of doctrine,
and "religion" on account of a life in accordance therewith. (4) With
those who, by both doctrine and life, are in faith separate from
charity, there is neither the Church nor religion.

IV THE NEIGHBOUR IS TO BE LOVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS SPIRITUAL GOOD,
AND HIS MORAL, CIVIL, AND NATURAL GOOD THEREFROM; CONSEQUENTLY IT IS
GOOD THAT, IN A SPIRITUAL SENSE, IS THE NEIGHBOUR TO BE LOVED. (1) A man
is not a man by reason of his face and body, but by reason of the good
of his will. (2) When the good of a man's will is loved, the man himself
is being loved. (3) A man is a man by reason of his spiritual good, and
not by reason of his moral, civil, and natural good separate from
spiritual good. (4) Such as a man's spiritual good is, such is his
moral, civil, and natural good; because these three goods derive their
life solely from spiritual good. (5) Consequently, it is good that, in a
spiritual sense, is the neighbour to be loved. OBS. - Spiritual good is
the good of charity, thus, the Lord, heaven, and the Church with him;
for such is the man in the goods derived from it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="215.">215.</span></span>

III IN A NATURAL SENSE, THE NEIGHBOUR WHO IS TO BE LOVED IS A
FELLOW-CITIZEN, ALSO A SOCIETY, SMALL OR LARGE, ALSO ONE'S COUNTRY, ALSO
THE HUMAN RACE.

from obedience who take the lead in benefactions, such as giving to the
poor, helping the needy, and endowing places of worship and hospitals;
and they cannot but think that they merit reward in doing these things.
Nor do they understand the Word as meaning anything else, where it is
said that they shall have their reward. Nor do they know that the
affection itself of good, with its delights, is the reward.
