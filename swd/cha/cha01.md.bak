### Charity

<span class="margnote"><span id="1.">1.</span></span>

I THE "FIRST" OF CHARITY IS TO LOOK TO THE LORD AND SHUN EVILS BECAUSE
THEY ARE SINS; THIS IS DONE BY REPENTANCE. To be expounded in this
order: (1) In so far as anyone does not shun evils because they are
sins, he remains in them. (2) In so far as anyone does not recognize and
know what are sins, he does not see otherwise than that he is without
sin. (3) In so far as anyone recognizes and knows what are sins, he can
see them in himself, confess them before the Lord. and repent of them.
(4) Before repentance, good is spurious good. It is the same with
charity, because good is of charity. (5) Consequently the "first" of
charity is to look to the Lord and shun evils because they are sins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2.">2.</span></span>

1\. In so far as anyone does not look to the Lord and shun evils because
they are sins, he remains in them. Man is born into evils of every kind.
His will, which is his proprium, <span id="fr_0"></span>[2-1](#fn_0.md) is
nothing but evil. Unless, therefore, a man is reformed and regenerated,
he not only remains just as he was born, but becomes even worse, because
he adds actual evils himself to those hereditarily acquired. A man
remains such if he does not shun evils as sins. Shunning them as sins is
shunning them as diabolical and hellish, and thus deadly, and because
accordingly there is eternal damnation in them. If a man so regards
them, then he believes that there is a hell and a heaven; he also
believes that the Lord can remove evils, if he, too, as from himself,
makes an effort to remove them. But the things which are shown on this
subject in THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM, nos. 108-113, may
be seen, to which I will add this: All evils are innately delightful,
because man is born into the love of self, and that love delights in all
the things that are of his proprium, that is, the things that he wills
and thinks. Unless these inbred delights are subdued, everyone remains
in them until death; and they are not subdued unless they are regarded
as sweet poisons which kill, or as flowers beautiful in appearance but
inwardly toxic, that is, unless the delights of the evils are regarded
as being fatal, and this until they become undelightful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3.">3.</span></span>

2\. In so far as anyone does not recognize and know what are sins, he
does not see otherwise than that he is without sin. Because of the Word,
he knows that he is a sinner, in evils from head to foot, yet he does
not really know, because he does not see any sin in himself.
Consequently he prays with a ringing voice as it were, he confesses with
a ringing voice as it were, and yet inmostly in himself he believes that
he is not a sinner. This belief is made evident in the other life; for
then he says, "I am pure, I am clean, I am guiltless"; nevertheless,
when he is examined, he is impure, unclean, indeed even carrion. It is
as if the skin were outwardly clear and soft, \[but\] the inner parts
from the heart itself were diseased; or as if a liquid were, on the
surface, like water, but in its depths putrid from stagnation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4.">4.</span></span>

3\. In so far as anyone recognizes and knows what are sins, he can see
them in himself, confess them before the Lord, and repent of them. It is
said that he can if he will, and he who believes in eternal life does
will. But even so, he ought to think not about the things he does, but
about those he wants to do, which, when he believes them allowable, he
also does, or, if he does not do them, it is on account of the world.
There is an internal effect and an external effect, or internal and
external deed. The external effect or deed proceeds and has existence
from the internal effect or deed, just as action from effort. Effort in
a man is will; consequently, although he does not do a thing in body,
yet if he makes it allowable, then the effort or will remains, and this,
in spirit, is action itself. Therefore, recognizing and knowing what his
sins are is recognizing and knowing his thoughts, and in them what he
makes allowable, and then what he lusts after and favours in his
thought. For example, if a man considers whether whoredom is a sin, and
what a serious sin it is, whether hatred and acts of revenge are sins,
whether thefts and the like, arrogance and pride, contempt also for
others, and avarice, are sins; he must then remove any disguises he has
cast over them, that is, any confirmations, and let him consult the
Word, and he will see.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5.">5.</span></span>

Everyone sees that he who acknowledges that a sin is a sin \[can see the
sins in himself\] but he who makes them allowable in thought, and, on
account of the world, not allowable in the body, cannot see them. He is
like a man turning a mirror upside down to see his face, or like one who
wants to see his face putting a piece of linen gauze in front of
it. <span id="fr_1"></span>[5-1](#fn_1.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6.">6.</span></span>

4\. Before repentance, good is spurious good. It is the same with
charity, because good is of charity. For there is evil inwardly with the
man, because it has not been opened, and therefore not healed; and
genuine good cannot spring from evil. The fountain is impure. The good
which springs from evil may, in its outward form, appear good; but
within it, is the man, such as he is inwardly. All that the man does
thence is an image of him. Before the angels he himself appears in his
own image, indeed, outside himself; which I have seen a thousand times.
On this account the good which anyone does with the body may appear good
before those who see only the external; but within there lies hidden the
will and intention, which may be that he wishes to be thought sincere
and good, so that he may impose on others for the sake of honour and
gain. In a word, it is good that is either merit-seeking, or
hypocritical, or diabolical, which is in order to deceive, revenge,
kill, etc.; but this good is taken away at death when he is let into his
interior things, and it becomes openly evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7.">7.</span></span>

Every good that a man does to the neighbour is of charity, or is
charity. The quality of the charity therefore may be recognized from the
three things preceding, namely: 1, To what extent he shuns evils as
sins, 2, To what extent he knows and recognizes what are sins; 3, And to
what extent he has seen them in himself, confessed them, and repented.
These are the indications to anyone of what quality is the charity he
has.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8.">8.</span></span>

5\. Consequently the "first" of charity is to look to the Lord and shun
evils because they are sins. Every good which a man does to the
neighbour for the sake of the neighbour, or for the sake of truth and
good, thus for the sake of what is in accordance with the Word, or for
the sake of religion, thus for the sake of God, which therefore is from
a spiritual love or affection, is called a good of charity, or a good
work. This is not good in so far as it derives \[anything\] from the
man, but is good in so far as it is from the Lord <span
id="fr_2"></span>[8-1](#fn_2.md) through the man. The Lord does good to
everyone, chiefly through others, but yet so that a man scarcely knows
otherwise than that it is from himself; and therefore He quite often
moves the wicked to do good to others, but from an affection of the love
of self and of the world. This good is indeed of the Lord or from the
Lord, but the man is not on that account rewarded. But a man is rewarded
if he does good, not from a merely natural love or affection, but from a
spiritual love or affection. The reward is the heavenly delight of that
love and affection, which awaits him in eternity; and this in so far as
he does not do it from himself, that is, in so far as he believes that
all good is from the Lord, and does not place merit in it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9.">9.</span></span>

That no one can from himself do good which is good, but that in so far
as a man shuns evils as sins, he does goods not from himself but from
the Lord, may be seen in THE DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM,
FROM THE PRECEPTS OF THE DECALOGUE, nos. 9-17, and 18-31.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10.">10.</span></span>

From these it is evident that before repentance it is charity, the good
of which is not from the Lord but from the man; but after repentance it
is charity the good of which is not from the man but from the Lord. For
the Lord cannot enter with a man, and do any good from Himself through
him, before the devil, that is, evil, is cast out, but after he is cast
out. The devil is cast out by repentance, and when he is cast out the
Lord enters and does good there through the man, yet always in such a
way that the man does not perceive otherwise than that he is doing it
from himself; though he knows nevertheless that it is from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11.">11.</span></span>

From these things it is now evident that the "first" of charity is to
shun evils as sins, which is done by repentance. Who does not see that
an impenitent man is wicked? And who does not see that a wicked man has
not charity? And who does not see that he who has not charity cannot do
charity? Charity must be from charity in the man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12.">12.</span></span>

In conclusion, let some passages be brought forward from the Word, for
example from the Lord's words to the Pharisees, about the internal man
having to be purified. Passages in Isaiah 1. Some of the passages In THE
DOCTRINE OF LIFE FOR THE NEW JERUSALEM, nos. 28-31; also 50-52.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13.">13.</span></span>

II THE "SECOND" OF CHARITY IS TO DO GOODS BECAUSE THEY ARE USES. To be
expounded in this order: (1) Doing no evil to the neighbour is of
charity. (2) Wishing to do good to the neighbour is of charity. (3) A
man may be doing good, which he believes to be of charity, and all the
while not be shunning evil; and yet every evil is contrary to charity.
(4) In proportion as a man does not wish to do evil to the neighbour, he
wishes to do good to him; but not the reverse. (5) Before the good a man
does is the good of charity, evil must first be put away, because it is
contrary to charity; and this is done by looking to the Lord, and by
repentance. (6) Such as the recognition of evil is, and its consequent
putting away by repentance, such is the good which is of charity. (7)
Hence it follows that the "first" of charity is to look to the Lord and
shun evils as sins; and that the "second" of charity is to do goods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14.">14.</span></span>

Not wishing to do evil to the neighbour is of charity. Everyone sees
that charity does not do evil to the neighbour, because charity is love
towards the neighbour, and he who loves someone is afraid of doing evil
to him. There is a conjunction of minds between them. It is because of
this that, when he does evil to him to whom he is conjoined by love., it
is perceived in his mind as though he were doing evil to himself. Who
can do evil to his children, wife, or friends? - For doing evil is
contrary to the good of love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="15.">15.</span></span>

Who does not see that anyone hating another, acting against him with
hostility and animosity, burning with revenge, and desiring his death,
is not loving the neighbour? that anyone who would commit whoredom with
someone else's wife, who would deflower virgins and abandon them, or
violate women, is not loving the neighbour? that he who would plunder
and upon one pretext or another steal his goods, who injures another
person's reputation by slandering and so bearing false witness, is not
loving the neighbour? Nor, indeed, he who covets his house, his wife, or
the many other things that are his neighbour's? From which it Is evident
that not wishing to do evil to the neighbour is of charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="16.">16.</span></span>

Concerning this Paul writes thus, "Loving the neighbour is fulfilling
the law," in two places. <span id="fr_3"></span>[16-1](#fn_3.md) And
elsewhere from the Word:

<span class="margnote"><span id="17.">17.</span></span>

2\. Wishing to do good to the neighbour is of charity. This is well
known, for it is believed that giving to the poor, succouring the needy,
assisting widows and orphans, benefiting ministers, contributing to
churches, hospitals, and various pious uses, is of charity ; again, that
feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, sheltering the
stranger, clothing the naked, visiting the sick, going to those bound in
prison, and many other things, are good works of charity. But yet they
are good only in so far as a man shuns evils as sins. If the man does
these good works before shunning evils as sins, they are external, even
merit-seeking, because they spring from an Impure fountain, and things
issuing from such a fountain are inwardly evil. There is the man in
them, and the world in them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="18.">18.</span></span>

That doing Christian good works is of charity is well known; and many
people believe that good cancels out evil, and that so there are not
\[any\] evils with a man, or that they are not regarded; but good does
not cancel out evil unless the man thinks about the evils with himself,
and repents of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="19.">19.</span></span>

There are many who have so believed, and have supposed that there was no
evil with them. When examined, they have confessed that they were full
of evils, and that unless they were kept in external things, they could
not be saved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="20.">20.</span></span>

3\. A man may be doing good, which he believes to be of charity, and all
the while not be shunning evil; and yet every evil is contrary to
charity. It is evident that to shun evil \[and to do Christian good\]
are two distinct things; for there are people who do every good of
charity from piety and from thinking about eternal life, and all the
while they do not know that hating, bearing revenge, committing
whoredom, plundering and injuring, slandering, and so bearing false
witness, and many \[other things, are to be shunned\]. There are judges
who live piously, and yet do not count it a sin to make their judgments
on a basis of friendship, relationship, or with a view to honour and
gain; and even if they do know they are evils, they confirm themselves
in the belief that they are not. So also do others. In a word, there are
two distinct things, shunning evils as sins, and doing Christian good.
He who shuns evils as sins does Christian goods, but they who do good
and do not shun evils as sins, do not do any Christian good; for evil is
contrary to charity, and is therefore to be abolished first before the
good which anyone does is accompanied with charity, that is, is of
charity. No one is able to do good and at the same time to do evil, or
to will good and also evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="21.">21.</span></span>

Every good that in itself is good proceeds from the interior will. From
this will, evil is removed by repentance.  <span
id="fr_4"></span>[21-1](#fn_4.md)The evil into which a man is born resides
there also. Unless, therefore, he repents, evil remains in the interior
will, and the good proceeds from the. exterior will, and so his
condition is a perverted one. The interior qualifies the exterior, and
not the exterior the interior. The Lord says : "Cleanse first that which
is within the cup and platter." <span id="fr_5"></span>[21-2](#fn_5.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="22.">22.</span></span>

Man has a twofold will, interior and exterior. The interior will is
purified by repentance; and then the exterior does good from the
interior. Exterior good does not remove the evil of lusting, or evil's
root.

<span class="margnote"><span id="23.">23.</span></span>

4\. In proportion as a man does not wish to do evil to the neighbour, he
wishes to do good to him; but not the reverse. There is civil good,
there is moral good, and there is spiritual good. Good, before a man
shuns evils as sins, is civil and moral good; but as a man shuns evils
as sins, the good, both civil good and moral good, becomes spiritual as
well, but not before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="24.">24.</span></span>

Lusting lies hidden within, and its delight is outside. When, therefore,
a man thinks from lusting and its delight, either he confirms evil and
believes it to be allowed, and so is in evil; or he does not think about
any evil with himself, and so believes himself to be sound.

<span class="margnote"><span id="25.">25.</span></span>

It is true that a man ought to confess to being a sinner, and that from
the head to the sole of the foot there is no soundness in him. This he
can say, and say from knowledge; but still he cannot inwardly believe it
unless he knows it through investigation. Then he can say these things,
and then he first discerns that there is no soundness in him. In this
and in no other way is the ulcer opened and healed. In any other way it
is palliative curing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="26.">26.</span></span>

Did not the Lord preach repentance; the disciples also; and John the
Baptist? Isaiah says that the first thing is to cease from evils, and
that then one learns to do good. <span id="fr_6"></span>[26-1](#fn_6.md)
Nor does one know, before that, what is good, or of what quality good
is. Evil does not know what is good; whereas good, from knowing what is
good, knows evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="27.">27.</span></span>

Before the good a man does is the good of charity, evil must first be
put away, because it is contrary to charity; and this is done by
repentance. Since evil must first be known for the reason that it is to
be put away, the Decalogue was the "first" of the Word, and in the whole
of Christendom is also the " first " of the doctrine of the Church. All
are initiated into the Church through knowing evil, and, because it is
against God, not doing it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="28.">28.</span></span>

Therefore this "first" was so holy, for the reason that no one is able
to do Christian good before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="29.">29.</span></span>

That good follows, is clearly evident from this: A judge says, I do not
intend to pass judgment from evil, <span id="fr_7"></span>[29-1](#fn_7.md)
for various reasons, but justly; and he does good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="30.">30.</span></span>

A farmer says, I do not intend to do my work except justly and
faithfully; so he does good work.

<span class="margnote"><span id="31.">31.</span></span>

So in a thousand other instances; when anyone does not do evil he does
good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="32.">32.</span></span>

It can therefore be taken as a maxim, that to shun evil as sin is to do
good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="33.">33.</span></span>

6\. Such as the recognition of evil is, and its consequent putting away
by repentance, such is the good which is of charity. According as a man
knows what is more or less evil. According as he knows the evils of
faith and also the evils of life. And how he desists from them; And
desists from them as he looks to the Lord and believes in Him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="34.">34.</span></span>

Examples can teach. Whether he is such inwardly; then the purer he is;
then of better water is the fountain from which his good flows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="35.">35.</span></span>

In a word, good to anyone is good in the same degree and of the same
kind as evil to him is evil. The one cannot be separated from the other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="36.">36.</span></span>

In so far as any one puts off the old man, he puts on the new.

<span class="margnote"><span id="37.">37.</span></span>

In so far as anyone crucifies the flesh, he lives in the spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="38.">38.</span></span>

No one can serve two masters at the same time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="39.">39.</span></span>

Recognition involves that what is true and what is false has to be
known. Putting away is of the will. Both are of the life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="40.">40.</span></span>

7\. Hence it follows that the "first" of charity is to look to the Lord
and shun evils because they are sins; and that the "second" of charity
is to do goods. An evil man, as well as a good one, can do good. He can
help someone in need, can do him many good offices, from goodwill,
kindness, friendship, or compassion. But nevertheless these things are
not of charity with the one who does them, but with the one to whom the
charity is exercised. To outward appearance it is charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="41.">41.</span></span>

When anyone has shunned an evil as a sin several times, then there
appears to him only the good that he is doing; and they \[that is, the
prior shunning of evil and the subsequent doing of good\] are with him
together. But nevertheless the one must be prior; and the one really is
prior and interior.

<span class="margnote"><span id="42.">42.</span></span>

III THE NEIGHBOUR TO BE LOVED IS, IN A SPIRITUAL IDEA, GOOD AND TRUTH.
It is said, "in a spiritual idea", because it is in this that the
spiritual man is interiorly, and because the angels are in the same
idea. This idea is dissociated from matter, from space and time, and
dissociated especially from person. Arrangement into order: (1) A man is
not a man from the form, but from the good and truth with him, or what
is the same, from the will and understanding. (2) It is therefore the
good and truth with a man that is the neighbour to be loved. (3) The
quality of neighbour with a man is in accordance with the quality of the
good and truth with him; or such as the man is, such a neighbour is he.
(4) The degree of neighbour is in accordance with the degree of good and
truth with the man; and hence one man is not neighbour in the same
degree as another. (5) The good of the internal will is the neighbour to
be loved, and not the good of the external will, unless this makes one
with it. (6) Truth is the neighbour in so far as it proceeds from good
and makes one with it as a form makes one with its essence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="43.">43.</span></span>

1\. A man is not a man from the form, but from the good and truth with
him, or what is the same, from the will and understanding. That the will
and understanding are the man himself, not the form, which may appear
like a man in face and body, is well known. There are some who are
foolish and insane, and yet they appear to be men. There are some so
natural that they are like animals, except that they can speak. There
are others who are rational, and others who are spiritual. It may even
be that the human form of the latter appears less beautiful, yet they
are men more than the former. Take good and truth away from them, and
there is a human form without a man in it. They are like paintings and
sculptures, and like apes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="44.">44.</span></span>

It is said, "good and truth, that is, will and understanding," because
good is of the will, and truth is of the understanding; for the will is
the receptacle of good, and the understanding is the receptacle of
truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="45.">45.</span></span>

But yet it is only in their subject that good and truth can be. A thing
cannot be separated from its subject; and therefore man is the
neighbour; but in a spiritual idea it is good and truth, man being a man
from these.

<span class="margnote"><span id="46.">46.</span></span>

2\. It is therefore the good and truth with a man that is the neighbour
to be loved. Put in front of you three or ten persons whom you may
select for some domestic matter. Do you select otherwise than according
to the good and truth with them? It is from the latter that a man is a
man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="47.">47.</span></span>

If you are selecting someone for your household staff out of ten
persons, do you not inquire about his will and understanding?

<span class="margnote"><span id="48.">48.</span></span>

The one of them you select is to you the neighbour who is loved. In like
manner, a devil-man may, in face, look like an angel-man. Is it not an
angel-man that is to be loved, not a devil-man? You do good to an
angel-man on account of the good and truth with him, but not to a
devil-man. Charity requires that the latter should be punished if he
does evil, and the angel-man rewarded.

<span class="margnote"><span id="49.">49.</span></span>

If you have in view ten maidens for the purpose of selecting one of them
to be your wife, five of whom are harlots and five chaste, do you not
select one of the chaste, in accordance with the good in her that agrees
with your own?

<span class="margnote"><span id="50.">50.</span></span>

3\. The quality of the neighbour with a man is in accordance with the
quality of the good \[and truth\] with him; or such as a man is, such a
neighbour is he. The Lord's parable of the man wounded by robbers, where
it is said that the one who helped him is neighbour, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[50-1](#fn_8.md) teaches that not every man is neighbour
in the same way as another.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[2-1](cha01.htm#fr_0.md) The Latin word proprium
means "what is one's own." Swedenborg uses it in a special sense
involving what is of the self.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[5-1](cha01.htm#fr_1.md) Note on the left-hand
margin of the original MS.: "Investigation: 1, If only as to actions it
does not find out much, and this does not suffice; the reason; 2, but if
as to thoughts and intentions then it finds out more; 3, but if he
investigates what he reckons as a sin or as not a sin, then he finds out
indeed, For whatever a man makes allowable in himself, that he does. To
make allowable is of the will; it is effort, and in spirit is a deed;
and he will do it in the body when obstacles are removed. Machiavellians
also are such.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[8-1](cha01.htm#fr_2.md) The Latin original has ex
