### Prophets and Psalms

<span class="margnote"><span id="1.">1.</span></span>

Prophetical Books Isaiah Chapter 1 Verses 1-8 The church has been
vastated by evil of life, 3 9 so that there is little of a residue. 3
10-15 Therefore their external worship is of no avail. 3 16-19
Exhortation that they should repent of the evil of life, and thus they
will receive good. 3 20-23 They falsify the Word. 3 24-27 The Lord when
He comes will destroy them, and will establish the church with others;
1, 11 28-31 This when nothing of the church remains with them. 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="2.">2.</span></span>

Chapter 2 \[Isaiah\] 1-5 The Coming of the Lord, and a new heaven and a
new church at that time, are openly treated of, 1, 12 6-9 because in the
former church there is nothing but falsity and evil of falsity. 1, 3
10-18 The Coming of the Lord is openly treated of; He will destroy all
who are in the love of self and in the pride of their own intelligence.
1, 3, 15 10, 19-21 The last judgment is openly treated of, and the
casting down of the evil into hell. 15 22 Something concerning the
separation of the good from them. 15

<span class="margnote"><span id="3.">3.</span></span>

Chapter 3 \[Isaiah\] 1-7 There will be a lack of knowledges
\[cognitiones\] of good and truth, 2 8-12 because they are in evils and
in things falsified. 2 13, 14 The Lord will come to judgment, 15 15-26
and He will cast into hell those who have perverted the truths of the
Word. 15

<span class="margnote"><span id="4.">4.</span></span>

Chapter 4 \[Isaiah\] 1-3 There will then be from the Lord a new thing of
the church, 12 4-6 and providence that the Word be not perverted still
further. 12

<span class="margnote"><span id="5.">5.</span></span>

Chapter 5 \[Isaiah\] 1, 2 A church full of truths and goods from the
Word was instituted by the Lord. 2 3, 4, 7 It became perverted. 2 \[5,
6,\] 7-15 It is destroyed still further by falsifications of the truth
and good of the Word. 2 16, 17 The Lord will come and give the church to
others. 1, 11 \[18, 19,\] 20-30 Those who perverted the truths and goods
of the church will perish from falsities and evils of every kind. 15

<span class="margnote"><span id="6.">6.</span></span>

Chapter 6 \[Isaiah\] 1-4 The Lord appeared in the midst of His Divine
truth, which is the Word. \[1\] 5-8 The doctrine of the church, derived
from the Word not understood, was impure. 2 9-13 It is foretold that all
understanding of the Word would perish, so that at last it would no
longer be known what truth and good are in the church. 2

<span class="margnote"><span id="7.">7.</span></span>

Chapter 7 \[Isaiah\] 1-6 Ignorance of truth and non-understanding of the
Word will enter and begin to destroy the church. 2 7-9 It is foretold
that this will not take place as yet, 3, 2 10-16 but it will at the time
when the Lord comes into the world. 3, 1 17-20 Then all understanding of
the Word will be perverted by knowledges \[scientifica\] and by
reasonings from them, until nothing remains. 2, 3 21, 22 Then truth will
be taught in all abundance. 11, 3 23, 24 The church will then be wholly
devastated. 11, 3 23 It will be otherwise with those who receive. 11, 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="8.">8.</span></span>

Chapter 8 \[Isaiah\] 1-4 It is foretold that before that time knowledge
\[cognitio\] and perception truth will perish, 2, 3 5, 6 because they
are not willing to understand the Word in simplicity. 2, 3 7-12 By
reasonings from falsities the whole church will perish, until
conjunction with God will no longer take place; 2, 3 13-16 and they will
not know the Lord, who is the Word and the church. 4 17-21 Nevertheless,
others will know the Lord, who reject falsities, and put away things
falsified, 11 9:1 (H.B. 8:23) and who, by combats against evils and
falsities, receive reformation; 11 8:22 (H.B. 8:22) although the church
there is nothing but falsity. 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="9.">9.</span></span>

Chapter 9 \[Isaiah\] 1 \[See above, before 8:22.\] 11 2-4 (H.B. 9:1-3)
The Coming of the Lord, and the new church which will receive Him, 1, 11
5 (H.B. 4) but not the old church, which has been destroyed. 1, 11 6, 7
(H.B. 5, 6) The Lord, who is described, will do all things, and He will
protect from falsities and evils. 11 8-21 (H.B. 7-20) The old church,
from its own intelligence, will falsify and pervert every truth and good
of the Word and thus of the church, even until nothing remains. 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="10.">10.</span></span>

Chapter 10 \[Isaiah\] 1, 2 The further vastation of the church, by their
taking away stealthily from others the truths and goods of the church. 2
3, 4 They will perish at the time of the last judgment. 5, 2 5-11 They
pervert truths by reasonings from their own intelligence. 2 12-19 At the
time of the last judgment such are to be utterly destroyed by the Lord,
so that scarcely anything of natural truth will remain with them. 15, 3
20-22, 24 Those who believe in the Lord are to be saved, 17, 3 and to be
protected lest they be taken captive by confirmations of falsity through
reasonings; 12 23, 25-34 because the whole church has been devastated by
knowledges \[scientifica\] that pervert the truths of the church and
confirm falsities. 12

<span class="margnote"><span id="11.">11.</span></span>

Chapter 11 \[Isaiah\] The Coming of the Lord. 1 1-5 He will judge from
Divine wisdom; and will save the faithful and destroy the unfaithful. 15
6-9 The state of innocence that those in the heavens have who trust in
Him. 12 10-12 Those who are in falsities from ignorance, and have not
suffered themselves to be led astray by falsities and evils, will draw
near to the Lord. 11, 12 13-15 The church will then understand the Word,
and will shake off falsities of every kind. 11, 12 16 These falsities
will no longer hurt them. 11, 12

<span class="margnote"><span id="12.">12.</span></span>

Chapter 12 \[Isaiah\] 1-6 Confession and celebration of the Lord on
account of salvation. 16

<span class="margnote"><span id="13.">13.</span></span>

Chapter 13 \[Isaiah\] In this chapter, concerning the adulteration of
good and truth, which is "Babel" \[or "Babylon"\]. 1-3 The Lord will
come in Divine power, 1 4-9 for grievous judgment upon those that have
utterly departed, to destroy them, 15 10-12 because there is no longer
any good and truth remaining with them. 15 13-18 Therefore all will
perish with their evils and falsities, 15 19-22 and abide in hell, where
there are direful and horrid evils and falsities. 15

<span class="margnote"><span id="14.">14.</span></span>

Chapter 14 \[Isaiah\] 1-3 The new church that is to be established. 12
4-6 The judgment upon those who have adulterated the goods of the church
and profaned its truths, which are "Babel" \[or "Babylon"\]. 15, 3 7-12,
15-21 The casting of them down into hell, where they are the worst of
all. 15, 3 13, 14 Their pride, that they wish to have dominion with God
over heaven. 15, 3 22, 23 Their horrible end. 15, 3 24-27 Those who by
reasonings from their own intelligence destroy the truths of the Word
and profane them, are to be destroyed. 15, 3 28-32 (L.B. 15:1-5) The
judgment upon those who make religion to consist in nothing but
knowledges \[cognitiones\]. These knowledges are "Philistia." 15 30, 32
(L.B. 15:3, 5) When they are removed the church will be safe. 12

<span class="margnote"><span id="15.">15.</span></span>

Chapter 15 \[Isaiah\] The last judgment upon those who have rejected the
goods of charity, and have perverted the goods of the word, who are
meant by "Moab." 15, 3 1-9 (L.B. 16:1-9) Their destruction. 15, 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="16.">16.</span></span>

Chapter 16 \[Isaiah\] 1, 2 (L.B. 10, 11) The Lord is not acknowledged by
them. 4 3-5 (L.B. 12-14) They will remain until the Coming of the Lord,
and are then to be judged. 15 6-14 (L.B. 15-23) Of what quality they
are, and of what quality they will be after their end. 15

<span class="margnote"><span id="17.">17.</span></span>

Chapter 17 \[Isaiah\] Those who place religion in nothing but knowing
knowledges \[scientia cognitionum\], which is "Damascus." 2 1, 2 They
are to be destroyed. 2 3 This \[knowledge\] will be serviceable to the
new church. 11, 2 4-6 The knowledge of knowledges will then be rare, 11,
2 7, 8 but they are to be instructed by the Lord. 11, 2 9-14 Those who
do not suffer themselves to be instructed by the Lord will lack all
things, and will seize upon falsities for truths. 11, 2

<span class="margnote"><span id="18.">18.</span></span>

Chapter 18 \[Isaiah\] Those who are willing to be in blind ignorance
respecting the things of salvation. Such are "Cush" \[or "Ethiopia"\]. 2
1, 2 Their quality. 2 3-6 When the church will be established, they will
be rejected as worthless. 3 7 On the other hand, those who are in
ignorance from not having the church, will draw near to the Lord. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="19.">19.</span></span>

Chapter 19 \[Isaiah\] Those who, out of a mere science of such things as
belong to the word and the church, make a religion for themselves, and
enter into it; this religion is "Egypt". 2 1-4 From this come
controversies and heresies; and such men enter into falsities of every
kind. 2 5-10 All truths will perish with them. 2 \[11\], 12-15 Insanity
will take the place of intelligence. 2, 3 15-17 They will perish. 15
18-22 Such knowledges \[scientifica\] will be of use in the future, when
they have been instructed in truths by the Lord. 11 23-25 Then the
spiritual, rational, and knowing faculties will act in unity. 11, 12

<span class="margnote"><span id="20.">20.</span></span>

Chapter 20 \[Isaiah\] The same. 2, 3 1-6 In consequence of their having
been deprived of truths, they will be led astray by reasonings and will
be devastated by them of every good of religion. 2, 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="21.">21.</span></span>

Chapter 21 \[Isaiah\] 1-4 Natural good will no longer remain. 3 5-7
Expectation of the Lord, when the natural \[of man\] will first be
imbued with truths from good; 1, 11 8-10 then the rational, 11 9 so far
as adulteration of good and truth ceases. 3 11, 12 The Coming of the
Lord is expected. 11 13, 14 Then those who are in ignorance will have
knowledges \[cognitiones\] of good and truth. 2, 11 15-17 He will come
when all knowledges \[cognitiones\] of truth and good perish, until very
little is left. 11, 2, 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="22.">22.</span></span>

Chapter 22 \[Isaiah\] Self intelligence. 2 1-7 The truths of the church
are destroyed thereby. 2 8-12 The externals of the church are wholly
destroyed thereby, until they come into ignorance concerning the Lord. 2
13-15 From the delights of falsity, they will then destroy the senses of
the Word. 2 16-19 They will perish. 2 20-24 The power of the Word will
remain, guarded by the Lord. 2 25 This also will perish in the church. 2

<span class="margnote"><span id="23.">23.</span></span>

Chapter 23 \[Isaiah\] The church which is to be devastated and which has
been devastated in respect to all knowledges \[cognitiones\] of good and
truth. This is "Tyre." 2 1-9 There is no longer any truth of the church
through knowledges \[cognitiones\], as before. 2 10-14 It will be
vastated still further by reasonings from falsities. 2 15-17 The
devastation of knowledges \[cognitiones\] of truth will extend, and it
will last until the Coming of the Lord. 1, 2, 3 18 The knowledges
\[cognitiones\] will then be of service to others. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="24.">24.</span></span>

Chapter 24 \[Isaiah\] 1-13 The church in general is utterly devastated,
insomuch that there is no longer anything of the church remaining, but
in its place falsity and evil. 3 14-16 Those who are outside of the
church will receive enlightenment from the Lord. 11 16-20 The church
will utterly perish, and is to be destroyed. 3 21, 22 They are to be
cast into hell. 15 22, 23 There will be a new church from the Lord in
place of the old. 11, 12

<span class="margnote"><span id="25.">25.</span></span>

Chapter 25 \[Isaiah\] 1 Confession of the Lord, 16 2 after all things of
the church had utterly perished. 3 3-5 They shall not then perish; and
those who are outside of the church shall draw near, and shall be
protected that they be not infested by them. 11 6-8 The Lord will
disclose truths to them, and will take away the blindness that has
arisen. 11 9, 10 Confession of the Lord by them. 16 10-12 Adulteration
of the good of the church and of the Word will be utterly destroyed. 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="26.">26.</span></span>

Chapter 26 \[Isaiah\] 1-4 Glorification of the Lord because of the
doctrine of truth from Him, which they will receive and confess. 16 5, 6
The old church, being utterly destroyed, is rejected. 3 7-9 Consequently
the Coming of the Lord will then be expected. 1 10, 11 The wicked will
not receive. 4 12, 13 The Lord alone will teach all things. 11 14, 15
Those who by persuasion establish falsity of doctrine, are to be utterly
rejected by the judgment. 15 16-18 They could not grow better prior to
this, owing to the ignorance in which they are. 11 19 Nevertheless, they
are to be instructed, and will receive life. 11 19-21 They are to be
preserved, while, in the meantime, those who are in the persuasion of
falsity are to be destroyed by the last judgment. 15

<span class="margnote"><span id="27.">27.</span></span>

Chapter 27 \[Isaiah\] 1 There is no longer any truth or good in the
natural man. 2 2, 3 Nevertheless the truth of the church must be
guarded. 11 4, 5 Every evil and falsity will be destroyed on the day of
judgment. 15 6 Afterwards there will be a new church 11 7, 8 with those
in whom truths have not been completely lost. 11 8-12 In time all true
worship will perish, with all truth and good; they will perish on the
day of judgment. 15 12, 13 Afterwards there will be a new church that
will confess the Lord. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="28.">28.</span></span>

Chapter 28 \[Isaiah\] Those who from their own intelligence have
falsified truths. These are "the drunkards of Ephraim." 2 1, 2 Falsities
will break in. 2 3, 4 Truths will perish. 2 5\[, 6\] The Lord will teach
truths when He comes. 11 7, 8 Then all doctrine will be full of
falsities and evils, 3 9, 10 so that they cannot be instructed and
taught. 3 11-13 They will reject. 3 14-16 They will laugh to scorn those
things that are of heaven and the church, and will reject those things
that are of the Lord. 17-21 Although they will reprobate and not
understand, nevertheless they must be taught. 4, 2 22-29 They will be
taught constantly, and yet will not receive. 2, 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="29.">29.</span></span>

Chapter 29 \[Isaiah\] The lost doctrine of truth of the church. This is
"Ariel." 3 1-4 It will perish even until it is not anything. 3 5, 6
Falsities will gain strength and pervert still further, even until the
church perishes. 2, 3 7, 8 Falsity will appear as truth. 2, 3 9, 12
Because of falsities they are unable to see truths. 2, 3 13 There is
external worship without internal. 2, 3 14 There is no longer any
understanding of truth. 2, 3 15, 16 They will entertain sinister
thoughts about God. 3 17-19 When the old church perishes, a new one is
to be established by the Lord. 3, 11 20, 21 All who are against truth
and good will perish. 3 22-24 It will be otherwise with those who will
receive the Lord; they will understand truths. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="30.">30.</span></span>

Chapter 30 \[Isaiah\] 1-5 Those who trust in the knowledge \[scientia\]
of the natural man, thus in their own intelligence, lead themselves
astray. 2 6 The learned or the self-taught: 2 7-10 they are led astray
by knowledges \[scientiae\], and they recede from the Word, 2 11 and
from the Lord. 2 12-14 Thus they have no truth and thus again no good. 2
15 They should have trust in the Lord. 2 16, 17 Those who trust in
themselves and in their own learning have no intelligence whatever. 2
18, 19 The Lord turns Himself to those who trust in Him. 11 20, 21 They
will be instructed. 11 22 They will then reject those things pertaining
to self-intelligence. 11 23-26 They will then have truth in all
abundance, and wisdom. 11 27, 28 When those who are in the falsities of
evil will perish, 15, 3 29, 30 they will then come into the delights of
truth and good, from the Lord. 11 30, 31 There will be a judgment on
those who trust in themselves. 15 32, 33 Those who have thereby
adulterated the Word, will be cast into hell. 15

<span class="margnote"><span id="31.">31.</span></span>

Chapter 31 \[Isaiah\] 1 Those who trust in their own learning from
self-intelligence, and not in the Lord, 4 2 are against Him; wherefore
they have evil. 2, 4 3 They have no understanding of truth, but will
fall into falsities. 2 4 They are to be destroyed at the time of
judgment. 15 5, 6 The Lord will then protect those in whom is the church
from Him. 11 7 Then they will reject falsities and evils. 11 8, 9 Those
who trust in themselves will perish. 15 9 There will be good from the
Lord in the new church. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="32.">32.</span></span>

Chapter 32 \[Isaiah\] 1 When the Lord will reign by means of the Divine
truth, 1 2-4 truth will be acceptable, and there will be understanding
of truth, 11 5 and pretense will cease. 11 6, 7 Then the false-speaker
will speak falsities, and the malevolent will do evils, 3 8 and vice
versa. 11 9-12 Then all things of the church will cease, 11\[, ?3\] 13,
14 and falsity will be everywhere, \[3\] 15-18 even until there is
Divine truth from the Lord; then there will be truth and good, and
protection from falsities. 11 19 Falsity will continue even unto the
end. 3 20 Not so with those who love truth and good. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="33.">33.</span></span>

Chapter 33 \[Isaiah\] 1 Those who by falsities vastate the truths of the
church. 3 2 The Lord when He comes, will protect His own. 11 3, 4 The
vastators will be dispersed by Him. 3 5, 6 They will have protection
from the Lord by means of Divine truth. 11 7-9 Devastation of the truth
of the church will then continue. 3 10 They will not care for the Lord.
4 11, 12 Falsities and evils will consume all things of the church. 15,
3 13, 14 They will fear the last judgment. 15 15-17 Those who do good
are to be saved by the Lord. 11, 17 18, 19 They will not listen to
falsities nor believe them. 11 20-22 They will be of the Lord's church,
and there they will have from the Lord an abundance of all things of
truth, 11 23, 24 and of all things of good; and thus no more evil. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="34.">34.</span></span>

Chapter 34 \[Isaiah\] 1-8 A last judgment upon all who are in evil and
in falsities therefrom, is described. 15 9-15 Having been cast down into
hell they will abide in horrid falsities and evils to eternity. 15 16
This has been foretold. 15 17 It will be otherwise with those who are
not such. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="35.">35.</span></span>

Chapter 35 \[Isaiah\] 1-3 Those who are outside of the church, and do
not have the Word, are to be accepted, that they may become a church,
and all things of heaven are to be given to them. 11 \[4,\] 5 The Lord
will protect and liberate the latter from the infernals, 11 6-9 and
while in the midst of them they are to be protected and saved. 11 10 The
church will consist of them, and they will have the good of the church.
11

<span class="margnote"><span id="36.">36.</span></span>

Chapter 36 \[Isaiah\] 1 Reasonings from falsities have perverted the
doctrinals of the church, 2 2-6 by means of knowledges \[scientifica\]
falsely applied, 2 7 and by abrogation of the representative worship, 2,
3 8-10 and in consequence, the church has gone away into what is
perverse; 11, 12 the result of this was mere evils and falsities, 2, 3
13-20 even so that they blasphemed the Lord, \[maintaining\] that He had
no power. 2, 3 21, 22 This has been made manifest. 2, 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="37.">37.</span></span>

Chapter 37 \[Isaiah\] 1-5 Of those who repented, and consulted truths of
doctrine, 3 6, 7 and perceived that those who blasphemed the Lord will
perish. 3, 2, 4 8-13 They blasphemed still more violently, as \[in the
assertion\] that He could be of no avail whatever against them. 3, 4
14-20 Those who consulted doctrine from the Word repented, and prayed
unto the Lord for help against the blasphemers, 3, 11 21-27 and received
answer in their heart, that those who blasphemed the Lord will perish;
and this blasphemy is likewise treated of. 3, 15, 4 28, 29 Therefore it
will go no farther, 3, 15, 4 30-32 because a new church will come into
existence in its time; 11 33-35 and therefore the old church will not be
destroyed as yet; 2 36-38 nevertheless, they are to be utterly
destroyed. 2\[?3\]

<span class="margnote"><span id="38.">38.</span></span>

Chapter 38 \[Isaiah\] 1-6 They repented; therefore they were protected
from destruction; 2 7, 8 therefore the time of the Coming of the Lord
has been protracted. 1 9-15 The church will nevertheless depart. 2 16-20
They are exhorted to repent. 2 21, 22 There is still natural good with
some. 2

<span class="margnote"><span id="39.">39.</span></span>

Chapter 39 \[Isaiah\] 1-7 It is foretold that they will adulterate all
the goods of the Word and profane its truths, until nothing of good and
truth is left, which is "Babel" \[or "Babylon"\];3 8 but not as yet. 2

<span class="margnote"><span id="40.">40.</span></span>

Chapter 40 \[Isaiah\] 1-5 The Coming of the Lord is foretold, when the
good are to be saved, and the evil will perish. 1, 2, 11 6-8 Every truth
will be banished. 2 9-11 Prediction concerning the Coming of the Lord,
and the salvation of those who receive Him, 1, 11 12-14 because He is
almighty and all-knowing. 16 15-18 All men and all things against Him
are nothing worth. 16 19, 20 One's own intelligence is nothing worth. 16
21-25 Dominion over all things is the Lord's, and without Him, all
things fall. 16 26 He rules the heavens. 16 27 Why the church is
ignorant of this. 16 28, 29, 31 The Lord upholds the church with those
who look to Him. 16, 11 30 Those who do not \[look to Him\], have no
power, but fall. 2

<span class="margnote"><span id="41.">41.</span></span>

Chapter 41 \[Isaiah\] 1-3 Concerning a last judgment executed by the
Lord from His Human, in which He was while in the world. 15 4 \[He
executed the judgment\] by means of His Divine. \[15, 10\] 5-7 Those who
were in self-intelligence opposed themselves to Him. 4 8-10, 13, 14 His
Human was strengthened by His Divine. 10 11, 12 They will be of no avail
whatever against Him. 7 15, 16 They will be totally dispersed. 8 16, 17
Those who confide in the Lord will not fail. 18-20 They will have truths
and goods in all abundance. 11 \[21,\] 22-24 The rest will not know, and
will have no power. 11 25, 26 Those who are in ignorance of truth, will
come to the Lord; 11 27 the church will consist of these. 11 28, 29 Of
themselves they are \[nothing\] but falsity and evil. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="42.">42.</span></span>

Chapter 42 \[Isaiah\] 1-4 Concerning the Lord, in whom is the Divine,
that He will gently lead and teach. 1, 11 5-8 He will save by virtue of
His Divine. 1, 11 9-12 The Coming of the Lord is foretold, and the joy
of those who will draw nigh to Him, who had previously lived in
ignorance. 1, 11 13-15 He will fight for them against the hells, which
He will conquer, and He will destroy their power. 7 16 Those who are in
ignorance are then to be enlightened. 11 17 Those who trust in their own
intelligence, and thus in falsities, are to be driven away. 3 18-20 The
Lord's patience and tolerance is described, 1, 6, 4 21 and also His
justice. 1, 6, 4 22-24 Then those who were of the church despoiled them
of all truths, and they became averse to them. 11 25 He suffered direful
things from them, and endured these things. 9, 4

Chapter 43 \[Isaiah\] 1 Redemption and salvation of those who will be of
the new church from the Lord. 17 2 Falsities and evils will not hurt
them. 11 3-8 Those from every quarter and of every kind will come to
Him. 11 9 This has been foretold. 11 10-13 He Himself, who is to come,
has foretold it. 1 14 He will destroy all who adulterate and profane the
goods and truths of the church.3 15 It will be He Himself, 1 16, 17 who
saves His own, and destroys all the power of hell.8 18-21 From Him will
be a new thing, and a new church of those who had previously been in no
truths whatever. 11 22-27 The church itself did not worship Him, but
they wearied Him with sins, which He bore with, from the beginning and
also afterwards. 4 28 Therefore He will utterly reject the church. 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="44.">44.</span></span>

Chapter 44 \[Isaiah\] 1-4 Those who will acknowledge the Lord will
receive the Holy Spirit. 1, 11 5-7 He is Jehovah who has foretold that
He will do this. 1 8 There is no other God. 1 9-11 Those who do not
worship Him alone are falsifiers. 4 12-20 Those who frame for themselves
something else of religion from their own intelligence make falsity to
appear as truth, and evil as good, whence they have a quasi divine
worship. 2 21, 22 To the Jewish church: it should refrain from such
things. 2 23, 24 To the new church: the Lord alone is the God of heaven
and earth. 11, 10 25 He rejects such, because they are insane from
self-intelligence, 3 26 when He establishes His church, 11 27 and
destroys the old church. 3 28 This is from the Lord through the Divine
Human, who is meant by "Cyrus" in this place. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="45.">45.</span></span>

Chapter 45 \[Isaiah\] Of the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, who is
"Cyrus." 1, 2 From His Divine He has omnipotence against all things of
hell. 8 3 He has Divine wisdom, 8, 10 4 through His Divine, even to
ultimates. 8, 10 5, 6 He is none other than Jehovah; let all men know
this. 10 7 From Him are all things. 10 8 Let them receive Him, that they
may be saved. 17 9-11 Doubt whether it be so and why it is so, ought not
to be entertained, 10 12 for He Himself is the God of heaven, 10 13 and
thus He will save men, for they have been bound by the hells. 17 14
Those who are in ignorance and natural men will draw near. 11 15 Whence
salvation thus comes has been hidden. 17 16 Those who are in falsities
will recede. 4 17 Those who are of His church are saved. 17 18 The
reason why they are thus saved is that man has been born for heaven. 17
19 This has been foretold in the Word. 17 20 Those who are in good draw
near, and those who are in evil recede. 11, 17 21, 22 The Lord should be
received, because He alone is God, and from Him alone is salvation. 11,
17 23-25 In Him alone is all the life of heaven, 17 24 and that life is
not in those who are against Him. 4

<span class="margnote"><span id="46.">46.</span></span>

Chapter 46 \[Isaiah\] Of the profanation of truth, which is "Bel." 2-3 1
They have affections of falsity and evil. 2-3 2 They are no longer able
to understand truth. 2-3 3-5 Those who are not of such a character have
been led by the Lord and are led by Him. 17 6, 7 The rest take goods and
truths from the Word, and profane them, and make for themselves a
religion in which there is no life. 2, 3 8-12 They ought to consider
that there is no other religion than that which is commanded in the
Word, where all truths are. 2, 3 13 The Coming of the Lord from whom is
salvation, is near at hand. 1, 17

<span class="margnote"><span id="47.">47.</span></span>

Chapter 47 \[Isaiah\] Of those who adulterate good and profane truth,
who are meant by "Babel" \[or "Babylon"\].8-15 1 These no longer have
dominion. 8, 15 2, 3 They may frame falsities of faith and evils of
love; but these will be destroyed until they are not, 8, 15 4 by the
Lord. 8, 15 5 Those who profane will be thrust down. 8, 15 6 These
falsities and evils have invaded the church and perverted it. 3 7 They
believe that they have dominion over all men, 8, 15 8, 9 and that their
dominion will not cease, by reason of the heinous inventions of worship
in which they trust. 8, 15 10, 11 They will be utterly destroyed,
because they have exalted themselves above all in the world. 8, 15 12-15
All the fictions and inventions of worship will avail nothing, because
they will be cast down into hell. 8, 15

<span class="margnote"><span id="48.">48.</span></span>

Chapter 48 \[Isaiah\] Exhortation to the church that is adulterating the
goods and profaning the truths of the word, that they should desist. 2
1, 2 It has been granted them that they may be the church, and that they
may acknowledge the Lord, but in vain. 2 3, 4 They have turned away, and
this has been declared to them, 2 5 lest, haply, they should believe
that they themselves are superior to others, 2 6, 7 and have not known
this, 2 8 and yet they have been such from the beginning. 2 9-11 They
are not yet to be destroyed, for His own reasons, and the time will yet
be prolonged. 2 12, 13 Be it known to them that He is the God of heaven
and earth. 10, 16 14-17 He is the Lord who will come among those who are
adulterating and profaning the Word, and will declare this to them: 1
18, 19 if they had obeyed Him they would have had the goods and truths
of the church in all abundance; 2 20, 21 if they would leave the
adulterations and falsifications of the Word, and the pride of having
dominion, they would be in everything of the church. 2 22 But the church
is not with them, because they have turned away. 2

<span class="margnote"><span id="49.">49.</span></span>

Chapter 49 \[Isaiah\] Of redemption and salvation by the Lord. "Israel"
here means the Lord. 17 1-3 He will give the doctrine concerning God.
17, 11 4 It is to no purpose in the church. 4 5, 6 A church with
everything belonging to it is to be established by Him. 11 7 They should
submit themselves to Him. 11, 17 7-11 He will teach them all the truths
of salvation. 17, 11 12 Those who are far removed from truths will draw
near, 11 13 and they will have joy on this account. 11 14-16 Let them
not believe that the Lord does not remember them; He remembers them
constantly. 11 17, 19 Falsities and evils will be removed. 11 18
Approach from all parts to the church. 11 19, 20 Heaven will be enlarged
for them. 12 21-23 A multitude of those who have not had the Word and
hence neither the truths of the church, will draw near, and will worship
the Lord, and will be instructed in Divine truths. 11 24, 25 Evils from
hell will not break in upon them. 11, 17 26 Those will be removed from
them, who endeavor to introduce evil and falsity; these will be in the
hells. 17

<span class="margnote"><span id="50.">50.</span></span>

Chapter 50 \[Isaiah\] 1 The former church is rejected. 3 2, 3 There is
not one there who is obedient, not one who believes that the Divine has
power to save, wherefore all things of the church are hidden from them.
3 4, 5 The Lord has taught constantly. \[1\] 6, 7 They have treated the
Lord wickedly, but He has endured it. 9 8, 9 Through the Divine in
Himself He has become justice. 10 9 Those who are against Him will
perish by falsities from evil. 15 10 Those who are far removed from
truths will trust in Him and will acknowledge Him, 11 11 and the rest,
with their evils and the falsities therefrom, will be cast down into
hell. 15
