among the ancients, evils having been cast out11 5-8 (H.B. 6-9) This was

Divine; 10 8 (H.B. 9) thus heaven and the church are His, and they are
in Divine truths from Him; 10, 12 9 (H.B. 10) thus also there are
affections for truth, and in these are the societies of heaven. 12 10
(H.B. 11) Of the church where the Word is: it should depart from the
affections of the natural man; 11 11 (H.B. 12) thus will it be the
church of the Lord, 11 12-14 (H.B. 13-15) and thus it will have
cognitions of truth and good, with subservient knowledges (scientiae);
11 15 (H.B. 16) so there will be conjunction with the Lord in heaven.

will establish a church. 16, 11 6 (H.B. 7) He is therefore to be praised
in song, 16 7, 8 (H.B. 8, 9) because His kingdom is over the whole
church, 16, 11, 12 9 (H.B. 10) and over the heavens. 16, 11, 12

Psalm 49 title, 1-4 (H.B. 1-5) Let there be attention to the following:
2 5, 6 (H.B. 6, 7) Respecting those who are merely natural, and boast of
knowledges \[scientifica\] and their own intelligence. 2 7-9 (H.B. 8-10)
No salvation comes from that source. 2 10-13 (H.B. 11-14) However much
they may boast of such things, they perish, 2, 15 14 (H.B. 15) and come
into hell. 2, 15 15 (H.B. 16) Salvation is solely in the Lord. 17 16-20
(H.B. 17-21) Knowledge \[scientia\] and one's own intelligence does not
save after death. 2

Psalm 50 title, 1-6 (H.B. 1-6) The Lord will come for judgment to those
with whom is the church. 1, 15 7-13 The Lord does not desire sacrifices
and external worship. 2 14, 15 He desires confession of the heart. 2
16-20 External worship is of no avail, so long as evils are committed. 2
\[21,\] 22 They do evils, and therefore evil befalls them. 2
