Jacob, and they were confirmed in it by means of miracles; 2 8-10 but
their fathers and the children had gone back, and had not lived
according to it, 2 11-31 the miracles in the desert even having no
effect, all of which involved how the Lord teaches and leads those whom
He calls to His church. All these things recited. 2 32-37 On account of
the miracles they returned, indeed, but only with the mouth, not with
the heart. 2 38-40 The Lord forgave them. 2 41-51 Again they were
seemingly converted when they recalled the miracles in Egypt, all of
which involve the removal and dispersion from them of the hells. A
recital of these things. 2 52-55 The Lord thus led them unto the land
which was the seat of the church. 2 56-58 Yet they backslid and
worshipped another god. 2 59-64 Therefore they were forsaken by the
Lord, and delivered over to their falsities and evils; this of
themselves. 2, 3 65-67 Thus they were rejected. 3 68-72 Therefore a new
church was instituted, which would worship the Lord, and which the Lord
could lead. 11

it by truths from the Word, 2 12, 13 (H.B. 13, 14) and yet falsities
begin to destroy it. 2 14-19 (H.B. 15-20) May the Lord come and restore
it, and may it thus be vivified.11

delivers him from the hells. 11 8-11 (H.B. 9-12) The church among the
children of Israel has gone back, and worships another god; 3 12 (H.B.
13) therefore they have been left to themselves. 2 13-16 (H.B. 14-17) If

Psalm 82 title, 1 (H.B. 1) The Lord to the church, in which is the Word,
from which it is possible to be in Divine truths: 11 2-4 let them not do

tottering; 11 6, 7 thus, although they possess the Word, they will
perish. 11 8 Prayer that the Lord may come and effect the judgment. 15
