Psalm 101 Something concerning judgment by the Lord. 15 title, 1 (H.B.
1) He is to be celebrated. 16 2, 3, 6, 7 His perfection, and He loves
those that are perfect. 16 4, 5 He rejects the evil and the haughty. 3 8
The evil will perish when the Lord comes. 3

<span class="margnote"><span id="352.">352.</span></span>

Psalm 102 title, 1-11 (H.B. 1-12) Prayer of the Lord when He was in
temptations even to despair, which state is described. 13, 6 12-18 (H.B.
13-19) Nevertheless, those that are out of the church expect compassion,
that they may become a church. 11 19-22 (H.B. 20-23) He hears and has
compassion, and a church is formed of such. 11 23, 24 (H.B. 24, 25) Let
Him not fail in temptations before that comes to pass, 6 25-28 (H.B.
26-29) that heaven and the church perish not, but may be established.
11, 12

<span class="margnote"><span id="353.">353.</span></span>

Psalm 103 title, 1-7 (H.B. 1-7) Song in praise of the Lord on account of
redemption and reformation. 16, 17 8-18 These are from mercy, because He
knows the infirmities of man. 16, 17 19-22 The heavens and the earths
are His, therefore He should be celebrated. 16, 17

<span class="margnote"><span id="354.">354.</span></span>

Psalm 104 Song in praise of the Lord. 16 1-4 From Him are Divine truths,
or the Word. 16 5-9 Of the sense of the letter of the Word, on which the
church is founded: 16, 11 10-23 from this all are taught, everyone
according to the state of His intelligence; 16, 11 24-30 from this are
the knowledges \[cognitiones\] of truth and good, from which is
spiritual nourishment16, 11 31-35 May the good be saved, and the evil
perish! 17

<span class="margnote"><span id="355.">355.</span></span>

Psalm 105 The establishment of the church by the Lord, and the
reformation of the natural man. 11 1-7 Song in praise of the Lord and of
His works for the establishment of the church. 11, 16 8-15 The
establishment of the church in the beginning, and her protection from
falsities of evils. 11 16 When there was no longer any truth, 3 17, 18
the Lord came, and they afflicted Him; 4 19-22 but He afterwards became
the God of heaven and earth. 10 23, 24 Hence those who were of the
church were natural, and in knowledges \[scientifica\]; 11 25-36
therefore their natural has been purged of falsities and evils of every
kind, which infested; these here treated of; 11 37-41 afterwards truth
and good, and protection from falsities, are granted them, 11 42-45 and
He causes them to be a church. 11

Psalm 106 Of the church instituted among the Jewish nation: it became
perverted and revolted. 3 1-5 Prayer of the Lord to the Father to give
help, that He might see the church established. 13, 11 6-8 Although
those who were of the church beheld Divine miracles, they backslid, and
yet they were preserved, 3 9-34 as at the sea Suph and afterwards in the
desert (many \[instances here recounted\]), nevertheless they rebelled.
3 35-39 They totally destroyed and profaned the truths and goods of the
church. 3 40-43 Therefore the church with them was forsaken by the Lord,
and destroyed. 3 44-46 Then those who were out of the church were heard,
11 47, 48 and a church constituted of them will arise and will worship
the Lord. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="357.">357.</span></span>

Psalm 107 1-3 A new church, which the Lord has redeemed. 11, 17 4-8 They
are in falsities of ignorance, but in a desire for truth and good. 11
9-15 They are in ignorance and in lack of truth. 11 16-21 They have no
spiritual nourishment, although they will have it through the Word. 11
22-31 When they were in knowledges \[cognitiones\], they were admitted
into temptations, and preserved. 11 \[32\], 33-34, 39-40 Song in praise
of the Lord, that those who were of the devastated church have been
rejected, 16, 3 35-38, 41-43 and that those who are of the new church
have been accepted, with whom truths and goods will be multiplied. 11

help, and show His power, 13, 3, 8 6 (H.B. 7) that those who are to be
of the church may be delivered. 8 7 (H.B. 8) Answer, that the former
church will be destroyed, 3 8, 9 (H.B. 9, 10) and an internal and an
external church will be instituted. 11 10-13 (H.B. 11-14) The Human will
become Divine when the hells have been subjugated. 10

<span class="margnote"><span id="359.">359.</span></span>

Psalm 109 Of the perverted Jewish church. 4 title, 1-6 (H.B. 1-6) It
repudiated the Lord, and considered Him vile, and hated Him. 4 7-12 They
will perish in the judgment, and there will be others in their place,
who will be received, and a church established with them. 15, 11 13-20
Their posterity will likewise perish, because they are in falsities of
evil, and because they reject the Lord. 4, 3, 4 21-25 To the Father for
help, because He is considered vile, and as nothing. 13, 4 26-29 Let
them be put to shame. 3 30, 31 Song in praise of the Father, because He
gives help.

Psalm 112 1-7, 9 He that trusts in the Lord and lives well will be

Psalm 114 1, 2 The church established by the Lord from the nations. 11

take their place, 11 7, 8 because the church is from the Lord, who will
instruct those that are in ignorance. 11

<span class="margnote"><span id="365.">365.</span></span>

Psalm 115 1-3 Omnipotence belongs to the Lord. 16 4-8 From what is His

are in truths and goods should be in the Lord. 16 12-15, 18 The Lord
will save them. 17 16 Heaven and the church are His. 17 17 Those who do
not trust in the Lord will not be saved. 16, 17

<span class="margnote"><span id="366.">366.</span></span>

Divine power through His Human. 10, 16 17 The Divine truth is from Him.
10, 16 18-22 He it is through whom is all salvation. 17 22-25 It is the

falsities! 7 9, 10 Thus He would have salvation, 17 12-14 and thus would

who are in the heavens will confess Him, 12 13 because His kingdom is
eternal. 12 14-16 He raises up sinners, and leads them into truths that
they may live. 12, 11 17 He is Divine. 17 18, 20 He saves those who
believe in Him, and those who do not believe perish. 17, 3 21 He is to
be worshipped. 16

<span class="margnote"><span id="396.">396.</span></span>

4 who reforms by knowledges \[cognitiones\] of truth, 17 5 who alone is
able to do this, 17 6, 8, 9 who teaches truths to those who are in
ignorance. 11 10, 11 One's own intelligence is nothing, but that which
is from the Lord is something. 11 16 13-15 The church will worship the
Lord who protects her, and teaches the Word. 16 16-18 The Lord disperses

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1"></span>[369-1](pps08.htm#fr_1.md) The following words are
here crossed out in the manuscript: "The initial letters here signify
such things as are meant by them in the spiritual world." This note
refers to the Hebrew initial letters of the verses, which follow the
order of the Hebrew alphabet, the first eight verses beginning each with
Aleph, the second eight with Beth, etc. This is indicated in the English
Bible by the names of the Hebrew letters to be found as inscriptions
over the successive groups of eight verses. See more on this subject in
Apocalypse Revealed, n. 38.-Editor.
