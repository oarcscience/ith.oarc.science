### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="901.">901.</span></span>

That the "seven and twentieth day" signifies what is holy, is evident
from what has just been said, since it is composed of three multiplied
by itself twice. Three multiplied by itself is nine, and nine multiplied
again by three is twenty-seven. In "twenty-seven" therefore three is the
ruling number. Thus did the most ancient people compute their numbers,
and understood by them nothing but actual things \[res\]. That "three"
has the same signification as "seven" is evident from what has been just
said. There is a hidden reason why the Lord rose on the third day. The
Lord's resurrection itself involves all holiness, and the resurrection
of all, and therefore in the Jewish Church this number became
representative, and in the Word is holy; just as it is in heaven, where
no numbers are thought of, but instead of "three" and "seven" they have
a general holy idea of the resurrection and of the coming of the Lord.
\[2\] That "three" and "seven" signify what is holy, is evident from the
following passages in the Word. In Moses: He that toucheth the dead
shall be unclean seven days; the same shall expiate himself therefrom on
the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean; but if he
expiate not himself on the third day, on the seventh day he shall not be
clean. He that toucheth one slain with a sword, or a dead body, or a
bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days; the clean shall
sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day; and
on the seventh day he shall expiate him, and he shall wash his clothes,
and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even (Num. 19:11-12,
16, 19). That these things are representative, or that the outward
things signify internal ones, is very evident, as that one would be
unclean who had touched a dead body, one slain, a bone of a man, a
grave. All these things signify in the internal sense things proper to
man, which are dead and profane. So also the washing in water and being
clean at even were representative, and also the third day and the
seventh day, which signify what is holy because on those days he was to
be purified and would thus be clean. \[3\] In like manner concerning
those who returned from battle against the Midianites: Encamp ye without
the camp seven days; whosoever hath slain a soul, and whosoever hath
touched one slain, ye shall expiate yourselves on the third day and on
the seventh day (Num. 31:19).If this were but a ritual, and the third
day and the seventh were not representative and significative of
holiness, or of expiation, it would be a dead thing, like that which is
without a cause, and like a cause without an end, or like a thing
separated from its cause, and this cause from its end, and thus in no
way Divine. That the "third day" was representative, and thus
significative, of what is holy, is very evident from the coming of the
Lord upon Mount Sinai, for which it was thus commanded: And Jehovah said
unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow,
and let them wash their garments, and be ready against the third day;
for on the third day Jehovah will come down in the sight of all the
people upon Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:10-11, 14-15). \[4\] For a similar
reason Joshua crossed the Jordan on the third day: Joshua commanded,
Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying,
Prepare you victuals, for within three days ye are to pass over this
Jordan, to go in to inherit the land (Josh. 1:11; 3:2). The crossing of
the Jordan represented the introduction of the sons of Israel, that is,
of those who are regenerate, into the kingdom of the Lord; Joshua, who
led them in, represented the Lord; and this was done on the third day.
Because the third day was holy, as was the seventh, it was ordained that
the year of tithes should be the third year, and that then the people
should show themselves holy by works of charity (Deut. 26:12-15); the
"tithes" represented remains, which because they are of the Lord alone,
are holy. That Jonah was three days and three nights in the bowels of
the fish (Jonah 1:17) manifestly represented the burial and resurrection
of the Lord on the third day (Matt. 12:40). \[5\] That "three" signifies
that holy thing is evident also in the Prophets, as in Hosea: After two
days will Jehovah revive us; on the third day He will raise us up, that
we may live before Him (Hos. 6:2),where also the "third day" plainly
denotes the coming of the Lord and His resurrection. In Zechariah: It
shall come to pass that in all the land two parts therein shall be cut
off and expire, but the third shall be left therein, and I will bring
the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is
refined, and will try them as gold is tried (Zech. 13:8-9), where the
"third part" like "three" denotes what is holy. The same is involved by
the third part as by three, and also by the third part of the third
part, as in the present passage, for three is the third of the third of
twenty-seven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="902.">902.</span></span>

That the earth's being "dry" signifies that the man was regenerate, is
evident from what was said before about the waters being dried up from
off the earth, and the face of the ground being dried, in verses 7 and
13.

<span class="margnote"><span id="903.">903.</span></span>

Verses 15, 16. And God spake unto Noah, saying, Go forth from the ark,
thou and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. "And God
spake unto Noah" signifies the presence of the Lord with the man of this
church; "Go forth from the ark" signifies freedom; "thou and thy wife"
signifies the church; "and thy sons and thy sons' wives with thee"
signifies the truths, and the goods conjoined with truths, that were in
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="904.">904.</span></span>

And God spake unto Noah. That this signifies the presence of the Lord
with the man of this church, is evident from the internal sense of the
Word. The Lord speaks with every man, for whatever a man wills and
thinks that is good and true, is from the Lord. There are with every man
at least two evil spirits and two angels. The evil spirits excite his
evils, and the angels inspire things that are good and true. Every good
and true thing inspired by the angels is of the Lord; thus the Lord is
continually speaking with man, but quite differently with one man than
with another. With those who suffer themselves to be led away by evil
spirits, the Lord speaks as if absent, or from afar, so that it can
scarcely be said that He is speaking; but with those who are being led
by the Lord, He speaks as more nearly present; which may be sufficiently
evident from the fact that no one can ever think anything good and true
except from the Lord. \[2\] The presence of the Lord is predicated
according to the state of love toward the neighbor and of faith in which
the man is. In love toward the neighbor the Lord is present, because He
is in all good; but not so much in faith, so called, without love. Faith
without love and charity is a separated or disjoined thing. Wherever
there is conjunction there must be a conjoining medium, which is nothing
else than love and charity, as must be evident to all from the fact that
the Lord is merciful to everyone, and loves everyone, and wills to make
everyone happy to eternity. He therefore who is not in such love that he
is merciful to others, loves them, and wills to make them happy, cannot
be conjoined with the Lord, because he is unlike Him and not at all in
His image. To look to the Lord by faith, as they say, and at the same
time to hate the neighbor, is not only to stand afar off, but is also to
have the abyss of hell between themselves and the Lord, into which they
would fall if they should approach nearer, for hatred to the neighbor is
that infernal abyss which is between. \[3\] The presence of the Lord is
first possible with a man when he loves the neighbor. The Lord is in
love; and so far as a man is in love, so far the Lord is present; and so
far as the Lord is present, so far He speaks with the man. Man knows no
otherwise than that he thinks from himself, whereas he has not a single
idea, nor even the least bit of an idea, from himself; but he has what
is evil and false through evil spirits from hell, and what is good and
true through angels from the Lord. Such is the influx with man, from
which is his life and the interaction of his soul with the body. From
these things it is evident what is meant by the words "God spake unto
Noah." His "saying" to anyone means one thing (as Gen. 1:29; 3:13-14,
17; 4:6, 9, 15; 6:13; 7:1), and His "speaking" means another. Here, His
speaking to Noah denotes being present, because the subject is now the
regenerated man, who is gifted with charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="905.">905.</span></span>

Go forth from the ark. That this signifies freedom, is evident from what
has been said before, and from the connection itself of the context. So
long as Noah was in the ark and surrounded with the waters of the flood,
the signification was that he was in captivity, that is, he was tossed
about by evils and falsities, or what is the same thing, by evil
spirits, from whom is the combat of temptation. Hence it follows that to
"go forth from the ark" signifies freedom. The presence of the Lord
involves freedom, the one following the other. The more present the
Lord, the more free the man; that is, the more a man is in the love of
good and truth, the more freely he acts. Such is the influx of the Lord
through the angels. But on the other hand, the influx of hell through
evil spirits is forcible, and impetuous, striving to dominate; for such
spirits breathe nothing but the utter subjugation of the man, so that he
may be nothing, and that they may be everything; and when they are
everything the man is one of them, and scarcely even that, for in their
eyes he is a mere nobody. Therefore when the Lord is liberating the man
from their dominion and from their yoke there arises a combat; but when
the man has been liberated, that is, regenerated, he, through the
ministry of angels, is led by the Lord so gently that there is nothing
whatever of yoke or of dominion, for he is led by means of his delights
and his happinesses, and is loved and esteemed. This is what the Lord
teaches in Matthew: My yoke is easy, and My burden is light (Matt.
11:30),and is the reverse of a man's state when under the yoke of evil
spirits, who, as just said, account the man as nothing, and, if they
were able, would torment him every moment. This it has been given me to
know by much experience, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy
hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="906.">906.</span></span>

That "thou and thy wife" signifies the church, is in like manner evident
from the connection, as also that "thy sons and thy sons' wives with
thee" signifies the truths, and the goods conjoined with truths, that
were in him. That "thou" signifies the man of the church, is evident,
and that his "wife" signifies the church, and his "sons" truths, and his
"sons' wives" goods conjoined with the truths, has been shown repeatedly
before and need not be dwelt on here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="907.">907.</span></span>

Verse 17. Every wild animal that is with thee of all flesh, as to fowl,
and as to beast, and as to every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth, bring forth with thee, that they may spread themselves over the
earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. "Every wild animal
that is with thee of all flesh" signifies all that was made living in
the man of this church; "fowl" signifies here as before the things of
his understanding; "beast" the things of his will, which are both of the
internal man; "every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth"
signifies the like corresponding things in the external man; "bring
forth with thee" signifies their state of freedom; "that they may spread
themselves over the earth" signifies the operation of the internal man
upon the external; "and be fruitful" signifies increasings of good; "and
multiply" signifies increasings of truth; "upon the earth" signifies in
the external man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="908.">908.</span></span>

Every wild animal that is with thee of all flesh. That this signifies
all that was made living in the man of this church, is evident from the
fact that "wild animal" is predicated of Noah, or of the man of this
church, now regenerated, and manifestly refers to what follows, namely,
fowl, beast, and creeping thing; for it is said, "every wild animal that
is with thee of all flesh, as to fowl, and as to beast, and as to every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." The word in the original
tongue here rendered "wild animal" signifies properly life, or what is
living; but in the Word it is used both for what is living and for what
is as it were not living, or a wild animal; so that unless one knows the
internal sense of the Word, he is sometimes unable to see what is meant.
The reason of this twofold meaning is that the man of the Most Ancient
Church, in his humiliation before the Lord, acknowledged himself as not
living, not even as a beast, but only as a wild animal; for those people
knew man to be such when regarded in himself, or in what is his own.
Hence this same word means what is living, and also means "wild animal."
\[2\] That it means "what is living" is evident in David: Thy wild
animal shall dwell therein \[that is, in God's inheritance\]; Thou, O
God, wilt confirm the poor with Thy good (Ps. 68:10). Here by "wild
animal" because he shall dwell in the inheritance of God, no other is
meant than the regenerated man; and so here, as in the verse we are
considering, what is living in this man is meant. Again: Every wild
animal of the forest is Mine, and the beasts upon the mountains where
thousands are; I know all the fowls of the mountains, and the wild
animals of My field are with Me (Ps. 50:10-11). Here "the wild animals
of My field with Me" or with God, denote the regenerated man, thus what
is living in him. In Ezekiel: All the fowls of the heavens made their
nests in his boughs, and under his branches all the wild animals of the
field brought forth (Ezek. 31:6), where the spiritual church is
signified, as implanted, and what is living, in the man of that church.
In Hosea: In that day will I make a covenant for them with the wild
animal of the field and with the fowl of the heavens (Hos. 2:18),where
those who are to be regenerated are meant, with whom a covenant is to be
made. Indeed, so fully does "wild animal" signify "what is living" that
the cherubim, or angels, seen by Ezekiel, are called the "four wild
animals" or "living creatures" (Ezek. 1:5, 13-15, 19; 10:15). \[3\] That
"wild animal" in the opposite sense is taken in the Word for what is not
living, is evident from many passages, of which only the following will
be cited, for confirmation. In David: O deliver not the soul of Thy
turtle-dove unto the wild animal (Ps. 74:19). In Zephaniah: How is the
city become a desolation, a place for wild animals to lie down in (Zeph.
2:15). In Ezekiel: And they shall no more be a prey to the nations,
neither shall the wild animal of the earth eat them (Ezek. 34:28).
Again: Upon his ruin all the fowl of the heavens shall dwell, and every
wild animal of the field shall be upon his branches (Ezek. 31:13). In
Hosea: There will I consume them like a lion; the wild animal of the
field shall tear them (Hos. 13:8). In Ezekiel: I have given thee for
meat to the wild animals of the earth, and to the fowl of the heaven
(Ezek. 29:5), an expression often occurring. And since the Jews remained
in the sense of the letter only, and understood by "wild animal" a wild
animal, and by "fowl" a fowl, not knowing the interior things of the
Word, nor having any willingness to acknowledge them and so to be
instructed, they were so cruel and such wild animals that they found
their delight in not burying enemies killed in battle, but exposing them
to be devoured by birds of prey and wild beasts; which also shows what a
wild animal man is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="909.">909.</span></span>

That the "fowl" signifies the things of his understanding, and the
"beast" the things of his will, which are of the internal man, and that
"every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" signifies like
corresponding things in his external man, is evident from the
signification of "fowl" as shown above (n. 40, 776), and of "beast" (n.
45, 46, 142, 143, 246). That the "creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth" signifies corresponding things in the external man, is now
evident, for the creeping thing here bears relation both to the "fowl"
or things of the understanding, and to the "beast" or things of the
will. The most ancient people called sensuous things and the pleasures
of the body creeping things that creep, because they are just like
creeping things that creep on the earth. They also likened man's body to
the earth or ground, and even called it earth or ground, as in this
passage, where nothing else than the external man is signified by the
"earth."

<span class="margnote"><span id="911.">911.</span></span>

As to "the creeping thing that creeps" signifying like corresponding
things in the external man, the case is this. In the regenerated man
external things correspond to internal things, that is, do their
bidding. External things are reduced to obedience when man is being
regenerated, and he then becomes an image of heaven. But before man has
been regenerated, external things rule over internal, and he is then an
image of hell. Order consists in celestial things ruling over spiritual
things, through these over natural things, and through these over
corporeal things; but when corporeal and natural things rule over
spiritual and celestial things, order is destroyed, and then the man is
an image of hell; and therefore the Lord restores order by means of
regeneration, and then the man becomes an image of heaven. Thus does the
Lord draw a man out of hell, and thus does He uplift him to heaven.
\[2\] A few words shall be said about the correspondence of the external
man to the internal. Every regenerated man is a kind of little heaven,
that is, he is an effigy or image of the universal heaven, and therefore
in the Word his internal man is called "heaven." There is such order in
heaven that the Lord rules spiritual things through celestial things,
and natural things through spiritual things, and in this way He rules
the universal heaven as one man, for which reason heaven is called the
Grand Man and there is the like order in everyone who is in heaven. Man
too, when like this, is a little heaven, or, what is the same, he is a
kingdom of the Lord, because the kingdom of the Lord is in him; and then
in him external things correspond to internal, that is, they obey them,
just as they do in heaven; for in the heavens (which are three, and all
of which together stand related as one man) spirits constitute the
external man, angelic spirits the interior man, and angels the internal
man (n. 459). \[3\] It is the reverse with those who make life consist
solely in corporeal things, that is, in cupidities, pleasures,
appetites, and matters of sense, perceiving no delight other than that
which is of the love of self and of the world, that is to say, which is
of hatred against all who do not favor and serve them. With such,
because corporeal and natural things rule over spiritual and celestial
things, there is not only no correspondence or obedience of external
things, but the very reverse, and thus order is utterly destroyed; and
because order is so destroyed, they cannot be other than images of hell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="912.">912.</span></span>

Bring forth with thee. That this signifies their state of freedom, is
evident from what was said under the preceding verse about "going forth
from the ark" as signifying freedom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="913.">913.</span></span>

That they may spread themselves over the earth. That this signifies the
operation of the internal man on the external, and that "being fruitful"
signifies increasings of good, "multiplying" increasings of truth, and
"upon the earth" in the external man, is evident from the connection of
the things, and also from what has been before said and shown about the
signification of "being fruitful" which in the Word is predicated of
goods, and about that of "multiplying" which is predicated of truths.
That "earth" signifies the external man has likewise been shown before;
so that we need not dwell longer on these significations in order to
confirm them. Here the subject is the operation of the internal man on
the external after the man has been regenerated, showing that good is
for the first time made fruitful, and truth multiplied, when the
external man has been reduced to correspondence or obedience. This can
never be so before, because what is corporeal opposes what is good, and
what is sensuous opposes what is true, the one extinguishing the love of
good, and the other extinguishing the love of truth. The fructification
of good and the multiplication of truth take place in the external man;
the fructification of good in his affections, and the multiplication of
truth in his memory. The external man is here called "the earth" over
which they spread themselves, and upon which they become fruitful and
multiply.

<span class="margnote"><span id="914.">914.</span></span>

Verse 18, 19. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his
sons' wives with him; every wild animal, every creeping thing, and every
fowl, everything that creepeth upon the earth, according to their
families, went forth out of the ark. "Went forth" signifies that it was
so done; by "Noah and his sons" is signified the man of the Ancient
Church; by "his wife and his sons' wives with him" is signified that
church itself. "Every wild animal, every creeping thing" signify his
goods; "wild animal" the goods of the internal man; "creeping thing" the
goods of the external man; "and every fowl, everything that creepeth
upon the earth" signify truths; "fowl" the truths of the internal man;
"that creepeth upon the earth" the truths of the external man;
"according to their families" signifies pairs; "went forth out of the
ark" signifies as before that it was so done, and at the same time it
signifies a state of freedom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="915.">915.</span></span>

That by his "going forth" is signified that it was so done; that by
"Noah and his sons" is signified the man of the Ancient Church; and that
by "his wife and his sons' wives" is signified that church itself, is
evident from the series of the things, which involves that thus was the
Ancient Church formed, for these are the last or closing statements to
what has gone before. When the church is described in the Word, it is
described either by "man \[vir\] and wife" or by "man \[homo\] and
wife;" when by "man \[vir\] and wife" by "man" is signified what is of
the understanding, or truth, and by "wife" what is of the will, or good;
when by "man \[homo\] and wife" by "man" is signified the good of love,
or love, and by "wife" the truth of faith, or faith, thus by "man
\[homo\]" is signified what is essential of the church, and by "wife"
the church itself. It is so throughout the Word. In this place, because
up to this point the formation of a new church has been treated of, on
the perishing of the Most Ancient Church, by "Noah and his sons" is
signified the man \[homo\] of the Ancient Church, and by his "wife and
his sons' wives with him" that church itself. Here therefore they are
named in an order different from that in the previous verse (16), where
it is said: "Go forth from the ark, thou and thy wife, and thy sons and
thy sons' wives with thee" where "thou" and "thy wife" are joined
together, and "thy sons" and "thy sons' wives" and thus by "thou" and
"sons" is signified truth, and by "wife" and "sons' wives" good. But in
the verse we are now considering the order is different, for the reason,
as we have said, that by "thou and thy sons" is signified the man of the
church, and by "his wife and his sons' wives" the church itself, since
it is the conclusion to what goes before. Noah did not constitute the
Ancient Church, but his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, as said before.
For three churches, so to speak, formed this Ancient Church, concerning
which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. And these churches came
forth as the offspring of one, which is called "Noah;" hence it is here
said, "thou and thy sons" and also "thy wife and thy sons' wives."

<span class="margnote"><span id="916.">916.</span></span>

That "every wild animal and every creeping thing" signify the goods of
the man of the church; "wild animal" the goods of the internal man;
"creeping thing" those of the external man; and that "every fowl and
everything that creepeth upon the earth" signify truths; "fowl" the
truths of the internal man; and "thing that creepeth upon the earth"
those of the external man, is evident from what was said and shown under
the preceding verse in regard to wild animal, fowl, and creeping thing,
where it is said "creeping thing that creepeth" because both good and
truth of the external man were signified. Inasmuch as what is here said
is the conclusion to what goes before, these things which are of the
church are added, namely, its goods and truths; and by them is indicated
the quality of the church, that it is spiritual, and that it became such
that charity or good was the principal thing; and therefore "wild animal
and creeping thing" are here first mentioned, and afterwards "fowl and
thing that creepeth." \[2\] The church is called spiritual when it acts
from charity, or from the good of charity-never when it says that it has
faith without charity, for then it is not even a church. For what is the
doctrine of faith but the doctrine of charity? And to what purpose is
the doctrine of faith, but that men should do what it teaches? It cannot
be merely to know and think what it teaches, but only that what it
teaches should be done. The spiritual church is therefore first called a
church when it acts from charity, which is the very doctrine of faith.
Or, what is the same thing, the man of the church is then first a
church. Just in the same way, what is a commandment for? not that a man
may know, but that he may live according to the commandment. For then he
has in himself the kingdom of the Lord, since the kingdom of the Lord
consists solely in mutual love and its happiness. \[3\] Those who
separate faith from charity, and make salvation consist in faith without
the good works of charity, are Cainites who slay the brother Abel, that
is, charity. And they are like birds which hover about a carcass; for
such faith is a bird, and a man without charity is a carcass. Thus they
also form for themselves a spurious conscience, so that they may live
like devils, hold the neighbor in hatred and persecute him, pass their
whole life in adulteries, and yet be saved, as is well known in the
Christian world. What can be more agreeable to a man than to hear and be
persuaded that he may be saved, even if he live like a wild beast? The
very Gentiles perceive that this is false, many of whom abhor the
doctrine of Christians because they see their life. The real quality of
such a faith is evident also from the fact that nowhere is there found a
life more detestable than in the Christian world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="917.">917.</span></span>

According to their families. That this signifies pairs, is evident from
what was said before, namely, that there entered into the ark "of the
clean by sevens" and "of the unclean by twos" (Gen. 7:2, 3, 15); while
here it is said that they went out of it "according to their families"
the reason of which is that all things had now been so reduced into
order by the Lord that they could represent families. In the regenerated
man, goods and truths, or the things of charity and faith, are related
to each other as with relationships by blood and by marriage, thus as
families from one stock or parent, in like manner as they are in heaven
(n. 685), an order into which goods and truths are brought by the Lord.
Specifically, it is here signified that all goods both in general and in
particular have regard to their own truths, as though these were
conjoined with them in marriage; and just as in general charity regards
faith, so in every particular good regards truth; for the general,
unless it exists from the particular, is not the general, seeing that it
is from the particulars that the general has its existence, and from
them is called general. So in every man, such as is the man in general,
such is he in the minutest particulars of his affection and of his idea.
Of these he is composed, or of these he becomes such as he is in
general; and therefore they who have been regenerated become such in the
smallest particulars as they are in general.

<span class="margnote"><span id="918.">918.</span></span>

Went forth out of the ark. That this involves also a state of freedom,
is evident from what was said above (at verse 16) about going out of the
ark. The quality of the freedom of the spiritual man appears from the
consideration that he is ruled by the Lord through conscience. He who is
ruled by conscience, or who acts according to conscience, acts freely.
Nothing is more repugnant to him than to act against conscience. To act
against conscience is hell to him, but to act according to conscience is
heaven to him; and from this anyone may see that acting according to
conscience is freedom. The Lord rules the spiritual man through a
conscience of what is good and true; and this conscience is formed, as
already said, in man's understanding, and is thus separated from what is
of his will. And because it is wholly separated from what is of the
will, it is very evident that man never does anything good of himself;
and since all the truth of faith is from the good of faith, it is
evident that man never thinks anything true from himself, but that this
is from the Lord alone. That he seems to do these things from himself is
only an appearance; and because it is so, the really spiritual man
acknowledges and believes it. From this it is evident that conscience
given to the spiritual man by the Lord is as it were a new will, and
thus that the man who has been created anew is endowed with a new will
and from this with a new understanding.

Verse 20. And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah; and took of every
clean beast, and of every, clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on
the altar. "Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah" signifies a
representative of the Lord; "and took of every clean beast, and of every
clean fowl" signifies the goods of charity and of faith; "and offered
burnt-offerings on the altar" signifies all the worship therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="920.">920.</span></span>

In this verse there is described the worship of the Ancient Church in
general, and this by the "altar" and the "burnt- offering" which were
the principal things in all representative worship. In the first place,
however, we will describe the worship that existed in the Most Ancient
Church, and from that show how there originated the worship of the Lord
by means of representatives. The men of the Most Ancient Church had no
other than internal worship, such as there is in heaven; for with them
heaven was in communication with man, so that they made a one; and this
communication was perception, of which we have often spoken before. Thus
being angelic they were internal men, and although they sensated the
external things of the body and the world, they cared not for them; for
in each object of sense they perceived something Divine and heavenly.
For example, when they saw a high mountain, they perceived an idea, not
of a mountain, but of elevation, and from elevation, of heaven and the
Lord, from which it came to pass that the Lord was said to dwell in the
highest, He himself being called the "Most High and Lofty One;" and that
afterwards the worship of the Lord was held on mountains. So with other
things; as when they observed the morning, they did not then perceive
the morning of the day, but that which is heavenly, and which is like a
morning and a dawn in human minds, and from which the Lord is called the
"Morning" the "East" and the "Dawn" or "Day-spring." So when they looked
at a tree and its leaves and fruit, they cared not for these, but saw
man as it were represented in them; in the fruit, love and charity, in
the leaves faith; and from this the man of the church was not only
compared to a tree, and to a paradise, and what is in him to leaves and
fruit, but he was even called so. Such are they who are in a heavenly
and angelic idea. \[2\] Everyone may know that a general idea rules all
the particulars, thus all the objects of the senses, as well those seen
as those heard, so much so that the objects are not cared for except so
far as they flow into the man's general idea. Thus to him who is glad at
heart, all things that he hears and sees appear smiling and joyful; but
to him who is sad at heart, all things that he sees and hears appear sad
and sorrowful; and so in other cases. For the general affection is in
all the particulars, and causes them to be seen in the general
affection; while all other things do not even appear, but are as if
absent or of no account. And so it was with the man of the Most Ancient
Church: whatever he saw with his eyes was heavenly to him; and thus with
him everything seemed to be alive. And this shows the character of his
Divine worship, that it was internal, and by no means external. \[3\]
But when the church declined, as in his posterity, and that perception
or communication with heaven began to be lost, another state of things
commenced. Then no longer did men perceive anything heavenly in the
objects of the senses, as they had done before, but merely what is
worldly, and this to an increasing extent in proportion to the loss of
their perception; and at last, in the closing posterity which existed
just before the flood, they apprehended in objects nothing but what is
worldly, corporeal, and earthly. Thus was heaven separated from man, nor
did they communicate except very remotely; and communication was then
opened to man with hell, and from thence came his general idea, from
which flow the ideas of all the particulars, as has been shown. Then
when any heavenly idea presented itself, it was as nothing to them, so
that at last they were not even willing to acknowledge that anything
spiritual and celestial existed. Thus did the state of man become
changed and inverted. \[4\] As the Lord foresaw that such would be the
state of man, He provided for the preservation of the doctrinal things
of faith, in order that men might know what is celestial and what is
spiritual. These doctrinal things were collected from the men of the
Most Ancient Church by those called "Cain" and also by those called
"Enoch" concerning whom above. Wherefore it is said of Cain that a mark
was set upon him lest anyone should kill him (see Gen. 4:15, n. 393,
394); and of Enoch that he was taken by God (Gen. 5:24). These doctrinal
things consisted only in significative, and thus as it were enigmatical
things, that is, in the significations of various objects on the face of
the earth; such as that mountains signify celestial things, and the
Lord; that morning and the east have this same signification; that trees
of various kinds and their fruits signify man and his heavenly things,
and so on. In such things as these consisted their doctrinal things, all
of which were collected from the significatives of the Most Ancient
Church; and consequently their writings also were of the same nature.
And as in these representatives they admired, and seemed to themselves
even to behold, what is Divine and heavenly, and also because of the
antiquity of the same, their worship from things like these was begun
and was permitted, and this was the origin of their worship upon
mountains, and in groves in the midst of trees, and also of their
pillars or statues in the open air, and at last of the altars and
burnt-offerings which afterwards became the principal things of all
worship. This worship was begun by the Ancient Church, and passed thence
to their posterity and to all nations round about, besides many other
things, concerning which of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="921.">921.</span></span>

And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah. That this signifies a
representative of the Lord, is evident from what has just been said. All
the rites of the Ancient Church were representative of the Lord, as also
the rites of the Jewish Church. But the principal representative in
later times was the altar, and also the burnt-offering, which being made
of clean beasts and clean birds, had its representation according to
their signification, clean beasts signifying the goods of charity, and
clean birds the truths of faith. When men of the Ancient Church offered
these, they signified that they offered gifts of these goods and truths
to the Lord. Nothing else can be offered to the Lord that will be
grateful to Him. But their posterity, as the Gentiles and also the Jews,
perverted these things, not even knowing that they had such a
signification, and making their worship consist in the externals only.
\[2\] That the altar was the principal representative of the Lord, is
evident from the fact that there were altars, even among Gentiles,
before other rites were instituted, and before the ark was constructed,
and before the temple was built. This is evident from Abram, as that
when he came upon the mountain on the east of Bethel he raised an altar
and called upon the name of Jehovah (Gen. 12:8); and afterwards he was
commanded to offer Isaac for a burnt-offering on an altar (Gen. 22:2,
9). So Jacob built an altar at Luz, or Bethel (Gen. 35:6-7); and Moses
built an altar under Mount Sinai, and sacrificed (Exod. 24:4-6). All
this was before the \[Jewish\] sacrifices were instituted, and before
the ark was constructed at which worship was afterwards performed in the
wilderness. That there were altars likewise among the Gentiles, is
evident from Balaam, who said to Balak that he should build seven altars
and prepare seven bullocks and seven rams (Num. 23:1-7, 14-18, 29-30);
and also from its being commanded that the altars of the nations should
be destroyed (Deut. 7:5; Judg. 2:2). Thus Divine worship by altars and
sacrifices was not a new thing instituted with the Jews. Indeed altars
were built before men had any idea of slaying oxen and sheep upon them,
but as memorials. \[3\] That altars signify a representative of the
Lord, and burnt-offerings the worship of Him thereby, is plainly evident
in the Prophets, as also in Moses when it is said of Levi, to whom the
priesthood belonged: They shall teach Jacob Thy judgments, and Israel
Thy law; they shall put incense in Thy nostrils, and whole
burnt-offering upon Thine altar (Deut. 33:10), meaning all worship; for
"to teach Jacob judgments, and Israel the law" denotes internal worship;
and "to put incense in Thy nostrils, and whole burnt-offering on Thine
altar" denotes corresponding external worship. In Isaiah: In that day
shall a man look unto his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the
Holy One of Israel and he shall not look to the altars, the work of his
hand (Isa. 17:7-8), where "looking to the altars" plainly signifies
representative worship in general, which was to be abolished. Again: In
that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of
Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to Jehovah (Isa. 19:19), where
also "an altar" stands for external worship. \[4\] In Jeremiah: The Lord
hath cast off His altar, He hath abhorred His sanctuary (Lam. 2:7);
"altar" denoting representative worship which had become idolatrous. In
Hosea: Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars have been
unto him to sin (Hos. 8:11); "altars" denote here all representative
worship separate from internal, thus what is idolatrous. Again: The high
places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed; the thorn
and the thistle shall come up on their altars (Hos. 10:8), where
"altars" denote idolatrous worship. In Amos: In the day that I shall
visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the
altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off (Amos
3:14), where again "altars" denote representative worship become
idolatrous. \[5\] In David: Let them bring me unto the mountain of Thy
holiness, and to Thy tabernacles. And I will go unto the altar of God,
unto God the gladness of my joy (Ps. 43:3-4), where "altar" manifestly
denotes the Lord. Thus the building of an altar in the Ancient and in
the Jewish Church was for a representative of the Lord. As the worship
of the Lord was performed principally by burnt-offerings and sacrifices,
and thus these things signified principally representative worship, it
is evident that the altar itself signifies this representative worship
itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="922.">922.</span></span>

And took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl. That this
signifies the goods of charity and the truths of faith, has been shown
above; that "beast" signifies the goods of charity (n. 45-46, 142-143,
246); and that "fowl" signifies the truths of faith (n. 40, 776).
Burnt-offerings were made of oxen, of lambs and goats, and of
turtledoves and young pigeons (Lev. 1:3-17; Num. 15:2-15;
28:1-31).1:3-17; Num. 15:2-15, 28:1-31). These were clean beasts, and
each one of them signified some special heavenly thing. And because they
signified these things in the Ancient Church and represented them in the
churches that followed, it is evident that burnt-offerings and
sacrifices were nothing else than representatives of internal worship;
and that when they were separated from internal worship they became
idolatrous. This anyone of sound reason may see. For what is an altar
but something of stone, and what is burnt-offering and sacrifice but the
slaying of a beast? If there be Divine worship, it must represent
something heavenly which they know and acknowledge, and from which they
worship Him whom they represent. \[2\] That these were representatives
of the Lord no one can be ignorant, unless he is unwilling to understand
anything about the Lord. It is by internal things, namely, charity and
the faith therefrom, that He who is represented is to be seen and
acknowledged and believed, as is clearly evident in the Prophets, for
example, in Jeremiah: Thus saith Jehovah of armies, the God of Israel,
Add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh for I
spake not unto your fathers, and I commanded them not in the day that I
brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings and
sacrifices but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken unto My
voice, and I will be your God (Jer. 7:21-23). To "hearken to" or obey,
"the voice" is to obey the law, which all relates to the one command: to
love God above all things, and the neighbor as one's self; for in this
is the Law and the Prophets (Matt. 22:35-40; 7:12). In David: O Jehovah,
sacrifice and offering Thou hast not desired, burnt-offering and
sin-offering hast Thou not required; I have desired to do Thy will, O my
God; yea, Thy law is within my heart (Ps. 40:7, 9). \[3\] In Samuel, who
said to Saul, Hath Jehovah as great pleasure in burnt-offerings and
sacrifices as in hearkening to the voice of Jehovah? behold, to obey is
better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams (1 Sam.
15:22). What is meant by " hearkening to the voice" may be seen in
Micah: Shall I come before Jehovah with burnt-offerings, with calves of
a year old? will Jehovah be pleased with thousands of rams, with ten
thousands of rivers of oil? He hath showed thee, O man, what is good;
and what doth Jehovih require of thee, but to do judgment, and to love
mercy; and to humble thyself in walking with thy God? (Micah 6:6-8).
This is what is signified by "burnt-offerings and sacrifices of clean
beasts and birds." So in Amos: Though you offer Me your burnt-offerings
and gifts I will not accept them neither will I regard the
peace-offering of your fat ones; let judgment flow like waters, and
righteousness like a mighty river (Amos 5:22, 24). "Judgment" is truth,
and "righteousness" is good, both from charity, and these are the
"burnt-offerings and sacrifices" of the internal man. In Hosea: For I
desire mercy and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than
burnt-offerings (Hosea 6:. 6). From these passages it is evident what
sacrifices and burnt-offerings are where there is no charity and faith;
and it is also evident that clean beasts and clean birds represented,
because they signified, the goods of charity and of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="923.">923.</span></span>

And he offered burnt-offerings on the altar. That this signifies all
worship therefrom, is evident from what has been already said.
Burnt-offerings were the principal things of the worship of the
representative church, and so thereafter were sacrifices, concerning
which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. That "burnt-offerings"
taken in the complex signify representative worship, is evident also in
the Prophets, as in David: Jehovah will send thee help from the
sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion; He will remember all thy
offerings, and accept as fat thy burnt-offering (Ps. 20:2, 3). In
Isaiah: Whoso keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, them will I bring
in to My holy mountain; their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall
be accepted upon Mine altar (Isa. 56:6, 7), where "burnt-offerings and
sacrifices" denote all worship; "burnt-offerings" worship from love,
"sacrifices" worship from the derivative faith. As is usual in the
Prophets," internal things are here described by external.

Verse 21. And Jehovah smelled an odor of rest; and Jehovah said in His
heart, I will not again curse the ground anymore on man's account;
because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither
will I again smite anymore everything living, as I have done. "And
Jehovah smelled an odor of rest" signifies that worship therefrom was
grateful to the Lord, that is, worship from charity and the faith of
charity; "and Jehovah said in His heart" signifies that it would happen
so no more; "I will not again curse the ground anymore" signifies that
man would not anymore so turn himself away; "on man's account" signifies
as did the man of the posterity of the Most Ancient Church; "because the
imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth" signifies that man's
will is altogether evil; "neither will I again smite anymore everything
living, as I have done" signifies that man would not be able anymore so
to destroy himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="925.">925.</span></span>

And Jehovah smelled an odor of rest. That this signifies that worship
therefrom was grateful to the Lord, that is, worship from charity and
the faith of charity, which is signified by "burnt-offering" has been
stated under the preceding verse. It is often said in the Word that
Jehovah "smelled an odor of rest" especially from burnt-offerings; and
this always means what is grateful or acceptable; as that He "smelled an
odor of rest" from burnt-offerings (Exod. 29:18, 25, 41; Lev. 1:9, 13,
17; 33:12, 13, 18; Num. 28:6, 8, 13; 29:2, 6, 8, 13, 36), and also from
other sacrifices (Lev. 2:2, 9; 6:15, 21, 8:21, 28; Num. 15:3, 7, 13).
They are also called "made by fire for an odor of rest unto Jehovah" by
which is signified that they are from love and charity. "Fire" in the
Word and "made by fire" when predicated of the Lord and of the worship
of Him, signifies love. So also does "bread" and for this reason
representative worship by burnt-offerings and sacrifices is called "the
bread of the offering made by fire for an odor of rest" (Lev. 3:11, 16).
\[2\] That an "odor" signifies what is grateful and acceptable, and thus
that an odor in the Jewish Church was a representative of what is
grateful, and is ascribed to Jehovah or the Lord, is because the good of
charity and the truth of faith from charity correspond to sweet and
delightful odors. The fact of this correspondence and the nature of it
is demonstrable from the spheres of spirits and angels in heaven, where
there are spheres of love and faith which are plainly perceived. The
spheres are such that when a good spirit or angel, or a society of good
spirits or of angels, comes near, then, whenever the Lord pleases, it is
at once perceived, even at a distance, but more sensibly on a nearer
approach, what is the quality in respect to love and faith of that
spirit, angel, or society. This is incredible, yet is perfectly true.
Such is the communication in the other life, and such is the perception.
Wherefore, when it pleases the Lord, there is no need to explore in many
ways the quality of a soul or spirit; for it may be known at his first
approach. To these spheres correspond the spheres of odors in the world.
That they do so correspond is evident from the fact that when it pleases
the Lord the spheres of love and faith in the world of spirits are
turned into spheres of sweet and pleasing odors, and are plainly
perceived. \[3\] From these things it is now evident whence and why "an
odor of rest" signifies what is grateful, and why an odor became
representative in the Jewish Church, and why "an odor of rest" is here
ascribed to Jehovah or the Lord. An odor of rest is one of peace, or a
grateful sense of peace. Peace taken in the complex embraces all things
of the Lord's kingdom both in general and in particular, for the state
of the Lord's kingdom is a state of peace, and in a state of peace there
come forth all the happy states that result from love and faith in the
Lord. From what has now been said it is plain not only how it is with
representatives, but also why in the Jewish Church incense was used, for
which there was an altar before the veil and the mercy-seat; why there
were offerings of frankincense in the sacrifices; also why so many
spices were used in the incense, in the frankincense, and in the oil for
anointing; and thus what is signified in the Word by "an odor of rest"
"incense" and "spices" namely, the celestial things of love and the
spiritual things of faith therefrom; in general, whatever is grateful
from love and faith. \[4\] As in Ezekiel: In the mountain of My
holiness, in the mountain of the height of Israel, there shall all the
house of Israel in the whole land serve Me; there will I accept them,
and there will I seek your oblations and the first fruits of your gifts,
with all your holy things; as an odor of rest will I accept you (Ezek.
20:40-41). Here "an odor of rest" is predicated of burnt-offerings and
gifts, that is, of worship from charity and its faith, which is
signified by the burnt-offerings and gifts, and is consequently
acceptable, which is meant by the "odor." In Amos: I hate, I have
rejected your feasts, and I will not receive the odor of your holidays,
for if ye shall offer Me your burnt-offerings and gifts, they shall not
be acceptable (Amos 5:21-22). Here "odor" manifestly signifies what is
grateful or acceptable. Of Isaac when blessing Jacob instead of Esau it
is said: And Jacob came near, and he kissed him; and he smelled the
smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my
son is as the smell of a field which Jehovah hath blessed (Gen. 27:27).
The "smell of his raiment" signifies natural good and truth, which is
grateful from its agreement with celestial and spiritual good and truth,
the gratefulness of which is described by the "smell of a field."

<span class="margnote"><span id="926.">926.</span></span>

Jehovah said in His heart. That this signifies that it would happen so
no more, is evident from what follows. When it is predicated of Jehovah
that He "says" nothing else is meant than that what He says is or takes
place so, or not so, for of Jehovah nothing else can be said than that
He is. Whatever is predicated of Jehovah in various places in the Word,
is so expressed for the sake of those who can apprehend nothing except
from such things as are in man, and therefore the sense of the letter is
of this nature. The simple in heart may be instructed from the
appearances with man, for they scarcely go beyond the knowledges that
are derived from things of sense, and therefore the language of the Word
is adapted to their apprehension; as here, where it is said that
"Jehovah said in His heart."

<span class="margnote"><span id="927.">927.</span></span>

I will not again curse the ground anymore on man's account. That this
signifies that man would not anymore so turn away, as did the man of the
posterity of the Most Ancient Church, is evident from what has been said
before about this posterity. That "to curse" signifies in the internal
sense to turn oneself away, may be seen above (n. 223, 245). How the
case is with this and with what follows: that man would not anymore so
turn away, as did the man of the Most Ancient Church, and that he would
not again be able so to destroy himself, is evident from what has been
already said about the posterity of the Most Ancient Church who
perished, and about the new church which is called "Noah." \[2\] It has
been shown that the man of the Most Ancient Church was so constituted
that the will and understanding with him formed one mind, or that with
him love was implanted in his will part, and thus at the same time
faith, which filled the other or intellectual part of his mind. From
this their posterity inherited the condition that the will and the
understanding made a one; and therefore when the love of self and the
consequent insane cupidities began to take possession of their will part
(where previously there had been love to the Lord and charity toward the
neighbor), not only did their will part or will become utterly
perverted, but so also together with it did their intellectual part or
understanding, and this was still more the case when the last posterity
immersed their falsities in their cupidities, and so became "Nephilim"
for thereby they became of such a nature that they could not be
restored, because both parts of the mind (that is, the whole mind) had
been ruined. But as this had been foreseen by the Lord, He had also
provided for man's upbuilding, in this way, that he might be reformed
and regenerated in respect to the second or intellectual part of the
mind, in which there might be implanted a new will which is conscience,
and through which the Lord might work the good of love (that is, of
charity), and the truth of faith. Thus of the Lord's Divine mercy has
man been restored. These are the things that are signified in this verse
by, "I will not again curse the ground anymore on man's account; because
the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I
smite anymore everything living, as I have done."

<span class="margnote"><span id="928.">928.</span></span>

Because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth. That this
signifies that man's will part is utterly evil, is evident from what has
just been said. The "imagination of the heart" signifies nothing else.
Man supposes that he has a will for what is good, but he is quite
mistaken. When he does good, it is not from his will, but from a new
will which is the Lord's; thus it is from the Lord that he does it.
Consequently when he thinks and speaks what is true, it is from a new
understanding, which is from the new will, and it is from the Lord that
he does this also. For the regenerate man is an altogether new man
formed by the Lord, and this is why he is said to be created anew.

<span class="margnote"><span id="929.">929.</span></span>

Neither will I again smite anymore everything living, as I have done.
That this signifies that man would not be able anymore so to destroy
himself, is now evident, for such is the case when man is regenerated,
seeing that he is then withheld from the evil and falsity that is with
him, and then perceives no otherwise than that he does what is good and
thinks what is true from himself. This however is an appearance, or
fallacy, owing to his being withheld (as indeed he is, powerfully), and
in consequence of being thus withheld from evil and falsity, he cannot
destroy himself; but if he were in the least let go, or left to himself,
he would rush into all evil and falsity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="930.">930.</span></span>

Verse 22. During all the days of the earth, seed-time and harvest, and
cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night, shall not
cease. "During all the days of the earth" signifies all time; "seed-time
and harvest" signifies the man who is to be regenerated, and hence the
church; "cold and heat" signifies the state of the man when he is being
regenerated, which is like this in respect to the reception of faith and
charity; "cold" signifies no faith and charity, "heat" faith and
charity; "summer and winter" signifies the state of the regenerate man
in respect to what is of his new will, the alternations of which are as
summer and winter; "day and night" signifies the state of the same
regenerate man in respect to what is of his understanding, the
alternations of which are as day and night; "shall not cease" means that
this shall be the case in all time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="931.">931.</span></span>

During all the days of the earth. That this signifies all time, is
evident from the signification of "day" as being a time (see n. 23, 487,
488, 493); wherefore "the days of the earth" here mean all time so long
as there is earth \[terra\], or inhabitant upon the earth \[tellure\].
An inhabitant first ceases to be on the earth when there is no longer
any church. For when there is no church, there is no longer any
communication of man with heaven, and when this communication ceases,
every inhabitant perishes. As we have seen before, it is with the church
as with the heart and lungs in man: so long as the heart and lungs are
sound, so long the man lives; and such also is the case with the Grand
Man, which is the universal heaven, so long as the church lives; and
therefore it is here said "during all the days of the earth, seed-time
and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night
shall not cease." From this it also may appear that the earth will not
endure to eternity, but that it too will have its end; for it is said,
"during all the days of the earth" that is, as long as the earth
endures. \[2\] But as to believing that the end of the earth will be the
same thing as the last judgment, foretold in the Word-where the
consummation of the age, the day of visitation, and the last judgment
are described-this is a mistake; for there is a last judgment of every
church when it has been vastated, or when there is no longer in it any
faith. The last judgment of the Most Ancient Church was when it
perished, as in its last posterity just before the flood. The last
judgment of the Jewish Church was when the Lord came into the world.
There will also be a last judgment when the Lord shall come in glory;
not that the earth and the world are then to perish, but that the church
perishes; and then a new church is always raised up by the Lord; as at
the time of the flood was the Ancient Church, and at the time of the
coming of the Lord the primitive church of the Gentiles. \[3\] So also
will there be a new church when the Lord shall come in glory, which is
also meant by the new heaven and new earth, in like manner as with every
regenerate man, who becomes a man of the church, or a church, and whose
internal man, when he has been created anew, is called a new heaven, and
his external man a new earth. Moreover there is also a last judgment for
every man when he dies, for then, according to what he has done in the
body, he is adjudged either to death or to life. That nothing else is
meant, consequently not the destruction of the world, by the
consummation of the age, the end of days, or the last judgment, is
clearly evident from the words of the Lord in Luke: In that night there
shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other shall
be left; there shall be two women grinding together, the one shall be
taken, and the other shall be left (Luke 17:34-36), where the last time
is called "night" because there is no faith, that is, no charity; and
where by some being "left" it is clearly indicated that the world will
not then perish.

That "seed-time and harvest" signify man who is to be regenerated, and
thus the church, there is no need to confirm from the Word, because it
occurs so often that man is compared and likened to a field, and thus to
a sowing or seed-time, and the Word of the Lord to seed, and the effect
to the produce or harvest, as everyone comprehends from the forms of
speech thus made familiar. In general every man is here treated of-that
there never will be lacking to him the sowing of seed from the Lord,
whether he be within the church or without; that is, whether he be
acquainted with the Word of the Lord, or be not acquainted with it.
Without seed sown by the Lord, man can do nothing of good. All the good
of charity, even with the Gentiles, is seed from the Lord; and although
with these there is not the good of faith, as there may be within the
church, yet there may come the good of faith; for in the other life
those Gentiles who have lived in charity, as Gentiles are wont to do in
this world, when instructed by angels, embrace and receive the doctrine
of true faith and the faith of charity much more easily than do
Christians; concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter.
Specifically, however, the subject treated of here is the man who is to
be regenerated, that is to say that there will be no such thing as a
failure of the church to come forth somewhere on the earth, which is
here signified by there being seed-time and harvest all the days of the
earth. That seed-time and harvest, or the church, will always come into
existence, has regard to what was said in the preceding verse, namely,
that man will no more be able so to destroy himself as was done by the
last posterity of the Most Ancient Church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="933.">933.</span></span>

That "cold and heat" signifies the state of man when he is being
regenerated, which is like this in regard to the reception of faith and
charity, and that "cold" signifies no faith and charity, and "heat"
charity, is evident from the signification of "cold" and "heat" in the
Word, where they are predicated of a man about to be regenerated, or
being regenerated, or of the church. The same is also evident from the
connection, that is, from what precedes and what follows; for the
subject is the church (in the preceding verse that man would not again
be able so to destroy himself, in this verse that some church will
always come into existence), which is first described as to the way it
comes into existence, that is, when the man is being regenerated so as
to become a church, and then the quality of the regenerated man is
treated of; so that the treatment of the subject covers every state of
the man of the church. \[2\] That his state when regenerated is as
described, namely, a state of cold and heat, or of no faith and charity,
and again of faith and charity, may not be so evident to anyone except
from experience, and indeed from reflection in regard to the experience.
And because there are few who are being regenerated, and among those who
are being regenerated few if any who reflect, or who are able to reflect
on the state of their regeneration, we may say a few words on the
subject. When man is being regenerated, he receives life from the Lord;
for before this he cannot be said to have lived, the life of the world
and of the body not being life, but only that which is heavenly and
spiritual. Through regeneration man receives real life from the Lord;
and because he had no life before, there is an alternation of no life
and of real life, that is, of no faith and charity, and of some faith
and charity; no charity and faith being here signified by "cold" and
some faith and charity by "heat." \[3\] As regards this subject the case
is this: Whenever man is in his corporeal and worldly things, there is
then no faith and charity, that is, there is "cold" for then corporeal
and worldly things, consequently those which are his own, are at work,
and so long as the man is in these, he is absent or remote from faith
and charity, so that he does not even think about heavenly and spiritual
things. The reason of this is that heavenly and corporeal things can
never be together in a man, for man's will has been utterly ruined. But
when the things of man's body and will are not at work, but are
quiescent, then the Lord works through his internal man, and then he is
in faith and charity, which is here called "heat." When he again returns
into the body he is again in cold; and when the body, or what is of the
body, is quiescent, and as nothing, he is then in heat, and so on in
alternation. For such is the condition of man that heavenly and
spiritual things cannot be in him along with his corporeal and worldly
things, but there are alternations. This is what takes place with
everyone who is to be regenerated, and it goes on as long as he is in a
state of regeneration; for in no other way is it possible for man to be
regenerated, that is, from being dead to be made alive, for the reason,
as already said, that his will has been utterly ruined, and is therefore
completely separated from the new will, which he receives from the Lord
and which is the Lord's and not the man's. Hence now it is evident what
is here signified by "cold and heat." \[4\] That such is the case every
regenerated man may know from experience, that is to say, that when he
is in corporeal and worldly things, he is absent and remote from
internal things, so that he not only takes no thought about them, but
feels in himself cold at the thought of them; but that when corporeal
and worldly things are quiescent, he is in faith and charity. He may
also know from experience that these states alternate, and that
therefore when corporeal and worldly things begin to be in excess and to
want to rule, he comes into straits and temptations, until he is reduced
into such a state that the external man becomes compliant to the
internal, a compliance it can never render until it is quiescent and as
it were nothing. The last posterity of the Most Ancient Church could not
be regenerated, because, as before said, with them the things of the
understanding and of the will constituted one mind; and therefore the
things of their understanding could not be separated from those of their
will, so that they might in this manner be by turns in heavenly and
spiritual things, and in corporeal and worldly things; but they had
continual cold in regard to heavenly things and continual heat in regard
to cupidities, so that they could have no alternation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="934.">934.</span></span>

That "cold" signifies no love, or no charity and faith, and that "heat"
or "fire" signifies love, or charity and faith, is evident from the
following passages in the Word. In John it is said to the church in
Laodicea: I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would
thou wert cold or hot; so because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold
nor hot, I will spew thee out of My mouth (Rev. 3:15-16); where "cold"
denotes no charity, and "hot" much charity. In Isaiah: Thus hath Jehovah
said unto me, I will be still, and I will behold in My place; like the
clear heat upon the light, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest
(Isa. 18:4), where the subject is the new church to be planted; "heat
upon the light" and "heat of harvest" denote love and charity. Again:
Saith Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem (Isa.
31:9), where "fire" denotes love. Of the cherubim seen by Ezekiel it is
said: As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was
like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches; it went up
and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of
the fire went forth lightning (Ezek. 1:13). \[2\] And again it is said
of the Lord, in the same chapter: And above the expanse that was over
their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a
sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of a throne was a likeness as the
appearance of a man above upon it; and I saw as the appearance of
burning coal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the
appearance of His loins and upward; and from the appearance of His loins
and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was
brightness round about Him (Ezek. 1:26-27; 8:2). Here again "fire"
denotes love. In Daniel: The Ancient of days did sit; His throne was
flames of fire, and the wheels thereof burning fire; a fiery stream
issued and came forth from before Him, a thousand thousands ministered
unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him (Dan.
7:9-10).Here "fire" denotes the Lord's love. In Zechariah: For I, saith
Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round about (Zech. 2:5), where
the new Jerusalem is treated of. In David: Jehovah maketh His angels
spirits, His ministers a flaming fire (Ps. 104:4), "a flaming fire"
denoting the celestial spiritual. \[3\] Because "fire" signified love,
fire was also made a representative of the Lord, as is evident from the
fire on the altar of burnt-offering which was never to be extinguished
(Lev. 6:12-13), representing the mercy of the Lord. On this account,
before Aaron went in to the mercy-seat, he was to burn incense with fire
taken from the altar of burnt-offering (Lev. 16:12-14). And for the same
reason, that it might be signified that worship was accepted by the
Lord, fire was sent down from heaven and consumed the burnt-offering (as
in Lev. 9:24, and elsewhere). By "fire" is also signified in the Word
self-love and its cupidity, with which heavenly love cannot agree; and
therefore the two sons of Aaron were consumed by fire, because they
burned incense with strange fire (Lev. 10:1-2). "Strange fire" is all
the love of self and of the world, and all the cupidity of these loves.
Moreover, heavenly love appears to the wicked no otherwise than as a
burning and consuming fire, and therefore in the Word a consuming fire
is predicated of the Lord, as the fire on Mount Sinai, which represented
the love, or mercy, of the Lord, and that was seen by the people as a
consuming fire, and therefore they desired Moses not to let them hear
the voice of Jehovah God, and see that great fire, lest they should die
(Deut. 18:16). The love or mercy of the Lord has this appearance to
those who are in the fire of the loves of self and of the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="935.">935.</span></span>

That "summer and winter" signify the state of the regenerate man as to
his new will, the alternations of which are as summer and winter, is
evident from what has been said about cold and heat. The alternations
with those who are to be regenerated are likened to cold and heat, but
the alternations with those who have been regenerated are likened to
summer and winter. That in the former case the man who is to be
regenerated is treated of, and in the present case the man who has been
regenerated, is evident from this, that in the one case cold is named
first, and heat second; whereas in the other case summer is first named,
and winter second. The reason is that a man who is being regenerated
begins from cold, that is, from no faith and charity; but when he has
been regenerated, he begins from charity. \[2\] That there are
alternations with the regenerate man-now no charity, and now some
charity-is clearly evident for the reason that in everyone, even when
regenerated, there is nothing but evil, and everything good is the
Lord's alone. And since there is nothing but evil in him, he cannot but
undergo alternations and now be as it were in summer, that is, in
charity, and now in winter, that is, in no charity. Such alternations
exist in order that man may be perfected more and more, and thus be
rendered more and more happy, and they take place with the regenerate
man not only while he lives in the body, but also when he comes into the
other life, for without alternations as of summer and winter as to what
is of his will, and as of day and night as to what is of his
understanding, he cannot possibly be perfected and rendered more happy;
but in the other life these alternations are like those of summer and
winter in the temperate zones, and those of day and night in springtime.
\[3\] These states are also described in the Prophets by "summer and
winter" and by "day and night;" as in Zechariah: And it shall come to
pass in that day that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of
them toward the eastern sea, and half of them toward the western sea; in
summer and in winter shall it be (Zech. 14:8),where the New Jerusalem is
treated of, or the kingdom of the Lord in heaven and on earth, that is,
its state of both kinds, which is called "summer and winter." In David:
The day is Thine, the night also is Thine; Thou hast prepared the light
and the sun, Thou hast set all the borders of the earth, Thou hast made
summer and winter (Ps. 74:16-17), where like things are involved. So in
Jeremiah: That the covenant of the day, and the covenant of the night be
not made vain, that there may be day and night in their season (Jer.
33:20).

<span class="margnote"><span id="936.">936.</span></span>

That "day and night" signify the state of the same, that is, of the
regenerate man, as to the things of the understanding, the alternations
of which are as day and night, is evident from what has just been said.
"Summer and winter" are predicated of what is of the will, from their
cold and heat; for so it is with the things of the will. But "day and
night" are predicated of what is of the understanding, from their light
and darkness; for so it is with the things of the understanding. As
these things are self-evident, there is no need to confirm them by other
like passages from the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="937.">937.</span></span>

From all this it is evident what the nature of the Lord's Word is in the
internal sense. In the sense of the letter it appears so unpolished as
to give no hint of anything being spoken of but seed-time and harvest,
cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night, when yet all these
things involve arcana of the Ancient, that is, of the Spiritual, Church.
The very words in the sense of the letter are of this character, thus
are so to speak most general vessels, each one of which contains so many
and such great arcana of heaven as to be inexhaustible even as to the
one ten-thousandth part of it; for in these most general words, taken as
they are from earthly things, the angels-from the Lord-can see, in
illimitable variety, the whole process of regeneration, and the state of
the man who is to be and who has been regenerated, while man can see
scarcely anything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="938.">938.</span></span>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE HELLS. HERE, CONCERNING THE HELLS OF THE
AVARICIOUS, THE FILTHY JERUSALEM, AND THE ROBBERS IN A DESERT. ALSO
CONCERNING THE EXCREMENTITIOUS HELLS OF THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED IN MERE
PLEASURES. The avaricious are of all men the most sordid, and think the
least about the life after death, the soul, and the internal man. They
do not even know what heaven is, because of all men they least elevate
their thoughts, but sink them and immerse them wholly in corporeal and
earthly things. Wherefore when they come into the other life they do not
know for a long time that they are spirits, but suppose that they are
still altogether in the body. The ideas of their thought which from
their avarice have become as it were corporeal and earthly, are turned
into direful phantasies. It seems incredible, yet is true, that in the
other life the sordidly avaricious seem to themselves to be busy in
cellars where their money is, and to be infested there by mice; yet
however they may be infested they do not withdraw until they are wearied
out, and so at last they work their way out of these tombs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="939.">939.</span></span>

What sordid phantasies the ideas of thought of those who have been
sordidly avaricious are turned into, is evident from their hell, which
is deep under foot. A vapor exhales from it like that from hogs whose
bristles are being scraped off in a scalding trough. There are the homes
of the avaricious. Those who come thither at first appear black, but by
the scraping off of their hair, as is done with hogs, they seem to
themselves to become white. So they then appear to themselves, but still
there remains therefrom a mark by which they are known wherever they go.
A certain black spirit who had not yet been brought to his own hell,
because he had to make a longer stay in the world of spirits, being let
down thither (although he had not been so avaricious as the rest, and
yet had in his lifetime wickedly panted for the wealth of others), on
his arrival the avaricious there fled away, saying that he was a robber,
because he was black, and would kill them. For the avaricious flee from
such spirits, being especially fearful of losing their lives. At length,
having found out that he was not such a robber, they told him that if he
wished to become white he merely had to have the hair taken off, like
the swine-which were in full view-and then he would be white. But as he
did not desire this, he was taken up among spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="940.">940.</span></span>

In this hell are for the most part Jews who have been sordidly
avaricious, whose presence too when they come to other spirits is
perceived as the stench of mice. In regard to the Jews something may be
said about their cities and the robbers in the desert, to show how
miserable is their state after death, especially that of those who have
been sordidly avaricious and have despised others in comparison with
themselves in consequence of their inborn arrogance in thinking
themselves to be the only chosen people. In consequence of having
conceived and confirmed in themselves, during their life in the body,
the phantasy that they shall go to Jerusalem, and the Holy Land, to
possess it (not being disposed to understand that by the New Jerusalem
is meant the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth), there appears
to them, when they come into the other world, a city on the left of
Gehenna, a little in front, to which they flock in crowds. This city,
however, being miry and fetid, is called the filthy Jerusalem; and here
they run about the streets, over the ankles in dirt and mud, pouring out
complaints and lamentations. They see these cities-indeed I have
sometimes seen them myself-and the streets therein, with all their
defilements, represented as in open day. There once appeared to me a
certain spirit of a dusky hue coming from this filthy Jerusalem, the
gate seeming as it were to be opened. He was encompassed about with
wandering stars, especially on his left side; wandering stars around a
spirit signifying in the spiritual world falsities, but it is different
when the stars are not wandering. He approached, and applied himself to
the upper part of my left ear, which he seemed to touch with his mouth,
in order to speak with me; but he did not speak in a sonorous tone of
voice like others, but within himself, nevertheless in such a manner
that I could hear and understand. He said that he was a Jewish Rabbi,
adding that he had been in that miry city for a long time, and that the
streets thereof were nothing but mud and dirt. He said also there was
nothing to eat in it but dirt, and on my asking why he who was a spirit
desired to eat, he replied that he did eat, and that when he desired to
eat, nothing was offered him but mud, which grieved him exceedingly. He
inquired what he must do, having in vain tried to meet with Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob. I related to him some particulars respecting them,
informing him it was in vain to seek for them, and that even if they
were found, they could not possibly afford him any assistance. After
adverting to matters of deeper import, I said that no one ought to be
sought after but the Lord alone, who is the Messiah whom they had
despised on earth; and that He rules the universal heaven and the
universal earth, and that help comes from Him alone. He then asked
anxiously and repeatedly where the Lord was. I replied that He is to be
found everywhere, and that He hears and knows all men. But at that
instant other Jewish spirits drew him away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="941.">941.</span></span>

There is also another city on the right of Gehenna, or between Gehenna
and the Lake, where the better sort of the Jews seem to themselves to
dwell. But this city is changed to them according to their phantasies,
sometimes being turned into villages, at others into a lake, and again
into a city; and its inhabitants are much afraid of robbers, but so long
as they remain in the city they are secure. Between the two cities there
is a kind of triangular space, dark, where are robbers, who are Jews,
but of the worst sort, who cruelly torture whomsoever they meet. The
Jews out of fear call these robbers the Lord, and the desert in which
they reside they call the Land. As a security against the robbers, at
the entrance into the city, on the right, there is a good spirit
stationed, in the extreme corner, who receives all comers, and before
whom, as they arrive, they bow themselves toward the earth. They are
admitted under his feet, this being the ceremony of admittance into this
city. A certain spirit approaching me suddenly; I demanded whence he
came? He replied that he was making his escape from the robbers, whom he
feared, because they kill, slaughter, burn, and boil men, inquiring
where he might be safe. I asked whence and from what country he came? In
his terror he dared not give me any other answer than that it was the
Lord's Land, for they call that desert the Land, and the robbers the
Lord. Afterwards the robbers presented themselves. They were very black,
and spoke in a deep tone of voice like giants, and, strange to say, when
they come they induce a sense of dread and horror. I asked them who they
were? They said they were in quest of plunder. I inquired what they
meant to do with their plunder, and whether they did not know that they
were spirits, and therefore could neither seize upon nor amass plunder,
and that such notions are the phantasies of the evil? They replied, that
they were in the desert in quest of booty, and that they torture
whomsoever they meet. At last they acknowledged, while they were with
me, that they were spirits, but still could not be brought to believe
that they were not still living in the body. Those who thus wander about
are Jews, who threaten to kill, slaughter, burn, and boil whomsoever
they meet, even though they are Jews, and friends. Their disposition was
thus made known, although in the world they dare not divulge it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="942.">942.</span></span>

Not far from the filthy Jerusalem there is still another city which is
called the Judgment of Gehenna, where those dwell who claim heaven as
due to their own righteousness, and condemn others who do not live
according to their phantasies. Between this city and Gehenna there
appears as if there were a rather handsome bridge, of a pale or gray
color; where there is a black spirit, whom they fear, and who prevents
their passing over, for on the other side of the bridge appears Gehenna.

<span class="margnote"><span id="943.">943.</span></span>

Those who in the life of the body have made mere pleasures their end and
aim, loving merely to indulge their natural propensities, and to live in
luxury and festivity, caring only for themselves and the world, without
any regard to things Divine, and who are devoid of faith and charity,
are after death first introduced into a life similar to that which they
had in the world. There is a place in front toward the left, at a
considerable depth, where all is pleasure, sports, dancing, feasting,
and chatting together. Hither such spirits are conveyed, and then they
know no otherwise than that they are still in the world. After a short
time however the scene is changed, and then they are carried down to a
hell beneath the buttocks which is merely excrementitious; for in the
other life such exclusively corporeal pleasure is turned into what is
excrementitious. I have seen them there carrying dung and bemoaning
their lot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="944.">944.</span></span>

Women who from low and mean condition have become rich, and in their
pride have given themselves up to pleasures and a life of delicacy and
ease, reclining on couches like queens, sitting at tables and banquets,
and caring for nothing else, when they come into the other life have
wretched quarrels with one another-they beat and tear each other, they
drag each other by the hair, and become like furies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="945.">945.</span></span>

It is otherwise with those who have been born into the pleasures and
enjoyments of life, and who have been educated in such things from
childhood, such as queens, and others of noble family, and also those of
wealthy parentage. These, though they have lived in luxury, splendor,
and elegance, provided they have lived at the same time in faith in the
Lord and charity toward the neighbor, are among the happy in the other
life. For to deprive oneself of the enjoyments of life, of power, and of
riches, and to think thus to merit heaven by wretchedness, is a false
course. But to esteem pleasures and power and riches as nothing in
comparison with the Lord, and the life of the world as nothing in
comparison with heavenly life, this is what is meant in the Word by
renouncing these things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="946.">946.</span></span>

I have spoken with spirits concerning the fact that possibly few will
believe in the existence of so many and such wonderful things in the
other life, in consequence of the absence of any but a very general and
obscure conception - amounting to none at all-of the life after death,
and in which men have confirmed themselves by the consideration that
they do not see a soul or spirit with their eyes. Even the learned,
although they say there is a soul or spirit, so cleave to artificial
words and terms-which rather obscure or even extinguish the
understanding of things than assist it-and so devote themselves to self
and the world, and but rarely to the general welfare and to heaven, that
they believe still less than do sensuous men. The spirits to whom I
spoke marveled that men should be of such a character, seeing that they
are well aware of the existence in nature itself, and in each of its
kingdoms, of many wonderful and varied things about which they are
ignorant, as for example those in the internal human ear, concerning
which a book might be filled with things amazing and unheard of, and in
the existence of which everyone has faith. But if anything is said about
the spiritual world, from which come forth all things in the kingdoms of
nature both in general and in particular, scarcely anyone gives credence
to it, on account-as before said-of the preconceived and confirmed
opinion that because it is not seen it is nothing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="947.">947.</span></span>

CHAPTER 9 CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE HELLS HERE, CONCERNING OTHER
HELLS, DISTINCT FROM THOSE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED Those who are deceitful
and who suppose that they can obtain all things by deceitful craft, and
who have confirmed themselves in this idea by their success in the life
of the body, seem to themselves to dwell in a kind of tun or vat at the
left, which is called the Infernal Tun, over which there is a covering,
and outside of it a small globe on a pyramidal base, which they conceive
to be the universe, under their inspection and rule. Precisely thus does
it appear to them. Those of them who have deceitfully persecuted the
innocent are there for ages. I was told that some have remained there
already for twenty ages. <span id="fr_15"></span>[947-1](#fn_15.md) When
they are let out they are possessed with such phantasy that they suppose
the universe to be a globe about which they walk and which they trample
with their feet, believing themselves to be gods of the universe. I have
seen them at times and spoken with them about their phantasy; but as
they had been of this nature in the world, they could not be withdrawn
from it. I have also at times perceived with what subtle deceit they
could pervert the thoughts, turning them in a moment in other
directions, and substituting others, so that it could hardly be known
that it was done by them, and this so naturally as to be beyond belief.
Being of this character, these spirits are never admitted to men, for
they infuse their poison so clandestinely and secretly as not to be
noticeable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="948.">948.</span></span>

There is at the left another tun-as it appears to them-in which are some
who in the life of the body had supposed that when they did evil they
did good, and the converse; so that they had made good to consist in
evil. These remain there for a while, and then are deprived of
rationality, on the loss of which they are as if asleep, and what they
then do is not imputed to them; but yet they seem to themselves to be
awake. On their rationality being restored to them they return to
themselves and are as other spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="949.">949.</span></span>

Toward the left and in front there is a certain chamber in which there
is no light, but mere darkness, from which it is called the Dark
Chamber. In it are those who have longed for the goods of others,
continually hankering after them, and also whenever possible getting
possession of them under some specious claim, in the most conscienceless
manner. There are some there who when they lived in this world had been
in stations of much dignity, but had based the respect due to sagacity
on wily practices. In that chamber they consult together-just as when
they lived in the body-how to take other people in. The darkness there
they call delicious. I was shown the appearance of those who are there
and had acted fraudulently. As in clear daylight I saw what they at last
come to. Their faces are more hideous than those of the dead, ghastly in
hue like a corpse, and pitted with horrible cavities, the result of
living in the torment of anxiety.

<span class="margnote"><span id="950.">950.</span></span>

There was a phalanx of spirits rising up from the side of Gehenna on
high toward the front, from whose sphere it was perceived-for the
quality of spirits may be perceived from their sphere alone, at their
first approach-that they accounted the Lord as vile, and held all Divine
worship in contempt. Their speech was undulatory. One of them spoke in a
scandalous way against the Lord, and was at once cast down toward one
side of Gehenna. They were being carried from the front up overhead, in
the endeavor to meet with some with whom they might conjoin themselves
in an attempt to reduce others to subjection, but they were retarded on
the way, and were told to desist, because the attempt would be hurtful
to them, so they came to a halt. Then they were seen. They had black
faces, and had a white bandage round their heads, by which is signified
that they regard Divine worship-and therefore the Lord's Word-as black,
and useful only to keep the vulgar under the restraint of conscience.
Their abode is near Gehenna, where are flying dragons, not venomous,
from which it is called the Habitation of Dragons. But because they are
not deceitful, their hell is not so grievous. Such spirits ascribe all
things to themselves and their own prudence, and boast that they fear no
one. But they were shown that a mere hiss would terrify them and put
them to flight, for on a hiss being heard they thought in their terror
that all hell was rising to carry them off, and from heroes they
