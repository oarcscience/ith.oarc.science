### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="6251.">6251.</span></span>

And Joseph said unto his father. That this signifies an answer from
within, may be seen without explication, for by "Joseph" is meant the
internal (n. 6177); for when a man perceives, he then on making inquiry
with himself about anything, also answers himself from within. I have
also observed that when spirits have made inquiry with me, they received
an answer by merely looking into my thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6252.">6252.</span></span>

These are my sons, whom God hath given me here. That this signifies that
they were from the internal in the natural, is evident from the
representation of Joseph, whose sons they were, as being the internal
(see n. 6177, 6224); and from the signification of the "land of Egypt,"
meant by "here," as being the natural mind (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288,
5301), thus the natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6253.">6253.</span></span>

And he said, Take them I pray unto me. That this signifies that they
should accede to spiritual good, is evident from the signification of
"taking them to him," as being that they should accede; and from the
representation of Israel to whom they should accede, as being spiritual
good (n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6254.">6254.</span></span>

And I will bless them. That this signifies a prediction about good and
truth, is evident from the signification of "blessing," as being
prediction (see above, n. 6230), here about good and truth, which are
represented by Manasseh and Ephraim. As "to bless" is a very general
expression, it signifies various things; that it signifies also a
prediction, both about the good things that will happen, and about the
evil, is plain in the following chapter, where Israel foretold to his
sons what should befall them; to some, evil things, as to Reuben,
Simeon, and Levi; and to some, good things, as to Judah and Joseph. This
prediction is called a "blessing" in verse 28 of this chapter: "This is
what their father spake of them, and blessed them, everyone according to
his blessing he blessed them." That "blessing" denotes prediction, is
evident from the words in the first verse of the chapter: "Jacob called
his sons, and said, Be ye gathered together, and I will tell you what
shall happen to you in the extremity of the days."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6255.">6255.</span></span>

Verses 10-14. And the eyes of Israel were heavy with old age; he could
not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them and
embraced them. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy
faces, and lo God hath made me see thy seed also. And Joseph brought
them away from his thighs; and he bowed himself with his face to the
earth. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand on Israel's
left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand on Israel's right hand, and
brought them near unto him. And Israel put forth his right hand, and put
it upon Ephraim's head, and he was the younger; and his left hand upon
Manasseh's head; he put forth his hands crosswise; for Manasseh was the
firstborn. "And the eyes of Israel were heavy," signifies his obscure
perception; "with old age," signifies because at the end of the
representation; "he could not see," signifies no advertence; "and he
brought them near unto him," signifies presence; "and he kissed them,"
signifies conjunction from the affection of truth; "and embraced them,"
signifies conjunction from the affection of good; "and Israel said unto
Joseph," signifies elevation to the internal; "I had not thought to see
thy faces," signifies that he had had no hope of the influx of his love;
"and lo God hath made me see thy seed also," signifies that not only was
the influx of love perceived, but also the good and truth thence
derived; "and Joseph brought them away from his thighs," signifies the
good of the will and the truth of the intellectual in the natural from
the affection of love on the part of spiritual good; "and he bowed
himself with his face to the earth," signifies their humiliation; "and
Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand on Israel's left hand,"
signifies the truth of the intellectual as in the second place; "and
Manasseh in his left hand on Israel's right hand," signifies the good of
the will in the first place; "and brought them near unto him," signifies
adjunction; "and Israel put forth his right hand, and put it upon
Ephraim's head," signifies that he accounted truth as being in the first
place; "and he was the younger," signifies although it is in the second;
"and his left hand upon Manasseh's head," signifies that he accounted
good as being in the second place; "he put forth his hands crosswise,"
signifies thus not according to order; "for Manasseh was the firstborn,"
signifies since indeed good is in the prior place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6256.">6256.</span></span>

And the eyes of Israel were heavy. That this signifies his obscure
perception, is evident from the signification of "eyes," as being the
intellectual sight (see n. 2701, 4403-4421, 4083, 4086, 4339), as also
"seeing" (n. 6249); from the representation of Israel, as being
spiritual good in the natural (as above, n. 6253); and from the
signification of "being heavy," when said of the eyes, as being what is
obscure, thus obscure perception. That Israel was in obscure perception
when he blessed the sons of Joseph, is because he was at the end of the
representation; but in general, because that spiritual good which is
represented by Israel is in obscure perception; for it is from the
natural, where natural light rules, but not heavenly light, in which is
the spiritual and celestial good which is from the rational. Such is the
external man, which is also called natural. When spiritual good from the
natural is mentioned, they are meant who are in this good, namely, they
who are of the Lord's spiritual church, and therefore also this church
is represented by Israel (see n. 4286). That the spiritual, who are they
of that church, are relatively in obscurity, may be seen above (n. 2708,
2715, 2716, 2718, 2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3246, 3833, 4402); and being
in obscurity, they also put the truth that is of faith in the first
place, as here did Israel, in that he set Ephraim before Manasseh. \[2\]
The reason why the spiritual so believe is that they are introduced to
good by means of truth (n. 2954), and when they are being introduced,
they do not perceive good, because it flows into the affection of truth
from within, thus not into perception until they have been regenerated.
Hence also it is that they call the goods of charity the fruits of
faith; and yet those are but little solicitous about fruits who assert
that faith alone saves without good works, even in death's last hour, no
matter how the man had previously lived. It is evident that this is an
obscure perception with respect to good and truth. Nevertheless the case
is as follows: those who from principles derived from doctrine set faith
before charity, and yet live a life of charity, are they who are of the
Lord's spiritual church, and are saved; for in their life they set the
good of charity first, but in doctrine the truth of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6257.">6257.</span></span>

With old age. That this signifies because at the end of the
representation, is evident from the signification of "old age," as being
newness of representation (see n. 3254), thus the end of the former one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6258.">6258.</span></span>

He could not see. That this signifies no advertence, is evident from the
signification of "seeing," as being perception (see n. 6249), thus also
advertence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6259.">6259.</span></span>

And he brought them near unto him. That this signifies presence, is
evident from the signification of "bringing," as being to make present.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6260.">6260.</span></span>

And he kissed them. That this signifies conjunction from the affection
of truth, is evident from the signification of "kissing," as being
conjunction from affection (see n. 3573, 3574, 4215, 4353, 5929). That
it is from the affection of truth, is because it follows that "he
embraced them," by which is signified conjunction from the affection of
good, for "embracing" denotes a more interior and therefore a closer
affection than "kissing," as is the affection of good compared with the
affection of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6261.">6261.</span></span>

And embraced them. That this signifies conjunction from the affection of
good, is evident from the signification of "embracing," as being the
conjunction of love (n. 4351), thus conjunction from the affection of
good (as just above, n. 6260). That "embracing" denotes this affection
is very evident from the testifying of love by an embrace, which is an
act that flows from this; for every spiritual affection has a gesture in
man's body that corresponds to it, and this gesture is representative of
the affection. That this is also true of kissing (spoken of just above)
is known.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6262.">6262.</span></span>

And Israel said unto Joseph. That this signifies elevation to the
internal, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being
perception, and also influx (of which above). That it denotes elevation
is because the subject treated of in this verse is the influx of love,
and thus of good and truth from the internal, which influx is elevation
to the internal; for the external cannot be in love toward the internal,
except by means of influx and elevation from the internal. For the very
love which is felt in the external is of the internal, and because in
order to the producing of any effect every acting must have its reacting
or reciprocal, and the acting is the cause, and the reacting is the
thing caused, therefore reaction is also of action, as the thing caused
is of the cause; for all the force in the thing caused is from the
cause. This is the case with reaction in every single thing in universal
nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6263.">6263.</span></span>

I had not thought to see thy faces. That this signifies that he had no
hope of the influx of his love, is evident from the signification of
"faces," as being the interiors (see n. 358, 2434, 3527, 3573, 4066,
4796, 4798, 5695), thus the affections, for these shine forth chiefly
from the face (n. 4796, 5102), hence the "face of God" denotes the
Divine love, consequently mercy (n. 5585); and from the signification of
"I had not thought," as being that he had had no hope. That it is the
influx of love which is signified by "seeing the face," is also plain
from what precedes and what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6264.">6264.</span></span>

And lo God hath made me see thy seed also. That this signifies that not
only was the influx of love perceived, but also good and truth thence
derived, is evident from the representation of Manasseh and Ephraim, who
here are the "seed," as being the good of the will and the truth of the
intellectual (see n. 5354, 6222); and also from the signification of
"seed," as also being good and truth (n. 1610, 2848, 3310, 3373, 3671);
and because it is said, "I had not thought to see thy faces, and lo God
hath made me see thy seed also," it is signified that not only was the
influx of love perceived, but also the good and truth thence derived;
for by "seeing the faces" is signified the influx of love (n. 6263).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6265.">6265.</span></span>

And Joseph brought them away from his thighs. That this signifies the
good of the will and the truth of the intellectual from the affection of
love on the part of spiritual good, is evident from the representation
of Joseph, as being the internal celestial (see n. 5869, 5877); from the
representation of Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Joseph brought away, as
being the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual (n. 5354,
6222); and from the signification of "thighs," as being the affection of
love (n. 3021, 4277, 4280, 4575, 5050-5062). That it was "on the part of
spiritual good" is because they were brought away from Israel, who is
spiritual good (see n. 6253). By these things is signified that the
internal celestial removed the good of the will and the truth of the
intellectual from spiritual good, that is, from the affection of love
thereof, because Israel, by whom is represented spiritual good, had
caused this good and truth to approach to himself; besides their being
brought to him by Joseph, by whom is represented the internal celestial;
for which reason they were brought away, and were afterward brought
again by Joseph, as follows. The reason is, that there is in this way an
influx of love from the internal celestial through spiritual good into
them. For this is according to order, and hence this external ritual had
to be rigidly observed when they were to be blessed; for they were then
being presented before the Lord, from whom is the prediction here
signified by the "blessing" (see n. 6254). Hence then it is that Joseph
brought his sons from the thighs of his father, and himself afterward
brought them thither.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6266.">6266.</span></span>

And he bowed himself with his face to the earth. That this signifies
their humiliation, is evident from the signification of "bowing himself
with his face to the earth," as being interior humiliation (see n.
5682); for such bowing is a bodily act that corresponds to humiliation
of mind; hence they who adore God from the heart, thus bow themselves.
It is said "he bowed himself," because Joseph was in their stead, not
then before Israel, but before the Lord, from whom was the blessing by
Israel. That this was done by Joseph in their stead, is because such is
the case in things spiritual; the good of the will and the truth of the
intellectual in the natural cannot from themselves humble themselves
before the Lord, but only from the internal by means of influx; for
without influx through the internal into the natural, there is nothing
of will and understanding therein, and not even anything of life; for
the internal is the intermediate through which is life from the Lord
therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6267.">6267.</span></span>

And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand on Israel's left
hand. That this signifies the truth of the intellectual as in the second
place; and that Manasseh in his left hand on Israel's right hand
signifies the good of the will in the first place, is evident from the
representation of Ephraim, as being the truth of the intellectual, and
from the representation of Manasseh, as being the good of the will (n.
5354, 6222); and from the signification of the "right hand," as being to
be in the first place; and of the "left hand," as being to be in the
second place; as is manifest from all the usage in life. How the case
herein is will be shown in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6268.">6268.</span></span>

And brought them near unto him. That this signifies adjunction, is
evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6269.">6269.</span></span>

And Israel put forth his right hand, and put it upon Ephraim's head.
That this signifies that he accounted truth as being in the first place,
is evident from the signification of "putting forth his right hand," as
being to account in the first place (that the "right hand" denotes in
the first place, is manifest); and from the representation of Ephraim,
as being the intellectual, thus also the truth of faith, for this dwells
in man's intellectual part when there is sight there from the light of
heaven, thus spiritual sight (see n. 6222). It is set forth in this
verse, and also in verses 17-19, that Israel put his right hand on
Ephraim's head, and his left hand on Manasseh's head; and by this is
signified that he accounted the truth of faith as being in the first
place, and the good of charity in the second. The reason was that until
he has been regenerated, the spiritual man, who is represented by Israel
(n. 4286, 6256), supposes no otherwise; for he has a sensible
apprehension of what the truth of faith is, but not what the good of
charity is; because the latter flows in by an interior way, but the
former, by an exterior way, just as does memory-knowledge. \[2\] But
they who are not being regenerated say absolutely that faith is in the
first place, that is to say, that it is the essential of the church,
because in this way they can live as they desire, and still say that
they have hope of salvation. Hence also at this day charity has so
disappeared that the nature of it is known to scarcely anyone, and
consequently so has faith, for the one is not possible without the
other. If charity were in the first place, and faith in the second, the
aspect of the church would be different; for then no others would be
called Christians than those who live a life according to the truth of
faith, that is, a life of charity; and they would then also know what
charity is. Then too they would not make a number of churches by making
a distinction among them according to opinions about the truths of
faith; but they would say that there is one church, in which are all who
are in the good of life, not only those within the region where the
churches are, but also those who are outside of it. In this manner the
church would be an illustration about such things as belong to the
Lord's kingdom; for charity enlightens, and never faith without charity;
and the errors that are brought in by means of faith separated would be
clearly seen. \[3\] Hence it is evident how different an aspect the
church would have if the good of charity were in the first place, that
is, were the essential, and the truth of faith in the second, that is,
its formal. The aspect of the church would then be like that of the
Ancient Church, which made the church consist in charity, and had no
other doctrinals of the church than those of charity: from this they had
wisdom from the Lord. The quality of that church is described in these
words in Moses: Jehovah led him about, He instructed him, He guarded him
as the pupil of His eye. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth
over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, He took him, He bare him
upon His wings; Jehovah alone did lead him, neither was there any
strange god with him. He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
and fed him with the increase of the fields; He made him suck honey out
of the rock, and oil out of the flint of the rock; butter of the herd,
and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, and of rams the sons of
Bashan, and of he-goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and of the
blood of the grape thou drinkest pure wine (Deut. 32:10-14). Wherefore
they who were of that church are in heaven, and in all happiness and
glory there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6270.">6270.</span></span>

And he was the younger. That this signifies although it is in the second
place, is evident from the signification of the "younger," as being to
be in the second place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6271.">6271.</span></span>

And his left hand upon Manasseh's head. That this signifies that he
accounted good as being in the second place, is evident from the
signification of "putting his left hand," as being to account in the
second place; and from the representation of Manasseh, as being the
will, thus also the good of charity. How the case herein is may be seen
above (n. 6269).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6272.">6272.</span></span>

He put forth his hands crosswise. That this signifies, thus not
according to order, is evident from the signification of "putting forth
the hands crosswise," as being not according to order; for thereby he
makes the younger the firstborn, and the reverse; consequently the truth
of faith prior and higher; and the good of charity posterior and lower;
for "birthright" denotes priority and superiority (see n. 3325). It is
evident how much evil this introduces into the church; for thereby its
people get into such obscurity that they do not know what good is, thus
neither what truth is; for good is like flame, and truth like the light
from it: if you take away the flame, the light also perishes; and if any
light appears, it is like a deceptive light that is not from flame.
Hence it is that churches are at variance with one another, and dispute
about truth, and one congregation asserts a thing to be true, which
another asserts to be false. And what is still worse, when once they
have set faith in the prior place in the assemblage of the church, they
next begin to separate faith from charity, and to make the latter of
comparatively no account, and thus to care nothing for the life, a thing
to which man naturally inclines. Hence the church perishes, for it is
the life which makes the church with man, but not doctrine without life;
thus not confidence, which is eminent faith; for genuine confidence is
possible with those only who are in charity, from which is the life of
confidence. (Moreover, that the good of charity is actually the
firstborn, that is, in the prior place, and that the truth of faith
appears to be so, may be seen above, n. 3324, 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563,
3570, 3576, 3603, 3701, 4243, 4244, 4247, 4337, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930,
4977.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6273.">6273.</span></span>

For Manasseh was the firstborn. That this signifies since indeed good is
in the prior place, is evident from the representation of Manasseh, as
being the good that is of the will (of which above); and from the
signification of "birthright," as being priority and superiority (see n.
3325), thus the "firstborn" is one who is in the prior place. Who cannot
see from natural light alone, provided it is enlightened a little, that
good is in the prior place, as is also man's will; and that truth is in
the posterior place, as is also man's thinking? And also that man's will
causes him to think one way and not another, consequently that the good
with a man causes this or that to be true; thus that truth is in the
second place, and good in the first? Think and reflect whether the truth
that is of faith can take root except in good, and whether faith is
faith unless it is therein rooted. Hence you may conclude what is
primary or essential to the church, that is, to the man in whom the
church is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6274.">6274.</span></span>

Verses 15,16. And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my
fathers walked, Abraham and Isaac, the God who feedeth me since I am,
unto this day, the Angel who redeemeth me from all evil, bless the boys;
and let my name be called in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham
and Isaac; and let them grow unto a multitude in the midst of the earth.
"And he blessed Joseph," signifies a prediction with respect to the
truth of the intellectual and the good of the will having life from the
internal; "and said, The God before whom my fathers walked, Abraham and
Isaac," signifies the Divine from which internal good and internal truth
had life; "the God who feedeth me," signifies this Divine vivifying the
good of spiritual truth from the natural; "since I am, unto this day,"
signifies continually; "the Angel who redeemeth me from all evil,"
signifies the Lord's Divine Human, by which is effected deliverance from
hell; "bless the boys," signifies give them to have truth and good; "and
let my name be called in them," signifies that in them should be the
quality of the good of spiritual truth from the natural; "and the name
of my fathers Abraham and Isaac," signifies and the quality of internal
good and truth; "and let them grow unto a multitude in the midst of the
earth," signifies extension from the inmost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6275.">6275.</span></span>

And he blessed Joseph. That this signifies a prediction with respect to
the truth of the intellectual and the good of the will having life from
the internal, is evident from the signification of "blessing," as being
prediction (see n. 6230, 6254); and from the representation of Ephraim
and Manasseh, who here are "Joseph," as being the truth of the
intellectual and the good of the will in the natural, born from the
internal (n. 6234, 6249). That by "Joseph" are meant his sons, is
evident from the blessing itself, in which it is said, "The Angel who
redeemeth me from all evil, bless the boys, and let my name be called in
them;" and the reason is that this good and truth in the natural,
represented by Manasseh and Ephraim, are the very internal there. The
internal and the external are indeed distinct from each other; but in
the natural, where they are together, the internal is as in its own
adapted form, which form does nothing from itself, but only from the
internal within it; thus it is merely acted upon. The case herein is
like the efficient in the effect: the efficient and the effect are
distinct from each other, yet the efficient is in the effect as in its
own adapted form, and through it acts as cause in the sphere where the
effect is produced. In man the like is the case with the good and truth
in the natural, born from the internal; for the internal clothes itself
with such things as belong to the natural, in order that it may be there
and lead a life there; but the things with which it clothes itself are
nothing but coverings, which of themselves do nothing at all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6276.">6276.</span></span>

And said, The God before whom my fathers walked, Abraham and Isaac. That
this signifies the Divine from which internal good and internal truth
had life, is evident from the signification of "God," as being the
Divine; from the signification of "walking," as being to live, or to
have life (see n. 519, 1794); from the representation of Abraham, as
being in the supreme sense the Lord's Divine Itself; and from the
representation of Isaac, as being His Divine rational, thus the internal
human-for Jacob is the Lord's Divine natural, or His external human (see
n. 2011, 3245, 3305, 3439, 4615). But in the representative sense
"Abraham" is internal good, and "Isaac" internal truth (n. 3703, 6098,
6185). That these things in the representative sense are signified by
"Abraham and Isaac," is because that good and truth which are in the
Lord's kingdom proceed from His Divine and Divine Human; and make the
Lord Himself to be there; thus He Himself is His kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6277.">6277.</span></span>

The God who feedeth me. That this signifies this Divine vivifying the
good of spiritual truth from the natural, is evident from the
signification of "feeding," as being to vivify. That "to feed" is to
instruct, (see n. 6044) is because a "pasture" is that which sustains
the spiritual life of man (n. 6078); but "feeding" and a "pasture" are
there said of a flock, whereas "feeding" is here said of Jacob-that he
was sustained with food and the necessaries of life; by which in the
internal sense the like is signified; for that which sustains and
vivifies the life of the body, in the internal sense signifies that
which sustains the spiritual life and vivifies it. That Israel
represents spiritual good from the natural, has been shown above (n.
5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); and because this good
which Israel represents is the good of truth, therefore the good of
spiritual truth is here signified; for in the genuine sense "Israel" is
the spiritual church, and the good of this church is the good of truth;
because those who belong to this church are instructed about good by
means of truth, and when they do according to the truth in which they
are instructed, then this truth is called good. This is the good which
is called the good of truth, and is represented by Israel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6278.">6278.</span></span>

Since I am, unto this day. That this signifies continually, is evident
from the signification of "today" and "to this day," as being what is
perpetual and eternal (see n. 2838, 4304, 6165); here therefore "since I
am, unto this day" signifies continually, namely, vivifying, which is
"feeding" (n. 6277).

The Angel who redeemeth me from all evil. That this signifies the Lord's
Divine Human by which is effected deliverance from hell, is evident from
the signification of "angel," as being the Lord's Divine Human (of which
below); from the signification of "redeeming," as being to deliver (of
which also below); and from the signification of "evil," as being hell.
The reason why "evil" denotes hell is that hell itself is nothing but
evil; for whether you say that all in hell are evil, or that hell is
evil, it is the same. In the spiritual sense, when "evil" is mentioned,
hell is meant, for they who are in the spiritual sense, as are the
angels in heaven, think and speak abstractedly from persons, because
universally, and therefore to them evil is hell. It is the same with
"sin," when thereby is meant the ruling evil, as in Genesis: Jehovah
said unto Cain, If thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door; and
unto thee is his desire, and thou shall rule over him (Gen. 4:6, 7);
where "sin" denotes hell, which is at hand when a man does evil. The
very evil with man is nothing else than hell, for it inflows therefrom,
and the man is then a hell in the least form, as also is everyone there.
So on the other hand, the very good in man is nothing else than heaven
in him; for good flows in through heaven from the Lord; and the man who
is in good, is heaven in the smallest image, as also is everyone in
heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6280.">6280.</span></span>

That the "redeeming Angel" is the Lord as to the Divine Human, is
evident from the fact that by assuming the Human and making it Divine
the Lord redeemed man, that is, delivered him from hell; whence the Lord
as to His Divine Human is called the "Redeemer." That the Divine Human
is called the "Angel" is because the word "angel" means "sent," and the
Lord as to the Divine Human is said to be "sent," as is plain from many
passages in the Word of the Evangelists. Moreover before the Lord's
coming into the world the Divine Human was Jehovah Himself flowing in
through heaven when He spoke the Word; for Jehovah was above the
heavens, but that which passed from Him through the heavens was at that
time the Divine Human; for by the influx of Jehovah into heaven, He set
forth a man, and the very Divine thence derived was a Divine man. This
then is the Divine Human from eternity, and is what is called "Sent," by
which is meant proceeding, and this is the same as "Angel." \[2\] But as
Jehovah by this Divine Human of His, could not flow in any longer with
men, because they had so far removed themselves from this Divine, He
therefore took on the Human and made it Divine, and thus by influx from
this into heaven He could reach even those of the human race who would
receive the good of charity and the truth of faith from the Divine
Human, which was thus made visible, and could thus deliver them from
hell, which could not possibly have been effected in any other way. This
deliverance is that which is called "redemption," and the Divine Human
Itself, which delivered or redeemed, is what is called the "redeeming
Angel." \[3\] But be it known that in respect to the Divine Human, as
well as in respect to the Divine Itself, the Lord is above heaven; for
He is the Sun which illumines heaven; thus that heaven is far beneath
Him. The Divine Human which is in heaven is the Divine truth which
proceeds from Him, which is the light from Him as a sun. In respect to
His essence the Lord is not Divine truth, for this is from Him as light
from the sun, but He is Divine good itself, one with Jehovah. \[4\] The
Lord's Divine Human is called "Angel" in other places also in the Word,
as when He appeared to Moses in the bush, of which it is written in
Exodus: When Moses came to the mountain of God, unto Horeb, the Angel of
Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush.
Jehovah saw that Moses turned aside to see, therefore God called unto
him out of the midst of the bush. And he said further, I am the God of
thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
(Exod. 3:1, 2, 4, 6); it is the Lord's Divine Human which is here called
the "Angel of Jehovah," and it is plainly said that it was Jehovah
Himself. That Jehovah was there in the Divine Human may be seen from the
fact that the Divine Itself could not appear except through the Divine
Human; according to the Lord's words in John: "No one hath ever seen
God, the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath
set Him forth" (John 1:18); and in another place: "Ye have neither ever
heard the voice of the Father, nor seen His shape" (John 5:37). \[5\]
Moreover the Lord as to the Divine Human is called the "Angel" where it
treats of leading the people into the land of Canaan, of which we read
in Exodus: Behold I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
and to bring thee unto the place which I have prepared. Beware thou of
His faces, for He will not bear your transgression, because My name is
in the midst of Him (Exod. 23:20, 21, 23); that the "Angel" in this
passage is the Divine Human, is evident from the fact that it is said,
"because My name is in the midst of Him," that is, Jehovah Himself is.
By "My name" is signified the quality of Jehovah which is in the Divine
Human (that the Lord as to the Divine Human is the "name of Jehovah,"
may be seen above, n. 2628; and that the "name of God" is His quality,
as also everything in one complex by means of which God is worshiped, n.
2724, 3006). \[6\] In Isaiah: In all their distress He had distress, and
the Angel of His faces will deliver them; in His love and in His
indulgence He redeemed them, and He took them, and carried them all the
days of eternity (Isa. 63:9); that the "Angel of the faces of Jehovah"
is the Lord as to the Divine Human, is manifest, for it is said that "He
redeemed them." \[7\] In Malachi: Behold the Lord whom ye seek shall
suddenly come unto His temple, even the Angel of the covenant whom ye
desire; Behold He cometh, saith Jehovah Zebaoth. But who shall endure
the day of His coming, and who shall stand when He appeareth? Then shall
the meat-offering of Judah and Jerusalem be sweet to Jehovah, as in the
days of eternity, and as in former years (Mal. 3:1, 2, 4); that the
"Angel of the covenant" is the Lord as to the Divine Human is very
evident, for the subject treated of is His coming; the "offering of
Judah and Jerusalem being then sweet to Jehovah" signifies that worship
from love and faith in Him will then be sweet. That by "Judah" here is
not meant Judah, nor by "Jerusalem" Jerusalem, is clearly evident; for
neither then nor afterward was the offering of Judah and Jerusalem
sweet. That the "days of eternity" are the states of the Most Ancient
Church, which was celestial; and that the "former years" are the states
of the Ancient Church, which was spiritual, may be seen above (n. 6239).
Moreover by an "angel" in the Word, in the internal sense, is not
signified an angel, but something Divine in the Lord (n. 1925, 2319,
2821, 3039, 4085).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6281.">6281.</span></span>

As regards "redeeming," in the proper sense this signifies to restore
and appropriate to Himself that which had been His; and it is predicated
of slavery, of death, and of evil; when of slavery, they are meant who
have been enslaved, in the spiritual sense enslaved by hell; when of
death, they are meant who are in condemnation; and when of evil, as
here, they are meant who are in hell, for the evil from which the angel
redeems is hell (see n. 6279). As the Lord delivered man from these
evils by making the Human in Himself Divine, therefore His Divine Human
is called in the Word the "Redeemer," as in Isaiah: I aid thee, saith
Jehovah, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 41:14). Again:
Thus hath said Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One (Isa. 49:7,
26). Again: Jehovah Zebaoth is His name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One
of Israel; the God of the whole earth shall He be called (Isa. 54:5). In
these passages, the Divine Itself, which is called "Jehovah," is
distinguished from the Divine Human, which is called the "Redeemer the
Holy One of Israel." \[2\] But that it is Jehovah Himself in the Divine
Human, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: Thus hath said
Jehovah, the King of Israel, and his Redeemer, Jehovah Zebaoth, I am the
first, and I am the last, and besides Me there is no God (Isa. 44:6).
Thus hath said Jehovah thy Redeemer, I am Jehovah thy God, that teacheth
thee (Isa. 48:17). Again: Thou art our Father, for Abraham knoweth us
not, and Israel doth not acknowledge us; Thou Jehovah art our Father,
our Redeemer; from everlasting is Thy name (Isa. 63:16). In David:
Jehovah who redeemed thy life from the pit (Ps. 103:4). \[3\] From these
passages also it is plain that by "Jehovah" in the Word no other is
meant than the Lord (see n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3035, 5663); and that
"Jehovah the Redeemer" is His Divine Human. Therefore also those who
have been redeemed are called the "redeemed of Jehovah" in Isaiah: Say
ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy salvation cometh; Behold His
reward is with Him, and the price of His work before Him. They shall
call them, The people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah (Isa. 62:11,
12); that it is the Lord from whom they are called the "redeemed of
Jehovah," is very clear; for it is said of His coming: "Behold thy
salvation cometh; behold His reward is with Him." See besides Isa. 43:1;
52:2, 3; 63:4, 9; Hos. 13:14; Exod. 6:6; 15:13; Job 19:25, where it is
evident that "redemption" is predicated of slavery, of death, and of
evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6282.">6282.</span></span>

Bless the boys. That this signifies give them to have truth and good, is
evident from the signification of "blessing," as being to endow with
truth and good; for in the spiritual sense "blessing" involves nothing
else (see n. 1420, 1422, 4981); and from the representation of Ephraim
and Manasseh, who here are the "boys," as being the intellectual and the
will of the church, to which truth and good should be given: to the
intellectual, truth; and to the will, good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6283.">6283.</span></span>

And let my name be called in them. That this signifies that in them
should be the quality of the good of spiritual truth from the natural,
is evident from the signification of the "name being called in" anyone,
as being his quality in him (see n. 1754, 1896, 2009, 3421); and from
the representation of Israel, as being the good of spiritual truth from
the natural (of which above, n. 6277); and because the quality of Israel
was in them, therefore they also were received among the rest of the
sons of Jacob, and were made tribes, one of Manasseh and the other of
Ephraim, and with them the twelve tribes were made up, when the tribe of
Levi, being made the priesthood, was not numbered among the tribes that
obtained inheritance by lot (see Joshua and also Ezekiel 48).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6284.">6284.</span></span>

And the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac. That this signifies, and
the quality of internal good and truth, is evident from the
signification of "name," as being the quality (see n. 6283); and from
the representation of Abraham and Isaac, as being internal good and
truth (of which above, n. 6276). Internal good and truth must be in
external good and truth, in order for these to be good and truth. For,
as was said above (n. 6275), the external is merely a formed something,
of such a nature that the internal can be in it, and lead a life there
according to the influx into itself from the Lord; neither also is the
internal anything else relatively to the highest, which is the Lord,
whence is all life; and the things beneath are merely forms recipient of
life through the degrees in their order, down to the last, which is the
body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6285.">6285.</span></span>

And let them grow unto a multitude in the midst of the earth. That this
signifies extension from the inmost, is evident from the signification
of the "midst," as being the inmost (see n. 2940, 2973, 6068, 6084,
6103). Hence "growing unto a multitude" is extension; for the truths
that are signified by a "multitude" extend themselves round about from
the inmost, as from a center; and the greater the extension thence is,
and the better this is in accordance with heavenly order, so much the
more perfect is the state; this is the state which is signified by this
part of the blessing: "and let them grow unto a multitude in the midst
of the earth."

Verses 17-20. And Joseph saw that his father put his right hand, upon
the head of Ephraim, and it was evil in his eyes; and he laid hold of
the hand of his father to remove it from upon Ephraim's head upon
Manasseh's head. And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for
this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. And his father
refused, and said, I know, my son, I know; he also shall be for a
people, and he also shall become great; and nevertheless his younger
brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall be the fullness of
the nations. And he blessed them in this day, saying, In thee shall
Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh; and he
set Ephraim before Manasseh. "And Joseph saw that his father put his
right hand upon the head of Ephraim," signifies a perception that he
accounted truth as being in the first place; "and it was evil in his
eyes," signifies displeasure; "and he laid hold of the hand of his
father," signifies influx into the power of his obscure perception; "to
remove it from upon Ephraim's head upon Manasseh's head," signifies to
turn him away from error; "and Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my
father, for this is the firstborn" signifies perceptible influx with
respect to good that it has priority; "put thy right hand upon his
head," signifies that thus it should be in the first place; "and his
father refused," signifies no consent; "and said, I know, my son, I
know," signifies that so it is, but that it appears otherwise; "he also
shall be for a people, and he also shall become great," signifies that
truth from good also shall be increased, thus the celestial man; "and
nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he," signifies
that good from truth shall receive more increase, thus the spiritual
man; "and his seed shall be the fullness of the nations," signifies that
the truth of faith shall reign; "and he blessed them in this day,"
signifies foresight and providence eternally; "saying, In thee shall
Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh,"
signifies that his own spiritual may be in the truth of the intellectual
and in the good of the will; "and he set Ephraim before Manasseh,"
signifies that he accounted truth as being in the first place, because
he was spiritual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6287.">6287.</span></span>

And Joseph saw that his father put his right hand upon the head of
Ephraim. That this signifies a perception that he accounted truth as
being in the first place, is evident from the signification of "saying,"
as being to understand and perceive (see n. 2150, 2807, 3764, 4567,
4723, 5400); from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal
celestial (n. 5869, 5877, 6224); from the representation of Israel, who
here is the "father," as being spiritual good from the natural; from the
signification of "putting the right hand on the head," as being to
account in the first place (n. 6269); and from the representation of
Ephraim, as being the truth of the intellectual in the natural (n. 6234,
6238, 6267). From this it is plain that by "Joseph saw that his father
put his right hand on the head of Ephraim," is signified a perception of
the internal celestial that spiritual good from the natural accounted
truth as being in the first place. (See what was said and shown above,
n. 6256, 6269, 6272, 6273.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6288.">6288.</span></span>

And it was evil in his eyes. That this signifies displeasure, is evident
without explication. The reason why it displeased Joseph was that by him
is represented the internal celestial, which is above the spiritual good
that is represented by Israel. What is higher can perceive how the case
is with what is done in what is lower, thus also whether it is truth
that is being thought there, or not. For as what is higher sees from the
light of heaven, it sees the things that are below; thus the internal
celestial which is "Joseph," saw that the spiritual good from the
natural which is "Israel," was in error, and therefore it displeased
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6289.">6289.</span></span>

And he laid hold of the hand of his father. That this signifies influx
into the power of his obscure perception, is evident from the
signification of "laying hold of the hand," as being influx into the
power of perception; for when the internal desires by means of influx to
compel the external to think and will something, it as it were takes
hold of it, here of the power of perception that is signified by the
"hand." (That the "hand" is power may be seen above, n. 878, 3387,
4931-4937.) That the perception is called obscure, is because relatively
to the celestial, who are represented by Joseph, the spiritual, who are
represented by Israel, are in obscurity. (That the spiritual are
relatively in obscurity, may be seen above, n. 2708, 2715, 2716, 2718,
2831, 2849, 2935, 2937, 3833, 4402.) That the spiritual are in
obscurity, is very evident from the fact that before they have been
regenerated they are altogether in thick darkness with respect to truth
and good, and that while they are being regenerated, it is such truth as
is in the doctrine of their church that they acknowledge, and in which
truth they have faith, whether it is true or not. Nevertheless it is
this truth that becomes good with them when it becomes of the will and
thence of the life, and then it is that good which is called the good of
truth, and also the good of faith, and likewise spiritual good, or the
good of the spiritual church. The quality of the good that is from such
an origin may be known to everyone who considers the matter.
Nevertheless the good from such truth, even with the Gentiles, is
accepted by the Lord, provided it has for a principle or starting point
charity toward the neighbor, and that in this charity there is
innocence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6290.">6290.</span></span>

To remove it from upon Ephraim's head upon Manasseh's head. That this
signifies to turn him away from error, is evident from the signification
of "removing," as being to turn away; and from the signification of
"from upon Ephraim's head upon Manasseh's head," as being from error;
for it was an error for him to account truth as being in the first place
and good in the second, as has been shown above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6291.">6291.</span></span>

And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the
firstborn. That this signifies perceptible influx with respect to good,
that it has the priority, is evident from the signification of "saying,"
when predicated of the internal celestial, which here is "Joseph," as
being influx (see n. 6152); here perceptible influx, because he not only
took hold of his hand, but also said, "Not so, my father, for this is
the firstborn."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6292.">6292.</span></span>

Put thy right hand upon his head. That this signifies that thus it
should be in the first place, is evident from the signification of
"putting the right hand on the head," as being to account in the first
place (see n. 6269, 6287). That when he was blessing, Israel placed his
hand on the head, was from a ritual received from the ancients; for in
the head are the very intellectual and will of man, but in the body are
acts according thereto, and compliance; thus putting the hand on the
head was a representative that a blessing was being communicated to the
intellectual and the will, thus to the man himself. From that ancient
time the same ritual remains even to this day, and is in use in
inaugurations, and also in the act of blessing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6293.">6293.</span></span>

And his father refused. That this signifies no consent, is evident
without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6294.">6294.</span></span>

And said, I know, my son, I know. That this signifies that so it is, but
that it appears otherwise, is evident from the signification of
"knowing," as here being to know that it is so, but that it appears
otherwise. That spiritual good which is "Israel" now perceived this, was
from the influx of the internal celestial, which is "Joseph" (which
influx has been treated of above, n. 6289, 6291). When spiritual good is
in enlightenment from such an influx, it perceives that it is so, that
is, that good is in the prior place, and truth in the posterior, and
also that it appears otherwise; but at this time it makes the priority
consist in the fact that truth should reign over good (as said below),
and for this reason he retains the right hand on the head of the younger
son, and the left on the head of the firstborn.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6295.">6295.</span></span>

He also shall be for a people, and he also shall become great. That this
signifies that truth from good also shall be increased, thus the
celestial man, is evident from the signification of "people," as being
truth (see n. 1259, 1260, 3581, 4619); from the signification of
"becoming great," as being to be increased; and from the representation
of Manasseh, of whom this is said, as being the good of the will in the
natural, born from the internal (see n. 6234, 6238, 6267). That truth
from good is of the celestial man, is evident from what has already been
frequently said and shown with respect to the celestial man, namely,
that the celestial man is one who is in good from the will, and from
this in truth; and that he is distinguished from the spiritual man by
the fact that the latter is in truth from the intellectual, and from
this in good. And because "Manasseh" is the good of the will, therefore
by him is represented the celestial man, but the external celestial man,
or the man of the external celestial church; for "Manasseh" is the good
of the will in the natural, thus in the external man; whereas "Joseph"
is the man of the internal celestial church, because he is the good of
the will in the rational, thus in the internal man. \[2\] In a few words
something must be said of the truth of good which is of the celestial
man. This truth is indeed called truth, but it is good. With the
celestial man there is the good of love to the Lord and the good of love
toward the neighbor. The good of love to the Lord is his internal, and
the good of love toward the neighbor is his external. Therefore as
regards the men who are of the celestial church, those are in the
internal of this church who are in love to the Lord, and those are in
its external who are in love toward the neighbor. The good of this love,
namely, of love toward the neighbor with the celestial man, is what is
here called the "truth of good," and is represented by Manasseh. For the
celestial man is such that he does not reason from truth, nor about
truth, because he has perception from good (that is, through good from
the Lord) that a thing is so or is not so (see n. 202, 337, 2715, 3246,
4448); and yet the good of charity with him is what is called truth, but
celestial truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6296.">6296.</span></span>

And nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he. That this
signifies that good from truth shall receive more increase, thus the
spiritual man, is evident from the representation of Ephraim, here the
"younger brother," as being the truth of the intellectual in the natural
born from the internal (see n. 6234, 6238, 6267), but here "Ephraim" is
good from truth (of which in what follows); and from the signification
of "becoming greater" than another; as being to receive more increase.
That here "Ephraim" is good from truth, is because he represents the man
of the spiritual church, but the man of the external spiritual church,
as Manasseh represents the man of the external celestial church (n.
6295). Good from truth constitutes this man, that is, the man of the
spiritual church. The internal of this church is what is represented by
Israel, but the external by Ephraim. The man of the spiritual church
differs from the man of the celestial church in this, that the good of
the spiritual church is implanted in the intellectual part, but the good
of the celestial church in the will part (see n. 863, 875, 895, 927,
928, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256, 4328, 4493, 5113); therefore Ephraim
represents the spiritual man, and Manasseh the celestial. \[2\] That
good from truth, or the spiritual man, receives more increase than the
good from which is truth, or the celestial man, is because the will of
man has continually been depraved, and at last so that evil has taken
entire possession of it, insomuch that nothing sound (integer) has
remained there. Therefore lest man should perish, the Lord provided that
he might be regenerated as to the intellectual part, and thus be saved.
Hence then it is that there are few with whom there is anything sound
left in the will part, thus few who can become celestial men, but many
who can become spiritual men; thus that the latter receive more increase
than the former. This is what is signified by his "younger brother
becoming greater than he."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6297.">6297.</span></span>

And his seed shall be the fullness of the nations. That this signifies
that the truth which is of faith shall reign, is evident from the
signification of "seed," as being faith and charity (see n. 1025, 1447,
1610, 1940, 2848, 3187, 3310, 3373, 3671), here faith, because
predicated of Ephraim; and from the signification of the "fullness of
the nations," as being abundance, thus that the truth of faith shall
reign. "Fullness" in the Word signifies all, and where it does not
signify all, it signifies abundant, and is predicated both of truth and
of good; for "multitude" is predicated of truth, but "magnitude" of
good, thus "fullness of both," as in Jeremiah: Behold waters rise up out
of the north, which shall become an overflowing stream, and shall
overflow the land and the fullness thereof, the city and them that dwell
therein (Jer. 47:2); "the land and the fullness" denote all, both truth
and good, that is of the church. For this reason it is added, "the city
and them that dwell therein;" for by "city" are signified truths, and by
"them that dwell therein," goods (n. 2268, 2451, 2712). \[2\] In
Ezekiel: They shall eat their bread with solicitude, and drink their
waters with amazement, that the land thereof may be devastated from its
fullness (Ezek. 12:19); the "land" denotes the church, and the
"fullness" the good and truth there. That both are signified is evident
from what precedes, that "they should eat bread with solicitude, and
drink waters with amazement;" for by "bread" is signified the good of
love, and by "waters" the truth of faith, which are called the "fullness
of the earth." \[3\] In like manner in Amos: The pride of Jacob, and his
palaces, I hate, therefore will I shut up the city and the fullness
thereof (Amos 6:8). In David: The heavens are Thine, the earth also is
Thine; the world and the fullness thereof Thou hast founded (Ps. 89:11).
The earth is Jehovah's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they
that dwell therein. For He hath founded it upon the seas, and
established it upon the streams (Ps. 24:1, 2); where also the "fullness"
denotes truth and good; the "earth," the church in a specific, and the
"world," the church in a universal sense. That "Jehovah founded the
world upon the seas" denotes upon the things that are of
memory-knowledge (n. 28); and that "He established it upon the streams"
denotes upon the things that are of intelligence (n. 3051). Who cannot
see that it is not meant that Jehovah founded the world upon the seas,
and established it upon the streams, for the world is not founded and
established thereon; and therefore he who reflects can see that by
"seas" and by "streams" something else is signified, and that this
something else is the spiritual or internal of the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6298.">6298.</span></span>

And he blessed them in this day. That this signifies foresight and
providence eternally, is evident from the signification of "blessing,"
as being prediction (see n. 6230, 6254), but in the supreme sense the
Lord's foresight; and because foresight, it is also Providence, for the
one is impossible without the other; for evil is foreseen and good is
provided, and the evil which is foreseen is by providence bent into
good. That here "to bless" denotes foresight and providence, is because
Israel, who here blesses, in the supreme sense is the Lord (n. 4286).
That eternally is meant, is evident from the signification of "this
day," or "today," as being what is eternal (n. 2838, 3998, 4304, 6165).

Saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God set thee as Ephraim and
as Manasseh. That this signifies that his own spiritual may be in the
truth of the intellectual and the good of the will, is evident from the
representation of Israel, as being spiritual good (see n. 5801, 5803,
5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); and from the representation of
Ephraim, as being the truth of the intellectual, and of Manasseh, as
being the good of the will (of which above). That the spiritual, which
is "Israel," may be in them, is signified by the words, "in thee shall
Israel bless, and God set thee." \[2\] As regards the spiritual
represented by Israel being in the truth of the intellectual and the
good of the will, which are "Ephraim and Manasseh," the case is this.
The spiritual good which is represented by Israel is the spiritual of
the internal church; whereas the truth and good represented by Ephraim
and Manasseh are of the external church (see n. 6296). In order for an
internal to be an internal of the church, it must needs be in the
external of the church, for the external holds the place of the
foundation on which the internal stands, and is the receptacle into
which the internal flows. Hence it is that the natural, which is
external, must needs be regenerated; for unless it is regenerated, the
internal has neither foundation nor receptacle; and if it has no
foundation nor receptacle, it utterly perishes. This then is what is
meant by his own spiritual being in the truth of the intellectual and
the good of the will. \[3\] As an illustration of this matter take this
example. The very affection of charity which a man feels within himself
as a quietude and bliss in benefiting the neighbor without regard to any
recompense, is the internal of the church; but to will this good and to
do it from truth, that is, because it has been so commanded in the Word,
is the external of the church. If the natural, which is the external, is
not in agreement, that is, does not will nor do this good, because it
sees in it no recompense, thus nothing of self (for in the natural or
external man there is such a disposition both from what is hereditary
and from what is actual), then the internal has no foundation, nor
corresponding receptacle, except such as either rejects, or perverts, or
extinguishes the influx; and therefore the internal perishes, that is,
is closed and stopped up, so that nothing from heaven can pass into the
natural through the internal, except some light of a general nature that
passes through the chinks everywhere round about, in order that there
may be a faculty of thinking, of willing, and of speaking, but according
to that which is in the natural, thus in favor of evil and falsity
against good and truth, to which purpose it makes subservient that
amount of spiritual light which in a general manner flows in through the
chinks everywhere round about.

And he set Ephraim before Manasseh. That this signifies that he
accounted truth as being in the first place, because he was spiritual,
is evident from what has been unfolded above (verses 13, 14, 17-19).
