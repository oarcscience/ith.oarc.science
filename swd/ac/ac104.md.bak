### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="5151.">5151.</span></span>

This is the interpretation thereof. That this signifies what \[the
dream\] had in it, is evident from the signification of
"interpretation," as being what it has in it, or what is therein (of
which above, n. 5093, 5105, 5107).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5152.">5152.</span></span>

The three baskets. That this signifies the successives of the things of
the will, is evident from the signification of "three baskets," as being
the successives of the things of the will (of which above, n. 5144).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5153.">5153.</span></span>

Three days are these. That this signifies even to the last, is evident
from the signification of "three," as being one period and its
continuous progression from beginning to end, thus even to the last (n.
2788, 4495, 5122).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5154.">5154.</span></span>

In yet three days. That this signifies that which is in the last, is
evident from what was said just above (n. 5152) about the signification
of "three."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5155.">5155.</span></span>

Shall Pharaoh lift off thy head from upon thee. That this signifies what
is concluded from what is foreseen, is evident from the signification of
"lifting off the head," as being what is provided and therefore
concluded, or what is concluded from what is provided (of which above,
n. 5124); but here from what is foreseen, because the statement follows
that the baker should be hanged upon wood, by which is signified
rejection and damnation. The reason why what is concluded from what is
foreseen (not from what is provided), is signified is that providence is
predicated of good, but foresight of evil; for all good flows in from
the Lord, and therefore this is provided; but all evil is from hell, or
from man's own which makes one with hell; and therefore this is
foreseen. As regards evil, Providence is nothing but the direction or
determination of evil to less evil, and as far as possible to good; but
the evil itself is foreseen. In the present instance it is foresight
that is signified, because the subject treated of is the sensuous that
is subject to the will part and its rejection on account of evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5156.">5156.</span></span>

And shall hang thee upon wood. That this signifies rejection and
damnation, is evident from the signification of "being hanged upon
wood," as being rejection and damnation; for hanging upon wood was a
curse, and a curse is a rejection from the Divine, consequently
damnation. That hanging upon wood was a curse, is evident in Moses: When
there shall be in a man a crime of judgment of death, and he be put to
death, so that thou hangest him upon wood, his carcass shall not remain
all night upon the wood, but burying thou shalt bury him the same day,
for he that is hanged is the curse of God; that thou defile not the land
which Jehovah thy God will give thee for an inheritance (Deut.
21:22-23); that he "should not remain all night upon the wood" signified
perpetual rejection; for in the evening the day began anew, and
therefore unless they who had been hanged were cast away before evening,
it would have represented that evil was not rejected, and consequently
that the land was not freed from it, but was defiled; and therefore it
is added, "that thou defile not the land which Jehovah thy God giveth
thee for an inheritance." That the hanged remained until evening and no
longer may be seen in Joshua 8:29; 10:26. Among the Jewish nation there
were two main penalties-stoning and hanging. Stoning was on account of
falsity, and hanging upon wood was on account of evil; and this because
"stone" is truth (see n. 643, 1298, 3720), and in the opposite sense
falsity; and "wood" is good (n. 2784, 2812, 3720), and in the opposite
sense evil; and therefore in the prophetic Word mention is occasionally
made of "committing adultery with stone and wood," whereby is signified
the perversion of truth, which is falsity, and the adulteration of good,
which is evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5157.">5157.</span></span>

And the bird shall eat thy flesh from upon thee. That this signifies
that the falsity of evil will consume what is of these sensuous things,
is evident from the signification of "eating," as being to consume (of
which above, n. 5149); and from the signification of "bird," as being
falsity (of which also above, n. 5149); and from the signification of
"flesh," as being good (see n. 3812, 3813), and hence in the opposite
sense evil; for most of the expressions in the Word have also an
opposite sense, which is known from their signification in the genuine
sense; and from the signification of "from upon thee," as being from the
sensuous things subject to the will part, for these are represented by
the baker (n. 5078, 5082). That these were evil, and therefore to be
rejected, is evident from what goes before. \[2\] How the case is in
regard to this-that the sensuous things subject to the intellectual
part, which are represented by the butler, were retained, and that the
sensuous things subject to the will part, which are represented by the
baker, were rejected-is a secret that without enlightenment cannot be
comprehended, but what follows may help to throw light upon it. By
sensuous things are meant those memory-knowledges and those delights
which have been instilled through the five external or bodily senses
into man's memory and into his desires, and which together constitute
the exterior natural, from which a man is called a sensuous man. These
memory-knowledges are subject to the intellectual part, but the delights
are subject to the will part; the memory-knowledges also bear relation
to the truths which are of the understanding, and the delights to the
goods which are of the will; the former are what are represented by the
butler and were retained, and the latter are what are represented by the
baker and were rejected. \[3\] The reason why the former were retained
is that for a time they could agree with intellectual things; and the
reason why the latter were rejected is that they could not possibly
agree. For the will part in the Lord (who is the subject here treated of
in the supreme internal sense) was Divine from conception, and was the
Divine good itself; but the will part that He had by birth from the
mother was evil; and therefore this was to be rejected, and in its place
a new one was to be procured from the Divine will part by means of the
intellectual, or from the Divine good by means of the Divine truth, thus
from His own power. This is the secret that is here described in the
internal sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5158.">5158.</span></span>

Verses 20-23. And it came to pass on the third day, on Pharaoh's
birthday, and he made a feast to all his servants; and he lifted up the
head of the prince of the butlers and the head of the prince of the
bakers in the midst of his servants. And he brought back the prince of
the butlers upon his butlership, and he gave the cup upon Pharaoh's
palm; and he hanged the prince of the bakers; as Joseph interpreted to
them. And the prince of the butlers did not remember Joseph, and he
forgot him. "And it came to pass on the third day," signifies in the
last; "on Pharaoh's birthday," signifies when the natural was being
regenerated; "and he made a feast to all his servants," signifies
initiation and conjunction with the exterior natural; "and he lifted up
the head," signifies according to what was provided and foreseen; "of
the prince of the butlers and the head of the prince of the bakers,"
signifies concerning the sensuous things subject to both parts, the
intellectual part and the will part; "in the midst of his servants,"
signifies which were among those things that were in the exterior
natural; "and he brought back the prince of the butlers upon his
butlership," signifies that the sensuous things of the intellectual part
were received and made subordinate; "and he gave the cup upon Pharaoh's
palm," signifies instrumental to the interior natural; "and he hanged
the prince of the bakers," signifies that the sensuous things of the
will part were rejected; "as Joseph interpreted to them," signifies
prediction from the celestial in the natural; "and the prince of the
butlers did not remember Joseph," signifies that there was not as yet
conjunction in every way with the celestial of the natural; "and he
forgot him," signifies removal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5159.">5159.</span></span>

And it came to pass on the third day. That this signifies in the last,
is evident from the signification of the "third day," as being the last
of a state, for "day" is state (see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788,
3462, 3785, 4850), and the "third" is what is complete, thus the last
(n. 1825, 2788, 4495). By the last of a state is meant when a prior
state comes to an end and a new one begins. A new state begins in the
man who is being regenerated, when the order is changed, as takes place
when interior things obtain dominion over exterior things, and the
exterior things begin to serve the interior, both as to the things of
the intellect and as to those of the will. With those who are being
regenerated, this is observed from the fact that something within
dissuades them from allowing sensuous delights and bodily or earthly
pleasures to reign, and to draw over to their side the things of the
intellect to confirm them; and when this is the case the prior state is
at its last, and the new state is at its first. Such is the
signification of "on the third day." \[2\] With every man, whether being
regenerated or not, there come forth changes of state, and also
inversions; but in one way with those who are being regenerated, and in
another way with those who are not being regenerated. With those who are
not being regenerated, these changes or inversions are owing to causes
in the body, and to causes in civil life. The causes in the body are the
cupidities that come with the time of life and pass away with the time
of life, and are also reflections on the health of the body and long
life in the world; the causes in civil life are seeming outward
bridlings of cupidities, chiefly in order to acquire the reputation of
being wise and of loving justice and goodness, but with the end of
getting honors and gain; whereas with those who are being regenerated,
the changes or inversions are effected for spiritual reasons, which
proceed from goodness and justice itself; and when the man begins to be
affected with these, he is at the end of the prior state, and at the
beginning of a new one. \[3\] But as few are able to know how the case
herein is, it shall be illustrated by an example. He who does not suffer
himself to be regenerated, loves the things of the body for the sake of
the body, and for no other end, and he also loves the world for the sake
of the world, rising no higher because at heart he denies all that is
higher or interior. But on the other hand one who is being regenerated
likewise loves the things of the body and also the things of the world,
but for a higher or more interior end; for he loves the things of the
body with the end of having a sound mind in a sound body, and he loves
his mind and its soundness with an end still more interior-that he may
relish (or be wise in) good and understand truth. Like other men he too
loves the things of the world; but he loves them for the sake of the end
that through the world, its wealth, possessions, and honors, he may have
the means of doing what is good and true, and what is just and fair.
\[4\] This example shows the respective qualities of those who are not
being regenerated and of those who are; and that in the outward form
they appear alike, but that in the internal form they are wholly unlike.
And from what has been said it is also evident what are the reasons, and
of what nature these are, that produce the changes and inversions of
state in both these classes of persons. And it can further be seen that
in the regenerate interior things have dominion over exterior things,
while in the unregenerate exterior things have dominion over interior
things. It is the ends in a man that have the dominion, for the ends
subordinate and subject to themselves all things that are in him. His
veriest life is from no other source than his end, because his end is
always his love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5160.">5160.</span></span>

On Pharaoh's birthday. That this signifies when the natural was being
regenerated, is evident from the signification of "being born," as being
to be regenerated (of which hereafter); and from the representation of
Pharaoh, as being the interior natural (see n. 5080, 5095), here the
natural in general, because with the regenerate the interior and the
exterior natural act as a one through their mutual correspondence. "To
be born" is to be regenerated because spiritual things are meant in the
internal sense, and spiritual birth is regeneration, which is also
called rebirth; and therefore when "birth" is mentioned in the Word, no
other birth is understood in heaven than that which is effected by
"water and the spirit," that is, through faith and charity; because it
is by his being born again or regenerated that man becomes man, and is
wholly distinguished from the brutes; for he then becomes a son and heir
of the Lord's kingdom. (That spiritual births are signified by the
births which are mentioned in the Word may be seen above, n. 1145, 1255,
3860, 3868, 4070, 4668.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5161.">5161.</span></span>

And he made a feast to all his servants. That this signifies initiation
and conjunction with the exterior natural, is evident from the
signification of a "feast," as being initiation to conjunction (see n.
3832), and also conjunction through love, and appropriation (n. 3596);
and from the signification of "servants," as being the things of the
exterior natural. For when man is being regenerated lower things are
subordinated and subjected to higher, or exterior things to interior,
the exterior things then becoming servants, and the interior, masters.
Such is the signification of "servants" in the Word (as may be seen
above, n. 2541, 3019, 3020); but they become such servants as are loved
by the Lord; for it is mutual love that conjoins them, and causes their
service not to be perceived as such, but as compliance from the heart;
for good flows in from within, and produces in it this delight. In old
time feasts were held for various reasons, and by them was signified
initiation into mutual love, and thus conjunction. They were also held
on birthdays; and then represented the new birth, or regeneration, which
is the conjunction of the interiors with the exteriors in man through
love, consequently is the conjunction of heaven with the world in him;
for what is worldly or natural in man is then conjoined with what is
spiritual and celestial.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5162.">5162.</span></span>

And he lifted up the head. That this signifies according to what is
provided and foreseen, is evident from the signification of "lifting up
the head," as being what is concluded from what is provided, and also
from what is foreseen (of which above, n. 5124, 5155). This was provided
in respect to the sensuous subject to the intellectual part, and
retained as good, which is represented by the butler; and it was
foreseen in respect to the sensuous subject to the will part, and
rejected as evil, which is represented by the baker. For good is
provided and evil is foreseen, because all good is from the Lord, and
all evil is from hell, or from man's own. (That man's own is nothing but
evil, may be seen above, n. 210, 215, 694, 874-876, 987, 1023, 1044,
1047, 1581, 3812, 4328.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5163.">5163.</span></span>

Of the prince of the butlers, and the head of the prince of the bakers.
That this signifies concerning the sensuous things subject to both
parts, the intellectual part and the will part, is evident from the
representation of the butler, as being the sensuous subject to the
intellectual part (see n. 5077, 5082); and from the representation of
the baker, as being the sensuous subject to the will part (n. 5078,
5082).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5164.">5164.</span></span>

In the midst of his servants. That this signifies that were among those
things that were in the exterior natural, is evident from the
signification of "in the midst," as being among them; and from the
signification of "servants," as being the things in the exterior natural
(of which just above, n. 5161). In the Word all things are called
"servants" that are beneath and are therefore subordinate and subject to
what is higher, just as those things which are of the exterior natural,
or the sensuous things therein, are in respect to the interior natural;
and the things of the latter also are called "servants" in respect to
the rational; and consequently all things in man both in general and in
particular, and equally so whether inmost or outmost, are called
"servants" relatively to the Divine, for this is supreme. \[2\] The
"servants" here, in the midst of whom Pharaoh the king executed judgment
upon the butler and the baker, were the princes and grandees of the
palace; and the reason why these, like other subjects of every
condition, are called "servants" relatively to the king (as is also the
case in every kingdom at this day) is that royalty represents the Lord
as to Divine truth (see n. 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4581, 4966, 5068), in
respect to whom all are alike servants, whatever their condition may be;
and in the Lord's kingdom or heaven they who are the greatest (that is,
they who are inmost) are servants more than others, because they are in
the greatest obedience, and in deeper humiliation than the rest; for
these are they who are meant by the "least that shall be greatest," and
by the "last that shall be first": The first shall be last, and the last
shall be first (Matt. 19:30; 20:16; Mark 10:31; Luke 13:30). He that is
least among you, the same shall be great (Luke 9:48); and also by the
"great who should be ministers," and by the "first who should be
servants": Whosoever would be great among you shall be your minister;
and whosoever would be first of you, shall be servant of all (Mark
10:44; Matt. 20:26-27). \[3\] They are called "servants" relatively to
the Divine truth which is from the Lord, and "ministers" relatively to
the Divine good which is from Him. The reason why the "last who are
first" are servants more fully than others is that they know,
acknowledge, and perceive, that everything of life, and consequently
everything of power which they have, is from the Lord and not at all
from themselves; whereas they who do not perceive this, because they do
not so acknowledge, are also servants, yet more in the acknowledgment of
the lips than of the heart. But they who are in what is contrary call
themselves "servants" relatively to the Divine, and yet desire to be
masters; for they are indignant and angry if the Divine does not favor
them and as it were obey them; and at last they are opposed to the
Divine, and take away all power from the Divine, and attribute all
things to themselves. There are very many of this character within the
church, who deny the Lord, and say they acknowledge one supreme Being.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5165.">5165.</span></span>

And he brought back the prince of the butlers upon his butlership. That
this signifies that the sensuous things of the intellectual part were
received and made subordinate, is evident from the representation of the
prince of the butlers, as being in general the sensuous things subject
to the intellectual part (of which above); and from the signification of
"bringing back upon his butlership," as being to reduce into order under
the intellectual. (That "to bring back upon a station" is to reduce into
order so as to be in the last place, may be seen in n. 5125.) It is here
said "upon the butlership," because the butlership and the things
relating to it, such as wine, new wine, strong drink, and water, are
predicated of what belongs to the understanding, as also are drinking
and giving to drink (see n. 3069, 3168, 3772, 4017); hence it is plain
that by "bringing back the prince of the butlers upon his butlership" is
signified reducing into order the sensuous things of the intellectual
part, and thus receiving them and making them subordinate. \[2\] These
sensuous things are received and made subordinate when they minister and
serve as means to interior things, both for bringing forth into act and
for seeing inwardly; for man sees interior things in the sensuous things
of the exterior natural almost as he sees affections in the face, and
those still more interior in the eyes. Without such an interior face, or
without such a plane, a man in the body cannot think at all of what is
above sensuous things, for he sees what is above as one sees the
affections and thoughts of another in his face, while not attending to
the face itself; and as when one hears another speak, while not
attending to the words, but to the sense of what is said, the very
speaking of the words being the plane in which that sense is. It is
similar with the exterior natural; unless this served interior things as
a plane in which they see themselves as in a mirror, man could not think
at all; and therefore this plane is formed first, even from infancy. But
these matters are unknown, because that which comes forth interiorly in
man does not come to view except by interior reflection. \[3\] The
quality of the exterior natural is very manifest in the other life, for
the faces of spirits and angels are formed from it and according to it.
In the light of heaven the interiors, and especially the intentions or
ends, shine forth through that face. If love to the Lord and charity
toward the neighbor have formed the interiors, there is a consequent
resplendence in the face, and the face itself is love and charity in
form; but if the love of self and of the world, and the derivative
hatred, revenge, cruelty, and the like, have formed the interiors, there
is a consequent diabolical expression in the face, and the face itself
is hatred, revenge, and cruelty in form. From this it is evident what
the exterior natural is and what is its use, and also what it is when
made subject to interior things, and what it is when interior things are
made subject to it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5166.">5166.</span></span>

And he gave the cup upon Pharaoh's palm. That this signifies
instrumental to the interior natural, is evident from what has been said
above, (n. 5126), where similar words occur.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5167.">5167.</span></span>

And he hanged the prince of the bakers. That this signifies that the
sensuous things of the will part were rejected, is also evident from
what has been unfolded above (n. 5156), where similar words are used.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5168.">5168.</span></span>

As Joseph interpreted to them. That this signifies prediction from the
celestial in the natural, is evident from the signification of
"interpreting," as being to say what the dream has in it, or what is
within it, and also what would happen (see n. 5093, 5105, 5107, 5141),
thus to predict; and from the representation of Joseph, as being the
celestial in the natural (n. 5086, 5087, 5106). How it was that the
sensuous things of the intellectual part were retained, and those of the
will part rejected, may be seen above (n. 5157). \[2\] The subject
treated of in the internal sense of this chapter is the subordination of
the exterior natural, which is to be made subordinate in order that it
may serve the interior natural as a plane (n. 5165); for unless it is
made subordinate, interior truths and goods, and consequently interior
thoughts which have in them what is spiritual and celestial, have not
anything in which they can be represented; for they are presented in the
exterior natural as in their face, or as in a mirror; and therefore when
there is no subordination the man can have no interior thought; nay, he
cannot have any faith; for there is no comprehension, whether distant or
eminent, and therefore no perception of such things. The only thing that
can make the natural subordinate, and reduce it to correspondence, is
the good in which there is innocence, which good in the Word is called
"charity." Sensuous things and memory-knowledges are only the means into
which this good may flow, and in which it may present itself in form,
and unfold itself for every use; but without this good in them,
memory-knowledges, even if the very truths of faith, are nothing but
scales among filth, which fall off. \[3\] But how through good by means
of memory-knowledges and truths of faith exterior things are reduced
into order, and to correspondence with interior things, is at this day
further from apprehension than it was formerly; and this for several
reasons, the chief of which is that at this day there is no longer
charity within the church; for it is the last time of the church, and
therefore there is no affection of knowing such things. For this reason
somewhat of aversion at once shows itself when anything is said that is
within or above sensuous things, and consequently when anything of
angelic wisdom is set forth. But as such things are in the internal
sense (for the things contained in this sense are adapted to angelic
wisdom), and as the Word is now being unfolded in respect to the
internal sense, they must be declared, however remote they will appear
from what is sensuous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5169.">5169.</span></span>

And the prince of the butlers did not remember Joseph. That this
signifies that there was not as yet conjunction in every way with the
celestial of the natural, is evident from the signification of
"remembering Joseph," as being the reception of faith (of which above,
see n. 5130), and consequently conjunction, because conjunction is
effected by means of faith; here therefore "not remembering" means that
there was not as yet conjunction in every way; and from the
representation of the prince of the butlers, as being the sensuous of
the intellectual part; and from the representation of Joseph, as being
the celestial of the natural (of which above).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5170.">5170.</span></span>

And he forgot him. That this signifies removal, is evident from the
signification of "forgetting," when not remembering is non-conjunction,
as being removal; for it is according to non-conjunction that removal
takes place. That which falls into oblivion is also removed. And such
also is the case with the sensuous things subject to the intellectual
part, for those which are retained are not therefore conjoined, for they
are not yet free from fallacies, but as fast as they are purified they
are conjoined. Of this however more will be said in the following
chapter, where the butler is said to have remembered Joseph.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5171.">5171.</span></span>

Continuation concerning the correspondence with the Grand Man, here
concerning the correspondence therewith of the interior viscera. To what
provinces angelic societies belong may be known in the other life from
their situation relatively to the human body, and also from their
operation and influx; for they flow into and operate upon that organ or
member in which they are, but their influx and operation can be
perceived only by those who are in the other life, and not by man unless
his interiors are opened to that extent, nor even then unless the Lord
gives him a sensitive reflection joined with perception.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5172.">5172.</span></span>

There are certain upright spirits who think without any meditation, and
who therefore rapidly and as it were without premeditation utter
whatever occurs to their thought. They have an interior perception,
which does not become so visual by means of meditations and thoughts as
is the case with others; for in the course of their lives they have been
as it were self-instructed about the goodness of things, but not so much
so about the truth of them. I have been told that such persons belong to
the province of the Thymus Gland; for the thymus is a gland that is
especially serviceable to infants, and during that age is soft. In such
spirits likewise there remains a soft infantile quality, into which the
perception of good flows, and from which perception truth shines forth
in a general manner. These spirits are able to be in great turmoils
without being disturbed, as is also the case with the gland in question.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5173.">5173.</span></span>

In the other life there are very many methods of agitation, and also
very many methods of inaugurations into circles. The purifying in the
body of the blood, as well as of the serum or lymph, and also of the
chyle, represents these agitations, which are effected also by various
castigations; and the subsequent introducing into use of these fluids
represents the inaugurations into circles. It is a very common thing in
the other life for spirits, after undergoing agitation, to be let into a
tranquil and delightful state, thus into the societies into which they
are to be inaugurated, and to which they are to be joined. \[2\] That
the castigation and purifying of the blood, serum, and chyle, and of the
food in the stomach, correspond to such things in the spiritual world,
cannot but seem strange to those who think of nothing else in natural
things than what is natural, and especially to those who believe in
nothing else, thus denying that there is or can be anything spiritual
within natural things that acts and rules; when yet the truth is that in
all and each of the things in nature and her three kingdoms there is an
inward active force from the spiritual world; and unless this were so,
nothing whatever in the natural world could act as cause and effect, and
consequently nothing could be produced. That which is within natural
things from the spiritual world is called a force implanted from the
first creation; whereas it is an endeavor, on the cessation of which,
action or motion ceases. Hence it is that the universal visible world is
a theater representative of the spiritual world. \[3\] The case herein
is like that of the motion of the muscles from which is action; unless
there were in this motion an endeavor from man's thought and will it
would cease in a moment; for it is according to laws known in the
learned world that when endeavor ceases, motion ceases, and also that
everything of determination is in endeavor, and that in motion there is
nothing real except endeavor. It is clear that this force or endeavor in
action or motion is the spiritual in the natural; for to think and will
is spiritual, and to act and be moved is natural. It is true that those
who do not think beyond nature do not apprehend this, and yet they
cannot deny it. Nevertheless that in the will and thence in the thought,
which produces, is not alike in form to the action that is produced; for
the action merely represents that which the mind wills and thinks.

It is known that the food in the stomach is agitated in many ways, in
order that its inner elements may be extracted, and may serve for use,
that is, may pass into chyle, and then into blood; and that it is
further agitated in the intestines. Such agitations are represented by
the first agitations of spirits, which all take place according to their
life in the world, in order that evils may be separated, and goods
gathered to serve for use; and therefore it may be said of souls or
spirits that shortly after death or release from the body, they come
first as it were into the region of the stomach, and are there agitated
and purified. They in whom evils have obtained the ascendancy, after
being agitated with no good result, are conveyed through the stomach
into the intestines, even to the last, which are the colon and rectum,
and thence are cast forth into the privy, that is, into hell. But they
in whom goods have had the ascendancy, after some agitations and
purifications become chyle, and pass into the blood, some by a longer
and some by a shorter way, some being agitated severely, some gently,
and some scarcely at all. These last are represented in the food juices
which are at once imbibed by the veins and carried into the circulation,
even into the brain; and so on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5175.">5175.</span></span>

For when a man dies and enters the other life, his life is circumstanced
like food, which is softly taken hold of by the lips and is then passed
through the mouth, fauces, and esophagus, into the stomach, and this
according to the nature that has been contracted in the life of the body
by means of various activities. At first most spirits are treated
gently, being kept in the company of angels and good spirits, which is
represented by the food being first touched softly by the lips, and then
tasted by the tongue to discover its quality. Food that is soft, and in
which there is what is sweet, oily, and spirituous, is at once absorbed
by the veins, and carried into the circulation; but food that is hard,
and in which there is what is bitter, noisome, and but little
nutritious, is mastered with more difficulty, being let down through the
esophagus into the stomach, where it is churned in various ways and
windings; and food that is still harder, more noisome, and innutritious,
is thrust down into the intestines, and at last into the rectum, where
first is hell; and finally it is cast out, and becomes excrement. It is
similar with the life of man after death. He is at first kept in
externals, and because in these he had led a civil and moral life, he is
with angels and upright spirits; but after external things are taken
away from him it becomes plain of what quality he had been inwardly in
respect to his thoughts and affections, and finally in respect to his
ends, his life remaining according to these last.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5176.">5176.</span></span>

So long as spirits are in the state in which they are like food in the
stomach, so long they are not in the Grand Man, but are being introduced
into it; but when they are representatively in the blood, they are then
in the Grand Man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5177.">5177.</span></span>

They who have been very solicitous about the future, and especially they
who have therefore become grasping and avaricious, appear in the region
where the stomach is. Many have appeared to me there. The sphere of
their life may be compared to a sickening smell which is exhaled from
the stomach, and also to the heaviness from indigestion. They who have
been of this character stay long in this region, because solicitude
about the future, when confirmed by act, greatly dulls and retards the
influx of spiritual life; for they attribute to themselves that which is
of the Divine Providence; and they who do this obstruct the influx, and
take away from themselves the life of good and truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5178.">5178.</span></span>

As solicitude about things to come is what produces anxieties in man,
and as such spirits appear in the region of the stomach, therefore
anxieties affect the stomach more than the other viscera. It has also
been given me to perceive how these anxieties are increased and
diminished by the presence and removal of the spirits referred to. Some
anxieties were perceived interiorly, some more exteriorly, some more
above, and some more below, according to the difference of such
solicitude as to origin, derivation, and direction. It is for this
reason also that when such anxieties take possession of the mind, the
region about the stomach is constricted, and at times pain is felt
there, and the anxieties also seem to rise up from there; and hence also
it is that when man is no longer solicitous about the future, or when
everything turns out well for him so that he no longer is fearful of any
misfortune, the region about the stomach is relieved and expands, and he
feels delight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5179.">5179.</span></span>

I once observed an anxious feeling in the lower part of the stomach,
from which it was evident to me that such spirits were present. I spoke
with them, and said that they should go away, because their sphere
induced anxiety and did not agree with the spheres of the spirits who
were with me. I then discoursed with them about spheres, saying that
there are very many spiritual spheres about man, and that men do not
know nor desire to know that such is the case, because they deny all
that which is called spiritual, and some whatever is not seen and
touched; thus that certain spheres from the spiritual world encompass
man, agreeing with his life, and that by means of them man is in company
with spirits of similar affection, and that many things take place
thereby which the man who attributes all things to nature either denies
or ascribes to a more occult nature-as for example that which is
ascribed to fortune; for by their experience some persons are fully
persuaded that something called fortune is secretly at work, but they
know not what is the source of it. That this hidden something is from a
spiritual sphere, and is the ultimate of Providence, will of the Lord's
Divine mercy be shown elsewhere, from what has been attested by
experience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5180.">5180.</span></span>

There are genii and spirits who induce upon the head a kind of suction
or drawing, in such a way as to cause pain in the part affected. I
noticed a distinct feeling of suction, as if a membrane were being very
sensibly sucked up. I doubt whether others could have borne this on
account of the pain; but having become accustomed to it, I have at last
often borne it without pain. The chief place of the suction was on the
top of the head; and from there it spread toward the region of the left
ear, and also toward the region of the left eye. That which spread
toward the eye was from spirits, and that which spread toward the ear
was from genii. Both of these belong to the province of the receptacle
and ducts of the chyle, whither also the chyle is drawn from all
quarters, although at the same time it is driven there. There were also
others, who acted within the head in almost the same way, but not with
so great a force of suction. It was said that these are they to whom the
subtle chyle corresponds, which is brought toward the brain and there
mingled with new animal spirit, in order that it may be sent down toward
the heart. They who acted outwardly were first seen by me on the front
side, a little to the left, and afterward in a higher position there; so
that their region was observed to be from the plane of the septum of the
nose rising toward the plane of the left ear. \[2\] They who constitute
this province are of two kinds, some being quite modest, while others
are wanton. The modest are they who have desired to know men's thoughts
for the purpose of alluring and binding them to themselves (for one who
knows another's thoughts, knows also his secret and inner things, and
this effects conjunction), the end being social interaction and
friendship. These desire to know only what is good in men, exploring
this and putting a good interpretation on everything else. But the
wanton desire and endeavor in many ways to find out the thoughts of
others, with a view either of making capital of them or of doing harm;
and because they are in such a desire and endeavor, they keep the
person's mind fixed on the thing they desire to know, never giving way,
yielding an affectionate assent, and thus drawing out even the secret
thoughts. In the other life they act in a similar manner in the
societies there, and still more artfully; for there they do not allow
the other to wander from his idea, which they also kindle into activity,
and thus lure it forth. By this means they afterward hold the others as
it were in bonds, and under their control, being privy to their evils.
But these spirits are among the wandering spirits, and are often
chastised.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5181.">5181.</span></span>

From the circles above referred to it may also somewhat be known to what
province in the Grand Man, and correspondently in the body, spirits and
angels belong. The circles of those who belong to the province of the
Lymphatics are slight and rapid, like gently flowing water, so that
scarcely any circling can be perceived. They who belong to the
lymphatics are afterward conveyed into places which they said have
reference to the Mesentery, and where I was told that there are as it
were labyrinths, and that they are afterward taken away to various
places in the Grand Man to serve for use, as is done with the chyle in
the body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5182.">5182.</span></span>

There are circles into which recent spirits have to be inaugurated in
order that they may be able to be in the companionship of others, and
both speak and think together with them. In the other life there must be
a concord and unanimity of all, in order that they may be a one; just as
is the case with each and all things in man, which though everywhere
various, yet by being of one accord make a one. It is similar in the
Grand Man; and to this end the thought and speech of one must be in
accord with those of others. It is a fundamental necessity that the
thought and speech should accord together in every individual in a
society; otherwise a discordance like a disagreeable grating noise is
perceived, which strikes harshly on the minds of the others. Moreover,
everything discordant tends to disunite, and is impure, and must be
rejected. This impurity arising from discord is represented by the
impurity with and in the blood, from which it needs to be cleansed. This
cleansing is effected by means of agitations, which are nothing else
than temptations of various kinds; and afterward by means of
introduction into circles. The first introduction into circles takes
place in order that the spirits may be accommodated together; the second
is in order that the thought and speech may be in accord; the third is
that the spirits may agree together as to thoughts and affections; and
the fourth is that they may agree in truths and goods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5183.">5183.</span></span>

It has been granted me to observe the circles of those who belong to the
province of the Liver, and this for the space of an hour. The circles
were gentle, flowing about variously in accordance with the working of
this viscus, and they affected me with much delight. Their working is
diverse, but is usually orbicular. That their working is diverse is
represented also in the functions of the liver, which are diverse; for
the liver draws in blood and separates it, pouring the better part into
the veins, sending away that of a middle quality into the hepatic duct,
and leaving the viler part for the gall bladder. This is the case in
adults; but in embryos the liver receives the blood from the womb of the
mother, and purifies it, insinuating the purer part into the veins, that
it may flow into the heart by a shorter way, thus acting as a guard
before the heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5184.">5184.</span></span>

They who belong to the Pancreas act by a sharper mode, and as it were in
a sawing manner, and with a buzzing sound like that of sawing, which
comes audibly to the ears of spirits, but not to those of man unless he
is in the spirit while in the body. Their region is between the region
of the spleen and that of the liver, more to the left. They who are in
the province of the Spleen are almost directly over the head; but their
working falls on the organ in question.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5185.">5185.</span></span>

There are spirits who relate to the Pancreatic, Hepatic, and Cystic
Ducts, and consequently to the biles in them, which the intestines cast
out. These spirits are of different kinds, but act in consort according
to the state of those to whom the working is directed. They present
themselves chiefly at chastisements and punishments, which they desire
to direct. The worst of them are so stubborn that they are not willing
to desist unless deterred by fears and threats; for they dread
sufferings, and then promise anything. They are those who in the life of
the body have clung tenaciously to their opinions, not so much from evil
of life as from a natural depravity. When they are in their natural
state they think nothing; to think nothing is to think obscurely of many
things together, and not distinctly of anything. Their delight is to
chastise, and in this way to do good; nor do they abstain from things
unclean.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5186.">5186.</span></span>

They who constitute the province of the Gall bladder are at the back.
They are those who in the life of the body have despised what is
upright, and in a certain way what is pious; and also those who have
brought these things into disrepute.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5187.">5187.</span></span>

A certain spirit came to me, inquiring whether I knew where he might
stay; and when, thinking him well disposed, I told him that possibly he
might stay here, there came agitating spirits of this province who
tormented him miserably. I was sorry for this, and in vain desired to
prevent it. I then noticed that I was in the province of the
gall-bladder. The agitating spirits were of those who despise what is
upright and pious. It was granted me to observe one kind of agitation
there, that consists in forcing one to speak faster than he can think.
This they effected by abstracting the speech from the thought, and by
then forcing the spirit to follow their speech, which it is painful to
do. By means of such an agitation the slow are inaugurated into a
quicker thinking and speaking.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5188.">5188.</span></span>

There are some in the world who act by artifices and lies, whence come
evils. Their quality was shown me, and also the manner in which they
act, how they employ the harmless as instruments of persuading others,
and also how they induce on them the person of having said so and so,
when yet they have said nothing of the kind. In a word, they use evil
means to arrive at their end, whatever it may be, even such means as
deceits, lies, and artifices. Such spirits have reference to the sores
called Spurious Tubercles, which usually grow on the pleura and other
membranes; and wherever these sores take firm hold they spread their
poison widely, until at last they bring decay upon the whole membrane.
\[2\] Such spirits are severely punished; but their punishment is
different from that of others, being effected by means of whirlings; for
they are whirled round from left to right, like an orbit which at first
is a plane, but which in whirling round swells out. Afterward the
swelling seems to be pressed in and to grow hollow, whereupon the speed
is increased; and wonderful to say this is according to the form and in
imitation of such swellings or abscesses. It was observed that while
being whirled they tried to draw others, for the most part the
guiltless, into their whirl, and thus into destruction; thus that they
did not care whom they drew into perdition, so long as these seemed to
themselves to perish. \[3\] It was also observed that they have a most
intense sight, seeing as it were instantly and thereby seizing on as
means whatever is favorable; thus that they are sharper than others.
They may also be called deadly ulcers, wherever in the chamber of the
breast these may be, whether in the pleura, in the pericardium, in the
mediastinum, or in the lungs. It was shown that after punishment such
spirits are rejected to the back into the deep, and that they lie there
with the face and belly downward, having but little human life, and
being thereby deprived of their sharp-sightedness, which had been that
of a ferine life. Their hell is in a deep place under the right foot,
somewhat in front.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5189.">5189.</span></span>

There came some spirits in front; and before their coming I noticed a
sphere from evil spirits, from which I supposed that evil spirits were
approaching; but they were their enemies, as I learned from the
aggressive and hostile feeling which they inspired against them. When
they arrived they placed themselves above my head, and spoke with me,
saying that they were men. I answered that they were not men endowed
with a body such as men in the world have, who are wont to call
themselves men from the form of the body; but that nevertheless they are
men, because the spirit of the man is truly the man. To this I perceived
no dissent, for they confirmed it. They said further that they were men
who are unlike; and because it seemed impossible to me that there could
be a society in the other life of those who are unlike, I talked with
them about it, and said that if a common cause impelled them to unity,
they nevertheless could be associated, because they would thus all have
one end. They said that their quality was such that each one speaks
differently from the others, and yet they all think alike. This they
also illustrated by examples, whereby it appeared that the perception of
all was one, but that their speech was diverse. \[2\] They then applied
themselves to my left ear and said that they were good spirits, and it
was their custom so to speak. It was said of them that they come in a
body, and that no one knows where they come from. I perceived the sphere
of evil spirits to be exceedingly hostile to them; for evil spirits are
the subjects whom they agitate. Their society, which is a wandering one,
was represented by a man and a woman in a chamber, clothed with a
garment that was turned into a robe of an azure color. \[3\] It was
perceived that they have reference to the Isthmus in the brain, which is
between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, through which fibers pass, and
thence spread in various directions, and in every direction operate
diversely in the outward things; also that they have reference to the
Ganglia in the body, into which a nerve flows, and from there is divided
into a number of fibers, some of which run one way and some another,
their action being dissimilar in ultimates, and yet is from one
beginning; thus being in ultimates dissimilar in appearance, yet similar
in end. Moreover, it is known that one force acting in the extremities
can have a manifold variation, and this according to the form there.
Ends also are represented by the beginnings, such as they are in the
brain, from which are the fibers; the thoughts from these ends are
represented by the fibers from those beginnings; and the actions thence
resulting by the nerves which are composed of fibers.

A continuation about the correspondence with the Grand Man will be found
at the end of the following chapter. <span
id="fr_132"></span>[5190-1](#fn_132.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5191.">5191.</span></span>

The Contents. In the internal sense of this chapter the subject treated
of is the second state of the celestial of the spiritual, which is
"Joseph," in its elevation above what is of the natural or external man,
and so above all the memory-knowledges therein, which are "Egypt."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5192.">5192.</span></span>

"Pharaoh" is the natural in general, which was now at rest, and had left
all things to the celestial of the spiritual which is "Joseph." The
"seven years of abundance of produce in the land of Egypt" are the
memory-knowledges to which good from the celestial of the spiritual can
be applied; the "seven years of famine" are the following states, when
there is nothing good in the memory-knowledges except what is from the
Divine celestial of the spiritual which is from the Lord's Divine Human.
These subjects are treated of in detail in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5193.">5193.</span></span>

The Internal Sense. Verses 1-4. And it came to pass from the end of two
years of days and Pharaoh dreamed, and behold he stood by the river. And
behold out of the river there came up seven kine, beautiful in look and
fat in flesh; and they fed in the sedge. And behold seven other kine
came up after them out of the river, evil in look and thin in flesh; and
stood by the kine upon the bank of the river. And the kine evil in look
and thin in flesh did eat up the seven kine beautiful in look and fat.
And Pharaoh awoke. "And it came to pass from the end of two years of
days," signifies after a state of conjunction; "and Pharaoh dreamed,"
signifies what was provided in regard to the natural; "and behold he
stood by the river," signifies from boundary to boundary; "and behold
out of the river," signifies that in the boundary; "there came up seven
kine," signifies were truths of the natural; "beautiful in look,"
signifies that were of faith; "and fat in flesh," signifies that were of
charity; "and they fed in the sedge," signifies instruction; "and behold
seven other kine came up after them out of the river," signifies
falsities that were of the natural also in the boundary; "evil in look,"
signifies that were not of faith; "and thin in flesh," signifies nor of
charity; "and stood by the kine upon the bank of the river," signifies
that they were in the boundaries where truths were; "and the kine evil
in look and thin in flesh did eat up," signifies that the falsities
which were not of faith nor of charity banished; "the seven kine
beautiful in look and fat," signifies the truths of the natural that
were of faith and of charity; "and Pharaoh awoke," signifies a state of
enlightenment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5194.">5194.</span></span>

And it came to pass from the end of two years of days. That this
signifies after a state of conjunction of the sensuous things of the
exterior natural with things of the interior natural, which has been
treated of in the preceding chapter, is evident from the signification
of "two years of days," or of the time of two years, as being states of
conjunction; for "two" signifies conjunction (see n. 1686, 3519), and
"years," as also "days," signify states. (That "years" have this
signification can also be seen above, n. 487, 488, 493, 893; and also
"days," n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850.) That "two"
signifies conjunction is because all things in general and in particular
in the spiritual world, and consequently in the natural world, have
reference to two things, namely, good and truth-to good as what acts and
flows in, and to truth as what suffers and receives; and because they
have reference to these two, and nothing is produced unless the two make
a one by a certain image of marriage, therefore conjunction is signified
by "two." \[2\] Such an image of marriage is in all and each of the
things of nature and its three kingdoms, and without it nothing whatever
comes forth; for in order that anything may come forth in nature, there
must be heat and light-heat in the natural world corresponding to the
good of love in the spiritual world, and light corresponding to the
truth of faith. These two, heat and light, must act as a one if anything
is to be produced; and if they do not act as a one, as in winter time,
nothing at all is produced. That this is also true spiritually, is very
plain in the case of man. Man has two faculties, the will and the
understanding, the will being formed to receive spiritual heat, that is,
the good of love and of charity, and the understanding to receive
spiritual light, that is, the truth of faith. Unless these two make a
one in man nothing is produced; for the good of love without the truth
of faith does not determine or qualify anything, and the truth of faith
without the good of love does not effect anything; and therefore in
order that the heavenly marriage may be in a man, or that he may be in
the heavenly marriage, these two must make a one in him. For this reason
the ancients compared to marriages one and all of the things in the
world, and also in man (n. 54, 55, 568, 718, 747, 917, 1432, 2173, 2516,
2731, 2739, 2758, 3132, 4434, 4823, 5138). From this it is evident why
"two" signifies conjunction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5195.">5195.</span></span>

And Pharaoh dreamed. That this signifies what was provided in regard to
the natural, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the
natural (see n. 5079, 5080, 5095, 5160); and from the signification of
"dreaming," as being a prediction of things to come, thus in the supreme
sense foresight (n. 3698, 4682, 5091, 5092, 5104); and because it is
foresight, or what is foreseen, it is also providence or what is
provided, as the one does not exist without the other. For providence
has regard to the state in its successions to eternity, which cannot be
provided for unless foreseen. To make provision for what is present, and
not at the same time to foresee what is to come, and so not to make
provision for the future during the present, would be without end,
without order, and consequently without wisdom and intelligence, thus
not from the Divine. Providence is predicated of good, and foresight of
what is not good (n. 5155). Foresight cannot be predicated of good,
because good is in the Divine, and comes into existence from the Divine
Itself and according to it; but it can be predicated of what is not good
and what is evil; for this comes into existence outside of the Divine,
and is from others who are contrary to the Divine. Thus as providence is
said of good, it is said also of the conjunction of the natural with the
celestial of the spiritual, which conjunction is treated of in this
chapter; and therefore by "dreaming" is here signified what is provided.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5196.">5196.</span></span>

And behold he stood by the river. That this signifies from boundary to
boundary, is evident from the signification of a "river," here the river
of Egypt or the Nile, as being a boundary. A "river" signifies a
boundary because the great rivers-the Euphrates, the Jordan, and the
Nile-and withal the sea, were the farthest boundaries of the land of
Canaan; and as the land of Canaan itself represented the Lord's kingdom,
and hence all the places in it represented various things in this
kingdom, the rivers consequently represented the farthest limits or
boundaries of it (see n. 1866, 4116, 4240). The Nile, or river of Egypt,
represented the sensuous things subject to the intellectual part, thus
the memory-knowledges derived from them; for these are the ultimates of
the spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom. That from boundary to
boundary is signified here, is because it is said of Pharaoh that he
"stood by the river;" for by Pharaoh is represented the natural in
general (n. 5160). To view anything from what is interior down to the
ultimate is represented by standing beside the ultimate, as is the case
in the spiritual world; and because there is then a view from boundary
to boundary, therefore in the internal sense this is what is signified
by these words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5197.">5197.</span></span>

And behold out of the river. That this signifies that in the boundary,
is evident from the signification of a "river," as being a boundary (as
shown just above, see n. 5196). That "out of the river" denotes in the
boundary is because they there appeared.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5198.">5198.</span></span>

There came up seven kine. That this signifies were truths of the
natural, is evident from the signification of "kine," as being truths of
the natural (of which presently). That there were seven, is because
"seven" signifies what is holy (see n. 395, 433, 716), and hence this
number adds holiness to the subject (see n. 881). Moreover, the subject
here treated of is holy, for it is the further rebirth of the natural by
its conjunction with the celestial of the spiritual. That "kine" or
"heifers" signify truths of the natural may be seen from the fact that
"oxen" and "bullocks" signify goods of the natural (n. 2180, 2566, 2781,
2830); for wherever in the Word the male signifies good, the female
signifies truth; and on the other hand where the male signifies truth,
the female signifies good. Hence it is that a "cow" signifies the truth
of the natural, for an "ox" signifies its good. \[2\] (That all beasts
whatever mentioned in the Word signify affections-evil and useless
beasts evil affections, but gentle and useful ones good affections-may
be seen above, n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 776, 1823, 2179,
2180, 3218, 3519.) The cause of this signification is from
representatives in the world of spirits; for when those in heaven are
speaking about affections, in the world of spirits are represented
beasts corresponding to that kind of affections. This has often been
given me to see, and I have sometimes wondered why it was; but I
perceived that the lives of beasts are nothing but affections, for they
follow their affection from instinct without reason, and so are carried
along each to its own use. To these affections without reason no other
bodily forms are suitable than such as those in which beasts appear upon
the earth. Hence it is that when there is discourse about affections
only, ultimate forms of these affections appear that are similar to the
bodily forms of such beasts; for these affections cannot be clothed with
any other forms than those which correspond to them. I have also seen
strange beasts which exist nowhere in the world, and which were the
forms of unknown and of mixed affections. \[3\] This then is the reason
why in the Word by "beasts" are signified affections; but what
affections are signified appears only from the internal sense. That by
"oxen" is signified the good of the natural may be seen in the passages
cited above, and that by "kine" are signified truths of the natural may
be seen from the passages in which they are mentioned (as in Isaiah
11:7; Hosea 4:16; Amos 4:1); and also from the water of separation
wherewith the sons of Israel were to be made clean, which was prepared
from a red cow burned to ashes outside the camp, and with which cedar
wood, hyssop, and double-dyed scarlet were mingled (Num. 19:2-11). When
the meaning of this proceeding is disclosed by means of the internal
sense, it is seen that by a "red cow" is signified truth of the natural
that was unclean, and was made clean by the burning and also by means of
such things as are signified by "cedar wood," "hyssop," and "double-dyed
scarlet;" the "water" therefrom representing the means of purification.

Beautiful in look. That this signifies that were of faith, is evident
from the signification of "beauty" and of "look." Spiritual beauty is
the affection of interior truth, and spiritual look is faith; hence by
"beautiful in look" is signified the affection of the truth of faith
(see n. 553, 3080, 3821, 4985). That spiritual beauty is the affection
of interior truth, is because truth is the form of good. Good itself
which is from the Divine in heaven is that from which angels have life;
but the form of their life is given by means of the truths which are
from this good. And yet beauty is not produced by the truth of faith,
but by the affection itself within the truths of faith, which is from
good. Beauty that is from the truth of faith alone is like that of a
painted or sculptured face; but beauty from the affection of truth,
which is from good, is like that of a living face animated by heavenly
love; for such as is the love or affection that beams from the form of
the face, such is the beauty. From this it is that the angels appear in
ineffable beauty; from their faces beams forth the good of love through
the truth of faith, which not only appear before the sight, but are also
perceived from the spheres coming from them. The reason why they have
beauty from this is that the universal heaven is a Grand Man, and
corresponds to all things in man both in general and in particular; and
therefore the man who is in the good of love, and hence in the truth of
faith, is in the form of heaven, and consequently is in the beauty in
which heaven is, where the Divine from the Lord is all in all. It is for
this reason also that they who are in hell, being against good and
truth, are horribly ugly; and that in the light of heaven they appear
not as men, but as monsters. The reason why spiritual looking is faith,
is that in the internal sense "to look" and "to see" are to understand,
and in a still more interior sense are to have faith (see n. 897, 2150,
2325, 2807, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5200.">5200.</span></span>

And fat in flesh. That this signifies that were of charity, is evident
from the signification of "fat," or "fatness," as being what is
celestial and as being predicated of the good which is of love and
charity (see n. 353); and from the signification of "flesh," as being
the will vivified by good from the Lord (n. 148, 149, 780, 999, 3812,
3813), thus also the good which is of love and charity. From this it
follows that by "fat in flesh" is signified that were of charity,
because by "beautiful in look" is signified that were of faith. In this
way the truths of the natural, signified by "kine," are described by
their form and by their essence-their form consisting of the things of
faith, and their essence of those of charity. That this is so does not
appear from the literal sense.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[5190-1](ac104.htm#fr_132.md) End of Volume 4 of
the original Latin work. Genesis 41 1. And it came to pass from the end
of two years of days and Pharaoh dreamed, and behold he stood by the
river. 2. And behold out of the river there came up seven kine,
beautiful in look and fat in flesh; and they fed in the sedge. 3. And
behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river, evil in
look and thin in flesh; and stood by the kine upon the bank of the
river. 4. And the kine evil in look and thin in flesh did eat up the
seven kine beautiful in look and fat. And Pharaoh awoke. 5. And he slept
and dreamed a second time, and behold seven ears of corn came up upon
one stalk, fat and good. 6. And behold seven ears thin and parched with
the east wind sprung up after them. 7. And the thin ears swallowed up
the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold it was a
dream. 8. And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was
troubled; and he sent and called all the magicians of Egypt, and all the
wise men thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dream; and no one
interpreted these things to Pharaoh. 9. And spoke the prince of the
butlers unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my sins this day. 10.
Pharaoh was wroth upon his servants, and put me in custody in the house
of the prince of the guards, me and the prince of the bakers: 11. And we
dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each one according to
the interpretation of his dream. 12. And there was with us there a
Hebrew boy, servant to the prince of the guards; and we told him, and he
interpreted to us our dreams; to each according to his dream he did
interpret. 13. And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was;
me he brought back upon my station, and him he hanged. 14. And Pharaoh
sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the pit; and
he shaved, and changed his garments, and came unto Pharaoh. 15. And
Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and no one
interpreteth it; and I have heard upon thee, saying, thou hearest a
dream to interpret it. 16. And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, Not unto
me; God shall answer peace to Pharaoh. 17. And Pharaoh spoke unto
Joseph, In my dream behold I stood beside the bank of the river: 18. And
behold out of the river there came up seven kine, fat in flesh and
beautiful in form, and they fed in the sedge: 19. And behold seven other
kine came up after them, thin and evil in form exceedingly, and lean in
flesh, such as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt for badness:
20. And the lean and evil kine did eat up the first seven fat kine; 21.
And they came to their inwards and it was not known that they had come
to their inwards; and their look was bad as in the beginning. And I
awoke. 22. And I saw in my dream, and behold seven ears came up upon one
stalk, full and good; 23. And behold seven ears, withered, thin, and
parched with the east wind, sprung up after them; 24. And the thin ears
swallowed up the seven good ears; and I told it unto the magicians; and
no one telleth it to me. 25. And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of
Pharaoh is one; what God is about to do He hath shown to Pharaoh. 26.
The seven good kine are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven
years: the dream is one. 27. And the seven thin and evil kine that came
up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears parched with the
east wind shall be seven years of famine. 28. This is the word that I
spoke unto Pharaoh; what God doeth He hath caused Pharaoh to see. 29.
Behold there come seven years of great abundance of produce in all the
land of Egypt; 30. And there shall arise after them seven years of
famine; and all the abundance of produce shall be forgotten in the land
of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; 31. And the abundance
of produce shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine after
it, for it shall be very grievous. 32. And for that the dream was
doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the word is established by
God, and God is hastening to do it. 33. And now let Pharaoh see a man
intelligent and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 34. Let
Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint governors over the land, and take
the fifth of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance of
produce. 35. And let them gather all the food of those good years that
come, and heap up corn under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities,
and let them guard it. 36. And the food shall be for a store to the land
against the seven years of famine that shall be in the land of Egypt;
and the land shall not be cut off in the famine. 37. And the word was
good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 38.
And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Shall we find such a one as this, a
man in whom is the spirit of God? 39. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
Forasmuch as God has caused thee to know all this, there is no one so
intelligent and wise as thou. 40. Thou shalt be over my house, and upon
thy mouth shall all my people kiss; only in the throne will I be greater
than thou. 41. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over
all the land of Egypt. 42. And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his
hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine
linen, and put a necklace of gold upon his neck; 43. And he made him
ride in the second chariot that he had; and they cried before him,
Abrech; and he set him over all the land of Egypt. 44. And Pharaoh said
unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his
hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt. 45. And Pharaoh called
Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath the daughter of
Potiphera priest of On for a woman; and Joseph went out over the land of
Egypt. 46. And Joseph was a son of thirty years when he stood before
Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from before Pharaoh, and
passed over into all the land of Egypt. 47. And the earth made
gatherings in the seven years of abundance of produce. 48. And he
gathered together all the food of the seven years that were in the land
of Egypt, and put the food in the cities; the food of the field of the
city, that which was round about it, put he in the midst thereof. 49.
And Joseph heaped up corn as the sand of the sea, exceeding much, until
he ceased to number, because it was without number. 50. And to Joseph
were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath the
daughter of Potiphera priest of On bare to him. 51. And Joseph called
the name of the firstborn Manasseh; For God hath made me forget all my
toil, and all my father's house. 52. And the name of the second called
he Ephraim; For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.
53. And the seven years of abundance of produce that was in the land of
Egypt, were ended. 54. And the seven years of famine began to come, as
Joseph had said; and there was famine in all the lands; and in all the
land of Egypt there was bread. 55. And all the land of Egypt was
famished, and the people cried unto Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said
to all Egypt, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 56. And the
famine was over all the faces of the land; and Joseph opened all the
storehouses, and sold to Egypt; and the famine was strengthened in the
land of Egypt. 57. And all the earth came into Egypt to buy, to Joseph;
because the famine was strengthened in all the earth.
