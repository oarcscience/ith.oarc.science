### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="5701.">5701.</span></span>

Because the Egyptians cannot eat bread with the Hebrews. That this
signifies that they could not possibly be conjoined with the truth and
good of the church, is evident from the representation of the Egyptians,
as being those who are in inverted order, thus in evil and falsity (of
which just above, n. 5700); from the signification of "eating bread," as
being to be conjoined (of which also above, n. 5698); and from the
representation of the Hebrews, as being those who are in genuine order,
thus in the truth and good of the church. (That by the "land of the
Hebrews" is signified the church may be seen above, n. 5136, 5236, and
this because the Hebrew Church was the second Ancient Church, n. 1238,
1241, 1343.) "Eating bread" is mentioned here, and above "setting on
bread," because by "bread" is signified all food in general (n. 2165),
thus the banquet. The reason why by "bread" is signified all food and
the banquet itself, is that in the spiritual sense "bread" is celestial
love, and celestial love contains within it all things of good and
truth, thus all things of spiritual food. (That "bread" is celestial
love may be seen above, n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 2187, 3464, 3478, 3735,
4211, 4217, 4735, 4976.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5702.">5702.</span></span>

Because this is an abomination to the Egyptians. That this signifies
that they are in opposition, is evident from the representation of the
Egyptians, as being those who are in inverted order (see n. 5700); and
from the representation of the Hebrews, to eat with whom was an
abomination to the Egyptians, as being those who are in genuine order
(n. 5701); thus they are in opposition to each other, whence comes
aversion, and at last abomination. In regard to this abomination be it
known that those who are in inverted order, that is, in evil and the
derivative falsity, become at last so averse to the good and truth of
the church that when they hear them, and especially when they hear the
interior things of them, they so greatly abominate them that they feel
as it were a nausea and vomiting. This has been told and shown me, when
I have wondered why the Christian world does not receive these interior
things of the Word. There appeared spirits from the Christian world who,
on being compelled to hear the interiors of the Word, were seized with
so great a nausea that they said they felt as if they were going to
vomit; and I was told that such is the Christian world at this day
almost everywhere. The reason of its being so is that they are in no
affection of truth for truth's sake, still less in the affection of good
from good. Their thinking and speaking anything from the Word or from
their doctrine is from habit acquired from early childhood, and from the
established form; thus it is an external without an internal. \[2\] That
all things of the Hebrew Church that was afterward instituted among
Jacob's descendants were an abomination to the Egyptians, is plain not
only from their being unwilling even to eat with them, but also from the
sacrifices which the Hebrew Church regarded as the chief part of its
worship being an abomination to them, as is evident in Moses: Pharaoh
said, Go ye, sacrifice in the land; but Moses said, It is not meet so to
do; because we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to
Jehovah our God; lo if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
before their eyes will they not stone us? (Exod. 8:25, 26). The
pasturing of flocks, and a shepherd also, were an abomination to them,
as is plain in Moses: Every shepherd of a flock is an abomination unto
the Egyptians (Gen. 46:34). Thus the Egyptians abominated everything
that belonged to that church. The reason was that at first the Egyptians
had been among those who constituted the Ancient representative Church
(n. 1238, 2385); but in course of time they rejected the God of the
Ancient Church, that is, Jehovah or the Lord, and served idols,
especially calves; and they also turned into magic the very
representatives and significatives of the celestial and spiritual things
of the Ancient Church, which they had learned when they belonged to that
church. Hence order was inverted with them, and consequently all things
of the church were an abomination to them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5703.">5703.</span></span>

And they sat before him. That this signifies that they were set in order
by his presence, is evident from the signification of "sitting," as here
being to be set in order, for they were placed in order by Joseph, as
appears from what follows (for they were amazed that the firstborn
should sit according to his birthright, and the youngest according to
his youth); and from the signification of "before him," as being by his
presence. The case herein is this. In the supreme sense by Joseph is
represented the Lord, and by Israel's sons, the goods and truths in the
natural; when the Lord is present, then all things are set in order by
His very presence. The Lord is order itself; and therefore where He is
present there is order, and where there is order He is present. The
order itself is described in the pages that now follow, which is that
truths be rightly set in order under good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5704.">5704.</span></span>

The firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to
his youth. That this signifies according to the order of truths under
good, is evident from the signification of "sitting according to
birthright and according to youth," as being according to the order of
truths under good; for the sons of Israel represent the truths of the
church in their order (see the explication of the twenty-ninth and
thirtieth chapters of Genesis); and therefore to sit "according to their
birth" is according to the order of truths. But the truths of the church
which the sons of Israel represent do not come into any order except
through Christian good, that is, through the good of charity toward the
neighbor and of love to the Lord; for in good there is the Lord, and
hence in good there is heaven; consequently in good there is life, thus
living active force; but never in truth without good. That good sets
truths in order after its own likeness is very manifest from every love,
even from the loves of self and of the world, thus from the love of
revenge, of hatred, and of the like evils. They who are in these evils
call evil good, because to them evil is delightful. This so-called good
of theirs sets in order the falsities which to them are truths, so that
they may favor it, and at last sets all these falsities which they call
truths in such an order as to effect persuasion. But this order is such
as is the order in hell; whereas the order of truths under the good of
celestial love is such as is the order in the heavens; and from this the
man who has such order within him, that is, who has been regenerated, is
called a little heaven, and moreover is a heaven in the least form, for
his interiors correspond to the heavens. \[2\] That it is good which
sets truths in order is evident from the order in the heavens. There all
the societies are set in order according to the truths under good which
are from the Lord; for the Lord is nothing but Divine good; Divine truth
is not in the Lord, but proceeds from Him; and according to this Divine
truth under Divine good are all the societies in the heavens set in
order. That the Lord is nothing but Divine good, and that Divine truth
is not in Him, but proceeds from Him, may be illustrated by comparison
with the sun of the world. The sun is nothing but fire, and light is not
in it, but proceeds from it; and likewise the things that are of light
in the world, such as vegetable forms, are set in order by the heat
which proceeds from the sun's fire and is in its light, as is evident in
the time of spring and summer. As universal nature is a theater
representative of the Lord's kingdom, so also is this universal. The sun
represents the Lord, the fire of it His Divine love, and the heat from
it the good which flows therefrom, and the light the truths which are of
faith; and because they are representative, therefore in the Word in the
spiritual sense by the "sun" is meant the Lord (see n. 1053, 1521,
1529-1531, 3636, 3643, 4321, 5097, 5377), and by "fire" love (n. 934,
4906, 5071, 5215); thus the sun's fire is representatively the Divine
love, and the heat from it is good from the Divine love. (That light
represents truth may be seen above, n. 2776, 3138, 3190, 3195, 3222,
3339, 3636, 3643, 3862, 3993, 4302, 4409, 4413, 4415, 4526, 5219, 5400.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5705.">5705.</span></span>

And the men were amazed, everyone at his companion. That this signifies
a change of state of each one among them, is evident from the
signification of "to be amazed," as being an unexpected and sudden
change of state in the thoughts, which being the cause of the amazement
is signified in the internal sense; and from the signification of
"everyone at his companion," as being of each one among them; for the
subject treated of is the order of truths under good caused by the
presence of the internal (see n. 5703, 5704), and as the order is new,
there is therefore a change of state of each one among them, which is
signified by "the men being amazed, everyone at his companion."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5706.">5706.</span></span>

And he brought out portions from his faces unto them. That this
signifies goods applied to everyone from mercy, is evident from the
signification of "portions," namely of food, as being goods (for all
kinds of food signify goods, and drink of every kind signifies truths).
That these are applied to everyone is plain from what follows, and is
signified by "he brought out to them;" and from the signification of
"faces," when predicated of the Lord, who is represented by Joseph, as
being mercy (n. 222, 223, 5585).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5707.">5707.</span></span>

And he multiplied Benjamin's portion above the portions of them all.
That this signifies good for the intermediate above the goods for the
truths in the natural, is evident from the signification of "portions,"
as being goods (of which just above, n. 5706); from the representation
of Benjamin, as being the intermediate (n. 5411, 5413, 5427, 5428, 5443,
5586, 5612); and from the representation of Jacob's ten sons, above the
portions of whom he made Benjamin's portion, as being truths in the
natural (n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512). \[2\] From this it is plain
that by his "multiplying Benjamin's portion above the portions of them
all" is signified good for the intermediate above the goods for the
truths in the natural. The reason why there was good for the
intermediate above the goods for the truths in the natural, is that the
intermediate is interior, and what is interior abounds with goods more
than that which is exterior. Few know how this is, namely, that the
interior abounds with goods and truths more than the exteriors. The
reason is that few, if any, have hitherto known that the interior is
distinct from the exterior, and indeed so distinct that they can be
separated, and that when separated the interior lives and the exterior
dies, but that so long as they are conjoined, the exterior lives from
the interior. If this had first been known, it might then have been
known what the interior is as compared with the exterior-that in the
interior there are thousands of things which in the exterior appear as
one; for the interior is in a purer sphere, and the exterior in a
grosser, and that which is in a purer sphere is capable of receiving
distinctly thousands of things more than that which is in a grosser
sphere. Hence it is that when the man who has led a life of good comes
after death into heaven, he can receive thousands of thousands more
things of intelligence and wisdom and happiness than when he lived in
the world; for in heaven he is in a purer sphere, and is in his
interiors, and has put off the grosser things of the body. From all this
it is now plain what is meant by good for the intermediate above the
goods for the truths in the natural, which is signified by his
"multiplying Benjamin's portion above the portions of them all."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5708.">5708.</span></span>

Five measures. That this signifies much increased, is evident from the
signification of "five," as being much (of which in what follows); and
from the signification of "measures," as being states of truth from good
(see n. 3104). As regards "five," it is a number that signifies a
little, likewise some, and also much. Its signification depends upon its
relation to the number of which it is a part (n. 5291): as a part of
"ten" it involves the same as ten, but in a less degree, because it is
half of the number ten; for as numbers formed by multiplication signify
the like with their simple numbers (see n. 5291, 5335), so numbers
produced by division signify the like as their multiples-for instance
"five" the same as "ten" and as "twenty" and also as "one hundred" and
"one thousand," and so on. (That "ten" denotes what is full may be seen
above, n. 3107, 4638.) Five more measures were given to Benjamin than to
the rest of his brethren because of the signification of the matter in
the internal sense; ten measures could not have been given, for they
would have been far too much. By traditions from the Most Ancient Church
the ancients knew what some numbers signified, and therefore they made
use of these numbers when anything occurred which they might serve to
signify, as here the number "five;" and in other cases they applied
several other numbers, as "three" to signify what is full from beginning
to end; "seven" to signify what is holy; "twelve" to signify all things
in their complex.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5709.">5709.</span></span>

And they drank. That this signifies the application of truths under
good, is evident from the signification of "drinking," as being the
communication and appropriation of truth (see n. 3168, 3772, 4017,
4018), hence also its application. It is "under good," because all the
application of truth is effected under good (see above, n. 5704).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5710.">5710.</span></span>

And drank largely with him. That this signifies abundantly, is evident
from the signification of "drinking," as being to apply truths under
good (of which just above, n. 5709); hence "to drink largely" denotes
abundantly. From the things unfolded in this chapter it is evident that
the subject treated of is initiation to the conjunction of the natural
with the celestial of the spiritual, and in a subsequent chapter the
first conjunction is treated of; for the first conjunction is
represented by Joseph's manifesting himself to his brethren; the second
by his going to meet his father and brethren, and bringing them down
into Egypt.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5711.">5711.</span></span>

Continuation concerning correspondence, here concerning the
correspondence of diseases with the Spiritual World. As the
correspondence of diseases is to be treated of, be it known that all
diseases in man have correspondence with the spiritual world; for
whatever in universal nature has not correspondence with the spiritual
world cannot exist, having no cause from which to exist, consequently
from which to subsist. The things that are in nature are nothing but
effects; their causes are in the spiritual world, and the causes of
these causes, which are ends, are in the interior heaven. Nor can the
effect subsist unless the cause is constantly in it, because the effect
ceases when the cause ceases. Regarded in itself the effect is nothing
else than the cause, but so clothed outwardly as to enable the cause to
act as a cause in a lower sphere. Similar to the relation of the effect
to the cause is that between the cause and the end; unless a cause also
exists from its cause, which is an end, it is not a cause; for a cause
without an end is a cause in no order, and where there is no order
nothing is effected. From this it is now plain that regarded in itself
an effect is a cause, and that regarded in itself a cause is an end, and
that an end of good is in heaven and proceeds from the Lord;
consequently that an effect is not an effect unless a cause is in it,
and constantly in it; and that a cause is not a cause unless an end is
in it, and constantly in it; and that an end is not an end of good
unless the Divine which proceeds from the Lord is in it. Hence it is
also plain that as each and all things in the world have come forth from
the Divine, they continue to come forth from the Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5712.">5712.</span></span>

These things have been said in order that it may be known that diseases
also have correspondence with the spiritual world; not a correspondence
with heaven, which is the Grand Man, but with those who are in what is
opposite, thus with those who are in the hells. By the spiritual world
in the universal sense is meant both heaven and hell; for when man dies
he passes out of the natural into the spiritual world. That diseases
have correspondence with such is because they correspond to the
cupidities and passions of the lower mind, which are also their origins;
for the origins of diseases are, in general, intemperance, luxury of
various kinds, mere bodily pleasures, as also feelings of envy, hatred,
revenge, lewdness, and the like, which destroy man's interiors; and when
these are destroyed the exteriors suffer, and drag man into disease, and
so into death. It is known in the church that the death of man is from
evils, or on account of sin; and it is the same with diseases, for these
belong to death. From all this it is evident that even diseases have
correspondence with the spiritual world, but with unclean things there;
for diseases are in themselves unclean, because as before said they
spring from unclean things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5713.">5713.</span></span>

All the infernals induce diseases, but with a difference, for the reason
that all the hells are in the desires and lusts of evil, and thus are
contrary to the things of heaven; wherefore they act upon man from what
is opposite. Heaven, which is the Grand Man, holds all things together
in connection and safety; hell, being in what is opposite, destroys and
severs all things. Consequently if the infernals are applied they induce
diseases and at last death. Yet they are not permitted to flow as far as
into the solid parts of the body, or into the parts of which man's
viscera, organs, and members consist, but merely into his cupidities and
falsities. It is only when the man falls into disease that they flow
into such unclean things as belong to the disease; for as before said
nothing ever takes place in man without a cause in the spiritual world.
If the natural with man were separated from the spiritual, it would be
separated from all cause of existence, and thus from all that is vital.
Yet this does not hinder man's being healed in a natural way; for the
Lord's providence concurs with such means. That this is so has been
given me to know by much experience, and this so often and for so long
that no doubt was left; for evil spirits from such places have been
applied to me often and long, and according to their presence they
induced pains, and also diseases. I was shown where they were, and what
they were, and was told also where they came from.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5714.">5714.</span></span>

One who in the life of the body had been a consummate adulterer, and had
made his highest delight consist in committing adultery with many women,
whom he immediately afterward discarded and held in aversion, persisted
in such practices even to old age. Moreover he had also been devoted to
pleasures, and did not desire to act well to anyone and do him a
service, except for his own sake, especially for the sake of his
adultery. He was with me for several days, being seen under the feet;
and when the sphere of his life was communicated to me, to whatever part
he came he inflicted a pain in the periosteums and nerves of that part,
as for instance in the toes of the left foot; and when he was permitted
to rise up he inflicted pain in the parts where he was, especially in
the periosteums in the loins, and in the periosteums of the breast under
the diaphragm, and also in the interior of the teeth. While his sphere
was operating it caused also great oppression in the stomach.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5715.">5715.</span></span>

There once appeared a great quadrangular opening that extended obliquely
downward to a considerable depth. In the deep was seen a round opening,
which was then open but presently was closed. From it exhaled a
dangerous heat, collected from various hells, and arising from
cupidities of various kinds, as from arrogance, lewdness, adultery,
hatred, revenge, quarrels, and fights, from which arise in the hells
such heat as exhaled. When it acted upon my body it instantly brought on
disease like that of a burning fever; but when it ceased to flow in,
this effect of disease at once ceased. When a man falls into such a
disease as he has contracted from his life, then forthwith an unclean
sphere corresponding to the disease attaches itself, and is present as a
fomenting cause. That I might know for certain that this is the case,
there have been spirits with me from a number of hells, through whom the
sphere of exhalations thence was communicated; and according as it was
permitted to act upon the solid parts of the body, I was seized with
oppression, with pain, even with the corresponding disease, which ceased
in an instant when those spirits were driven away; and that no room for
doubt might be left, this has been done a thousand times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5716.">5716.</span></span>

There are also spirits not far therefrom who infuse unclean colds, like
those of a shivering fever, as has been granted me to know by
experience. The same spirits induce such things as disturb the mind, and
they also bring on swoons. The spirits from this neighborhood are most
malicious.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5717.">5717.</span></span>

There are some who not only relate to the most viscid substances of the
brain, which are its excremental things, but also know how to infect
them as if with poisons. When such spirits arrive they rush within the
skull, and thence by continuity even into the spinal marrow. This cannot
be felt by those whose interiors are not open. It has been given me
plainly to feel the inroad, and also the effort to destroy me; but this
was vain, because I was protected by the Lord. They strove to take away
from me all the capacity of the intellect. I plainly felt their
operation, and felt also pain from it, which however soon ceased. I
afterward spoke to them, and they were compelled to confess whence they
were. They said that they lived in dark forests, where they durst not
injure their companions, because in that case their companions were
allowed to treat them cruelly. Thus they are kept in bonds. They are
ugly, having the face of a wild beast, and hairy. I was told that they
are such as had formerly slain whole armies, as we read in the Word; for
they rushed into the chambers of everyone's brain, and inspired terror,
together with such madness that they killed each other. At the present
day such spirits are kept shut up within their own hell, and are not let
out. These too bear relation to deadly tumors of the head within the
skull. It was said above that they rush within the skull and by
continuity therefrom even into the spinal marrow; but be it known that
it is only an appearance that the spirits themselves rush in, they being
borne along outside by a way which corresponds to the spaces in question
within the body, which is felt within as if there were an inroad. This
sensation is caused by correspondence, from which their operation is
easily brought to bear upon the man to whom it is directed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5718.">5718.</span></span>

There is a certain kind of spirits who, because they wish to have
dominion, and to be sole rulers over all others, to this end stir up
enmities, hatreds, and fights among others. I have seen the consequent
fights, and wondered at them. I inquired who they were, and was told
that they were that kind of spirits who excite such passions because
they are bent on being sole rulers, according to the maxim, Divide and
rule. It was also granted me to talk with them, and they immediately
said that they rule all. But it was given to answer that they were
insanity personified if they sought to establish their rule by such
means. They talked with me from above at a middle height over the
forehead. They spoke with fluency, because in the bodily life they had
excelled in eloquence. I was instructed that they are such as relate to
the thick phlegm of the brain, from which organ they take away vitality
by their presence, and induce on it torpor, whence come obstructions,
giving rise to a number of diseases, as well as to dullnesses. \[2\] It
was noticed that they were devoid of all conscience, and that they made
human prudence and wisdom to consist in stirring up enmities, hatreds,
and intestine fights, in order to rule. It was given to ask them whether
they know that they are now in the other life, where they are to live to
eternity, and that there are spiritual laws there which utterly forbid
such actions, and that while they were in the world they might among
fools be esteemed and believed to be wise, but that among the wise they
are insane. This displeased them. I continued, that they ought to know
that heaven consists in mutual love, or that of one toward another,
whence there is order in heaven, whereby so many myriads are ruled as
one; but that the contrary is the case with them, because they instigate
others to breathe against their companions nothing but what savors of
hatred, revenge, and cruelty. They replied that they cannot be other
than they are; whereupon it was given to say that from this they may
know that everyone's life remains with him after death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5719.">5719.</span></span>

They who despise and ridicule the Word in the letter, and still more who
do this to the things contained therein in the deeper sense, and
consequently to the doctrinal things that are from the Word, and who at
the same time are in no love toward the neighbor, but are in the love of
self, bear relation to the vitiated things of the blood, which find
their way into all the veins and arteries, and taint the whole mass.
Lest by their presence they should bring anything of the kind upon man,
they are kept separate from others in their own hell, and communicate
only with those who are of this nature; for these throw themselves into
the breath and sphere of that hell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5720.">5720.</span></span>

Hypocrites have been with me, those namely who have spoken in a holy
manner about Divine things, and with an affection of love about the
public and the neighbor, and have borne witness to what is just and
equitable, and yet in their heart have despised and even laughed at
these things. When they were permitted to flow into the parts of the
body to which they correspond by opposition, they inflicted pain on the
teeth, so severe on their nearest presence that I could not bear it; and
in proportion as they were removed, the pain ceased. This was shown
repeatedly, that no doubt might remain. Among them was one whom I had
known in the life of his body, and I therefore spoke to him; and at his
presence also there was pain in the teeth and gums. When he was raised
upward to the left, the pain attacked the left jaw, and invaded the bone
of the left temple down to the bones of the cheek.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5721.">5721.</span></span>

The most stubborn of all are they who during their life in the body had
appeared more just than others, and had also been established in
dignity, and on both accounts had authority and weight, and yet had
believed nothing, and had lived a mere life of the love of self, being
inflamed with inward hatred and revenge against all who did not favor
them, and pay them reverence, and still more against those who in any
way opposed them. If in these they detected any blemish they made an
enormous evil of it, and defamed them, even though they might be among
the best of citizens. \[2\] In the other life such persons speak as they
had done in this world, with authority and weight, and as if from
justice; wherefore many suppose that they are to be believed above
others. Yet they are most malicious. When they are applied to a man,
they induce great pain by weariness, which they continually inflate and
increase, even to the utmost impatience; which induces so great a
weakness in the mind and in consequence in the body that the man can
scarcely rise from his bed. This was shown me by such weakness seizing
me when they were present, and yet ceasing according to the degree in
which they were removed. \[3\] They make use of many an art in order to
infuse weariness and consequent weakness, especially by means of
disparagements and defamations among themselves and their associates,
whose common sphere they inject. When these persons reason within their
closets about Divine worship, faith, and eternal life, they utterly
reject them, and this they do as from a preeminent wisdom. In the other
life they are willing to be called devils, provided they are allowed to
rule over the hells, and thus from supreme power-as they believe-to act
against the Divine. Inwardly they are filthy, because pre-eminently in
the love of self, and thereby in hatred and revenge, and in cruelty
against all who do not pay court to them. \[4\] They are severely
punished, as I have also heard, until they desist from leading others
astray by an appearance of justice. When this appearance is taken away
from them, they speak in another tone. They are afterward cast out from
the world of spirits, and are then carried toward the left, and there
are cast down deep into hell. Their hell is toward the left at a mid
distance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5722.">5722.</span></span>

There are others who in the life of the body have been most filthy,
their filthiness being such as to be unmentionable. By their presence
and influx into the solid parts of the body they induce a weariness of
life, and such torpor in the members and limbs that the man cannot rise
from his bed. They are very stubborn, and do not desist through
penalties, as do other devils. They appear beside the head, and as if
lying there. When they are driven away, it is not done suddenly, but
gently, and they are then by degrees rolled down toward lower places;
and when they come into the deep, they are tormented there so severely
that they cannot but desist from infesting others. Such is their delight
in doing evil that nothing is more delightful to them.

There were spirits with me who induced so severe an oppression in the
stomach that I seemed to myself scarcely able to live. The oppression
was so great that with others it would have brought on a swoon. But they
were removed, and then it at once ceased. I was told that such spirits
are they who in the life of the body had been devoted to no pursuit, not
even at home, but solely to pleasure, and besides had lived in foul
idleness and sloth, and had not cared anything for others. Moreover they
had despised the faith. In short, they had been animals, not men. The
sphere of such produces numbness in the members and joints of the sick.

There are in the brain viscidities in which is mingled something
spirituous or vital, and these viscidities, expelled from the blood
there, fall first among the meninges, then among the fibers, part of
them into the great ventricles of the brain, and so on. The spirits who
relate by correspondence to those viscidities which have something
spirituous or some life in them, appear almost directly above the middle
of the head at a mid distance, and are such that from habit acquired in
the life of the body they stir scruples of conscience, and intrude in
matters of no conscience, and in this way burden the conscience of the
simple. Nor do they know what ought to engage the conscience, but make
everything that occurs a matter of conscience. Such spirits induce a
sensible anxiety in the part of the abdomen beneath the region of the
diaphragm. They are also present in temptations, and inject anxieties,
at times unbearable. Those of them who correspond to the viscous phlegm
of less vitality then keep the thought fixed in these anxieties.
Moreover, when I have been in discourse with them, in order to know
their quality, they tried in various ways to burden the conscience. This
had been the delight of their life; and it was given me to notice that
they cannot attend to reasons, and that they do not possess that more
universal view of things that would enable them to see the singular
ones.

It has been granted me to learn by experience what an inundation or
deluge is in the spiritual sense. Such an inundation is two-fold, one of
cupidities, and the other of falsities. That which is of cupidities
belongs to the will part, and is on the right side of the brain; but
that which is of falsities belongs to the intellectual part, in which is
the left side of the brain. When a man who has lived in good is remitted
into his own, thus into the sphere of his own life, there then appears
as it were an inundation; and when he is in this inundation he is
indignant, angry, thinks restlessly, desires impetuously. This takes
place in one way when the left side of the brain where there are
falsities is inundated, and in another when the right side where evils
are is inundated. But when the man is kept in the sphere of life which
he had received from the Lord by regeneration, he is then entirely out
of such an inundation, and is as it were in a serene and sunny, cheerful
and happy state, thus far from indignation, anger, unrest, cupidities,
and the like. This is the morning or springtime of spirits; the other is
their evening or autumn. It was given me to perceive that I was outside
this inundation, and this for quite a long time; while I saw that other
spirits were in it. Afterward, however, I myself was immersed, and then
I noticed the appearance of an inundation. In such an inundation are
they who are in temptations. By it too I was instructed what the "flood"
signifies in the Word-that the last posterity of the most ancient
people, who were of the Lord's celestial church, were completely
inundated with evils and falsities, and thus perished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5726.">5726.</span></span>

As death is from no other source than sin, and sin is all that which is
contrary to Divine order, therefore evil closes the very smallest and
most invisible vessels, of which are composed the next larger ones, also
invisible; for the vessels which are smallest of all and wholly
invisible are continued from man's interiors. Hence comes the first and
inmost obstruction, and hence the first and inmost vitiation into the
blood. When this vitiation increases, it causes disease, and finally
death. If, however, man had lived a life of good, his interiors would be
open into heaven, and through heaven to the Lord; and so too would the
very least and most invisible little vessels (the traces of the first
threads may be called little vessels, on account of the correspondence).
In consequence man would be without disease, and would merely decline to
extreme old age, even until he became again a little child, but a wise
one; and when the body could no longer minister to his internal man or
spirit, he would pass without disease out of his earthly body into a
body such as the angels have, thus out of the world directly into
heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5727.">5727.</span></span>

This is the end of the subject of correspondence. In the following
pages, at the close of the chapters, of the Lord's Divine mercy I will
speak of the spirits and angels with man; then of influx, and of the
interaction of the soul with the body; and afterward of the inhabitants
of other earths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5728.">5728.</span></span>

The Contents The subject treated of in this chapter in the internal
sense is the intermediate between the internal celestial man and the
external natural man; and first that the internal celestial man filled
the intermediate with spiritual truth from itself. The intermediate is
"Benjamin," the spiritual truth with it is "Joseph's silver cup," the
internal celestial man is "Joseph," and the external natural man is the
"ten sons of Jacob."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5729.">5729.</span></span>

The subject next treated of is the temptation of the external natural
man, which continues until there is willing submission to the internal
celestial. The temptation is described by their being accused, and by
their returning in despair to Joseph. The willing submission is
described by their all offering themselves for servants, and Judah's
offering himself in their stead. The conjunction of the external man
with the internal is not accomplished without temptation and willing
submission.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5730.">5730.</span></span>

In the representative historic sense the subject here treated of is
Jacob's descendants, that they were rejected, but that they obstinately
insisted on being representative. Their being rejected is meant by
Joseph's desiring to send them away, and to keep Benjamin only; their
obstinately insisting is involved in the particulars of their confession
and entreaty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5731.">5731.</span></span>

The Internal Sense Verses 1, 2. And he commanded him that was over his
house, saying, Fill the men's bags with food, as much as they can carry,
and put everyone's silver in his bag's mouth. And put my cup, the silver
cup, in the bag's mouth of the youngest, and his grain silver. And he
did according to the word of Joseph that he had spoken. "And he
commanded him that was over his house, saying," signifies influx from
himself; "Fill the men's bags with food," signifies into the natural
with the good of truth; "as much as they can carry," signifies to
sufficiency; "and put everyone's silver in his bag's mouth," signifies
together with truth anew in the exterior natural; "and put my cup, the
silver cup, in the bag's mouth of the youngest," signifies interior
truth bestowed on the intermediate; "and his grain silver," signifies
the truth of good; "and he did according to the word of Joseph that he
had spoken," signifies that it was so done.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5732.">5732.</span></span>

And he commanded him that was over his house, saying. That this
signifies influx from himself, is evident from the signification of
"commanding," as being influx (n. 5486); and from the signification of
"him that was over his house," as being which communicated. That it was
from himself, namely, from the internal celestial, which Joseph
represents, is plain. That "to command" is influx, is because in heaven
no one is commanded or ordered; but thought is communicated, and the
other acts willingly in accordance therewith. Communication of thought
together with a desire which wills that something be done, is influx,
and on the part of the recipient is perception, and therefore by
"commanding" is signified also perception (n. 3661, 3682). \[2\]
Moreover in heaven they not only think, but also talk together, but
about things of wisdom; yet in their conversation there is nothing of
command from one to another, for no one desires to be master and thereby
to look upon another as a servant; but everyone desires to minister to
and serve the others. From this it is plain what form of government
there is in the heavens, which is described by the Lord in Matthew: It
shall not be so among you; but whosoever would become great among you
should be your minister, and whosoever would be first should be your
servant (Matt. 20:26, 27); and again: He that is greatest among you
shall be your minister. Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled,
and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted (Matt. 23:11, 12).
He does this who loves his neighbor from the heart, or who feels delight
and blessedness in doing good to others for no selfish end; that is, who
has charity toward the neighbor.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5733.">5733.</span></span>

Fill the men's bags with food. That this signifies into the natural with
the good of truth, is evident from the signification of a "bag," as
being the exterior natural (see n. 5497); and from the signification of
"food," as being the good of truth (n. 5340, 5342, 5410, 5426, 5487,
5582, 5588, 5655). From this it is plain that by his "commanding him
that was over his house to fill the men's bags with food" is signified
influx from himself into the natural with the good of truth. As the
expressions "good of truth" and "truth of good" frequently occur, the
difference between them shall be stated. He who does not know what the
celestial church is relatively to the spiritual church, cannot possibly
know this difference. The truth of good is of the celestial church, and
the good of truth is of the spiritual church. With those who were of the
celestial church, good was implanted in the will part, which is the
proper seat of good, and from this good, that is, through this good from
the Lord, they had a perception of truth; hence they had the truth of
good. But with those who are of the spiritual church, good is implanted
in the intellectual part by means of truth, for all truth is of the
intellectual part, and through truth they are led to good, to do truth
being their good; hence they have the good of truth. The latter is
properly predicated of those who are of the spiritual church; yet the
truth of good, although not properly, is also predicated of them, of
which more will be said elsewhere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5734.">5734.</span></span>

As much as they can carry. That this signifies to sufficiency, may be
seen without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5735.">5735.</span></span>

And put everyone's silver in his bag's mouth. That this signifies
together with truth anew in the exterior natural, is evident from the
signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954, 5658); and
from the signification of the "bag's mouth," as being the threshold of
the exterior natural (see n. 5497). (What the exterior natural is, and
what the interior, may be seen above, n. 4570, 5118, 5126, 5497, 5649.)
That it is truth anew, is because silver was once before placed in their
bag's mouth (chap. 42:25, 27, 28, 35).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5736.">5736.</span></span>

And put my cup, the silver cup, in the bag's mouth of the youngest. That
this signifies interior truth bestowed on the intermediate, is evident
from the signification of a "silver cup," as being the truth of faith
that is from the good of charity (see n. 5120), and because it is called
"my cup," that is, Joseph's, it is interior truth (as Benjamin
represents the intermediate, also as to truth, he represents interior
truth, n. 5600, 5631, thus spiritual truth, n. 5639); from the
signification of the "bag's mouth," when predicated of Benjamin as the
intermediate, as being where it is adjoined to the natural; for an
intermediate to be an intermediate communicates with the external and
with the internal (n. 5411, 5413, 5586), its exterior here being the
natural; and from the representation of Benjamin, who is here the
"youngest," as being the intermediate (n. 5411, 5413, 5443, 5688). From
these things it is plain what is signified by Joseph's putting his
silver cup in Benjamin's bag.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5737.">5737.</span></span>

And his grain silver. That this signifies the truth of good, is evident
from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954,
5658); and from the signification of "grain," as being good (n. 5295,
5410); for the interior or spiritual truth which proceeds from the
internal celestial, which is "Joseph," is the truth of good. (What the
truth of good is, may be seen just above, n. 5733.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5738.">5738.</span></span>

And he did according to the word of Joseph that he had spoken. That this
signifies that it was so done, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5739.">5739.</span></span>

Verses 3-5. The morning grew light, and the men were sent away, they and
their asses. They were gone out of the city, not yet far off, and Joseph
said unto him that was over his house, Up, follow after the men; and
when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore do ye return evil
for good? Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and in which
divining he divineth? Ye have done evil in so doing. "The morning grew
light," signifies a state of enlightenment at that time; "and the men
were sent away, they and their asses," signifies that the external
natural man was removed somewhat with its truths and memory-knowledges;
"they were gone out of the city, not yet far off," signifies the amount
of removal; "and Joseph said unto him that was over his house,"
signifies perception and influx anew; "Up, follow after the men,"
signifies that it should now adjoin them to itself; "and when thou dost
overtake them," signifies mediate adjunction; "say unto them, Wherefore
do ye return evil for good?" signifies why is there a turning away; "is
not this it in which my lord drinketh?" signifies that there was
interior truth with them received from the celestial; "and in which
divining he divineth?" signifies that the celestial knows hidden things
from its Divine; "ye have done evil in so doing," signifies that it is
contrary to Divine law to claim it to themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5740.">5740.</span></span>

The morning grew light. That this signifies a state of enlightenment at
that time, is evident from the signification of "morning" and "growing
light," as being a state of enlightenment. "Morning" in the supreme
sense is the Lord (see n. 2405, 2780); and therefore when it is said
"the morning grew light," it signifies a state of enlightenment, for all
enlightenment is from the Lord. (That "rising in the morning" also means
a state of enlightenment may be seen above, n. 3458, 3723.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5741.">5741.</span></span>

And the men were sent away, they and their asses. That this signifies
that the external natural man was removed somewhat with its truths and
memory-knowledges, is evident from the representation of Jacob's sons,
who are here the "men," as being the truths of the church in the natural
(see n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512), and therefore the external
natural man (n. 5680); from the signification of "asses," as being
memory-knowledges (n. 5492); and from the signification of "sent away,
and not far off," as being that it-the external natural man-was removed
somewhat. From this it is plain that by "the men were sent away, they
and their asses, not far off," is signified the external natural man,
removed somewhat with its truths and memory-knowledges, namely, from the
internal celestial which is represented by Joseph. \[2\] As regards the
signification of "asses," be it known that they signified one thing when
they were used for riding, and another when they served for carrying
burdens; for judges, kings, and their sons rode upon he-asses,
she-asses, and also upon mules, and these then signified rational, and
also natural, truth and good (n. 2781); for which reason when the Lord
as Judge and King entered Jerusalem, He rode upon an ass with a colt;
for this was the mark of judgeship, and also of royalty. But when asses
served for carrying burdens, as here, then they signified
memory-knowledges. Nor is the case different with these knowledges. One
who in thinking of man's interior things advances no further than to the
knowledges that are of the memory, supposes that everything of man
consists in these knowledges, not being aware that memory-knowledges are
the lowest things in man, and such as for the most part are put away
when the body dies (n. 2475-2480); but the things that are in them,
namely truth and good together with their affections, remain; and also
with the evil there remain falsity and evil together with their
affections; memory-knowledges being as it were the body of these. So
long as a man lives in the world, he has truth and good, or falsity and
evil, in the memory-knowledges, for these are what contain them; and
because memory-knowledges contain, and therefore as it were carry,
interior things, they are signified by the asses which serve for
carrying burdens.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5742.">5742.</span></span>

They were gone out of the city, not yet far off. That this signifies the
amount of removal, may be seen from what has gone before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5743.">5743.</span></span>

And Joseph said unto him that was over his house. That this signifies
perception and influx anew, is evident from the signification of
"saying" in the historicals of the Word, as being to perceive (as often
before explained); and because it is perception in respect to him who
hears and receives, it is influx in respect to him who says; for they
mutually answer to each other. (That his "commanding him that was over
his house" denotes influx from himself, may be seen above, n. 5732.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5744.">5744.</span></span>

Up, follow after the men. That this signifies that it ought now to
adjoin them to itself, is evident from the signification of "following
after the men and overtaking them," as being to adjoin; for "to follow"
denotes a disposition to adjoin, and "to overtake" denotes adjunction.
In the rest of this chapter is described the return of Jacob's sons, and
in the following chapter the manifestation of Joseph, by which is
signified the conjunction of the celestial of the spiritual with truths
in the natural. Hence it is plain that by "follow after the men" is
signified that it ought now to adjoin them to itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5745.">5745.</span></span>

And when thou dost overtake them. That this signifies mediate
adjunction, is evident from the signification of their being overtaken
by him that was over Joseph's house, as being mediate adjunction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5746.">5746.</span></span>

Say unto them, Wherefore do ye return evil for good? That this signifies
why is there a turning away? is evident from the signification of
"returning evil for good," as being to turn away, for evil is nothing
else than a turning away from good; for they who are in evil spurn good,
that is, spiritual good, which is of charity and faith. That "evil" is a
turning away, is very evident from the evil in the other life; for they
appear in the light of heaven with the feet upward and the head downward
(see n. 3641), thus wholly inverted, and consequently turned away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5747.">5747.</span></span>

Is not this it in which my lord drinketh? That this signifies that the
interior truth with them was received from the celestial, is evident
from the signification of a "cup," which is meant by "this in which my
lord drinketh," as being interior truth (see n. 5736); and from the
representation of Joseph, who is here "my lord," as being the celestial
of the spiritual (n. 5307, 5331, 5332), here the celestial, because
interior truth is treated of, which is spiritual and proceeds from the
celestial. That it was received is signified by the cup being placed at
Joseph's command in the mouth of Benjamin's bag. \[2\] They are accused
as if they had taken the cup. The reason why they were so accused,
although the cup had been placed there, is plain from the internal
sense, which is this. The truth which is bestowed by the Lord is first
received as if it were not bestowed; for before regeneration the man
supposes that he procures truth for himself, and so long as he supposes
this he is in spiritual theft. To claim good and truth to oneself, and
to attribute them to oneself for righteousness and merit, is to take
away from the Lord that which is His (see n. 2609, 4174, 5135). It was
in order that this might be represented, that this thing was done by
Joseph; but still their being accused of theft was in order that
conjunction might be effected, for until man has been regenerated he
cannot but so believe. He does indeed say with his lips from doctrine
that all the truth of faith and good of charity are from the Lord, yet
he does not believe it until faith has been implanted in good, when for
the first time he acknowledges it from the heart. \[3\] Confession from
doctrine is quite another thing than confession from faith. Many, even
those who are not in good, can confess from doctrine, for doctrine to
them is merely knowledge; but none can confess from faith except those
who are in spiritual good, that is, in charity toward the neighbor. That
they were accused of theft in order to bring about conjunction, is plain
also from the fact that Joseph thereby brought them back to him, and
kept them awhile in thought about what they had done, and that he then
manifested, that is conjoined, himself to them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5748.">5748.</span></span>

And in which divining he divineth? That this signifies that the
celestial knows hidden things from its Divine, is evident from the
signification of "divining," as being to know hidden things. That it is
from the Divine, is because the celestial of the spiritual, which is
"Joseph," represents truth from the Divine, or truth in which is the
Divine (see n. 5703).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5749.">5749.</span></span>

Ye have done evil in so doing. That this signifies that it is contrary
to Divine law to claim it to themselves, is evident from the
signification of "theft," which is meant here by the "evil which they
did," as being to claim to oneself that which belongs to the Lord,
namely, the truth which is signified by Joseph's silver cup (see n.
5747). That this is contrary to the Divine law is manifest (n. 2609).
The reason why man ought not to claim to himself anything that is from
the Lord, thus not truth and good, is that he may be in the truth; and
insofar as he is in the truth, so far he is in the light in which angels
are in heaven; and insofar as he is in this light, so far he is in
intelligence and wisdom; and insofar as he is in intelligence and
wisdom, so far he is in happiness. This is the reason why man ought to
acknowledge from the faith of the heart that nothing of truth and good
is from himself, but all from the Lord, and this because it is so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5750.">5750.</span></span>

Verses 6-10. And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these words.
And they said unto him, Wherefore speaketh my lord according to these
words? Far be it from thy servants to do according to this word. Behold,
the silver which we found in our bag's mouth we brought back to thee out
of the land of Canaan; and how should we steal out of thy lord's house
silver or gold? With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him
die, and we also will be to my lord for servants. And he said, Now also
according to your words so be it; he with whom it is found shall be to
me a servant, and ye shall be blameless. "And he overtook them,"
signifies mediate adjunction; "and he spake unto them these words,"
signifies the influx of this thing; "and they said unto him," signifies
perception; "Wherefore speaketh my lord according to these words?"
signifies reflection why such a thing flows in; "far be it from thy
servants to do according to this word," signifies when it is not from
the will; "behold the silver which we found in our bags' mouth,"
signifies when truth was bestowed gratuitously; "we brought back to thee
out of the land of Canaan," signifies submitted from a principle of
religion; "and how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or
gold?" signifies why then shall we claim to ourselves truth and good,
which are from the Divine celestial; "with whomsoever of thy servants it
be found, let him die," signifies that he is damned who does so; "and we
also will be to my lord for servants," signifies that they will be
associates forever without freedom from their own; "and he said, Now
also according to your words," signifies that indeed it would be so from
justice; "so be it," signifies a milder sentence; "he with whom it is
found shall be to me a servant," signifies that he with whom it is shall
be forever without freedom of his own; "and ye shall be blameless,"
signifies that the rest shall be at their own disposal, because not
sharing in the fault.
