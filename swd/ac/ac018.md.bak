### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="851.">851.</span></span>

That "the ark rested" signifies regeneration, is evident from the fact
that the "ark" signifies the man of this church; and that all the things
which it contained signify all the things that were in him, as has been
fully shown before. When therefore the ark is said to "rest" it means
that this man was being regenerated. The connection of the literal sense
may indeed seem to imply that by the ark's "resting" is signified the
cessation of the fluctuations that follow temptation (spoken of in the
preceding verse); but fluctuations, which are doubts and obscurities
concerning what is true and good, do not so cease, but persist for a
long time, as will be evident from what follows. Hence it is evident
that the continuity of things is different in the internal sense; and as
they are arcana, it is permitted here to unfold them; and they are that
the spiritual man, like the celestial, after enduring temptations,
becomes in like manner the "rest" of the Lord; and further, that he in
like manner becomes the seventh (not the seventh day, like the celestial
man, but the seventh) month. (Concerning the celestial man as being the
rest of the Lord, or the Sabbath, and the seventh day, see above, n.
84-88.) As however there is a difference between the celestial man and
the spiritual man, the "rest" of the former is expressed in the original
language by a word which means the Sabbath, while the "rest" of the
latter is expressed by another term, from which he is named "Noah" which
properly means "rest."

<span class="margnote"><span id="852.">852.</span></span>

That the "seventh month" signifies what is holy, is abundantly evident
from what has been shown before (n. 84-87, 395, 716). This holiness
corresponds to what was said with reference to the celestial man (Gen.
2:3): that the seventh day was sanctified, because God rested therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="853.">853.</span></span>

That the "seventeenth day" signifies what is new, is evident from what
has been said and shown concerning the same number in the preceding
chapter (Gen. 7:11; n. 755), where it signifies a beginning; and every
beginning is new.

<span class="margnote"><span id="854.">854.</span></span>

That the "mountains of Ararat" signify light \[lumen\] is evident from
the signification of a "mountain" as being the good of love and charity
(n. 795); and from the signification of "Ararat" as being light, and
indeed the light of the regenerate. New light, or the first light of the
regenerate, never derives its existence from the knowledges of the
truths of faith, but from charity. The truths of faith are like rays of
light; love or charity is like flame; and the light of him who is being
regenerated is not from the truths of faith, but from charity, the
truths of faith themselves being rays of light therefrom. Thus it is
evident that the "mountains of Ararat" signify such light. This is the
first light perceived after temptation, and being the first, it is
obscure, and is called lumen, not lux.

<span class="margnote"><span id="855.">855.</span></span>

From these things it is now evident what this verse in the internal
sense signifies, namely, that the spiritual man is a holy "rest" by
virtue of a new intellectual light that is derived from charity. These
truths are perceived by angels in a variety so wonderful, and in an
order so delightful, that could man but obtain a single such idea, there
would be thousands and thousands of things in a manifold series that
would enter and affect him, and in fact such things as could not
possibly be described. Such is the Word of the Lord in its internal
sense throughout, even when it appears in the letter to be crude
history, as when it is here said that "the ark rested in the seventh
month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of
Ararat."

<span class="margnote"><span id="856.">856.</span></span>

Verse 5. And the waters were going and failing until the tenth month; in
the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the
mountains appeared. "And the waters were going and failing" signifies
that falsities began to disappear; "in the tenth month" signifies the
truths which are of remains; "on the first day of the month the tops of
the mountains appeared" signifies the truths of faith, which then began
to be seen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="857.">857.</span></span>

And the waters were going and failing. That this signifies that
falsities began to disappear, is evident from the words themselves, as
well as from what was shown above (verse 3), where it is said that "the
waters receded, going and returning." Here however it is said that "the
waters were going and failing" and by this, as by the former phrase, are
signified fluctuations between what is true and what is false, but here
that these fluctuations were decreasing. The case with fluctuations
after temptation (as before said) is that the man does not know what
truth is, but that as by degrees the fluctuations cease, so the light of
truth appears. The reason of this is that so long as the man is in such
a state, the internal man, that is, the Lord through the internal man,
cannot operate upon the external. In the internal man are remains, which
are affections of what is good and true, as before described; in the
external are cupidities and their derivative falsities; and so long as
these latter are not subdued and extinguished, the way is not open for
goods and truths from the internal, that is, through the internal from
the Lord. \[2\] Temptations, therefore, have for their end that the
externals of man may be subdued and thus be rendered obedient to his
internals, as may be evident to everyone from the fact that as soon as
man's loves are assaulted and broken (as during misfortunes, sickness,
and grief of mind), his cupidities begin to subside, and he at the same
time begins to talk piously; but as soon as he returns to his former
state, the external man prevails and he scarcely thinks of such things.
The like happens at the hour of death, when corporeal things begin to be
extinguished; and hence everyone may see what the internal man is, and
what the external; and also what remains are, and how cupidities and
pleasures, which are of the external man, hinder the Lord's operation
through the internal man. From this it is also plain to everyone what
temptations, or the internal pains called the stings of conscience,
effect, namely, that the external man is made obedient to the internal.
The obedience of the external man is nothing else than this: that the
affections of what is good and true are not hindered, resisted, and
suffocated by cupidities and their derivative falsities. The ceasing of
the cupidities and falsities is here described by "the waters which were
going and failing."

<span class="margnote"><span id="858.">858.</span></span>

That the "tenth month" signifies the truths which are of remains, is
evident from the signification of "ten" as being remains (n. 576); and
from what was said above concerning the remains in the internal man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="859.">859.</span></span>

That "on the first day of the month the tops of the mountains appeared"
signifies the truths of faith which then begin to be seen, is evident
from the signification of "mountains" (n. 795), as being the goods of
love and of charity. Their tops begin to be seen when man is being
regenerated, and is being gifted with conscience, and thereby with
charity; and he who supposes that he sees the tops of the mountains, or
the truths of faith, from any other ground than from the goods of love
and of charity, is quite mistaken; since without these, Jews and profane
Gentiles may see them in the same way. The "tops of the mountains" are
the first dawnings of light which appear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="860.">860.</span></span>

From these things it is also evident that all regeneration proceeds from
evening to morning, as is stated six times over in the first chapter of
Genesis, where the regeneration of man is treated of, and where evening
is described in verses 2 and 3; and morning in verses 4 and 5. In the
present verse the first dawning of light, or the morning of this state,
is described by "the tops of the mountains appearing."

<span class="margnote"><span id="861.">861.</span></span>

Verse 6. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened
the window of the ark which he had made. "And it came to pass at the end
of forty days" signifies the duration of the former state, and the
beginning of the following one; "that Noah opened the window of the ark
which he had made" signifies a second state, when the truths of faith
appeared to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="862.">862.</span></span>

And it came to pass at the end of forty days. That this signifies the
duration of the former state, and the beginning of the following one, is
evident from the signification of "forty" which was explained at n. 730;
where, the subject being temptation, it is said "forty days and forty
nights" signifying the duration of the temptation. But because the
subject here is the state following temptation, it is said "forty days"
but not forty nights. The reason is, that charity, which in the Word is
compared to "day" and called "day" now begins to appear; and faith which
precedes being not yet so conjoined with charity, is compared to "night"
and called "night" (as in Gen. 1:16; and in other parts of the Word). In
the Word faith is also called "night" from its receiving its light from
charity, as the moon does from the sun; and hence faith is compared to
the "moon" and called the "moon" and love or charity is compared to the
"sun" and called the "sun." "Forty days" (or the duration which they
signify) have respect both to what precedes and to what follows,
wherefore it is said, "at the end of forty days;" thus they signify the
duration of the former state and the beginning of that now treated of.
Here then commences the description of the second state of the man of
this church after temptation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="863.">863.</span></span>

That Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. That this
signifies a second state when the truths of faith appeared to him, is
evident from the last words of the preceding verse: "the tops of the
mountains appeared;" and from their signification, as also from the
signification of a "window" (see n. 655) as being the understanding, or,
what is the same, the truth of faith; and likewise from this being the
first dawning of light. Concerning the understanding, or the truth of
faith, signified by a "window" it may be observed here as above, that no
truth of faith is possible except from the good of love or of charity,
as there can be no true understanding except from what is of the will.
If you remove what is of the will, there is no understanding, as has
been often shown before; and so if you remove charity, there is no
faith; but as the will of man is mere cupidity, in order to prevent the
immersion of what is of his understanding, or the truth of faith, in his
cupidity, the Lord has wonderfully provided that what is of the
understanding should be separated from what is of the will of man, by a
certain medium, which is conscience, and in which He may implant
charity. Without this wonderful providence no one could ever have been
saved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="864.">864.</span></span>

Verse 7. And he sent forth a raven, and it went forth, going and
returning, until the waters were dried up from off the earth. "And he
sent forth a raven, and it went forth, going and returning" signifies
that falsities still made disturbance; by a "raven" are signified
falsities; and by "going forth, going and returning" is signified that
such was their state; "until the waters were dried up from off the
earth" signifies the apparent dissipation of falsities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="865.">865.</span></span>

And he sent forth a raven, and it went forth, going and returning. That
by this is signified that falsities still made disturbance, is evident
from the signification of a raven and of "going forth, going and
returning" concerning which more will be said hereafter. In this passage
is described the second state of the man who is to be regenerated, after
temptation, when the truths of faith, like the first dawning of light,
begin to appear. Such is the nature of this state that falsities are
continually making disturbance, so that it resembles the morning
twilight, while somewhat of the obscurity of night still remains, as is
here signified by a "raven." Falsities with the spiritual man,
especially before his regeneration, are like the dense spots of a cloud.
The reason is that he can know nothing of the truth of faith except from
what is revealed in the Word, where all things are stated in a general
way; and generals are but as the spots of a cloud, for every general
comprehends in it thousands and thousands of particulars, and each
particular thousands and thousands of singulars, all generals being
illustrated by the singulars of the particulars. These have never been
so revealed to man, because they are both indescribable and
inconceivable, and so can neither be acknowledged nor believed in; for
they are contrary to the fallacies of the senses in which man is, and
which he does not easily permit to be destroyed. \[2\] It is altogether
otherwise with the celestial man, who possesses perception from the
Lord; for in him particulars and singulars of particulars can be
insinuated. For example: that true marriage is that of one man with one
wife; and that such marriage is representative of the heavenly marriage,
and therefore heavenly happiness can be in it, but never in a marriage
of one man with a plurality of wives. The spiritual man, who knows this
from the Word of the Lord, acquiesces in it, and hence admits as a
matter of conscience that marriage with more wives than one is a sin;
but he knows no more. The celestial man however perceives thousands of
things which confirm this general, so that marriage with more wives than
one excites his abhorrence. As the spiritual man knows generals only,
and has his conscience formed from these, and as the generals of the
Word have been accommodated to the fallacies of the senses, it is
evident that innumerable falsities, which cannot be dispersed, will
adjoin and insinuate themselves into them. These falsities are here
signified by "the raven which went forth, going and returning."

<span class="margnote"><span id="866.">866.</span></span>

That a "raven" signifies falsities, is evident in a general way from
what has been said and shown above concerning birds, that they signify
things of understanding, of reason, and of memory-knowledge, and also
the opposite, which are reasonings and falsities. Both of these are
described in the Word by various species of birds; truths of
understanding by birds which are gentle, beautiful, and clean; and
falsities by those which are ravenous, ugly, and unclean, in each case
varying according to the species of truth or falsity. Gross and dense
falsities are described by owls and ravens; by owls because they live in
the darkness of night, and by ravens, because they are of a black color.
As in Isaiah: The owl also and the raven shall dwell therein (Isa.
34:11), where the Jewish Church is described as being the habitation of
mere falsities, represented by the owl and the raven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="867.">867.</span></span>

That "going and returning" signifies that such was their state, is
evident from the falsities with man while in his first and second state
after temptation, namely, that the falsities thus fly about, going and
returning, for the reason mentioned above, that man at that time is and
can be only in the knowledge of the most general things, into which flow
phantasies arising from corporeal, sensuous, and worldly things, which
do not agree with the truths of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="868.">868.</span></span>

Until the waters were dried up from off the earth. That this signifies
the apparent dissipation of falsities, is evident from the state of man
when he is being regenerated. Everyone believes at the present day that
the evils and falsities in man are entirely separated and abolished
during regeneration, so that when he becomes regenerate, nothing of evil
or falsity remains, but he is clean and righteous, like one washed and
purified with water. This notion is, however, utterly false; for not a
single evil or falsity can be so shaken off as to be abolished; but
whatever has been hereditarily derived from infancy, and acquired by act
and deed, remains; so that man, notwithstanding his being regenerate, is
nothing but evil and falsity, as is shown to the life to souls after
death. The truth of this may be sufficiently manifest from the
consideration, that there is nothing of good and nothing of truth in man
except from the Lord, and that all evil and falsity are man's from his
Own; and that man, and spirit, and even angel, if left in the least to
himself, would rush of himself into hell; wherefore also it is said in
the Word that heaven is not pure. This is acknowledged by angels, and he
who does not acknowledge it cannot be among angels. It is the Lord's
mercy alone that liberates them, and even draws them out of hell and
keeps them from rushing thither of themselves. That they are kept by the
Lord from rushing into hell, is manifestly perceived by the angels, and
even in a measure by good spirits. Evil spirits, however, like men, do
not believe this; but it has often been shown them, as of the Lord's
Divine mercy will be told from experience hereafter. \[2\] Since
therefore the state of man is such that no evil and falsity can ever be
so shaken off as to be abolished, because the life that is proper to him
consists in evil and falsity, the Lord, from Divine mercy, while He
regenerates man, through temptations so subdues his evils and falsities
that they appear as if dead, though they are not dead, but are only
subdued so that they cannot fight against the goods and truths which are
from the Lord. At the same time also the Lord through temptations gives
man a new faculty of receiving goods and truths, by gifting him with
ideas and affections of good and of truth, to which evils and falsities
can be bent, and by inserting in his generals (of which above)
particulars, and in these singulars, which are stored up in man and
which he knows nothing about, for they are interior to the sphere of his
apprehension and perception. These are of a nature to serve for
receptacles or vessels, so that charity can be insinuated into them by
the Lord, and into charity innocence. By their wonderful tempering with
man, spirit, and angel, a kind of rainbow may be represented, and for
this reason the rainbow was made the sign of the covenant (Gen.
9:12-17), concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy we shall speak
under that chapter. When man has been thus formed, he is said to be
regenerate, all his evils and falsities still remaining, yet at the same
time all his goods and truths being preserved. With an evil man all his
evils and falsities, just as he had them in the life of the body, return
in the other life and are turned into infernal phantasies and
punishments. But with a good man, all his states of good and truth, such
as those of friendship, of charity, and of innocence, are recalled in
the other life, and together with their delights and happinesses, are
there immensely augmented and multiplied. These things then are what is
signified by the drying of the waters, which is the apparent dissipation
of falsities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="869.">869.</span></span>

Verse 8. And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
abated from off the faces of the ground. By "a dove" are signified the
truths and goods of faith with him who is to be regenerated; "and he
sent forth a dove from him to see" signifies the state of receiving the
truths and goods of faith; "if the waters were abated" signifies
falsities which impede; "the faces of the ground" signifies the things
which are in the man of the church; it is said "ground" because this is
the first state when man becomes a church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="870.">870.</span></span>

That by a "dove" are signified the truths and goods of faith with him
who is to be regenerated, is evident from the signification of a "dove"
in the Word, especially the dove which came upon Jesus when He was
baptized, of which we read in Matthew: Jesus when He was baptized, went
up straightway out of the water, and lo the heavens were opened, and He
saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and coming upon Him (Matt.
3:16; also John 1:32; Luke 3:21-22; Mark 1:10-11). Here the "dove"
signified nothing else than the holy of faith; and the "baptism" itself,
regeneration; so that there was signified, in the new church which was
to arise, the truth and good of faith which is received by regeneration
from the Lord. Similar things were represented and involved by the young
pigeons or turtledoves that were offered for sacrifice and burnt
offering in the Jewish Church, of which we read in Leviticus (Lev.
1:14-17; 5:7-10, 12:6, 8, 14:21, 22, 15:14, 29, 30; Num. 6:10, 11; Luke
2:22-24), as is evident from the several passages. That they had such a
signification everyone may comprehend from the sole consideration that
they must needs represent something; for otherwise they would have no
meaning and would be in no respect Divine, for what is external of the
church is an inanimate affair, but lives from what is internal, and this
from the Lord. \[2\] That a "dove" in general signifies the intellectual
things of faith, is also evident in the Prophets, as in Hosea: Ephraim
will be like a silly dove, without heart; they called Egypt, they went
unto Assyria (Hos. 7:11). And again, concerning Ephraim: They shall be
afraid, as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria
(Hos. 11:11). Here "Ephraim" denotes one who is intelligent, "Egypt" one
who has knowledge, "Assyria" one who is rational, a "dove" what is of
the intellectual things of faith; and here also the subject is the
regeneration of the spiritual church. Again in David: O Jehovah, deliver
not the soul of Thy turtledove unto the wild beast (Ps. 74:19);where
"wild beast" denotes those who are of no charity; the "soul of the
"turtle dove" the life of faith. See also what has been said and shown
before about birds, that they signify intellectual things: gentle,
beautiful, clean, and useful birds, intellectual truths and goods; but
fierce, ugly, unclean, and useless birds, the opposite, or falsities,
such as the raven, which is here opposed to the dove.

<span class="margnote"><span id="871.">871.</span></span>

And he sent forth a dove from him to see. That this signifies a state of
receiving the truths and goods of faith, is evident from the connection
of the things, as also from what follows, where the three states of the
regeneration of this man after temptations are treated of, which are
signified by his sending forth the dove three times. Here the words
proximately involve his exploration; for it is said that he "sent forth
the dove from him to see" namely, whether the waters were abated; that
is, whether the falsities were still so abundant that goods and truths
could not be received. But with the Lord there is no exploration,
because He knows all things both in general and in particular. In the
internal sense therefore, the words signify, not exploration, but state,
and here the first state, when falsities were still hindering, which is
signified by the words, "whether the waters were abated."

<span class="margnote"><span id="872.">872.</span></span>

That the "faces of the ground" mean those things which are in the man of
the church, and that the "ground" is mentioned because this is the first
state when the man is becoming a church, is evident from the
signification of "ground" (shown above), as being the man of the church,
who is called "ground" when the goods and truths of faith can be sown in
him, but before this he is called "earth." So in the first chapter of
Genesis, before the man became celestial, "earth" is predicated of him;
but when he became celestial, as described in the second chapter,
"ground" and "field" are predicated of him. It is similar in the present
chapter. Merely from the word "earth" and the word "ground" may be seen
what is signified in the internal sense, not only here, but everywhere
in the Word. By "ground" in the universal sense is signified the church;
and because the church, the man of the church is also signified; for, as
said before, each man of the church is a church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="873.">873.</span></span>

Verse 9. And the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
returned unto him to the ark, for the waters were on the faces of the
whole earth; and he put forth his hand and took her, and brought her in
unto him into the ark. "And the dove found no rest for the sole of her
foot" signifies that nothing of the good and truth of faith could yet
take root; "and she returned unto him to the ark" signifies good and
truth appearing with him as though they were of faith; "for the waters
were on the faces of the whole earth" signifies that falsities were
still overflowing; "and he put forth his hand" signifies his own power;
"and took her and brought her in unto him into the ark" signifies that
he did what was good and thought what was true from himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="874.">874.</span></span>

Here is described the first state of the regeneration of the man of this
church after temptation, which state is common to all who are being
regenerated, namely, that they suppose they do what is good and think
what is true from themselves; and because they are as yet in great
obscurity, the Lord also leaves them so to imagine. But still all the
good they do and all the truth they think while in such imagination, is
not the good and truth of faith. For whatever man produces of himself
cannot be good, because it is from himself, that is, from a fountain
which is impure and most unclean. From this impure and unclean fountain
no good can ever go forth, for the man is always thinking of his own
merit and righteousness; and some go so far as to despise others in
comparison with themselves (as the Lord teaches in Luke 18:9-14), and
others err in other ways. Man's own cupidities intermingle themselves,
so that while it appears outwardly to be good, it is inwardly filthy.
For this reason the good which man does in this state is not the good of
faith, and the case is the same with the truth that he thinks, for
although that which he thinks may be very true, yet so long as it is
from what is his own it is indeed in itself the truth of faith, but the
good of faith is not in it; and all truth, in order to be the truth of
faith, must have in it from the Lord the good of faith. Then for the
first time there are good and truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="875.">875.</span></span>

But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot. That this signifies
that nothing of the good and truth of faith could yet take root, is
evident from the signification of a "dove" as being the truth of faith,
and from the signification of "rest for the sole of the foot" as being
to take root. The reason that it could not take root is told in what
follows, namely, that falsities were still overflowing. But how this is
cannot be understood unless it be known how the regeneration of the
spiritual man is effected. \[2\] With this man the knowledges of faith
are to be implanted in his memory from the Word of the Lord, or from
doctrinal things therefrom (which the Ancient Church had from what was
revealed to the Most Ancient Church), and thereby his intellectual mind
is to be instructed. But as long as falsities overflow therein, the
truths of faith, howsoever sown, cannot take root. They remain on the
surface only, that is, in the memory; nor does the ground become fit for
them until the falsities have been shaken off so as not to appear, as
before said. \[3\] The real "ground" with this man is prepared in his
intellectual mind, and when it has been prepared the good of charity is
insinuated by the Lord, and from this, conscience, from which he
afterwards acts, that is, through which the Lord works the good and
truth of faith. Thus the Lord makes the intellectual things of this man
distinct from those of his will so that they are never united; for if
they should be united, he could not but perish eternally. \[4\] With the
man of the Most Ancient Church the things of the will were united to
those of the understanding, as they also are with the celestial angels.
But with the man of this Ancient Church they were not united, nor are
they with any spiritual man. It appears indeed as if the good of charity
which he does were of his will, but this is only an appearance and
fallacy. All the good of charity that he does is of the Lord alone, not
through the will, but through conscience. If the Lord should let go ever
so little and suffer the man to act from his own will, instead of good
he would do evil from hatred, revenge, and cruelty. \[5\] The case is
the same with the truth that the spiritual man thinks and speaks: unless
he were to think and speak from conscience, and thus from the good that
is of the Lord, he could never think and speak truth otherwise than as
do the devils of hell when they feign themselves angels of light. All
this is clearly manifest in the other life. From these things it is
evident in what manner regeneration is effected, and what the
regeneration of the spiritual man is: that in fact it is the separation
of his intellectual part from the will part, by means of conscience,
which is formed by the Lord in his intellectual part; and whatever is
done from this appears as if done by the man's will, but is really done
by the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="876.">876.</span></span>

And she returned unto him to the ark. That this signifies good and truth
appearing as though they were of faith, is evident from what has been
said, and also from what follows. In the internal sense, to "return to
the ark" does not signify liberation, for this is signified by being
sent forth from the ark and not returning, as is evident from what
follows, in the twelfth verse, that he sent forth the dove and she
returned not again to him anymore; and further from the fifteenth and
sixteenth verses, that Noah was commanded to go forth from the ark; and
from the eighteenth, that he went forth. The "ark" signifies the state
of the man of this church before regeneration, in which he was in
captivity, or in prison, beset on all sides by evils and falsities, or
by the waters of the flood. And so the dove's returning unto Noah to the
ark, signifies that the good and truth meant by the dove returned again
to the man. For whatever good a man supposes that he does from himself,
returns to him, since it regards himself; as he does it either that it
may appear before the world, or before the angels, or that he may merit
heaven, or that he may be greatest in heaven. Such things are in man's
Own and in everyone of its ideas, though in outward form there is an
appearance as of the good and truth of faith. The good and truth of
faith is inwardly good and true from the very inmosts; that is, all the
good and truth of faith flows in from the Lord through man's inmosts.
But when what a man does is from his Own, or from merit, then the
interiors are filthy and the exteriors appear clean; just as with a
filthy harlot who appears fair in the face; or like an Ethiopian, or
rather an Egyptian mummy, wrapped in a white garment.

For the waters were on the faces of the whole earth. That this signifies
that falsities were still overflowing, is evident from the signification
of the "waters" of the flood, as being falsities (which has been
sufficiently shown before), and also from the very words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="878.">878.</span></span>

And he put forth his hand and took her, and brought her in unto him into
the ark. That this signifies his own power, and that he did what was
good and thought what was true from himself, is evident from the
signification of "hand" as being power, and thus here his own power from
which he did these things. For to "put forth his hand and take the dove
and bring her in to himself" is to apply and attribute to himself the
truth meant by the "dove." That by "hand" is signified power, also
authority \[potestas\], and the derivative self-confidence, is evident
from many passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: I will visit upon the
fruit of the greatness of heart of the king of Assyria, because he hath
said, By the strength of my hand I have done it and by my wisdom, for I
am intelligent (Isa. 10:12-13),where "hand" manifestly denotes his own
strength to which he attributed what he did, and this was the cause of
the visitation upon him. Again: Moab shall spread forth his hands in the
midst of him, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim, and
he shall lay low his pride together with the cataracts of his hands
(Isa. 25:11); where "hands" denote man's own power, from regarding
himself as above others, thus from pride. \[2\] Again: Their inhabitants
were short of hand, they were dismayed and put to shame (Isa. 37:27);
"short of hand" meaning of no power. Again: Shall the clay say to the
potter, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? (Isa. 45:9).
Here "he hath no hands" means that he has no power. In Ezekiel: The king
shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with stupefaction, and the
hands of the people of the land shall be troubled (Ezek. 7:27), where
"hands" denote power. In Micah: Woe to them that devise iniquity, and
work evil upon their beds; when the morning is light they practice it,
because their hand is their god (Micah 2:1), where "hand" denotes their
own power in which they trust as their god. In Zechariah: Woe to the
worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock; the sword shall be upon his
arm, and upon his right eye; his arm shall be clean dried up, and his
right eye shall be utterly darkened (Zech. 11:17). \[3\] Because "hands"
signify powers, man's evils and falsities are continually called in the
Word "the works of his hands." Evils are from the Own of man's will,
falsities are from the Own of his understanding. That this is the source
of evils and falsities is evident enough from the nature of man's Own,
which is nothing but evil and falsity (as may be seen above, n. 39, 41,
141, 150, 154, 210, 215). As "hands" in general signify power, "hands"
are many times in the Word attributed to Jehovah, or the Lord, and then
by "hands" is understood in the internal sense Omnipotence, as in
Isaiah: Jehovah, Thy hand is lifted up (Isa. 26:11), denoting the Divine
power. Again: Jehovah stretched out His hand, all are consumed (Isa.
31:3), Concerning the work of My hands command ye Me My hands have
stretched out the heavens and all their army have I commanded (Isa.
45:11, 12), denoting the Divine power. The regenerate are often called
in the Word "the work of the hands of Jehovah." In the same Mine hand
hath laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand hath measured
the heavens with the palm (Isa. 48:13), where "hand" and "right hand"
denote omnipotence. \[4\] Again: Is My hand shortened at all that it
cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver ? (Isa. 1:2), denoting the
Divine power. In Jeremiah: Thou hast made the heaven and the earth by
Thy great power and by Thy stretched out arm; and didst bring forth Thy
people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and
with a strong hand, and with a stretched-out arm (Jer. 32:17, 21),
denoting the Divine power; "power" being named in the seventeenth verse,
and "hand" in the twenty-first. That Israel was brought out of Egypt
with "a strong hand and with a "stretched-out arm" is often said. In
Ezekiel: Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, In the day when I chose Israel,
and lifted up Mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made My
self known unto them in the land of Egypt; I lifted up Mine hand unto
them, to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt (Ezek. 20:5-6, 23).
In Moses: Israel saw the great hand which Jehovah executed upon the
Egyptians (Exod. 14:31). \[5\] That by "hand" is signified power is now
plainly manifest from these passages. Indeed "hand" was so significant
of power that it became also its representative, as is evident from the
miracles that were done in Egypt, when Moses was commanded to stretch
forth his rod, or hand, and so they were done; as in Exodus: Moses
stretched forth his rod toward heaven, and Jehovah rained hail upon the
land of Egypt (Exod. 9:22, 23); Moses stretched forth his hand toward
heaven, and there was a thick darkness (Exod. 10:21, 22); Moses
stretched out his hand over the sea, and Jehovah made the sea dry land;
and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned
(Exod. 14:21, 27). No one with mental capacity for right thinking can
believe that there was any such power in the hand or rod of Moses, but
because the lifting up and stretching forth of the hand signified the
Divine power, it became a representative in the Jewish Church. \[6\] It
was similar when Joshua stretched out his javelin, as in Joshua: And
Jehovah said unto Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in thy hand
toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand; and Joshua stretched out
the javelin that was in his hand toward the city, and they entered into
the city and took it for Joshua drew not back his hand, wherewith he
stretched out the javelin, until he had devoted all the inhabitants of
Ai (Josh. 8:18, 26).From this it is also evident how the case is with
the representatives that were the externals of the Jewish Church; and
also how it is with the Word: that the things in its external sense do
not appear to be representative of the Lord and His kingdom, as here the
stretching forth of the hand, and likewise all the other things, which
bear no appearance of being representative while the mind is fixed only
on the historic details of the letter. It is evident also how far the
Jews had fallen away from a true understanding of the Word and of the
rites of the church, while making all worship consist in externals only,
even to the extent of attributing power to the rod of Moses and the
javelin of Joshua, when yet there was no more power in them than in
wood. But because the omnipotence of the Lord was signified, and this
was understood in heaven when they stretched forth their hand or rod,
the signs and miracles followed. \[7\] So too it was when Moses on the
top of the hill held up his hands, and Joshua prevailed; and when he let
down his hands, and Joshua was overcome; and therefore they stayed up
his hands (Exod. 17:9-13). Thus it was that hands were laid upon those
who were being consecrated, as on the Levites by the people (Num. 8:9,
10, 12), and on Joshua by Moses, when he was substituted in his place
(Num. 27:18, 23), in order that power might so be given. Hence also come
the rites still observed of inauguration and benediction by the laying
on of hands. To what extent the hand signified and represented power, is
evident from what is said in the Word concerning Uzzah and Jeroboam.
Concerning Uzzah it is said that he put forth (his hand) to the ark of
God, and took hold of it, and therefore he died (2 Sam. 6:6, 7). The
"ark" represented the Lord, thus all that is holy and celestial. Uzzah's
putting forth (his hand) to the ark, represented man's own power, or
what is his own; and as this is profane, the word "hand" is understood,
but is not expressed in the original, lest it should be perceived by the
angels that such a profane thing had touched what is holy. \[8\] And
because Uzzah put it forth, he died. Concerning Jeroboam it is said: And
it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which
he cried against the altar, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the
altar, saying, Lay hold on him; and his hand which he put forth against
him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him; and he
said unto the man of God, Intreat now the faces of Jehovah thy God, and
pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again; and the man of God
intreated the faces of Jehovah, and the king's hand was restored him
again, and became as it was before (1 Kings 13:4-6). Here in like manner
by "putting forth the hand" is signified man's own power, or his Own,
which is profane, and that it wished to violate what is holy by putting
forth the hand against the man of God; wherefore the hand was dried up;
but as Jeroboam was an idolater and therefore could not commit
profanation, his hand was restored. That the "hand" signifies and
represents power, is evident from the representatives in the world of
spirits, where a naked arm sometimes comes into view, in which there is
strength enough to crush one's bones and squeeze their inmost marrow to
nothing, causing such terror as to melt the heart; and in fact this
strength is actually in it.

Verses 10, 11. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent
forth the dove out of the ark; and the dove came back to him at
eventide; and lo in her mouth an olive leaf plucked off; so Noah knew
that the waters were abated from off the earth. "And he stayed yet other
seven days" signifies the beginning of the second state of regeneration;
"seven days" signify what is holy, because now charity is treated of;
"and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark" signifies a state of
receiving the goods and truths of faith; "and the dove came back to him
at eventide" signifies that little by little they began to appear;
"eventide" means as in the twilight before morning; "and lo in her mouth
an olive leaf plucked off" signifies some little of the truth of faith;
"a leaf" is truth; "olive" the good of charity; "plucked off" means that
the truth of faith is therefrom; "in her mouth" means that it was shown;
"so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth" signifies
that these things were so because the falsities that impeded were less
abundant than before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="880.">880.</span></span>

And he stayed yet other seven days. That this signifies the beginning of
a second state of regeneration, may be evident from the fact that the
time is thus described which intervenes between the first state
(described in the eighth and ninth verses) and this second state
(described here in the tenth and eleventh verses). In order to maintain
the historic connection, this intervening time is expressed by his
"staying." How the case is with the second state of regeneration may be
seen in some degree from what has been said and shown about the first
state, which was that the truths of faith could not yet take root,
because falsities hindered. The truths of faith are first rooted when
man begins to acknowledge and believe, and they are not rooted before.
What man hears from the Word and holds in memory, is only the sowing;
the rooting does by no means begin until the man accepts and receives
the good of charity. All the truth of faith is rooted by the good of
faith, that is, by the good of charity. This is as with seed that is
cast into the ground while it is still winter and the ground is cold;
there indeed it lies, but does not take root. But as soon as the heat of
the sun warms the earth in the time of early spring, the seed begins
first to push its root within itself, and afterwards to send it forth
into the ground. The case is the same with spiritual seed that is being
implanted: this is never rooted until the good of charity as it were
warms it; then for the first time it pushes its root within itself, and
afterwards sends it forth. \[2\] There are three things in man which
concur and unite together, namely, the Natural, the Spiritual, and the
Celestial. His natural never receives any life except from the
spiritual, and the spiritual never except from the celestial, and the
celestial from the Lord alone, who is life itself. But in order that a
still fuller idea may be gained: the natural is the receptacle that
receives the spiritual, or is the vessel into which the spiritual is
poured; and the spiritual is the receptacle which receives, or is the
vessel into which is poured, the celestial. Thus, through things
celestial, life comes from the Lord. Such is the influx. The celestial
is all the good of faith; in the spiritual man it is the good of
charity. The spiritual is truth, which never becomes the truth of faith
unless there is in it the good of faith, that is, the good of charity,
in which there is life itself from the Lord. That a yet clearer idea may
be gained: man's natural is what does the Work of Charity, by hand or by
mouth, and thus by the organs of the body; but this work in itself is
dead, and does not live except from the spiritual that is in it; and the
spiritual does not live except from the celestial, which lives from the
Lord. From this the work is said to be good, since there is nothing good
except from the Lord. \[3\] This being the case, it must be evident to
everyone that in every work of charity the work itself is nothing but a
material affair, and that the work is living is attributable to the
truth of faith that is in it; and further that neither is the truth of
faith anything but an inanimate affair, and that the truth of faith is
living is attributable to the good of faith; moreover that the good of
faith is not living except from the Lord only, who is Good itself and
Life itself. This shows why the celestial angels are unwilling to hear
about faith, and are still more unwilling to hear about work (see n.
202). For the celestial angels ascribe to love both the faith and the
work, making faith to be from love, and making even the work of faith to
be from love, so that with them both the work and the faith vanish, and
there remains nothing but love and its derivative good, and within their
love is the Lord. In consequence of having ideas so heavenly these
angels are distinct from those angels who are called spiritual, their
very thought (together with the speech that is derived from this
thought) being much more incomprehensible than are the thought and the
speech of the spiritual angels.

<span class="margnote"><span id="881.">881.</span></span>

That "seven" signifies what is holy, because charity is now treated of,
is evident from the signification of "seven" (concerning which above, n.
395, 716). Moreover "seven" is inserted here for the coherence of all
things historically, as "seven" and "seven days" in the natural sense
add nothing but a certain holiness, which this second state has from the
celestial, that is, from charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="882.">882.</span></span>

And again he sent forth the dove out of the ark. That this signifies a
state of receiving the goods and truths of faith, is evident from what
was said at the eighth verse, where similar words occur, but with the
difference that it is there said, he sent forth the dove "from him;" for
the reason there explained, that at that time he did what was true and
good from himself, that is, he believed it to be from his own power,
which is meant by the words "from him."

<span class="margnote"><span id="883.">883.</span></span>

And the dove came back to him at eventide. That this signifies that
little by little the goods and truths of faith began to appear, and that
"eventide" means as in the twilight before morning, is likewise evident
from what has been said above, at the eighth verse; as well as from the
fact that the time of evening is here mentioned. In regard to "evening"
see what was said under the first chapter of Genesis, where it is said
six times, "there was evening and there was morning." "Evening" is a
term of regeneration, and indeed of that state of it when the man is
still in shade, or when as yet only a little light is apparent to him.
The morning itself is described in the thirteenth verse by Noah's
removing the covering of the ark and seeing. It was because "evening"
signified the twilight before morning, that "evening" is so many times
mentioned in connection with the Jewish Church. For the same reason also
they began their sabbaths and their feasts in the evening, and Aaron was
commanded to light the holy lamp in the evening (Exod. 27:20-21).

<span class="margnote"><span id="884.">884.</span></span>

And lo in her mouth an olive leaf plucked off. That this signifies some
little of the truth of faith; that "leaf" is truth, and "olive" the good
of charity; that "plucked off" means the truth of faith therefrom, and
"in her mouth" that it was shown, is evident from the signification of
an olive tree, and is obvious from the very words. And that there was
only a little, appears from there being only a leaf.

<span class="margnote"><span id="885.">885.</span></span>

That a "leaf" signifies truth, is evident from many passages in the Word
where man is compared to a tree, or is called a tree, and where "fruits"
signify the good of charity, and a "leaf" the truth therefrom (which
indeed they are like); as in Ezekiel: And by the river upon the bank
thereof, on this side and on that side, there cometh up every tree for
food, whose leaf doth not fall, neither is the fruit consumed, it is
reborn every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the
sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof
for medicine (Ezek. 47:12; Rev. 22:2). Here "tree" denotes the man of
the church in whom is the kingdom of the Lord; its "fruit" the good of
love and of charity; its "leaf" the truths therefrom, which serve for
the instruction of the human race and for their regeneration, for which
reason the leaf is said to be for "medicine." Again: Shall He not pull
up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof that it wither? it
shall wither in all the plucked off \[leaves\] of its shoot (Ezek.
17:9). This is said of the vine, that is, the church, in a state of
vastation, whose good, which is the "fruit" and whose truth, which is
the "plucked off \[leaf\] of the shoot" thus withers. \[2\] In Jeremiah:
Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jehovah; he shall be like a tree
planted by the waters; his leaf shall be green; and he shall not be
anxious in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit
(Jer. 17:7-8); where the "green leaf" denotes the truth of faith, thus
the very faith which is from charity. So in David (Ps. 1:3); and again
in Jeremiah: There shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the
fig-tree, and the leaf is fallen (Jer. 8:13); "grapes on the vine"
denote spiritual good; "figs on the fig-tree" natural good; "leaf"
truth, which in this case is "fallen." Likewise in Isaiah (34:4). The
same is meant by the fig-tree which Jesus saw and found nothing thereon
but leaves, and which therefore withered away (Matt. 21:19, 20; Mark
11:13-14, 20). Specifically, by this fig-tree there was meant the Jewish
Church, in which there was no longer anything of natural good; and the
religious teaching or truth that was preserved in it, are the "leaves;"
for a vastated church is such that it knows truth, but is not willing to
understand it. Similar are those who say that they know truth or the
things of faith, yet have nothing of the good of charity: they are only
fig-leaves, and they wither away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="886.">886.</span></span>

That the "olive" signifies the good of charity, is evident from the
signification in the Word not only of an "olive" but also of "oil." It
was with olive oil, together with spices, that the priests and kings
were anointed, and it was with olive oil that the lamps were trimmed
(see Exod. 30:24; 27:20). The reason olive oil was used for anointing
and for lamps was that it represented all that is celestial, and
therefore all the good of love and of charity; for the oil is the very
essence of the tree, and is as it were its soul, just as the celestial,
or the good of love and of charity, is the very essence or the very soul
of faith; and hence oil has this representation. That "oil" signifies
what is celestial, or the good of love and of charity, may be confirmed
from many passages of the Word; but as it is the olive-tree that is
mentioned here, we will merely present some passages that confirm its
signification. As in Jeremiah: Jehovah called thy name a green
olive-tree, fair with goodly fruit (Jer. 11:16),where the Most Ancient
or Celestial Church is so called, which was the foundation church of the
Jewish Church; and therefore all the representatives of the Jewish
Church had regard to celestial things, and through these to the Lord.
\[2\] In Hosea: His branches shall spread, and his honor shall be as the
olive-tree, and his smell as of Lebanon (Hos. 14:6), which is said of
the church that is to be planted, whose honor is the "olive-tree" that
is, the good of love and of charity; the "smell as of Lebanon" being the
affection of the truth of faith therefrom. "Lebanon" stands for its
cedars, which signified spiritual things, or the truths of faith. In
Zechariah, speaking of the lampstand: Two olive-trees by it, one upon
the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof;
these are the two sons of the pure oil that stand by the Lord of the
whole earth (Zech. 4:3, 11, 14). Here the "two olive-trees" denote the
celestial and the spiritual, thus love, which is of the celestial
church, and charity, which is of the spiritual church. These are on the
"right hand" and on the "left hand" of the Lord. The "lampstand" here
signifies, as in the Jewish Church it represented, the Lord; its "lamps"
signify celestial things from which are spiritual, as from a flame
proceed rays of light, or light. In David: Thy wife shall be as a
fruitful vine in the sides of thy house; thy sons like olive plants (Ps.
128:3); where "wife as a vine" denotes the spiritual church; "sons" the
truths of faith, which are called "olive plants" because from the goods
of charity. In Isaiah: Yet there shall be left therein gleanings, as the
shaking of an olive-tree, two or three berries in the top of the branch
(Isa. 17:6); where the subject treated of is the remains in man; "of an
olive-tree" denoting celestial remains. In Micah: Thou shalt tread the
olive, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt
not drink the wine (Micah 6:15). And in Moses: Thou shalt plant
vineyards and dress them, but thou shalt not drink of the wine; thou
shalt have olive-trees throughout all thy border, but thou shalt not
anoint thyself with the oil (Deut. 28:39-40), where the subject is the
abundance of doctrinal teachings about the goods and truths of faith,
which by reason of their character, those people rejected. From these
passages it is evident that a "leaf" signifies the truth of faith, and
an "olive" the good of charity; and that like things are signified by
the "olive-leaf" which the dove brought in her mouth; that is, that
there now appeared in the man of the Ancient Church some little of the
truth of faith from the good of charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="887.">887.</span></span>

That the waters were abated from off the earth. That this signifies that
these things were so because the falsities that impeded were less
abundant than before, is evident from the signification of the same
words above, at the eighth verse. As to the falsities that impeded being
less abundant in the second state, which is now treated of, the case is
that all the falsities which man has acquired remain, so that not one is
abolished, as before said; but when man is being regenerated, there are
truths implanted to which the falsities are bent by the Lord, and thus
appear as if shaken off, and this by means of the goods with which the
man is being gifted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="888.">888.</span></span>

Verse 12. And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove,
and she returned not again unto him anymore. "And he stayed yet other
seven days" signifies the beginning of a third state; "seven days"
signify what is holy; "and sent forth the dove" signifies a state of
receiving the goods and truths of faith; "and she returned not again
unto him anymore" signifies a free state.

<span class="margnote"><span id="889.">889.</span></span>

And he stayed yet other seven days. That this signifies the beginning of
a third state, and that "seven" signifies what is holy, is evident from
what has just now been said about the second state, where similar words
are used.

<span class="margnote"><span id="890.">890.</span></span>

And sent forth the dove. That this signifies a state of receiving the
goods and truths of faith, is likewise evident from what was said at the
tenth verse, where are the same words and the same meaning, except that
there the second state, and here the third state, is treated of. The
third state is described by the dove's not returning, and also by Noah's
removing the covering of the ark, and at length by his going forth from
the ark because the face of the ground was dried and the earth was dry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="891.">891.</span></span>

And she returned not again unto him anymore. That this signifies a free
state, follows, and indeed from the fact that the dove (or the truth of
faith) and the other birds, as also the beasts, and Noah himself, were
no longer kept in the ark on account of the waters of the flood. So long
as he was in the ark, he was in a state of slavery, or of bondage or
imprisonment, tossed about by the waters of the flood, or falsities.
This state, together with the state of temptation, is described in the
preceding chapter (verse 17), by the waters increasing and bearing up
the ark, and by the ark being lifted up above the earth; also in the
next verse by the waters being strengthened and the ark going on the
face of the waters. In the present chapter (verses 15 to 18) the man's
state of freedom is described by Noah going forth from the ark, and all
that were with him, the dove first of all (that is, the truth of faith
from good), for all freedom is from the good of faith, that is, from the
love of good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="892.">892.</span></span>

When man has been regenerated, he then for the first time comes into a
state of freedom, having before been in a state of slavery. It is
slavery when cupidities and falsities rule, and freedom when the
affections of good and truth do so. How this is, no man ever perceives
so long as he is in a state of slavery, but only when he comes into a
state of freedom. When he is in a state of slavery, that is, when
cupidities and falsities rule, the man who is under subjection to them
supposes that he is in a state of freedom; but this is a gross falsity,
for he is then carried away by the delight of the cupidities and their
pleasures, that is, by the delight of his loves; and because this is
done by delight, it appears to him to be freedom. Every man, while he is
led by any love, and while following whithersoever it carries him,
supposes himself to be free, whereas it is the diabolical spirits in
whose company, and so to speak torrent, he is, that are carrying him
away. This the man supposes to be the greatest freedom, so much so that
he believes that the loss of this state would bring him into a life most
wretched, indeed into no life at all; and he believes this not merely
because he is unaware of the existence of any other life, but also
because he is under the impression that no one can come into heaven
except through miseries, poverty, and the loss of pleasures. But that
this impression is false has been given me to know by much experience,
of which by the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. Man never comes into a
state of freedom until he has been regenerated, and is led by the Lord
through love for what is good and true. When he is in this state, then
for the first time can he know and perceive what freedom is, because he
then knows what life is, and what the true delight of life is, and what
happiness is. Before this he does not even know what good is, sometimes
calling that the greatest good which is the greatest evil. When those
who are in a state of freedom from the Lord see, and still more when
they feel, a life of cupidities and falsities, they abhor it as do those
who see hell open before their eyes. But as it is quite unknown to very
many what a life of freedom is, it may be here briefly defined. A life
of freedom, or freedom, is simply and solely being led by the Lord. But
as there are many things which hinder man from being able to believe
that this is a life of freedom, both because men undergo temptations,
which take place in order that they may be set free from the dominion of
diabolical spirits; and because they know of no other delight than that
of cupidities from the love of self and of the world, as well as from
their having conceived a false opinion in regard to all things of the
heavenly life, so that they cannot be taught by description so well as
by living experiences, therefore, of the Lord's Divine mercy, we may
adduce such experiences hereafter.

Verse 13. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the
beginning, on the first of the month, that the waters were dried up from
off the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and saw, and
behold, the faces of the ground were dry. "And it came to pass in the
six hundred and first year" signifies a last boundary \[or ending\]; "in
the beginning, on the first of the month" signifies a first boundary
\[or new beginning\]; "the waters were dried up from off the earth"
signifies that falsities did not then appear; "and Noah removed the
covering of the ark, and looked" signifies on the removal of falsities
there was the light of the truths of faith, which he acknowledged and in
which he had faith; "and behold the faces of the ground were dry"
signifies regeneration. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first
year. That this signifies a last boundary, is evident from the
signification of the number "six hundred" concerning which in the
preceding chapter (Gen. 7:6, n. 737), as being a beginning, and there
indeed the beginning of temptation, its end being here designated by the
same number, a whole year having passed, so that what took place was at
the end of the year, and therefore it is added, "in the beginning, on
the first of the month" by which is signified a first boundary \[or new
beginning\]. Any whole period is designated in the Word as a "day" a
"week" a "month" a "year" even though it be a hundred or a thousand
years, as the "days" in the first chapter of Genesis, by which are meant
periods of the regeneration of the man of the Most Ancient Church; for
"day" and "year" in the internal sense signify nothing else than a time,
and because they signify a time they signify a state, and therefore in
the Word a "year" is continually used with the meaning of a time and a
state. As in Isaiah: To proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah, and the
day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn (Isa. 61:2),
where the coming of the Lord is treated of. Again: For the day of
vengeance was in Mine heart, and the year of My redeemed had come (Isa.
63:4), where also "day" and "year" denote a time and state. In Habakkuk:
O Jehovah, revive Thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of
the years make known (Hab. 3:2), where "years" denote a time and state.
In David: Thou art God Himself, and Thy years are not consumed (Ps.
102:27), where "years" denote times, and it is shown that with God there
is no time. So in the passage before us, the year of the flood by no
means signifies any particular year, but a time not determined by fixed
years, and at the same time a state. (See what has been said before
about "years" n. 482, 487, 488, 493.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="894.">894.</span></span>

In the beginning, on the first of the month. That this signifies a first
boundary \[or new beginning\], is now evident from what has been shown.
What is further involved in these words is too deeply hidden to be
described any further than that there is no definite period of time
within which man's regeneration is completed, so that he can say, "I am
now perfect;" for there are illimitable states of evil and falsity with
every man, not only simple states but also states in many ways
compounded, which must be so far shaken off as no longer to appear, as
said above. In some states the man may be said to be more perfect, but
in very many others not so. Those who have been regenerated in the life
of the body and have lived in faith in the Lord and in charity toward
the neighbor, are continually being perfected in the other life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="895.">895.</span></span>

The waters were dried up from off the earth. That this signifies that
falsities did not then appear, is evident from what has been said.
Specifically it signifies that falsities have been separated from the
things of the will of the man of this church. The "earth" here signifies
man's will, which is nothing but cupidity; wherefore it is said that
"the waters were dried up from off the earth." His "ground" as said
above, is in his intellectual part, in which truths are sown-never in
his will part, which in the spiritual man is separate from the
intellectual; wherefore it is said afterwards in this verse that the
face of the "ground" was dried. With the man of the Most Ancient Church
there was ground in his will, in which the Lord sowed goods, and then
from the goods the man could know and perceive truth, or from love could
have faith; but if this method were followed now, man could not but
perish eternally, for his will is wholly corrupted. How the case is with
this sowing in man's will part, or-as is the case now-in his
intellectual part, is evident from considering that revelations were
made to the man of the Most Ancient Church by means of which he from his
infancy was initiated into a perception of goods and truths, but as
those revelations were sown in his will part, he without new instruction
perceived innumerable things, so that from one general principle he knew
from the Lord the particulars and the singulars which now men have to
learn and so know, and yet after all they can know scarcely a thousandth
part of them. For the man of the spiritual church knows nothing but what
he learns, and what he knows in this way he retains and believes to be
true. Indeed even if he learns what is false, and this is impressed on
his mind as true, he believes it, because he has no other perception
than that it is so, for so is he persuaded. Those who have conscience
have from conscience a certain dictate, but no other than that a thing
is true because they have so heard and learned. This is what forms their
conscience, as is evident from those who have a conscience of what is
false.

<span class="margnote"><span id="896.">896.</span></span>

And Noah removed the covering of the ark and saw. That this signifies,
on the removal of falsities the light of the truths of faith, which he
acknowledged and in which he had faith, is evident from the
signification of "removing the covering" as being to take away what
obstructs the light. As by the "ark" is signified the man of the Ancient
Church who was to be regenerated, by the "covering" nothing else can be
signified than what obstructs or prevents from seeing heaven, or the
light. What prevented was falsity; wherefore it is said that he "saw."
In the Word "to see" signifies to understand and to have faith. Here it
means that the man acknowledged truths and had faith in them. It is one
thing to know truths, and quite another to acknowledge them, and still
another to have faith in them. To know is the first thing of
regeneration, to acknowledge is the second, to have faith is the third.
What difference there is between knowing, acknowledging, and having
faith is evident from the fact that the worst men may know, and yet not
acknowledge, like the Jews and those who attempt to destroy doctrinal
things by specious reasoning; and that unbelievers may acknowledge, and
in certain states preach, confirm, and persuade with zeal; but none can
have faith who are not believers. \[2\] Those who have faith, know,
acknowledge, and believe, they have charity, and they have conscience;
and therefore faith can never be predicated of anyone, that is, it
cannot be said that he has faith, unless these things are true of him.
This then it is to be regenerate. Merely to know what is of faith is of
a man's memory, without the concurrence of his reason. To acknowledge
what is of faith is a rational consent induced by certain causes and for
the sake of certain ends. But to have faith is of conscience, that is,
of the Lord working through conscience. This is abundantly evident from
those who are in the other life. Those who only know are many of them in
hell. Those who acknowledge are also many of them there, because their
acknowledgment in the life of the body has been in certain states only,
and when in the other life they perceive that what they had preached,
taught, and persuaded others is true, they wonder greatly and
acknowledge it only when it is recalled to their memory as what they had
preached. But those who have had faith are all in heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="897.">897.</span></span>

In this place, the subject being the man of the Ancient Church when
regenerated, by "seeing" is signified acknowledging and having faith.
That "seeing" has this signification is evident from the Word; as in
Isaiah: Ye looked not unto the Maker thereof, and the Former thereof
from afar ye have not seen (Isa. 22:11), speaking of the city of Zion;
"not to see the Former from afar" is not to acknowledge, still less to
have faith. Again: Make the heart of this people fat, and make their
ears heavy, and smear over their eyes, lest they see with their eyes,
and hear with their ears, and their heart should understand, and turn
again, and be healed (Isa. 6:10); "to see with their eyes" denotes
acknowledging and having faith. Again: The people that walked in
darkness have seen a great light (Isa. 9:2), said of the Gentiles who
received faith; as it is here said of Noah, that he "removed the
covering and saw." Again: And in that day shall the deaf hear the words
of the Book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of thick darkness
and out of darkness (Isa. 29:18), speaking of the conversion of the
Gentiles to faith; "to see" denotes to receive faith. Again: Hear, ye
deaf and look, ye blind, that ye may see (Isa. 42:18), where the meaning
is similar. In Ezekiel: Who have eyes to see, and see not, who have ears
to hear, and hear not; for they are a rebellious house (Ezek. 12:2),
meaning who can understand, acknowledge, and have faith, and yet will
not. That "to see" signifies to have faith, is evident from the
representation of the Lord by the brazen serpent in the wilderness, on
seeing which all were healed; as in Moses: Make thee a fiery serpent,
and set it upon a standard; and it shall come to pass that everyone that
is bitten, when he seeth it, shall live; and it came to pass that if a
serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he
lived (Num. 21:8, 9); from which passage everyone can see that "to see"
signifies faith; for what would seeing avail in this case, except as a
representative of faith in the Lord? Hence also it is evident that
Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, being so called from "seeing" signifies in
the internal sense faith. (See what was said before about the firstborn
of the church, n. 352, 367.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="898.">898.</span></span>

And behold, the faces of the ground were dry. That this signifies
regeneration, is evident from the signification of "ground" as being the
man of the church, which has been repeatedly shown above. The face of
the ground is said to be "dry" when falsities no longer appear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="899.">899.</span></span>

Verse 14. In the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
month, was the earth dry. "The second month" signifies the whole state
before regeneration; "on the seven and twentieth day of the month"
signifies what is holy; "was the earth dry" signifies that he was
regenerate. These words are a conclusion to what goes before, and a
beginning to what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="900.">900.</span></span>

In the second month. That this signifies the whole state before
regeneration, is evident from the signification of "two" in the Word.
"Two" signifies the same as "six" that is, the combat and labor which
precede regeneration; thus here the whole state which precedes the
completion of man's regeneration. Periods of time, great and small, are
commonly distinguished in the Word as "threes" or "sevens" and are
called "days" "weeks" "months" "years" or "ages." "Three" and "seven"
are holy, "two" and "six" which precede, are not holy, but are
relatively profane, as before shown (n. 720). "Three" and "seven" are
both sacred for the additional reason that they are predicated of the
last judgment, which is to come on the "third" or on the "seventh" day.
The last judgment comes to everyone when the Lord comes, both in general
and in particular. For example, there was a last judgment when the Lord
came into the world, and there will be a last judgment when He shall
come in glory; there is a last judgment when He comes to any man
whatever in particular; and there is also a last judgment for everyone
when he dies. This last judgment is what is meant by the "third day" and
the "seventh day" which is holy to those who have lived well, but not
holy to those who have lived ill. Thus the "third day" or the "seventh
day" is predicated as well of those who are adjudged to death, as of
those who are adjudged to life; and therefore these numbers signify what
is not holy to those who are adjudged to death, and what is holy to
those who are adjudged to life. "Two" and "six" preceding three and
seven, have relation to and signify in general all that state which
precedes. This is the signification of "two" and of "six" in application
to any subject, and to any matter that is the subject of which they are
predicated, as is more clearly evident from what now follows about the
number twenty-seven.
