### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="5351.">5351.</span></span>

And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh. That this
signifies a new will in the natural, and its quality, is evident from
the representation of Manasseh in the Word, as being spiritual good in
the natural, and thus a new will (of which below): this name also
involves the very quality of this good, or of this new will. That the
"name" involves this quality may be seen from the names given to others
also, the quality of which is at the same time indicated, as is the name
"Manasseh" in the words, "for God hath made me forget all my toil, and
all my father's house;" for in this way is described the quality
signified by "Manasseh." Moreover when it is said "he called the name,"
there is also signified that the name itself contains the quality; for
the "name" and "calling the name" signifies the quality (see n. 144,
145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006, 3421). \[2\] The reason why the
firstborn, who is named Manasseh, signifies spiritual good in the
natural, or the new will therein, is that good is actually the firstborn
in the church, or in the man who becomes a church; whereas truth is not
the firstborn, and yet it appears as if it were (n. 352, 367, 2435,
3325, 3494, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930), as may also be seen from the fact
that in man the will precedes; for man's willing is the first of his
life, and his understanding comes after, and applies itself in
accordance with his willing. What proceeds from the will is called
"good" in those who by regeneration have received from the Lord a new
will, but "evil" in those who have not desired to receive it; and what
proceeds from the understanding is called "truth" in the regenerate, but
"falsity" in the unregenerate. Yet as man's will does not appear to the
sense except through the understanding (for the understanding is the
will in form, or the will formed to the sense), it is therefore supposed
that the truth which proceeds from the understanding is the firstborn,
and yet it is not, except in appearance, for the reason given. \[3\]
Hence the old controversy as to whether the truth which is of faith, or
the good which is of charity, is the firstborn of the church. They who
decided from the appearance, said that truth is the firstborn, but they
who did not decide from the appearance, acknowledged that good is the
firstborn. Hence also it is that at the present day faith is made the
first and very essential of the church, and charity is made secondary
and not essential; but men have gone into error much further than the
ancients, by declaring that faith alone saves. In the church by "faith"
is meant all the truth of doctrine, and by "charity" all the good of
life. They indeed call charity and its works the "fruits of faith;" but
who believes that fruits do anything for salvation when it is believed
that a man may be saved by faith at the last hour of his life, whatever
his previous life has been, and when in their teaching they even
separate works, which are of charity, from faith, saying that faith
alone saves without good works, or that works, which are of the life, do
nothing toward salvation? Oh, what a faith! And oh, what a church! They
adore dead faith, and reject living faith; and yet faith without charity
is as a body without a soul, and we know that a body without a soul is
removed from sight and cast forth, because of its stench: so is it with
faith without charity in the other life. All those who have been in
faith so called without charity are in hell, while all who have been in
charity are in heaven; for everyone's life remains, but not his doctrine
except insofar as it is derived from his life. \[4\] That by "Manasseh"
is signified the new will in the natural, or what is the same, spiritual
good there, cannot be so well shown from other passages of the Word as
that by "Ephraim" is signified the new understanding in the natural, or
spiritual truth therein. Nevertheless the signification of "Manasseh"
can be inferred from that of "Ephraim;" for in the Word where two are
thus mentioned, by the one is signified good, and by the other truth;
and therefore that by "Manasseh" is signified spiritual good in the
natural, which good is of the new will, will be seen in what presently
follows about "Ephraim."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5352.">5352.</span></span>

For God hath made me forget all my toil. That this signifies removal
after temptations, is evident from the signification of "forgetting," as
being removal (see n. 5170, 5278); and from the signification of "toil,"
as being combats, thus temptations. Hence it follows that by the words
"God hath made me forget all my toil" is signified removal after
temptations, that is, the removal of the evils which have caused pain.
That this is signified is plain also from what is related of Joseph in
the land of Canaan among his brethren, and afterward in Egypt-in the
land of Canaan that he was cast into a pit and sold, in Egypt that he
served and was kept in prison for some years. That temptations are
signified by these events has already been shown, and that these are
what are meant by his "toil" is plain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5353.">5353.</span></span>

And all my father's house. That this signifies the removal of hereditary
evils, is evident from the signification of "father's house," as here
being hereditary evils; for by a "house" in the internal sense is
signified a man, and indeed his mind either rational or natural, but
specifically the will therein, consequently good or evil, because these
are predicated of the will (see n. 710, 2233, 2234, 3128, 4973, 4982,
5023); and therefore by "father's house" here are signified hereditary
evils. The quality signified by "Manasseh" is contained in these and the
immediately preceding words. In the original language "Manasseh" means
"forgetfulness," thus in the internal sense the removal of evils, both
actual and hereditary; for when these are removed, a new will arises,
for the new will comes into existence through the influx of good from
the Lord. The influx of good from the Lord with man is continuous; but
there are evils both actual and hereditary that hinder and obstruct the
reception of it; and therefore when these are removed, a new will comes
into existence. This is very evident in the case of those who are in
misfortune, misery, and illness; for as in these the loves of self and
of the world, from which come all evils, are removed, the man thinks
well about God and the neighbor, and also wishes his neighbor well. It
is similar in temptations, which are spiritual pains, and hence inward
miseries and despairings: by these chiefly are evils removed, and after
they have been removed, heavenly good flows in from the Lord, whereby a
new will is formed in the natural, and this new will is "Manasseh" in
the representative sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5354.">5354.</span></span>

And the name of the second called he Ephraim. That this signifies a new
understanding in the natural, and its quality, is evident from the
signification of a "name" and "calling a name," as being the quality
(see n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006, 3421); and from the
representation of Ephraim, as being the understanding in the natural (of
which in what follows). But first must be told what is meant by the new
understanding and the new will signified by "Ephraim and Manasseh." In
the church it is indeed known that man must be born again (that is, must
be regenerated) in order that he may enter the kingdom of God; for the
Lord has plainly declared this in John 3:3, 5. But what it is to be born
again is known only to few, for the reason that few know what good and
evil are, and this because they do not know what charity toward the
neighbor is; if they knew this, they would also know what good is, and
from good what evil is; for all that is good which comes from genuine
charity toward the neighbor. \[2\] But no one can be in this good from
himself, because it is the celestial itself which flows in from the
Lord. This celestial flows in continually, but evils and falsities stand
in the way of its being received; and therefore in order that it may be
received it is necessary for man to remove evils, and as far as he is
able falsities also, and thus dispose himself to receive the influx.
When after evils have been removed the man receives the influx, he at
the same time receives a new will and a new understanding; and from the
new will he feels delight in doing good to the neighbor from no selfish
end, and from the new understanding he perceives delight in learning
what is good and true for its own sake and for the sake of the life.
Inasmuch as this new understanding and new will come into existence
through influx from the Lord, the man who has been regenerated
acknowledges and believes that the good and truth with which he is
affected are not from himself but from the Lord, and also that whatever
is from himself, or of his own, is nothing but evil. \[3\] From all this
it is plain what it is to be born again, and also what the new will and
new understanding are. But the regeneration through which come the new
understanding and the new will is not accomplished in a moment, but goes
on from earliest infancy even to the close of life, and afterward in the
other life to eternity, and this by Divine means, innumerable and
unspeakable; for man of himself is nothing but evil, which continually
exhales as from a furnace, and continually endeavors to extinguish the
nascent good. The removal of such evil, and the inrooting of good in its
place, cannot be effected short of the whole course of life, and through
Divine means numberless and unspeakable. Of these means scarcely any are
known at the present day, for the reason that man does not suffer
himself to be regenerated, nor does he believe regeneration to be
anything, because he does not believe in a life after death. The process
of regeneration, which includes indescribable things, makes up the main
part of angelic wisdom, and is of such a nature that it cannot be fully
exhausted by any angel to eternity. Hence it is that this is the chief
subject treated of in the internal sense of the Word. \[4\] That
"Ephraim" is the new understanding in the natural, is plain from very
many passages in the Word, especially in the prophet Hosea, which treats
much of "Ephraim," and in which we read as follows: I know Ephraim, and
Israel is not hid from Me, in that thou hast wholly committed whoredom,
O Ephraim, Israel is defiled. Israel and Ephraim shall go to ruin by
their iniquity; Judah shall also go to ruin with them. Ephraim shall
become a solitude in the day of reproof. And I am as a moth to Ephraim,
and as a boring-worm to the house of Judah. And Ephraim saw his
sickness, and Judah his wound, and Ephraim went to the Assyrian, and
sent to king Jareb; and this one could not heal you (Hos. 5:3, 5, 9,
12-13). Again in the same prophet: When I healed Israel, then was the
iniquity of Ephraim unveiled, and the evils of Samaria; for they have
wrought a lie; and a thief cometh, and a troop spreadeth itself abroad.
And Ephraim was like a silly dove without heart; they called Egypt, they
went to Assyria. When they shall go I will spread my net over them (Hos.
7:1, 11-12). \[5\] Again: Israel is swallowed up; now shall they be
among the nations as a vessel wherein is no desire; when they went up to
Assyria, a wild ass alone; Ephraim winneth him loves with a harlot's
hire (Hos. 8:8-9); Israel shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah, and
Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat what is unclean in
Assyria (Hos. 9:3); Ephraim hath compassed me about with a lie, and the
house of Israel with deceit; and Judah yet ruleth with God, and is
faithful with the saints; Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after
the east wind; every day he multiplieth a lie and wasting, and they make
a covenant with the Assyrian, and oil is carried down into Egypt (Hos.
11:12; 12:1); besides many other passages in the same prophet concerning
Ephraim (as chap. 4:17-19; 5:3, 5, 9, 11-14; 7:8, 9; 9:8, 11, 13, 16;
10:6, 11; 11:3, 8, 9; 12:8, 14; 13:1, 12; 14:8). \[6\] In all these
passages by "Ephraim" is meant the intellectual of the church, by
"Israel" its spiritual, and by "Judah" its celestial; and it is because
the intellectual of the church is signified by "Ephraim" that it is so
often said of him that he "goes away into Egypt," and "into Assyria;"
for by "Egypt" are signified memory-knowledges, and by "Assyria"
reasonings from these; both being predicated of the understanding. (That
"Egypt" signifies memory-knowledge may be seen above, n. 1164, 1165,
1186, 1462, 2588, 3325, 4749, 4964, 4966; and also that "Assyria"
signifies reason and reasoning, n. 119, 1186.) \[7\] In like manner in
the following passages by "Ephraim" is signified the understanding of
the church: Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; sound, O daughter of
Jerusalem; behold thy King cometh to thee. I will cut off the chariot
from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and I will cut off the
battle bow; He shall speak peace against the nations; and His dominion
shall be from sea to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the
earth. I will bend Judah for Me, I will fill Ephraim with the bow, and I
will stir up thy sons, O Zion, with thy sons, O Javan (Zech. 9:9-10,
13); said of the coming of the Lord and of the church of the Gentiles.
"To cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem"
denotes to cut off all the understanding of the church; "to fill Ephraim
with the bow" denotes to give a new understanding. That a "chariot"
signifies what is of doctrine may be seen above (n. 5321), a "horse,"
what is of the understanding (n. 2760-2762, 3217, 5321); and a "bow"
also what is of doctrine (2685, 2686, 2709); for what is of doctrine
depends on what is of the understanding, for it is believed as it is
understood, the understanding of the doctrine determining the quality of
the faith. \[8\] Hence also the sons of Ephraim are called "shooters
with the bow," in David: The sons of Ephraim, who were armed and
shooters with the bow, turned back in the day of battle (Ps. 78:9). In
Ezekiel: Son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah,
and for the sons of Israel his companions; then take another stick, and
write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and of all the house of
Israel his companions; afterward join them for thee one to another into
one stick, that the two may become one in my hand. Behold I will take
the stick of Joseph that is in the hands of Ephraim and of the tribes of
Israel his companions, and will add those who are upon it with the stick
of Judah, and I will make them one stick, that they may be one in My
hand (Ezek. 37:16-17, 19); where also by "Judah" is meant the celestial
of the church, by "Israel" its spiritual, and by "Ephraim" its
intellectual. That these are made one through the good of charity, is
signified by one stick being made out of two. (That a "stick of wood" is
the good of charity and consequently the good of works, may be seen
above, n. 1110, 2784, 2812, 3720, 4943.) \[9\] In Jeremiah: There shall
be a day that the watchman from the mountain of Ephraim shall cry, Arise
ye, let us go up to Zion unto Jehovah our God. I will be a father to
Israel, and Ephraim My firstborn is he (Jer. 31:6, 9). In the same: I
have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, Thou hast chastised me, and
I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed; turn Thou me, that I may be
turned. Is not Ephraim a precious son to Me? Is he not a child of
delights? For after I have spoken against him, I will surely remember
him again (Jer. 31:18, 20). I will bring back Israel to his habitation,
that he may feed in Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be sated in
the mountain of Ephraim and in Gilead (Jer. 50:19). In Isaiah: Woe to
the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, and to the fading
flower and to the glory of his adornment, which are upon the head of the
valley of the fat ones that are troubled with wine (Isa. 28:1). \[10\]
In these passages also by "Ephraim" is signified the understanding of
the church. The understanding of the church is the understanding the men
of the Church have of truths and goods, that is, of the doctrinal things
of faith and charity; thus their notion, concept, or idea about them.
Truth itself is the spiritual of the church, and good is its celestial;
but truth and good are understood differently by different men; such
therefore as is the understanding of truth, such is the truth with
everyone. It is similar with the understanding of good. \[11\] What the
will of the church is that is signified by "Manasseh," may be known from
its understanding, which is "Ephraim." It is with the will of the church
as with its understanding, namely, that it is varied with each person.
"Manasseh" signifies this will in Isaiah: In the wrath of Jehovah
Zebaoth the land is darkened, and the people is become like food for the
fire; no man shall spare his brother; they shall eat every man the flesh
of his own arm: Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: they together
are against Judah (Isa. 9:19-21); where "every man eating the flesh of
his own arm, Manasseh, Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh" denotes that the
will of the man of the church will be against his understanding, and his
understanding against his will. \[12\] In David: God hath spoken by His
holiness: I will exult, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley
of Succoth. Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; and Ephraim is the
strength of My head (Ps. 60:6-7). Again: Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest upon the
cherubim, shine forth. Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up
Thy might (Ps. 80:1-2); where also "Ephraim" denotes the understanding
of the church, and "Manasseh" its will. The same is plain also from the
blessing of Ephraim and Manasseh by Jacob before his death (Gen.
48:13-20); and also from Jacob's accepting Ephraim in place of Reuben,
and Manasseh in place of Simeon (Gen. 48:3, 5); for by Reuben was
represented the understanding of the church, or faith in the
understanding and in doctrine (see n. 3861, 3866), and by Simeon, faith
in act, or obedience and will to do the truth, from which and by which
is charity, and thus truth in act, which is the good of the new will (n.
3869-3872). \[13\] The reason why Jacob, then Israel, blessed Ephraim in
preference to Manasseh, by putting his right hand upon the former and
his left upon the latter (Gen. 48:13-20), was the same that Jacob had
for diverting to himself the birthright of Esau, and the same as in the
case of Perez and Zerah the sons of Judah by Tamar, when Zerah, who was
the firstborn, came forth after Perez (Gen. 38:28-30). This reason was
that the truth of faith, which is of the understanding, is apparently in
the first place during man's regeneration, and then the good of charity,
which is of the will, is apparently in the second place; and yet good is
actually in the first place, and is manifestly so when the man has been
regenerated (as may be seen above, n. 3324, 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563,
3570, 3576, 3603, 3701, 4243, 4244, 4247, 4337, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930,
4977).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5355.">5355.</span></span>

For God hath made me fruitful. That this signifies the consequent
multiplication of truth from good, is evident from the signification of
"making fruitful," as being multiplication, namely, of truth from good;
for "fruitfulness" is predicated of good, and "multiplication" of truth
(n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 1940, 2846, 2847). Hence in the original language
"Ephraim" was named from fruitfulness, and his quality is contained in
the words, "for God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
This quality is that truth from good was multiplied in the natural after
the temptations suffered there. What the multiplication of truth from
good is shall be briefly stated. When man is in good, that is, in love
toward the neighbor, he is also in the love of truth; consequently
insofar as he is in this good, so far he is affected by truth, for good
is in truth as the soul in its body. As therefore good multiplies truth,
so it propagates itself; and if it is the good of genuine charity, it
propagates itself in truth and by truth indefinitely; for there is no
limit to good or to truth. The Infinite is in all things in general and
in particular, because they are all from the Infinite; but still the
indefinite can never in any way reach the Infinite, because there is no
ratio between the finite and the Infinite. In the church today there is
rarely any multiplication of truth, for the reason that at this day
there is no good of genuine charity. It is believed to be sufficient to
know the dogmas of faith of the church in which the man is born, and to
confirm them by various means. But one who is in the good of genuine
charity, and thence in the affection of truth, is not content with this,
but desires to be enlightened from the Word as to what truth is, and to
see the truth before he confirms it. Moreover, he sees it from good,
because the perception of truth is from good; for the Lord is in good,
and gives the perception. When a man receives truth in this way, it
increases indefinitely. In this respect it is like a little seed, which
grows into a tree, and produces other little seeds, which in turn
produce a garden, and so on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5356.">5356.</span></span>

In the land of my affliction. That this signifies where temptations were
suffered, is evident from the signification of the "land," here the land
of Egypt, as being the natural (see n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301);
and from the signification of "affliction," as being temptation (n.
1846). From this it is plain that by "in the land of my affliction" is
signified in the natural where temptations were suffered, and
consequently that truth from good was multiplied therein. As this
fruitfulness or multiplication of truth from good is effected chiefly by
means of temptations, it was thus expressed. The reasons why this
fruitfulness is effected chiefly by means of temptations, are these.
Temptations remove the loves of self and of the world, thus evils; on
the removal of which the affection of good and truth flows in from the
Lord (see just above, n. 5354). Temptations also give quality to the
perception of good and truth, by means of the opposite things which evil
spirits then infuse; and it is by perceiving opposites that we get
relatives, from which comes all quality; for no one knows what is good
without also knowing what is not good, nor what is true without knowing
what is not true. Temptations also confirm goods and truths, for the man
then fights against evils and falsities, and by conquering comes into a
stronger affirmative. Moreover, by means of temptations evils and
falsities are subdued, so that they no longer venture to rise up; and in
this way evils with falsities are rejected to the sides, and there hang,
but drooping downward; while goods with truths are in the midst, and
according to the zeal of affection are lifted upward, thus to heaven
toward the Lord, by whom they are lifted up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5357.">5357.</span></span>

Verses 53-57. And the seven years of abundance of produce that was in
the land of Egypt were ended. And the seven years of famine began to
come, as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all lands; and in all
the land of Egypt there was bread. And all the land of Egypt was
famished, and the people cried unto Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said
to all Egypt, Go unto Joseph; what he saith unto you, do. And the famine
was over all the faces of the land, and Joseph opened all the
storehouses, and sold to Egypt; and the famine was strengthened in the
land of Egypt. And all the earth came into Egypt to buy, to Joseph;
because the famine was strengthened in all the earth. "And the seven
years of abundance of produce were ended," signifies after the states of
the multiplication of truth; "that was in the land of Egypt," signifies
in the natural; "and the seven years of famine began to come," signifies
the following states of desolation; "as Joseph had said," signifies as
had been foreseen by the celestial of the spiritual; "and there was
famine in all lands," signifies desolation everywhere in the natural;
"and in all the land of Egypt there was bread," signifies remains in
consequence of truths from good having been multiplied; "and all the
land of Egypt was famished," signifies desolation in both naturals; "and
the people cried unto Pharaoh for bread," signifies the need of good for
truth; "and Pharaoh said to all Egypt," signifies perception; "Go unto
Joseph," signifies that it was from the celestial of the spiritual;
"what he saith to you, do," signifies provided there is obedience; "and
the famine was over all the faces of the land," signifies that there was
desolation even to despair; "and Joseph opened all the storehouses,"
signifies communication from remains; "and sold to Egypt," signifies
appropriation; "and the famine was strengthened in the land of Egypt,"
signifies increasing severity; "and all the earth came into Egypt,"
signifies that truths and goods were brought into the memory knowledges
of the church; "to buy," signifies appropriation therefrom; "to Joseph,"
signifies where the celestial of the spiritual was; "because the famine
was strengthened in all the earth," signifies that everywhere, except
there, was there desolation in the natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5358.">5358.</span></span>

And the seven years of abundance of produce were ended. That this
signifies after the states of the multiplication of truth, is evident
from what was unfolded above (n. 5276, 5292, 5339), where similar words
occur.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5359.">5359.</span></span>

That was in the land of Egypt. That this signifies in the natural, is
evident from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the
natural (see n. 5080, 5095, 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5360.">5360.</span></span>

And the seven years of famine began to come. That this signifies the
following states of desolation, is evident from the signification of
"years," as being states (see n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 893); and from the
signification of "famine," as being a lack of the knowledges of truth
and good (n. 1460, 3364), consequently desolation. That a famine denotes
such a lack, or desolation, is because celestial and spiritual food are
nothing else than good and truth. These are what angels and spirits are
nourished by, and what they hunger for when hungry, and thirst for when
thirsty; and therefore also material food corresponds thereto-as bread
to celestial love, and wine to spiritual love, as well as everything
that pertains to bread or food, and to wine or drink. When therefore
there is a lack of such things, there is a "famine," and in the Word
this is called "desolation" and "vastation" - "desolation" when truths
fail, and "vastation" when goods fail. This desolation and vastation is
treated of in many passages of the Word, and is there described by the
desolation of the earth, of kingdoms, of cities, of nations, and of
peoples, and is also termed a "pouring out," a "cutting off," a
"consummation," a "desert," and a "void;" and the state itself is called
the "great day of Jehovah," the "day of His wrath" and "vengeance," a
"day of darkness," and "thick darkness," of "cloud" and of "obscurity,"
a "day of visitation," also the "day when the earth shall perish," thus
the "last day" and the "day of judgment;" and because men have not
understood the internal sense of the Word, they have hitherto supposed
that it meant a day when the earth will perish, and that then for the
first time will there be a resurrection and a judgment, not being aware
that by a "day" in such passages is signified a state, and by the
"earth" the church, and thus by a "day when the earth will perish," a
state when the church will come to its end; therefore when this
perishing is described in the Word, a "new earth" is also described, by
which is meant a new church. (In regard to the "new earth" and "new
heaven," see what is said above, n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4535.)
That last state of a church which precedes the state of a new church, is
properly meant and described in the Word by "vastation" and
"desolation." By the same words is described also the state that
precedes man's regeneration, which state is here signified by the seven
years of famine.

As Joseph had said. That this signifies as had been foreseen by the
celestial of the spiritual, is evident from the signification of
"saying" in the historicals of the Word, as being to perceive (as often
shown above), and therefore when predicated of the Lord, who here is
"Joseph," to perceive from Himself, thus to foresee; and from the
representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual (n.
5249, 5307, 5331, 5332).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5362.">5362.</span></span>

And there was famine in all lands. That this signifies desolation
everywhere in the natural, is evident from the signification of
"famine," as being desolation (see above, n. 5360); and from the
signification of "all lands," as being everywhere in the natural. (That
"land" denotes the natural mind, thus the natural, may also be seen
above, n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5363.">5363.</span></span>

But in all the land of Egypt there was bread. That this signifies
remains in consequence of truths from good having been multiplied, is
evident from the fact that by the "bread in all the land of Egypt" is
meant the corn gathered in the seven years of abundance of produce, and
laid up in the cities, by which are signified the remains stored up in
the interiors of the natural mind, as has frequently been stated and
shown above. Hence by the "bread in all the land of Egypt" are signified
the remains in consequence of truths from good having been multiplied.
That remains are here meant by the "bread in the land of Egypt," is
evident also from the fact that the years of famine had already begun,
in which the land of Egypt suffered famine equally with the other lands,
except that it had stores laid up which the other lands had not, and
therefore these words now follow, "and all the land of Egypt was
famished."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5364.">5364.</span></span>

And all the land of Egypt was famished. That this signifies desolation
in both naturals, is evident from the signification of "famine," as
being desolation (of which above, n. 5360, 5362); and from the
signification of "all the land," as being both naturals (n. 5276).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5365.">5365.</span></span>

And the people cried unto Pharaoh for bread. That this signifies the
need of good for truth, is evident from the signification of "crying,"
as being the act of a person in grief and mourning, thus being that of a
person in need; from the signification of "people," as being truth (see
n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being
the natural (n. 5079, 5080, 5095, 5160); and from the signification of
"bread," as being the celestial of love, thus good (n. 276, 680, 2165,
2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976). From this it
follows that by "the people cried unto Pharaoh for bread" is signified
the need in the natural of good for truth. This meaning indeed appears
remote from the historic sense of the letter; but still when they who
are in the internal sense understand by "crying," by "people," by
"Pharaoh," and by "bread," nothing else than what has been said, it
follows that this meaning results therefrom. \[2\] How the case is in
regard to the need of good for truth, must be told. Truth has need of
good, and good has need of truth; and when truth has need of good, truth
is conjoined with good, and when good has need of truth, good is
conjoined with truth; for the reciprocal conjunction of good and truth,
namely of truth with good and of good with truth, is the heavenly
marriage. In the early stages of man's regeneration, truth is
multiplied, but not good; and as truth has then no good with which to be
conjoined, it is drawn in and stored up in the interiors of the natural
mind, that it may be called forth thence according to the increasings of
good. In this state truth is in need of good, and moreover conjunction
of truth with good takes place according to the inflow of good into the
natural; but still no fruitfulness is effected by this conjunction. But
when man has been regenerated, then good increases; and as it increases
it is in need of truth, and also procures truth for itself with which it
may be conjoined, and thereupon there is a conjunction of good with
truth. When this takes place, truth is made fruitful from good, and good
from truth. \[3\] That this is the case is entirely unknown in the
world, but is very well known in heaven; and yet were it known in the
world (not only by knowledge but also by perception) what celestial love
or love to the Lord is, and what spiritual love or charity toward the
neighbor is, it would also be known what good is, for all good is of
these loves; and moreover it would be known that good desires truth, and
truth good, and that they are conjoined according to the desire and its
quality. This might be plain from the fact that when truth is thought
of, the good adjoined to it is presented at the same time; and when good
is stirred, the truth adjoined to it is presented at the present time-in
both cases with affection, desire, delight, or holy aspiration; and from
this the quality of the conjunction might be known. But as it is not
known from any inward sensation or perception what good is, such things
cannot come to knowledge; for that about which nothing is known is not
understood, even when it comes to view. \[4\] And as it is not known
what spiritual good is, and that it is charity toward the neighbor,
therefore it is a matter of dispute in the world, especially among the
learned, what is the highest good; and scarcely anyone has maintained
that it is that delight, satisfaction, blessedness, and happiness which
is perceived from mutual love devoid of any selfish or worldly end, and
which makes heaven itself. From this also it is plain that in the world
at this day it is not at all known what spiritual good is, and still
less that good and truth form a marriage together, and that heaven is in
this marriage, and that those who are in it are in wisdom and
intelligence and have satisfactions and happinesses with unlimited and
inexpressible variety, not one of which is known by the world, nor is
its existence even recognized and believed; when in fact it is heaven
itself, or that very heavenly joy of which so much is said in the
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5366.">5366.</span></span>

And Pharaoh said to all Egypt. That this signifies perception, is
evident from the signification of "saying" in the historicals of the
Word, as being to perceive (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2061,
2080, 2862, 3395, 3509); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being
the natural in general (n. 5160); and from the signification of "all
Egypt," as being both naturals (n. 5276, 5364). From this it is plain
that by "Pharaoh said to all Egypt" is signified perception in both
naturals, in general and in particular.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5367.">5367.</span></span>

Go unto Joseph. That this signifies that it was from the celestial of
the spiritual, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being
the celestial of the spiritual (of which often above). "To go unto him"
signifies that it was from him, namely, the good for truth which is
signified by the "bread for which the people cried unto Pharaoh" (see n.
5365).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5368.">5368.</span></span>

What he saith to you, do. That this signifies provided there is
obedience, is evident from the signification of "doing what anyone
says," as being to obey. By this is signified that good is adjoined to
truth in the natural, provided the natural applies itself and obeys.
Something must be said about the natural's applying itself and obeying.
They who are in worldly things only, and yet more they who are in bodily
things, and still more they who are in earthly ones, cannot apprehend
what is meant by saying that the natural ought to apply itself and obey.
They suppose that there is only one thing that acts in man, and
therefore that there is not one thing in him to command, and another to
obey; and yet it is the internal man that should command, and the
external that should obey, and that does obey when the man has not the
world as the end, but heaven, and not self but the neighbor,
consequently when he regards bodily and worldly things as means and not
as the end; and he so regards them when he loves his neighbor more than
himself, and the things of heaven more than those of the world. When
this is the case, the natural obeys; the natural is the same as the
external man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5369.">5369.</span></span>

And the famine was over all the faces of the earth. That this signifies
when there was desolation even to despair, is evident from the
signification of "famine," as being desolation (of which above, n. 5360,
5362, 5364); and from the signification of the "earth," as being the
natural. When famine is said to be "over all the faces" of this, despair
is signified, because the desolation is then everywhere; for the height
and extremity of desolation is despair (see n. 5279, 5280).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5370.">5370.</span></span>

And Joseph opened all the storehouses. <span
id="fr_133"></span>[5370-1](#fn_133.md) That this signifies communication
from remains, is evident from the signification of "opening," as here
being to communicate. "All the storehouses" are the repositories in
which the corn was stored, and by which are signified remains, as has
been repeatedly shown above. (That remains are goods and truths stored
up by the Lord in the interiors, may be seen above, n. 468, 530, 560,
561, 660, 661, 798, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284, 5135, 5342, 5344.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5371.">5371.</span></span>

And sold to Egypt. That this signifies appropriation, is evident from
the signification of "selling," as being to appropriate to anyone; for
what is sold becomes his who buys it. (That "selling" and "buying"
signify appropriation, will be seen below, n. 5374.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5372.">5372.</span></span>

And the famine was strengthened in the land of Egypt. That this
signifies increasing severity, that is, of the desolation, is evident
from the signification of "famine" and of the "land of Egypt," as being
desolation in the natural, the increasing severity of which is signified
by its "being strengthened."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5373.">5373.</span></span>

And all the earth came into Egypt. That this signifies that goods and
truths were brought into the memory-knowledges of the church, is evident
from the signification of the "earth." The signification of "earth" or
"land" in the Word is various: in general it signifies the church, and
hence the things belonging to the church, which are goods and truths;
and because it signifies the church, it signifies also the man of the
church, for he is the church in particular; and because it signifies the
man of the church, it signifies that in him which is the man, namely,
the mind. Hence it is that by the "land of Egypt" is occasionally above
signified the natural mind. In this passage, however, the land of Egypt
is not meant, but the earth in general, consequently the things of the
church, which are goods and truths. (That the signification of "land" or
"earth" is various may be seen above, n. 620, 636, 2571; and that in
general it signifies the church, n. 566, 662, 1068, 1262, 1413, 1607,
1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 3404, 4447, 4535.) \[2\] That by
"all the earth coming to Egypt" is signified that goods and truths were
brought into memory-knowledges is evident from the signification of
"Egypt" in the proper sense, as being memory-knowledge, consequently
matters of memory-knowledge (see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462); and that
the memory-knowledges signified in a good sense by "Egypt" are those of
the church (n. 4749, 4964, 4966). That this is the internal sense of
these words is plain not only from the signification of the word "earth"
or "land" when the land of Egypt is not meant, and from that of "Egypt"
in the proper sense, and from its being said, "all the earth came"
\[venerunt\] in the plural, but also from the very connection of things
in the internal sense; for in this connection it now follows that the
truths and goods of remains are brought into memory-knowledges. \[3\]
For the case is this: during man's regeneration as to the natural, goods
and truths are one and all brought together into memory-knowledges.
Those which are not in the memory-knowledges there, are not in the
natural; for the natural mind, as regards that part of it which is
subject to the understanding, consists solely of memory-knowledges. The
memory-knowledges that belong to the natural are the ultimates of order,
and things prior must be in ultimates in order to come into existence
and to appear in that sphere; and besides this all prior things tend to
ultimates as to their boundaries or ends, and come into existence
together therein as causes do in their effects, or as higher things do
in lower as in their vessels. The memory-knowledges of the natural are
such ultimates. Hence it is that the spiritual world is terminated in
man's natural, in which the things of the spiritual world are
representatively presented. Unless spiritual things were presented
representatively in the natural, thus by such things as are in the
world, they would not be apprehended at all. From all this it is evident
that during the regeneration of the natural all interior truths and
goods, which are from the spiritual world, are brought into
memory-knowledges, in order that they may appear.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5374.">5374.</span></span>

To buy. That this signifies appropriation therefrom, is evident from the
signification of "buying," as being to procure for one's self, thus to
appropriate. Procuring and appropriating spiritually are effected by
means of good and truth. To this corresponds the procuring and
appropriating that in the world are effected by means of silver and
gold; for in the spiritual sense "silver" is truth, and "gold" is good.
Hence "buying" signifies appropriation, as also in the following
passages in the Word: Everyone that thirsteth come ye to the waters, and
he that hath no silver; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come, buy wine and
milk without silver and without price (Isa. 55:1); and also in Jeremiah
(Jer. 13:1-2, 11). In Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto
treasure hid in the field; which when a man hath found, he hideth, and
in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchantman, seeking
goodly pearls, and he went and sold all that he had, and bought it
(Matt. 13:44-46). Again: The prudent virgins said to the foolish ones,
Go ye to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they went to
buy, the bridegroom came (Matt. 25:9-10). \[2\] As "buying" signifies
appropriation, therefore in the Word the things bought with silver are
well distinguished from those otherwise obtained. Moreover, the servants
bought with silver were as one's own, and in a lower degree like those
born in the house; and therefore they are often mentioned together, as
in Genesis: Circumcising he shall be circumcised that is born in thy
house, and he that is bought with thy silver (Gen. 17:13); and in
Leviticus: If a priest buy any soul with the purchase of silver, he and
one that is born in his house, they shall eat of his bread (Lev. 22:11).
Hence it is evident what is signified by the "redeemed (or those bought
back) of Jehovah," in the Word, namely, those who have received good and
truth, and thus those to whom the things of the Lord have been
appropriated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5375.">5375.</span></span>

To Joseph. That this signifies where the celestial of the spiritual was,
is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of
the spiritual, as often shown above. The celestial of the spiritual is
the good of truth from the Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5376.">5376.</span></span>

Because the famine was strengthened in all the earth. That this
signifies that everywhere, except there, was there desolation in the
natural, is evident from the signification of "famine," as being
desolation (of which above); and from the signification of "earth," as
being the natural (of which also above). Its being everywhere except
there, namely, in the memory-knowledges where the celestial of the
spiritual was, follows from what goes before. How the case is with the
desolation of the natural, or the deprivation of truth there, has
already been told; but as the same subject is continued in what follows,
it must be told again. The man who is born within the church, from
earliest childhood learns from the Word and from the doctrinal things of
the church what the truth of faith is, and also what the good of charity
is. But when he grows up to manhood he begins either to confirm or to
deny in himself the truths of faith that he has learned; for he then
looks at these truths with his own sight, and thereby causes them either
to be made his own or else to be rejected; for nothing can become one's
own that is not acknowledged of one's own insight, that is, which the
man does not know to be so from himself, and not from somebody else; and
therefore the truths learned from childhood enter no further into the
man's life than the first entrance, from which they can either be
admitted more interiorly, or else be cast out. \[2\] With those who are
being regenerated, that is, who the Lord foresees will suffer themselves
to be regenerated, these truths are greatly multiplied, for these
persons are in the affection of knowing truths; but when they come
nearer to the very act of regeneration, they are as it were deprived of
these truths, for these are drawn inward, and then the man appears to be
in desolation; nevertheless as regeneration goes on these truths are
successively let back into the natural, and are there conjoined with
good. But with those who are not being regenerated, that is, who the
Lord foresees will not suffer themselves to be regenerated, truths are
indeed usually multiplied, for these persons are in the affection of
knowing such things for the sake of reputation, honor, and gain; yet
when they advance in years and submit these truths to their own sight,
they then either do not believe them, or they deny them, or they turn
them into falsities; thus with them truths are not withdrawn inward, but
are cast forth, although they still remain in the memory for the sake of
ends in the world, though without life. This state also is called in the
Word "desolation" or "vastation," but differs from the former state in
the desolation of the former being apparent, while the desolation of
this state is absolute; for in the former state man is not deprived of
truths, while in this state he is entirely deprived of them. The
desolation of the former state has been treated of in the internal sense
in this chapter, and is still further treated of in the following one,
and is what is signified by the "famine of seven years." \[3\] This same
desolation is often treated of in other parts of the Word, as in Isaiah:
Awake, awake, O Jerusalem, who hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup
of His anger; two things are befallen thee, who shall bemoan thee?
Wasting and breaking, famine and the sword; how shall I comfort thee?
Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets.
Therefore hear, do this, thou afflicted and drunken one, but not with
wine, behold I have taken out of thy hand the cup of trembling, the
dregs of the cup of My wrath; thou shalt no more drink it again, but I
will put it into the hand of them that make thee sad (Isa. 51:17-23); in
this passage is described the state of desolation in which is the man of
the church who is becoming a church, or who is being regenerated. This
desolation is called "wasting," "breaking," "famine," "sword," and also
the "cup of the anger and wrath of Jehovah," and the "cup of trembling."
The truths of which he is then deprived are the "sons who faint, and lie
at the head of all the streets." That "sons" are truths may be seen
above (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373), and that
"streets" are where truths are (n. 2336); hence "to lie at the head of
all the streets" means that truths appear to be dispersed. It is evident
that this desolation is apparent, and that by it as by temptations
regeneration is effected, for it is said that she "shall no more drink,"
but that "He will put the cup into the hand of them that make her sad."
\[4\] In Ezekiel: Thus hath said the Lord Jehovih, Because they lay
waste and swallow you up on every side, that ye be an inheritance unto
the remains of the nations, therefore ye mountains of Israel hear the
word of the Lord Jehovih: thus hath said the Lord Jehovih to the
mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, and
to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which became
a prey and derision to the remains of the nations that are round about;
I have spoken in My zeal and in My wrath, because ye have borne the
reproach of the nations. Surely the nations that are round about you,
these shall bear their reproach; but ye mountains of Israel shall put
forth your branch and yield your fruit to My people Israel. For behold I
am with you, and I will have regard unto you, that ye may be tilled and
sown; and I will multiply man upon you, the whole house of Israel, and
the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes builded. I will cause you
to dwell according to your times of old, and will do better to you than
at your beginnings (Ezek. 36:3-12); here also the subject treated of is
the desolation that precedes regeneration, the desolation being
signified by the "desolate wastes," and the "cities that are forsaken,
which became a prey and derision"; but regeneration being signified by
"putting forth branch and yielding fruit," by "having regard unto them
that they may be tilled and sown, that man may be multiplied, the cities
inhabited, and the wastes built," and by "causing them to dwell
according to their times of old," and "doing better to them than at
their beginning." \[5\] How the case is in regard to desolation is plain
from those who are in desolation in the other life. They who are in
desolation there are harassed by evil spirits and genii, who pour in
persuasions of evil and falsity until they are almost overwhelmed, the
result being that truths do not appear; but as the time of desolation
draws to a close they are enlightened by light from heaven, and in this
way the evil spirits and genii are driven away, everyone into his own
hell, where they undergo punishments. These are the things signified by
"the cities becoming a prey and derision to the remains of the nations
that are round about," and by "the nations that are round about bearing
their reproach"; and above in Isaiah by "the cup being put into the hand
of them that make her sad"; and also in other passages in Isaiah by the
"waster being laid waste" (Isa. 33:1). Also in Jeremiah: I will visit
upon the wasters, and will make them everlasting desolations (Jer.
25:12). In Isaiah: Thy destroyers will hasten thy sons, and thy wasters
shall go forth from thee. Lift up thine eyes round about and see; all
gather together, they come to thee. For as to thy wastes and the land of
thy destruction, thou shalt be too straitened for an inhabitant, they
that swallow thee up shall be far away (Isa. 49:17-19); \[6\] here
again, and in this whole chapter, the subject treated of is the
desolation of those who are being regenerated, and their regeneration
and fruitfulness after desolation, and lastly the punishment of those
who oppressed them (verse 26). In the same: Woe to thee that layeth
waste when thou art not laid waste! When thou hast ceased to lay waste,
thou shalt be laid waste (Isa. 33:1); meaning that they who vastate are
punished, as above. In the same: Let mine outcasts tarry in thee; Moab,
be thou a covert to them before the waster; for the oppressor hath
ceased, the wasting is ended (Isa. 16:4). Again: The day of Jehovah is
near, it shall come as a wasting from Shaddai (Isa. 13:6); "a wasting
from Shaddai" denotes vastation in temptations; that God as to
temptations was by the ancients called Shaddai, may be seen above (n.
1992, 3667, 4572). \[7\] Again: Then they shall not thirst; He shall
lead them in wastes, He shall cause the waters to flow out of the rock
for them; and He will cleave the rock that the waters flow out (Isa.
48:21); speaking of the state after desolation. Again: Jehovah will
comfort Zion, He will comfort all the wastes thereof, so as to make the
wilderness thereof as Eden, and the solitude thereof as the garden of
Jehovah; gladness and joy shall be found therein, confession and the
voice of a song (Isa. 51:3). Where the subject treated of is the same,
for as before said desolation is for the sake of the end that the man
may be regenerated, that is, that after evils and falsities are
separated, truths may be conjoined with goods, and goods with truths.
The regenerate man as to good is what is compared to "Eden," and as to
truths to the "garden of Jehovah." In David: Jehovah hath made me come
up out of the pit of devastation, out of the mire of clay, and hath set
my feet upon a rock (Ps. 40:2). \[8\] The vastation and desolation of
the man of the church, or of the church in man, was represented by the
captivity of the Jewish people in Babylon; and the raising up of the
church by the return from that captivity, as occasionally described in
Jeremiah, especially in chapter 32, verse 37 to the end; for desolation
is captivity, the man then being kept as it were bound, and therefore by
"those bound," "in prison," and "in the pit," are signified those who
are in desolation (see n. 4728, 4744, 5037, 5038, 5085, 5096). \[9\] The
state of desolation and vastation with those who are not being
regenerated is also occasionally treated of in the Word. In this state
are they who deny truths, or turn them into falsities: this is the state
of the church toward its end, when there is no longer any faith or
charity. Thus in Isaiah: I will make known to you what I will do to My
vineyard, in removing the hedge thereof so that it shall be eaten up, in
breaking through the fence thereof that it may be trodden down. I will
then make it a desolation; it shall not be pruned nor hoed, that there
may come up brier and shrub; nay, I will command the clouds that they
rain no rain upon it (Isa. 5:5-6). In the same: Tell this people,
Hearing hear ye, but understand not; and seeing see ye, but know not.
Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and smear
over their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their
ears, and their heart should understand, and they should be converted,
and be healed. Then said I, Lord, how long? And he said, Until the
cities be devastated that they be without inhabitant, and the houses
that there be no man in them, and the land be reduced into a solitude;
Jehovah will remove man. And the desert shall be multiplied in the midst
of the land; scarcely a tenth part shall be in it any more, and yet it
shall be banished (Isa. 6:9-13). \[10\] In the same: Remains shall
return, the remains of Jacob, unto the mighty God; for a consummation is
decreed, overflowing with righteousness; for a consummation and a decree
shall the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth make in all the earth (Isa. 10:21-23).
Jehovah maketh the earth void, and maketh it empty, and will overturn
the faces thereof. The earth shall be utterly void, the habitable earth
shall mourn, shall be confounded, the world shall languish and be
confounded, a curse shall devour the earth; the new wine shall mourn,
the vine shall languish; that which is left in the city shall be a
waste, the gate shall be smitten even to devastation; breaking, the
earth is broken; breaking, the earth is broken in pieces; moving, the
earth is moved; reeling, the earth reeleth like a drunkard (Isa.
24:1-23). The paths are devastated, the wayfaring man ceaseth, the land
mourneth and languisheth, Lebanon is ashamed and withered away, Sharon
is become like a desert (Isa. 33:8-9). I will make desolate and swallow
up together, I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their
herb (Isa. 42:14-15). \[11\] In Jeremiah: I will give to the curse all
the nations round about, and will make them a desolation, and a
derision, and perpetual wastes; I will take from them the voice of joy
and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
the bride, the voice of the millstones and the light of the candle; that
the whole land may be a desolation and a devastation. It shall come to
pass when seventy years are fulfilled, that I will visit their iniquity
upon the king of Babylon, and upon this nation, and upon the land of the
Chaldees, and will make it everlasting desolations (Jer. 25:9-12 seq.).
Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and
all the cities thereof shall become perpetual wastes; Edom shall be a
desolation, everyone that goeth by it shall be amazed, and shall hiss
over all the plagues thereof (Jer. 49:13-18). In Ezekiel: Thus saith the
Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem concerning the land of Israel, They
shall eat their bread with solicitude, and drink their waters with
amazement; that her land may be devastated from its fullness, because of
the violence of all them that dwell therein; the cities that are
inhabited shall be devastated, and the land shall be made desolate
(Ezek. 12:19-20). \[12\] Again: When I shall make thee a desolate city,
like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall make the deep come
up against thee, and many waters shall cover thee, and I shall make thee
go down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time,
and shall make thee to dwell in the earth of the lower things, for a
desolation from eternity with them that go down into the pit (Ezek.
26:19-21); speaking of Tyre. In Joel: A day of darkness and of thick
darkness, a day of cloud and of obscurity; a fire devoureth before him
and behind him a flame burneth; the land is as the garden of Eden before
him, but behind him a wilderness of waste (Joel 2:2-3). In Zephaniah:
The day of Jehovah is near, a day of wrath is this day, a day of
distress and of cramping, a day of wasteness and devastation, a day of
darkness and thick darkness, a day of cloud and shade; the whole land
shall be devoured by the fire of the zeal of Jehovah, for I will make a
consummation, yea, a speedy one, with all the inhabitants of the land
(Zeph. 1:14-18). In Matthew: When ye shall see the abomination of
desolation, foretold by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place,
then let them that are in Judea flee into the mountains (Matt. 24:15-16;
Mark 13:14; Dan. 9:27; 12:10-12). From these passages it is evident that
desolation is the apparent deprivation of truth with those who are being
regenerated, but is the absolute deprivation of it with those who are
not being regenerated.

Continuation concerning the correspondence with the Grand Man; here
concerning the correspondence of the interior viscera therewith. The
subject treated of at the close of the preceding chapter was the
correspondence of some of the interior viscera of the body with the
Grand Man, namely, of the liver, the pancreas, the stomach, and some
others. The subject is now continued with the correspondence therewith
of the peritoneum, the kidneys, the ureters, the bladder, and also of
the intestines; for whatever is in man, both what is in the external man
and what is in the internal, has a correspondence with the Grand Man.
Without correspondence therewith (that is, with heaven, or what is the
same, with the spiritual world) nothing would ever come into existence
and subsist, for the reason that it would have no connection with what
is prior to itself, nor consequently with the First, that is, with the
Lord. What is unconnected, and thus independent, cannot subsist for a
single moment; for its subsistence is from its connection with that from
which is all existence, and its dependence upon it, because subsistence
is a perpetual coming into existence. \[2\] Hence it is that not only
all things in general and particular in man correspond, but also all and
each in the universe. The sun itself corresponds, and also the moon; for
in heaven the Lord is the Sun, and also the Moon. The sun's flame and
heat, and also its light, correspond; for it is the Lord's love toward
the whole human race to which the flame and heat correspond, and the
Divine truth to which the light corresponds. The very stars correspond,
the societies of heaven and their habitations being what they have
correspondence with; not that they are in the stars, but that they are
in a similar order. Whatever appears under the sun corresponds, as all
and each of the subjects in the animal kingdom, and also all and each of
the subjects in the vegetable kingdom; and unless there were an influx
from the spiritual world into all and each, they would instantly sink
down and shrivel away. This has been granted me to know by much
experience; for I have been shown with what things in the spiritual
world many things in the animal kingdom, and many more in the vegetable
kingdom, correspond, and also that without influx they would by no means
subsist; for when that which is prior is taken away, that which is
posterior necessarily falls, and the same is the case when what is prior
is separated from what is posterior. As there is an especial
correspondence of man with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, a
man appears in the other life in the light of heaven according to the
quality of his correspondence. Hence the angels appear in ineffable
brightness and beauty, but the infernals in inexpressible blackness and
deformity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5378.">5378.</span></span>

Some spirits came to me, but were silent. After a while, however, they
spoke, yet not as many, but all as one. I noticed from their speech that
they were such that they desired to know everything, and were eager to
explain everything, and in this way to confirm themselves that a thing
is so. They were modest, and said that they do nothing of themselves,
but from others, although it appears to be from them. They were then
infested by others, who were said to be those who constitute the
province of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder, and whom they answered
modestly; yet these continued to infest and assail them, for such is the
nature of the kidney spirits. And as they could not prevail against them
by their modesty, they resorted to what was according to their nature,
namely, to enlarging themselves, and thereby causing terror. Thereupon
they seemed to become great, but only as a one, who so swelled in
stature, that like Atlas he seemed to reach to heaven; a spear appeared
in his hand, but still he did not wish to do any harm beyond exciting
terror. In consequence of this the kidney spirits fled away, and then
there appeared one who pursued them in their flight, and another who
flew in front between the feet of that great one; moreover, that great
one seemed to have wooden shoes, which he threw at the kidney spirits.
\[2\] Angels told me that those modest spirits who made themselves great
were those who bear relation to the peritoneum. The peritoneum is the
common membrane that surrounds and encloses all the viscera of the
abdomen, as the pleura does all the viscera of the chest; and as it is
so extensive, and relatively large, and also expansible, the spirits who
belong to this province, when infested by others, are allowed to present
themselves great in appearance, and at the same time to strike with
terror, especially in the case of those who constitute the province of
the kidneys, ureters, and bladder; for these viscera or vessels lie in
the folds of the peritoneum, and are constrained by it. The wooden shoes
represented the lowest natural things, such as the kidneys, ureters, and
bladder absorb and carry off. (That shoes are the lowest natural things
may be seen n. 259, 4938-4952.) And in saying that they do nothing of
themselves, but from others, in this respect also these spirits bear
relation to the peritoneum, which is also of such a nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5379.">5379.</span></span>

It was also representatively shown what happens when they who constitute
the colon intestine infest those who are in the province of the
peritoneum. They who constitute the colon intestine become puffed up,
like the colon with its wind, and when they desired to assail those of
the peritoneum, it appeared as if a wall were thrown in the way; and
when they attempted to overturn the wall, there always rose up a new
wall. In this manner they were kept away from them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5380.">5380.</span></span>

It is known that there are secretions and excretions, in a series, from
the kidneys down to the bladder. In the first of the series are the
kidneys, in the middle of it are the ureters, and in the last is the
bladder. They who constitute these provinces in the Grand Man are in
like manner in a series; and although they are of one genus, they differ
as do the species of this genus. They speak with a raucous voice as if
cracked, and desire to introduce themselves into the body; but this is
only an endeavor. Their situation in respect to the human body is as
follows. They who relate to the kidneys are on the left side close to
the body under the elbow; they who relate to the ureters are to the left
farther off from the body; and they who relate to the bladder are still
farther away. Together they form almost a parabola from the left side
toward the front; for in this way they project themselves from the left
toward the front; thus in a rather long course. This is one common way
to the hells, the other is through the intestines, for both these ways
end in the hells; for they who are in the hells correspond to such
things as are excreted by the intestines and the bladder, the falsities
and evils in which they are being nothing but urine and excrement in a
spiritual sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5381.">5381.</span></span>

They who constitute the province of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder in
the Grand Man, are of such a disposition that they desire nothing more
than to explore and to search out the quality of others; and there are
some of them who are eager to chastise and to punish, provided there is
some justice in the case. The functions of the kidneys, ureters, and
bladder are of this kind; for they explore the blood thrown into them to
see whether there is any useless and hurtful serum in it, which they
separate from what is useful, and then correct it; for they drive it
down toward lower positions, and on the way and afterward they agitate
it in various ways. These are the functions of those who constitute the
province of the parts in question. But the spirits and societies of
spirits to which the urine itself, especially fetid urine, corresponds,
are infernal; for as soon as the urine is separated from the blood,
although it is in the little tubes of the kidneys or within the bladder,
still it is out of the body; for what has been separated no longer
circulates in the body, and therefore does not contribute anything to
the coming into existence and subsistence of its parts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5382.">5382.</span></span>

I have often observed that they who constitute the province of the
kidneys and ureters are quick to explore or search out the quality of
others-what they think and what they will-and that they are in the
cupidity of finding occasions, and making out others to be guilty of
some fault, chiefly in order to be able to chastise them, and I have
talked with them about this cupidity and this intention. Many of this
kind in the world had been judges, who rejoiced at heart when they found
an occasion which they believed just, to fine, chastise, and punish. The
operation of such is felt in the region at the back where are the
kidneys, ureters, and bladder. They who belong to the bladder stretch
out toward gehenna, where some of them sit as it were in judgment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5383.">5383.</span></span>

The methods by which they explore or search out the dispositions of
others are very numerous; but I may adduce only the following one. They
lead other spirits to speak (which in the other life is done by an
influx that cannot be intelligibly described), and if the speech they
have thus led follows readily they judge thereby of the character of the
spirits. They also lead into a state of affection. But they who explore
in this way are among the grosser of them. Others use other methods.
There are some of them who on approaching at once perceive another's
thoughts, desires, and acts, and also anything he has done that pains
him to think of: this they seize upon, and also condemn, if they think
there is just cause. It is one of the wonders of the other
life-incredible to almost all in this world-that as soon as any spirit
comes to another, and especially when he comes to a man, he instantly
knows the other's thoughts and affections and what he has been doing,
thus all his present state, just as if he had been a long time with
him-so perfect is the communication. But there are differences in these
perceptions, some spirits perceiving interior things, and others
perceiving only exterior ones. These latter, if they are in the cupidity
of knowing, explore the interiors of others by various methods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5384.">5384.</span></span>

The methods by which those chastise who constitute the province of the
kidneys, ureters, and bladder in the Grand Man, are also various; for
the most part they take away joyous and glad things, and induce such as
are joyless and sad. By this cupidity these spirits communicate with the
hells; but by the justness of the cause, which they inquire into before
chastising, they communicate with heaven. For this reason they are kept
in this province.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5385.">5385.</span></span>

From all this it is evident what is signified by its being said in the
Word, that "Jehovah tries and searches the reins and the heart," and
that the "reins chasten," as in Jeremiah: Jehovah trieth the reins and
the heart (Jer. 11:20). In the same: Jehovah that trieth the righteous,
and seeth the reins and the heart (Jer. 20:12). In David: The just God
trieth the hearts and reins (Ps. 7:9). Again: O Jehovah explore my reins
and my heart (Ps. 26:2). Again: Jehovah Thou hast possessed my reins
(Ps. 139:13). In Revelation: I am He that searcheth the reins and the
heart (Rev. 2:23). In these passages spiritual things are signified by
the "reins" \[or "kidneys"\] and celestial things by the "heart;" that
is, the things which are of truth are signified by the "reins," and
those which are of good by the "heart." The reason of this is that the
kidneys purify the serum, and the heart purifies the blood itself; hence
by "trying, exploring, and searching the reins," is signified to try,
explore, and search out the quantity and quality of truth, or the
quantity and quality of faith, in man. That this is the signification is
plain also in Jeremiah: Jehovah Thou art near in their mouth, but far
from their reins (Jer. 12:2); and in David: Jehovah, behold Thou
desirest truth in the reins (Ps. 51:6). That "chastening" is attributed
to the kidneys is clear also in David: My reins chasten me in the night
seasons (Ps. 16:7).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5386.">5386.</span></span>

There are also secretories and excretories in other parts of the body:
in the brain there are ventricles and mammillary processes which carry
off the phlegmy substances there; and there are also little glands
everywhere, as the mucous and salivary glands in the head, and very many
others in the body, and myriads next the cuticles, by which the sweat
and more subtle used-up matters are thrown off. To these correspond in
the spiritual world-to speak generally-tenacities of opinions, and also
conscientious scruples in unimportant matters. Some of these spirits
appear at a moderate distance above the head, and are such that they
raise scruples in matters where there need be none; hence because they
burden the consciences of the simple, they are called
conscience-mongers. What true conscience is, they know not, because they
make everything that comes up a matter of conscience; for when any
scruple or doubt is suggested, if the mind is anxious and dwells on it,
there are never wanting things to strengthen the doubt and make it
burdensome. When such spirits are present they also induce a sensible
anxiety in the part of the abdomen immediately under the diaphragm. They
are also present with man in temptations. I have talked with them, and
noticed that they have not enough extension of thought to acquiesce in
the more useful and necessary things; for they were unable to give
attention to reasons, being tenaciously set in their own opinion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5387.">5387.</span></span>

They who correspond to the urine itself however are infernal; for as
before said the urine is out of the body, because already separated from
the blood, and in itself is nothing but unclean and used-up serum, which
is thrown down. I may relate the following things concerning them. A
certain spirit was perceived at first as if within the body, but
presently below at the right; and when he stood there, he was invisible,
having the power to render himself so by art. When he was questioned, he
made no reply whatever. It was said by others that in the life of the
body he had been engaged in piratical pursuits; for in the other life it
is plainly perceived, from the sphere of the life's affections and
thoughts, who and of what quality everyone has been, because his life
remains. \[2\] He changed his place, appearing now at the right, and now
at the left. I saw that he did this for fear of its being known who he
was, and of being forced to make some confession. It was said by other
spirits that such are most timorous at the least sign of danger, and
most courageous when there is nothing to fear; and that they are the
opposite of those to whom the discharge of the urine corresponds, and
strive in every way to injure this. And that I might have no doubt, it
was shown me by experience. When they who correspond to the discharge of
the urine withdrew a little, and that pirate stood by, the discharge was
completely stopped, and effort was attended with danger; but when they
were recalled, the emission of the urine was intensified according to
their presence. \[3\] He afterward confessed that he had been a pirate,
and said that he could then artfully hide himself, and by cunning and
activity elude his pursuers; and that he now loves urinous filth much
more than any clear water, and that the fetid smell of urine is what
most delights him, so much so that he wishes to have his abode in pools,
or even in casks, of fetid urine. It was shown also what sort of face he
had; it was not really a face, but something with a black beard in place
of one. \[4\] Afterward other pirates also, who were not so active, were
sent for, who also spoke but little, and strange to say gnashed their
teeth. They too said that they love urine more than all other liquids,
and feculent urine the most. These, however, had not something bearded
for a face, as the first had, but a kind of dreadful grate of teeth; for
the beard and teeth signify the lowest natural things. Their being
without a face signifies that they have no rational life, because when
no face appears it is a sign that there is no correspondence of the
interiors with the Grand Man; for in the other life everyone appears in
the light of heaven in accordance with his correspondence, and hence the
infernals appear in horrible deformity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5388.">5388.</span></span>

A certain spirit was with me, talking with me, who in the life of the
body had had no faith, and had not believed in any life after death; he
also had been one of the dexterous. He could captivate the minds of
others by flattery and by giving assent, on which account his quality
was not apparent at first from his discourse; he could also talk with
volubility, like a stream, and like a good spirit. But his quality was
first known by his not liking to speak about matters of faith and
charity, for then he could not follow in thought, but drew back; and it
was afterward perceived from several indications that he had been an
assentor for the purpose of deceiving. For assentations are according to
ends; if the end is friendship, or the pleasure of conversation, or the
like, or even rightful gain, there is not so much harm in it; but if the
end is to elicit secrets, and thereby bind another to evil services-in
general if the end is to do harm-it is evil. Such was the end this
spirit had in view, and he was also in opposition to those who are in
the province of the kidneys and ureters. He too said that he loved the
smell of urine above all other odors; and he caused a painful
contraction or cramp in the lower region of the belly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5389.">5389.</span></span>

There are troops of spirits who wander about, and by turns come back to
the same places. Evil spirits greatly fear them, for they torment them
with a certain kind of torture. I was informed that they correspond to
the fundus or upper part of the bladder in general, and to the muscular
ligaments converging therefrom toward the sphincter, where the urine is
driven out by a kind of contortion. These spirits apply themselves to
the part of the back where is the cauda equina. Their mode of operating
is by quick movements to and fro which no one can stop. It is a method
of constriction and restriction directed upward, and pointed in the form
of a cone. The evil spirits who are thrown within this cone, especially
at the upper part, are miserably tormented by being twisted to and fro.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5390.">5390.</span></span>

There are other spirits also who correspond to unclean excretions,
namely, such as in the world have been tenacious of revenge: these
appeared to me in front to the left. To these unclean excretions also
correspond those who debase spiritual things to unclean earthly ones.
Such spirits came to me and brought with them filthy thoughts, from
which they spoke filthy things, and also warped clean things to unclean
things, and turned them into such. Many of this kind had belonged to the
lowest orders, and some to people of higher station in the world, who
during their bodily life had not indeed so spoken in company, but still
had so thought; for they had refrained from speaking as they thought,
lest they should come to shame, and lose friendship, gain, and honor.
Nevertheless, among their like, when in freedom, their conversation had
been like that of the lowest orders, and even fouler, because they
possessed a certain intellectual capacity which they misused to defile
even the holy things of the Word and of doctrine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5391.">5391.</span></span>

There are also kidneys called the subsidiary kidneys, or renal capsules.
Their function is to secrete not so much the serum as the blood itself,
and to transmit the purer blood toward the heart by a short circuit, and
thus prevent the spermatic vessels, which are near, from carrying off
all the purer blood. But these organs perform their main work in
embryos, and also in newborn infants. It is chaste virgins who
constitute this province in the Grand Man: prone to anxieties, and
fearful of being disturbed, they lie quiet at the lower left side of the
body. If there is any thought about heaven, or about a change of their
state, they become anxious and sigh, as I have several times been given
plainly to feel. When my thoughts were led to infants, they felt great
comfort and inward joy, which they frankly confessed; and when there was
any thought that had nothing heavenly in it, they were distressed. Their
anxiety comes chiefly from their being of such a nature that they keep
their thoughts fixed on one subject, and do not dispel anxious feelings
by variety. The reason why they belong to this province is that in this
way they keep another's lower mind fixed on certain thoughts, the result
being that such things arise and show themselves as cohere in a series,
and as are to be drawn away, or from which the man is to be purified. In
this way also interior things lie in plainer view to the angels; for
when such things as obscure and turn away the thoughts are removed,
there results a clearer insight and influx.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5392.">5392.</span></span>

Who they are that constitute the province of the intestines in the Grand
Man, may be seen to some extent from those who relate to the stomach;
for the intestines are continued from the stomach, and the functions of
the stomach become there more vigorous and harsh down to the last
intestines, which are the colon and rectum; for which reason they who
are in these are near the hells which are called excremental. In the
region of the stomach and intestines are they who are in the earth of
lower things, who, because they have brought with them from the world
unclean things that cling to their thoughts and affections, are kept
there for some time, until such things have been wiped away, that is,
cast to the sides; after this is done, they can be taken up into heaven.
They who are there are not as yet in the Grand Man; for they are like
food taken into the stomach, which is not admitted into the blood, and
thus into the body, until it has been cleared of dregs. They who have
been defiled with more earthly dregs are under these in the region of
the intestines; but the excrements themselves that are discharged
correspond to the hells called the excremental hells.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5393.">5393.</span></span>

It is well known that the colon intestine spreads out wide, and so do
those who are in this province. They spread out in front toward the left
in a curved line, leading to a hell. In that hell are they who have been
merciless, and who without conscience have desired to destroy mankind,
namely, to kill and to plunder them without respect or distinction of
persons, whether they resist or not, and whether they are men or women.
Of such a ferocious disposition are a great part of the soldiery and
their officers, who, not in battle but after it, rage ferociously
against the conquered and unarmed, and kill and despoil them in their
fury. I have conversed with angels about such men, as to what they are
when left to themselves and permitted to act without law and with
freedom, how they are much more savage than the worst wild beasts, which
do not so rush to the destruction of their own species, but merely
defend themselves and appease their hunger with what is allotted them
for food, and when sated do no such things. It is otherwise with the man
who acts thus from cruelty and ferocity. The angels were horrified that
mankind should be of such a nature as to first begin to rejoice at heart
and be elated in mind when they see the whole field strewn with fallen
troops, and reeking with blood-not rejoicing that their country has been
freed, but only in being themselves lauded as great men and heroes. And
yet they call themselves Christians, and even believe that they will
come into heaven, where there is nothing but peace, mercy, and charity.
Such are in the hell of the colon and rectum. But those of them in whom
there had been any humanity appear in front to the left in a curved
line, within a kind of wall; yet there is still much of the love of self
in them. If any of these have a regard for what is good, this is
sometimes represented by little stars almost fiery, but not of white
light. A wall appeared to me as it were of plaster with molded figures,
near the left elbow, which wall became more extended and at the same
time higher, the upper part verging in color to sky-blue; and I was told
that this was a representative of some spirits of this kind who were
better.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5394.">5394.</span></span>

They who have been cruel and adulterers, in the other life love nothing
so well as filth and excrements, the stenches from such things being
most sweet and delightful to them, and being preferred by them to all
other delights. The reason is that these things correspond. These hells
are partly under the buttocks, partly under the right foot, and partly
deep down in front. These are the hells into which the way by the rectum
intestine leads. A certain spirit being conveyed thither, and speaking
with me therefrom, said that nothing but privies were to be seen there.
They who were in the place spoke to him, and led him to various privies,
which were very numerous there. He was afterward led to another place a
little to the left; and when he was there, he said that a most dreadful
stench exhaled from the caverns there, and that he could not stir a step
without almost falling into some cavern. A cadaverous stench also was
exhaled from the caverns, and the reason was that they who were there
were cruel and deceitful, to whom a cadaverous stench is most
delightful. But these will be described in the following pages, when I
come to speak of the hells, and specifically of the excremental and
cadaverous hells.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5395.">5395.</span></span>

There are some who live not for the sake of any use to their country or
to its communities, but with a view to live for themselves, taking no
delight in public employments, but only in being honored and courted (to
which end they indeed seek office); and also in eating, drinking, making
merry and conversing with no other end than pleasure. Such in the other
life cannot possibly be in the company of good spirits, still less in
that of angels; for with these the use causes the delight, and according
to the uses is the amount and quality of the delight. For the Lord's
kingdom is nothing but a kingdom of uses; and if in an earthly kingdom
everyone is valued and honored according to his use, how much more is
this the case in the heavenly kingdom! They who have lived solely for
themselves and pleasure, without any useful end, are also under the
buttocks, and pass their time in things unclean in accordance with the
kinds of their pleasures and their ends.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5396.">5396.</span></span>

By way of Appendix I may relate what follows. There was a numerous crowd
of spirits about me that was heard like something devoid of order
flowing. They were complaining that everything was going to destruction;
for in that crowd nothing appeared consociated, and this made them fear
destruction. They also supposed that it would be total, as is the case
when such things happen. But in the midst of them I perceived a soft
sound, angelically sweet, having nothing in it that was out of order.
Angelic choirs were there within, and the crowd of spirits devoid of
order was without. This angelic strain continued a long time; and I was
told that by it was represented how the Lord rules confused and
disorderly things which are without from what is peaceful in the midst,
by which the disorderly things in the circumference are brought back
into order, each from the error of its own nature. Genesis 42 1. And
Jacob saw that there was produce in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons,
Why do ye look at one another? 2. And he said, Behold I have heard that
there is produce in Egypt; get you down thither, and buy for us from
thence; and we shall live, and not die. 3. And Joseph's ten brethren
went down to buy corn from Egypt. 4. And Benjamin, Joseph's brother,
Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Peradventure mischief may
befall him. 5. And the sons of Israel came to buy in the midst of those
that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 6. And Joseph he
was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of
the land; and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him
with their faces to the earth. 7. And Joseph saw his brethren, and he
knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke hard things
with them; and he said unto them, Whence came ye? And they said, From
the land of Canaan to buy food. 8. And Joseph knew his brethren; but
they knew not him. 9. And Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamed
of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the
land ye are come. 10. And they said unto him, Nay my lord, but to buy
food are thy servants come. 11. We are all one man's sons; we are
upright; thy servants are no spies. 12. And he said unto them, Nay, but
to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 13. And they said, We thy
servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan;
and behold the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. 14.
And Joseph said unto them, This is it that I spoke unto you, saying, ye
are spies. 15. Hereby ye shall be proved; by the life of Pharaoh ye
shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 16.
Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and ye shall be bound,
and your words shall be proved, whether there be truth with you; or else
by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. 17. And he shut them up in
custody three days. 18. And Joseph said unto them in the third day, This
do, and live; I fear God. 19. If ye be upright, let one of your brethren
be bound in the house of your custody; and go ye, bring produce for the
famine of your houses. 20. And bring your youngest brother unto me; and
your words shall be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 21.
And they said a man to his brother, We are surely guilty concerning our
brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us,
and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come unto us. 22. And
Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin
against the child; and ye would not hearken? Moreover, behold his blood
is searched for. 23. And they knew not that Joseph heard them; for there
was an interpreter between them. 24. And he turned about from upon them,
and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke unto them, and took Simeon
from them, and bound him before their eyes. 25. And Joseph commanded,
and they filled their vessels with corn, and to restore their silver
everyone's into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and he
did thus to them. 26. And they lifted their produce upon their asses,
and went thence. 27. And one opened his sack to give his ass provender
in the inn, and he saw his silver; and behold it was in the mouth of his
bag. 28. And he said unto his brethren, My silver is restored, and lo it
is even in my bag; and their heart went forth, and they trembled a man
to his brother, saying, What is this that God hath done to us? 29. And
they came unto Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told him
all that had befallen them, saying, 30. The man, the lord of the land,
spoke hard things with us, and took us for spies of the land. 31. And we
said unto him, We are upright; we are no spies. 32. We are twelve
brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day
with our father in the land of Canaan. 33. And the man, the lord of the
land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are upright; let one of
your brethren remain with me, and take for the famine of your houses,
and go. 34. And bring your youngest brother unto me, then shall I know
that ye are no spies, but that ye are upright; I will give you your
brother, and ye shall go about trading in the land. 35. And it came to
pass as they emptied their sacks, and behold everyone's bundle of silver
was in his sack; and they saw the bundles of their silver, they and
their father, and they were afraid. 36. And Jacob their father said unto
them, Me have ye bereaved, Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will
take Benjamin; all these things be come upon me. 37. And Reuben spoke
unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons if I bring him not to thee;
give him upon my hand, and I will bring him unto thee again. 38. And he
said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he
only is left; and mischief will befall him in the way wherein ye shall
go, and ye will make my gray hairs go down in sorrow to the grave.
5396a. The Contents. In the latter part of the last chapter the subject
treated of was the influx and conjunction of the celestial of the
spiritual with the memory-knowledges in the natural; and now the subject
treated of is the influx and conjunction of the celestial of the
spiritual with the truths of faith therein which are of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5397.">5397.</span></span>

First is described the endeavor to appropriate these truths by means of
the memory-knowledges of the church, which are "Egypt," and without the
intermediate, which is "Benjamin," together with truth from the Divine,
which is "Joseph;" but in vain, wherefore they were sent back and some
good of natural truth was given freely.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5398.">5398.</span></span>

The Internal Sense. In this chapter and in those which follow about
Joseph and the sons of Jacob, in the internal sense is described the
regeneration of the natural as to the truths and goods of the
church-that this is not effected by means of memory-knowledges, but by
influx from the Divine. At the present day they who are of the church
know so little about regeneration that it is scarcely anything. They do
not even know that regeneration goes on through the whole course of life
of one who is being regenerated, and that it is continued in the other
life; or that the arcana of regeneration are so innumerable that
scarcely a ten thousandth part of them can be known by the angels, and
that those they do know are what effect their intelligence and wisdom.
The reason why they who are of the church at this day know so little
about regeneration is that they talk so much about remission of sins and
about justification, and believe that sins are remitted in a moment, and
some that they are wiped away like filth from the body by water, and
that man is justified by faith alone or by the confidence of a single
moment. The reason why the men of the church so believe is that they do
not know what sin or evil is. If they knew this, they would know that
sins can by no means be wiped away from anyone, but that when the man is
kept in good by the Lord they are separated or rejected to the sides so
as not to rise up, and that this cannot be effected unless evil is
continually cast out, and this by means which are unlimited in number,
and for the most part unutterable. \[2\] Those in the other life who
have brought with them the opinion that man is justified in a moment by
faith, and wholly cleansed from sins, are astounded when they see that
regeneration is effected by means unlimited in number and unutterable,
and they then laugh at and call insane the ignorance in which they had
been in the world in regard to the instantaneous remission of sins and
justification. They are sometimes told that the Lord remits the sins of
those who desire it from the heart; yet still they are not thereby
separated from the diabolical crew, to whom they are held fast by the
evils that attend their life, which they have with them complete. They
then learn by experience that to be separated from the hells is to be
separated from sins, and that this cannot be done except by thousands
upon thousands of ways known to the Lord only, and this-if you will
believe it-in a continual succession to eternity. For man is so evil
that he cannot to eternity be fully delivered from even one sin, but can
only by the mercy of the Lord (if he has received it) be withheld from
sin, and kept in good. \[3\] In what manner therefore man receives new
life and is regenerated, is contained in the sanctuary of the Word, that
is, in its internal sense, chiefly to the end that when the Word is
being read by man the angels may thereby be in their happiness of
wisdom, and also be at the same time in the delight of serving as means.
In this and the following chapters about Joseph's brethren, the subject
treated of in the supreme internal sense is the glorification of the
Lord's natural, and in the representative sense, the regeneration of the
natural in man by the Lord, here as to the truths of the church therein.

Verses 1-5. And Jacob saw that there was produce in Egypt, and Jacob
said to his sons, Why do ye look at one another? And he said, Behold I
have heard that there is produce in Egypt; get you down thither, and buy
for us from thence; and we shall live, and not die. And Joseph's ten
brethren went down to buy corn from Egypt. And Benjamin, Joseph's
brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Peradventure
mischief may befall him. And the sons of Israel came to buy in the midst
of those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan. "And Jacob
saw," signifies the things which are of faith ("Jacob" signifies the
natural as to the truth which is of the church); "that there was produce
in Egypt," signifies a disposition to procure truths by means of
memory-knowledges, which are "Egypt;" "and Jacob said to his sons,"
signifies perception regarding truths in general; "Why do ye look at one
another?" signifies why did they hesitate; "and he said, Behold I have
heard that there is produce in Egypt," signifies that truths can be
procured by means of memory-knowledges; "get you down thither, and buy
for us from thence," signifies appropriation by means of them; "and we
shall live, and not die," signifies spiritual life thereby; "and they
went down," signifies endeavor and act; "Joseph's ten brethren,"
signifies such truths of the church as corresponded; "to buy corn from
Egypt," signifies to appropriate to themselves the good of truth by
means of memory-knowledges; "but Benjamin, Joseph's brother," signifies
the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediate; "Jacob sent
not with his brethren," signifies that they were without this
intermediate; "for he said, Peradventure mischief may befall him,"
signifies that without the celestial of the spiritual, which is
"Joseph," it would perish; "and the sons of Israel came to buy in the
midst of those that came," signifies that it desired that spiritual
truths, like all others, should be procured by means of
memory-knowledges; "for the famine was in the land of Canaan," signifies
that there was desolation as to the things of the church in the natural.

And he saw. That this signifies the things which are of faith, is
evident from the signification of "seeing," as being the things which
are of faith (see n. 897, 2325, 2807, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421). For
spiritual sight abstracted from such things as are of the world is
nothing else than a perception of truth, or of the things of faith; and
therefore in the internal sense nothing else is signified by "seeing."
For the internal sense comes forth when the things of the world are
removed, because the internal sense relates to such things as are of
heaven. The light of heaven, by which is sight there, is Divine truth
from the Lord, which appears before the eyes of the angels as light, a
thousand times brighter than the midday light in the world; and as this
light has life in it, therefore at the same time that it illumines the
eyesight of the angels, it illumines also the sight of their
understanding, and causes a perception of truth in accordance with the
amount and quality of the good in which they are. As in the internal
sense of this chapter are described the things of faith, or the truths
of the church, therefore at the very beginning of the chapter it is said
that "he saw;" and by his "seeing" are signified the things of faith.
