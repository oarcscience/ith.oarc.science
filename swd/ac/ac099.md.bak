### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="4901.">4901.</span></span>

And it came to pass about three months after. That this signifies a new
state, is evident from the signification of "three" as being what is
complete, and hence the last and the first together, or the end and the
beginning together (see n. 1825, 2788, 4495); and from the signification
of "month" as being state (n. 3814). For in the internal sense all
periods of time signify states, as hour, day, week, month, year, age;
and also the lesser divisions of time, as noon, evening, night, and
morning, which are times of the day; and as summer, autumn, winter, and
spring, which are times of the year; and also the several periods of
life, as infancy and childhood, youth, adult age, and old age; all of
which times, with others, signify states. What states are may be seen
above (n. 4850). \[2\] That times signify states is because times do not
exist in the other life. The progression of the life of spirits and
angels indeed appears as in time; but they have no thought from times,
as men in the world have; their thought is from states of the life, and
this without notion of times. The reason of this is that the
progressions of their life are not distinguished into different ages,
for there they do not grow old, and there are no days or years, because
their sun, which is the Lord, is always rising and never sets. Hence no
notion of time enters their thoughts, but only a notion of state and its
progressions - notions being taken from the things that are and exist
before the senses. \[3\] These things must needs seem paradoxical, but
only for the reason that man in every idea of his thought has somewhat
adjoined from time and space. From this source are his memory and
recollection, and also his lower thought, the ideas of which are called
material. But that memory out of which comes such ideas is quiescent in
the other life. They who are in that life are in interior memory, and in
the ideas of its thought; and thought from this latter memory has not
times and spaces adjoined to it, but states and their progressions
instead. Hence also it is that they correspond, and in consequence of
such correspondence times in the Word signify states. (That man has an
exterior memory which is proper to him in the body, and also an interior
memory which is proper to his spirit, may be seen above, n. 2469-2494.)
\[4\] That by "about three months after" is signified a new state, is
because by "months," into which also times in the world are
distinguished, is signified state, and by "three" is signified the last
and the first together, or the end and the beginning together, as said
above. Because in the spiritual world there is a continual progression
of states from one into another, and consequently in the last or end of
every state there is a first or beginning, hence what is continuous,
therefore by the words "about three months after" is signified a new
state. It is similar also in the church, which is the spiritual world or
the Lord's kingdom on earth, the last of the church with one nation
being always the first of the church with another. As the last is thus
continued into the first, it is several times said of the Lord that He
is the Last and the First (as in Isaiah 41:4; 44:6; Rev. 21:6; 22:13);
and thereby in the relative sense is signified what is perpetual, and in
the supreme sense what is eternal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4902.">4902.</span></span>

And it was told Judah. That this signifies communication, is evident
from the signification of "being told," as being communication, of which
above (n. 4856).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4903.">4903.</span></span>

Saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot. That this
signifies perception then that it is false that anything conjugial
exists between them, is evident from the signification of "saying" in
the historic parts of the Word, as being perception, of which above (n.
4892); from the signification of "playing the harlot," as being falsity
(n. 2466, 2729, 3399, 4865); from the representation of Tamar, as being
the internal of the representative church, of which also above (n.
4864); and from the signification of "daughter-in-law" as being the
truth of the church (n. 4843, 4869). Hence by the words "saying, Tamar
thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot" is signified perception then
that it is false that anything conjugial exists between them. How these
things stand in the series may be seen above (n. 4864-4866), namely,
that the Jewish nation from their religiosity perceived the internal of
the church simply as a harlot, and its preaching and consequent life
simply as whoredom. For they who are in the external alone without the
internal do not otherwise regard the internal of the church, since they
call that false which is true, and that true which is false. The reason
is that no one can see from the external alone whether a thing be false
or true, but only from the internal. There must be an internal sight
which shall judge of those things which are of external sight, and in
order to do this the internal sight must be wholly in the light of
heaven; and it is not in the light of heaven unless it is in faith in
the Lord, and from this faith reads the Word. \[2\] That the Jewish
nation were in the external without the internal, and therefore believed
truth to be falsity, and falsity truth, is evident from their teaching
that it was allowable to hate an enemy; and also from their life in that
they hated all who were not of their religiosity. They even believed
that they were pleasing and serving Jehovah when they treated the
Gentiles with barbarity and cruelty, exposing their bodies after they
had been slain to be devoured by birds and wild beasts, cutting them in
two with saws while alive, lacerating them with harrows and axes of
iron, and making them pass through the brick-kiln (2 Sam. 12:31).
Moreover, it was in accordance with their teachings to treat in almost
the same way a companion who for any cause was declared an enemy. Thus
it is plainly evident that there was nothing internal in their
religiosity. If anyone had then said to them that such things are
contrary to the internal of the church, they would have replied that
this was false. That they were merely in externals, were wholly ignorant
of what the internal is, and led a life contrary to the internal, is
plain also from what the Lord teaches in Matthew, chapter 5, verses 21
to 48.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4904.">4904.</span></span>

And Moreover, behold she is with child to whoredoms. That this
signifies, and that anything can be produced thence, is evident from the
signification of "carrying in the womb" or "being with child," as being
to produce something, for by "seed" is signified the truth of faith, and
by "conception" its reception, whence by "carrying in the womb" or
"being with child" is signified producing; and from the signification of
"whoredom," as being falsity, namely, from their religiosity, as above
(n. 4903). From this it is evident that by these words, "saying, Tamar
thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold, she is
with child to whoredoms" is signified a perception that it is false that
anything conjugial exists between them, and that anything can be
produced thence. To be produced, when predicated of the church, denotes
the good which is produced by means of truth; and it is produced when
truth passes through the understanding into the will, and from the will
into act. For as before said, the "seed" is the truth of faith, and
"conception" is reception, and reception is effected when truth which is
of the understanding passes into good which is of the will, or when
truth which is of faith passes into good which is of charity; and when
it is in the will, it is in its womb, and is then first produced; and
when man is in good in act, that is, when he produces good from the
will, thus from delight and freedom, it then goes forth from the womb or
is born-which also is meant by being reborn or regenerated. From this it
is evident what is signified in the spiritual sense by "being with
child." Here however the contrary is signified-that nothing of good
could be produced; for that nation which is here described was not in
any truth, because not in any internal of the church, but in falsity.
\[2\] That to be reborn or regenerated, that is, to be made an internal
man, was a thing wholly unknown to that nation, and consequently that it
seemed to them as a harlot is evident from Nicodemus, who was a ruler of
the Jews (John 3:1-13), for he said, "How can a man be born when he is
old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb?" (verse 4). It
is known that the Lord opened the internal things of His kingdom and
church, and yet these internal things were known to the ancients-as,
that man should be reborn in order to enter into life; and that he
should then put off the old man, that is, the loves of self and of the
world with their evil desires, and should put on the new, that is, love
toward the neighbor and to God; and also that heaven was in the
regenerate man-besides other internal things. These things were known to
those who belonged to the Ancient Church, but they were led to them by
external things which were representative. But as such things were
entirely lost with the Jewish nation, the Lord taught them, but
abolished the representatives themselves, because most of these had
respect to Himself; for the image must vanish when the form itself
appears. \[3\] He therefore set up a new church, which should not like
the former be led by representatives to internal things, but should know
them without representatives; and He enjoined instead only a few
external observances, namely, baptism and the Holy Supper-baptism, that
by it regeneration might be remembered; and the Holy Supper, that by it
might be remembered the Lord, and His love toward the whole human race,
and the reciprocal love of man to Him. These things are said that it may
be known that the internal things of the church, which the Lord taught,
were known to the ancients, but were so entirely lost with the Jewish
nation that they were regarded merely as falsities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4905.">4905.</span></span>

And Judah said. That this signifies sentence from the religiosity in
which the Jewish nation was, is evident from the representation of
Judah, as being the religiosity of the Jewish nation (n. 4864). That
sentence from this is signified is plain from what now follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4906.">4906.</span></span>

Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. That this signifies that it ought
to be extirpated, namely, the internal of the church which is
represented by Tamar, is evident from the signification of "bringing her
forth and burning her," as being to extirpate. "Bringing forth" is
predicated of the truth, and "burning" of the good, which was to be
extirpated. That "burning" is predicated of the extirpation of good is
evident from many passages in the Word; and the reason is that "fire"
and "flame" in the spiritual sense denote good, and hence "heat" denotes
the affection of good; but in the opposite sense "fire" and "flame"
denote evil, and the "heat" thence the affection of evil (n. 1297, 1861,
2446). Moreover, good is actually spiritual fire, from which comes the
spiritual heat which vivifies, and evil is the fire and the consequent
heat which consumes. That the good of love is spiritual fire, and that
the affection of this good is spiritual heat, will be very evident to
one who attends and reflects; for if he reflects whence man has vital
fire and heat, he will find that it is from love; because as soon as
love ceases, the man grows cold, while the more he is in love, the
warmer he grows. Unless man's vitality were from this origin he could
have no life at all. But this spiritual fire or heat which produces life
becomes a burning and consuming fire with the evil, for with them it is
turned into this kind of fire. With animals devoid of reason spiritual
heat likewise flows in and produces life, but a life according to the
reception in their organic forms, for which reason their knowledges and
affections are connate, as with bees and the rest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4907.">4907.</span></span>

She was brought forth. That this signifies that it was nearly effected,
that is, its extirpation, is evident from the signification of "being
brought forth and burnt," as being to be extirpated, of which just above
(n. 4906). Here therefore by "being brought forth to be burnt" is meant
that extirpation was nearly effected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4908.">4908.</span></span>

And she sent to her father-in-law. That this signifies instilling,
namely, that she was with child by him, is evident from the series, from
which this meaning results.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4909.">4909.</span></span>

Saying, By the man whose these are am I with child. That this signifies
that such a quality was in their religiosity, is evident from the
representation of Judah, who here is "the man," as being the religiosity
of the Jewish nation (n. 4864, 4905); and from the signification of
"carrying in the womb" or "being with child," as being to be produced
(n. 4904); but here to be in, for that which has been produced (that is,
that which is conceived) is in. This product is the first effect, which
because efficient is called a cause, from which is further effect, of
which above (see n. 4904). What was in their religiosity may be seen
from what was said above (n. 4899), and also from what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4910.">4910.</span></span>

And she said, Acknowledge I pray whose are these, the signet and the
kerchief and the staff. That this signifies that it might be known from
the pledges, is evident from the signification of the "signet, kerchief,
and staff," as being pledges of the conjunction of the external or
natural man (see n. 4874, 4887).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4911.">4911.</span></span>

And Judah acknowledged them. That this signifies that being theirs they
made affirmation, is evident from the signification of "acknowledging,"
as being to affirm, and this because he acknowledged from the pledges
that it was his. In this passage the genius of that nation is described,
which is such that though they reject the internal of the church as
false, yet when it is insinuated into them that it is theirs, they
accept and affirm it. They who are in the filth of loves, that is, in
avarice, and at the same time in the love of self, as that nation is,
cannot elevate the mind's view and see truth from any other source than
self; and therefore when it is attributed to themselves, they affirm it.
For example, if they are told that the Word in itself is Divine, and
contains arcana of heaven, and also such arcana as can be comprehended
only by angels, they affirm this to be true, for they regard the Word as
their own, because it was for them, among them, and treats of them in
the letter; but if the arcana or spiritual truths themselves are
disclosed to them, they reject them. \[2\] If they are told that the
rituals of their church were all holy in themselves, they affirm this to
be true, because they regard these rituals as their own; but if it is
said that those holy things were in the rituals apart from them, this
they deny. Again, if they should be told that the Jewish Church was
celestial and the Israelitish Church spiritual, and if it were explained
to them what the celestial and spiritual are, they would affirm this
also; but if it were said that these churches are called celestial and
spiritual for the reason that every particular in them represented
celestial and spiritual things, and that representatives have regard to
the thing and not to the person, they would deny it. Again, if they are
told that in the staff of Moses there was power from Jehovah, and thus
Divine power, they affirm it and call it true; but if they are told that
this power was not in the staff, but only in the Divine command, this
they deny and call it false. \[3\] If they are told that the brazen
serpent set up by Moses healed those who were bitten by serpents, and
thus that it was miraculous, they affirm it; but if it is said that it
was not healing and miraculous in itself, but from the Lord who was
represented, they deny it and call it false. (Compare what is related
and said of the serpent in several passages, Num. 21:7-9; 2 Kings 18:4;
John 3:14, 15.) So also in all other instances. Such are the things
which are signified by Judah's acknowledging, and which on the part of
the nation signified by him were conjoined with the internal of the
church which is represented by Tamar; and because they were such, Judah
did not come to her as a husband's brother to a wife, but as a
whoremonger to a harlot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4912.">4912.</span></span>

And said, She is more just than I. That this signifies that there was no
conjunction of the external with the internal, but only of the internal
with the external, is evident from what was said above (n. 4899) about
the church with the Jewish nation, and in them, namely, that there was a
church with that people, that is, the internal was conjoined with the
external; but that there was no church in them, that is, the external
was not conjoined with the internal; for that the church may be in a
nation there must be reciprocity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4913.">4913.</span></span>

Forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. That this signifies
because the external was of such a quality, is evident from what has
been explained above - that Tamar could not be given to Shelah, Judah's
son, because in this case there would be conjunction as of a wife with
her husband in accordance with the law in regard to the duty of a
husband's brother; whereas the religiosity of the Jewish nation, which
was to be represented, was not such, but was such as is the conjunction
of a father-in-law with a daughter-in-law as with a harlot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4914.">4914.</span></span>

And he added no further to know her. That this signifies that there was
no further conjunction, is evident from the signification of "knowing,"
as being to be conjoined; and from the signification of "adding no
further," as being that it was no further, consequently that there was
no further any conjunction with the internal of the church; for the
internal of the church is represented by Tamar. For this reason also
Judah had no more sons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4915.">4915.</span></span>

Verses 27-30. And it came to pass in the time of her travail, and behold
twins were in her womb. And it came to pass when she travailed, and one
put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound double-dyed upon his
hand, saying, This came out first. And it came to pass as he drew back
his hand, that behold his brother came out; and she said, Wherefore hast
thou broken upon thee a breach? And he called his name Perez. And
afterward came out his brother, that had the double-dyed upon his hand;
and he called his name Zerah. "And it came to pass in the time,"
signifies a following state; "of her travail," signifies acknowledgement
on the part of internal truth; "and behold twins were in her womb,"
signifies both things of the church; "and it came to pass when she
travailed," signifies production; "and one put out a hand," signifies
power; "and the midwife took," signifies the natural; "and bound
double-dyed upon his hand" signifies that she put a mark upon
it-"double-dyed" denotes good; "saying, This came out first," signifies
that it had the priority; "and it came to pass, as he drew back his
hand," signifies that it concealed its power; "that behold his brother
came out," signifies the truth of good; "and she said, Wherefore hast
thou broken upon thee a breach?" signifies its apparent separation from
good; "and he called his name Perez," signifies the quality; "and
afterward came out his brother," signifies good actually prior; "that
had the double-dyed upon his hand" signifies acknowledgment that it was
good; "and he called his name Zerah," signifies the quality.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4916.">4916.</span></span>

And it came to pass in the time. That this signifies a following state,
is evident from the signification of "time," as being state (n. 1274,
1382, 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356, 3827, 4882, 4901). That its "coming
to pass in the time" signifies a following state is evident, because
what came to pass now follows (see also n. 4814).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4917.">4917.</span></span>

Of her travail. That this signifies acknowledgment on the part of
internal truth, is evident from the signification of "travailing," as
being to acknowledge in faith and act (n. 3905, 3915, 3919); and from
the representation of Tamar, who is meant by "her," as being the
internal of the representative church, consequently internal truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4918.">4918.</span></span>

And behold twins were in her womb. That this signifies both things of
the church, is evident from the signification of "twins," as being both
good and truth (n. 3299); and from the signification of the "womb," as
being where good and truth lie conceived, consequently, where that is
which is of the church. The "womb" in the genuine sense signifies the
inmost of conjugial love in which is innocence, because in the Grand Man
the womb corresponds to this love; and as conjugial love has its origin
from the love of good and truth which belongs to the heavenly marriage,
and as this marriage is heaven itself, or the Lord's kingdom, and as the
Lord's kingdom on earth is the church, therefore the church also is
signified by the "womb;" for the church is where the marriage of good
and truth is. For this reason it is that "opening the womb" denotes the
derivative doctrines of churches (n. 3856), and also the capacity to
receive the truths and goods of the church (n. 3967); and that "coming
forth from the womb" denotes to be reborn or regenerated (see n. 4904),
that is, to be made a church, for whoever is reborn or regenerated is
made a church. \[2\] As rebirth, and hence the church, are signified by
"going forth from the womb," therefore the Lord is called in the Word,
"He that formeth from the womb," "He that bringeth forth from the womb;"
and they who are regenerated and made a church are said to be "carried
from the womb," as in Isaiah: Thus said Jehovah thy Maker, He that
formeth thee from the womb, He helpeth thee (Isa. 44:2). Again: Thus
said Jehovah thy Redeemer, and He that formed thee from the womb (Isa.
44:24). Again: Said Jehovah that formed me from the womb to be His
servant, to bring Jacob again to Him, and that Israel be gathered unto
Him (Isa. 49:5) In David: Jehovah who brought me forth from the womb
(Ps. 22:9). Again in Isaiah: Attend to Me, O house of Jacob, and all the
remains of the house of Israel, carried from the womb and borne from the
matrix (Isa. 46:3). In David: The wicked are estranged from the womb;
they go astray from the belly, with words of a lie (Ps. 58:3); where
"being estranged from the womb" means from the good which is of the
church, and "going astray from the belly" means going astray from truth.
In Hosea: The pangs of a travailing woman shall come upon him; he is an
unwise son, for at the time he standeth not In the womb of sons (Hos.
13:13); where "not standing in the womb of sons" means not being in the
good of truth which is of the church. \[3\] Again: Their glory shall fly
away like a bird; from the birth, from the belly, and from conception
(Hos. 9:11); meaning that the truth of the church will entirely perish;
"from the birth" meaning what is born; "from the belly," what is in
gestation; "from conception," what is begun. In Isaiah: I knew that thou
wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from
the womb (Isa. 48:8); meaning that such was their quality from the
beginning of the church. In Revelation: A great sign was seen in heaven,
a woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon
her head a crown of twelve stars; and she bearing in the belly, cried
out, travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered (Rev. 12:1-2); the
"woman" is the church (n. 252, 253, 255); the "sun with which she was
encompassed" is the good of love (n. 30-38, 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495,
4060, 4696); the "moon which was under her feet" is the truth of faith
(n. 30-38, 1529, 1530, 2120, 2495, 4696); the "stars" are the knowledges
of good and truth (n. 2495, 2849, 4697); that there were "twelve" stars
is because "twelve" means all, and thus all things of faith (n. 577,
2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913); "bearing in the belly" means the
truth of the church conceived; "travailing in birth and in pain to be
delivered" means that it was received with difficulty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4919.">4919.</span></span>

And it came to pass when she travailed. That this signifies production,
is evident from the signification of "travailing," as being to
acknowledge in faith and act (n. 3905, 3915, 3919); and as whatever is
acknowledged in faith and act is produced, therefore by "travailing" is
also signified production, namely of good and truth, which are of the
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4920.">4920.</span></span>

And one put out a hand. That this signifies power, is evident from the
signification of a "hand," as being power (n. 878, 3387).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4921.">4921.</span></span>

And the midwife took. That this signifies the natural, is evident from
the signification of a "midwife," as being the natural (n. 4588). How
the case herein is will appear from what follows. That in the spiritual
world a midwife has a signification other than in the natural world, is
evident from the fact that none of the things relating to birth, and
consequently to the office of a midwife, exist there; whence it is
evident that when a man is reading these words, the angels with him
perceive something else in place of a midwife, and indeed something
spiritual. Consequently, as angels keep their ideas in those things
which relate to spiritual birth, by a midwife they perceive that which
assists and receives this birth; and that this is the natural may be
seen above (n. 4588).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4922.">4922.</span></span>

And bound double-dyed upon his hand. That this signifies that she put a
mark upon it, namely, upon the power, and that "double-dyed" is good, is
evident from the signification of "binding upon the hand," as being to
put a mark upon power, for the "hand" is power (n. 4920); and from the
signification of "double-dyed" as being good, and indeed spiritual good.
That "double-dyed" denotes spiritual good, is because it was of a
scarlet color; and the color of scarlet when seen in the other life
signifies spiritual good, that is, the good of charity toward the
neighbor. For all colors visible in the other life signify something of
good and truth, because they come into existence from the light of
heaven, which in itself is wisdom and intelligence from the Lord's
Divine. The variations or modifications of that light are the consequent
variations, and so to speak modifications, of wisdom and intelligence,
consequently of good and truth. That the light in heaven is from the
Divine wisdom and intelligence of the Lord, who appears there as a sun,
may be seen above (n. 1053, 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 2776, 3138, 3167,
3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3337, 3339, 3340, 3485, 3636, 3643, 3862,
3993, 4180, 4214, 4302, 4405, 4408, 4413, 4415, 4523-4533). That colors
are from this source, and that they are the variations and modifications
of that light, and consequently of intelligence and wisdom, may be seen
above (n. 1042, 1043, 1053, 1624, 3993, 4530, 4677, 4742). \[2\] That
"double-dyed" denotes spiritual good, is plain from the passages in the
Word in which it is mentioned, as in Jeremiah: If then thou art laid
waste what wilt thou do? If thou clothest thyself with double-dyed, and
adornest thyself with an ornament of gold, in vain shalt thou make
thyself beautiful; the lovers will abhor thee (Jer. 4:30); where Judah
is spoken of; "clothing thyself with double-dyed" denotes spiritual
good, and "adorning thyself with an ornament of gold" denotes celestial
good. In the second book of Samuel: David lamented over Saul and over
Jonathan, and wrote to teach the sons of Judah the bow. Ye daughters of
Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in double-dyed, with delights,
and put an ornament of gold upon your apparel (2 Sam. 1:17-18, 24);
where "teaching the bow" is teaching the doctrine of love and charity,
for a "bow" signifies this doctrine; "clothing in double-dyed" denotes
spiritual good, as before; and "putting an ornament of gold upon the
apparel" denotes celestial good. \[3\] Because this was the
signification of "double-dyed," it was commanded that double-dyed
scarlet should be used on the curtains of the tabernacle, on the veil,
on the covering for the door of the tent, on the covering for the gate
of the court, on the table of faces when they journeyed, and on Aaron's
garments of holiness, as on the ephod, the breastplate of judgment, and
the fringe of the robe of the ephod - as is evident from the following
passages: \[4\] Thou shalt make for the tabernacle ten curtains; of
fine-twined linen, and blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed (Exod.
26:1). Thou shalt make a veil of blue, and crimson, and scarlet
double-dyed, and fine-twined linen (Exod. 26:31). Thou shalt make a
covering for the door of the tent, of blue, and crimson, and scarlet
double-dyed, and fine-twined linen (Exod. 26:36). For the gate of the
court thou shalt make a covering of blue, and crimson, and scarlet
double-dyed, and fine-twined linen, the work of the embroiderer (Exod.
27:16). When the camp setteth forward they shall spread upon the table
of faces a cloth of scarlet double-dyed, and cover the same with a
covering of badger's skin (Num. 4:5, 7, 8). Thou shalt make the ephod of
gold, of blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed and fine-twined
linen, the work of the artificer. Likewise on the belt (Exod. 28:6, 8).
Thou shalt make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the artificer;
like the work of the ephod, of gold, of blue, and crimson, and scarlet
double-dyed, and fine-twined linen (Exod. 27:15). Upon the fringe of the
robe of the ephod \[thou shalt make\] pomegranates of blue, and of
crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed (Exod. 27:33). \[5\] As the tent of
assembly with the ark represented heaven, therefore the above-mentioned
colors were commanded to be used; and they signify in their order the
celestial and spiritual things there, "blue and crimson" signifying
celestial goods and truths, and "scarlet double-dyed and fine-twined
linen," spiritual goods and truths. Everyone who believes the Word to be
holy can know that everything in it has some signification; and whoever
believes that the Word is holy because it was sent down by the Lord
through heaven, can know that the celestial and spiritual things of His
kingdom are signified. In like manner it was commanded that cedar wood,
and scarlet, and hyssop should be used in the cleansing from leprosy
(Lev. 14:4, 6, 52); and that cedar wood, and hyssop, and double-dyed
crimson should be cast upon the burning of a red heifer, from which was
to be prepared the water of separation (Num. 19:6, 9). \[6\] The
profanation of good and truth is described by similar expressions in
Revelation. I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. And the woman was clothed
in crimson and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and
pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and
filthiness of her whoredoms (Rev. 17:3-4). Woe, woe, the great city, she
that was clothed in fine linen, and crimson, and scarlet, and gilded
with gold, and precious stone and pearls (Rev. 18:16); speaking of
Babylon, by which is signified the profanation of good (n. 1182, 1283,
1295, 1304, 1306-1308, 1321, 1322, 1326), here the profanation of good
and truth, which is Babylonish. In the prophets of the Old Testament,
"Babylon" is the profanation of good, and "Chaldea" the profanation of
truth. \[7\] "Scarlet," in the opposite sense, signifies the evil which
is opposite to spiritual good, as in Isaiah: Though your sins be as
scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
crimson, they shall be as wool (Isa. 1:18). That "scarlet" signifies
this evil is because "blood"-also from its redness-signifies in the
genuine sense spiritual good, or charity toward the neighbor, but in the
opposite sense violence offered to charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4923.">4923.</span></span>

Saying, this came out first. That this signifies that it had the
priority, is evident from the signification of "coming out first," or
being the firstborn, as being priority and superiority (n. 3325). The
subject treated of here and through the remainder of this chapter is
primogeniture. One who has no knowledge of the internal sense of the
Word may suppose that it is primogeniture only that is treated of, and
consequently the prerogatives which the firstborn would have according
to the laws; but one who knows anything of the internal sense can see
plainly enough that something more exalted also lies concealed and
stored up in these words, not only from the very fact that one of the
children put out his hand and drew it back again, whereupon the other
came out, but also from the fact that they were named from this, and
that the midwife bound double-dyed upon the hand of the first; and
further from the fact that very similar incidents were related of Esau
and Jacob-that they struggled together in the womb, and that when Esau
came out first, Jacob took hold of his heel (Gen. 25:22, 26); and from
the similarity of the case of the two sons of Joseph, on the younger of
whom Jacob placed his right hand, and on the other his left hand, when
he blessed them (Gen. 48:14, 17-19). \[2\] The Jews and also some
Christians believe indeed that in these, and also in the rest of the
passages of the Word, there is some meaning stored up, which they call
mystical, the reason of this belief being that an idea of holiness in
regard to the Word has been impressed upon them from early childhood;
but when it is inquired what this mystical meaning is, they do not know.
If they are told that because the Word is Divine, this meaning must
necessarily be such as is in heaven among the angels; and that no other
mystical meaning can exist in the Word, or if so, that it would be
either fabulous or magical or idolatrous; and furthermore that this
mystical meaning which is in heaven among the angels is nothing else
than what is called the spiritual and celestial, and treats solely of
the Lord, of His kingdom, and of the church, consequently of good and
truth; and that if they knew what good and truth, or what faith and
love, are, they would be able to know this meaning-when this is told
them, scarcely anyone believes it; nay, in such ignorance at the present
day are they who are of the church, that what is related concerning the
celestial and spiritual, is scarcely comprehensible to them. Be it so;
nevertheless as it has been granted me of the Lord's Divine mercy to be
at the same time in heaven as a spirit and on earth as a man, and
therefore to speak with angels, and this now continually for many years,
I cannot do otherwise than open those things of the Word which are
called mystical, that is, its interiors, which are the spiritual and
celestial things of the Lord's kingdom. But what the incidents related
of the two sons of Tamar involve in the internal sense, will be shown in
the following pages.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4924.">4924.</span></span>

And it came to pass as he drew back his hand. That this signifies that
it concealed its power, is evident from the signification of "hand," as
being power (n. 878, 3387, 4920); to conceal which is signified by
"drawing back."

<span class="margnote"><span id="4925.">4925.</span></span>

That behold his brother came out. That this signifies the truth of good,
is evident from the signification of a "brother," as being what is
kindred from good (n. 3815, 4267), thus the truth of good; the truth of
good is that truth which is from good, or that faith which is from
charity. The subject treated of here in the internal sense is
primogeniture in the case of those who are being reborn or regenerated
by the Lord, consequently primogeniture in the church. It has been a
matter of dispute from the most ancient times which is the firstborn,
whether the good which is of charity, or the truth which is of faith;
and as good does not appear while man is being reborn and made a church,
but conceals itself in the interior man, and manifests itself only in a
certain affection which does not fall clearly into the sensation of the
external or natural man, until he has been reborn - whereas truth makes
itself manifest, because it enters through the senses and stores itself
in the memory of the external or natural man - therefore many persons
have fallen into the error of thinking that truth is the firstborn, and
at last even into that of thinking that truth is the essential of the
church, and so essential that truth, which they call faith, has power to
save without the good which is of charity. \[2\] From this one error
very many others have been derived, which have infected not only
doctrine, but also life; as for instance that no matter how a man lives,
provided he has faith he is saved; that even the most wicked are
received into heaven if in the hour of death they make profession of
such things as are of faith; and that everyone can be received into
heaven merely from grace, whatever his life has been. In consequence of
holding this doctrine they at last do not know what charity is, nor do
they care for it; and finally they do not believe there is such a thing,
nor consequently that there is a heaven or a hell. The reason is that
faith without charity, or truth without good, teaches nothing; and the
more it recedes from good, the more foolish it renders a man. For it is
good into which and through which the Lord flows and gives intelligence
and wisdom, thus a higher mental view, and also perception as to whether
a thing be so or not so. \[3\] All this shows how the case is in regard
to primogeniture - it actually belongs to good, and to truth only
apparently. This then is what is described in the internal sense by the
birth of Tamar's two sons, for by the "double-dyed" which the midwife
bound upon the hand is signified good (see n. 4922); by "coming out
first" is signified priority (n. 4923); by "drawing back his hand" is
signified that good concealed its power, as was said just above; by his
"brother coming out" is signified truth; by "thou hast broken upon thee
a breach" is signified the apparent separation of truth from good; by
his "brother coming out afterward" is signified that good is actually
prior; and by "that had the double-dyed upon his hand" is signified
acknowledgment that it is good; for good is not acknowledged to be prior
until after the man has been reborn, for he then acts from good and from
it regards truth and its quality. \[4\] These are the things which are
contained in the internal sense, which teaches how the case is with good
and truth in the man who is being born anew, namely, that good is
actually in the first place, but truth apparently; and that good does
not appear to be in the first place while the man is being regenerated,
but becomes manifestly so when he has been regenerated. But these things
need not be further explained here, because they have been explained
before (see n. 3324, 3325, 3494, 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576,
3603, 3701, 4243, 4244, 4247, 4337). That from ancient times it has been
a matter of controversy whether primogeniture belongs to good or to
truth, or whether to charity or to faith, has also been shown above (n.
2435). \[5\] As the Lord in the supreme sense is the "Firstborn,"
consequently love to Him and charity toward the neighbor, therefore it
was ordained as a law in the representative church that the firstborn
should be Jehovah's, as we read in Moses: Sanctify to Me all the
firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the sons of Israel, in man
and in beast, let them be Mine (Exod. 13:2). Thou shalt cause to pass to
Jehovah everything that openeth the womb, and everything that openeth
the offspring of a beast, as many as shall be males to thee, shall be
Jehovah's (Exod. 13:12). Everything that openeth the womb is Mine;
therefore as to all thy cattle thou shalt give the male, that openeth of
ox and small cattle (Exod. 34:19). Everything that openeth the womb of
all flesh, which they shall bring to Jehovah, of men and of beasts,
shall be thine; nevertheless every first born of man shalt thou surely
redeem (Num. 18:15). Behold I have taken the Levites from the midst of
the sons of Israel, instead of every firstborn that openeth the womb of
the sons of Israel; that the Levites may be Mine (Num. 3:12). \[6\] As
that which opens the womb is the firstborn, therefore where the word
"firstborn" is mentioned, it is also said "that which openeth the womb;"
in order that good may be signified. That this signifies good is evident
from the particulars in the internal sense, especially from what is
related of Tamar's sons-that Zerah opened the womb with his hand, by
whom good is represented, as is evident from the double-dyed upon his
hand (n. 4922). Moreover, the "womb," which is said to be "opened," is
where good and truth are, consequently the church (n. 4918); and to
"open the womb" is to give power that truth may be born. \[7\] As the
Lord alone is the Firstborn - for He is good itself, and from His good
is all truth - therefore in order that Jacob, who was not the firstborn,
might represent Him, he was permitted to buy the primogeniture from Esau
his brother; and because this was not sufficient, he was called Israel,
in order that by this name he might represent the good of truth; for
Israel in the representative sense is the good which comes by means of
truth (n. 3654, 4286, 4598).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4926.">4926.</span></span>

And she said, Wherefore hast thou broken upon thee a breach? That this
signifies its apparent separation from good, is evident from the
signification of a "breach," as being the infraction and perversion of
truth by separation from good-of which presently. That "to break a
breach" here is to pull off the double-dyed from the hand, and thus to
separate good, is evident, for by "double-dyed" is signified good (n.
4922); that this was apparently so follows from the fact that it so
appeared to the midwife; for this was not the one who had the
double-dyed, but his brother, by whom is represented truth. On this
subject see what is shown just above (n. 4925), namely that good is
actually the firstborn, but truth apparently. This may be further
illustrated from the uses and members in the human body. It appears as
if the members and organs are prior, and that their uses follow; for the
former are first presented to the eye, and are also known before the
uses. Nevertheless the use is prior to the members and organs, these
latter being from the uses, and therefore formed according to them; nay,
the use itself forms them, and adapts them to itself. Unless this were
so, all and each of the things in man would by no means conspire so
unanimously to a one. It is similar with good and truth: it appears as
if truth were prior, but it is good, for good forms truths and adapts
them to itself; wherefore regarded in themselves truths are nothing else
than goods formed, or forms of good. Truths also in respect to good are
like the viscera and fibers in the body in respect to uses; and regarded
in itself good is nothing else than use. \[2\] That a "breach" signifies
infraction of truth and perversion of it by separation from good, is
evident also from other passages in the Word, as in David: Our garners
are full, affording from food to food; our flocks are thousands and ten
thousands in our streets; our oxen are laden; there is no breach (Ps.
144:13-14); treating of the Ancient Church, such as it was in its youth;
the "food with which the garners were full" denotes spiritual food, that
is, truth and good; "flocks" and "oxen" denote internal and external
goods; "there is no breach" denotes that truth is not infracted or
broken through by separation from good. \[3\] In Amos: I will raise up
the tent of David that is fallen, and fence up the breaches thereof; and
I will restore its ruins, and I will build it according to the days of
eternity (Amos 9:11); describing the church which is in good, the "tent
of David that is fallen" being the good of love and charity from the
Lord. (That "tent" is this good, may be seen above, n. 414, 1102, 2145,
2152, 3312, 4128, 4391, 4599, and that "David" is the Lord, n. 1888.) To
"fence up the breaches" means to amend the falsities which have entered
by the separation of truth from good; "to build it according to the days
of eternity" denotes according to the state of the church in ancient
times; that state and those times are called in the Word the "days of
eternity," the "days of an age," and also "of generation and generation"
- as in Isaiah: \[4\] Builds of thee the wastes of an age, the
foundations of generation and generation; and thou shall be called, The
repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in (Isa. 58:12);
describing the church in which charity and life is the essential. Here
also "repairing the breach" denotes amending the falsities which have
crept in by the separation of good from truth, every falsity being from
this source; and "restoring paths to dwell in" denotes truths which are
of good, for "paths" or "ways" are truths (n. 627, 2333), and "dwelling"
is predicated of good (n. 2268, 2451, 2712, 3613). \[5\] Again: Ye saw
the breaches of the city of David, that they were many; and ye gathered
together the waters of the lower pool (Isa. 22:9); the "breaches of the
city of David" denote falsities of doctrine, and the "waters of the
lower pool" the traditions by which they made infractions of the truths
that are in the Word (Matt. 15:1-6; Mark 7:1-14). In Ezekiel: Ye have
not gone up into the breaches, neither have ye built up the fence for
the house of Israel, that ye might stand in the war in the days of
Jehovah (Ezek. 13:5). Again, I sought from them a man that buildeth the
fence, and standeth in the breach before Me for the land, that I should
not destroy it; but I found none (Ezek. 22:30); to "stand in the breach"
denotes to defend and to take heed lest falsities break in. In David:
Jehovah said that He would destroy the people, unless Moses His chosen
had stood before Him in the breach (Ps. 106:23); where also "to stand in
the breach" denotes to take heed lest falsities break in. "Moses" is the
Word (see preface to Gen. 18, and n. 4859e). \[6\] In Amos: They shall
draw out your posterity with fish-hooks. Ye shall go forth through the
breaches, everyone straight before her; and ye shall throw down the
palace (Amos 4:2-3); "to go forth through the breaches" denotes through
falsities from reasonings; the "palace" is the Word, consequently the
truth of doctrine which is from good. And as by "breaches" is signified
the falsity which comes into existence by the separation of good from
truth, the same is also signified, in the representative sense, by
"strengthening and repairing the breaches of the house of Jehovah" (2
Kings 12:6-8, 12; 22:5). In the second book of Samuel: It grieved David
because Jehovah had broken a breach upon Uzzah; therefore he called that
place Perez-Uzzah (2 Sam. 6:8); speaking of Uzzah, who died because he
touched the ark; by the ark was represented heaven, in the supreme sense
the Lord, consequently Divine good; by Uzzah however was represented
that which ministers, thus truth, for this ministers to good. The
separation above described is signified by the "breach upon Uzzah."

<span class="margnote"><span id="4927.">4927.</span></span>

And he called his name Perez. That this signifies the quality, namely,
of the apparent separation of truth from good, is evident from the
signification of "calling a name," as being the quality (n. 144, 145,
1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006, 3421). The quality itself is "Perez;" for
in the original language "Perez" means a "breach."

<span class="margnote"><span id="4928.">4928.</span></span>

And afterward came out his brother. That this signifies good actually
prior, is evident from the representation of Zerah, who here is the
"brother," as being good; for he it was who opened the womb, thus who
was the firstborn, and upon whose hand was the double-dyed, which, as
shown above (n. 4925), is good. That by his brother's coming out
afterward is signified that good is actually prior, is because during
man's regeneration good does not appear, because it conceals itself in
the interior man, and only flows into truth through affection according
to the degrees of conjunction of truth with it. But when truth has been
conjoined with good, as when man has been regenerated, good manifests
itself; for man then acts from good and regards truths as from good,
because he is then more studious of life than of doctrine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4929.">4929.</span></span>

That had the double-dyed upon his hand. That this signifies
acknowledgment that it is good, is evident from the fact that he was now
acknowledged from the double-dyed upon his hand, thus it was
acknowledged that it was good which opened the womb, or which was the
firstborn. By the midwife's binding double-dyed upon his hand is
signified that she marked who was the firstborn, and hence
acknowledgment is here signified.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4930.">4930.</span></span>

And he called his name Zerah. That this signifies the quality, is
evident from the signification of "calling a name," as being the quality
(see n. 4927). The quality which is signified by "Zerah," is the quality
of what has been hitherto the subject treated of in the internal sense,
namely, that good is actually the firstborn and truth only apparently
so. The quality itself contains innumerable things within it which
cannot be seen in the light of the world, but only in the light of
heaven, thus before the angels. If man should see the quality of a
single thing as it appears before the angels, he would be amazed, and
would confess that he would never have believed it, and that in
comparison he had known scarcely anything. "Zerah," in the original
language, signifies a "rising," and is applied to the sun and to the
first appearance of its light. He was named Zerah from this because it
is similar with good in the man who is being regenerated, for this first
rises and gives light, from which light are enlightened the things in
the natural man, so that they may be seen, and acknowledged, and finally
believed. Unless there were light from good inwardly in man, he would
never be able to see truths so as to acknowledge and believe them, but
would look upon them either as things to be called true on account of
the common people, or else as falsities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4931.">4931.</span></span>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND MAN, HERE
CONCERNING THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HANDS, ARMS, FEET, AND LOINS
THEREWITH. It has been already shown that the whole heaven has reference
to one Man with his several organs, members, and viscera; and this
because heaven has reference to the Lord, for the Lord is the all in all
of heaven, insomuch that heaven is in the proper sense the Divine good
and Divine truth which are from the Lord. For this reason heaven is
distinguished into as many provinces, so to speak, as there are viscera,
organs, and members in man, and with these also there is correspondence.
Unless there were such a correspondence of man with heaven, and through
heaven with the Lord, man would not subsist even a single moment. All
these things are kept in connection by influx. \[2\] But all these
provinces have reference to two kingdoms - the celestial kingdom and the
spiritual kingdom. The celestial kingdom is the kingdom of the heart in
the Grand Man, and the spiritual kingdom is the kingdom of the lungs; in
like manner as in man, in the whole and every part of whom reign the
heart and the lungs. These two kingdoms are wonderfully conjoined; and
this conjunction is represented in the conjunction of the heart and
lungs in man, and in the conjunction of their operations in the several
members and viscera. \[3\] While man is an embryo, or while he is yet in
the womb, he is in the kingdom of the heart; but when he has come forth
from the womb, he comes into the kingdom of the lungs; and if through
the truths of faith he suffers himself to be brought into the good of
love, he then returns from the kingdom of the lungs into the kingdom of
the heart in the Grand Man; for he thus comes a second time into the
womb and is born again. Then also these two kingdoms are conjoined in
him, but in an inverted order; for previously the kingdom of the heart
in him was under the rule of the lungs, that is, the truth of faith
previously ruled in him; but afterward the good of charity rules. That
the heart corresponds to the good of love, and the lungs to the truth of
faith, may be seen above (n. 3635, 3883-3896).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4932.">4932.</span></span>

They in the Grand Man who correspond to the hands and arms, and also to
the shoulders, are those who have power by the truth of faith from good.
For those who are in the truth of faith from good are in the power of
the Lord because they attribute all power to Him, and none to
themselves; and the more they attribute none to themselves - not with
the lips, but with the heart - the more they are in power. From this the
angels are called potencies and powers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4933.">4933.</span></span>

That in the Grand Man the hands, arms, and shoulders correspond to
power, is because the forces and powers of the whole body and of all its
viscera have reference to them; for the body exerts its forces and
powers by the arms and hands. It is for this reason also that power is
signified in the Word by the "hands," "arms," and "shoulders." That this
is signified by the "hands," may be seen above (n. 878, 3387); and that
it is signified by the "arms" also, is plain from many passages, as from
the following: Be Thou their arm every morning (Isa. 33:2). The Lord
Jehovih cometh in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him (Isa. 40:10).
He worketh it with the arm of His strength (Isa. 44:12). Mine arms shall
judge the peoples (Isa. 51:5). Put on strength, O arm of Jehovah (Isa.
51:9). I looked, and there was no one helping, therefore Mine arm
brought salvation unto Me (Isa. 63:5). Cursed is he that trusteth in
man, and maketh flesh his arm (Jer. 17:5). I have made the earth, the
man, and the beast, by My great power and by My outstretched arm (Isa.
27:5; 32:17). The horn of Moab is cut off, and His arm is broken (Isa.
48:25). I break the arms of the king of Egypt, but I will strengthen the
arms of the king of Babylon (Ezek. 30:22, 24-25). O Jehovah, break Thou
the arm of the wicked (Ps. 10:15). According to the greatness of Thine
arm reserve the sons of death (Ps. 79:11). Brought out of Egypt with a
mighty hand and with an outstretched arm (Deut. 7:19; 11:2-3; 26:8; Jer.
32:21; Ps. 136:12). From these passages it is also evident that by
"right hand" in the Word is signified superior power, and by "sitting at
the right hand of Jehovah," omnipotence (Matt. 26:63, 64; Luke 22:69;
Mark 14:61, 62; 16:19).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4934.">4934.</span></span>

I have seen a bare arm, bent forward, which was possessed of such force
and such power to inflict terror that I was not only horrified, but felt
as if I might be crushed to atoms, even as to my inmost things, for it
was irresistible. This arm has been seen by me twice; and from it I was
given to know that the arms signify strength, and the hands power. A
warmth was also felt exhaling from that arm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4935.">4935.</span></span>

This bare arm is presented to view in various positions, according to
which it excites terror, and in the position described just above,
incredible terror; for it appears able to crush the bones and marrows in
an instant. Even those who have not been timorous in the life of the
body are thrown into extreme terror in the other life by this arm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4936.">4936.</span></span>

Several times spirits have been seen who had rods, and who were said to
be magicians. They are in front, far away to the right, deep in caverns;
and those who have been more malign magicians are hidden away still
deeper. They seem to themselves to have rods, and they also by
phantasies make many kinds of rods, and believe that they can perform
miracles with them; for they suppose potency to be in the rods, and this
because they are what support the right hand and arm, which by
correspondence are strength and power. From this it was plain to me why
men of old attributed rods to magicians; for the ancient Gentiles had
this from the ancient representative church, in which rods, like hands,
signified power (see n. 4876). And because they signified power, Moses
was commanded, when miracles were wrought, to stretch out his rod, or
his hand (Exod. 4:17, 20; 8:1-11, 16-18; 9:23; 10:3-21; 14:21, 26, 27;
17:5, 6, 11, 12; Num. 20:7-11).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4937.">4937.</span></span>

Infernal spirits also sometimes by phantasy exhibit a shoulder, by which
they cause force to be repelled; and it cannot go beyond this; but this
is only for those who are in such phantasy, for they know that in the
spiritual world the shoulder corresponds to all power. By the
"shoulder," in the Word also is signified all power, as is evident in
the following passages: Thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the
staff of his shoulder (Isa. 9:4). Ye thrust with side and with shoulder,
and push with your horns (Ezek. 34:21). Thou cleavest for them every
shoulder (Ezek. 29:7). That they may serve Jehovah with one shoulder
(Zeph. 3:9). Unto us a Child is born, and the government shall be upon
His shoulder (Isa. 9:6). The key of the house of David will I put upon
his shoulder (Isa. 22:22).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4938.">4938.</span></span>

They in the Grand Man who correspond to the feet, the soles of the feet,
and the heels, are they who are natural; wherefore by "feet" in the Word
are signified natural things (n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280), by
"soles of the feet" lower natural things, and by "heels" the lowest
natural things. For in the Grand Man celestial things constitute the
head, spiritual the body, and natural the feet; and they follow in this
order. Celestial things also, which are highest, terminate in spiritual,
which are middle; and spiritual in natural, which are last.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4939.">4939.</span></span>

Once when I was elevated into heaven, it appeared to me as if I were
there with my head, and below with my body, but with my feet still
lower. And from this it was perceived how the higher and lower things in
man correspond to those which are in the Grand Man, and how the one
flows into the other, namely, that the celestial, which is the good of
love and the first in order, flows into the spiritual, which is the
truth thence derived and the second in order, and finally into the
natural, which is the third in order. From this it is evident that
natural things are like the feet, on which the higher things rest.
Nature also is that in which the spiritual world and heaven terminate.
Thence it is that universal nature is a theater representative of the
Lord's kingdom, and that everything in it is representative (n. 2758,
3483); and that nature subsists from influx according to this order, and
that without such influx it could not subsist even for a moment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4940.">4940.</span></span>

At another time when, encompassed with an angelic column, I was let down
into the places of lower things, it was given me sensibly to perceive
that they who were in the earth of lower things correspond to the feet,
and to the soles of the feet. Moreover, these places are under the feet
and the soles of the feet. I also conversed with the spirits there. They
are such as have been in natural, and not in spiritual delight.
(Concerning the lower earth see above, n. 4728.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="4941.">4941.</span></span>

In these places also are they who have ascribed all things to nature,
and but little to the Divine. I conversed with them there, and when the
conversation turned on the Divine providence, they attributed everything
to nature. Nevertheless when those who have led a good moral life have
been detained there for a time, they successively put off such
principles, and put on principles of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4942.">4942.</span></span>

While I was there, I heard in one of the rooms a noise as if there were
some persons on the other side of the wall trying to break in. Those in
the room were terrified at the sound, believing that it was thieves; and
I was told that they who are there are kept in such fear in order that
they may be deterred from evils, because fear is to some a means of
amendment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4943.">4943.</span></span>

In the lower earth, under the feet and the soles of the feet, are also
those who have placed merit in good deeds and in works. Some of them
appear to themselves to cut wood. The place where they are is rather
cold, and they seem to themselves to acquire warmth by their labor. With
these also I conversed, and it was given me to ask them whether they
wished to come out of that place. They replied that they had not yet
merited it by their labor. But when this state has been passed through,
they are taken out thence. These also are natural, because the desire to
merit salvation is not spiritual; and moreover, they regard themselves
as superior to others, and some of them even despise others. If such
persons do not receive more joy than others in the other life, they are
indignant against the Lord; and therefore when they cut wood there
sometimes appears as it were somewhat of the Lord under the wood, and
this from their indignation. But as they have led a pious life, and have
acted in this way from ignorance, in which there was something of
innocence, therefore angels are occasionally sent to them who console
them. And sometimes there appears to them from above on the left as it
were a sheep, at the sight of which they also receive consolation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4944.">4944.</span></span>

They who come out of the world from Christendom, and who have led a good
moral life, and have had something of charity toward the neighbor, but
have had little concern about spiritual things, are for the most part
sent into the places under the feet and the soles of the feet; and are
kept there until they put off the natural things in which they have
been, and become imbued with spiritual and heavenly things insofar as
they can be in accordance with their life; and when they have become
imbued with these, they are elevated thence to heavenly societies. I
have at times seen them emerging, and beheld their gladness at coming
into heavenly light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4945.">4945.</span></span>

In what situation the places under the feet are, it has not yet been
given me to know. There are very many of them, and all most distinct
from one another. In general they are called the earth of lower things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4946.">4946.</span></span>

There are some who in the life of the body have become imbued with the
idea that man ought not to be concerned about those things which are of
the internal man, thus about spiritual things, but only about those
which are of the external man, or that are natural, for the reason that
interior things disturb the delights of their life, and produce
discomfort. They acted upon the left knee, and a little above the knee
in front, and also upon the sole of the right foot. I conversed with
them in their place of abode; and they said that they had been of
opinion in the life of the body that only external things are living,
and that they did not understand what internal things are, consequently
that they knew what is natural, but not what the spiritual is. But it
was given me to tell them that by this means they had shut out from
themselves innumerable things which might have flowed in from the
spiritual world if they had acknowledged interior things, and thus had
admitted them into the ideas of their thought. And it was also given to
tell them that in every idea of thought there are innumerable things
which to man, especially the natural man, appear merely as a single
uncompounded thing; when yet there are indefinite things in it which
flow in from the spiritual world, and in a spiritual man produce
superior insight, by which he can see and also perceive whether anything
is true or not. And because they were in doubt in regard to this, it was
shown them by living experience. There was represented to them a single
idea, which they saw as one simple idea, and thus as an obscure point
(by a mode of representation very easy in the light of heaven); but when
that idea was unfolded, and at the same time their interior sight
opened, there was then manifested as it were a universe leading to the
Lord; and it was said that so it is with every idea of good and truth,
namely, that it is an image of the whole heaven, because it is from the
Lord, who is the all of heaven, or that itself which is called heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4947.">4947.</span></span>

Under the soles of the feet are they also who in the life of the body
have lived for the world and their own pleasure, being delighted with
such things as are of the world, and have loved to live in splendor, but
only from external cupidity or that of the body, not from internal
desire or that of the mind; for they have not been proud in spirit -
setting themselves before others - though in stations of honor; thus in
so living they have acted from the body, and therefore have not rejected
the teachings of the church, still less confirmed themselves against
them, but at heart have said of them that it is so, because those who
study the Word know it. In some who are of this character, the interiors
are open toward heaven, and into them are successively inseminated
heavenly things, such as justice, uprightness, piety, charity, and
mercy; and they are afterward taken up into heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4948.">4948.</span></span>

Those, however, who in the life of the body have from within thought and
taken interest in nothing else than what relates to self and the world,
have closed to themselves every way or every influx from heaven; because
the love of self and the world is opposite to heavenly love. Those of
them who have lived at the same time in pleasures, or in a luxurious
life conjoined with interior cunning, are under the sole of the right
foot, but at a great depth there, thus beneath the earth of lower
things, where is the hell of such spirits. In their dwellings is nothing
but filth; they also seem to themselves to carry filth, for it
corresponds to such a life. The stench of different kinds of filth is
smelled there according to the genera and species of their life. Many
have their abode there who have been among the more celebrated in the
world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4949.">4949.</span></span>

There are some who have abodes under the soles of the feet, with whom I
have occasionally conversed. I have seen some of them endeavoring to
ascend, and it was also granted me to feel their endeavor, and this even
to the knees; but they fell back again. In this manner is it represented
to the sense when any are desirous of ascending from their own abodes to
higher ones, as these were of ascending to the abodes of those who are
in the province of the knees and thighs. I was told that such are they
who have despised others in comparison with themselves; for which reason
also they wish to emerge, and not only through the foot into the thigh,
but also if possible above the head; yet still they fall back again.
They are in a kind of stupidity; for such arrogance extinguishes and
suffocates the light of heaven, and consequently intelligence. Wherefore
the sphere which surrounds them appears like thick dregs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4950.">4950.</span></span>

Under the left foot, a little to the left, are such as have attributed
all things to nature, but yet have made a confession of an Ens of the
universe from which come all the things of nature. Exploration was made
as to whether they had believed in any Ens of the universe, or Supreme
Deity, that had created all things; but it was perceived from their
thought communicated to me, that what they had believed in was like
something inanimate, in which there was nothing of life; and from this
it was evident that they had not acknowledged a Creator of the universe,
but nature. They also said that they could have no idea of a living
Deity.
