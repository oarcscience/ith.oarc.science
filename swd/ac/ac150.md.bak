### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="7451.">7451.</span></span>

And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron. That this signifies the presence of
the law Divine, is evident from the signification of "calling," as being
presence (see n. 6177, 7390); and from the representation of Moses and
Aaron, as being the law Divine; Moses the internal law, and Aaron the
external law (n. 7381, 7390).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7452.">7452.</span></span>

And said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. That this signifies
that they would not oppose their worshiping their God, but it must be
done in their neighborhood, is evident from the signification of "he
said, Go ye," as being that they would not oppose; from the
signification of "sacrificing," as being to worship (of which above, n.
7393); and from the signification of "in the land," that is, in the land
of Egypt, as being in their neighborhood. That "in the land" denotes in
their neighborhood, is plain from the answer of Moses, that it was not
meet to do so, for they would sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
before their eyes, but that they would go a way of three days into the
wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah their God; and also from the reply
of Pharaoh, that they should not go very far away (verses 21-23). Thus
by "the land" in the internal sense is meant where they are who are in
falsities and infest, concerning whose nearness see n. 7090.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7453.">7453.</span></span>

And Moses said. That this signifies the answer, see n. 7103, 7394.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7454.">7454.</span></span>

It is not meet to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the
Egyptians to Jehovah our God. That this signifies that infernal foulness
and filthiness would flow in, is evident from the signification of "it
is not meet to do so," as being that it cannot be so done; from the
signification of "abomination," as being infernal foulness and
filthiness; and from the signification of "sacrificing to Jehovah God,"
as being to worship their God (of which above, n. 7452). Hence by
"sacrificing to Jehovah God the abomination of the Egyptians" is
signified that they would worship God with a worship which those would
abominate who are in falsities from what is infernal contrary to this
worship, and which would infest it. \[2\] How the case stands with this
matter is very evident from things that show themselves clearly in the
other life. Every spirit, and still more every society, is surrounded
with a sphere of the faith and of the life of that spirit or society.
This sphere is a spiritual sphere, and by it is known the quality of the
spirit, and even better that of the society. For the sphere is perceived
by those who have perception, sometimes at a considerable distance; and
this although the spirit or the society is in hiding, and does not
communicate by thought or by speech. This spiritual sphere may be
compared to the material sphere which encompasses the body of a man in
the world, which is a sphere of effluvia exuding from him, and is
smelled by keen-scented beasts. (Of the spiritual sphere which
encompasses spirits, see n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504, 1519, 2401, 2489,
4464, 5179, 6206.) \[3\] From all this it can be seen that if infernal
spirits were near where they are who are in Divine worship, they would
infest them by their sphere, for in this way they who are in Divine
worship would perceive what is shocking and abominable. All this shows
how it is to be understood that infernal foulness and filthiness would
flow in, if they were to worship God in that neighborhood. From what has
been said about the spiritual sphere, or the sphere of faith and life,
which exhales from every spirit, and still more from a society of
spirits, it can also be seen that nothing whatever is hidden of that
which a man in the world has thought, spoken, and done, but that it is
in the open; for it is these things which make this sphere. Such a
sphere also pours forth from the spirit of a man while he is in the body
in the world; and from this his quality is also known. Therefore believe
not that the things a man thinks in secret and that he does in secret,
are hidden, for they are as clearly shown in heaven as are those which
appear in the light of noon, according to the Lord's words in Luke:
There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed; or hidden that
shall not be known; therefore whatsoever ye have said in the darkness
shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in
bed-chambers, shall be proclaimed upon the housetops (Luke 12:2-3).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7455.">7455.</span></span>

Lo, we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their
eyes. That this signifies that Divine worship would be infested by such
if done in their presence, is evident from the things just unfolded
above (n. 7454).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7456.">7456.</span></span>

And will they not stone us? That this signifies that they would thus
extinguish the truths of faith which are of worship, is evident from the
signification of "stoning," as being to extinguish and blot out
falsities; but in the opposite sense, when done by the evil, as being to
extinguish and blot out the truths of faith. If the infernal foulness
and filthiness spoken of above (n. 7454) were to flow in with those who
are in the holy of worship, the holy of worship would be extinguished;
for the reason that when man is in the holy of worship, he is withheld
from such things, and they who are in the good of faith and of life are
elevated from the sensuous where such things are; but when such objects
flow in, there are then excited the filthy things which are in the
sensuous mind (and from which, as just said, the man is withheld when he
is in the holy of worship, and they who are in good are being elevated),
and thereupon the holy of worship is extinguished. This may also be
plain from experience, for if when a man is engaged in Divine worship a
filthy object appears, and is not removed, so long as it remains, the
worship perishes and is extinguished. This is what is meant by the
truths of faith which are of worship being extinguished by those who are
in falsities from evils if these were in the neighborhood. \[2\] As
regards the signification of "stoning," be it known that there were two
death penalties among the Israelites and Jews, with whom the
representative of a church had been instituted, of which the one was
stoning, and the other was hanging upon wood. Stoning was for anyone who
desired to destroy the truths of worship that had been commanded, and
hanging was for anyone who desired to destroy the good of life. That
those were stoned who desired to destroy the truths of worship, was
because a "stone" signified truth, and in the opposite sense falsity (n.
643, 1298, 3720, 6426); and that those were hanged upon wood who desired
to destroy the good of life, was because "wood" signified good, and in
the opposite sense the evil of cupidities (n. 643, 2784, 2812, 3720).
\[3\] That the penalty of stoning was inflicted if anyone destroyed the
truths which are of worship, is plain from the following passages: At
last they will make the company come up upon thee, and they shall stone
thee with stone, and cut thee in sunder with their swords (Ezek. 16:40);
speaking of Jerusalem perverted, and of the destruction of the truth of
faith by means of falsities; hence it is said that they shall "stone
with stone," and also "cut in sunder with swords;" for a "sword"
signifies truth fighting and destroying falsity, and in the opposite
sense falsity fighting and destroying truth (n. 2799, 4499, 6353, 7102).
\[4\] So in another passage in the same: Make the company come up
against them, that the companies stone them with stone, and cleave them
asunder with their swords (Ezek. 23:46-47); speaking of Jerusalem and
Samaria, by which is signified the church, by "Jerusalem" the celestial
spiritual church, by "Samaria" the spiritual church; and in this chapter
is described how the goods and truths of faith have been destroyed in
them. \[5\] In Moses: If when an ox shall gore a man or a woman that
they die, stoning, the ox shall be stoned (Exod. 21:28); "to gore a man
or a woman" signifies falsity fighting and destroying truth and good,
for a "horn" denotes falsity fighting, and also the power of falsity (n.
2832); by "man" and "woman" are signified in the Word truth and good.
From this it is evident what is the internal sense in this command, and
what the reason why the ox was to be stoned. \[6\] In the same: He that
blasphemeth the name of Jehovah slaying shall be slain; all the assembly
stoning shall stone him (Lev. 24:15); "to blaspheme the name of Jehovah"
signifies to do violence to the truths and goods of worship by means of
malevolent falsities. (That the "name of Jehovah" denotes everything in
one complex whereby Jehovah is worshiped, see n. 2724, 3006, thus
everything of faith and charity, n. 6674.) For this reason the son of
the Israelitish woman who blasphemed the name of Jehovah was brought
forth out of the camp and stoned (Lev. 24:11, 14, 23). It was also
ordered that those who served other gods should be stoned (Deut. 17:3,
5); and also those who incited others to serve other gods (Deut.
13:7-11). By "serving other gods" is signified profane worship, by which
true worship is extinguished. \[7\] If a damsel were married, and the
tokens of virginity were not found in her, she was to be stoned, because
she had wrought folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father's
house (Deut. 22:20, 21). This was because by "whoredom" was signified
the falsification of truth, thus its destruction (n. 2466, 4865). If a
man lay in a city with a damsel, a virgin betrothed to a man, they were
both to be stoned (Deut. 22:23, 24), for the same reason, namely,
because of whoredom, for spiritual whoredom is the falsification of
truth. \[8\] In Luke: They concluded among themselves that if they were
to say that the baptism of John was from heaven, He would say, Why did
ye not believe him? But if they said, From men, all the people would
stone them (Luke 20:5-6); where also "stoning" is predicated of what is
contrary to truth. The Jews desired to stone Jesus because He said that
before Abraham was, He was (John 8:58, 59); and this was because that
nation believed it to be false. It was the same when they desired to
stone Jesus because He said that He and His Father are one (John
10:30-33); for this they believed to be blasphemy, as is there said.
From all this it is now evident what "stoning" involves, and why it was
commanded, and also that the penalty of stoning being in Egypt from
ancient times, had been derived from the representatives of the Ancient
Church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7457.">7457.</span></span>

We will go a way of three days into the wilderness. That this signifies
that they would utterly depart so as to be in freedom, is evident from
the signification of "going a way of three days into the wilderness," as
being to utterly depart. That this is signified follows from what is
contained above in the internal sense, namely, that they could not
worship God in the neighborhood and presence of those who were from hell
(of which above, n. 7452, 7454-7456); thus that they would depart in
order to be in freedom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7458.">7458.</span></span>

And we will sacrifice to Jehovah our God. That this signifies that in
this way there would be worship, is evident from the signification of
"sacrificing to Jehovah," as being worship (of which above, n. 7393,
7452); and that there is worship when men are in freedom (n. 7349).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7459.">7459.</span></span>

As He hath said unto us. That this signifies as He has commanded, is
evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7460.">7460.</span></span>

And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, and ye shall sacrifice to Jehovah
your God in the wilderness. That this signifies that they would release
and not infest them so that they might worship their God in freedom, is
evident from the signification of "letting go," as being to release,
thus not to infest; and from the signification of "sacrificing to
Jehovah God," as being to worship their God (of which above, n. 7458).
That it denotes in freedom, follows; for it is said that they should
"sacrifice in the wilderness," consequently not so near as they had been
before. (That to be near denotes not to be in freedom, see n. 7454,
7456.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="7461.">7461.</span></span>

Only ye shall not go very far away. That this signifies although they
are in the neighborhood, is evident from the signification of "not going
far away," as being not to be at a distance, or far from the land of
Egypt.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7462.">7462.</span></span>

Supplicate for me. That this signifies that they should intercede, is
evident from the signification of "supplicating for him," when said by
Pharaoh to Moses, as being to intercede (as above, n. 7396).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7463.">7463.</span></span>

And Moses said, Behold I go forth from thee. That this signifies the
removal of the appearance of truth Divine among them, is evident from
the representation of Moses, as being the law Divine (see n. 6723,
6752), thus also truth Divine (n. 7014, 7382); and from the
signification of "going forth," as being removal (as above, n. 7404).
For by Pharaoh's calling Moses and Aaron is signified the presence of
truth Divine (n. 7451); and therefore here by "going forth from him" is
signified removal. As regards the presence and the removal of truth
Divine with the evil, be it known that truth from the Divine sometimes
appears to them, and this through the presence of an angel near them;
but truth from the Divine does not flow in with them through the
interiors, as with the good, because with them the interiors have been
closed; but it affects their exteriors only. When this happens they are
in fear, and from this in humiliation, for the presence of truth from
the Divine strikes them with dismay, and inspires them with fear as of
death; but when truth from the Divine is removed they return into their
former state and are devoid of fear. This is what is meant by the
presence of the appearance of truth Divine, and by its removal. This
also was represented by Pharaoh, in that when Moses was present he
humbled himself and promised to let the people go, that they might
sacrifice to Jehovah; but when Moses had gone forth from him he made
heavy his heart (verse 28); for as shown above, Moses represented the
law Divine, or truth Divine. \[2\] That the law Divine is the same as
truth Divine, is because the "law Divine" signifies the Word, and thus
truth Divine. That the "law" signifies the Word, and thus truth Divine,
is evident from the following passages: Jesus said, Is it not written in
your law, I said Ye are gods? If He called them gods unto whom the Word
was made, and the scripture cannot be broken (John 10:34-35); where
"written in the law" denotes in the Word, for it is written in David. In
the same: The multitude said, We have heard out of the law that Christ
abideth forever (John 12:34); this also was written in David. In the
same: Jesus said that the word might be fulfilled that is written in
their law, They hated Me without a cause (John 15:25); this also is in
David. In Luke: It is written in the law of the Lord that every male
that openeth the womb should be called holy to the Lord, and that they
should offer a sacrifice according to that which is written in the law
of the Lord; a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons (Luke 2:23-24,
39); this is in Moses. In the same: A lawyer tempting Jesus, said, What
shall I do to receive the heritage of eternal life? Jesus said unto him,
What is written in the law? How readest thou? (Luke 10:25-26). \[3\] In
the same: The law and the prophets were until John; from that time the
kingdom of God is evangelized: it is easier for heaven and earth to
pass, than for one tittle of the law to fall (Luke 16:16-17); besides
passages where the Word is called "the law and the prophets" (as Matt.
5:18; 7:12; 11:13; 22:40). In Isaiah: Bind together the testimony, seal
up the law for those whom I will teach (Isa. 8:16); "the law" denotes
the Word. In the same: Lying sons, sons that would not hear the law of
Jehovah (Isa. 30:9). He will set judgment in the earth, and the isles
shall hope in His law (Isa. 42:4); this is said of the Lord; "His law"
denotes the Word. In the same: Jehovah shall magnify His law (Isa.
42:21). Thus said Jehovah, If ye will not obey Me, to go in My law,
which I have set before you, and ye are hearing the words of My servants
the prophets (Jer. 26:4-5); where "the law" denotes the Word; besides
many other passages. From this it is evident that "the law" denotes the
Word, and because it denotes the Word, it denotes truth Divine, as in
Jeremiah: This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
after these days, said Jehovah; I will put My law in the midst of them,
and I will write it on their heart (Jer. 31:33); where "the law of
Jehovah" denotes truth Divine. \[4\] That "the law" in a wide sense is
the whole Word, in a less wide sense the historic Word, in a still less
wide sense the Word written by Moses, and in a narrow sense the
commandments of the Decalogue, see n. 6752. From all this it can now be
seen why it is said that Moses represents both the law Divine and also
truth Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7464.">7464.</span></span>

And I will supplicate unto Jehovah, signifies intercession, as above (n.
7396, 7462).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7465.">7465.</span></span>

That He may remove the noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and
from his people. That this signifies that there may be an end of this
state in respect to the falsities of malevolence, is evident from the
signification of "the noisome fly," as being falsities of malevolence
(see n. 7441); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who
are in falsities from evils and infest (of which above); and from the
signification of "his servants and his people," as being all and each
(n. 7396, 7441). To remove these falsities of malevolence from all and
each who infest, is to put an end to this state. Be it known that each
miracle done in Egypt signifies a peculiar state into which those come
who are in falsities and infest in the other life. There are ten states
into which they successively come before they are entirely stripped of
all truth, thus before they are cast into hell. For they who are in the
knowledge of faith, but in evil of life, are not after death at once
brought into hell, but successively. They are first convinced that they
are in evil, and afterward the knowledge of faith is taken away from
them, and at last they are left to the evil of their life. This is
effected by means of many successive states, and these states are what
are described by the miracles done in Egypt, consequently by the evils
which befell the Egyptians before they were immersed in the sea Suph.
These secrets cannot be known without revelation, but with the angels
they are among things well known.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7466.">7466.</span></span>

Tomorrow. That this signifies forever, see n. 3998, 7399.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7467.">7467.</span></span>

Only let not Pharaoh mock anymore in not letting the people go to
sacrifice to Jehovah. That this signifies provided he does not deceive
by a lie, and does not \[fail to\] leave them to worship their God in
freedom, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those
who are in falsities from evils and infest; from the signification of
"mocking," as being to deceive by a lie; from the signification of
"letting go," as being to leave; from the representation of the sons of
Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church; and from the
signification of "sacrificing to Jehovah," as being to worship their God
(see n. 7393, 7452, 7458), which must be done in freedom (n. 7454,
7456). From all this it is evident that by "only let not Pharaoh mock
anymore in not letting the people go to sacrifice to Jehovah," is
signified, provided he does not deceive by a lie, and does not \[fail
to\] leave those who are of the spiritual church to worship their God in
freedom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7468.">7468.</span></span>

And Moses went out from before Pharaoh. That this signifies the removal
of the appearance of truth Divine among those who are in falsities of
malevolence, is evident from what was said above (n. 7463).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7469.">7469.</span></span>

And he supplicated unto Jehovah, signifies intercession (as above, n.
7396, 7462).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7470.">7470.</span></span>

And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses. That this signifies that
it was so done according to the Word of the Lord, is evident from what
was unfolded above (n. 7406).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7471.">7471.</span></span>

And He removed the noisome fly from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from
his people. That this signifies the end of this state of falsity, is
evident from what was said above (n. 7465), where are like words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7472.">7472.</span></span>

There was not one left. That this signifies a full removal, is evident
without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7473.">7473.</span></span>

And Pharaoh made heavy his heart this time also. That this signifies
obstinacy again, is evident from the signification of "making firm,"
"hardening," and "making heavy the heart," as being obstinacy (see n.
7272, 7300, 7305).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7474.">7474.</span></span>

And he did not let the people go. That this signifies that they would
not leave those who were of the spiritual church is evident from the
signification of "letting go," as being to leave; and from the
representation of the sons of Israel, here "the people," as being those
who are of the spiritual church (see n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035,
7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223). \[2\] As regards the spiritual church,
which is here represented by the sons of Israel, be it known that it is
internal and external; and that those are in the internal church who are
in the good of charity, and that those are in the external church who
are in the good of faith. Those are in the good of charity who from
charity toward the neighbor see the truths which are of faith; but those
are in the good of faith who from faith look to charity, thus who do
what is good, not from the affection of charity, but from the obedience
of faith, that is, because it has been so commanded. It is these who are
here properly represented by the sons of Israel, for these are they who
in the other life are infested by those who are in falsities. Those who
are in the affection of charity cannot be so infested, for the spirits
who are in falsities and evils cannot approach those who are in this
good, because the Lord is in this good. If these are infested, it is
merely in respect to the fallacies and appearances through which they
have believed what is not true to be true, and also in respect to such
things as the doctrine of their church has taught for truths, which yet
are not truths. Such in the other life willingly reject falsities and
receive truths, because the good of charity is recipient of truth, for
it loves and desires it. \[3\] As infestations have been so often
mentioned, it is to be told what they are, and what is their nature.
Infestations are effected by means of injections of falsity against
truths, and these falsities are refuted in those who are being infested,
by means of an influx from heaven, that is, through heaven from the
Lord. In such a state are those held who are in vastation in respect to
falsities, until they are imbued with the truths which are of faith, and
by degrees with interior truths; and insofar as they are imbued with
these truths, so far they are liberated from infestation. Infestations
are not temptations, for temptations take place with anguish of
conscience, those who are in temptations being kept in a state of
condemnation, and hence of anguish and grief. \[4\] From all this it is
evident what is the nature of the vastations in the other life in which
are those who are in the good of faith. These vastations are vastations
of falsity. But vastations with those who have not been in the good of
faith, but in some truth of faith in the memory, while in a life of
evil, are vastations of truth. Those who are vastated in respect to
falsities, become successively imbued with the truths and goods of faith
and charity; but those who are vastated in respect to truths,
successively put off truths, and put on the evils which have been of
their life. From all this it can be seen what is meant in the Word by
"vastations" and "desolations."

<span class="margnote"><span id="7475.">7475.</span></span>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET MARS. The
spirits of the planet Mars appear to themselves as men such as they had
been in the world, and therefore they have to others a like appearance;
for everyone in the other life appears to others as he appears to
himself, because the perception is communicated. When I wondered at
this, they said that they cannot appear otherwise, because when they
lived in the world they knew that they were spirits clothed with a body,
and then thought little about their body, but only about the life of
their spirit in the body; and therefore when they come into the other
life they scarcely know that the state of life has been changed; and as
they then also think about the life of their spirit just as they did in
the world, they therefore appear to themselves like men. All spirits are
indeed in the human form, but not in one so strikingly like that in
which are the spirits of Mars; for with these the idea remains such as
they had in the world. Moreover, with those who when in the world know
and believe that in the other life they shall be in the human form, as
the body decreases, this thought increases; and therefore when they put
off the body which had served them for use in the world, from the idea
impressed upon them they remain to themselves in a like form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7476.">7476.</span></span>

The spirits of Mars are among those who are the best of all from the
earths of this solar system, for they are mostly celestial men, not
unlike those who were of the Most Ancient Church on this earth (of whom
see above, n. 1114-1125, and elsewhere). When their quality is
represented, they are represented with the face in heaven and the body
in the world of spirits; and those of them who are angels, with the face
toward the Lord and the body in heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7477.">7477.</span></span>

More than other spirits they acknowledge and adore our Lord; they say
that He is the only God, and that He rules both heaven and the universe,
and that all good is from Him; they said that it is the Lord who leads
them, and that He also frequently appears to them in their earth. That
the Lord rules both heaven and the universe is a truth known also to
Christians in this earth from His words in Matthew: All power has been
given unto Me in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18); but they do not so
believe it as do those who are from the earth Mars.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7478.">7478.</span></span>

Once when the Lord was mentioned, I saw that those spirits humbled
themselves so inmostly and profoundly that it cannot be described, for
in their humiliation they had the thought that of themselves they are in
hell, and that thus they are altogether unworthy to look to the Lord,
who is the Holy itself. They were so profoundly in this thought from
faith that they were as it were out of themselves, and in it they
remained on their knees until the Lord lifted them up, and then as it
were drew them out from hell. When they thus emerge from humiliation,
they are full of good and of love, and hence of joy of heart. When they
so humble themselves they do not turn the face to the Lord, for this
they dare not then do, but turn it away. The spirits who were around me
said that they never saw such humiliation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7479.">7479.</span></span>

I have spoken with some from that earth about the faith of those who
dwell there. They said that they there believe that there is nothing in
them but what is filthy and infernal, and that all good is of the Lord.
They even said further that of themselves they are devils, and that the
Lord draws them out and continually withholds them from hell. They
wondered that so many evil spirits were about me, and also spoke to me;
but it was given me to answer that this is permitted them for the
purpose that I may thus know their quality, and why they are in hell,
and that this is according to their life. It was also given me to say
that there were some among them whom I had known when they lived in the
world, and that they had then been in stations of great dignity,
although nothing but the world was in their hearts; but that no evil
spirit, even the most infernal, can do me any harm, because I am
continually protected by the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7480.">7480.</span></span>

I have been instructed that the spirits of Mars have relation to
something which is interior in man, and indeed intermediate between the
intellectual part and the will part, thus to thought from affection; and
they who are the best of them, to the affection of the thought. This is
the reason why their face makes a one with their thought, and why they
cannot dissemble before anyone (as was said of them above, see n. 7360,
7361).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7481.">7481.</span></span>

And because they have such a relation in the Grand Man, that middle
province of the brain which is between the cerebrum and the cerebellum
corresponds to them. For with those with whom the cerebrum and the
cerebellum have been conjoined in respect to spiritual operations, the
face acts as a one with the thought, so that from the face the very
affection of the thought shines forth; and from the affection, with some
signs also going forth from the eyes, the general of the thought shines
forth; and therefore when they were near me, I sensibly noticed a
drawing back of the front part of the head toward the hinder part, thus
of the cerebrum toward the cerebellum.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7482.">7482.</span></span>

Once when the spirits of Mars were with me, and occupied the sphere of
my mind, spirits from our earth came near and wished to infuse
themselves also into that sphere; but then the spirits of our earth
became as if insane, because they did not at all agree. For the spirits
of our earth look to themselves and the world, thus they are in an idea
turned to themselves; but the spirits of Mars look to heaven, thus to
the Lord and their neighbor, and hence are in an idea turned away from
themselves. From this cause there is contrariety. But then came near
some angelic spirits of Mars, by whose coming the communication was
taken away; and so the spirits of our earth retired.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7483.">7483.</span></span>

There was presented to me an inhabitant of that earth: his face was like
that of the inhabitants of our earth, but the lower part of the face was
black, not from a beard, which they have not, but from blackness in
place of it. This is also from correspondence. The blackness extended
itself on both sides up to the ears. The upper part of the face was
yellowish, like the faces of the inhabitants of our earth who are not
quite white.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7484.">7484.</span></span>

They said that they live on the fruits of trees, and especially on a
certain round fruit which springs up out of their ground, and also on
legumes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7485.">7485.</span></span>

They are clad with garments that they make from the bark fibers of
certain trees, which have such a strength that they can be woven, and
can also be glued together by a kind of gum which they have.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7486.">7486.</span></span>

Among other things they also said that on their earth they know how to
make fluid fires, from which they have light in the evening and night.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7487.">7487.</span></span>

The subject of the inhabitants and spirits of Mars will be continued at
the end of the following chapter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7488.">7488.</span></span>

Exodus 9 THE DOCTRINE OF CHARITY From all that has been said about the
loves of self and of the world, it is evident that all evils spring from
them, and because all evils spring from them, so do all falsities; and
on the other hand, from love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor
spring all goods, and because all goods spring from them, so do all
truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7489.">7489.</span></span>

This being the case, it is evident that insofar as a man is in the loves
of self and of the world, so far he is not in love toward the neighbor,
still less in love to the Lord; for these are opposites.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7490.">7490.</span></span>

It is also evident that insofar as a man is in the loves of self and of
the world, so far he does not know what charity is, until at last he
does not know that it exists; also that so far the man does not know
what faith is, until at last he does not know that it is anything; and
that so far the man does not know what conscience is, until at last he
does not know that it exists; nay, that so far the man does not know
what the spiritual is, nor what the life of heaven; and finally that he
does not believe there is a heaven and a hell; consequently he does not
believe that there is a life after death. These are the effects of the
loves of self and of the world when they reign.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7491.">7491.</span></span>

The good of heavenly love and the truth of its faith continually flow in
from the Lord, but are not received where the loves of self and of the
world reign; but on the contrary where these loves reign, that is, are
continually in the thought, are the end, are in the will, and make the
life, the good and truth which flow in from the Lord are either
rejected, or extinguished, or perverted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7492.">7492.</span></span>

With those with whom they are rejected, the good which is of love and
the truth which is of faith are held in contempt, and also in aversion.
With those with whom they are extinguished, the good of love and the
truth of faith are denied, and the contrary evils and falsities are
affirmed. But with those with whom they are perverted, the good of love
and the truth of faith are misinterpreted and are applied to favor evil
and its falsity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7493.">7493.</span></span>

The loves of self and of the world with man begin to reign when he comes
to years of discretion and self-government; for then the man begins to
think from himself or from his own, and to appropriate these loves to
himself, and this the more as he confirms himself in a life of evil.
Insofar as a man appropriates evils to himself, so far the Lord
separates the good of innocence and charity which the man has received
in infancy and childhood and at times afterward, and stores them up in
his interiors; for the good of innocence and the good of charity can in
no wise abide with the evils of these loves; and the Lord is not willing
that they should perish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7494.">7494.</span></span>

They therefore who either pervert or extinguish or reject in themselves
the good of love and the truth of faith, have no life in them; for the
life which is from the Divine is to will good and believe truth. But
they who do not will good but evil, nor believe truth but falsity, have
what is contrary to life. This contrary to life is hell, and is called
"death," and they are called "dead." That the life of love and faith is
called "life," also "eternal life," and that they who have it in
themselves are called "living men;" and that the contrary of life is
called "death," also "eternal death," and such men "dead," is evident
from many passages in the Word (as in Matt. 4:16; 8:21, 22; 18:8, 9;
19:16, 17, 29; John 3:15, 16, 36; 5:24, 25; 6:33, 35, 47, 48, 50, 51,
53, 57, 58, 63; 8:21, 24, 51; 10:10; 11:25, 26; 14:6, 19; 17:2, 3;
20:31; and elsewhere). EXODUS 9 1. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come
unto Pharaoh, and speak unto him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the
Hebrews, Let My people go, that they may serve Me. 2. For if thou refuse
to let them go, and if thou still withhold them, 3. Behold, the hand of
Jehovah shall be on thy cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on
the asses, on the camels, on the herd, and on the flock; a very grievous
pestilence. 4. And Jehovah shall sever between the cattle of Israel and
the cattle of the Egyptians, and there shall nothing die of all that
belongeth to the sons of Israel. 5. And Jehovah appointed a set time,
saying, Tomorrow Jehovah shall do this word in the land. 6. And Jehovah
did this word on the morrow, and all the cattle of the Egyptians died;
and of the cattle of the sons of Israel died not one. 7. And Pharaoh
sent, and behold there was not so much as one of the cattle of Israel
dead; and Pharaoh's heart was made heavy, and he did not let the people
go. 8. And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you in the
fullness of your fists ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it
toward heaven unto the eyes of Pharaoh. 9. And it shall be dust over all
the land of Egypt, and it shall be upon man, and upon beast, a sore
breaking forth in pustules in all the land of Egypt. 10. And they took
ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it
toward heaven; and it became a sore of pustules breaking forth on man
and on beast. 11. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because
of the sore; for the sore was on the magicians and on all the Egyptians.
12. And Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh, and he heard them not,
as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses. 13. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Rise
up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him,
Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Let My people go, that they
may serve Me. 14. For this time I will send all My plagues into thy
heart, and into thy servants, and into thy people; that thou mayest know
that there is no one as I in the whole earth. 15. For now I would put
forth My hand, and smite thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou
wouldest be cut off from the earth. 16. But yet for this cause have I
made thee to stand, that thou mayest see My power, and that My name may
be told in the whole earth. 17. As yet thou exaltest thyself against My
people, in thy not letting them go. 18. Behold, tomorrow about this time
I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in
Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. 19. And now send,
gather in thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; every man and
beast, that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought to the
house, and the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. 20.
He that feared the word of Jehovah of the servants of Pharaoh, made his
servants and his cattle flee unto the houses. 21. And he that did not
set his heart unto the word of Jehovah, left his servants and his cattle
in the field. 22. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand
toward heaven, and there shall be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon
man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field in the land of
Egypt. 23. And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven; and Jehovah
gave voices and hail, and the fire walked unto the land, and Jehovah
made it rain hail upon the land of Egypt. 24. And there was hail, and
fire walking at the same time in the midst of the hail, very grievous,
such as had not been like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a
nation. 25. And the hail smote in all the land of Egypt all that was in
the field, from man and even to beast, and the hail smote every herb of
the field, and broke every tree of the field. 26. Only in the land of
Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, was there no hail. 27. And
Pharaoh sent, and called Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have
sinned this time; Jehovah is just, and I and my people are wicked. 28.
Supplicate ye unto Jehovah, for there hath been enough of voices of God
and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. 29. And
Moses said unto him, As I go out of the city, I will spread out my palms
unto Jehovah; and the voices shall cease, and there shall be no more
hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is Jehovah's. 30. And thou
and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the face of Jehovah
God. 31. And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley was a
ripening ear, and the flax was a stalk. 32. And the wheat and the spelt
were not smitten, because they were hidden. 33. And Moses went out of
the city from before Pharaoh, and spread out his palms unto Jehovah; and
the voices and hail ceased and the rain was not poured out upon the
earth. 34. And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the voices had
ceased, and he sinned yet more, and made heavy his heart, he and his
servants. 35. And the heart of Pharaoh was made firm, and he did not let
the sons of Israel go; as Jehovah had spoken by the hand of Moses.

THE CONTENTS. In this chapter the subject of the vastation of those who
infest the men of the spiritual church is continued; and in it in the
internal sense is described the sixth, the seventh, and the eighth state
or degree of their vastation, which are described by the pestilence, the
sore breaking forth in pustules, and the rain of hail, whereby is
signified vastation in respect to the things that belong to the church
among them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7496.">7496.</span></span>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verses 1-7. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come unto
Pharaoh, and speak unto him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews,
Let My people go that they may serve Me. For if thou refuse to let them
go, and if thou still withhold them, behold, the hand of Jehovah shall
be on thy cattle which is in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on
the camels, on the herd, and on the flock; a very grievous pestilence.
And Jehovah shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of
the Egyptians, and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the
sons of Israel. And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow
Jehovah shall do this word in the land. And Jehovah did this word on the
morrow, and all the cattle of the Egyptians died; and of the cattle of
the sons of Israel died not one. And Pharaoh sent, and behold there was
not so much as one of the cattle of Israel dead; and Pharaoh's heart was
made heavy, and he did not let the people go. "And Jehovah said unto
Moses," signifies instruction anew; "Come unto Pharaoh, and speak unto
him," signifies the appearance of truth from the Divine with those who
infest; "Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews," signifies a command
from the Lord the God of the church; "Let My people go that they may
serve Me," signifies that they should leave those who are of the
spiritual church so that they may worship the Lord; "for if thou refuse
to let them go, and if thou still withhold them," signifies if they
should still be determined to infest; "behold the hand of Jehovah shall
be on thy cattle which is in the field," signifies the vastation of the
truth and good of faith which they have from the church wherein they had
been; "on the horses, on the asses, on the camels," signifies the
intellectual things and the memory-knowledges of the truth that is of
faith; "on the herd, and on the flock," signifies the things of the
will; "a very grievous pestilence," signifies a consumption in general;
"and Jehovah shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of
the Egyptians," signifies the difference between the truths and goods of
faith of those who are of the spiritual church, and the truths and goods
of faith which are of the church with those who infest; "and there shall
nothing die of all that belongeth to the sons of Israel," signifies that
they shall not be consumed; "and Jehovah appointed a set time,"
signifies predetermination; "saying, Tomorrow Jehovah shall do this word
in the land," signifies theirs forever in respect to the things that
belong to the truth and good of faith of the church; "and Jehovah did
this word on the morrow," signifies the effect according to the
predetermination; "and all the cattle of the Egyptians died," signifies
the consumption of the truth and good of faith with those who infest;
"and of the cattle of the sons of Israel died not one," signifies that
nothing of faith was consumed with those who were of the spiritual
church; "and Pharaoh sent, and behold there was not so much as one of
the cattle of Israel dead," signifies that this was made known to those
who infest; "and Pharaoh's heart was made heavy," signifies obstinacy;
"and he did not let the people go," signifies that they did not leave
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7497.">7497.</span></span>

And Jehovah said unto Moses. That this signifies instruction anew, see
above, n. 6879, 6881, 6883, 6891, 7226, 7304, 7380.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7498.">7498.</span></span>

Come unto Pharaoh, and speak unto him. That this signifies the
appearance of truth from the Divine with those who infest, is evident
from the signification of "coming" or "entering in" unto anyone as being
presence or appearance (of which below); and from the signification of
"speaking," as being communication; from the representation of Pharaoh,
as being those who infest in the other life those who are of the
spiritual church (see n. 7107, 7110, 7126, 7142, 7220, 7228, 7317); and
from the representation of Moses, who was to enter in unto Pharaoh and
speak unto him, as being truth from the Divine (see n. 6771, 6827, 7014,
7382). That "to come" or "enter in" denotes presence or appearance, is
because in the spiritual sense these phrases signify things that belong
to the mind, consequently to the thought; and when "coming" or "entering
in" unto anyone is said of the thought, it denotes to present him to
one's view, for he who thinks about anyone makes him present to himself;
and wonderful to say, in the other life he of whom anyone thinks with
longing to speak with him, is also presented to view. From this it is
evident that in the other life when spirits think as a man thinks in the
world, that which they think of is presented to the life. From this then
it can be known that by "coming" or "entering in" unto anyone is
signified presence or appearance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7499.">7499.</span></span>

Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews. That this signifies a command
from the Lord who is the God of the church, is evident from the
signification of "saying," as being a command (see n. 7036, 7107, 7310);
and from the signification of "the Hebrews," as being those who are of
the church, thus the church (n. 5136, 5236, 6675, 6684, 6738). (That
"Jehovah" when named in the Word denotes the Lord, see n. 1343, 1736,
2921, 3023, 3035, 5041, 5663, 6280, 6281, 6303, 6905, 6945, 6956.) In
the Word the Lord is called "Jehovah" as to Divine good, for Divine good
is the Divine Itself; and the Lord is called the "Son of God" as to
Divine truth, for Divine truth proceeds from the Divine good as a son
from a father, and also is said to be "born:" how this is shall be
further told. When the Lord was in the world He made His Human Divine
truth, and then called the Divine good which is Jehovah, His "Father;"
because, as just said, Divine truth proceeds and is born from Divine
good. But after the Lord had fully glorified Himself, which was done
when He endured the last of temptation on the cross, He then made His
Human also Divine good, that is, Jehovah; and thereby the Divine truth
itself proceeded from His Divine Human. The Divine truth is what is
called the "Holy Spirit," and is the holy which proceeds from the Divine
Human. From this is evident what is meant by the Lord's words in John:
The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John
7:39). That it is the Divine good which is called the "Father," and the
Divine truth which is called the "Son," see n. 3704.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7500.">7500.</span></span>

Let My people go that they may serve Me. That this signifies that they
should leave those who are of the spiritual church so that they may
worship the Lord, is evident from the signification of "letting go," as
being to leave (as frequently above); from the representation of the
sons of Israel, here "My people," as being those who are of the
spiritual church (see n. 4286, 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198,
7201, 7215, 7223); and from the signification of "that they may serve
Me," as being that they may worship the Lord. That "to serve" denotes to
worship, is evident; and that "Jehovah," whom they would serve, denotes
the Lord, see just above, n. 7499.
