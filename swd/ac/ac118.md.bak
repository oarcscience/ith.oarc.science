### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="5851.">5851.</span></span>

The same spirits do not remain constantly with a man, but are changed
according to the man's states, that is, the states of his affection, or
of his loves and ends, the former being removed and others succeeding.
In general there are with man spirits of such a quality as is the man
himself. If he is avaricious, there are spirits who are avaricious; if
he is haughty, there are haughty spirits; if he is desirous of revenge,
there are spirits of this character; if he is deceitful, there are the
like spirits. Man summons to himself spirits from hell in accordance
with his life. The hells are most exactly distinguished according to
evils of cupidities, and according to all the differences of evil. Thus
there is never any lack of spirits like himself to be called out and
adjoined to a man who is in evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5852.">5852.</span></span>

The evil spirits with man are indeed from the hells, but while they are
with him they are not in hell, but taken out from thence. The place
where they then are is midway between hell and heaven, and is called the
World Of Spirits, of which mention has often been made before. In this
world called the world of spirits there are also good spirits who
likewise are with man. Into that world also come men immediately after
death, who after tarrying a while there, are either sent away into the
lower earth, or are let down into hell, or taken up into heaven, each
one according to his life. In that world the hells are terminated above,
being there closed or opened at the good pleasure of the Lord; and in
that world heaven is terminated below; thus it is an interval that
distinguishes heaven from hell. From this it may now be known what the
world of spirits is. When evil spirits who are with man are in that
world, they are not in any infernal torment, but are in the delights of
the love of self and of the world, as also of all the pleasures in which
the man himself is; for they are in every thought and every affection of
the man; but when they are sent back into their hell, they return into
their former state.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5853.">5853.</span></span>

The spirits who come to a man enter into all his memory and into all the
memory-knowledges that he possesses. Thus they put on all things
belonging to the man, insomuch that they know no otherwise than that
these are their own. This is a prerogative that spirits have above man.
Hence it is that all things which the man thinks they think, and all
things which the man wills they will; and conversely, whatever the
spirits think the man thinks, and whatever the spirits will the man
wills; for they act as a one by conjunction. Yet on both sides it is
supposed that such things are in and from themselves, both on the part
of the spirits and on the part of the men. But this is a fallacy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5854.">5854.</span></span>

It is provided by the Lord that spirits should flow into what is thought
and willed by man, but angels into his ends, and thus through the ends
into all that follows from the ends. Angels also flow in through good
spirits into the goods of life and truths of faith with man, by means of
which they lead him away from evils and falsities as far as possible.
This influx is tacit, imperceptible to the man, but still operating and
efficient in secret. Especially do they avert evil ends and insinuate
good ones. But insofar as they cannot do this, they withdraw, and flow
in more remotely, and more absently, and then evil spirits come nearer;
for angels cannot be present in evil ends, that is, in the loves of self
and of the world, and yet they are present from afar. \[2\] The Lord
could through angels lead man into good ends by omnipotent force; but
this would be to take away the man's life, for his life consists in
entirely contrary loves. Therefore the Divine law is inviolable, that
man shall be in freedom, and that good and truth, or charity and faith,
shall be implanted in his freedom, and by no means in compulsion;
because what is received in a state of compulsion does not remain, but
is dissipated. For to compel a man is not to insinuate into his will,
because it is then the will of another from which he acts; and therefore
when he returns to his own will, that is, to his own freedom, this is
rooted out. The Lord therefore rules man through his freedom, and as far
as possible withholds him from the freedom of thinking and willing evil;
for unless man were withheld by the Lord, he would be continually
plunging into the deepest hell. \[3\] It was said that the Lord could
through angels lead man into good ends by omnipotent force; for evil
spirits can be driven away in an instant, even if there should be
myriads about a man, and this indeed by means of one angel; but then the
man would come into such torment and into such a hell that he could not
possibly endure it, for he would be miserably deprived of his life. For
the life of man is from cupidities and phantasies against good and
truth. If this life were not sustained through evil spirits and thus
amended, or at least led, he would be reduced to nothing and would not
survive a minute. For nothing else is seated in him than the love of
self and of gain, and of reputation for their sake, thus whatever is
contrary to order. Wherefore unless he should be reduced into order
moderately and by degrees, through the leading of his freedom, he would
at once expire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5855.">5855.</span></span>

Before the way was opened to me to speak with spirits, I was of the
opinion that no spirit or angel could ever know or perceive my thoughts,
because they were within me, and known to God alone. And then it once
happened that I observed that a certain spirit knew what I was thinking,
for he spoke with me about what I was thinking of, in a few words, and
gave an indication of his presence by a certain sign. At this I was
astounded, chiefly because he knew my thoughts. From this it was evident
how difficult it is for a man to believe that any spirit knows what he
is thinking, when yet he knows not only the thoughts which the man
himself knows, but also the least things of his thoughts and affections,
which the man does not know-nay, such things as the man can never know
during the life of the body. This I know from the continuous experience
of many years.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5856.">5856.</span></span>

Communications of societies with other societies are effected through
spirits whom they send forth and through whom they speak. These spirits
are called Subjects. When any society was present with me, I could not
know it until they sent forth a spirit, at the sending of whom
communication was at once opened. This is a very familiar thing in the
other life and is frequently done. From this it may be seen that the
spirits and angels who are with man, are for the sake of communication
with societies in hell and with societies in heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5857.">5857.</span></span>

I have sometimes spoken with spirits about the surpassing capacity they
have above men for putting on at their first coming all things of the
man's memory; and though they had previously known nothing of the
sciences, of the languages, and other things which the man has learned
and imbued from childhood even to old age, they nevertheless come in a
moment into possession of all; so that with the learned they are
learned, with the ingenious they are ingenious, and with the prudent
they are prudent. At these remarks, those spirits became elated, for
they were not good, and therefore it was given to tell them further that
with the ignorant they are ignorant, and with the stupid they are
stupid, with the insane and foolish they are insane and foolish; for
they put on all the interiors of the man with whom they are, thus also
his fallacies, phantasies, and falsities, consequently his insanities
and follies. But evil spirits cannot approach little children, because
these have not yet in their memory anything that evil spirits can put
on; and therefore with little children there are good spirits and
angels.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5858.">5858.</span></span>

From much experience it has been given me to know that whatever the
spirits think and speak from the memory of a man, they suppose to be
their own and in themselves. If they are told that this is not the case,
they are highly indignant-such is the fallacy of sense that prevails
with them. To convince them that such is not the case, they were asked
whence they knew how to speak with me in my mother tongue, and yet they
had known nothing at all of it during their life in the body, and how
they knew the other languages in which I am skilled, although from
themselves they did not know one; do they believe that these languages
are theirs? Moreover I read the Hebrew language before them, and they
understood it as much as I did-even little children-but no further. All
the knowledges also that are in my memory are in theirs. By this they
were convinced that when they come to a man, they come into possession
of all his knowledges, and that they are in falsity in believing them to
be their own. They have also their own knowledges, but are not permitted
to draw them out, to the end that they may serve man through his
knowledges-as well as for various other reasons, of which above (n.
2476, 2477, 2479), and because there would be the greatest confusion if
spirits were to flow in from their own memory (n. 2478).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5859.">5859.</span></span>

Some spirits came to me by ascending, and said that they had been with
me from the beginning, knowing no otherwise. But when I showed them to
the contrary, they at last confessed that they had now come for the
first time, but because they had at once put on all things of my memory,
they could know no otherwise. From this again it was evident that when
spirits come to a man they instantly put on all the man's
memory-knowledges as if they were their own; and also that when a number
of spirits are present, they each of them put on these knowledges, and
they each of them suppose that they are their own. Into this faculty
comes man immediately after death. Hence also it is that when good
spirits come into a heavenly society, they put on and possess all the
wisdom of all in that society-for such is the communion-and this
although in the life of the body they had known nothing whatever of such
things as are said in the heavenly society. This is the case if when in
the world they had lived in the good of charity, for this good is
attended with the appropriation to itself of everything of wisdom,
because this is secretly implanted in good itself; and it is from this
that they know as it were from themselves things which in the bodily
life had been incomprehensible and even unutterable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5860.">5860.</span></span>

The spirits who are with man also put on his persuasions, whatever these
may be, as has been proved to me by much experience. Thus they put on
man's persuasions not only in civil and moral things, but also in the
spiritual things of faith. From this it may be seen that the spirits
with those who are in heresies, in fallacies and illusions as to the
truths of faith, and in falsities, are in the like, with not the
slightest difference. The reason of this is that man may be in his
freedom, and not be disturbed by anything of the spirit's own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5861.">5861.</span></span>

From all this it is plain that during his life in the world a man is as
to his interiors, thus as to his spirit, in company with other spirits,
and is so adjoined to them that he cannot think anything or will
anything except together with them, and that thereby there is a
communication of his interiors with the spiritual world, and that in
this way and not otherwise can he be led by the Lord. When a man comes
into the other life he has with him his unbelief in there having been
with him any spirit, especially any from hell. There is therefore shown
him, if he desires it, the society of spirits in whose company he had
been, and from which emissary spirits had been with him. And then after
passing through some preliminary states, he at last returns to the same
society, because this society has acted in unity with the love which had
obtained the dominion with him. I have sometimes seen their societies
shown to them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5862.">5862.</span></span>

It is not known to the spirits with man, but only to angels from the
Lord, that they are with him, because they are adjoined to his soul or
spirit, and not to his body. Those things which from the thoughts are
determined into speech, and those which from the will are determined
into acts in the body, flow in order into act by general influx,
according to the correspondences with the Grand Man; and therefore the
spirits who are with man have nothing in common with these things: thus
they do not speak through man's tongue, which would be obsession; nor
see through his eyes, nor hear through his ears, what is in the world.
It is otherwise with me, for the Lord has opened my interiors so that I
might see the things in the other life: hence spirits have known that I
was a man in the body, and opportunity has been given them of seeing
through my eyes things in the world, and of hearing those speaking to me
who were in my company.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5863.">5863.</span></span>

If evil spirits perceived that they are with man, and that they are
spirits separate from him, and if they could flow into what is of his
body, they would try to destroy him in a thousand ways, for they hold
man in deadly hatred. And as they knew that I was a man in the body,
they were in a continual effort to destroy me, not only as to the body,
but especially as to the soul; for to destroy man and any spirit is the
very delight of life of all those who are in hell; but I have been
continually protected by the Lord. From this it is evident how dangerous
it is for man to be in living company with spirits, unless he is in the
good of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5864.">5864.</span></span>

As evil spirits have heard that spirits are with man, they have supposed
that so they might assail these spirits, and together with them man.
They have also sought them a long time, but in vain. Their intention was
to destroy them. For as the delight and bliss of heaven is to do good to
man, and to promote his eternal welfare, so on the other hand the
delight of hell is to do evil to man, and to contribute to his eternal
ruin. In such opposition are they.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5865.">5865.</span></span>

There was a certain spirit, not evil, to whom it was permitted to pass
over to a certain man and speak with me from thence. When he came to the
man he said that there appeared to him as it were a kind of black
inanimate something, or as it were a black lifeless mass. This was the
bodily life of the man, which he was permitted to view. It was said that
the bodily life of a man who is in the good of faith appears, when one
is permitted to view it, not black, but woody and of the color of wood.
The same was given me to know by another experience. A certain evil
spirit was let into the state of the body, by thinking from the sensuous
things of the body, thus from the external memory. He then seemed to me
as a black lifeless mass. When he was restored, he said that he had
supposed he was in the life of the body. In other cases spirits are not
allowed to look into the bodily things of man, for these are in the
world and its light, and when spirits look at those things which are of
the light of the world, these appear as mere darkness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5866.">5866.</span></span>

A continuation about the angels and spirits with man will be found at
the end of the following chapter. Genesis 45 1. And Joseph could not
restrain himself before all that were standing by him; and he cried,
Cause every man to go out from with me. And there stood not anyone with
him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. 2. And he gave
forth his voice in weeping; and the Egyptians heard, and the house of
Pharaoh heard. 3. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth
my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
in consternation before him. 4. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come
ye near to me I pray. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your
brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. 5. And now be not grieved, neither let
there be anger in your eyes, that ye sold me hither; for God did send me
before you to make to live. 6. For this two years the famine is in the
midst of the land; and there are yet five years wherein is no plowing
and harvest. 7. And God sent me before you to put for you remains in the
land, and to make you live for a great escape. 8. And now not you have
sent me hither, but God; and He set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for
lord to all his house, and I rule in all the land of Egypt. 9. Haste ye
and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus hath said thy son Joseph,
God hath set me for lord to all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not: 10.
And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto
me, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons, and thy flocks, and thy
herds, and all that thou hast: 11. And I will sustain thee there; for
there are yet five years of famine; lest thou be rooted out, thou, and
thy household, and all that thou hast. 12. And behold your eyes see, and
the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that with my mouth I am speaking unto
you. 13. And ye shall tell my father all my glory in Egypt, and all that
ye have seen; and haste ye and bring down my father hither. 14. And he
fell upon his brother Benjamin's necks and wept; and Benjamin wept upon
his necks. 15. And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and
afterward his brethren talked with him. 16. And the voice was heard in
Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren have come; and it was good in
the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants. 17. And Pharaoh
said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts,
and go, come ye into the land of Canaan; 18. And take your father, and
your households, and come unto me; and I will give you the good of the
land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. 19. And now
commanded, this do ye: take you out of the land of Egypt carts for your
babes, and for your women, and bring your father, and come. 20. And let
not your eye be sparing upon your stuff; because the good of the whole
land of Egypt, this is for you. 21. And the sons of Israel did so: and
Joseph gave them carts, according to the mouth of Pharaoh, and gave them
provision for the way. 22. And to all of them he gave to each changes of
garments; and to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and
five changes of garments. 23. And to his father he sent after this
manner: ten asses carrying of the good of Egypt, and ten she-asses
carrying grain and bread and nourishment for his father for the way. 24.
And he sent his brethren away, and they departed; and he said unto them,
Contend not in the way. 25. And they went up out of Egypt, and came into
the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father. 26. And they told him,
saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt.
And his heart failed, because he believed them not. 27. And they spake
unto him all the words of Joseph, which he spake unto them; and he saw
the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, and the spirit of Jacob
their father revived: 28. And Israel said, It is much; Joseph my son is
yet alive; I will go and see him before I die.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5867.">5867.</span></span>

The Contents. In the preceding chapter the subject treated of was the
internal man, which is "Joseph"-that it initiated into conjunction with
itself the external natural, or the ten sons of Jacob, through the
intermediate which is "Benjamin." In this present chapter the subject
treated of is the internal man-that it conjoined itself with the
external natural; but inasmuch as there is no conjunction therewith
except through spiritual good from the natural, which is "Israel,"
therefore it first prepares to adjoin to itself this good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5868.">5868.</span></span>

The Internal Sense. Verses 1, 2. And Joseph could not restrain himself
before all that were standing by him; and he cried, Cause every man to
go out from with me. And there stood not anyone with him, while Joseph
made himself known unto his brethren. And he gave forth his voice in
weeping; and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. "And
Joseph could not restrain himself before all that were standing by him,"
signifies that all things were now made ready by the internal celestial
for conjunction; "and he cried," signifies the effect near at hand;
"Cause every man to go out from with me," signifies that
memory-knowledges not in agreement and adverse should be cast out from
the midst; "and there stood not anyone with him, while Joseph made
himself known unto his brethren," signifies that there were not any such
knowledges present when the internal celestial through the intermediate
conjoined itself with truths in the natural; "and he gave forth his
voice in weeping," signifies mercy and joy; "and the Egyptians heard,"
signifies even to ultimates; "and the house of Pharaoh heard," signifies
through the whole natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5869.">5869.</span></span>

And Joseph could not restrain himself before all that were standing by
him. That this signifies that all things were now made ready by the
internal celestial for conjunction, is evident from the representation
of Joseph, as being internal good (see n. 5805, 5826, 5827), thus the
internal celestial, for by the celestial is meant the good which
proceeds from the Lord; and from the signification of "not being able to
restrain himself," as being that all things were made ready for
conjunction. For when anyone prepares himself with the utmost diligence
for some end, or effect, by getting together and arranging the means
conducive thereto, then when all things are made ready he can no longer
restrain himself. This is signified by the above words; for in the
preceding chapter initiation to conjunction was treated of, but in this
chapter conjunction itself (see n. 5867). By "all that were standing by
him," are signified such things as hinder conjunction, for which reason
they were cast out, as follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5870.">5870.</span></span>

And he cried. That this signifies the effect near at hand, is evident
from the signification of "crying," when it is before said that he could
not restrain himself, as being the effect near at hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5871.">5871.</span></span>

Cause every man to go out from with me. That this signifies that
memory-knowledges, not in agreement and adverse, should be cast out from
the midst, is evident from the signification of "every man from with
him," as being memory-knowledges, for the men were Egyptians, by whom
are signified memory-knowledges (see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 5700,
5702). That these were not in agreement and were adverse, follows,
because they were cast out. The case herein is this. When a conjunction
is being effected of the truths which are in the external or natural man
with the good which is in the internal, that is, when the truths of
faith are being conjoined with the good of charity, then all those
memory-knowledges which are not in agreement, and especially those which
are adverse, are rejected from the midst to the sides, thus from the
light which is in the midst to the shade which is at the sides; and then
they are partly not seen and partly regarded as of no account. But from
the memory-knowledges which are in agreement and harmonious, which
remain, there is effected a kind of extraction, and so to speak a sort
of sublimation, whence arises an interior sense of things, a sense which
is not perceived by man while he is in the body except by somewhat of
gladness, as the mind is gladdened by the morning of the day. Thus is
effected the conjunction of the truth which is of faith with the good
which is of charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5872.">5872.</span></span>

And there stood not anyone with him, while Joseph made himself known
unto his brethren. That this signifies that there were not any such
knowledges present when the internal celestial by means of the
intermediate conjoined itself with the truths in the natural, may be
seen from what was unfolded just above (n. 5871), thus without further
exposition.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5873.">5873.</span></span>

And he gave forth his voice in weeping. That this signifies mercy and
joy, is evident from the signification of "weeping," as being the effect
of mercy (see n. 5480); and also, as it is the effect of sadness, as
being the effect of love (see n. 3801), thus joy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5874.">5874.</span></span>

And the Egyptians heard. That this signifies even to ultimates, is
evident from the signification of "hearing," namely, the voice in
weeping, as being a perception of mercy and of joy; and from the
representation of the Egyptians, as being memory-knowledges (see n.
1164, 1165, 1186, 1462), thus ultimates, for the memory-knowledges with
man are his ultimates. That memory-knowledges are the ultimates with
man, namely, in his memory and thought, is not apparent, for it seems to
him as if they make the whole of intelligence and of wisdom. But it is
not so. They are only vessels containing the things of intelligence and
of wisdom, and indeed the ultimate vessels, for they conjoin themselves
with the sensuous things of the body. That they are ultimates is plain
to him who reflects upon his thought, when he inquires into any truth,
in that memory-knowledges are then present, but are not apparent; for
the thought then extracts what they contain (and this from very many
scattered here and there and even deeply hidden), and thus forms
conclusions; and the more interiorly the thought penetrates, so much the
farther does it remove itself from them. This may be manifest from the
fact that when man comes into the other life and becomes a spirit, he
indeed has with him memory-knowledges, but he is not allowed to use
them, for several reasons (n. 2476, 2477, 2479); and yet he thinks and
speaks concerning truth and good much more distinctly and perfectly than
in the world. Hence it may be seen that memory-knowledges are
serviceable to man for forming the understanding, but when the
understanding has been formed, they then constitute an ultimate plane in
which the man no longer thinks, but above it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5875.">5875.</span></span>

And the house of Pharaoh heard. That this signifies through the whole
natural, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the
natural in general (see n. 5160, 5799). Thus his "house" is the whole
natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5876.">5876.</span></span>

Verses 3-5. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my
father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were in
consternation before him. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come ye
near to me I pray. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your
brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. And now be not grieved, neither let
there be anger in your eyes, that ye sold me hither; for God did send me
before you to make to live. "And Joseph said unto his brethren,"
signifies that the internal celestial gave the faculty of perception to
truths in the natural; "I am Joseph," signifies manifestation; "doth my
father yet live," signifies the presence of spiritual good from the
natural; "and his brethren could not answer him," signifies that truths
in the natural were not yet in a state to speak; "for they were in
consternation before him," signifies commotion among them; "and Joseph
said unto his brethren," signifies the perception of the new natural;
"Come ye near to me I pray," signifies interior communication; "and they
came near," signifies the effect; "and he said, I am Joseph your
brother," signifies manifestation by means of influx; "whom ye sold into
Egypt," signifies the internal which they had alienated; "and now be not
grieved," signifies anxiety of the heart or of the will; "neither let
there be anger in your eyes," signifies sadness of the spirit or of the
understanding; "that ye sold me hither," signifies that they had
alienated to the lowest things; "for God did send me before you to make
to live," signifies spiritual life thence imparted to them of
Providence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5877.">5877.</span></span>

And Joseph said unto his brethren. That this signifies that the internal
celestial gave the faculty of perception to truths in the natural, is
evident from the signification of "saying," in the historicals of the
Word, as being perception (see n. 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3395,
3509, 5687, 5743), here to give the faculty of perception (of which in
what follows); from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal
celestial (of which just above, n. 5869); and from the representation of
the ten sons of Jacob, who are here the "brethren," as being truths in
the natural (n. 5403, 5419, 5458, 5512). Thus the internal sense is that
the internal celestial gave the faculty of perception to truths in the
natural. By "saying" is here signified to give the faculty of
perception, because in what now follows the subject treated of is the
conjunction of the internal celestial, which is "Joseph," with truths in
the natural, which are the "sons of Jacob," and when there is
conjunction there is given the faculty of perceiving, namely, through
the affection of truth, and thus of good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5878.">5878.</span></span>

I am Joseph, signifies manifestation, as is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5879.">5879.</span></span>

Doth my father yet live? That this signifies the presence of spiritual
good from the natural, is evident from the representation of Israel, who
here is the "father," as being spiritual good from the natural (see n.
5801, 5803, 5807, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); that it is from the
natural see n. 4286; and from the signification of "doth he yet live,"
as being the presence thereof. For Joseph's first thought when he
manifested himself was about his father, whom he knew to be living.
Wherefore Israel was first present in thought, and also continuously
afterward while Joseph spoke to his brethren. The reason is that the
conjunction of the internal celestial, which is "Joseph," cannot be
effected with the truths in the natural, which are the "sons of Jacob,"
except through spiritual good from the natural, which is "Israel." And
when conjunction is effected, then they are no longer the sons of Jacob,
but the sons of Israel, for the "sons of Israel" are spiritual truths in
the natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5880.">5880.</span></span>

And his brethren could not answer him. That this signifies that truths
in the natural were not yet in a state to speak, is evident from the
representation of the sons of Jacob, who are here Joseph's "brethren,"
as being truths in the natural (of which above, n. 5877); and from the
signification of "not being able to answer," as being to be not yet in a
state to speak, namely, from the truths with the internal. The case
herein is this. When the internal is being conjoined with the external,
or good with truth, there is then for the first time effected a
communication on the part of the internal with the external; but the
communication is not yet reciprocal. When it is reciprocal, there is
conjunction. Wherefore after Joseph had wept upon Benjamin's necks, and
had kissed all his brethren, it is said that then for the first time his
brethren talked with him (verse 15), whereby is signified that after
conjunction was effected, there took place a reciprocal communication by
virtue of reception.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5881.">5881.</span></span>

For they were in consternation before him. That this signifies commotion
among them, is evident from the signification of "being in
consternation," as being commotion, consternation being nothing else. By
commotion is meant a new disposition and setting in order of truths in
the natural, concerning which setting in order be it known that the
order in which memory-knowledges and truths are arranged in man's memory
is unknown to man, but when it pleases the Lord it is known to angels.
For it is a wonderful order. They cohere as in little bundles, and the
little bundles themselves cohere together, and this according to the
connection of things which the man had conceived. These coherences are
more wonderful than any man can ever believe. In the other life they are
sometimes presented to view, for in the light of heaven which is
spiritual such things can be exhibited to the sight of the eye, but not
at all in the light of the world. The memory-knowledges and truths are
arranged into these fascicular forms solely by the man's loves-into
infernal forms by the loves of self and of the world, but into heavenly
forms by love toward the neighbor and love to God. Wherefore while the
man is being regenerated, and conjunction is being effected of the good
of the internal man with the truths of the external, a commotion takes
place among the truths, for they then undergo a different arrangement.
It is this commotion which is here meant, and is signified by their
"being in consternation." The commotion then made, manifests itself by
an anxiety arising from the change of the former state, namely, from a
privation of the delight which had been in that state. This commotion
also manifests itself by anxiety concerning the past life-that internal
good and the internal itself had been relegated to the lowest
place-which anxiety is treated of in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5882.">5882.</span></span>

And Joseph said unto his brethren. That this signifies the perception of
the new natural, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being
perception (of which see above, n. 5877); and from the representation of
the sons of Jacob, as being truths in the natural (of which also above,
n. 5877), here the natural; for they who represent truths in the
natural, represent also the natural itself-as Pharaoh, who, as he
represents memory-knowledges in general, because he was king of Egypt,
also represents the natural itself in general (n. 5160, 5799). The
truths in the natural, and the natural itself, or the natural man
himself, act as a one, for truths are the contents, and the natural is
the containant; and therefore in the internal sense the containant is
now signified, and now the content, according to the series of the
things. The reason why the sons of Jacob here represent the new natural
is that in the internal sense is here described the act of conjunction,
which-to speak generally-is in accordance with the things that are
contained in the general explication; namely, that when there takes
place a conjunction of the internal with the external, or of good with
truth, there is first bestowed a capacity of perception that the man is
affected with truth and thus with good, and that then a commotion is
felt; next that an interior communication is given by means of influx;
and so on. From this it is plain that the natural which the sons of
Jacob here represent is the new natural, for its former state has been
changed (n. 5881).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5883.">5883.</span></span>

Come ye near to me I pray. That this signifies interior communication,
is evident from the signification of "coming near," as being to
communicate more closely, which when predicated of the external
relatively to the internal is to communicate more interiorly. A man
knows not that communication with the natural or exterior man is
interior and exterior, for the reason that he has not formed for himself
any idea of the internal man, and of its life being distinct from the
life of the external man. Of the internal man he has no other idea than
that it is within, not at all distinct from the external, when yet they
are so distinct that the internal can be separated from the external,
and can live the life which it lived before, but purer, which also
actually takes place when the man dies, for then the internal is
separated from the external, and the internal which lives after the
separation is what is then called the spirit. But this is the very man
himself who lived in the body, and also appears to himself and to others
in the other life like a man in this world, having his whole form, from
the head to the heel. And he is also endowed with the same faculties
with which a man in the world is endowed, namely, of feeling when he is
touched, of smelling, of seeing, of hearing, of speaking, and of
thinking; insomuch that when he does not reflect upon the fact that he
is in the other life, he supposes that he is in his body in the world,
as I have sometimes heard said by spirits. From these things it is plain
what man's internal and external are. If an idea be thus formed
concerning them, the things which have so often been said in the
explications about the internal and the external man will become
somewhat clearer, as well as what is meant by the interior communication
which is here signified by "Come ye near to me I pray."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5884.">5884.</span></span>

And they came near. That this signifies the effect, namely, that a more
interior communication was effected, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5885.">5885.</span></span>

And he said, I am Joseph your brother. That this signifies manifestation
by means of influx, is evident from the signification of "saying, I am
Joseph your brother," as being manifestation (as above, n. 5878). That
it was by means of influx, follows, because the internal acts in no
other way into the external, and now the more when a more interior
communication has been effected (n. 5883). Manifestation by means of
influx is, in respect to good, the noticing thereof through the
affection of truth, and is charity; but in respect to truth, it is the
acknowledgment thereof, and is faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5886.">5886.</span></span>

Whom ye sold into Egypt. That this signifies the internal which they had
alienated, is evident from the representation of Joseph, who is "he whom
they sold," as being the internal (see n. 5805, 5826, 5827); and from
the signification of "selling," as being to alienate (n. 4752, 4758). By
"Egypt" is here signified things lowest (as below, n. 5889); for to
account anything among memory-knowledges without acknowledgment is to
cast it out to the sides, thus to ultimate or lowest things. This also
is the case with man's internal at this day. This is indeed one of the
memory-knowledges, because it is known from doctrine that there is an
internal man, but it has been rejected to lowest things, because it is
not acknowledged and believed; so that it has been alienated, not indeed
from the memory, but from faith. That in the internal sense "to sell" is
to alienate the things of faith and charity, consequently those which
make a man of the internal church, may be seen from the fact that in the
spiritual world there is no buying or selling such as there is on earth,
but the appropriation of good and truth which is signified by "buying,"
and the alienation of them which is signified by "selling." By "selling"
is also signified the communication of the knowledges of good and of
truth, for the reason that by "trading" is signified the procuring and
communication of these knowledges (n. 2967, 4453), but in this case the
selling is said to be "not by silver." \[2\] That "to sell" denotes
alienation is evident from the following passages in the Word. In
Isaiah: Thus hath said Jehovah, Where is the bill of your mother's
divorcement, whom I have sent away? or who is there of My usurers to
whom I have sold you? Behold, for your sins ye have been sold, and for
your transgressions has your mother been sent away (Isa. 50:1); "mother"
denotes the church; and "selling," to alienate. In Ezekiel: The time is
come, the day is come near; let not the buyer be glad, and let not the
seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof. For the
seller shall not return to the thing that is sold, though their life be
yet among the living (Ezek. 7:12, 13); speaking of the "land of Israel,"
which is the spiritual church; the "seller" denotes him who had
alienated truths and had insinuated falsities. \[3\] In Joel: The sons
of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem have ye sold to the sons of the
Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their borders. Behold I
will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and I will
sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah,
who shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off (Joel 3:6-8);
speaking of Tyre and Sidon; "to sell" here also denotes to alienate. In
Moses: Their Rock hath sold them, and Jehovah hath shut them up (Deut.
32:30); "to sell" plainly denotes to alienate; "rock" in the supreme
sense is the Lord as to truth, in the representative sense it is faith;
"Jehovah" is the Lord as to good. \[4\] As in the spiritual sense "to
buy" is to procure for oneself, and "to sell" is to alienate, therefore
the kingdom of heaven is compared by the Lord to one who sells and buys,
in Matthew: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a treasure hidden in
the field; which when found, a man hideth, and in his joy he goeth away
and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. Again, the kingdom
of the heavens is like unto a merchant man seeking beauteous pearls; who
when he had found one precious pearl, went away and sold all that he
had, and bought it (Matt. 13:44-46); "the kingdom of the heavens"
denotes the good and the truth with man, thus heaven with him; "field"
denotes good; and "pearl," truth; "to buy" denotes to procure and
appropriate these to himself; "to sell all that he hath," denotes to
alienate his own which he had before, thus evils and falsities, for
these are of one's own. \[5\] In Luke: Jesus said unto the young prince,
Yet lackest thou one thing; sell all that thou hast, and distribute to
the poor, then wilt thou have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me
(Luke 18:22); in the internal sense by these words is meant that all
things of his own, which are nothing but evils and falsities, must be
alienated, for these things are "all that he hath;" and that he should
then receive goods and truths from the Lord, which are "treasure in
heaven." \[6\] In like manner what is said in the same: Sell your means,
and give alms; make you purses that wax not old, a treasure in the
heavens that faileth not (Luke 12:33); everyone sees that there is
another sense in these words, because for anyone to sell his means would
be at this day to make himself a beggar, and to deprive himself of all
capacity any longer to exercise charity, besides being unable to avoid
placing merit therein; and it is an established truth that there are
rich in heaven as well as poor. The other sense which is within these
words is that which was told just above. \[7\] As "to sell" signified to
alienate the things of the church, it was therefore the law that: A wife
married from the female captives, if she did not please, should be sent
away whither she would, but should not in any case be sold for silver,
and no profit be made of her, because he had afflicted her (Deut.
21:14); a "wife from the female captives" denotes alien truth not from a
genuine stock, but which may be adjoined in some way with the good of
the church appertaining to man; yet this truth if in some respects not
in agreement may be removed, but not alienated, because it has been in
some measure conjoined. This is the spiritual meaning of this law. \[8\]
So with the following law: If a man be found who hath stolen a soul of
his brethren of the sons of Israel, and hath made gain therein, and hath
sold him, the thief shall be killed, that thou mayest put away the evil
from the midst of thee (Deut. 24:7); "thieves of the sons of Israel"
denote those who acquire for themselves the truths of the church, not
with the end of living according to them, and thus teaching them from
the heart, but of making profit for themselves thereby: that such a
thief is damned is signified by its being said that "he shall die."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5887.">5887.</span></span>

And now be not grieved. That this signifies anxiety of the heart or
will, is evident from the signification of "grief," as being anxiety,
and indeed of the heart or will; for by the words, "Neither let there be
anger in your eyes," which immediately follow, is signified sadness of
the spirit or understanding. It is said of the heart or will, and of the
spirit or understanding, for the reason that the heart by correspondence
has relation to the things of the will, for it has relation to what is
celestial or to the good of love, and the spirit, <span
id="fr_138"></span>[5887-1](#fn_138.md) which is of the lungs, has relation
to the things of the understanding, for it has relation to what is
spiritual or to the truth of faith (see n. 3635, 3883-3896).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5888.">5888.</span></span>

Neither let there be anger in your eyes. That this signifies sadness of
the spirit or understanding, is evident from the signification of
"anger," as here being sadness, because like a repetition of a similar
thing, it follows the words "Be not grieved," whereby is signified
anxiety of the heart or will; for where in the Word there appears as it
were a repetition, one expression relates to the will and the other to
the understanding, or what is the same, one relates to the good of love
and the other to the truth of faith, and this on account of the heavenly
marriage, which is that of good and truth, in every detail of the Word
(see n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712, 5502); and from the
signification of "eyes," as being the understanding (n. 2701, 4403-4421,
4523-4534).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5889.">5889.</span></span>

That ye sold me hither. That this signifies that they had alienated to
the lowest things, is evident from what was unfolded above (n. 5886).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5890.">5890.</span></span>

For God did send me before you to make to live. That this signifies
spiritual life imparted to them of Providence, is evident from the
signification of "making to live," as being spiritual life (of which in
what follows); and from the signification of "God did send me before
you," as being of Providence. That it was of Providence is evident from
Joseph's dreams, in which it was foretold that his brethren should bow
themselves down to him, and also his father, which would not have been
foreseen unless it had been provided. That by "making to live" is
signified spiritual life, or new life through regeneration, may be seen
from this alone-that the spiritual of the Word cannot be anything else.
There is natural life and there is spiritual life. Natural life is meant
in the literal sense of the Word, but spiritual life in the internal
sense; and moreover in many passages by "to make to live," and by
"life," is meant in the literal sense spiritual life itself; as in
Ezekiel: When I shall say to the wicked, Dying thou shalt die; and thou
givest him not warning, nor speakest to dissuade the wicked from his
evil way, to make him live (Ezek. 3:18). Again: Ye have profaned Me
among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay
the souls that should not die and to make live the souls that should not
live. Ye strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should not return
from his evil way, by making him live (Ezek. 13:19, 22). In Hosea: After
two days Jehovah will make us live; and in the third day He will set us
up, that we may live before Him (Hos. 6:2). In David: Unless I had
believed to see good in the land of life (Ps. 27:13). In John: To him
that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the
midst of the paradise of God (Rev. 2:7). In John the Evangelist: As the
Father raiseth up the dead and maketh them live, even so the Son also
maketh live whom He will (John 5:21). Again: It is the spirit that
maketh to live; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto
you are spirit, and are life (John 6:63). In these passages "to make to
live," and "life," manifestly denote spiritual life, which is life in
heaven, and which is also called simply "life," as in Matthew: Strait
\[is the gate\] and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few
there be that find it (Matt. 7:14); "to enter into life" denotes to
enter into heaven (Matt. 18:8, 9; 19:17; Mark 9:43, 45, 47; John 5:24).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5891.">5891.</span></span>

Verses 6-8. For this two years the famine is in the midst of the land;
and there are yet five years wherein is no plowing and harvest. And God
sent me before you to put for you remains in the land, and to make you
live for a great escape. And now not you have sent me hither, but God;
and He hath set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his
house, and I rule in all the land of Egypt. "For this," signifies that
this is the case; "two years the famine is in the midst of the land,"
signifies a state of lack of good in the natural mind; "and there are
yet five years," signifies the duration of this state until remains
shine forth; "wherein is no plowing and harvest," signifies that
meanwhile good and the derivative truth will not appear; "and God sent
me before you," signifies that it was determined by the Divine
providence; "to put for you remains in the land," signifies the midst
and inmost of the church; "and to make you live," signifies spiritual
life thence for truths in the natural; "for a great escape," signifies
deliverance from damnation. "And now not you have sent me hither,"
signifies that they had not dismissed to the memory-knowledges which are
of the natural; "but God," signifies that the Divine did this; "and He
hath set me for a father to Pharaoh," signifies that now the natural is
from him; "and for lord to all his house," signifies that from him is
everything in the natural; "and I rule in all the land of Egypt,"
signifies that he arranges the memory-knowledges therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5892.">5892.</span></span>

For this. That this signifies that this is the case, is evident without
explication, for it is an expression which refers to what goes before
and what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5893.">5893.</span></span>

Two years the famine is in the midst of the land. That this signifies a
state of good in the natural mind, is evident from the signification of
"years," as being states (see n. 487, 488, 493, 893); from the
signification of "famine," as being a lack of good (for "bread" in the
spiritual sense is the good of love, and "food" is the good of truth,
and therefore "famine" is a lack of good, and "thirst" is a lack of
truth); and from the signification of "in the midst of the land,"
namely, of Egypt, as being the natural mind (see n. 5276, 5278, 5280,
5288, 5301). It is said "in the midst" because the "midst" is the inmost
(n. 1074, 2940, 2973), where good is. "Two years" denotes a state of the
conjunction of good and truth, because "two" signifies conjunction (n.
5194), here not yet conjunction, because they are two years of famine.
\[2\] The case herein is this. There must be truths in the natural mind
in order that good may work, and the truths must be introduced by means
of the affection which is of genuine love. All things whatever that are
in man's memory have been introduced by means of some love, and remain
there conjoined with it. So also it is with the truths of faith-if these
truths have been introduced by means of the love of truth, they remain
conjoined with this love. When they have been conjoined, then the case
is as follows. If the affection is reproduced, the truths which are
conjoined with it come forth at the same time; and if the truths are
reproduced, the affection itself with which they have been conjoined
comes forth at the same time. Wherefore during man's regeneration (which
is effected in adult age, because previously he does not think from
himself about the truths of faith) he is ruled by means of angels from
the Lord, by being kept in the truths which he has impressed upon
himself to be truths, and by means of these truths in the affection with
which they have been conjoined; and as this affection, namely, of truth,
is from good, he is thus led by degrees to good. \[3\] That this is so
is evident to me from much experience, for I have noticed that when evil
spirits have injected evils and falsities, then angels from the Lord
kept me in the truths which had been implanted, and thus withheld me
from evils and falsities. From this also it was plain that the truths of
faith, which have been inrooted by means of the affection of truth, are
the plane into which angels work. Wherefore they who have not this plane
cannot be led by angels, but suffer themselves to be led by hell, for
the working of the angels cannot then be fixed anywhere, but flows
through. But this plane cannot be acquired unless the truths of faith
have been put into act, and thus implanted in the will, and through the
will in the life. It is also worthy of mention that the working of the
angels into the truths of faith with man seldom takes place manifestly,
that is, so as to excite thought about this truth; but there is produced
a general idea of such things as are in agreement with this truth,
together with affection. For this working is effected by means of an
imperceptible influx, which when presented to the sight appears like an
inflowing light, which light consists of innumerable truths in good,
which encompass some single thing in the man, and keep him while in
truth also in the love of this truth. Thus the angels elevate the mind
of the man from falsities, and protect him from evils. But these things
are wholly unknown to the man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5894.">5894.</span></span>

And there are yet five years. That this signifies the duration of this
state until remains shine forth, is evident from the signification of
"five," as being remains (n. 5291); and from the signification of
"years," as being states (as just above, n. 5893). Duration is signified
by there being "yet" this number of years. From this it is plain that by
these words is signified the duration of this state until remains shine
forth. Remains are truths and goods stored in the interior man by the
Lord (see n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284, 5135,
5342). Here, remains are the acknowledgments and affections of truth
before good manifests itself. With good these shine forth. Meanwhile so
much is drawn from them as conduces to the use of life. Such is the
providence of the Lord, and this continually, although man knows nothing
whatever of it, nor indeed is willing to know. For he denies a
providence in the singulars, when yet it is in the veriest singulars of
all, from the first thread of man's life even to the last, and afterward
to eternity. With every man there is a concurrence every moment of more
things of providence than can be comprised in any number. This I know
from heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5895.">5895.</span></span>

Wherein is no plowing and harvest. That this signifies that meanwhile
good and the derivative truth will not appear, is evident from the
signification of "plowing," as being preparation by good for receiving
truths (of which in what follows); and from the signification of
"harvest," as being truths from good-for harvest is the already ripe
crop when it is being gathered, hence "harvest" is the truth which is
from good. Before this truth comes into existence, truths indeed appear,
but they are truths through which is good, and not truths from good. A
man who acts from truth is in truths through which is good, but he who
acts from good is in truths which are from good. That "plowing" is said
to denote good, is because a "field" which is plowed signifies the
church as to good (n. 2971), thus good which is of the church (n. 3310,
3317, 4982). Thus "plowing" is preparation by good for receiving truths;
moreover the oxen which were used in plowing signify goods in the
natural (n. 2180, 2566, 2781). \[2\] As this was the signification of
"plowing," it was forbidden in the representative church "to plow with
an ox and an ass together" (Deut. 22:10), which never would have been
forbidden except for some reason from within, thus from the spiritual
world. For otherwise what harm could there be in their plowing together?
and what the worthiness of such a law in the Word? The reason from
within, or from the spiritual world, is that "plowing with an ox"
signifies good in the natural, and "plowing with an ass" signifies truth
therein. (That an "ass" denotes the truth of memory-knowledge, thus
truth in the natural, may be seen n. 5492, 5741.) The interior or
spiritual reason of this command was that the angels could not have a
separate idea of good and truth, but they must be conjoined and make a
one; and therefore they were not willing to view such plowing by an ox
and an ass. The celestial angels are not even willing to think of truth
separate from good, for all the truth with them is in good; thus also to
them truth is good. For the same reason it was forbidden "to wear a
mixed garment, of wool and linen together" (Deut 22:11), for "wool"
signifies good, and "linen" truth. \[3\] That "to plow" and also "to
harrow," "to sow" and "to reap," signify such things as belong to good
and its truth, is manifest in Hosea: I will make Ephraim ride; Judah
shall plow, Jacob shall harrow for him; sow for yourselves according to
righteousness, reap according to piety; break up for you the fallow
ground: and it is time to seek Jehovah, till He come and teach
righteousness (Hos. 5:11, 12); "to ride" is predicated of Ephraim
because "to ride" is to enjoy understanding; and "Ephraim" is the
intellectual of the church; but "to plow" is predicated of Judah because
"Judah" is the good of the church. \[4\] In Amos: Shall horses run on
the rock? will one plow with oxen? that ye have turned judgment into
gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood (Amos 6:12); "shall
horses run on the rock?" denotes shall the truth of faith be understood?
for "rock" in the spiritual sense is faith (see preface to Gen. 22); and
"horses" are those things which are of the understanding (n. 2761, 2762,
3217, 5321); "will one plow with oxen?" denotes shall he do good? "oxen"
being good in the natural (n. 2180, 2566, 2781). That this could not be
done is signified by the words which follow: "because ye have turned
judgment into gall and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood." \[5\]
In Luke: Jesus said, No man putting his hand to the plow, but looking
backward, is fit for the kingdom of God (Luke 9:62). These words signify
the same as those which the Lord speaks in Matthew: He that is upon the
house, let him not go down to take anything out of his house; and he
that is in the field, let him not return back to take his garments
(Matt. 24:17, 18); the sense of these words is: he who is in good shall
not betake himself therefrom to the things that belong to the doctrinals
of faith (see above, where these words were unfolded n. 3652). Thus "he
who puts his hand to the plow" is he who is in good; "but looking
backward" is he who then looks to the doctrinal things of faith, and
thus forsakes good. It was on this account that Elijah was displeased
that Elisha, who was plowing in the field, when called, asked that he
might first kiss his father and mother; for Elijah said, "Go, return;
for what have I done to thee?" (1 Kings 19:19-21). In the opposite sense
"plowing" signifies the evil which blots out good, thus vastation; as in
Jeremiah: Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be heaps,
and the mountain of the house as the lofty places of the forest (Jer.
26:18; Mic. 3:12).

And God sent me before you. That this signifies that it was determined
by the Divine providence, is evident from the signification of "God sent
me before you," as being the Divine providence (see above, n. 5890).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5897.">5897.</span></span>

To put for you remains in the land. That this signifies the midst and
inmost of the church, is evident from the signification of "remains," as
being goods joined to truths stored up within man by the Lord (n. 468,
530, 560, 561, 660, 1050, 1906, 2284, 5135, 5342), here in the midst and
inmost of the church. It is said "the midst and inmost," because what is
inmost with man does occupy the midst in the natural where inmost and
interior things are together. In general, those things which are inmost
in those which follow one another in succession, the same are also in
the midst or center in those which, from these, are simultaneous, as is
the case in the natural; thus do inmost things arrange themselves in the
exterior ones. "To put for you remains in the land" implies that the
inmost of the church must be with the sons of Jacob; not that they would
be in the inmost, but that the representative of the church in all its
form might be instituted with them, and that the Word might be there.
These things are signified by the "remains" relatively to the church,
abstractedly from the nation. \[2\] "Remains," and also "residue," are
occasionally mentioned in the Word, but by both these expressions there
have been understood merely the remains and residue of a people or a
nation according to the letter; while it has been heretofore quite
unknown that in the spiritual sense they signify the goods and truths
stored up in the interior man by the Lord; as in the following passages.
In Isaiah: In that day shall the shoot of Jehovah be for honor and for
glory, and the fruit of the earth for magnificence and adornment to them
that are escaped of Israel. And it shall come to pass that he that
remaineth in Zion, and he that is left \[residuus\] in Jerusalem, shall
be called holy, everyone that is written unto life in Jerusalem (Isa.
4:2, 3); "they that remained in Zion, and they that were left in
Jerusalem" were in no wise made holy nor more than others written unto
life; whence it is clear that by "those who remained and who were left"
are meant the things that are holy and that are written unto life. These
are goods conjoined with truths and stored up in the interior man by the
Lord. \[3\] In the same: In that day the remains of Israel, and they
that are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more lean on their
smiter, but shall lean on Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth. The
remains shall return, the remains of Jacob, unto the mighty God (Isa.
10:20, 21); that the "remains" are not the remains of any people or
nation may be seen from the fact that in the Word, especially the
prophetic Word, by "Israel" was not meant Israel, nor by "Jacob" Jacob,
but by both the church and what is of the church. And this being the
case, by the "remains" are not meant the remains of Israel and Jacob,
but the truths and goods which belong to the church. Yea, neither do the
"remains of a people," and the "residue of a nation" (when it is so
said), signify the remains of any people or the residue of any nation,
because by "people" in the internal sense are signified truths (n. 1259,
1260, 3295, 3581), and by "nation" goods (n. 1259, 1260, 1416). That it
has been unknown, and appears strange, that by "remains" are signified
truths and goods, is because the literal sense, especially where it is
historical, withdraws and forcibly withholds from thinking things like
these. \[4\] In the same: Then there shall be a path for the remains of
the people, which shall be left \[residuae\] from Asshur; as there was
for Israel through the sea, when he came up out of the land of Egypt
(Isa. 11:16); where the meaning is similar; "they that are left from
Asshur" being those who have not been destroyed through perverse
reasonings (that "Asshur" is such reasonings, see n. 1186). Again: In
that day shall Jehovah Zebaoth be for a crown of ornament, and for a
diadem of comeliness, to the remains of His people (Isa. 28:5). Again:
Moreover the escape of the house of Judah which is left \[residua\],
shall again take root downward, and yield fruit upward. For out of
Jerusalem shall go forth remains, and out of Mount Zion they that escape
(Isa. 36:31, 32). Again: Butter and honey shall everyone eat that is
left \[residuus\] in the midst of the land (Isa. 7:22). In Jeremiah: I
will gather together the remains of My flock out of all the lands
whither I have scattered them, and I will bring them back to their fold,
that they may bring forth and be multiplied (Jer. 23:3). Again: The
people of those left \[residuorum\] by the sword found grace in the
wilderness in going to give rest to him, to Israel (Jer. 31:2); "the
people of those left by the sword in the wilderness" were they who were
called "infants," who the rest being dead, were brought into the land of
Canaan. These "infants" were the residue, and by them were signified the
goods of innocence, and by their introduction into the land of Canaan
was represented admission into the Lord's kingdom. \[5\] In Ezekiel: I
will make a residue, when ye shall have some that escape the sword among
the nations, when ye shall be scattered in the earth. Then they that
escape of you shall remember Me among the nations where they shall be
captives (Ezek. 6:8, 9). The reason why the goods and truths stored up
by the Lord in man's interiors were represented by the "residue and the
remains among the nations whither they were scattered and where they
were made captives," is that man is continually among evils and
falsities, and is held in captivity by them. Evils and falsities are
what are signified by the "nations." The external man, when separated
from the internal, is altogether in these, and therefore unless the Lord
were to gather up the goods and truths which as occasion offers are
insinuated into a man during the progress of life, the man could not
possibly be saved, for without remains there is salvation for none.
\[6\] In Joel: It shall come to pass that everyone who shall call on the
name of Jehovah shall escape; for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there
shall be those who escape, as Jehovah hath said, and among the residue
whom Jehovah doth call (Joel 2:32). In Micah: There shall be remains of
Jacob among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among
the beasts of the forest (Mic. 5:8). In Zephaniah: The remains of Israel
shall not do perversity, nor speak a lie; neither shall a tongue of
deceit be found in their mouth: they shall feed and be at rest, none
making afraid (Zeph. 3:13); in this passage are described remains in
respect to their quality, and it is known that this quality never
belonged to the people called "Israel." From this also it is manifest
that by "remains" are meant other things; and that these are goods and
truths is clear, because these are what do no perversity, nor speak a
lie, neither is a tongue of deceit found in their mouth. \[7\] In
Zechariah: The streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
playing in the streets thereof; which shall be marvelous in the eyes of
the remains of My people: now, not as in former days, am I to the
remains of this people, for it is a seed of peace; the vine will yield
its fruit, and the earth will yield its increase, and the heavens will
yield their dew; and I will make the remains of this people heirs of all
these things (Zech. 8:5, 6, 11, 12); the remains are here called a "seed
of peace," but it is they who are in truths of good whose fruitfulness
is described by "the vine shall yield its fruit, the earth its increase,
and the heavens their dew." \[8\] The remains which are meant in the
spiritual sense, are closed up by evils of life and by persuasions of
falsity, so as no longer to appear; and by the denial of truth which had
previously been acknowledged (both of these acts being from affection),
they are consumed, for this is the commingling of truth and falsity
which is called profanation. Of these things we read in the Word, in
Isaiah: He shall remove man, and the deserts shall be multiplied in the
midst of the land: scarcely any longer is there in it a tenth part, and
yet it shall be for exterminating (Isa. 6:12, 13); that "ten" denotes
remains, see n. 276, 1906, 2284. Again: I will kill thy root, and he
shall kill them that are left of thee (Isa. 14:30); speaking of the
Philistines, who are those in the mere knowledge of knowledges, and not
in life (n. 1197, 1198, 3412, 3413); those who are left are called a
"root," because from them, as from a root, grow forth goods and truths,
which make man to be man. Wherefore "he shall remove man" (as just above
in Isaiah) denotes to destroy remains. \[9\] In Jeremiah: The young men
shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by
famine; and there shall be no remains unto them (Jer. 11:22, 23);
speaking of the men of Anathoth. Again: I will take the remains of
Judah, who have set their faces to come into the land of Egypt to
sojourn there, that they be all consumed; and there shall not be an
escaper, or one left to the remains of Judah, who have come to dwell in
the land of Egypt (Jer. 44:12, 14, 28); the reason why they who were of
Judah should not sojourn in Egypt, nor dwell there, and that this was so
severely forbidden them, was that the tribe of Judah represented the
Lord's celestial church, and the celestial are utterly unwilling to know
about the memory-knowledges which are signified by "Egypt;" for they
know all things from the celestial good in which they are, which good
would perish if they were to betake themselves to memory-knowledges.
Nay, they who are of the Lord's celestial kingdom, being in celestial
good (and celestial truth being charity, while spiritual truth is
faith), are not willing even to mention faith, lest they should "go
down" from good and "look backward" (see n. 202, 337, 2715, 3246, 4448).
This also is what is meant by the words: He that is upon the house, let
him not go down to take anything out of the house; and he that is in the
field, let him not return back to take his garments (Matt. 24:17, 18);
see just above (n. 5895); and also by these words: Remember Lot's wife
(Luke 17:32); who looked back and became a pillar of salt. (In regard to
looking and returning back, see n. 2454, 3652.) \[10\] By the nations
which were so accursed that there was not even any residue left, was
represented that iniquity was so consummated with them that nothing of
good and truth survived, thus that there were no remains; as in Moses:
They smote Og the king of Bashan, and all his sons, and all his people,
until they left no residue (Num. 21:35; Deut. 3:3). Again: They took all
the cities of Sihon, and gave to the curse every city of man, and the
women, and the little child; they left no residue (Deut. 2:34). So in
other passages where it is written that they were "given to the curse."
\[11\] In regard to remains, or the goods and truths stored up in man's
interiors by the Lord, the case is this. When a man is in good and truth
from affection, thus from freedom, then good and truth are implanted.
And when this takes place, the angels from heaven approach nearer and
conjoin themselves with the man. It is this conjunction which causes the
goods with truths to come forth in the man's interiors. But when a man
is in things external, as when he is in worldly and bodily things, then
the angels are removed, and when they are removed, then nothing at all
of these goods and truths appears. Nevertheless as conjunction has once
been effected, the man is in the capacity for conjunction with the
angels, thus with the good and truth appertaining to them; but this
conjunction does not take place oftener and further than is
well-pleasing to the Lord, who disposes these things according to every
use of the man's life.

And to make you live. That this signifies spiritual life thence for
truths in the natural, is evident from the signification of "to make
live," as being spiritual life (see n. 5890). As everything of spiritual
life is from remains, therefore it is said spiritual life thence. And
because it is thence, therefore immediately after what is said about
remains, it is also said "to make you live," namely the truths in the
natural which are represented by the sons of Jacob (see n. 5403, 5419,
5427, 5458, 5512).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5899.">5899.</span></span>

For a great escape. That this signifies deliverance from damnation, is
evident from the signification of "escape," as being deliverance from
damnation, which deliverance is effected by means of remains, that is,
by means of the goods and truths stored up with man by the Lord. They
who receive these goods and truths, that is, who allow them to be
implanted in their interiors, escape damnation, and are among the
residue. Hence it is that mention is made of "escape" in the Word
throughout where a "residue" and "remains" are spoken of, as here by
Joseph, and also in other places; as in Isaiah: In that day the fruit of
the earth shall be for magnificence and ornament for the escape of
Israel; and it shall come to pass, that he that remaineth in Zion, and
he that is left in Jerusalem, shall be called holy (Isa. 4:2, 3). Again:
In that day the remains of Israel, and the escape of the house of Jacob,
shall no more lean upon their smiter (Isa. 10:20). Again: Moreover the
escape of the house of Judah that are left shall again take root
downward, and yield fruit upward; for out of Jerusalem shall go forth
remains, and out of Mount Zion an escape (Isa. 37:31, 32). In Ezekiel: I
will make a residue, when ye shall have some that escape the sword among
the nations, when ye shall be scattered in the earth; then they that
escape of you shall remember Me (Ezek. 6:8, 9). In Joel: It shall come
to pass that he who shall call on the name of Jehovah shall escape;
because in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be an escape, as
Jehovah hath said, and among the residue whom Jehovah doth call (Joel
2:32). In Jeremiah: There shall not be an escaper, or one left to the
remains of Judah (Jer. 44:12, 14). From these passages it is plain what
it is "to escape," namely, that they who "escape" are they who have
remains, and that "to escape" is to be delivered from damnation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5900.">5900.</span></span>

And now not you sent me hither. That this signifies that they had not
dismissed to the memory-knowledges which are of the natural, is evident
from the signification of "Egypt," which is "hither," where he was sent,
as being the memory-knowledges which are in the natural (see n. 1164,
1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966, 5700). That "not you sent me,"
denotes that they did not dismiss is evident.
