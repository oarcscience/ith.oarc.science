### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="5601.">5601.</span></span>

And we told him according to the mouth of these words. That this
signifies that he perceived them conformably, is evident from the
signification of "telling," as being to perceive (see n. 3608), for in
the spiritual world or in heaven they have no need to tell what they
think, there being a communication of all thoughts (n. 5597), and
therefore in the spiritual sense "telling" signifies perceiving; and
from the signification of "according to these words," as being
conformably; for they are the things he desired to perceive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5602.">5602.</span></span>

Knowing could we know that he would say, Bring your brother down? That
this signifies that we did not believe that he desired the truth of good
to be conjoined with himself, is evident from the signification of
"knowing could we know that he would say," as being not to believe; and
from the representation of Benjamin, who is here the "brother," as being
the truth of good (of which just above, n. 5600). That this was to be
conjoined with him is signified by their "bringing him down," as is
plain from what was said above (n. 5596).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5603.">5603.</span></span>

And Judah said unto Israel his father. That this signifies perception
from the good of the church concerning these things, is evident from the
signification of "saying" in the historicals of the Word, as being to
perceive (of which often above); from the representation of Judah, as
being the good of the church (see n. 5583); and from the representation
of Israel, as being the internal spiritual church (n. 3305, 4286). From
this it is plain that by "Judah's saying to Israel his father" is
signified the perception of the church from its good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5604.">5604.</span></span>

Send the boy with me. That this signifies that he should be adjoined to
him, namely, to the good of the church which is represented by Judah, is
evident from the signification of "sending with him," as being to be
adjoined to him, and not to the others; for it is said in what follows
"I will be surety for him, of my hand shalt thou require him;" and from
the representation of Benjamin, who is here the "boy," as being interior
truth (of which just above, n. 5600). This is called the "boy," because
that which is interior is in the Word called relatively a "boy," for the
reason that there is more innocence in the interior than in the
exterior, and innocence is signified by an "infant," and also by a "boy"
(n. 5236).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5605.">5605.</span></span>

And we will arise and go, and we will live, and not die. That this
signifies spiritual life according to degrees, is evident from the
signification of "arising," as being elevation to higher or interior
things, consequently to the things of spiritual life (see n. 2401, 2785,
2912, 2927, 3171, 4103, 4881); from the signification of "going," as
being to live (n. 3335, 3690, 4882, 5493), and as the words follow "and
we will live," "going" signifies the first spiritual life; from the
signification of "living," as being spiritual life, for no other life is
meant in the internal sense of the Word; and from the signification of
"not dying," as being no longer to be damned, that is, to be out of a
state of damnation, for in the internal sense of the Word no other than
spiritual death is meant, which is damnation. From this it is plain that
by "we will arise and go, and we will live and not die" is signified
life according to degrees; namely, introduction into life by "arising,"
the first of life by "going," life itself by "living," and being led out
from the things of no life by "not dying." \[2\] That "to go" in the
internal sense is to live, seems strange to him who knows nothing about
spiritual life; but it is like "journeying," which denotes the order of
life and what is successive of life (n. 1293, 4375, 4554, 4585), and
like "sojourning," which denotes to be instructed and to live
accordingly (n. 1463, 2025, 3672). The reason why "going," "journeying,"
and "sojourning" have these significations might indeed be told, but the
reason is of such a nature as could scarcely be accepted by those who
are ignorant of the nature of movements in the other life. Movements and
progressions there are nothing else-because from no other source-than
changes of the state of life. These changes appear in externals exactly
like progressions from place to place. That this is so can be confirmed
by much experience in the other life; for I have walked there in spirit
with them and among them, through many of their abodes, and this though
in body I remained in the same place. I have also talked with them as to
how this could be, and have been informed that it is the changes of the
state of life that make progressions in the spiritual world. \[3\] This
was also confirmed by the fact that by means of changes induced on their
states, spirits can appear on high, and then in a moment beneath, or now
far to the west, and in a moment to the east, and so on. But as before
said this cannot but seem strange to him who knows nothing about life in
the spiritual world; for there are no spaces or times there, but states
of life instead. These states produce in externals a most living
appearance of progressions and motions. The appearance is as living and
real as that life itself is in us and therefore our own, when yet life
flows in from the Lord, who is the fountain of all life (see n. 2021,
2658, 2706, 2886-2888, 3001, 3318, 3337-3338, 3484, 3619, 3741-3743,
4151, 4249, 4318-4320, 4417, 4523, 4524, 4882). As "going" and "moving"
signify living, it was therefore said by the ancients, that "in God we
move, live, and have our being" \[Acts 17:28\]; and by "moving" they
meant the external of life, by "living" its internal, and by "being" its
inmost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5606.">5606.</span></span>

Both we. That this signifies the external of the church, is manifest
from the representation of the ten sons of Jacob, who here are "we," as
being the external of the church (see n. 5469).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5607.">5607.</span></span>

And thou. That this signifies its internal, is evident from the
representation of Israel, who here is "thou," as being the internal of
the church (see n. 4286, 4292, 4570).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5608.">5608.</span></span>

And also our little ones. That this signifies the things still more
interior, is evident from the signification of "little ones," as being
the things which are interior (see n. 5604). That more interior things
are signified by "little children" and by "boys," is because innocence
is signified by both, and innocence is what is inmost. In the heavens
the inmost or third heaven consists of those who are in innocence, for
they are in love to the Lord; and because the Lord is innocence itself,
therefore they who are there, being in love to Him, are in innocence.
These, although they are the wisest of all in the heavens, yet appear to
others like little children. It is for this reason, and also because
little children are in innocence, that by "little children" in the Word
is signified innocence. \[2\] As the inmost of the heavens is innocence,
therefore that which is interior with all in the heavens must be
innocence. This is like successive things in relation to those which
exist together, or like the things which are distinct from one another
by degrees in relation to those which exist from them; for all that
which exists simultaneously, springs from that which is successive. When
the former exists from the latter, the parts place themselves in the
same order as that in which they had before been distinguished by
degrees; as, by way of illustration, end, cause, and effect are in
succession and distinct from one another; and when they exist together
they place themselves in the same order, the end as inmost, the cause
next, and the effect last. The effect is coexisting, and is such that
unless there is in it a cause, and in the cause an end, there is no
effect, because if from the effect you remove the cause you destroy the
effect, and still more if from the cause you remove the end; for from
the end the cause has what makes it a cause, and from the cause the
effect has what makes it an effect. \[3\] So also it is in the spiritual
world: just as the end, cause, and effect are distinct from one another,
so in the spiritual world are love to the Lord, charity toward the
neighbor, and the works of charity. When these three become one or exist
together, the first must be in the second, and the second in the third.
And also as in the works of charity: unless charity from affection or
the heart is within them, they are not works of charity; and unless love
to God is within charity, it is not charity. Therefore if you take away
that which is interior, the exterior falls; for the exterior comes into
existence and subsists from its interiors in order. So is it with
innocence. This makes one with love to the Lord, and unless it is within
charity it is not charity; consequently unless charity in which there is
innocence is within the works of charity they are not works of charity.
Hence it is that innocence must be within all who are in the heavens.
\[4\] That this is so, and that innocence is signified by "little
children," is evident in Mark: Jesus said to the disciples, Suffer the
little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of such is the
kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the
kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein. And taking
them up in His arms, he put His hand upon them, and blessed them (Mark
10:14-16; Luke 18:15-17; Matt. 18:3). It is evident that by "little
children" is here signified innocence, because with little children
there is innocence, and because those who are innocent appear in heaven
as little children. \[5\] No one can enter heaven unless he has somewhat
of innocence (see n. 4797); and moreover little children suffer
themselves to be governed by angels who are forms of innocence, and not
as yet by what is their own, as is the case with adults who govern
themselves by their own judgment and will. That little children suffer
themselves to be governed by angels is evident from the Lord's words in
Matthew: See that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say to
you, that their angels in the heavens do always behold the face of My
Father (Matt. 18:10); no one can "see the face" of God except from
innocence. \[6\] In the following passages also innocence is signified
by "infants" or "little children." In Matthew: Out of the mouth of babes
and suckling, Thou hast perfected praise (Matt. 21:16; Ps. 8:2). Again,
Thou hast hid these things from the wise and the intelligent, and hast
revealed them unto babes (Matt. 11:25; Luke 10:21); for innocence, which
is signified by "babes," is wisdom itself, because genuine innocence
dwells in wisdom (n. 2305-2306, 4797). For this reason it is said, "out
of the mouth of babes and sucklings Thou hast perfected praise," and
also that such things have been "revealed unto babes." \[7\] In Isaiah:
The cow and the bear shall feed, their young ones shall lie down
together, and the suckling shall play on the hole of the viper (Isa.
11:7-8); speaking of the Lord's kingdom, and specifically of the state
of peace or innocence therein. A "suckling" denotes innocence; that
nothing of evil can befall those who are in innocence is signified by a
"suckling playing on the hole of a viper"; "vipers" are they who are
most crafty. This chapter plainly relates to the Lord. In Joel: Sound
the trumpet in Zion, gather the people, sanctify the congregation,
assemble the elders, gather the babes and those that suck the breasts
(Joel 2:15-16); "elders" denotes the wise; "babes and those that suck
the breasts," the innocent. \[8\] In the following passages also by
"infants" is meant innocence, but in these that it was destroyed. In
Jeremiah: Wherefore commit ye great evil against your souls, to cut off
from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the midst of Judah,
so that I shall leave you no remains? (Jer. 44:7). Again: Lift up thy
hands to Him upon the soul of thy little children, that faint for hunger
in the head of all the streets (Lam. 2:19). In Ezekiel: Pass through
Jerusalem, and smite, let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity, the
old man, the young man, and the maiden, and the little child (Ezek.
9:5-6). In Micah: The women of My people ye drive out of everyone's
house of delights, from the babes thereof they take away Mine honor
forever (Micah 2:9). \[9\] As regards the innocence of little children
however, it is only external and not internal; and because it is not
internal it cannot be conjoined with any wisdom. But the innocence of
the angels, especially those of the third heaven, is internal innocence,
and thus conjoined with wisdom (n. 2305, 2306, 3494, 4563, 4797). Man is
so created that when he grows old and becomes like a little child, the
innocence of wisdom conjoins itself with the innocence of ignorance
which he had in infancy, and so he passes into the other life as a true
infant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5609.">5609.</span></span>

And I wilt be surety for him. That this signifies that in the meantime
it will be adjoined to itself, is evident from the signification of
"being surety for" anyone, as being to be instead of him, as is plain
from what now follows, especially from what Judah said to Joseph about
his being surety (Gen. 44:32-33); and as to be surety for anyone denotes
to be instead of him, it also denotes that while in the way it is
adjoined to itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5610.">5610.</span></span>

Of my hand shalt thou require him. That this signifies that it shall not
be torn away insofar as lies in its power, is evident from the
signification of the "hand," as being power (see n. 878, 3387,
4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 5544), and that it denotes insofar as lies in its
power, is because surety or guarantee goes no further (the internal
sense here sets forth the truth and the nature of it); and from the
signification of "requiring him from him," as being not to be torn away;
for one who is required of another must be adjoined to him and not be
torn from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5611.">5611.</span></span>

If I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee. That this
signifies unless he is quite restored to the church, is evident from the
signification of "bringing to him and setting before him," as being to
completely restore; and from the representation of Israel, to whom he
was to be restored, as being the church (see n. 3305, 4286, 5595).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5612.">5612.</span></span>

And I shall sin to thee all the days. That this signifies that the good
of the church will no longer be, is evident from the representation of
Judah, who says this of himself, as being the good of the church (see n.
5583, 5603); and from the signification of "sinning," as being
disjunction (see n. 5229, 5474), thus that it will not be, for anything
that is disjoined from another is not with it any longer; and from the
signification of "all the days," as being forever, thus no longer. These
things are said because the good of the church is impossible without the
intermediate between the internal and the external which is represented
by Benjamin; for both the good and the truth of the church flow from the
internal through the intermediate into the external, and consequently in
the degree that it is important to have the good of the church, in the
same degree it is important to have the intermediate. It is for this
reason that Judah makes himself surety for Benjamin. That the good of
the church is not possible without the intermediate, is signified by
these words of Judah, and that the truth of the church is not possible,
by Reuben's words (n. 5542).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5613.">5613.</span></span>

For except we had lingered. That this signifies tarrying in a state of
doubt, is evident from the signification of "lingering," as being a
state of doubt; for as "going," "advancing," "journeying," and
"sojourning" signify states of life (see n. 5605), so "lingering"
signifies a state of doubt, because when the state of life is in a state
of doubt, then the external is in a state of lingering. Moreover, this
is to be seen in man himself; for when his mind hangs in any doubt, he
halts and deliberates. The reason is that doubt makes the state of life
hesitating and wavering, and consequently the outward progression, which
is the effect. Hence it is plain that tarrying in a state of doubt is
signified by "except we had lingered."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5614.">5614.</span></span>

Surely we had now returned these two times. That this signifies that
there would have been spiritual life both exterior and interior, is
evident from the signification of "going," as being to live (of which
above, n. 5605); and therefore "returning" is living therefrom, for they
went thither to procure corn, and by "corn" is signified the good of
truth from which is spiritual life; and from the signification of "these
two times," which, as it relates to life, denotes life exterior and
interior, for by the "produce" they got the first time was signified
life that is exterior or in the natural, for the reason that they were
without an intermediate (as explained in the preceding chapter); while
by the "corn" they get this time is signified interior life, because
they were now with Benjamin, who is the intermediate, as explained in
this and in the following chapter. Hence it is that by "surely we had
now returned these two times," is signified spiritual life both exterior
and interior. \[2\] That this is the signification cannot but seem
strange, especially to one who knows nothing about what is spiritual;
for it seems as if "returning these two times" has nothing in common
with the spiritual life that is signified; but still this is the
internal sense of the words. If you will believe it, the interior
thought itself of the man who is in good apprehends this, because this
thought is in the internal sense, although while in the body the man is
deeply ignorant of it; for unknown to him the internal sense, that is,
the spiritual sense, which is of the interior thought, falls into
material and sensuous ideas that partake of time and space and of such
things as are in the world, and therefore it does not appear that his
interior thought is of such a nature; for his interior thought is like
that of the angels, his spirit being in company with them. \[3\] That
the thought of the man who is in good is according to the internal
sense, may be seen from the fact that when after death he comes into
heaven, he at once without any information is in the internal sense, and
this could not be unless as to his interior thought he had been in this
sense while in the world. The reason of his being in this internal sense
is that there is a correspondence between spiritual and natural things
so complete that there is not the smallest thing that has not its
correspondence; and therefore because the interior or rational mind of
the man who is in good is in the spiritual world, and his exterior or
natural mind in the natural world, it must needs be that both minds
think (the interior mind spiritually, and the exterior naturally), and
that the spiritual falls into the natural, and they act as a one by
correspondence. \[4\] That man's interior mind, the ideas of thought of
which are called intellectual and are said to be immaterial, does not
think from the words of any language, nor consequently from natural
forms, can be seen by him who is able to reflect on these things, for he
can think in a moment what he can scarcely utter in an hour, and he does
so by universals which comprise in them very many particulars. These
ideas of thought are spiritual, and when the Word is being read are no
other than as the internal sense is; although the man does not know
this, because as before said these spiritual ideas, by influx into what
is natural, present natural ideas, so that the spiritual ideas do not
appear; insomuch that unless he has been instructed the man believes
that there is no spiritual unless it is like the natural, and even that
he does not think otherwise in spirit than as he speaks in the body. In
such a manner does the natural cast a shade over the spiritual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5615.">5615.</span></span>

Verses 11-14. And their father Israel said unto them, If therefore this
be so, do this; take of the song of the land in your vessels, and carry
down the man a present, a little resin and a little honey, wax and
stacte, terebinth <span id="fr_136"></span>[5615-1](#fn_136.md) nuts and
almonds; and take double silver in your hand; and the silver that was
returned in the mouth of your bags carry back in your hand; peradventure
it was an error; and take your brother, and arise, and return unto the
man; and God Shaddai give you mercies before the man, and send you your
other brother and Benjamin. And I, as I have been bereaved I shall be
bereaved. "And their father Israel said unto them," signifies perception
from spiritual good; "If therefore this be so, do this," signifies if it
cannot be done otherwise, so let it be done; "take of the song of the
land in your vessels," signifies the choice things of the church in the
truths of faith; "and carry down the man a present," signifies to obtain
favor; "a little resin and a little honey," signifies the truths of good
of the exterior natural, and its delight; "wax and stacte," signifies
the truths of good of the interior natural; "terebinth nuts and
almonds," signifies goods of life corresponding to these truths; "and
take double silver in your hands," signifies truth received in the
abilities; "and the silver that was returned in the mouth of your bags
carry back in your hand," signifies that by truth gratuitously given in
the exterior natural they were to submit themselves as far as possible;
"peradventure it was an error," signifies lest he be adverse; "and take
your brother," signifies that thus they would have the good of faith;
"and arise, and return unto the man," signifies life from spiritual
truth; "and God Shaddai," signifies consolation after hardships; "give
you mercies before the man," signifies may spiritual truth receive you
graciously; "and send you your other brother," signifies may it give the
good of faith; "and Benjamin," signifies and also interior truth; "and
I, as I have been bereaved I shall be bereaved," signifies that the
church, before these things are done, will be as if deprived of its
truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5616.">5616.</span></span>

And their father Israel said unto them. That this signifies perception
from spiritual good, is evident from the signification of "saying" in
the historicals of the Word, as being perception; and from the
representation of Israel, as being spiritual good (of which above, n.
5595). He is called "father" because the truths that his sons represent
are from this good as from a father.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5617.">5617.</span></span>

If therefore this be so, do this. That this signifies that if it cannot
be done otherwise so let it be done, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5618.">5618.</span></span>

Take of the song of the land in your vessels. That this signifies the
choice things of the church in the truths of faith, is evident from the
signification of the "song," as being the choice things (of which in
what follows); and from the signification of the "land," as being the
church (of which above, n. 5577); and from the signification of
"vessels," as being the truths of faith (n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318). The
word "song" is used because this word in the original tongue is derived
from singing; hence the "song of the land" signifies productions hailed
with songs and praises, consequently in the internal sense choice
things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5619.">5619.</span></span>

And carry down the man a present. That this signifies obtaining favor,
is evident from the signification of "offering a present to the man,"
here to Joseph, who is called the "lord of the land," as being to obtain
favor. It was customary in the Ancient representative Church, and thence
in the Jewish, to give some present to judges, and at a later period to
kings and priests, when they were approached; moreover, this was
commanded. The reason was that the presents they gave them represented
such things in man as ought to be offered to the Lord when He is
approached, which are things that are from freedom, consequently from
the man himself; for his freedom is what is from the heart, and what is
from the heart is from the will, and what is from the will is from the
affection which is of the love, and what is from the affection which is
of the love is free, thus of the man himself (see n. 1947, 2870-2893,
3158). From this it is that a present should be given by man to the Lord
on approaching Him. It was this present that was represented; for kings
represented the Lord as to Divine truth (n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009,
3670, 4581, 4966, 5044), and priests as to Divine good (n. 1728, 2015,
3670). That these presents were initiations, see n. 4262; and
initiations are for obtaining favor.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5620.">5620.</span></span>

A little resin and a little honey. That this signifies the truths of
good of the exterior natural and its delight, is evident from the
signification of "resin," as being the truth of good or truth from good
(see n. 4748). The reason why "resin" has this signification is that it
ranks among unguents, and also among aromatics. "Aromatics" signify such
things as are of truth from good, especially if they are of an unctuous
nature, and so partake of oil; for "oil" signifies good (n. 886, 3728,
4582). That this resin was aromatic, may be seen in Gen. 37:25; and for
this reason also the same word in the original means balsam. That it was
like an ointment or thick oil, is evident. This then is the reason why
by "resin" is signified the truth of good which is in the natural, here
in the exterior, because "resin" is put first and joined with "honey,"
which is the delight therein. That "honey" denotes delight is because it
is sweet, and everything sweet in the natural world corresponds to what
is delightful and pleasant in the spiritual world. The reason why it is
called its delight, that is, the delight of truth from good in the
exterior natural, is that every truth and especially every truth of good
has its own delight; but a delight from the affection of these, and from
the derivative use. \[2\] That "honey" is delight is evident also from
other passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: A virgin shall conceive and
bear a son, and shall call His name Immanuel \[God with us\]. Butter and
honey shall He eat, that He may know to refuse the evil and choose the
good (Isa. 7:14-15); speaking of the Lord; "butter" denotes the
celestial; "honey," that which is from the celestial. \[3\] In the same:
It shall come to pass for the multitude of milk that they shall yield,
he shall eat butter; and butter and honey shall everyone eat that is
left in the midst of the land (Isa. 7:22); speaking of the Lord's
kingdom; "milk" denotes spiritual good; "butter," celestial good; and
"honey," that which is from them, thus what is happy, pleasant, and
delightful. \[4\] In Ezekiel: Thus wast thou adorned with gold and
silver; and thy garments were of fine linen and silk and broidered work.
Thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil; so thou becamest beautiful
very exceedingly, and thou didst prosper even unto a kingdom. With fine
flour and oil and honey I fed thee; but thou didst set it before them
for an odor of rest (Ezek. 16:13, 19); speaking of Jerusalem, by which
is meant the spiritual church, the quality of which is described as it
was with the ancients, and as it afterward became. Her being "adorned
with gold and silver" denotes with celestial and spiritual good and
truth; her "garments of fine linen, silk, and broidered work" denotes
truths in the rational and in each natural; "fine flour" denotes the
spiritual; "honey," its pleasantness; and "oil," its good. That such
things as belong to heaven are signified by these particulars can be
seen by anyone. \[5\] In the same: Judah and the land of Israel were thy
traders, in wheat of Minnith, and pannag, and honey, and oil, and balm
(Ezek. 27:17); speaking of Tyre, by which is signified the spiritual
church such as it was in the beginning and such as it afterward became,
but in respect to the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1201). "Honey"
here also denotes the pleasantness and delight from the affections of
knowing and learning celestial and spiritual goods and truths. \[6\] In
Moses: Thou makest him ride on the high places of the earth, and he eats
the produce of the fields. He maketh him suck honey out of the rock, and
oil out of the flint of the rock (Deut. 32:13); here also treating of
the Ancient spiritual Church; "to suck honey out of the rock" denotes
delight from truths of memory-knowledge. \[7\] In David: I feed them
with the fat of wheat, and with honey out of the rock I sate them (Ps.
81:16); "to sate with honey out of the rock" denotes to fill with
delight from the truths of faith. \[8\] In Deuteronomy: Jehovah bringeth
me unto a good land, a land of rivers of water, of fountains and of
deeps that go out from the valley, and from the mountain; a land of
wheat and barley, and of vine and of fig and of pomegranate; a land of
oil olive and of honey (Deut. 8:7-8); speaking of the land of Canaan; in
the internal sense, of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens. A "land of oil
olive and of honey" denotes spiritual good and its pleasantness. \[9\]
Hence also the land of Canaan was called: A land flowing with milk and
honey (Num. 13:27; 14:8; Deut. 26:9, 15; 27:3; Jer. 11:5; 32:22; Ezek.
20:6). In the internal sense of these passages by the "land of Canaan"
is meant, as before said, the Lord's kingdom; "flowing with milk"
denotes an abundance of celestial spiritual things; and "with honey," an
abundance of derivative happiness and delights. \[10\] In David: The
judgments of Jehovah are truth, righteous are they together; more to be
desired are they than gold and much fine gold, sweeter also than honey
and the dropping of the honeycombs (Ps. 19:9-10); the "judgments of
Jehovah" denote truth Divine; "sweeter than honey and the dropping of
the honeycombs" denotes delights from good and pleasantnesses from
truth. Again: Sweet are Thy words to my palate, sweeter than honey to my
mouth (Ps. 119:103); where the meaning is similar. \[11\] The manna that
Jacob's posterity had for bread in the wilderness is thus described in
Moses: The manna was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was
like a cake kneaded with honey (Exod. 16:31); as the manna signified the
truth Divine that descends through heaven from the Lord, it consequently
signified the Lord Himself as to the Divine Human, as He Himself teaches
in John 6:51, 58; for it is the Lord's Divine Human from which all truth
Divine comes, yea, of which all truth Divine treats; and this being so,
the manna is described in respect to delight and pleasantness by the
taste, that it was "like a cake kneaded with honey." (That the taste
denotes the delight of good and the pleasantness of truth may be seen
above, n. 3502.) \[12\] As John the Baptist represented the Lord as to
the Word, which is the Divine truth on earth, in like manner as Elijah
(n. 2762, 5247), he was therefore the "Elijah who was to come" before
the Lord (Mal. 4:5; Matt. 17:10-12; Mark 9:11-13; Luke 1:17); wherefore
his clothing and food were significative, of which we read in Matthew:
John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his
loin; and his meat was locusts and wild honey (Matt. 3:4; Mark 1:6). The
"clothing of camel's hair" signified that the Word, such as is its
literal sense as to truth (which sense is a clothing for the internal
sense), is natural; for what is natural is signified by "hair," and also
by "camels;" and the "meat being of locusts and wild honey" signified
the Word such as is its literal sense as to good; the delight of this is
signified by "wild honey." \[13\] The delight of truth Divine in respect
to the external sense is also described by "honey" in Ezekiel: He said
unto me, Son of man, feed thy belly and fill thy bowels with this roll
that I give thee. And when I ate it, it was in my mouth as honey for
sweetness (Ezek. 3:3). And in John: The angel said unto me, Take the
little book and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it
shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. So I took the little book out of
the angel's hand and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey;
but when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter. Then he said unto me,
Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations and tongues and
kings (Rev. 10:9-11). The "roll" in Ezekiel, and the "little book" in
John, denote truth Divine. That in the external form this appears
delightful, is signified by the flavor being "sweet as honey;" for truth
Divine, like the Word, is delightful in the external form or in the
literal sense because this admits of being unfolded by interpretations
in everyone's favor. But not so the internal sense, which is therefore
signified by the "bitter" taste; for this sense discloses man's
interiors. The reason why the external sense is delightful, is as before
said that the things in it can be unfolded favorably; for they are only
general truths, and general truths are susceptible of this before they
are qualified by particulars, and these by singulars. It is delightful
also because it is natural, and what is spiritual conceals itself
within. Moreover, it must be delightful in order that man may receive
it, that is, be introduced into it, and not be deterred at the very
threshold. \[14\] The "honeycomb and broiled fish" that the Lord ate
with the disciples after His resurrection, also signified the external
sense of the Word (the "fish" as to its truth and the "honeycomb" as to
its pleasantness), in regard to which we read in Luke: Jesus said, Have
ye here anything to eat? They gave Him a piece of a broiled fish, and of
a honeycomb, and He took them and did eat before them (Luke 24:41-43).
And because these things are signified, the Lord therefore said to them:
These are the words which I spoke unto you while I was yet with you,
that all things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses,
and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me (Luke 24:44). It
appears as if such things were not signified, because their having a
piece of broiled fish and a honeycomb seems as if fortuitous;
nevertheless it was of providence, and not only this, but also all
other, even the least, of the things that occur in the Word. As such
things were signified, therefore the Lord said of the Word that in it
were written the things concerning Himself. Yet the things written of
the Lord in the literal sense of the Old Testament are few; but those in
its internal sense are all so written, for from this is the holiness of
the Word. This is what is meant by His saying that "all things must be
fulfilled which are written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets,
and in the Psalms, concerning Him." \[15\] From all this it may now be
seen that by "honey" is signified the delight that is from good and
truth, or from the affection of them, and that there is specifically
signified external delight, thus the delight of the exterior natural. As
this delight is of such a nature as to be from the world through the
things of the senses, and thereby contains within it many things from
the love of the world, the use of honey in the meat-offerings was
therefore forbidden, as in Leviticus: No meat-offering which ye shall
bring unto Jehovah shall be made with leaven; for there shall be no
leaven, nor any honey, from what ye burn with fire to Jehovah (Lev.
2:11); where "honey" denotes such external delight, which, because it
contains in it what partakes of the love of the world, was also like
leaven, and was on this account forbidden. (What "leaven" or "leavened"
means may be seen above, n. 2342.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5621.">5621.</span></span>

Wax and stacte. That this signifies the truths of good of the interior
natural, is evident from the signification of "wax," here aromatic wax,
as being the truth of good (of which in what follows); and from the
signification of "stacte," as also being truth from good (see n. 4748).
Their being of the interior natural is because these spices are purer
than resin and honey, and are therefore mentioned in the second place;
for such particulars are enumerated in the Word in accordance with the
order. By "wax" here is not meant common, but aromatic wax, such as
storax. This wax is signified by the term used in the original language,
and spice also by the same. Hence it is plain why this aromatic wax
signifies the truth of good; for all spices, being sweet-scented, in the
internal sense signify the truths which are from good. This may be seen
from the fact that truths from good are perceived in heaven pleasantly,
like sweet-scented things in the world; and therefore when the
perceptions of the angels are turned into odors, as of the Lord's good
pleasure often happens, they are then smelt as fragrances from spices
and from flowers. This is the reason why frankincense and incense were
compounded of materials of grateful odor, and were employed for a holy
use; and also why aromatics were mixed with the anointing oil. One who
does not know that such things derive their cause from things perceived
in heaven, may be of the opinion that they were commanded merely to
render outward worship grateful; but in that case there would be in them
nothing of heaven, or nothing holy, and consequently such matters of
worship would not have anything Divine in them. (See what has already
been shown on this subject; that frankincense and incense, and also the
fragrant substances used in the anointing oil, were representative of
spiritual and celestial things, n. 4748; and that the spheres of faith
and love are turned into grateful odors, and therefore grateful and
sweet-scented and also spicy odors signify truths of faith which are
from the good of love, n. 1514, 1517-1519, 4628.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5622.">5622.</span></span>

Terebinth <span id="fr_137"></span>[5622-1](#fn_137.md) nuts and almonds.
That this signifies goods of life corresponding to these truths, is
evident from the signification of "terebinth nuts," as being goods of
life corresponding to the truths of good of the exterior natural which
are signified by "resin" (of which in what follows); and from the
signification of "almonds," as being goods of life corresponding to the
truths of good of the interior natural which are signified by "aromatic
wax and stacte." That these "nuts" have this signification is because
they are fruits, and "fruits" in the Word signify works; the fruits of
useful trees good works, or what is the same, goods of the life, for in
respect to use the goods of life are good works. That "terebinth nuts"
signify goods of life corresponding to truths of good of the exterior
natural, is because they are of a less noble tree; and things that are
exterior are signified by such objects as are less noble. The reason is,
that in themselves exterior things are grosser than interior; for they
are generals composed of very many interior things. \[2\] That "almonds"
signify goods of life corresponding to the truths of good of the
interior natural, is because the almond is a nobler tree. This tree
itself signifies in the spiritual sense a perception of interior truth
which is from good, its "blossom" interior truth which is from good, and
its "fruit" good of life thence derived. In this sense the "almond tree"
is spoken of in Jeremiah: The word of Jehovah came to pass, saying,
Jeremiah what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.
Then said Jehovah unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I wake over My word
to do it (Jer. 1:11-12); a "rod" denotes power; "almond tree," the
perception of interior truth; here, being predicated of Jehovah, it
denotes waking over it; "word" denotes truth. \[3\] By the "almonds
which budded from the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi," are also
signified goods of charity or goods of life, of which we read in Moses:
It came to pass on the morrow, when Moses entered into the tent of
meeting, behold the rod of Aaron for the tribe of Levi had blossomed and
brought forth blossom, so that the flower flowered, and bare almonds
(Num. 17:8). This was a sign that this tribe was chosen for the
priesthood; for by the "the tribe of Levi" was signified charity (see n.
3875, 3877, 4497, 4502, 4503), which is the essential of the spiritual
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5623.">5623.</span></span>

And take double silver in your hands. That this signifies truth received
in the abilities, is evident from the signification of "silver," as
being truth (see n. 1551, 2954); and from the signification of "double,"
as being again in succession (see n. 1335), namely truth which was
gratuitously bestowed on them, and which was to be bestowed on them
again; and from the signification of "hands," as being abilities (n.
878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328). Truth in the abilities means in the
capacities for receiving it, thus according to the capacities. But the
capacities or abilities for receiving truth are wholly according to
good, because the Lord adjoins them to good; for when the Lord flows in
with good He also flows in with capacity. Hence truth received in the
abilities means according to goods. That the capacities for receiving
truth are according to good is evident from much experience in the other
life. They who are in good there have the capacity not only for
perceiving truth, but also for receiving it, yet according to the amount
and quality of the good in which they are. But they who are in evil have
on the other hand no capacity for receiving truth. This comes from
pleasure and consequent desire. They who are in good have pleasure in
perfecting good by means of truth, because good takes its quality from
truths; and therefore they desire truths. But they who are in evil have
pleasure in evil, and in confirming it by falsities, and therefore they
desire falsities; and because they desire falsities they are averse to
truths. For this reason they have no capacity for receiving truths, for
they reject or stifle or pervert them as soon as they reach the ear or
occur to the thought. Besides, every man who is of sound mind has a
capacity for receiving truths; but they extinguish this capacity who
turn to evil, and they exalt it who turn to good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5624.">5624.</span></span>

And the silver that was returned in the mouth of your bags carry back in
your hand. That this signifies that by means of the truth given
gratuitously in the exterior natural they were to submit themselves as
far as possible, is evident from the signification of the "silver
returned," as being truth given gratuitously (see n. 5530); from the
signification of "in the mouth of their bags," as being in the threshold
of the exterior natural (see n. 5497); and from the signification of "in
the hand," as being in the ability (of which just above, see n. 5623),
thus as far as possible. Their submitting themselves by means of this
truth is signified by their "carrying it back;" for in the spiritual
world to carry back truth to the Lord, from whom it has been received
gratuitously, is to submit one's self by means of it. But the manner in
which they submitted themselves by its means is plain from the
conversation with the man who was over Joseph's house (verses 18-24).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5625.">5625.</span></span>

Peradventure it was an error. That this signifies lest he be adverse, is
evident from the signification of an "error," as being what is adverse,
for the error here meant is as if they had forgotten to pay the silver
and so were taking it back, everyone in his own sack; for which reason
he might possibly be adverse to them, as they also believed; for they
were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and said, "Upon
the word of the silver that was returned in our bags in the beginning
are we brought, to roll down upon us, and to throw himself upon us, and
to take us for servants, and our asses" (verse 18). Moreover "sin"
signifies disjunction and aversion (n. 5229, 5474); and so does "error"
if there is sin in it, but in a less degree; wherefore it is said "lest
he be adverse."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5626.">5626.</span></span>

And take your brother. That this signifies that in this way they would
have the good of faith, is evident from the representation of Simeon,
who is here the "brother" whom they were to take, as being faith in the
will (n. 3869-3872, 4497, 4502, 4503, 5482), thus the good of faith,
because when the truth of faith passes into the will it becomes the good
of faith; for the truth then passes into the man's life, and when it is
there it is regarded not as something to be known, but as something to
be done; consequently it changes its essence and becomes actual. Hence
it is no longer called truth, but good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5627.">5627.</span></span>

And arise, return unto the man. That this signifies life from spiritual
truth, is evident from the signification of "arising," as being
elevation to things interior, consequently to spiritual things (see n.
2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103, 4881); from the signification of
"returning," as being the consequent life (of which above, n. 5614); and
from the representation of Joseph, when called "the man," as being
spiritual truth (n. 5584).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5628.">5628.</span></span>

And God Shaddai. That this signifies consolation after hardships, is
evident from the signification of "Shaddai," as being temptation and
consolation after it (n. 1992, 4572); here therefore consolation after
the hardships they had suffered in Egypt. That it is consolation after
hardships is plain also from the words that follow in continuance-"give
you mercies before the man." That "Shaddai" signifies temptation and
consolation after it, is because the ancients designated the One Only
God by various names, according to the various things that were from
Him; and as they believed that temptations were from Him, they then
called God "Shaddai," and by this name they did not mean another God,
but the Only One in respect to temptations. But when the Ancient Church
declined, they began to worship as many gods as there were names for the
One Only God, and also of themselves added to them many more. This
practice at last became so prevalent that every family had its own god,
and they wholly distinguished him from the rest who were worshiped by
other families. \[2\] Terah's family, of which was Abraham, worshiped
Shaddai for its god (see n. 1356, 1992, 2559, 3667); and hence not only
Abraham, but Jacob also, acknowledged Shaddai as his god, even in the
land of Canaan; and this was permitted them lest they should be forced
from their own religiosity; for no one is forced from what he regards as
holy. But as the ancients understood by "Shaddai" Jehovah Himself, or
the Lord, who was so styled when they underwent temptations, therefore
Jehovah or the Lord regained this name with Abraham, as is plain from
Gen. 17:1, and also with Jacob, Gen. 35:11. The reason why not merely
temptation, but consolation also, is signified by "Shaddai," is that
consolation follows all spiritual temptations. This has been given me to
know by experience in the other life; for when anyone there suffers hard
things from evil spirits, through infestations, incitements to evils,
and persuasions to falsities, after the evil spirits have been removed,
he is received by angels, and is brought into a state of comfort by
means of a delight conformable to his genius.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5629.">5629.</span></span>

Give you mercies before the man. That this signifies, may spiritual
truth receive you graciously, is evident from the signification of
"giving mercies," as being to receive graciously; and from the
representation of Joseph, as being when called "the man," spiritual
truth (as above, n. 5627).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5630.">5630.</span></span>

And send you your other brother. That this signifies, may it give the
good of faith, is evident from the representation of Simeon, who is here
the "other brother," as being the good of faith (as above, n. 5626).
That "sending" denotes to give is because "sending" is used in reference
to the person, and "giving" in reference to the thing signified by the
person.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5631.">5631.</span></span>

And Benjamin. That this signifies, and also interior truth, is evident
from the representation of Benjamin, as being interior truth (of which
above, n. 5600).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5632.">5632.</span></span>

And I, as I had been bereaved, I shall be bereaved. That this signifies
that before these things are done the church will be deprived of its
truths, is evident from the representation of Israel, who says this of
himself, as being the church (see n. 3305, 4286); and from the
signification of "being bereaved" as being to be deprived of the truths
of the church (see n. 5536). That this is so before these things are
done is plain, for if there is no good of faith which is represented by
Simeon (n. 5630), and no interior truth, which is the intermediate
represented by Benjamin, the church has not any truth, except such as is
on the lips merely, and not in the heart.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5633.">5633.</span></span>

Verses 15-17. And the men took this present, and they took double silver
in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and
stood before Joseph. And Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and he said to
him that was over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaying
slay, and make ready; for the men shall eat with me at noon. And the man
did as Joseph said; and the man brought the men to Joseph's house. "And
the men took this present," signifies that truths had with them the
means for obtaining favor; "and they took double silver in their hand,"
signifies also truth received in the ability; "and Benjamin," signifies
and the intermediate also; "and rose up and went down to Egypt,"
signifies elevation to life to be gained by them from the interior
things of memory-knowledges; "and stood before Joseph," signifies the
presence of the celestial of the spiritual there; "and Joseph saw
Benjamin with them," signifies the perception by the celestial of the
spiritual of a spiritual intermediate with truths; "and he said to him
that was over his house," signifies to that which is of the external
church; "Bring the men to the house," signifies that the truths in the
natural were to be introduced thither; "and slaying slay and make
ready," signifies through the goods of the exterior natural; "for the
men shall eat with me at noon," signifies that they will be conjoined
when with the intermediate; "and the man did as Joseph said," signifies
bringing it about; "and the man brought the men to Joseph's house,"
signifies first introduction into the good which is from the celestial
of the spiritual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5634.">5634.</span></span>

And the men took this present. That this signifies that truths had with
them the means for obtaining favor, is evident from the signification of
"men," as being truths (n. 3134); and from the signification of a
"present," which was given on approaching kings and priests, as being
something to obtain favor (n. 5619).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5635.">5635.</span></span>

And they took double silver in their hand. That this signifies also
truth received in the ability, is evident from what was said above (n.
5623), where the same words occur. It may also be seen there what is
meant by truth received in the ability.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5636.">5636.</span></span>

And Benjamin. That this signifies and the intermediate also, is evident
from the representation of Benjamin, as being the intermediate (see n.
5411, 5413, 5443).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5637.">5637.</span></span>

And rose up, and went down to Egypt. That this signifies elevation to
life to be gained by them from the interior things of memory-knowledges
is evident from the signification of "rising up," as being elevation to
the things of spiritual life (see n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103,
4881); and from the signification of "going down," as being to life to
be gained by them, for "going down" here involves the same as was meant
before by the words, "Send the boy with me, and we will arise and go,
and we will live, and not die" (verse 8), by which is signified
spiritual life according to degrees (n. 5605); and from the
signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (n. 1164-1165,
1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966), here the interior things of
memory-knowledges, because the celestial of the spiritual which is
represented by Joseph was there; wherefore it is presently said that
they "stood before Joseph." The interior things of memory-knowledges are
spiritual things in the natural mind, and spiritual things are there
when the memory-knowledges there are enlightened by the light of heaven,
and they are so enlightened when the man has faith in the doctrinal
things that are from the Word, and he has this faith when he is in the
good of charity; for then truths and thereby memory-knowledges are
enlightened by the good of charity as by a flame. From this they have
their spiritual light. Hence it may be seen what is meant by the
interior things of memory-knowledges.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5638.">5638.</span></span>

And stood before Joseph. That this signifies the presence of the
celestial of the spiritual there, is evident from the signification of
"standing before" anyone, as being presence; and from the representation
of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual (of which often
before). That the celestial of the spiritual was present in both
naturals was represented by Joseph's being made lord over all Egypt.
This is what is meant by the presence of the celestial of the spiritual
in the interior things of memory-knowledges; for these knowledges are in
the natural (see n. 5316, 5324, 5326-5328, 5333, 5337, 5373). The truths
represented by Jacob's ten sons are truths in the natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5639.">5639.</span></span>

And Joseph saw Benjamin with them. That this signifies the perception by
the celestial of the spiritual of a spiritual intermediate with truths,
is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to understand
and perceive (see n. 2150, 2807, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400); and from the
representation of Jacob's ten sons (who are meant by "with them," that
is, with whom Joseph saw Benjamin), as being truths in the natural (n.
5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512); and from the representation of Benjamin,
as being the intermediate (see n. 5411, 5413, 5443). That this is here
called a spiritual intermediate is because the truths represented by
Jacob's ten sons were now to be conjoined with the truth from the Divine
which is "Joseph," and this conjunction is not effected without an
intermediate which is spiritual; and therefore when this intermediate
was perceived, it immediately follows that "Joseph said to him that was
over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaying slay, and make
ready; for the men shall eat with me at noon," by which is signified
that they would be introduced and conjoined because with the
intermediate. \[2\] What the spiritual is relatively to the natural must
be further told in a few words, because most of those who are in the
Christian world are so ignorant of what the spiritual is that when they
hear the term they hesitate, and say to themselves that no one knows
what it is. In its essence with man the spiritual is the very affection
of good and truth for the sake of good and truth, and not for the sake
of self, and also the affection of what is just and fair for the sake of
what is just and fair, and not for the sake of self. When a man feels in
himself delight and pleasantness, and still more if he feels happiness
and blessedness, from these affections, this is the spiritual in him,
which comes not from the natural, but from the spiritual world or from
heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord. This then is the
spiritual, which when it reigns in a man, affects and as it were tinges
all that he thinks, wills, and does, and causes the thoughts and the
acts of his will to partake of the spiritual, until at last these also
become spiritual in him, as when he passes out of the natural into the
spiritual world. In a word, the affection of charity and faith, that is,
of good and truth, and the delight and pleasantness, and still more the
happiness and blessedness thence derived, which are felt inwardly in man
and make him a man truly Christian, are the spiritual. \[3\] That most
men in the Christian world are ignorant of what the spiritual is, is
because they make faith and not charity the essential of the church.
Consequently as those few who are concerned about faith think little if
at all about charity or know what it is, therefore as there is no
knowledge, there is no perception of the affection which is of charity;
and he who is not in the affection of charity cannot possibly know what
the spiritual is. Especially is this true at the present day, when
scarcely anyone has any charity, because it is the last time of the
church. But be it known that in a general sense the "spiritual" means
the affection both of good and of truth, and therefore heaven is called
the spiritual world, and the internal sense of the Word the spiritual
sense; but specifically that which is of the affection of good is called
the celestial, and that which is of the affection of truth is called the
spiritual.

And he said to him that was over his house. That this signifies to that
which is of the external church, is evident from the representation of
him that was over the house, as being the external church, when he who
is in the house is the internal church (see n. 1795). And as in the
internal sense the thing, and not the person, is regarded (see n. 5225,
5287, 5434), therefore by "him that was over the house" is signified
that which is of the external church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5641.">5641.</span></span>

Bring the men to the house. That this signifies that the truths in the
natural mind were to be introduced thither, is evident from the
signification of "Jacob's sons," as being the truths of the church in
the natural (see n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512). Their being
introduced there is signified by "bringing the men to the house."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5642.">5642.</span></span>

And slaying slay and make ready. That this signifies through the goods
of the exterior natural, is evident from the signification of "slaying,"
as involving that which is slain-an ox, a bullock, a he-goat, or other
cattle-as being the goods of the natural (that an "ox" and a "bullock"
are the goods of the natural may be seen above, n. 2180, 2566, 2781,
2830); here the goods of the exterior natural, because through these
they were now first introduced to conjunction; for his "bringing the men
to Joseph's house" signifies the first introduction into the good which
is from the celestial of the spiritual (see below n. 5645). As the
"bullock" and "ox" signified the goods of the natural, everything done
in regard to them also signified this good, for the one involved the
other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5643.">5643.</span></span>

For the men shall eat with me at noon. That this signifies that they
will be conjoined when with the intermediate, is evident from the
signification of "eating with," as being to be communicated, conjoined
and appropriated (n. 2187, 2343, 3168, 3513, 3596, 3832). And because
they were with the spiritual intermediate, which is "Benjamin" (n.
5639), it is said "at noon;" for "noon" signifies a state of light, thus
the spiritual state which comes through the intermediate (n. 1458,
3708).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5644.">5644.</span></span>

And the man did as Joseph said. That this signifies bringing it about,
is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5645.">5645.</span></span>

And the man brought the men to Joseph's house. That this signifies the
first introduction into the good which is from the celestial of the
spiritual, is evident from the signification of "bringing," as being
introduction (as above, n. 5641); from the signification of "Jacob's
sons," as being the truths of the church in the natural (see n. 5403,
5419, 5427, 5428, 5512); from the signification of a "house," as being
good (n. 3652, 3720, 4982), and hence also the church (n. 3720), for the
church is the church from good; and from the representation of Joseph,
as being the celestial of the spiritual (of which often above). From
this it is plain that by "the man's bringing the men to Joseph's house"
is signified that the truths in the natural were to be introduced into
the good which is from the celestial of the spiritual. That the first
introduction is what is signified, is because they now only ate with
Joseph, and did not know him. By this is signified a general
conjunction, which is the first introduction; for truth from the Divine
then flows in generally, and is not discerned. But when the truth which
flows in is observed, there is then a second conjunction, which is
signified by Joseph's manifesting himself to his brethren, as related in
a subsequent chapter (Gen. 45).

Verses 18-23. And the men were afraid because they were brought to
Joseph's house; and they said, Over the word of the silver that was
returned in our bags in the beginning are we brought; to roll down upon
us, and to cast himself upon us, and to take us for servants, and our
asses. And they came near to the man that was over Joseph's house, and
they spoke unto him at the door of the house, and said, In me, my lord,
in coming down we came down in the beginning to buy food; and it came to
pass when we came to the inn and we opened our bags, and behold
everyone's silver in the mouth of his bag, our silver in its weight; and
we have brought it back in our hand. And other silver have we brought
down in our hand to buy food; we know not who put our silver in our
bags. And he said, Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of
your father, gave you a hidden gift in your bags; your silver came to
me. And he brought Simeon out unto them. "And the men were afraid,"
signifies a drawing back; "because they were brought to Joseph's house,"
signifies because the truths that belonged to the natural were to be
adjoined and subjected to the internal; "and they said, Over the word of
the silver that was returned in our bags in the beginning are we
brought," signifies because truth in the exterior natural appears to be
given gratuitously, they were therefore to be in subjection; "to roll
down upon us and to cast himself upon us," signifies that on this
account they were to be reduced under absolute power; "and to take us
for servants and our asses," signifies until whatever is in either
natural be as nothing; "and they came near to the man that was over
Joseph's house," signifies the doctrinals of the church; "and they spoke
unto him at the door of the house," signifies taking counsel of them
about introduction; "and said, In me, my lord," signifies a testifying;
"in coming down we came down in the beginning to buy food," signifies a
disposition to procure good for truths; "and it came to pass when we
came to the inn and we opened our bags," signifies introspection into
the exterior natural; "and behold everyone's silver in the mouth of his
bag," signifies that it was clearly seen that truths had been given as
it were gratuitously; "our silver in its weight," signifies truths
according to each one's state; "and we have brought it back in our
hand," signifies that what had been given gratuitously would be in
submission as far as possible; "and other silver have we brought down in
our hand to buy food," signifies that there is a disposition to procure
good by means of truth from another source; "we know not who put our
silver in our bags," signifies non-belief, from ignorance of the source
of truth in the exterior natural; "and he said, Peace be to you, fear
not," signifies that it is well, let them not despair; "your God, and
the God of your father," signifies the Lord's Divine Human; "gave you a
hidden gift in your bags," signifies that it was from Him without any
prudence of theirs; "your silver came to me," signifies that it will
seem as truth procured by them; "and he brought Simeon out unto them,"
signifies that he adjoined will to truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5647.">5647.</span></span>

And the men were afraid. That this signifies a drawing back, is evident
from the signification of "being afraid," as here being a drawing back,
namely, from conjunction with the internal. Fear arises from various
causes, as from danger of loss of life, of gain, honor, and reputation,
also of being brought into some servitude and thus losing freedom and
with it the life's delight. This is the subject treated of in what now
follows; for they were afraid lest they should be adjoined to the
internal, and thereby lose their own, and with it their freedom, and
with freedom the life's delight, because this depends on freedom. This
is the reason why by "the men were afraid" is signified a drawing back
lest they should be adjoined. Here in few words it must be told in
advance how the case is with this conjunction, that is, the conjunction
of the external or natural man with the internal or spiritual. The
external or natural man reigns from life's earliest age, and knows not
that there is an internal or spiritual man. When therefore the man is
being reformed and from being natural or external is beginning to become
spiritual or internal, the natural at first rebels, for it is taught
that the natural man is to be subjugated, that is, that all its
concupiscences together with the things that confirm them are to be
rooted out. Hence when the natural man is left to itself, it thinks that
in this way it would utterly perish; for it knows no otherwise than that
the natural is everything, and it is wholly ignorant that in the
spiritual there are things immeasurable and unutterable; and when the
natural man so thinks, it draws back and is not willing to be subjected
to the spiritual. This is what is here meant by their "fear."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5648.">5648.</span></span>

Because they were brought to Joseph's house. That this signifies because
the truths that belong to the natural were to be adjoined and subjected
to the internal, is evident from the signification of "being brought to
Joseph's house," as being to be conjoined and subjected to the internal;
for by Joseph is represented the internal, because he represents truth
from the Divine, or the celestial of the spiritual (see n. 5307, 5331,
5332, 5417, 5469); and by a "house" is signified man's internal as well
as his external (n. 3128, 3538, 4973, 5023), here the internal, as it is
called "Joseph's house;" and by "being brought" (namely, to the
internal) is signified to be adjoined, and therefore to be subjected.
The reason is that when the natural is adjoined to the internal, it is
then subjected to it; for the command which had before belonged to the
natural man, then becomes the spiritual man's; of which command, of the
Lord's Divine mercy more will be said in the following pages. \[2\] A
few words must here be added in regard to the internal sense. The
internal sense of the Word is especially for those who are in the other
life. When those who are there are with a man who is reading the Word,
they perceive it according to the internal sense, and not according to
the external; for they understand no human words, but only the sense of
the words, and this not according to the man's natural thoughts, but
according to their thoughts which are spiritual. Into this spiritual
sense the natural sense that is with the man is at once transmuted, just
as one turns the language of another into his own which is different,
doing it in an instant. So is the sense of natural human thought turned
into spiritual, for spiritual language or speech is proper to the
angels, and natural language or speech to men. That there is so sudden a
change of as it were one language into the other, is because there is a
correspondence of each and all things in the natural world with those in
the spiritual world. \[3\] Now as the internal sense of the Word is
chiefly for those who are in the spiritual world, therefore such things
are here mentioned in the internal sense as are for them, and as are
pleasant and delightful to them. Yet the more interior such things are,
the more remote are they from the apprehension of men to whom only those
things which are of the world and the body are pleasant and delightful;
and when this is the case, they hold in contempt the spiritual things
that belong to the internal sense, and also loathe them. Let everyone
explore within himself whether the things contained in the internal
sense of the verses that now follow are worthless and distasteful to
him, when yet they are what the angelic societies take the greatest
delight in. From this it may be plain to one who reflects what a
difference there is between the delights of men and the delights of
angels, and also in what things the angels vest wisdom, and in what men
vest it - that the angels vest wisdom in such things as man thinks
worthless and holds in aversion, and that man vests wisdom in such
things as the angels care nothing about, and many in such things as the
angels reject and shun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5649.">5649.</span></span>

And they said, Over the word of the silver that was returned in our bags
in the beginning are we brought. That this signifies that because truth
in the exterior natural appears to be given gratuitously, they were
therefore to be in subjection, is evident from the signification of the
"silver being returned," as being truth bestowed gratuitously, (see n.
5530, 5624); from the signification of a "bag," as being the threshold
of the exterior natural (n. 5497); and from the signification of "being
brought," as being to be adjoined or subjected (as shown just above, n.
5648). \[2\] The case herein is this. As it was perceived that the
truths of memory-knowledge in the exterior natural were given
gratuitously, and would therefore be enticed to conjoin themselves with
the internal, and thereby be in subjection to it, they would as just
said be deprived of their freedom, and thereby of all the delight of
life. That this is the case, namely, that it is perceived that truths of
memory-knowledge are bestowed gratuitously, and this in the natural mind
whether exterior or interior, is quite unknown to man. The reason is
that he is in no such perception; for he does not at all know what is
bestowed on him gratuitously, still less what is stored up in the
exterior natural, and what in the interior. The reason why he has not
this perception is usually because worldly and earthly things are dear
to him, and not celestial and spiritual things; and therefore he does
not believe in any influx through heaven from the Lord, thus not at all
that anything is given him; when yet all the truth that he rationally
infers from memory-knowledges, and supposes to be of his own ability, is
such as is given him. Still less can man perceive whether it is placed
in the exterior natural or in the interior, because he is ignorant that
the natural is twofold, namely the outer which draws near to the
external senses, and the inner which draws back from them and turns to
the rational. \[3\] As man knows nothing about either the one or the
other, he can therefore have no perception about such things; for the
knowledge of a thing must come first in order that there may be a
perception of it. Yet the angelic societies know and perceive these
things well and clearly, not only what is bestowed on them gratuitously,
but also where it is, as may be seen from the following experience. When
any spirit who is in good, and hence in ability, comes into an angelic
society, he comes at the same time into all the memory-knowledge and
intelligence the society has, and in which he had not been before; and
he then knows no otherwise than that he had known and understood it so
before, and from himself. But when he reflects, he perceives that it is
gratuitously bestowed on him through that angelic society by the Lord;
and he also knows from the angelic society where it is, whether in the
exterior or in the interior natural. For there are angelic societies
that are in the exterior natural, and there are others that are in the
interior natural. Yet the natural which belongs to them is not such a
natural as man has; but it is a spiritual natural, which has become
spiritual by having been conjoined and subjected to the spiritual. \[4\]
From all this it is evident that the things here related in the internal
sense take place actually so in the other life, namely, that they
perceive what is given them gratuitously, as well as where it is stored
up, although man at this day knows nothing of such things. But in
ancient times they who were of the church knew such things, being taught
them by their memory-knowledges and by their doctrinals. They were
interior men; but since those times men have become successively more
external, insomuch that at this day they are in the body, thus in the
outermost. A sign of this is that they do not even know what the
spiritual and the internal are, nor believe in their existence. Nay, to
such an outermost in the body have they gone away from interior things,
that they do not even believe that there is a life after death, nor that
there is a heaven or a hell. Nay, by receding from interior things they
have gone to such an outermost, and have become so stupid in spiritual
things, as to believe that man's life is like that of beasts, and
therefore that man will die in like manner; and strange to say the
learned believe so more than the simple, and anyone who believes
differently is accounted by them a simpleton.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5650.">5650.</span></span>

To roll down upon us and to cast himself upon us. That this signifies
that on this account they were to be reduced under absolute power, is
evident from the signification of "rolling down upon" anyone, as being
to present him as culpable; and from the signification of "casting one's
self upon" anyone, as being to reduce him under power, here absolute
power, for it follows "and to take us for servants, and our asses." The
case herein is that before the natural man is conjoined with the
spiritual, or the external with the internal, he is left to think
whether he desires to get rid of the concupiscences arising from the
love of self and of the world, together with the things by which he has
defended them, and to yield the command to the spiritual or internal
man. He is left to think this in order that he may be free to choose
what he will. When the natural man apart from the spiritual thinks about
this, he rejects it; for he loves his concupiscences because he loves
himself and the world. Hence he becomes anxious, and supposes that if
these were got rid of he would have no life left, for he vests
everything in the natural or external man; or supposes that afterward he
could do nothing of himself, and all that he would think, will, and do,
would flow in through heaven, thus that he would not be his own master
any longer. When the natural man on being left to himself is in this
state, he draws back and resists. But when some light flows into his
natural through heaven from the Lord, he begins to thinks differently,
namely, that it is better for the spiritual man to have the supremacy,
because thereby he can think and will what is good, and so can come into
heaven, but not if the natural man were to rule. And when he reflects
that all the angels in the universal heaven are of this character, and
that they are consequently in unspeakable joy, he then fights with the
natural man, and at last desires it to be subordinated to the spiritual
man. In this state is the man placed who is to be regenerated, in order
that he may be in freedom to turn whither he will; and so far as he
turns to this in freedom, so far he is being regenerated. All this is
treated of here in the internal sense.
