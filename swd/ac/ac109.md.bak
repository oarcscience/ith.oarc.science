### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="5401.">5401.</span></span>

Jacob. That this signifies the natural as to the truth which is of the
church, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the
doctrine of truth in the natural, and in the supreme sense the Lord's
natural as to truth (see n. 3305, 3509, 3525, 3546, 3599, 4009, 4538).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5402.">5402.</span></span>

That there was produce in Egypt. That this signifies a disposition to
procure truths by means of memory-knowledges which are "Egypt," is
evident from the signification of "produce," as being the truths of the
church, or the truths which are of faith (that "abundance of produce"
denotes the multiplication of truth may be seen above, n. 5276, 5280,
5292); and from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges
(n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462), and in the genuine sense the
memory-knowledges of the church (see n. 4749, 4964, 4966). That a
disposition to procure these things is involved, is plain from what
presently follows. By the memory-knowledges of the church, which here
are "Egypt," are meant all knowledges of truth and good, before they
have been conjoined with the interior man, or through the interior man
with heaven, and thus through heaven with the Lord. The doctrinals of
the church and its rituals, as also the knowledges of what spiritual
things these represent and how, and the like, are nothing but
memory-knowledges until the man has seen from the Word whether they are
true, and in this way has made them his own. \[2\] There are two ways of
procuring the truths which are of faith-by means of doctrinal things,
and by means of the Word. When man procures them only by doctrinal
things, he then has faith in those who have drawn them from the Word,
and he confirms them in himself to be true because others have said so;
thus he does not believe them from his own faith, but from that of
others. But when he procures them for himself from the Word, and thereby
confirms them in himself to be true, he then believes them because they
are from the Divine, and thus believes them from faith given from the
Divine. Everyone who is within the church first procures the truths
which are of faith from doctrinal things, and also must so procure them,
because he has not yet sufficient strength of judgment to enable him to
see them himself from the Word; but in this case these truths are to him
nothing but memory-knowledges. But when he is able to view them from his
own judgment, if he then does not consult the Word in order to see from
it whether they are true, they remain in him as memory-knowledges; while
if he does consult the Word from the affection and end of knowing
truths, he then, when he has found them, procures for himself the things
of faith from the genuine fountain, and they are appropriated to him
from the Divine. These and other like things are what are here treated
of in the internal sense; for "Egypt" denotes these memory-knowledges,
and "Joseph" is truth from the Divine, thus truth from the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5403.">5403.</span></span>

And Jacob said to his sons. That this signifies perception regarding
truths in general, is evident from the signification of "saying," in the
historicals of the Word, as being perception (see n. 1791, 1815, 1819,
1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3395, 3509); and from the
signification of "sons," as being the truths of faith (n. 489, 491, 533,
1147, 2623, 3373, 4257); and because they were the sons of Jacob, truths
in general are signified; for by Jacob's twelve sons, as by the twelve
tribes, were signified all things of faith, thus truths in general (n.
2129, 2130, 3858, 3862, 3926, 3939, 4060).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5404.">5404.</span></span>

Why do ye look at one another? That this signifies why did they
hesitate, may be seen without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5405.">5405.</span></span>

And he said, Behold I have heard that there is produce in Egypt. That
this signifies that truths can be procured by means of
memory-knowledges, may be seen from what was unfolded just above (n.
5402), where it was shown that by there being "produce in Egypt" is
signified a disposition to procure truths by means of memory-knowledges,
which are "Egypt," and also what is meant by the memory-knowledges,
which are "Egypt." "Produce" is here expressed in the original language
by a word that means "breaking," and by a similar word are also meant
"buying" and "selling" where it is said that Jacob's sons "bought" it in
Egypt, and that Joseph "sold" it there. The reason of this is that in
the Ancient Church bread was broken when it was given to another, and by
this was signified to communicate good from one's own, and \[at the same
time\] to appropriate it from one's own, thus to make love mutual. For
when bread is broken and given to another it is communicated from one's
own; or when bread is broken among several, then the one piece of bread
becomes a mutual possession, and consequently there is conjunction
through charity. From this it is plain that the breaking of bread was
significative of mutual love. \[2\] As this rite was accepted and
customary in the Ancient Church, therefore the "breaking" itself meant
produce that was made common. (That "bread" is the good of love may be
seen above, n. 276, 680, 1798, 2165, 2177, 3464, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211,
4217, 4735, 4976.) It was for this reason that the Lord brake the bread
when He gave it, as in Matthew: Jesus took the five loaves, and the two
fishes, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and brake and gave the
bread to the disciples (Matt. 14:19; Mark 6:41; Luke 9:16). In the same:
Jesus took the seven loaves and the fishes; and He gave thanks and
brake, and gave to His disciples, and the disciples to the multitude
(Matt. 15:36; Mark 8:6). Again: Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake
it, and He gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body
(Matt. 26:26; Mark 14:22; Luke 22:19). In Luke: It came to pass when the
Lord was reclining with them, He took the bread, and blessed it and
brake and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew Him.
And the disciples told how the Lord was known of them in the breaking of
the bread (Luke 24:30-31, 35). In Isaiah: This is the fast that I
choose, to break thy bread to the hungry (Isa. 58:6-7).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5406.">5406.</span></span>

Get you down thither, and buy for us from thence. That this signifies
appropriation by means of them, is evident from the signification of
"going down," as being said of going toward exterior things (of which in
what follows); and from the signification of "buying," as being
appropriation (n. 4397, 5374); that this is effected by means of
memory-knowledges is signified by "from thence," that is, from Egypt
(that "Egypt" denotes memory-knowledges has been shown above). In the
Word we often read of "going up" and "going down," when going from one
place to another is spoken of-not because one place was more elevated
than the other, but because "going up" is predicated of going toward
what is interior or higher, and "going down" of going toward what is
exterior or lower; that is to say "going up" is predicated of going
toward spiritual and celestial things, for these are interior, and are
also believed to be higher, and "going down" is predicated of going
toward natural and earthly things, for these are exterior and are also
in appearance lower. For this reason it is that not only here but also
everywhere else in the Word, we read of "going down" from the land of
Canaan to Egypt, and of "going up" from Egypt to the land of Canaan; for
by the "land of Canaan" is signified what is heavenly, and by "Egypt"
what is natural. For the land of Canaan in the representative sense is
the heavenly kingdom, and consequently celestial and spiritual goods and
truths, which also are interiorly in the man who is a kingdom of the
Lord; while Egypt in the representative sense is the natural kingdom,
and consequently the goods and truths which are of the external church,
and are for the most part memory-knowledges. (That "going up" is
predicated of going toward interior things may be seen above, n. 4539.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5407.">5407.</span></span>

And we shall live, and not die. That this signifies spiritual life, is
evident from the signification of "living and not dying," as being
spiritual life, because nothing else is signified in the internal sense
by "living and not dying." For in the other world by "life" is signified
in general heaven, and in particular eternal happiness; and by "death"
is signified in general hell, and in particular eternal unhappiness
there, as is plain from many passages in the Word. That heaven in
general and eternal happiness in particular is called "life," is because
the wisdom of good and the intelligence of truth are there; and in the
wisdom of good and the intelligence of truth is life from the Lord, from
whom is the all of life. But because in hell there is the contrary-evil
in place of good and falsity in place of truth, thus the extinction of
spiritual life-therefore in hell relatively there is death; for
spiritual death is evil and falsity, and in man it is to will evil, and
thence to think falsity. Evil genii and spirits are unwilling to hear it
said of them that they do not live, or that they are dead; for they say
that they have life because they are able to will and to think. But they
are told that as life is in good and truth, it cannot possibly be in
evil and falsity, for these are contrary.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5408.">5408.</span></span>

And they went down. That this signifies endeavor and act, namely to
procure and appropriate truths to themselves by means of
memory-knowledges, is plain from the signification of "going down,"
namely, to Egypt, as being both the endeavor and the act.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5409.">5409.</span></span>

Joseph's ten brethren. That this signifies such truths of the church as
corresponded, is evident from the signification of "brethren," as being
the truths which are of the church. It is from the correspondence that
these are called the "brethren" of Joseph, who is truth from the Divine;
for the correspondence causes them to be conjoined as brother with
brother. By the "sons of Jacob" are signified all things of faith, or
the truths of the church in general (see n. 5403); and the same are
signified by "Joseph's brethren," but from the correspondence. By the
ten sons of Jacob by Leah are signified the truths of the external
church, and by the two sons of Jacob by Rachel are signified the truths
of the internal church, as is plain from what has been shown concerning
Leah and Rachel, that "Leah" is the affection of exterior truth, and
"Rachel" the affection of interior truth (n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819).
That the internal and the external of the church are "brothers," may be
seen above (n. 1222). The Lord Himself calls "brethren" the derivative
truths and goods in correspondence through charity and faith, that is,
those who are in truths and the derivative good; as in Matthew: The King
shall say unto them, Verily I say unto you, insofar as ye have done it
unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto Me
(Matt. 25:40). And in another passage: Jesus answered them, saying, Who
is My mother, or My brethren? And looking round about He said, Behold My
mother and My brethren! For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same
is My brother, and My sister, and My mother (Mark 3:33-35; Matt. 12:49;
Luke 8:21).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5410.">5410.</span></span>

To buy corn from Egypt. That this signifies to appropriate to themselves
the good of truth by means of memory-knowledges, is evident from the
signification of "buying," as being to appropriate (see n. 4397, 5374,
5406); from the signification of "corn," as being the good of truth (n.
5295); and from the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges
(of which above, n. 5402).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5411.">5411.</span></span>

And Benjamin, Joseph's brother. That this signifies the spiritual of the
celestial, which is the intermediate, <span
id="fr_134"></span>[5411-1](#fn_134.md) is evident from the representation
of Benjamin, as being the spiritual of the celestial (as may be seen
above, n. 4592; and also that the spiritual of the celestial is the
intermediate). In general it should be known that the internal cannot
have communication with the external, and the converse, unless there is
an intermediate; consequently that truth from the Divine, which is
"Joseph," cannot have communication with truths in general in the
natural, which are the "sons of Jacob," without the intermediate
represented by Benjamin, and called the "spiritual of the celestial." An
intermediate, to be such, must partake of both the internal and the
external. The reason why there must be an intermediate is that the
internal and the external are most distinct from each other, and so
distinct that they can be separated, just as man's ultimate external,
which is the body, is separated when he dies from his internal, which is
his spirit. The external dies when the intermediate is sundered, and the
external lives when the intermediate is between; and just so far and in
such a way does the external live, as is the intermediate between. As
Jacob's sons were without Benjamin (that is, without the intermediate),
therefore Joseph could not manifest himself to his brethren; and for the
same reason spoke hardly to them, calling them spies, and putting them
in custody; and for the same reason also they did not know Joseph. \[2\]
But what is the nature of this intermediate represented by Benjamin and
called the spiritual of the celestial, cannot be described so as to be
apprehended, for there is a want of knowledge about the celestial of the
spiritual, which is "Joseph," and about the truths of the church insofar
as they are only memory-knowledges, which are the "sons of Jacob;" hence
also about the spiritual of the celestial, which is "Benjamin." But in
heaven the nature of this intermediate appears as in clear day, being
there shown in the light of heaven, in which at the same time is
perception by means of unutterable representatives; for the light of
heaven is intelligence itself from the Divine, and from it there is
perceptive power in regard to everything that is represented by means of
this light. This is not the case with the world's light, which has
nothing of intelligence in it; but by its means understanding is induced
by the influx of the light of heaven into it, and at the same time by
the influx of the perception that is in the light of heaven. Hence it is
that man is so far in the light of heaven as he is in intelligence, and
that he is so far in intelligence as he is in the truths of faith, and
that he is so far in the truths of faith as he is in the good of love;
consequently that man is so far in the light of heaven as he is in the
good of love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5412.">5412.</span></span>

Jacob sent not with his brethren. That this signifies that they were
without this intermediate, may be seen from what has just now been said.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5413.">5413.</span></span>

For he said, Peradventure mischief may befall him. That this signifies
that without the celestial of the spiritual which is "Joseph," it would
perish, is evident from the signification of "mischief befalling," as
here being to perish. This was said by the father because he loved him,
and feared lest he should perish among his brethren, like Joseph; but
these same words were adduced and received in the Word on account of the
internal sense, which is, that with its externals only, without the
internal, the intermediate would perish; for the intermediate is
"Benjamin," the externals are the "sons of Jacob," and the internal is
"Joseph." Every intermediate perishes when it has only the external
things without the internal, because it comes into existence from the
internal, and hence also subsists from it; for it comes into existence
by the internal's looking into the external from the affection and end
of associating the external with itself. Thus the intermediate is
conjoined with the internal, and from the internal with the external,
but not with the external without the internal. From this it is plain
that the intermediate would perish if it were with the external alone
without the internal. Moreover, it is a general law, as well of the
things of the spiritual world as of those of the natural world, that a
thing can subsist with its prior, but not without this with its
posterior, and that it would perish if it were with this alone. The
reason is that everything without connection with what is prior to
itself is without connection with the First, from whom is all coming
into existence, and subsistence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5414.">5414.</span></span>

And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came. That this
signifies that it desired that like all other truths, spiritual truths
should be procured by means of memory-knowledges, is evident from the
signification of the "sons of Israel," as being spiritual truths (for
"sons" are truths, as may be seen above, n. 5403; and "Israel" is the
celestial spiritual man from the natural, n. 4286, 4570, 4598; thus the
"sons of Israel" are spiritual truths in the natural); from the
signification of "buying," as being to be procured; and from the
signification of "in the midst of those that came," as being like all
other truths, that is, in that they are procured by means of
memory-knowledges.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5415.">5415.</span></span>

For the famine was in the land of Canaan. That this signifies that there
was desolation as to the things of the church in the natural, is evident
from the signification of "famine," as being a lack of knowledges, and
the consequent desolation (see n. 3364, 5277, 5279, 5281, 5300, 5349,
5360, 5376); and from the signification of the "land of Canaan," as
being the church (n. 3686, 3705, 4447); and because it is the church, it
is also that which is of the church. Hence it is that by the "famine
being in the land of Canaan" is signified desolation as to the things of
the church. That the desolation was in the natural, is because these
things are predicated of the sons of Jacob, by whom are signified the
things of the external church (n. 5409), consequently those of the
church in the natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5416.">5416.</span></span>

Verses 6-8. And Joseph he was the governor over the land; he it was that
sold to all the people of the land; and Joseph's brethren came, and
bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth. And Joseph
saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them,
and spoke hard things with them; and he said unto them, Whence came ye?
And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. And Joseph knew his
brethren, but they knew not him. "And Joseph he was the governor over
the land," signifies that the celestial of the spiritual, or truth from
the Divine, reigned in the natural where memory-knowledges were; "he it
was that sold to all the people of the land," signifies that from this
was all appropriation; "and Joseph's brethren came," signifies the
general truths of the church without mediation; "and bowed down
themselves to him with their faces to the earth," signifies humiliation;
"and Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them," signifies perception
and acknowledgment by the celestial of the spiritual; "but made himself
strange unto them," signifies non-conjunction because without an
intermediate; "and spoke hard things with them," signifies hence also
non-correspondence; "and he said unto them, Whence came ye?" signifies
exploration; "and they said, From the land of Canaan," signifies that
they were of the church; "to buy food," signifies to appropriate the
truth of good; "and Joseph knew his brethren," signifies that these
truths of the church appeared to the celestial of the spiritual from its
light; "but they knew not him," signifies that truth from the Divine did
not appear in natural light not yet illumined by heavenly light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5417.">5417.</span></span>

And Joseph he was the governor over the land. That this signifies that
the celestial of the spiritual, or truth from the Divine, reigned in the
natural where memory-knowledges were, is evident from the representation
of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual (see n. 4286, 4963,
5249, 5307, 5331, 5332; that the celestial of the spiritual is truth
from the Divine will be seen below); from the signification of a
"governor," as being one who reigns; and from the signification of
"land," here the land of Egypt, as being the natural mind, thus the
natural (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301). (That the celestial of the
spiritual reigned in the natural where memory-knowledges were, may be
seen above, n. 5313; and also that "Egypt" in the internal sense is
memory-knowledge, n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966.) That the
celestial of the spiritual is truth from the Divine, is because the
Lord's internal Human, before it was fully glorified, being the
receptacle of the Divine Itself, was the celestial of the spiritual,
which must be so called because it cannot be expressed in any other
words or forms of thought. This receptacle or recipient of the Divine is
the same as truth from the Divine (that "Joseph" is this truth may be
seen above, n. 4723, 4727).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5418.">5418.</span></span>

He it was that sold to all the people of the land. That this signifies
that all appropriation is from him, is evident from the signification of
"selling," as being appropriation (see n. 5371, 5374); and from the
signification of the "people of the land," as being the truths of the
church (n. 2928), here in the natural (n. 5409).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5419.">5419.</span></span>

And Joseph's brethren came. That this signifies the general truths of
the church without mediation, is evident from the signification of
"Joseph's brethren," as being the general truths of the church (of which
above, n. 5409). They were "without mediation" because they were without
Benjamin, who is the intermediate (as may be seen above, n. 5411, 5413).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5420.">5420.</span></span>

And bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth. That
this signifies humiliation, is evident from the signification of "bowing
down themselves," as being humiliation (see n. 2153), and of "with their
faces to the earth," as being the humiliation of adoration (n. 1999). By
humiliation here is not meant humiliation from acknowledgment, thus
internal humiliation, but external humiliation, because it was in the
presence of the governor of the land in accordance with established
custom. That not internal but external humiliation is meant, is because
there was not yet correspondence, and through correspondence
conjunction. When the natural is in this state it can indeed humble
itself, even to the last degree, but only from acquired habit. It is a
gesture without the genuine affection that produces it, thus it is of
the body without its soul. Such is the humiliation here meant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5421.">5421.</span></span>

And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them. That this signifies
perception and acknowledgment by the celestial of the spiritual, is
evident from the signification of "seeing," as being perception (see n.
2150, 3764, 4567, 4723); from the representation of Joseph, as being the
celestial of the spiritual (n. 5417); from the signification of "his
brethren, "as being the general truths of the church (also spoken of
above, n. 5419); and from the signification of "knowing," as being
acknowledgment from perception. In regard to this acknowledgment on the
part of Joseph, and non-acknowledgment on the part of his brethren, see
below (n. 5422, 5427, 5428).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5422.">5422.</span></span>

But made himself strange unto them. That this signifies non-conjunction
because without an intermediate, is evident from the signification of
"making himself strange," as here being non-conjunction because without
an intermediate; for one who is not in reciprocal conjunction, because
without an intermediate, appears strange, just as internal truth, or
truth immediately from the Divine, appears strange to those who are in
external truths. For this reason it is that Joseph made himself strange
to his brethren, not because he was estranged, for he loved them, so
that he turned from them and wept (verse 24); but the strangeness on
their part, because of non-conjunction, is represented by his so bearing
himself. As for example, where it is said in the Word that Jehovah or
the Lord "makes Himself strange" to the people, "opposes" them,
"rejects" them, "condemns," "casts into hell," "punishes," and
"delights" in such things, in the internal sense is meant that the
people make themselves strange to Jehovah or the Lord, oppose Him, are
in evils which reject them from His face, and which condemn them, cast
them into hell, and punish them, and that such things never proceed from
Jehovah or the Lord. But it is so stated in the Word on account of the
appearance; for so it appears to the simple. The case is similar with
internal truths when they are viewed by external truths without
conjunction by what is intermediate; for then these truths appear
altogether strange to external truths, and even sometimes opposite; when
in fact the opposition is not in the internal, but in the external
truths; for these without conjunction by what is intermediate cannot
view the former except from the light of the world separate from the
light of heaven, and consequently as strange to them. But in regard to
this matter more will be said in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5423.">5423.</span></span>

And spoke hard things with them. That this signifies hence also
non-correspondence, is evident from the same explication that was given
above of his "making himself strange" to them. To "make one's self
strange" has regard to the affection of the will, and to "speak hardly"
has regard to the thought of the understanding, for in the internal
sense "to speak" is to think (see n. 2271, 2287, 2619); and the internal
appears strange to the external when there is no affection, and the
internal appears to speak hard things when there is no correspondence.
Correspondence is the appearing of the internal in the external, and its
representation therein; wherefore when there is no correspondence, there
is no appearing of the internal in the external, and therefore no
representation of it therein. Hence comes the hardness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5424.">5424.</span></span>

And he said unto them, Whence came ye? That this signifies exploration,
is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5425.">5425.</span></span>

And they said, From the land of Canaan. That this signifies that they
were of the church, is evident from the signification of the "land of
Canaan," as being the church (see n. 3686, 3705, 4447).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5426.">5426.</span></span>

To buy food. That this signifies to appropriate the truth of good, is
evident from the signification of "buying," as being to appropriate to
themselves (see n. 4397, 5374, 5406, 5410); and from the signification
of "food," as being the truth of good (n. 5293, 5340, 5342).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5427.">5427.</span></span>

And Joseph knew his brethren. That this signifies that these truths of
the church appeared to the celestial of the spiritual from its light, is
evident from the signification of "knowing," as being to perceive, to
see, and thus to appear; from the representation of Joseph, as being the
celestial of the spiritual (of which above); and from the signification
of "his brethren," as being the general truths of the church (of which
also above, n. 5409, 5419). And because by "Joseph's knowing his
brethren" is signified that the general truths of the church appeared to
the celestial of the spiritual, it follows that they appeared from the
light in which the celestial of the spiritual was, thus from the
celestial light of the spiritual. From this light, which is truth from
the Divine (n. 5417), appear all and each of the truths that are below,
or that are in the natural; but not the converse unless there is an
intermediate, still less unless there is correspondence and through
correspondence conjunction. This may be seen from the fact that the
angels who are in the heavens, and thus in the light of heaven, can see
everything that is taking place in the world of spirits, which world is
next beneath the heavens, and also everything that is taking place in
the lower earth, and even in hell; but not the converse. \[2\] It is
also the case that the angels of a higher heaven can see all that is
going on below them in a lower heaven; but not the converse, unless
there is an intermediate. There are also intermediate spirits through
whom the communication is effected to and fro. When therefore they who
are below and have no intermediate, and still more if they have no
correspondence, look into the light of heaven, they see nothing at all,
but everything there appears in darkness; when yet they who are there
are in the clearest day. This may be illustrated by this single
experience. There appeared to me a great city in which were thousands
upon thousands of various objects, all pleasing and beautiful. I saw
them because an intermediate was given me, but the spirits who were with
me, being without an intermediate, could not see the least thing there;
and it was said that they who are not in correspondence, even if they
are in the city, do not perceive a single thing therein. \[3\] Such also
is the case with the interior man, or man's spirit, which is also called
the soul, and which can see everything that exists and takes place in
the exterior man; but not the converse, unless there is a correspondence
and an intermediate. Consequently, to the exterior man not in
correspondence the interior appears as nothing, so much so that when
anything is said about the interior man, it appears to the exterior
either so obscure that he is unwilling even to look in that direction,
or else it appears as naught and not to be credited. But when there is
correspondence, then the exterior man sees through an intermediate what
is going on in the interior; for the light which the interior man has
flows through the intermediate into the light which the exterior has,
that is, heavenly light flows into natural light, and illumines it; from
which illumining appears that which takes place in the interior man.
Hence come intelligence and wisdom to the exterior or natural man. But
if there is no intermediate, and especially if there is no
correspondence, the interior man sees and perceives what is going on in
the exterior, and in a measure leads it; but not the converse. If
however there is contrariety, that is to say, if the exterior man
entirely perverts or extinguishes what flows in through the interior,
the interior man is then deprived of his light which is from heaven, and
communication heavenward is closed to him; but communication from hell
is opened toward the exterior man. On this subject more will be seen in
what now follows.

But they knew not him. That this signifies that truth from the Divine
did not appear in natural light not yet illumined by heavenly light, is
evident from what immediately precedes; for as by "Joseph's knowing his
brethren" is signified that the general truths of the church appeared to
the celestial of the spiritual from its light, it follows that by "their
not knowing him" is signified that the celestial of the spiritual, or
truth from the Divine, did not appear to the general truths of the
church in natural light not yet illumined by heavenly light. How this
matter stands is indeed plain from what was said just above; but as it
is a mystery it may be illustrated by examples-as for instance by the
glory of heaven. They who think about the glory of heaven from natural
light unillumined by the light of heaven, being without an intermediate,
and much more if there is no correspondence, can form no other idea of
it than such as they may have of the glory of the world; as when they
read the prophetic revelations, especially those of John in the
Revelation, that all things in heaven are most magnificent. And if they
are told that the glory of heaven so far surpasses all the magnificence
of the world that the latter can scarcely be compared with it, and yet
that this is not the glory of heaven, but the glory of heaven is the
Divine that shines forth from everything that appears there, and is the
perception of Divine things, and the consequent wisdom; but that this
glory is possessed only by those in heaven who regard the magnificence
there as nothing in comparison with wisdom, and attribute all wisdom to
the Lord and none at all to themselves-when this glory of heaven is
viewed by natural light without an intermediate, and much more if there
is no correspondence, it is not at all acknowledged. \[2\] Let us take
as another example, angelic power. They who think about angelic power,
especially about the power of the archangels mentioned in the Word, from
natural light not illumined by the light of heaven, because without an
intermediate, and much more so if there is no correspondence, cannot
form any other idea of it than as of the power of the mighty in the
world, namely, that they have thousands upon thousands of inferiors over
whom they rule, and that eminence in heaven consists in such rule. And
if they are told that angelic power indeed surpasses all the power of
the mighty in the world, and that it is so great that one of the lesser
angels can drive away myriads of the infernals and thrust them down into
their hells, and that this is the reason why in the Word they are called
"powers" and also "dominions;" while nevertheless the least of them is
the greatest, that is, he is most powerful who believes, wills, and
perceives that all power is from the Lord and none from himself, and
thus they who are powers in heaven are utterly averse to all
self-derived power-this too, when viewed by natural light without an
intermediate, and much more if there is no correspondence, is not
acknowledged. \[3\] Let us take another example. He who looks at freedom
from what is natural without an intermediate, and much more if there is
no correspondence, cannot know otherwise than that freedom consists in
thinking and willing from himself, and in being able to act without
check as he thinks and wills. Wherefore the natural man, in order that
he may have whatever he thinks and wills, desires to be the richest; and
in order that he may be able to do whatever he thinks and wills, desires
to be the most powerful; and he believes that he would then be in the
height of freedom, and hence in happiness itself. But if he is told that
real freedom, which is called heavenly freedom, is not at all like this,
but consists in willing nothing from self, but from the Lord, and also
in thinking nothing from self, but from heaven, and hence that the
angels are overwhelmed with sorrow and grief if permitted to think and
to will from themselves-this is not acknowledged. From these examples it
will to some extent be seen how it is that truth from the Divine does
not appear in natural light not yet illumined by heavenly light, which
is signified by Joseph's brethren "not knowing him."

Verses 9-16. And Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamed of them,
and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye
are come. And they said unto him, Nay my lord, but to buy food are thy
servants come. We are all one man's sons; we are upright; thy servants
are no spies. And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of
the land ye are come. And they said, we thy servants are twelve
brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold the
youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. And Joseph said
unto them, This is it that I spoke unto you, saying, ye are spies;
hereby ye shall be proved; by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth
hence, except your youngest brother come hither. Send one of you, and
let him get your brother, and ye shall be bound, and your words shall be
verified whether there be truth with you; or else by the life of Pharaoh
surely ye are spies. "And Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamed
of them," signifies that the celestial of the spiritual foresaw what
would happen in regard to the general truths of the church in the
natural; "and said unto them" signifies perception thence; "Ye are
spies" signifies that they came only to seek gain; "to see the nakedness
of the land ye are come," signifies that they would like nothing better
than to know in themselves that there are no truths; "and they said unto
him, Nay my lord, we are upright," signifies that they are truths in
themselves; "but to buy food are thy servants come," signifies that they
are to be appropriated to the natural by means of good; "we are all one
man's sons," signifies that these truths are from one origin; "we are
upright," signifies that thus they are truths in themselves; "thy
servants are no spies," signifies that therefore it was not for the sake
of gain; "and he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the
land ye are come" signifies that they do not care whether there are
truths; "and they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren," signifies
that all things of faith were thus conjoined together; "the sons of one
man," signifies from one origin; "in the land of Canaan," signifies in
the church; "and behold the youngest is this day with our father,"
signifies that there was also conjunction with spiritual good; "and one
is not" signifies that the Divine spiritual from which it is does not
appear; and Joseph said unto them," signifies perception concerning that
matter; "This is it that I spoke unto you" signifies that the truth is
as I thought; "saying, ye are spies," signifies that they are in the
truths of the church for the sake of gain; "hereby ye shall be proved,"
signifies it will be seen whether it is so; "by the life of Pharaoh,"
signifies of a certainty; "ye shall not go forth hence, except your
youngest brother come hither," signifies that it must needs be that the
truths with you are such, unless they are conjoined with spiritual good;
"send one of you, and let him get your brother," signifies if only there
is some conjunction with that good; "and ye shall be bound," signifies
even though there is separation in all other respects; "and your words
shall be verified, whether there be truth with you," signifies that it
will then be so; "or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies,"
signifies otherwise it is certain that you have truths only for the sake
of gain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5430.">5430.</span></span>

And Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamed of them. That this
signifies that the celestial of the spiritual foresaw what would happen
in regard to the general truths of the church in the natural, is evident
from the signification of "remembering," as being presence, for the
thing which is remembered becomes present (that "to be remembered" is
predicated of foresight may be seen above, n. 3966); from the
representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual (of
which often above); and from the signification of "dreams," as being
foresight, prediction, and the event (see n. 3698, 5091, 5092, 5104);
here therefore foresight of what would happen to the general truths of
the church in the natural because these truths are signified by the
"sons of Jacob" (n. 5409, 5419). Wherefore also it is said "that he
dreamed of them."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5431.">5431.</span></span>

And said unto them. That this signifies perception thence, is manifest
from the signification of "saying," as being perception (see n. 1791,
1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3509).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5432.">5432.</span></span>

Ye are spies. That this signifies only to seek gain, is evident from the
signification of "spies," as being to seek gain. That nothing else is
signified in the internal sense by "spies," is evident from the series,
for in the internal sense the truths of the church are treated of, that
they are to be appropriated to the natural, and that they cannot be
appropriated to it except by means of influx from the celestial of the
spiritual through an intermediate. These truths of the church are the
"sons of Jacob," or "Joseph's brethren;" the celestial of the spiritual
is "Joseph;" and the intermediate is "Benjamin." How the case herein is
has been told above (n. 5402), that the truths of faith of the church,
which are called doctrinal things, when learned in early life, are taken
into the mind and committed to memory just like any other
memory-knowledges, and remain as such until the man begins to view them
with his own eyes, and see whether they are true, and after seeing that
they are true, wills to act according to them. This viewing of them, and
this will, make them no longer memory-knowledges, but precepts of life,
and finally life; for in this way they enter into the life to which they
are appropriated. \[2\] They who have arrived at maturity, and still
more they who have arrived at old age, and have not viewed with their
own eyes the truths of the church, which are called doctrinal things,
and seen whether they are true, and then been willing to live according
to them, retain them merely as they do all other memory-knowledges; they
are in their natural memory only, and thence on their lips; and when
they utter them, they utter them not from their interior man or from the
heart, but only from the exterior man and from the mouth. When a man is
in this state he cannot possibly believe that the truths of the church
are true, although it seems to him that he so believes. The reason why
it seems to him that he believes them to be true, is that he relies on
others, and has confirmed in himself the teachings of others. It is very
easy to confirm things taken from others, whether true or false; for
this needs nothing but ingenuity. \[3\] These truths of the church, or
they who are in this manner in the truths of the church, are signified
by "spies coming to see the nakedness of the land." For they do not
believe the doctrinal things of their church from any affection of
truth, but from an affection of winning honors or getting gain;
wherefore in themselves they believe scarcely anything, for the most
part denying at heart, and regarding these doctrinal things as a
merchant does his merchandise; and they appear to themselves learned and
wise when from themselves they see that truths are not truths, and yet
can persuade the common people that they are truths. That many of the
church dignitaries are of this character, is very manifest from them in
the other life; for wherever they go there, they are in the sphere of
their affections and derivative thoughts, which sphere is plainly
perceived by others, and it causes the quality of their affection of
truth, and the quality of their faith, to be known to the very senses.
In the world this is not made manifest, for there is not there any
spiritual perception of such things; and this being so they do not
expose themselves, for they would lose their gain. \[4\] That they are
spies may be evident enough from the fact that such persons seek nothing
but faults in those who are in truths from good, in order that they may
accuse and condemn them. Are such persons anything but spies, whether
they belong to the so called Papists, or the Reformed, Quakers,
Socinians, or Jews, when they have once confirmed in themselves the
doctrinals of their church? They ridicule and condemn the veriest
truths, if any such are to be found; for they do not comprehend that
truths are true. The reason of this is that they have no affection of
truth for its own sake, still less for the sake of life, but only for
the sake of gain. Moreover, when such men read the Word they search it
with the sole end of confirming doctrinal memory-knowledges for the sake
of gain; and many of them search the Word that they may see the
nakedness of the land, that is, may see that the truths of the church
are not truths, but only serviceable for persuading others that they are
truths, for the sake of gain. \[5\] But they who are in the affection of
truth for the sake of truth and of life, consequently for the sake of
the Lord's kingdom, have indeed faith in the doctrinal things of the
church; but still they search the Word for no other end than the truth,
from which their faith and their conscience are formed. If anyone tells
them that they ought to stay in the doctrinal things of the church in
which they were born, they reflect that if they had been born in
Judaism, Socinianism, Quakerism, Christian Gentilism, or even out of the
church, the same would have been told them; and that it is everywhere
said, Here is the church! Here is the church! Here are truths and
nowhere else! And this being the case the Word should be searched with
devout prayer to the Lord for enlightenment. Such do not disturb anyone
within the church, nor do they ever condemn others, knowing that
everyone who is a church lives from his faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5433.">5433.</span></span>

To see the nakedness of the land ye are come. That this signifies that
they would like nothing better than to know in themselves that there are
no truths, is evident from the signification of "coming to see," as
being to desire to know that it is so, thus that they would like nothing
better than to know; from the signification of "nakedness," as being to
be without truths, thus that there are no truths (of which in what
follows); and from the signification of "land," as being the church (see
n. 566, 662, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4447, 4535); here
therefore the "nakedness of the land" denotes no truths in the church.
That "nakedness" signifies deprived of truths, or without truths, is
because "garments" in general signify truths, and each specific garment
signifies some particular truth (see n. 2576, 3301, 4545, 4677, 4741,
4742, 4763, 5248, 5319). Hence "nakedness" signifies being without
truths, as will also be seen below from passages taken from the Word.
\[2\] How the case herein is, is plain from what was said just above (n.
5432), that they who learn truths not for the sake of truth and of life,
but for the sake of gain, cannot but think within themselves that the
truths of the church are not truths. The reason is that the affection of
gain is an earthly affection, and the affection of truth is a spiritual
affection. One or the other must have the dominion, for no man can serve
two masters. Therefore where one affection is, the other is not; thus
where there is the affection of truth, there is not the affection of
gain; and where there is the affection of gain, there is not the
affection of truth. Consequently, if the affection of gain has dominion,
it must needs be that nothing is more desired than that truths should
not be truths, and also that they should be believed to be truths by
others; for if the internal man looks downward to earthly things, and
vests everything in them, it is impossible for him to look upward, and
to vest anything in heavenly things, because the earthly things
completely absorb and stifle the heavenly things. The reason is that the
angels of heaven cannot be with man in earthly things, and therefore
they draw back, and the infernal spirits then come near, who cannot be
with man in heavenly things. The result is that heavenly things are
naught to him, and earthly things are everything; and when earthly
things are everything to him, he believes himself to be more learned and
wise than anyone else, in that to himself he denies the truths of the
church, saying at heart that they are for the simple. Man must therefore
be either in earthly affection or in heavenly affection, for he cannot
be at the same time with the angels of heaven and with the infernals;
because he would then hang between heaven and hell. But when he is in
the affection of truth for the sake of truth, that is, for the sake of
the Lord's kingdom, where the Divine truth is, thus for the sake of the
Lord Himself, he is then among angels, nor does he then despise gain so
far as it is useful for his life in the world; but he has as the end,
not gain, but uses therefrom, which he looks upon as mediate ends to the
final heavenly end; thus by no means does he set his heart upon gain.
\[3\] That "nakedness" signifies to be without truths, may be seen from
other passages in the Word, as in the Revelation: To the angel of the
church of the Laodiceans write, Because thou sayest I am rich, and have
been enriched, so that I have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou
art wretched and miserable and needy and blind and naked (Rev. 3:17);
where "naked" denotes penury of truth. In the same: I counsel thee to
buy of Me gold purified in the fire, that thou mayest be rich, and white
garments, that thou mayest be clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness be
not made manifest (Rev. 3:18); "to buy gold" denotes to procure and
appropriate good to one's self; "that thou mayest be rich," denotes
being in celestial and spiritual good; "white garments" denote spiritual
truths; the "shame of thy nakedness" denotes being without goods and
truths. (That "to buy" is to procure and to appropriate to one's self
may be seen above, n. 5374; also that "gold" is celestial and spiritual
good, n. 1551, 1552; that "garments" are truths, n. 1073, 2576, 4545,
4763, 5248, 5319; and that "white" is predicated of truth, because from
the light of heaven, n. 3301, 3993, 4007, 5319.) \[4\] Again: Behold I
come as a thief, blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments,
lest he walk naked (Rev. 16:15); "he that keepeth his garments" denotes
him that keepeth truths; "lest he walk naked," denotes being without
truths. In Matthew: The King shall say unto them on His right hand, I
was naked, and ye clothed Me; and to them on His left, I was naked, and
ye clothed Me not (Matt. 25:36, 43); where "naked" denotes the good who
acknowledge that there is nothing of good and truth in themselves (n.
4958). \[5\] In Isaiah: Is not this the fast, to break thy bread to the
hungry, and that thou bring the afflicted that are cast out into thy
house? When thou seest the naked that thou cover him? (Isa. 58:7); where
the meaning is similar. In Jeremiah: Jerusalem hath sinned a sin;
therefore she hath become a menstruous woman; all that honored her
despise her, because they have seen her nakedness (Lam. 1:8); where
"nakedness" denotes without truths. In Ezekiel: Thou hast come into
comelinesses of comelinesses, the paps have been made firm, and thy hair
was grown, yet thou wast naked and bare. I spread My skirt over thee,
and covered thy nakedness. Thou hast not remembered the days of thy
youth, when thou wast naked and bare (Ezek. 16:7-8, 22); \[6\] this is
said of Jerusalem, by which is meant the Ancient Church, as it was when
set up, and as it afterward became, namely, that at first it was without
truths, but afterward was instructed in them, and at last rejected them.
Again: If a just man who hath done judgment and justice give his bread
to the hungry, and cover the naked with a garment (Ezek. 18:5, 7); where
"to cover the naked with a garment" denotes to instruct in truths those
who desire them. In Hosea: Lest I strip her naked, and show her as in
the day that she was born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her
like a land of drought, and slay her with thirst (Hos. 2:3); where
"stripping naked" denotes to deprive of truths. In Nahum: I will show
the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame (Nah. 3:5); where
"showing the nations the nakedness" denotes to show the ugliness; for
all ugliness is from want of truths, and all beauty is from truths (n.
4985, 5199).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5434.">5434.</span></span>

And they said unto him, Nay my lord, we are upright. That this signifies
that they are truths in themselves, is evident from the signification of
"saying to him, Nay my lord," as being that they did not come to seek
gain, which is signified by Joseph's words, "Ye are spies" (see n.
5432), and that it was not the case that they would like nothing better
than to know in themselves that there are no truths, as is signified by
Joseph's words, "To see the nakedness of the land ye are come" (n.
5433); and from the signification of "we are upright," as being that
they are truths in themselves; for in the internal sense "upright"
signifies truth, in this as in many other passages of the Word. This
meaning-that they are truths in themselves-follows from the series; for
to those who have procured for themselves the truths of the church for
the purpose of gain, truths are indeed not truths (as was shown above,
n. 5433); yet they may be truths in themselves, for the very truths of
the church in general are signified by the "sons of Jacob." That by the
"upright" are meant truths in the abstract, is because in the internal
sense everything is abstracted from person, and the idea of person is
turned into the idea of thing (see n. 5225, 5287). The reason of this is
that otherwise the thought and derivative speech must needs be drawn
away and lost from the thing itself and the view of it, to such things
as are of person; and moreover the thought and derivative speech can in
no other way become universal, and comprehend many things at the same
time, still less things unlimited and unutterable, as with the angels.
Nevertheless this abstracted idea involves persons, namely, those who
are in the things in question. Hence it is that by "the upright" are
signified truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5435.">5435.</span></span>

But to buy food are thy servants come. That this signifies that they,
namely these truths, are to be appropriated to the natural by means of
good, is evident from the signification of "servants," as being things
lower and relatively natural (see n. 2541, 3019, 3020, 5161, 5164,
5305); hence also truths (n. 3409), for truths are subject to good, and
things subject are in the Word called "servants"-here therefore truths
in the natural in respect to the celestial of the spiritual; from the
signification of "buying," as being to be appropriated (n. 4397, 5374,
5406, 5410); and from the signification of "food," as being celestial
and spiritual good (n. 5147), and also truth adjoined to good (n. 5340,
5342); here therefore truth to be adjoined to the natural by means of
good, and thus to be appropriated. Truth is never appropriated to man
otherwise than by means of good; but when it is so appropriated, then
truth becomes good, because it then acts as one with it; for together
they make as it were one body, the soul of which is good, the truths in
this good being as it were the spiritual fibers which form the body.
Wherefore by fibers are signified the inmost forms proceeding from good,
and by nerves are signified truths (see n. 4303, 5189).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5436.">5436.</span></span>

We are all one man's sons. That this signifies that these truths are
from one origin, is evident from the signification of "sons," here the
sons of Jacob, as being truths in general (of which often before). That
their being "one man's sons" signifies that they are from one origin, is
evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5437.">5437.</span></span>

We are upright. That this signifies that thus they are truths in
themselves, is evident from the signification of "we are upright," as
being truths in themselves (of which just above, n. 5434).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5438.">5438.</span></span>

Thy servants are no spies. That this signifies that it was not for the
sake of gain, is evident from the signification of "spies," as being
those who are in the truths of the church for the sake of gain (as shown
above, n. 5432); here that it was not so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5439.">5439.</span></span>

And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are
come. That this signifies that they did not care whether there are
truths, is evident from the signification of "coming to see the
nakedness of the land," as being to like nothing better than to know in
themselves that there are no truths (see n. 5433); here, that they did
not care whether there are truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5440.">5440.</span></span>

And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren. That this signifies
that all things of faith were thus conjoined together, is evident from
the signification of "twelve," as being all things, and when as here
predicated of the sons of Jacob, or of the tribes named after them, and
also of the apostles, all things of faith in one complex (see n. 577,
2089, 2129, 2130, 2553, 3272, 3488, 3858, 3862, 3913, 3926, 3939, 4060);
and from the signification of "brethren," as being conjunction through
good; for when truths are conjoined by means of good, they take on as it
were a brotherhood among themselves. If when without good they appear
conjoined, they nevertheless are not conjoined; for falsities of evil
are always entering and disjoining them. The reason of this is that they
have not one origin from which they are derived, nor one end to which
they are directed. For there to be conjunction the first and the last
must be conjoined; the first must be the good from which they come, and
the last must be the good to which they tend. Furthermore, for truths to
be conjoined, good must reign universally; for that which reigns
universally, conjoins. (That a "brother" denotes the affection of good,
thus good, may be seen above, n. 2360, 2524, 3303, 3459, 3803, 3815,
4121.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5441.">5441.</span></span>

The sons of one man. That this signifies from one origin, is evident
from what was said just above (n. 5436), where similar words occur.

In the land of Canaan. That this signifies in the church, is evident
from the signification of the "land of Canaan," as being the Lord's
kingdom and the church (see n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 3038, 3481, 3686, 3705,
4447).

And behold the youngest is this day with our father. That this signifies
that there was also conjunction with spiritual good, is evident from the
representation of Benjamin, who is here "the youngest," as being an
intermediate that conjoins (of which in what follows); and from the
representation of Jacob, here Israel, who is the "father," as being
spiritual good (n. 3654, 4598). That "Benjamin" is the spiritual of the
celestial, which is an intermediate, may be seen above (n. 4592, 5411,
5413, 5419); that is, an intermediate between the natural, or the things
of the natural, and the celestial of the spiritual, which is "Joseph."
And as "Benjamin" is an intermediate, and "Israel" spiritual good,
therefore by the words, "Behold the youngest is this day with our
father" is signified conjunction with spiritual good.

And one is not. That this signifies that the Divine spiritual, which is
the source, does not appear, is evident from the representation of
Joseph, who here is the "one," as being the celestial of the spiritual,
or what is the same thing, the Divine spiritual, or truth from the
Divine (see n. 3969, 4286, 4592, 4723, 4727, 4963, 5249, 5307, 5331,
5332, 5417), and because all conjunction of truth in the natural
proceeds from the Divine spiritual, it is called "the Divine spiritual
which is the source;" and from the signification of "is not," as being
that it does not appear; for it was, but did not appear to them, because
the intermediate, which is "Benjamin," was not there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5445.">5445.</span></span>

And Joseph said unto them. That this signifies perception concerning
this matter, namely, concerning the things which his brethren spoke, is
evident from the signification of "saying" in the historicals of the
Word, as being perception (see n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919,
2080, 2619, 3509).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5446.">5446.</span></span>

This is it that I spoke unto you. That this signifies that the truth is
as I thought, is evident from the signification of "speaking," as being
to think (see n. 2271, 2287, 2619); that it signifies that this is the
truth, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5447.">5447.</span></span>

Saying, ye are spies. That this signifies that they are in the truths of
the church for the sake of gain, is evident from the signification of
"spies," as being those who are in the truths of the church only to seek
gain (n. 5432, 5438).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5448.">5448.</span></span>

Hereby ye shall be proved. That this signifies that it will be seen
whether it is so, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5449.">5449.</span></span>

By the life of Pharaoh. That this signifies of a certainty, is evident
from the fact that "by the life of Pharaoh," is a form of emphatic
assertion, thus implying that it is certain. Joseph indeed knew that
they were not spies, and that they did not come to see the nakedness of
the land; yet he so asserted because in the internal sense it was
certain that the truths of the church, in whomsoever they are, without
conjunction through good with the interior man, have as the end nothing
but gain; but when they have been conjoined through good with the
interior man, they have as the end good and truth itself, thus the
church, the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord Himself; and when they have
these as the end, then as much gain falls to their share as is needed,
according to the Lord's words in Matthew: Seek ye first the kingdom of
God, and His righteousness, and all things shall be added unto you
(Matt. 6:33).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5450.">5450.</span></span>

Ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
That this signifies that it must needs be that the truths with you are
such, unless conjoined with spiritual good, cannot be so well unfolded
according to the significations of the words themselves; but this
meaning results therefrom; for conjunction with spiritual good is here
signified by the "youngest brother" (see n. 5443).
