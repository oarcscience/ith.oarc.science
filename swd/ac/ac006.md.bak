### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="251.">251.</span></span>

The reason why the "serpent" means all evil in general, and specifically
the love of self, is that all evil has had its rise from that sensuous
part of the mind, and also from that memory-knowledge \[scientifico\],
which at first were signified by the "serpent;" and therefore it here
denotes evil of every kind, and specifically the love of self, or hatred
against the neighbor and the Lord, which is the same thing. As this evil
or hatred was various, consisting of numerous genera and still more
numerous species, it is described in the Word by various kinds of
serpents, as "snakes" "cockatrices" "asps" "adders" "fiery serpents"
"serpents that fly" and "that creep" and "vipers" according to the
differences of the poison, which is hatred. Thus we read in Isaiah:
Rejoice not thou, whole Philistia, because the rod which smiteth thee is
broken, for out of the serpent's root shall go forth a cockatrice, and
his fruit shall be a flying fire-serpent (Isa. 14:29).The "serpent's
root" denotes that part of the mind, or that principle, which is
connected with the senses and with memory-knowledge \[est sensuale et
scientificum\]; the "cockatrice" denotes evil originating in the falsity
thence derived; and the "flying fire-serpent" the cupidity that comes
from the love of self. By the same Prophet also similar things are
elsewhere thus described: They hatch cockatrice's eggs, and weave the
spider's web; he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and when it is crushed
there cometh out a viper (Isa. 59:5). The serpent described here in
Genesis is called in the Revelation the "great and red dragon" and the
"old serpent" and also the "devil and satan" that "deceives the whole
world" (12:3, 9; 20:2), where, and also in other places, by the "devil"
is not meant any particular devil who is prince over the others, but the
whole crew of evil spirits, and evil itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="252.">252.</span></span>

That by the "woman" is meant the church, is evident from what was said
above (n. 155) concerning the heavenly marriage. Such is the nature of
the heavenly marriage, that heaven, and consequently the church, is
united to the Lord by its Own, insomuch that these are in their Own, for
without their Own there can be no union. When the Lord in mercy
insinuates innocence, peace, and good into this Own, it still retains
its identity, but becomes heavenly and most happy (as may be seen at n.
164). The quality of a heavenly and angelic Own from the Lord, and the
quality of an Own, which, because from self, is infernal and diabolical,
cannot be told. The difference is like that between heaven and hell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="253.">253.</span></span>

It is by virtue of a heavenly and angelic Own that the church is called
a "woman" and also a "wife" a "bride" a "virgin" and a "daughter." She
is called a "woman" in the Revelation: A woman clothed with the sun, and
the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars. And
the dragon persecuted the woman who brought forth the man child (Rev.
12:1, 4-5, 13).In this passage by a "woman" is meant the church; by the
"sun" love; by the "moon" faith; by "stars" as before, the truths of
faith, all of which evil spirits hate, and persecute to the utmost. The
church is called a "woman" and also a "wife" in Isaiah: Thy Maker is thy
Husband, Jehovah of Armies is His name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of
Israel, the God of the whole earth is He called; for as a woman forsaken
and afflicted in spirit hath Jehovah called thee, and as a wife of youth
\[adolescentiarum\] (Isa. 54:5-6), where the "Maker" is called also the
"husband" because united to the Own; and a "woman afflicted" and a "wife
of youth" signify specifically the Ancient and Most Ancient Churches.
Likewise in Malachi: Jehovah hath borne witness between thee and the
wife of thy youth \[adolescentiarum\] (Mal. 2:14). She is called a
"wife" and a "bride" in the Revelation: I saw the holy city New
Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
adorned for her husband: come hither, I will show thee the bride, the
Lamb's wife (Rev. 21:2, 9). The church is called a "virgin" and a
"daughter" throughout the Prophets.

<span class="margnote"><span id="254.">254.</span></span>

That by the "seed of the serpent" is meant all infidelity, is evident
from the signification of a "serpent" as being all evil; "seed" is that
which produces and is produced, or that which begets and is begotten;
and as the church is here spoken of, this is infidelity. In Isaiah, in
reference to the Jewish Church in its perverted state, it is called a
"seed of evil doers" a "seed of adultery" a "seed of falsehood:" Woe to
the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil doers,
sons that are destroyers they have forsaken Jehovah, they have provoked
the Holy One of Israel, they have estranged themselves backward (Isa.
1:4). Again: Draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the
adulterer. Are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood ?
(Isa. 57:3, 4). And again, speaking of the "serpent" or "dragon" who is
there called Lucifer: Thou art cast out of thy sepulchre like an
abominable shoot, because thou hast corrupted thy land, thou hast slain
thy people the seed of evil doers shall not be called to eternity (Isa
14:19, 20).

<span class="margnote"><span id="255.">255.</span></span>

That the "seed of the woman" signifies faith in the Lord, is evident
from the signification of "woman" as being the church, whose "seed" is
nothing but faith, for it is from faith in the Lord that the church is
called the church. In Malachi, faith is called the "seed of God:"
Jehovah hath witnessed between thee and the wife of thy youth
\[adolescentiarum\]; and not one hath done so who had a residue of the
spirit and wherefore one, seeking the seed of God? but observe ye in
your spirit, lest he deal treacherously against the wife of thy youth
(Mal 2:14, 15). In this passage the "wife of youth" is the Ancient and
Most Ancient Churches, of whose "seed" (or faith) the prophet speaks. In
Isaiah also, in reference to the church: I will pour waters upon the
thirsty, and floods upon the dry I will pour My spirit upon thy seed,
and My blessing upon thine offspring (Isa. 44:3). In the Revelation: The
dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant
of her seed, who were keeping the commandments of God, and have the
testimony of Jesus Christ (Rev. 12:17). And in David: I have made a
covenant with Mine elect, I have sworn unto David My servant, even to
eternity will I establish thy seed, and his seed will I make to endure
forever, and his throne as the days of the heavens his seed shall endure
to eternity, and his throne as the sun before me (Ps. 139:3, 4, 29, 36),
where by "David" is meant the Lord; by "throne" His kingdom; by the
"sun" love; and by "seed" faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="256.">256.</span></span>

Not only is faith, but also the Lord Himself is called the "seed of the
woman" both because He alone gives faith, and thus is faith, and because
He was pleased to be born, and that into such a church as had altogether
fallen into an infernal and diabolical Own through the love of self and
of the world, in order that by His Divine power He might unite the
Divine celestial Own with the human Own in His human essence, so that in
Him they might be a one; and unless this union had been effected, the
whole world must have utterly perished. Because the Lord is thus the
seed of the woman, it is not said "it" but "He."

<span class="margnote"><span id="257.">257.</span></span>

That by the "head of the serpent" is meant the dominion of evil in
general, and specifically of the love of self, is evident from its
nature, which is so direful as not only to seek dominion, but even
dominion over all things upon earth; nor does it rest satisfied with
this, but aspires even to rule over everything in heaven, and then, not
content with this, over the Lord himself, and even then it is not
satisfied. This is latent in every spark of the love of self. If it were
indulged, and freed from restraint, we should perceive that it would at
once burst forth and would grow even to that aspiring height. Hence it
is evident how the "serpent" or the evil of the love of self, desires to
exercise dominion, and how much it hates all those who refuse its sway.
This is that "head of the serpent" which exalts itself, and which the
Lord "tramples down" even to the earth, that it may "go upon its belly,
and eat dust" as stated in the verse immediately preceding. Thus also is
described the "serpent" or "dragon" called "Lucifer" in Isaiah: O
Lucifer, thou hast said in thy heart, I will ascend the heavens, I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God, and I will sit upon the mount of
the congregation, in the sides of the north, I will ascend above the
heights of the cloud, I will be made equal to the Most High yet thou
shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit (Isa. 14:12-15).
The "serpent" or "dragon" is also described in the Revelation in regard
to the way in which he exalts his head: A great red dragon, having seven
heads, and ten horns, and many diadems upon his heads; but he was cast
into the earth (Rev. 12:3, 9). In David: The saying of Jehovah to my
Lord, Sit Thou at My right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy
footstool: Jehovah shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion, He
shall judge the nations, He hath filled with dead bodies, He hath
bruised the head over much land; He shall drink of the brook in the way,
therefore shall He lift up the head (Ps. 110:1-2, 6-7).

<span class="margnote"><span id="258.">258.</span></span>

That by "trampling on" or "bruising" is meant depression, so as to
compel it to "go on the belly and eat the dust" is now evident from this
and the preceding verses. So likewise in Isaiah: Jehovah hath cast down
them that dwell on high; the exalted city He will humble it; He will
humble it even to the earth; He will prostrate it even to the dust; the
foot shall tread it down (Isa. 26:4-6). Again: He shall cast down to the
earth with the hand; they shall be trampled on by feet-a crown of pride
(Isa. 28:2-3).

<span class="margnote"><span id="259.">259.</span></span>

That by the "heel" is meant the lowest natural or corporeal cannot be
known unless the way in which the most ancient people considered the
various things in man is known. They referred his celestial and
spiritual things to the head and face; what comes forth from these (as
charity and mercy), to the chest natural things, to the feet; lower
natural things, to the soles of the feet; and the lowest natural and
corporeal things, to the heel; nor did they merely refer to them, but
also so called them. The lowest things of reason, that is,
memory-knowledges \[scientifica\], were also meant by what Jacob
prophesied concerning Dan: Dan shall be a serpent upon the way, an adder
upon the path, biting the horse's heels, and his rider falls backward
(Gen. 49:17). Also in David: The iniquity of my heels hath compassed me
about (Ps. 49:5). In like manner by what is related of Jacob, when he
came forth from the womb, That his hand laid hold of Esau's heel, whence
he was called Jacob (Gen. 25:26),for the name "Jacob" comes from the
"heel" because the Jewish Church, signified by "Jacob" injured the heel.
A serpent can injure only the lowest natural things, but unless it is a
species of viper, not the interior natural things in man, still less his
spiritual things, and least of all his celestial things, which the Lord
preserves and stores up in man without his knowledge. What are thus
stored up by the Lord are called in the Word "remains." The mode in
which the serpent destroyed those lowest natural things in the people
before the flood, by the sensuous principle and the love of self; and
among the Jews, by sensuous things, traditions, trifles, and by the love
of self and of the world; and how at this day he has destroyed and
continues to destroy them by the things of sense, of memory-knowledge,
and of philosophy, and at the same time by the same loves, shall of the
Lord's Divine mercy be told hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="260.">260.</span></span>

From what has been said it is evident that it was revealed to the church
of that time that the Lord would come into the world to save them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="261.">261.</span></span>

Verse 16. And unto the woman He said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth sons, and thine
obedience shall be to thy man \[vir\], and he shall rule over thee. By
the "woman" is now signified the church as to proprium, which it loved;
by "greatly multiplying her sorrow" is signified combat, and the anxiety
it occasions; by "conception" every thought; by the "sons whom she would
bring forth in sorrow" the truths which she would thus produce; by "man"
here as before, the rational which it will obey, and which will rule.

<span class="margnote"><span id="262.">262.</span></span>

That the church is signified by the "woman" has been previously shown,
but here the church perverted by the Own which was itself formerly
signified by the "woman" because the posterity of the Most Ancient
Church, which had become perverted, is now treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="263.">263.</span></span>

When therefore the sensuous part averts itself or curses itself, the
consequence is that evil spirits begin to fight powerfully, and the
attendant angels to labor, and therefore this combat is described by the
words, "I will greatly multiply thy sorrow, in relation to the
conception and birth of sons" that is, as to the thoughts and
productions of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="264.">264.</span></span>

That the "conception and birth of sons" in the Word, are taken in a
spiritual sense-"conception" for the thought and device of the heart,
and "sons" for truths, is evident from Hosea: As for Ephraim, their
glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb: and
from the conception; though they shall have brought up their sons, yet
will I bereave them, that they be not man; yea, woe also to them when I
depart from them (Hos. 9:11-12), where "Ephraim" signifies the
intelligent, or the understanding of truth; and "sons" truths
themselves. It is likewise said elsewhere concerning Ephraim, or one who
is intelligent, who has become foolish: The sorrows of one in travail
have come upon him, he is an unwise son, for at the time he will not
stand in the breach of the womb of sons (Hos. 13:13). And in Isaiah:
Blush, O Zidon, for the sea hath spoken, the fortress of the sea,
saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, nor have I brought up
young men, nor caused girls to grow up; as at the report concerning
Egypt, they shall bring forth according to the report of Tyre (Isa.
23:4-5), where "Zidon" means those who have been in the knowledges of
faith, but have destroyed them by memory-knowledges \[scientifica\], and
so have become barren. \[2\] Again in the same prophet, treating of
regeneration, and where likewise the truths of faith are signified by
"sons": Before she travailed she bringeth forth; and before her pain
came, she was delivered of a man child; who hath heard such a thing? who
hath seen such things? shall the earth bring forth in one day? and shall
I not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah; shall I cause to bring forth,
and close up? saith thy God (Isa. 66:7-9). Goods and truths, being
conceived and born of the heavenly marriage, are therefore called "sons"
by the Lord in Matthew: He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man
the field is the world and the seed are the sons of the kingdom (Matt.
13:37-38). And the goods and truths of a saving faith He calls "sons of
Abraham" (John 8:39); for "seed" (as stated n. 255) denotes faith,
wherefore "sons" which are of the "seed" are the goods and truths of
faith. Hence also the Lord, as being Himself the "seed" called Himself
the "Son of man" that is, the faith of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="265.">265.</span></span>

That by "man \[vir\]" is signified the rational, appears from verse 6 of
this chapter, in that the woman gave to her man with her, and he did
eat, by which is meant his consent; and the same is also evident from
what was said of the man in n. 158, where by him is meant one who is
wise and intelligent. Here however "man" denotes the rational, because
in consequence of the destruction of wisdom and intelligence by eating
of the tree of knowledge, nothing else was left, for the rational is
imitative of intelligence, being as it were its semblance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="266.">266.</span></span>

As every law and precept comes forth from what is celestial and
spiritual, as from its true beginning, it follows that this law of
marriage does so, which requires that the wife, who acts from desire,
which is of what is her own, rather than from reason, like the man,
should be subject to his prudence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="267.">267.</span></span>

Verse 17. And unto the man He said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee,
saying, Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake, in
great sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. By the "man
hearkening to the voice of his wife" is signified the consent of the man
\[vir\], or rational, by which it also averted or cursed itself, and
consequently the whole external man, denoted by "cursed is the ground
for thy sake." To "eat thereof in sorrow" means that the future state of
his life would be miserable, and this even to the end of that church, or
"all the days of his life."

<span class="margnote"><span id="268.">268.</span></span>

That the "ground" signifies the external man, is evident from what was
previously stated concerning "earth" "ground" and "field." When man is
regenerate, he is no longer called "earth" but "ground" because
celestial seed has been implanted in him; he is also compared to
"ground" and is called "ground" in various parts of the Word. The seeds
of good and truth are implanted in the external man, that is, in his
affection and memory, and not in the internal man, because there is
nothing of one's Own in the internal man, but only in the external. In
the internal man are goods and truths, and when these no longer appear
to be present, the man is external or corporeal; they are however stored
up in the internal man by the Lord, without the man's knowledge, as they
do not come forth except when the external man as it were dies, as is
usually the case during temptations, misfortunes, sicknesses, and at the
hour of death. The rational belongs also to the external man (n. 118),
and is in itself a kind of medium between the internal man and the
external; for the internal man, through the rational, operates on the
corporeal external. But when the rational consents, it separates the
external man from the internal, so that the existence of the internal
man is no longer known, nor consequently the intelligence and wisdom
which are of the internal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="269.">269.</span></span>

That Jehovah God (that is, the Lord) did not "curse the ground" or the
external man, but that the external man averted or separated itself from
the internal, and thus cursed itself, is evident from what was
previously shown (n. 245).

<span class="margnote"><span id="270.">270.</span></span>

That to "eat of the ground in great sorrow" signifies a miserable state
of life, is evident from what precedes and follows, not to mention that
to "eat" in the internal sense, is to live. The same is evident also
from the fact that such a state of life ensues when evil spirits begin
to fight, and the attendant angels to labor. This state of life becomes
more miserable when evil spirits begin to obtain the dominion; for they
then govern the external man, and the angels only the internal man, of
which so little remains that they can scarcely take anything thence with
which to defend the man; hence arise misery and anxiety. Dead men are
seldom sensible of such misery and anxiety, because they are no longer
men, although they think themselves more truly so than others; for they
know no more than the brutes of what is spiritual and celestial, and
what is eternal life, and like them they look downward to earthly
things, or outward to worldly ones; they favor only their Own, and
indulge their inclinations and senses with the entire concurrence of the
rational. Being dead, they sustain no spiritual combat or temptation,
and were they exposed to it their life would sink under its weight, and
they could thereby curse themselves still more, and precipitate
themselves still more deeply into infernal damnation: hence they are
spared this until their entrance into the other life, where, being no
longer in danger of dying in consequence of any temptation or misery,
they endure most grievous sufferings, which likewise are here signified
by the ground being cursed, and eating of it in great sorrow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="271.">271.</span></span>

That "all the days of thy life" signifies the end of the days of the
church, is evident from the fact that the subject here treated of is not
an individual man, but the church and its state. The end of the days of
that church was the time of the flood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="272.">272.</span></span>

Verse 18. And the thorn and the thistle shall it bring forth unto thee,
and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. By the "thorn and the thistle"
are meant curse and vastation; and by "thou shalt eat the herb of the
field" is signified that he should live as a wild animal. Man lives like
a wild animal when his internal man is so separated from his external as
to operate upon it only in a most general manner, for man is man from
what he receives through his internal man from the Lord, and is a wild
animal from what he derives from the external man, which, separated from
the internal, is in itself no other than a wild animal, having a similar
nature, desires, appetites, phantasies, and sensations, and also similar
organic forms. That nevertheless he is able to reason, and, as it seems
to himself, acutely, he has from the spiritual substance by which he
receives the influx of life from the Lord, which is however perverted in
such a man, and becomes the life of evil, which is death. Hence he is
called a dead man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="273.">273.</span></span>

That the "thorn and the thistle" signify curse and vastation, is evident
from harvest and fruit tree denoting the opposites, which are blessings
and multiplications. That the "thorn" the "thistle" the "brier" the
"bramble" and the "nettle" have such a signification, is evident from
the Word, as in Hosea: Lo, they are gone away because of the vastation;
Egypt shall gather them; Memphis shall bury them; their desirable things
of silver, the nettle shall inherit them; the bramble shall be in their
tents (Hos. 9:6). Here "Egypt" and "Memphis" denote such as seek to
understand Divine things from themselves and their own
memory-knowledges. In the same Prophet: The lofty places of Aven, the
sin of Israel, shall be destroyed; the thorn and the thistle shall come
up upon their altars (Hos. 10:8), where the "lofty places of Aven"
signify the love of self; and the "thorn and thistle on the altars"
profanation. In Isaiah: Mourning upon the paps for the fields of desire,
for the fruitful vine; upon the ground of My people shall come up the
briery thorn (Isa. 32:12-13). And in Ezekiel: There shall be no more a
pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor a painful thorn from all
that are round about them (Ezek. 28:24).

<span class="margnote"><span id="274.">274.</span></span>

That to "eat the herb of the field" (that is, wild food) denotes to live
like a wild animal, is evident from what is said of Nebuchadnezzar in
Daniel: They shall drive thee from man, and thy dwelling shall be with
the beast of the field; they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen, and
seven times shall pass over thee (Dan 4:25). And in Isaiah: Hast thou
not heard how I have done it long ago, and from the days of old have I
formed it; now have I brought it to pass, and it shall be to lay waste
bulwarks, fenced cities, in heaps; and their inhabitants, short of hand,
were dismayed and put to shame; they were made the grass of the field,
and the green \[olus\] of the herb, the grass of the housetops, and a
field parched before \[coram\] the standing corn (Isa. 37:26-27). Here
it is explained what is signified by the "grass of the field" the "green
of the herb" the "grass on the housetops" and a "field parched;" for the
subject here treated of is the time before the flood, which is meant by
"long ago" and the "days of old."

<span class="margnote"><span id="275.">275.</span></span>

Verse 19. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou
art, and unto dust shalt thou return. By "eating bread in the sweat of
the face" is signified to be averse to what is celestial; to "return to
the ground from whence he was taken" is to relapse into the external
man, such as he was before regeneration; and "dust thou art, and unto
dust shalt thou return" signifies that he is condemned and infernal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="276.">276.</span></span>

That to "eat bread in the sweat of the face" signifies to be averse to
what is celestial, is evident from the signification of "bread." By
"bread" is meant everything spiritual and celestial, which is the food
of the angels, on the deprivation of which they would cease to live as
certainly as men deprived of bread or food. That which is celestial and
spiritual in heaven also corresponds to bread on earth, by which
moreover they are represented, as is shown by many passages in the Word.
That the Lord is "bread" because from Him proceeds whatever is celestial
and spiritual, He Himself teaches in John: This is the bread that cometh
down from heaven; he that eateth of this bread shall live to eternity
(John 6:58). Wherefore also bread and wine are the symbols employed in
the Holy Supper. This celestial is also represented by the manna. That
what is celestial and spiritual constitutes the food of angels, is
manifest from the Lord's words: Man shall not live by bread alone, but
by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God (Matt. 4:4), that
is, from the life of the Lord, from which comes everything celestial and
spiritual. \[2\] The last posterity of the Most Ancient Church, which
existed immediately before the flood, and is here treated of, had become
so thoroughly lost and immersed in sensuous and bodily things, that they
were no longer willing to hear what was the truth of faith, what the
Lord was, or that He would come and save them; and when such subjects
were mentioned they turned away. This aversion is described by "eating
bread in the sweat of the face." So also the Jews, in consequence of
their being of such a character that they did not acknowledge the
existence of heavenly things, and desired only a worldly Messiah, could
not help feeling an aversion for the manna, because it was a
representation of the Lord, calling it "vile bread" on which account
fiery serpents were sent among them (Num. 21:5, 6). Moreover the
heavenly things imparted to them in states of adversity and misery, when
they were in tears, were called by them the "bread of adversity" the
"bread of misery" and the "bread of tears." In the passage before us,
that which was received with aversion is called the "bread of the sweat
of the face."

<span class="margnote"><span id="277.">277.</span></span>

This is the internal sense. He who keeps close to the letter,
understands no other than that man must procure bread for himself out of
the ground by labor, or by the sweat of his face. "Man" however does not
here mean anyone man, but the Most Ancient Church; nor does "ground"
mean ground, nor "bread" bread, nor "garden" garden, but celestial and
spiritual things, as has been sufficiently shown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="278.">278.</span></span>

That by "returning to the ground whence he was taken" is signified that
the church would return to the external man such as it was before
regeneration, is evident from the fact that "ground" signifies the
external man, as previously stated. And that "dust" signifies what is
condemned and infernal, is also evident from what was said of the
serpent, which in consequence of being cursed is said to "eat dust." In
addition to what was there shown as to the signification of "dust" we
may add the following passages from David: All those who go down to the
dust shall bow before Jehovah, and those whose soul He hath not made
alive (Ps. 22:29). And in another place: Thou hidest Thy faces, they are
troubled; Thou takest away their breath, they expire, and return to
their dust (Ps. 104:29), which means that when men turn away from the
face of the Lord, they expire or die, and thus "return to the dust" that
is, are condemned and become infernal.

All these verses then, taken in a series, involve that the sensuous part
averted itself from the celestial (verse 14); that the Lord would come
into the world for the purpose of reuniting them (verse 15); that combat
arose in consequence of the external man averting itself (verse 16);
whence resulted misery (verse 17); condemnation (verse 18); and at
length hell (verse 19). These things followed in succession in that
church, from the fourth posterity down to the flood.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 20. And the
man \[homo\] called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of
all living. 21. And Jehovah God made for the man and for his wife coats

become as one of us, knowing good and evil; and now lest he put forth
his hand, and take also of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to
eternity, 23. Therefore Jehovah God sent him forth from the garden of
Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken. 24. And He cast out
the man; and He made to dwell from the east toward the garden of Eden
cherubim, and the flame of a sword turning itself, to keep the way of
the tree of lives.

THE CONTENTS. The Most Ancient Church, and those who fell away, are here
summarily treated of; thus also its posterity down to the flood, when it
expired.

<span class="margnote"><span id="281.">281.</span></span>

Of the Most Ancient Church which was celestial, and from the life of
faith in the Lord, called "Eve" and the "mother of all living" (verse
20).

<span class="margnote"><span id="282.">282.</span></span>

Of its first posterity, in which there was celestial spiritual good; and
of its second and third, in which there was natural good, signified by
the "coat of skin which Jehovah God made for the man and his wife"
(verse 21).

<span class="margnote"><span id="283.">283.</span></span>

Of the fourth posterity, in which natural good began to be dissipated,
and which, had they been created anew or instructed in the celestial
things of faith, would have perished, which is meant by, "Lest he put
forth his hand, and take also of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to
eternity" (verse 22).

<span class="margnote"><span id="284.">284.</span></span>

Of the fifth posterity, which was deprived of all good and truth, and
was reduced to the state in which they had been previous to
regeneration, which is meant by his being "sent forth out of the garden
of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken" (verse 23).

<span class="margnote"><span id="285.">285.</span></span>

Of the sixth and seventh posterities, in that they were deprived of all
memory-knowledge \[scientia\] of what is good and true, and were left to
their own filthy loves and persuasions; this being provided lest they
should profane the holy things of faith, which is signified by his being
"driven out, and cherubim being made to dwell at the garden, with the
flame of a sword, to keep the way of the tree of lives" (verse 24).

<span class="margnote"><span id="286.">286.</span></span>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. This and the preceding chapters, down to the verses
now under consideration, treat of the most ancient people and of their
regeneration; first, of those who lived like wild animals, but at length
became spiritual men; then of those who became celestial men, and
constituted the Most Ancient Church; afterwards of those who fell away,
and their descendants, in regular order through the first, second, and
third posterities and their successors, down to the flood. In the verses
following, which conclude the chapter, we have a recapitulation of what
occurred from the period when the man of the Most Ancient Church was
formed, until the flood; thus it is a conclusion to all that goes
before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="287.">287.</span></span>

Verse 20. And the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the
mother of all living. By the "man" \[homo\] is here meant the man of the
Most Ancient Church, or the celestial man, and by the "wife" and the
"mother of all living" is meant the church. She is called "mother" as
being the first church; and "living" in consequence of possessing faith
in the Lord, who is life itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="288.">288.</span></span>

That by "man" is meant the man of the Most Ancient Church, or the
celestial man, was previously shown; and at the same time it was also
shown that the Lord alone is Man, and that from Him every celestial man
is man, because in His likeness. Hence every member of the church,
without exception or distinction, was called a "man" and at length this
name was applied to anyone who in body appeared as a man, to distinguish
him from beasts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="289.">289.</span></span>

It has also been shown above that by "wife" is meant the church, and in
the universal sense the kingdom of the Lord in the heavens and on earth;
and from this it follows that the same is meant by "mother." In the Word
the church is very frequently called "mother" as in Isaiah: Where is the
bill of your mother's divorcement ? (Isa. 50:1). In Jeremiah: Your
mother is greatly ashamed: she that bare you was suffused with shame
(Jer. 50: 12). In Ezekiel: Thou art thy mother's daughter that loathed
her man and her sons; your mother was a Hittite, and your father an
Amorite (Ezek. 16:45), where "man \[vir\]" denotes the Lord and all that
is celestial; "sons" the truths of faith; a "Hittite" what is false: and
an "Amorite" what is evil. In the same: Thy mother is like a vine in thy
likeness, planted near the waters; she was fruitful and full of leaves
because of many waters (Ezek. 19:10). Here "mother" denotes the Ancient
Church. The term "mother" is more especially applicable to the Most
Ancient Church, because it was the first church, and the only one that
was celestial, and therefore beloved by the Lord more than any other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="290.">290.</span></span>

That she was called the "mother of all living" in consequence of
possessing faith in the Lord, who is Life itself, is also evident from
what has been already shown. There cannot be more than one Life, from
which is the life of all, and there can be no life, which is life,
except through faith in the Lord, who is the Life; nor can there be
faith in which is life, except from Him, consequently unless He is in
it. On this account, in the Word, the Lord alone is called "Living" and
is named the "Living Jehovah" (Jer. 5:2; 12:16; 16:14, 15; 23:7; Ezek.
5:11); "He that liveth to eternity" (Dan. 4:34 Rev. 4:10; 5:14; 10:6);
the "Fountain of Life" (Ps. 36:9); the "Fountain of living waters" (Jer.
17:13). Heaven (which lives by or from Him) is called the "Land of the
living" (Isa. 38:11; 53:8; Ezek. 26:20; 32:23-27, 32; Ps. 27:13; 52:5;
142:5). And those are called "Living" who are in faith in the Lord; as
in David: Who putteth our soul among the living (Ps. 66:9). And those
who possess faith are said to be "in the Book of lives" (Ps. 69:28), and
"in the book of life" (Rev. 13:8; 17:8; 20:15). Wherefore also those who
receive faith in Him are said to be "made alive" (Hos. 6:2; Ps. 85:6).
On the other hand it follows that those who are not in faith are called
"dead;" as in Isaiah: The dead shall not live; the Rephaim shall not
rise again, because Thou hast visited and destroyed them (Isa. 26:14),
meaning those who are puffed up with the love of self; to "rise again"
signifies to enter into life. They are also said to be "pierced" (Ezek.
32:23-26, 28-31). They are also called "dead" by the Lord (Matt. 4:16;
John 5:25; 8:21, 24, 51, 52). Hell also is called "death" (Isa. 25:8;
28:15).

<span class="margnote"><span id="291.">291.</span></span>

In this verse is described the first time, when the church was in the
flower of her youth, representing the heavenly marriage, on which
account she is described by a marriage, and is called "Eve" from a word
meaning "life."

<span class="margnote"><span id="292.">292.</span></span>

Verse 21. And Jehovah God made for the man \[homo\] and for his wife
coats of skin, and clothed them. These words signify that the Lord
instructed them in spiritual and natural good; His instructing them is
expressed by "making" and "clothing" and spiritual and natural good, by
the "coat of skin."

<span class="margnote"><span id="293.">293.</span></span>

It could never appear from the letter that these things are signified;
and yet there is evidently here enfolded some deeper meaning, for
everyone must be aware that Jehovah God did not make a coat of skin for
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="294.">294.</span></span>

Neither would it be evident to anyone that a "coat of skin" signifies
spiritual and natural good, except by a revelation of the internal
sense, and a subsequent comparison of passages in the Word where similar
expressions occur. The general term "skin" is here used, but that of a
kid, sheep, or ram, is understood, which animals in the Word signify
affections of good, charity, and that which is of charity, as was
likewise signified by the sheep used in the sacrifices. Those are called
"sheep" who are endowed with the good of charity, that is, with
spiritual and natural good, and hence the Lord is called the "Shepherd
of the sheep" and those who are endowed with charity are called His
"sheep" as everybody knows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="295.">295.</span></span>

The reason why they are said to be "clothed with a coat of skin" is that
the most ancient people were said to be "naked" on account of their
innocence; but when they lost their innocence they became conscious that
they were in evil, which also is called "nakedness." That all things
might appear to cohere historically (in accordance with the way of
speaking of the most ancient people), they are here said to be "clothed
lest they should be naked" or in evil. Their being in spiritual and
natural good is evident from what was remarked above concerning them,
from verse 1 to 13 of this chapter, as well as from its being here
related that "Jehovah God made them a coat of skin, and clothed them;"
for it here treats of the first-and more especially of the second and
third-posterities of the church, who were endowed with such good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="296.">296.</span></span>

That the skins of kids, sheep, goats, badgers, and rams signify
spiritual and natural goods, is evident from the internal sense of the
word, where Jacob is treated of, and also where the ark is treated of.
Of Jacob it is said that he was "clothed with the raiment of Esau" and
on his hands and on his neck, where he was naked, "with skins of kids of
the goats" and when Isaac smelled them, he said, "the smell of my son is
as the smell of a field" (Gen. 27:15, 16, 27). That these skins signify
spiritual and natural goods, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be seen in
that place. Of the ark it is said that the covering of the tent was "of
rams' skins and badgers' skins" (Exod. 26:14; 36:19), and that when they
set forward Aaron and his sons covered the ark with a covering "of
badgers' skins" and likewise the table and its vessels, the candlestick
and its vessels, the altar of gold, and the vessels of ministry and of
the altar (Num. 4:6-14). Of the Lord's Divine mercy it will in that
place also be seen that these skins signify spiritual and natural good,
for whatever was in the ark, the tabernacle, or the tent, yea, whatever
was upon Aaron when clothed with the garments of holiness, signified
what is celestial spiritual, so that there was not the least thing that
had not its own representation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="297.">297.</span></span>

Celestial good is not clothed, because it is inmost, and is innocent;
but celestial spiritual good is that which is first clothed, and then
natural good, for these are more external, and on that account are
compared to and are called "garments;" as in Ezekiel, speaking of the
Ancient Church: I clothed thee with broidered work, and shod thee with
badger, I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered thee with
silk (Ezek. 16:10). In Isaiah: Put on thy beautiful garments, O
Jerusalem, the city of holiness (Isa. 52:1). In Revelation: Who have not
defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, for they
are worthy (Rev. 3:4-5), where it is likewise said of the four and
twenty elders that they were "clothed in white raiment" (4:4). Thus the
more external goods, which are celestial spiritual, and natural, are
"garments;" wherefore also those who are endowed with the goods of
charity appear in heaven clothed in shining garments; but here, because
still in the body, with a "coat of skin."

<span class="margnote"><span id="298.">298.</span></span>

Verse 22. And Jehovah God said, Behold the man is become as one of us,
knowing good and evil; and now lest he put forth his hand, and take also
of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to eternity. The reason "Jehovah
God" is first mentioned in the singular, and afterwards in the plural
number, is that by "Jehovah God" is meant the Lord, and at the same time
the angelic heaven. The man's "knowing good and evil" signifies that he
had become celestial, and thus wise and intelligent; "lest he put forth
his hand, and take also of the tree of lives" means that he must not be
instructed in the mysteries of faith, for then never to all eternity
could he be saved, which is to "live to eternity."

<span class="margnote"><span id="299.">299.</span></span>

Here are two arcana: first, that "Jehovah God" signifies the Lord, and
at the same time heaven; secondly, that had they been instructed in the
mysteries of faith they would have perished eternally.

<span class="margnote"><span id="300.">300.</span></span>

As regards the first arcanum-that by "Jehovah God" is meant the Lord and
at the same time heaven-it is to be observed that in the Word, always
for a secret reason, the Lord is sometimes called merely "Jehovah"
sometimes "Jehovah God" sometimes "Jehovah" and then "God" sometimes the
"Lord Jehovih" sometimes the "God of Israel" and sometimes "God" only.
Thus in the first chapter of Genesis, where it is also said, in the
plural, "Let us make man in our image" He is called "God" only, and He
is not called "Jehovah God" until the following chapter, where the
celestial man is treated of. He is called "Jehovah" because He alone is
or lives, thus from Essence; and "God" because He can do all things,
thus from Power; as is evident from the Word, where this distinction is
made (Isa. 49:4, 5; 55:7; Ps. 18:2, 28, 29, 31; 31:14). On this account
every angel or spirit who spoke with man, and who was supposed to
possess any power, was called "God" as appears from David: God hath
stood in the congregation of God, He will judge in the midst of the gods
(Ps. 82:1); and in another place: Who in the sky shall be compared unto
Jehovah? who among the sons of the gods shall be likened to Jehovah?
(Ps. 89:6). Again: Confess ye to the God of gods, confess ye to the Lord
of lords (Ps. 136:2-3). Men also as being possessed of power are called
"gods" as in Ps. 82:6; John 10:34, 35. Moses also is said to be "a god
to Pharaoh" (Exod. 7:1). For this reason the word "God" in the Hebrew is
in the plural number-"Elohim." But as the angels do not possess the
least power of themselves, as indeed they acknowledge, but solely from
the Lord, and as there is but one God, therefore by "Jehovah God" in the
Word is meant the Lord alone. But where anything is effected by the
ministry of angels, as in the first chapter of Genesis, He is spoken of
in the plural number. Here also because the celestial man, as man, could
not be put in comparison with the Lord, but with the angels only, it is
said, the man "is become as one of us, knowing good and evil" that is,
is wise and intelligent.
