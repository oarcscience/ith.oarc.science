### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="6651.">6651.</span></span>

And there arose a new king over Egypt. That this signifies separated
memory-knowledges which are opposed to the truths of the church, is
evident from the representation of Pharaoh, who is here the "king," as
being memory-knowledge in general (see n. 6015). He is called a "king,"
because a "king" in the genuine sense signifies truth (n. 1672, 2015,
2069, 3670, 4581, 4966, 5044, 6148), and in the opposite sense falsity;
and when by the "king" is meant Pharaoh, false memory-knowledge is
signified, that is, memory-knowledge which is opposed to the truths of
the church. From this also a "new king" is mentioned, for he who was
king in Joseph's time represented memory-knowledge that was in agreement
with the truths of the church. (That "Egypt" denotes memory-knowledge,
here in particular, see above, n. 6638.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6652.">6652.</span></span>

Who knew not Joseph. That this signifies which were completely alienated
from the internal, is evident from the signification of "not knowing,"
as being to be alienated; for he who does not know truth, and does not
desire to know it, is alienated from the truth of the church (that
alienation is here signified is plain from what follows, for he severely
and cruelly afflicted the sons of Israel, by whom is represented the
church, n. 6637); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the
internal (n. 6177, 6224). Memory-knowledges alienated from the internal
are memory-knowledges opposed to the church; for the good and truth
which make the church flow in through the internal; and if these are not
received by the natural, the internal is closed, and so the man is
alienated from good and truth, and then no other memory-knowledges which
are in the natural are acknowledged as truths than those which are
false. These are then multiplied, and the truths themselves are cast out
of doors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6653.">6653.</span></span>

And he said unto his people. That this signifies subordinate
memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "people," as
being truths, and in the opposite sense falsities (n. 1259, 1260, 3295,
3581), here memory-knowledges separated from truth, because it is the
people of Egypt. (That "Egypt" is memory-knowledge, see n. 6638.) That
they are subordinate memory-knowledges is because it is said that "the
king said unto his people." That by "people" are signified truths, is
because in the word those are called a "people" who are under a king,
and by a "king" is signified truth (n. 6651). By a "people" are
signified truths, but those are meant who are in truths. The reason why
truths are spoken of abstractedly, is that spirits and angels so think
and speak, for in this way they comprehend a subject in a universal
manner, and at the same time singly the particulars belonging to it,
without reflecting specifically on any people that is in truths, which
reflection would withdraw the mind from a universal idea, thus from
extension of view, consequently from wisdom. For determination of the
thought to any specific people, as also to any person, limits and
confines the ideas, and turns them from the perception of a subject as
it is from one boundary to the other. As is the case with the idea of a
"people," so is it with other denominations which in the internal sense
signify things unbounded - as with a "nation" as being good, with a
"king" as being truth, with a "prince" as being primary truth, with a
"priest" as being good, and with a "son," "daughter," "son-in-law,"
"daughter-in-law," "brother," "sister," "father," "mother," and many
other denominations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6654.">6654.</span></span>

Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are many and numerous more than
we. That this signifies that the truths of the church prevail over
alienated memory-knowledges, is evident from the representation of the
sons of Israel, as being the truths and goods of the church (see n.
6647); from the signification of "many" and "numerous," as being to
prevail (that "to be multiplied," or "to become many and numerous," is
said of truth, see also above, n. 6648); and from the representation of
the king of Egypt and his people, who are here meant by "more than we,"
as being alienated memory-knowledges (as above, n. 6652). Hence it is
plain that by "Behold the people of Israel are many and numerous more
than we" is signified that truths prevail over alienated
memory-knowledges.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6655.">6655.</span></span>

Come, let us use prudence with it. That this signifies cunning, is
evident from the signification of "prudence," when said of the evil, who
have been alienated from truth and good, as being cunning; for that
which the evil do from cunning, and also from deceit, they call
prudence. Of the cunning which is signified by "prudence," something may
here be related. All who are in evil call cunning "prudence," and make
intelligence and wisdom to consist in nothing else. They who are of this
character in the world become worse in the other life, and there act
continually from cunning against things good and true; and those are
recognized as intelligent and wise among them who seem to themselves
able to invalidate and destroy truths by falsities, no matter by what
art or wickedness. From this it can be seen what is the quality of men
within the church when they make prudence to consist in cunning: that
they have communication with the hells. Those who are true men of the
church are so far removed from cunning that they absolutely abhor it;
and those of them who are as the angels, desire that if it were possible
their minds should be open, so that what they think may be manifest to
everyone; for they intend nothing but good toward their neighbor, and if
they see evil in anyone they excuse it. It is otherwise with those who
are in evil; these are afraid lest anything which they think and will
should show itself; for they intend nothing but evil to the neighbor; if
good, it is for the sake of self; and if they do what is good, it is
only in the outward form, that they may appear good for the sake of gain
and honor; for they know that what is good and true, just and fair, and
also what is honorable, have a strong hidden power of attracting minds,
even of those who are evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6656.">6656.</span></span>

Peradventure it will be multiplied, and it will be that wars will
happen. That this signifies prevalence if it grows, is evident from the
signification of "being multiplied," as being to grow as to truths (see
n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847); and from the signification of "wars,"
as being combats concerning truths and falsities, that is, spiritual
combats (n. 1664, 2686); and because it follows that "it will also join
itself to our enemies," their prevalence in these combats is signified.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6657.">6657.</span></span>

And it will also join itself to our enemies, and fight against us. That
this signifies that so their companions who would occasion evil would be
strengthened, is evident from the signification of "joining themselves
to," as being to be strengthened, for armies are strengthened when a
multitude is joined to them; from the signification of "enemies," as
being companions who fight along with them; and from the signification
of "fighting against us," as being to occasion evil, for when anyone is
fought against, evil is occasioned him insofar as it cannot be resisted.
The case herein is this. There is around every man, and also around
every good spirit, a general sphere of endeavors from hell, and a
general sphere of endeavors from heaven. The sphere from hell is one of
endeavors to do evil and to destroy; and the sphere from heaven is one
of endeavors to do good and to save (see n. 6477). These are general
spheres: in like manner there are particular spheres around each man,
for spirits from hell are with him, and also angels from heaven (n.
5846-5866, 5976-5993). From this a man is in equilibrium, and has
freedom to think and will evil, and freedom to think and will good.
\[2\] When therefore the man of the church comes into temptation, which
takes place when he is let into his evil, there is then a combat around
him between the spirits from hell and the angels from heaven (n. 3927,
4249, 5036), which combat lasts so long as the man is kept in his evil.
In this combat it sometimes appears to the spirits from hell that they
will conquer, and then they rise up; sometimes that they will be
conquered, and then they withdraw, because they then fear that more
angels from heaven will join themselves against them, and so that they
will be cast down into hell, from which they will no more come out,
which also takes place when they have been conquered. This is what is
meant by the "prevalence if it grows, and that their companions who
would occasion evil would be strengthened." \[3\] When the spirits from
hell fight against the angels, they are in the world of spirits, and are
in freedom there (n. 5852). From all this it can now be seen what is
meant in the internal sense by the sons of Israel being so infested and
oppressed by the Egyptians, and by their being multiplied the more, the
more they were infested; and by Jehovah, that is, the Lord, fighting for
them, and restraining the Egyptians by plagues, and at last submerging
them all in the sea Suph.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6658.">6658.</span></span>

And go up out of the land. That this signifies that thus the church will
be set up anew, is evident from the signification of "going up," as
being to be elevated, namely, toward more interior things of the church
(see n. 3084, 4539, 4969, 5406, 5817, 6007), and from the signification
of "land," here the land of Goshen, as being the church (of which above,
n. 6649). To be elevated toward more interior things, which is signified
by "going up out of the land and coming into the land of Canaan,"
denotes that the church will be set up anew. The church has indeed been
set up anew with a man when he does what is good from affection; but
still it has not been fully set up anew until he has fought against
evils and falsities, thus until he has endured temptations; after this
he becomes truly a church, and then is introduced into heaven, which is
represented by the introduction of the sons of Israel into the land of
Canaan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6659.">6659.</span></span>

And they set over it princes of tributes. That this signifies falsities
that would compel to serve, is evident from the signification of
"princes," as being primary truths (see n. 1482, 2089, 5044); here in
the opposite sense primary falsities; and from the signification of
"tributes," to which they were driven by the princes set over them, as
being servitudes (see n. 6394).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6660.">6660.</span></span>

To afflict it with burdens. That this signifies a growing worse through
servitudes, is evident from the signification of "afflicting," as being
a growing worse; and from the signification of "burdens," which were
tributes, as being servitudes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6661.">6661.</span></span>

And it built cities of store-houses for Pharaoh. That this signifies
doctrines from falsified truths in the natural where alienated
memory-knowledges are, is evident from the signification of "cities," as
being doctrines in both senses (see n. 402, 2449, 2943, 3216, 4492,
4493); from the signification of "storehouses" as being falsified truths
(of which presently), and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being
the natural (n. 5160, 5799, 6015); that alienated memory-knowledges are
there, may be seen above (n. 6651, 6652). That the cities of storehouses
which the people of Israel built for Pharaoh denote doctrines from
falsified truths, is because they who are in memory-knowledges alienated
from truth, who are here signified by Pharaoh and the Egyptians, pervert
and falsify all the truths of the church, and make for themselves
doctrines from the truths so perverted and falsified. \[2\] The word by
which in the original tongue "store-houses" are expressed, signifies
also "arsenals," and likewise "treasuries," which, in the internal
sense, are of a nearly like signification. For storehouses are places
where produce is collected, and by "produce" is signified truth (n.
5276, 5280, 5292, 5402), and, in the opposite sense, falsity; and
arsenals are places where arms of war are stored, by which are signified
such things as pertain to truth fighting against falsities, and in the
opposite sense to falsity fighting against truths (n. 1788, 2685).
Treasuries are places where wealth is stored, and by "wealth" and
"riches" are signified the knowledges of good and truth (see n. 4508),
in the opposite sense the knowledges of evil and falsity; thus by
"cities of storehouses" or "of arsenals" or "of treasuries" are
signified, in general, doctrines from falsified truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6662.">6662.</span></span>

Pithom and Raamses. That this signifies their quality, namely, of
doctrines from falsified truths, is evident from names in the Word, as
being the quality and state of the thing being treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6663.">6663.</span></span>

And as they afflicted it, so it was multiplied. That this signifies that
truths grew according to the infestations, is evident from the
signification of "afflicting," as being infestation; and from the
signification of "being multiplied," as being to grow in respect to
truths (of which above, n. 6656). How the case herein is shall be told,
because without experience of what is done in the other life, no one can
now know what it is. Most spirits who come from the world and have lived
the life of the Lord's commandments, before they can be uplifted into
heaven and joined to societies there, are infested by the evils and
falsities pertaining to them, to the end that they may be removed (see
n. 6639); for there are impurities which they have contracted in the
life of the body that in no wise agree with heaven. The infestations
take place by their being immersed in their evils and falsities; and
while they are in them, spirits who are in like evils and falsities are
present, and labor by every means to lead them away from truth and good.
But still they are not immersed so deeply in their evils and falsities
that the influx through the angels from the Lord may not prevail; and
the balance is maintained with exactness. The purpose of this is, that
he who is infested may seem to himself to be in freedom, and thus to
fight against the evils and falsities of himself, yet with the
acknowledgment, if not at the time, yet afterward, that all the power of
resisting was from the Lord (n. 1937, 1947, 2881, 5660). When this is
being done, not only are the truths and goods strengthened which had
been implanted before, but more are instilled; this being the result of
every spiritual combat in which the combatant is victorious. That it is
so is also plain from common experience; for he who defends his opinion
against others who attack it, confirms himself the more in his opinion,
and then also finds other confirmations of it which he had not before
observed, and also others which deny the opposite; and in this way he
strengthens himself in his opinion, and also illustrates it with further
considerations. This is still more perfectly the case with spiritual
combats, because the combat takes place in the spirit, and concerns
goods and truths; and especially because the Lord is present and leads
by the angels; for the contest is concerning eternal life and salvation.
It is common in such combats for the Lord to turn into good all the
evils which the hells intend; wherefore it is not permitted them to
bring forth more or other evils than can be turned into good that is
suited to him who is in combat. The reason of this originates in the
fact that the Lord's kingdom is a kingdom of uses, and therefore nothing
can be done there that is not a source of good. From all this it can now
be seen how it is to be understood that truths grow according to
infestations, which is signified by "as they afflicted it, so it was
multiplied."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6664.">6664.</span></span>

And so it was increased. That this signifies that they, namely, truths,
were strengthened, is evident from the signification of "increasing,"
when said of truths multiplied by means of infestations from evils and
falsities, as being to be strengthened; for no other truths remain than
those which are strengthened; wherefore as many as are the truths
strengthened, by so many are they increased. (That truths are
strengthened by infestations, see just above, n. 6663.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6665.">6665.</span></span>

And they were moved with loathing because of the sons of Israel. That
this signifies greater aversion, is evident from the signification of
"being moved with loathing," as being aversion, here greater aversion,
because they were still more multiplied and increased by afflictions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6666.">6666.</span></span>

And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve. That this signifies
an intention to subjugate, is evident from the signification of "making
to serve," as being subjugation, here the intention to subjugate,
because they are in the continual endeavor to subjugate, but in no wise
prevail against the good; from the signification of the "Egyptians," as
being separated memory-knowledges which are opposed to the truths of the
church (see n. 6651); and from the signification of the "sons of
Israel," as being the church (n. 6637). Hence it is evident that by "the
Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve" is signified the intention
to subjugate by those who are in separated memory-knowledges which are
opposed to the truths of the church. \[2\] As regards the intention to
subjugate, such as exists with the evil who are from hell, I have also
been given to know this. Such is their endeavor and intention to
subjugate those who are in good and truth that it cannot be described;
for they make use of all malice, all cunning and fraud, all deceit, and
all cruelty, so great and of such a nature that if these were told in
part only, hardly anyone in the world could believe it; so cunning and
artful are their devices, and so execrable. In a word, these infernals
are of such a nature that they cannot possibly be resisted by any man,
nor even by any angel, but by the Lord alone. The reason why they are
possessed with such an endeavor and intention is that all their delight
of life, thus their life itself, consists in doing evil; and therefore
nothing else occupies their thoughts, consequently they intend nothing
else. They are quite unable to do what is good, because this is
repugnant to them: if they do what is good, it is for the sake of self,
thus is done to self. \[3\] From such spirits the hells are at this day
immensely increased, and wonderful to say, especially from those who are
within the church, on account of the cunning, deceit, hatred, revenge,
and adultery, which flourish there more than elsewhere; for within the
church cunning is now esteemed ingenious, and adultery honorable, and
they who deem otherwise are laughed at. Its being so within the church
at this day is a sign that its last time is at hand, for "Except there
be an end, no flesh would be saved," according to the Lord's words in
Matt. 24:22; because all evil is contagious, and infects, as lees do the
lump, thus at last all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6667.">6667.</span></span>

With cruelty. That this signifies unmercifulness can be seen without
explication; for they who have just been treated of have no mercy,
because they have no love of the neighbor, but only the love of self.
The love of the neighbor which appears with them is nothing but the love
of self; for insofar as another favors them, that is, so far as he is
theirs, so far he is loved; but insofar as he does not favor them, or
insofar as he is not theirs, so far he is rejected; and if he had
previously been a friend, so far he is hated. Such things lie hidden in
the love of self, nor do they show themselves in the world, but in the
other life, where they burst forth. The reason why they there burst
forth is that externals are there taken away, and then it appears what
the man has been inwardly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6668.">6668.</span></span>

And they rendered their life bitter with grievous service. That this
signifies until the intention to subjugate became troublesome, is
evident from the signification of "the life being rendered bitter," as
being to become troublesome; and from the signification of "servitude,"
as being subjugation, here the intention to subjugate (as above, n.
6666).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6669.">6669.</span></span>

In clay, and in bricks. That this signifies by reason of the evils which
they contrived, and the falsities which they devised, is evident from
the signification of "clay," as being good, and in the opposite sense
evil (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "bricks,"
as being the falsities which they devise (see n. 1296; concerning the
evils and falsities which the infernals contrive and devise, see just
above, n. 6666). That "clay" denotes evil from which is falsity, is
plain from the following passages in the Word: The wicked are like the
driven sea, when it cannot rest; its waters cast up mire and clay (Isa.
57:20); "mire" denotes falsity from which is evil; and "clay," evil from
which is falsity. \[2\] In Jeremiah: Thy feet are sunk in the clay, they
have gone backward (Jer. 38:22); "the feet sunk in the clay" denotes the
natural sunk in evil. Draw thee waters for the siege, strengthen thy
fortresses; enter into the mire, and tread the clay, repair the
brick-kiln; there shall the fire devour thee, and the sword shall cut
thee off (Nah. 3:14-15); "to tread the clay" denotes to think from evil
what is false. He shall say, Woe to him that multiplieth what is not
his! How long? And to him that ladeth himself with clay! Shall they not
rise up suddenly that bite thee? (Hab. 2:6-7); "to lade himself with
clay" denotes with evil. \[3\] In David: Jehovah hath made me to come
out of the pit of devastation, out of the mire of clay, and He hath set
my feet upon a rock (Ps. 40:2). I sank in deep clay where there is no
standing. I am come into depths of waters, and the wave overwhelmed me;
rescue me out of the clay, lest I be submerged, and out of the depths of
waters; and let not the deep swallow me up (Ps. 69:2, 14-15); "clay"
denotes evil, from which is falsity. In Isaiah: The rulers shall come as
clay, and as the potter treadeth the mire (Isa. 41:25). \[4\] "Clay,"
however, denotes good in the following passages: Now, Jehovah, Thou art
our Father; we are the clay, and Thou our potter; and we all are the
work of Thy hand (Isa. 64:8); "clay" denotes the man of the church who
is being formed, thus the good of faith by means of which man is formed,
that is, reformed. \[5\] So in Jeremiah: Jehovah said to Jeremiah,
Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will make thee to
hear My words. I went down therefore into the potter's house, and behold
he wrought his work upon the board; but the vessel he was making was
spoiled, as clay in the hand of the potter; and he turned back and made
it another vessel, as was right in the hand of the potter to make it.
Then was the word of Jehovah effected unto me, saying, Cannot I do with
you, O house of Israel, as this potter? saith Jehovah. Behold, as the
clay in the hand of the potter, so are ye in My hand, O house of Israel
(Jer. 18:1-6); the "house of Israel" denotes the church which was to be
formed; and as the formation is done by means of the good of charity and
the truth of faith, and these are signified by "clay" and the "potter's
vessel," therefore the prophet was ordered to go into the potter's
house, which would not have been done unless these things had been
signified by "clay" and the "potter's vessel." \[6\] Jehovah, or the
Lord, is called a "potter," and the man who is being reformed is called
"clay," namely, in Isa. 29:15, 16; 45:9; Job 10:9; 33:6. That the Lord
made clay with spittle, and anointed the eyes of the man born blind, and
commanded him to wash in the pool of Siloam, and that thereupon he that
was blind was made to see (John 9:6, 7, 11), was done because there was
represented the reformation of a man who has been born in ignorance of
truth, and that reformation is made through the good of faith, which is
the "clay."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6670.">6670.</span></span>

And in all service in the field. That this signifies the intention to
subjugate directed against the things of the church, is evident from the
signification of "service," as being the intention to subjugate (see n.
6666); and from the signification of "field," as being the church (n.
2971, 3766).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6671.">6671.</span></span>

With all their service wherein they made them to serve with cruelty.
That this signifies the intention to subjugate in many ways by reason of
unmercifulness, is evident from the signification of "service," as being
the intention to subjugate (see n. 6666, 6668, 6670), and because it is
said "all service," there is signified that it is done in many ways; and
from the signification of "cruelty," as being unmercifulness (n. 6667).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6672.">6672.</span></span>

Verses 15-21. And the king of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrew
women, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the
other Puah; and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the
Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye
shall kill him; and if it be a daughter, then she shall live. And the
midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt spoke to them, and
they kept the boys alive. And the king of Egypt called the midwives, and
said to them, Wherefore do ye this word, and keep the boys alive? And
the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the
Egyptian women; for they are living, and they have brought forth before
the midwife comes unto them. And God did well to the midwives; and the
people was multiplied and became very numerous. And it came to pass,
because the midwives feared God, that He made them houses. "And the king
of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrew women," signifies influx
from the separated memory-knowledges into the natural, where the true
memory-knowledges of the church are; "of whom the name of the one was
Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah," signifies the quality and
state of the natural where memory-knowledges are; "and he said, When ye
do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the
stools," signifies a discernment of the truth and good flowing in from
the internal into memory-knowledges; "if it be a son, then ye shall kill
him," signifies if it is truth, that they should destroy it in any way
they could; "and if it be a daughter, then she shall live," signifies
that they should not do so if it is good; "and the midwives feared God,"
signifies that true memory-knowledges were guarded because by the
Divine; "and did not as the king of Egypt spoke to them," signifies that
it was not done as they who were in falsities intended; "and they kept
the boys alive," signifies that truths being of good were preserved;
"and the king of Egypt called the midwives," signifies that they who
were in falsities conspired against those who were in true
memory-knowledges in the natural; "and said unto them, Wherefore do ye
this word, and keep the boys alive?" signifies anger because truths were
not destroyed; "and the midwives said unto Pharaoh," signifies a
discernment of these true memory-knowledges in the natural; "Because the
Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women," signifies that the
memory-knowledges of the church are not like the memory-knowledges
opposed to them; "for they are living," signifies that spiritual life is
in them; "and they have brought forth before the midwife comes unto
them," signifies that the natural has no knowledge before they have
life; "and God did well to the midwives," signifies that the natural was
blessed by the Divine; "and the people was multiplied and became very
numerous," signifies that truths therein were brought forth continually,
and so increased; "and it came to pass, because the midwives feared
God," signifies because true memory-knowledges were guarded by the
Divine; "that He made them houses," signifies that they were disposed
into the heavenly form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6673.">6673.</span></span>

And the king of Egypt said to the midwives of the Hebrew women. That
this signifies influx from the separated memory-knowledges into the
natural where the true memory-knowledges of the church are, is evident
from the signification of "saying," as being influx (see n. 5743, 6291);
from the signification of the "king of Egypt," as being separated
memory-knowledges which are opposed to the truths of the church (n.
6651); from the signification of "midwives," as being the natural (n.
4588, 4921); and from the signification of the "Hebrews," as being the
things of the church (n. 5136, 5236); thus also true memory-knowledges
which are of the church. That "midwives" denote the natural, is because
the natural receives that which flows in from the internal, and thus as
it were acts as a midwife.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6674.">6674.</span></span>

Of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other
Puah. That this signifies the quality and state of the natural where
memory-knowledges are, is evident from the signification of "name," as
being quality (see n. 144, 145, 1896, 2009), and also state (n. 1946,
2643, 3422, 4298); for all names in the Word signify things, and
comprise in sum total all things that belong to the subject that is
being treated of, thus its quality and state; here therefore the names
"Shiphrah and Puah" signify the quality and state of the natural where
true memory-knowledges are, because this is the subject treated of, as
is plain from what precedes (n. 6673). \[2\] He who does not know that a
name denotes the quality and state of the subject being treated of, can
believe that where a name is mentioned, the name merely is meant; thus
when the Lord speaks of His "name," that it is merely the name, when yet
it is the quality of the worship, that is, everything of faith and
charity by which He is to be worshiped, as in these passages: Where two
or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of
them (Matt. 18:20); here the "name" is not meant, but worship from faith
and charity. As many as received, to them gave He power to be the sons
of God, to them that believe in His name (John 1:12); here also by
"name" is meant faith and charity, whereby the Lord is worshiped. These
things have been written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ,
the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in His name (John
20:31); where the sense is the same. \[3\] Again: If ye shall ask
anything in My name, I will do it (John 14:13-14); Whatsoever ye shall
ask the Father in My name, He will give it you (John 15:16; 16:23-24).
Here it is not meant that they should ask the Father in the Lord's name,
but that they should ask the Lord Himself; for there is no way open to
the Divine Good which is the "Father" (see n. 3704), except through the
Lord's Divine Human, as is also known in the churches; and therefore to
ask the Lord Himself is to ask according to the truths of faith, and
whatever is asked in accordance with these truths is granted, as the
Lord Himself says in the previous passage from John: If ye shall ask
anything in My name, I will do it (John 14:14). This can be seen further
from the fact that the Lord is the "name" of Jehovah, of which thus in
Moses: I send an angel before thee, to keep thee in the way; beware of
His faces, and hear His voice, and do not provoke Him, because My name
is in the midst of Him (Exod. 23:20-21). \[4\] In John: Father, glorify
Thy name: there came forth a voice from heaven, saying, I have both
glorified it, and I will glorify it again (John 12:28). I have
manifested Thy name to the men whom thou hast given Me out of the world.
I have made known unto them Thy name, and I will make it known; that the
love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them (John
17:6, 26). From these passages it is plain that the Lord as to the
Divine Human is the "name" of Jehovah, or His whole quality; hence all
Divine worship is from the Divine Human, and it is this which is to be
worshiped; for thus is worshiped the Divine Itself, to which no thought
reaches in any other way, and if no thought, no conjunction. \[5\] That
the "name" of the Lord is everything of faith and love by which the Lord
is to be worshiped is still more plain from the following passages: Ye
shall be hated of all for My name's sake (Matt. 10:22). Whoso shall
receive one such little child in My name receiveth me (Matt. 18:5).
Everyone that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or
mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for My name's sake; shall
receive a hundredfold (Matt. 19:29). They cried, Hosanna to the Son of
David; blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord (Matt. 21:9).
Verily I say to you, For ye shall not see Me until the time shall come
when ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord
(Luke 13:35). Whosoever shall give you to drink a cup of water in My
name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not
lose his reward (Mark 9:41). The seventy returned with joy, saying,
Lord, even the demons obey us in Thy name. Jesus said to them, In this
rejoice not, that the spirits obey you, but rather rejoice that your
names have been written in heaven (Luke 10:17, 20); "names written in
heaven" are not names, but the quality of their faith and charity. \[6\]
So it is with "names written in the book of life" in the following
passages: Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled
their garments. He that overcometh shall be clothed in white garments,
and I will not blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess
his name before the Father and before His angels (Rev. 3:4-5). He that
entereth in by the door is the Shepherd of the sheep. He calleth His own
sheep by name (John 10:2-3). Jehovah said unto Moses, I know thee by
name (Exod. 33:12, 17). Many believed in His name, when they saw His
signs which He did (John 2:23). He that believeth in Him is not judged,
but he that believeth not is judged already, because he hath not
believed in the name of the Only-begotten Son of God (John 3:18). They
shall fear the name of Jehovah from the west (Isa. 59:19). All people
walk everyone in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of
Jehovah our God (Micah 4:5). \[7\] In Moses: They were to worship
Jehovah God in the place which He should choose, and should put His name
(Deut. 21:5, 11, 14). Also in Isa. 18:7; Jer. 7:12; and in many other
passages; as Isa. 26:8, 13; 41:25; 43:7; 49:1; 50:10; 52:5; 62:2; Jer.
23:27; 26:16; Ezek. 20:14, 44; 36:21-23; Micah 5:4; Mal. 1:11; Deut.
10:8; Rev. 2:17; 3:12; 13:8; 14:11; 15:2; 17:8; 19:12, 13, 16; 22:3-4.
\[8\] That the "name of Jehovah" denotes everything by which He is
worshiped, thus in the supreme sense everything that proceeds from the
Lord, is evident from the benediction: Jehovah bless thee and keep thee,
Jehovah make His faces to shine upon thee, and have mercy on thee;
Jehovah lift up His faces upon thee, and give thee peace. So shall they
put My name upon the sons of Israel (Num. 6:23-27). From all this it is
now clear what is meant by this commandment of the Decalogue: Thou shalt
not take the name of thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him
innocent that taketh His name in vain (Exod. 20:7); also by Hallowed be
Thy name, in the Lord's prayer (Matt. 6:9).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6675.">6675.</span></span>

And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and
see them upon the stools. That this signifies a discernment of the truth
and good flowing in from the internal into the memory-knowledges of the
church, is evident from the signification of "doing the office of a
midwife," as being reception of the good and truth flowing in from the
internal into the natural, for the natural is a "midwife" insofar as it
receives the influx (see n. 4588, 6673); from the signification of "the
Hebrew women," as being things of the church (n. 5136, 5236); from the
signification of "seeing," as being to discern (n. 2150, 3764, 4567,
4723, 5400); and from the signification of "stools," as being those
things in the natural which receive the goods and truths flowing in from
the internal, thus true memory-knowledges, for these receive. Hence it
is evident that by "When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
women and see them upon the stools," is signified a discernment of the
truth and good flowing in from the internal into the memory-knowledges
of the church which are in the natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6676.">6676.</span></span>

If it be a son, then ye shall kill him. That this signifies, if it is
truth, that they should destroy it in any way they could, is evident
from the signification of "son," as being truth (see n. 489, 491, 533,
1147, 2623, 3373); and from the signification of "killing," as being to
destroy, for it is said of truth. But they were to destroy "in any way
they could," for the evil are not able to destroy truths with the good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6677.">6677.</span></span>

And if it be a daughter, then she shall live. That this signifies that
they should not do so if it is good, is evident from the signification
of "daughter," as being good (see n. 489-491, 2362); and from the
signification of "living," as being not to be destroyed. The reason why
the king of Egypt said that a son should be slain, but not a daughter,
is plain from the internal sense, which is that they would attempt to
destroy truth, but not good; for when the infernals infest, they are
allowed to attack truths, but not goods. The reason is that truths are
what can be assaulted, but not goods, these being protected by the Lord;
and when the infernals attempt to attack goods, they are cast down deep
into hell, for they cannot withstand the presence of good, because in
all good the Lord is present. Hence it is that the angels, being in
good, have such power over infernal spirits that one angel can master
thousands of them. Be it known that there is life in good, for good is
of love, and love is the life of man. If evil, which is of the love of
self and of the world, and which appears good to those who are in these
loves, assaults the good which is of heavenly love, the life of the one
fights against the life of the other; and as the life from the good of
heavenly love is from the Divine, therefore if the life from the love of
self and of the world comes into collision with the former life, it
begins to be extinguished, for it is suffocated. Thus they are tortured
like those who are in the death agony, and therefore they cast
themselves headlong into hell, where they again recover their life (n.
3938, 4225, 4226, 5057, 5058). This also is the reason why good cannot
be assaulted by evil genii and spirits; and thus that they dare not
destroy good. It is otherwise with truth, which has not life in itself;
but from good, that is, through good from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6678.">6678.</span></span>

And the midwives feared God. That this signifies that true
memory-knowledges were guarded because by the Divine, is evident from
the signification of "fearing God," as being to guard what the Divine
has commanded (for they who fear God guard or keep the commandments, but
as all holy fear, and hence obedience and the guarding of the
commandments, are from the Divine, and not at all from man, therefore by
"they feared God" is signified that they were guarded by the Divine);
and from the signification of midwives," as being the natural where true
memory-knowledges are (n. 4588, 6673, 6675).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6679.">6679.</span></span>

And did not as the king of Egypt spoke to them. That this signifies that
it was not done as those who were in falsities intended, is evident from
the signification of "they did not do as he spoke," as being that it was
not done as they intended, namely, that those who were in falsities were
not able to destroy the truths which are signified by "sons," but that
they intended to destroy them in every way they could (see n. 6676); and
from the signification of "the king of Egypt," as being separated
memory-knowledge which is opposed to the truth of the church (see n.
6651), thus falsity, for this memory-knowledge is falsity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6680.">6680.</span></span>

And they kept the boys alive. That this signifies that truths, being of
good, were preserved, is evident from the signification of "keeping
alive," as being to preserve; and from the signification of "sons," here
called "boys," as being truths (see n. 6676). Sons are here called
"boys" because by "boys" is signified the good of innocence (n. 430,
2782, 5236); and therefore "boys" here denote truths which are of good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6681.">6681.</span></span>

And the king of Egypt called the midwives. That this signifies that they
who were in falsities conspired against those who were in true
memory-knowledges in the natural, is evident from the signification of
"calling," as here being to conspire, for the reason of the call was to
destroy truths, but the plot was made futile because the truths were
guarded by the Divine, which is signified by the "midwives fearing God"
(n. 6678), (moreover, the evil in the other life, who infest the good,
really conspire together, as I have been given to know from experience);
from the signification of "the king of Egypt," as being those who are in
falsities (of which just above, n. 6679); and from the signification of
"midwives," as being the natural wherein are true memory-knowledges (n.
4588, 6673, 6675, 6678). Hence it is evident that by "the king of Egypt
called the midwives" is signified that they who were in falsities
conspired against those who were in true memory-knowledges in the
natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6682.">6682.</span></span>

And said unto them, Wherefore do ye this word, and keep the boys alive?
That this signifies anger because truths were not destroyed, is evident
from the signification of "Wherefore do ye this word?" as being words of
chiding, thus of anger; from the signification of "keeping alive," as
being not to destroy (see n. 6677, 6680); and from the signification of
"boys," as being truths which are of good (n. 6680).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6683.">6683.</span></span>

And the midwives said unto Pharaoh. That this signifies a discernment of
these true memory-knowledges in the natural, is evident from the
signification of saying," in the historic parts of the Word, as being a
noticing or perception, of which often above; from the signification of
"midwives," as being true memory-knowledges in the natural (n. 6681);
and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being false memory-knowledges
in general (see n. 6679, 6681).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6684.">6684.</span></span>

Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women. That this
signifies that the memory-knowledges of the church are not like the
memory-knowledges opposed to them, is evident from the signification of
"the Hebrew women," as being things of the church (see n. 5136, 5236,
6673, 6675); and from the signification of "the Egyptian women," as
being such things as are opposed to the things of the church, which are
memory-knowledges, as is plain from what goes before; also from the
signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (n. 6638), here
memory-knowledges opposed to the true memory-knowledges of the church.
(That "women" denote things of the church, see n. 252, 253.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6685.">6685.</span></span>

For they are living. That this signifies that spiritual life is in them,
is evident from the signification of "living," as being spiritual life
(see n. 5890), here spiritual life in the things of the church, which
are signified by "Hebrew women." What spiritual life is, has been
repeatedly told above, but because few at this day know what the
spiritual is, it may here be briefly explained further. The spiritual in
its first origin is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine
Human; which truth has in it Divine good, because the Divine truth comes
forth from the Lord's Divine Human, which is Divine good. The Divine
truth, in which is Divine good, is the spiritual itself in its origin,
and is the life itself which fills heaven, nay, which fills the
universe; and where there is a subject, there it flows in. But in its
subjects it is varied according to their form. In the subjects which
agree with good, it presents spiritual life; but in the subjects which
disagree with good, it presents life opposed to spiritual life, which in
the Word is called "death." From this it is now plain what spiritual
life is, namely, that it is to be in truths from good, which proceed
from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6686.">6686.</span></span>

And they have brought forth before the midwife comes unto them. That
this signifies that the natural has no knowledge before they have life,
that is, the true memory-knowledges which are of the church, is evident
from the signification of "midwife," as being the natural in which are
the true memory-knowledges of the church (see n. 6681); and from the
signification of "bringing forth," as being what is of faith and charity
(n. 3860, 3868, 3905, 3915); thus what is of spiritual life. That the
natural has no knowledge, is signified by "before the midwife comes unto
them." In regard to the natural having no knowledge before the true
memory-knowledges have life, the case is this. The true
memory-knowledges in the natural have all their life from the good which
flows in through the internal; when good flows in, the natural knows
nothing of it, because the natural is relatively in obscurity. That it
is in obscurity is because it is in the light of the world, and hence at
the same time in worldly things, into which there comes obscure
perception when the light of heaven flows in; and also because in the
natural there are general things which are not capable of perceiving
singulars, for the more general anything is, the less it perceives
singulars, and hence the less it perceives the happenings that come
forth in itself; and moreover in the natural there are not goods and
truths themselves, but their representatives. Hence then it is that the
natural does not know when true memory-knowledges have life,
consequently when or how regeneration goes on, according to the Lord's
words in John: The wind bloweth where it willeth, and thou hearest the
voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth;
so it is with everyone that is born again of the spirit (John 3:8). By
"the natural" is meant the external man, which is also called "the
natural man."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6687.">6687.</span></span>

And God did well to the midwives. That this signifies that the natural
was blessed by the Divine, is evident from the signification of "doing
well," when said of God, as being to bless; and from the signification
of "midwives," as being the natural where true memory-knowledges are
(see n. 4588, 6673, 6675, 6678).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6688.">6688.</span></span>

And the people was multiplied, and became very numerous. That this
signifies that truths were brought forth therein continually, and thus
increased, is evident from what was said above (see n. 6648), where are
like words. (That "people" is predicated of truths, see n. 1259, 1260,
3295, 3581.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6689.">6689.</span></span>

And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God. That this
signifies because true memory-knowledges were guarded by the Divine, is
evident from what was said above (n. 6678), where like words occur.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6690.">6690.</span></span>

That He made them houses. That this signifies that they, namely, the
true memory-knowledges in the natural, were disposed into the heavenly
form, is evident from the signification of "house," as being the natural
mind (n. 4973, 5023), thus the things of this mind, which here, because
midwives are spoken of, are true memory-knowledges in the natural (n.
6687); therefore "to make houses for them" denotes to dispose them into
order, and they are disposed into order when they are disposed into the
heavenly form. That such is the signification of "making them houses"
cannot easily be known, unless it is known how the case is with the true
memory-knowledges of the natural mind; wherefore this shall be briefly
told. The memory-knowledges in the natural have been disposed into
continuous series; one series coheres with another, and in this way they
all cohere together according to various affinities and propinquities;
and are circumstanced not unlike families and their generations, for one
is born from another, and so they become productive. Hence the things of
the mind, which are goods and truths, were by the ancients called
"houses," the good reigning therein being named "father," and the truth
joined to this good, "mother," and the derivations "sons," "daughters,"
"sons-in-law," "daughters-in-law," and so forth. But the disposition of
true memory-knowledges in the natural varies with every man; for the
ruling love induces a form on them, this love being in the midst, and
setting in order everything around it. Those things which most agree
with it, it sets next to itself, and everything else in order in
accordance with their agreement. From this the memory-knowledges have
their form. If heavenly love rules, then all things are disposed there
by the Lord into the heavenly form, which form is like that of heaven,
thus is the form of the good of love itself. Into this form truths are
disposed, which, when so disposed, make one with good; and then when the
one is called forth by the Lord, the other is called forth; that is to
say, when the things of faith are called forth, so are those of charity,
and the converse. Such is the disposition that is signified by "God made
houses for the midwives."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6691.">6691.</span></span>

Verse 22. And Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, Every son that
is born, ye shall cast him forth into the river, and every daughter ye
shall keep alive. "And Pharaoh commanded all his people," signifies
general influx into the memory-knowledges opposed to the truths of the
church; "saying, Every son that is born, ye shall cast him forth into
the river," signifies that they should immerse in falsities all truths
which appear; "and every daughter ye shall keep alive," signifies that
they should not assault good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6692.">6692.</span></span>

And Pharaoh commanded all his people. That this signifies general influx
into the memory-knowledges opposed to the truths of the church, is
evident from the signification of "commanding," as being influx (see n.
5486, 5732) here general influx, because done by Pharaoh, by whom is
represented memory-knowledge in general (see n. 6015); and from the
signification of "his people," as being memory-knowledges opposed to the
truths of the church. (That the Egyptians, who here are the "people,"
denote memory-knowledges, has been often shown above, see n. 6838.) That
by the "Egyptians" are signified memory-knowledges opposed to the truths
of the church, is because the representatives and significatives of the
Ancient Church, which church had also been with them, were there turned
into things magical; for by the representatives and significatives of
the church of that time there was communication with heaven. This
communication was with those who lived in the good of charity, and was
open with many; whereas with those who did not live in the good of
charity, but in its opposites, open communication was sometimes granted
with evil spirits, who had perverted all the truths of the church, and
together with these had destroyed its goods, whence came things magical.
This can also be seen from the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians, which
also were made use of in sacred things, for by them they signified
spiritual things, and perverted Divine order. \[2\] Magic is nothing but
the perversion of order, and is especially the abuse of correspondences.
It is order that the goods and truths which proceed from the Lord should
be received by man. When this is done, there is order in everything the
man intends and thinks. But when a man does not receive goods and truths
according to the order which is from the Lord, but believes that all
things are blind flowings, and that if there comes forth anything that
has been determined, it is of his own prudence, he perverts order; for
he applies to himself the things of order with a view to taking care
only of himself, and not of his neighbor, except insofar as his neighbor
favors him. Hence, wonderful to say, all who have firmly impressed on
themselves that all things are of their own prudence, and nothing of the
Divine providence, are in the other life very prone to magic, and
insofar as they can, they imbue it, especially those who in consequence
of trusting to themselves, and ascribing everything to their own
prudence, have contrived various arts and craftinesses to raise
themselves above others. When such men are judged in the other life,
they are cast down toward the hells of the magicians, which are in the
plane beneath the soles of the feet to the right, a little toward the
front, extending to a great distance; in the lowest depths of which are
the Egyptians. Hence then it is that by "Pharaoh," the "Egyptians," and
"Egypt," are signified memory-knowledges opposed to the truths of the
church. \[3\] Lest therefore the representatives and significatives of
the church should be further turned into magic, the Israelitish people
was taken, with whom the representatives and significatives of the
church might be restored; which people was of such a nature that it
could not make anything magical therefrom, because it was altogether in
externals, and had no belief in anything internal, still less in
anything spiritual. With people of such a character, such magic as
existed with the Egyptians cannot arise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6693.">6693.</span></span>

Saying, Every son that is born, ye shall cast him forth into the river.
That this signifies that they should immerse in falsities all truths
which appear, is evident from the signification of "son," as being truth
(see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373); and from the signification of
"river," as being things that belong to intelligence (n. 108, 109, 2702,
3051), here in the opposite sense, things contrary, thus falsities. That
"to cast forth" denotes to immerse is manifest. \[2\] That the "river of
Egypt" denotes what is contrary to intelligence, thus falsity, is
evident also in Isaiah: The rivers shall recede; the rivers of Egypt
shall diminish and be dried up; the papyri beside the river, beside the
mouth of the river, and all the seed of the river, shall become dry,
shall be driven forward; and therefore the fishers shall mourn, and all
they that cast a hook into the river shall be sad, and they that spread
a net upon the faces of the waters shall languish (Isa. 19:6-8); that
here by the "river of Egypt" no river is meant, nor by "fishers"
fishers, but that other things are meant, which do not appear unless it
is known what is meant by "Egypt," by the "river" there, and by
"fishers," is also evident; if these things are known, the sense is
manifest. That by the "river of Egypt" is signified falsity, is plain
from the particulars here. \[3\] In Jeremiah: Who is this that riseth up
like the river, whose waters are tossed like the rivers? Egypt riseth up
like the river, and his waters are tossed as the rivers; for he hath
said, I will go up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city, and
them that dwell therein (Jer. 46:7-8); here also the "river of Egypt"
denotes falsities; to "go up and cover the earth" denotes to do so to
the church; to "destroy the city," denotes to destroy the doctrine of
the church; "and them that dwell therein," denotes the goods thence
derived. (That the "earth" is the church may be seen above, n. 6649; and
the "city," the doctrine of the church, n. 402, 2449, 3216, 4492, 4493;
and "inhabitants," the goods therein, n. 2268, 2451, 2712.) \[4\] In
Ezekiel: Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great
whale that liest in the midst of his rivers; who hath said, The river is
mine, and I have made myself. Therefore I will put hooks in thy jaws,
and I will make the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I
will make thee go up out of the midst of thy rivers, and every fish of
thy rivers shall stick in thy scales. I will leave thee in the
wilderness, and every fish of thy rivers (Ezek. 29:3-5, 9-10); what
these things signify no one can know without the internal sense (that
Egypt is not meant, is evident), thus unless it is known what is meant
by "Pharaoh," and what by a "river," a "whale," a "fish," and "scales."
(That "Pharaoh" is the natural where memory-knowledge is, may be seen
above, n. 5160, 5799, 6015; and that "whales" are the generals of
memory-knowledges in the natural, n. 42; and "fishes" memory-knowledges
under the general, n. 40, 991.) "Scales" denote those things which are
manifestly external, thus sensuous, to which memory-knowledges which are
falsities adhere. When these things are known, it is evident what is
meant in the above passage by the "river of Egypt" namely, falsity.
\[5\] Again: In that day when Pharaoh shall go down into hell I will
make a mourning; I will cover the abyss over him, and I will curb his
rivers, and the great waters shall be dammed up (Ezek. 31:15). Shall not
the earth be shaken for this, and everyone mourn that dwelleth therein,
so that it shall go up all of it like a brook, and be driven out, and
overwhelmed as by the river of Egypt? In that day I will make the sun to
set at noon, and I will darken the earth in the day of light (Amos
8:8-9; 9:5); the "earth" which shall be "shaken" denotes the church (n.
6649); "to be overwhelmed as by the river of Egypt" denotes to perish by
falsities; and because falsities are signified, it is said that "the sun
shall set at noon," and that "the earth shall be darkened in the day of
light." By "the sun setting at noon" is signified that the good of
celestial love would recede, and by "the earth being darkened in the day
of light," that falsities would take possession of the church. (That the
"sun" is the good of celestial love, may be seen above, n. 1529, 1530,
2441, 2495, 3636, 3643, 4060, 4696; also that "darkness" is falsity, n.
1839, 1860, 4418, 4531; and that the "earth" is the church, n. 82, 662,
1066, 1067, 1262, 1411, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 2355,
4447, 4535, 5577.) Everyone can see that other things are signified here
than what appear in the letter, as that "the earth shall be shaken," and
that "everyone that dwelleth therein shall mourn," that "the sun shall
set at noon," and "the earth be darkened in the day of light." Unless
the church is understood by the "earth," falsity by the "river," and
celestial love by the "sun," no sense which can be unfolded is found
there. \[6\] As the "river of Egypt" signifies falsity, therefore Moses
was commanded to smite with his staff upon the waters of that river, and
they were consequently turned into blood, and every fish died in the
river, and the river stank (Exod. 7:17-21); and Aaron also was commanded
to stretch out his hand with the rod over the rivers, over the streams,
and over the pools, whereupon frogs came up over the land of Egypt
(Exod. 8:1, 2). That "waters" in the opposite sense signify falsities
(see n. 790); and as the waters are those of the river, the "river"
relatively denotes falsity in general.

And every daughter ye shall keep alive. That this signifies that they
should not assault good, is evident from what was said above (n. 6677),
where like words occur.

On the inhabitants of other earths. As of the Lord's Divine mercy the
interiors of my spirit have been opened, and it has thus been granted me
to speak with those who are in the other life, not only with those from
this earth, but also with those from other earths, therefore, as it was
my desire to know about these latter, and as the things that have been
given me to know are worthy of mention, I may relate them at the end of
the following chapters. I have not spoken with the inhabitants
themselves of these earths, but with the spirits and angels who had been
inhabitants of them; and this not merely for a day or a week, but for
some months, with open instruction from heaven as to whence they were.
That there are many earths, and men upon them, and spirits and angels
from them, is very well known in the other life, for everyone who so
desires is allowed to speak with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6696.">6696.</span></span>

There are spirits who in the Grand Man bear relation to the memory, and
they are from the planet Mercury. They are allowed to wander about, and
to acquire knowledges of things that are in the universe; and they are
also allowed to pass out of this solar system into others. They have
said that there are earths, with men upon them, not only in this system,
but also in the universe, in immense numbers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6697.">6697.</span></span>

I have sometimes spoken about this with spirits, and it was said that a
man of good understanding can know from many things that there are many
earths with inhabitants upon them; for he can conclude from reason that
masses of such size as the earths, some of which surpass this earth in
magnitude, are not empty masses, created only to course about the sun,
and give light to one earth; but that their use must be of greater
eminence than this. He who believes, as everyone ought to believe, that
the Divine created the universe for no other end than that the human
race may arise, and a heaven therefrom (for the human race is the
nursery of heaven), cannot but believe that there are men wherever there
is any earth. That the earths which are visible to our eyes, being
within the boundaries of this solar system, are earths may be clearly
known from the fact that they are bodies of earthy material, because
they reflect the sun's light; also that they, like our earth, revolve
around the sun, and thereby make years and seasons of the year-spring,
summer, autumn, and winter-with variation according to climate; and
likewise that they revolve upon their own axes like our earth, and
thereby make days and times of the day-morning, noon, evening, and
night; and moreover that some of them have moons, which are called
satellites and revolve about their respective earths in stated times, as
the moon does about our earth; and that the earth Saturn, because very
far from the sun, has also a great lunar belt, which gives much light to
that earth, though reflected. How can anyone who knows these facts and
thinks from reason, say that these are empty bodies!

<span class="margnote"><span id="6698.">6698.</span></span>

Moreover, I have said with spirits that men can believe that there are
more earths in the universe than one from the fact that the visible
universe, resplendent with countless stars, is so immense, and yet is
only a means to the ultimate end of creation, which is a heavenly
kingdom, in which the Divine can dwell. For the visible universe is a
means for the existence of earths, and of men upon them, from whom is
the heavenly kingdom. Who can ever think that so vast a means exists for
so small and limited an end as there would be if only one earth were
inhabited, and from it alone existed heaven! What would this be for the
Divine, which is infinite, and to which a thousand, nay, myriads of
earths, and all of them full of inhabitants, would be little, and
scarcely anything! Moreover, the angelic heaven is so immense that it
corresponds to every single thing in man, and tens of thousands of its
inhabitants to each member, organ, and viscus; and it has been granted
to know that heaven, in respect to all its correspondences, can in no
wise exist except from the inhabitants of a host of earths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6699.">6699.</span></span>

I have sometimes seen as it were a great continuous stream, at a
considerable distance to the right, in the plane of the sole of the
foot; and it was said by angels that they who come from the worlds come
that way, and that they appear as a stream by reason of their multitude.
From the size and rapidity of the stream I could judge that some myriads
of men flow to it daily. From this also it has been given me to know
that the earths are very numerous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6700.">6700.</span></span>

As regards the Divine worship of the inhabitants of other earths, all
who are not idolaters acknowledge the Lord as the only God. They do not
indeed know, except a very few, that the Lord assumed the Human in this
earth and made it Divine; but they adore the Divine not as a Divine
altogether incomprehensible, but as comprehensible through the human
form; for when the Divine appears to them it appears in this form, as it
also formerly appeared to Abraham and others on this earth; and because
they adore the Divine under a human form, they adore the Lord. They also
know that no one can be conjoined with the Divine in faith and love
unless the Divine is in a form which they comprehend with some idea; if
not in a form the idea would be dissipated, like sight in the universe.
When told by the spirits of our earth that the Lord took upon Himself
the Human in this earth, they mused a while, and presently said that
this was done for the sake of the salvation of the human race; and that
they adore with most holy worship the Divine which shines as the sun in
heaven, and when it appears, presents itself to view in the human form.
That the Lord appears as a sun in the other life. And that thence comes
all the light of heaven, see n. 1053, 1521, 1529, 1530, 1531, 3636,
3643, 4060, 4321, 5097; but on this subject more will be specifically
related hereafter.
