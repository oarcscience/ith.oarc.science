### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="8801.">8801.</span></span>

If a beast, if a man, he shall not live. That this signifies that good
and truth will lose their spiritual life, is evident from the
signification of "a beast," as being the affection of good (see n. 45,
46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 776, 2179, 2180, 3218, 3519, 5198, 7523);
from the signification of "a man" as being truth (n. 3134, 3459, 7716);
and from the signification of "living," as being spiritual life (n.
5890); consequently "not to live" denotes to lose that life. Good and
truth lose life when the influx from the Lord is no longer perceived,
for from this they have their life. The very good and truth then indeed
appear in outward aspect like good and truth; but not otherwise than as
something painted, which in itself is not alive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8802.">8802.</span></span>

When the jobel <span id="fr_176"></span>[8802-1](#fn_176.md) is drawn out.
That this signifies with those who have a general perception of
celestial good, is evident from the signification of "when the jobel is
drawn out," or what is the same, when the sound of the trumpet is heard,
as being a general perception of celestial good; for by "being heard" is
signified perception (n. 5017, 8361), and by "the jobel," or "sound of
the trumpet," is signified celestial good. The reason why celestial good
is signified by "the sound of the trumpet," or "the jobel," is that from
their sounds musical instruments correspond to affections of truth and
good; stringed instruments to affections of truth, and wind instruments
to affections of good (n. 418-420, 4138, 8337). The trumpet, being a
wind instrument, and high-sounding, corresponded to the affection of
celestial good; wherefore also the "jubilee," by which was represented
the marriage of good and truth which is in the inmost heaven, was named
therefrom. Therefore now it is, that by "when the jobel is drawn out,"
is signified those who have a general perception of celestial good. By
those who are in a general perception of celestial good are meant those
who are intermediate between the Lord's celestial kingdom and His
spiritual kingdom, through whom therefore are effected influx,
communication, and conjunction (see just above, n. 8787, 8796). These
have extension even into the celestial societies, which is signified by
"they shall come up into the mountain." These intermediate ones are
represented by Moses (n. 8787), and also by Aaron, to whom it was
granted to go up into the mountain (see verse 24). (What is this
extension into the spheres of angelic societies, and that everyone's
extension is such as his good is, see n. 8794.) General perception
exists with those who are in spiritual good and can receive a general
influx of the good of a higher heaven, in this case, of the inmost
heaven. Such are meant by "those who shall come up into the mountain
when the jobel is heard."

<span class="margnote"><span id="8803.">8803.</span></span>

They shall come up into the mountain. That this signifies extension as
far as the celestial societies, is evident from what was said and shown
above (n. 8794, 8795), and also just above (n. 8802).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8804.">8804.</span></span>

Verses 14, 15. And Moses went down from the mountain unto the people,
and sanctified the people, and they washed their garments. And he said
unto the people, Be ready for three days, come not near unto a woman.
"And Moses went down from the mountain unto the people," signifies
application and preparation through truth from the Divine for receiving
truths in good; "and sanctified the people," signifies the veiling over
of the interiors that they may appear to be in the holiness of faith;
"and they washed their garments," signifies the purification of the
truths of faith; "and he said unto the people, Be ready for three days,"
signifies full preparation; "come not near unto a woman," signifies the
purification of the good of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8805.">8805.</span></span>

And Moses went down from the mountain unto the people. That this
signifies application and preparation through truth from the Divine for
receiving truths in good, is evident from the signification of "going
down," when said of Moses, by whom is represented truth from the Divine,
as being application, and also preparation, through it; from the
representation of Moses, as being truth from the Divine (see n. 8760,
8787), and also as being what mediates (n. 8787), thus likewise what
prepares and applies; from the signification of "the mountain," as being
the Divine in heaven, thus heaven; and from the representation of the
sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church, thus
those who are in truth through which is good, and in good from which is
truth, here in the good in which truths are to be received. It is
important to know what is specifically signified by "Mount Sinai;" and
also what is represented by the people Israel, and likewise what by
Moses in this chapter and in the following chapters of the book of
Exodus. \[2\] By "MOUNT SINAI" is specifically signified heaven, out of
which truths flow in from the Lord; therefore by "the coming down of
Jehovah upon that mountain" is signified His presence in heaven. And as
heaven, in which Jehovah is, that is, the Lord, is signified by "Mount
Sinai," by it is also signified Divine good united to Divine truth
there, for from this heaven is heaven. \[3\] But by the "PEOPLE ISRAEL"
near this mountain is represented the spiritual church as to the good in
which the truths of faith are to be implanted; for it has been already
shown that they who are of the spiritual church have two states; the
former when they are led through truths to good, the latter when they
are in good and from good in truths; in the present case, when they are
in the good in which truths are to be implanted, which state is a middle
state between the former and the latter. The truths which are implanted
in good are contained in those things which were promulgated from Mount
Sinai by the Lord, and were communicated by Moses to the people. \[4\]
By "MOSES" in this chapter and in the following chapters is represented
truth from the Divine beneath heaven conjoined with truth Divine in
heaven, and consequently mediating between the Divine in heaven and the
good in which truths are to be implanted which belongs to the spiritual
church, thus mediating between the Lord and the people. It is important
to know these things for the sake of understanding what follows in the
book of Exodus. From all this it can also be seen that by "Moses went
down from the mountain unto the people" is signified application and
preparation by means of truth from the Divine for receiving truths in
good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8806.">8806.</span></span>

And sanctified the people. That this signifies the veiling over of the
interiors that they may appear to be in the holiness of faith, is
evident from what was unfolded above (n. 8788); but it was there set
forth what was the sanctification with the Israelitish people, namely,
that it was a veiling over of the interiors, so that as to their
externals they might appear to be in what was holy when they were in
representative worship; and that unless their interiors had then been
veiled over, they would not only have defiled the holiness of worship by
foul thoughts and evil affections, but would also have totally destroyed
it, so that nothing celestial and spiritual which was represented in the
external things would have been perceived therefrom in heaven. \[2\] But
as by "the sons of Israel" are here meant those who are of the spiritual
church, it shall be briefly told what is meant by "sanctification" with
these. They who are of the spiritual church and live a life of truth and
from this a life of good, are withheld from evils and are kept in good
by the Lord. The good which is from the Lord is holy with them.
Consequently insofar as they receive good from the Lord, so far they are
holy; and they receive so much of good from the Lord, that is, are so
far holy, as they live a life of good according to the genuine truths of
faith, and at the same time believe that all the good which they then
think and do is from the Lord. Then, too, evils with them are separated
so as not to appear at all, especially those which they have derived
hereditarily from parents, and which are filthy, because they have been
successively accumulated with the parents for many ages back, and thus
amassed in the offspring. These are the interiors which with those who
are of the spiritual church are hid away and as it were veiled over (n.
966, 1667, 2307, 2308, 3701, 4317, 8550). Hence it is that all the will
they possess hereditarily is destroyed. For this cause a new will is
formed with them in the intellectual part by means of truths of faith
from the Lord. This is the reason why, when they are being regenerated,
they are led by means of truths to good; and afterward when they have
been regenerated, from good into the truths of good. Hence it is evident
how a new will is created in them by the Lord. (That this is formed in
the intellectual part with those who are of the spiritual church, see n.
863, 875, 895, 927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 1555, 2256, 4328, 4493, 5113,
6125.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="8807.">8807.</span></span>

And they washed their garments. That this signifies the purification of
the truths of faith, is evident from what was said above (n. 8789),
where like words occur.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8808.">8808.</span></span>

And he said unto the people, Be ready for three days. That this
signifies full preparation, is evident from what was said above (n.
8790), where are like words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8809.">8809.</span></span>

Come not near unto a woman. That this signifies the purification of the
good of faith, is evident from the fact that the marriages with the
Israelitish nation were impure, because their interiors were filthy; for
conjugial love descends from the marriage of good and truth; and
therefore those who as to the interiors are not in good and truth cannot
be in pure marriage; and they who as to the interiors are in evil and
falsity, as was that nation, are in impure marriage. Hence it is that
"not to come near unto a woman" denotes to abstain from what is impure.
(That conjugial love descends from the heavenly marriage, which is that
of good and truth, see n. 2727-2759, 2803, 3132, 4434, 4835; and that
with the people descended from Jacob there was not anything conjugial,
and therefore it was permitted them to have more than one wife, n.
3246.) But as regards those who are of the spiritual church and are here
represented by the sons of Israel, neither are they in anything
conjugial until with them truth has been implanted in good. Before this
is the case, there is indeed marriage, but not pure marriage, for in the
interiors there is not before this a marriage of good and truth. Hence
it is that by "not to come near unto a woman" is signified in the
internal sense to be purified as to the good of faith; for in this
chapter the good in which truth has not yet been implanted is treated
of, and in the following chapters the implanting.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8810.">8810.</span></span>

Verses 16-19. And it was on the third day, when it was morning, that
there were voices and lightnings, and a heavy cloud upon the mountain,
and the voice of a trumpet exceeding strong, and all the people that
were in the camp trembled. And Moses made the people go forth out of the
camp to meet God; and they took their stand in the lower parts of the
mountain. And Mount Sinai smoked, the whole of it, because Jehovah
descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke
of a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled mightily. And when the
voice of the trumpet was going, and waxing strong mightily, Moses spake,
and God answered him in a voice. "And it was on the third day,"
signifies at the end of the purification; "when it was morning,"
signifies a state when they were in good; "that there were voices and
lightnings," signifies a Divine state in which was revelation; "and a
heavy cloud upon the mountain," signifies a Divine state in respect to
those who were about to receive; "and the voice of a trumpet exceeding
strong," signifies a celestial state which was round about; "and all the
people that were in the camp trembled," signifies a holy tremor on the
part of those who were about to receive; "and Moses made the people go
forth out of the camp to meet God," signifies the power of truth from
the Divine to prepare them to receive the Divine in the good with them;
"and they took their stand in the lower parts of the mountain,"
signifies far from the good of celestial love; "and Mount Sinai smoked,
the whole of it," signifies the appearing of celestial good in the
greatest obscurity; "because Jehovah descended upon it in fire,"
signifies because the Divine was there in celestial love; "and the smoke
thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace," signifies obscurity like
the obscurity from cupidities; "and the whole mountain trembled
mightily," signifies the commotion of heaven; "and when the voice of the
trumpet was going, and waxing strong mightily," signifies what is
general of revelation through the angelic heaven; "Moses spake, and God
answered him in a voice," signifies by means of an influx of truth from
the Divine wherein was the Divine Itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8811.">8811.</span></span>

And it was on the third day. That this signifies at the end of the
purification, is evident from the signification of "the third day," as
being the end of a state of preparation to receive (see above, n. 8791),
thus the end of the purification.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8812.">8812.</span></span>

When it was morning. That this signifies a state when they were in good,
is evident from the signification of "morning," as being a state of the
good of love (see n. 8426). From what is here said, that Jehovah, that
is, the Lord; descended upon Mount Sinai on the third day, and also on
the morning of that day, it is very manifest that this was
representative of some Divine thing in heaven, which cannot be made
known to anyone except from the correspondence of such things as come
forth in the natural world with things that are in the spiritual world,
and from the consequent signification; as in the present case what
"morning" signifies, and what "the third day." That "the third day"
denotes the end of a former state, is because by "three" is signified
what is full from beginning to end (n. 8790); and that "morning" denotes
a state of the good of love, is because the sun which in the other life
gives light to the angels and to the universal heaven, is the Lord, and
the fire there is His Divine love, which gives the heat of life to every
living being, and the light there is the Divine truth which enlightens
all who receive it; quite differently from the sun of this world, the
fire of which is fire and not love, and the light from which is light
and not truth. \[2\] From all this it can be seen what are the effects
of the fire and also of the light from the sun of the world, and what
are the effects of the fire and light from the sun of heaven, namely,
that from the former the heat and light are devoid of life, but from the
latter the heat and light are attended with life. These latter, namely,
those which come forth from the sun of heaven, are therefore called
"spiritual," because they have life in them; and the former, which are
from the sun of the world, are called "natural," and have no life in
them. The life which in living beings is noticed in heat and from heat,
is not from the heat of the sun of the world, but is from the heat of
the sun of heaven. When this heat flows into the heat of the world, it
produces that effect, and is felt in the body as elementary heat; but
there is in it vital heat that has its origin from the love which is
heat from the sun of heaven. That the origin of the heat of life is from
some other source, and that it is in love and is according to the
measure and the quality of the love, everyone can know provided he is
willing to reflect aright, except those who do not acknowledge anything
internal in man, and who ascribe all things to nature. \[3\] As
therefore the heat from the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, is the
good of love, and as the light therefrom is the truth of faith, it can
be seen what is signified by "morning," and what by "noon," by "evening"
and by "night," in the other life, namely, that they are states of good
and truth, or of love and faith; "morning," a state of the good of love;
"noon," a state of the truth of faith; and "evening," and "night," the
privation of these, which is ignorance and blindness in the things that
are of faith, also torpor and cold in the things that are of heavenly
love. \[4\] Moreover the case is similar with the sun of heaven as with
the sun of the world, namely, that it is fixed and does not cause those
states by any circumgyration; but that they are caused by the
surrounding bodies, as by the earth revolving around the sun and at the
same time around its own axis; from which comes the appearance that
those changes arise from the sun, when yet they are not from the sun,
but from the world revolving about it. So also in heaven, the changes of
state there, to which morning, noon, evening, and night correspond, do
not arise from the sun there, for the sun is always sending forth heat
and light, that is, the good of love and the truth of faith; but those
changes arise with those who receive, namely, with angels and spirits
who by stated alternations according to their life are now in morning,
that is, in the good of love; now in noon, that is, in the truth of
faith; now in evening and night, that is, in shade and torpor as to love
and faith. \[5\] The reason why the case is similar in the world as in
heaven, with the difference that in the world they are states of times
which so succeed each other, and in heaven states of life, is that all
things in the world were created after the image of things that are in
heaven, because natural things come forth from spiritual things as
effects from their causes. Hence there is a correspondence of all things
in the world with those which are in heaven, and hence universal nature
is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom (n. 3483, 4939, 8211).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8813.">8813.</span></span>

That there were voices and lightnings. That this signifies a Divine
state which was revelation, is evident from the signification of
"voices" which are sounds of thunders, as being truths Divine; and from
the signification of "lightnings," as being the ruddy glow and
brightness of these truths, for truths Divine are bright and glowing
from the flame of the light that is from the sun of heaven. Hence it is
that by "voices and lightnings" is signified a Divine state in which is
revelation; a Divine state, by the descent of such things from heaven;
and revelation, by the voices and lightnings being truths Divine. That
by "voices" which are of thunders from heaven are signified truths
Divine, see n. 7573; and that "lightnings" denote the brightnesses from
them which strike upon the internal sight of man, enlightening those who
are in truth from good, and confounding those who are in falsity from
evil, is evident from passages in the Word where "lightnings" are
mentioned, as in David: The clouds dripped waters, the skies gave forth
a voice, and Thine arrows went abroad, the voice of Thy thunder into the
world, the lightnings enlightened the world, the earth shook and
trembled (Ps. 77:17, 18); where "the voice of thunder" denotes truth
Divine (n. 7573); "lightnings" denote its brightness; and "the world,"
the church; consequently "the lightnings enlightened the world" denotes
the enlightening of the church by truth Divine. \[2\] In like manner in
the same: His lightnings enlightened the world, the earth shall see and
shall fear, the mountains shall melt like wax before Jehovah (Ps. 97:4,
5). What Jehovah willeth, He doeth in the heavens and in earth, in the
seas and in all abysses, who maketh the vapors to ascend from the
extremity of the earth, He maketh lightnings for the rain (Ps. 135:6-7;
Jer. 10:13; 51:16); where "lightnings for the rain" denotes the
brightness of the truth that comes down from heaven. In John: There were
lightning, voices, and thunders (Rev. 11:19; 16:18); where "voices,
lightnings, and thunders" denote truths Divine which enlighten the good
and terrify the evil. \[3\] In Ezekiel: The appearance of the living
creatures (which were cherubs) was like burning coals of fire, like the
appearance of torches, and it went along among the living creatures, so
that there was the brightness of fire, and out of the fire went forth
lightning. And the living creatures were running and returning according
to the appearance of lightning (Ezek. 1:13-14); where "fire" denotes the
good of love, and "lightning going forth out of the fire," the truth
Divine therefrom. The Divine Providence of the Lord, which is truth
Divine proceeding from the Divine good of the Lord, is here described by
the "cherubs." \[4\] In Daniel: Behold one clothed in linen, whose loins
were girded with gold of Uphaz, and his body was like a tarshish, his
face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as torches of fire
(Dan. 10:5-6). "The face as the appearance of lightning" denotes the
love of truth, because the truth which is from love bears with it a
flaming from fire, which flaming is "lightning." \[5\] In Zechariah:
Jehovah shall appear over them, and His arrow shall go forth as the
lightning; and the Lord Jehovih shall sound with the trumpet, and shall
advance in whirlwinds of the south (Zech. 9:14). "The arrow which shall
go forth as the lightning" denotes truth Divine which reproves and
penetrates. That "an arrow" denotes the truth of doctrine, see n. 2686,
2709; thus "an arrow from Jehovah" denotes truth Divine. \[6\] In Nahum:
The brightness of a sword, the lightning of a spear, and a multitude of
slain (Nah. 3:3). In Moses: I will sharpen the lightning of My sword
(Deut. 32:41); denoting the penetration of truth Divine with the evil;
"sword" denotes truth fighting (n. 2799, 8294); and "lightning" the
brightness of it which strikes upon the intellectual and deprives it of
the faculty of seeing truth: in like manner in Ezekiel 21:20-32. From
all this it is also evident that by "lightning" is meant truth Divine,
as in Matthew 28:3, and in Luke 17:24.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8814.">8814.</span></span>

And a heavy cloud upon the mountain. That this signifies a Divine state
in respect to those who were about to receive, is evident from the
signification of "a cloud," as being truth accommodated to those who are
about to receive, thus the Word in the letter (see n. 8443, 8781); here
truth Divine accommodated to the people descended from Jacob; and
because this people was in great darkness as to truths Divine, it is
therefore called "a heavy cloud," and above (verse 9) "the density of a
cloud," and below (verse 18) "smoke of fire as the smoke of a furnace."
In what great darkness they were, can be seen from what has been related
above (n. 8788) about that nation, and also from the fact that the
things which pertain to the internal man were not revealed to them, but
only those which pertain to the external man. For they did not apprehend
internal things, nor were they willing to apprehend them, because these
were contrary to their loves, which were that they might be the most
exalted of all peoples in the world, and also the most opulent of all,
and that all other nations might be as nothing in comparison with them.
Where these loves are, there heavenly loves cannot be received, for
these are extinguished and suffocated by the worldly loves. This is the
reason why Jehovah, that is, the Lord, appeared to them in a dense and
heavy cloud, in like manner as is the case in the other life, where they
who are in falsities from evil are encompassed with a dense and black
cloud in accordance with the quality and the amount of the falsities.
This appears to everyone there before the eyes, and yet the sun there is
continually shining. (On this subject see what has been said above, n.
6832, 8137, 8138.) Speaking generally, the Divine in the other life
appears to everyone according to the quality of his faith and love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8815.">8815.</span></span>

And the voice of a trumpet exceeding strong. That this signifies a
celestial state which was round about, is evident from the signification
of "the voice," or sound, "of a trumpet," as being the truth of
celestial good, "a voice" denoting truth, and "a trumpet" celestial good
(as above, n. 8802). That it denotes a celestial state which was round
about, is because the Divine in heaven is in the midst or inmost, that
is, in the highest there; but relatively to the angels heaven is around
or outside of them, that is, is beneath, for that which is around is
also outside, and that which is outside is also beneath. Truth Divine
itself in heaven is signified by "voices" and "lightnings," but the
celestial or angelic truth adjoined to what is Divine, which is beneath
or around, is signified by "the voice of a trumpet," in like manner as
in Zechariah: Jehovah shall appear over them, and His arrow shall go
forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovih shall sound with the
trumpet, and shall advance in whirlwinds of the south (Zech. 9:14). And
in David: God is gone up with a sounding, Jehovah with the voice of a
trumpet (Ps. 47:5); where "a sounding" denotes the truth of spiritual
good; "the voice of a trumpet," the truth of celestial good. \[2\] The
Divine truth which passes through heaven is also meant by the trumpets
with which the angels sounded (Rev. 8:2, 6-8, 12, 13; 9:14). Truth
Divine from heaven was also represented by the seven trumpets with which
the seven priests sounded before the ark or before Jehovah, when the
walls of the city Jericho fell (Josh. 6); also by the trumpets with
which the three hundred men who were with Gideon sounded round about the
camp of Midian, Amalek, and the sons of the east (Judg. 7). The reason
why the trumpets produced this effect was that they represented the
truth Divine through the heavens, which is such that it perfects the
good, but destroys the evil; the reason why it perfects the good is that
these receive the Divine good which is in the truth; but that it
destroys the evil is because these do not receive the Divine good which
is in it. The "walls of Jericho" signified the falsities which defended
evils; and "Midian, Amalek, and the sons of the east," round about whose
camp the three hundred men of Gideon sounded the trumpets, signified
those who were in evils and in the derivative falsities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8816.">8816.</span></span>

And all the people that were in the camp trembled. That this signifies a
holy tremor on the part of those who were about to receive, is evident
from the signification of "trembling," as being a holy tremor; and from
the signification of "the people that were in the camp," as being those
who were about to receive the Divine truth. It is said in the Word in
various places that when Jehovah comes down, "the earth trembles, and
the mountains melt" (as in Ps. 77:17, 18; 97:4, 5; 104:32, and
elsewhere); whereby is signified the commotion of all at the presence of
the Divine; for the Divine is such that no one can endure it unless he
is in a kind of cloud, and thus is accommodated to its reception; for it
is like the fire which is in the sun, which if it were to fall naked on
anyone, would consume him in a moment. But the reception is according to
the good with each person. They who are in good do indeed tremble at the
presence of the Divine, but it is a holy tremor which precedes
reception. But they who are in evil are in terror at the presence of the
Divine, and therefore flee away, and are then enveloped in their
falsities as in a dusky cloud, and are hidden. These things are
signified by the "caves of the rocks" into which they then betake
themselves. From all this it can be seen what is signified by "all the
people that were in the camp trembled."

<span class="margnote"><span id="8817.">8817.</span></span>

And Moses made the people go forth out of the camp to meet God. That
this signifies the power of truth from the Divine to prepare them to
receive the Divine in the good with them, is evident from the
signification of "making the people go forth to meet God," as being the
power to prepare them to receive the Divine; for in what follows the
subject treated of is the law promulgated upon Mount Sinai, which
denotes the Divine that they were to receive, for "the law" denotes
Divine truth from Divine good. Hence it is that "making go forth to
meet" denotes the power of preparing for reception by means of the truth
from the Divine which is represented by Moses (see n. 8760, 8787, 8805).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8818.">8818.</span></span>

And they took their stand in the lower parts of the mountain. That this
signifies far from the good of celestial love, is evident from the
signification of "Mount Sinai," as being heaven, and thus good Divine
united to Divine truth there (see n. 8805); and from the signification
of "taking their stand in the lower parts" of it, as being far or remote
from it. In the internal historical sense the Israelitish nation is here
meant, which was devoid of the good of celestial love (see above, n.
8788, 8806), and consequently was far from it; and therefore it is also
said below that Moses charged the people and also the priests not to
break through the bounds and touch the mountain and thus die (verses 21,
22, 24, 25). But in the internal sense, wherein those who are of the
spiritual church are treated of, by their "taking their stand in the
lower parts of the mountain," is signified that it was not allowable to
ascend to a higher heaven by reason of self-confidence, and that if they
ascended they would die (concerning which see above, n. 8794, 8797).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8819.">8819.</span></span>

And Mount Sinai smoked, the whole of it. That this signifies the
appearing of celestial good in the greatest obscurity, is evident from
the signification of "Mount Sinai," as being celestial good (see just
above, n. 8818); and from the signification of "smoking," as being an
appearing in obscurity. By obscurity is meant the obscurity of faith,
such as is theirs who are of the spiritual church as compared with the
faith of those who are of the celestial church (n. 2708, 2715, 2718,
2831, 2935, 2937, 3241, 3833, 6289). By the greatest obscurity, which is
signified by "Mount Sinai smoked, the whole of it," and by what is said
just below, that "the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace,"
is meant that obscurity in which was the Israelitish nation, before whom
the appearing took place; for Jehovah or the Lord appears to everyone
according to his quality (see n. 8788, 8814), thus as love and as the
light of truth to those who are in good, but as an enemy and avenger to
those who are in evil. That so did He appear to the Israelitish people,
is also evident from other passages in Moses: The appearance of the
glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain
before the eyes of the sons of Israel (Exod. 24:17). Ye came near and
stood under the mountain; when the mountain burned with fire unto the
heart of heaven, darkness, and cloud, and thick darkness. And Jehovah
spake unto you out of the midst of the fire (Deut. 4:11, 12; 5:22). It
came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness,
and the mountain did burn with fire, that ye came near unto me, and ye
said, why shall we die? because this great fire will devour us: if we
hear the voice of Jehovah our God anymore, we shall die (Deut. 5:23-25).
\[2\] The reason for this is that no one can see God otherwise than from
such things as are in himself, so that he who is in hatred sees Him from
hatred, he who is in unmercifulness sees Him in unmercifulness; and on
the other hand, they who are in charity and mercy see Him from, and thus
in, charity and mercy. The case herein is as it is with the rays of
light, which when they fall into ugly forms are turned into ugly colors;
but when they fall into beautiful forms are turned into beautiful
colors. (That "smoke" denotes the obscurity of truth and also the thick
darkness which is of falsity, is evident in Isa. 9:18, 19; 34:9, 10; in
Joel 2:30, 31; in Hos. 13:3; and in Rev. 9:17, 18; 18:18; 19:3.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="8820.">8820.</span></span>

Because Jehovah descended upon it in fire. That this signifies because
the Divine was there in celestial love, is evident from the
signification of the "fire in which Jehovah was," as being Divine
celestial love; that "fire" denotes love, see n. 934, 4906, 5071, 5215,
6314, 6832, 6834, 6849, here Divine celestial love, that is, love Divine
such as is in the heaven where the celestial angels are.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8821.">8821.</span></span>

And the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace. That this
signifies obscurity like the obscurity from cupidities, is evident from
the signification of "smoke," as being obscurity (see above, n. 8819);
and from the signification of "a furnace," as being cupidity (n. 7519).
(The reason why the Lord, when in celestial love, appeared so to the
sons of Israel, see n. 8819, also n. 1861, 6832.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="8822.">8822.</span></span>

And the whole mountain trembled mightily. That this signifies the
commotion of heaven, is evident from the signification of "to tremble,"
as being commotion; and from the signification of "Mount Sinai," as
being heaven (see n. 8805). (That there is commotion at the presence of
the Divine, see n. 8816.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="8823.">8823.</span></span>

And when the voice of the trumpet was going, and waxing strong mightily.
That this signifies what is general of revelation through the angelic
heaven, is evident from the signification of "the voice of the trumpet,"
as being heavenly or angelic truth conjoined with what is Divine (see n.
8815), thus what is general of revelation; for truth Divine is
revelation, and that which is manifested through the medium of heaven is
general relatively to the truth Divine itself in heaven, for it is
without or around (n. 8815), and what is around and without is general
relatively to that which is in the midst, or which is within; and from
the signification of "going and waxing strong," as being the increase
thereof. For the case herein is as it is with sound which is on high,
where the atmosphere is purer, and the sound is silent; but when it
descends to lower regions where the atmosphere is denser, it becomes
louder and more sonorous. So it is with Divine truth and Divine good,
which in the highest are peaceful and cause no disturbance whatever; but
when they descend toward lower things they gradually become unpeaceful,
and finally tumultuous. This is what is so described by the Lord in the
first book of the Kings to Elijah, when he was in Horeb: Go forth, and
stand on the mountain before Jehovah; behold Jehovah is passing by; so
that there was a great and strong wind rending the mountains, and
breaking in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; Jehovah was not in the
wind. Then after the wind an earthquake; yet Jehovah was not in the
earthquake. After the earthquake a fire; Jehovah was not in the fire.
Lastly after the fire a still small voice <span
id="fr_177"></span>[8823-1](#fn_177) (1 Kings 19:11, 12.md).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8824.">8824.</span></span>

Moses spake, and God answered him in a voice. That this signifies by
means of an influx of truth from the Divine in which was the Divine
Itself, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being truth from
the Divine (see n. 8760, 8787, 8805); from the signification of
"speaking," as being influx (see n. 5797, 7270, 8128); and from the
signification of "answering in a voice," as being the Divine truth which
is the source. The reason why these things are signified, is that Divine
answers are truths in which is what is Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8825.">8825.</span></span>

Verses 20-25. And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, unto the head of
the mountain; and Jehovah called Moses unto the head of the mountain;
and Moses went up. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the
people, lest perchance they break through unto Jehovah to see, and many
of them fall. And the priests also, who come near unto Jehovah shall
sanctify themselves, lest perchance Jehovah make a breach in them. And
Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up unto Mount Sinai; for
Thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds to the mountain, and sanctify
it. And Jehovah said unto him, Go, get thee down; and come up thou, and
Aaron with thee; and let not the priests and the people break through to
come up unto Jehovah, lest perchance He make a breach in them. And Moses
went down unto the people, and told them. "And Jehovah came down upon
Mount Sinai," signifies the presence of the Lord in heaven; "unto the
head of the mountain," signifies in the inmost heaven; "and Jehovah
called Moses unto the head of the mountain, and Moses went up,"
signifies the conjunction of truth from the Divine there; "and Jehovah
said unto Moses," signifies exhortation from the Divine; "Go down,
charge the people, lest perchance they break through unto Jehovah to
see," signifies lest they who are of the spiritual church should desire
to ascend into the heaven where the Divine celestial is; "and many of
them fall," signifies that so they would perish; "and the priests also
who come near unto Jehovah shall sanctify themselves," signifies that
those who are in spiritual good in which is the Divine are to be covered
over; "lest perchance Jehovah make a breach in them," signifies
consequently separation from good; "and Moses said unto Jehovah,"
signifies the thought of truth from the Divine; "The people cannot come
up unto Mount Sinai," signifies that they cannot raise themselves to the
celestial kingdom; "for Thou didst charge us," signifies because they
have been cautioned by the Divine; "saying, Set bounds to the mountain,"
signifies by the fact that the spiritual sphere of good ceases below;
"and sanctify it \[the people\]," signifies that thus they may be kept
off from the Divine; "and Jehovah said unto him," signifies further
admonition; "Go, get thee down," signifies influx; "and come up thou,
and Aaron with thee," signifies conjunction with truth from the Divine
internal and external; "and let not the priests and the people break
through to come up unto Jehovah," signifies lest they who are in
spiritual good and truth desire to ascend into the celestial heaven;
"lest perchance He make a breach in them," signifies separation from
truth and good; "and Moses went down unto the people," signifies the
influx of the Divine through truth from the Divine; "and told them,"
signifies thus admonition.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8826.">8826.</span></span>

And Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai. That this signifies the presence
of the Lord in heaven, is evident from the signification of "Mount
Sinai," as being heaven (see n. 8805); consequently "to come down upon
that mountain," denotes presence there. That it is the presence of the
Lord, is because "Jehovah" in the Word denotes the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8827.">8827.</span></span>

To the head of the mountain. That this signifies in the inmost heaven,
is evident from the signification of "the mountain," as being heaven
(see just above, n. 8826); that "the head of the mountain," denotes the
inmost heaven, is because the head of the mountain is the highest of it,
and "the highest" signifies the inmost (n. 1735, 2148, 4210, 4599,
8153). There are three heavens, namely, the lowest, which is called the
first; the middle, which is called the second; and the inmost, which is
called the third. In this heaven is the Divine more than in the two
lower heavens, for in this they are under the immediate view of the
Lord, because they who are there are in love to the Lord, and hence in
peace and innocence above the rest. The angels who are there are called
"celestial angels," and the angels in the second heaven are called
"spiritual angels;" consequently the Divine in the one heaven is called
"the Divine celestial," and the Divine in the other heaven "the Divine
spiritual." From all this it can be seen what is signified by "Jehovah
came down upon the head of the mountain."

<span class="margnote"><span id="8828.">8828.</span></span>

And Jehovah called Moses unto the head of the mountain, and Moses went
up. That this signifies the conjunction of truth from the Divine there,
is evident from what was unfolded above (n. 8760, 8761), where like
words occur; here is signified conjunction with the Divine celestial,
that is, with the Divine of the inmost heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8829.">8829.</span></span>

And Jehovah said unto Moses. That this signifies exhortation from the
Divine, is evident from the signification of "saying," as involving the
things that follow, which concern the exhortation that they should not
break through the bounds with which the mountain was enclosed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8830.">8830.</span></span>

Go down, charge the people, lest perchance they break through unto
Jehovah to see. That this signifies lest they who are of the spiritual
church should desire to ascend into the heaven where the Divine
celestial is, is evident from the signification of "to charge," as being
exhortation; from the representation of the sons of Israel, who are here
"the people," as being those who are of the spiritual church (of which
frequently above); from the signification of "breaking through," namely,
the bounds, as being to desire to ascend into a higher heaven; and from
the signification of "seeing Jehovah," as being to perceive the Divine.
For by "Jehovah on the head of the mountain" is meant the Divine in the
inmost heaven, which is called "the celestial heaven" (see n. 8827); and
by "seeing" is meant perception (n. 2150, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8831.">8831.</span></span>

And many of them fall. That this signifies that so they would perish, is
evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8832.">8832.</span></span>

And the priests also, who come near unto Jehovah shall sanctify
themselves. That this signifies that those who are in spiritual good in
which is the Divine are to be covered over, is evident from the
signification of "priests," as being good (see n. 1728, 2015, 6145),
here spiritual good, because by the sons of Israel, whose priests they
were, were represented those who are of the spiritual church, thus who
are in good by means of truth and in truth from good (see n. 7957,
8234); from the signification of "coming near unto Jehovah," when said
of priests by whom good is signified, as being good in which is the
Divine; and from the signification of "being sanctified," as being to be
covered over as to the interiors (see n. 8788, 8806).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8833.">8833.</span></span>

Lest perchance Jehovah make a breach in them. That this signifies
separation from good, is evident from the signification of "making a
breach," as being the separation of truth from good (see n. 4926), here
separation from good, because it is said of the priests by whom good is
signified (n. 8832).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8834.">8834.</span></span>

And Moses said unto Jehovah. That this signifies the thought of truth
from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "saying," when by
the truth from the Divine which is represented by Moses, as being
thought (see also n. 3395, 7107, 7244, 7937). It is said "the thought of
truth from the Divine," and there is meant thought with him who
represents truth from the Divine. The reason why it is so said is also
because the truth with a man thinks, and the man in whom the thought is
thinks by means of truth. For the Lord flows in through good into truth,
and so gives life to a man. This life appears in the man as his, but it
is of the Lord in the truth from good that is with him. Because this is
so, the angels speak in this manner, for they attribute thought to truth
from good abstractedly from person, and thus at the same time perceive
whence comes the thought of truth. From all this it is evident what
angelic speech is, and that it is the speech of wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8835.">8835.</span></span>

The people cannot come up unto Mount Sinai. That this signifies that
they cannot raise themselves to the celestial kingdom, is evident from
the signification of "the people," or of "the sons of Israel," as being
those who are of the spiritual kingdom; from the signification of
"coming up," as being to raise; and from the signification of "Mount
Sinai," as being the celestial kingdom (see n. 8827). (How these things
are, may be seen above, n. 8794, 8797.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="8836.">8836.</span></span>

For thou didst charge us. That this signifies because they have been
cautioned by the Divine, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8837.">8837.</span></span>

Saying, Set bounds to the mountain. That this signifies by the fact that
the spiritual sphere of good ceases below, is evident from the
signification of "setting bounds to the mountain," as being extension
into heaven no further than to the spiritual spheres of good (see above,
n. 8794-8797).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8838.">8838.</span></span>

And sanctify it \[the people\]. That this signifies that thus they may
be kept off from the Divine, is evident from the signification of
"sanctifying," as being to veil over the interiors that the externals
may appear in holiness (see n. 8788, 8806), thus also to be kept off
from the Divine lest they should be hurt. For unless they were veiled
over, the Divine would penetrate and destroy, because the presence of
the Divine is like a consuming fire to those who are not veiled over.
Hence it is that even the angels are veiled over with a cloud (n. 6849).
From all this it can be seen what is meant by being veiled over. That
this is signified by "being sanctified" is because when they are veiled
over they appear in holiness, for then the Divine can flow in and
present there a state of good and a form of truth, which cannot be
effected without a veiling over.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8839.">8839.</span></span>

And Jehovah said unto him. That this signifies further admonition, is
evident from the signification of "saying," when by Jehovah unto Moses
(that he should charge the people not to break through to see), as being
admonition. That it is further admonition, is because it was said by
Moses that they had been charged about this matter, and cautioned that
they should not do it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8840.">8840.</span></span>

Go, get thee down. That this signifies influx, is evident from the
signification of "going and getting down to the people and admonishing
them," when by the Divine through the truth from the Divine which is
represented by Moses, as being influx namely of the Divine through truth
from the Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8841.">8841.</span></span>

And come up thou, and Aaron with thee. That this signifies conjunction
with truth from the Divine internal and external, is evident from the
signification of "coming up," namely, to Jehovah, as being conjunction
(see n. 8760); and from the representation of Moses and Aaron, as being
truth from the Divine internal and external; Moses representing internal
truth, and Aaron external truth (see n. 7089, 7382).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8842.">8842.</span></span>

And let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto
Jehovah. That this signifies lest they who are in spiritual good and
truth desire to ascend into the celestial heaven, is evident from what
was said above (n. 8830, 8832), where like words occur.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8843.">8843.</span></span>

Lest perchance He make a breach in them. That this signifies separation
from truth and good, is evident (as above, n. 8833), here, from truth
also, because it is said of the people also.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8844.">8844.</span></span>

And Moses went down unto the people, signifies the influx of the Divine
through truth from the Divine (as above, n. 8840).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8845.">8845.</span></span>

And told them, signifies thus admonition (as above, n. 8839).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8846.">8846.</span></span>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SPIRITS AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH JUPITER.
There are also spirits among those from the earth Jupiter whom they call
"chimney-sweepers," because they appear like these in dress and also in
face. They are among those who rebuke the men of their earth, and
afterward instruct them (see n. 7801-7812). To what such bear relation
in the Grand Man, and of what quality they are, may be seen from the
description of them above (n. 5056), which may here be transcribed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8847.">8847.</span></span>

A certain spirit from another earth was with me (he was from the earth
Jupiter) who earnestly begged me to intercede for him, that he might
come into heaven. He said that he was not aware of having done what is
evil, except that he had rebuked the inhabitants of that earth; adding
that after he had rebuked, he instructed them. He applied himself to my
left side under the elbow, and talked with as it were a broken voice,
and he could move one to pity. But I could only reply that I could give
him no help, and that this is of the Lord alone; and that I could not
intercede, because I did not know whether it would be useful or not, but
that if worthy he might hope. He was then sent back among the upright
spirits from his own earth; but these said that he could not be in their
company, because he was not such as they. Yet because with intense
longing he importuned to be let into heaven, he was sent into a society
of upright spirits of this earth; but they also said that he could not
be with them. In the light of heaven he was of a black color, but he
himself said that he was not of a black, but of a murrhine color. I was
told that they are such in the beginning who are afterward received
among those who constitute the province of the seminal vesicles; for in
these vesicles the semen is collected and clothed around with a suitable
material, fitted for preserving it from being dissipated, and which can
be put off in the neck of the womb, that so what has been preserved
within may serve for conception, that is, for the impregnation of the
ovum. Hence also there is in this seminal matter an endeavor, and as it
were a burning desire, to put itself off and leave the semen to perform
its use. Something similar showed itself in this spirit. He came again
to me, but in mean clothing, and again said that he was burning to come
into heaven, and that he now perceived that he was fit for it; but I was
given to tell him that perhaps this was an indication that he would soon
be received. He was then told by the angels to cast off his garment, and
in his longing he cast it off so quickly that scarcely anything could be
quicker. By this was represented the nature of the ardent desires of
those who are in the province to which the seminal vesicles correspond.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8848.">8848.</span></span>

It was said that when such have been prepared for heaven, they are
stripped of their garments, and are clothed in new shining ones, and
become angels. These the angels likened to caterpillars, which having
passed through their low estate, are changed into chrysalides, and thus
into butterflies, to which are then given other clothing and likewise
wings of blue, yellow, silver, or gold, and at the same time liberty to
fly in the air in their heaven, and to engage in marriages and lay eggs
and thus provide for the propagation of their kind, sweet and pleasant
food being also provided for them from the juices and odors of various
flowers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8849.">8849.</span></span>

One of the spirits from that earth came to me, saying that he was
seeking the One Only Lord, and that he longed to come into heaven; but
that he could not, because in the life of the body he had done evil. He
was asked what evil. He said that he had taken from a companion
something which was of little value and which he supposed his companion
was going to give him, and that this lay heavy on his conscience. From
this it was evident what kind of a life they live on that earth, and
that it torments them if they do evil to anyone, however slight; for he
had brought that thought with him from his earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8850.">8850.</span></span>

I was shown a bald head, but only its highest part, which was bony; and
I was told that such an appearance is seen by those who are to die
within a year, and that they then prepare themselves. On that earth they
do not fear death, except on account of leaving their consort, their
children, or their parents; for they know that they will live after
death, and that they do not go out of life, because they go into heaven;
and therefore they do not speak of dying, but of being heaven-made.
Those who on that earth have lived happy in conjugial love, and have
taken care of their children as it becomes parents to do, do not die by
diseases, but tranquilly, as in sleep, and thus migrate from the world
into heaven.
