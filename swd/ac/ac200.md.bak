### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="9951.">9951.</span></span>

Verse 41. And thou shall put them on Aaron thy brother, and on his sons
with him; and shalt anoint them, and fill their hand, and shalt sanctify
them, and they shall minister to Me in the priest's office. "And thou
shalt put them on Aaron thy brother," signifies such a state of Divine
good in the spiritual kingdom; "and on his sons with him," signifies
such a state there in the external things proceeding therefrom; "and
shalt anoint them," signifies a representative of the Lord as to the
good of love; "and fill their hand," signifies a representative of the
Lord as to the truth of faith; "and shalt sanctify them," signifies thus
a representative of the Lord as to the Divine Human; "and they shall
minister to Me in the priest's office," signifies a representative of
the Lord in respect to the whole work of salvation from the Divine
Human.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9952.">9952.</span></span>

And thou shalt put them on Aaron thy brother. That this signifies such a
state of Divine good in the spiritual kingdom, is evident from the
signification of "to put on," as being to induce the state of the thing
which is represented by the garments, here the state of Divine truth in
the spiritual kingdom; for by Aaron is represented the Lord as to Divine
good, and therefore also the Divine good which is from the Lord (see n.
9806); and by his garments is represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom
joined to His celestial kingdom (n. 9814). That by "to put on" is
signified to induce the state which is represented by the garments that
are put on, originates in the representatives in the other life. The
spirits there, and the angels, all appear clothed in garments, each one
according to the state of truth in which he is, thus each one according
to his understanding that corresponds to the will which is in him. The
reason of this is that the understanding in man clothes his will; and
the understanding is formed of truths, and the will of goods; and good
is what is clothed (n. 5248). It is from this that "garments" in the
Word signify truths (see n. 165, 1073, 4545, 4763, 5954, 6378, 6914,
6918, 9093, 9814); and that this has its origin from the representatives
in the other life, see n. 9212, 9216, 9814.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9953.">9953.</span></span>

And on his sons with him. That this signifies such a state there in the
external things proceeding therefrom, is evident from the signification
of "putting on," as being to induce a state such as is represented by
the garments (of which just above, n. 9952); here such a state as is
represented by the garments of the sons of Aaron, which is a state of
the external things that proceed from Divine truth in the spiritual
kingdom; for by "sons," and so also by their "garments," is signified
that which proceeds (according to what was said just above, n. 9950).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9954.">9954.</span></span>

And thou shalt anoint them. That this signifies a representative of the
Lord as to the good of love, is evident from the signification of
"anointing," as being inauguration to represent (see n. 9474). That it
denotes inauguration to represent the Lord as to the good of love, or
what is similar, to represent the good of love which is from the Lord,
is because by the oil wherewith the anointing was done is signified the
good of love (n. 886, 4582, 4638, 9780). It is important to know about
this, because anointing has remained in use from ancient time to the
present day; for kings are anointed; and anointing is accounted holy at
the present day in like manner as it was formerly. Among the ancients,
when all external worship was performed by means of representatives,
that is, by such things as represented the interior things of faith and
love from the Lord and to Him, thus such as are Divine, anointing was
instituted for the reason that the oil with which the anointing was
done, signified the good of love; for they knew that the good of love
was that essential thing from which all things of the church and of
worship live, because it is the being of life. For the Divine flows in
with a man through the good of love, and makes his life, indeed that
heavenly life in which truths are received in good. From this it is
plain what anointing represented. Wherefore the things which were
anointed were called holy, and were also accounted as holy, and were of
service to the church for representing Divine and heavenly things, and
in the supreme sense the Lord Himself who is good itself, thus for
representing the good of love which is from Him, and also the truth of
faith insofar as it lives from the good of love. From this then it was
that at that time they anointed stones that were set up for pillars;
also weapons of war, such as shields and bucklers; and afterward the
altar and all its vessels; likewise the Tent of meeting, and all things
therein; and moreover, those who administered the priesthood, and their
garments; likewise prophets, and lastly kings, who from this were called
"the anointed of Jehovah." It also became customary to anoint themselves
and others, in order to testify gladness of mind and goodwill. \[2\] As
regards the first point: That they anointed stones erected for pillars,
this is evident in the book of Genesis: Jacob rose up early in the
morning, and took the stone that he had placed for his pillows, and set
it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the head of it (Gen. 28:18). The
reason why they anointed stones in this manner was that "stones"
signified truths, and truths without good have no life of heaven within
them, that is, no life from the Divine. But when the stones were
anointed with oil, they represented truths from good, and in the supreme
sense the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good, thus
the Lord Himself, who from this was called "the Stone of Israel" (n.
6426). (That "stones" denote truths, see n. 643, 1298, 3720, 3769, 3771,
3773, 3789, 3798, 6426, 8941, 9476; in like manner "pillars," n. 3727,
4580, 9388, 9389; and that "to anoint pillars" denotes to cause truths
to be from good, thus to be truths of good, consequently goods, see n.
3728, 4090, 4582.) That stones erected for pillars were afterward
accounted holy, is evident from the same chapter of Genesis, where it is
said: Jacob called the name of that place Bethel, and said, If I return
in peace to my father's house, this stone, which I have set up for a
pillar, shall be God's house (Gen. 28:19-22). "Bethel" means "the house
of God," and "the house of God" denotes the church, and also heaven, and
in the supreme sense the Lord Himself (n. 3720). \[3\] Secondly: That
they anointed the weapons of war, such as shields and bucklers, is
evident in these passages: Rise up, ye Princes, anoint the shield (Isa.
21:5). The shield of the heroes was defiled, the shield of Saul not
anointed with oil (2 Sam. 1:21). The reason why weapons of war were
anointed, was that they signified truths fighting against falsities; and
truths from good are what prevail against falsities; but not truths
without good. Wherefore weapons of war represented the truths that
proceed from the good which is from the Lord, thus the truths by means
of which the Lord Himself in men fights for them against falsities from
evil, that is, against the hells. (That "weapons of war" denote truths
that fight against falsities, see n. 1788, 2686; for in the Word "war"
signifies spiritual combat, see n. 1664, 2686, 8273, 8295; and "enemies"
signify the hells, and in general, evils and falsities, n. 2851, 8289,
9314.) \[4\] Thirdly: That they anointed the altar and all its vessels,
also the Tent of meeting and all the things therein, is evident in the
following passages: Jehovah said unto Moses, Thou shalt anoint the altar
and sanctify it (Exod. 29:36). Thou shalt make an anointing oil of
holiness with which thou shalt anoint the Tent of meeting, and the ark
of the Testimony, and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the
lampstand and all the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense, and the
altar of burnt-offering and all the vessels thereof, and the laver and
the base thereof. Thus thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be holy
of holies; whosoever toucheth them shall sanctify himself (Exod.
30:25-29). Thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the Habitation,
and all that is therein, and thou shalt sanctify it, and all the vessels
thereof, that they may be holy. And thou shalt anoint the altar of
burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and thou shalt sanctify the altar,
that the altar may be holy of holies. And thou shalt anoint the laver
and its base, and shalt sanctify it (Exod. 40:9-11). Moses anointed the
Habitation and all that was therein; and he sprinkled of the oil upon
the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify
them (Lev. 8:10-12; Num. 7:1). \[5\] The reason why the altar, and the
Habitation with all things therein, were anointed, was that they might
represent the Divine and holy things of heaven and of the church,
consequently the holy things of worship; and they could not represent
these things unless they had been inaugurated by means of something that
represented the good of love; for the Divine enters through the good of
love, and through this good is present in heaven and in the church,
consequently also in worship. Without this good the Divine does not
enter, and is not present, but what is man's own, and with this, hell;
and when hell is present, evil and falsity are present; for man's own is
nothing else. From this it is evident why the anointing was done with
oil; for in the representative sense "oil" denotes the good of love (see
n. 886, 4582, 4638, 9780); and the altar was the chief representative of
the Lord, and from this of worship from the good of love (n. 2777, 2811,
4489, 4541, 8935, 8940, 9388, 9389, 9714); and the Habitation together
with the ark was the chief representative of heaven where the Lord is
(n. 9457, 9481, 9485, 9594, 9596, 9632, 9784). (That what is man's own
is nothing but evil and falsity, thus hell, see n. 210, 215, 694,
874-876, 987, 1047, 3812, 5660, 8480, 8941, 8944; also that insofar as
what is man's own is removed, so far the Lord can be present, n. 1023,
1044, 4007.) \[6\] Fourthly: That they anointed those who administered
the priesthood, and their garments, is evident in Moses: Take thou the
anointing oil, and pour it upon the head of Aaron, and anoint him (Exod.
29:7; 30:30). Thou shalt put on Aaron the holy garments; and thou shalt
anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to Me in the priest's
office; and thou shalt anoint his sons, as thou didst anoint their
father; and it shall be that their anointing shall be to them for the
priesthood of an age in their generations (Exod. 40:13-15). Moses poured
of the oil upon Aaron's head, and anointed him, to sanctify him. Then he
took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar,
and sprinkled it upon Aaron, upon his garments, upon his sons, and upon
his sons' garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his
sons, and his sons' garments with him (Lev. 8:12, 30). \[7\] The reason
why Aaron was anointed, and why his sons were anointed, and even their
garments, was that they might represent the Lord as to Divine good, and
as to the Divine truth thence derived; Aaron, the Lord as to Divine
good; and his sons, the Lord as to the Divine truth thence derived; and
in general, that the priesthood might represent the Lord as to the whole
work of salvation. The reason why they were anointed in his garments
(Exod. 29:29) was that Aaron's garments represented the Lord's spiritual
kingdom joined to His celestial kingdom. The celestial kingdom is where
the good of love to the Lord from the Lord reigns; so that the influx of
the Divine into the spiritual kingdom is effected through the good of
love. On this account the inauguration into representation was effected
with oil, which in the spiritual sense denotes the good of love. (That
Aaron represented the Lord as to Divine good may be seen above, n. 9806;
and that his sons represented the Lord as to Divine truth proceeding
from Divine good, n. 9807; also that the priesthood in general
represented the Lord as to the whole work of salvation, n. 9809; that
Aaron's garments represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom joined to His
celestial kingdom, n. 9814; that his sons' garments represented the
things which proceed therefrom, n. 9946, 9950; and that in the celestial
kingdom the good of love to the Lord reigns, see the places cited in n.
9277.) \[8\] As the inauguration into representation was effected by
anointing, and as by Aaron and his sons were represented the Lord and
that which is from Him, therefore to Aaron and his sons were given the
holy things of the sons of Israel that were given to Jehovah as gifts,
and were called "heave-offerings;" and it is said that they are an
anointing, and likewise stand for an anointing; that is, that they are a
representation, or stand for a representation, of the Lord; and that
they are from Him; as is evident from these words in Moses: The
wave-breast and the heave-shoulder have I taken from among the sons of
Israel from the sacrifices of the peace- offerings, and have given them
unto Aaron and unto his sons. This is the anointing of Aaron, and the
anointing of his sons, from the offerings of Jehovah made by fire, which
I have commanded to be given unto them in the day that he anointed them
from among the sons of Israel (Lev. 7:34-36). Jehovah spoke unto Aaron,
Behold I have given thee the charge of My heave-offerings, in respect to
all the holy things of the sons of Israel; unto thee have I given them
by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, in a statute of eternity.
Every offering of theirs, in respect to all their meat-offering, in
respect to all sacrifice for sin and for guilt, all the wave offering of
the sons of Israel, all the fat of the pure oil, and all the fat of the
new wine, and of the grain, the firstfruits of them which they shall
give unto Jehovah; to thee have I given them; also everything devoted in
Israel; everything that openeth the womb; thus all the heave-offering of
the holy things. Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither
shalt thou have any portion in the midst of them. I am thy portion and
thine inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel (Num. 18:8-20).
From these words it is evident that "anointing" denotes representation,
because they were inaugurated into representation by means of anointing;
and that by it was signified that all inauguration into the holiness of
heaven and of the church is through the good of love which is from the
Lord, and that the good of love is the Lord with them. Because it is so,
it is said that "Jehovah is his portion and inheritance." \[9\] Fifthly:
That they anointed the prophets also, is evident from the following
passages: Jehovah said unto Elijah, Anoint Hazael to be king over the
Syrians; and anoint Jehu to be king over Israel; and anoint Elisha to be
prophet in thy room (1 Kings 19:15, 16). The Spirit of the Lord Jehovih
is upon Me; therefore Jehovah hath anointed Me to preach good tiding
unto the poor; He hath sent Me to bind up the broken-hearted, to preach
liberty to the captives (Isa. 61:1). The reason why the prophets were
anointed was that they represented the Lord in respect to the doctrine
of Divine truth, consequently in respect to the Word, for this is the
doctrine of Divine truth. That the prophets represented the Word, see n.
3652, 7269, specifically Elijah and Elisha, n. 2762, 5247, 9372. And
that it is the Lord as to the Divine Human who is represented, and who
is therefore meant by "him whom Jehovah hath anointed," the Lord Himself
teaches in Luke 4:18-21. \[10\] Sixthly: That afterward they anointed
the kings, who were then called "the anointed of Jehovah," is evident
from many passages in the Word (as 1 Sam. 10:1; 15:1; 16:3, 6, 12; 24:6;
26:9, 11, 16; 2 Sam. 1:16; 2:4, 7; 5:3; 19:21; 1 Kings 1:34-35; 19:15,
16; 2 Kings 9:3; 11:12; 23:30; Lam. 4:20; Hab. 3:13; Ps. 2:2, 6; 20:6;
28:8; 45:7; 84:9; 89:20, 38, 51; 132:17; and elsewhere). The reason why
they anointed the kings was that these might represent the Lord in
respect to judgment from Divine truth; therefore in the Word by "kings"
are signified truths Divine (see n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575,
4581, 4966, 5044, 5068, 6148). \[11\] The reason why the kings were
called "the anointed of Jehovah," and why it was therefore sacrilegious
to injure them, was that by "the anointed of Jehovah" is meant the Lord
as to the Divine Human; although according to the sense of the letter
the term is applied to a king who was anointed with oil. For when the
Lord was in the world, He was, in respect to the Human, the Divine truth
itself; and in respect to the very being of His life, He was the Divine
good itself, which with man is called the soul from the father; for He
was conceived from Jehovah, and in the Word "Jehovah" denotes the Divine
good of the Divine love, which is the being of the life of all. From
this it is that the Lord alone was "the Anointed of Jehovah" in very
essence and in very performance, because the Divine good was in Him; and
the Divine truth proceeding from this good was in His Human while He was
in the world (see the places cited in n. 9194, 9315). The kings of the
earth, however, were not "the Anointed of Jehovah," but they represented
the Lord, who alone is "the Anointed of Jehovah;" and therefore on
account of this anointing it was sacrilegious to injure the kings of the
earth. But the anointing of the kings of the earth was done with oil,
while the anointing of the Lord as to the Divine Human was done with the
Divine good itself of the Divine love, which the oil represented. From
this it is that He was called "the Messiah," and "the Christ," "Messiah"
in the Hebrew tongue meaning "the Anointed," in like manner as "Christ"
in the Greek tongue (John 1:41; 4:25). \[12\] From all this it can be
seen that where mention is made in the Word of "the anointed of
Jehovah," the Lord is meant, as in Isaiah: The Spirit of the Lord
Jehovih is upon Me; therefore Jehovah hath anointed Me to preach good
tidings unto the poor; He hath sent Me to bind up the broken hearted, to
preach liberty to the captives (Isa. 61:1). That the Lord as to the
Divine Human is the one whom Jehovah anointed is evident in Luke, where
the Lord openly says so in these passages: There was delivered to Jesus
the book of the prophet Isaiah. And He unrolled the book, and found the
place where it was written, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; wherefore
He hath anointed Me to preach good tidings to the poor; He hath sent Me
to heal the broken hearted, to preach release to the bound, and sight to
the blind, to send away the wounded with deliverance, to preach the
acceptable year of the Lord. Afterward, rolling up the book, He gave it
to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were
fastened on Him. And He began to say unto them, This day hath this
Scripture been fulfilled in your ears (Luke 4:17-21). \[13\] Know
therefore and perceive, that from the going forth of the Word even to
restore and to build Jerusalem, even unto the Messiah the prince, shall
be seven weeks (Dan. 9:25). "To build Jerusalem" denotes to set up the
church, for "Jerusalem" denotes the church (n. 3654); "Messiah the
prince," or "the Anointed" denotes the Lord as to the Divine Human.
Again: Seventy weeks have been decreed, to seal up the vision and the
prophet, and to anoint the Holy of holies (Dan. 9:24). "Sealing up the
vision and the prophet" denotes to close up the things that have been
said in the Word about the Lord, and to fulfill them; "to anoint the
Holy of holies" denotes the Divine Human of the Lord, in which was the
Divine good of the Divine love, that is, Jehovah. \[14\] By "the
Anointed of Jehovah" is also meant the Lord in the following passage:
The kings of the earth have set themselves, and the rulers have
consulted together, against Jehovah, and against His Anointed. I have
anointed My king upon Zion, the mountain of My holiness (Ps. 2:2, 6).
"The kings of the earth" denote falsities, and "the rulers," evils,
which are from the hells, and against which the Lord fought when He was
in the world, and which He conquered and subdued; "the Anointed of
Jehovah" denotes the Lord as to the Divine Human, for from this He
fought; "Zion the mountain of holiness," upon which He is said "to be
Anointed as the King" denotes the celestial kingdom, which is in the
good of love. This kingdom is the inmost of heaven, and the inmost of
the church. \[15\] Again: I have found David My servant, with the oil of
holiness I have anointed him (Ps. 89:20); where by "David" is meant the
Lord (as also in other passages, see n. 1888); "the oil of holiness with
which Jehovah anointed him," denotes the Divine good of the Divine love
(see n. 886, 4582, 4638). That it is the Lord who is here meant by
"David," is plain from what precedes and from what follows in this
Psalm, for it is said: Thou spoke in vision concerning Thy Holy One, I
will set His hand in the sea, and His right hand in the rivers. He shall
call Me, My Father; I also will make Him the firstborn, high above the
kings of the earth. I will set His seed to eternity, and His throne as
the days of the heavens (Ps. 89:19, 25-27, 29); besides many other
passages. \[16\] In like manner in the same: In Zion will I make a horn
to bud unto David; I will set in order a lamp for Mine anointed. His
enemies will I clothe with shame; and upon Himself shall His crown
flourish (Ps. 132:17, 18). That here also the Lord is meant by "David,"
is plain from what precedes, where it is said: Lo, we heard of Him in
Ephrathah, we found Him in the fields of the forest. We will go into His
habitations, we will bow at His footstool. Thy priests shall be clothed
with righteousness, and Thy saints shall shout for joy. For Thy servant
David's sake turn not away the faces of Thine anointed (Ps. 89:6, 7, 9,
10). From these passages it can be seen that the Lord as to His Divine
Human is here meant by "David, the anointed of Jehovah." \[17\] In
Jeremiah: They chased us upon the mountains; they laid wait for us in
the wilderness. The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was
taken in their pits, of whom we had said, In His shadow we shall live
among the nations (Lam. 4:19, 20); where also by "the anointed of
Jehovah" is meant the Lord, for the subject here treated of is the
assault on Divine truth by falsities and evils, which is signified by
"being chased upon the mountains," and by "being laid wait for in the
wilderness;" "the breath of the nostrils" denotes the heavenly life
itself which is from the Lord (n. 9818). \[18\] From all this it can now
be known why it was so sacrilegious to injure the anointed of Jehovah,
as also is plain from the Word; as in the following passages: David
said, Jehovah forbid that I should do this word unto my lord, the
anointed of Jehovah, to put forth my hand against him, seeing that the
anointed of Jehovah is he (1 Sam. 24:6, 10). David said unto Abishai,
Destroy him not; for who shall put forth his hand against the anointed
of Jehovah and be innocent? (1 Sam. 26:9). David said unto him who said
that he had slain Saul, Thy blood be upon thy head; because thou hast
said, I have slain the anointed of Jehovah (2 Sam. 1:16). Abishai said,
Shall not Shimei be slain for this, because he cursed the anointed of
Jehovah? (2 Sam. 19:21). That Shimei was slain for this by order of
Solomon, may be seen in 1 Kings 2:36 to the end. \[19\] Seventhly: That
it had become customary to anoint themselves and others in order to
testify gladness of mind and good will, is evident from the following
passages: I, Daniel, was mourning three weeks. I ate no bread of
desires, and flesh and wine came not to my mouth, and anointing I was
not anointed, even until three weeks of days were fulfilled (Dan. 10:2,
3). Thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face; that
thou appear not to men to fast, but to thy Father in secret (Matt. 6:17,
18). "To fast" denotes to be in mourning. Again: They who drink out of
goblets of wine, and anoint themselves from the firstfruits of the oils;
but they are not grieved over the breach of Joseph (Amos 6:6). I washed
thee with waters; yea, I washed away thy blood, and I anointed thee with
oil (Ezek. 16:9); speaking of Jerusalem, by which is signified the
church. Again: Thou shalt tread the olive, but shalt not anoint thee
with oil (Micah 6:15). Thou shalt have olive trees in all thy border,
but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall be
shaken off (Deut. 28:40). To give unto them a miter for ashes, the oil
of joy for mourning (Isa. 61:3). Thy God hath anointed thee with the oil
of gladness beyond thy fellows (Ps. 45:7). Thou settest in order a table
before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou makest fat my head with
oil (Ps. 23:5). My horn shalt Thou exalt like the horn of the unicorn; I
shall grow old with fresh oil (Ps. 92:10). Wine maketh glad the heart of
man, to cheer his faces with oil (Ps. 104:15). The disciples going out
anointed with oil many that were infirm, and healed them (Mark 6:12,
13). Jesus said unto Simon, I entered into thine house, and My head with
oil thou didst not anoint; but this woman hath anointed My feet with
ointment (Luke 7:44, 46). \[20\] From all this it is evident that it was
customary to anoint themselves and others with oil; not with the oil of
holiness with which the priests, the kings, the altar, and the
tabernacle were anointed; but with common oil; for the reason that this
oil signified the gladness and satisfaction that belong to the love of
good; whereas the oil of holiness signified the Divine good, of which it
is said: Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, and in the
quality thereof ye shall not make any like it. It shall be holy to you.
Whosoever shall prepare any like it, or whosoever shall put any of it
upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his peoples (Exod. 30:32, 33,
38).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9955.">9955.</span></span>

And thou shalt fill their hand. That this signifies a representative of
the Lord as to the truth of faith, is evident from the signification of
"filling the hand" of Aaron and of his sons, as being to inaugurate into
the representation of the Lord in respect to the Divine truth which is
of faith; for by "the hand" is signified the power that belongs to truth
from good; and therefore "the hand" is predicated of truth (see n. 3091,
3387, 4931-4937, 7518, 8281, 9025). From this then it is that just as
anointing represented the Lord as to Divine good, so the filling of the
hands represented the Lord as to Divine truth; for all things in the
universe bear relation to good and truth, and to both, in order that
they may be anything; and therefore in the Word where good is treated
of, truth also is treated of (see the places cited in n. 9263, 9314). In
what manner the hands were filled, is described in the following
chapter; and therefore of the Lord's Divine mercy the meaning of it
shall be told there.

And shalt sanctify them. That this signifies thus a representative of
the Lord as to the Divine Human, is evident from the signification of
"sanctifying," as being to represent holiness itself, which is the Lord
as to the Divine Human, for it is this alone which is holy, and from
which is all holiness in the heavens and on earth. Everyone is able to
know that the oil did not sanctify; but that it induced a representative
of holiness. The case herein is this. The Lord Himself is above the
heavens, for He is the Sun of the angelic heaven. The Divine which
thence proceeds from Him in the heavens is what is called "holy." The
Divine of the Lord above the heavens could not be represented, because
it is infinite; but only the Divine of the Lord in the heavens, for this
is accommodated to the reception of the angels there, who are finite. In
their perception this Divine is the Lord's Divine Human, which alone is
holy, and which was represented. From this it is evident what is
signified by being "sanctified," and why after the anointing it was
said, as in Moses, "Thou shalt anoint the altar, and sanctify it" (Exod.
29:36); "thou shalt anoint the Tent of meeting, and all things therein,
and shalt sanctify them" (Exod. 30:26-29); "thou shalt anoint Aaron and
sanctify him" (Exod. 40:13); "Moses anointed Aaron and his garments, his
sons and their garments, and sanctified them" (Lev. 8:13, 30); besides
other passages. (That the Lord alone is holy, and that everything holy
is from Him, and that all sanctification represented Him, see n. 9229,
9680; also that the Lord in the heavens is "the sanctuary," and
therefore also heaven, n. 9479; and that the Holy Spirit is the Divine
that proceeds from the Lord, n. 9818, 9820.)

And they shall minister to him in the priest's office. That this
signifies a representative of the Lord in respect to the whole work of
salvation from the Divine Human, is evident from the signification of
"the priest's office," as being a representative of the Lord in respect
to the whole work of salvation (see n. 9809). This is said after the
sanctification by anointing, because the work of salvation is from the
Lord's Divine Human (according to what was shown just above, n. 9956).

Verses 42, 43. And thou shalt make for them breeches of linen to cover
the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they
shall be. And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they go
in unto the Tent of meeting, or when they come near unto the altar to
minister in what is holy; lest they bear iniquity, and die; it is a
statute of an age to him and to his seed after him. "And thou shalt make
for them breeches of linen," signifies what is external of conjugial
love; "to cover the flesh of their nakedness," signifies lest the
interior things of the love, which are filthy and infernal, should
appear; "from the loins even unto the thighs they shall be," signifies
their extension, that is, of the exteriors of conjugial love; "and they
shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons," signifies protection from the
hells; "when they go in unto the Tent of meeting," signifies in the
representative worship of all things of heaven and of the church; "or
when they come near unto the altar to minister in what is holy,"
signifies in the representative worship of the Lord Himself; "lest they
bear iniquity, and die," signifies the annihilation of the whole of
worship; "it is a statute of an age to him and to his seed after him,"
signifies the laws of order in the representative church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9959.">9959.</span></span>

And thou shalt make for them breeches of linen. That this signifies what
is external of conjugial love, is evident from the signification of
"breeches," as being what is external of love (of which below); and from
the signification of "linen," as being external truth, or natural truth
(of which also below). The reason why "breeches" signify what is
external of conjugial love, is that garments or coverings derive their
signification from that part of the body which they cover (see n. 9827),
and the loins together with the genitals, which are clothed or covered
by the breeches, signify conjugial love. (That "the loins" have this
signification, see n. 3021, 4280, 4575; and also "the genitals," n.
4462, 5050-5062.) What love truly conjugial is, shall be told in the
following article. \[2\] The reason why the breeches were made of linen,
was that "linen" signifies external truth, that is, natural truth (n.
7601), and the external itself is truth. The reason why the external is
truth, is that internal things cease in external ones, and rest upon
these as their supports; and supports are truths. They are like the
foundations on which a house is built; and therefore "the foundations of
a house" signify truths of faith from good (see n. 9643). Moreover,
truths are what protect goods from evils and falsities, and resist them;
and all the power which good has is by means of truths (n. 9643). From
this also it is that in the ultimate of heaven are those who are in
truths of faith from good; and therefore also the ultimate, or
outermost, with man, which is his outer skin, corresponds to those in
the heavens who are in truths of faith (n. 5552-5559, 8980); but not to
those who are in faith separate from good, for these are not in heaven.
From all this it can now be seen why the breeches were of linen. But
when Aaron was clothed in garments which were for glory and comeliness
(which have been treated of in this chapter), his breeches were of linen
with fine linen interwoven, as is evident from what follows, where it is
said: They made the tunics of fine linen, the work of the weaver, and
the miter of fine linen, and the adornments of the tiaras of fine linen,
and the breeches of linen with fine linen interwoven (Exod. 39:27, 28).
But when he was clothed in the garments of holiness, Aaron's breeches
were of linen, as is evident from these words in Moses: When Aaron shall
enter into the holiness within the veil, he shall put on the linen tunic
of holiness, and the linen breeches shall be put upon his flesh, and he
shall gird himself with the linen belt, and he shall put on himself the
linen miter; these are the garments of holiness; he shall also wash his
flesh with water when he puts them on; and he shall then first offer
burnt-offerings and sacrifices, by which he shall expiate the holiness
from uncleanesses (Lev. 16). \[3\] The reason why Aaron then went
clothed with linen garments, which were also called "garments of
holiness," was that he then administered the office of expiating the
Tent, as also the people and himself, from uncleannesses; and all
expiation, which was effected by means of washings, burnt-offerings, and
sacrifices, represented the purification of the heart from evils and
falsities, thus regeneration; and purification from evils and falsities,
or regeneration, is effected by means of the truths of faith. Therefore
there were then linen garments upon Aaron, for as before said, by "the
linen garments" were signified the truths of faith. (That all
purification from evils and falsities is effected by means of the truths
of faith, see n. 2799, 5954, 7044, 7918, 9089; thus that regeneration is
so effected, n. 1555, 2046, 2063, 2979, 3332, 3665, 3690, 3786, 3876,
3877, 4096, 4097, 5893, 6247, 8635, 8638-8640, 8772, 9088, 9089, 9103.)
\[4\] It was for the same reason that the priest put on linen clothing,
and linen breeches, when he took the ashes away from the altar (Lev.
6:10, 11); and that the priests the Levites, of the sons of Zadok, were
also to do the same when they should enter into the sanctuary, of which
we read in Ezekiel: The priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, shall
enter into My sanctuary, and shall come near to My table, to minister to
Me. When they shall enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall
put on linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, when they shall
enter in at the gates of the inner court inward. There shall be linen
tiaras upon their heads, and linen breeches shall be upon their loins;
they shall not gird themselves with sweat (Ezek. 44:15-18). The new
temple is here treated of, by which is signified the New Church; by "the
priests the Levites" are signified those who are in truths from good; by
"the linen garments" are signified the truths of faith by means of which
purification and regeneration are effected; "not to be girded with
sweat" signifies that the holy things of worship were not to be
commingled with what is man's own; for "sweat" denotes what is man's
own; and what is man's own is nothing but evil and falsity (n. 210, 215,
694, 874-876, 987, 1047, 3812, 8480, 8941). \[5\] That the breeches worn
by Aaron when he was clothed in garments for glory and comeliness were
of linen with fine linen interwoven (as is evident from the passage
cited above, Exod. 39:27, 28), was because in them Aaron represented the
Lord as to Divine good in the heavens; Aaron himself the Lord as to the
Divine celestial there; and his garments the Lord as to the Divine
spiritual there proceeding from the Divine celestial (n. 9814); and
"fine linen" denotes the Divine spiritual that proceeds from the Divine
celestial (n. 5319, 9469).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9960.">9960.</span></span>

To cover the flesh of their nakedness. That this signifies lest the
interior things of the love, which are filthy and infernal, should
appear, is evident from the signification of "covering," as being to
cause not to appear; and from the signification of "the genitals" and
"the loins," which are here meant by "the flesh of nakedness," as being
the interior things of conjugial love; for when by "breeches" are
signified the external things of this love (see n. 9959), by "the flesh"
which they cover are signified its internal things. (That "the loins"
signify conjugial love, see n. 3021, 4280, 4575; as also "the genitals,"
n. 4462, 5050-5062; and "flesh," the good of love, n. 3813, 7850, 9127.)
And as most things in the Word have also an opposite sense, so likewise
have "the loins," "the genitals," and "the flesh," in which sense they
signify the evil, filthy, and infernal things of this love (see n. 3813,
5059). That here they signify evil, filthy, and infernal things, is
evident from the fact that it is said, "to cover the flesh of their
nakedness." "The flesh of nakedness" here denotes that which is opposite
to the good of conjugial love, which is the delight of adultery, thus
what is infernal (of which in what follows). \[2\] With respect to
"nakedness," it derives its signification from the parts of the body
which appear naked, just as garments derive their signification from the
body which they clothe (n. 9827). Therefore "nakedness" has one
signification when it has reference to the head, which is baldness;
another when it has reference to the whole body; and another when it has
reference to the loins and genitals. When "nakedness" has reference to
the head, which is baldness, it signifies the loss of the intelligence
of truth and the wisdom of good; when it has reference to the whole
body, it signifies the loss of the truths of faith; but when it has
reference to the loins and the genitals, it signifies the loss of the
good of love. \[3\] As regards the first point: That when "nakedness"
has reference to the head, which is baldness, it signifies the loss of
the intelligence of truth and the wisdom of good, is evident in Isaiah:
In that day shall the Lord shave by the king of Asshur the head and the
hair of the feet, and shall consume the beard (Isa. 7:20). "To shave the
head" denotes to deprive of the internal truths of the church; "to shave
the hair of the feet," and "to consume the beard," denotes to deprive of
its external truths; "by the king of Asshur" denotes by means of
reasonings from falsities. It is plain to everyone that neither the
head, nor the hair of the feet, nor the beard, was to be shaved by the
king of Asshur, and yet that these expressions are significative. (That
"the head" denotes the interior things of wisdom and intelligence, see
n. 6292, 6436, 9166, 9656; that "the king of Asshur" denotes reasoning,
n. 119, 1186; "hair," the external truth of the church, n. 3301, 5247,
5569-5573; "the feet" also denote external or natural things, n. 2162,
3147, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952.) That "the beard" denotes sensuous
memory-knowledges, which are ultimate truths, is evident from those
passages in the Word where "the beard" is mentioned. \[4\] Again: On all
the heads is baldness, every beard is cut off (Isa. 15:2); where the
meaning is the same. Again: Baldness shall come upon Gaza; how long will
thou cut thyself? (Jer. 47:5). Shame shall be upon all faces, and
baldness upon all heads. They shall cast forth their silver into the
streets, and their gold shall be for an abomination (Ezek. 7:18, 19).
"Baldness upon all heads" denotes the loss of the intelligence of truth
and wisdom of good; and because this is signified it is also said "they
shall cast forth their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be
for an abomination;" for "silver" denotes the truth of intelligence, and
"gold" the good of wisdom (n. 1551, 5658, 6914, 6917, 8932). It is
evident that baldness upon all heads is not meant, that they were not to
cast forth their silver into the streets, and that gold was not to be an
abomination. \[5\] Again: Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and
unto Ithamar, his sons, Shave not your heads, neither rip open your
garments; lest ye die, and He be angry with the whole assembly (Lev.
10:6). The priests, the Levites, shall not shave the head, and shall not
let down their hair (Ezek. 44:20). As Aaron and his sons represented the
Lord as to Divine good and as to Divine truth (n. 9806, 9807), and as by
a "shaven head," and by "ripped garments," was signified the loss of
these, therefore it was forbidden to shave the head and to rip open
their garments; and it is said, "lest ye die, and He be angry with the
whole assembly," by which is signified that thus would perish the
representative of the Lord as to Divine good and as to Divine truth,
thus the representative of the church. \[6\] As mourning represented
spiritual mourning, which is mourning on account of the loss of the
truth and good of the church, therefore when mourning they made bald
their heads; as we read in the following passages: Men shall not lament
for them, nor shall they make themselves bald for them (Jer. 16:6). I
will turn your feasts into mourning, and I will make baldness to go up
upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for the
only-begotten (Amos 8:10). Put on baldness, and shave thee for the sons
of thy delights; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they have gone
away from thee (Micah 1:16). "Sons of delights" denote Divine truths;
their "going away" denotes the loss of these (that "sons" denote truths,
see n. 9807). \[7\] Secondly: That when "nakedness" has reference to the
whole body, it signifies the loss of the truths of faith, is evident in
John: To the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, Because thou
sayest, I am rich, and have need of nothing, and knowest not that thou
art wretched, and miserable, and needy, and blind, and naked; I counsel
thee to buy of Me gold purified in the fire, and white garments, that
thou mayest be clothed, that the shame of thy nakedness be not made
manifest (Rev. 3:14, 17, 18). "The angel of the church" denotes the
truth Divine there; "saying that it is rich" denotes that it is in the
knowledges of truth and good; "wretched, needy, blind, and naked,"
denotes that nevertheless it is devoid of truths implanted in the life,
thus is devoid of good; "buying gold purified in the fire" denotes to
procure for themselves good; "white garments" denote the genuine truths
of faith from good. From this it is evident what is meant by "the shame
of thy nakedness not being made manifest." \[8\] Again: Behold I come as
a thief, blessed is he that watcheth, and preserveth his garments, that
he walk not naked, and they see his shame (Rev. 16:15); where the
meaning is similar. Again: They shall hate the harlot, and shall make
her devastate and naked (Rev. 17:16). "The harlot" denotes those who
falsify truths Divine; "making her naked" plainly denotes depriving them
of these truths, for it is said "devastate and naked," and "to
devastate" denotes to deprive of truths. \[9\] By "nakedness" is also
signified ignorance of truth, and by "being clothed," information, in
these passages: When thou shalt see the naked, and shalt cover him, thy
light shall break forth as the dawn (Isa. 58:7, 8). The King shall say
unto them on His right hand, I was naked, and ye clothed Me; and unto
them on His left hand, I was naked, and ye clothed Me not (Matt. 25:34,
36, 41, 43). "Naked" here denotes those who are not in truths, and yet
long for truths, and also those who acknowledge that there is nothing of
good and truth in them (n. 4956, 4958). \[10\] Thirdly: That when
"nakedness" has reference to the loins and genitals, it signifies the
loss of the good of love, is evident in Isaiah: O virgin, daughter of
Babylon, take the millstone, and grind meal; uncover thy hair, make bare
thy feet, uncover the thigh, pass through the streams; thy nakedness
shall be uncovered, yea, thy reproach shall be seen (Isa. 47:1-3). The
"daughter of Babylon" denotes the church, or a semblance of the church,
where there is what is holy in externals, but what is profane in
internals. That which is profane in internals is that they regard
themselves and the world as their end, thus dominion and abundance of
wealth; and holy things as means to this end. "Taking a millstone and
grinding meal" denotes to string together doctrine from such things as
will serve for means to promote the end (n. 7780); "uncovering the hair,
making bare the feet, and uncovering the thigh" denotes to dishonor holy
things, both external and internal, without shame and fear; thus
"uncovering the nakedness" denotes to cause to appear the filthy and
infernal things which are their ends. \[11\] In Jeremiah: Jerusalem hath
sinned a sin, all that honored her despise her, because they see her
nakedness. Her uncleanness was in her skirts (Lam. 1:8, 9). "Jerusalem"
denotes the church, here the church which is in falsities from evil;
"seeing the nakedness" denotes filthy and infernal loves, "uncleanness
in the skirts" denotes such things in the extremes (that "the skirts"
denote the extremes, see n. 9917). In Nahum: I will uncover thy skirts
upon thy faces; and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the
kingdoms thy shame (Nah. 3:5). "Uncovering the skirts" denotes to take
away the externals so that the interiors appear; "the nakedness which
shall be shown to the nations, and the shame which shall be shown to the
kingdoms," denote infernal loves, which are the loves of self and of the
world, which defile the interiors. \[12\] Again: Thou camest to
ornaments of ornaments; thy breasts were made firm, and thy hair grew;
thou wast naked and bare. With all thine abominations and thy whoredoms
thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and
stripped, trampled upon in thy blood. Thy nakedness was uncovered
through thy whoredoms over thy lovers (Ezek. 16:7, 22, 36). I will give
thee into the hand of those whom thou hatest, that they may deal with
thee from hatred, and they shall leave thee naked and stripped; and the
nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered (Ezek. 23:28, 29). Contend
with your mother that she put away her whoredoms from her faces, and her
adulteries from between her breasts; lest perchance I strip her naked,
and set her according to the day that she was born, and make her as a
wilderness, and dispose of her like a land of drought, and slay her with
thirst. I will return, and take My grain, My new wine, My wool, and My
flax, which should have covered her nakedness. And I will uncover her
baseness in the eyes of her lovers (Hos. 2:2, 3, 9 ,10). \[13\] In these
passages the subject treated of is Jerusalem, which is also called
"mother," and by which is signified the church; its perversity is
described by "whoredoms, adulteries," and by "the uncovering of her
nakedness," which denote nothing else than filthy and infernal loves,
such as are the loves of self and of the world when they are ends, from
which all evils and the derivative falsities take their rise.
Consequently falsifications of truth and adulterations of good are
described in the Word by "whoredoms" and "adulteries," and are also
there called "whoredoms" and "adulteries" (n. 8904). From this it is
evident what is meant by "nakedness," and by "the uncovering of
nakedness." As the subject treated of is the truths of the church
falsified, and the goods thereof adulterated, therefore it is said, "I
will make her as a wilderness, and dispose of her like a land of
drought, and will slay her with thirst;" "a wilderness" denotes that
which is devoid of goods; "a land of drought," that which is devoid of
truths; and "thirst" denotes the loss of all things of faith. \[14\] It
is also said that He would "take away His grain, His new wine, His wool,
and His flax, with which He had covered her nakedness," because by
"grain" is signified the interior good of the spiritual church, by "new
wine" \[mustum\], the interior truth thereof, by "wool," its exterior
good, and by "flax," its exterior truth. That flax, wool, new wine, and
grain are not meant, can be seen by everyone who reads these things from
a reason in some measure enlightened, who believes that in the Word
there is no word devoid of value, and that there is nothing in it
anywhere that is not holy, because it is Divine. \[15\] Again: O
daughter of Edom, the cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt
be drunken, and shalt become naked (Lam. 4:21). Woe unto him that
causeth his neighbor to drink, making him drunken, and looking on their
nakednesses! Thou shalt be sated with shames for glory; drink thou also
that thy foreskin may be uncovered (Hab. 2:15, 16). In thee they have
shed blood, in thee hath he uncovered his father's nakedness (Ezek.
22:9, 10). No one can know what these words signify, unless he knows
what is meant by a "cup," by "drinking," by "being drunken," by "being
made naked," by "looking on nakednesses, and uncovering them," and by
"the foreskin." That all these expressions are to be spiritually
understood, is plain; spiritually, "drinking" denotes to be instructed
in truths, and in the opposite sense in falsities, thus to imbibe them
(n. 3069, 3168, 3772, 8562, 9412); from which it is evident what is
meant by a "cup," out of which men drink (n. 5120); "being drunken"
denotes to be insane from this; and "being made naked" denotes to be
made destitute of truths; "to uncover nakedness" denotes to reveal the
evils of the loves of self and of the world, which are infernal; "to
uncover a father's nakedness" denotes to reveal those evils which are
from inheritance and from the will; "to uncover the foreskin" denotes to
defile celestial goods by these loves. (That "the foreskin" denotes this
defilement, see n. 2056, 3412, 4462, 7045; consequently "circumcision"
denotes purification from these loves, n. 2036, 2632.) \[16\] From all
this it can be seen what is signified by the "drunkenness" and
consequent "uncovering of the nakedness" of Noah, as described in
Genesis: Noah drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered
in the midst of his tent. And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the
nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers. And Shem and Japheth
took a garment, and put it upon the shoulder, both of them, and went
backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces
were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness (Gen. 9:21-23).
Here is described the man of the Ancient Church, who is "Noah;" "the
wine which he drank, and with which he was made drunken," denotes the
falsity with which that church in the beginning was imbued; his
consequent lying "uncovered in the midst of his tent" signifies evils
resulting from a deficiency of truth in worship; "the garment with which
Shem and Japheth covered his nakedness," denotes the truth of faith by
means of which these evils were covered and amended; the implanting of
the truth and good of faith in the intellectual part is described by
their "laying the garment upon the shoulder, going backward, and turning
the face backward," for this is exactly the case with the truths and
goods of faith with the man of the spiritual church; "Shem and Japheth"
signify those of the spiritual church who have received the truths of
faith in good, which is charity; but "Canaan" signifies those who have
not received the truths of faith in good, that is, in charity. \[17\]
(That Noah represents the man of the Ancient Church in its beginning,
and that they were of such a character, see n. 736, 773, 788, 1126; that
Shem represents the man of the internal spiritual church, and Japheth
the man of the external spiritual church, n. 1102, 1127, 1140, 1141,
1150; that Canaan represented those who are in faith separated from
charity, or what is the same thing, in external worship separated from
internal, thus specifically the Jewish nation, see n. 1093, 1140, 1141,
1167; that with the men of the spiritual church the truth and good of
faith are implanted in the intellectual part, see n. 9596; moreover,
that "the wine with which Noah was made drunken" signifies falsity, n.
6377; "the tent" in which he lay uncovered signifies the holiness of
worship, n. 2145, 2152, 3312, 4128, 4391; "the garment" with which they
covered their father's nakedness signifies the truth of faith, n. 5954,
9212, 9216.) "The nakedness" itself signifies his evil will, which is
covered by means of the truths of faith; and while it is being covered
the truths look backward. That these arcana are involved in these
historical things is plain from the internal sense. And that these
arcana are arcana of the church, can be seen from the fact that Shem and
Japheth were blessed, and with them all their posterity, merely because
they covered their father's nakedness; and that Canaan with all his
posterity was cursed, merely because his father told this to his
brothers. \[18\] As with the Jewish and Israelitish nation the interiors
were filthy, because of their being in the loves of self and of the
world more than other nations; and because the genitals together with
the loins signify conjugial love, and this love is the fundamental love
of all celestial and spiritual loves, and thus comprehends them;
therefore a warning was given lest the nakedness of these parts with
Aaron and his sons should in any manner appear while they were in holy
worship, which is the reason why it is said that they should "make them
linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness, from the loins
even to the thighs;" and in another place, that they should "not go up
by steps upon the altar, that their nakedness be not uncovered thereon"
(Exod. 20:23). (That with the Jewish and Israelitish nation the
interiors were filthy, and that these were closed while they were in
worship, see the places cited in n. 9320e, 9380; that the genitals
together with the loins signify conjugial love, n. 3021, 4280, 4462,
4575, 5050-5062; and that conjugial love is the fundamental love of all
celestial and spiritual loves, and consequently that these loves also
are meant by conjugial love, n. 686, 2734, 3021, 4280, 5054.) From all
this it is now evident what "nakedness" signifies-especially the
nakedness of the parts assigned to generation-when the interiors are
filthy. \[19\] But when the interiors are chaste, then "nakedness"
signifies innocence, because it signifies conjugial love, for the reason
that in its essence love truly conjugial is innocence. (That love truly
conjugial belongs to innocence, see n. 2736; consequently that in this
sense "nakedness" denotes innocence, n. 165, 8375; wherefore also the
angels of the inmost heaven, who are called celestial angels, appear
naked, n. 165, 2306, 2736.) As the Most Ancient Church, which is
described in the first chapters of Genesis, and is meant in the internal
sense by the "Man," or "Adam," and by his "wife," was a celestial
church, therefore it was said of them, that "they were both naked, and
were not ashamed" (Gen. 2:25). But when that church had fallen, which
was caused by their eating of the tree of knowledge, by which was
signified reasoning from memory-knowledges about Divine things, then it
is said that "they knew that they were naked," and that "they sewed fig
leaves together and made themselves girdles," thus that they covered
their nakednesses; and that the man also said, when Jehovah called unto
him, that he "was afraid because he was naked;" and that "Jehovah then
made for them tunics of skin, and clothed them" (Gen. 3:6-11, 21).
\[20\] By "the fig leaves of which they made themselves girdles," and
also by "the tunics of skin," are meant the truths and goods of the
external man. The reason why their state after the fall is thus
described, is that from being internal men they became external; their
internal is signified by "the paradise," for "the paradise" denotes the
intelligence and wisdom of the internal man, and its being closed up is
signified by their being cast out of the paradise. (That "a leaf"
denotes natural truth, which is memory-knowledge, see n. 885; that a
"fig-tree" denotes natural good, that is, the good of the external man,
n. 217, 4231, 5113; and that a "tunic of skin" also denotes the truth
and good of the external man, n. 294-296; that "skin" denotes what is
external, n. 3540.)

From the loins even unto the thighs they shall be. That this signifies
the extension of the exterior things of conjugial love, which are
signified by "the linen breeches," is evident from the signification of
"the loins," and "the thighs," as being the things that belong to
conjugial love; "the loins," those which belong to its interiors; and
"the thighs," those which belong to its exteriors; thus its extension
from interiors to exteriors. That "the loins" signify the interior
things of this love, is because they are above; and that "the thighs"
signify its exterior things, is because they are below; for the things
with man which are above signify interior things, and those which are
below signify exterior things. From this it is that in the Word interior
things are meant by higher, and exterior by lower things (see n. 3084,
4599, 5146, 8325). With man the higher things correspond to celestial
and spiritual things, which are interior; and the lower things
correspond to natural things, which are exterior. It is from this that
"the feet" signify natural things (n. 2162, 3147, 3986, 4382,
4938-4952). And as by the thighs is meant the lower part of the loins,
which looks toward the feet, therefore the exterior or lower things of
conjugial love are signified by the thighs (n. 4277, 4280); but that in
general "the loins" signify conjugial love, see n. 3021, 3294, 4575,
5050-5062. That "the loins" have this signification is from
correspondence. (Concerning the correspondence of all things of man with
heaven, see what has been abundantly shown in the places already cited,
n. 9276, 9280.) \[2\] It is said "the extension of conjugial love from
interior things to exterior;" for in the heavens there is an extension
of all things of love and of all things of faith, or what is the same,
of all things of good and of all things of truth, for there all are
conjoined according to affinities in respect to the truths of faith and
the goods of love. There is such an extension in each heaven. This
extension reaches also into the heavens which are beneath, because all
the heavens make a one; nay, they extend even to man, so that he
likewise may make a one with the heavens. This extension is what is
meant by "the extension from higher or interior to lower or exterior
things." Higher or interior things are called celestial and spiritual,
while lower or exterior things are called natural or worldly. \[3\] As
to what specifically concerns conjugial love, the extension of which is
here described, this love is the fundamental of all loves; for it
descends from the marriage of good and truth in the heavens; and as the
marriage of good and truth is in the heavens, and makes the heavens,
therefore love truly conjugial is heaven itself with man. But the
marriage of good and truth in the heavens descends from the conjunction
of the Lord with the heavens; for that which proceeds from the Lord and
flows into the heavens is the good of love; and that which is received
there by the angels is the truth thence derived, thus is the truth which
is from good, or in which is good. For this reason the Lord is called in
the Word the "Bridegroom" and "Husband;" and heaven with the church is
called the "bride" and "wife." \[4\] From all this it can be seen how
holy marriages are in heaven, and how profane adulteries are there. For
in themselves marriages are so holy that there is nothing more holy, and
this also for the reason that they are the seminaries of the human race,
and the human race is the seminary of the heavens, for thither come the
men who in the world have lived an angelic life. And on the other hand
adulteries are so profane that there is nothing more profane, because
they are destructive of heaven and the church with man. (That this is
so, see what has been said and shown above concerning marriages and
adulteries, n. 2727-2759.) \[5\] From all this it can be seen further
why by "nakedness" are signified the filthy and infernal things spoken
of in the preceding paragraph; and why it was so strictly enjoined that
Aaron and his sons, while ministering, should be clothed with breeches,
and that otherwise they would die; for it is said, "Thou shalt make them
linen breeches to cover the flesh of their nakedness; from the loins
even unto the thighs they shall be; and they shall be upon Aaron, and
upon his sons, when they go into the Tent of meeting, or when they come
near unto the altar to minister in what is holy; lest they bear
iniquity, and die; it is a statute of an age to him and to his seed
after him." \[6\] Therefore be it known that by conjugial love is meant
all celestial and spiritual love, for the reason, as shown above, that
love truly conjugial is the fundamental of all loves. Therefore those
who are in this love are also in all other loves of heaven and of the
church, for as before said, it descends from the marriage of good and
truth in the heavens, which marriage makes heaven. From this also it is
that in the Word heaven is compared to a "marriage," and is likewise
called a "marriage." From this also it is evident why a warning was
given that the nakednesses of Aaron and of his sons should not appear
while they were ministering; for their "nakednesses" signified all loves
contrary to heavenly loves, which in general, when they are ends, are
called the loves of self and of the world, and are filthy and infernal
loves. That this is so the man of the present day is not aware, for the
reason that he is in these loves, and perceives no other delight than
that which is from them. Consequently when spiritual love and celestial
love are mentioned, he is perplexed, and does not know what they are,
consequently what heaven is; and perhaps he will be amazed when he hears
and thinks that in spiritual and celestial love, separate from the love
of self and of the world, there is eternal happiness which is
unutterable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9962.">9962.</span></span>

And they shall be upon Aaron and upon his sons. That this signifies
protection from the hells, is evident from the signification of "the
breeches," of which it is said that "they shall be upon Aaron and his
sons," as being the external things of conjugial love (see n. 9959); and
from the signification of "the nakednesses" which the breeches were to
cover, as being the interior things of this love, which were filthy and
infernal (of which also above, n. 9960); and because "nakednesses" have
this signification, therefore the breeches which were to be upon Aaron
and upon his sons, were for protection from the hells. The case herein
is as follows. In respect to their interiors, the Jewish and Israelitish
nation was in the loves of self and of the world, thus in infernal
loves, above all other nations; but in respect to their exteriors they
could be in holiness also above all other nations; wherefore when they
were in holiness, their interiors were closed; for in this way holy
external things could be communicated through them with the heavens, and
from this there could be conjunction. It would have been altogether
different if the internals with them, which as above said were filthy
and infernal, had not been closed. It is from this that with that nation
there was no church, but only the representative of a church; for a
church which is a church is in the internal things of faith and of love;
but not in external things separate from these. The external things with
them were all representative. \[2\] As then by "breeches" are signified
the external things of conjugial love, and in general the external
things of all heavenly loves; and as external things were what covered
the internal things, and as with that nation the internal things were
filthy and infernal, therefore by "the breeches being upon Aaron and
upon his sons" is signified protection from the hells; for so long as
they were in a holy external, and their internals were covered or
closed, so long also they were removed from the hells, and were thereby
under protection. (That the internals with the Jewish and Israelitish
nation were filthy and infernal, and that on this account there was no
church with them, but only the representative of a church, may be seen
at the places cited in n. 9320, 9380; that while they were in worship,
they were only in a holy external, n. 3479, 4293, 4311, 6304, 8588,
9373, 9380; and that their interiors were then closed, n. 8788, 8806.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="9963.">9963.</span></span>

When they go in into the Tent of meeting. That this signifies in the
representative worship of all things of heaven and of the church, is
evident from the signification of "going in into the Tent of meeting,"
as being the representative worship of all things of heaven and of the
church; for by "the Tent" was represented heaven where the Lord is (see
n. 9457, 9481, 9485, 9784); thus by "going into it," when said of Aaron
and his sons, is signified the worship of the Lord. Moreover, at that
time all worship was performed in the Tent and at the altar; for in the
Tent were set in order the breads of faces, the lamps were lighted,
incense was burned, and sacrifices were offered at the altar. In these
things the representative worship chiefly consisted. Representative
worship is external worship that represents the internal things which
belong to love from the Lord to the Lord, thus which are all things of
heaven and of the church; for in heaven and in the church all things
bear relation to the good that is of love, and to the truth that is of
faith, from the Lord to the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9964.">9964.</span></span>

Or when they come near unto the altar to minister in what is holy. That
this signifies in the representative worship of the Lord Himself, is
evident from the fact that the altar was the chief representative of the
Lord in respect to the Divine good (see n. 9714); thus "coming near unto
the altar, and ministering there in what is holy" denotes the worship of
the Lord Himself. The representative worship of the Lord consisted
chiefly in burnt-offerings and sacrifices offered upon the altar (n.
922, 923, 2180, 6905, 8680, 8936); the representative worship of the
Lord in respect to Divine good was at the altar, and the representative
worship of Him in respect to Divine truth was in the Tent of meeting.
Therefore it is said that by "going in into the Tent of meeting" is
signified the representative worship of all things of heaven and of the
church (n. 9963); and by "coming near unto the altar" is signified the
representative worship of the Lord Himself; for heaven and the church
are receptacles of the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord. The
Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord is the truth that proceeds from
the good of His love, and it is implanted where this good also is
received, consequently where the Lord is received, from whom is this
good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9965.">9965.</span></span>

Lest they bear iniquity, and die. That this signifies the annihilation
of the whole of worship, is evident from the signification of "bearing
iniquity," when said of the priesthood of Aaron and his sons, as being
the removal of falsities and evils with those who are in good from the
Lord (of which above, n. 9937). But when they are said "to bear iniquity
and die," it signifies the annihilation of all worship (n. 9928); for
representative worship died, because nothing of it appeared any longer
in the heavens. (How the case herein is can be seen from what was said
and shown above, n. 9959-9961.) Moreover, that they died when they did
not act in accordance with the statutes, is plain from Aaron's sons,
Nadab and Abihu, who were consumed by fire from heaven when they burned
incense, not from the fire of the altar, but from strange fire (Lev.
10:1, 2). The fire of the altar represented love Divine, thus love from
the Lord, whereas the strange fire represented love from hell. The
annihilation of worship was signified by the burning of incense from
this latter fire, which resulted in their death. (That "fires" signify
loves, see n. 5215, 6832, 7324, 7575, 7852.) \[2\] It is said in many
passages in the Word that "they would bear iniquity" when they did not
act according to the statutes, and by this was signified damnation,
because their sins were not removed; not that they were damned on this
account, but that they thereby annihilated the representative worship,
and thus represented the damned who remain in their sins. For no one is
damned on account of the omission of external rites; but on account of
evils of the heart, thus on account of the omission of them from evil of
heart. This is signified by "bearing iniquity" in the following
passages. In Moses: If a soul shall sin, and shall do any of the things
commanded by Jehovah not be done; though he knew it not, yet shall he be
guilty, and shall hear his iniquity (Lev. 5:17). "To bear iniquity" here
does not mean, but only signifies, the retention of evils and thus
damnation, because he did not do it from evil of heart; for it is said,
"though he knew it not." \[3\] Again: If eating any of the flesh of the
sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten on the third day, he that
offereth it shall not be reconciled; it is an abomination, and the soul
which eateth of it shall bear his iniquity, and shall be cut off from
his peoples (Lev. 7:18, 20; 19:7, 8); by "bearing iniquity" here also is
signified to remain in his sins, and thus to be in damnation; not
because he ate of his sacrifice on the third day; but because by "eating
it on the third day" was represented that which is abominable, which is
amenable to damnation. Thus by "bearing iniquity" and by "being cut off
from his people," was represented the damnation of those who do the
abomination which is signified by that deed. Nevertheless the damnation
was not on account of the eating, for it is the interior evils which
were represented that condemn, and not the outward things without them.
\[4\] Again: Every soul that eateth a carcass, and that which is torn,
and laveth not his garments, nor washeth his flesh, shall bear his
iniquity (Lev. 17:15, 16); as "to eat a carcass and that which is torn"
represented the appropriation of evil and falsity, therefore he is said
to "bear iniquity," also representatively. Again: If a man who is clean
shall omit to keep the passover, this soul shall be cut off from his
peoples, because he offered not the oblation of Jehovah in its appointed
time, he shall bear his sin (Num. 9:13); the passover represented
liberation from damnation by the Lord (see n. 7093, 7867, 7995,
9286-9292); and the paschal supper represented conjunction with the Lord
through the good of love (n. 7836, 7997, 8001); and because these things
were represented, it was ordained that anyone who did not keep the
passover should be cut off from his people, and that he should bear his
sin. Yet this was not so very bad a deed; but only represented those who
at heart deny the Lord, and the consequent liberation from sins; and
thus it represented those who do not wish to be conjoined with Him by
love; thus it represented their damnation. \[5\] Again: The sons of
Israel shall not come nigh the Tent of meeting, to bear iniquity in
dying. The Levites shall do the work of the Tent of meeting, and they
shall bear iniquity (Num. 18:22, 23); the reason why the people "bore
iniquity in dying" if they came nigh the Tent of meeting to do the work
there, was that they thus annihilated the representative worship
enjoined on the ministry of the priests; the ministry of the priests, or
the priesthood, represented the whole work of the Lord's salvation (n.
9809). Therefore it is said that "the Levites," who also were priests,
should "bear their iniquity," by which was signified expiation, that is,
the removal from evils and falsities with those who are in good from the
Lord alone (n. 9937). By "bearing iniquity" is signified real damnation
when it is said of those who do evils from an evil heart, as is said of
those described in Leviticus 20:17, 19, 20; 24:15, 16; Ezekiel 18:20;
23:49; and elsewhere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9966.">9966.</span></span>

It is a statute of an age to him and to his seed after him. That this
signifies the laws of order in the representative church, is evident
from the signification of "a statute of an age," as being a law of
Divine order in the heavens and in the church (see n. 7884, 7995, 8357).
It is said "in the representative church," because the external things
of worship which represented internal things were called "statutes" (n.
8972), thus those things which were representatives of the church; and
because the internal things which were represented were Divine, thus
eternal, therefore it is said, "a statute of an age;" for by "an age" is
signified what is eternal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9967.">9967.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE SECOND EARTH SEEN IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. I was afterward
led by the Lord to an earth in the universe which was at a greater
distance from our earth than that first one which was treated of at the
end of some of the former chapters. That it was further distant was
given me to know from the fact that I was two days being led thither as
to my spirit. This earth was to the left; but the former was to the
right. Remoteness in the other life does not arise from distance of
place; but from difference of state, which nevertheless appears there
like distance of place (according to what was said above, n. 9440).
Wherefore from the time it took to get there, which as already said was
two days, I was able to infer that the state of the interiors with those
people - which is the state of the affections and the consequent
thoughts - differed from the state of the interiors with the spirits
from our earth in the same proportion. As I was conveyed thither in
respect to the spirit by means of changes of state of the interiors, it
was given me to note the successive changes themselves, before I arrived
there. This took place while I was awake.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9968.">9968.</span></span>

When I arrived there, the earth itself was not seen, but only the
spirits from that earth; for as has already been observed several times,
the spirits of every earth appear around their own earth, for the reason
that they are of a diverse genius in consequence of a diverse state of
life; and in the other life diversity of state disjoins, and likeness of
state conjoins; and especially for the reason that they may be with the
inhabitants of their own earth, who are of a similar genius. For a man
cannot live apart from spirits, and spirits of a like nature are
adjoined to everyone (see n. 5846-5866, 5976-5993). These spirits
appeared at a considerable height above the head, and from thence they
looked at me as I was coming. \[2\] Be it known that those who are on
high can look at those who are below; and the greater their height, the
farther their view extends; and that they can not only look at them, but
can also speak with them. From their position they observed that I was
not from their earth, but from a greater distance elsewhere; wherefore
they addressed to me a variety of questions, to which it was also given
me to reply. Among other things I told them from what earth I was, and
what was its nature. Afterward I told them about the earths in our solar
system, and at the same time also about the spirits of the earth or
planet Mercury, to whom it is given to wander about to many earths for
the sake of acquiring knowledges about various things, with which they
are delighted (n. 6808-6817, 6921-6932, 7069-7079). When they heard
this, they said that they also had seen these spirits among them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9969.">9969.</span></span>

I was told by angels from our earth that the inhabitants and spirits of
this "second" earth bear relation in the Grand Man to the keenness of
the external sight; and that on this account they appear on high, and
are also remarkably keen of sight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9970.">9970.</span></span>

Because they bear this relation in the Grand Man, which is heaven, and
as they clearly see the things which are below, in conversing with them
I compared them to eagles, which fly to a great height, and look around
with a sharp and far-reaching vision. But at this they were indignant,
supposing that I believed them to be like eagles in respect to rapacity,
and thus that they were evil. But I replied that I did not liken them to
eagles in respect to rapacity, but in respect to their keenness of
sight; adding that they who are like eagles in respect to rapacity are
evil, but that they who are like them only in keenness of sight are
good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9971.">9971.</span></span>

Being questioned about the God whom they worship, they answered that
they worship a visible and an invisible God; a visible God under a human
form, and an invisible God not under any form. And it was found from
their speech, and also from the ideas of their thought when communicated
to me, that their visible God is our Lord Himself, and they also called
Him "the Lord." To all this it was given me to reply that on our earth
also a visible and an invisible God is worshiped, and that the invisible
God is called "the Father;" and the visible God, "the Lord;" but that
the two are One, as He Himself taught us, saying, that "no one hath ever
seen the shape of the Father," but that "the Father and He are One,"
that "whosoever seeth Him, seeth the Father," that "the Father is in
Him, and He in the Father;" consequently that both are this Divine in
one person. (That these are the words of the Lord Himself, see John
5:37; 10:30; 14:7, 9-11.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="9972.">9972.</span></span>

Afterward I saw spirits from the same earth in a place beneath the
former, and I spoke with these also. But these were idolaters, for they
worshiped an idol of stone like a man, but not beautiful. Be it known
that at first all who come into the other life have a worship like their
worship in the world, but that they are gradually removed from it. The
reason of this is that all worship remains implanted in the interior
life of the man, from which it cannot be removed and rooted out except
gradually. Upon seeing this, it was given me to tell them that they
ought not to worship what is dead, but what is alive. To this they
answered that they know that God is alive, and is not a stone; but they
think of the living God when they look upon a stone that is like a man,
and that otherwise the ideas of their thought could not be fixed and
determined to the invisible God. It was then given me to tell them that
the ideas of thought can be fixed and determined to the invisible God,
by fixing and determining them to the Lord, who is the visible God; and
that in this way a man can be conjoined with the invisible God in
thought and affection, and consequently in faith and love, when he is
conjoined with the Lord; but not otherwise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9973.">9973.</span></span>

A continuation concerning this Second Earth in the starry heaven will be
found at the end of the following chapter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9974.">9974.</span></span>

CHAPTER THE TWENTY-NINTH. THE DOCTRINE OF CHARITY AND FAITH <span
id="fr_219"></span>[9974-1](#fn_219.md) 9974. Those who believe that they
merit heaven by the goods which they do, do goods from themselves, and
not from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9975.">9975.</span></span>

None of the goods which men do from themselves are good, because they
are done for the sake of self, being done for the sake of reward; thus
from these works they have regard in the first place to themselves; but
the goods which men do from the Lord are all good, because they are done
for the sake of the Lord and for the sake of the neighbor; thus in these
goods they have regard in the first place to the Lord and the neighbor.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9976.">9976.</span></span>

Therefore those who place merit in works love themselves, and those who
love themselves despise the neighbor, and even are angry with God
Himself if they do not receive the hoped-for reward, for they do the
works for the sake of the reward.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9977.">9977.</span></span>

From this it is evident that their works are not from heavenly love,
thus not from true faith; for the faith which regards good from self,
and not from God, is not true faith. Such cannot receive heaven into
themselves, for heaven with man is from heavenly love and true faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9978.">9978.</span></span>

Those who place merit in works cannot fight against the evils which are
from the hells, for no one can do this from himself; but the Lord fights
and conquers for those who do not place merit in works.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9979.">9979.</span></span>

The Lord alone had merit, because He alone, from Himself, has conquered
and subdued the hells. Hence the Lord alone is merit and righteousness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9980.">9980.</span></span>

Moreover, from himself man is nothing but evil; thus to do good from
self is to do it from evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9981.">9981.</span></span>

That good must not be done for the sake of a reward, the Lord Himself
teaches in Luke: If ye love those who love you, what thanks have ye? If
ye do well to those who do well to you, what thanks have ye? For sinners
do the same. Rather love your enemies, and do well, and lend, hoping for
nothing; then shall your reward be great, and ye shall be sons of the
Most High (Luke 6:32-35). That a man cannot from himself do good that is
good; but only from the Lord, the Lord also teaches in John: A man can
receive nothing unless it be given him from heaven (John 3:27). Jesus
said, I am the vine, ye are the branches; he that abideth in Me, and I
in him, the same beareth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing
(John 15:5).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9982.">9982.</span></span>

To believe that they will be rewarded if they do what is good, is not
hurtful to those who are in innocence, as is the case with little
children and with the simple; but to confirm themselves therein when
they are grown up is hurtful; for a man is initiated into good by
looking for a reward, and he is deterred from evil by looking for a
punishment. But insofar as he comes into the good of love and of faith,
he is removed from having regard to merit in the goods which he does.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9983.">9983.</span></span>

To do good that is good must be from the love of good, thus for the sake
of good. They who are in this love abhor merit, for they love to do, and
perceive satisfaction from it; and on the other hand, they are saddened
if it is believed that it is done for the sake of something of self. The
case herein is almost as it is with those who do what is good to friends
for the sake of friendship, to a brother for the sake of brotherhood, to
wife and children for their own sake, to their country for their
country's sake; thus from friendship and from love. They who think well
also say and insist that they do not do well for the sake of themselves;
but for the sake of those to whom they do it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9984.">9984.</span></span>

The delight itself which is in the love of doing what is good without
any end of recompense, is the reward which remains to eternity; for
every affection of love remains inscribed on the life. Into this there
is insinuated by the Lord heaven and eternal happiness. EXODUS 29 1. And
this is the word that thou shalt do to them, to sanctify them, to
minister to Me in the priest's office. Take one bullock, a son of the
herd, and two rams without blemish; 2. And bread of unleavened things,
and cakes of unleavened things mixed with oil, and wafers of unleavened
things anointed with oil; of fine flour of wheat shalt thou make them.
3. And thou shalt put them upon one basket, and bring them near in the
basket, and the bullock and the two rams. 4. And Aaron and his sons thou
shalt bring near unto the door of the Tent of meeting, and shalt wash
them with waters. 5. And thou shalt take the garments, and shalt clothe
Aaron with the tunic, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the
breastplate, and gird him with the girdle of the ephod. 6. And thou
shalt set the miter upon his head, and put the crown of holiness upon
the miter. 7. And thou shalt take the oil of anointing, and pour it upon
his head, and anoint him. 8. And thou shalt bring near his sons, and
clothe them with tunics. 9. And thou shalt gird them with a belt, Aaron
and his sons, and shalt bind the tiaras on them, and the priesthood
shall be to them for a statute of an age; and thou shalt fill the hand
of Aaron and the hand of his sons. 10. And thou shalt bring near the
bullock before the Tent of meeting; and Aaron and his sons shall lay
their hands upon the head of the bullock. 11. And thou shalt slay the
bullock before Jehovah, at the door of the Tent of meeting. 12. And thou
shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and shalt put it upon the horns
of the altar with thy finger; and all the blood thou shalt pour out at
the base of the altar. 13. And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth
the intestines, and the caul upon the liver, and the two kidneys, and
the fat that is upon them, and shalt burn them on the altar. 14. And the
flesh of the bullock, and its skin, and its dung, shalt thou burn with
fire without the camp; this is sin. 15. And thou shalt take one ram; and
Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. 16.
And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take its blood, and sprinkle
it upon the altar round about. 17. And thou shalt cut the ram into its
pieces, and shalt wash its intestines, and its legs, and put them upon
its pieces, and upon its head. 18. And thou shalt burn with the whole
ram upon the altar; this is a burnt-offering unto Jehovah; an odor of
rest; an offering made by fire unto Jehovah is this. 19. And thou shalt
take the second ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon
the head of the ram. 20. And thou shalt slay the ram, and shalt take of
its blood, and shalt put it upon the lap of the ear of Aaron, and upon
the lap of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right
hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and thou shalt
sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 21. And thou shalt take
of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the oil of anointing, and
shalt sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons,
and upon the garments of his sons with him; and he shall be holy, and
his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him. 22.
And thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the tail, and the fat that
covereth the intestines, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys,
and the fat that is upon them, and the right hind quarter; because a ram
of fillings is he; 23. And one loaf of bread, and one cake of bread with
oil, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened things that is
before Jehovah; 24. And thou shalt put the whole upon the palms of
Aaron, and upon the palms of his sons; and shalt wave them a wave
offering before Jehovah. 25. And thou shalt take them from their hand,
and shalt burn them on the altar upon the burnt-offering, for an odor of
rest before Jehovah; an offering by fire is this to Jehovah. 26. And
thou shalt take the breast from the ram of fillings, which is for Aaron,
and shalt wave it a wave-offering before Jehovah; and it shall be to
thee for a portion. 27. And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the
waving, and the hind quarter of the uplifting, which is waved, and which
is uplifted from the ram of fillings, of that which is for Aaron, and of
that which is for his sons; 28. And it shall be to Aaron and his sons
for a statute of an age from among the sons of Israel; for it is an
uplifting; and it shall be an uplifting from among the sons of Israel of
their peace sacrifices, their uplifting to Jehovah. 29. And the garments
of holiness which are for Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be
anointed in them, and to fill in them their hand. 30. Seven days shall
the priest after him of his sons put them on, who shall enter into the
Tent of meeting to minister in the holy. 31. And thou shalt take the ram
of fillings, and boil its flesh in a holy place. 32. And Aaron and his
sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the
basket, at the door of the Tent of meeting. 33. And they shall eat those
things wherein expiation was made, to fill their hand, to sanctify them;
and a stranger shall not eat, because they are holy. 34. And if there be
anything left of the flesh of fillings, and of the bread, unto the
morning, thou shalt burn what is left with fire; it shall not be eaten,
because it is holy. 35. And thus shalt thou do to Aaron and to his sons,
according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days shalt thou fill
their hand. 36. And a bullock of sin thou shalt offer daily upon the
propitiations; and thou shalt cleanse it from sin upon the altar in
making thy propitiation upon it; and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify
it. 37. Seven days thou shalt make propitiation upon the altar, and
shalt sanctify it, and the altar shall be a holy of holies; everyone
that toucheth the altar shall be sanctified. 38. And this is what thou
shalt offer upon the altar: two lambs, sons of a year, day by day,
continually. 39. The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the
other lamb thou shalt offer between the evenings; 40. And a tenth of
fine flour mingled with beaten oil, a fourth of a hin, and a
drink-offering of the fourth of a hin of wine for the first lamb. 41.
And the second lamb thou shalt offer between the evenings; according to
the meat-offering of the morning, and according to the drink-offering
thereof, thou shalt do thereto, for an odor of rest, a fire-offering to
Jehovah: 42. A continual burnt-offering to your generations at the door
of the Tent of meeting before Jehovah; where I will meet with you, to
speak unto thee there. 43. And there I will meet with the sons of
Israel, and it shall be sanctified in My glory. 44. And I will sanctify
the Tent of meeting, and the altar; and Aaron and his sons will I
sanctify to minister to Me in the priest's office. 45. And I will dwell
in the midst of the sons of Israel, and will be to them for God. 46. And
they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who have brought them out
from the land of Egypt, that I may dwell in the midst of them; I am
Jehovah their God.

THE CONTENTS. In the internal sense in this chapter the subject treated
of is the glorification of the Lord in respect to the Human, which is
signified by the inauguration of Aaron and his sons into the priesthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9986.">9986.</span></span>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verses 1-3. And this is the word that thou shalt do
to them to sanctify them, to minister to Me in the priest's office. Take
one bullock, a son of the herd, and two rams without blemish; and bread
of unleavened things, and cakes of unleavened things mixed with oil, and
wafers of unleavened things anointed with oil; of fine flour of wheat
shalt thou make them. And thou shalt put them upon one basket, and bring
them near in the basket; and the bullock and the two rams. "And this is
the word that thou shalt do to them," signifies a law of order; "to
sanctify them," signifies a representation of the Lord in respect to the
Divine Human; "to minister to Me in the priest's office," signifies to
represent all the work of salvation by Him; "take one bullock a son of
the herd," signifies the purification of the natural or external man;
"and two rams without blemish," signifies the purification of the
spiritual or internal man; "and bread of unleavened things," signifies
the purification of the celestial in the inmost of man; "and cakes of
unleavened things mixed with oil," signifies the purification of the
middle celestial; "and wafers of unleavened things anointed with oil,"
signifies the celestial in the external man; "of fine flour of wheat
shalt thou make them," signifies the truth which is from Divine good;
"and thou shalt put them upon one basket," signifies the sensuous in
which they are; "and bring them near in the basket," signifies thus the
presence of all; "and the bullock and the two rams," signifies the
natural or external of man, and his spiritual or internal, which are to
be purified.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9987.">9987.</span></span>

And this is the word that thou shalt do to them. That this signifies a
law of order, is evident from the signification of a "word," as being
Divine truth, and hence a law of order (of which below). In the general
sense a "word" signifies an utterance of the mouth, or a speech; and as
a speech is a thought of the mind uttered by means of words, therefore a
"word" signifies the thing that is being thought; and from this, in the
original tongue, everything that really exists, and is anything, is
called a "word." But in an eminent sense the "Word" is Divine truth, for
the reason that everything which really exists, and which is anything,
is from Divine truth. Therefore it is said in David: By the word of
Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the army of them by the breath of
His mouth (Ps. 33:6); where "the word of Jehovah" denotes the Divine
truth that proceeds from the Lord; "the breath of the mouth of Jehovah"
denotes the life thence derived; "the heavens made by it, and all the
army of them," denote the angels insofar as they are receptions of
Divine truth. That "the heavens" denote the angels is because these
constitute heaven; and as the angels are receptions of Divine truth,
therefore by "angels" in the abstract sense are signified Divine truths
which are from the Lord (see n. 8192); and that in the same sense "the
army of the heavens" denotes Divine truths (see n. 3448, 7236, 7988).
\[2\] From this it can be seen what is signified by "the Word" in John:
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was
the Word. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything
made that was made. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us, and we
saw His glory (John 1:1, 3, 14). That the Lord is here meant by "the
Word" is plain, for it is said that "the Word was made flesh." The Lord
is "the Word," because when He was in the world, the Lord was Divine
truth itself; and when He departed out of the world, the Divine truth
proceeded from Him (see the places cited in n. 9199, 9315). \[3\] That
in the supreme sense "the Word" denotes the Lord as to Divine truth, or
what is the same, that "the Word" denotes the Divine truth proceeding
from the Lord, is evident from many passages, as in the following: They
cried unto Jehovah, and He sent His Word, and healed them (Ps. 107:19,
20). Ye have not the Word of the Father abiding in you, because whom He
hath sent, Him ye believe not, and ye will not come to Me, that ye may
have life (John 5:38, 40). I have given them Thy word, therefore the
world hateth them, sanctify them in Thy truth; Thy word is truth (John
17:14, 17). He that sat on the white horse was clothed in a garment
dipped in blood, and His name is called the Word of God. And He had upon
His garment and upon His thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord
of lords (Rev. 19:13, 16). From these and other passages it is evident
that the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is "the Word," and in the
supreme sense the Lord as to Divine truth, for it is said that "the name
of Him who sat on the white horse is the Word of God," and that "He is
King of kings and Lord of lords;" and as "the Word" denotes Divine
truth, it is said that "He was clothed in a garment dipped in blood,"
for by "garment" is signified truth (n. 9952), and by "blood" truth from
good. (See this more fully explained in n. 2760-2762.) \[4\] Hence all
truth which is from the Divine is called the "word," as in Joel: Jehovah
uttered His voice before His army; for His camp is very great, for
countless is he that doeth His word (Joel 2:11); where the "voice which
Jehovah utters" denotes truth from the Divine (n. 9926); the "camp of
Jehovah" denotes heaven (see n. 4236, 8193, 8196). From this it is
evident that "countless is he that doeth His word" denotes one who does
truth Divine. In Matthew: When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom,
and heedeth it not, the evil one cometh and snatcheth away that which
was sown in his heart. He that was sown upon stony places, is he that
heareth the word and straightway with joy receiveth it; yet hath he not
root. He that was sown among thorns, is he that heareth the word, but
the care of the age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word. He
that was sown in good ground, is he that heareth the word and payeth
attention, and from this bringeth forth fruit (Matt. 13:19-23). That
"the word" here denotes truth Divine is evident without explication. It
is said "the word of the kingdom," because it is the truth of heaven and
the church, for "the kingdom" denotes heaven and the church. \[5\] From
this it can be seen that "words" denote Divine truths which are from the
Lord; as in John: The words that I speak unto you, are spirit and are
life (John 6:63). Therefore also the commandments of the Decalogue are
called the "ten words" (Exod. 34:28). That "the word" denotes a law of
order, is because the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord makes
order in the heavens, insomuch that it is order there. Hence the laws of
heavenly order are Divine truths (n 1728, 1919, 2258, 2447, 4839, 5703,
7995, 8513, 8700, 8988). The law of order which is signified by "word"
in this chapter is the way in which the Lord glorified His Human, that
is, made it Divine, for this is the subject here treated of in the
internal sense; and from this in the relative sense the regeneration of
man is treated of, for the regeneration of man is an image of the
glorification of the Lord (n. 3138, 3212, 3245, 3246, 3296, 4402, 5688).
That this is the law of order in especial, is because the Lord as to the
Divine Human is Order in the heavens, and because everyone who is being
regenerated is brought into this order; wherefore they who are in this
order are in the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9988.">9988.</span></span>

To sanctify them. That this signifies to represent the Lord in respect
to the Divine Human, is evident from the signification of "to sanctify,"
as being to represent the Lord as to the Divine Human (see n. 9956).
That this is "to sanctify" is because the Lord alone is holy, and
because all that is holy proceeds from Him, and all sanctification
represents Him (n. 9479, 9680, 9820).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9989.">9989.</span></span>

To minister to Me in the priest's office. That this signifies all the
work of salvation by Him, is evident from the signification of "the
priest's office," as being a representative of the Lord as to the work
of salvation (see n. 9899).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9990.">9990.</span></span>

Take one bullock, a son of the herd. That this signifies the
purification of the natural or external man, is evident from the
signification of a "bullock," as being the good of innocence and of
charity in the natural or external man (see n. 9391). And because it is
said "a son of the herd," there is signified also the truth of this
good, for a "son" denotes truth, and a "herd," the natural. (That a
"son" denotes truth, see n. 489, 491, 533, 2623, 3373, 9807; and that a
"herd" denotes the natural, n. 2566, 5913, 8937.) That by a "bullock, a
son of the herd" is here signified the purification of the natural or
external man, is because it was sacrificed, and by sacrifices was
signified purification from evils and falsities, or expiation, here
purification from the evils and falsities which are in the natural or
external man. But purification in the spiritual or internal man is
signified by the "burnt-offering of the ram." \[2\] In order to know
what the burnt-offerings and sacrifices severally represented, it must
be known that there is in man an external and also an internal, and that
in each of these there is what relates to truth and what relates to
good; and therefore when a man is to be regenerated, he must be
regenerated as to the external and as to the internal, and in both as to
truth and as to good. But before a man can be regenerated, he must be
purified from evils and falsities, for these stand in the way. The
purifications of the external man were represented by burnt-offerings
and sacrifices of oxen, bullocks, and he-goats; and the purifications of
the internal man by burnt-offerings and sacrifices of rams, kids, and
she-goats; but the purification of the internal itself, which is the
inmost, by burnt-offerings and sacrifices of lambs; and therefore what
particular purification or expiation was represented can be seen from
the animals themselves that were sacrificed. \[3\] It is said what
purification or expiation was "represented," because the burnt-offerings
and sacrifices did not purify or expiate man, but only represented
purification or expiation; for who is not able to know that such things
do not take away anything of the evil and falsity with a man? (See the
passages cited from the Word in n. 2180.) That they did not take away,
but only represented, was because with the Israelitish and Jewish nation
there was instituted the representative of a church, through which
conjunction was effected with the heavens, and through the heavens with
the Lord (on which subject see what was shown in the places cited above,
n. 9320 end, 9380). But what was specifically represented by the
burnt-offerings and sacrifices of bullocks, rams, and lambs, will be
seen later in this chapter, for these are there treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9991.">9991.</span></span>

And two rams without blemish. That this signifies the purification of
the spiritual or internal man, is evident from the signification of a
"ram," as being the internal of man, thus his spiritual (see n. 2830);
for the internal with man is called "spiritual;" and the external
"natural." Purification is signified because the burnt-offerings were of
rams, and by burnt-offerings and sacrifices in general were represented
purifications from evils and falsities, or expiations; and by
burnt-offerings and sacrifices of rams, the purifications or expiations
of the internal or spiritual man (of which below in this chapter where
these are treated of).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9992.">9992.</span></span>

And bread of unleavened things. That this signifies the purification of
the celestial in the inmost of man, is evident from the signification of
"bread," as being what is celestial (see n. 2165, 2177, 3478, 9545); and
from the signification of "unleavened," as being what has been purified
(of which below). That it denotes the inmost of man, is because the
celestial is the good of love, and the good of love is inmost. There are
three things with man which follow on in successive order. These three
are called "the celestial," "the spiritual," and "the natural." The
celestial is the good of love to the Lord; the spiritual is the good of
charity toward the neighbor; and the natural thence derived is the good
of faith, which, being from the spiritual, is called "the spiritual
natural." For the case with man is similar to what it is in the heavens.
In the inmost heaven, which is also called the third, is the celestial;
in the second or middle heaven is the spiritual; and in the first or
ultimate heaven is the natural thence derived, or the spiritual natural.
That the case with man is similar to what it is in the heavens, is
because a man who is in good is a heaven in the least form (see the
places cited in n. 9279). Concerning the threefold division of heaven or
of the heavenly kingdom, more will be told below when treating of the
cakes and wafers of fine flour of wheat. \[2\] That "unleavened"
signifies purified, is because "fermented" signifies falsity from evil
(n. 2342, 7906); hence "unleavened" or "unfermented" signifies pure, or
without this falsity. That "fermented" signifies falsity from evil, is
because this falsity defiles good, and also truth, and also because it
excites fighting; for on the approach of this falsity to good a burning
heat is excited, and on its approach to truth, collision. For this
reason a meat-offering of unleavened bread was employed in the
burnt-offerings and in the sacrifices. Therefore it was ordered that "no
meat-offering which they should bring to Jehovah should be made
leavened" (Lev. 2:11); that they "should not sacrifice the blood of the
sacrifice upon what was leavened" (Exod. 23:18); and that on the feast
of the passover, they "should eat nothing leavened," and that he who did
eat "should be cut off from Israel" (Exod. 12:15, 18-20). That he was to
be cut off from Israel who ate what was leavened on the feast of the
passover, was because the feast of the passover signified liberation
from damnation, and specifically liberation from falsities from evil,
with those who suffer themselves to be regenerated by the Lord (see n.
7093, 9286-9292); hence also this feast was called "the feast of
unleavened things."

<span class="margnote"><span id="9993.">9993.</span></span>

And cakes of unleavened things mixed with oil. That this signifies the
purification of the middle celestial, is evident from the signification
of "cakes," as being the middle celestial (of which in what follows);
and from the signification of "oil," as being the good of love (see n.
886, 4582, 4638). From this it is evident that by "cakes mixed with oil"
is signified the celestial which is from the inmost, for "oil" denotes
the good of love, which is inmost. The case herein is that the heavens
have been distinguished into two kingdoms, one of which is called
"spiritual," the other "celestial." To the spiritual kingdom in the
heavens corresponds understanding with man, and to the celestial kingdom
corresponds his will (n. 9835). In each kingdom there is an internal and
an external, as also with man in his understanding and will; for
understanding with man is internal and external, and will is internal
and external. Internal understanding makes the spiritual life of the
internal man, and external understanding makes the spiritual life of the
external man; but internal will makes the celestial life of the internal
man, and external will makes the celestial life of the external man.
That there is an internal and an external with man, can be seen by
everyone who reflects, especially from hypocrites, the deceitful, the
cunning, and the malicious, in that interiorly they think contrary to
the truths of faith, and also will contrary to the goods of celestial
love; but exteriorly they think and will in agreement with them, and
also speak and act accordingly, that they may so appear before the
world. \[2\] Be it known further, that each kingdom in the heavens,
namely the spiritual kingdom and the celestial kingdom, is in three
divisions, being inmost, middle, and external (see n. 9873). The inmost
of the celestial kingdom is the good of love to the Lord; the middle
there is the good of mutual love, which is the good thence proceeding;
and the external is the delight proceeding from this good. The two
former are in the internal man with those who are in the Lord's
celestial kingdom; but the third is in the external with the same. These
three were represented by the bread of unleavened things, the cakes of
unleavened things mixed with oil, and the wafers of unleavened things
anointed with oil; and their purification is represented by the offering
of these three upon the altar together with the burnt-offering or
sacrifice. That such things are signified in order, can be seen merely
from the fact that these three were commanded, and their preparation is
also described, in the books of Moses, which would by no means have been
done unless they had involved arcana of heaven and the church. Otherwise
of what use would such things be? \[3\] But I know that at the present
day scarcely anyone can apprehend these arcana, for the reason that at
this day everything in the understanding and the will is worldly, and
they who think about heaven, and desire it, have and are willing to have
no other idea of it than a natural and earthly one; and where there is
such an idea, and such a will, thus such a love, there the arcana of
heaven have no place. Very different would it be if the mind were more
delighted with heavenly things than with worldly ones, for a man
apprehends what delights him; as when he is delighted with the arcana of
the civil state in kingdoms, and with those of the moral state with man.
By "the moral state" is meant that of the loves and affections, and of
the derivative thoughts, the arcana of which a shrewd man easily
perceives, because he delights to lead others by them, in order to
secure honors, gain, or reputation for the sake of these. \[4\] That
"cakes" signify the \[middle\] celestial in the internal man, is because
they are in the second rank; for in the first rank is bread of
unleavened things; in the second are cakes mixed with oil; and in the
third are wafers anointed with oil. These three were called
"meat-offerings," and were offered on the altar together with
burnt-offerings and sacrifices. How they were to be prepared is
described in Leviticus 2; and how they were to be offered is described
in various passages, as by Aaron on the day of his anointing, in
Leviticus 6:13-16. \[5\] By "cakes" in the Word is also meant the good
of love in general; from which it is that the "breads of faces," or "of
setting forth," are called "cakes" in Moses: Thou shalt take fine flour,
and bake it into twelve cakes; of two tenth parts shall one cake be. And
thou shalt set them on the table before Jehovah. And thou shalt put pure
frankincense upon each row (Lev. 24:5-9); the "pure frankincense put
upon the cakes" signified truth from celestial good, which is the
ultimate or outermost of the celestial kingdom. \[6\] By "cakes" is also
signified the good of love in general, in Jeremiah: The sons gather
wood, and the fathers kindle a fire, and the women knead the dough, to
make cakes to the queen of the heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings
to other gods (Jer. 7:18; 44:19); "to make cakes to the queen of the
heavens" denotes to worship the devil from the good of celestial love;
and "to pour out drink-offerings to other gods" denotes to worship Satan
from the truths of faith. For by "the queen of the heavens" are
signified those who are in the hell of genii; and by "other gods," those
who are in the hell of evil spirits (on which see n. 5977, 8593, 8622,
8625). They who are in the hell of genii are collectively called "the
devil;" and they who are in the hell of evil spirits are called "Satan."
\[7\] But the good of spiritual love is signified by "cakes" in Hosea:
Ephraim hath become a cake not turned (Hos. 7:8); but "cake" is here
expressed by another term in the original tongue, which signifies the
good of spiritual love; a cake is "not turned" when the external man
rules over the internal. When this is the case with man, the order is
inverted; for then the external rules, and the internal serves.
"Ephraim" denotes the intellectual of the church, which is enlightened
and affected when the truths and goods of faith are received.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9994.">9994.</span></span>

And wafers of unleavened things anointed with oil. That this signifies
the celestial in the external man, is evident from the signification of
"wafers," as being the celestial in the external man (of which below);
from the signification of "unleavened," as being purified (see above, n.
9992); and from the signification of "oil," as being the good of love
(n. 886, 4582, 4638). From this it is evident that by "wafers of
unleavened things anointed with oil" is signified the celestial in the
external man, which proceeds in order from the prior celestials. The
wafers are said to be "anointed with oil," but the cakes "mixed with
oil," for the reason that the wafers are in the third rank, and the
cakes in the second (as said just above, n. 9993); and that which is in
the second rank proceeds from the inmost immediately, and hence has in
it the inmost celestial, which is signified by "oil;" and that which is
in the third rank proceeds from the inmost mediately, namely, through
that which is in the second rank, and hence has the inmost not so much
in it as that which is in the second rank. Therefore as the cakes
signify the celestial of the second rank, they are said to be "mixed"
with oil; and as the wafers signify the celestial of the third rank,
they are said to be "anointed" with oil. But this is difficult of
apprehension unless it is known how the case is with the coming forth of
things in successive order, which is like end, cause, and effect. The
inmost is the end, the middle is the cause, and the ultimate is the
effect. The end must be in the cause that it may be the cause of this
end, and the cause must be in the effect that it may be the effect of
this cause. The end does not appear in the effect as it does in the
cause, because the effect is further from the end than is the cause.
From this the mind may be enlightened as to how the case is with the
inmost, the middle, and the external, in successive order.

Of fine flour of wheat shalt thou make them. That this signifies the
truth that is from Divine good, and from which are these things, is
evident from the signification of "fine flour," as being truth (of which
below); and from the signification of "wheat," as being the good of love
(see n. 3941), thus in the supreme sense Divine good; and from the
signification of "making them," as being that these celestial goods,
which are signified by "bread, cakes, and wafers, of unleavened things,"
are from this truth. The case herein is as follows. All the truths and
goods that are in the heavens are from the Divine truth that proceeds
from the Lord's Divine good. As received by the angels in the celestial
kingdom this Divine truth is called "celestial good;" but in the
spiritual kingdom, as received by the angels there, it is called
"spiritual good." For howsoever the Divine truth that proceeds from the
Lord's Divine good is called truth, it is nevertheless good. The reason
why it is called truth, is that it appears in the heavens, before the
external sight of the angels there, as light; for the light in the
heavens is Divine truth. But the heat in this light, which is the good
of love, makes it to be good. Similar is the case with man. When the
truth of faith proceeds from the good of charity, which is the case when
the man has been regenerated, it then appears as good, which from this
is called "spiritual good;" for the being of truth is good, and truth is
the form of good. \[2\] From this it can be seen why a man finds it so
difficult to distinguish between thinking and willing; for when he wills
anything, he says that he thinks it; and often when he thinks anything,
that he wills it. And yet they are distinct, like truth and good; for
the being of thought is will, and the form of will is thought; as the
being of truth is good, and the form of good is truth, as just said. As
a man finds such difficulty in distinguishing between these two, he
therefore does not know what is the being of his life, and that it is
good; and not truth except insofar as this comes forth from good. Good
pertains to the will, and will is that which man loves; and therefore
truth does not become the being of man's life until he loves it; and
when a man loves it he does it. But truth pertains to the understanding,
the office of which is to think, and when a man thinks it, he can speak
about it. Moreover, it is possible to understand and think truth without
willing and doing it; but when it is devoid of will, it is not
appropriated to the man's life, because it has not in it the being of
his life. Being ignorant of this, a man attributes everything of
salvation to faith, and scarcely anything to charity; when yet faith has
its being of life from charity, as truth has it from good. \[3\]
Moreover, all the good with man is formed by means of truth; for good
flows in by an internal way from the Lord, and truth enters by an
external way; and they enter into a marriage in the internal man; but in
one way with a spiritual man and angel, and in another way with a
celestial man and angel. With a spiritual man and angel, the marriage is
effected in the intellectual part; but in a celestial man and angel in
the will part. The external way, by which truth enters, is through the
hearing and sight into the understanding; but the internal way, by which
good flows in from the Lord, is through his inmost into the will (on
which subject see what was shown in the passages cited in n. 9596). From
all this it is evident that the celestial goods signified by the "bread,
cakes, and wafers of unleavened things" come forth from the Divine truth
that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good; and that this is meant by "of
fine flour of wheat thou shalt make them." As this is so, all the
meat-offerings, which were prepared in various ways, were made of fine
flour mingled with oil (Lev. 2:1 to the end; 6:13-16; Num. 7:13, and
following verses; 15:2-15; 28:11-15). \[4\] That "fine flour," and also
"meal," denote the truth which is from good, is evident from the
following passages: Thou didst eat fine flour, honey, and oil, whence
thou becamest beautiful exceedingly (Ezek. 16:13); this is said of
Jerusalem, by which is here meant the Ancient Church; "fine flour"
denotes the truth from the good of this church; "honey" denotes its
delight; "oil" denotes the good of love; and "to eat" denotes to
appropriate; therefore it is said "thou becamest beautiful," for
spiritual beauty is from truths and goods. \[5\] In Hosea: It hath no
standing crop, the shoot shall yield no meal; if perchance it yield,
strangers shall swallow it up (Hos. 8:7); the "standing crop" denotes
the truth of faith from good in conception (n. 9146); "the shoot shall
yield no meal" denotes barrenness, because there is no truth from good;
the "strangers who shall swallow it up" denote the falsities from evil
which will consume it. \[6\] In the first book of Kings: The woman of
Zidon in Zarephath said to Elijah that she had nothing of which to make
a cake, except a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
cruse. Elijah said that she should make for him a cake in the first
place, and the cask of meal would not be consumed, and the cruse of oil
would not fail; which also came to pass (1 Kings 17:12-15); by "meal" is
here signified the truth of the church; and by "oil" its good; for by
the woman in Zidon is represented the church which is in the knowledges
of truth and good; and by Elijah the prophet, the Lord as to the Word;
from which it is evident what this miracle involves, for all the
miracles treated of in the Word involve such things as are of the church
(n. 7337, 8364, 9086). From this it is evident what is signified by the
barrel of meal not being consumed, and the cruse of oil not failing, if
the woman made a cake of what little she had for Elijah in the first
place, and for her son afterward. (That "woman" denotes the church, see
n. 252, 253; that "Zidon" denotes the knowledges of truth and good, n.
1201; and that "Elijah" denotes the Lord as to the Word, n. 2762, 5247
end.) \[7\] In Isaiah: O daughter of Babel, take the millstone and grind
meal (Isa. 47:1, 2); "the daughter of Babel" denotes those in the church
who are in a holy external, but in a profane internal; "to grind meal"
denotes to select from the sense of the letter of the Word such things
as serve to confirm the evils of the loves of self and of the world,
which evil is profane; "to grind" denotes to select, and also to explain
in favor of these loves; and "meal" denotes truth serving for this (n.
4335). \[8\] From this it is plain what is meant by "grinding,"
consequently what by that which is ground; as in these passages: Princes
were hanged up by their hand, the faces of elders were not honored, they
carried away the young men to grind (Lam. 5:12, 13). Moses took the calf
which they had made, and burnt it with fire, and ground it to powder;
then he strewed it upon the faces of the waters, and made the sons of
Israel drink (Exod. 32:20; Deut. 9:21). Then shall two be in the field;
the one shall be taken, and the other left: two women shall be grinding
at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left (Matt. 24:40,
41); from this it is evident what is meant by "grinding;" that in a good
sense it denotes to select truths from the Word and explain them so as
to be of service to good; and in a bad sense so as to be of service to
evil (n. 7780); from which it is also evident what is signified by that
which is ground, consequently by "meal," and "fine flour."

And thou shalt put them upon one basket. That this signifies the
sensuous in which these things are, is evident from the signification of
a "basket," as being the sensuous. That a "basket" denotes the sensuous
is because the sensuous is the ultimate of man's life, and in the
ultimate are stored up all the interior things in order (see n. 9828,
9836); and by vessels of every kind in the Word are signified external
things in which are interior ones (n. 3079). From this then it is that
it is said that the bread, cakes, and wafers of unleavened things should
be put into a basket, and should be brought in a basket. (That the
sensuous in man is the ultimate of his life, see n. 9212, 9216.) But the
case herein is as follows. There are two things with man which make his
life-the understanding, and the will. The ultimate of the understanding
is called sensuous knowledge, and the ultimate of the will is called
sensuous delight. Sensuous knowledge, which is the ultimate of the
understanding, is imbibed through two senses-hearing and sight; and
sensuous delight, which is the ultimate of the will, is also imbibed
through two senses-taste and touch. The ultimate of the perception of
both is smell. \[2\] The sensuous knowledge which is the ultimate of the
understanding, is meant in the Word by a "bowl," or a "cup," for the
wine which is therein, or the water, denotes the truths that belong to
the understanding; but the sensuous delight which is the ultimate of the
will, is meant in the Word by a "basket;" and as the ultimate is the
containant of all the interior things, these interior things also are
meant by these vessels; by a "bowl," or a "cup," the truths of the
understanding, and in the opposite sense falsities; and by a "basket"
the goods of the will, and in the opposite sense evils; for goods
pertain to the will, and truths to the understanding. (That "bowls," or
"cups," denote the truths of the understanding in the complex, see n.
5120, 9557; and that "baskets" denote the goods of the will in the
complex, n. 5144.) Whether you say "the goods of the will," or
"celestial goods," it is the same; and in like manner whether you say
"the truths of the understanding," or "spiritual truths." That the
things which were placed in the basket signify celestial goods, may be
seen just above (n. 9992-9994); and as the sensuous is their ultimate,
and thus the containant of all, it is said that all these things were to
be "put into a basket."

<span class="margnote"><span id="9997.">9997.</span></span>

And bring them near in the basket. That this signifies thus the presence
of all, is evident from the signification of "bringing near," as being
conjunction and presence (see n. 9378); and from the signification of a
"basket," as being the sensuous in which are all things (of which just
above, n. 9996).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9998.">9998.</span></span>

And the bullock and the two rams. That this signifies the natural or
external of man, and his spiritual or internal, which are to be
purified, is evident from the signification of "the bullock," as being
the natural or external of man, which is to be purified (see n. 9990);
and from the signification of "the rams," as being the spiritual or
internal of man, which is to be purified (see n. 9991).

Verses 4-9. And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring near unto the door
of the Tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with waters. And thou shalt
take the garments, and shalt clothe Aaron with the tunic, and the robe
of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the
girdle of the ephod. And thou shalt set the miter upon his head, and put
the crown of holiness upon the miter. And thou shalt take the oil of
anointing, and pour it upon his head, and anoint him. And thou shalt
bring near his sons, and shalt clothe them with tunics. And thou shalt
gird them with a belt, Aaron and his sons, and shalt bind the tiaras on
them, and the priesthood shall be to them for a statute of an age; and
thou shalt fill the hand of Aaron, and the hand of his sons. "And Aaron
and his sons," signifies the Lord as to Divine good and as to the Divine
truth thence derived; "thou shalt bring near unto the door of the Tent
of meeting," signifies the conjunction of both in heaven; "and shalt
wash them with waters," signifies purification by means of the truths of
faith; "and thou shalt take the garments, and shalt clothe Aaron,"
signifies a representative of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; "with the
tunic," signifies the inmost of this kingdom; "and the robe of the
ephod," signifies the middle of this kingdom; "and the ephod," signifies
its ultimate; "and the breastplate," signifies the Divine truth shining
forth from the Lord's Divine good; "and thou shalt set the miter upon
his head," signifies the Divine wisdom; "and put the crown of holiness
upon the miter," signifies the Lord's Divine Human; "and thou shalt take
the oil of anointing," signifies a representative of inauguration into
Divine good; "and pour it upon his head, and anoint him," signifies a
representative of the Divine good in the Lord as to the whole Human;
"and thou shalt bring near his sons," signifies the conjunction of the
Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good; "and shalt
clothe them with tunics," signifies a representative of the proceeding
Divine spiritual; "and thou shalt gird them with a belt," signifies a
bond of conjunction that all things may be kept in connection, and
thence in the heavenly form; "Aaron and his sons," signifies the Lord as
to Divine good and the Divine truth thence proceeding; "and shalt bind
the tiaras on them," signifies intelligence from wisdom; "and the
priesthood shall be to them," signifies the Lord as to the work of
salvation in successive order; "for a statute of an age," signifies
according to the eternal laws of order; "and thou shalt fill the hand of
Aaron, and the hand of his sons," signifies a representative of the
Divine power of the Lord by means of Divine truth from Divine good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10000.">10000.</span></span>

And Aaron and his sons. That this signifies the Lord as to Divine good
and as to the Divine truth thence derived, is evident from the
representation of Aaron, as being the Lord as to Divine good (see n.
9806); and from the representation of his sons, as being the Lord as to
the Divine truth thence derived (see n. 9807).
