### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="3301.">3301.</span></span>

That a "hairy garment" \[tunica\] signifies the truth of the natural, is
evident from the signification of a "garment" \[tunica\] as being that
which invests something else, and here therefore it signifies truth,
because this invests good; for truth is as a vesture (n. 1073, 2576); or
what is nearly the same, truth is a vessel receiving good (n. 1469,
1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269); and also from the signification of
"hairy," as being the natural in respect to truth. "Hair," or the "hair
of the head," is frequently mentioned in the Word, and there signifies
the natural; the reason is that hair is an excrescence in the outermost
parts of man, just as is the natural also relatively to his rational and
to the interior things thereof. It appears to man, while he lives in the
body, that the natural is his all, but this is so far from being true
that the natural is rather an excrescence from his internals, as hair is
from the things of the body. The two also proceed from the internals in
almost the same way. Hence it is that men who in the life of the body
have been merely natural, in the other life, when presented to view in
accordance with that state, appear as if covered with hair over almost
the whole face. Moreover man's natural is represented by the hair of the
head; when it is from good, it is represented by becoming and carefully
arranged hair; but when not from good, by unbecoming and disheveled
hair. \[2\] It is from this representative that in the Word "hair"
signifies the natural, especially as to truth; as in Zechariah: And it
shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed, a man
by reason of his vision, when he hath prophesied, neither shall they
wear a hairy tunic to deceive (Zech. 13:4). "Prophets" denote those who
teach truths, here those who teach falsities (n. 2534); "vision" denotes
truths, here falsities; a "hairy tunic" denotes the natural as to truth;
and because there was no truth, but rather falsity, it is said, "to
deceive." Prophets were clothed with such raiment in order to represent
that truth, because it is external. Therefore also Elijah the Tishbite
from such clothing is called a "hairy man" (2 Kings 1:8); and John, who
was the last of the prophets, had "raiment of camel's hair" (Matt. 3:4).
(That "camels" are memory-knowledges in the natural man, may be seen
above, n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145; and also that memory-knowledges are
the truths of the natural, n. 3293.) \[3\] That the "hair of the head"
signified the natural as to truth is plainly evident from the Nazirites,
to whom it was commanded that during all the days of their Naziriteship
no razor should pass upon their head, until the days were fulfilled
during which they separated themselves to Jehovah, and then they should
let down the locks of their head, and that then they should shave the
head of their Naziriteship at the door of the tent of meeting, and
should put the hair upon the fire which was under the eucharistic
sacrifice (Num. 6:5, 18). The Nazirites represented the Lord as to the
Divine Human; and thence the man of the celestial church, who is a
likeness of the Lord (n. 51); and the natural of this man is represented
by the hair; and therefore, when the Nazirites were sanctified they were
to put off their old or former natural man, into which they were born,
and were to put on a new man; which was signified by the command that
when the days had been fulfilled during which they were to separate
themselves to Jehovah, they were to let down the locks of their head,
and put them upon the fire under the sacrifice. For the state of the
celestial man is such that he is in good, and from good knows all
truths, and never thinks and speaks from truths about good, still less
does he think and speak about good from memory-knowledges (see n. 202,
337, 2715, 2718, 3246). Moreover celestial men are such that before they
put off that state they are in a natural so strong as to truth that they
are able to battle with the hells; for it is truth that fights, and
never good, as the hells cannot make even a distant approach to good.
(That such is the case with truth and good may be seen above, n. 1950,
1951.) \[4\] From this it is evident whence Samson had strength from his
hair; concerning whom it is said: The angel of Jehovah appeared to the
woman saying, Behold thou shalt conceive, and bear a son, and no razor
shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto God
from the womb (Judg. 13:3, 5); and afterwards it is related that he told
Delilah that if he should be shaven, his strength would depart from him,
and he would be rendered weak; and after he had been shaven his strength
departed, and the Philistines seized him; and afterwards, when the hair
of his head began to grow again after he was shaven, his strength
returned, so that he pulled down the pillars of the house (Judges 16).
Who does not see that in these things there is a heavenly arcanum, which
no one knows unless he has been instructed concerning representatives;
namely, that the Nazirite represents the celestial man, and that so long
as he had hair he represented the natural of this man, which as before
said is in truth thus powerful and strong. And as at that time all
representatives that were commanded by the Lord had such force and
effect, this was the source of Samson's strength. But Samson was not a
sanctified Nazirite like those described above, namely, as having put on
a state of good instead of truth. The effect of his strength by reason
of his hair was principally from his representing the Lord, who from the
natural man as to truth fought with the hells and subdued them, and this
before he put on the Divine good and truth even as to the natural man.
\[5\] From this also it is evident why it was commanded that the high
priest, upon whose head was poured the oil of anointing, and whose hand
was consecrated to put on the garments, should not shave his head, nor
rend his clothes (Lev. 21:10); and similarly that the priests the
Levites (where the new temple is treated of) were not to shave their
heads, nor let down their hair (Ezek. 44:20); namely, that they might
represent the Lord's Divine natural as to the truth which is from good,
and which is called the truth of good. That "hair," or a "head of hair"
signifies the natural as to truth is evident also from the prophecies of
the Word, as in Ezekiel: I set thee as the bud of the field, whence thou
didst grow, and didst grow up into beauties of beauties; the breasts
have become firm, and thine hair was grown (Ezek. 16:7); where Jerusalem
is treated of, which here signifies the Ancient Church, which in process
of time had become perverted. The "breasts become firm" denote natural
good; the "hair that was grown," natural truth. \[6\] In Daniel: I
beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit.
His raiment was white as snow, and the hair of His head like the pure
wool; His throne was fiery flames (Dan. 7:9). And in John: In the midst
of the lampstands one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment
down to the foot, and girt about at the paps with a golden girdle. And
His head and His hair were white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes
were as a flame of fire (Rev. 1:13-14); "hair white like pure wool"
denotes the Divine natural as to truth. In the Word, and in the rituals
of the Jewish Church, truth itself was represented by white, which being
from good, is called "pure wool." The reason why the representation of
truth is by white, and the representation of good by red, is that truth
is of light, and good is of the fire from which the light proceeds.
\[7\] Like other expressions in the Word, "hair" has also an opposite
sense, and signifies the natural as to truth perverted, as in Isaiah: In
that day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, in the
passages of the river, with the King of Assyria, the head and the hair
of the feet; and it shall also consume the beard (Isa. 7:20). In
Ezekiel: Son of man, take thee a sharp sword, a barber's razor shalt
thou take unto thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thine head, and
upon thy beard; and take thee balances to weigh, and divide the hairs. A
third part shalt thou burn with fire in the midst of the city; thou
shalt take a third part and smite with the sword round about the city;
and a third part thou shalt scatter to the wind; and thou shalt take
thereof a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts; and of these again
shalt thou take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them
in the fire; therefrom shall a fire come forth unto all the house of
Israel (Ezek. 5:1-4). In this manner it is representatively described
that there is no longer any interior and exterior natural truth, which
is signified by the "hair" and the "beard." That lusts have destroyed it
is signified by its being "burned with fire"; that reasonings have
destroyed it is signified by "smiting with the sword round about the
city"; that false principles have destroyed it, is signified by
"scattering it to the wind." The meaning of this passage is similar to
what the Lord teaches in Matthew, that of the seed, which is truth, some
fell among thorns, some on the rock, and some upon the way (Matt.
13:1-9). \[8\] That the "hair of the head" signifies the unclean truths
and falsities which are of the natural man, was represented also by the
command that when a woman that had been taken captive from the enemy was
to be married, she was to be brought into the house, the hair of her
head was to be shaved, her nails were to be pared, and the raiment of
her captivity was to be put off (Deut. 21:12-13); also that when the
Levites were consecrated, the water of expiation was to be sprinkled
upon them, they were to cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and
their clothes were to be washed, and thus they were to be cleansed (Num.
8:7); and also that Nebuchadnezzar was driven out from men to eat grass
like oxen, and his body to be wet with the dew of heaven, until his hair
grew like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws (Dan. 4:33).
That in leprosy the colors of the hair and beard were to be observed, as
to whether they were white, reddish, yellow, black, and also those of
the garments; and that he who was cleansed from leprosy should shave off
all the hair of the head, beard, and eyebrows (Lev. 13, 14:8-9),
signified unclean falsities from what is profane, which in the internal
sense is "leprosy." \[9\] "Baldness" however signified the natural in
which there was nothing of truth, as in Isaiah: He is gone up to Bayith,
and to Dibon, to the high places, to weep over Nebo, and Moab shall howl
over Medeba; on all their heads is baldness, every beard is shaved (Isa.
15:2). In the same: It shall come to pass that instead of braided work
there shall be baldness, and branding instead of beauty (Isa. 3:24).
That the children who said to Elisha, "Go up, thou bald-head; go up,
thou bald-head," were torn in pieces by bears from the wood (2 Kings
2:23-24) represented those who blaspheme the Word, speaking as if there
were no truth in it; for Elisha represented the Lord as to the Word (n.
2762). From this it is now manifest how much power there was at that
time in representatives.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3302.">3302.</span></span>

And they called his name Esau. That this signifies its quality, namely,
the quality of the natural as to good, is evident from the signification
of "calling a name," or of "calling by name," as being to know what the
thing is, thus its quality (see n. 144, 145, 440, 768, 1754, 1896, 2009,
2724, 3237); and from the fact that all names whatever in the Word in
the internal sense denote actual things (n. 1224, 1888); and such is the
case with the name Esau. That "Esau" signifies the Lord's Divine natural
as to Divine good when first conceived, is evident from what has been
already said, and from what follows concerning Esau, as also from other
parts of the Word; but as Esau and Edom have nearly the same
signification, with the difference that "Edom" is the Divine natural as
to good to which are adjoined the doctrinal things of truth, therefore
at verse 30 below, where Esau is called "Edom," of the Lord's Divine
mercy this will be confirmed by passages from the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3303.">3303.</span></span>

And after that came forth his brother. That this signifies truth, is
evident from the signification of "brother," as being good, and also
truth, for these are called "brothers." That charity is the "brother" of
faith, or good the "brother" of truth, may be seen above (n. 367). So on
the other hand faith is the "brother" of charity, or truth the "brother"
of good; also in the natural, the affection of good is called "brother,"
and the affection of truth "sister" (n. 3160); likewise, "husband and
wife," and "man \[vir\] and woman;" but these always relatively to the
states treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3304.">3304.</span></span>

And his hand laid hold on Esau's heel. That this signifies the lowest of
the good of the natural to which it adhered with some power, is evident
from the signification of "hand," as being power (see n. 878; and that
it is predicated of truth, n. 3091); from the signification of "laying
hold of," as being to adhere; from the signification of "heel," as being
the lowest of the natural (see n. 259); and from the representation of
Esau, as being the good of the natural (see n. 3302). Hence it is
evident that "his hand laid hold on Esau's heel" signifies the lowest of
the good of the natural to which truth adhered with some power. \[2\] As
regards truth adhering with some power to the lowest good of the
natural, the case is this: The natural, or the natural man, when being
regenerated, has its conception as to good and truth from the rational,
or through the rational from the spiritual; through this from the
celestial; and through this from the Divine. Thus does the influx follow
in succession, and beginning from the Divine descends until it
terminates in the lowest of the natural, that is, in the worldly and
corporeal. When the lowest natural is affected with faults by what is
hereditary from the mother, truth cannot be united to good, but can only
adhere to it with some power; nor is truth united to good until these
faults have been driven away. This is the reason why although good is
indeed born with man, truth is not; and therefore infants are devoid of
any knowledge of truth; and truth has to be learned, and afterwards
conjoined with good (see n. 1831, 1832). Hence also it is said that they
"struggled together in the midst of her," that is, they fought (n.
3289). From this it follows that from the first conception truth
supplants good, as is said of Jacob in regard to Esau: Is not he named
Jacob? For he hath supplanted me these two times (Gen. 27:36). And in
Hosea: To visit upon Jacob his ways, according to his doings will he
recompense him; in the womb he supplanted his brother (Hos. 12:2-3).
\[3\] They who keep the mind solely in the historicals, and who are not
able to withdraw it from them, do not know but that these and former
passages simply foretell the events which came to pass between Esau and
Jacob, and this conviction is confirmed also by what follows. But the
Word of the Lord is of such a nature that the historicals are in their
own series, while the spiritual things of the internal sense are in
theirs; so that the former may be viewed by the external man, and the
latter by the internal man, and that in this way there may be a
correspondence between the two, namely, between the external man and the
internal; and this by means of the Word, for the Word is the union of
earth and heaven, as has been frequently shown. Thus in everyone who is
in a holy state while reading the Word, there is a union of his external
man which is on the earth, with his internal man which is in heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3305.">3305.</span></span>

And he called his name Jacob. That this signifies the doctrine of truth
of the natural, is evident from the signification of "calling a name,"
or of "calling by name," as being quality (concerning which see just
above, n. 3302). The quality that is represented by Jacob is the
doctrine of truth of the natural, as may be seen from the representation
of Esau, as being the good of life of the truth of the natural (n.
3300), and from many places in the Word, where he is named. There are
two things which constitute the natural, as there are two that
constitute the rational, nay, that constitute the whole man, one of
which is of life, and the other of doctrine. That which is of life
belongs to the will, while that which is of doctrine belongs to the
understanding. The former is called good, and the latter truth. This
good is that which is represented by Esau, and the truth by Jacob; or
what is the same, the good of life of the truth of the natural is that
which is represented by Esau, and the doctrine of truth of the natural
is that which is represented by Jacob. Whether you say the good of life
of the truth of the natural and the doctrine of truth of the natural, or
those who are in these things, it is the same; for the good of life and
the doctrine of truth cannot exist apart from their subject. If they
have no subject they are a kind of abstract affair which nevertheless
has regard to the man in whom this may be. Wherefore by "Jacob" are here
signified those who are in the doctrine of truth of the natural. \[2\]
They who abide in the mere sense of the letter believe that by "Jacob"
in the Word is meant all that people which was descended from Jacob, and
for this reason they apply to that people all things that have been said
historically and prophetically concerning Jacob. But the Word is Divine
chiefly in this respect, that all things in it both in general and in
particular do not regard one nation or one people, but the universal
human race; namely, that which is, which has been, and which will be;
and also that which is still more universal, namely, the Lord's kingdom
in the heavens; and in the supreme sense, the Lord Himself. It is for
this reason that the Word is Divine. If it had regard merely to one
nation, then it would be human, and there would be nothing more of the
Divine in it than there was of the holy of worship with that nation; and
everyone may know that there was none of this with the people called
"Jacob;" from which it is evident that by "Jacob" in the Word is not
meant Jacob, and also that by "Israel" is not meant Israel; for almost
everywhere in the prophecies, when Jacob is named, Israel is named also,
and no one can know what is specifically meant by the one, and what by
the other, except from the sense which lies more deeply concealed and
contains within it the arcana of heaven. \[3\] That by "Jacob" therefore
in the internal sense is signified the doctrine of truth of the natural;
or what is the same, those who are in this doctrine, of whatever nation
they may be; and that in the supreme sense the Lord is meant is evident
from the following passages. In Luke: The angel said unto her, Fear not,
Mary, for thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a Son,
and shalt call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called
the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the
throne of His father David; and He shall reign over the house of Jacob
forever; and of His kingdom there shall be no end (Luke 1:30-33). That
here by the "house of Jacob" is not meant the Jewish nation or people
can be seen by all, for the Lord's kingdom was not over that people, but
over all in the universe who have faith in Him, and who from faith are
in charity. Hence it is evident that by "Jacob" as here named by the
angel is not meant the people of Jacob; and consequently neither in
other places, by the "seed of Jacob," the "sons of Jacob," the "land of
Jacob," the "inheritance of Jacob," the "king of Jacob," and the "God of
Jacob," which expressions so often occur in the Word of the Old
Testament, are these intended. \[4\] The case is the same in respect to
"Israel" as in Matthew: The angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a
dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee
into Egypt; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord
through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called My Son (Matt.
2:13, 15); and in the prophet it is said: When Israel was a child, then
I loved him, and called My son out of Egypt (Hos. 11:1). That in this
passage "Israel" is the Lord is very evident; and yet from the sense of
the letter it cannot be known but that the "child Israel" means the
earliest descendants of Jacob, who came into Egypt and were afterwards
called out thence. It is the same in other passages where "Jacob" and
"Israel" are named, although this does not appear from the sense of the
letter, as in Isaiah: Hear O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have
chosen; thus saith Jehovah who made thee, and formed thee from the womb,
who will help thee; Fear not O Jacob my servant, and thou Jeshurun whom
I have chosen; for I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and
streams upon the dry ground; I will pour My spirit upon thy seed, and My
blessing upon thine offspring; this one shall say, I am Jehovah's; and
this shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and that one shall write
with his hand unto Jehovah, and surname himself by the name of Israel
(Isa. 44:1-3, 5); where "Jacob" and "Israel" evidently denote the Lord;
and the "seed," and "offspring of Jacob," those who are in faith in Him.
\[5\] In the prophecy concerning the sons of Israel in Moses: Joseph
shall sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of his hands shall be
made strong by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; from thence is the
shepherd, the stone of Israel (Gen. 49:24); where also the "Mighty One
of Jacob" and the "stone of Israel" clearly denote the Lord. In Isaiah:
My glory will I not give to another; attend unto Me, O Jacob, and Israel
My called, I am He; I am the first, I also am the last (Isa. 48:11-12);
here also "Jacob" and "Israel" signify the Lord. In Ezekiel: I will take
the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of
Israel his companions, and I will add them upon him with the stick of
Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in My hand. I will
take the sons of Israel from among the nations, whither they be gone,
and will gather them from every side, and bring them upon their own
land; and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of
Israel; and one king shall be king to them all, and they shall be no
more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms
anymore at all. My servant David shall be king over them, and they all
shall have one shepherd. And they shall dwell on the land that I have
given unto Jacob My servant, wherein your fathers dwelt; and they shall
dwell therein, they and their sons, and their sons, forever; and David
My servant shall be prince to them forever: I will make a covenant of
peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I
will place them, and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in the
midst of them forevermore. My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I
will be their God, and they shall be My people. And the nations shall
know that I Jehovah do sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary is in the
midst of them for evermore (Ezek. 37:19, 21-22, 24-28); here again it is
clearly manifest that by "Joseph," "Ephraim," "Judah," "Israel,"
"Jacob," and "David," are not meant these persons, but in the supreme
sense Divine spiritual things which are in the Lord, and which are the
Lord's in His kingdom and church. That David was not to be, as is said,
their king and prince forever, everyone may know; but that by "David" is
meant the Lord may be seen above (n. 1888). It may also be known that
Israel will not be gathered together from wherever they have been
dispersed, and will not be sanctified, and the sanctuary placed in the
midst of them forever, as is said; but this is to be with those who in
the representative sense are signified by "Israel;" and who, as is
known, are all the faithful. \[6\] In Micah: Assembling I will assemble
O Jacob, all of thee; gathering I will gather the remnant of Israel; I
will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah (Micah 2:12); where the
meaning is similar. In Isaiah: Jacob shall cause to take root those who
come; Israel shall blossom and bud; and they shall fill the face of the
world with produce (Isa. 27:6); where also the meaning is similar. In
the same: Thus saith Jehovah who redeemed Abraham, to the house of
Jacob; Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax
pale; for when he seeth his children, the work of My hands, in the midst
of him, they shall sanctify My name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy
One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel. They also
that err in spirit shall know intelligence (Isa. 29:22-24). In the same:
Thus saith Jehovah to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have
holden, to subdue nations before him, and I will loose the loins of
kings; to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut; I
will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight; I will break
in pieces the doors of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron; I will
give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places,
that thou mayest know that I am Jehovah, who am called by thy name, the
God of Israel, for Jacob My servant's sake, and Israel Mine elect. I
have called thee by thy name, I have surnamed thee when thou didst not
know Me (Isa. 45:1-4); where also the Lord is plainly treated of. In
Micah: In the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the
house of Jehovah shall be established as the head of the mountains; and
many nations shall go, and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will
teach us of His ways, and we will walk in His paths; for out of Zion
shall go forth the doctrine, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem
(Micah 4:1-2). In David: Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all
the dwellings of Jacob; glorious things shall be preached in thee, O
city of God (Ps. 87:2-3). In Jeremiah: They shall serve Jehovah their
God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. And thou,
fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O
Israel; for lo I will save thee from afar (Jer. 30:9, 10). In Isaiah:
Listen O isles unto me; and hearken ye peoples from far; Jehovah hath
called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath He made
mention of my name; and He said unto me, Thou art My servant Israel, in
whom I will be made glorious (Isa. 49:1, 3). Again: Then shalt thou
delight thyself in Jehovah, and I will make thee to ride upon the high
places of the earth, and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob
(Isa. 58:14). Again: I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of
Judah an inheritor of My mountains, that Mine elect may possess it, and
My servants shall dwell there (Isa. 65:9). \[7\] In the supreme sense of
all these passages by "Jacob" and "Israel" is meant the Lord; and in the
representative sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and the church which
is a church from the doctrine of truth and the life of good. By "Jacob"
are meant those who are in the externals of this church; and by "Israel"
those who are in its internals. From these and many other passages it is
evident that by "Jacob" is nowhere meant Jacob, neither by "Israel,"
Israel; and in the same way, by "Isaac" is not meant Isaac, nor by
"Abraham," Abraham, where they are named; as in Matthew: Many shall come
from the east and the west, and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac,
and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 8:11). In Luke: Ye shall
see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom
of God (Luke 13:28). and again: Lazarus was carried by the angels into
Abraham's bosom (Luke 16:20, 22). For in heaven they know nothing of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and when these words are read by man, the
angels perceive nought but the Lord as to the Divine and the Divine
Human; and by "reclining with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," they perceive
nought but being with the Lord; and by being "in Abraham's bosom,"
nought but being in the Lord. But it was thus said because at that time
man was so far removed from internal things that he did not know and was
not willing to know otherwise than that all things in the Word are
according to the letter; and when the Lord spoke with men according to
the letter, it was that they might receive faith, and also that there
might even then be an internal sense within, by which there could be the
conjunction of man with Himself. This being the case, it may appear what
is signified in the Word of the Old Testament by the "God of Jacob," and
by the "Holy One of Israel," namely, the Lord Himself. (That the "God of
Jacob" is the Lord, see 2 Sam. 23:1; Isa. 2:3; 41:21; Micah 4:2; Ps.
20:1; 46:7; 75:9; 76:6; 81:1, 4; 84:8; 94:7; 114:7; 132:2; 146:5. That
the "Holy One of Israel" is the Lord, see Isa. 1:4; 5:19, 24; 10:20;
12:6; 17:7; 29:19; 30:11, 12, 15; 31:1; 37:23; 41:14, 16, 20; 43:3, 14;
45:11; 47:4; 48:17; 49:7; 54:5; 55:5; 60:14; Jer. 50:29; Ezek. 39:7; Ps.
71:22; 78:41; 89:18.)

And Isaac was a son of sixty years when she bare them. That this
signifies the state of the Divine rational at that time, is evident from
what has been said above concerning numbers (n. 3252, 3275). But what
the number "sixty" involves may be seen from the simple numbers of which
it is composed, namely, five and twelve, for five times twelve are
sixty; what "five" signifies may be seen above (n. 649, 1686); and what
"twelve" (n. 3272). It is composed also of six and ten, for six times
ten are sixty. What "six" signifies may be seen above (n. 720, 737,
900); and what "ten" (n. 576, 2284, 3107). It is composed also of two
and thirty, for twice thirty are sixty. What "two" signifies may be seen
above (n. 720, 900, 1335, 1686); and what "thirty" (n. 2276). As the
number "sixty" is composed of these simple numbers, it involves the
things signified by them in their order, all of which signify the state
in which the Lord's Divine rational then was. These things are manifest
before the angels in clear light from the Lord; but before man,
especially one who believes that no arcanum is concealed in the numbers
mentioned in the Word, they cannot be unfolded; both on account of his
incredulity, and also because so many contents cannot be reduced into a
series suitable to man's apprehension.

Verses 27, 28. And the boys grew up: and Esau was a man skillful in
hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob was a perfect <span
id="fr_89"></span>[3307-1](#fn_89.md) man, dwelling in tents. And Isaac
loved Esau, because his hunting was in his mouth; and Rebekah loved
Jacob. "And the boys grew up," signifies the first state; "and Esau was
a man skillful in hunting," signifies the good of life from truths
sensuous and of memory-knowledge; "a man of the field," signifies the
good of life from doctrinal things; "and Jacob was a perfect man,"
signifies truth; "dwelling in tents," signifies the derivative worship;
"and Isaac loved Esau, because his hunting was in his mouth," signifies
that the Divine good of the Lord's Divine rational loved the good of
truth; "and Rebekah loved Jacob," signifies that the Divine truth of the
Divine rational loved the doctrine of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3308.">3308.</span></span>

The boys grew up. That this signifies the first state, namely, of the
conjunction of good and truth, is evident from the signification of
"growing up," when predicated of good and truth in respect to origin and
progress, as being the first state of the latter, namely, of progress,
concerning which hereafter; and from the signification of the "boys," as
being good and truth; for good is represented by the "boy Esau," and
truth by the "boy Jacob," as before shown. The case with good and truth
is the same as with offspring, in that they are conceived, are in the
womb, are born, grow up, and also advance in age even to the last. That
they are conceived, are in the womb, and are born, pertains to the state
of origin; but that they grow up, and advance in age even to the last,
pertains to the state of progress. The state of progress advances in
succession from the birth, and is a state of the conjunction of good and
truth. The first of this state is that which is here signified by
"growing up." This state commences immediately after birth, and is
continued even to the last of life; and with those who are in good,
after the life of the body to eternity. The angels are thus being
continually perfected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3309.">3309.</span></span>

And Esau was a man skillful \[sciens\] in hunting. That this signifies
the good of life from truths sensuous and of memory-knowledge, is
evident from the representation of Esau, as being the good of life
(concerning which see above); and from the signification of a "man
skillful in hunting," as being those who are in the affection of truth
(concerning which hereafter). For a "man skillful" is predicated of the
affection of truth, or of those who are in the affection of truth;
whereas "hunting" signifies the truths themselves, but truths which are
of the natural man from which are goods. And as the truths of the
natural man are those which are called memory-knowledges (n. 3293); and
these are chiefly of two kinds or degrees, namely, sensuous truths, and
truths in the form of memory-knowledge, both are here signified by
"hunting." Sensuous truths are those in which children are, and truths
in the form of memory-knowledge are those in which the same children are
as they grow up. For no one can be in truths of memory-knowledge unless
he is first in sensuous truths, inasmuch as the ideas of the former are
procured from the latter; and from these may afterwards be learned and
comprehended truths still more interior, which are called doctrinal
truths, and which are signified by a "man of the field" (concerning
which presently). \[2\] That by "hunting" are signified truths sensuous
and of memory-knowledge, in which are instructed and by which are
affected those who are in the good of life, is because "hunting," in a
wide sense, means the things taken by hunting; such as rams, kids,
she-goats, and the like; and which are spiritual goods, as may be seen
above (n. 2180, 2830); and also because the arms used in hunting, which
were quivers, bows, and darts, signify the doctrinal things of truth (n.
2685, 2686, 2709). That such are the things which are signified by
"hunting," is evident from what is said to Esau by his father Isaac in a
subsequent chapter: Take I pray thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and
go out to the field, and hunt me a hunting, and make me savory meat,
such as I have loved (Gen. 27:3-4); and to Jacob, who is there taken for
Esau, in the same chapter: Bring to me that I may eat of my son's
hunting, that my soul may bless thee (Gen. 27:25); from which it is
evident what is signified by "hunting." \[3\] Hence it is that to "hunt"
signifies to teach and also to persuade, and this in both senses, that
is, from the affection of truth, and from the affection of falsity; from
the affection of truth in Jeremiah: I will bring them back into their
land that I gave unto their fathers; behold I will send for many
fishers, saith Jehovah, and they shall fish them; and after this I will
send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain and
from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks (Jer. 16:15-16);
where "fishers" denote those who teach from sensuous truths (n. 40,
991); and "hunters," those who teach from truths of memory-knowledge,
and also from doctrinal things. "Upon every mountain and upon every
hill," signifies teaching those who are in the affection of good and in
the affection of truth. That "mountain and hill" have this signification
may be seen above (n. 795, 796, 1430). The like is involved in "hunting
in the field" (as in Gen. 27:3). That "hunting" signifies also
persuading from the affection of falsity, appears in Ezekiel: Behold I
am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them
fly away, and I will tear off your coverings, and will deliver My people
out of your hand, and they shall be no longer in your hand to be hunted
(Ezek. 13:20-21). Concerning the signification of "hunting" in this
sense, see n. 1178; but to this kind of hunting, "nets" are usually
attributed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3310.">3310.</span></span>

That "a man of the field" signifies the good of life from doctrinal
things, is evident from the signification of "field." In the Word
frequent mention is made of "earth" or "land," of "ground," and of
"field;" and by "earth" or "land," when used in a good sense, is
signified the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth, thus the
church, which is His kingdom on earth. The like is signified by
"ground," but in a more restricted sense (n. 566, 662, 1066-1068, 1262,
1413, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928). The same is signified also by
"field," but in a sense still more restricted (n. 368, 2971); and as the
church is not the church from doctrinal things except insofar as these
have respect to the good of life as their end; or what is the same,
unless these doctrinal things are conjoined with the good of life,
therefore by "field" is principally signified the good of life; and in
order that this may be of the church, there must be doctrinal things
from the Word which have been implanted in this good. Without doctrinal
things there is indeed good of life, but not as yet the good of the
church, thus not as yet good truly spiritual, except only in the
capacity of becoming so; as is the case with the good of life among the
Gentiles who have not the Word, and therefore are ignorant of the Lord.
\[2\] That a "field" is the good of life in which are to be implanted
the things which are of faith, that is, spiritual truths which are of
the church, is very evident from the Lord's parable in Matthew: The
sower went forth to sow, and as he sowed, some fell upon the hard way,
and the birds came and devoured them; and others fell upon stony places
where they had not much earth, and straightway they sprung up, because
they had no deepness of earth; and when the sun was risen, they were
scorched, and because they had no root, they withered away; and others
fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them; but others
fell upon the good ground and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some
sixtyfold, some thirtyfold: he that hath an ear to hear, let him hear
(Matt. 13:3-9; Mark 4:3-9; Luke 8:5-8). Here four kinds of earth or
ground in a field-that is, in the church-are treated of. That the "seed"
is the Word of the Lord, thus truth, which is said to be of faith, and
that the "good ground" is the good which is of charity, is evident, for
it is the good in man that receives the Word; the "hard way" is falsity;
a "stony place" is truth that has no root in good; "thorns" are evils.
\[3\] As regards the good of life from doctrinal things, which is
signified by "a man of the field," the case is this: They who are being
regenerated, at first do what is good from doctrinal things, for of
themselves they do not know what is good, but learn it from the
doctrinal things of love and charity; from these they know who the Lord
is; who is the neighbor; what love is, and what charity; thus what good
is. When they are in this state they are in the affection of truth, and
are called "men \[viri\] of the field;" but afterwards when they have
been regenerated, they do not do what is good from doctrinal things, but
from love and charity, for they are then in the good itself which they
have learned through doctrinal things, and then are called "men
\[homines\] of the field." The case herein is as with one who by nature
inclines to adulteries, thefts, and murders, but who learns from the
commandments of the Decalogue that such things are of hell, and so
abstains from them. In this state he is affected by the commandments
because he is afraid of hell, and from these and likewise from many
things in the Word he learns how he ought to direct his life; and in
this case when he does what is good, he does it from the commandments.
But when he is in good, he begins to be averse to the adulteries,
thefts, and murders to which before he had been inclined; and when he is
in this state, he no longer does what is good from the commandments, but
from good, which then is in him. In the former state he learns good from
truth; in the latter state he teaches truth from good. \[4\] The same is
the case also with spiritual truths, which are called doctrinal things,
and are still more interior commandments; for doctrinal things are the
interior truths that belong to the natural man. The first truths are of
sense, the next are of memory-knowledge, the interior ones are of
doctrine. These doctrinal truths are founded upon truths of
memory-knowledge, for man can form and retain no idea, notion, or
conception of them except from memory-knowledges. But truths of
memory-knowledge are founded upon truths of the senses, for without
sensuous things no memory-knowledges can be comprehended by man. These
truths, namely, those of memory-knowledge and of sense, are what are
signified by "a man skillful in hunting;" but doctrinal truths are those
which are signified by a "man of the field." In this way do these truths
follow in succession with man; and therefore until he is of adult age,
and through truths of sense and of memory-knowledge is in doctrinal
truths, no man is able to be regenerated, for he cannot be confirmed in
the truths of doctrine, except by means of ideas derived from the things
of memory-knowledge and of sense. For nothing is possible in man's
thought, even as to the deepest arcanum of faith, that is not attended
with a natural and sensuous idea, although the man is for the most part
ignorant of the nature of it; but in the other life, if he desires it,
it is presented to view before his understanding, and even, if he so
wishes, before his sight; for however incredible it may appear, in the
other life such things can be presented to the sight.

And Jacob was a perfect <span id="fr_90"></span>[3311-1](#fn_90.md) man.
That this signifies truth, is evident from the representation of Jacob,
as being the doctrine of natural truth (n. 3305); and from the
signification of "perfect," as being predicated of those who are in
truth, thus of truth (n. 612).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3312.">3312.</span></span>

Dwelling in tents. That this signifies the derivative worship, is
evident from the signification of "tents," as being the holy of love,
and thence of worship (n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152). That "tents" signify
the holy of worship, is because in the most ancient time the man of the
church who was in love to the Lord and thence in holy worship, dwelt in
tents, and there performed his holy worship; and because at that time
the holy of love and thence the holy of worship began to be represented
by tents, it was commanded that they should make a Tent according to the
pattern shown to Moses upon Mount Sinai, and should therein institute
their Divine worship. Hence also the feast of tabernacles, and their
then dwelling in tents, was for the sake of the representation of the
holy worship which belonged to the man of the celestial church; and this
shows that by "dwelling in tents" is signified worship.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3313.">3313.</span></span>

And Isaac loved Esau, because his hunting was in his mouth. That this
signifies that the Divine good of the Divine rational loved the good of
truth, is evident from the representation of Isaac, as being the Lord's
Divine rational as to <span id="fr_91"></span>[3313-1](#fn_91.md) Divine
good (see n. 3012, 3013, 3194, 3210); and from the representation of
Esau, as being the Lord's Divine natural as to the good therein
(concerning which see also n. 3300, 3302); and from what follows
concerning Edom; and from the signification of "hunting" as being the
good of life from natural truths (see n. 3309). "In his mouth" signifies
that it was in His natural affection; for in the Word that is said to be
"in the heart" which is interior and proceeds from good, and that to be
"in the mouth" which is exterior and proceeds from truth; and as the
good of truth, which is here represented by Esau and is signified by
"hunting," is exterior good-that is, is in natural affection, and
proceeds from truth-therefore it is said to have been "in Isaac's
mouth."

<span class="margnote"><span id="3314.">3314.</span></span>

And Rebekah loved Jacob. That this signifies that the Divine truth of
the Divine rational loved the doctrine of truth, is evident from the
representation of Rebekah, as being the Divine truth of the Divine
rational (concerning which see n. 3012, 3013, 3077, and the whole
preceding chapter, where Rebekah is treated of); and from the
representation of Jacob, as being the doctrine of natural truth, and in
the supreme sense the Lord's Divine natural as to truth (see n. 3305).
That the Divine good of the Divine rational loved the good which was in
the natural, and the Divine truth of the Divine rational loved the truth
which was in the natural, stands thus; It is good and truth that
constitute the rational, and it is also good and truth that constitute
the natural; the good of the rational flows in without truth-thus
immediately-into the good of the natural; and also through truth, thus
mediately; whereas the good of the rational flows in through the truth
of the rational into the truth of the natural, thus mediately; and also
through the good of the natural into the truth there, thus also
immediately. Hence it is that there is a closer conjunction of the good
of the rational with the good of the natural, than with its truth; which
conjunction is signified by "Isaac loving Esau;" and that there is a
closer conjunction of the truth of the rational with the truth of the
natural, than with its good, which conjunction is signified by "Rebekah
loving Jacob." \[2\] These things are indeed such as can with difficulty
be apprehended, for the reason especially that the world, even the
learned world, is ignorant of the most general truths upon the
subject-as that the rational is distinct from the natural, and that it
is good and truth which constitute both the rational and the natural;
and still less is it known that the rational must flow into the natural
in order for man to be able to think, and to will as he thinks. As these
most general truths are unknown, the influx spoken of above can with
difficulty be comprehended; and yet these are matters in regard to which
the angels have light, and perceive things innumerable, and this
attended with the delight in which they are when it is given them at the
same time to think concerning the Lord's Divine in respect to the Human.
The man who is in good and in whom there is what is angelic while he is
in the body, is also gifted with some light from the Lord on these and
similar subjects; but he who is not in good feels a loathing when
thinking of such things, and the more so the more he thinks of them as
applied to the Divine that pertains to the Lord's Human. It is better
therefore that those who are of such a nature should remove their mind
from such subjects; for they comprehend nothing of them, and even reject
them; saying at heart, What is this to me? will bring me neither honors
nor gain.

Verses 29, 30. And Jacob boiled pottage, and Esau came from the field,
and he was weary. And Esau said to Jacob, Cause me to sup I pray of the
red, this red, for I am weary; therefore he called his name Edom. "And
Jacob boiled pottage," signifies a chaotic mass of doctrinal things;
"and Esau came from the field," signifies the pursuit of the good of
life; "and he was weary," signifies a state of combat; "and Esau said to
Jacob," signifies the Lord's perception from the good of the natural;
"Cause me to sup I pray of the red," signifies a longing for doctrinal
things; "this red," signifies that which is apparently good; "for I am
weary," signifies here as before a state of combat; "therefore he called
his name Edom," signifies his quality therefrom as to good, to which
were adjoined the doctrinal things of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3316.">3316.</span></span>

And Jacob boiled pottage. That this signifies a chaotic mass of
doctrinal things, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being
the doctrine of natural truth (n. 3305), thus the doctrinal things which
are in the natural man; and from the signification of "pottage," as
being a chaotic mass of such things. "Boiling it," signifies amassing,
for in the original tongue the expression is proper to pottage, as if it
had been said that he "pottaged pottage," that is, he amassed it. The
first state of the conjunction of good and truth is that which is
described in this and the following verses, down to the end of the
chapter. \[2\] The first state of the man who is being regenerated, or
in whom truth is being conjoined with good, is that first of all in his
natural man, or in its storehouse called the memory, there are amassed
the doctrinal things of truth without any certain order. The doctrinal
things at that time therein may be compared to some undigested and
uncompounded mass, and to a kind of chaos. But this is to the end that
they may be reduced to order, for whatever is to be reduced to order is
at first in this state of confusion; and this is what is signified by
the pottage which Jacob boiled, that is, amassed. These doctrinal things
are not reduced to order by themselves, but by the good which flows into
them, and the good reduces them into order in exact proportion to the
amount and the quality of its action upon them. When good first longs
for and desires these doctrinal things, to the end that it may conjoin
them with itself, it manifests itself under the appearance of the
affection of truth. This is what is signified by Esau's saying to Jacob,
"Cause me to sup I pray of the red, this red." \[3\] These things do
indeed appear remote from the sense of the letter; nevertheless, when
these words are read by man, and are apprehended by him according to the
sense of the letter, the angels who are then with him have no idea at
all of pottage, or of Jacob, or of Esau, or of what is red, or of
supping of what is red, but instead thereof they have a spiritual idea
which is altogether different and remote from such natural ideas, and
into this spiritual idea these natural things are instantly turned. It
is the same with other things in the Word; as for example when man reads
of bread, the angels have no perception of bread, but instantly instead
of bread they perceive celestial love and all that belongs thereto, that
is, to love to the Lord; and when wine is read of in the Word, they do
not perceive wine, but instead of wine spiritual love and all that
belongs thereto, that is, to love toward the neighbor. So when pottage
or pulse is read of, they do not perceive pottage or pulse, but
doctrinal things not yet conjoined with good, thus an inordinated mass
of them. This shows the nature and quality of the angelic thought and
perception, and how remote it is from the thought and perception of man.
If man thought in like manner when he is in a holy state, as when he
attends the Holy Supper, and instead of bread perceived love to the
Lord, and instead of wine love toward the neighbor, he would be in
thought and perception like that of the angels, who would then approach
nearer to him, till at last they could consociate their thoughts, but
only so far as the man was at the same time in good. \[4\] That
"pottage" or "pulse" signifies a chaotic mass, is evident also from what
is said in the book of Kings concerning the sons of the prophets and
Elisha: Elisha came back to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land;
and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him; and he said to his
lad, Set on the great pot and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets;
and one went out into the field to gather herbs, and he found a vine of
the field and gathered from it gourds of the field his garment full, and
came and shred them into the pot of pottage, because they knew not; and
they poured out to the men to eat; and it came to pass, in their eating
of the pottage, that they cried out and said, O man of God there is
death in the pot! And they could not eat; and he said, Take ye meal; and
he put it into the pot, and said, Pour out for the people; and they did
eat, and there was no evil word in the pot (2 Kings 4:38-41). In the
internal sense these words signify things altogether different from that
which they signify in the sense of the letter. A "famine in the land"
signifies a scarcity of the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1460); the
"sons of the prophets" signify those who teach (n. 2534); "pottage"
signifies an ill-assorted mass of memory-knowledges; and "meal," the
truth which is from good, or the spiritual which is from the celestial
(n. 2177); thus that Elisha put meal in the pot, and there was then no
evil in it, signifies that that chaotic mass was amended by means of
spiritual truth from the Lord's Word; for Elisha represented the Lord as
to the Word (n. 2762). Apart from this spiritual sense, this story
concerning the pottage and the change in it by the meal, would not have
been worthy of relation in the most holy Word. It was for the sake of
the representation of such things that this miracle was wrought, as also
is the case with the rest of the miracles in the Word, all of which have
Divine things concealed within them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3317.">3317.</span></span>

And Esau came from the field. That this signifies the pursuit of the
good of life, is evident from the representation of Esau, as being the
good of life of natural truth (concerning which see n. 3300); and from
the signification of "coming from the field," as being the pursuit of
good; for meditating in the field denotes cogitating in good (n. 3196),
because a "field" denotes the good of the church (n. 2971).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3318.">3318.</span></span>

And he was weary. That this signifies a state of combat, is evident from
the signification of "weary," or "weariness," as being the state after
combat; here, a state of combat, because the subject is the conjunction
of good with truth in the natural man. That "weary" here signifies a
state of combat, cannot appear except from the series of things in the
internal sense, and especially from the consideration that good cannot
be conjoined with truth in the natural man without combats, or what is
the same, without temptations. That it may be known how the case herein
is in respect to man, it shall be briefly told. \[2\] Man is nothing but
an organ, or vessel, which receives life from the Lord; for man does not
live from himself (n. 290, 1954, 2021, 2536, 2706, 2886-3001). The life
which inflows with man from the Lord is from His Divine love. This love,
or the life thence derived, inflows and applies itself to the vessels
which are in man's rational, and to those which are in his natural. In
consequence of the hereditary evil into which man is born, and of the
actual evil which he acquires, these vessels are in a contrary position
within him relatively to the inflowing life, yet insofar as the life
which flows in can dispose the vessels to receive it, it does so dispose
them. These vessels in the rational man, and in the natural, are what
are called truths, but in themselves they are merely perceptions of the
variations of form of these vessels, and of the changes of state
according to which in divers ways these variations come forth, being
effected in the most subtle substances, by methods inexpressible (n.
2487). Good itself, which has life from the Lord, or which is life, is
that which flows in and disposes. \[3\] When therefore these vessels,
which are to be varied as to forms, are as before said in a contrary
position and direction in respect to the life, it is evident that they
must be reduced to a position in accordance with the life, or into
compliance with it. This cannot possibly be effected so long as the man
is in that state into which he is born, and to which he has reduced
himself; for the vessels are not obedient, being obstinately resistant,
and hardening themselves against the heavenly order according to which
the life acts; for the good which moves them, and with which they
comply, is of the love of self and of the world; which good, from the
gross heat that is in it, causes them to be of such a quality; and
therefore before they can be rendered compliant and fit to receive
anything of the life of the Lord's love, they must be softened. This
softening is effected by no other means than temptations; for
temptations remove all that is of the love of self and of contempt for
others in comparison with self, consequently all that is of self-glory,
and also of hatred and revenge on this account. When therefore the
vessels have been somewhat tempered and subdued by temptations, they
begin to become yielding to, and compliant with, the life of the Lord's
love, which continually flows in with man. \[4\] Hence then it is that
good begins to be conjoined with truths; first in the rational man, and
afterwards in the natural; for as before said truths are nothing else
than perceptions of the variations of form according to states that are
continually being changed; and these perceptions are from the life which
flows in. This is the reason why man is regenerated, that is, made new,
by temptations; or what is the same, by spiritual combats; and that he
is afterwards gifted with another nature; being made mild, humble,
simple, and contrite in heart. From these considerations it may now be
seen what use temptations promote, namely, that good from the Lord may
not only flow in, but may also dispose the vessels to obedience, and
thus conjoin itself with them. That truths are vessels receptive of
good, may be seen above (n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269). Here
therefore, because the subject is the conjunction of good and truth in
the natural man, and the first of conjunction takes place by means of
combats, which are those of temptations, it is evident that by "he was
weary" is signified a state of combat. \[5\] But as regards the Lord,
who in the supreme sense is here treated of, He by the most grievous
temptation combats reduced all things in Himself into Divine order,
insomuch that there remained nothing at all of the human which He had
derived from the mother (n. 1444, 1573, 2159, 2574, 2649, 3036), so that
He was not made new as are other men, but altogether Divine. For the man
who is made new by regeneration still retains in himself an inclination
to evil, and even evil itself; but is withheld from evil by an influx of
the life of the Lord's love, and this with a force exceeding great;
whereas the Lord utterly cast out all the evil that was hereditary to
Him from the mother, and made Himself Divine, even as to the vessels,
that is, as to truths. This is that which in the Word is called
"glorification."

And Esau said to Jacob. That this signifies the Lord's perception from
the good of the natural, is evident from the signification of "saying,"
as being to perceive (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080,
2862); and from the representation of Esau, as being the Lord as to the
good of the natural (see n. 3300, 3302, and below concerning Edom); and
from the representation of Jacob, as being the truth of the natural (n.
3305), concerning which there is now perception.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3320.">3320.</span></span>

Cause me to sup I pray of the red, this red. That this signifies a
longing for doctrinal things, and that this red signifies that which is
apparently good, is evident from the signification of "supping," as
being to be communicated and conjoined (see n. 3089); and therefore
"cause me to sup I pray" signifies to long for the conjunction with
himself of truth or of doctrinal things; and from the signification of
"red" as being good (see n. 3300); here, what is apparently good,
because doctrinal things however disposed appear in the external form as
good, although inwardly they are but a chaotic mass (n. 3316). The
reason why these things are mentioned, is also that it was from this
that Esau had the name Edom, for in the original tongue "red" is "Edom;"
and this in order that by "Edom" may be signified the good to which are
adjoined the doctrinal things of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3321.">3321.</span></span>

For I am weary. That this signifies a state of combat, is evident from
the signification of "weary," or of "weariness," as being a state of
combat (see n. 3318). Mention is here again made of being weary, for the
sake of confirmation that the conjunction of good with truth in the
natural is effected by spiritual combats, that is, by temptations. In
regard to the conjunction of good with truth in the natural, the case in
general is this: Man's rational receives truths before his natural; and
this to the end that the Lord's life, which as before said is of love,
may flow in through the rational into the natural, and dispose the
natural, and reduce it to obedience. For the rational is purer, and the
natural grosser; or what is the same, the rational is interior and the
natural exterior; and as may be known it is according to order that the
interior or purer can flow into the exterior or grosser, but not the
reverse. \[2\] Hence it is that man's rational can be accommodated to
truths and receive them before his natural, as may be plainly seen from
the fact that with one who is to be regenerated the rational man battles
much with the natural; or what is the same, the internal man with the
external. For as also is known, the internal man can see truths and also
will them, but the external refuses assent and resists; for in the
natural man there are memory-knowledges which are in a great measure
derived from the fallacies of the senses, and which notwithstanding
their being false the man believes to be true; there are also things
innumerable which the natural man does not apprehend; for he is
relatively in shade and thick darkness, and that which he does not
apprehend, he believes either not to exist, or not to be so; there are
likewise cupidities which are of the love of self and of the world, and
all things that favor these he calls truths; and when the man yields to
these the dominion, all things that result are contrary to spiritual
truths. There are also in the natural man reasonings that are grounded
in falsities impressed from infancy. Moreover, man apprehends by
manifest sense what is in his natural man, but not so what is in his
rational, until he has put off the body. This also causes him to believe
the body to be everything; and all that does not fall into the natural
sense, he scarcely believes to be anything. \[3\] From such causes and
many others, it results that the natural man receives truths much later,
and with greater difficulty, than does the rational man. Hence arises
combat, which continues for a considerable time, not ceasing until the
vessels recipient of good in the natural man have been softened by
temptations, as before shown (n. 3318); for truths are nothing but
vessels recipient of good (n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261, 2269), which
vessels are harder in proportion as man is more fixedly confirmed in the
things which have been mentioned; and if the man is to be regenerated,
the more fixedly he has been confirmed, the more grievous is the combat.
As the case with the natural man is such that the conjunction of truths
with good therein is effected through the combats of temptations, it is
therefore here repeated, "I am weary."

<span class="margnote"><span id="3322.">3322.</span></span>

Therefore he called his name Edom. That this signifies his quality
therefrom as to good, to which were adjoined the doctrinal things of
truth, is evident from the signification of "calling a name," or of
"calling by name," as being the quality (see n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896,
2009, 2724, 3006); and from the representation of Edom. There is
frequent mention in the Word of Esau, and also of Edom; and by "Esau" is
there signified the good of the natural before the doctrinal things of
truth have been thus conjoined with this good, and also the good of life
from influx out of the rational; and by "Edom" is signified the good of
the natural to which have been adjoined the doctrinal things of truth.
But in the opposite sense, "Esau" signifies the evil of the love of self
before falsities have been thus adjoined to this love; and "Edom"
signifies the evil of this love when falsities have been adjoined to it.
As has been frequently shown, most names in the Word have also an
opposite sense, because the same things that in the churches have been
good and true, in process of time through various adulterations
degenerate into what is evil and false. \[2\] That such things are
signified by "Esau" and "Edom" may be seen from the following passages.
In Isaiah: Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
Bozrah? this that is glorious in His apparel, marching in the multitude
of His strength. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and Thy
garments like him that treadeth in the wine-press? I have trodden the
wine-press alone, and of the peoples there was no man with Me. I looked,
but there was none to help, I was amazed that there was none to uphold,
and Mine own arm brought salvation unto Me (Isa. 63:1, 3, 5); where it
is clearly evident that "Edom" is the Lord; and that it is the Lord as
to the Divine good of the Divine natural is manifest, for the subject is
the conjunction of good and truth in the Lord's Human, and also the
temptation combats by which He conjoined them. That "garments" here are
the truths of the natural man, or truths relatively inferior, may be
seen above (n. 2576); and that "red" is the good of the natural (n.
3300). That the Lord by His own power, through temptation combats,
conjoined truths in the natural with good, is described by, "I have
trodden the wine-press alone, and of the peoples there was no man with
Me. I looked but there was none to help, I was amazed that there was
none to uphold, and Mine own arm brought salvation unto Me." (That "arm"
denotes power, see above, n. 878.) \[3\] In the book of Judges: O
Jehovah when Thou wentest forth out of Seir, when Thou marchedst out of
the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the heavens also dropped, the
clouds also dropped water; the mountains flowed down (Judg. 5:4-5); to
"march out of the field of Edom" signifies nearly the same as, in
Isaiah, to "come out of Edom." In like manner in Moses: Jehovah came
from Sinai, and rose from Seir unto them (Deut. 33:2). Again: I see Him,
but not now; I behold Him, but not nigh; there shall come up a star out
of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel; and Edom shall be a
possession, Seir also shall be a possession of his enemies, while Israel
doeth valiantly. And he shall have dominion over Jacob, and shall
destroy the remnant from the city (Num. 24:17-19); treating of the
coming of the Lord into the world, whose Human Essence is called a "star
out of Jacob," and a "scepter out of Israel." "Edom" and "Seir," which
should be a "possession," signify the Divine good of the Lord's Divine
natural; their being the "possession of his enemies" signifies that this
should succeed in the place of those things which were before in the
natural; dominion then over truths therein is meant by "having dominion
over Jacob, and destroying the remnant from the city." (That "Jacob"
signifies the truth of the natural, see above, n. 3305; and that "city"
signifies what is doctrinal, n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2712, 2943, 3216.)
Dominion is said to be had over these when they are subordinated and
subjected to good; for before this they are called "enemies," because
they continually resist, as was shown above (n. 3321). \[4\] In Amos: In
that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and
close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will
build it as in the days of eternity; that they may possess the remnant
of Edom, and all the nations that were called by My name (Amos 9:11-12);
the "tabernacle of David" denotes the church and worship of the Lord;
the "remnant of Edom," those who are in good within the church; the
"nations that were called by His name," those who are in good out of the
church. (That "nations" are those who are in good, see above, n. 1259,
1260, 1416, 1849.) In David: Upon Edom will I cast my shoe. Who will
bring me into the fortified city? Who will lead me unto Edom? Wilt not
Thou, O God? (Ps. 60:8, 10); where "Edom" denotes the good of the
natural, as is evident from the signification of "shoe," as being the
lowest natural (n. 1748). \[5\] In Daniel: At the time of the end shall
the king of the south thrust at him; and the king of the north shall
rush upon him like a whirlwind with a chariot, and shall overflow and
pass through; and when he shall come into the beauteous land many shall
be overthrown; but these shall be rescued out of his hand, Edom and
Moab, and the firstfruits of the sons of Ammon (Dan. 11:40-41); where
the last state of the church is treated of; the "king of the north"
denotes falsities, or what is the same, those who are in falsities;
"Edom," those who are in simple good, which is such good as exists with
those who constitute the Lord's external church; in like manner "Moab"
and the "sons of Ammon" (n. 2468); and because both, namely, "Edom" and
"Moab," signify those who are in good, therefore in many passages both
are named together; but the difference is that "Edom" is the good of the
natural to which are adjoined the doctrinal things of truth, while
"Moab" is natural good such as exists with those in whom these have not
been conjoined; the two appear alike in the external form, but not in
the internal. \[6\] From this it is now evident why it was said: Thou
shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor
an Egyptian, because thou wast a sojourner in his land (Deut. 23:7); as
by an "Edomite" is signified the good of the natural, and by an
"Egyptian," the truths thereof which are those of memory-knowledge (n.
1164, 1165, 1186, 1462), therefore both are mentioned in a good sense.
This shows why Jehovah said to Moses that they should not contend <span
id="fr_92"></span>[3322-1](#fn_92.md) with the sons of Esau, and there
should not be given of their land to the sons of Jacob so much as for
the sole of the foot to tread upon (Deut. 2:4-6). \[7\] But in the
opposite sense by "Esau" and "Edom" are represented those who turn aside
from good through the fact that they altogether despise truth, and are
unwilling that anything of the truth of faith should be adjoined, which
is chiefly owing to the love of self; and therefore in the opposite
sense such persons are signified by "Esau" and "Edom;" as was also
represented by the circumstance that the king of Edom went forth with a
numerous people and a strong hand, and refused to permit Israel to pass
through his border (Num. 20:14-22). This evil of the love of self, which
is of such a nature as not to admit the truths of faith, thus neither
the doctrinal things of truth, is described in various passages of the
Word by "Esau" and "Edom," and at the same time the state of the church
when it becomes of this quality; as in Jeremiah: Against Edom. Is wisdom
no more in Teman? Is counsel perished from the intelligent? Is their
wisdom become of an ill savor? Flee ye; they have turned themselves
away, they have gone into the deep to dwell, inhabitants of Dedan; for I
will bring the calamity of Esau upon him. I will make Esau bare, I will
reveal his hidden things, and he shall not be able to hide himself; his
seed is laid waste, and his brethren, and his neighbors. Leave thy
fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and let thy widows
trust in Me. Edom shall become a waste, everyone that passeth by it
shall be amazed, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof (Jer. 49:7-8,
10-11, 17). \[8\] In David: They say, Let the name of Israel be no more
in remembrance; for they consult together with one heart; against thee
do they make a covenant, the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab,
and the Hagarenes (Ps. 83:4-6). In Obadiah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovih
concerning Edom, Behold I have made thee small among the nations; thou
art greatly despised. The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, O
thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, in the height of thy
habitation; that saith in thine heart, Who shall bring me down to the
earth? Though thou mount on high as the eagle, and though thou settest
thy nest among the stars, I will bring thee down from thence. How are
they of Esau searched out! their hidden things discovered! Shall I not
in that day destroy the wise men out of Edom, and the intelligent from
the mount of Esau? From the slaughter on account of the violence of thy
brother Jacob shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off forever.
The house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and
the house of Esau for stubble; and they shall enkindle them, and devour
them; and there shall not be any residue to the house of Esau; and they
of the south shall possess the mount of Esau (Obad. 1:1-10, 18-19). In
this passage "Esau" and "Edom" denote the evil of the natural man
originating in the love of self, which despises and rejects all truth,
whence comes its devastation. \[9\] In Ezekiel: Son of man, set thy face
against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it, and say unto it, Thus saith
the Lord Jehovih, I am against thee, O Mount Seir, and I will stretch
out Mine hand against thee, and I will make thee a waste and a
devastation. Because thou hast had an enmity of eternity, and hast given
over the sons of Israel to the hands of the sword, in the time of their
calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end. Because thou hast
said, These two nations, and these two lands, shall be mine, and we will
possess it, and Jehovah is there. And thou shalt know that I Jehovah
have heard all thy blasphemies, which thou hast spoken against the
mountains of Israel. Thou shalt be a waste, O Mount Seir and all Edom,
all of it (Ezek. 35:2-3, 5, 10, 12, 15); where it is very evident that
in the opposite sense "Edom" denotes those who despise, reject, and
vilify spiritual goods and truths, which are the "mountains of Israel."
\[10\] Again: Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, If I have not spoken in the
fire of My jealousy against the remains of the nations, and against all
Edom, which have given My land unto themselves for a possession, with
the joy of all their heart, with despite of soul (Ezek. 36:5); where the
sense is the same; to "give the land unto themselves for a possession"
denotes to vastate the church, that is, the good and truth of the
church. \[11\] In Malachi: The word of Jehovah against Israel. I have
loved you, saith Jehovah; yet ye say, Wherein hast Thou loved us? Is not
Esau Jacob's brother? Yet I loved Jacob, but Esau I hated, and I make
his mountain a waste (Mal. 1:1-3); where "Esau" denotes the evil of the
natural that does not admit spiritual truth which is "Israel" (n. 3305),
and what is doctrinal of truth which is "Jacob" (n. 3305); and on this
account he is vastated, which is being "hated" (that "hating" is nothing
else, is manifest from what was adduced above from the Word concerning
Esau and Edom in a good sense); but when truth does not suffer itself to
be adjoined to good, then evil is on the other hand predicated of Jacob,
as in Hosea: To visit upon Jacob according to his ways; according to his
works will He recompense him; in the womb he supplanted his brother
(Hos. 12:2-3).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3323.">3323.</span></span>

Verses 31-33. And Jacob said, Sell me as this day thy birthright. And
Esau said, Behold I am going to die, and for what is this birthright to
me? And Jacob said, Swear to me as this day; and he sware unto him, and
he sold his birthright unto Jacob. "And Jacob said," signifies the
doctrine of truth; "sell me as this day thy birthright," signifies that
as to time the doctrine of truth was apparently prior; "and Esau said,
Behold I am going to die," signifies that he would afterwards rise
again; "and for what is this birthright to me," signifies that in this
case there would be no need of priority; "and Jacob said," signifies the
doctrine of truth; "swear to me as this day, and he swore unto him"
signifies confirmation; "and he sold his birthright unto Jacob,"
signifies that in the meantime priority was granted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3324.">3324.</span></span>

And Jacob said. That this signifies the doctrine of truth, is evident
from the representation of Jacob, as being the doctrine of natural truth
(n. 3305); or what is the same, those who are in the doctrine of truth.
In these verses down to the end of this chapter, the subject treated of
is the right of priority, as to whether it is of truth or of good; or
what is the same, whether it is of the doctrine of truth or of the life
of good; or what is still the same, whether it is of faith insofar as
this is truth of doctrine, or whether it is of charity insofar as this
is good of life. When man draws a conclusion from natural perception, he
believes that faith, insofar as it is truth of doctrine, is prior to
charity insofar as this is good of life, because he perceives how the
truth of doctrine enters, but not how the good of life; for the former
enters by an external, that is, a sensuous way, while the latter enters
by an internal way; and also because he cannot know otherwise than that
as truth teaches what is good, it is prior to good; and also because the
reformation of man is effected through truth and according to truth,
insomuch that man is perfected as to good in proportion to the amount of
truth that can be conjoined with it, consequently good is perfected
through truth; and what is more, because man can be in truth, and think
and speak from it, and this with apparent zeal, although he is not at
the same time in good; yea, he may even from truth be confident of his
salvation. These and many other considerations lead man to suppose, when
judging from the sensuous and natural man, that the truth which is of
faith is prior to the good which is of charity; but all these are
reasonings from fallacies, based on the appearance to the sensuous and
natural man. \[2\] The good itself which is of life is prior; the good
which is of life being the very ground in which truths are to be sown;
and such as is the ground, such is the reception of the seeds, that is,
of the truths of faith. Truths may indeed be first stored up in the
memory, like seeds in a granary, or with birds in their crops; but they
do not belong to the man unless the ground is prepared; and such as is
the ground, that is, such as is the good, such is their germination and
fructification. But see on this subject what has been already shown in
many places, which will be here cited in order that it may be known what
good is and what truth, and that the priority belongs to good and not to
truth: \[3\] Why there is no distinctive idea as between good and truth
(n. 2507). That good flows in by an internal way unknown to man, while
truth is procured by an external way known to man (n. 3030, 3098). That
truths are vessels recipient of good (n. 1496, 1832, 1900, 2063, 2261,
2269, 3068, 3318). That good acknowledges its truth, with which it may
be conjoined (n. 3101, 3102, 3179); and that most exquisite exploration
is made and precaution taken lest falsity be conjoined with good, and
truth with evil (n. 3033, 3101, 3102). That good makes for itself the
truth with which it may be conjoined, because it does not acknowledge
anything as truth except that which agrees with it (n. 3161). That truth
is nothing else than that which is from good (n. 2434). \[4\] That truth
is the form of good (n. 3049). That truth has in itself an image of
good; and in good the very effigy of itself from which it exists (n.
3180). That the seed which is truth is rooted in the good which is of
charity (n. 880). That faith is impossible except in its life, that is,
in love and charity (379, 389, 654, 724, 1608, 2343, 2349). That from
love and charity man can look to the truths which pertain to the
doctrinal things of faith, but not the reverse; and that to look from
faith, and not from love and charity, is to look behind one's self, and
to turn back (n. 2454). That truth is made alive in accordance with the
good of each person, thus in accordance with the state of innocence and
charity in man (n. 1776, 3111). That the truths of faith can be received
only by those who are in good (n. 2343, 2349). That they who are in no
charity cannot acknowledge the Lord, thus not any truth of faith; and
that if they profess such acknowledgment, it is something external
without an internal, or is from hypocrisy (n. 2354). That there is no
faith where there is no charity (n. 654, 1162, 1176, 2429). That wisdom,
intelligence, and memory-knowledge are the sons of charity (n. 1226).
That the angels are in intelligence and wisdom because they are in love
(n. 2500, 2572). \[5\] That angelic life consists in the goods of
charity, and that the angels are forms of charity (n. 454, 553). That
love to the Lord is a "likeness" of Him, and charity toward the neighbor
an "image" of Him (n. 1013). That through love to the Lord the angels
perceive whatever is of faith (n. 202). That nothing lives except love
and affection (n. 1589). That they who have mutual love, or charity,
have the Lord's life (n. 1799, 1803). That love to the Lord and the
neighbor is heaven itself (n. 1802, 1824, 2057, 2130-2131). That the
presence of the Lord is according to the state of love and charity (n.
904). That all the commandments of the Decalogue, and all things of
faith, are in charity (n. 1121, 1798). That knowledge of the doctrinal
things of faith effects nothing unless the man has charity, for
doctrinal things look to charity as their end (n. 2049, 2116). That
neither the acknowledgment of truth, nor faith, is possible unless the
man is in good (n. 2261). That the holy of worship is according to the
quality and quantity of the truth of faith implanted in charity (n.
2190). \[6\] That there is no salvation by faith, but by the life of
faith, which is charity (n. 2228, 2261). That the heavenly kingdom is
given to those who have the faith of charity (n. 1608). That in heaven
all are regarded from their charity and the derivative faith (n. 1258).
That none are admitted into heaven except by willing good from the heart
(n. 2401). That they are saved who are in faith, provided that in their
faith there is good (n. 2261, 2442). That the faith which has not been
implanted in the good of life altogether perishes in the other life (n.
2228). That if the faith of thought were saving, all would be brought
into heaven; but because the life opposes they cannot be brought in (n.
2363). That they who hold as a principle that faith alone saves,
contaminate truths by the falsity of this principle (n. 2383, 2385).
That the fruit of faith is good work, good work is charity, charity is
love to the Lord, love to the Lord is the Lord (n. 1873). That the
fruits of faith are fruits of the good which is of love and charity (n.
3146). \[7\] That the trust or confidence which is said to be saving
faith is not possible except with those who are in the good of life (n.
2982). That good is the life of truth (n. 1589). When it is that truths
are said to have gained life (n. 1928). That good from the Lord flows
into truths of every kind, but it is of the greatest importance that
they should be genuine truths (n. 2531). That good and truth from the
Lord flow in just in proportion as that which is evil and false is
removed (n. 2411, 3142, 3147). That good cannot flow into truth so long
as the man is in evil (n. 2388). That truth is not truth until it is
accepted by good (n. 2429). That there is a marriage of good and of
truth in things all and each (n. 2173, 2503, 2507). That the affection
of good is of life, and the affection of truth is for the sake of life
(n. 2455). That truth tends to good, and proceeds from good (n. 2063).
\[8\] That by influx truths are called forth out of the natural man,
elevated, and implanted in good in the rational man (n. 3085, 3086).
That when truth is conjoined with a man, it is appropriated to him (n.
3108). That in order that truth may be conjoined with good, there must
be consent by the understanding and by the will, and when by the will,
then conjunction takes place (n. 3157, 3158). That the rational as to
truth is acquired by means of knowledges; and that truths are
appropriated when they are conjoined with good; and that they are then
of the will, and for the sake of life (n. 3161). That truth is not at
once initiated and conjoined with good, but during the whole life, and
also afterwards (n. 3200). That as light without heat produces nothing,
so the truth of faith produces nothing without the good of love (n.
3146). What the idea of truth without good is; and what its light is in
the other life (n. 2228). That faith separated is like the light of
winter; and faith from charity like the light of spring (n. 2231). That
they who in act separate truth, which is faith, from charity, cannot
have conscience (n. 1076, 1077). The reason why men have separated faith
from charity, and have declared that faith saves (n. 2231). \[9\] That
during man's regeneration the Lord insinuates good into the truths that
are in him (n. 2183, 2189). That man is not regenerated by means of
truth, but by means of good (n. 989, 2146, 2183, 2189, 2697). That
during man's regeneration the Lord goes to meet and fills with the good
of charity the truths that are in him (n. 2063). That they who are in
the good of life, and not in the truth of faith, as is the case with
Gentiles and infants, receive the truths of faith in the other life, and
are regenerated (n. 989); concerning the Gentiles (n. 932, 1032, 2049,
2284, 2589-2604); concerning infants (n. 2290-2293, 2302-2304). That man
is regenerated by means of the affection of truth; and that when he is
regenerated he acts from the affection of good (n. 1904). That in one
about to be regenerated the seed can take root only in good (n. 880,
989). That the light of a regenerate man is from charity (n. 854). That
the same truths in one person may be true, in another less true, and in
others may even be falsities, and that this is according to the good
which is of the life (n. 2439). What the difference is between the good
of infancy, the good of ignorance, and the good of intelligence (n.
2280). Who can come into the knowledges of truth and into faith, and who
cannot (n. 2689). \[10\] That the church is not a church unless the
truths of doctrine are implanted in the good of life (n. 3310). That
what is doctrinal does not make the church, but charity (n. 809, 916,
1798, 1799, 1834, 1844). That the doctrinal things of a church are
nothing, unless its members live according to them (n. 1515). That the
doctrine of faith is the doctrine of charity (n. 2571). That the church
is from charity, and not from faith separated (n. 916). That everyone
may know from charity whether he has the internal of worship (n. 1102,
1151, 1153). That the church of the Lord throughout the world is
everywhere various as to truths, but that it is one through charity (n.
3267). That the church would be one if all had charity, even though its
members differed as to ritual and doctrinal matters (n. 809, 1285, 1316,
1798, 1799, 1834, 1844). That out of many would be made one church, if
all accounted charity and not faith as being that which is essential of
the church (n. 2982). That there are two kinds of doctrinal things, the
doctrinal things of charity and the doctrinal things of faith; and that
in the Ancient Church there were the doctrinal things of charity, which
at this day are among the things that are lost (n. 2417). \[11\] In what
ignorance of truth they are who are not in the doctrinal things of
charity (n. 2435). And whereas at this day faith is made the essential
of the church, men do not even see, nor attend to the things the Lord so
often said concerning love and charity (n. 1017, 2373). That the good
which is of love to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor, is
superior and prior to the truth which is of faith; and not the reverse
(n. 363, 364).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3325.">3325.</span></span>

Sell me as this day thy birthright. That this signifies that as to time
the doctrine of truth was apparently prior, is evident from the
signification of "selling," as being to claim for one's self; and from
the signification of "as this day," meaning as to time, for in the
internal sense of the Word "this day" signifies that which is perpetual
and eternal (n. 2838); and in order that it might not be so in the
present case, it is said "as this day," thus by "as" it becomes only
apparently so; and from the signification of "birthright," as being
prior, namely that the doctrine of truth, which is represented by Jacob,
is so (n. 3305). \[2\] By prior, or priority, which is signified by
"birthright," is meant not only priority of time, but also priority of
degree; that is, as to which should have the dominion, good or truth.
For such is always truth before it has been conjoined with good, or what
is the same, such are always those who are in truth, that before they
are regenerate they believe truth to be both prior and superior to good,
and so indeed it then appears. But when in them truth has been conjoined
with good, that is, when they have been regenerated, they then see and
perceive that truth is posterior and inferior; and then in them good has
dominion over truth, which is signified by what Isaac his father said to
Esau: Behold of the fatness of the earth shall be thy dwelling, and of
the dew of heaven from above; and on thy sword shalt thou live, and thou
shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have
the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck (Gen.
27:39-40). \[3\] But as within the church there are more not being
regenerated than being regenerated; and as they who are not being
regenerated draw conclusions from the appearance, therefore there has
been a dispute even from ancient times as to whether the priority
belongs to truth or to good. With those who have not been regenerated,
and also with those who have not been fully regenerated, the opinion has
prevailed that truth is prior, for as yet they have no perception of
good; and so long as anyone has no perception of good, he is in shade or
in ignorance in relation to these things. But they who have been
regenerated, being in good itself, are able from the consequent
intelligence and wisdom to observe what good is, and that it is from the
Lord, and that it flows in through the internal man into the external,
and this continually, the man being altogether unconscious of it; and
that it adjoins itself to the truths of doctrinal things that are in the
memory; consequently that in itself good is prior, although before it
had not appeared so. Such then was the source of the dispute concerning
the priority and superiority of the one over the other which was
represented by Esau and Jacob; and also by Perez and Zarah, the sons of
Judah by Tamar (Gen. 38:28-30); afterwards also by Ephraim and Manasseh
the sons of Joseph (Gen. 48:13-14, 17-20); and this because the
spiritual church is of such a nature that it must be introduced through
truth into good, and at this time be devoid of the perception of good,
except such and so much as lies concealed in the affection of truth, at
which time good cannot be discriminated from the delight of the love of
self and of the world, which is at the same time in that affection, and
is believed to be good. \[4\] But that good is the firstborn (that is,
the good of love to the Lord, and of love toward the neighbor, for there
is no other good than that which is good from these loves) is evident
from the fact that there is life in good, but none in truth except the
life which is from good; and that good flows into truths and causes them
to live may sufficiently appear from what has been stated and shown
above concerning good and truth (n. 3324). Wherefore all are called
"firstborn" who are in love to the Lord and in charity toward the
neighbor, and these were also represented in the Jewish Church by what
is firstborn, that is, they are meant by it in the relative sense,
because the Lord is the Firstborn, and all that are firstborn are His
likenesses and images. \[5\] That the Lord as to the Divine Human is the
Firstborn, is evident from David: He shall call unto Me, Thou art my
Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation. I also will make him the
firstborn, high above the kings of the earth. My mercy will I keep for
him for evermore, and My covenant shall be faithful with him. His seed
also will I make to endure forever, and his throne as the days of the
heavens <span id="fr_93"></span>[3325-1](#fn_93) (Ps. 89:26-29.md); where
the Lord is treated of. And in John: From Jesus Christ who is the
faithful witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the prince of the kings
of the earth (Rev. 1:5). In order that all that had been written and
represented concerning Him might be fulfilled, He was likewise by birth
the firstborn (Luke 2:7, 22-23). \[6\] That they too, as being His
images and likenesses, are called the "firstborn" of the Lord who are in
love to Him and in charity toward the neighbor, is evident in John: The
hundred and forty and four thousand bought from the earth: these are
they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins; these are
they who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth; these were bought from
among men, the firstfruits (firstborn) unto God and the Lamb. And in
their mouth was found no guile; for they are without spot before the
throne of God (Rev. 14:3-5). The "hundred and forty and four," or twelve
times twelve, denote those who are in the faith of charity (n. 3272);
"thousands" denote those who are innumerable, that is, all such (n.
2575); "virgins" denote the good of love to the Lord and of charity
toward the neighbor (n. 2362, 3081), thus those who are in innocence,
which is also signified by "following the Lamb;" for the Lord is called
"the Lamb" from innocence. Hence they are said to be the "firstfruits,"
or firstborn. \[7\] From the above passages it is manifest that the Lord
as to the Divine Human was represented in the Jewish Church by that
which was firstborn; and also they who are in love to Him, for these are
in the Lord. But what is firstborn has in the Word a twofold
representation, representing the Lord both as to Divine celestial love,
and as to Divine spiritual love. The Lord's Divine celestial love is
relative to the celestial church, or to those who are of this church and
are called celestial from love to the Lord; the Lord's Divine spiritual
love is relative to the spiritual church, or to those who are of this
church and are called spiritual from love toward the neighbor. The
Lord's Divine love is toward all, but inasmuch as it is variously
received by men, in one way by the celestial man and in another by the
spiritual man, it is said to be relative. \[8\] Concerning the firstborn
that represented the Lord as to Divine celestial love, and also those
relatively who were of the celestial church, it is thus written in
Moses: The firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me. Likewise shalt
thou do with thine oxen and with thy flock; seven days it shall be with
its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it Me; and ye shall be men of
holiness unto Me (Exod. 22:29-31); that it should be seven days with the
dam, was because the "seventh day" signified the celestial man (n.
84-87); and because from this "seven" signified what is holy (n. 395,
433, 716, 881); that it should be given to Jehovah on the eighth day,
was because the "eighth day" signified what was continuous from a new
beginning, namely, what was continuous of love (n. 2044). Again: The
firstling among beasts which is made a firstling to Jehovah, no man
shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep it is Jehovah's (Lev.
27:26). Again: The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which
they bring unto Jehovah, shall be for thee (Aaron). Everything that
openeth the womb of all flesh which they offer unto Jehovah, both of man
and beast, shall be thine. Nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou
surely redeem; and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
The firstling of an ox, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of
a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy; thou shalt sprinkle their
blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by
fire for an odor of rest to Jehovah (Num. 18:13, 15, 17). Again: All the
firstling males that are born of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt
sanctify unto Jehovah thy God; thou shalt do no work with the firstling
of thine ox, nor shear the firstling of thy flock. If it have any
blemish, as if it be lame or blind, any evil blemish whatsoever, thou
shalt not sacrifice it unto Jehovah thy God (Deut. 15:19, 21). \[9\]
Inasmuch as the firstborn represented the Lord, and those who are the
Lord's by virtue of love to Him, therefore the tribe of Levi was
accepted instead of every firstborn, and this because Levi represented
the Lord as to love. "Levi" also signifies love, for "Levi" is
"adhesion" and "conjunction," and in the internal sense adhesion and
conjunction are love, on which subject of the Lord's Divine mercy
hereafter (at chapter 29, verse 34). Concerning the Levites it is
written in Moses: Jehovah spake to Moses, saying, And I behold I will
take the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel instead of all the
firstborn that openeth the womb among the sons of Israel, and the
Levites shall be Mine; for all the firstborn are Mine; in the day that I
smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I hallowed unto Me all the
firstborn in Israel, from man even to beast; Mine they shall be (Num.
3:11-13). Again: Jehovah said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn males
of the sons of Israel, from the son of a month and upward, and take the
number of their names. And thou shalt take the Levites for Me (I am
Jehovah) instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the
beast of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the beast of
the sons of Israel (Num. 3:40-41, etc.; also Num. 8:14, 16-18); and it
is said (Num. 8:19) that the Levites were given to Aaron, because Aaron
represented the Lord as to the priesthood, that is, as to the Divine
love. (That the priesthood represented the Lord's Divine love may be
seen above, n. 1728, 2015.) \[10\] But concerning the firstborn who
represented the Lord as to Divine spiritual love, and also those
relatively who are of the spiritual church, it is written in Jeremiah:
They shall come with weeping, and with prayers will I lead them; I will
bring them to fountains of waters, in the way of what is upright,
wherein they shall not stumble; and I will be to Israel for a father,
and Ephraim shall be My firstborn (Jer. 31:9); where a new spiritual
church is treated of, "Israel" denoting spiritual good; "Ephraim,"
spiritual truth, who is called the "firstborn" because a church about to
be planted is treated of, in which the intellectual which is of truth is
apparently the firstborn; for Ephraim succeeded in the place of Reuben,
and was made the firstborn (Gen. 48:5, 20; 1 Chron. 5:1); and this
because by Joseph, whose sons were Ephraim and Manasseh, was represented
the Lord as to Divine spiritual love. But that "Israel" is essentially
the "firstborn," that is, denotes spiritual good, is evident from Moses:
Jehovah said to Moses, Thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah,
Israel is My son, My firstborn, and I have said unto thee, Let My son
go, that he may serve Me; and thou hast refused to let him go; behold I
will slay thy son, thy firstborn (Exod. 4:21-23); where "Israel" in the
supreme sense signifies the Lord as to Divine spiritual love, but in the
relative sense those who are in spiritual love, that is, in charity
toward the neighbor. \[11\] In the spiritual church, in the beginning,
or when it is about to be planted, the doctrine of truth is the
firstborn with the external church, and the truth of doctrine is the
firstborn with the internal church; or what is the same, the doctrine of
faith is the firstborn with the external church, and faith itself with
the internal church. But when the church has been planted, that is, in
those with whom it exists in life and practice, the good of charity is
the firstborn with the external church, and charity itself with the
internal. But when the church does not suffer itself to be planted, as
is the case when the man of the church can no longer be regenerated, by
successive steps it recedes from charity and turns away to faith, being
no longer studious of life but of doctrine; and when this is the case it
casts itself into shades and falls into falsities and evils, and thus
becomes no church, and is of itself extinguished. This was represented
by Cain, in that he slew his brother Abel. (That "Cain" is faith
separate from charity, and that "Abel" is charity, which he
extinguished, may be seen above, n. 340, 342, 357, 362.) The same was
afterwards represented by Ham and his son Canaan, in that he mocked at
his father Noah (n. 1062, 1063, 1076, 1140, 1141, 1162, 1179);
afterwards by Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, in that he defiled his
father's bed (Gen. 35:22); and lastly by Pharaoh and the Egyptians, in
that they ill-treated the sons of Israel. That all of these were cursed
is evident from the Word. Concerning Cain it is said: Jehovah said, What
hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the
ground; and now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother's bloods from thy hand (Gen. 4:10-11).
Concerning Ham and Canaan: Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of
his father, and told his two brethren. And Noah awoke from his wine, and
he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his
brethren (Gen. 9:22, 24-25). And concerning Reuben: Reuben, thou art my
firstborn, my strength, and the beginning of my power, excellent in
honor, and excellent in might; unstable as water, thou shalt not excel
because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, then defiledst thou my
couch (Gen. 49:3-4); and therefore he was deprived of the birthright (1
Chron. 5:1). \[12\] That the same was represented by Pharaoh and the
Egyptians, and that therefore their firstborn and firstborn beasts were
slain, is evident from their representation, as being memory-knowledges
(n. 1164, 1165, 1186), by which-when man enters into the arcana of
faith, and no longer believes anything but that which he can apprehend
in accordance with the senses and memory-knowledge-he then perverts and
extinguishes the things of the doctrine of faith, and especially the
things of charity. This is what is represented in the internal sense by
the firstborn of men and firstborn of beasts in Egypt being slain,
concerning which it is written in Moses: I will pass through the land of
Egypt in that night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of
Egypt, from man even to beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will
execute judgments; I am Jehovah. And the blood shall be to you for a
sign upon the houses where ye are, and when I see the blood I will pass
over you, and there shall no plague be upon you for a destroyer, when I
smite the land of Egypt (Exod. 12:12-13); the "firstborn of Egypt"
denotes the doctrine of faith and of charity which as before said is
perverted by means of memory-knowledges; the "gods of Egypt" on whom
judgments were to be executed, are falsities; there being "no plague as
a destroyer where blood was upon the houses," signifies in the supreme
sense where the Lord is as to Divine spiritual love, and in the relative
sense, where spiritual love is, that is, charity toward the neighbor (n.
1001). \[13\] Moreover concerning Pharaoh and the Egyptians it is thus
written: Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah, About midnight I will go out
into the midst of Egypt; and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt
shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sitteth upon the throne,
unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all
the firstborn of beast. And against any of the sons of Israel shall not
a dog move his tongue, from man even to beast (Exod. 11:4-7). And again:
It came to pass at midnight that Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the
land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne,
unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the house of the pit; and
all the firstborn of beast (Exod. 12:29); that this was done at midnight
was because "night" signifies the last state of the church, when there
is no longer any faith because there is no charity (n. 221, 709, 1712,
2353). In David: He smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the beginning of
strength in the tents of Ham (Ps. 78:51). Israel also came into Egypt,
and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham. God smote all the firstborn in
their land, the beginning of all their strength (Ps. 105:23, 36). The
worship of the Egyptians from principles of what is false that originate
from truth separated from good, or what is the same, from faith
separated from charity, is called the "tents of Ham." (That "tents"
signify worship may be seen above, n. 414, 1102, 1566, 2145, 2152, 3312;
and that "Ham" is faith separated from charity, n. 1062, 1063, 1076,
1140, 1141, 1162, 1179.) \[14\] By this is further confirmed what is
signified by the firstborn of Egypt being slain; and because all the
firstborn were slain, in order that the firstborn might nevertheless
represent the Lord as to Divine spiritual love, and at the same time
those who are in this love, it was commanded at the time of the exodus
that all the firstborn should be sanctified, concerning which we read in
Moses: Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, Sanctify unto Me all the
firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the sons of Israel, both of
man and of beast-it is Mine. Thou shall cause to pass over unto Jehovah
all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast, the
progeny of a beast, the males shall be Jehovah's. And every firstling of
an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it,
thou shalt break its neck; and all the firstborn of man among thy sons
thou shall redeem. And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to
come, saying, What is this? that thou shall say unto him, By a strong
hand Jehovah brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondmen; and
it came to pass when Pharaoh hardened himself against letting us go,
that Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the
firstborn of man even to the firstborn of beast. Therefore I sacrifice
to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males, but all the firstborn
of my sons I redeem (Exod. 13:1-2, 12-15; 34:19-20; Num. 8:17). From
this it is now evident what is signified in the spiritual sense by
"birthright."

<span class="margnote"><span id="3326.">3326.</span></span>

And Esau said, Behold I am going to die. That this signifies that he
should afterwards rise again, is evident from the representation of
Esau, as being the good of the natural (n. 3302, 3322); and from the
signification of "dying," as being the last of a state when anything
ceases to be (n. 2908, 2912, 2917, 2923); and because the end of a
former state is the beginning of a subsequent one, by "going to die" is
here signified to rise again afterwards, in like manner as is signified
by being "buried" (that to be "buried" denotes to rise again, see above,
n. 2916, 2917, 3256). That he should rise again afterwards, denotes that
good would obtain the priority or dominion over truth, after truth as to
time had apparently held the priority (concerning which subject see
above).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3327.">3327.</span></span>

And for what is this birthright to me? That this signifies that in this
case there would be no need of priority, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3328.">3328.</span></span>

And Jacob said. That this signifies the doctrine of truth, is evident
from the representation of Jacob, as being the doctrine of truth (see
above, n. 3324).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3329.">3329.</span></span>

Swear to me as this day; and he sware unto him. That this signifies
confirmation, is evident from the signification of "swearing" as being
to confirm (n. 2842); and because the confirmation was in respect to a
time, it is not said "this day," but "as this day" (n. 3325).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3330.">3330.</span></span>

And he sold his birthright unto Jacob. That this signifies that in the
meantime priority was granted, namely, to the doctrine of truth which is
"Jacob," is evident from the signification of "birthright," as being
priority (see n. 3325); and that this was granted in the meantime, is
manifest from what was said and shown above (n. 3324, 3325). That in the
spiritual man in the beginning truth has the dominion, is chiefly
because in his first state there are delights of the love of self and of
the world which he believes to be good, and which apply themselves to
his truths, and for the most part produce the affection of truth in him;
for he then thinks that truths may be serviceable to him either for
honor, or for gain, or for reputation in the world, or even for merit in
the other life. All these things excite this affection of truth in him,
and also enkindle it; and yet they are not good, but evil. Nevertheless
the Lord permits that such things should influence him in that first
time, because otherwise he could not be regenerated. Intelligence and
wisdom come in time; in the meanwhile through these truths the man is
introduced into good, that is, into charity; and when he is in this,
then for the first time he perceives what is good, and acts from good,
and then judges and draws conclusions from this good concerning truths;
and those which do not accord with this good he calls false, and
rejects. Thus he rules over truths as a master over his servants.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3331.">3331.</span></span>

Verse 34. And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did
eat and drink, and rose up and went away; and Esau despised the
birthright. "And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils,"
signifies the good of life gifted with the good of truth and the good of
doctrinal things; "and he did eat and drink," signifies appropriation;
"and rose up," signifies elevation thence; "and went away," signifies
life; "and Esau despised the birthright," signifies that in the meantime
the good of life made no account of priority.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3332.">3332.</span></span>

And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. That this signifies
the good of life gifted with the good of truth and the good of doctrinal
things, is evident from the representation of Esau, as being the good of
life (n. 3300, 3322); and from the signification of "bread," as being
the good of love in general, both celestial and spiritual (n. 276, 680,
2165, 2177), thus also the good of truth, for this is spiritual good;
and from the signification of "pottage of lentils," as being the good of
doctrinal things; for "pottage" signifies a chaotic mass of doctrinal
things (n. 3316), and "lentils" the good thereof. That Jacob gave them
to Esau, in the internal sense signifies that these goods come through
the doctrine of truth, which is represented by Jacob (n. 3305). \[2\] In
this last verse, by these words and those which follow there is
described the progress as to truth and good of the spiritual man when
being regenerated, namely, that he first learns the doctrinal things of
truth, next is affected by them (which is the good of the doctrinal
things), then that by taking a mental view of these doctrinal things he
is affected with the truths in them (which is the good of truth), and
lastly that he wills to live according to them, which is the good of
life. In this way the spiritual man when being regenerated advances from
the doctrine of truth to the good of life. But when he is in the good of
life the order is inverted, and from this good he looks to the good of
truth, from this to the good of doctrinal things, and from this to the
doctrinal things of truth. From this it may be known how man from being
a sensuous man becomes spiritual, and of what quality he is when he
becomes spiritual. \[3\] That these goods, namely, the good of life, the
good of truth, and the good of doctrinal things, are distinct from each
other can be seen by those who carefully consider the matter. The good
of life is that which flows from the will; the good of truth is that
which flows from the understanding; and the good of doctrinal things is
that which flows from memory-knowledge. The good which is doctrinal has
these other goods within it. \[4\] That "lentils" signify the good of
doctrinal things, is evident from the fact that wheat, barley, beans,
lentils, millet, spelt, are such things as mean bread, but with a
difference according to the species; that "bread" in general denotes
good is manifest from what has been stated and shown above (n. 276, 680,
2165, 2177); thus different species of good are signified by the cereals
in question, the more noble species of good by "wheat and barley," but
the less noble by "beans and lentils;" as is also manifest from Ezekiel:
Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and
millet, and spelt, and put them into one vessel, and make thee bread
thereof (Ezek. 4:9).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3333.">3333.</span></span>

And he did eat and drink. That this signifies appropriation, is evident
from the signification of "eating," as being the appropriation of good
(n. 2187, 2343, 3168); and from the signification of "drinking," as
being the appropriation of truth (n. 3069, 3089, 3168).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3334.">3334.</span></span>

And rose up. That this signifies elevation thence, is evident from the
signification of "rising up," as involving elevation wherever mentioned
(see n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927); and also from the fact that man is said
to be "uplifted" when being perfected as to spiritual and celestial
things; that is, as to the truth which is of faith, and the good which
is of love and charity (n. 3171).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3335.">3335.</span></span>

And went away. That this signifies life, is evident from the
signification of "going," as being to advance into the things of good,
that is, into those of the life, for all good is of life; nearly as is
signified by "departing," "sojourning," and "advancing" (n. 1293, 1457).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3336.">3336.</span></span>

And Esau despised the birthright. That this signifies that in the
meantime the good of life made no account of the priority, is evident
from the signification of "despising," as being to make no account of;
from the representation of Esau, as being the good of life (n. 3300,
3322); and from the signification of "birthright," as being priority (n.
3325). That it is in the meantime, or for a time, may be seen above (n.
3324, 3325, 3330). Hence it is manifest that by "Esau despising the
birthright" is signified that in the meantime the good of life made no
account of the priority. In order that what is related in this chapter
concerning Esau and Jacob may be apprehended in regard to its
signification in the internal sense, the thought must be removed
entirely from the historicals, thus from the persons of Esau and Jacob;
and instead of them must be substituted the things they represent,
namely, the good of the natural and its truth; or what is the same, the
spiritual man who is being regenerated by means of truth and good; for
in the internal sense of the Word names signify nothing else than actual
things. When the good of the natural and its truths are thought of
instead of Esau and Jacob, it is then evident how the case is with man's
regeneration by means of truth and good, namely, that in the beginning
truth apparently has the priority with him, and also the superiority,
although in itself good is prior and superior. \[2\] In order that it
may be still more clearly evident how the case is with this priority and
superiority, something further shall be said. It is easy to see that
nothing can possibly enter into man's memory and remain there, unless
there is a certain affection or love which introduces it. If there is no
affection, or what is the same, no love, there will be no observation.
It is this affection, or love, with which the thing that enters connects
itself, and being connected remains; as is evident from the fact that
when a similar affection or love returns, the thing itself recurs, and
is presented to view along with other things that had before entered by
virtue of a similar affection or love; and this in a series. From this
comes man's thought; and from this thought his speech. In like manner
also when the thing itself returns, if this is effected by objects of
the senses, or by objects of the thought, or by the discourse of
another, the affection also with which the thing had entered is
reproduced. This is the teaching of experience, and on reflection
everyone may be confirmed in it. \[3\] The doctrinal things of truth
enter in like manner into the memory; and the things that at first
introduce them are affections of various loves, as before said (n.
3330). Genuine affection, which is of the good of charity, is not then
observed; but still it is present; and so far as it can be present, it
is adjoined by the Lord to the doctrinal things of truth; and so far
also they remain adjoined. When therefore the time comes that the man
can be regenerated, the Lord inspires the affection of good, and through
this excites the things which have been adjoined by Him to this
affection, which things are called in the Word "remains;" and then by
means of this affection (that is, of the affection of good), by
successive steps the Lord removes the affections of other loves,
consequently also the things that have been connected with them. And
thus the affection of good, or what is the same, the good of life,
begins to have the dominion. It indeed had the dominion before, but this
could not appear to the man; for insofar as a man is in the love of self
and of the world, the good which is of genuine love does not appear.
From this it may now be seen what is signified in the internal sense by
the things historically related concerning Esau and Jacob.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3337.">3337.</span></span>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING CORRESPONDENCES AND REPRESENTATIONS. What
correspondences are, and what representations, may appear from what has
been said and shown above, namely, that there are correspondences
between the things which are of the light of heaven and those which are
of the light of the world; and that the things which take place in those
which are of the light of the world are representations (n. 3225). But
what the light of heaven is and what is its quality cannot be very well
known to man, because he is in the things that are of the light of the
world; and insofar as he is in these, the things that are in the light
of heaven appear to him as darkness, and as nothing. It is these two
lights which-life flowing in-produce all the intelligence of man. The
imagination of man consists solely of the forms and appearances of such
things as have been received by bodily vision wonderfully varied, and so
to speak modified; but his interior imagination, or thought, consists
solely of the forms and appearances of such things as have been drawn in
through the mind's vision still more wonderfully varied, and so to speak
modified. The things which come forth from this source are in themselves
inanimate, but become animate through the influx of life from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3338.">3338.</span></span>

Besides these lights there are also heats, which likewise are from two
fountains-the heat of heaven coming from its sun, which is the Lord; and
the heat of the world from its sun, which is the luminary visible to our
eyes. The heat of heaven manifests itself to the internal man under the
form of spiritual loves and affections; but the heat of the world
manifests itself to the external man under the form of natural loves and
affections. The former heat produces the life of the internal man, but
the latter that of the external man; for without love and affection man
cannot live at all. Between these two heats also there are
correspondences. These heats become loves and affections through the
influx of the Lord's life; and hence they appear to man as if they were
not heats, although they are; for unless as to both the internal and the
external man, man derived heat from this source he would fall down dead
in a moment. These facts must be evident to everybody from the
circumstance that in proportion as man is inflamed with love, he grows
warm; and in proportion as love recedes, he grows torpid. It is this
heat from which the will of man lives, and it is the light above spoken
of from which comes his understanding.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3339.">3339.</span></span>

In the other life these lights, and also these heats, appear to the
life. The angels live in the light of heaven, and also in the heat above
described; from the light they have intelligence, and from the heat they
have the affection of good. For in their origin the lights which appear
before their external sight are from the Lord's Divine wisdom; and the
heats which are also perceived by them are from His Divine love; and
therefore the more the spirits and angels are in the intelligence of
truth and the affection of good, the nearer they are to the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3340.">3340.</span></span>

To this light there is an opposite darkness, and to this heat there is
an opposite cold; in these live the infernals. Their darkness is from
the falsities in which they are, and their cold is from the evils; and
the more remote they are from truths, the greater is their darkness; and
the more remote they are from good, the greater is their cold. When it
is permitted to look into the hells where such infernals are, there
appears a dark cloud in which they have their abode; and when any
exhalation flows out thence, there are perceived insanities that exhale
from falsities, and hatreds that exhale from evils. A light is indeed
sometimes granted them, but it is a deceptive one; and this is
extinguished with them, and becomes darkness, the moment they look at
the light of truth. Heat also is sometimes granted them, but it is like
that of an unclean bath; and this is changed into cold with them as soon
as they observe anything of good. A certain person was let into that
dark cloud where the infernals are, in order that he might know how the
case is with those who are there; he being protected by the Lord by
means of angels. Speaking from thence with me he said that there was
there so great a rage of insanity against good and truth, and especially
against the Lord, that he was amazed that it could possibly be resisted;
for the infernals breathed nothing but hatred, revenge, and slaughter,
with such violence that they desired to destroy all in the universe; so
that unless this rage was continually repelled by the Lord, the whole
human race would perish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3341.">3341.</span></span>

Inasmuch as the representations in the other life cannot take place
except by means of differences of light and shade, be it known that all
light, consequently all intelligence and wisdom, are from the Lord; and
that all shade, consequently all insanity and folly, are from that which
is their own in man, spirit, and angel; from these two origins flow
forth and are derived all the variegations which are of light and shade
in the other life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3342.">3342.</span></span>

All the speech of spirits and of angels is also effected by means of
representatives; for by wonderful variations of light and shade they
vividly present before the internal and at the same time before the
external sight of him with whom they speak, all they are thinking about,
and insinuate it by suitable changes of the state of the affections. The
representations that come forth in such speech are not like those before
described, but are quick and instantaneous, being simultaneous with the
ideas that belong to their speech. They are like something that is
described in a long series, while at the same time it is exhibited in an
image before the eyes, for, wonderful to say, all spiritual things
themselves whatever can be representatively exhibited by forms of
imagery that are incomprehensible to man, within which are things of the
perception of truth, and still more interiorly those of the perception
of good. Such things are also in man (for man is a spirit clothed with a
body); as is evident from the fact that all speech perceived by the ear,
on ascending toward the interiors, passes into forms \[ideas\] <span
id="fr_94"></span>[3342-1](#fn_94.md) not unlike those of sight, and from
these into intellectual forms or ideas, and thus becomes a perception of
the sense of the expressions. Whoever rightly reflects upon these things
may know from them that there is in himself a spirit which is his
internal man, and also that after the separation of the body he will
possess such a speech, because he is in the very same during his life in
the world, although it does not appear to him that he is in it, by
reason of the obscurity and darkness which earthly, bodily, and worldly
things induce.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3343.">3343.</span></span>

The speech of the angels of the interior heaven is still more
beautifully and pleasantly representative; but the ideas which are
representatively formed are not expressible by words, and if they should
be expressed by any, they would surpass not only apprehension, but also
belief. Spiritual things, which are of truth, are expressed by
modifications of heavenly light, in which are affections, which are
wonderfully varied in innumerable ways; and celestial things, which are
of good, are expressed by variations of heavenly flame or heat; so that
they move all the affections. Into this interior speech also man comes
after the separation of the body, but only the man who during his life
in this world is in spiritual good, that is, in the good of faith, or
what is the same, in charity toward the neighbor; for he has this speech
within himself, though he is unaware of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3344.">3344.</span></span>

But the speech of the angels of the still more interior or third heaven,
although also representative, is yet such as to be inconceivable by any
idea, and consequently is indescribable. Even this perfect form of
speech \[idea\] is also within man, but in the man who is in celestial
love, that is, in love to the Lord; and after the separation of the body
he comes into it as if born into it, although as before said nothing of
it could be comprehended by him under any idea during his life in the
body. In short, by means of representatives adjoined to ideas, speech
becomes as it were alive; least of all with man, because he is in the
speech of words; but more so with the angels of the first heaven; still
more so with the angels of the second heaven; and most of all with the
angels of the third heaven, because these are most nearly in the Lord's
life. In itself whatever is from the Lord is alive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3345.">3345.</span></span>

From what has been said it is evident that there are kinds of speech
successively more interior, but yet of such a nature that the one comes
forth from the other in order, and also that the one is within the other
in order. The nature of man's speech is known, and also his thought from
which the speech flows, the analytics of which are of such a nature that
they can never be explored. The speech of good spirits, that is, of the
angels of the first heaven, together with the thought from which it
flows, is more interior, and contains within it things still more
wonderful and unexplorable. The speech of the angels of the second
heaven together with the thought from which again this flows, is still
more interior, containing within it things still more perfect and
unutterable. But the speech of the angels of the third heaven together
with the thought from which again this flows, is inmost, containing
within it things absolutely unutterable. And although all these kinds of
speech are of such a nature that they appear different from one another,
nevertheless there is but one speech, because the one forms the other,
and the one is within the other; moreover that which comes forth in the
exterior is representative of the interior. A man who does not think
beyond worldly and bodily things cannot believe this, and therefore
supposes that the interior things with him are nothing, although in fact
they are everything; and the exterior things, that is, the worldly and
corporeal things that he makes everything, are relatively scarcely
anything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3346.">3346.</span></span>

In order that I might know these things, and know them with certainty,
of the Lord's Divine mercy it has been granted me for several years to
speak almost constantly with spirits and angels; and with spirits (that
is, with the angels of the first heaven) <span
id="fr_95"></span>[3346-1](#fn_95.md) in their own speech; also at times
with the angels of the second heaven in their speech; but the speech of
the angels of the third heaven has only appeared to me as a radiation of
light, in which there was perception from the flame of good within it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3347.">3347.</span></span>

I have heard angels speaking concerning human minds, and concerning
their thought and the derivative speech. They compared them to the
external form of man, which comes forth and subsists from the
innumerable forms that are within-as from the brains, the medulla, the
lungs, the heart, liver, pancreas, spleen, stomach, and intestines,
besides many other organs, as those of generation in both sexes from the
innumerable muscles encompassing these organs; and lastly from the
integuments; and from all these being woven together from vessels and
fibers, and indeed from vessels and fibers within vessels and fibers,
from which come the ducts and lesser forms; thus that the body is
composed of things innumerable; all of which nevertheless conspire, each
in its own way, to the composition of the external form, in which
nothing appears of the things that are within. To this external form
they compared human minds, and their thoughts and the derivative speech.
But angelic minds they compared to those things which are within, which
are relatively illimitable, and also incomprehensible. They also
compared the faculty of thinking to the faculty that belongs to the
viscera of acting according to the form of the fibers, saying that the
faculty is not of the fibers, but of the life in the fibers; just as the
faculty of thinking is not of the mind, but of life from the Lord
flowing into it. When such comparisons are made by angels they are at
the same time exhibited by means of representatives, whereby the
interior forms above spoken of are presented visibly and intellectually,
in respect to their smallest incomprehensible parts, and this in a
moment; but comparisons made by means of spiritual and celestial things,
such as take place among the celestial angels, immeasurably surpass in
the beauty of wisdom those made by means of natural things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3348.">3348.</span></span>

Spirits from another earth were with me for a considerable time; and I
described to them the wisdom of our globe, and told them that among the
sciences pursued by the learned is that of analytics, with which they
busy themselves in exploring what is of the mind and its thoughts,
calling it metaphysics and logic. But I said that men have advanced
little beyond terms, and certain shifting rules; and that they argue
concerning these terms-as what form is; what substance; what the mind;
and what the soul; and that by means of these general shifting rules
they vehemently dispute about truths. I then perceived from these
spirits that when men inhere in such things as terms, and think
concerning these matters by artificial rules, they take away all sense
and understanding of a subject. \[2\] They said that such things are
merely little black clouds interposed before the intellectual sight; and
that they drag down the understanding into the dust. They added that
with them it is not so, but that they have clearer ideas of things in
consequence of being unacquainted with such analytics. I was also
permitted to see how wise they are. They represented the human mind in a
marvelous manner as a heavenly form; and its affections as spheres of
activity in agreement with it; and this so skillfully that they were
commended by the angels. They represented also in what manner the Lord
bends those affections which in themselves are not delightful, into such
as are delightful. \[3\] Learned men of our earth were present, and
could not in the least comprehend these things, although in the life of
the body they had discoursed much on such subjects in a philosophical
way; and when the spirits just referred to in turn perceived their
thoughts, in that they inhered in mere terms, and were inclined to
dispute on every point as to whether it is so, they called such things
feculent froth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3349.">3349.</span></span>

From what has been said thus far it may be seen what correspondences
are, and what representatives; but in addition to what has been said and
shown at the end of the preceding chapters (n. 2987-3003, and n.
3213-3227), see also what is said of them elsewhere; namely, That all
things in the sense of the letter of the Word are representative and
significative of what is in the internal sense (n. 1404, 1408, 1409,
2763): That the Word through Moses and the prophets was written by means
of representatives and significatives, and that in order to possess an
internal sense by which there might be communication of heaven and earth
it could not be written in any other style (n. 2899): That the Lord
Himself for this reason spoke by representatives, as well as for the
reason that He spoke from the Divine Itself (n. 2900): What has been the
source of the representatives and significatives in the Word and in
rituals (n. 2179): That representatives originated from the
significatives of the Ancient Church, and these from the things
perceived by the Most Ancient Church (n. 920, 1409, 2896,2897): That the
most ancient people had their representatives from dreams also (n.
1977): That Enoch denotes those who collected the perceptive matters of
the most ancient people (n. 2896): That continually in heaven there are
representatives of the Lord and His kingdom (n. 1619): That the heavens
are full of representatives (n. 1521, 1532): That the ideas of the
angels are changed in the world of spirits into various representatives
(n. 1971, 1980, 1981): Representatives by means of which children are
introduced into intelligence (n. 2299): That the representatives in
nature are from the Lord's influx (n. 1632, 1881): That in universal
nature there are representatives of the Lord's kingdom (n. 2758): That
in the external man there are things which correspond to what is
internal, and things which do not correspond (n. 1563, 1568).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3350.">3350.</span></span>

In order to show more plainly the nature of representatives, I may
adduce one additional instance. I heard a host of angels of the interior
heaven who together or in consort were forming a representative. The
spirits about me could not perceive it, except from a certain influx of
interior affection. It was a choir, in which many angels together
thought the same thing, and spoke the same thing. By representations
they formed a golden crown gemmed with diamonds around the Lord's head;
which was effected all at once by means of a rapid series of
representations, such as are those of thought and speech spoken of above
(n. 3342-3344); and wonderful to say, although there were a host they
nevertheless all thought and spoke as a one, thus they all represented
as a one; and this because no one was desirous to do anything from
himself, still less to preside over the rest and lead the choir; for
whoever does this is of himself instantly dissociated. But they suffered
themselves to be led mutually by each other, thus all individually and
collectively by the Lord. All the good who come into the other life are
brought into such harmonious agreements. \[2\] Afterwards there were
heard many choirs, which exhibited various things representatively, and
although there were many choirs, and many in each choir, still they
acted as a one; for from the form of various things there resulted a
one, in which was heavenly beauty. Thus the universal heaven, which
consists of myriads of myriads, can act as a one by being in mutual
love; for thereby they suffer themselves to be led by the Lord; and
wonderful to say the greater their numbers, that is, the greater the
number of the myriads who constitute heaven, so much the more distinctly
and perfectly are things done in general and in particular; and the more
also in proportion as the angels are of a more interior heaven; for all
perfection increases toward the interiors.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[3307-1](ac067.htm#fr_89.md) "Perfect" is here used
in the sense of "whole," "entire." The Latin is integer, and the Hebrew
is tam, the same words that occur in the passage, "Mark the perfect man"
(Ps. 37:37).

<span id="fn_90"></span>[3311-1](ac067.htm#fr_90.md) "Perfect" is here used

<span id="fn_92"></span>[3322-1](ac067.htm#fr_92.md) Literally, "mix

the Latin miscere manus and miscere in Deut. 2:5, 19; and in Dan 11:25
with commiscere (bello).

<span id="fn_93"></span>[3325-1](ac067.htm#fr_93.md) The Latin here is
saeculorum, "of the ages"; but this seems to be a misprint or slip of
the pen, for the Hebrew is shamayim, which is rendered coelorum, as
usual, in Arcana Coelestia n. 255, 9954; Doctrine of the Lord n. 6, 44;
Apocalypse Explained n. 205, 253, 375, 684, 768; that is, in all the
other places where this text is quoted by Swedenborg.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[3342-1](ac067.htm#fr_94.md) Here Swedenborg uses
the term idea in its original Greek sense of form. Compare Doctrine of
Faith n. 34 with True Christian Religion n. 2; and see also the note to
n. 1013:4 of the present work, and n. 3216.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[3346-1](ac067.htm#fr_95.md) The "Heaven of Good
Spirits" is a term used by Swedenborg for the First Heaven. The
expression is found (or is indicated) in the early volumes of the Arcana
Coelestia, as for instance in n. 459, 684, 925, 978, 1642, 1752. The
reader should remember in this connection that the Arcana Coelestia was
written and published before the Last Judgment of 1757.
