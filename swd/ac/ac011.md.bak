### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="501.">501.</span></span>

As regards the churches that in course of time succeeded one another,
and of which it is said that one was born from another, the case with
them was the same as it is with fruits, or with their seeds. In the
midst of these, that is, in their inmosts, there are as it were fruits
of the fruits, or seeds of the seeds, from which live as it were in
regular order the successive parts. For the more remote these are from
the inmost toward the circumference, the less of the essence of the
fruit or of the seed is there in them, until finally they are but the
cuticles or coverings in which the fruits or seeds terminate. Or as in
the case of the brain, in the inmost parts of which are subtle organic
forms called the cortical substances, from which and by which the
operations of the soul proceed; and from which in regular order the
purer coverings follow in succession, then the denser ones, and finally
the general coverings called meninges, which are terminated in coverings
still more general, and at last in the most general of all, which is the
skull.

<span class="margnote"><span id="502.">502.</span></span>

These three churches, "Man" "Seth" and "Enosh" constitute the Most
Ancient Church, but still with a difference of perfection as to
perceptions: the perceptive faculty of the first church gradually
diminished in the succeeding churches, and became more general, as
observed concerning fruit or its seed, and concerning the brain.
Perfection consists in the faculty of perceiving distinctly, which
faculty is diminished when the perception is less distinct and more
general; an obscurer perception then succeeds in the place of that which
was clearer, and thus it begins to vanish away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="503.">503.</span></span>

The perceptive faculty of the Most Ancient Church consisted not only in
the perception of what is good and true, but also in the happiness and
delight arising from well-doing; without such happiness and delight in
doing what is good the perceptive faculty has no life, but by virtue of
such happiness and delight it receives life. The life of love, and of
the derivative faith, such as the Most Ancient Church enjoyed, is life
while in the performance of use, that is, in the good and truth of use:
from use, by use, and according to use, is life given by the Lord; there
can be no life in what is useless, for whatever is useless is cast away.
In this respect the most ancient people were likenesses of the Lord, and
therefore in perceptive powers they became images of Him. The perceptive
power consists in knowing what is good and true, consequently what is of
faith: he who is in love is not delighted in knowing, but in doing what
is good and true, that is, in being useful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="504.">504.</span></span>

Verses 10, 11. And Enosh lived after he begat Kenan eight hundred and
fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Enosh
were nine hundred and five years, and he died. Here in like manner the
"days" and numbers of "years" and also "sons and daughters" and his
"dying" signify like things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="505.">505.</span></span>

"Enosh" as before observed, is a third church, yet one of the most
ancient churches, but less celestial, and consequently less perceptive,
than the church "Seth;" and this latter was not so celestial and
perceptive as the parent church, called "Man." These three are what
constitute the Most Ancient Church, which, relatively to the succeeding
ones, was as the kernel of fruits, or seeds, whereas the succeeding
churches are relatively as the membranaceous parts of these.

<span class="margnote"><span id="506.">506.</span></span>

Verse 12. And Kenan lived seventy years, and begat Mahalalel. By "Kenan"
is signified a fourth church, and by "Mahalalel" a fifth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="507.">507.</span></span>

The church called "Kenan" is not to be so much reckoned among those
three more perfect ones, inasmuch as perception, which in the former
churches had been distinct, began now to become general, comparatively
as are the first and softer membranes relatively to the kernel of fruits
or seeds; which state is not indeed described, but still is apparent
from what follows, as from the description of the churches called
"Enoch" and "Noah."

<span class="margnote"><span id="508.">508.</span></span>

Verses 13, 14. And Kenan lived after he begat Mahalalel eight hundred
and forty years, and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Kenan
were nine hundred and ten years, and he died. The "days" and numbers of
"years" have the same signification here as before. "Sons and daughters"
here also signify truths and goods, whereof the members of the church
had a perception, but in a more general manner. That he "died" signifies
in like manner the cessation of such a state of perception.

<span class="margnote"><span id="509.">509.</span></span>

It is here only to be remarked, that all things are determined by their
relation to the state of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="510.">510.</span></span>

Verse 15. And Mahalalel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared. By
"Mahalalel" is signified, as before said, a fifth church; by "Jared" a
sixth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="511.">511.</span></span>

As the perceptive faculty decreased, and from being more particular or
distinct, became more general or obscure, so also did the life of love
or of uses; for as is the life of love or of uses, so is the perceptive
faculty. From good to know truth is celestial; the life of those who
constituted the church called "Mahalalel" was such that they preferred
the delight from truths to the delight from uses, as has been given me
to know by experience among their like in the other life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="512.">512.</span></span>

Verses 16, 17. And Mahalalel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred
and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of
Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety and five years, and he died. It is
the same with these words as with the like words before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="513.">513.</span></span>

Verse 18. And Jared lived a hundred sixty and two years, and begat
Enoch. By "Jared" as before said, is signified a sixth church; by
"Enoch" a seventh.

<span class="margnote"><span id="514.">514.</span></span>

Concerning the church called "Jared" nothing is related; but its
character may be known from the church "Mahalalel" which preceded it,
and the church "Enoch" which followed it, between which two it was
intermediate.

<span class="margnote"><span id="515.">515.</span></span>

Verses 19, 20. And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years,
and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of Jared were nine
hundred sixty and two years, and he died. The signification of these
words also is similar to that of the like words above. That the ages of
the antediluvians were not so great, as that of Jared nine hundred and
sixty-two years, and that of Methuselah nine hundred and sixty-nine
years, must appear to everyone, especially from what of the Lord's
Divine mercy will be said at verse 3 of the next chapter, where we read,
"Their days shall be a hundred and twenty years;" so that the number of
the years does not signify the age of any particular man, but the times
and states of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="516.">516.</span></span>

Verse 21. And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah. By
"Enoch" as before said, is signified a seventh church; and by
"Methuselah" an eighth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="517.">517.</span></span>

The quality of the church "Enoch" is described in the following verses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="518.">518.</span></span>

Verse 22. And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three
hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. To "walk with God"
signifies doctrine concerning faith. That he "begat sons and daughters"
signifies doctrinal matters concerning truths and goods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="519.">519.</span></span>

There were some at that time who framed doctrines from the things that
had been matters of perception in the most ancient and succeeding
churches, in order that such doctrine might serve as a rule whereby to
know what was good and true: such persons were called "Enoch." This is
what is signified by the words, "and Enoch walked with God;" and so did
they call that doctrine; which is likewise signified by the name "Enoch"
which means to "instruct." The same is evident also from the
signification of the expression to "walk" and from the fact that he is
said to have "walked with God" not "with Jehovah:" to "walk with God" is
to teach and live according to the doctrine of faith, but to "walk with
Jehovah" is to live the life of love. To "walk" is a customary form of
speaking that signifies to live, as to "walk in the law" to "walk in the
statutes" to "walk in the truth." To "walk" has reference properly to a
way, which has relation to truth, consequently to faith, or the doctrine
of faith. What is signified in the Word by "walking" may in some measure
appear from the following passages. \[2\] In Micah: He hath showed thee,
O man, what is good, and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do
judgment and the love of mercy, and to humble thyself by walking with
thy God? (Micah 6:8), where to "walk with God" signifies to live
according to the things here indicated; here, however, it is said "with
God" while of Enoch another word is used which signifies also "from with
God" so that the expression is ambiguous. In David: Thou hast delivered
my feet from impulsion, that I may walk before God in the light of the
living (Ps. 56:13), where to "walk before God" is to walk in the truth
of faith, which is the "light of the living." In like manner in Isaiah:
The people that walk in darkness see a great light (Isa. 9:1). So the
Lord says by Moses: I will walk in the midst, and will be your God, and
ye shall be My people (Lev. 26:12), signifying that they should live
according to the doctrine of the law. \[3\] In Jeremiah: They shall
spread them before the sun, and the moon, and to the armies of the
heavens, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom
they have walked, and whom they have sought (Jer. 8:2), where a manifest
distinction is made between the things of love, and those of faith; the
things of love being expressed by "loving" and "serving;" and those of
faith by "walking" and "seeking." In all the prophetical writings every
expression is used with accuracy, nor is one term ever used in the place
of another. But to "walk with Jehovah" or "before Jehovah" signifies, in
the Word, to live the life of love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="520.">520.</span></span>

Verses 23, 24. And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and
five years. And Enoch walked with God, and he was no more, for God took
him. By "all the days of Enoch being three hundred sixty and five years"
is signified that they were few. By his "walking with God" is signified,
as above, doctrine concerning faith. By "he was no more, for God took
him" is signified the preservation of that doctrine for the use of
posterity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="521.">521.</span></span>

As to the words "he was no more, for God took him" signifying the
preservation of that doctrine for the use of posterity, the case with
Enoch, as already said, is that he reduced to doctrine what in the Most
Ancient Church had been a matter of perception, and which in the time of
that church was not allowable; for to know by perception is a very
different thing from learning by doctrine. They who are in perception
have no need to learn by formulated doctrine that which they know
already. For example: he who knows how to think well, has no occasion to
be taught to think by any rules of art, for in this way his faculty of
thinking well would be impaired, as is the case with those who stick
fast in scholastic dust. To those who learn by perception, the Lord
grants to know what is good and true by an inward way; but to those who
learn from doctrine, knowledge is given by an external way, or that of
the bodily senses; and the difference is like that between light and
darkness. Consider also that the perceptions of the celestial man are
such as to admit of no description, for they enter into the most minute
and particular things, with all variety according to states and
circumstances. But as it was foreseen that the perceptive faculty of the
cost Ancient Church would perish, and that afterwards mankind would
learn by doctrines what is true and good, or by darkness would come to
light, it is here said that "God took him" that is, preserved the
doctrine for the use of posterity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="522.">522.</span></span>

The state and quality of the perception with those who were called
"Enoch" have also been made known to me. It was a kind of general
obscure perception without any distinctness; for in such a case the mind
determines its view outside of itself into the doctrinal things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="523.">523.</span></span>

Verse 25. And Methuselah lived a hundred eighty and seven years, and
begat Lamech. By "Methuselah" is signified an eighth church, and by
"Lamech" a ninth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="524.">524.</span></span>

Nothing is mentioned concerning the quality of this church; but that its
perceptive faculty was general and obscure, is evident from the
description of the church called "Noah;" so that perfection decreased,
and with perfection wisdom and intelligence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="525.">525.</span></span>

Verses 26, 27. And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred
eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters. And all the days of
Methuselah were nine hundred and sixty and nine years, and he died.
These words have a like signification.

<span class="margnote"><span id="526.">526.</span></span>

Verse 28. And Lamech lived a hundred eighty and ten years, and begat a
son. By "Lamech" is here signified a ninth church, wherein the
perception of truth and good was so general and obscure that it was next
to none, so that the church was vastated. By the "son" is signified the
rise of a new church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="527.">527.</span></span>

That by "Lamech" is signified a church wherein the perception of truth
and good was so general and obscure as to be next to none, consequently
a church vastated, appears from what was said in the preceding chapter,
and from what follows in the next verse. "Lamech" in the preceding
chapter has nearly the same signification as in this, namely, vastation
(concerning which see Gen. 4:18, 19, 23, 24); and he who begat him is
also called by nearly the same name, "Methuselah" so that the things
signified by the names are nearly the same. By "Methuselah" and
"Methuselah" is signified something that is about to die; and by
"Lamech" what is destroyed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="528.">528.</span></span>

Verse 29. And he called his name Noah, saying, He shall comfort us from
our work, and the toil of our hands, out of the ground which Jehovah
hath cursed. By "Noah" is signified the Ancient Church. By "comforting
us from our work and the toil of our hands, out of the ground which
Jehovah hath cursed" is signified doctrine, whereby what had been
perverted would be restored.

<span class="margnote"><span id="529.">529.</span></span>

That by "Noah" is signified the Ancient Church, or the parent of the
three churches after the flood, will appear from the following pages,
where Noah is largely treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="530.">530.</span></span>

By the names in this chapter, as we have said, are signified churches,
or what is the same, doctrines; for the church exists and has its name
from doctrine; thus by "Noah" is signified the Ancient Church, or the
doctrine that remained from the Most Ancient Church. How the case is
with churches or doctrines has already been stated, namely, that they
decline, until there no longer remains anything of the goods and truths
of faith, and then the church is said in the Word to be vastated. But
still remains are always preserved, or some with whom the good and truth
of faith remain, although they are few; for unless the good and truth of
faith were preserved in these few, there would be no conjunction of
heaven with mankind. As regards the remains that are in a man
individually, the fewer they are the less can the matters of reason and
knowledge that he possesses be enlightened, for the light of good and
truth flows in from the remains, or through the remains, from the Lord.
If there were no remains in a man he would not be a man, but much viler
than a brute; and the fewer remains there are, the less is he a man, and
the more remains there are, the more is he a man. Remains are like some
heavenly star, which, the smaller it is the less light it gives, and the
larger, the more light. The few things that remained from the Most
Ancient Church were among those who constituted the church called Noah;
but these were not remains of perception, but of perfection, and also of
doctrine derived from the things of perception in the most ancient
churches; and therefore a new church was now raised up by the Lord,
which being of an entirely different native character from the most
ancient churches, is to be called the Ancient Church-Ancient from the
fact that it existed at the close of the ages before the flood, and
during the first period after it. Of this church, by the Divine mercy of
the Lord, more will be said hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="531.">531.</span></span>

That by "comforting us from our work and the toil of our hands, out of
the ground which Jehovah hath cursed" is signified doctrine, whereby
what had been perverted would be restored, will also appear, of the
Lord's Divine mercy, in the following pages. By "work" is signified that
they could not perceive what is true except with labor and distress. By
the "toil of the hands out of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed" is
signified that they could do nothing good. Thus is described "Lamech"
that is, the vastated church. There is "work and labor of the hands"
when, from themselves or from their Own, men must seek out what is true
and do what is good. That which comes of this is the "ground which
Jehovah hath cursed" that is, nothing comes of it but what is false and
evil. (But what is signified by "Jehovah cursing" may be seen above, n.
245.) To "comfort" has reference to the "son" or Noah, whereby is
signified a new regeneration, thus a new church, which is the Ancient
Church. By this church, or "Noah" is therefore likewise signified rest,
and comfort that comes from rest, just as it was said of the Most
Ancient Church that it was the seventh day, in which the Lord rested.
(See n. 84-88.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="532.">532.</span></span>

Verses 30, 31. And Lamech lived after he begat Noah \[illum Noachum\]
five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters. And
all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years, and
he died. By "Lamech" as before said, is signified the church vastated.
By "sons and daughters" are signified the conceptions and births of such
a church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="533.">533.</span></span>

As nothing more is related concerning Lamech than that he begat sons and
daughters, which are the conceptions and births of such a church, we
shall dwell no longer on the subject. What the births were, or the "sons
and daughters" appears from the church; for such as is the church, such
are the births from it. Both the churches called "Methuselah" and
"Lamech" expired just before the flood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="534.">534.</span></span>

Verse 32. And Noah was a son of five hundred years; and Noah begat Shem,
Ham, and Japheth. By "Noah" as has been said, is signified the Ancient
Church. By "Shem, Ham, and Japheth" are signified three Ancient
Churches, the parent of which was the Ancient Church called "Noah."

<span class="margnote"><span id="535.">535.</span></span>

That the church called "Noah" is not to be numbered among the churches
that were before the flood, appears from verse 29, where it is said that
it should "comfort them from their work and the toil of their hands, out
of the ground which Jehovah hath cursed." The "comfort" was that it
should survive and endure. But concerning Noah and his sons, of the
Lord's Divine mercy hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="536.">536.</span></span>

As in the foregoing pages much has been said about the perception
possessed by the churches that existed before the flood, and as at this
day perception is a thing utterly unknown, so much so that some may
imagine it to be a kind of continuous revelation, or to be something
implanted in men; others that it is merely imaginary, and others other
things; and as perception is the very Celestial itself given by the Lord
to those who are in the faith of love, and as there is perception in the
universal heaven of endless variety: therefore in order that there may
be among men some conception of what perception is, of the Lord's Divine
mercy I may in the following pages describe the principal kinds of
perception that exist in the Heavens.

<span class="margnote"><span id="537.">537.</span></span>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING HEAVEN AND HEAVENLY JOY. A certain spirit
attached himself to my left side, and asked me whether I knew how he
could get into heaven. I was permitted to tell him that admission into
heaven belongs solely to the Lord, who alone knows what a man's quality
is. Very many arrive from the world who make it their sole pursuit to
get into heaven, being quite ignorant of what heaven is, and of what
heavenly joy is, that heaven is mutual love, and that heavenly joy is
the derivative joy. Therefore those who do not know this are first
instructed about it by actual experience. For example, there was a
certain spirit, newly arrived from the world, who in like manner longed
for heaven, and in order that he might perceive what the nature of
heaven is, his interiors were opened so that he should feel something of
heavenly joy. But as soon as he felt it he began to lament and to
writhe, and begged to be delivered, saying that he could not live on
account of the anguish; and therefore his interiors were closed toward
heaven, and in this way he was restored. From this instance we may see
with what pangs of conscience and with what anguish those are tortured
who not being prepared for it are admitted even but a little way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="538.">538.</span></span>

There were some who sought admission into heaven without knowing what
heaven is. They were told that unless they were in the faith of love, to
enter heaven would be as dangerous as going into a flame; but still they
sought for it. When they arrived at the first entrance court, that is to
say, the lower sphere of angelic spirits, they were smitten so hard that
they threw themselves headlong back, and in this way were taught how
dangerous it is merely to approach heaven until prepared by the Lord to
receive the affections of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="539.">539.</span></span>

A certain spirit who during his life in the body had made light of
adulteries, was in accordance with his desire admitted to the first
threshold of heaven. As soon as he came there he began to suffer and to
be sensible of his own cadaverous stench, until he could endure it no
longer. It seemed to him that if he went any farther he should perish,
and he was therefore cast down to the lower earth, enraged that he
should feel such torment at the first threshold of heaven, merely
because he had arrived in a sphere that was contrary to adulteries. He
is among the unhappy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="540.">540.</span></span>

Almost all who come into the other life are ignorant of the nature of
heavenly happiness and bliss, because they know not the nature and
quality of inward joy. They form a conception of it merely from the
delights and joys of the body and the world. What they are ignorant of
they suppose to be nothing, the truth being that bodily and worldly joys
are relatively non-existent and foul. In order therefore that those who
are well disposed may learn and may know what heavenly joy is, they are
taken in the first place to paradises that surpass every conception of
the imagination (concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy
hereafter), and they suppose that they have arrived in the paradise of
heaven; but they are taught that this is not true heavenly happiness,
and are therefore permitted to experience interior states of joy which
are perceptible to their inmost being. They are then transported into a
state of peace, even to their inmost being, and they confess that
nothing of it is at all expressible or conceivable. And finally they are
introduced into a state of innocence, also to their inmost feeling. In
this way are they permitted to learn the nature of true spiritual and
celestial good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="541.">541.</span></span>

Certain spirits who were ignorant of the nature of heavenly joy were
unexpectedly taken up into heaven after they had been brought into such
a state as to render this possible, that is to say a state in which
their bodily things and fanciful notions were lulled into quiescence.
From there I heard one saying to me that now for the first time he felt
how great is the joy in heaven, and that he had been very greatly
deceived in having a different idea of it, but that now he perceived in
his inmost being a joy immeasurably greater than he had ever felt in any
bodily pleasure such as men are delighted with in the life of the body,
and which he called foul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="542.">542.</span></span>

They who are taken up into heaven in order that they may know its
quality either have their bodily things and fanciful notions lulled to
quiescence-for no one can enter heaven with the bodily things and
fanciful notions that they take with them from this world-or else they
are surrounded by a sphere of spirits who miraculously temper such
things as are impure and that cause disagreement. With some the
interiors are opened. In these and other ways they are prepared,
according to their lives and the nature thereby acquired.

<span class="margnote"><span id="543.">543.</span></span>

Certain spirits longed to know the nature of heavenly joy, and were
therefore allowed to perceive the inmost of their own, to such a degree
that they could bear no more; and yet it was not angelic joy, being
scarcely equal to the least angelic joy, as was given me to perceive by
a communication of their joy. It was so slight as to be as it were
chilly, and yet being their inmost joy they called it most heavenly.
From this it was evident not only that there are degrees of joys, but
also that the inmost of one scarcely approaches the outmost or middle of
another, and that when anyone receives his own inmost joy, he is in his
heavenly joy, and cannot endure that which is still more interior, for
it becomes painful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="544.">544.</span></span>

Certain spirits who were admitted into the heaven of innocence of the
first heaven spoke to me thence, and confessed that the state of joy and
gladness was such as they never could have conceived any idea of. Yet
this was only in the first heaven, and there are three heavens, and
states of innocence in each, with their innumerable varieties.

<span class="margnote"><span id="545.">545.</span></span>

But in order that I might know the nature and quality of heaven and of
heavenly joy, for long and often I have been permitted by the Lord to
perceive the delights of heavenly joys, so that as I know them from
actual experience I can indeed know them, but can by no means describe
them. However, in order to give some idea of it I may say that heavenly
joy is an affection of innumerable delights and joys that form one
general simultaneous joy, in which general joy, that is, in which
general affection, there are harmonies of innumerable affections that do
not come distinctly to perception, but obscurely, because the perception
is very general. Yet I was permitted to perceive that there are things
innumerable within it, in such order as can never be described, these
innumerable things being such as flow from the order of heaven. Such
order exists in every least thing of the affection, all of which
together are presented and perceived as a very general one according to
the capacity of him who is the subject of it. In a word, in every
general joy or affection there are illimitable things ordinated in a
most perfect form, and there is nothing that is not alive or that does
not affect even the inmost things of our being, for heavenly joys
proceed from inmost things. I perceived also that the joy and
deliciousness came as if from the heart, and very softly diffused
themselves through all the inmost fibers, and so into the congregated
fibers, with such an inmost sense of delight that the fiber is as it
were nothing but joy and deliciousness, and the whole derivative
perceptive and sensitive sphere the same, being alive with happiness. In
comparison with these joys the joy of bodily pleasures is like gross and
pungent dust as compared with a pure and gentle breeze.

<span class="margnote"><span id="546.">546.</span></span>

In order that I might know how the case is with those who desire to be
in heaven and are not such that they can be there, once when I was in
some heavenly society, an angel appeared to me as an infant with a
chaplet of bright blue flowers about its head, and girded about the
breast with wreaths of other colors. By this I was given to know that I
was in some society where there was charity. Some well-disposed spirits
were then admitted into the same society, who the moment they entered
became much more intelligent, and spoke like angelic spirits. Afterwards
some were admitted who desired to be innocent from themselves, whose
state was represented to me by an infant that vomited milk out of its
mouth. Such is their state. Then some were admitted who supposed that
they were intelligent from themselves, and their state was represented
by their faces, which appeared sharp, but fair enough; and they seemed
to wear a peaked hat from which a sharp point projected, but their faces
did not appear to be of human flesh, but as if carved out and devoid of
life. Such is the state of those who believe that they are spiritual
from themselves, that is, able from themselves to have faith. Other
spirits were admitted who could not remain there, but were dismayed,
became distressed, and fled away.

CHAPTER 6 CONCERNING HEAVEN AND HEAVENLY JOY. The souls who come into
the other life are all ignorant of the nature of heaven and of heavenly
joy. Very many suppose it to be a kind of joy into which any can be
admitted no matter how they have lived, even those who have borne hatred
against their neighbor and have passed their lives in adulteries, being
quite unaware of the fact that heaven is mutual and chaste love, and
that heavenly joy is the derivative happiness.

I have sometimes spoken with spirits fresh from the world concerning the
state of eternal life, telling them how important it was for them to
know who is the Lord of that kingdom, and what is the nature and form of
its government, just as those in this world who go into another kingdom
are especially interested to know who and of what sort is the king, what
is the nature of the government, and many other things that belong to
the kingdom; and how much more should they be interested in this
kingdom, where they are to live forever. I told them that the Lord alone
rules both heaven and the universe, for He who rules the one must rule
the other; and that the kingdom in which they were now is the Lord's
kingdom, the laws of which are eternal truths, all of which are based on
the one great law that men shall love the Lord above all things and
their neighbor as themselves, and now even more than themselves, for if
they would be as the angels this is what they must do. To all this they
could make no reply, because in their bodily life they had heard
something of the kind, but had not believed it. They marveled that there
is such love in heaven, and that it is possible for anyone to love his
neighbor more than himself, seeing that they had heard that they were to
love their neighbor as themselves. But they were instructed that in the
other life all goods are immeasurably increased, and that the life in
the body is such that men can go no further than loving the neighbor as
themselves because they are in the things of the body, but that when
these are removed, the love becomes purer, and at last angelic, which
consists in loving the neighbor more than themselves. The possibility of
such love is evident from the conjugial love that exists with some
persons, who would suffer death rather than let their married partner be
injured; and also from the love of parents for their children, in that a
mother will endure starvation rather than see her infant hunger, and
this even among birds and animals; and likewise from sincere friendship,
in that perils will be undergone for our friends; and even from polite
and feigned friendship, that would emulate real friendship in offering
the better things to those to whom we wish well, making great
professions even when they do not come from the heart. And finally its
possibility is evident from the very nature of love, which finds its joy
in being of service to others, not for the sake of self but for the
love's own sake. But all this could not be comprehended by those who
loved themselves more than others, and who in the bodily life had been
greedy for gain, and least of all by the avaricious.

The angelic state is such that everyone communicates his own bliss and
happiness to others. For in the other life there is a most exquisite
communication and perception of all the affections and thoughts, so that
each person communicates his joy to all, and all to each, so that each
one is as it were the center of all. This is the heavenly form. And
therefore the more there are who constitute the Lord's kingdom, the
greater is the happiness, for it increases in proportion to the numbers,
and this is why heavenly happiness is unutterable. There is this
communication of all with each and of each with all when everyone loves
others more than himself. But if anyone wishes better for himself than
for others the love of self reigns, which communicates nothing to others
from itself except the idea of self, which is very foul, and when this
is perceived the person is at once banished and rejected.

Just as in the human body all things both in general and particular
contribute to the general and individual uses of all the rest, so is it
in the Lord's kingdom, which is constituted like a man, and in fact is
called the Grand Man. In this way everyone there contributes either more
nearly or more remotely, and in many ways, to the happiness of all, and
this in accordance with the order instituted and consequently maintained
by the Lord alone.
