### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="9601.">9601.</span></span>

And the breadth four cubits. That this signifies the marriage of truth
with good, is evident from the signification of "breadth," as being
truth (see n. 1613, 3433, 3434, 4482, 9487); and from the signification
of "four," as being conjunction, thus marriage, for the conjunction of
truth and good is called the heavenly marriage (n. 2173, 2618, 2728,
2729, 2803). "Four" denotes conjunction or marriage because this number
arises from two multiplied by itself, and "two" denotes conjunction (n.
5194, 8423); and because multiplied numbers have a similar signification
to that of the simple numbers of which they are compounded (as was said
just above, n. 9600). (That all numbers in the Word signify real things,
may be seen in the passages cited in n. 9488.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="9602.">9602.</span></span>

For one curtain. That this signifies thus for each of the truths, is
evident from the signification of a "curtain," as being truth (see n.
9595). Therefore by "one curtain," or by each one, is signified each of
the truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9603.">9603.</span></span>

One measure for all the curtains. That this signifies a like state of
the matter, is evident from the signification of a "measure," as being
the state of a thing as to truth (see n. 3104); consequently "one
measure for all the curtains" denotes a like state of the matter for all
the truths. By a like state of the matter, when said concerning the
truths of faith in the spiritual kingdom, is meant that they all look to
good, and that through good they look to the Lord from whom they are;
for the truths which do not look to good, and thus to the Lord, are not
truths of faith, consequently are not the truths of the church or of
heaven. The truths which look in another direction may indeed in their
external form appear like truths, but they are not truths, because they
are devoid of life; for the life of truth is good, and good is from the
Lord, who alone is life. Truths which look in another direction are like
the members of a body without a soul, which are not members of any body,
because they are lifeless, and therefore of no use. \[2\] That "measure"
signifies the state of a thing as to truth, and also the state of a
thing as to good, is evident from the passages in the Word that treat of
the measurements of the New Jerusalem, and also of the new temple. By
the "New" or "Holy Jerusalem" is signified the Lord's New Church, in
like manner by the temple; and therefore by their "measurements" are
signified states as to truth and as to good; as in John: The angel had a
golden reed, to measure the holy Jerusalem, and the gates thereof, and
the wall thereof; and he measured the city with the reed, twelve
thousand furlongs. And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred forty and
four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev.
21:15-17). That the "measurements" here signify states as to good and
truth is very manifest, for the "holy Jerusalem" denotes the Lord's New
Church; "the gates and the wall" denote the protecting truths of faith;
"twelve thousand" denotes all truths and goods in the complex; likewise
"a hundred forty and four" (n. 7973), for this number signifies the like
as the number "twelve" because it arises from twelve multiplied by
twelve (that "twelve" denotes all truths and goods in the complex, see
n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913); "the measure of a man, that
is, of an angel" signifies that such is the state of the church and of
heaven in respect to the goods of love and the truths of faith, for "a
man" denotes the church, and "an angel," heaven. Unless it were known
what is signified by "the holy Jerusalem," by its "gate" and its "wall,"
by the number "twelve thousand furlongs," and by "the measure of the
wall being a hundred forty and four," also what by "measure," what by "a
man," and what by "an angel," who would ever know what is meant by "the
measure of the city being twelve thousand furlongs," and "the measure of
the wall a hundred forty and four cubits, the measure of a man, that is,
of an angel"? \[3\] The like is signified by "measurement" in Zechariah:
I lifted up mine eyes again and saw a man in whose hand was a measuring
line. I said, Whither goest thou? He said, To measure Jerusalem, to see
what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof (Zech.
2:1-2). Also in Ezekiel, where a man who had a measuring reed measured
the houses of the new city, and also the temple, as to the outer walls,
the inner walls, the gates, the foundations, the thresholds, the
windows, the steps (Ezek. 40-42). Unless these measurements signified
the states of the matter in respect to truth and good, such things would
never have been mentioned. By "measuring" in general is signified the
state of truth and good; as in these passages: Thus said Jehovah, If the
heavens above shall be measured, and the foundations of the earth
searched out beneath, behold still will I disapprove the seed of Israel
for all that they have done. Behold the days come in which the city
shall be built to Jehovah. And the measuring line shall go out more
fully over the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah (Jer.
31:37-39). Who hath measured the waters in His fist, and meted out the
heavens with the span, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the
hills in a balance? (Isa. 40:12).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9604.">9604.</span></span>

Five curtains shall be joined together one to the other; and five
curtains shall be joined together one to the other. That this signifies
the constant communication of truth with good, and of good with truth,
is evident from the signification of "five," as being all things of one
side, for by "ten" are signified all things of the whole (see n. 9595);
and from the signification of the "curtains," as being the interior
truths of faith, which are of the new understanding (see also n. 9595).
Hence, as five of the ten curtains were joined together, and also the
other five, they therefore signified the reciprocal communication of
truth and good, and of good and truth; for the communications must be
reciprocal in order that there may be a conjugial conjunction of truth
and good. The like things are signified by these curtains as by the
things that belong to the left side and the right side in man. Those
which belong to his right side relate to the good from which is truth,
but those of the left side relate to the truth which is from good; and
in the middle of these there is the communication of good with truth,
and of truth with good, from which there results a perpetual and
constant conjunction. Such are the things signified by the words, "five
curtains shall be joined together one to the other, and five curtains
shall be joined together one to the other."

<span class="margnote"><span id="9605.">9605.</span></span>

And thou shalt make loops of blue. That this signifies conjunction
through the celestial love of truth, is evident from the signification
of "loops," as being conjunction (that "loops" denote conjunction is
because a joining together is effected by means of them), and from the
signification of "blue" \[hyacinthinum\] as being the celestial love of
truth (see n. 9466).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9606.">9606.</span></span>

Upon the edge of the one curtain at the extremity in the joining. That
this signifies the conjunction of one sphere with the other, is evident
from the signification of "the edge of a curtain at the extremity in the
joining," as being where one ceases and the other begins, and thus the
common boundary where the two are joined together. That the sphere is
what is signified is because in heaven spheres conjoin. For there are
spheres which proceed from each angelic society in heaven, and from each
angel in a society. These spheres, with everyone, exhale from the life
of the affections of truth and of good, and are thence diffused to a
distance. From this it is that the quality of spirits and of angels is
known at a distance. Angels and angelic societies are conjoined, and are
also disjoined, in accordance with these spheres; for similar spheres,
that is, similar affections of truth and good, conjoin; and dissimilar
spheres disjoin. (But see what has been already shown concerning these
spheres in n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504-1520, 1695, 2401, 2489, 4464, 5179,
6206, 6598-6613, 7454, 8630, 8794, 8797, 9490-9492, 9498, 9534.) Whether
you say angels and angelic societies, from which the spheres proceed, or
truth and good, it is the same; for the spheres are from the affections
of truth and good, by virtue of which angels are angels from the Lord.
Be it known that insofar as these spheres derive anything from the Lord,
so far they conjoin; but insofar as they derive it from the angel's own,
so far they disjoin. From this it is evident that the Lord alone
conjoins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9607.">9607.</span></span>

And so shalt thou do in the edge of the uttermost curtain in the second
joining together. That this signifies thus reciprocally, that is, that
the conjunction of the one sphere with the other is through the
celestial love of truth, is evident without further explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9608.">9608.</span></span>

Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain. That this signifies
complete conjunction in the ultimates of the spheres, is evident from
the signification of "fifty," as being what is full (see n. 2252); from
the signification of "loops," as being conjunction (as just above, n.
9605); and from the signification of "the edge of the curtain" where the
loops were, as being where the sphere of truth ceases (of which also
above, n. 9606), thus in the ultimates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9609.">9609.</span></span>

And fifty loops shalt thou make in the extremity of the curtain that is
in the second joining together. That this signifies in like manner
reciprocally, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9610.">9610.</span></span>

The loops shall be taken up one to the other. That this signifies
complete conjunction on both sides, is evident from the signification of
"the loops," as being conjunction (see n. 9605); and that it is complete
on both sides is signified by "the taking up of one by the other"
mutually and reciprocally; for when there is a taking up mutually and
reciprocally, complete conjunction is effected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9611.">9611.</span></span>

And thou shalt make fifty hooks of gold. That this signifies a full
capability of conjunction from good, is evident from the signification
of "fifty," as being what is full (see n. 9608); from the signification
of "the hooks," as being the capability of conjunction, for the
capability of conjunction is inherent in them from their form, which is
that of something bent backward or curved inward; and from the
signification of "gold," as being good (n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914,
6917, 9490, 9510).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9612.">9612.</span></span>

And thou shalt join together the curtains one to the other in the hooks.
That this signifies the method of the conjunction everywhere, is evident
from the signification of "joining together the curtains with the
hooks," as being the method of the conjunction; for when by the "fifty
hooks" is signified a full capability of conjunction, then by "joining
together the curtains one to the other with the hooks," is signified the
method.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9613.">9613.</span></span>

And it shall be one Habitation. That this signifies the whole heaven
thus altogether one, is evident from the signification of "the
Habitation," as being heaven (see n. 9594). That heaven is one when it
is so conjoined, is manifest; for heaven consists of myriads of angelic
societies, and yet the Lord leads them as one angel, or as one man. The
reason of this is that among all there is mutual love from the love of
the Lord. When this love is among all, and in all, then all can be
disposed into a heavenly form, which is such that many are a one, and
the more in number they are, the more strongly they are a one. The case
herein is like that of the countless things in the human body, which,
though distinct and various, yet make a one. The reason is that they are
in a form like that of heaven, for the two correspond, as has been shown
at the end of many chapters; and from this correspondence they are in
mutual love, and in this way are conjoined. Hence it is that the man who
is in the good of love and of faith is a heaven in the least form (n.
9279); and that before the Lord the whole heaven is as one man (see n.
9276). \[2\] All the conjunction of the countless angelic societies in
heaven, together with the methods of their conjunction, was represented
in the form of the construction of the Habitation and of the Tent, as
treated of in this chapter. But these methods of conjunction, such as
they are in heaven, cannot come from this to a man's idea, for the
reason that man does not even know that heaven was represented by the
Habitation; and even if he knew this, still he does not know that the
heavenly societies have been so joined together by means of love as to
represent a one. But all these things flow fully into the idea of the
angels, when these things relating to the Habitation are read; for each
and all things of the description have an internal sense, which when
made manifest by the Lord before the angels, exhibits the state of
conjunction together, by means of the love which is from the Lord, of
all in the universal heaven. \[3\] The conjunction of the angelic
societies into one heaven has reference to these laws: 1. Everyone in
the form of the heavens comes forth in accordance with the heavenly
harmony of many associated together. 2. Love is spiritual conjunction,
whence comes heavenly harmony. 3. There must be a universal bond, in
order that all the individuals may be held together in conjunction. 4.
The universal bond must flow into the individual bonds, and must make
them. 5. The universal bond is the Lord, thus love from Him, and
consequently love to Him. 6. The individual bonds are derived from this,
and are those of mutual love, or of charity toward the neighbor. These
are the laws by virtue of which heaven, consisting of innumerable
angelic societies, is nevertheless as one man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9614.">9614.</span></span>

Verses 7-14. And thou shalt make curtains of goats' \[hair\] for a Tent
over the Habitation, eleven curtains shalt thou make them. The length of
one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth four cubits, for one
curtain; one measure for the eleven curtains. And thou shalt join
together five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves,
and shalt double the sixth curtain over against the faces of the Tent.
And thou shalt make fifty loops upon the edge of the one uttermost
curtain in the joining, and fifty loops upon the edge of the curtain of
the second joining. And thou shalt make fifty hooks of brass, and thou
shalt bring the hooks into the loops, and shalt join together the Tent,
that it may be one. And that which superaboundeth over and above in the
curtains of the Tent, the half of the curtain that is over and above
thou shalt make to superabound over the hinder parts of the Habitation.
And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side, in that
which is over and above in the length of the curtains of the Tent, shall
superabound over the sides of the Habitation on this side and on that,
to cover it. And thou shalt make for the Tent a covering of skins of red
rams, and a covering of badgers' skins above. "And thou shalt make
curtains of goats' \[hair\] for a tent over the Habitation" signifies
the external of heaven, which is from the truths that are from external
celestial good; "eleven curtains shalt thou make them" signifies all the
truths from which it is; "the length of one curtain shall be thirty
cubits" signifies the fullness of truth from good; "and the breadth four
cubits" signifies the marriage of truth with good; "for one curtain"
signifies thus in each of the truths; "one measure for the eleven
curtains" signifies a like state of the matter; "and thou shalt join
together five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves"
signifies the constant communication of truth with good, and of good
with truth; "and shalt double the sixth curtain over against the faces
of the Tent" signifies the communication of all who are of that heaven
with the extremes there, and influx thence into the ultimate heaven;
"and thou shalt make fifty loops upon the edge of the one uttermost
curtain in the joining" signifies the complete conjunction of one sphere
with the other; "and fifty loops upon the edge of the curtain of the
second joining" signifies in like manner reciprocally; "and thou shalt
make fifty hooks of brass" signifies a full capability of conjunction by
external good; "and thou shalt bring the hooks into the loops" signifies
the method of the conjunction; "and shalt join together the Tent, that
it may be one" signifies the external of heaven thus altogether one;
"and that which superaboundeth over and above in the curtains of the
Tent" signifies that which proceeds; "the half of the curtain that is
over and above, thou shalt make to superabound over the hinder parts of
the Habitation" signifies to the ultimate of this heaven; "and the cubit
on the one side, and the cubit on the other side, in that which is over
and above in the length of the curtains of the Tent, shall superabound
over the sides of the habitation, on this side and that, to cover it"
signifies the method by which this ultimate proceeds from good, in order
that heaven may be rendered safe; "and thou shalt make a covering for
the Tent" signifies the circumference of this heaven; "of skins of red
rams" signifies external truths from good; "and a covering of badgers'
skins above" signifies outside of these from external good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9615.">9615.</span></span>

And thou shalt make curtains of goats' \[hair\] for a Tent over the
Habitation. That this signifies the external of heaven which is from the
truths that are from external celestial good is evident from the
signification of "curtains" as being the interior truths of faith (see
n. 9595), here the exterior truths of faith, because they were for the
Tent that was over the Habitation; from the signification of "goats'
hair," of which these curtains were made, as being external celestial
good (n. 9470); and from the signification of "the Tent over the
Habitation" as being the external of heaven, for by "the Habitation" is
signified heaven (n. 9594), and by "the Tent which covered it over," the
external of the same. From this it is plain that by "the curtains of
goats' hair for the Tent over the Habitation," are signified the truths
which are from external celestial good, from which is the external of
heaven. But how the case herein is cannot be known unless there is known
what is the external and the internal of each heaven, and the influx of
one heaven into the other; for the Lord flows into all the heavens both
immediately and mediately (see n. 9223); mediately through the inmost
heaven into the middle heaven, and through the internal of this latter
into its external.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9616.">9616.</span></span>

Eleven curtains shalt thou make them. That this signifies all the truths
from which it is, is evident from the signification of "eleven," as
being all (of which below); and from the signification of "the curtains
of goats' hair," as being truths from external celestial good (of which
just above, n. 9615). That "eleven" signifies all, is because ten
curtains constituted the Tent itself, and the eleventh superabounded as
what was over and above upon the hinder parts of the Habitation (as can
be seen from verses 9, 12, 13, which follow). That "ten" denotes all,
may be seen above (n. 4638, 9595).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9617.">9617.</span></span>

The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits. That this signifies
the fullness of truth from good, is evident from the signification of
"length," as being good (see n. 9487); from the signification of a
"curtain," as being truth from external celestial good (n. 9615); and
from the signification of "thirty," as being what is full (n. 9082).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9618.">9618.</span></span>

And the breadth four cubits. That this signifies the marriage of truth
with good, may be seen above (n. 9601).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9619.">9619.</span></span>

For one curtain. That this signifies thus in each of the truths, is
evident from the signification of "curtain," of which also above (n.
9602), where the same words occur.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9620.">9620.</span></span>

One measure for the eleven curtains. That this signifies a like state of
the matter, is evident from what has been shown above (n. 9603).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9621.">9621.</span></span>

And thou shalt join together five curtains by themselves, and six
curtains by themselves. That this signifies the constant communication
of truth with good, and of good with truth, may be seen above (n. 9604).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9622.">9622.</span></span>

And shalt double the sixth curtain over against the faces of the Tent.
That this signifies the communication of all who are of this heaven with
the extremes there, and influx from thence into the ultimate heaven, is
evident from the fact that the doubling of this curtain was an extension
over the extremity of the Habitation; for by the curtains and their
extension was represented heaven in respect to communication and influx,
consequently by the doubling and extension of the sixth curtain over the
extremity of the Habitation was represented the communication of all who
are of this heaven with the extremes there, and influx thence into the
ultimate heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9623.">9623.</span></span>

And thou shalt make fifty loops upon the edge of the one uttermost
curtain in the joining. That this signifies the complete conjunction of
one sphere with the other; and that "fifty loops upon the edge of the
curtain of the second joining," signifies in like manner reciprocally,
is evident from what has been shown above (n. 9605-9609).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9624.">9624.</span></span>

And thou shalt make fifty hooks of brass. That this signifies a full
capability of conjunction by external good, is evident from the
signification of "fifty hooks," as being a full capability of
conjunction (of which above, n. 9611); and from the signification of
"brass," as being natural or external good (n. 425, 1551).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9625.">9625.</span></span>

And thou shalt bring the hooks into the loops. That this signifies the
method of the conjunction, is evident from the fact that when by "the
hooks" is signified the capability of conjunction (of which just above,
n. 9624), by "bringing them into the loops," and thereby joining the
curtains together, is signified the method of the conjunction, as also
by "joining the curtains together one to the other with the hooks" (n.
9612).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9626.">9626.</span></span>

And shalt join the Tent together, that it may be one. That this
signifies the external of heaven thus altogether one, is evident from
the signification of "the Tent," as being the external of heaven (see n.
9615); that it denotes thus altogether one, may be seen above (n. 9613),
where the Habitation is treated of, by which is signified the internal
of heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9627.">9627.</span></span>

And that which superaboundeth over and above in the curtains of the
Tent. That this signifies that which proceeds, is evident from the
signification of "that which superaboundeth over and above," as being
that which proceeds (of which in what follows); and from the
signification of "the curtains of the Tent," as being the truths from
external celestial good that constitute the external of heaven, which is
signified by "the Tent" (see n. 9615). That "that which superaboundeth
over and above the curtains" denotes that which proceeds, is because it
proceeds by continuity from the expansion itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9628.">9628.</span></span>

The half of the curtain that is over and above, thou shalt make to
superabound over the hinder parts of the Habitation. That this signifies
that which proceeds to the ultimate of heaven, is evident from the
signification of "that which superaboundeth," as being that which
proceeds (see just above, n. 9627); and from the signification of "the
hinder parts of the Habitation," as being the ultimate of heaven, for
"the Habitation" denotes heaven, which is here treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9629.">9629.</span></span>

And the cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side, in that
which is over and above in the length of the curtains of the Tent, shall
superabound over the sides of the Habitation on this side and on that,
to cover it. That this signifies the method by which this ultimate
proceeds from good, in order that heaven may be rendered safe, is
evident from the signification of "that which superaboundeth over the
sides of the Habitation, a cubit on the one side and a cubit on the
other side," as being the ultimate which proceeds (of which above, n.
9627); from the signification of "the length of the curtains of the
Tent," as being truths from good (n. 9617); and from the signification
of "to cover," as being to protect, for that which covers protects from
the assailing evil that would inflict injury. From these significations
gathered into one, there results this meaning, that this ultimate which
proceeds from good is for the purpose that heaven may be rendered safe.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9630.">9630.</span></span>

And thou shalt make a covering for the Tent. That this signifies the
circumference, is evident without explication, for the covering made of
skins of red rams formed a circumference above and around the Tent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9631.">9631.</span></span>

Of skins of red rams. That this signifies external truths from good, is
evident from what has already been said and shown concerning the skins
of red rams (n. 9471).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9632.">9632.</span></span>

And a covering of badgers' skins above. That this signifies outside of
this, namely the circumference from the truths which are from external
good, is evident from the signification of "the covering," as being the
circumference (as just above, n. 9630); from the signification of
"skins," as being external truths (n. 9471); and from the signification
of "badgers," as being goods (also n. 9471). It is needless to further
unfold the things thus far said concerning the Habitation, the Tent, and
the two coverings of the latter, because they are of such a nature as by
reason of ignorance would fall with difficulty into the idea of thought;
for where there is ignorance there is blindness, thus no reception of
light, and consequently no idea of the subject. For few if any know that
heaven is represented and thus described by the Habitation, and its
external by the Tent with its two coverings. The reason why these things
are unknown, is that scarcely anyone knows that heavenly things are
signified by all those which are in the Word, thus that there is an
internal sense which is spiritual in each thing therein; and that this
sense does not appear in the letter, but only from the letter to those
who have been instructed about correspondences, and who while they read
the Word are in enlightenment from the Lord. \[2\] Nay, scarcely anyone
knows that the man who is in the good of love and of faith is a heaven
in the least form, and that such a man, both as to his interiors and his
exteriors, corresponds to heaven (n. 9276). If these things had been
known, the well-informed in the Christian world, who have acquired some
knowledge of the forms of the human body, might have been in some
intellectual light, and consequently in some idea about heaven, and then
might have apprehended what things in heaven are represented by the ark,
its propitiatory \[mercy seat\], and the cherubs over it; what by the
table upon which were the breads of faces, and by the lampstand, and by
the golden altar of incense; also what things are represented by the
Habitation, its curtains, planks, and bases; and further by the Tent and
its two coverings; for like things occur with man, in his internals and
in his externals, and they are also presented in a material form in his
body, to which these internal things exactly correspond. For unless the
external things which are of the body exactly corresponded to the
internal things which are of the understanding and the will, there would
not be any life in the body, and consequently there would not be any
corresponding acts. \[3\] It is said that like things occur in the
tabernacle as in man, because the representatives in nature bear
relation to the human form, and have a signification according to their
relation to it (n. 9496). There are four coverings in man's external
things that encompass and enclose all the interior things, and which are
called coats and skins. To what internal things these correspond may be
seen from experience (n. 5552-5559, 8980). Similar things were
represented in the coverings which constituted the expanse of the
tabernacle. From this the understanding may borrow some light concerning
the forms of heaven; and yet this light would be extinguished with all
those who have not a distinct knowledge of the things that are in the
human body, and who have not at the same time a distinct knowledge of
the spiritual things of faith and the celestial things of love, to which
these things correspond. As with most people both the latter and the
former things are in shade, nay, in thick darkness, not only from the
lack of knowledge, but also from lack of faith, it is needless to unfold
them further; for, as before said, they would not fall into any idea,
because of the lack of intellectual light on such subjects.

Verses 15-30. And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation of
shittim wood, standing up. Ten cubits shall be the length of a plank,
and a cubit and half a cubit the breadth of one plank. Two hands shall
there be in one plank, combined one to the other; thus shalt thou make
for all the planks of the Habitation. And thou shalt make the planks for
the Habitation twenty planks for the corner of the south toward the
south. And thou shalt make forty bases of silver under the twenty
planks; two bases under one plank for its two hands, and two bases under
one plank for its two hands. And for the other side of the Habitation,
at the corner of the north, twenty planks; and their forty bases of
silver; two bases under one plank, and two bases under one plank. And
for the two legs of the Habitation toward the sea thou shalt make six
planks. And two planks shalt thou make for the corners of the Habitation
in the two legs. And they shall be twinned from beneath, and they shall
be twinned together at the head of it unto one ring; thus shall it be
for them both; they shall be at the two corners. And there shall be
eight planks, and their bases of silver, sixteen bases; two bases under
one plank, and two bases under one plank. And thou shalt make bars of
shittim wood; five for the planks of the one side of the Habitation, and
five bars for the planks of the other side of the Habitation, and five
bars for the planks of the side of the Habitation at the two legs toward
the sea. And the middle bar in the middle of the planks shall pass
through from extremity to extremity. And thou shalt overlay the planks
with gold, and make their rings of gold, houses for the bars; and thou
shalt overlay the bars with gold. And thou shalt set up the Habitation
according to the method which thou wast made to see in the mountain.
"And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation" signifies the good
which supports this heaven; "of shittim wood" signifies that it is the
good of merit from the Lord's Divine Human; "ten cubits shall be the
length of a plank" signifies this good the all in all; "and a cubit and
half a cubit the breadth of one plank" signifies the truth from which it
conjoins, as much as is sufficient; "two hands shall there be in one
plank" signifies power from it; "combined one to the other" signifies
the consequent conjunction of the Lord with those who are in this
heaven; "thus shalt thou make for all the planks of the Habitation"
signifies thus everywhere; "and thou shalt make the planks for the
Habitation twenty" signifies the good which supports heaven in every way
and completely; "the planks for the corner of the south toward the
south" signifies even into its interior and inmost things where truth is
in light; "and thou shalt make forty bases of silver" signifies a full
support by means of truth; "under the twenty planks" signifies which
proceeds from the good that is from the Lord's Divine Human; "two bases
under one plank" signifies its conjunction with good; "for its two
hands" signifies the consequent power; "and two bases under one plank
for its two hands" signifies thus in each and all things; "and for the
other side of the Habitation, at the corner of the north" signifies
toward the exteriors of this heaven where truth is in obscurity; "twenty
planks" signifies the good which supports in every way and completely;
"and their forty bases of silver" signifies there also a full support by
means of truth; "two bases under one plank" signifies through
conjunction with good; "and two bases under one plank" signifies
everywhere; "and for the two legs of the Habitation toward the sea"
signifies conjunction with heaven where good is in obscurity; "thou
shalt make six planks" signifies where good from the Lord's Divine Human
is wholly; "and two planks shalt thou make for the corners of the
Habitation in the two legs" signifies the quality of the conjunction
there with good; "and they shall be twinned from beneath, and they shall
be twinned together at the head of it" signifies conjunction from the
exterior and from the interior; "unto one ring" signifies thus
endurance; "thus shall it be for them both; they shall be at the two
corners" signifies a like conjunction everywhere; "and there shall be
eight planks, and their bases of silver" signifies support in every way
by good through the truth which is from good; "sixteen bases" signifies
complete support; "two bases under one plank, and two bases under one
plank" signifies through the conjunction of truth with good everywhere;
"and thou shalt make bars of shittim wood" signifies the power of truth
from good; "five for the planks of the one side of the Habitation"
signifies whereby it looks toward the interiors of heaven where truth is
in light; "and five bars for the planks of the other side of the
Habitation" signifies the power of truth from good whereby it looks
toward the exteriors where truth is in obscurity; "and five bars for the
planks of the side of the Habitation at the two legs toward the sea"
signifies the power of truth from good whereby it looks toward this
heaven where there is conjunction with good which is in obscurity; "and
the middle bar in the middle of the planks shall pass through from
extremity to extremity" signifies the primary power from which the
powers are everywhere continued; "and thou shalt overlay the planks with
gold, and make their rings of gold, houses for the bars, and thou shalt
overlay the bars with gold" signifies a representative of good from
which and through which are all things; "and thou shalt set up the
Habitation according to the method which thou wast made to see in the
mountain" signifies toward the quarters according to the states of good
and of the derivative truth in the heaven which is represented.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9634.">9634.</span></span>

And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation. That this signifies
the good which supports this heaven is evident from the signification of
"the planks" as being the good which supports (of which below); and from
the signification of "the Habitation" as being the middle or second
heaven (see n. 9594). That "the planks" denote the good which supports,
is because they were of wood, and supported the curtains of both the
Habitation and the Tent, and also the two coverings over them.
Consequently by "the planks" are signified supports, and because they
were of wood, they signified supports which are from good; for
everything that is of wood signifies good, even to the very houses that
are of wood (n. 3720); the quality of the good is signified by the
"shittim wood" of which the planks were made. As all the representatives
in nature bear relation to the human form, and have a signification in
accordance with this relation (n. 9496), so also do the planks of the
Habitation. These planks correspond to the muscular or fleshy part in
man, which supports the encompassing membranes and skins; by "flesh"
also is signified good (n. 7850, 9127). From this it is that the planks
were of shittim wood, by which is signified the good which supports
heaven (n. 9472, 9486); also that they were overlaid with gold, by which
also is signified good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9635.">9635.</span></span>

Of shittim wood. That this signifies the good of merit from the Lord's
Divine Human, is evident from the signification of "shittim wood," as
being the good of merit from the Lord's Divine Human (see n. 9472,
9486). (That this good is the only good which reigns in heaven, and
supports it, see n. 9486.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="9636.">9636.</span></span>

Ten cubits shall be the length of a plank. That this signifies this good
the all in all, is evident from the signification of "ten," as being all
(see n. 4638, 9595); and from the signification of "length," as being
good (n. 1613, 8898, 9487, 9600), here the good which supports, which is
the good of merit; for this is signified by the planks of the Habitation
being made of shittim wood (n. 9635). That this good is the all in all
of heaven, is because this good is the very Divine good which makes the
heavens and sustains them (n. 9486); for the good which is with the
angels is good itself, because all good is from the Lord; good from any
other source is not good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9637.">9637.</span></span>

And a cubit and half a cubit the breadth of one plank. That this
signifies the truth from it which conjoins, as much as is sufficient, is
evident from the signification of "one and a half," as being what is
full (see n. 9487-9489), thus also as much as is sufficient, for this is
what is full. The reason why this truth is from it, that is, from the
good which is signified by "the planks of shittim wood" (n. 9634, 9635),
is that every good has its truth, and every truth its good. Good without
truth does not appear, and truth without good does not exist, for truth
is the form of good, and good is the being of truth. It is from form
that good appears, and it is from being that truth exists. The case
herein is like that of flame and light; flame without light does not
appear, and therefore it emits from itself light that it may appear; and
light without flame does not exist. It is the same with man's will and
his understanding; the will does not appear without the understanding,
and the understanding does not exist without the will. As it is with
good and truth, or with flame and light, or again with the will and
understanding, even so it is with love and faith, for all good is of
love, and all truth is of faith from love; and man's will has been
allotted to the reception of the good which is of love, and his
understanding to the reception of the truth which is of faith. Moreover,
love is the flame or fire of life, and faith is the light of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9638.">9638.</span></span>

Two hands shall there be in one plank. That this signifies power from
it, namely, through truth from good, is evident from the signification
of "hands," as being power (see n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328,
6292, 6947, 7011, 7188, 7189, 7518, 7673, 8050, 8153, 8281, 9133; and
that all power is through truth from good, n. 6344, 6423, 9327, 9410).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9639.">9639.</span></span>

Combined the one to the other. That this signifies the consequent
conjunction of the Lord with those who are in this heaven, is evident
from the signification of "to be combined," when said of the power which
is signified by "the hands," as being conjunction through truth from
good. For all who are in heaven are called "powers," and also are
powers, from the fact that they are receptions of the Divine truth which
is from the Lord; therefore also by "angels" in the Word are signified
truths Divine (see n. 8192). It is the Divine good proceeding from the
Lord that conjoins all in heaven; for it is the Divine good that reigns
universally in Divine truths, and that which reigns universally,
conjoins. This conjunction is what is signified by the "combining of the
hands of each plank the one to the other."

<span class="margnote"><span id="9640.">9640.</span></span>

Thus shalt thou make for all the planks of the Habitation. That this
signifies thus everywhere, is evident from the signification of " all,"
when said of heaven, as being everywhere, for that which is done there
to all is done everywhere; and from the signification of "the planks of
the Habitation," as being the good which supports heaven (see n. 9634).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9641.">9641.</span></span>

And thou shalt make the planks for the Habitation twenty. That this
signifies good which supports heaven in every way and completely, is
evident from the signification of "the planks of the Habitation," as
being the good which supports heaven (see n. 9634); and from the
signification of "twenty," as being what is full, thus in every way and
completely. That "twenty" has this signification, is because numbers
formed by multiplication have the same signification as the simple
numbers from which they have been multiplied (n. 5291, 5335, 5708,
7973); thus the number "twenty" signifies the same as "ten," and "two,"
from the multiplication of which it arises. (That "ten" denotes what is
full, and all, see n. 3107, 4638; and in like manner "two," n. 9103,
9166.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="9642.">9642.</span></span>

The planks for the corner of the south toward the south. That this
signifies even into its interior and inmost things where truth is in
light, is evident from the signification of "the planks of the
Habitation," as being the good which supports heaven (see n. 9634); from
the signification of a "corner," when said of the quarters of the world,
as being where that state is which is marked out and signified by the
quarter (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "the
south toward the south," as being the interior and inmost things where
truth is in its light; for by "the south" is signified a state of light,
which is a state of intelligence from truths, and thus an interior
state; for light (and with the light intelligence and wisdom) in the
heavens, increases toward more interior things; and farther from these
truth is in shade, which state of truth is signified by "the north."
From this then it is that by "the corner of the south toward the south"
is signified even to the interior and inmost things where truth is in
light. \[2\] The same is signified by "the south" or "noonday" in
Isaiah: I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not
back; bring My sons from far, and My daughters from the end of the earth
(Isa. 43:6). In this passage a new church is treated of; "saying to the
north" denotes to those who are in darkness or ignorance concerning the
truths of faith, who are the nations outside the church; "saying to the
south" denotes to those who are in light from the knowledges of good and
truth, who are those who are within the church; wherefore it is said to
the latter that they should "not keep back," but to the former that they
should "give up." \[3\] In Ezekiel: Set thy faces toward the south, and
drop toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the field unto
the south; and say to the forest of the south, Behold, I kindle a fire
in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and all faces
from the south to the north shall be burned. Set thy faces toward
Jerusalem, and drop against the holy places, and prophesy against the
land of Israel (Ezek. 20:46, 47; 21:2). "The south" here denotes those
who are in the light of truth from the Word, thus those who are of the
church, but who are in falsities which they confirm from the sense of
the letter of the Word wrongly unfolded; whence it is said, "the forest
of the field unto the south," and "the forest of the south." A "forest"
denotes where memory-knowledge reigns; but a "garden," where truth
reigns. From this it is plain what is signified by "setting the faces
toward the south, and dropping \[words\] toward the south, and
prophesying against the forest of the field unto the south;" and
afterward by "setting the faces toward Jerusalem, and dropping against
the holy places, and prophesying against the land of Israel; for
"Jerusalem" and "the land of Israel" denote the church, and "the holy
places" there denote the things which are of the church. \[4\] In
Isaiah: If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and sate the afflicted
soul; then thy light shall arise in darkness, and thy thick darkness
shall be as the noonday (Isa. 58:10); where "darkness" and "thick
darkness" denote ignorance of truth and good; while "light" and "the
noonday" denote the understanding of them. Again: Bring forth counsel,
execute judgment; make thy shadow like the night in the midst of the
noonday; hide the outcasts; reveal not the wanderer (Isa. 16:3); where
"in the midst of the noonday" denotes in the midst of the light of
truth. In Jeremiah: Sanctify ye the battle against the daughter of Zion;
arise, and let us go up into the south, for the day is going away, for
the shadows of the evening have been bent down (Jer. 6:4); where "going
up into the south" denotes against the church, in which truth is in
light from the Word. In Amos: I will make the sun go down at noon, and I
will darken the earth in the day of light (Amos 8:9); denoting the
extinguishing of all the light of truth from the Word. \[5\] In David:
Thou shalt not be afraid for the dread of night, nor for the arrow that
flieth by day; for the pestilence in the thick darkness, for the death
that wasteth at noonday (Ps. 91:5, 6); "the dread of night" denotes the
falsities of evil which are from hell; "the arrow that flieth by day,"
the falsity which is openly taught; "the death that wasteth at noonday,"
the evil which is openly lived in, whereby truth is destroyed where it
can be in its light from the Word. \[6\] Again: The prophecy of the
wilderness of the sea. As whirlwinds from the south, to pass through; it
cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land (Isa. 21:1). The
he-goat of the goats magnified himself exceedingly; and his horn grew
toward the south, and toward the east, and toward comeliness; and it
grew even unto the army of the heavens, and some of the army and of the
stars it cast down to the earth, and trampled upon them (Dan. 8:8-10).
The subject here treated of is the state of the future church, and it is
foretold that the church will perish through the doctrine of faith
separated from the good of charity; "the he-goat of the goats" denotes
such a faith (n. 4169, 4769); its "horn growing toward the south"
denotes the power of falsity therefrom against truths; "toward the east"
denotes against goods; "toward comeliness" denotes against the church;
"unto the army of the heavens" denotes against all the goods and truths
of heaven; "casting down to the earth some of the army and of the stars"
denotes to destroy these goods and truths, and the very knowledges of
good and truth (n. 4697). \[7\] In the same prophet is described a war
between the king of the south and the king of the north (chap. 11), and
by "the king of the south" is signified the light of truth from the
Word, and by "the king of the north" reasoning from memory-knowledges
about truths; the alternations that the church was to undergo until it
should perish, are described by the various events of this war. \[8\] As
"the south" signified truth in light, it was ordained that the tribes of
Reuben, Simeon, and Gad should encamp "toward the south" (Num. 2:10-15);
the encampments represented the setting in order of all things in the
heavens in accordance with the truths and goods of faith and love (see
n. 4236, 8103, 8193, 8196); and "the twelve tribes" which encamped
signified all truths and goods in the complex (n. 3858, 3862, 3926,
3939, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640, 7836, 7891, 7996, 7997); by "the
tribe of Reuben" was signified the truth of faith in doctrine (n. 3861,
3866, 5542); by "the tribe of Simeon," the derivative truth of faith in
life (n. 3869-3872, 4497, 4502, 4503, 5482); and by "the tribe of Gad"
were signified works from these truths (n. 6404, 6405). This shows why
these tribes were encamped "toward the south;" for all things of truth,
that is, of faith, belong to "the south," because they belong to light.
\[9\] From all this it is now evident what is signified by "the corner
of the south," namely, where the state of truth is in light. For all
states of the good of love and of the truth of faith are signified by
"the four corners of the earth"-states of the good of love by "the
corner of the east, and the corner of the west," and states of the truth
of faith by "the corner of the south," and "the corner of the north." In
like manner by "the four winds" in these passages: Angels standing on
the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth,
that the wind should not blow on the earth (Rev. 7:1). Satan shall go
forth to seduce the nations which are in the four corners of the earth
(Rev. 20:8). He shall send His angels, and they shall gather together
His elect from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to the ends
of them (Matt. 24:31). Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe
into these slain, that they may live (Ezek. 37:9). \[10\] As by these
"winds," that is, by these "quarters," were signified all things of good
and of truth, thus all things of heaven and of the church, and by "the
temple" was signified heaven or the church, therefore it has been
customary from ancient times to place temples in an east and west
direction, because "the east" signified the good of love in its rising,
and "the west," the good of love in its going down. This had its origin
from the representatives in which were the ancients who belonged to the
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9643.">9643.</span></span>

And thou shalt make forty bases of silver. That this signifies full
support by means of truth, is evident from the signification of "forty,"
as being what is full (see n. 9437); from the signification of "bases,"
as being support, for bases support; and from the signification of
"silver," as being truth (n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6112, 6914, 6917, 7999).
The reason why the bases were of "silver," and the planks were overlaid
with "gold," was that by the "planks" is signified good, and by the
"bases" truth, and good has power and thus support through truth (that
good has power through truth, see n. 6344, 6423, 9327, 9410; also that
"gold" signifies good, and "silver" truth, n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658,
6914, 6917, 8932, 9490, 9510). That good has power through truth, is
because truth is the form of good, and good has quality thereby; for
where there is quality, there is form. In this way good has that whereby
it can work on other things in this or in that manner. From this it is
that good has ability, but not determined to anything except by means of
truth. Ability determined is actual power, consequently is supporting
power. \[2\] Moreover, the bases correspond to the feet and soles of the
feet in man; and in general to the bones which support all the fleshy
part of the body; and by "the feet" and "the bones" in like manner is
signified the truth which supports; and by "the fleshy part" in the body
is signified the good which supports itself by means of truth. (That all
things in nature bear relation to the human form, and have a
signification in accordance with their relation to it, see n. 9496; also
that "flesh" signifies good, n. 3813, 6968, 7850, 9127; that "the feet"
denote what is natural, thus truth in power from good, n. 5327, 5328;
that "the body" signifies good, n. 6135; and "the bones," truth
supporting, n. 3812e, 8005.) \[3\] It is for this reason also that a
"foundation," which is a common base, denotes the truth of faith, and
faith itself, as can be seen from the passages in the Word where a
"foundation" is spoken of; as in Isaiah: Do ye not know? Do ye not hear?
Do ye not understand the foundations of the earth? (Isa. 40:21). He who
does not know what is signified by a "foundation," and what by "the
earth," has no other idea than that the lowest parts of the earth are
here meant by "the foundations of the earth," although he may perceive,
if he pays attention, that something else is meant; for what would it be
to know, to hear, and to understand the foundations of the earth ? From
this it can be seen that by "the foundations of the earth" are signified
such things as belong to the church. That "the earth" in the Word
denotes the church, is very evident from the passages in the Word where
"the earth" is mentioned (see what has been cited above, n. 9325); and
that its "foundations" denote the truths of faith, for these truths
serve the church for foundations, as can also be seen further from the
following passages. In David: They acknowledge not, neither do they
understand; they walk in darkness; all the foundations of the earth
totter (Ps. 82:5); that the foundations of the earth do not "totter,"
but the truths of the church with those who do not know, who do not
understand, and who walk in darkness, is clear. Again: The earth was
shaken and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains were agitated,
and were shaken (Ps. 18:7); where "mountains" denote the goods of love
(n. 795, 4210, 6435, 8327), and their "foundations," the truths of
faith. And in Isaiah: The cataracts from on high have been opened, and
the foundations of the earth have quaked (Isa. 24:18); As a "foundation"
denotes the truth of faith, and a "city," the doctrine of it, therefore
in the Word "the foundations of the city" is said when the truth of
doctrine is meant; as in David: The channels of waters appeared, and the
foundations of the city <span id="fr_205"></span>[9643-1](#fn_205.md) were
uncovered, by the rebuke of Jehovah (Ps. 18:15). (That a "city" denotes
the doctrine of truth, see n. 402, 2449, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493). \[4\]
From this it can be seen what is signified by "the foundations of the
city of the holy Jerusalem" in John: The wall of the city of the holy
Jerusalem had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve
apostles of the Lamb. The foundations of the wall were adorned with
every precious stone (Rev. 21:14-20). He who does not know what is
signified by "the holy Jerusalem," what by a "city," what by a "wall,"
what by a "foundation," and what by "the twelve apostles," can see
nothing of the secret here hidden; when yet by "the holy Jerusalem" is
meant the New Church of the Lord which will succeed this of ours; by
"the city" is meant doctrine; by a "wall," the truth protecting and
defending; by "the foundations," the truths of faith; and by "the twelve
apostles," all the goods of love and truths of faith in the complex.
From this it can be seen why it is said that there will be "twelve
foundations," and that they will be "adorned with every precious stone;
for a "precious stone" denotes the truth of faith from the good of love
(n. 114, 3858, 6640, 9476); and "the twelve apostles" denote all things
of love and faith in the complex (n. 3488, 3858, 6397). \[5\] From this
it is evident what is here signified by "foundations" in Isaiah: Behold,
I set thy stones with antimony, <span
id="fr_206"></span>[9643-2](#fn_206.md) and lay thy foundations with
sapphires (Isa. 54:11); where "sapphires" denote interior truths (n.
9407). In the same: Jehovah shall smite Asshur with a rod. Then shall be
every passing of the rod of the foundation, upon which Jehovah shall
cause him to rest (Isa. 30:31, 32); "the rod of the foundation" denotes
the power of truth (that a "rod" denotes power, see n. 4013, 4015, 4876,
4936, 6947, 7011, 7026). And in Jeremiah: They shall not take from thee
a stone for a corner, nor a stone of foundations (Jer. 51:26); where "a
stone of foundations" denotes the truths of faith. \[6\] In Job: Where
wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare if thou
knowest intelligence; who hath appointed the measures thereof, if thou
knowest? Upon what were its bases? or who laid the cornerstone thereof?
when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God sounded
(Job 38:4-7)? He who does not know what is signified in the internal
sense by "the earth," by "the measures thereof," and by "the bases,"
also what by a "cornerstone," "morning stars," and "the sons of God,"
sees nothing of the secret therein, believing that it is the earth which
is meant, and also its foundation, measures, bases, and corner stone;
and knowing not at all what is signified by "the morning stars singing,"
and by "the sons of God sounding." But he will come out of darkness into
light as soon as he knows that "the earth" denotes the church; that its
"foundations" denote the truth of faith; its "measures," states of good
and truth; its "bases," the supporting truths themselves; "the
cornerstone," the power of truth; "the morning stars," the knowledges of
good and truth derived from good; and "the sons of God," truths Divine.
The latter are said "to sound" when they come into existence, and the
former "to sing" when they arise.

Under the twenty planks. That this signifies which proceeds from the
good that is from the Lord's Divine Human, is evident from the
signification of "twenty," as being what is full, thus in every way and
completely (see n. 9641); and from the signification of "the planks of
the Habitation," as being the good which supports heaven (n. 9634).
(That this good is the good of merit, thus the good of the Lord's Divine
Human, see n. 7850, 9127; also that this is the only good which reigns
in heaven, n. 9486.) That the truth signified by "the bases" is what
proceeds from this good, is signified by the bases being "under the
planks."

<span class="margnote"><span id="9645.">9645.</span></span>

Two bases under one plank. That this signifies the conjunction of this
truth with good, is evident from the signification of "two," as being
conjunction (see n. 5194, 8423); from the signification of "bases," as
being the truth by means of which there is support (n. 9643); and from
the signification of a "plank," as being the good which supports (as
just above, n. 9644).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9646.">9646.</span></span>

For its two hands. That this signifies the consequent power, is evident
from the signification of "hands," as being power (see n. 9638).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9647.">9647.</span></span>

And two bases under one plank for its two hands. That this signifies
thus in each and all things, is evident from the fact that such bases
and hands were to be applied to every plank, as is involved in the
repetition; and therefore the signification is that so it should be in
all things. Be it known that with man and angel, good together with its
truths is like itself in every particular such as it is in general (see
n. 920, 1040, 1316, 4345), thus in each and all things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9648.">9648.</span></span>

And for the other side of the Habitation at the corner of the north.
That this signifies toward the exteriors of this heaven where truths are
in obscurity, is evident from the signification of "the Habitation," as
being heaven (see n. 9594); and from the signification of "the north,"
as being the exteriors in which truth is in obscurity (n. 3708). From
this it is plain that by "the side of the Habitation at the corner of
the north," is signified toward the exteriors of heaven, where truth is
in obscurity. There are four states to which the four quarters in the
world, namely, the east, the west, the south, and the north, correspond.
The east corresponds to a state of good in its rising, the west to a
state of good in its going down; the south corresponds to a state of
truth in its light; and the north to a state of truth in shade (n.
3708). The state of good to which the east corresponds, and the state of
truth to which the south corresponds, are interior states; and the state
of good to which the west corresponds, and the state of truth to which
the north corresponds, are exterior; for the more interior any state is,
the more perfect it is; and the more exterior it is, the more imperfect,
thus the more obscure. It is for this reason that the higher a man can
be raised toward interior things, the more he comes into the perception
of good, and into the light of truth; and therefore when a man puts off
bodily things, which are the veriest external things, as is the case
when he departs out of the world; if he has lived a life of truth and
good he comes into intelligence and wisdom, and thus into the perception
of every happiness; and into a perception the greater, in proportion as
through a life of good from the doctrine of truth he has suffered
himself to be raised toward the interior things of heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9649.">9649.</span></span>

Twenty planks. That this signifies the good which supports in every way
and completely, is evident from the signification of "twenty," as being
in every way and completely (see n. 9641); and from the signification of
"the planks of the Habitation," as being the good which supports heaven
(n. 9634).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9650.">9650.</span></span>

And their forty bases of silver. This signifies there also a full
support by means of truth (as above, n. 9643).
