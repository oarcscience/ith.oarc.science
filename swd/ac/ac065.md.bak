### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="3201.">3201.</span></span>

Verses 64, 65. And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and saw Isaac, and she
alighted from off the camel. And she said unto the servant, What man is
this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is
my lord. And she took a veil and covered herself. "Rebekah lifted up her
eyes, and saw Isaac," signifies the reciprocal attention of the
affection of truth; "and she alighted from off the camel," signifies the
separation thereof from the memory-knowledges in the natural man at the
perception of rational good; "and she said unto the servant," signifies
exploration from the Divine natural; "what man is this that walketh in
the field to meet us?" signifies concerning the rational which was in
good alone; "and the servant said, It is my lord," signifies
acknowledgment. "And she took a veil and covered herself," signifies the
appearances of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3202.">3202.</span></span>

Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and saw Isaac. That this signifies the
reciprocal attention of the affection of truth, appears from the
signification of "lifting up the eyes and seeing," as being attention
(see n. 3198); here, reciprocal, because it was before said of Isaac
that he "lifted up his eyes and saw," and here it is said of Rebekah,
that she "lifted up her eyes, and saw Isaac;" and also from the
representation of Rebekah, as being the affection of truth, concerning
which see above in many places.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3203.">3203.</span></span>

And she alighted from off the camel. That this signifies the separation
thereof from the memory-knowledges in the natural man at the perception
of rational good, is evident from the signification of "alighting," as
being to be separated; and from the signification of "camels," as being
the memory-knowledges in the natural man (see n. 3048, 3071). That it
was at the perception of the rational good which is represented by
Isaac, is evident. \[2\] What it is to be separated from the natural
man, was stated and shown above (n. 3161, 3175, 3182, 3188, 3190),
namely, that the affection of truth is separated therefrom when it is no
longer a matter of memory-knowledge, but becomes of the life; for when
it becomes of the life, by habit the man becomes imbued with it like his
disposition or nature; and when he is thus imbued with it, it then flows
forth into act as it were spontaneously, and this without his thinking
about it from any memory-knowledge; nay, when it becomes of the life it
can then exercise command over the memory-knowledges, and draw from them
innumerable things which confirm. Such is the case with all truth; in
the first age it is a matter of memory-knowledge, but as the man
advances in age it becomes of the life. The case herein is like that of
children when they are learning to walk, to speak, to think, also to see
from the understanding, and to conclude from the judgment; which things,
when by habit they have become voluntary, and thus spontaneous, vanish
from among matters of memory-knowledge, and flow forth of their own
accord. \[3\] So also is it with those things which are of the
knowledges of spiritual good and truth with men who from the Lord are
being regenerated or born again; in the beginning such men are not
unlike children, and at first spiritual truths are to them mere
memory-knowledges; for doctrinal things, when being learned and inserted
in the memory, are nothing else; but these are successively called forth
thence by the Lord, and are implanted in the life, that is, in good; for
good is life. When this has been effected there takes place as it were a
turning round, namely, that the man begins to act from good, that is,
from life, and no longer as before from memory-knowledge. Thus he who is
being born anew is in this respect like a child (although the things
imbibed are of the spiritual life); until he no longer acts from what is
doctrinal, or truth; but from charity, or good; and when this is the
case, he then for the first time is in a blessed state, and is in
wisdom. \[4\] All this shows what it is to be separated from the
memory-knowledges in the natural man, which is signified by Rebekah's
alighting from off the camel; and this before she knew that it was
Isaac; in which circumstances, as everyone can see, some arcana are
involved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3204.">3204.</span></span>

And she said unto the servant. That this signifies exploration from the
Divine natural, appears from the signification here of "saying," as
denoting to explore; for she asked, "What man is this that walketh in
the field to meet us?" and from the signification of the "servant," as
being the Divine natural (see above, n. 3191, 3192).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3205.">3205.</span></span>

What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? That this
signifies concerning the rational which was in good alone, namely,
exploration respecting it, appears from what was said above concerning
Isaac, that "he went out to meditate in the field," by which is
signified the state of the rational in good (see n. 3196); here, the
rational is signified by "this man;" and its being in good is signified
by "walking" (that is, meditating) "in the field." "To meet us" denotes
for conjunction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3206.">3206.</span></span>

And the servant said, It is my lord. That this signifies acknowledgment,
namely, by the Divine natural, which is here the "servant," is evident
without explication. That initiation is effected by the Divine natural
may be seen above (n. 3192); also that good recognizes its own truth;
and truth its own good (n. 3179).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3207.">3207.</span></span>

And she took a veil and covered herself. That this signifies appearances
of truth is evident from the signification of the veil with which brides
covered the face when they first saw the bridegroom, as being
appearances of truth; for among the ancients brides represented the
affections of truth, and bridegrooms the affections of good; or what is
the same, brides represented the church, which was called a "bride" from
the affection of truth; the affection of good which is from the Lord
being the bridegroom, and hence all through the Word the Lord Himself is
called the "bridegroom." Brides veiled their faces on their first coming
to the bridegroom, in order that they might represent appearances of
truth. Appearances of truth are not truths in themselves, but they
appear as truths; concerning which see below. The affection of truth
cannot approach the affection of good except through appearances of
truth; nor is it stripped of appearances until it is being conjoined;
for then it becomes the truth of good, and becomes genuine insofar as
the good is genuine. \[2\] Good itself is holy, because it is the Divine
proceeding from the Lord, and flows in by the higher way or gate in man;
but insofar as its origin is concerned, truth is not holy; because it
flows in by a lower way or gate, and at first is of the natural man; but
when it is elevated thence toward the rational man it is by degrees
purified; and at the first sight of the affection of good it is
separated from memory-knowledges, and puts on appearances of truth, and
thus comes near to good; an indication that such is its origin, and that
it could not endure the first sight of Divine good until it has entered
into the bridegroom's chamber (that is, into the sanctuary of good), and
the conjunction has been effected; for then truth no longer looks at
good from appearances, or through appearances; but it is looked at from
good apart from them. \[3\] Be it known, however, that neither with man,
nor indeed with an angel, are any truths ever pure, that is, devoid of
appearances; for all both in general and in particular are appearances
of truth; nevertheless they are accepted by the Lord as truths, provided
good is in them. To the Lord alone belong pure truths, because Divine;
for as the Lord is Good itself, so He is Truth itself. But see what has
been said concerning truths and their appearances; namely, that the
coverings and veils of the tent signified appearances of truth (n.
2576); that truths with man are appearances tainted with fallacies (n.
2053); that the rational things of man are appearances of truth (n.
2516); that truths are in appearances (n. 2196, 2203, 2209, 2242); that
Divine good flows into appearances, even into fallacies (n. 2554); that
appearances of truth are adapted by the Lord as if they were truths (n.
1832); that the Word is written according to appearances (n. 1838).
\[4\] But what appearances are may be clearly seen from those passages
of the Word where it speaks according to appearances. There are however
degrees of appearances of truth. Natural appearances of truth are mostly
fallacies; but with those who are in good they are not to be called
fallacies, but appearances, and even in some respects truths; for the
good which is in them, and in which is the Divine, causes another
essence to be in them. But rational appearances of truth are more and
more interior; in them are the heavens, that is, the angels who are in
the heavens (see n. 2576). \[5\] In order that some idea may be formed
of what appearances of truth are, let the following examples serve for
illustration. I. Man believes that he is reformed and regenerated
through the truth of faith; but this is an appearance; he is reformed
and regenerated through the good of faith, that is, through charity
toward the neighbor and love to the Lord. II. Man believes that truth
enables us to perceive what good is, because it teaches; but this is an
appearance; it is good that enables truth to perceive, for good is the
soul or life of truth. III. Man believes that truth introduces to good
when he lives according to the truth which he has learned; but it is
good which flows into truth, and introduces it to itself. IV. It appears
to man that truth perfects good, when yet good perfects truth. V. Goods
of life appear to man to be the fruits of faith; but they are the fruits
of charity. From these few examples it may in some measure be known what
appearances of truth are. Such appearances are innumerable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3208.">3208.</span></span>

Verses 66, 67. And the servant told Isaac all the words that he had
done. And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent. And he took
Rebekah, and she was to him for a woman, and he loved her; and Isaac was
comforted after his mother. "The servant told Isaac all the words that
he had done," signifies perception from the Divine natural, as to how
the case was; "and Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent,"
signifies the sanctuary of truth in the Divine Human; "and He took
Rebekah, and she was to him for a woman, and he loved her," signifies
conjunction; "and Isaac was comforted after his mother" signifies a new
state.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3209.">3209.</span></span>

The servant told Isaac all the words that he had done. That this
signifies perception from the Divine natural as to how the case was,
appears from the signification of "telling" as being to perceive; for
perception is a kind of internal telling; wherefore perceiving, in the
historicals of the Word, is expressed by "telling," and also by "saying"
(n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862); and also from
the signification here of the "servant," as being the Divine natural
(concerning which presently); and from the signification of "words," as
being actual things (see n. 1785); from which considerations it is plain
that "the servant told all the words that he had done," signifies that
Divine good rational perceived from the Divine natural how the case was.
The case herein is this: The rational is in a degree above the natural,
and rational good in the Lord was Divine; but the truth which was to be
elevated out of the natural was not Divine until it was conjoined with
the Divine good of the rational. In order therefore that the good of the
rational might flow into the natural, there must be a medium; this
medium could be nothing else than something natural which should partake
of the Divine; and this is represented by the "elder servant in
Abraham's house, administering all things which he had" (n. 3019, 3020);
and that this "servant" signifies the Divine natural, may be seen above
(n. 3191, 3192, 3204, 3206).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3210.">3210.</span></span>

And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent. That this signifies
the sanctuary of truth in the Divine Human, is evident from the
signification of "tent," as being what is holy (see n. 414, 1102, 2145,
2152, 2576), and thus a sanctuary; and from the signification of "Sarah
the mother," as being Divine truth (see n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065,
2904), of which was born the Divine Human, whose rational is represented
by the son Isaac; whence it is evident that "Isaac brought her into his
mother Sarah's tent," signifies that rational good brought with it the
truth which is represented by Rebekah, into the sanctuary of truth.
\[2\] What the sanctuary of truth is may be seen from what was said
above (n. 3194) concerning the Lord's Divine Human; namely, that the
veriest Divine has Good and Truth; and that the Lord, as to the Divine
Human, came forth from the Divine good, and was born (namely, as to the
Divine Human <span id="fr_87"></span>[3210-1](#fn_87.md) of the Divine
truth; or what is the same, that the very esse of the Lord was Divine
good, but the very existere was Divine truth: from this was the Divine
good rational, with which He conjoined Divine truth from the Human.
Concerning this very deep arcanum more cannot be said. We will only add
that it is the veriest Divine good and truth in the Lord's Divine Human
with which truth from the Human was conjoined, that was signified by the
Sanctuary, or Holy of holies, in the tabernacle, and in the temple; and
its quality was represented by the things therein contained, as by the
golden altar, by the table on which were the showbreads \[panes
propositionis\], by the candlestick, and still more internally by the
propitiatory, and by the ark, and inmostly by the testimony, which was
the law promulgated from Sinai, and which was the very Holy of Holies,
or the Sanctuary of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3211.">3211.</span></span>

And he took Rebekah, and she was to him for a woman, and he loved her.
That this signifies the conjunction, namely, of good and truth, is
evident without explication. The reason it is said that Rebekah was to
him "for a woman," and not for a wife, is that between rational good and
the truth called forth from the natural and made Divine, it is not
marriage that takes place, but a covenant resembling a marriage
covenant. The Divine marriage itself which is in the Lord is the union
of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence, and of the Human Essence
with the Divine Essence (see n. 2803). This is the reason why Rebekah is
called "woman," not wife.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3212.">3212.</span></span>

And Isaac was comforted after his mother. That this signifies a new
state, is evident from the signification of "receiving comfort," as
being a new state; for a state of consolation is new; and that it
succeeded to the foregoing is signified by "after his mother." This new
state is the state of glorification of the rational; as before in
respect to good, so now in respect to truth. The rational was glorified
when it was made Divine in respect to both. \[2\] That the Lord as to
the human was made new, that is, glorified (or what is the same, was
made Divine), no one can possibly conceive (thus neither believe) who is
in worldly and corporeal loves; for he is altogether ignorant what the
spiritual and celestial is, nor indeed is he willing to know. But he who
is not in worldly and corporeal loves, is capable of perceiving this,
for he believes that the Lord is one with the Father, and that from Him
proceeds all that is holy; consequently that He is Divine even as to the
Human; and whoever believes, perceives in his own way. \[3\] The state
of the Lord's glorification may in some manner be conceived from the
state of the regeneration of man, for the regeneration of man is an
image of the glorification of the Lord (n. 3043, 3138). When man is
being regenerated, he is then becoming altogether another, and is being
made new; therefore also when he has been regenerated, he is called
"born again," and "created anew." Then, although he has a similar face
and a similar speech, yet his mind is not similar; his mind, when he is
regenerate, is open toward heaven, and there dwells therein love to the
Lord and charity toward his neighbor, together with faith. It is the
mind that makes a man another, and a new man. This change of state
cannot be perceived in the body of man, but in his spirit, the body
being merely the covering of his spirit; and when it is put off, then
his spirit appears, and this (provided he has been regenerated) in
altogether another form, for it then has the form of love and charity in
beauty inexpressible (n. 553), instead of its pristine form, which was
that of hatred and cruelty with a deformity also inexpressible. This
shows what a regenerate person is, or one who is born again, or created
anew; namely, that he is altogether another, and is a new man. \[4\]
From this image it may in some measure be conceived what the
glorification of the Lord is. He was not regenerated as a man is; but
became Divine, and this from the very Divine Love itself, for He was
made the Divine Love itself. What his form then was, was made apparent
to Peter, James, and John when it was given them to see Him, not with
the eyes of the body but with the eyes of the spirit, namely-that His
countenance shone like the sun (Matt. 17:2); and that this was His
Divine Human is evident from the voice which then came out of the cloud,
saying, "This is my beloved Son" (verse 5). That the "Son" is the Divine
Human, may be seen above (n. 2628).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3213.">3213.</span></span>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING REPRESENTATIONS AND CORRESPONDENCES. In the
world of spirits there come forth innumerable and almost continual
representatives, which are forms of actual things spiritual and
celestial, not unlike those which are in the world. Whence these come it
has been granted to me to know by daily interaction with spirits and
angels. They inflow from heaven, and from the ideas and speech of the
angels there; for the ideas of angels and their derivative speech, when
they come down to spirits, are exhibited representatively in various
ways. From these representations upright and well-disposed spirits are
enabled to know what the angels are saying among themselves, for
inwardly within the representatives there is something angelic, which,
in consequence of its power to excite affection, is perceived even as to
its quality. Angelic ideas and speech cannot be exhibited before spirits
in any other way; for as compared with the idea of a spirit an angelic
idea contains things illimitable; and unless it were formed and
exhibited representatively, and thus visibly by images, a spirit would
scarcely understand anything of its contents, which are for the most
part unutterable. But when the ideas are represented by forms, then
insofar as the more general things are concerned they become
comprehensible to spirits. And wonderful to say there is not even the
smallest thing in that which is represented which does not express
something spiritual and celestial that is in the idea of the angelic
society from which the representative flows down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3214.">3214.</span></span>

Representatives of things spiritual and celestial sometimes come forth
in a long series, continued for an hour or two, in such an order
successively as is marvelous. There are societies in which these
representatives take place; and it has been given me to be with them for
many months. But these representations are of such a nature that it
would take many pages to relate and describe a single one of them in its
order. They are very delightful, for something new and unexpected
continually follows in succession, and this until what is represented is
being fully perfected; and when all things have been perfectly
represented, it is possible to contemplate everything in one view; and
then it is at the same time given to take note of what is signified by
each detail. Moreover good spirits are in this way initiated into
spiritual and celestial ideas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3215.">3215.</span></span>

The representatives that come forth before spirits are of an incredible
variety; yet they are for the most part similar to things which exist on
the earth, in its three kingdoms. (For the better understanding of their
nature, see what has been related above concerning them, n. 1521, 1532,
1619-1625, 1807, 1808, 1971, 1974, 1977, 1980, 1981, 2299, 2601, 2758.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="3216.">3216.</span></span>

In order that it may be still better known how the case is with
representatives in the other life, that is, with those things which
appear in the world of spirits, take some further examples. When the
angels are speaking about the doctrinal things of charity and faith,
then sometimes in a lower sphere, where there is a corresponding society
of spirits, there appears the form or pattern of a city or cities, with
palaces therein exhibiting such skill in architecture as is amazing, so
that you would say that the very art itself was there in its native
home; not to mention houses of varied aspect; and wonderful to say in
all these objects both in general and in particular there is not the
smallest point, or visible atom, that does not represent something of
the angelic idea and speech: so that it is evident what innumerable
things are contained in these; and also what is signified by the cities
seen by the prophets in the Word; and likewise what by the holy city or
New Jerusalem; and what by the cities in the prophetic Word; namely, the
doctrinal things of charity and faith (n. 402, 2449).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3217.">3217.</span></span>

When the angels are discoursing of that which relates to the
understanding, then in the world of spirits, beneath the angels, or in
the corresponding societies, there appear horses; and these of a size,
form, color, attitude, and varied equipment, in accordance with the
ideas which the angels have concerning the understanding. There is also
a place at some depth a little to the right, which is called the abode
of the intelligent, where horses continually appear, and this by reason
of those present being in thought about what is of the understanding;
and when angels whose discourse is about this subject flow into their
thoughts, there is a representation of horses. This shows what was
signified by the horses seen by the prophets, and also by the horses
mentioned elsewhere in the Word; namely, the things of the understanding
(n. 2760-2762).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3218.">3218.</span></span>

When the angels are in affections, and are at the same time discoursing
about them, then in the lower sphere among spirits such things fall into
representative species of animals. When the discourse is about good
affections, there are presented beautiful, tame, and useful animals,
such as were used in sacrifice in the representative Divine worship in
the Jewish Church-as lambs, sheep, kids, she-goats, rams, he-goats,
calves, bullocks, oxen; and then whatever appears upon the animal
presents some image of their thought, which it is given to upright and
well-disposed spirits to perceive. This shows what was signified by the
animals that were employed in the rites of the Jewish Church; and what
by the same when mentioned in the Word; namely, affections (n. 1823,
2179, 2180). But the discourse of the angels about evil affections is
represented by beasts that are repulsive, fierce, and useless, such as
tigers, bears, wolves, scorpions, serpents, mice, and the like; and
these affections are also signified by the same beasts in the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3219.">3219.</span></span>

When the angels are conversing about knowledges, and ideas, and influx,
there then appear in the world of spirits as it were birds, formed in
accordance with the subject of their discourse. Hence it is that in the
Word "birds" signify rational things, or those which are of thought (see
n. 40, 745, 776, 991). There were once presented to my view birds, one
dark and unsightly, but two noble and beautiful; and when I saw them,
there then fell upon me some spirits with such violence as to strike a
tremor into my nerves and bones. I imagined that then, as several times
before, evil spirits were assaulting me, with intent to destroy me; but
this was not the case; for when the tremor ceased, together with the
emotion of the spirits who fell upon me, I spoke with them, asking what
was the matter. \[2\] They said that they had fallen down from a certain
angelic society in which there was discourse concerning thoughts and
influx; and that they had held the opinion that things relating to
thought flow in from without, that is, through the external senses,
according to the appearance; whereas the heavenly society in which they
were, held the opinion that they inflow from within; and as they (the
speakers) were in falsity, they fell down-not that they were cast down,
for the angels cast no one down from them, but being in falsity they
fell down of themselves; and they said that this was the cause. \[3\] By
this it was given to know that discourse in heaven concerning thoughts
and influx is represented by birds; and that of those who are in falsity
by dark and unsightly birds; but that of those who are in the truth, by
birds noble and beautiful. I was at the same time instructed that all
things of thought inflow from within, and not from without, although it
appears so; and I was told that it is contrary to order for the
posterior to flow into the prior, or the grosser into the purer; thus
for the body to inflow into the soul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3220.">3220.</span></span>

When the angels are discoursing about things of intelligence and wisdom,
and about perceptions and knowledges, the influx from them into the
corresponding societies of spirits falls into representations of such
things as are in the vegetable kingdom; as into representations of
paradises, of vine-yards, of forests, of meadows with flowers, and into
many lovely forms that surpass all human imagination. Hence it is that
things which are of wisdom and intelligence are described in the Word by
paradises, vineyards, forests, meadows; and that where these are
mentioned, such things are signified.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3221.">3221.</span></span>

The discourses of the angels are sometimes represented by clouds, and by
their forms, colors, movements, and changes; things affirmative of truth
by bright and ascending clouds; things negative by dark and descending
clouds; things affirmative of falsity by dusky and black clouds; consent
and dissent by the various gatherings together and partings asunder of
the clouds, and these latter as in a sky like that of the heavens in the
night.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3222.">3222.</span></span>

Moreover loves and their affections are represented by flames, and this
with inexpressible variation; whereas truths are represented by lights,
and by innumerable modifications of light. This shows whence it is that
by "flames" in the Word are signified the goods which are of love; and
by "lights" the truths which are of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3223.">3223.</span></span>

There are two lights whereby man is enlightened-the light of the world,
and the light of heaven. The light of the world is from the sun; the
light of heaven is from the Lord. The light of the world is for the
natural or external man, thus for those things which are in him, and
although the things which are therein do not appear to be of this light,
they nevertheless are so; for nothing can be comprehended by the natural
man except by such things as come forth and appear in the solar world,
thus except they have somewhat of form from the light and shade therein.
All ideas of time and ideas of space, which are of so much account in
the natural man that he cannot think without them, are also of the light
of the world. But the light of heaven is for the spiritual or internal
man. Man's interior mind, in which are his intellectual ideas that are
called immaterial, is in this light. Man is unaware of this, although he
calls his intellect sight, and ascribes light to it; the reason is that
so long as he is in worldly and corporeal things he has a perception
only of such things as are of the light of the world, but not of such
things as are of the light of heaven; the light of heaven is from the
Lord alone, and the universal heaven is in this light. \[2\] This light
(namely, that of heaven) is immensely more perfect than the light of the
world; the things which in the light of the world make one ray, in the
light of heaven make myriads; within the light of heaven there are
intelligence and wisdom. This light is that which flows into the light
of the world which is in the external or natural man, and causes him to
perceive sensuously the objects of actual things; and unless this light
flowed in, man could not have any perception, for the things which are
of the light of the world derive from it their life. Between these
lights, or between the things which are in the light of heaven and those
in the light of the world, there exists a correspondence when the
external or natural man makes one with the internal or spiritual man,
that is, when the former is subservient to the latter; and the things
which then come forth in the light of the world are representative of
such things as come forth in the light of heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3224.">3224.</span></span>

It is surprising that man does not as yet know that his intellectual
mind is in a certain light that is altogether different from the light
of the world; but such is the condition that to those who are in the
light of the world the light of heaven is as it were darkness, and to
those who are in the light of heaven the light of the world is as it
were darkness. This arises principally from the loves, which are the
heats of the light. They who are in the loves of self and of the world,
thus only in the heat of the light of the world, are affected solely by
evils and falsities, and these are the things which extinguish truths,
which are of the light of heaven. But they who are in love to the Lord
and in love toward the neighbor, thus in spiritual heat, which is of the
light of heaven, are affected with goods and truths, which extinguish
falsities; but still with these persons there exists a correspondence.
\[2\] Spirits who are only in the things which are of the light of the
world, and are thence in falsities derived from evils, have indeed light
from heaven in the other life, but such a light as is fatuous, or as
that which issues from a lighted coal or firebrand; but on the approach
of the light of heaven this light is at once extinguished, and becomes
thick darkness. They who are in this light are in phantasies, and the
things which they see in phantasies they believe to be truths, nor to
them is anything else truth. Their phantasies are also closely bound to
filthy and obscene objects, with which they are most especially
delighted; thus they think like persons who are insane and delirious. In
regard to falsities, they do not reason whether these be so or not, but
they instantly affirm them; whereas in regard to goods and truths they
carry on a continual ratiocination, which terminates in what is
negative. \[3\] For truths and goods, which are from the light of
heaven, flow into the interior mind, which with them is closed;
wherefore the light flows in around and outside of this mind, and
becomes such that it is modified solely by the falsities which appear to
them as truths. Truths and goods cannot be acknowledged, except with
those whose interior mind is open, into which the light from the Lord
may inflow; and so far as this mind is open, truths and goods are
acknowledged. This mind is open only with those who are in innocence, in
love to the Lord, and in charity toward their neighbor; but not with
those who are in the truths of faith, unless they are at the same time
in the good of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3225.">3225.</span></span>

From all this then it is evident what correspondence is and whence it
is, also what representation is and whence; namely, that there is
correspondence between those things which are of the light of heaven and
those which are of the light of the world, that is, between those things
which are of the internal or spiritual man and those which are of the
external or natural man; and that there is representation in regard to
whatever comes forth in the things which are of the light of the world
(that is, in regard to whatever comes forth in the external or natural
man), relatively to those which are of the light of heaven, that is,
which are from the internal or spiritual man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3226.">3226.</span></span>

Among the eminent faculties which man possesses, although he is ignorant
of it, and which he carries with him into the other life when he passes
thither after his liberation from the body, is that he perceives what is
signified by the representatives which appear in the other life; also
that he is able by the sense of his mind to express fully in a moment of
time what he could not express during hours in the body; and this by
ideas from those things which are of the light of heaven, assisted and
given as it were wings by suitable appearances representative of the
subject of discourse, which are such as cannot be described; and whereas
man after death comes into these faculties, and in the other life has no
need to be instructed respecting them, it is evident that he is in them
(that is, that they are in him) during his life in the body, although he
does not know it. \[2\] The reason of this is that there is a continual
influx with man through heaven from the Lord. This influx is an influx
of spiritual and celestial things, which fall into his natural things
and are there presented representatively. In heaven among the angels
nothing else is thought of than the celestial and spiritual things of
the Lord's kingdom; but in the world, with man, scarcely anything else
is thought of than the corporeal and natural things which belong to the
kingdom in which he is, and to the necessaries of life. And since the
spiritual and celestial things of heaven which flow in are presented
representatively with man in his natural things, they therefore remain
implanted, and when a man puts off the body and leaves the world behind,
he is in them.

The subject of Representations and Correspondences is continued at the
end of the next chapter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3228.">3228.</span></span>

CHAPTER 25 This chapter treats of the sons of Abraham by Keturah, and
also of the sons of Ishmael, whose names are given; afterwards it treats
of Isaac and Rebekah, in that Esau and Jacob were born to them, and
finally that Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a pottage of lentils.
Everyone can see that these subjects are of such a nature as may indeed
be of use for the church history of that time, but are of little value
in regard to spiritual life, for the sake of which however the Word is
given. What does it benefit a man to know who were the sons of Abraham
by Keturah, and who were the sons of Ishmael? and that Esau, weary with
hunting, craved the pottage of lentils, and that Jacob by means of it
shrewdly procured the birthright for himself? And so in the following
chapter, where it is said that the herdsmen of Abimelech quarreled with
the herdsmen of Isaac concerning the wells they had dug, in about the
same way as they had previously contended with the herdsmen of Abraham
(chapter 21). Moreover in some places there are mere lists of names, as
that of the posterity of Esau (chapter 26); and the same in other
chapters. Insofar as these are historical matters there is so little of
the Divine in them that you can in no wise say that that Word was
Divinely inspired in regard to every expression, and even to every jot,
that is, that it had been sent down from the Lord through heaven to the
man who wrote it; for what has been sent down from the Lord is Divine in
all things both in general and in particular. Thus there is nothing
Divine in regard to historical things (since these are transactions of
men) except from things contained deeply hidden in the historicals, all
of which both in general and in particular treat of the Lord and His
kingdom. The historicals of the Word are unlike all other historicals in
the universe, in that they contain such things within them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3229.">3229.</span></span>

If the Word were the Word in regard solely to its historicals, that is,
in regard to its external or literal sense, then all the historicals in
it would be holy; and, what is more, many persons there mentioned would
be regarded as holy, and the result would be (as has actually happened
with many of them) that they would be worshiped as gods because they are
treated of in the holiest of writings; for example, those who are called
the patriarchs, namely, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and after them the
fathers of the tribes, the twelve sons of Jacob, and later David and
many others; and yet all these were men, and some of them had but little
regard for Divine worship; and I am able to testify that they enjoy
nothing beyond the common lot of humanity, and also that in the heavens
they are quite unknown. But of the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said
elsewhere concerning them and their state in the other life. From all
this it is clearly evident that the external or literal sense is the
Word solely from the internal or spiritual sense within it, and from
which it is. GENESIS 25 1. And Abraham added, and took a woman, and her
name was Keturah. 2. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan,
and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. 3. And Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan.
And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. 4. And
the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah.
All these were the sons of Keturah. 5. And Abraham gave all that he had
unto Isaac. 6. And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had,
Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he
was yet living, eastward to the land of the east. 7. And these are the
days of the years of the lives of Abraham which he lived; a hundred
years, and seventy years, and five years. 8. And Abraham expired and
died in a good old age, an old man and sated, and was gathered to his
peoples. 9. And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of
Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is
before Mamre; 10. The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth:
there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. 11. And it came to pass
after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac
dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi. 12. And these are the births of Ishmael the son
of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto
Abraham. 13. And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, in their
names, according to their births: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth;
and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam; 14. And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa;
15. Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: 16. These are the sons
of Ishmael, and these are their names, in their villages and in their
castles; twelve princes of their peoples. 17. And these are the years of
the life of Ishmael, a hundred years, and thirty years, and seven years;
and he expired and died, and was gathered unto his peoples. 18. And they
dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward
Assyria: he fell upon the faces of all his brethren. 19. And these are
the births of Isaac, the son of Abraham: Abraham begat Isaac. 20. And
Isaac was a son of forty years when he took Rebekah, the daughter of
Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to
himself for a woman. 21. And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his woman,
because she was barren, and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah
his woman conceived. 22. And the sons struggled together within her; and
she said, If so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of Jehovah. 23.
And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples
shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one people shall prevail
over the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger. 24. And
her days were fulfilled to bring forth, and behold twins were in her
womb. 25. And the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment,
and they called his name Esau. 26. And after that came forth his
brother, and his hand laid hold on Esau's heel, and he called his name
Jacob: and Isaac was a son of sixty years when she bare them. 27. And
the boys grew up: and Esau was a man skillful in hunting, a man of the
field; and Jacob was a perfect man, dwelling in tents. 28. And Isaac
loved Esau, because his hunting was in his mouth; and Rebekah loved
Jacob. 29. And Jacob boiled pottage, and Esau came from the field, and
he was weary. 30. And Esau said to Jacob, Cause me to sup I pray of the
red, this red, for I am weary; therefore he called his name Edom. 31.
And Jacob said, Sell me as this day thy birthright. 32. And Esau said,
Behold I am going to die, and for what is this birthright to me? 33. And
Jacob said, Swear to me as this day; and he sware unto him, and he sold
his birthright unto Jacob. 34. And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of
lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up and went away; and Esau
despised the birthright.

THE CONTENTS. In the internal sense this chapter treats, First, of the
Lord's spiritual kingdom, and its derivations (verses 1-4). That it was
separated from the Lord's celestial kingdom (verses 5-6). That the
representative of the Lord by Abraham was ended (verses 7-8). And that
the representative of the Lord by Isaac and Ishmael began (verses 9-11).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3231.">3231.</span></span>

Secondly, the spiritual church, which is represented by Ishmael,
together with its derivations, is treated of (verses 12-18).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3232.">3232.</span></span>

Thirdly, the conception and birth of the Divine natural are treated of;
as to good, which is meant by Esau; and as to truth, which is meant by
Jacob (verses 19-25).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3233.">3233.</span></span>

Fourthly, the priority of good and of truth in the church is treated of
(verses 26-34).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3234.">3234.</span></span>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verse 1. And Abraham added, and took a woman, and
her name was Keturah. "And Abraham added, and took a woman," signifies
another state of the Lord, whom Abraham represents; Abraham and Sarah
represented the Lord as to the Divine celestial; Abraham and Keturah
represented the Lord as to the Divine spiritual; thus Abraham here
represents the Lord as to Divine good spiritual, and his woman as to
Divine truth adjoined to this good; "and her name was Keturah,"
signifies the essence of this Divine truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3235.">3235.</span></span>

And Abraham added, and took a woman. That this signifies another state
of the Lord, whom Abraham represents, and that Abraham and Sarah
represented the Lord as to the Divine celestial, and Abraham and Keturah
as to the Divine spiritual, is evident from the things hitherto said and
shown concerning Abraham and Sarah his wife, and from those here related
concerning Abraham and Keturah. But as it is said that Abraham here
represents another state of the Lord, and that Abraham and Sarah
represented the Lord as to the Divine celestial, but Abraham and Keturah
the Lord as to the Divine spiritual, it should be known what the Divine
celestial is, and what the Divine spiritual. \[2\] The Divine celestial
and the Divine spiritual are such in respect to those who receive the
Divine of the Lord, for the Lord appears to everyone according to the
nature of him who receives, as may be seen from what has been said above
(n. 1838, 1861), and is clearly manifest from the fact that the Lord
appears in one way to the celestial, but in another to the spiritual;
for to the celestial He appears as a sun, but to the spiritual as a moon
(n. 1529-1531, 1838). The Lord appears to the celestial as a sun,
because they are in celestial love, that is, in love to the Lord; but to
the spiritual as a moon, because they are in spiritual love, that is, in
charity toward the neighbor. The difference is like that between the
light of the sun in the daytime and the light of the moon by night; it
is also like the difference between the heat of the one and the heat of
the other, from which springs vegetation. This is what is meant in the
first chapter of Genesis by the words: And God made two great lights,
the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the
night (Gen. 1:16). \[3\] Speaking generally, the Lord's kingdom is both
celestial and spiritual; that is, it consists of those who are
celestial, and of those who are spiritual. And it is because the Divine
of the Lord appears to the celestial as celestial, and to the spiritual
as spiritual, that it is here said that Abraham and Sarah represented
the Lord as to the Divine celestial, and that Abraham and Keturah
represented Him as to the Divine spiritual. But as scarcely any know
what the celestial is and what the spiritual, or who the celestial and
the spiritual are, see what has already been said and shown concerning
them, namely: What the celestial is, and what the spiritual (n. 1155,
1577, 1824, 2048, 2184, 2227, 2507): Who are celestial and who are
spiritual (n. 2088, 2669, 2708, 2715): That the celestial man is a
likeness of the Lord and does good from love, and the spiritual man is
an image of the Lord and does good from faith (n. 50-52, 1013): That the
celestial perceive truth from good, and that they never reason
concerning truth (n. 202, 337, 607, 895, 1121, 2715): That in the
celestial man good is implanted in his will part, but in the spiritual
man it is implanted in his intellectual part, and that in this part a
new will is created in those who are spiritual (n. 863, 875, 895, 897,
927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256): That the celestial from good itself see
indefinite things, but that the spiritual, because they reason whether a
thing is so, cannot attain to the first boundary of the light of the
celestial (n. 2718): That the spiritual are in relative obscurity (n.
1043, 2708, 2715): That the Lord came into the world in order to save
the spiritual (n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3236.">3236.</span></span>

That Abraham here represents the Lord as to Divine good spiritual, and
his woman as to Divine truth adjoined to this good, is evident from what
has been said before concerning husbands and wives, namely, that the
husband represents good and the wife truth (as Abraham and Sarah
heretofore, n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2172, 2173, 2198, 2904; and as
Isaac and Rebekah in the preceding chapter, n. 3077). The reason why the
husband represents good, and the wife truth, is that the church is
compared to a marriage, and also is the marriage of good and truth. Good
is what the husband represents, because it is in the first place; but
truth is what the wife represents, because it is in the second place;
therefore also in the Word the Lord is called a "bridegroom," a "man"
\[vir\], a "husband"; and the church is called a "bride," a "woman," a
"wife." \[2\] What spiritual good is, and what the spiritual truth
adjoined to this good, may be seen from the passages cited immediately
above (n. 3235). Spiritual good in man is in general what is called the
good of faith, and this is no other than charity toward the neighbor;
but in order that it may be charity, it must come from the new will with
which the spiritual man is gifted by the Lord. The spiritual truth
adjoined to this good is what is called the truth of faith, and this is
no other than that which regards charity first as the end for the sake
of which it exists; and afterwards as the beginning from which it
proceeds; but in order that it may be the truth of faith to the
spiritual man, or faith, it must come from the new understanding with
which he is gifted by the Lord; and the new understanding must have its
light from the new will.

And her name was Keturah. That this signifies the essence of this Divine
truth, is evident from the signification of "name," as being quality;
and of "calling by name," as being to know of what quality one is (see
n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009). But seeing that not quality, but being
is predicated of the Divine, by "name" here is signified essence, and
indeed the essence of the Divine truth which is signified here by "her,"
namely the woman. (That here the "woman" is Divine truth, may be seen
immediately above, n. 3236.) From this it is evident what Keturah in
general involves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3238.">3238.</span></span>

Verses 2-4. And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,
and Ishbak, and Shuah. And Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan. And the sons
of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. And the sons of
Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these
were the sons of Keturah. "And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and
Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah," represents the general
classes of the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the heavens and on earth;
"and Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan," signifies the derivations from the
first class; "and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and
Leummim," signifies the derivations from the second class; "and the sons
of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah,"
signifies the derivations from the third class; "all these were the sons
of Keturah," signifies as regards the doctrinal things and worships
thence derived.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3239.">3239.</span></span>

And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak,
and Shuah. That these represent the general classes of the Lord's
spiritual kingdom in the heavens and on earth, cannot so well be
established from the Word, because none of these men are elsewhere
mentioned, with the exception of Midian, of whom something will be said
hereafter. Yet this may be seen from the fact that all persons named in
the Word represent something; as is sufficiently evident from all those
mentioned hitherto, from the first chapter of Genesis. (That in the
internal sense of the Word names, both of persons and of kingdoms,
provinces, and cities, signify actual things, may be seen above, n. 768,
1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, and in many other places where this is in
particular confirmed from the Word.) The reason why none of these except
Midian are mentioned elsewhere in the Word, is that they are of the sons
of the east, who are sometimes mentioned in the Word. (That in general
the "sons of the east" signify those who are of the Lord's spiritual
kingdom, may be seen below, at verse 6 of this chapter.) \[2\] That
these sons of Abraham by Keturah have this representation, is evident
from the fact that Abraham and Keturah represent the Lord as to the
Divine spiritual, namely, Abraham the Lord as to Divine good spiritual,
and Keturah as to Divine truth spiritual conjoined with this good
(concerning which see just above, n. 3235, 3236). From this it follows
that their sons represent the general classes or lots of the kingdom
which is from the Lord's Divine spiritual. They are called general
classes or lots because the Lord's kingdom is represented by land, which
is distributed by lots among those to whom it is given to be possessed
as an inheritance, just as the land of Canaan was allotted to the sons
of Israel. There are in general twelve classes, for by "twelve" are
signified all the things of charity and of the derivative faith, which
are of the Lord's kingdom (concerning which see below, at verse 16); but
here there are six, thus one-half the number; but the half of a number
involves the same as the whole, for provided a like thing is involved,
multiplication and division do not vary the thing itself as to what is
essential.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3240.">3240.</span></span>

And Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan. That this signifies the derivations
from the first class, is evident from the representation of Jokshan and
of his sons Sheba and Dedan, concerning whom something will be said in
what follows. As here there are mere names, and the states and
derivations of the Lord's spiritual church are signified by them, the
nature of such states and derivations in general must be declared. The
celestial church differs from the spiritual church in this respect:
Those who are of the celestial church, and are called celestial, are in
love, that is to say they are in the good and truth of love; while those
who are of the spiritual church, and are called spiritual, are in faith,
that is, they are in the good and truth of faith. The good which the
celestial have is that of love to the Lord, and their truth is that of
love to the neighbor; whereas the good which the spiritual have is that
of charity toward the neighbor, and their truth is that of faith,
insofar as this truth is doctrine concerning charity. This shows that
the Lord's spiritual kingdom, as well as His celestial kingdom, has good
and truth, but with much difference. \[2\] Be it known moreover that
they who are in each kingdom are distinguished among themselves by good
and truth, for the reason that there are some who are more in good and
others who are more in truth. From this then come the derivations, that
is, the derivations of good and the derivations of truth. In the Lord's
spiritual kingdom the derivations of good are what are represented by
the sons of Jokshan who are named in this verse; but the derivations of
truth in this kingdom are what are represented by the sons of Midian who
are named in the following verse. Now as there are two classes of the
spiritual (those who are more in good, and those who are more in truth),
they have therefore two kinds of doctrinals, namely, those of charity
and those of faith; doctrinals of charity for those who are in the good
of faith and are here signified by the sons of Jokshan; but doctrinals
of faith for those who are in the truth of faith and are signified by
the sons of Midian. \[3\] Sheba and Dedan are those who constitute the
first class, that is, those who in the Lord's spiritual kingdom are in
the good of faith, and who have doctrinals of charity. From this it
follows that by "Sheba and Dedan" are signified the knowledges of
celestial things, or what is the same, those who are in these
knowledges, that is, who are in the doctrinals of charity; for
doctrinals are knowledges, and the celestial of the spiritual man is
that of charity. That "Sheba" and "Dedan" have this signification was
shown in volume 1 (n. 117, 1168, 1171, 1172); but there Sheba and Dedan
are the great-grandsons of Ham, and are called sons of Raamah; but be it
known that there were no such persons as Ham and Japheth and Shem, but
that those who after the flood belonged to the church called "Noah" were
distinguished as to goods and truths into three classes, and these were
the names given to those classes (n. 736, 1062, 1065, 1140, 1141, 1162,
and in other places). Nevertheless there were nations that were so
called, but these nations were descended from others, as it is here
plainly said that Sheba and Dedan were descended from Jokshan, the son
of Abraham by Keturah. \[4\] That "Sheba" signifies those who are in the
knowledges of celestial things, thus who are in the good of faith, is
evident from the passages cited above (n 117, 1171); and that "Dedan"
has a similar signification is also evident from the passages cited (n.
1172), and further from the following. In Isaiah: The prophecy
concerning Arabia: in the forest in Arabia shall ye spend the night, ye
companies of Dedan; bring ye waters to meet him that is thirsty, ye
inhabitants of the land of Tema, with the bread thereof meet him that
wandereth, for they shall wander before swords, before an outstretched
sword (Isa. 21:13-15). "Spending the night in the forest," signifies
being desolated as to good; for by "Arabia" are meant those who are in
celestial things, that is, who are in the good of faith, and "spending
the night there in the forest" is being no longer in goods, from which
comes desolation, which is also described by "wandering before swords,
before an outstretched sword." Celestial things, that is, the goods of
faith, or what is the same, the works of charity in which they are, are
signified by "bringing waters to meet him that is thirsty, and meeting
with bread him that wandereth." \[5\] In Jeremiah: I took the cup from
the hand of Jehovah, and made all the nations drink unto whom Jehovah
sent me: Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and her kings and her
princes, to give them up to desolation; Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and his
servants, and his princes, and all his people; and all the kings of
Tyre, and all the kings of Zidon; Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that
are clipped at the corner \[of the beard\]; all the kings of Zimri, and
all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media, and all the kings of
the north (Jer. 25:17-19, 22-23, 25-26). Here also the desolation of the
spiritual church is treated of, the different classes of which church
are enumerated in order, and are signified by "Jerusalem," the "cities
of Judah," "Egypt," "Tyre," "Zidon," "Dedan," "Tema," "Buz," "Zimri,"
"Elam," "Media." \[6\] In Ezekiel: Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of
Tarshish and all the young lions thereof shall say to thee, Art thou
come to take the spoil? Hast thou assembled thine assembly to take the
prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to
take great spoil? (Ezek. 38:13); treating of Gog, by whom is signified
external worship separate from internal, which is idolatrous (n. 1151);
"Sheba and Dedan" denote the internal things of worship, namely, the
goods of faith; "Tarshish" denotes a corresponding external worship; the
"silver, gold, cattle, goods, spoil," which Gog, or the external of
worship separate from the internal, desires to take away, are the
knowledges of good and truth for which they fight, and which those
defend who are signified by "Sheba and Dedan;" wherefore these are
called "young lions." "Sheba" properly denotes those who are in the
knowledges of good; "Dedan" those who are in the knowledges of truth
from good.

And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. That
this signifies the derivations from the second class, is evident from
the representation of Dedan, as being those who are in the good of
faith, properly those who are in the truth of faith from good (n. 3240,
at the end). That the derivations are from a second class is manifest.
By these three sons of Dedan are especially signified the truths of
faith from good; but what is signified by each can indeed be told, but
cannot be confirmed by other passages from the Word, because the names
are not mentioned elsewhere. \[2\] In the kingdom of the Lord there are
innumerable varieties as to goods and truths, and yet of these
innumerable varieties one heaven is constituted; for the varieties are
so many that no one society is exactly like another, that is, is never
in the same good and truth (n. 684, 685, 690). The one heaven therein is
constituted of the many varieties so disposed by the Lord that they
agree, the agreement or harmony of the many being imparted by the Lord,
by means of all referring themselves to Him (n. 551). The case herein is
the same as with the organs, members, and viscera of the body, not one
of which is exactly like another. They are all different and yet make a
one, and this by reason of their all referring themselves to one soul,
and through this to heaven, and thus to the Lord; for whatever is
unconnected with the Lord is nothing. From this it is evident that the
differences of truth and of good are innumerable in species; but their
genera, and these the most general, which are spiritual churches, are
signified by these sons and grandsons of Abraham. \[3\] As they who are
of the spiritual church have no perception of what is good and true,
like those of the celestial church, but acknowledge as truths the things
they have learned, they are on this account continually in dispute
concerning them, reasoning whether a thing is true; and each person
abides in that doctrine (and calls it true) which is of his own church.
This is the source of so many differences. Moreover very many form their
conclusions concerning things good and true from appearances and
fallacies-one in one way, another in another, but none from any
perception; they do not even know what perception is; and as their
understanding is thus in obscurity as to the goods and truths of faith,
it is not surprising that dissensions should arise concerning the most
essential of all the things of faith, namely, concerning the Divine, the
Human, and the Holy Proceeding of the Lord. The celestial perceive that
these are not three, but One; but the spiritual abide in the idea of
three, although they desire to think that they are One. Seeing then that
there are dissensions concerning that which is the most essential, it is
evident that the varieties and differences of doctrinal things must be
innumerable. From this all may know whence come the derivations
signified by those who are here named. But granting the existence of so
many varieties and differences of doctrinal things (that is, of so many
derivations), they nevertheless together form one church when all
acknowledge charity as essential to the church; or what is the same,
when they regard life as the end of doctrine; that is, when they inquire
how the man of the church lives, and not so much what his sentiments
are; for in the other life everyone receives from the Lord a lot in
accordance with his good of life, and not in accordance with his truth
of doctrine separated from the good of life.

And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and
Eldaah. That this signifies the derivations from the third class, can be
seen from the representation of Midian, as being those who are in the
truth of faith (concerning which below); and as those who are in the
truth of faith are "Midian," it follows that his "sons" are the
derivations therefrom. With those who are in the truth of faith the case
is this: No one is admitted into the Lord's kingdom unless he is in the
good of faith, for the good of faith is of the life, and the life of
faith remains, but not the doctrine of faith, except insofar as it makes
one with the life; nevertheless they who are in the truth of faith (that
is, who profess faith and call it essential, because they have so
learned) and yet are in the good of life (that is, who are Christians in
heart and not in profession only), are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom.
For anyone may easily be persuaded that faith is the essential when he
has been so taught by his instructors and has imbibed this opinion in
his childhood, and because they who are reputed most learned and the
heads of the church say so, some of whom are afraid to speak of the good
of life because their life condemns them; moreover the things that
belong to faith flow in perceptibly, but not so those which belong to
charity. \[2\] They therefore who are in the truth of faith and yet in
the good of life, are they who are called Midian;" and the truths
according to which they live are the "sons of Midian;" and as those who
are in the truth of faith conjoined with its good are "Midian," so also
in the opposite sense are those who are in falsity from not having the
good of life, as can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: The
abundance of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and
Ephah, all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and
frankincense, and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah (Isa.
60:6); where the Lord's spiritual kingdom is treated of. The
"dromedaries of Midian and Ephah" denote doctrinal things; doctrinal
things of good are "gold;" those of truth are "frankincense;" both are
the "praises of Jehovah;" hence also it is manifest what "Ephah"
signifies. (That by the "Midianites" who drew Joseph out of the pit, and
sold him to the Ishmaelites, and into Egypt to Potiphar, Genesis 37:28,
36, are signified those who are in the truth of simple good, will be
seen, of the Lord's Divine mercy, in the explication of these verses
hereafter.) \[3\] That by "Midian" are also signified those who are in
falsity because they have not the goods of life, can be seen from what
is said concerning Midian in Moses: The elders of Moab and the elders of
Midian, with the rewards of divination in their hand, went to Balaam,
and spake to him the words of Balak (Num. 22:4, 7, etc.). In a good
sense "Moab" denotes those who are in natural good and suffer themselves
to be easily led astray; but in the opposite sense, those who adulterate
goods (n. 2468). In a good sense "Midian" denotes those who are in the
truth of simple good, as before said, and who thus allow themselves to
be easily persuaded; in the opposite sense, as here, those who falsify
truths. The falsifications are signified by "the rewards of divination
in their hand;" and the deeds from these falsities, by their sending to
Balaam in hostility to the sons of Israel, who denote the goods and
derivative truths of faith. \[4\] The like was signified by the
whoredoms of the sons of Israel with the women of the Midianites,
resulting in a plague, which was stayed by Phinehas thrusting his spear
through the Midianitish woman and the man of Israel in the brothel (Num.
25:6-8); for by whoredoms were represented the falsifications of truth
(n. 2466, 2729). And because falsifications of truth are what in the
internal sense are signified by whoredoms, therefore by command twelve
thousand of the sons of Israel smote the Midianites, slew their kings,
and every male, and the women whom they had led captive that had known a
man, and divided the spoil among themselves (Num. 25:16, 17; 31:1 to the
end). The reason why there were twelve thousand, was that "twelve"
signified all things of faith (n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130), by which
falsities are destroyed; the "kings" whom they killed are falsities, and
so is "every male;" the "women that had known a man" are the affections
of falsity; the "spoil" (as gold, silver, cattle) are the truths that
were falsified; from all which it is evident that each and all of the
things there mentioned are representative of the punishment and
destruction of what is false by means of truths. \[5\] It is similar in
regard to what is said of the Midianites in the book of Judges, namely,
that the sons of Israel, because they did evil in the eyes of Jehovah,
were given into the hand of Midian seven years; and that the sons of
Israel, by reason of Midian, made for themselves caves in the mountains,
and also dens, and fortified places; and when Israel had sown, that
Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east came up and ravaged the
produce of their land; and afterwards that they were delivered by Gideon
with three hundred men who lapped water with the tongue like a dog, and
that those were sent home who bowed upon the knees and drank, besides
other particulars (chapters 6, 7, 8). Here also the things mentioned
each and all are representative of the falsification of truth, and of
punishment on this account, even to their being destroyed by such things
as are signified by lapping water with the tongue like a dog; but what
each particular signifies in the internal sense it would be too tedious
to unfold here; yet of the Lord's Divine mercy it shall be told in, its
place. In Habakkuk: He beheld, and dispersed the nations; and the
eternal mountains <span id="fr_88"></span>[3242-1](#fn_88.md) were
scattered, the everlasting hills did bow. I saw the tents of Cushan
under Aven, the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble (Hab. 3:6-7);
where the advent of the Lord is treated of. The "tents of Cushan" denote
a religiosity from evil; the "curtains of the land of Midian," one from
falsity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3243.">3243.</span></span>

All these were the sons of Keturah. That this signifies as regards the
doctrinal things and worships thence derived, is evident from the
signification of "sons," as being truths and doctrinal things (n. 489,
491, 533, 1147, 2623); and from the representation of Keturah, as being
Divine truth spiritual conjoined with Divine good spiritual (n. 3236,
3237); thus those things which are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; and
because the worship of this kingdom is according to doctrinal things, it
follows that the "sons of Keturah" denote these things, and also the
derivative worships.

Verses 5, 6. And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. And to the
sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent
them away from Isaac his son, while he was yet living, eastward to the
land of the east. "And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac,"
signifies in the supreme sense all Divine things in the Divine rational;
in the relative sense the celestial things of love in the Lord's
celestial kingdom; "and to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had,
Abraham gave gifts," signifies those who are spiritual adopted by the
Lord's Divine Human, that they have allotted places in His spiritual
kingdom; "and he sent them away from Isaac his son," signifies the
distinction and separation of those who are spiritual from those who are
celestial; "while he was yet living," signifies to whom he could give
life; "eastward to the land of the east," signifies to the good of
faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3245.">3245.</span></span>

And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. That this signifies in the
supreme sense all Divine things in the Divine rational, and in the
relative sense the celestial things of love in the Lord's celestial
kingdom, is evident from the representation of Abraham, as being the
Lord as to the Divine Itself (concerning which see above); and from the
representation of Isaac, as being the Lord as to the Divine rational
(concerning which also see above); and because in the internal sense the
Lord is both "Abraham" and "Isaac," and the Lord made His rational
Divine from His own Divine; hence it is that the words "Abraham gave all
that he had unto Isaac" signify all Divine things in the Divine
rational. The things which precede and those which follow have regard to
this fact-that in the Lord's rational all things were made Divine. For
in the internal sense, where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are treated of,
the subject is the Lord's Human, and how it was made Divine. \[2\] There
are two things which properly constitute the Human, namely, the rational
and the natural; the Lord's rational was represented by Isaac, and His
natural by Jacob; the Lord made them both Divine; how He made the
rational Divine is contained in what was said of Isaac, but how He made
the natural Divine is contained in what is said of Jacob in what
follows. But this latter (that is, the natural) could not be made Divine
until the rational had been made Divine, for by means of the rational
the natural was made so; hence therefore it is that by the words before
us are signified all Divine things in the Divine rational. \[3\]
Moreover all and each of the things which in the internal sense treat of
the Lord, treat also of His kingdom and church, for the reason that the
Divine of the Lord makes His kingdom. Therefore where the Lord is
treated of, His kingdom is treated of also (n. 1965); but the internal
sense concerning the Lord is the supreme sense, while the internal sense
concerning His kingdom is the relative sense. The relative sense of
these words-that Abraham gave all to Isaac-is that the celestial things
of love are given to the Lord's celestial kingdom. For in the relative
sense by "Isaac" is signified the celestial kingdom, inasmuch as by the
rest of Abraham's sons (that is, those whom he had by Keturah) is
signified the Lord's spiritual kingdom, as shown above; and the same is
signified by Ishmael, concerning whom hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3246.">3246.</span></span>

And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts.
That this signifies the spiritual adopted by the Lord's Divine Human,
that they have allotted places in His spiritual kingdom, is evident from
the signification of the "sons of the concubines," as denoting those who
are spiritual (concerning whom in what follows); from the representation
here of Abraham, as being the Lord's Divine Human; so that by the words
"which Abraham had," is signified that they (namely, the spiritual) were
adopted by the Lord's Divine Human; and from the signification of the
"gifts" which Abraham gave them, as being allotted places in the Lord's
spiritual kingdom. \[2\] From what has already been shown in several
places (as n. 3235, and elsewhere) concerning those who constitute the
Lord's spiritual kingdom and are called the spiritual, it can be seen
that they are not sons born of the marriage itself of good and truth,
but of a certain covenant not so conjugial; they are indeed from the
same father, but not from the same mother; that is, they are from the
same Divine good, but not from the same Divine truth. For as the
celestial are from the very marriage of good and truth, they have good
and thence truth; wherefore they never inquire what is true, but
perceive it from good; and they discourse not about truth beyond
affirming that it is so-according to what the Lord teaches in Matthew:
Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, Nay; for whatsoever is more than
these cometh of evil (Matt. 5:37); whereas the spiritual, because they
are from a covenant not so conjugial, do not know from any perception
what truth is, but call that true which they have been told to be so by
parents and masters; and therefore in them there is not the marriage of
good and truth; but still the truth which they thus believe is adopted
by the Lord for truth when they are in the good of life (concerning this
see n. 1832). Therefore it is that those who are spiritual are here
called the "sons of the concubines," and by these are meant all the sons
of Keturah hitherto enumerated, and also the sons of Hagar, who will be
named immediately below, from the twelfth to the eighteenth verse. \[3\]
In former times, in order that both the celestial and the spiritual
might be represented in marriages, it was permissible for a man to have
a concubine in addition to a wife; such concubine being given to the
husband by the wife, and she was then called his "woman," or was said to
be "given to him for a woman," as when Hagar the Egyptian was given to
Abraham by Sarah (Gen. 16:3); when Bilhah the handmaid was given by
Rachel to Jacob (Gen. 30:4), and the handmaid Zilpah to Jacob by Leah
(Gen. 30:9). They are there called "women," but elsewhere they are
called "concubines," as Hagar the Egyptian in this verse, and Bilhah in
Genesis 35:22, also Keturah herself in 1 Chronicles 1:32. \[4\] That
those ancients had concubines besides a wife, as was the case not only
with Abraham and Jacob, but also with their descendants, as Gideon
(Judges 8:31), Saul (2 Sam. 3:7), David (2 Sam. 5:13; 15:16), and
Solomon (1 Kings 11:3), was of permission, for the sake of the
representation, namely, of the celestial church by a wife, and of the
spiritual church by a concubine: this was of permission because they
were such that they had no conjugial love, neither was marriage to them
marriage, but only a carnal coupling for the sake of procreating
offspring. To such there might be permissions without injury to
conjugial love, and consequently to its covenant; but never to those who
are in good and truth, and who are or can become internal men; for as
soon as man is in good and truth, and in things internal, such things
cease. For this reason it is not allowable for Christians, as it was for
the Jews, to take to themselves a concubine together with a wife, for
this is adultery. That the spiritual were adopted by the Lord's Divine
Human, may be seen from what has been stated and shown before on the
same subject (n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3247.">3247.</span></span>

And he sent them away from Isaac his son. That this signifies the
distinction and separation of those who are spiritual from those who are
celestial, is evident from what has just been said, namely, that the
sons of Abraham by Keturah and by Hagar the Egyptian, who are called the
"sons of the concubines," represent the spiritual; and that Isaac, in
the relative sense, represents the celestial (n. 3245); and that these
two classes were separated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3248.">3248.</span></span>

While he was yet living. That this signifies to whom he could give life,
is evident from the signification of "while he was yet living," or
"while he yet might live," as being to give life; for by Abraham is here
represented the Lord as to the Divine Human. That the spiritual have
life from the Lord's Divine Human may be seen above (n. 2661, 2716,
2833, 2834). When their life is from this source the Lord is said to
"live" with them, even in common speech. Hence it is that in the
internal sense by "while Abraham was yet living" is signified giving
life. Life is given to those who are spiritual by means of the good of
faith, which is meant by the words which now follow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3249.">3249.</span></span>

Eastward to the land of the east. That this signifies to the good of
faith, is evident from the signification of "the east" and the "land of
the east," which will be treated of in what follows. The good of faith
which is signified by the "land of the east," is no other than that
which in the Word is called charity toward the neighbor; and charity
toward the neighbor is nothing else than a life according to the Lord's
commandments. That this is signified by the "land of the east" may be
seen above (n. 1250); therefore they who were in the knowledges of the
good of faith were called "sons of the east." The land of the sons of
the east was Aram of Syria. (That Aram or Syria represents the
knowledges of good, may be seen above, n. 1232, 1234; and that Aram
Naharaim, or Syria of the rivers, represents the knowledges of truth, n.
3051.) And as by the "Syrians" or "sons of the east" were signified
those who were in the knowledges of good and truth, they were
preeminently called the "wise," as in the first book of Kings, where it
is said of Solomon: The wisdom of Solomon was multiplied above the
wisdom of all the sons of the east (1 Kings 4:30); and as in Matthew,
where it is said of those who came to Jesus when He was born: Wise men
from the east came to Jerusalem, saying, Where is He that is born king
of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east, and are come to
worship Him (Matt. 2:1-2). For in Syria were the last remains of the
Ancient Church, and therefore in that land there still remained the
knowledges of good and truth, as can also be seen from Balaam, who not
only adored Jehovah, but also prophesied concerning the Lord, and called
Him the "Star out of Jacob, and the Scepter out of Israel" (Num. 24:17).
That Balaam was of the sons of the east in Syria is manifest, for he
says this of himself when he utters the declaration: From Syria hath
Balak brought me, the king of Moab, from the mountains of the east (Num.
33:7). That it was Aram or Syria where the sons of the east dwelt, is
evident from the fact that when Jacob went into Syria he is said to have
gone "to the land of the sons of the east" (Gen. 29:1).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3250.">3250.</span></span>

Verses 7-10. And these are the days of the years of the lives of
Abraham, which he lived; a hundred years, and seventy years, and five
years. And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and
sated, and was gathered to his peoples. And Isaac and Ishmael his sons
buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of
Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; the field which Abraham
purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his
wife. "And these are the days of the years of the lives of Abraham,
which he lived," signifies the state representative by Abraham of the
Lord as to the Divine Itself; "a hundred years, and seventy years, and
five years," signifies the things that belong to this state; "and
Abraham expired and died," signifies the end of the representation by
Abraham; "in a good old age, an old man and sated," signifies something
new in the representation; "and was gathered to his peoples," signifies
that these things were concerning Abraham; "and Isaac and Ishmael his
sons buried him," signifies that the representative of the Lord was now
taken up by Isaac and Ishmael; "in the cave of Machpelah," signifies
resurrection as to truth; "in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the
Hittite, which is before Mamre," signifies as to good; it also signifies
the spiritual, as above, who receive truth and good from the Lord's
Divine Human, and are saved; "the field which Abraham purchased of the
sons of Heth," signifies the Lord's spiritual kingdom thence derived;
"there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife," signifies resuscitation.
