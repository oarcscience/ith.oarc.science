### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="6551.">6551.</span></span>

Upon the faces of Mamre. That this signifies the quality and the
quantity, is evident from the signification of "Mamre," as being the
quality and quantity of that to which it is joined (see n. 2970, 2980,
4613, 6456). That something special is signified by Abraham's having
bought the cave of the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, from
Ephron the Hittite, is evident from its being said so many times, as in
previous chapters: The field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was
before Mamre, was made sure (Gen. 23:17). After this, Abraham buried
Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah upon the faces of
Mamre. And the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto
Abraham for a possession of a sepulcher from the sons of Heth (Gen.
23:19, 20). They buried Abraham in the cave of Machpelah, in the field
of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is upon the faces of
Mamre; the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth (Gen. 25:9,
10). Bury me in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is
upon the faces of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought
with the field from Ephron the Hittite, for a possession of a sepulcher.
The purchase of the field, and of the cave that is therein, was from the
sons of Heth (Gen. 49:30-32). And in this chapter: They buried him in
the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field
for a possession of a sepulcher, from Ephron the Hittite, upon the faces
of Mamre (Gen. 50:13). The special thing which is signified by this
frequent repetition in nearly the same words, is that by Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob is represented the Lord; by their burial is represented
resurrection and resuscitation; by the cave of the field of Machpelah,
the beginning of regeneration; by Ephron the Hittite, those who receive
the good of faith and suffer themselves to be regenerated; and by the
sons of Heth, the spiritual church. And it is because all these things
combined signify the setting up again of a spiritual church that they
are so many times repeated.

Verse 14. And Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren, and all
that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his
father. "And Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren," signifies
the life of the internal celestial and of the truths of faith in
memory-knowledges; "and all that went up with him to bury his father,"
signifies all things that conduce to regeneration; "after he had buried
his father," signifies to resuscitate the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6553.">6553.</span></span>

And Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren. That this signifies
the life of the internal celestial and of the truths of faith in
memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "returning," as
being to live (see n. 5614, 6518); from the representation of Joseph, as
being the internal celestial (n. 5869, 5877, 6177); from the
representation of the sons of Israel, who are here "his brethren," as
being the truths of faith in the complex (n. 5414, 5879, 5951); and from
the signification of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (n. 1164, 1165,
1186, 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966). The life of the internal celestial and of
the truths of faith in memory-knowledges, has been treated of in the
chapters where Joseph is made lord of the land of Egypt and governor to
the house of Pharaoh; and afterward where is described the journeying of
the sons of Jacob to Joseph, and their coming with their father Jacob to
Egypt (see n. 6004, 6023, 6052, 6071, 6077).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6554.">6554.</span></span>

And all that went up with him to bury his father. That this signifies
all things that conduce to regeneration, is evident from the
signification of "burying," as being regeneration and resurrection (see
n. 2916, 2917, 4621, 6516); and as being the resuscitation and setting
up again of the church (see n. 5551, 6516). All things which conduce
thereto are signified by "all that went up with him," for they were the
whole house of Joseph, also the house of his father, and likewise the
elders of the house of Pharaoh, and the elders of the land of Egypt; and
by the "house of Joseph" are signified the celestial things of the
spiritual (n. 6526); by the "house of his father," all things of
spiritual good (n. 6528); by the "elders of the house of Pharaoh," those
which agree with good (n. 6524); and by the "elders of the land of
Egypt," those which agree with truth (see n. 6525). Hence it is plain
that by "all who went up with him to bury" are signified all things that
conduce to regeneration. That "to bury" signifies both regeneration and
resurrection, and likewise the resuscitation and setting up again of the
church, is because these significations involve what is like; for
regeneration is resurrection, because when man is being regenerated he
is becoming alive from being dead, thus is rising again. And in like
manner when the church is being resuscitated and set up again in a man;
for this is effected by regeneration, thus by resurrection from death
unto life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6555.">6555.</span></span>

After he had buried his father. That this signifies to resuscitate the
church, is evident from the signification of "being buried," as being
the resuscitation of the church (see n. 6554); and from the
representation of Israel, as being the spiritual church (n. 4286, 6426,
6514, 6517, 6522).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6556.">6556.</span></span>

Verses 15-21. And Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, and
they said, Peradventure Joseph will hate us, and returning will return
unto us all the evil that we requited to him. And they commanded Joseph,
saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, Thus shall ye say
unto Joseph, I pray forgive I pray the transgression of thy brethren,
and their sin, because they requited evil to thee; and now forgive I
pray the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And
Joseph wept when they spake unto him. And his brethren also went and
fell down before him; and they said, Behold we are thy servants. And
Joseph said unto them, Fear ye not; for am I in God's stead? And you
thought evil upon me, but God thought it for good, in order to do as it
is this day, to make alive a great people. And now fear ye not; I will
sustain you, and your babes; and he comforted them, and spake upon their
heart. "And Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead," signifies
the things alienated from truth and good, and a perception that the
church was resuscitated; "and they said, Peradventure Joseph will hate
us," signifies that they had rejected the internal; "and returning will
return unto us all the evil that we requited to him," signifies the
penalty therefore impending according to the desert; "and they commanded
Joseph, saying," signifies influx from the internal and the consequent
perception; "Thy father did command before he died, saying," signifies
that it is by command of the church; "Thus shall ye say unto Joseph,"
signifies perception from the internal what ought to be done; "I pray
forgive I pray the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin,"
signifies supplication and repentance; "because they requited evil to
thee," signifies that they had turned away from the good and truth which
flow in; "and now forgive I pray the transgression of the servants of
the God of thy father," signifies repentance and acknowledgment of the
Divine things of the church; "and Joseph wept when they spake unto him,"
signifies reception from love; "and his brethren also went and fell down
before him," signifies the submission of the things that are in the
natural under the internal; "and they said, Behold, we are thy
servants," signifies that they shall not be at their own disposal; "and
Joseph said unto them, Fear ye not," signifies re-creation by the
internal; "for am I in God's stead?" signifies that God will provide;
"and you thought evil upon me," signifies that the things alienated
intend nothing but evil; "God thought it for good," signifies that the
Divine turns it into good; "in order to do as it is this day," signifies
that this is according to order from eternity; "to make alive a great
people," signifies that from this is life to those who are in the truths
of good; "and now fear ye not," signifies that they should not be
anxious; "I will sustain you, and your babes," signifies that they will
live through the internal from the Divine by means of the truth that is
of the understanding and the good that is of the will; "and he comforted
them," signifies hope; "and spake upon their heart," signifies trust.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6557.">6557.</span></span>

And Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead. That this
signifies the things alienated from truth and good, and a perception
that the church was resuscitated, is evident from the signification of
"seeing," as being to understand and perceive (see n. 2150, 2325, 2807,
3764, 3863, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 5400); from the representation of the
sons of Jacob, who are here the "brethren," as being things alienated
from truth and good (for when they desired to kill Joseph, and sold him,
they represented things alienated from truth and good, which state is
here signified, as is plain from their words, "Peradventure Joseph will
hate us, and returning will return unto us all the evil that we rendered
to him," and it is from this that they had then represented what is
opposite); from the signification of "being dead," as being to be
resuscitated, that is, the church (n. 3236, 3498, 3505, 4618, 4621,
6036, 6221); and from the representation of Israel, who is here the
"father," as being the church (see n. 4286, 6426). Hence it is evident
that by the "brethren of Joseph saw that their father was dead," is
signified a perception by things alienated from truth and good that the
church was resuscitated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6558.">6558.</span></span>

And they said, Peradventure Joseph will hate us. That this signifies
that they had rejected the internal, is evident from the signification
of "holding in hatred," as being to be averse to, and to reject; and
from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (see n. 6177,
6224). Not that Joseph rejected, but that they rejected Joseph. That
there is attributed to the internal (which is "Joseph") that which is of
the external (which is his "brethren") is according to the appearance,
in the same way as hatred and revenge are attributed to Jehovah,
although they pertain to man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6559.">6559.</span></span>

And returning will return unto us all the evil that we requited to him.
That this signifies the penalty therefore impending according to the
desert, is evident from the signification of "returning the evil that we
requited to him," as being the penalty according to the desert; for
returning the evil which is done anyone, is penalty from having deserved
it. How the case is with returning evil, or with penalties, in the
spiritual world, must be told, because from this the internal sense of
these words is plain. If evil spirits do any evil in the world of
spirits beyond what they have imbued themselves with by their life in
the world, punishers are instantly at hand and chastise them in exact
accordance with the degree in which they pass these limits; for it is a
law in the other life that no one must become worse than he had been in
this world. They who are being punished cannot tell how these chastisers
know that the evil is beyond what they had imbued themselves with; but
they are informed that there is such an order in the other life that the
very evil is attended with its penalty, so that the evil of the deed is
wholly conjoined with the evil of the penalty, that is to say, its
penalty is in the evil itself; and therefore that it is according to
order for the requiters to be instantly at hand. \[2\] This is what
happens when evil spirits do evil in the world of spirits; but in their
own hell they chastise one another according to the evil which they had
by act imbued themselves with in this world; for this evil they bring
with them into the other life. From all this it is evident how it is to
be understood that the penalty impends according to the desert, which is
signified by the words, "returning he will return unto us all the evil
that we requited to him." But as regards good spirits, if perchance they
speak or do evil, they are not punished, but pardoned, and also excused;
for their end is not to speak or do evil, and they know that such things
are excited in them by hell, so that they have not come to pass by their
fault; and the same is also observed from their resistance, and
afterward from their grief.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6560.">6560.</span></span>

And they commanded Joseph, saying. That this signifies influx from the
internal and the consequent perception, is evident from the
signification of "to command," as being influx (see n. 5486, 5732); from
the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (n. 6177, 6224) and
from the signification of "saying," as being perception (of which
frequently above). Hence by "they commanded Joseph, saying" is signified
influx from the internal, and the consequent perception. The reason why
their command to Joseph denotes influx from the internal into the
external, and not from the external into the internal, is that all
influx comes from within, and never from without (see n. 6322).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6561.">6561.</span></span>

Thy father did command before he died, saying. That this signifies that
it is by command of the church, is evident from the representation of
Israel, here the "father," as being the church (see n. 4286, 6426); from
the signification of "commanding," as being influx (n. 6560), and in
this case command, because it comes from the church, thus from the
Divine; and from the signification of "before he died," as being while
the church still existed. That it is by command of the church that
everyone ought to forgive his brother or neighbor, is evident from the
Lord's words in Matthew: Peter said unto Jesus, Lord, how often shall my
brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus
saith to him, I say not until seven times, but until seventy times seven
(Matt. 18:21, 22). But it was ingrained in the Jewish nation that they
should never forgive, but should hold as an enemy everyone who had in
any way injured them, and they then thought it allowable to hate him,
and to treat him as they chose, even to kill him. The reason was that
this nation was in externals alone without what is internal, thus was in
no command of the internal church. This was the reason why the brethren
of Joseph were so much afraid that Joseph would hate them, and would
requite evil to them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6562.">6562.</span></span>

Thus shall ye say unto Joseph. That this signifies perception from the
internal what ought to be done, is evident from the signification of
"saying," in the historic Word, as being perception (see n. 1791, 1815,
1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3509, 5687, 5743); and from
the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (n. 6177, 6224,
6560). That it is perception of what ought to be done, is signified by
"thus shall ye say."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6563.">6563.</span></span>

I pray forgive I pray the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin.
That this signifies supplication and repentance, is evident from the
signification of "I pray forgive I pray," as being supplication; and
that it also denotes repentance is plain from the confession that they
had transgressed and sinned, and also from what follows, that they
offered themselves to Joseph for servants. Mention is made of both
"transgression" and "sin" because of the marriage of truth and good in
every detail of the Word; for "transgression" signifies evil against
truth, which is less; and "sin," evil against good, which is greater;
hence it is that both are mentioned; as also in other passages: Jacob
said to Laban, What is my transgression? what is my sin? that thou hast
pursued after me (Gen. 31:36). In Isaiah: I will blot out as a cloud thy
transgressions, and as a cloud thy sins (Isa. 44:22). In Ezekiel: In his
transgression that he hath transgressed, and in his sin that he hath
sinned, in these shall he die (Ezek. 18:24). Again: While your
transgressions are revealed, so that in all your works your sins may
appear (Ezek. 21:24). And in David: Blessed is he whose transgression is
forgiven, whose sin is covered (Ps. 32:1).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6564.">6564.</span></span>

Because they requited evil to thee. That this signifies because they had
turned away from the good and truth which flow in, is evident from the
signification of "evil," as being a turning away (see n. 5746). That it
denotes from the good and truth which flow in, is signified by "they
requited to thee," for "Joseph" is the celestial, and internal good (see
n. 5805, 5826, 5827, 5869, 5877), through which good and truth flow in
from the Lord. As regards the influx through the internal, the case is
this. The Lord continually flows in through man's internal with good and
truth, good giving life and its heat, which is love, and truth giving
enlightenment and its light, which is faith. But when this influx
advances further, namely, into the exteriors, with the evil it is
resisted and rejected, or is perverted or stifled; and then according to
the rejection, perversion, or stifling, the interiors are closed, an
entrance only remaining open here and there as through chinks round
about; and from this there remains to the man the capacity to think and
will, but against truth and good. This closing penetrates toward the
exteriors more and more, according to the life of evil, and the
consequent persuasion of falsity, and this down to the sensuous degree,
from which then comes the thought. Pleasures and cravings then carry
everything off. In such a state are those who are in the hells; for all
considerations of what is honorable and good for the sake of gain,
honor, and reputation, are taken away from the evil who come into the
other life, and then they are in what is sensuous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6565.">6565.</span></span>

And now forgive I pray the transgression of the servants of the God of
thy father. That this signifies repentance and acknowledgment of the
Divine things of the church, is evident from the signification of
"forgive I pray the transgression," as being confession of having
transgressed, and repentance; and from the signification of the
"servants of the God of thy father," as being acknowledgment of the
Divine things of the church. For by calling themselves the "servants of
the God of his father," they acknowledge that they serve the God of the
church, consequently they acknowledge the Divine things therein; for by
"Israel," here the "father," is signified the church (see n. 4286,
6426).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6566.">6566.</span></span>

And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. That this signifies reception
from love, is evident from the signification of "weeping," as being a
significant of both sorrow and love (see n. 3801, 5480, 5873, 5927,
5930); from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal
celestial (n. 5805, 5826, 5827, 5869, 5877, 6177, 6224); and from the
signification of "speaking," as being influx, and thence reception (see
n. 5797); for the influx is from the internal celestial, which is
"Joseph," and the reception is by the truths in the natural, which are
his "brethren." Hence it is evident that by "Joseph wept when they spake
unto him" is signified reception from love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6567.">6567.</span></span>

And his brethren also went and fell down before him. That this signifies
submission of the things that are in the natural under the internal, is
evident from the representation of the sons of Israel, who here are the
"brethren," as being spiritual truths in the natural (see n. 5414, 5879,
5951); from the signification of "falling down before him," as being
submission; and from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal
(n. 6499). From this it is plain that by his "brethren went and fell
down before him" is signified the submission of the things that are in
the natural under the internal. In this chapter is described the setting
up again of a spiritual church, and in this passage the submission of
the things in the natural under the internal; of which submission be it
known that the spiritual church cannot possibly be instituted with
anyone, unless the things that belong to the natural or external man
have been made submissive to the spiritual or internal man. So long as
the mere truth which is of faith predominates with a man, and not the
good which is of charity, so long the natural or external man has not
been made submissive to the spiritual or internal man. But as soon as
good has the dominion, the natural or external man submits himself, and
then the man becomes a spiritual church. That such is the case is known
from the fact that the man does from affection what the truth teaches,
and that he does not act contrary to this affection, however the natural
desires it. The very affection and consequent reason have the dominion,
and subdue in the natural the delights of the love of self and of the
world, as also the fallacies which had filled the memory-knowledges
there; and at last so completely that this subjugation comes to be among
the man's pleasures; and then the natural is at rest, and afterward is
in agreement; and when it is in agreement, it then partakes of the
pleasantness of the internal. From all this it may be known what is
meant by the submission of the things in the natural under the internal,
which is signified by "his brethren went and fell down before him, and
said, Behold we are thy servants."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6568.">6568.</span></span>

And they said, Behold we are thy servants. That this signifies that they
shall not be at their own disposal, is evident from the signification of
"servants," as being to be without freedom from their own, thus not to
be at their own disposal and mastery (see n. 5760, 5763).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6569.">6569.</span></span>

And Joseph said unto them, Fear ye not. That this signifies re-creation
by the internal, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being
the internal (see n. 6499); and from the signification of "Fear not," as
being that they should not be anxious; and as in what now follows Joseph
leads them away from this anxiety by comforting them and speaking upon
their heart, therefore by "Fear ye not," is signified re-creation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6570.">6570.</span></span>

For am I in God's stead? That this signifies that God will provide, is
evident from the signification of "am I in God's stead?" as being not to
be God, but that God will provide.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6571.">6571.</span></span>

And you thought evil upon me. That this signifies that the things
alienated intend nothing but evil, is evident from the representation of
the sons of Jacob, who here are "you," as being things alienated from
truth and good (see n. 6557), for when they thought evil against Joseph,
they then represented things alienated; and from the signification of
"thinking evil upon me" as being to intend evil; for the evil which is
thought against anyone is intended; and as things alienated cannot
intend good, it is therefore said that they intend nothing but evil. The
case herein is this. The man who has been alienated from good and truth
intends nothing but evil, because he cannot intend good; and what he
intends, reigns with him, and therefore is in all his thoughts, and in
every least detail of him; for the intention or end is the veriest life
of man, the end being his love, and the love being his life. And what is
more, a man is exactly such as is the end with him, and such also is his
image in the light of heaven; and-this may surprise you-such as is his
image in general, such is the image of the least things of his will.
Thus the whole man is such as his end is. \[2\] From this it is evident
that the man who is an evil end cannot possibly be among those who are
good ends; thus he who is in hell cannot possibly be in heaven; for the
ends conflict, and the good ends prevail, because they are from the
Divine. Hence also it is evident that they do not think truly who
believe that everyone can be admitted into heaven from mercy alone; for
if one who is an evil end comes into heaven, his life labors as with one
who lies in the death agony, and he is direfully tortured; besides that
in the light of heaven he appears as a devil. Hence it is evident that
they who have been alienated from truth and good can think nothing but
evil; and that this evil is in the least things of their thought and
will is very manifest from the sphere which from afar exhales from such
spirits, for their quality is thereby perceived. This sphere is like a
spiritual evaporation from every detail of the life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6572.">6572.</span></span>

But God thought it for good. That this signifies that the Divine turns
it to good, is evident from the signification of "thinking for good," as
being to intend (see n. 6571); but as it is said of God, it denotes to
turn into good; for what God intends, He does.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6573.">6573.</span></span>

In order to do as it is this day. That this signifies that this is
according to order from eternity, is evident from the signification of
"doing," when said of the Divine, as being order, for whatever the
Divine does, is order; and from the signification of, "as it is this
day," as being from eternity (see n. 2838, 3998, 4304, 6165, 6298).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6574.">6574.</span></span>

To make alive a great people. That this signifies that from this is life
to those who are in the truths of good, is evident from the
signification of "making alive," as being spiritual life (see n. 5890,
6032); and from the signification of "people," as being truth (n. 1259,
1260, 3295, 3581, 4619), here the truth of good, because it is said a
"great people." For truth from good is great in comparison with the
truth from which good is, because the former truth (that which is from
good) is in itself good, because formed from good; thus is good in its
form. \[2\] The words which Joseph here spake to his brethren: "Ye
thought evil against me, God thought it for good, in order to do as it
is this day, to make alive a great people" are words which contain
within them a secret of heaven, which secret is this. In the other life
the Lord permits infernal spirits to lead the good into temptation,
consequently to pour in evils and falsities; which also they do with all
endeavor; for when they are doing this, they are in their life and its
delight. But the Lord Himself is then present with those in temptation,
both immediately, and mediately by angels, and resists by rebutting the
falsities of the infernal spirits, and by dissipating their evil, thus
giving refreshment, hope, and victory. Thus with those who are in the
truths of good, the truths of faith and the goods of charity are more
inwardly implanted and more strongly confirmed. This is the means by
which spiritual life is bestowed. \[3\] From all this it is evident what
is signified in the internal sense by the words in this verse, namely,
that they who have been alienated from truth and good, as are the
spirits who induce temptations, intend nothing but evil, but that the
Divine turns it into good, and this according to order from eternity,
whence comes life to those who are in the truths of good. For be it
known that the infernal spirits to whom it is permitted thus to trouble
the good, intend nothing but evil; for they desire with all their might
to drag them down from heaven and cast them into hell; because it is the
very delight of their life to destroy anyone as to his soul; thus to
eternity. But not one whit is permitted them by the Lord, except to the
end that good may come of it, namely, that truth and good may be brought
into shape and strengthened with those who are in temptation. In the
universal spiritual world reigns the end which proceeds from the Lord,
which is that nothing whatever, not even the least thing, shall arise,
except that good may come from it. Hence the Lord's kingdom is called a
kingdom of ends and uses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6575.">6575.</span></span>

And now fear ye not. That this signifies that they should not be
anxious, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6576.">6576.</span></span>

I will sustain you, and your babes. That this signifies that they will
live through the internal from the Divine by means of the truth that is
of the understanding and the good that is of the will, is evident from
the signification of "sustaining," as being the influx of good and truth
(see n. 6106), thus life through truth and good; and from the
representation of Joseph, as being the internal (n. 6499). But as
spiritual life is not from the internal, but through the internal from
the Lord, it is said, "through the internal from the Divine." By "you
and your babes" are signified spiritual truths in the natural, and the
innocence that is in them, which were to live through the internal from
the Divine by means of truth and good. That "to sustain" denotes life by
means of truth and good, is because spiritual food is knowledge,
intelligence, and wisdom, thus truth and good (n. 56-58, 681, 4792,
5293, 5340, 5342, 5576, 5579). The reason why it is said, "truth which
is of the understanding and good which is of the will" is that all truth
belongs to the understanding, and all good to the will; for the
understanding is the receptacle of truth, and the will is the receptacle
of good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6577.">6577.</span></span>

And he comforted them. That this signifies hope, is evident from the
signification of "comforting," as being to appease unrest of mind with
hope (see n. 3610).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6578.">6578.</span></span>

And spake upon their heart. That this signifies trust, is evident from
the signification of "speaking upon the heart," as being to impart
trust, namely, that evil should not befall; for "to speak" denotes
influx (see n. 2951, 5481, 5797), and the "heart" denotes the will (n.
2930, 3888); thus "to speak upon the heart" denotes influx into the
will, and the resulting trust. From all this it is also evident that
there is a marriage of truth which is of the understanding, and of good
which is of the will, in every detail of the Word; for "comforting" is
said of the understanding, and "speaking upon the heart," of the will;
therefore also his "comforting them" signifies hope, for this is of the
understanding by means of truth; and his "speaking upon their heart"
signifies trust, for this is of the will by means of good, because
genuine trust is impossible with any but those who are in the good of
charity; and genuine hope with any but those who are in the good of
faith.

Verses 22, 23. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and
Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. And Joseph saw Ephraim's sons of
the third generation: the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were
born upon Joseph's knees. "And Joseph dwelt in Egypt," signifies the
life of the memory-knowledges of the church from the internal; "he and
his father's house," signifies from the internal and its good; "and
Joseph lived a hundred and ten years," signifies the state and quality;
"and Joseph saw Ephraim's sons of the third generation," signifies the
setting up again of the church in respect to the intellectual, and its
derivatives; "the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh," signifies,
and in respect to the will and its derivatives; "were born upon Joseph's
knees," signifies that they were from good conjoined with truth from the
internal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6580.">6580.</span></span>

And Joseph dwelt in Egypt. That this signifies the life of the
memory-knowledges of the church from the internal, is evident from the
signification of "dwelling," as being life (see n. 1293, 3384, 3613,
4451, 6051); from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal
(n. 6499); and from the signification of "Egypt," as being the
memory-knowledges of the church (n. 4749, 4964, 4966, 6004). In the
preceding verses of this chapter the subject treated of is the spiritual
church that was to be set up again; and after the external or natural
has been made completely submissive to the internal or spiritual-which
is signified by Joseph's brethren falling down before him and offering
themselves to him for servants-the subject now treated of is this church
when set up again, which is described in these verses by Joseph's
dwelling in Egypt, and by sons being born of Ephraim, and of Machir the
son of Manasseh. With the man who is a spiritual church there is life
from the internal in the memory-knowledges of the church; for the
memory-knowledges with him are made subordinate, and reduced into such
order that they receive the influx of good and of truth, so as to be
receptacles of influx from the internal. It is otherwise with those who
are not a church, the memory-knowledges with these persons being so
disposed that things confirmatory of truth and good have been rejected
to the sides, thus far removed from the light of heaven; and thereafter
the things that remain are receptive of falsity and evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6581.">6581.</span></span>

He and his father's house. That this signifies from the internal and its
good, is evident from the representation of Joseph, who here is "he," as
being the internal (see n. 6499); and from the signification of "house,"
as being good (n. 2048, 3720, 4982).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6582.">6582.</span></span>

And Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. That this signifies the state
and quality, is evident from the signification of numbers in the Word,
as being things (see n. 575, 1963, 1988, 2075, 2252, 3252, 4264, 5265,
6175); and indeed the state and quality of the thing (n. 4670). So also
it is with the number a "hundred and ten," which contains the state and
quality of the life of memory-knowledges from the internal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6583.">6583.</span></span>

And Joseph saw Ephraim's sons of the third generation. That this
signifies the setting up again of the church in respect to the
intellectual and its derivatives, is evident from the representation of
Ephraim, as being the intellectual of the church (see n. 3969, 5354,
6222, 6234, 6238, 6267); and from the signification of "sons of the
third generation," as being derivatives; for as sons and the sons of
sons descend from a parent, they denote the derivatives of that which is
represented by the parent. The setting up again of the church from the
internal, that is, through the internal from the Lord, is signified by
"Joseph saw." (What the intellectual of the church represented by
Ephraim is, see n. 6222.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6584.">6584.</span></span>

The sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh. That this signifies and in
respect to the will and its derivatives, is evident from the
representation of Manasseh, as being the will of the church (see n.
5351, 5353, 5354, 6222, 6238, 6267, 6296); and from the signification of
his "sons" and "sons' sons," here the "sons of Machir," as being the
derivatives (n. 6583); the derivatives of the will of the
church-signified by the "sons of Machir"-are goods conjoined with
truths, thus also truths from good, for the truths that have been
derived from good are forms of good. That the "sons of Machir" denote
goods conjoined with truths is signified by their being "born on
Joseph's knees," as presently follows; and that they denote truths from
good is signified in the book of Judges: "Out of Machir shall come down
lawgivers" (Judg. 5:14); "lawgivers" denote truths from good (n. 6372).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6585.">6585.</span></span>

Were born upon Joseph's knees. That this signifies that they were from
good conjoined with truth from the internal, is evident from the
signification of "bringing forth on the knees," as being the conjunction
of good and truth (see n. 3915); and from the representation of Joseph,
as being the internal (n. 6499). The sons of Machir being born upon
Joseph's knees involves that Joseph acknowledged them as his own, for
when it is so said, it is signified that they are adopted as his own, as
may be seen from the sons born of Bilhah the maidservant of Rachel,
concerning whom Rachel says: Behold my handmaid Bilhah, come unto her,
and she shall bear upon my knees, and I also shall be built up by her
(Gen. 30:3). The reason why these sons were acknowledged by Joseph as
his own, was that by Manasseh is represented the will of the church,
thus its good; and the internal which is represented by Joseph flows in
with good, but not with truth except through good; hence it is that
these are said to be "born upon Joseph's knees."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6586.">6586.</span></span>

Verses 24-26. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; and visiting God
will visit you, and will make you go up out of this land unto the land
which He sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And Joseph took an
oath of the sons of Israel, saying, Visiting God will visit you, and ye
shall make my bones go up from hence. And Joseph died, a son of a
hundred and ten years; and they embalmed him, and he was put in an ark
in Egypt. "And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die," signifies a
prediction that the internal of the church will cease; "and visiting God
will visit you," signifies that the last time will come; "and will make
you go up out of this land unto the land which He sware to Abraham, to
Isaac, and to Jacob," signifies that they will come to the state of the
church in which the ancients were; "and Joseph took an oath of the sons
of Israel," signifies a binding; "Visiting God will visit you,"
signifies when this last of the church will come; "and ye shall make my
bones go up from hence," signifies that there will be the representative
of a church, but not a representative church, which must be in the
internal also; "and Joseph died," signifies that the internal of the
church ceased to be; "a son of a hundred and ten years," signifies the
state then; "and they embalmed him," signifies preservation still; "and
he was put in an ark in Egypt," signifies concealment in the
memory-knowledges of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6587.">6587.</span></span>

And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die. That this signifies a
prediction that the internal of the church will cease, is evident from
the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (see n. 6499), here
the internal of the church, because in what precedes the subject treated
of has been the church set up again by the internal, that is, through
the internal by the Lord; and from the signification of "dying," as
being to cease to be such (n. 494); thus to cease. (That "dying" denotes
the last time of the church, may be seen above, n. 2908, 2912, 2917,
2923.) Prediction concerning this time is signified by "Joseph said unto
his brethren;" for in what now follows, even to the end, the subject
treated of is the further state of the church. Hence it is plain that by
"Joseph said unto his brethren, I die," is signified that the internal
of the church will cease. \[2\] The case herein is this. A church in
order to exist must be internal and external, for there are those who
are in the internal of the church, and those who are in its external;
the former are few, but the latter are very numerous. Nevertheless with
those with whom is the internal church, the external must be also, for
the internal of the church cannot be separated from its external; and
also with those with whom is the external church, the internal must be
also, but with these the internal is in obscurity. \[3\] The internal of
the church consists in willing good from the heart, and in being
affected with good; and its external consists in doing it, and this
according to the truth of faith which the man knows from good; but the
external of the church consists in the devout performance of rituals,
and in doing works of charity, according to the precepts of the church.
From this it is evident that the internal of the church is the good of
charity in the will. Therefore when this ceases, the church itself also
ceases, for the good of charity is its essential. External worship
indeed remains afterward, as before, but then it is not worship, but a
rite, which is preserved because it has been so appointed; but this
rite, which appears like worship, is like a shell without a kernel, for
it is an external which remains wherein is no internal. When such is the
state of the church it is at its end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6588.">6588.</span></span>

And visiting God will visit you. That this signifies that the last time
will come, is evident from the signification of "being visited," as
being the last time, here the last time of the oppression of the sons of
Israel in Egypt; in the internal sense, the last time of an old church,
and the first of a new one. In the Word this last time is called
"visitation," and is predicated both of the church in general, and also
of those who are within the church in particular; and of the new church
which is being born, and of the old church which is expiring; in
particular of the man of the church who is being saved, and of him who
is being damned. \[2\] That these things are signified in the Word by
"visitation," and the "day of visitation," may be seen from the
following passages. In Luke: Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for He
hath visited and wrought deliverance for His people. Through the bowels
of mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us,
that He may appear to them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death
(Luke 1:68, 78, 79); this is the prophetic utterance of Zacharias
concerning the Lord when born; "to be visited" here denotes the raising
up of a new church, and the enlightenment then of those who were in
ignorance of the truth and good of faith, thus their deliverance; and
therefore it is said, "He hath visited and wrought deliverance for His
people," "He hath visited that He may appear to them that sit in
darkness and the shadow of death." \[3\] In Moses: Jehovah said unto
Moses, Gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah
the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob,
hath appeared to me, saying, Visiting I will visit you, and that which
is done to you in Egypt (Exod. 3:16). Again: The people believed; and
they heard that Jehovah had visited the sons of Israel (Exod. 4: 31).
"To be visited here denotes the last time when the church has ceased,
and the first when it is beginning; the last with the Egyptians, and the
first with the sons of Israel; thus also the deliverance of the latter.
\[4\] In Jeremiah: They shall be carried away to Babylon; and there
shall they be even until the day that I will visit them; then will I
make to come up the vessels of the house of God, and I will bring them
back unto this place (Jer. 27:22). Again: When seventy years have been
fulfilled to Babylon, I will visit you, and I will establish upon you My
good word, and will bring you back unto this place (Jer. 29:10); where
"to visit" denotes to deliver; in general the last time of captivity and
desolation. \[5\] "Visitation" and the "day of visitation" denote the
last time of the church, in Isaiah: What will ye do in the day of
visitation and of devastation? it shall come from afar; unto whom will
ye flee for help? (Isa. 10:3). Again: Behold the day of Jehovah cometh,
cruel, and of indignation, and of wrath, and of anger, to make the earth
a waste. I will visit evil upon the world, and their iniquity upon the
wicked (Isa. 13:9, 11). In Jeremiah: They shall fall among them that
fall; and in the time of their visitation they shall stumble (Jer.
8:12). In Hosea: The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense
are come (Jer. 9:7). In Moses: Jehovah said to Moses, Notwithstanding,
go, lead this people in, whither I have spoken to thee; behold, Mine
angel shall go before thee; but in the day of My visiting I will visit
upon them their sin (Exod. 32:34). In Luke: Jesus said concerning
Jerusalem, They shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because
thou hast not acknowledged the time of thy visitation (Luke 19:44). The
"day of visitation" denotes the coming of the Lord, and enlightenment
then; but in respect to the Jewish nation, as they did not acknowledge
it, it denotes the last time of the representatives of the church with
them; for when Jerusalem was destroyed, the sacrifices ceased, and that
nation was scattered. \[6\] In Ezekiel: A great voice cried in mine
ears, The visitations of the city have come nigh, and a man has his
instrument of destruction in his hand (Ezek. 9:1); where the sense is
similar. In Isaiah: The Rephaim shall not rise, in that Thou hast
visited, Thou hast extinguished them (Isa. 26:14); the "Rephaim" denote
the posterity of the Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood,
who are also called "Nephilim" and "Anakim" (see n. 567, 581, 1673);
"Thou hast visited and extinguished the Rephaim" denotes the last time
of that church, and also the casting of them into hell (n. 1265-1272).
"Visitation" denotes requital, thus damnation, in Jeremiah: Shall I not
visit for this? shall not My soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
(Jer. 5:9). Again: I will bring the destruction of Esau upon him in the
time that I shall visit him (Jer. 49:8). And in Hosea: I will visit upon
him his ways, and I will requite his works (Hos. 4:9).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6589.">6589.</span></span>

And will make you go up out of this land unto the land which He sware to
Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. That this signifies that they will come
to the state of the church in which the ancients were, is evident from
the signification of the "land of Egypt," from which they were to "go
up," as being the vastated church, which was represented by the
Egyptians oppressing the sons of Israel; and its destruction, by their
being overwhelmed in the sea Suph; and from the signification of the
"land of Canaan," to which the sons of Israel were to "go up," as being
the Lord's kingdom and church (see n. 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4447,
4517). \[2\] That this is the Ancient Church, or the state of the church
in which were the ancients, is signified by its being designated as the
"land which God sware to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob;" for
by these in the supreme sense is meant the Lord, and in the
representative sense His kingdom in the heavens, and His kingdom on the
earth, which is the church (see n. 1965, 1989, 2011, 3245, 3305, 6098,
6185, 6276). Thus "to swear to give the land to them," is to confirm
that they shall come to the state of the church in which the ancients
were. Not that the posterity of Jacob were to come thereto, for they
could not come to the state of that church, but only to its external,
namely, to representatives, and scarcely to these; but that they should
come thereto who are signified by the "sons of Israel," who are all
those who are of the spiritual church, both those who then had been, and
those who were to come. (That "to swear" denotes to confirm from the
Divine, may be seen, n. 2842, 3375.) The reason why the land of Canaan
was promised and given to the descendants of Jacob, was that they might
represent the church; and this because from ancient times the church had
been in that land, and at that time all the places in it were named and
made representative (n. 3686, 4447, 4516, 4517, 5135, 6516).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6590.">6590.</span></span>

And Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel. That this signifies
binding, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6591.">6591.</span></span>

Visiting God will visit you. That this signifies when this last of the
church will come, is evident from the signification of "visiting," as
being the last of the church (see n. 6588).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6592.">6592.</span></span>

And ye shall make my bones go up from hence. That this signifies that
there shall be the representative of a church, but not a church, which
must be in the internal also, is evident from the representation of
Joseph, as being the internal of the church (see n. 6587); and as by him
is represented the internal of the church, by his "bones" is signified
that which is most external, or the ultimate of the church, thus the
representative thereof. For the representatives that had been in the
Ancient Church, and were also instituted with the descendants of Jacob,
were the ultimates of the church; but what they signified and
represented were the internals of the church. These internals are
signified by "flesh in which is spirit," but the ultimates by "bones."
Hence it is evident what is the quality of the church when it is only in
externals without internals, namely, that it is like the bony structure
of a man without flesh. (That with the Israelitish and Jewish people
there was no church, but only the representative of a church, see n.
4281, 4288, 4307, 4500, 4680, 4844, 4847, 4903, 6304; and that the
representative of a church was not instituted with them until after they
had been completely vastated as to the internal; and that otherwise they
would have profaned holy things, n. 4289.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6593.">6593.</span></span>

And Joseph died. That this signifies that the internal of the church
ceased to be, is evident from the signification of "dying," as being to
cease to be such as before (see n. 494, 6587); and from the
representation of Joseph, as being the internal (see n. 6499). (As
regards the quality of the church when the internal has ceased, see
above, n. 6587, 6592.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6594.">6594.</span></span>

A son of a hundred and ten years. That this signifies the state then, is
evident from the signification of a "hundred and ten years," as being
the state and quality of the life of memory-knowledges from the internal
(see n. 6582). (That "years" denote states, see n. 487, 488, 493.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="6595.">6595.</span></span>

And they embalmed him. That this signifies preservation still, is
evident from the signification of "embalming," as being preservation
from the contagion of evil (n. 6503, 6504). As the end of the church is
here treated of, it must be told what is meant by "preservation still
when the church ceases to be," which takes place when its internal
ceases with man (n. 6587, 6592). The external then still remains, but is
such as to have within it an internal; and yet this internal is not then
with the man, because he does not think about it, or if he thinks about
it he is not affected with it; but it is with the angels who are with
the man. And as the man of the vastated church thinks nothing about the
internal, neither is affected with it, and for the most part does not
know that it exists, therefore the internal cannot be injured by him;
for what a man knows, and especially what he has once believed, he can
injure, but not what he either does not know, or does not believe to
exist. In this manner the internal of the church is preserved, lest it
should be affected by any evil. So were the internal things of the
church preserved among the descendants of Jacob; for they were in
externals without an internal, insomuch that they were not even willing
to know about any internal; and therefore the internal things of the
church were not revealed to them. (That internal things were not made
known to the descendants of Jacob lest they should injure them by
profaning, see n. 3398, 3480; and that those cannot profane the internal
things of the church who do not believe them, and still less those who
are ignorant of them, n. 593, 1008, 1059, 2051, 3398, 3402, 3898, 4289,
4601; also that the interior things of the church are not revealed until
the church has been vastated, because then they are no longer believed,
thus neither can they be profaned, see n. 3398, 3399.) These are the
things that are meant by "preservation."

<span class="margnote"><span id="6596.">6596.</span></span>

And he was put in an ark in Egypt. That this signifies concealment in
the memory-knowledges of the church, is evident from the signification
of an "ark," as being that in which something is stored up or concealed;
and from the signification of "Egypt," as being the memory-knowledges of
the church (see n. 4749, 4964, 4966); and the memory-knowledges of the
church were at that time the knowledges of the representatives and
significatives that had been in the Ancient Church. The concealment of
the internal in these is signified by the foregoing words. (Concerning
the concealment of the internal of the church, and the consequent
preservation lest it should suffer injury, see just above, n. 6595.)
That an "ark" denotes that in which something is stored up or concealed,
may be seen from the ark of the Testimony, in that it was called an
"ark" because in it was stored up the Testimony or Law.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6597.">6597.</span></span>

The internal sense of the things contained in the Book of Genesis has
now been treated of. But as in this Book all things are historic, except
the forty-eighth and forty-ninth chapters, in which there are prophetic
things also, therefore it can scarcely appear that the sense which has
been set forth is the internal sense; for the historic things hold back
the mind in the literal sense, and thus remove it from the internal
sense; and the more so because the internal sense is utterly different
from the literal sense; for the one treats of spiritual and celestial
things, and the other of worldly and earthly ones. But that the internal
sense is such as has been set forth, is evident from all the details
that have been unfolded, and especially from the fact that it has been
dictated to me from heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6598.">6598.</span></span>

Continuation about influx, and about the interaction of the soul and the
body. It is known that one man excels another in the capacity to
understand and perceive what is honorable in moral life, what is just in
civil life, and what is good in spiritual life. The cause of this
consists in the elevation of the thought to the things that pertain to
heaven, whereby the thought is withdrawn from the external things of
sense; for they who think solely from things of sense cannot see one
whit of what is honorable, just, and good, and therefore they trust to
others and speak much from the memory, and thereby appear to themselves
wiser than others. But they who are able to think above the things of
sense, provided the things in the memory have been set in order, possess
a greater capacity than others to understand and perceive, and this
according to the degree in which they view things from what is interior.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6599.">6599.</span></span>

How the case is with those who think in the sensuous degree, and with
those who think above this, and also what is the nature of the influx
into the latter and into the former, I may state from experience. But
first be it known that the thought of man is divided into ideas, and
that one idea follows another, as one word follows another in speech.
Yet the ideas of thought succeed each other so quickly that while he is
in the body a man's thought appears to him as if it were continuous, and
thus as if there were no division. But in the other life it is
self-evident that the thought is divided into ideas; for speech is then
effected by means of ideas (see n. 2470, 2478, 2479). It is now
necessary to say how the case is with thought and its ideas, namely,
that the thought diffuses itself into the societies of spirits and of
angels round about, and that the capacity to understand and perceive is
according to the extension into these societies, that is, according to
the influx from them; and in the next place that there are countless
things in one idea of thought, and still more in one thought composed of
ideas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6600.">6600.</span></span>

I have been clearly shown that man's thought, and also that of spirits
and of angels, pours itself around into many societies in the spiritual
world, but the thought of one person in a different way from the thought
of another. In order that I might know this for certain, I have been
allowed to speak with some societies to which my thought had penetrated,
and from this I was given to know what flowed into the thought, from
what society it came, and also where and of what quality the society
was, so that I could not be mistaken. The capacity of understanding and
perceiving in man, spirit, and angel is in accordance with the extension
of his thoughts and affections into the societies. \[2\] He who is in
the good of charity and of faith has extension into the societies of
heaven, ample according to the degree in which he is in them, and in
which he is in genuine good; for these things are in agreement with
heaven, and therefore flow in there spontaneously and widely. Yet there
are some societies into which the affection of truth, and others into
which the affection of good, penetrates. The affection of truth
penetrates to the societies of the spiritual angels, but the affection
of good to the societies of the celestial angels. But on the other hand
the thought and affection of those who are in evil and falsity have
extension into infernal societies, and this also according to the degree
of evil and falsity with them. \[3\] It is said that the thought and
affection of man, spirit, and angel pour themselves around into the
societies, and that from this come the understanding and perception; but
be it known that it is so said according to the appearance, for there is
no influx of the thoughts and affections into the societies; but from
the societies, and this through the angels and spirits with the man. For
as has been shown at the end of preceding chapters, all influx comes
from what is more interior; thus with the good from heaven (that is,
through heaven from the Lord), and with the evil from hell.
