### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="5101.">5101.</span></span>

That were with him in the custody of his lord's house. That this
signifies which were rejected, is evident from the signification of
"being given into custody," thus of "being in custody," as being to be
in a state of rejection (of which also above, n. 5083).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5102.">5102.</span></span>

Saying, Wherefore are your faces evil today? That this signifies from
what affection was this sadness, is evident from the signification of
"faces," as being the interiors (see n. 358, 1999, 2434, 3527, 4066,
4796, 4797), thus the affections. For the interiors of man from which
come the thoughts which are also interiors, are the affections; because
as these are of his love, they are of his life. It is known that with
those who are in innocence the affections are presented visibly in the
face; and as the affections are so presented, so also are the thoughts
in general, for these are the forms of the affections. Hence regarded in
itself the face is nothing else than a representative image of the
interiors. To the angels all faces appear thus, and not otherwise; for
the angels do not see the faces of men in their material form, but in
their spiritual form, that is, in the form which the affections and the
derivative thoughts present. These are what make the very face of man,
as may be known from the fact that when the face is deprived of them it
is a mere dead thing, and that the face has life from them, and is
pleasing according to them. The sadness of the affection, or "from what
affection is it," is signified by his saying, "Wherefore are your faces
evil today?"

<span class="margnote"><span id="5103.">5103.</span></span>

And they said unto him. That this signifies perception concerning these
things, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historic
parts of the Word, as being perception (of which frequently above).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5104.">5104.</span></span>

We have dreamed a dream. That this signifies prediction, is evident from
the signification of a "dream," as being foresight, and hence prediction
(of which also above n. 5091).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5105.">5105.</span></span>

And there is no interpreter of it. That this signifies that no one knows
what is in them, is evident from the signification of an
"interpretation," as being an unfolding of what there is within (see n.
5093), thus of what is in them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5106.">5106.</span></span>

And Joseph said unto them. That this signifies the celestial of the
natural, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being the
celestial of the natural (as above, n. 5086).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5107.">5107.</span></span>

Do not interpretations belong to God? That this signifies that the
Divine is in these things, is evident from the signification of an
"interpretation," when predicated of dreams, as being that which is in
them (as just above, n. 5105). The Divine is signified by "God."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5108.">5108.</span></span>

Tell it me, I pray. That this signifies that it should be known, is
evident from the signification of "tell it, I pray," as involving that
it be known; as is plain from the following verses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5109.">5109.</span></span>

Verses 9-13. And the prince of the butlers told his dream to Joseph, and
said to him, In my dream behold a vine was before me; and in the vine
were three shoots, and it was as though it budded, its blossom went up,
and the clusters thereof ripened grapes. And Pharaoh's cup was in my
hand, and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I
gave the cup upon the palm of Pharaoh. And Joseph said to him, This is
the interpretation of it; The three shoots three days are these. In yet
three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and shall bring thee back
upon thy station, and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand, after
the former manner when thou wast his butler. "And the prince of the
butlers told his dream to Joseph," signifies that the celestial of the
spiritual perceived the event concerning those things which were of the
sensuous subject to the intellectual part, and which had hitherto been
rejected; "and said to him," signifies revelation from perception; "In
my dream," signifies prediction; "behold a vine was before me,"
signifies the intellectual part; "and in the vine were three shoots,"
signifies the derivations thence even to the last; "and it was as though
it budded," signifies the influx by which the rebirth is effected; "its
blossom went up," signifies the state near regeneration; "and the
clusters thereof ripened grapes," signifies conjunction of spiritual
truth with celestial good; "and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand," signifies
the influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and the beginning
of reception; "and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's
cup," signifies reciprocal influx into the goods from a spiritual origin
there; "and I gave the cup upon the palm of Pharaoh," signifies
appropriation by the interior natural; "and Joseph said to him, This is
the interpretation of it," signifies revelation from perception from the
celestial in the natural as to what it had in itself; "the three shoots
three days are these," signifies continuous derivations down to the last
one; "in yet three days," signifies that there would then be a new
state; "shall Pharaoh lift up thy head," signifies what is provided, and
hence what is concluded; "and shall bring thee back upon thy station,"
signifies that the things which are of the sensuous subject to the
intellectual part would be reduced into order, that they might be in the
last place; "and thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand," signifies
that thereby they may serve the interior natural; "after the former
manner," signifies in accordance with the law of order; "when thou wast
his butler," signifies as is usual with sensuous things of this kind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5110.">5110.</span></span>

And the prince of the butlers told his dream to Joseph. That this
signifies that the celestial of the spiritual perceived the event
concerning the things of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part
and which had hitherto been rejected, is evident from the representation
of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual (n. 4286, 4585, 4592,
4594, 4963); and from the signification of a "dream," as being foresight
and hence the event (of which above, n. 5091, 5092, 5104), thus the
event that was foreseen or perceived; and from the signification of the
"prince of the butlers," as being the sensuous subject to the
intellectual part in general (n. 5077, 5082). That it was rejected is
meant by his being in custody (n. 5083, 5101). From these things it is
plain that such is the internal sense of these words. Moreover that
Joseph, by whom is represented the celestial of the spiritual, perceived
the event, is evident from the verses that follow. \[2\] It is said,
"the celestial of the spiritual," and thereby is meant the Lord; the
same may also be said abstractedly of Him, because He is the celestial
itself and the spiritual itself, that is, good itself and truth itself.
As regards man, these cannot indeed be conceived of abstractedly from
person, because what is natural is adjoined to everything of his
thought; nevertheless, when we consider that everything in the Lord is
Divine, and that the Divine is above all thought, and altogether
incomprehensible even to the angels, consequently if we then abstract
that which is comprehensible, there remains being and coming-forth
itself, which is the celestial itself and the spiritual itself, that is,
good itself and truth itself. \[3\] Nevertheless, as man is such that he
can have no idea of thought whatever about abstract things unless he
adjoins something natural which has entered from the world through the
senses (for without some such natural thing his thought perishes as in
an abyss and is dissipated), therefore lest what is Divine should perish
in man when he is wholly immersed in bodily and earthly things, and with
whomsoever it remained it should be defiled by an unclean idea, and
together with what is Divine everything celestial and spiritual thence
derived should also perish, it pleased Jehovah to present Himself such
as He actually is, and such as He appears in heaven, namely, as a Divine
Man. For everything of heaven conspires to the human form, as may be
seen from what has been shown at the end of the chapters concerning the
correspondence of all things of man with the Grand Man, which is heaven.
This Divine, or this of Jehovah in heaven, is the Lord from eternity.
The same the Lord took also upon Him when He glorified or made Divine
the human in Himself, as is very evident from the form in which He
appeared before Peter, James, and John, when He was transfigured (Matt.
17:1, 2); and also in which He at times appeared to the prophets. It is
from this that everyone is able to think of the Divine Itself as of a
Man, and at the same time of the Lord, in whom is all the Divine, and a
perfect Trinity, for in the Lord the Divine Itself is the Father, this
Divine in heaven is the Son, and the Divine thence proceeding is the
Holy Spirit. That these are a one, as He Himself teaches, is hence
manifest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5111.">5111.</span></span>

And said to him. That this signifies revelation from perception, is
evident from the signification of "saying" in the historic parts of the
Word, as being perception (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080,
2619, 2862, 3395, 3509), thus also revelation, for this is internal
perception, and is from perception.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5112.">5112.</span></span>

In my dream. That this signifies prediction, is evident from the
signification of a "dream," as being foresight and prediction therefrom
(of which above, n. 5091, 5092, 5104).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5113.">5113.</span></span>

Behold, a vine was before me. That this signifies the intellectual part,
is evident from the signification of a "vine," as being the intellectual
part in the spiritual church, of which hereafter. As by the "butler" is
signified the sensuous subject to the intellectual part, and as the
influx of the intellectual into the sensuous subordinate thereto is here
treated of, therefore in the dream there appeared a vine with shoots,
blossom, clusters, and grapes, by which is described influx and the
rebirth of this sensuous. As regards the intellectual of the spiritual
church, be it known that where this church is described in the Word, its
intellectual part is everywhere treated of, for the reason that it is
the intellectual part which in the man of this church is regenerated and
becomes a church. \[2\] For there are in general two churches, the
celestial and the spiritual. The celestial church is with the man who
can be regenerated or become a church as to the will part; and the
spiritual church is with the man who, as just said, can be regenerated
only as to the intellectual part. The Most Ancient Church, which was
before the flood, was celestial, because with those who belonged to it
there was some wholeness in the will part; but the Ancient Church, which
was after the flood, was spiritual, because with those who belonged to
it there was not anything whole in the will part, but only in the
intellectual part. For this reason where the spiritual church is treated
of in the Word, its intellectual part is chiefly treated of (on which
subject see above, n. 640, 641, 765, 863, 875, 895, 927, 928, 1023,
1043, 1044, 1555, 2124, 2256, 2669, 4328, 4493). That with those who are
of the spiritual church it is the intellectual part that is regenerated,
may be seen also from the fact that the man of this church has no
perception of truth from good, as had they who were of the celestial
church; but must first learn the truth which is of faith, and become
imbued with what is intellectual, and thus from truth learn what is
good; and after he has thus learned it, he is able to think it, and then
to will it, and at last to do it; and then a new will is formed in him
by the Lord in the intellectual part. By this new will the spiritual man
is elevated by the Lord into heaven, evil still remaining in the will
that is proper to him; which will is then miraculously separated, and
this by a higher force, whereby he is withheld from evil and kept in
good. \[3\] But the man of the celestial church was regenerated as to
the will part, by being imbued from infancy with the good of charity;
and when he had attained to a perception of this, he was led into the
perception of love to the Lord, whereby all the truths of faith appeared
to him in the intellect as in a mirror. The understanding and the will
made in him a mind wholly one; for by the things in the understanding it
was perceived what was in the will. In this consisted the wholeness of
that first "man" by whom the celestial church is signified. \[4\] That a
"vine" is the intellectual part of the spiritual church is evident from
many other passages in the Word; as in Jeremiah: What hast thou to do
with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? Or what hast thou
to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? And yet
I had planted thee a wholly noble vine, a seed of truth; how then art
thou turned to Me into the degenerate shoots of a strange vine? (Jer.
2:18, 21); speaking of Israel, by whom is signified the spiritual church
(n. 3654, 4286). "Egypt" and "the waters of Shihor" denote
memory-knowledges which pervert (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462); "Assyria"
and "the waters of the river" denote reasoning from these knowledges
against the good of life and the truth of faith (n. 119, 1186); a "noble
vine" denotes the man of the spiritual church, who is called a "vine"
from the intellectual part; the "degenerate shoots of a strange vine"
denote the man of the perverted church. \[5\] In Ezekiel: A riddle and a
parable concerning the house of Israel. A great eagle took of the seed
of the land, and placed it in a field of sowing; it budded and became a
luxuriant vine of low stature, so that its shoots looked back toward
her, and the roots thereof were under her; so it became a vine that made
shoots, and sent forth sprigs to the eagle. This vine applied its roots,
and sent its shoots toward her, in a good field by many waters. It was
planted that it might make a branch, that it might be for a vine of
magnificence (Ezek. 17:2-3, 5-8); the "eagle" denotes the rational (n.
3901); the "seed of the land" denotes the truth of the church (n. 1025,
1447, 1610, 1940, 2848, 3038, 3310, 3373); its "becoming a luxuriant
vine" and a "vine of magnificence" denotes becoming a spiritual church,
which is called a "vine" from the wine thence produced, which signifies
spiritual good or the good of charity from whence comes the truth of
faith, implanted in the intellectual part. \[6\] In the same: Thy mother
was like a vine, in thy likeness, planted by the waters; a fruitful one,
and made full of branches by reason of many waters; whence she had rods
of strength for the scepter of them that bear rule; and its stature
lifted itself above among the tangled boughs, and appeared in its height
in the multitude of shoots (Ezek. 19:10-11); also said of Israel, by
whom is signified the spiritual church, which is compared to a "vine"
for a reason like that mentioned just above. In this passage are
described its derivations in the natural man even to the last, namely,
to memory-knowledges from the senses, which are the "tangled boughs" (n.
2831). \[7\] In Hosea: I will be as the dew to Israel; his branches
shall go, and his honor shall be as the olive's, and his odor as
Lebanon's. They that dwell in his shadow shall return; they shall vivify
the corn, and blossom as the vine; his memory shall be as the wine of
Lebanon. O Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols? (Hos.
14:5-8); "Israel" denotes the spiritual church, whose blossoming is
compared to a "vine," and its memory to the "wine of Lebanon," from the
good of faith implanted in the intellectual part; "Ephraim" is the
intellectual part in the spiritual church (n. 3969). \[8\] In Zechariah:
The remains of the people; the seed of peace; the vine shall give her
fruit, and the earth shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give
their dew (Zech. 8:11-12); the "remains of the people" denote truths
stored up by the Lord in the interior man (see n. 468, 530, 560, 561,
660, 798, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284); the "seed of peace" denotes good
there; the "vine," the intellectual part. \[9\] In Malachi: I will
rebuke for you him that consumeth, that he corrupt not for you the fruit
of the land; neither shall the vine be bereaved for you in the field
(Mal. 3:11); the "vine" denotes the intellectual part; the vine is said
"not to be bereaved" when the intellectual part is not deprived of the
truths and goods of faith; on the other hand it is said to be "empty"
when there are falsities therein and consequent evils; as in Hosea:
Israel is an empty vine, he maketh fruit like himself (Hos. 10:1).
\[10\] In Moses: He shall bind his ass's colt unto the vine, and the son
of his ass unto the choice vine, after he hath washed his clothing in
wine, and his covering in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11); from the
prophecy of Jacob, then Israel, about his twelve sons, here about Judah,
by whom is represented the Lord (n. 3881). The "vine" here denotes the
intellectual part in the spiritual church, and the "choice vine," the
intellectual part in the celestial church. \[11\] In David: Jehovah,
Thou hast made to come forth a vine out of Egypt; Thou didst drive out
the nations, and plantedst it. Thou didst cleanse before it, and didst
cause its roots to be rooted so that it filled the land. The mountains
were covered with the shadow of it, and the cedars of God with the
boughs. Thou hast sent forth the shoots thereof even to the sea, and the
little branches thereof to the Euphrates. The boar out of the forest
trampleth it, and the wild beast of the field grazeth it down (Ps.
80:8-11, 13); the "vine out of Egypt" in the supreme sense denotes the
Lord, the glorification of His Human being described by it and its
shoots. In the internal sense the "vine" here is the spiritual church,
and also the man of this church, such as he is when made new or
regenerated by the Lord as to the intellectual and will parts. The "boar
in the forest" is the falsity, and the "wild beast of the fields" the
evil, which destroy the church as to faith in the Lord. \[12\] In
Revelation: The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and vintaged the
vine of the earth; and cast it into the great winepress of the anger of
God; the winepress was trodden outside the city, and there came forth
blood out of the winepress even to the horses' bridles (Rev. 14:19-20);
"to vintage the vine of the earth" denotes to destroy the intellectual
part in the church; and because this is signified by the "vine," it is
also said that "there came forth blood out of the winepress even to the
horses' bridles;" for by "horses" are signified intellectual things (n.
2761, 2762, 3217). In Isaiah: It shall come to pass in that day, that
every place where there were a thousand vines for a thousand of silver,
shall be for briars and brambles (Isa. 7:23). Again: The inhabitants of
the earth shall be burned, and man shall be left rare; the new wine
shall mourn, the vine shall languish (Isa. 24:6-7). Again: They shall
beat themselves upon the paps for the fields of unmixed wine, for the
fruitful vine. Upon the land of My people come up thorn and briar (Isa.
32:12-13). In these passages the subject treated of is the vastation of
the spiritual church as to the good and truth of faith, thus as to the
intellectual part; for as before said the truth and good of faith are in
the intellectual part of the man of this church. Everyone can see that
by a "vine" here is not meant a vine, nor by the "earth" the earth; but
that they mean something of the church. \[13\] As in the genuine sense a
"vine" signifies the good of the intellectual part; and a "fig tree" the
good of the natural man, or what is the same, that a "vine" signifies
the good of the interior man, and a "fig tree" the good of the exterior
man, therefore a "fig tree" is often mentioned in the Word at the same
time as a "vine"; as in the following passages: Consuming I will consume
them; no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf is
fallen (Jer. 8:13). I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of
Israel, which shall eat up thy vine and thy fig tree (Jer. 5:15, 17). In
Hosea: I will lay waste her vine and her fig tree (Hos. 2:12). In Joel:
A nation is come up upon My land, it hath reduced My vine into a waste,
and My fig tree into froth, stripping it hath stripped it, and cast it
forth, the shoots thereof are made white; the vine is withered, and the
fig tree languisheth (Joel 1:6-7, 12). Be not afraid, ye beasts of My
fields; for the dwelling places of the wilderness are become grassy;
because the tree hath made its fruit, and the fig tree and the vine
shall yield their strength (Joel 2:22). In David: He smote their vine
and their fig tree, and brake the tree of their border (Ps. 105:33). In
Habakkuk: The fig tree shall not blossom, and no produce is in the vines
(Hab. 3:17). In Micah: Out of Zion shall go forth doctrine, and the word
of Jehovah from Jerusalem; they shall sit everyone under his vine and
under his fig tree, and none maketh afraid (Micah 4:2, 4). In Zechariah:
In that day shall ye call a man to his fellow, under the vine and under
the fig tree (Zech. 3:10). In the first book of Kings: In the time of
Solomon there was peace from all the passes round about; and Judah and
Israel dwelt in confidence, everyone under his vine and under his fig
tree (1 Kings 4:24-25). That a "fig tree" is the good of the natural or
exterior man, may be seen above (n. 217). \[14\] That a "vine" is the
intellectual part made new or regenerated by good from truth and by
truth from good is evident from the Lord's words to the disciples, after
he had instituted the holy supper: I say to you, I will not drink
henceforth of this product of the vine, until that day when I shall
drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom (Matt. 26:29); good from
truth and truth from good, by which the intellectual part is made new,
or man is made spiritual, are signified by the "product of the vine" and
the appropriation thereof by "drinking." (That "to drink" is to
appropriate, and that it is predicated of truth, may be seen above, n.
3168.) That this is not done fully except in the other life is signified
by "until that day when I shall drink it new with you in My Father's
kingdom." That by the "product of the vine" is not meant must or wine,
but something heavenly of the Lord's kingdom is very manifest. \[15\] As
the intellectual part in the spiritual man is made new and regenerated
by truth which is from the Lord alone, therefore the Lord compares
Himself to a "vine" and those who are implanted in the truth which is
from Him, and consequently in Him, He compares to the "shoots" and the
good therefrom to the "fruit" in John: I am the true vine, and My Father
is the vine dresser; every shoot in Me that beareth not fruit, He taketh
away; but every shoot that beareth fruit, He pruneth it, that it may
bear more fruit. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the shoot cannot bear
fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; so neither can ye, except
ye abide in Me. I am the vine, ye are the shoots; he that abideth in Me,
and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for without Me ye can do
nothing. This is My commandment, that ye love one another as I have
loved you (John 15:1-2, 4-5, 12). \[16\] As in the supreme sense a
"vine" signifies the Lord as to Divine truth, and hence in the internal
sense the man of the spiritual church, therefore a "vineyard" signifies
the spiritual church itself (n. 1069, 3220). As the Nazirite represented
the celestial man, who is regenerated through the good of love, and not
through the truth of faith like the spiritual man, and who consequently
is not regenerated as to the intellectual part, but as to the will part
(as may be seen above), therefore the Nazirite was forbidden to eat
anything which came forth from the vine, thus was not to drink wine
(Num. 6:3, 4; Judges 13:14); from this also it is evident that by the
"vine" is signified the intellectual part that belongs to the spiritual
man, as already shown. \[17\] (That the Nazirite represented the
celestial man may be seen above, n. 3301.) Hence also it may be seen
that it cannot possibly be known why the Nazirite was forbidden whatever
came forth from the vine (not to mention many other things regarding
him), unless it is known what the "vine" signifies in its own sense, and
also unless it is known that there is a celestial church and a spiritual
church, and that the man of the celestial church is regenerated in a
manner different from the man of the spiritual church-the former by
means of seed implanted in the will part, the latter by means of seed
implanted in the intellectual part. Such are the arcana stored up in the
internal sense of the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5114.">5114.</span></span>

And in the vine were three shoots. That this signifies the derivations
thence even to the last, is evident from the signification of the
"vine," as being the intellectual part (of which just above, n. 5113);
and from the signification of "three," as being what is complete and
continuous even to the end (n. 2788, 4495); and from the signification
of "shoots," as being derivations. For as the "vine" is the intellectual
part, the "shoots" are nothing else than derivations thence; and as
"three" signifies what is continuous even to the end, or from the first
even to the last, by "three shoots" are signified the derivations from
the intellectual part down to the last, which is the sensuous; for the
first in order is the intellectual part, and the last is the sensuous.
The intellectual part in general is the sight of the internal man, which
sees from the light of heaven, which is from the Lord, and all that it
sees is spiritual and celestial. But the sensuous in general is of the
external man, here the sensuous of the sight, because this corresponds
and is subordinate to the intellectual; this sensuous sees from the
light of the world, which is from the sun, and all that it sees is
worldly, bodily, and earthly. \[2\] There are in man derivations from
the intellectual part, which is in the light of heaven, down to the
sensuous, which is in the light of the world; unless this were so, the
sensuous could not have any human life. The sensuous of man has no life
in consequence of seeing from the light of the world, for the light of
the world has no life in it; but in consequence of seeing from the light
of heaven, for this light has life in it. When this light falls with man
into those things which are from the light of the world, it vivifies
them and causes him to see objects intellectually, thus as a man; and
from this, by knowledges born from things he has seen and heard in the
world, thus from things that have entered through the senses, man has
intelligence and wisdom, and from these has civil, moral, and spiritual
life. \[3\] As regards the derivations specially, in man they are of
such a nature that they cannot be briefly set forth. They are steps or
degrees as of a ladder between the intellectual part and the sensuous,
but no one can apprehend these degrees unless he knows that they are
most distinct from one another, so distinct that the interior can exist
and subsist without the exterior, but not the exterior without the
interior. For example: the spirit of man can subsist without the
material body, and also actually does so subsist when by death it is
separated from the body. The spirit of man is in an interior degree, and
the body is in an exterior degree. It is similar with the spirit of man
after death: if he is among the blessed, he is in the last degree among
them when in the first heaven, in an interior degree when in the second,
and in the inmost when in the third; and when he is in this, he is
indeed at the same time in the rest, but these are quiescent in him,
almost as the bodily part in man is quiescent in sleep, but with this
difference, that with the angels the interiors are then in the highest
wakefulness. Therefore there are as many distinct degrees in man as
there are heavens, besides the last, which is the body with its sensuous
things. \[4\] From this it may in some measure appear how the case is
with the derivations from first to last, or from the intellectual part
down to the sensuous. The life of man, which is from the Lord's Divine,
passes through these degrees from the inmost down to the last or
ultimate degree, and in each degree it is derived from what is prior,
becoming more and more general, and in the ultimate degree most general.
The derivations in the lower degrees are merely compositions, or rather
combinations \[conformationes\], of the singulars and particulars of the
higher degrees in succession, together with an addition from purer
nature, and then from grosser nature, of such things as may serve for
containing vessels; and if these vessels are decomposed, the singulars
and particulars of the interior degrees, which had been combined
therein, return to the degree next higher. And as with man there is a
connection with the Divine, and his inmost is of such a nature that he
can receive the Divine, and not only receive it, but also make it his
own by acknowledgment and affection, thus by reciprocation, he therefore
can never die, because he has thus been implanted in the Divine, and is
therefore in what is eternal and infinite, not merely through the influx
thence, but also through the reception of it. \[5\] From this it may be
seen how unlearnedly and inanely those think about man who compare him
to the brute animals, and believe that he will not live after death any
more than they-not considering that with the brute animals there is no
reception, nor through acknowledgment and affection any reciprocal
appropriation, of the Divine, and consequent conjunction with it; and
not considering that in consequence of the state of animals being of
this nature, the recipient forms of their life cannot but be dissipated;
for with them the influx passes through their organic forms down into
the world, and there terminates and vanishes, and never returns.

And it was as though it budded. That this signifies the influx by which
the rebirth is effected, is evident from the signification of "budding,"
or producing leaves and afterward blossoms, as being the first of
rebirth. The reason why influx is signified is that when man is being
reborn, spiritual life flows into him, exactly as when a tree is budding
its life flows in through the heat from the sun. He who is born a man is
in the Word occasionally compared to the subjects of the vegetable
kingdom, especially to trees; and this because the whole vegetable
kingdom, as well as the animal kingdom, represents such things as are in
man, and consequently such as are in the Lord's kingdom; for man is a
heaven in the least form, as is evident from what has been shown at the
end of the chapters concerning the correspondence of man with the Grand
Man, or heaven. Hence also the ancients called man a microcosm; and they
might also have called him a little heaven had they known more about the
state of heaven. (That universal nature is a theater representative of
the Lord's kingdom, may be seen above, n. 2758, 3483, 4939.) \[2\] But
it is especially the man who is being born anew, that is, who is being
regenerated by the Lord, who is called a heaven; for he is then
implanted in the Divine good and truth which are from the Lord, and
consequently in heaven. For the man who is being reborn begins like a
tree from seed (and therefore the truth which is from good is signified
by "seed" in the Word); and also like a tree he produces leaves, then
blossoms, and finally fruit; for he produces such things as are of
intelligence, which in the Word are signified by "leaves," then such
things as are of wisdom, which are signified by "blossoms," and finally
such things as are of life, that is, the goods of love and charity in
act, which in the Word are signified by "fruits." Such is the
representative likeness between the fruit-bearing tree and the man who
is being regenerated, insomuch that if anything is known about spiritual
good and truth, the nature of regeneration may be learned from a tree.
From this it is evident that by the "vine" in this dream is
representatively described the full process of the rebirth of man as to
the sensuous subject to the intellectual part; first by the three
shoots, then by the budding, next by the blossoms, afterward by the
ripening of the clusters into grapes, and finally by their being pressed
into Pharaoh's cup and given to him. \[3\] Moreover the dreams which
flow in through heaven from the Lord, never appear otherwise than
according to representatives. He therefore who does not know what this
or that thing in nature represents, and especially he who is quite
unaware that anything is representative, cannot but believe that these
representatives are merely comparisons, such as everyone uses in common
speech. They indeed are comparisons, but such as correspond, and are
therefore actually presented to view in the world of spirits, when the
angels in an interior heaven are conversing about the spiritual and
celestial things of the Lord's kingdom. (In regard to dreams, see above,
n. 1122, 1975, 1977, 1979-1981.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5116.">5116.</span></span>

Its blossom went up. That this signifies the state near regeneration, is
evident from the signification of the "blossom" that buds forth from the
tree before the fruit, as being the state before regeneration. As just
said (n. 5115), the budding and fruiting of a tree represent the rebirth
of man-its becoming green from the leaves represents the first state;
the blossoming the second, which is the next before regeneration; and
the fruiting the third, which is the very state of the regenerate. It is
from this that "leaves" signify the things of intelligence, or the
truths of faith (n. 885), for these are the first things of the rebirth
or regeneration; while "blossoms" signify the things of wisdom, or the
goods of faith, because these immediately precede the rebirth or
regeneration; and "fruits" signify those things which are of life, or
the works of charity, because these follow and constitute the very state
of the regenerate. \[2\] That such things exist in the vegetable kingdom
is owing to the influx of the spiritual world. This, however, cannot be
believed by those who attribute all things to nature, and nothing to the
Divine; whereas they who attribute all things to the Divine, and nothing
to nature, are permitted to see not only that everything is from the
Divine, but also that everything has a correspondence, and is therefore
representative; and finally they are permitted to see that universal
nature is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom; thus that the
Divine is in every particular of nature, insomuch that nature is a
representation of the eternal and the infinite-of the eternal from
propagation even to eternity, of the infinite from the multiplication of
seeds to infinity. Such endeavors could never have existed in everything
in the vegetable kingdom unless the Divine continually flowed in; for
from influx comes endeavor, from endeavor energy, and from energy
effect. \[3\] They who attribute all things to nature say that such
things were imparted to fruits and seeds at their first creation, and
that from the energy thence received they are afterward impelled of
themselves to such activities; but they do not consider that subsistence
is a perpetual coming into existence, or what is similar, that
propagation is perpetual creation; neither do they consider that the
effect is the continuation of the cause, and that when the cause ceases,
the effect also ceases, and consequently that without a continual influx
of the cause, every effect instantly perishes; nor do they consider that
what is unconnected with a first of all things, consequently with the
Divine, is instantly annihilated, because the prior must be continually
in the posterior in order that the posterior may exist. \[4\] If they
who attribute all things to nature and little or nothing to the Divine,
considered these things, they too could acknowledge that each and all
things in nature represent such things as are in the spiritual world,
consequently such as are in the Lord's kingdom, where the Divine of the
Lord is most nearly represented. For this reason it was said that the
influx is from the spiritual world; but it is meant that the influx is
through the spiritual world from the Lord's Divine. The reason why
natural men do not consider such things is that they are not willing to
acknowledge them; for they are in earthly and bodily things, and hence
in a life of the love of self and of the world, and therefore are in
inverted order relatively to those things which are of the spiritual
world or of heaven, and from an inverted state it is impossible to see
such things; for they see the things which are below as if they were
above, and the things which are above as if they were below; and
therefore when in the other life such persons are seen in the light of
heaven, they appear with the head downward and the feet upward. \[5\]
Who among them is there that sees trees and other plants in blossom, and
deems that this is as it were their gladness because they are now
producing fruits or seeds? They see that blossoms precede, and that they
last until they have in their bosoms the beginnings of the fruit or
seed, and thereby convey into these beginnings their sap; and if they
knew anything about the rebirth or regeneration of man (or rather, if
they desired to know), they would from this likeness see in the flowers
a representative of the state of man before regeneration, namely, that
man then blossoms in like manner from the good of intelligence and
wisdom, that is, is in interior gladness and beauty, because he is then
in the effort to implant in the life the goods of intelligence and
wisdom, that is, to produce fruits. That this state is of such a nature
cannot even be known, because the nature of the interior gladness and
beauty which are thus represented is utterly unknown to those who are
solely in the gladness of the love of the world and the delights of the
love of self. This gladness and these delights cause those which are
interior to appear to such persons so utterly joyless and undelightful
that they hold them in aversion; and the result of this is that they
reject them as trivial, or of no value, and therefore deny them, and at
the same time deny that what is spiritual and celestial is anything.
From this comes the insanity of the present age, which is believed to be
wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5117.">5117.</span></span>

And the clusters thereof ripened grapes. That this signifies the
conjunction of spiritual truth with celestial good, is evident from the
signification of "ripening," as being the progress of rebirth or
regeneration even to the conjunction of truth with good, and thus
conjunction; and from the signification of "clusters," as being the
truth of spiritual good; and from the signification of "grapes," as
being the good of celestial truth; here both of these in that sensuous
which is represented by the butler. The conjunction of these in the
sensuous is similar to the ripening of clusters into grapes; for in the
rebirth, or regeneration, all truth tends to conjunction with good,
truth not receiving life previously to such conjunction, consequently
not being made fruitful. This is represented in the fruits of trees when
they are ripening. In unripe fruits, which here are the "clusters," is
represented the state when truth still predominates; but in the ripe
fruits, which are the "grapes," is represented the state when good has
the predominance, the predominance of good being represented also in the
flavor and sweetness which are perceived in ripe grapes. But concerning
the conjunction of truth with good in the sensuous which is subject to
the intellectual part, further particulars cannot be given, for they are
secrets too deep for apprehension, and it is necessary for knowledges
about the state of the celestial of the spiritual, and about this
sensuous, to come first, and also about the state of the natural in
which this conjunction comes into existence. \[2\] That "grapes" signify
the good of the spiritual man, thus charity, is evident from many
passages in the Word; as in Isaiah: My well beloved had a vineyard in a
horn of the son of oil; he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and
it brought forth wild grapes (Isa. 5:1-2, 4); where a "vineyard" denotes
the spiritual church; his "looking that it should bring forth grapes"
denotes the goods of charity; and its "bringing forth wild grapes" the
evils of hatred and revenge. \[3\] Again: Thus hath said Jehovah, As the
new wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a
blessing is in it (Isa. 65:8); the "new wine in the cluster" denotes
truth from good in the natural. \[4\] In Jeremiah: Gathering I will
gather them, saith Jehovah; no grapes in the vine, nor figs in the fig
tree (Jer. 8:13); there being "no grapes in the vine" denotes that there
is no interior or rational good, and "no figs in the fig tree" that
there is no exterior or natural good; for a "vine" is the intellectual
part (as shown just above, n. 5113); and when the conjunction of truth
and good is therein, a "vine" is the rational, for the rational is
thence. (That a "fig tree" is the good of the natural or exterior man
may be seen above, n. 217.) \[5\] In Hosea: I found Israel like grapes
in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig tree
in its beginning (Hos. 9:10); "grapes in the wilderness" denote rational
good not yet made spiritual; the "first-ripe in the fig tree" denotes
natural good in like manner; "Israel" denotes the ancient spiritual
church in its beginning ("fathers" in this and other passages not being
the sons of Jacob, but those with whom the Ancient Church was first set
up). \[6\] In Micah: There is no cluster to eat; my soul desired the
first-ripe. The holy is perished out of the earth, and there is none
upright among men (Micah 12:1-2); the "cluster to eat" denotes the good
of charity in its beginning; "the first-ripe" the truth of faith also at
that time. \[7\] In Amos: Behold the days come that the ploughman shall
reach the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that draweth the seed;
and the mountains shall drop new wine, and all the hills shall melt. And
I will bring back the captivity of My people, and they shall build the
waste cities, and inhabit them; and shall settle and plant vineyards,
and drink the wine thereof; and they shall make clusters, and eat the
fruit of them (Amos 9:13-14); it treats here of the setting up of a
spiritual church, which is thus described-the conjunction of spiritual
good with its truth by the "ploughman reaching the reaper"; and the
conjunction of spiritual truth with its good by the "treader of grapes
reaching him that draweth the seed"; the goods of love and charity
therefrom are signified by the "mountains dropping new wine and the
hills melting"; "bringing back the captivity of the people" denotes
deliverance from falsities; "building the waste cities" denotes
rectifying the falsified doctrinals of truth; "inhabiting them and
planting vineyards" denotes cultivating those things which are of the
spiritual church; "drinking the wine thereof" appropriating the truths
of that church which are of charity; and "making clusters and eating the
fruit of them" appropriating the goods thence derived. Everyone can see
that "building cities," "planting vineyards," "drinking wine," "making
clusters," and "eating the fruit of them" are merely natural things, in
which there would be nothing Divine unless they contained a spiritual
sense. \[8\] In Moses: He hath washed his clothing in wine, and his
covering in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11); speaking of the Lord;
"wine" denotes spiritual good from the Divine love; the "blood of
grapes" celestial good therefrom. \[9\] Again: Butter of the herd, and
milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs and of rams the sons of Bashan,
and of he-goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and the blood of the
grape thou drinkest unmixed (Deut. 32:14); speaking of the Ancient
Church, whose goods of love and charity are thus described, and each
expression signifies some specific good: the "blood of the grape"
spiritual celestial good, the Divine in heaven proceeding from the Lord
being so called. Wine is called the "blood of grapes" because both
expressions signify holy truth proceeding from the Lord; but "wine" is
predicated of the spiritual church, and "blood" of the celestial church,
and for this reason wine was enjoined in the Holy Supper. \[10\] Again:
Their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah; the
grapes thereof are grapes of gall, they have clusters of bitternesses
(Deut. 32:32); speaking of the Jewish Church, their "vine being of the
vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah" denotes the intellectual
part beset by falsities from infernal love; "the grapes thereof grapes
of gall" and "their having clusters of bitternesses" denotes that it was
similar with the will part therein. For as in a good sense a "grape"
signifies charity, it is predicated of the will part, but of the will
part within the intellectual part; and similarly in the opposite sense,
because all truth is of the understanding and all good is of the will.
\[11\] In Revelation: The angel said, Put forth thy sharp sickle, and
gather the clusters of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe (Rev.
14:18); "to gather the clusters of the earth" denotes to destroy all
things of charity. \[12\] In Matthew: By their fruits ye shall know
them. Do they gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? (Matt.
7:16). And in Luke: Every tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns
they do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush do they gather the grape
(Luke 6:44). As charity toward the neighbor is treated of in these
passages, it is said that they should be "known by their fruits" which
are the goods of charity; the internal goods of charity being "grapes"
and the external "figs." \[13\] The law enacted in the Jewish Church:
When thou comest into thy companion's vineyard, then thou mayest eat
grapes according to thy soul, to thy fill; but thou shalt not put any in
thy vessel (Deut. 23:24); involves that everyone associating with others
who are in a different doctrine and religion may learn and accept their
goods of charity, but may not become imbued with them and conjoin them
with his own truths. As a "vineyard" denotes the church, it denotes
where there is doctrine or religion; "grapes" are the goods of charity;
and a "vessel" is the truth of the church.

And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand. That this signifies the influx of the
interior natural into the exterior, and the beginning of reception, is
evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the interior
natural (of which above, n. 5080, 5095); and from the representation of
the butler, as being the exterior natural (n. 5077, 5082); "in my hand"
meaning with him; and from the signification of a "cup," as being that
which contains, and also at the same time that which is contained (of
which in what follows, n. 5120). Hence, and from the series of things in
the internal sense, by "Pharaoh's cup was in my hand" is signified the
influx of the interior natural into the exterior, and the beginning of
reception therein. What the interior natural is, and what the exterior,
has been stated above, namely, that the interior natural is that which
communicates with the rational and into which the rational flows, and
the exterior natural is that which communicates with the senses, or
through them with the world, thus into which the world flows. As regards
influx, it is continuous from the Lord through the rational into the
interior natural, and through this into the exterior; but that which
flows in is changed and turned according to the reception. With the
unregenerate, goods are there turned into evils, and truths into
falsities; but with the regenerate, goods and truths are there presented
as in a mirror. For the natural is like a face representative of the
spiritual things of the internal man; and this face becomes
representative when the exteriors correspond to the interiors. From this
it may in some measure appear what is meant by the influx of the
interior natural into the exterior, and by the beginning of reception
therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5119.">5119.</span></span>

And I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup. That this
signifies reciprocal influx into the goods from a spiritual origin
there, is evident from the signification of "grapes," as being the goods
of charity (of which just above, n. 5117), thus goods from a spiritual
origin, for all the goods of genuine charity are from this source; and
from the signification of "pressing into Pharaoh's cup," as being
reciprocal influx. By reciprocal influx it is not meant that the
exterior natural flows into the interior, because this is impossible;
for exterior things cannot possibly flow into interior things; or what
is the same thing, lower or posterior things into higher and prior ones;
but the rational calls forth the things which are in the interior
natural, and by means of this the things which are in the exterior; not
that the things themselves which are therein are called forth, but that
which has been concluded or as it were extracted from them. Such is the
nature of reciprocal influx. It appears as if the things which are in
the world flow in through the senses toward the interiors, but this is a
fallacy of sense; the influx is of interiors into exteriors, and by
means of this influx, perception. On these subjects I have at times
conversed with spirits; and it was shown by living experience that the
interior man sees and perceives in the exterior what is done outside of
this, and that the sensuous has life from no other source, or that from
no other source is the faculty of sense, or sensation. But this fallacy
is of such a nature, and so great, that it can by no means be dispelled
by the natural man, and not even by the rational unless this is able to
think abstractedly from what is sensuous. These things are said in order
that it may be known what reciprocal influx is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5120.">5120.</span></span>

And I gave the cup upon the palm of Pharaoh. That this signifies
appropriation by the interior natural, is evident from the signification
of "giving the cup" (thus wine to drink), as being to appropriate (that
"drinking" is the appropriation of truth may be seen above, n. 3168);
and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the interior natural
(n. 5080, 5095, 5118). As is evident from what goes before, the subject
here treated of is the regeneration of that sensuous which is subject to
the intellectual part of the interior man (which sensuous is signified
by the "butler"), and consequently the influx of truth and good and
their reception in the exterior natural; but as these things are far
removed from the apprehension of those who have not any distinct idea
about the rational and the natural, or about influx, no further
explication is given. \[2\] Moreover, a "cup" is often mentioned in the
Word, and by it in the genuine sense is signified spiritual truth, that
is, the truth of faith which is from the good of charity-the same as by
"wine;" and in the opposite sense is signified the falsity by which
comes evil, and also falsity from evil. That a "cup" signifies the same
as "wine" is because a cup is what contains, and wine is what is
contained, and hence they constitute one thing, and therefore the one is
meant by the other. \[3\] That such is the signification of "cup" in the
Word, is plain from the following passages: Jehovah, Thou wilt set in
order a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; Thou wilt make
fat my head with oil; my cup will run over (Ps. 23:5); "to set in order
a table and anoint the head with oil" denotes being gifted with the good
of charity and love; "my cup will run over" denotes that the natural is
thence filled with spiritual truth and good. Again: What shall I render
unto Jehovah? I will take the cup of salvations, and call upon the name
of Jehovah (Ps. 116:12-13); "to take the cup of salvations" denotes the
appropriation of the goods of faith. \[4\] In Mark: Whosoever shall give
you drink in a cup of water in My name, because ye are Christ's, verily
I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward (Mark 9:41); "to give drink
in a cup of water in My name" denotes instructing in the truths of faith
from a little charity. \[5\] In Matthew: Presently, taking the cup, and
giving thanks, He gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is
My blood, that of the New Testament (Matt. 26:27-28; Mark 14:23- 24;
Luke 22:20). It is said the "cup" and not the "wine," because "wine" is
predicated of the spiritual church, but "blood" of the celestial church,
although both of these signify holy truth proceeding from the Lord; but
in the spiritual church the holy of faith from charity toward the
neighbor, and in the celestial church the holy of charity from love to
the Lord. The spiritual church is distinguished from the celestial in
this, that the former is in charity toward the neighbor, while the
latter is in love to the Lord; and the Holy Supper was instituted to
represent and signify the Lord's love toward the whole human race, and
the reciprocal love of man toward Him. \[6\] As by "cup" was signified
that which contained, and by "wine" that which was contained,
consequently by "cup" man's external, and by "wine" his internal,
therefore the Lord said: Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites! For ye cleanse the outside of the cup and of the platter,
but the inner parts are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind
Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, and
the outside will also become clean (Matt. 23:25-26; Luke 11:39); by a
"cup" here also is meant in the internal sense the truth of faith, to
cultivate which without its good is to "cleanse the outside of the cup,"
especially when the interiors are full of hypocrisy, deceit, hatred,
revenge, and cruelty; for then the truth of faith is only in the
external man, and nothing at all of it is in the internal; and to
cultivate and to become imbued with the good of faith causes truths to
be conjoined with good in the interior man, in which case even fallacies
are accepted as truths, as is signified by "cleansing first the inside
of the cup, and the outside will also become clean." \[7\] Likewise in
Mark: Many other things there are which the Pharisees and the Jews have
received to hold, as the baptizings of cups, and pots, brazen vessels,
and couches. Forsaking the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
men, as the baptisms of pots and cups; and many other like things ye do.
Ye renounce the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition
(Mark 7:4, 8-9). \[8\] That by "cup" is signified in the opposite sense
that falsity from which is evil, and also the falsity which is from
evil, is evident from the following passages: Thus hath said Jehovah the
God of Israel unto me, Take this cup of wine of anger from My hand, and
cause all the nations to whom I send thee to drink it. And they shall
drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will
send among them. Therefore I took the cup from Jehovah's hand, and made
all the nations to drink unto whom Jehovah had sent me (Jer. 25:15-17,
28); the "cup of wine of anger" denotes the falsity by which is evil.
The reason why the falsity by which is evil is signified, is that as
wine intoxicates and makes insane, so does falsity, spiritual
intoxication being nothing else than insanity brought on by reasonings
about what is to be believed, when nothing is believed that is not
apprehended; hence come falsities, and from falsities evils (n. 1072);
and therefore it is said that "they shall drink, and reel to and fro,
and be mad, because of the sword that I will send." The "sword" is
falsity fighting against truth (see n. 2799, 4499). \[9\] In the book of
Lamentations: Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in
the land of Uz; the cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be
drunken and shalt be uncovered (Lam. 4:21); "to be drunken from the
cup," denotes to be insane from falsities, and "to be uncovered, or
naked, without shame," the evil thence derived (see n. 213, 214). \[10\]
In Ezekiel: Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore I will
give her cup into thy hand. Thus hath said the Lord Jehovih, Thou shalt
drink of thy sister's cup, which is deep and wide; thou shalt be for
laughter and mockery, large for holding; thou shalt be filled with
drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of devastation and desolation, the
cup of thy sister Samaria, thou shalt both drink and press out, and thou
shalt pulverize the potsherds thereof (Ezek. 23:31-34); said of
Jerusalem, by which is signified what is spiritual of the celestial
church. "Cup" here denotes falsity from evil; and because this vastates
or destroys the church, it is called the "cup of devastation and
desolation." In Isaiah: Awake, awake, rise up, O Jerusalem, who hast
drunk from the hand of Jehovah the cup of His anger; thou hast drunken
the dregs of the cup of trembling (Isa. 51:17). In Habakkuk: Drink thou
also that thy foreskin be uncovered; the cup of Jehovah's right hand
shall come round unto thee, that shameful vomit be upon thy glory (Hab.
2:16). In David: In the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and He hath
mixed with wine, He hath filled with the mixture, and hath poured out
therefrom; but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall suck
them out, and drink them (Ps. 75:8). \[11\] In these passages also a
"cup" denotes insanity from falsities and the evils thence derived. It
is called the "cup of the anger of Jehovah," and also "of the right hand
of Jehovah," for the reason that the Jewish nation, like the common
people, believed evils and the punishment of evils and falsities to come
from no other source than Jehovah, when yet they are from the man
himself, and from the infernal crew with him. It is often stated in this
way from the appearance and consequent belief; but the internal sense
teaches how it should be understood, and what should be believed (as may
be seen above, n. 245, 592, 696, 1093, 1683, 1874, 1875, 2335, 2447,
3605, 3607, 3614). \[12\] As a "cup," like "wine," signifies in the
opposite sense the falsities through which come evils, and also
falsities from evils, a "cup" signifies temptation also, because this
takes place when falsity fights against truth, and consequently evil
against good. A "cup" is used to express and describe temptation in the
following passage: Jesus prayed, saying, If Thou wilt that this cup pass
from Me! nevertheless not My will, but Thine, be done (Luke 22:42; Matt.
26:39, 42, 44; Mark 14:36); the "cup" here denotes temptation. Likewise
in John: Jesus said to Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath; the cup
which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it? (John 18:11). And
also in Mark: Jesus said to James and John, Ye know not what ye ask; can
ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism
that I am baptized with? And they said, We can. But Jesus said to them,
Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism
that I am baptized with shall ye be baptized (Mark 10:38-39; Matt.
20:22-23). From this it is evident that a "cup" is temptation, because
temptation arises through evils combating by means of falsities against
goods and truths; for baptism signifies regeneration, and because this
is effected by means of spiritual combats, therefore by "baptism" is at
the same time signified temptation. \[13\] In the directly opposite
sense a "cup" signifies falsity from evil with those who are profane,
that is, who inwardly are in what is contrary to charity, and outwardly
counterfeit holiness; in which sense it is used in Jeremiah: Babylon
hath been a golden cup in Jehovah's hand, making the whole earth
drunken; all nations have drunk of her wine, therefore the nations are
mad (Jer. 51:7); "Babylon" denotes those who are in external sanctity,
and inwardly in what is profane (n. 1182, 1326); the falsity which they
veil over with sanctity is the "golden cup;" "making the whole earth
drunken" denotes that they lead those who are of the church (which is
meant by the "earth") into errors and insanities. The profane things
which they hide under external sanctity are that they strive after
nothing else than to be the greatest and wealthiest of all, and to be
worshiped as gods, possessors of heaven and earth, by thus having
dominion over the souls and bodies of men, and this by means of the
Divine and holy things of which they make pretense. Hence as to the
external man they appear like angels, but as to the internal they are
devils. \[14\] The like is said of Babylon in Revelation The woman was
arrayed in crimson and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stone
and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and
filthiness of her whoredom (Rev. 17:4). Again: Babylon the great is
fallen, is fallen, and is become a habitation of demons. For all nations
have drunk of the wine of the fury of her whoredom, and the kings of the
earth have committed whoredom with her. I heard a voice from heaven,
saying, Render unto her as she rendered unto you, in the cup which she
mingled, mingle to her double (Rev. 18:2-4, 6). Again: The great city
was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell;
remembrance of Babylon the great was made before God, to give to her the
cup of the fury of God's anger (Rev. 16:19). Again: The third angel said
with a great voice, If anyone worship the beast and his image, he shall
drink of the wine of God's anger mingled unmixed in the cup of His
anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone (Rev. 14:9-10).

And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it. That this
signifies revelation from perception from the celestial in the natural
as to what it had in itself, is evident from the signification of
"saying" in the historic parts of the Word, as being perception (n.
1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3395, 3509), here
revelation from perception, because said of a dream and its
interpretation - all revelation being either from speech with angels
through whom the Lord speaks, or from perception (of which hereafter);
and from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial in the
natural (of which above, n. 5086, 5087, 5106); and from the
signification of "interpretation," as being what it had in itself (of
which also above, n. 5093, 5105, 5107). From this it is plain that by
"Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it" is signified
revelation from perception from the celestial in the natural as to what
it had in itself. \[2\] In regard to revelations being either from
perception, or from speech with angels through whom the Lord speaks, it
is to be known that they who are in good and thence in truth, and
especially they who are in the good of love to the Lord, have revelation
from perception; whereas they who are not in good and thence in truth,
can indeed have revelations, yet not from perception, but through a
living voice heard within them, and thus through angels from the Lord.
This revelation is external, but the former is internal. The angels,
especially the celestial, have revelation from perception, as also had
the men of the Most Ancient Church, and some too of the Ancient Church,
but scarcely anyone at this day; whereas very many, even those who have
not been in good, have had revelations from speech without perception,
and also by means of visions or dreams. \[3\] Such were most of the
revelations of the prophets in the Jewish Church; they heard a voice,
they saw a vision, and they dreamed a dream; but as they had no
perception, these were merely verbal or visual revelations without any
perception of what they signified. For genuine perception comes through
heaven from the Lord, and affects the intellect spiritually, and leads
it perceptibly to think as the thing really is, together with internal
assent, the source of which it knows not. It supposes that it is in
itself, and that it flows from the connection of things; whereas it is a
dictate through heaven from the Lord, flowing into the interiors of the
thought, about such things as are above the natural and sensuous, that
is, about such things as are of the spiritual world or of heaven. From
what has now been said it may be seen what revelation from perception
is. But the revelation from perception which the Lord had (who is here
represented by Joseph, and which revelation is here treated of in the
internal sense), was from the Divine in Himself, thus was from Himself.

The three shoots three days are these. That this signifies continuous
derivations down to the last or ultimate one, is evident from the
signification of "three," as being one period and its continuation from
beginning to end (n. 2788, 4495); from the signification of "shoots," as
being derivations (n. 5114); and from the signification of "days," as
being states (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850). From
this it follows that by "the three shoots three days are these" is
signified the state of the rebirth of this sensuous which is represented
by the butler, from its first down to its ultimate; its successive
derivations being signified by the "shoots." \[2\] The states of the
rebirth of each sensuous, and of each thing in the natural, and also in
the rational, have their progressions from beginning to end; and when
they come to the end they commence from a kind of new beginning, that
is, from the end to which they had striven in the former state, to a
further end; and so on; and at last the order is inverted, and then what
was last becomes first, just as while man is being regenerated both as
to the rational and as to the natural, the periods of the first state
are from the truths which are of faith to the goods which are of
charity; and then the truths of faith apparently act the first part, and
the goods of charity the second, for the truths of faith look to the
good of charity as their end. These periods continue even until the man
has been regenerated. Afterward charity, which was the end, becomes the
beginning, and from it new states commence, which proceed in both
directions, namely, toward what is still more interior, and also toward
what is exterior; toward the former being toward love to the Lord, and
toward the latter being toward the truths of faith, and further toward
natural truths, and also toward sensuous truths, which are then
successively reduced to correspondence with the goods of charity and of
love in the rational, and thus into heavenly order. \[3\] These are the
things which are meant by continuous progressions and derivations down
to the ultimate one. Such progressions and derivations with the man who
is being regenerated are perpetual, from his infancy even to the last
hour of his life in the world, and also afterward even to eternity; and
yet he can never be so regenerated that he can in any way be said to be
perfect; for there are things to be regenerated that are innumerable,
nay, illimitable in number, both in the rational and in the natural, and
everyone of them has shoots illimitable, that is, progressions and
derivations toward interior things and toward exterior things. Man knows
nothing at all of this; but the Lord knows all things and every single
thing, and provides for them every moment. If He were to pause even for
an instant, all the progressions would be disturbed; for what is prior
looks to what follows in a continuous series, and produces series of
consequences to eternity. From this it is plain that the Divine
foresight and providence are in everything, even the very least; and
that unless this were so, or if they were only universal, the human race
would perish.

In yet three days. That this signifies that there would then be a new
state, is evident from the signification of "three," as being what is
continuous even to the end, thus what is complete (n. 2788, 4495); and
from the signification of "days," as being states (of which above, n.
5122). From this it is plain that by "three days" is signified a
complete state; consequently, "in three days," or "after three days,"
denotes a new state (n. 4091); for after a complete state a new one
begins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5124.">5124.</span></span>

Shall Pharaoh lift up thy head. That this signifies what is provided,
and therefore what is concluded, is evident from the signification of
"lifting up the head," as being to conclude, and in the supreme sense to
provide; for the Divine conclusion, and execution of a thing concluded,
is providence. "To lift up the head" was a customary form of passing
sentence among the ancients, when the bound, or those in prison were
adjudged either to life or to death; when to life, this was expressed by
"lifting up the head," as in the second book of Kings: Evil-merodach
king of Babylon, in the year that he was made king, did lift up the head
of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of the prison house, and spake good to
him, and set his throne above the thrones of the kings that were with
him in Babylon (2 Kings 25:27-28). So in Jeremiah: Evil-merodach king of
Babylon, in the \[first\] year of his reign, lifted up the head of
Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of the prison house
(Jer. 52:31). But when they were adjudged to death, it was expressed by
"lifting up the head from off him," as in what follows concerning the
baker: "In yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee"
(verse 19). \[2\] This form of sentence had its origin among the
ancients who were in representatives, from the representation of those
who were bound in prison or in a pit; and as by these were represented
those who were in vastation under the lower earth (n. 4728, 4744, 5038),
therefore by "lifting up their head" was signified their liberation, for
they are then elevated or lifted up out of vastation to the heavenly
societies (n. 2699, 2701, 2704). "To be lifted up" or "to be elevated"
is to advance toward the interior things; for what is elevated or high
is predicated of these (n. 2148, 4210); and because it is toward
interior things it is toward heaven, for heaven is in the interior
things. This was signified by "lifting up the head." But by "lifting the
head from off" anyone was signified to adjudge him to death, because
then those who were above those in the pit, or in vastation, were
elevated to heaven, while the others were let down to lower depths.
Because of this signification, therefore, this form of sentence was
received in the Word. It is hence plain that by "lifting up the head" is
signified what is concluded; and because what is concluded is signified,
in the supreme sense is signified what is provided; for what the Divine
concludes, this it provides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5125.">5125.</span></span>

And shall bring thee back upon thy station. That this signifies that the
things which are of the sensuous subject to the intellectual part would
be reduced into order, that they might be in the last place, is evident
from the representation of the butler, of whom these things are said, as
being the sensuous subject to the intellectual part (n. 5077, 5082),
consequently the things of this sensuous in the external natural, for
the sensuous itself is not reduced into order, but those things which
have entered through it into man's fantasy; and from the signification
of "bringing back upon the station," as being to reduce into order; and
because sensuous things (that is, those which have entered from the
world through the external organs of sensation) are in the last place,
and are in the last place when they minister and are subservient to
interior things, therefore these are at the same time signified.
Moreover, with the regenerate these sensuous things are in the last
place; but with the unregenerate are in the first place (n. 5077, 5081,
5084, 5089, 5094). \[2\] Whether sensuous things are in the first or
last place can easily be perceived by man if he pays attention. If he
sanctions everything to which the sensuous prompts or which it craves,
and disapproves of everything that the intellectual part dictates, then
sensuous things are in the first place, and the man is governed by the
appetites, and is wholly sensuous. Such a man is but little removed from
the condition of irrational animals, for they are governed in the same
way; nay, he is in a worse condition if he abuses the intellectual or
rational faculty to confirm the evils and falsities to which sensuous
things prompt and which they crave. But if he does not sanction them,
but from within sees how they stray into falsities and incite to evils,
and strives to chasten them and thus reduce them to compliance (that is,
subject them to the intellectual and will parts which are of the
interior man), then sensuous things are reduced into order, that they
may be in the last place. When sensuous things are in the last place, a
happy and blessed feeling flows from the interior man into the delights
of these things, and increases them a thousandfold. The sensuous man
does not believe that this is so, because he does not comprehend it; and
as he is sensible of no other delight than sensuous delight, and thinks
there is no higher delight, he regards as of no account the happy and
blessed feeling which is within the delights of sensuous things; for
whatever is unknown to anyone is believed not to be.

And thou shalt give Pharaoh's cup into his hand. That this signifies
that thereby they may serve the interior natural, is evident from the
signification of "giving a cup to drink," as being to appropriate (n.
5120); that it is also to serve is plain; and from the representation of
Pharaoh, as being the interior natural (n. 5080, 5095, 5118). That there
is an interior natural and also an exterior natural, and that the
exterior natural is constituted of what enters immediately through the
senses from the world into the natural mind, namely, into its memory and
thence into the imagination, may be seen above (n. 5118). \[2\] In order
that it may be known what is the exterior and what the interior natural,
which are of the exterior man; and hence what is the rational, which is
of the interior man, this must be briefly told. A man from his infancy
even to childhood is merely sensuous, for he then receives only earthly,
bodily and worldly things through the senses of the body, and from these
things his ideas and thoughts are then formed - the communication with
the interior man not being as yet open, or only so far that he can
comprehend and retain these worldly things. The innocence which he then
has is only external, and not internal; for true innocence dwells in
wisdom. By external innocence the Lord reduces into order what enters
through the senses; and without an influx of innocence from the Lord in
that first age, there would never be any foundation upon which the
intellectual or rational faculty which is proper to man, could be built.
\[3\] From childhood to early youth communication is opened with the
interior natural by learning what is becoming, what the civil laws
require, and what is honorable, both by instructions from parents and
teachers and by studies. And from youth to early manhood communication
is opened between the natural and the rational by learning the truths
and goods of civil and moral life, and especially the truths and goods
of spiritual life, through the hearing and reading of the Word; but
insofar as the youth then becomes imbued with goods by means of truths,
that is, insofar as he does the truths which he learns, so far the
rational is opened; whereas insofar as he does not become imbued with
goods by means of truths, or insofar as he does not do truths, so far
the rational is not opened, and yet the knowledges still remain in the
natural, namely, in its memory, and thus as it were on the threshold
outside the house. \[4\] Insofar, however, as he then and in subsequent
years disregards goods and truths, and denies and acts contrary to them,
that is, instead of them believes falsities and does evils, so far the
rational is closed, and also the interior natural; nevertheless of the
Lord's Divine providence so much of communication still remains as to
enable him to apprehend goods and truths with some degree of
understanding, yet not to make them his own unless he performs serious
repentance and for a long while afterward struggles with falsities and
evils. With those, however, who suffer themselves to be regenerated, the
contrary comes to pass; for by degrees or successively the rational is
opened in them, and to this the interior natural is made subordinate,
and to this the exterior natural. This takes place especially in youth
up to adult age, and progressively to the last years of their life, and
afterward in heaven to eternity. From all this it may be known what is
the interior and what the exterior natural in man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5127.">5127.</span></span>

After the former manner. That this signifies in accordance with the law
of order is evident from the signification of the "former manner," as
being the law of order; for it is a law of order that exterior things
should be subject to interior things, or what is the same, lower things
to higher ones, and should serve them as servants; for exterior or lower
things are nothing but servants, while interior or higher things are
relatively lords. That such is the signification of the words "after the
former manner" is because the butler as a servant had previously served
Pharaoh as his lord, in accordance with the law of subordination; thus
the sensuous represented by the butler had served the interior natural
represented by Pharaoh, in accordance with the law of order. \[2\] That
it is the law of order that lower or exterior things should serve higher
or interior things, is wholly unknown to the sensuous man; for one who
is merely sensuous does not know what interior is, thus neither what is
relatively exterior. He knows that he thinks and speaks, and that he
wills and acts; and from this he supposes that to think and to will are
interior, and that to speak and to act are exterior; but he does not
know that to think from the senses only, and to act from the appetites,
is of the external man, thus that his thinking and willing are solely of
the exterior natural, and that this is still more the case when he
thinks falsities and wills evils; and because in such persons the
communication with interior things is closed, he therefore does not know
what interior thought and will are. If he is told that interior thought
is to think from truth, and that interior will is to act from good, he
does not at all apprehend it; still less that the interior man is
distinct from the exterior, and so distinct that the interior man can
see as from a higher position what is going on in the exterior man, and
that the interior man has the capacity and ability of chastening the
exterior, and of not willing and thinking what the exterior man sees
from phantasy, and desires from cupidity. \[3\] These things he does not
see so long as his external man has dominion and rules; but when he is
out of this state, as when he is in some depression arising from
misfortunes or illness, he can see and apprehend these things, because
then the dominion of the external man ceases. For the faculty or ability
of understanding is always preserved to man by the Lord, but is very
obscure with those who are in falsities and evils, and is always clearer
in proportion as falsities and evils are lulled to sleep. The Lord's
Divine flows in continually with man and enlightens him, but where there
are falsities and evils (that is, where there are things contrary to
truths and goods), the Divine light is either reflected or suffocated or
perverted, and only so much of it is received, as it were through
chinks, as to give him the faculty of thinking and speaking from
sensuous things, and also of thinking and speaking of spiritual things
from forms of speech impressed on the natural or bodily memory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5128.">5128.</span></span>

When thou wast his butler. That this signifies as is usual with sensuous
things of this kind, is evident from the signification of a "butler," as
being sensuous things, or that portion of them which is subject to the
intellectual part (see n. 5077, 5082); its being "as is usual" with them
is signified by "when thou wast." That sensuous things ought to be
subject and subordinate to rational things has already been treated of
in the preceding pages; and as this subjection and subordination is here
treated of in the internal sense, it still remains to show how the case
is in regard to it. \[2\] The man in whom sensuous things are in
subjection is called rational, but the man in whom they are not in
subjection is called sensuous; but whether a man is rational or sensuous
can scarcely be discerned by others; but it can be discerned by himself
if he explores his interiors, that is, his will and his thought. Whether
a man is sensuous or rational cannot be known by others from his speech
or from his actions; for the life of the thought which is in the speech,
and the life of the will which is in the actions, do not appear to any
bodily sense. Only the sound is heard and the gesture seen together with
their affection, and it is not distinguished whether the affection is
pretended or real; but in the other life this is distinctly perceived by
those who are in good, both as to what is in the speech and what is in
the actions; thus what is the quality of the life, and also from what
source the life therein is derived. In this world also there are some
signs from which it can in some measure be inferred whether sensuous
things are subject to the rational, or the rational to sensuous things,
or what is the same, whether a man is rational or merely sensuous. The
signs are these. If it is observed that a man is in principles of
falsity, and does not suffer himself to be enlightened, but entirely
rejects truths, and without reason obstinately defends falsities, this
is a sign that he is a sensuous man, and not a rational, the rational
being closed in him, so that it does not admit the light of heaven.
\[3\] Still more sensuous are those who are in the persuasion of
falsity, because the persuasion of falsity totally closes the rational.
It is one thing to be in principles of falsity, and another to be in the
persuasion of falsity. They who are in the persuasion of falsity have
some light in their natural, but it is a light like that of winter. In
the other life this light appears with them white like snow; but as soon
as the heavenly light falls into it, it is darkened, and becomes dark
like night in accordance with the degree and quality of the persuasion.
This is also evident with them while they live in the world, for they
cannot then see anything whatever of truth; nay, in consequence of the
obscure or benighted influence of their falsity, truths to them are as
things of naught, and they also ridicule them. To the simple such
persons sometimes appear as if they were rational; for by means of that
snowy wintry light they can through reasonings so dexterously confirm
falsities, that these appear like truths. In such persuasion are many of
the learned, more than the rest of mankind; for they have confirmed
falsities in themselves by syllogistic and philosophical reasonings, and
finally by many acquired knowledges. Among the ancients such men were
called serpents of the tree of knowledge (see n. 195-197); but at this
day they may be called interior sensuous men who have no rational. \[4\]
The principal sign whether a man is merely sensuous or is rational, is
from his life; not such as appears in his speech and his works, but such
as it is within these; for the life of the speech is from the thought,
and the life of the works is from the will, and that of both is from the
intention or end. Such therefore as is the intention or end within the
speech and the works, such is the life; for speech without interior life
is mere sound, and works without interior life are mere movements. This
is the life which is meant when it is said that "the life remains after
death." If a man is rational, he speaks from thinking well, and acts
from willing well, that is, he speaks from faith and acts from charity;
but if a man is not rational, he may then indeed begin to act, and also
to speak, as a rational man; but still there is nothing of life from the
rational in him; for a life of evil closes up every way or communication
with the rational, and causes the man to be merely natural and sensuous.
\[5\] There are two things which not only close up the way of
communication, but even deprive a man of the capacity of ever becoming
rational - deceit and profanation. Deceit is like a subtle poison which
infects the interiors, and profanation mixes falsities with truths and
evils with goods: through these two the rational wholly perishes. There
are in every man gods and truths from the Lord stored up from infancy,
which in the Word are called "remains" (see n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 661,
1050, 1738, 1906, 2284); these remains are infected by deceit, and are
mixed up by profanation (what profanation is may be seen above, n. 593,
1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426, 3398, 3402, 3489, 3898, 4289,
4601). From these signs it may in some measure be known who is a
rational, and who a sensuous man. \[6\] When sensuous things are subject
to the rational, then the sensuous things from which man's first
imagination is formed, are enlightened by the light which comes through
heaven from the Lord, and are also disposed into order so as to receive
the light and correspond. When they are in this state, sensuous things
no longer stand in the way of truths being acknowledged and seen, those
which disagree being instantly removed, and those which agree being
accepted. Those which agree are then as it were in the center, and those
which disagree are in the circumference; those which are in the center
are as it were lifted up toward heaven, and those which are in the
circumference as it were hang downward. Those which are in the center
receive light through the rational, and when they are presented to view
in the other life they are seen as little stars which gleam and shed
light round about even to the circumference, with a gradual diminution.
Into such a form are natural and sensuous things disposed when the
rational has dominion, and sensuous things are in subjection. This takes
place while the man is being regenerated, and thereby he is in a state
of seeing and acknowledging truths in their full extent. But when the
rational is subject to sensuous things, the contrary comes to pass; for
falsities are in the middle, or in the center, and truths are in the
circumference. The things which are in the center are in a certain
light, but it is a fatuous light, or such as arises from a coal fire,
into which flows a light on all sides from hell. This is the light which
is called darkness, for as soon as any light from heaven flows into it,
it is turned into darkness.

Verses 14, 15. But remember me with thee when it is well with thee, and
do mercy I pray with me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring
me out of this house. For being carried off by theft I was carried away
out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also have I done nothing that
they should put me into the pit. "But remember me with thee," signifies
the reception of faith; "when it is well with thee," signifies when
there is correspondence; "and do mercy I pray with me," signifies the
reception of charity; "and make mention of me unto Pharaoh," signifies
communication with the interior natural; "and bring me out of this
house," signifies deliverance from evils; "for being carried off by
theft I was carried away," signifies that heavenly things were alienated
by evil; "out of the land of the Hebrews," signifies from the church;
"and here also have I done nothing," signifies innocence; "that they
should put me into the pit," signifies rejection among falsities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5130.">5130.</span></span>

But remember me with thee. That this signifies the reception of faith,
is evident from the representation of Joseph, who says these things of
himself, as being the Lord as to the celestial in the natural (see n.
5086, 5087, 5106); and from the signification of "remember me with
thee," as being the reception of faith; for to remember and to be
mindful of the Lord is from no other source than faith; hence "remember
me with thee," denotes that he may receive faith. The case in regard to
faith is this: he who receives and has faith is continually mindful of
the Lord, even when he is thinking or speaking of other things, and also
when he is discharging his public, private, or domestic duties, although
he is not aware that he is then mindful of the Lord; for the remembrance
of the Lord by those who are in faith reigns universally with them, and
what reigns universally is not perceived, except while the thought is
directed to it. \[2\] This may be illustrated by various things with
man. He who is in any love, whatever it may be, is continually thinking
about whatever belongs to that love; and this although he is engaged in
thought, in speech, or in action relative to other things. In the other
life this is very evident from the spiritual spheres about everyone; for
simply from these spheres it is known in what faith and in what love are
all who are there, and this even though they are thinking and speaking
of something entirely different (see n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504-1520,
2489, 4464); for that which reigns universally in anyone produces a
sphere of the same, and displays his life before others. From this may
be seen what is meant when it is said that we must be constantly
thinking about the Lord, salvation, and the life after death. All who
are in faith from charity do this, and therefore they do not think ill
of the neighbor, and they have justice and equity in everything of their
thought, speech, and action; for that which reigns universally flows
into particulars and guides and governs them, because the Lord keeps the
mind in such things as are of charity and the derivative faith and thus
disposes everything in conformity therewith. The sphere of faith from
charity is the sphere which reigns in heaven; for the Lord flows in with
love, and through love with charity, consequently with the truths which
are of faith; and from this they who are in heaven are said to be in the
Lord. \[3\] In what now follows the subject treated of is the rebirth of
the sensuous subject to the intellectual part, and which is represented
by the butler; and because its rebirth is treated of, the reception of
faith is also treated of. For the sensuous, like the rational, is born
again by means of faith, but by the faith into which charity flows.
Unless charity flows into faith and gives it life, faith cannot reign
universally; for what a man loves reigns, and not what he merely knows
and holds in his memory.

When it is well with thee. That this signifies when there is
correspondence, is evident from the signification of its "being well
with thee," when the rebirth or regeneration of the exterior natural or
sensuous is treated of, as being correspondence; for it is not well with
it until it corresponds. At the end of the different chapters it may be
seen what correspondence is. There is a correspondence of sensuous with
natural things, a correspondence of natural with spiritual things, a
correspondence of spiritual with celestial things, and finally a
correspondence of celestial things with the Divine of the Lord; thus
there is a succession of correspondences from the Divine down to the
ultimate natural. \[2\] But as an idea of the nature of correspondences
can with difficulty be formed by those who have never thought about them
before, it may be well to say a few words on the subject. It is known
from philosophy that the end is the first of the cause, and that the
cause is the first of the effect. That the end, the cause, and the
effect may follow in order, and act as a one, it is needful that the
effect should correspond to the cause, and the cause to the end. But
still the end does not appear as the cause, nor the cause as the effect;
for in order that the end may produce the cause, it must take to itself
administrant means from the region where the cause is, by which means
the end may produce the cause; and in order that the cause may produce
the effect, it also must take to itself administrant means from the
region where the effect is, by which means the cause may produce the
effect. These administrant means are what correspond; and because they
correspond, the end can be in the cause and can actuate the cause, and
the cause can be in the effect and can actuate the effect; consequently
the end through the cause can actuate the effect. It is otherwise when
there is no correspondence; for then the end has no cause in which it
may be, still less an effect in which it may be, but is changed and
varied in the cause, and finally in the effect, according to the form
made by the administrant means. \[3\] All things in general and in
particular in man, nay, all things in general and in particular in
nature, succeed one another as end, cause, and effect; and when they
thus correspond to one another, they act as a one; for then the end is
the all in all things of the cause, and through the cause is the all in
all things of the effect. As for example, when heavenly love is the end,
the will the cause, and action the effect, if there is correspondence,
then heavenly love flows into the will, and the will into the action,
and they so act as a one that by means of the correspondence the action
is as it were the love; or as when the faith of charity is the end,
thought the cause, and speech the effect, then if there is
correspondence, faith from charity flows into the thought, and this into
the speech, and they so act as a one, that by means of the
correspondence the speech is as it were the end. In order however that
the end, which is love and faith, may produce the cause, which is will
and thought, it must take to itself administrant means in the rational
mind that will correspond; for without administrant means that
correspond, the end, which is love or faith, cannot be received, however
much it may flow in from the Lord through heaven. From this it is plain
that the interiors and the exteriors of man, that is, what is rational,
natural, and sensuous in him must be brought into correspondence, in
order that he may receive the Divine influx, and consequently that he
may be born again; and that it is not well with him till then. This is
the reason why here by "when it is well with thee" is signified
correspondence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5132.">5132.</span></span>

And do mercy I pray with me. That this signifies the reception of
charity, is evident from the signification of "mercy," as being love
(see n. 3063, 3073, 3120, 5042); here love toward the neighbor, or
charity, because the reception of faith was spoken of above (n. 5130);
for faith and charity will make a one in the sensuous when this is being
reborn. That "mercy" signifies charity is because all who are in charity
are in mercy, or in other words all who love the neighbor are merciful
to him; and therefore acts of charity are described in the Word by works
of mercy; as in Matthew: I was hungry and ye gave Me to eat; I was
thirsty and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger and ye gathered Me; naked
and ye clothed Me; I was sick and ye visited Me; I was in prison and ye
came unto Me (Matt. 25:35-36); and in other places by benefiting the
poor, the afflicted, the widows, and the fatherless. \[2\] In its
essence charity is to will well to the neighbor, to be affected with
good, and to acknowledge good as the neighbor, consequently those who
are in good, with a difference according to the degree of their good;
and hence charity, because it is affected with good, is affected with
mercy toward those who are in miseries. The good of charity has this
within it because it descends from the Lord's love toward the whole
human race, which love is mercy because all the human race is settled in
miseries. Mercy sometimes shows itself in the evil, who are in no
charity; but this is grief on account of what they themselves suffer,
for it is shown toward their friends who make one with them, and when
their friends suffer, they suffer. This mercy is not the mercy of
charity, but is the mercy of friendship for the sake of self, which
regarded in itself is unmercifulness; for it despises or hates all
others besides itself, thus besides the friends who make one with it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5133.">5133.</span></span>

And make mention of me unto Pharaoh. That this signifies communication
with the interior natural, is evident from the signification of "making
mention to" anyone as being to communicate; and from the representation
of Pharaoh, as being the interior natural (see n. 5080, 5095). By
"communication with the interior natural" is meant conjunction by
correspondence. The interior natural is that which receives ideas of
truth and good from the rational, and stores them up for use,
consequently which communicates immediately with the rational; but the
exterior natural is that which receives images and thence ideas of
things from the world through the senses. \[2\] These ideas, unless
enlightened by those which are in the interior natural, present
fallacies, which are called the fallacies of the senses. When man is in
these fallacies, he believes nothing but what agrees with them, and what
they confirm, as is the case if there is no correspondence; and there is
no correspondence unless the man is imbued with charity, for charity is
the uniting means, because in the good of it there is life from the
Lord, which disposes truth into order, so that the form of charity, or
charity in an image, may come into existence. This form appears visibly
in the other life, and is the angelic form itself. Hence all the angels
are forms of charity, the beauty of which is from the truths which are
of faith, and the life of this beauty is from the good which is of
charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5134.">5134.</span></span>

And bring me out of this house. That this signifies deliverance from
evils, is evident from the signification of "bringing out," as being
deliverance; and from the signification of a "house," as being good (see
n. 710, 1708, 2048, 2233, 3128, 3652, 3720, 4982); and therefore in the
opposite sense, evil. Hence it is plain that deliverance from evils is
signified by the words, "bring me out of this house," and this also
follows in its order from the things which precede. When faith is
received in the exterior natural (which is here treated of, see n.
5130), correspondence is effected (n. 5131), and charity is received (n.
5132), and thus communication is effected with the interior natural (n.
5133), which is then delivered from the evils whereby the celestial
represented by Joseph (n. 5086, 5087, 5106) was alienated; which
alienation is signified by his being "carried off by theft," as
presently follows. Moreover, when the natural is being regenerated by
means of charity and faith, it is delivered from evils; for evils are
then separated, and are cast out from the center where they were before,
to the circumferences, whither the light of truth from good does not
reach. In this way are evils separated in man, and yet are retained, for
they cannot be entirely destroyed. But with the Lord, who made the
natural in Himself Divine, evils and falsities were utterly cast out and
destroyed; for the Divine can have nothing in common with evils and
falsities, nor be terminated in them, as is the case with man; for the
Divine is the very being of good and of truth, which is infinitely
removed from what is evil and false.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5135.">5135.</span></span>

For in being carried off by theft I was carried away. That this
signifies that celestial things were alienated by evil, is evident from
the representation of Joseph, who says these things of himself, as being
the celestial in the natural (n. 5086, 5087, 5106), consequently the
celestial things therein; and from the signification of "being carried
off by theft," as being to be alienated by evil; for "to steal" is to
alienate, and "theft" is the evil which alienates, and also the evil
which claims the celestial things that are in the natural. "Theft"
signifies alienation in respect to the abode of which it takes
possession, and from which it casts out goods and truths, and which it
fills with evils and falsities; "theft" also signifies the claiming of
what belongs to others when it attributes to itself and makes its own
the goods and truths which are in that abode, and also when it applies
them to evils and falsities. That it may be known what "theft" is in the
spiritual sense, it is necessary to state how the case is with evils and
falsities when they enter and take possession of the abode, and also
when they claim the goods and truths which are there. \[2\] From infancy
until childhood, and sometimes till early manhood, by instruction from
his parents and teachers a man is imbued with goods and truths; for he
then learns them with avidity, and believes them in simplicity. The
state of innocence favors them and adapts them to the memory, but places
them only at the first threshold; for the innocence of infancy and
childhood is not internal innocence which affects the rational, but is
external innocence which affects only the exterior natural (see n. 2306,
3183, 3494, 4563, 4797). But when the man grows older and begins to
think from himself, and not as before from parents and teachers, he then
takes up again and as it were ruminates the things which he had before
learned and believed, and either confirms them, or doubts about them, or
denies them. If he confirms them, it is a sign that he is in good; if he
denies them, it is a sign that he is in evil; but if he doubts about
them, it is a sign that in succeeding years he will accede either to the
affirmative or to the negative. \[3\] The things which man as a little
child in its first age learns eagerly or believes, and which he
afterward either confirms, or doubts about, or denies, are especially
these: that there is a God, and that He is one; that He has created all
things; that He rewards those who do well, and punishes those who do
evil; that there is a life after death, in which the evil go to hell and
the good to heaven, thus that there is a hell and a heaven, and that the
life after death is eternal; also that he ought to pray daily, and this
with humility; that the Sabbath day is to be kept holy; that parents are
to be honored; and that no one must commit adultery, murder, or theft;
with other like things. These things man imbibes and is imbued with from
early childhood; but when he begins to think from himself and to lead
himself, if he confirms such things in himself, and adds to them things
which are still more interior, and lives according to them, then it is
well with him; but if he begins to infringe these things, and at last to
deny them, however much for the sake of civil laws and for the sake of
society he may live in externals according to them, he is then in evil.
\[4\] This evil is what is signified by "theft," insofar as like a thief
it takes possession of the abode in which good has been before, and
insofar as with many it takes away the goods and truths which had been
there before, and applies them to confirm evils and falsities. The Lord
insofar as possible then removes from that abode the goods and truths of
early childhood, and withdrawing them toward the interiors stores them
up in the interior natural for use. These goods and truths stored up in
the interior natural are signified in the Word by "remains" (see n. 468,
530, 560, 561, 660, 661, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284). But if evil steals the
goods and truths there, and applies them to confirm evils and falsities,
especially if it does this from deceit, then it consumes these remains;
for it then mingles evils with goods and falsities with truths till they
cannot be separated, and then it is all over with the man. \[5\] That
such things are signified by "theft," may be seen from the mere
application of "theft" to the things of spiritual life. In spiritual
life there are no other riches than the knowledges of good and truth,
and no other possessions and inheritances than the felicities of life
arising from goods and their truths. As before said, to steal these
things is "theft" in the spiritual sense; and therefore by "thefts," in
the Word, nothing else is signified in the internal sense; as in
Zechariah: I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, when behold a flying roll.
Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth upon the faces
of the whole earth; for everyone that stealeth hence, like it is
innocent; and everyone that sweareth, like it is innocent. I have cast
it forth that it may enter into the house of the thief, and into the
house of him that sweareth by My name for lying; and it shall pass the
night in his house, and shall consume it and the wood thereof and the
stones thereof (Zech. 5:1, 3-4); the evil which takes away the remains
of good is signified by "him that stealeth," and by the "house of the
thief;" and the falsity which takes away the remains of truth is
signified by "him that sweareth," and by the "house of him that sweareth
for lying;" the "faces of the whole earth" denote the universal church;
therefore it is said that "the curse shall consume the house and the
wood thereof and the stones thereof." The "house" is the natural mind or
man as to this mind (n. 3128, 3538, 4973, 5023); "wood" is the goods
therein (n. 2784, 2812, 3720, 4943); and the "stones" are truths (n.
643, 1298, 3720). \[6\] Profanation and hence the taking away of good
and truth are signified in the spiritual sense by the deed of Achan, who
took of the accursed things a mantle of Shinar, two hundred shekels of
silver, and a wedge of gold, and hid them in the earth in the midst of
his tent, and who therefore was stoned, and all the things were burned;
as is related in Joshua: Jehovah said unto Joshua, Israel hath sinned,
they have transgressed My covenant which I commanded them; and they have
taken of the accursed thing, and have stolen, lied, and have put it
among their vessels (Josh. 7:10-11, 21, 25); by "accursed things" were
meant falsities and evils, which were in no wise to be mixed up with
holy things; the "mantle of Shinar, shekels of silver, and wedge of
gold" are in the spiritual sense species of falsity; "hiding them under
the earth in the midst of the tent" signified a commixture with holy
things. (That a "tent" denotes what is holy may be seen above, n. 414,
1102, 1566, 2145, 2152, 3312, 4128, 4391, 4599.) These things were
signified by Israel's "stealing, lying, and putting it among their
vessels;" for "vessels" are holy truths (see n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318).
\[7\] In Jeremiah: I will bring the issue of Esau upon him, the time
that I shall visit him. If grape gatherers came to thee, would they not
leave some grape gleanings? If thieves by night, would they not destroy
a sufficiency? I will strip Esau, I will uncover his secret things, and
he shall not be able to hide, his seed is devastated, and his brethren,
and his neighbors, and he is not (Jer. 49:8-10); where "Esau" denotes
the evil of the love of self to which falsities are adjoined (n. 3322).
That this evil consumes the remains of good and truth is signified by
"thieves in the night destroying a sufficiency;" and by "his seed, his
brethren, and his neighbors being devastated, and he is not." "Seed"
denotes the truths which are of faith from charity (n. 1025, 1447, 1610,
1940, 2848, 3038, 3310, 3373); "brethren" denote the goods which are of
charity (n. 367, 2360, 2508, 2524, 3160, 3303, 3459, 3815, 4121, 4191);
"neighbors" denote the adjoined and related truths and goods which
belong to him. \[8\] Something similar is said of Esau in Obadiah: If
thieves come to thee, if overthrowers by night (how wilt thou be cut
off!) will they not steal till they have enough? If grape gatherers come
to thee, will they not leave some clusters? (Obad. 5); "grape gatherers"
denote falsities which are not from evil; by these falsities the goods
and truths stored up by the Lord in man's interior natural (that is,
remains) are not consumed, but by falsities derived from evils, which
steal truths and goods and also by wrong applications employ them to
confirm evils and falsities. \[9\] In Joel: A great people and mighty,
they shall run like heroes; they shall climb the wall like men of war;
and they shall march everyone in his ways; they shall run to and fro in
the city; they shall run on the wall; they shall climb up into the
houses; they shall enter in through the windows like a thief (Joel 2:2,
7, 9); a "great people and mighty" denotes falsities fighting against
truths (n. 1259, 1260); and because they fight mightily in destroying
truths, they are said to be "like heroes and men of war;" the "city"
through which they are said to "run to and fro" denotes the doctrinals
of truth (n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2712, 2943, 3216); the "houses into which
they shall climb" denote the goods which they destroy (n. 710, 1708,
2048, 2233, 3128, 3652, 3720, 4982); the "windows through which they
shall enter in" denote things intellectual and the derivative reasonings
(n. 655, 658, 3391); hence they are compared to a "thief," because they
take possession of the abode previously occupied by truths and goods.
\[10\] In David: As thou hatest discipline, and castest My words behind
thee; if thou seest a thief thou runnest with him, and thy part is with
adulterers. Thou openest thy mouth for evil, and with thy tongue thou
weavest deceit (Ps. 50:17-19); speaking of a wicked person, "to run with
a thief" denotes to alienate truth from himself by means of falsity.
\[11\] In Revelation: They repented not of their murders, nor of their
enchantments, nor of their whoredoms, nor of their thefts (Rev. 9:21);
"murders" denote evils which destroy goods; "enchantments," falsities
therefrom which destroy truths; "whoredoms," truths falsified; "thefts"
goods thus alienated. \[12\] In John: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He
that entereth not through the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up
some other way, he is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in
through the door is the shepherd of the sheep. I am the door; through Me
if anyone enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and
shall find pasture. The thief cometh not but to steal, and to murder,
and to destroy (John 10:1-2, 9-10); here again a "thief" denotes the
evil of merit; for he who takes away from the Lord what is His, and
claims it for himself, is called a "thief." As this evil closes the way
and prevents good and truth from the Lord from flowing in, it is said
"to murder" and "to destroy." The same is signified by the commandment
in the Decalogue: Thou shalt not steal (Deut. 5:19; see n. 4174). From
all this it is evident what is signified by the laws enacted in the
Jewish Church in regard to thefts (as in Exod. 21:16; 22:1-4; Deut.
24:7); for as all the laws in that church originated in the spiritual
world, they correspond to the laws of order which are in heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5136.">5136.</span></span>

Out of the land of the Hebrews. That this signifies from the church,
namely, that celestial things were alienated from it through evil, is
evident from the signification of the "land of the Hebrews," as being
the church. The "land of the Hebrews" here, is the land of Canaan; for
Joseph was taken away from there. The reason why the land of Canaan in
the Word signifies the church, is that the church has been there from
the most ancient time: first the Most Ancient Church, which was before
the flood; next the Ancient Church, which was after the flood; afterward
the Second Ancient Church, which was called the Hebrew Church; and at
last the Jewish Church. And in order that the Jewish Church might be
instituted there, Abram was commanded to betake himself thither out of
Syria, and it was there promised him that this land should be given to
his posterity for an inheritance. This is the reason why "land" or
"earth" in the Word signifies the church, and the "whole earth," as
sometimes occurs, the universal church; and also the "new heaven and new
earth," a new church internal and external. \[2\] The reason why the
church was continued there from the most ancient time, is that the man
of the Most Ancient Church, who was celestial, was of such a character
that in each and all things in the world and upon the earth he saw a
representative of the Lord's kingdom; the objects of the world and the
earth being to him the means of thinking about heavenly things. This was
the origin of all the representatives and significatives that were
afterward known in the Ancient Church, for they were collected by those
who are meant by "Enoch," and were preserved for the use of posterity
(n. 519, 521, 2896). From this it came to pass that every place, and
also every mountain and river, in the land of Canaan, where the most
ancient people dwelt, and likewise all the kingdoms round about, became
representative; and as the Word could not be written except by
representatives and significatives, even of places, therefore for the
sake of this end the church was successively preserved in the land of
Canaan; but after the coming of the Lord it was transferred elsewhere,
because representatives were then abolished. \[3\] From the foregoing it
is plain that by the land of Canaan, which is here called the "land of
the Hebrews," is signified the church; but see what has been previously
adduced on these subjects; namely, that the Most Ancient Church, which
was before the flood, was in the land of Canaan (n. 567, 3686, 4447,
4454); that part of the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, was
there (see n. 3686, 4447); also that a second Ancient Church, which was
called the Hebrew Church, was there (n. 4516, 4517); that for the same
reason Abram was commanded to go there, and that land was given to his
posterity (n. 3686, 4447); that from this the land of Canaan represented
the Lord's kingdom (n. 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4240, 4447); and that it
is for this reason that by "earth" or "land" in the Word is signified
the church (see n. 566, 662, 1066, 1068, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850,
2117, 2118, 3355, 4447, 4535).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5137.">5137.</span></span>

And here also have I done nothing. That this signifies innocence, is
evident without explication; for not to do anything evil is the part of
innocence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5138.">5138.</span></span>

That they should put me into the pit. That this signifies rejection
among falsities, is evident from the signification of a "pit," as being
falsity (see n. 4728, 4744, 5038). Evil has been treated of above-that
celestial things were alienated by it (n. 5134, 5135); but here falsity
is treated of, for where the one is mentioned in the Word, the other is
mentioned also, that is to say, where evil is mentioned, falsity also is
mentioned; because where good is treated of, there also truth is treated
of, in order that there may be a marriage in everything of the Word. For
the heavenly marriage is that of good and truth, but the infernal
marriage is that of evil and falsity; because where there is evil, there
is also falsity, joining itself to evil as a wife to her husband; and
where there is good there is also truth, because truth conjoins itself
with good as a wife with her husband. Hence the quality of the faith may
be known from the life; for good is of the life and truth is of the
faith, and conversely it is the same with evil and falsity. (That there
is a marriage in everything of the Word may be seen above, n. 683, 793,
801, 2173, 2516, 2712, 4137e.)

Verses 16-19. And the prince of the bakers saw that he had interpreted
good, and he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and behold three
baskets with holes in them upon my head; and in the uppermost basket
there was of all food for Pharaoh, the work of the baker; and the birds
did eat them out of the basket from upon my head. And Joseph answered
and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets three
days are these. In yet three days shall Pharaoh lift off thy head from
upon thee, and shall hang thee upon wood; and the birds shall eat thy
flesh from upon thee. "And the prince of the bakers saw," signifies the
perception of the sensuous that is subject to the will part; "that he
had interpreted good," signifies what would happen; "and he said unto
Joseph," signifies the perception of the celestial in the natural; "I
also was in my dream," signifies prediction; "and behold three baskets,"
signifies the successives of things of the will; "with holes in them
upon my head," signifies without termination anywhere in the middle;
"and in the uppermost basket," signifies the inmost of the will part;
"there was of all food for Pharaoh," signifies full of celestial good
for the nourishment of the natural; "the work of the baker," signifies
according to every use of the sensuous; "and the birds did eat them out
of the basket from upon my head," signifies that falsity from evil
consumed it; "and Joseph answered and said," signifies revelation from
perception from the celestial in the natural; "This is the
interpretation thereof," signifies what it had in it; "the three
baskets," signifies the successives of the things of the will; "three
days are these," signifies even to the last; "in yet three days,"
signifies that which is in the last; "shall Pharaoh lift off thy head
from upon thee," signifies what is concluded from what is foreseen; "and
shall hang thee upon wood," signifies rejection and damnation; "and the
birds shall eat thy flesh from upon thee," signifies that the falsity
from evil will consume what is of these sensuous things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5140.">5140.</span></span>

And the prince of the bakers saw. That this signifies the perception of
the sensuous that is subject to the will part, is evident from the
signification of "seeing," as being to understand and perceive (n. 2150,
2807, 3764, 4723); and from the signification of the "prince of the
bakers," as being the sensuous in general subject to the will part, thus
these sensuous things (n. 5078, 5082).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5141.">5141.</span></span>

That he had interpreted good. That this signifies what would happen, is
evident from the signification of "interpreting," as being what it had
in it, or what there was therein (of which above, n. 5093, 5105, 5107,
5121); thus also what would happen. That good would happen, is the
perception from the sensuous, which perception is comparatively obscure.
There actually do exist perception from the sensuous or exterior
natural, perception from the interior natural, and perception from the
rational; for when a man is in interior thought from affection, and
withdraws his mind from sensuous things and from the body, he is in
rational perception; for then the things which are beneath, or which
belong to the external man, are quiescent, and the man is almost in his
spirit. But when man is in exterior thought, from causes which exist in
the world, then his perception is from the interior natural, and the
rational indeed flows in, but not with any life of affection. But when
man is in pleasures, and in the delights of the love of the world and
also of the love of self, the perception is from the sensuous; for his
life is then in externals or in the body, and admits no more from the
interiors than may serve to moderate his outbursts into what is
dishonorable and unbecoming. But the more external the perception is,
the more obscure it is, because exterior things are comparatively
general, for innumerable interior things appear as one in the exterior.

And he said unto Joseph. That this signifies the perception of the
celestial in the natural, is evident from the signification of "saying,"
in the historic parts of the Word, as being perception (often explained
before); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial
in the natural (see n. 5086, 5087, 5106).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5143.">5143.</span></span>

I also was in my dream. That this signifies prediction, is evident from
the signification of a "dream," as being prediction concerning the event
(see n. 5092, 5104, 5112).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5144.">5144.</span></span>

And behold three baskets. That this signifies the successives of the
things of the will, is evident from the signification of "three," as
being what is complete and continuous even to the end (see n. 2788,
4495, 5114, 5122), thus what is successive; and from the signification
of "baskets," as being things of the will. That "baskets" are things of
the will is because they are vessels to hold food; and also because food
signifies celestial and spiritual goods, and these are of the will; for
all good pertains to the will, and all truth to the understanding. As
soon as anything comes forth from the will, it is perceived as good. In
what precedes, the sensuous subject to the intellectual part has been
treated of, which was represented by the butler; what is now treated of
is the sensuous subject to the will part, which is represented by the
baker (see n. 5077, 5078, 5082). \[2\] What is successive or continuous
in intellectual things was represented by the vine, its three shoots,
its blossoms, clusters, and grapes; and finally the truth which is of
the intellect was represented by the cup (see n. 5120); but what is
successive in the things of the will is represented by the three baskets
on the head, in the uppermost of which there was of all food for
Pharaoh, the work of the baker. By what is successive in the things of
the will is meant what is successive from the inmosts of man down to his
outermost, in which is the sensuous; for there are steps or degrees as
of a ladder, from inmosts to outermosts (see n. 5114). Into the inmost
there flows good from the Lord, and this through the rational into the
interior natural, and thence into the exterior natural or sensuous, in a
distinct succession, as by the steps of a ladder; and in each degree it
is qualified according to the reception. But the further nature of this
influx and its succession will be shown in the following pages. \[3\]
"Baskets" signify the things of the will insofar as goods are therein,
in other passages of the Word, as in Jeremiah: Jehovah showed me, when
behold two baskets of figs set before the temple of Jehovah; in one
basket exceedingly good figs, like the figs that are first ripe; but in
the other basket exceedingly bad figs, which could not be eaten for
badness (Jer. 24:1-2); here "basket" is expressed in the original by a
different word, which signifies the will part in the natural; the "figs"
in the one basket are natural goods, while those in the other are
natural evils. \[4\] In Moses: When thou art come into the land which
Jehovah thy God will give thee, thou shalt take of the first ripe of all
the fruit of the land, which thou shalt bring in from thy land, and thou
shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which Jehovah
shall choose. Then the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and
set it before the altar of Jehovah thy God (Deut. 26:1-2, 4); here
"basket" is expressed by still another word that signifies a new will
part in the intellectual part; "the first ripe of the fruit of the
earth" are the goods thence derived. \[5\] In the same: For the
sanctifying of Aaron and his sons, Moses was to take unleavened bread,
and cakes unleavened mingled with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed
with oil; of fine wheaten flour shalt thou make them. And thou shalt put
them upon one basket, and bring them near in the basket. Aaron and his
sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread in the basket, at the
door of the tent of meeting (Exod. 29:2-3, 32); "basket" here is
expressed by the same term as in the present chapter, signifying the
will part in which are the goods signified by "bread," "cakes," "oil,"
"wafers," "flour," and "wheat;" by the will part is meant the
containant; for goods from the Lord flow into the interior forms of man,
as into their vessels, which forms, if disposed for reception, are the
"baskets" in which these goods are contained. \[6\] Again: When a
Nazirite was being inaugurated he was to take a basket of unleavened
things of fine flour, cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers
anointed with oil, with their meat-offering, and their drink-offerings;
a ram also he shall make a sacrifice of peace-offerings to Jehovah,
besides the basket of unleavened things; and the priest shall take the
boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake out of the basket,
and one unleavened wafer, and shall put them upon the hand of the
Nazirite, and the priest shall wave them with a waving before Jehovah
(Num. 6:15, 17, 19-20); here also "basket" denotes the will part as the
containant; the "cakes," the "wafers," the "oil," the "meat-offering,"
the "boiled shoulder of the ram," are celestial goods which were being
represented; for the Nazirite represented the celestial man (n. 3301).
\[7\] At that time such things as were used in worship were carried in
baskets; as was also the kid of the goats by Gideon, which he brought
forth to the angel under the oak (Judges 6:19); and this for the reason
that baskets represented the containants, and the things in the baskets,
the contents.

With holes in them upon my head. That this signifies without termination
anywhere in the middle, is evident from the signification of "with holes
in them," as being open from highest to lowest, thus not closed,
consequently without termination anywhere in the middle; and from the
signification of the "head," as being the interiors, especially those of
the will; for in the head are all substances and forms in their
beginnings, and therefore all sensations tend thither and there present
themselves, and all acts descend from it and take their origin. It is
evident that the faculties of the mind, that is, of the understanding
and the will, are there; and therefore by the "head" are signified the
interiors. These baskets represented the things which are in the head.
\[2\] The sensuous things which are subject to the will part are now
treated of, and by the "baskets with holes in them upon the head" is
signified that the interiors were without termination anywhere in the
middle, and for this reason these sensuous things were rejected and
damned-as will be seen in what follows. But it may be well to state what
is meant by being without termination anywhere in the middle. Man's
interiors are distinguished into degrees, and in each degree the
interiors are terminated, and by termination are separated from the
degree next below; it is thus from the inmost to the outermost. The
interior rational constitutes the first degree; in this are the
celestial angels, or in this is the inmost or third heaven. The exterior
rational makes the second degree; in this are the spiritual angels, or
in this is the middle or second heaven. The interior natural makes the
third degree; in this are good spirits, or the ultimate or first heaven.
The exterior natural, or the sensuous, makes the fourth degree; and in
this is man. These degrees in man are most distinct. \[3\] Thence it is
that if he lives in good, a man is as to his interiors a heaven in the
least form, or that his interiors correspond to the three heavens; and
hence it is that if a man has lived a life of charity and love, he can
be carried after death even into the third heaven. But that he may be of
this character, it is necessary that all the degrees in him should be
well terminated, and thus by means of terminations be distinct from one
another; and when they are terminated, or by means of terminations are
made distinct from one another, each degree is a plane in which the good
which flows in from the Lord rests, and where it is received. Without
these degrees as planes, good is not received, but flows through, as
through a sieve or a basket that has holes in it, down to the sensuous,
and then, being without any direction in the way, it is turned into a
foulness which appears to those who are in it as good, namely, into the
delight of the love of self and of the world, consequently into the
delight of hatred, revenge, cruelty, adultery, and avarice, or into mere
voluptuousness and luxury. This is the case if the things of man's will
are without termination anywhere in the middle, or if they "have holes
in them." \[4\] It is quite possible to know whether there are these
terminations and consequent planes; for the perceptions of good and
truth, and of conscience, show this. With those who have perceptions of
good and truth, as have the celestial angels, the terminations are from
the first degree to the last; for without terminations of all the
degrees, such perceptions are impossible. (In regard to these
perceptions, see above, n. 125, 202, 495, 503, 511, 536, 597, 607, 784,
865, 895, 1121, 1383, 1384, 1387, 1919, 2144, 2145, 2171, 2515, 2831.)
With those also who have conscience, as the spiritual angels have, there
are terminations, but from the second degree or from the third to the
last, the first degree being closed with these angels. It is said "from
the second degree" or "from the third," because conscience is twofold,
interior and exterior; interior conscience is that of spiritual good and
truth, exterior conscience is that of what is just and equitable.
Conscience itself is an interior plane in which the influx of the Divine
good terminates. But they who have no conscience have not any interior
plane to receive this influx; and with these persons good flows through
down to the exterior natural or natural-sensuous; and as before said is
there turned into foul delights. Sometimes these persons seem to feel a
pain as of conscience, but it is not conscience; it is a pain arising
from the loss of their delight, such as that of honor, gain, reputation,
life, pleasures, or the friendship of people like themselves; and this
is because the terminations are in delights like these. From all this it
is evident what is signified in the spiritual sense by the baskets with
holes in them. \[5\] In the other life especially is it discerned
whether the things of a man's will have or have not been terminated.
With those in whom they have been terminated there is zeal for spiritual
good and truth, or for what is just and equitable, for these persons
have done what is good for the sake of good or for the sake of truth,
and have acted justly for the sake of what is just or equitable, and not
for the sake of gain, honor, and things like these. All those with whom
the interiors of the will have been terminated are taken up into heaven,
for the Divine that flows in can lead them, whereas all those with whom
the interior things of the will have not been terminated, betake
themselves into hell; for the Divine flows through, and is turned into
what is infernal, just as when the heat of the sun falls upon foul
excrements, and causes a noisome stench. Consequently all who have had
conscience are saved; but they who have had no conscience cannot be
saved. \[6\] The things of the will are said to have holes in them, or
not to be terminated, when there is no affection of good and truth, or
of what is just and equitable; and also when these things are regarded
as comparatively worthless or as nothing, or are valued solely for the
sake of securing gain or honor. The affections are what terminate and
close, and are therefore called "bonds" - affections of good and truth
"internal bonds," and affections of evil and falsity "external bonds"
(n. 3835). Unless the affections of evil and falsity were bonds, the man
would be insane (n. 4217); for insanities are nothing else than the
loosenings of such bonds; thus they are non-terminations in such
persons; but as in these persons there are no internal bonds, they are
inwardly insane in respect to the thoughts and affections, while
restrained from breaking out by external bonds, which are affections of
gain and honor, and of reputation as a means of acquiring these, and the
consequent fear of the law and of the loss of life. This was represented
in the Jewish Church by the fact that every open vessel in the house of
a dead person upon which there was no cloth cover was unclean (Num.
19:15). \[7\] Similar things are signified by "works full of holes" in
Isaiah: They that make thread of silks, and they that weave works full
of holes, shall blush; and the foundations thereof shall be broken in
pieces, all they that make hire pools of the soul (Isa. 19:9-10); and by
"holes" in Ezekiel: The spirit brought the prophet to the door of the
court; where he saw, and behold a hole in the wall; and he said unto
him, Come bore a hole through the wall; he therefore bored through the
wall, and behold a door; then said he unto him, Go in and see the
abominations that they do here. When he went in and saw, behold every
figure of creeping thing and beast, an abomination, and all the idols of
the house of Israel, portrayed upon the walls round about (Ezek.
8:7-10).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5146.">5146.</span></span>

And in the uppermost basket. That this signifies the inmost of the will
part, is evident from the signification of a "basket" as being the will
part (of which above, n. 5144); and from the signification of "the
uppermost," as being the inmost (n. 2148, 3084, 4599). The reason why
the "uppermost" denotes the inmost is that with man who is in space,
interior things appear as higher things, and exterior things as lower
ones; but when the idea of space is put off, as is the case in heaven
and also in the interior thought of man, there is then put off the idea
of what is high and what is low; for height and depth come from the idea
of space. Nay, in the interior heaven there is no idea of things
interior and exterior, because something of space adheres to this idea
also; but there is the idea of more perfect or more imperfect state; for
interior things are in a more perfect state than exterior ones, because
interior things are nearer the Divine, and exterior things are more
remote from it. This is the reason why what is uppermost signifies what
is inmost. \[2\] Nevertheless no one can apprehend what the interior is
relatively to the exterior unless he knows how the case stands with
degrees (in regard to which see above, n. 3691, 4154, 5114, 5145). Man
has no other conception of what is interior and hence more perfect than
as of what is purer in continual diminution; but the purer and the
grosser are possible in one and the same degree, both according to the
expansion and the contraction, and according to the determinations, and
also according to the insertions of things homogeneous or heterogeneous.
As such an idea prevails about the interior of man, it is quite
impossible to avoid the notion that the exteriors are continuously
coherent with the interiors, and thus act with them absolutely as a one.
But if a genuine idea about degrees is formed, it is then possible to
see how the interiors and the exteriors are distinct from one another,
and that they are so distinct that the interiors can come into existence
and subsist without the exteriors, but by no means the exteriors without
the interiors. It is also then possible to see how the case stands with
the correspondence of the interiors in the exteriors, and also how the
exteriors can represent the interiors. This is the reason why the
learned can treat hypothetically only of the interaction between the
soul and the body; nay, this is also the reason why many of them believe
life to be in the body, so that when the body dies, they believe that
they will die as to the interiors also, on account of the coherence of
these with the body, when yet it is only the exterior degree that dies,
the interior then surviving and living.

There was of all food for Pharaoh. That this signifies full of celestial
good for the nourishment of the natural, is evident from the
signification of "food," as being celestial good (of which presently);
and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the interior natural
(see n. 5080, 5095), and also the natural in general; for when they
correspond, the interior and exterior natural make a one; and as food is
for nourishment, by the words "there was of all food for Pharaoh" is
signified full of celestial good for the nourishment of the natural. It
is said that this food was in the uppermost basket; and by this is
signified that the inmost of the will part was full of celestial good.
For good from the Lord flows in through man's inmost, and thence through
degrees as by the steps of a ladder to the exteriors; for the inmost is
relatively in the most perfect state, and therefore can receive good
immediately from the Lord; but not so the lower things. If these were to
receive good from the Lord immediately, they would either obscure it or
pervert it, for they are relatively more imperfect. \[2\] As regards the
influx of celestial good from the Lord, and its reception, be it known
that man's will part receives good, and his intellectual receives truth,
and that the intellectual can by no means receive truth so as to make it
its own, unless at the same time the will part receives good; and
conversely; for the one flows in this way into the other, and disposes
it to receive. The things of the intellect may be compared to forms
which are continually varying, and the things of the will to the
harmonies that result from this variation; consequently truths may be
compared to variations, and goods to the delights therefrom; and as this
is eminently the case with truths and goods, it is evident that the one
is impossible without the other, and also that the one cannot be
produced except by means of the other. \[3\] That "food" signifies
celestial good, is because the food of the angels is nothing else than
the goods of love and of charity, by which they are not only made alive,
but are also refreshed. These goods in act, or the practice of them,
serve especially for the refreshment of the angels, because they are
their desires; and it is known that when the desires are realized in
act, they afford refreshment and life. That such things yield
nourishment to the spirit of man, while material food yields nourishment
to his body, may also be seen from the fact that food without delights
conduces but little to nourishment, but together with delights it
nourishes. It is the delights that open the passages or ducts which
receive the food and convey it into the blood; whereas things
undelightful close them. With the angels these delights are the goods of
love and of charity, and from this it can be inferred that they are
spiritual foods which correspond to earthly foods. As goods are food, so
truths are drink. \[4\] "Food" is mentioned in many places in the Word,
and one who is not acquainted with the internal sense cannot know but
that ordinary food is there meant, whereas it is spiritual food; as in
Jeremiah: All the people groan, seeking bread; they have given their
desirable things for food, to refresh the soul (Lam. 1:11). In Isaiah:
Everyone that thirsteth, go ye to the waters, and he that hath no
silver, go ye, buy, and eat; yea, go, buy wine and milk without silver
and without price (Isa. 55:1). In Joel: The day of Jehovah is near, and
as devastation from the Thunderer shall it come. Is not the food cut off
before our eyes? gladness and joy from the house of our God? The grains
have rotted under their clods; the garners are devastated, the barns are
destroyed, because the corn is withered (Joel 1:15-17). In David: Our
garners are full, bringing forth from food to food; our flocks are
thousands and ten thousands in our streets. There is no cry in our
streets; blessed is the people that is in such a case (Ps. 144:13-15).
Again: All things wait for Thee, that Thou mayest give them their food
in its time. Thou givest them, they gather; Thou openest Thy hand, they
are sated with good (Ps. 104:27-28). \[5\] In these passages celestial
and spiritual food is meant in the internal sense, while material food
is meant in the sense of the letter. From this it is plain in what
manner the interiors and exteriors of the Word, or those things therein
which are of the spirit, and those which are of the letter, correspond
to each other; so that while man understands these things according to
the sense of the letter, the angels with him understand them according
to the spiritual sense. The Word has been so written as to serve not
only the human race, but also heaven; for which reason all the
expressions therein are significative of heavenly things, and all the
things are representative of them, and this even to the least jot. \[6\]
That "food" in the spiritual sense is good, the Lord also plainly
teaches in John: Labor not for the food that perisheth, but for the food
that abideth into life eternal, which the Son of man shall give to you
(John 6:27). Again: My flesh is truly food, and My blood is truly drink
(John 6:55); where "flesh" is the Divine good (n. 3813); and "blood" is
the Divine truth (n. 4735). And again: Jesus said to His disciples, I
have food to eat that ye know not. The disciples said one to another,
Hath any man brought Him aught to eat? Jesus saith to them, My food is
that I do the will of Him that sent Me, and that I perfect His work
(John 4:32-34); "to do the will of the Father, and to perfect His work,"
is the Divine good in act or exercise, which as before said in the
genuine sense is "food."

<span class="margnote"><span id="5148.">5148.</span></span>

The work of the baker. That this signifies according to every use of the
sensuous, is evident from the signification of "work," as being
according to every use (of which hereafter); and from the signification
of a "baker," as being the sensuous subject to the will part (see n.
5078, 5082). The reason why "work" denotes use is that it is predicated
of the will part, or of the sensuous subject to the will part; and
whatever is done by means of this, and can be called "work," must be
use. All the works of charity are nothing else, for works of charity are
works from the will that are uses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5149.">5149.</span></span>

And the bird did eat them out of the basket from upon my head. That this
signifies that falsity from evil consumed it, is evident from the
signification of "the birds" as being intellectual things, and also
thoughts, consequently the things thence derived; namely, in the genuine
sense truths of every kind, and in the opposite sense falsities (see n.
40, 745, 776, 778, 866, 988, 3219); and from the signification of
"eating," as being to consume (in the original tongue also, the word
"eat" means to consume); and from the signification of a "basket," as
being the will part (n. 5144, 5146), here evil from the will part,
because the basket had holes in it (n. 5145). From this it follows that
by the "bird eating out of the basket from upon the head" is signified
that falsity from evil consumed. \[2\] There is falsity from two
origins-falsity of doctrine, and falsity of evil. Falsity of doctrine
does not consume goods, for a man may be in falsity of doctrine, and yet
in good, and therefore men of every doctrine, even Gentiles, are saved;
but the falsity of evil is that which consumes goods. Evil in itself is
opposite to good, yet by itself it does not consume goods, but by means
of falsity, for falsity attacks the truths which belong to good, because
truths are as it were outworks that encompass good. These outworks are
assaulted by means of falsity, and when these are assaulted good is
given to destruction. \[3\] One who does not know that "birds" signify
things of the intellect, cannot know otherwise than that where "birds"
are mentioned in the Word, either birds are meant, or else they are used
by way of comparison, as in common speech. Except from the internal
sense no one can know that by "birds" are meant things of the
understanding such as thoughts, ideas, reasonings, principles,
consequently truths or falsities; as in Luke: The kingdom of God is like
unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his
garden; and it grew and became a great tree; so that the birds of the
heaven dwelt in the branches of it (Luke 13:19); the "birds of the
heaven" here denotes truths. \[4\] In Ezekiel: It shall go forth into a
magnificent cedar; and under it shall dwell every bird of every wing; in
the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell (Ezek. 17:23); "bird
of every wing" denotes truths of every kind. And again: Asshur was a
cedar in Lebanon. All the birds of the heavens made their nests in his
boughs, and under his branches all the beasts of the field brought
forth, and in his shadow dwelt all great nations (Ezek. 31:3, 6); "birds
of the heavens" in like manner denote truths. \[5\] Again: Upon his ruin
all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the wild animals of
the field shall be upon his branches (Ezek. 31:13); where "birds of the
heavens" denote falsities. In Daniel: Nebuchadnezzar saw in a dream;
behold a tree in the midst of the earth; the beast of the field had
shadow under it, and the bird of the heaven dwelt in the branches
thereof (Dan. 4:10, 12, 18); where again "birds of the heaven" denote
falsities. \[6\] In Jeremiah: I beheld and lo there was no man, and all
the birds of the heaven were fled (Jer. 4:25); "no man" denotes no good
(n. 4287); the "birds of the heaven that were fled" denotes that truths
were dispersed. Again: From the bird of the heavens, even to the beast,
they are fled, they are gone (Jer. 9:10); where the meaning is similar.
And in Matthew: The sower went forth to sow; and some seeds fell upon
the hard way, and the birds came and devoured them (Matt. 13:3-4); where
"birds" denote reasonings, and also falsities. The meaning is similar in
many other passages.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5150.">5150.</span></span>

And Joseph answered and said. That this signifies revelation from
perception, from the celestial in the natural, is evident from the
signification of "answering and saying," as being revelation from
perception (of which above, see n. 5121); and from the representation of
Joseph, as being the celestial in the natural (n. 5086, 5087, 5106).
That here "Joseph" is the celestial in the natural, is because the
subject here treated of is the natural. In regard to the celestial and
the spiritual the case is this. The celestial itself and the spiritual
itself which flow into heaven from the Divine of the Lord dwell
principally in the interior rational; for there the forms are more
perfect, and are accommodated to reception; nevertheless the celestial
and spiritual from the Divine of the Lord flow into the exterior
rational also, and likewise into the natural; and this both mediately
and immediately-mediately through the interior rational, and immediately
from the Lord's very Divine. That which flows in immediately disposes,
and that which flows in mediately is disposed. This is the case in the
exterior rational, and in the natural; and hence it is evident what is
meant by the celestial in the natural. \[2\] The celestial is from the
Divine good, and the spiritual is from the Divine truth, both of them
being from the Lord; and when these are in the rational they are called
the celestial and the spiritual in the rational; and when in the
natural, the celestial and the spiritual in the natural. By the
"rational" and the "natural" is meant the man himself, insofar as he is
formed to receive the celestial and the spiritual; but by the "rational"
is meant his internal, and by the "natural" his external. Through influx
and according to the reception, a man is called celestial or
spiritual-celestial if the Lord's Divine good is received in the will
part, spiritual if it in received in the intellectual part.
