### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="7751.">7751.</span></span>

At the end of the following chapter some account shall be given of the
spirits and inhabitants of the planet Jupiter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7752.">7752.</span></span>

Exodus 11 THE DOCTRINE OF CHARITY All things in the universe bear
relation to Good and Truth. That which does not bear relation to good
and truth is not in Divine order; and that which does not bear relation
to both together, produces nothing. Good is that which produces, and
truth is that by which it produces.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7753.">7753.</span></span>

These facts may illustrate how the case is with spiritual good and
truth, which are called charity and faith; namely, that all things which
belong to the church bear relation to these, and those which do not bear
relation to them have nothing of the church in them; and also that which
does not contain both within it produces no fruit, that is, no good of
charity or of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7754.">7754.</span></span>

For in order that anything may be produced, there must be two forces,
one which is called active, the other which is called passive; the one
without the other brings forth nothing. Such forces, or lives, are
charity and faith in the man of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7755.">7755.</span></span>

The first of the church is good, the second is truth; or the first of
the church is charity, and the second is faith. For the truth of the
doctrine of faith is for the sake of the good of life. That which is the
end for the sake of which something else exists, this is the first.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7756.">7756.</span></span>

With the conjunction of the good which is of charity, and the truth
which is of faith, in man, the case is this. The good which is of
charity enters through the soul into man, but the truth which is of
faith enters through the hearing; the former flows in immediately from
the Lord, but the latter mediately through the Word. Hence the way by
which the good of charity enters is called the internal way; and the way
by which the truth of faith enters is called the external way. That
which enters by the internal way is not perceived, because it is not
plainly subject to sensation; whereas that which enters by the external
way is perceived, because it is plainly subject to sensation. For this
reason everything of the church is attributed to faith. It is otherwise
with those who have been regenerated; with such the good that is of
charity is plainly perceived.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7757.">7757.</span></span>

The conjunction of the good of charity with the truth of faith is
effected in the interiors of man. The good itself which flows in from
the Lord adopts truth there, and appropriates it to itself, and thereby
causes the good with the man to be good, and the truth to be truth; or
the charity to be charity, and the faith to be faith. Without this
conjunction charity is not charity, but only natural goodness; neither
is faith faith, but only the memory-knowledge of such things as are of
faith, and in some cases a persuasion that a thing is so for the sake of
earning gain or honor.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7758.">7758.</span></span>

When truth has been conjoined with good it is no longer called truth,
but good; and so when faith has been conjoined with charity it is no
longer called faith, but charity; the reason is that the man then wills
and does the truth, and that which he wills and does is called good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7759.">7759.</span></span>

With the conjunction of the good of charity with the truth of faith, the
case, further, is this. This good obtains its quality from truth, and
truth its essence from good. From this it follows that the quality of
good is according to the truths with which it is conjoined; and
therefore good becomes genuine if the truths with which it is conjoined
are genuine. Genuine truths of faith are possible within the church, but
not out of it, for within the church is the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7760.">7760.</span></span>

Moreover, the good of charity receives its quality also from the
abundance of the truths of faith; likewise from the connection of one
truth with another; thus is formed spiritual good with man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7761.">7761.</span></span>

A clear distinction must be made between spiritual good and natural
good. As before said, spiritual good has its quality from the truths of
faith, their abundance, and their connection; but natural good is born
with the man, and also arises by accident, as by misfortunes, diseases,
and the like. Natural good saves no one, but spiritual good saves all.
The reason is that the good which is formed through the truths of faith
is a plane into which heaven can flow, that is, the Lord through heaven,
and lead man, and withhold him from evil, and afterward uplift him into
heaven; but not so natural good; and therefore they who are in natural
good can be as easily carried away by falsity as by truth, provided the
falsity appears in the form of truth; and they can be as easily led by
evil as by good, provided the evil is presented as good. They are like
feathers in the wind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7762.">7762.</span></span>

The confidence of trust which is said to be of faith and is called
faith, is not spiritual confidence or trust, but natural. Spiritual
confidence or trust has its essence and life from the good of love; but
not from the truth of faith separate. The confidence of faith separate
is dead; and therefore there cannot be true confidence with those who
have led an evil life. Moreover, that confidence which depends on
salvation through the Lord's merit, irrespective of what the life has
been, is likewise not from truth. EXODUS 11 1. And Jehovah said unto
Moses, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt;
afterward he will let you go from hence; when he lets everything go,
driving he shall drive you out from hence. 2. Say now in the ears of the
people, and let them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her
companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold. 3. And Jehovah gave
the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses
was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants,
and in the eyes of the people. 4. And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah,
About midnight I will go out into the midst of Egypt. 5. And every
firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
about to sit upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant
that is behind the millstones; and every firstborn of beast. 6. And
there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt, such as there
hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore. 7. And to all the
sons of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, from man and even to
beast; that ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians
and Israel. 8. And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and
bow down themselves to me, saying, Get thee out, thou, and all the
people that is at thy feet; and thereafter I will go out. And he went
out from before Pharaoh in the wrath of anger. 9. And Jehovah said unto
Moses, Pharaoh will not hear you; that my wonders may be multiplied in
the land of Egypt. 10. And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before
Pharaoh; and Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let
the sons of Israel go out of his land.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7763.">7763.</span></span>

THE CONTENTS. The subject treated of in this chapter in the internal
sense is the damnation of faith separate from charity, which is
signified by the firstborn of Egypt that were given up to death at
midnight; and also the memory-knowledges of truth and good that were to
be transferred to those who are of the spiritual church, which
knowledges are signified by the vessels of silver and of gold that the
sons of Israel were to ask from the Egyptians.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7764.">7764.</span></span>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verses 1-3. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Yet one
plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterward he will
let you go from hence; when he lets everything go, driving he shall
drive you out from hence. Say now in the ears of the people, and let
them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her companion,
vessels of silver and vessels of gold. And Jehovah gave the people favor
in the eyes of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in
the land of Egypt, in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of
the people. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies instruction; "Yet
one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt," signifies
the end of vastation, which is damnation; "afterward he will let you go
from hence," signifies that then they will be left; "when he lets
everything go, driving he shall drive you out from hence," signifies
that they will leave them completely, and will hold them in aversion,
and shun their presence; "say now in the ears of the people," signifies
instruction and obedience; "and let them ask a man from his companion,
and a woman from her companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold,"
signifies that the memory-knowledges of truth and good taken away from
the evil who have been of the church, will be bestowed upon the good who
are of it; "and Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the
Egyptians," signifies the fear of those who are in evils on account of
those who are of the spiritual church, by reason of the plagues;
"moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt," signifies
respect now for truth Divine; "in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in
the eyes of the people," signifies with those who were in subordination
there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7765.">7765.</span></span>

And Jehovah said unto Moses. This signifies instruction (see n. 7186,
7267, 7304, 7380).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7766.">7766.</span></span>

Yet one plague more will I bring upon, Pharaoh, and upon Egypt. That
this signifies the end of vastation, which is damnation, is evident from
the signification of "yet one plague more," as being the last of
vastation. That by the plagues brought upon Egypt were signified
successive states of vastation, is evident from the explication of what
goes before; that the last is damnation, namely, of faith separate from
charity, will be seen from what follows; for by the firstborn given up
to death in Egypt is signified the damnation of this faith; by "death,"
the damnation itself; and by "the firstborn," faith. Faith is said to be
damned when the things of faith are applied to support falsities and
evils; and when they support these, they pass over to their side, and
become a means of confirming them. This is the case with those who both
in doctrine and in life separate faith from charity; but with these
there is no faith; there is only the memory-knowledge of such things as
are of faith, which knowledge is by them called faith. This is meant by
faith damned. Moreover, the subjects themselves in whom the things of
faith have been adjoined to falsities and evils, after vastations are in
damnation. The damnation is made sensible by the putrid and offensive
stench which exhales from them, more than from those who have not been
possessed of the things of faith. This is the case in particular as in
general; in general, if any evil spirit approaches a heavenly society
where there is charity, the stench from him is plainly perceived; in
like manner in particular where there had been such things as are of
heaven, that is, such as are of faith, and in the same subject also such
things as are of hell. From all this it is now evident that by "yet one
plague more which shall be brought upon Pharaoh and upon Egypt" is
signified the last of vastation, which is damnation; for by Pharaoh are
represented those who have infested, and who are here being damned; and
by "Egypt" is signified the natural mind (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288,
5301, 6147, 6252).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7767.">7767.</span></span>

Afterward he will let you go from hence. That this signifies that then
they will be left, is evident from the signification of "to let go," as
being to leave (as frequently above).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7768.">7768.</span></span>

When he lets everything go, driving he shall drive you out from hence.
That this signifies that they will leave them completely, and will hold
them in aversion and shun their presence, is evident from the
signification of "to let everything go," as being to leave completely;
and from the signification of "driving he shall drive you out," as being
to hold in aversion and shun those who are of the spiritual church whom
they had infested; for he who holds in aversion the presence of anyone,
also shuns his presence, and likewise drives him away from him. That
they now hold in aversion and shun those who are of the spiritual
church, is because the good and the truth which flow in, now torment
them. The case herein is like that of painful ulcers which do not endure
even the touch of warm water or a breath of air; or like that of an
injured eye which cannot bear even the mild rays of the sun. The natural
mind of such spirits is now such a sore; for after they have been
vastated, that is, after the things that had been of faith have been
rejected, they suffer at the least breath of good and truth, whence
comes aversion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7769.">7769.</span></span>

Say now in the ears of the people. That this signifies instruction and
obedience, is evident from the signification of "saying," as here being
instruction, for Jehovah now says what the sons of Israel were to do
when they departed from Egypt. Obedience is signified by "saying in the
ears," for the ears correspond to obedience, and consequently signify it
(n. 2542, 3869, 4551, 4652-4660).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7770.">7770.</span></span>

And let them ask a man from his companion, and a woman from her
companion, vessels of silver and vessels of gold. That this signifies
that the memory-knowledges of truth and good, taken away from the evil
who have been of the church, will be bestowed upon the good who are of
it, is evident from the signification of "vessels of silver and vessels
of gold," as being memory-knowledges of truth and good. (That "silver"
denotes truth, and "gold" good, see n. 1551, 1552, 2954, 5658, 6112; and
that "vessels" denote memory-knowledges, n. 3068, 3079.)
Memory-knowledges are called vessels of truth and good, because they
contain them. It is believed that the memory-knowledges of truth and
good are the very truths and goods of faith; but they are not. It is the
affections of truth and good that make faith, and these flow into
memory-knowledges, as into their vessels. That to ask these things of
the Egyptians denotes to take them away and adjudge them to themselves,
is plain; hence in a previous chapter (3) it is said that they should
"spoil the Egyptians" (verse 22); and in the chapter which follows (12),
that they "spoiled them." Its being said that "a man should ask of his
companion and a woman of her companion," is because "man" relates to
truth, and "woman" to good, as they also signify them. \[2\] How the
case herein is, see the explication at Exodus 3:22, n. 6914-6917, from
which it can be seen that the very memory-knowledges of truth and good
which have been possessed by those of the church who have known the
arcana of faith and yet have lived a life of evil, are transferred to
those who are of the spiritual church. (How this transfer is effected,
see n. 6914.) These things are signified by the Lord's words in Matthew:
The Lord said unto him who went away and hid his talent in the earth,
Take ye the talent from him, and give it to him that hath the ten
talents. For unto everyone that hath shall be given, that he may have
abundance; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be
taken away; and cast ye the useless servant into the outer darkness
(Matt. 25:25, 28-30; and Luke 19:24-26). Whosoever hath, to him shall be
given, and he shall have abundance; but whosoever hath not, from him
shall be taken away even that which he hath (Matt. 13:12; and Mark
4:24-25). \[3\] The reason is that with the evil the knowledges of good
and truth are applied to evil uses, and with the good the knowledges of
good and truth are applied to good uses; the knowledges are the same,
but the application to uses effects their quality with each person. The
case herein is like that of worldly riches, which with one person are
disposed for good uses, with another for evil uses; consequently riches
are such with each person as are the uses unto which they are disposed.
From this also it is evident that the same knowledges, like the same
riches, which the evil had possessed, can be with the good and serve for
good uses. From all this it can now be seen what is represented by the
command that the sons of Israel should ask from the Egyptians vessels of
silver and vessels of gold, and should thus deprive and despoil them;
such seizure or despoiling would never have been commanded by Jehovah
unless it had represented such things in the spiritual world. \[4\]
Similar to this is what is written in Isaiah: At last the merchandise of
Tyre, and her meretricious hire, shall be holiness to Jehovah; and it
shall not be stored up nor kept back; but her merchandise shall be for
them that dwell before Jehovah to eat, to sate themselves, and for the
ancient one in covering himself (Isa. 23:18); speaking of Tyre, by which
are signified the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1201); "merchandise"
and "meretricious hire" denote knowledges applied to evil uses; that
these should be given to the good who will apply them to good uses, is
signified by "her merchandise being for them that dwell before Jehovah
to eat to sate themselves, and for the ancient one in covering himself."
\[5\] Also in Micah: Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will
make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; that thou mayest
break in pieces many peoples; and I have devoted their gain to Jehovah,
and their wealth to the Lord of the whole earth (Micah 4:13); "to break
in pieces many peoples" denotes to devastate them; the "gain which is
devoted to Jehovah and to the Lord of the whole earth" denotes the
knowledges of truth and good. That David sanctified to Jehovah the
silver and the gold that he had taken from the nations which he had
subdued, from the Syrians, from Moab, from the sons of Ammon, from the
Philistines, from Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer (2 Sam.
8:11-12); and that Solomon put the sanctified things of his father among
the treasures of the house of Jehovah (1 Kings 7:51) involve the like.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7771.">7771.</span></span>

And Jehovah gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. That
this signifies the fear of those who are in evils on account of those
who are of the spiritual church by reason of the plagues, is evident
from what was unfolded above (n. 6914), where are like words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7772.">7772.</span></span>

Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt. That this
signifies respect now for truth Divine, is evident from the
representation of Moses, as being truth Divine (of which frequently
above); from the signification of "very great," as being respect, here
respect from fear, for the evil who are in hell have no other respect
for the Divine than that of fear (that "very great" denotes respect, is
manifest, for it is said "in the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the
eyes of the people"); and from the signification of "the land of Egypt,"
as being the natural mind (see n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301, 6147,
6252). From this it is evident that by "the man Moses was very great in
the land of Egypt," is signified respect for truth Divine in the mind,
namely, in that of the infesters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7773.">7773.</span></span>

In the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people. That
this signifies, with those who were in subordination there, is evident
from the signification of "servants" and of "people," as being those who
are subordinate; for by Pharaoh are represented the chief ones who
infested, under whom the rest were subordinate. That the subordinate are
signified is because among the evil as well as among the good, that is,
in hell as in heaven, there is a form of government, that is, there is
rule, and there is subordination, without which society would have no
coherence. But the subordinations in heaven are wholly different from
the subordinations in hell. In heaven all are like equals, for one loves
another as brother loves brother; nevertheless one sets another before
himself in proportion as he excels in intelligence and wisdom. The very
love of good and truth causes everyone, as it were of himself, to
subordinate himself to those who are superior to him in the wisdom of
good and the intelligence of truth. But the subordinations in hell are
those of despotic authority, and consequently of severity; for he who
commands rages fiercely against those who do not favor all his commands;
for everyone regards another as his enemy, although outwardly as a
friend, for the sake of banding together against the violence of others.
This banding together is like that of robbers. They who are subordinate
continually aspire to rule, and also frequently break forth in revolt,
and then the conditions there are lamentable, for then there are
severities and cruelties and this takes place by alternations. From all
this it can be seen how the case is with subordinations in the other
life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7774.">7774.</span></span>

Verses 4-8. And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah, About midnight I will go
out into the midst of Egypt. And every firstborn in the land of Egypt
shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne,
even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the
millstones; and every firstborn of beast. And there shall be a great cry
in the whole land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor
shall be like it anymore. And to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog
move his tongue, from man and even to beast; that ye may know that
Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and Israel. And all these
thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves to me,
saying, Get thee out, and all the people that is at thy feet; and
thereafter I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in the wrath of
anger. "And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah," signifies instruction;
"About midnight," signifies when the devastation is total; "I will go
out into the midst of Egypt," signifies the presence of the Divine then
everywhere; "and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die,"
signifies the damnation then of faith separate from charity; "from the
firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne," signifies the
falsified truths of faith which are in the first place; "even to the
firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the millstones," signifies
the falsified truths of faith which are in the last place; "and every
first-born of beast" signifies the adulterated goods of faith; "and
there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt," signifies
interior lamentation; "such as there hath been none like it, nor shall
be like it anymore" signifies that the state was such that there could
not be any like it; "and to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog move
his tongue," signifies that among those who were of the spiritual church
there should not be the least of damnation and lamentation; "from man
and even to beast," signifies neither as to truth nor as to good; "that
ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and
Israel," signifies that it may be known what is the nature of the
difference between those who are in evil and those who are in good; "and
all these thy servants shall come down unto me," signifies those who are
subordinate; "and bow down themselves to me," signifies respect from
fear on account of truth Divine; "saying, Get thee out, and all the
people that is at thy feet," signifies supplication that they may depart
from those who are in truth from the Divine, from the highest to the
lowest; "and thereafter I will go out," signifies that truth Divine will
depart; "and he went out from before Pharaoh in the wrath of anger,"
signifies the rending asunder of the presence of truth Divine from those
who are about to be damned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7775.">7775.</span></span>

And Moses said, Thus said Jehovah. This signifies instruction (as above,
n. 7765).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7776.">7776.</span></span>

About midnight. That this signifies when the devastation is total; is
evident from the signification of "midnight," as being when the thick
darkness is most dense, that is, when there is mere falsity; for "night"
signifies a state of falsity (n. 2353, 6000), and the middle of it
denotes the highest; thus "midnight" denotes total devastation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7777.">7777.</span></span>

I will go out into the midst of Egypt. That this signifies the presence
of the Divine then everywhere, is evident from the signification of
"going out through the midst," when said of Jehovah, as being the
presence of the Divine. When "the midst" is predicated of land it
signifies everywhere; for "to go out through the midst of Egypt" denotes
into every part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7778.">7778.</span></span>

And every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die. That this signifies
the damnation of faith separate from charity, is evident from the
signification of "dying," as being damnation (see n. 5407, 6119); and
from the signification of "firstborn," as being the faith of the church
through which is charity (n. 352, 2435, 6344, 7035); but the "firstborn
in the land of Egypt" denotes faith without charity (of which above, n.
7766). \[2\] As regards faith without charity, it is to be said further
that faith without charity is not faith, but only the memory-knowledge
of such things as are of faith; for the truths of faith look to charity
as their ultimate end, and afterward proceed from charity as their first
end. From this it is manifest that those things which are of faith have
no existence with those who are not in charity, and yet it is known that
the memory-knowledge of the truths of faith does exist with them. This
memory-knowledge is that which they call faith. And when the
memory-knowledges of the truth and good of faith are applied by them to
confirm falsities and evils, then the truths and goods of faith no
longer exist with them, because the truths and goods give assent to the
falsities and evils which they serve, for then those very falsities and
evils which they confirm are seen in them. \[3\] Those things which are
of genuine faith look upward to heaven and to the Lord; but those which
are of faith separate from charity look downward, and when they confirm
evils and falsities they look toward hell. From this also it is evident
that faith separate from charity is not faith. From all this it can be
seen what is meant by the damnation of faith separate from charity,
namely, that it is the damnation of the falsified truth and adulterated
good of faith; for when good has been falsified it is no longer truth
but falsity, and when good has been adulterated it is no longer good but
evil; and faith itself is no longer the faith of truth and good, but of
falsity and evil, no matter how it may appear and sound in the outward
form. And (what is a secret) the quality of everyone's faith is such as
is the quality of his life. If therefore the life has been damned, so
also has the faith; for it is the faith of falsity when the life is a
life of evil. That this is so does not appear in the world, but it is
clearly shown in the other life when the evil there are being deprived
of the memory-knowledge of truth and good, for then the falsities from
evils which had lain hidden within them, come forth. \[4\] With some of
the evil there is a persuasion that the truth of faith is truth, which
persuasion is also supposed to be faith, but is not faith; for it is
impressed from this end, that it may serve as a means of securing gain,
honors, and reputation. So long as these truths serve as means, they are
loved for the sake of the end, which is evil; but when they no longer so
serve, they are left behind, nay, they are regarded as falsities. This
persuasion is what is called "persuasive faith," and is what is meant by
the words of the Lord in Matthew: Many will say to Me in that day, Lord,
Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name have cast out
demons, and in Thy name done many mighty works? But then will I confess
unto them, I know you not; depart from Me ye that work iniquity (Matt.
7:22-23). The same faith is also meant by the "lamps without oil" with
the five foolish virgins, who also said, "Lord, Lord, open to us. But He
answering said, Verily I say to you, I know you not" (Matt. 25:11-12);
by "lamps" are signified the truths of faith, and by "oil" the good of
charity; thus by "lamps without oil," the truths of faith without the
good of charity.

From the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne. That this
signifies the falsified truths of faith which are in the first place, is
evident from the signification of "the firstborn," as being faith (see
n. 352, 2435, 6344, 7035); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being
memory-knowledge in general perverting the truths of the church (n.
6015, 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692), thus "the firstborn of Pharaoh" denotes
the faith of such, consequently the faith of the falsified truths of
faith; and from the signification of "throne," as being the reign of
truth, and in the opposite sense, the reign of falsity (see n. 5313).
That the falsified truths of faith which are in the first place are
meant by "the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne" is
evident from the fact that it is said "even to the firstborn of the
maidservant that is behind the millstones," by which are signified the
falsified truths of faith which are in the last place; and moreover, the
son of a king is what comes first, because a king is the head. \[2\]
Falsified truths in the first place are those which are acknowledged as
essentials, such as these: that faith saves howsoever a man has lived;
that it saves man in the last hour of his life; and that he then is pure
from sins; thus that sins are wiped away in a moment, like the
uncleanness of the hands by water; which insist that there is faith
without charity, and that in respect to man's salvation the life effects
nothing, also that a man-devil can in a moment be made an angel of God.
Such and the like are falsified truths in the first place. Those which
are thence next derived are in the second place. Those which are
remotely derived are in the last place. For the derivations of every
truth are ample, and in a long series, some of which enter directly,
some indirectly; those which only touch being the last. \[3\] That such
and the like are falsified truths of faith, is very evident; for who
does not know, if he thinks justly, that the life of faith causes a man
to be spiritual, but not faith except insofar as it has been implanted
in the life. The life of man is his love, and that which he loves he
wills and intends, and that which he wills and intends, he does. This is
the being of man, but not that which he knows and thinks and does not
will. This being of man cannot in any wise be changed into another being
by thinking about mediation and salvation; but by regeneration anew,
which is being effected during a great part of his life; for he must be
conceived, born, and grown up anew; and this is not effected by thinking
and speaking, but by willing and acting. \[4\] These things are said
because by the "firstborn of Pharaoh," and the "firstborn of the
Egyptians," is signified faith separated from charity, which has been
shown in what precedes not to be faith, but the memory-knowledge of such
things as are of faith. The firstborn of the Egyptians represented this
faith because the Egyptians were versed in the knowledge of rituals of
the church above the rest who constituted the representative church
after the time of the flood (see n. 4749, 4964, 4966, 6004). At that
time all rites were representative of the spiritual things which are in
heaven. The Egyptians had more knowledge of these things than others,
but in process of time they began to love the knowledges alone, and
then, in like manner as is done at this day, to make everything of the
church consist in the knowledge of such things as are of the church, and
no longer in the life of charity. Thus they inverted the whole order of
the church, which being inverted, the truths which are called truths of
faith could not but be falsified; for the truths which are applied
contrary to Divine order (as is the case when they are applied to evils,
and among the Egyptians to magic) are no longer truths with them, but
become falsities from the evils to which they are applied. \[5\] To
illustrate this by the worship of a calf among the Egyptians. They knew
what a calf represented, namely, the good of charity; so long as they
knew this and thought this, when they saw calves, or when they prepared
calves in feasts of charity such as the ancients held, and afterward
when calves were applied in sacrifices, they then thought sanely and
together with the angels in heaven, to whom a calf is the good of
charity. But when they began to make calves of gold, and to place them
in their temples and worship them, they then thought insanely and
together with the infernals; and in this way they inverted a true
representative into a false representative.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7780.">7780.</span></span>

Even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the
millstones. That this signifies the falsified truths of faith which are
in the last place, is evident from the signification of "firstborn," as
being faith (of which just above, n. 7779), and because it denotes
faith, it denotes truth in the complex, for truth is of faith because it
is to be believed; and from the signification of "maidservant," as being
the exterior affection of truth, or the affection of memory-knowledges
(n. 1895, 2567, 3835, 3849). But a "maidservant behind the millstones"
denotes the most external affection of memory-knowledges, for by "behind
the millstones" is signified what is in the last place. It is said
"behind the millstones" because a "millstone" is predicated of those
things which are of faith; for by millstones grain is ground into flour,
and is thus prepared for bread; and by "flour" is signified the truth
from which is good, and by "bread" that very good which is thence
derived. Thus "to sit at the millstones" is to learn and be imbued with
such things as may be serviceable to faith, and through faith to
charity. For this reason the ancients, when they described the first
rudiments of the doctrine of faith, described them by "sitting at the
millstones," and the things which were still more rudimentary by
"sitting behind the millstones." Because of such a signification, the
Lord, where He teaches about the last time of the church, says: Two
women shall be grinding at the mill, the one shall be taken and the
other left (Matt. 24:41), which would never have been said unless a
"mill" had signified those things which are of faith. (What a "mill" and
"grinding" mean in the internal sense, see n. 4335.) As to the truths of
faith which are in the first place, and those which are in the last, be
it known that those truths of faith which immediately proceed from the
good of charity are what are in the first place, for they are goods in
form; but the truths which are in the last place are naked truths; for
when truths are successively derived, they recede at each step from
good, and finally become naked truths. Such truths are signified by
"maidservants behind the millstones."

<span class="margnote"><span id="7781.">7781.</span></span>

And every firstborn of beast. That this signifies the adulterated goods
of faith, is evident from the signification of "firstborn," as being
faith; and from the signification of "beast," as being the affections of
good, and in the opposite sense the affections of evil (see n. 45, 46,
142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 776, 2179, 2180, 3519, 5198). That
"beasts" have this signification is from the representatives in the
other life (n. 3218). Therefore also such things were signified by them
in sacrifices (n. 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3519). As "beasts" had this
signification, therefore by "the firstborn of beast" is signified the
good of truth, in this case adulterated, because belonging to the
Egyptians, who perverted all truths and goods by applications to evil
uses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7782.">7782.</span></span>

And there shall be a great cry in the whole land of Egypt. That this
signifies interior lamentation, is evident from the signification of a
"cry" (here made on account of the dead firstborn, in the internal sense
on account of damnation), as being lamentation. That "a great cry"
denotes interior lamentation, is because the greater the lamentation is,
the more interior it is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7783.">7783.</span></span>

Such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it anymore. That
this signifies that the state was such that there could not be any like
it, can be seen from what has been unfolded above (n. 7649, 7686).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7784.">7784.</span></span>

And to all the sons of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue. That this
signifies that among those who are of the spiritual church there shall
not be the least of damnation and lamentation, is evident from the
representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the
spiritual church (n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201,
7215, 7223); and from the signification of "a dog not moving his
tongue," as being that there shall not be the least of damnation and
lamentation; for this statement is opposed to the "great cry which shall
be in the land of Egypt," which denotes interior lamentation (n. 7782),
and this on account of the damnation signified by the death of the
firstborn. \[2\] By those who are of the spiritual church (that is, who
are in the good of this church) not having the least of damnation, is
not to be understood that they are devoid of all evil; but that they are
withheld from evil in good by the Lord. That which is their own is
nothing but what is evil and damned; but that which is the Lord's own
and which they receive is good, consequently is devoid of all damnation.
Thus it is meant that there is nothing of damnation with those who are
in the Lord. \[3\] Its being said that "a dog shall not move his tongue"
is on account of the signification of a "dog." A "dog" signifies the
lowest of all, or those who are of small value in the church, likewise
those who are outside of the church, also those who prate much about the
things of the church and understand little; and in the opposite sense,
those who are altogether outside of the faith of the church and treat
with contumely the things of faith. That "dogs" signify those who are
outside of the church, is evident in Matthew: Jesus said unto the Greek
woman, a Syrophoenician, It is not good to take the children's bread and
cast it to the dogs. But she said, Surely Lord; but even the little dogs
eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table. Then Jesus
answering said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee as
thou wilt; and her daughter <span id="fr_160"></span>[7784-1](#fn_160.md)
was healed (Matt. 15:26-28; Mark 7:27-28); where by "children" are meant
those who are within the church, and by "dogs" those who are outside of
it. In like manner by the "dogs which licked the sores of Lazarus" (Luke
16:21); for by the "rich man" there, in the internal sense, is meant one
who is within the church and consequently abounds spiritual riches,
which are the knowledges of truth and good. "Dogs" denote those who are
in the lowest place within the church, who prate much about the things
of the church and understand little, and in the opposite sense, those
who treat with contumely the things of faith, in these passages: His
watchmen are all blind, they do not know; they are all dumb dogs, they
cannot bark; looking on, lying down, loving to sleep (Isa. 56:10). They
are noisy like a dog, they go round about in the city; for they belch
with their mouth; swords are in their lips (Ps. 59:6-7, 14). That thy
foot may stamp in blood, the tongue of thy dogs . . . (Ps. 68:23). Give
not that which is holy to the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before
the swine, lest haply they trample them with their feet, and turn and
rend you (Matt. 7:6). For this reason the vilest of all things, which
was to be cast away, is signified by a "dead dog" (1 Sam. 24:14; 2 Sam.
9:8; 16:9).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7785.">7785.</span></span>

From man and even to beast. That this signifies neither as to truth nor
as to good, is evident from the signification of "man," as being truth
(see n. 3134); and from the signification of "beast," as being the
affection of good, thus good (of which just above, n. 7781).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7786.">7786.</span></span>

That ye may know that Jehovah doth separate between the Egyptians and
Israel. That this signifies that it may be known what is the difference
between those who are in evil and those who are in good, is evident from
the signification of "knowing," as being to be known; from the
representation of the Egyptians, as being those who are in evil (by "the
Egyptians" were before signified those who are in falsity, but now,
after they have been vastated in respect to the truths of the church
which they knew, they signify those who are in evil, for by the death of
the firstborn is signified damnation, which is a state of evil); and
from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of
the spiritual church (see above, n. 7784), thus those who are in good;
for they who are of the spiritual church are led by means of faith to
charity, thus by means of truth to good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7787.">7787.</span></span>

And all these thy servants shall come down unto me. That this signifies
those who are subordinate, is evident from the signification of
"Pharaoh's servants," as being those who are subordinate (of which
above, n. 7773).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7788.">7788.</span></span>

And bow down themselves to me. That this signifies respect from fear on
account of truth Divine, is evident from the representation of Moses, as
being truth Divine (of which frequently above); from the signification
of "bowing down themselves," as being humiliation; but here, because it
is said of those who are in evil, it denotes respect from fear. It is
said "respect from fear," because the evil have not any respect for
truth Divine, not even for the Divine Itself, except that which they
have from fear; for they who are in hell love themselves alone, and
those who love themselves alone have no respect for anyone else, because
they turn toward themselves all respect for others, even for the Divine
Itself. Where love is, there is respect; where love is not, there is no
respect except that which is from fear. For this reason the evil in the
other life undergo punishments, until at last they do not venture to
rise up against the good and infest them; for they are deterred from
doing evil by no other means than the fear of punishments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7789.">7789.</span></span>

Saying, Get thee out, and all the people that is at thy feet. That this
signifies supplication that those may depart who are in truth from the
Divine, from the highest to the lowest, is evident from the
signification of "going out," as being to depart; from the
representation of Moses, who is here meant by "thee," as being truth
Divine; from the signification of "people," as being those who are in
truth from the Divine; for by the sons of Israel, who are here "the
people," are represented those who are of the spiritual church, thus who
are in the truth of good and in the good of truth, here those who are in
the truth from the Divine, because it is said "the people who are at thy
feet," for by Moses is represented truth Divine; and from the
signification of "at thy feet," as being those who are beneath, thus who
are subordinate. For the "feet" signify lower because natural things,
because the natural world is beneath the spiritual world (that the
"feet" signify natural things see n. 2162, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952);
and for this reason it is said, "the people who are at thy feet." From
the highest to the lowest is also signified; by "Moses" the highest,
because he represents truth Divine; by "the people at his feet," all and
each of those who are in truth from the Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7790.">7790.</span></span>

And thereafter I will go out. That this signifies that truth Divine will
depart, is evident from the signification of "going out," as being to
depart; and from the representation of Moses, as being truth Divine.
These things signify that when those who have infested the upright are
damned, all truth Divine departs from them; for they are then in the
state of their evil, and evil rejects and extinguishes all truth Divine.
Heretofore, previous to their damnation, they were indeed acquainted
with the truths of faith; but nevertheless they had no truths in them;
for truths were then in their mouth, but not in the heart; and therefore
when they have been vastated as to these truths, evil remains, and then
also the falsity of evil comes forth to view which had lain hidden
within them; for although they had professed truths, they were
nevertheless not in truths, but in falsities. Moreover, the very
profession of truth did not descend from its own beginning, namely, from
good; but from evil; for they had made it for the sake of gain, honors,
and reputation, thus for the sake of themselves and the world. The
truths which descend from such a beginning adhere on the surface, and
therefore when they are being vastated the truths fall off like scales,
and when they fall off, they leave places that are foul-smelling and
putrid from the falsities which exhale from the evils there. Such is the
lot of those who have known the truths of faith, and yet have lived
contrary to them, according to the Lord's words in Luke: That servant
who knoweth his Lord's will, but maketh not himself ready, nor doeth his
will, shall be beaten with many stripes; but he that knoweth not, though
he do things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few (Luke
12:47-48).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7791.">7791.</span></span>

And he went out from before Pharaoh in the wrath of anger. That this
signifies the rending asunder of the presence of truth Divine from those
about to be damned, is evident from the signification of "going out," as
being to depart, here to be rent asunder, because it is said "in the
wrath of anger;" moreover, at the last when damnation takes place, there
is a rending asunder; for when they begin to hold truth Divine in
aversion, and also to fear it, and finally to feel horror at its
presence, they rend themselves asunder from it; from the representation
of Moses, as being truth Divine (of which frequently above); from the
representation of Pharaoh, as being those who had infested those who are
of the spiritual church (of which also frequently above), but in the
present case those who are about to be damned, for damnation is
signified by the firstborn being given up to death (see n. 7778); and
from the signification of "the wrath of anger," as being repugnance and
aversion (see n. 3614, 5034, 5798), and when attributed to the Divine,
as here to the Divine truth which is represented by Moses, it is not
meant that the Divine turns itself away, but that they who are in evil
turn themselves away (see n. 5798). "Wrath" is predicated of falsity,
and "anger" of evil (n. 3614).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7792.">7792.</span></span>

Verses 9, 10. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh will not hear you;
that My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. And Moses and
Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and Jehovah made firm the
heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his
land. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies information; "Pharaoh
will not hear you," signifies no obedience; "that My wonders may be
multiplied in the land of Egypt," signifies that they may be confirmed
in the fact that they were in no faith, but in evil; "and Moses and
Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh," signifies that these
vastations, and the consequent confirmations that they were in evil,
were effected by means of truth proceeding from the Divine; "and Jehovah
made firm the heart of Pharaoh," signifies that they were determined;
"and he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land," signifies
that they did not leave those who were of the spiritual church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7793.">7793.</span></span>

And Jehovah said unto Moses. That this signifies information, is evident
from the signification of "saying," when Jehovah foretells what shall be
done, as being information.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7794.">7794.</span></span>

Pharaoh will not hear you. That this signifies no obedience, is evident
from the signification of "to hear," as being obedience (n. 2542, 3869,
4652-4660, 5017, 7216); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being
those who have infested the upright in the other life, and who are now
about to be damned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7795.">7795.</span></span>

That My wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. That this
signifies that it may be confirmed that they had been in no faith, but
in evil, is evident from the signification of the "wonders" and "signs"
that were done in Egypt, as being vastations and consequent
confirmations that they were evil (n. 7633); for these "wonders"
signified so many degrees of the vastation of those who within the
church had been in the memory-knowledge of such things as are of faith,
and yet had lived evilly; and because these are they who infest the
upright in the other life, it is their state now which is here signified
(n. 7465). By these "wonders being multiplied" are signified the
successive degrees of their states. The reason why there are so many
degrees is in order that the evil may be confirmed in the fact that they
are in evil; and also that the good may be enlightened concerning the
state of those within the church who have lived evilly (n. 7633). Except
for these reasons, the evil might be condemned and let down into hell
without so many successive changes of states. \[2\] That before the evil
are condemned and let down into hell they undergo so many states is
altogether unknown in the world. It is believed that man is at once
either condemned or saved, and that this is effected without any
process; but the case is otherwise. Justice reigns there, and no one is
condemned until he himself knows, and is inwardly convinced, that he is
in evil, and that it is utterly impossible for him to be in heaven. His
own evils are also laid open to him, according to the words of the Lord
in Luke: There is nothing covered up, that shall not be revealed; or
hidden, that shall not be known. Wherefore whatsoever ye have said in
the darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken
in the ear in the bed chambers shall be proclaimed upon the housetops
(Luke 12:2-3; Matt. 10:26-27; Mark 4:22); and what is more, he is also
warned to desist from evil; but when he cannot do this because of the
dominion of evil, the power is then taken away from him of doing evil by
falsifications of truth and pretenses of good, which is effected
successively from one degree to another, and finally condemnation
follows and the letting down into hell. This takes place when he comes
into the evil of his life. \[3\] The evil of the life is evil of the
will and of the thought thence derived; thus it is the man's inward
quality and what would be his quality outwardly if he were not hindered
by the laws, and likewise by fears of the loss of gain, of honor, of
reputation, and of life. This is the life which follows every man after
death, but not the outward life, except that which proceeds from the
inward life; for in outward things a man pretends what is contrary; and
therefore when a man after death is being vastated in respect to outward
things, it then plainly appears what had been his quality both in will
and in thought. To this state every evil person is reduced by means of
degrees of vastation, for all vastation in the other life advances from
outward to inward things. From all this it can be seen what is the
nature of the justice in the other life, and what the nature of the
process before an evil person is condemned. From this it is evident that
by "My wonders being multiplied in the land of Egypt," is signified that
the evil may be confirmed in the fact that they have been in no faith,
but in evil. (That they who are in evil have no faith, see above, n.
7778.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="7796.">7796.</span></span>

And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh. That this
signifies that these vastations, and the consequent confirmations that
they were in evil, were effected by means of truth from the Divine, is
evident from the representation of Moses and Aaron, as being truth
Divine, Moses the truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine, and
Aaron the truth which proceeds mediately (see n. 7010, 7089, 7382); and
from the signification of the "wonders done in Egypt" or "before
Pharaoh," as being so many vastations of those who had been of the
church and had lived evilly. That the "wonders of Egypt" have this
signification can be seen from the signification of the several wonders;
that they are also confirmations that they are not in faith but in evil,
see just above (n. 7795). It is said that "Moses and Aaron did these
wonders," when yet they were not done by them, but by the Divine; but it
is so said because by Moses and Aaron is represented truth Divine, and
the wonders were wrought by the Divine by means of truth proceeding from
Itself; for all things which are done by the Divine Itself are done by
means of truth proceeding from Itself; the Divine Itself is the being
\[esse\] of all things, whereas the truth proceeding from It is the
derivative manifestation \[existere\] of all things; Good Itself, which
is the Divine Esse, produces all things by means of its truth. It is
said that vastations are effected by means of truth from the Divine, but
it is to be understood that Divine truth is not the cause, for the
Divine vastates no one; but the evil person vastates himself by
rendering himself determined against truth Divine, extinguishing,
rejecting, or perverting it; and by turning the good Divine which
continually flows in, into evil. This evil then is that which vastates,
and from this it is evident whence the cause is, namely, that the influx
of good and of truth from the Divine is not the cause, for without the
influx of these there is no life; but the cause is their conversion into
evil and falsity, which is done by him who is in evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7797.">7797.</span></span>

And Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh. That this signifies that
they were determined, is evident from the signification of "making firm
the heart," as being to be determined (see n. 7272, 7300, 7305. That
Jehovah does not make firm the heart, or do evil, although this is
attributed to Him in the sense of the letter of the Word, see n. 7533,
7632, 7643).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7798.">7798.</span></span>

And he did not let the sons of Israel go out of his land. That this
signifies that they did not leave those who were of the spiritual
church, is evident from the signification of "to let go," as being to
leave; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those
who are of the spiritual church (see n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035,
7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7799.">7799.</span></span>

ON THE SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET JUPITER. Social interaction
with the spirits and angels of the planet Jupiter has been granted me a
longer time than with the spirits of the other planets, and therefore
more particulars are to be related concerning their state, and that of
the inhabitants of this planet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7800.">7800.</span></span>

The planet Jupiter does not indeed appear to those who are in the other
life; but the spirits who are from it. These appear in front, to the
left, at some distance, and this constantly; there also the planet is in
the idea of spirits and angels. The spirits of each planet are separate
from those of other planets, and are near their own world. The reason
why they are separated is that they are of a different disposition, and
are in a different province in the Grand Man; and they who are of a
different disposition appear remote from others according to the
diversity. All separation and distinction of spirits and angels in
respect to places and distances in the other life, appear in accordance
with the diversities of dispositions and genius, for place corresponds
to state (see n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, 5605, 7381).
