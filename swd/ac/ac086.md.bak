### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="4251.">4251.</span></span>

And he said, If Esau come to the one camp, and smite it, then there will
be a camp left for escape. That this signifies according to every event
is evident from the signification of a "camp" as being order (as just
above); from the signification of "smiting" as being to destroy; and
from the signification of "there will be a camp left for escape" as
being that order should not perish in the natural, but that something
should remain; and thus that there should be preparation and disposal in
accordance with every event. For so long as truth has the dominion in
the natural, it cannot see what is genuine truth and what not genuine,
nor what is good; but when the good which is of love to the Lord and of
charity toward the neighbor has the dominion therein, then it sees this;
and hence it is that when that time or state is at hand in which good
takes the dominion, the man is almost in ignorance of what good and
truth are, and thus of what is to be destroyed and what retained-as is
plainly manifest in temptations. When a man is in such ignorance, then
are made preparation and disposal, not by the man, but by the Lord; in
the present case, by the Lord in Himself, because the Lord by His own
power disposed and reduced all things in Himself into Divine order.

Verses 9-12. And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
father Isaac, O Jehovah, that saith unto me, Return unto thy land, and
to thy birth, and I will do well with thee; I am less than all the
mercies, and all the truth which Thou hast done with Thy servant; for in
my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am in two camps. Rescue me
I pray from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear
him, lest he come and smite me, the mother upon the sons. And thou
saidst, I will surely do well with thee, and I will make thy seed as the
sand of the sea, which is not numbered for multitude. "And Jacob said, O
God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah"
signifies the holy of preparation and disposal; "that saith unto me,
Return unto thy land, and to thy birth, and I will do well with thee"
signifies for conjunction with Divine good and truth; "I am less than
all the mercies, and all the truth, which Thou hast done with Thy
servant" signifies humiliation in that state as to good and as to truth;
"for in my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am in two camps"
signifies that from little there was now much. "Rescue me I pray from
the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him" signifies
the state relatively, because it made itself prior; "lest he come and
smite me, the mother upon the sons" signifies that it is about to
perish; "and thou saidst, I will surely do well with thee" signifies
that nevertheless it would then obtain life; "and I will make thy seed
as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered for multitude" signifies
that there would then be fructification and multiplication. 4252a. And
Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O
Jehovah. That this signifies the holy of preparation and disposal, is
evident from the signification of "God of my father Abraham," as being
the Divine Itself of the Lord (see n. 3439); and from the signification
of "God of my father Isaac," as being His Divine Human (n. 3704, 4180).
And because each is Jehovah, it is said, "O God of my father Abraham,
and God of my father Isaac, O Jehovah." But here is signified the holy
which proceeds from the Divine, for all the holy is therefrom. That the
holy is signified is because it was in the natural which is represented
by Jacob wherein the good represented by Esau was not yet conjoined with
truth. For the subject is now the state of the reception of good; here,
the state of preparation and disposal for its being received. Jacob's
supplication involves nothing else; and therefore by these words is
signified the holy of preparation and disposal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4253.">4253.</span></span>

That saith unto me, Return unto thy land, and to thy birth, and I will
do well with thee. That this signifies conjunction with Divine good and
truth, is evident from what was said before (n. 4069, 4070), where are
nearly the same words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4254.">4254.</span></span>

I am less than all the mercies, and all the truth, which Thou hast done
with Thy servant. That this signifies humiliation in that state as to
good and as to truth, is evident from "mercy" being predicated of the
good of love, and from "truth" being predicated of the truth of faith
(see n. 3122). That these are words of humiliation is manifest, and from
this it is evident that by them is signified humiliation in that state
as to good and as to truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4255.">4255.</span></span>

For in my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am in two camps.
That this signifies that from little there was much, is evident from the
signification of a "staff," as being power, and as being predicated of
truth (see n. 4013, 4015); from the signification of "Jordan," as being
initiation into the knowledges of good and truth, concerning which in
what follows; and from the signification of "two camps," as being goods
and truths (see above, n. 4250); for the two camps here are the people,
the flock, the herd, and the camels, which he halved. From this it is
evident what is signified by these words in the proximate sense, namely,
that he who is represented by Jacob had but little truth when he was
being initiated into knowledges, and that he afterwards had many truths
and goods; or what is the same, that from little he had much. From the
explications already given, it is manifest that in the internal sense
the subject treated of has been the Lord, how He made the human in
Himself Divine-and this by successive steps according to order-and thus
His progress into intelligence and wisdom, and at last into what was
Divine. From this is manifest what is meant by "from little to much."
\[2\] That the "Jordan" denotes initiation into the knowledges of good
and truth, is because it was a boundary of the land of Canaan. That all
the boundaries of that land signified things that are first and last of
the Lord's kingdom, and those also that are first and last of His
church, and thus those that are first and last of the celestial and
spiritual things which constitute His kingdom and His church, may be
seen above (n. 1585, 1866, 4116, 4240). Hence the Jordan, because it was
a boundary, signified initiation into the knowledges of good and truth,
for these are first; and at last, when the man becomes a church, or a
kingdom of the Lord, they become last. \[3\] That the "Jordan" signifies
these things is also evident from other passages in the Word, as in
David: O my God, my soul is bowed down upon me, therefore will I
remember thee from the land of Jordan and of the Hermons, from the
mountain of littleness (Ps. 42:6); "to remember from the land of Jordan"
denotes from what is last, thus from what is low. Again: Judah became
His sanctuary, Israel His dominion; the sea saw it and fled, Jordan
turned itself away backwards (Ps. 114:2-3, 5); where "Judah" denotes the
good of celestial love, and "Israel" the good of spiritual love (n.
3654); the "sea" denotes the knowledges of truth (n. 28); "Jordan" the
knowledges of good, which are said to "turn themselves backwards" when
the good of love obtains the dominion; for then knowledges are regarded
from this good, but not good from them-according to what has been often
shown above. \[4\] In the book of Judges: Gilead dwelleth in the passage
of the Jordan; and Dan, why shall he fear ships? (Judg. 5:17); "Gilead"
denotes sensuous good, or pleasure, by which man is first initiated when
being regenerated (n. 4117, 4124); "to dwell in the passage of the
Jordan" denotes in those things which are for initiation, and which are
thus the first and the last of the church and kingdom of the Lord. These
were also represented by the Jordan when the sons of Israel entered into
the land of Canaan (Josh. 3:14-17; 4:1-24). For by the land of Canaan
was represented the kingdom of the Lord (n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 3038,
3481, 3686, 3705). And by the Jordan's being divided, and their passing
over on dry ground, was signified the removal of evils and falsities,
and the admission of those who are in goods and truths. Similar is the
meaning of the waters of the Jordan being divided by Elijah when he was
taken up into heaven (2 Kings 2:8); and by Elisha when he entered upon
the prophetic office in Elijah's place (2 Kings 2:14). \[5\] Naaman's
being healed of his leprosy by washing himself seven times in the Jordan
according to the command of Elisha (2 Kings 5:1-14), represented
baptism; for baptism signifies initiation into the church and into those
things which are of the church; thus regeneration and the things of
regeneration. Not that anyone is regenerated by baptism, but that this
is the sign of it, which he should remember. And as the things of the
church are signified by baptism, and the same by the Jordan, as stated
above, the people were therefore baptized in the Jordan by John (Matt.
3:6; Mark 1:5). And the Lord also willed to be Himself baptized in it by
John (Matt. 3:13-17; Mark 1:9). \[6\] Because the Jordan signifies the
things which are first and last of the Lord's kingdom and church, such
as the knowledges of good and truth (for by these man is introduced),
the Jordan is also mentioned as a boundary of the New Earth or Holy
Land, in Ezekiel 47:18. That the New Earth or Holy Land is the Lord's
kingdom, and also the New Church, which is the Lord's kingdom on the
earth, may be seen above (n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118e, 3355e).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4256.">4256.</span></span>

Rescue me I pray from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for
I fear him. That this signifies the state relatively, because it made
itself prior, is evident from what has been said occasionally above,
especially when treating of the birthright which Jacob procured for
himself by the pottage of lentils, and of the blessing which he took
away from Esau by craft. What was thereby represented and signified may
be there seen, namely, that when man is being regenerated truth is
apparently in the first place, and good in the second; but that good is
actually in the first place and truth in the second, and is manifestly
so when he is regenerate (see n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576,
3603, 3701, 4243, 4244, 4247). When therefore the order is being
inverted, and good is taking its prior place manifestly (that is, when
it is beginning to have the dominion over truth), the natural man is in
fear and distress (n. 4249), and also enters into temptations. The
reason is that when truth was in the first place, that is, when it
seemed to itself to have the dominion, falsities intermingled
themselves; for from itself truth cannot see whether it is truth, but
must see this from good; and where falsities are, there is fear at the
approach of good. Moreover, all who are in good begin to fear when
falsities appear in light from good; for they fear falsities, and will
them to be extirpated; but this is impossible if the falsities stick
fast, except by Divine means from the Lord. This is the reason why those
who are to be regenerated, after fear and distress come also into
temptations, for temptations are the Divine means for removing the
falsities. This is the most secret cause why man when being regenerated
undergoes spiritual temptations. But this cause is in no way apparent to
the man, because it is above the sphere of his observation, as is
everything which moves, harasses, and torments the conscience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4257.">4257.</span></span>

Lest he come and smite me, the mother upon the sons. That this signifies
that it is about to perish, is evident without explication. "To smite
the mother upon the sons" was a form of speech among the ancients who
were in representatives and significatives, signifying the destruction
of the church and of all things that are of the church, either in
general or in particular with the man who is a church. For by "mother"
they understood the church (see n. 289, 2691, 2717), and by "sons" the
truths that are of the church (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373).
Hence "to smite the mother upon the sons" denotes to perish altogether.
Man also perishes altogether when the church and what belongs to the
church in him perishes, that is, when the affection of truth, which is
properly signified by "mother," and which produces the church in man, is
destroyed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4258.">4258.</span></span>

And Thou saidst, I will surely do well with thee. That this signifies
that nevertheless it would then obtain life, is evident from the
signification of "doing well," as being to obtain life. For by Jacob is
represented truth; and truth has not life from itself, but from the good
which flows into it, as frequently shown above. Hence it is that "doing
well" here signifies obtaining life. The life of truth from good is also
here treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4259.">4259.</span></span>

And I will make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which is not numbered
for multitude. That this signifies that there would then be
fructification and multiplication, is evident from the signification of
"seed," as being the faith of charity, and also charity itself (see n.
1025, 1447, 1610, 2848, 3373). That "to make this as the sand of the
sea, which is not numbered for multitude," is multiplication, is
manifest. Fructification is predicated of good, which is of charity; and
multiplication of truth, which is of faith (see n. 913, 983, 2846,
2847).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4260.">4260.</span></span>

Verses 13-15. And he passed the night there in that night, and he took
of that which came into his hand a present for Esau his brother: two
hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
thirty milch camels and their colts, forty heifers and ten bullocks,
twenty she-asses and ten foals. "And he passed the night there in that
night," signifies in that obscure state; "and he took of that which came
into his hand a present for Esau his brother," signifies things Divine
to be initiated into celestial natural good; "two hundred she-goats and
twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams," signifies goods and
thence truths Divine; "thirty milch camels and their colts, forty
heifers and ten bullocks, twenty she-asses and ten foals" signifies
things of service, general and special.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4261.">4261.</span></span>

And he passed the night there in that night. That this signifies in that
obscure state, is evident from the signification of "passing the night,"
and also of "night," as being an obscure state (see n. 1712, 3693).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4262.">4262.</span></span>

And he took of that which came into his hand a present for Esau his
brother. That this signifies things Divine to be initiated into
celestial natural good, is evident from the signification of "taking of
that which came into his hand," as being from those things which befell
from forethought, and thus those which were from Divine Providence; and
as those things which are of the Divine Providence are Divine, by
"taking of that which came into his hand" are here signified things
Divine;-from the signification of a "present," as being initiation (of
which in what follows); and from the representation of Esau, as being
the Divine natural as to good (see n. 3302, 3322, 3504, 3599), here as
to celestial good, because the natural was not yet made Divine. \[2\]
That a "present" signifies initiation, is because it was given to gain
good will and favor; for in old time the presents which were given and
offered had various significations; those which were given on
approaching kings and priests signified one thing, and those which were
offered upon the altar, another; the former signified initiation, but
the latter, worship (n. 349). For all sacrifices in general, of whatever
kind, were called "presents;" but the meat offerings which were bread
and wine, or cakes with a libation, were specifically so called; for in
the original language "meat offering" signifies a "present." \[3\] That
they gave presents to kings and priests on approaching them, is evident
from many passages in the Word, as when Saul consulted Samuel (1 Sam.
9:7-8); when they who despised Saul did not offer him a present (1 Sam.
10:27); when the queen of Sheba came to Solomon (1 Kings 10:2); and also
all the others of whom it is said: All the earth sought the faces of
Solomon, to hear his wisdom; and they offered every man his present,
vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and arms, and
spices, horses, and mules (1 Kings 10:24-25). And as this was a holy
ritual, signifying initiation, the wise men from the east also, who came
to Jesus just after His birth, brought presents-gold, frankincense, and
myrrh (Matt. 2:11); "gold" signified celestial love; "frankincense,"
spiritual love; and "myrrh," these loves in the natural. \[4\] That this
ritual was commanded, is evident in Moses: The faces of Jehovah shall
not be seen empty (Exod. 23:15; Deut. 16:16-17); and that the presents
given to priests and kings were as if given to Jehovah, is evident from
other places in the Word. That presents which were sent signified
initiation, is manifest from the presents which the twelve princes of
Israel sent to initiate the altar, after it was anointed (Num. 7); where
their presents are called "the initiation" (Num. 7:88).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4263.">4263.</span></span>

Two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty
rams. That this signifies goods and thence truths Divine, is evident
from the signification of "she-goats" and of "ewes" as being goods (see
n. 3995, 4006, 4169); and from the signification of the "he-goats" and
"rams" as being truths (n. 4005, 4170); here, goods and truths Divine.
That goods and truths are mentioned so many times, and are signified by
so many various things, is because all the things of heaven and of the
church have reference thereto; the things of love and charity to goods,
and the things of faith to truths. But still the differences among them
as to genera and as to species are innumerable, and indeed endless, as
is evident from the fact that all who are in good are in the Lord's
kingdom; and yet no society there, nor indeed an individual in a
society, is in the same good as another. For one and the same good is
never possible with two, and still less with many, for in this case
these would be one and the same, and not two, still less many. Everyone
consists of various things, and this by heavenly harmony and concord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4264.">4264.</span></span>

Thirty milch camels and their colts, forty heifers and ten bullocks,
twenty she-asses and ten foals. That this signifies things of service
general and special, is evident from the signification of "camels and
their colts," and of "heifers and bullocks," also of "she-asses and
their foals" as being the things which are of the natural man
(concerning which see above - as to camels, n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145;
bullocks, n. 1824, 1825, 2180, 2781, 2830; and she-asses, n. 2781). That
the things which are of the natural man are relatively things of
service, may also be seen above (n. 1486, 3019, 3020, 3167). Hence it is
that by these animals are signified things of service general and
special. As regards the number, of she-goats two hundred, of he-goats
twenty, of ewes two hundred, of rams twenty, of camels and their colts
thirty, of heifers forty, of bullocks ten, of she-asses twenty, and of
their foals ten, these are arcana which cannot be opened without much
explication and ample deduction; for all numbers in the Word signify
actual things (n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1988, 2075, 2252,
3252); and what they signify has been shown in the foregoing pages where
they have occurred. \[2\] I have sometimes wondered that when the speech
of the angels fell down into the world of spirits, it fell also into
various numbers; and also that where numbers were read in the Word, real
things were understood by the angels. For number never penetrates into
heaven, because numbers are measures of both space and of time, these
being of the world and of nature, to which in the heavens correspond
states and changes of states. The most ancient people, who were
celestial men and had communication with angels, knew what was signified
by every number, even by the compound ones; and from them their
signification was handed down to their posterity, and to the sons of the
Ancient Church. These are things which will hardly be credited by the
man of the church at this day, who believes nothing to have been stored
up in the Word more holy than what appears in the letter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4265.">4265.</span></span>

Verses 16-23. And he gave into the hand of his servants each drove by
itself; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space
between drove and drove. And he commanded the first, saying, When Esau
my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee saying, Whose art thou? and
whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? Then thou shalt
say, Thy servant Jacob's; this is a present sent unto my lord Esau; and
behold he is behind us. And he commanded also the second, and the third,
and all that went after the droves, saying, According to this word shall
ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him. And ye shall also say, Behold thy
servant Jacob is behind us; for he said, I will expiate his faces in a
present that goeth before me, and afterwards I will see his faces;
peradventure he will lift up my faces. And the present passed over
before him, and he passed the night in that night in the camp. And he
rose up in that night, and he took his two women, and his two handmaids,
and his eleven sons, and passed over the passage of Jabbok. And he took
them, and caused them to pass the river, and caused to pass what he had.
"And he gave into the hand of his servants each drove by itself; and
said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between
drove and drove," signifies an orderly arrangement in regard to the way
in which they were to be initiated; "and he commanded the first, saying,
When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art
thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? Then thou
shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's; this is a present sent unto my lord
Esau; and behold he also is behind us," signifies submission; "and he
commanded also the second, and the third, and all that went after the
droves, saying, According to this word shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye
find him," signifies a continuation; "and ye shall also say, Behold thy
servant Jacob is behind us; for he said, I will expiate his faces in a
present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his faces;
peradventure he will lift up my faces," signifies preparation for what
follows; "and the present passed over before him," signifies the effect;
"and he passed the night in that night in the camp," signifies the
things which follow; "and he rose up in that night, and took his two
women, and his two handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the
passage of Jabbok," signifies the first instilling of the affections of
truth together with the truths acquired; "the passage of Jabbok" is the
first instilling; "and he took them, and caused them to pass the river,
and caused to pass what he had," signifies further instilling.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4266.">4266.</span></span>

And he gave into the hands of his servants each drove by itself; and
said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space between
drove and drove. That this signifies an orderly arrangement in regard to
the way in which they were to be initiated, is evident from the
signification of "giving into the hand," as being to instruct with power
(that the "hand" denotes power, see n. 878, 3091, 3387, 3563); from the
signification of "servants," as being the things of the natural man (n.
3019, 3020), for all things of the natural or external man are
subordinated to the spiritual or internal man, and hence all things in
it are relatively things of service, and are called "servants;"-from the
signification of a "drove," as being memory knowledges, and also
knowledges, thus doctrinal things (see n. 3767, 3768), which so long as
they are in the natural or external man (that is, in its memory), and
are not yet implanted in the spiritual or internal man, are signified by
the "droves given to the hand of the servants;"-from the signification
of "each by itself," as being to everyone according to classes, or
according to genera and species; from the signification of "passing over
before me," and of "putting a space between drove and drove," as being
to prepare the way for the good which was to be received; for the
subject here treated of is the reception of good by truth, and the
conjunction of these in the natural man. From these several particulars
it is manifest that by all these things in general is signified an
orderly arrangement in regard to the way in which they were to be
initiated. As regards the initiation of truth into good in the natural
man, this cannot possibly be set forth to the apprehension; for the man
of the church at this day does not even know what the internal or
spiritual man is, although he very often speaks of it. Neither does he
know that in order to become a man of the church, truth must be
initiated into good in the external or natural man; still less that
there is any orderly arrangement by the Lord in that man in order to
effect its conjunction with the internal man. These things, which are
most general, are at this day so hidden that they are not known to
exist; and therefore to set forth the particulars which are here
contained in the internal sense respecting orderly arrangement and
initiation, would be speaking nothing but arcana, and thus things merely
incredible; consequently it would be speaking in vain, or like throwing
seed upon water or sand. This is the reason why the particulars are
passed over, and why here, as also in what follows in these verses, the
generals only are set forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4267.">4267.</span></span>

And he commanded the first, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee,
and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and
whose are these before thee? Then thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob's;
this is a present sent unto my lord Esau; and behold he also is behind
us. That this signifies submission, is evident in like manner from the
internal sense of the several words, from which this general sense
results. That this is submission, and that things relating to submission
are signified is manifest; for he commanded his servants to call his
brother "lord," and himself "servant," and to say that a present was
sent as by a servant to his lord. That good is relatively a lord, and
truth relatively a servant, and that they are nevertheless called
"brethren," has been shown many times. They are called "brethren"
because when good and truth have been conjoined, good is then presented
in truth as in an image, and they afterwards act in conjunction to
produce the effect. But good is called "lord" and truth "servant" before
they have been conjoined, and still more so when there is a dispute
about the priority.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4268.">4268.</span></span>

And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that went after
the droves, saying, According to this word shall ye speak unto Esau,
when ye find him. That this signifies a continuation, namely, of the
orderly arrangement and submission, is evident from what was said just
above without further explication (n. 4266, 4267).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4269.">4269.</span></span>

And ye shall also say, Behold thy servant Jacob is behind us; for he
said, I will expiate his faces in a present that goeth before me, and
afterward I will see his faces; peradventure he will lift up my faces.
That this signifies preparation for what follows, and that the present
passed over before him signifies the effect, and also that he passed the
night in that night in the camp signifies the things which follow, is
evident from the several words in the internal sense, which manifestly
imply preparation for his being kindly received. But how the case is
with the particulars, cannot be unfolded to the apprehension, for so
long as the generals are not known, the singulars of the same subject
cannot fall into any light, but into mere shade. General notions must
precede; and unless there are these, the singulars find no hospice where
they may enter. In a hospice where there is mere shade, they are not
seen; and in a hospice where there are falsities, they are either
rejected, or suffocated, or perverted; and where there are evils, they
are derided. It is sufficient that there be received these generals
-that man must be regenerated before he can enter into the Lord's
kingdom (John 3:3); that until he is being regenerated, truth is
apparently in the first place and good in the second; but that when he
is being regenerated the order is inverted, and good is in the first
place and truth in the second; also, that when the order is being
inverted, the Lord so disposes and arranges in order in the natural or
external man, that truth is there received by good, and submits itself
to good, so that the man no longer acts from truth, but from good (that
is, from charity); and further, that he acts from charity when he lives
according to the truths of faith, and loves doctrine for the sake of
life. The process of these things which are here contained in the
internal sense in regard to the orderly arrangement, initiation, and
submission of truth before good, appears before the angels in clear
light; for such things are of angelic wisdom, although man sees nothing
of them. Nevertheless they who are in simple good from simple faith are
in the faculty of knowing these things; and if on account of worldly
cares and gross ideas arising therefrom they do not apprehend them in
the life of the body, they nevertheless do so in the other life, where
worldly and bodily things are removed; for they are then enlightened and
come into angelic intelligence and wisdom.

And he rose up in that night, and took his two women, and his two
handmaids, and his eleven sons, and passed over the passage of Jabbok.
That this signifies the first instilling of the affections of truth
together with the truths acquired, is evident from the signification of
the "two women," here Rachel and Leah, as being affections of truth (see
n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819); from the signification of the "two
handmaids," here Bilhah and Zilpah, as being exterior affections of
truth that serve as means (n. 3849, 3931); from the signification of the
"sons," as being truths (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373); and from
the signification of the "passage of Jabbok," as being the first
instilling. That the "Jabbok" denotes the first instilling is because it
was a boundary of the land of Canaan. That all the boundaries of that
land were significative of the celestial and spiritual things of the
Lord's kingdom, according to their distance and situation, see n. 1585,
1866, 4116, 4240; and thus also the ford or passage of the Jabbok, which
was such relatively to the land of Canaan beyond Jordan, and was the
boundary of the inheritance of the sons of Reuben and Gad, as is evident
from Num. 21:24; Deut. 2:36, 37; 3:16, 17; Josh. 12:2; Judges 11:13, 22.
That that land fell to these as an inheritance was because by Reuben was
represented faith in the understanding, or doctrine, which is the first
of regeneration, or truth of doctrine in the complex by which the good
of life is attained (see n. 3861, 3866); and by Gad were represented the
works of faith (n. 3934). These truths of faith or doctrinal things, and
the works of faith which are first exercised, are the things through
which the man who is being regenerated is insinuated into good. It is
for this reason that by the "passage of Jabbok" is signified the first
instilling.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4271.">4271.</span></span>

And he took them, and caused them to pass the river, and caused to pass
what he had. That this signifies further instilling is evident from what
has been said just above; for he caused to pass not only the women, the
handmaids, and the sons, but also the herd and flock, thus all that he
had, into the land of Canaan, in which he met Esau. And as the subject
treated of in the internal sense is the conjunction of truth with good
in the natural, by passing over the river nothing else is signified than
the first instilling; and here where the same things are still said, and
it is also added that he caused to pass all that he had, there is
signified further instilling.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4272.">4272.</span></span>

Verses 24, 25. And Jacob remained alone, and there wrestled a man with
him until the dawn arose. And he saw that he prevailed not over him, and
he touched the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
out of joint in his wrestling with him. "And Jacob remained alone,"
signifies the good of truth procured, which was in this case the last or
ultimate; "and there wrestled a man with him," signifies temptation as
to truth; "until the dawn arose," signifies before the conjunction of
the natural good signified by "Jacob" with the celestial spiritual or
the Divine good of truth; "and he saw that he prevailed not over him,"
signifies that He overcame in temptations; "and he touched the hollow of
his thigh," signifies where celestial spiritual good is conjoined with
the natural good signified by Jacob; "and the hollow of Jacob's thigh
was out of joint in his wrestling with him," signifies that as yet truth
had not the power of completely conjoining itself with good. These same
two verses relate also to Jacob himself and his posterity, and in this
case the quality of these is signified. In this sense, by "touching the
hollow of his thigh," is signified where conjugial love is conjoined
with natural good; and by "the hollow of Jacob's thigh being out of
joint in his wrestling with him," is signified that in the posterity of
Jacob this conjunction was wholly injured and displaced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4273.">4273.</span></span>

And Jacob remained alone. That this signifies the good of truth
procured, which was in this case the last or ultimate, is evident from
the representation here of Jacob, as being the good of truth. What Jacob
had represented has been shown in the preceding pages, and also that he
represented various things in the natural, because the state of truth
and good is of one kind in the beginning, of another in its progress,
and still another in the end (n. 3775, 4234); here, he represents the
good of truth. The reason of this representation is that his wrestling
is presently treated of, by which in the internal sense is signified
temptation; and because he was named "Israel," by whom is represented
the celestial spiritual man; and also because in what next follows his
conjunction with Esau is treated of, by which conjunction is signified
the initiation of truth into good. These are the reasons why Jacob now
represents the last or ultimate good of truth in the natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4274.">4274.</span></span>

And there wrestled a man with him. That this signifies temptation as to
truth, is evident from the signification of "wrestling," as being
temptation. Temptation itself is nothing else than a wrestling or
combat; for truth is assaulted by evil spirits and is defended by the
angels who are with the man. The perception of this combat by the man is
the temptation (n. 741, 757, 761, 1661, 3927, 4249, 4256). But no
temptation can take place unless the man is in the good of truth, that
is, in the love or affection of it. For he who does not love his truth,
or is not affected by it, cares nothing for it; but he who loves it is
in anxiety lest it should suffer injury. Nothing else produces the
understanding life of man except that which he believes to be true, nor
his will life except that which he has impressed upon himself as being
good; and therefore when that is assaulted which he believes to be true,
the life of his understanding is assaulted; and when that which he has
impressed upon himself as being good is assaulted, the life of his will
is assaulted; so that when a man is being tempted, his life is at stake.
That the first of combat is as to truth, or concerning truth, is because
this is what he principally loves, and that which is of anyone's love is
that which is assaulted by evil spirits; but after the man loves good
more than truth, which takes place when the order is being inverted, he
is tempted as to good. But what temptation is few know, because at this
day few undergo any temptation, for no others can be tempted than those
who are in the good of faith, that is, in charity toward the neighbor.
If they who are not in this charity were to be tempted, they would
succumb at once; and they who succumb come into the confirmation of evil
and the persuasion of falsity; for the evil spirits with whom they are
thus associated then conquer within them. This is the reason why at this
day few are admitted into any spiritual temptation, but only into some
natural anxieties, in order that they may thereby be withdrawn from the
loves of self and of the world, into which they would otherwise rush
without restraint.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4275.">4275.</span></span>

Until the dawn arose. That this signifies before the conjunction of the
natural good signified by "Jacob" with the celestial spiritual, or the
Divine good of truth, is evident from the signification of the "dawn" as
being in the supreme sense the Lord, in the representative sense His
kingdom, and in the universal sense the celestial of love (n. 2405);
here, the celestial spiritual. For when the dawn arose, Jacob was named
Israel, by whom is signified the celestial spiritual man; wherefore
"before the arising of the dawn" denotes before the conjunction with the
celestial spiritual of the natural good now signified by "Jacob." What
the celestial spiritual is, will be told at the twenty-eighth verse, in
treating of Israel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4276.">4276.</span></span>

And he saw that he prevailed not over him. That this signifies that He
overcame in temptations, is evident without explication.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4277.">4277.</span></span>

And he touched the hollow of his thigh. That this signifies where
celestial spiritual good is conjoined with the natural good signified by
"Jacob," is evident from the signification of the "thigh," as being
conjugial love, and thence all celestial and spiritual love, because
these are derived from conjugial love as offspring from their parent
(see n. 3021); and from the signification of the "hollow," or "socket,"
or cavity of the thigh, as being where there is conjunction; here,
therefore, where there is the conjunction of celestial spiritual good
with the natural good signified by "Jacob." But of this conjunction
nothing can be said unless it is first known what celestial spiritual
good is, which is "Israel," and what natural good is, which is "Jacob."
This will be told presently (at verse 28) in treating of Jacob, then
named Israel, and again afterwards in treating of Jacob's posterity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4278.">4278.</span></span>

And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint in his wrestling with
him. That this signifies that as yet truth had not the power of
completely conjoining itself with good, is evident from the
signification of being "out of joint," namely, that truths had not as
yet been disposed in such an order that they all, together with good,
could enter into celestial spiritual good (see the explication that
follows at the thirty-first verse), consequently that truth had not yet
the power of completely conjoining itself with good; for the "hollow of
the thigh" denotes where goods are conjoined together (as said just
above, n. 4277).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4279.">4279.</span></span>

These things which have been unfolded thus far are thus to be understood
in the supreme sense and in the internal sense; but it is otherwise in
the lower sense in which the quality of Jacob and of his posterity is
treated of. As the Word is from the Lord, and descends from Him through
heaven to man, it is therefore such that it is Divine as to every
particular; and as it has descended from the Lord, so it ascends, that
is, is uplifted to Him, and this through the heavens. It is known that
there are three heavens, and that the inmost heaven is called the third
heaven, the middle heaven the second heaven, and the lowest the first
heaven; and therefore when the Word ascends as it descends, in the Lord
it is Divine; in the third heaven it is celestial (for this heaven is
the celestial heaven); in the second heaven it is spiritual (for this
heaven is the spiritual heaven); and in the first heaven it is celestial
and spiritual natural, and the same heaven is also so termed. But in the
church with man, the Word as regards the sense of its letter is natural,
that is, worldly and earthly. \[2\] From this it is manifest what the
nature of the Word is, and how the case is with the Word when it is
being read by a man who is in what is holy, that is, in good and truth.
For it then appears to him as worldly, or as historical, within which
there is nevertheless what is holy; but in the first heaven it appears
as celestial and spiritual natural, within which there is nevertheless
what is Divine; in the second heaven it is spiritual; in the third
heaven it is celestial; and in the Lord it is Divine. The sense of the
Word is circumstanced in accordance with the heavens; the supreme sense
of the Word, in which the subject treated of is the Lord, is for the
inmost or third heaven; its internal sense, in which the subject treated
of is the Lord's kingdom, is for the middle or second heaven; but the
lower sense of the Word, in which the internal sense is determined to
the nation that is named, is for the lowest or first heaven; and the
lowest or literal sense is for man while still living in the world, and
who is nevertheless of such a nature that the interior sense, and even
the internal and the supreme senses, can be communicated to him. For man
has communication with the three heavens, because he is created after
the image of the three heavens, even so that when he lives in love to
the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor, he is a heaven in the least
form. Hence it is that within man is the Lord's kingdom, as the Lord
Himself teaches in Luke: Behold, the kingdom of God is within you (Luke
17:21). \[3\] These things have been said in order that it may be known
that in the Word there is not only the supreme sense, and the internal
sense, but also a lower sense, and that in the lower sense the internal
sense is determined to the nation there named; and when this is done,
the sense manifestly appears from the series of things. That this
wrestling of the man with Jacob, and the dislocation and displacement of
his thigh, are predicated also of Jacob and his posterity, is manifest;
and therefore I may unfold these same words according to this sense.
This sense will be called in what follows the INTERNAL HISTORICAL SENSE,
and this for the additional reason that it is wont to be occasionally
represented to the life and in form in the first heaven, as also I have
sometimes been permitted to see. (See the explication premised in the
second paragraph of number 4272.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="4280.">4280.</span></span>

That in the internal historical sense, by his "touching the hollow of
Jacob's thigh," is signified where conjugial love is conjoined with
natural good, is evident from the signification of the "hollow of the
thigh," as being where there is the conjunction of conjugial love (see
above, n. 4277). That conjunction there with natural good is signified,
is because the thigh is there conjoined to the feet. In the internal
sense the "feet" signify natural good, as may be seen above (n. 2162,
3147, 3761, 3986). \[2\] That the "thigh" denotes conjugial love, and
the "feet" natural good, is among the things that are now obsolete and
lost. The Ancient Church, which was in representatives and
significatives, knew these things very well. The knowledge of such
things was their intelligence and wisdom, and this not only of those who
were of the church, but also of those who were out of the church, as is
evident from the oldest books of the Gentiles, and from the things which
at this day are called fables; for significatives and representatives
were derived to them from the Ancient Church. With them also the thighs
and the loins signified what is conjugial, and the feet what is natural.
The thighs and the feet have this signification from the correspondences
of all man's members, organs, and viscera with the Grand Man, which
correspondences are now being treated of at the end of the chapters. Of
the correspondences with the thigh and the feet more will be said in
what follows, where it will be confirmed by living experience that such
is their signification. \[3\] At the present day these things cannot but
appear paradoxical, because, as before said, this knowledge is
altogether obsolete and lost. And yet how much this knowledge surpasses
other knowledges, may be seen from the fact that without it the Word
cannot possibly be known as to its internal sense; and because the
angels who are with man perceive the Word according to this sense; and
also because by means of this knowledge communication is given to man
with heaven. And (what is incredible) the internal man itself thinks in
no other way; for when the external man apprehends the Word according to
the letter, the internal man apprehends it at the same time according to
the internal sense, although the man while living in the body is not
aware of this. Especially may this be seen from the fact that when a man
comes into the other life and becomes an angel, he knows the internal
sense as of himself without instruction. \[4\] What conjugial love is,
which is signified by the thighs and also by the loins, may be seen
above (n. 995, 1123, 2727-2759); and that conjugial love is the
fundamental of all loves (n. 686, 3021); and hence it is that those who
are in genuine conjugial love are also in celestial love (that is, in
love to the Lord), and in spiritual love (that is, in charity toward the
neighbor); and therefore by conjugial love not only is this love itself
meant, but also all celestial and spiritual love. These loves are said
to be conjoined with natural good when the internal man is conjoined
with the external, or the spiritual man with the natural. This
conjunction is that which is signified by the "hollow of the thigh."
That with Jacob and his posterity in general there was no such
conjunction, will appear from what follows; for this is the subject here
treated of in the internal historical sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4281.">4281.</span></span>

That by "the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint in his wrestling
with him," is signified that this conjunction was wholly injured and
displaced in Jacob's posterity, is evident from the signification of
being "out of joint" in the sense in question, as being to be displaced,
and thus to be injured. That the "hollow of the thigh" denotes
conjunction, is manifest from what was said above (n. 4280); and because
in the Word "Jacob" denotes not only Jacob, but also all his posterity,
as is evident from many passages in the Word (Num. 23:7, 10, 21, 23;
24:5, 17, 19; Deut. 33:10; Isa. 40:27; 43:1, 22; 44:1, 2, 21; 48:12;
59:20; Jer. 10:16, 25; 30:7, 10, 18; 31:7, 11; 46:27, 28; Hos. 10:11;
Amos 7:2; Micah 2:12; 3:8; Ps. 14:7; 24:6; 59:13; 78:5; 99:4; and
elsewhere). \[2\] That Jacob and his posterity were of such a character
that with them celestial and spiritual love could not be conjoined with
natural good (that is, the internal or spiritual man with the external
or natural man), is manifest from everything which is related of that
nation in the Word; for they did not know, nor were they willing to
know, what the internal or spiritual man is, and therefore this was not
revealed to them; for they believed that nothing exists in man except
that which is external and natural. In all their worship they had regard
to nothing else, insomuch that Divine worship was to them no otherwise
than idolatrous; for when internal worship is separated from external,
it is merely idolatrous. The church that was instituted with them was
not a church, but only the representative of a church; for which reason
that church is called a representative church. That a representative of
a church is possible with such people may be seen above (n. 1361, 3670,
4208). \[3\] For in representations the person is not reflected upon,
but the thing which is represented; and therefore Divine, celestial, and
spiritual things were represented not only by persons, but also by
inanimate things, as by Aaron's garments, the ark, the altar, the oxen
and sheep that were sacrificed, the lampstand with its lamps, the bread
of arrangement upon the golden table, the oil with which they were
anointed, the frankincense, and other like things. Hence it was that
their kings, the evil as well as the good, represented the Lord's
royalty; and the high priests, the evil as well as the good, represented
the things that belong to the Lord's Divine priesthood, when they
discharged their office in an outward form according to the statutes and
precepts. In order therefore that the representative of a church might
come forth among them, such statutes and laws were given them by
manifest revelation as were altogether representative; and therefore so
long as they were in them and observed them strictly, so long they were
able to represent; but when they turned aside from them, as to the
statutes and laws of other nations, and especially to the worship of
another god, they then deprived themselves of the faculty of
representing. For this reason they were driven by outward means, such as
captivities, disasters, threats, and miracles, to laws and statutes
truly representative; but not by internal means, as are those who have
internal worship in external. These things are signified by the "hollow
of Jacob's thigh being out of joint," taken in the internal historical
sense, which regards Jacob and his posterity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4282.">4282.</span></span>

Verses 26-28. And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. And he said,
I will not let thee go unless thou bless me. And he said unto him, What
is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And he said, Thy name shall no more be
called Jacob, but Israel; for as a prince hast thou contended with God
and with men, and hast prevailed. "And he said, Let me go, for the dawn
ariseth," signifies that temptation ceased when conjunction was at hand;
"and he said, I will not let thee go, unless thou bless me," signifies
that conjunction was to be effected; "and he said unto him, What is thy
name? And he said, Jacob" signifies the quality of good from truth; "and
he said, Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel," signifies
the Divine celestial spiritual now; "Israel" is the celestial spiritual
man which is in the natural, and thus is natural; the celestial
spiritual man itself, which is rational, is "Joseph;" "for as a prince
hast thou contended with God and with men, and hast prevailed,"
signifies continual victories in combats as to truths and goods. \[2\]
In the internal historical sense, in which Jacob and his posterity are
treated of, by the same words are signified the things which follow; by
"Let me go, for the dawn ariseth," is signified that what was
representative before they came into representatives of the land of
Canaan should depart from the posterity of Jacob; by "and he said, I
will not let thee go unless thou bless me," is signified that they would
insist upon being representative; by "and he said unto him, What is thy
name? And he said, Jacob," is signified that they were the posterity of
Jacob with their quality; by "and he said, Thy name shall no longer be
called Jacob, but Israel," is signified that they could not represent as
Jacob, but as from a new quality given them; by "for as a prince hast
thou contended with God and with men, and hast prevailed," is signified
because of the contumacy which was in their cupidities and phantasies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4283.">4283.</span></span>

And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. That this signifies that
the temptation ceased when the conjunction was at hand, is evident from
the signification of "Let me go," that is, from wrestling with me, as
being that the temptation ceased (that the "wrestling" denotes
temptation, see above, n. 4274, and that it ceased is manifest from what
follows); and from the signification of the "dawn," as being the
conjunction of the natural good signified by "Jacob" with the celestial
spiritual, or the Divine good of truth (of which also above, n. 4275).
That the wrestling was begun before the dawn arose, and ceased after it
arose, and that then is related what took place when the sun was risen,
is because the times of the day, like the times of the year, signify
states (n. 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3785), here, states of conjunction
by means of temptations. For when the conjunction of the internal man
with the external is being effected, then it is the dawn to him, because
he then enters into a spiritual or celestial state. Then also light like
that of the dawn appears to him if he is in such a state as to be able
to observe it. Moreover his understanding is enlightened, and he is as
one awakened from sleep in the early morning, when the dawn is first
lighting and beginning the day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4284.">4284.</span></span>

And he said, I will not let thee go, unless thou bless me. That this
signifies that conjunction was to be effected, is evident from the
signification of "not letting thee go," as being that the temptation
would not cease (of which just above, n. 4283); and from the
signification of "blessing," as being conjunction (n. 3504, 3514, 3530,
3584). From this it is manifest that by "I will not let thee go, unless
thou bless me," is signified that the temptation would not cease until
the conjunction was effected, that is, that conjunction was to be
effected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4285.">4285.</span></span>

And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. That this
signifies the quality of good from truth, is evident from the
signification of "name," as being quality (see n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896,
2009, 2724, 3006); and from the representation of Jacob, as being the
good of truth (see above, n. 4273).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4286.">4286.</span></span>

And he said, Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel. That
this signifies the Divine celestial spiritual now, and that "Israel" is
the celestial spiritual man which is in the natural, and thus is
natural; and that the celestial spiritual man itself, which is rational
is "Joseph," is evident from what follows concerning Jacob and
concerning Israel, and also concerning Joseph; for it must first be told
what is here meant by the celestial spiritual. It is indeed known in the
church at the present day that there is a spiritual man and a natural
man, or an internal man and an external man; but what the spiritual or
internal man is, is not yet so well known; and still less what the
celestial man is, and that it is distinct from the spiritual; and as
this is not known, it cannot be known what the celestial spiritual man
is, which here is "Israel," and therefore this must be briefly told.
\[2\] That there are three heavens, is known, namely, an inmost heaven,
a middle, and an ultimate; or what is the same, a third, a second, and a
first. The inmost or third heaven is celestial; for the angels there are
called celestial because they are in love to the Lord, and are therefore
most fully conjoined with the Lord, and are consequently in wisdom above
all the rest, are innocent, and hence are called innocences and wisdoms.
These angels are distinguished into the internal and the external, the
internal being more celestial than the external. The middle or second
heaven is spiritual; for the angels there are called spiritual because
they are in charity toward the neighbor, that is, in mutual love, which
is such that the one loves the other more than himself; and because they
are such they are in intelligence, and are hence called intelligences.
These angels are also distinguished into the internal and the external,
the internal being more spiritual than the external. The ultimate or
first heaven is likewise celestial and spiritual, but not in the same
degree as the prior ones; for what is natural adheres to these angels,
and they are therefore called the celestial natural and the spiritual
natural. These also are in mutual love, yet do not love others more than
themselves, but as themselves. They are in the affection of good and
knowledge of truth, and are likewise distinguished into the internal and
the external. \[3\] But what the celestial spiritual is, shall also be
briefly told. Those are called the celestial spiritual who were said
just above to be the spiritual, and they are in the middle or second
heaven; they are termed "celestial" from mutual love, and "spiritual"
from the derivative intelligence. The internal angels there are those
who are represented by Joseph, and are also called "Joseph" in the Word;
but the external there are those who are represented by Israel, and are
also called "Israel" in the Word. The former (that is, the internal
angels who are called "Joseph") partake of the rational; but the
external who are called "Israel," partake of the natural, for these are
midway between the rational and the natural. This is the reason why it
is said that Israel is the celestial spiritual man which is in the
natural, and thus is natural; and that Joseph is the celestial spiritual
man itself, which is rational. For in the universal sense all the good
which is of love and charity is called celestial, and all the derivative
truth of faith and intelligence is said to be spiritual. \[4\] These
things have been stated in order that it may be known what "Israel"
denotes. But in the supreme sense "Israel" signifies the Lord as to the
Divine celestial spiritual, and in the internal sense signifies the
Lord's spiritual kingdom in heaven and on earth. The Lord's spiritual
kingdom on earth is the church which is called the Spiritual Church. And
because "Israel" denotes the Lord's spiritual kingdom, "Israel" likewise
denotes the spiritual man, for in every such man there is the Lord's
kingdom; for a man is a heaven, and is also a church, in the least form
(n. 4279). As regards Jacob, by him in the supreme sense is represented
the Lord as to the natural, both celestial and spiritual; and in the
internal sense the Lord's kingdom such as it is in the ultimate or first
heaven, and consequently also the same in the church. Good in the
natural is what is here called celestial, and truth in the same is what
is called spiritual. From these things it is evident what is signified
by "Israel" and by "Jacob" in the Word, and also why Jacob was named
Israel. \[5\] But these things which have been said must needs appear
obscure, especially for the reason that it is known to few what the
spiritual man is, and to scarcely anyone what the celestial man is,
consequently that there is any distinction between the spiritual and the
celestial man. The reason why this has not been known, is that there is
no distinct perception of the good of love and charity, and of the truth
which is of faith; and these are not perceived because there is no
longer any genuine charity, and where anything is not, there is no
perception of it. Another reason is that man is little solicitous about
the things that belong to the life after death, thus about the things of
heaven, but is very much so about those which belong to the life of the
body, and thus about the things that are of the world. If man were
solicitous about the things that belong to the life after death, thus
about the things of heaven, he would easily apprehend all the things
that have been said above; for that which a man loves he easily imbibes
and apprehends, but with difficulty what he does not love. \[6\] That
"Jacob" signifies one thing and "Israel" another, is plainly evident
from the Word; for in the historical parts, and also in the prophetical,
it is now said "Jacob," and now "Israel," and sometimes both are said in
the same verse; from which it is evident that there is an internal sense
in the Word, and that without this sense this circumstance cannot
possibly be understood. That "Jacob" is now said, and now "Israel," is
evident from the following passages: Jacob dwelt in the land of his
father's sojournings. These are the births of Jacob; Joseph was a son of
seventeen years, and Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons (Gen.
37:1-3); where Jacob is first called "Jacob" and presently "Israel;" and
he is called Israel when Joseph is treated of. Again: Jacob saw that
there was corn in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons. And the sons of
Israel came to buy in the midst of those who came (Gen. 42:1, 5). And
afterwards: They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan
unto Jacob their father; and when they told him all the words of Joseph,
which he spoke unto them, the spirit of Jacob their father revived; and
Israel said, It is much, Joseph my son is yet alive (45:25, 27-28).
Again: And Israel journeyed, and all that he had. God said unto Israel
in the visions of the night, and He said, Jacob, Jacob, who said, Behold
me. And Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried
down Jacob their father (Gen. 46:1-2, 5). And in the same chapter: These
are the names of the sons of Israel that came into Egypt, of Jacob and
his sons (Gen. 46:8). Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him
before Pharaoh. Pharaoh said unto Jacob, and Jacob said unto Pharaoh
(Gen. 47:7-9). And in the same chapter: And Israel dwelt in the land of
Goshen; and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; and the
days of Israel drew near to die; and he called his son Joseph (Gen.
46:27-29). Yet again: And one told Jacob, and said, Behold thy son
Joseph cometh unto thee; and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon
the bed. And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Shaddai appeared to me in Luz
(Gen. 48:2-3). And he is called Israel in the same chapter (verses 8,
10, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21). And lastly: Jacob called his sons, and said,
Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and listen unto Israel
your father. And when Jacob had made an end of charging his sons (Gen.
49:1-2, 33) From these passages it is very evident that Jacob is now
called Jacob, and now Israel, and thus that Jacob means one thing, and
Israel another; or that one thing is signified when it is said "Jacob,"
and another when "Israel," and also that this arcanum cannot possibly be
understood except from the internal sense. \[7\] But what "Jacob"
signifies, and what "Israel," has been told above. In general by "Jacob"
in the Word is signified what is external of the church, and by "Israel"
what is internal; for every church has an external and also an internal,
or is internal and also external. And as that which is of the church is
signified by "Jacob" and by "Israel," and as everything of the church is
from the Lord, hence in the supreme sense both "Jacob" and "Israel"
denote the Lord, "Jacob" as to the Divine natural, and "Israel" as to
the Divine spiritual. Thus the external which is of the Lord's kingdom
and of His church, is "Jacob," and the internal is "Israel"-as is
further evident from the following passages, in which each is named in
its own sense. In the prophecy of Jacob, then Israel: By the hands of
the Mighty One of Jacob, from thence is the shepherd, the stone of
Israel (Gen.49:24). In Isaiah: Hear, O Jacob, My servant, and Israel
whom I have chosen; I will pour out My spirit upon thy seed, and My
blessing upon thy sons; this one shall say to Jehovah, I and this one
shall call himself by the name of Jacob, and that one shall write with
his hand unto Jehovah, and surname himself by the name of Israel (Isa.
44:1, 3, 5); where "Jacob" and "Israel" manifestly denote the Lord, and
the "seed and sons of Jacob and Israel," those who are in faith in Him.
In the prophecy of Balaam in Moses: Who shall number the dust of Jacob,
and the number with the fourth part of Israel? (Num. 23:10). And again:
There is no divination against Jacob, nor sorceries against Israel; at
this time it shall be said to Jacob and to Israel, What hath God
wrought! (Num. 23:23). Again: How good are thy tabernacles O Jacob, thy
dwelling places, O Israel (Num. 24:4-5). And again: There shall arise a
star out of Jacob, and a scepter out of Israel (Num. 24:17). In Isaiah:
My glory will I not give to another. Attend to me, O Jacob, and Israel
My called. I am the same; I am the first, I also am the last (Isa.
48:11-12). In the same: Jacob shall enroot those who come; and Israel
shall blossom and flower; and the faces of the world shall be filled
with produce (Isa. 27:6). In Jeremiah: Fear not thou, O Jacob My
servant, and be not terrified, O Israel; for lo I have saved thee from
afar (Jer. 30:9-10). In Micah: In gathering I will gather Jacob, all of
thee; in assembling I will assemble the remains of Israel; I will put
them together as the sheep of Bozrah (Micah 2:12). \[8\] For what reason
Jacob was named Israel is evident from the very words when this name was
given him: "Thy name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel; for as a
prince hast thou contended with God and with men, and hast prevailed."
For in the original language "Israel" means "one that contends with God
as a prince," by which is signified in the internal sense that He
overcame in the combats of temptations; for temptations and combats in
temptations were the means by which the Lord made His Human Divine (n.
1737, 1813, and elsewhere); and temptations and victories in temptations
are what make man spiritual; for which reason Jacob was for the first
time named Israel after he wrestled. (That "wrestling" denotes being
tempted may be seen above, n. 4274.) It is known that the Church, or the
man of the Christian Church, calls himself Israel; and yet no one in the
Church is Israel but he who has become a spiritual man by means of
temptations. The name itself also involves the same. That it was
afterwards confirmed that Jacob should be called Israel, is evident from
what follows in another chapter, where are these words: God appeared
unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him; and
God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall not be called any
more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name; and He called his name Israel
(Gen. 35:9-10). The reason of this confirmation will be told hereafter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4287.">4287.</span></span>

For as a prince hast thou contended with God and with men, and hast
prevailed. That this signifies continual victories in combats as to
truths and goods, is evident from the signification of "contending as a
prince," as being to overcome in combats, here in the combats of
temptations, for these are what are treated of; and from the
signification of "with God and with men" as being as to truths and
goods, of which below. \[2\] As in the supreme sense the Lord is treated
of, it is He who is meant in this sense by "him that contended as a
prince with God and men;" for He endured all temptations by His own
power, and by means of them conquered the hells; for He admitted all the
hells into Himself in their order, yea, even to the angels-of which in
the following pages. And He thus reduced into order all things in the
heavens and in the hells, and at last glorified Himself, that is, made
the Human in Himself Divine. \[3\] From this it is manifest that in the
supreme sense the Lord is "Jacob" and "Israel" (as shown just above, n.
4286), not only in that He contended as a prince, that is, endured all
the combats of temptations, and conquered in them, but in that He also
endures them in every man. But see what has been said on these subjects
many times before, namely: That the Lord beyond all endured the most
grievous temptations (n. 1663, 1668, 1787, 2776, 2786, 2795, 2816): That
the Lord fought from Divine love, differently from all men (n.1690,
1691, 1789, 1812, 1813, 1820): That the Lord fought against hereditary
evil from the mother, so that at last He was not her son, although He
had no actual evil (n. 1444, 1573, 2025, 2574, 2649, 3318): That the
Lord through combats of temptations and continual victories disposed all
things into a heavenly form (n. 1928): That by continual victories in
the combats of temptations He united the Divine Essence to the Human (n.
1616, 1737, 1813, 1921, 2025, 2026, 2500, 2523, 2632, 2776): And that
the Lord endures temptations in man, and subjugates evil and the hells
(n. 987, 1661, 1692). \[4\] That "to contend with God and with men"
denotes to be tempted as to truths and as to goods, is a secret which
does not appear from the letter. That it was not God with whom Jacob
contended must be evident to everyone, and will also appear from the
explication below; for it cannot be predicated of any man that he
contends with God and prevails. But the internal sense teaches what is
here signified by "God" and by "men"-namely, that by "God" is signified
truth and by "men" good, and this for the reason that in the internal
sense the name "God" signifies truth, and hence that when the subject
treated of is truth, this name is used (n. 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822); and
that when "man" is mentioned, good is meant. That "man" denotes good is
because the Lord is the only man, and because man is called man from Him
(see n. 49, 288, 565, 1894); also because from Him heaven is a man, and
is called the Grand Man (n. 684, 1276, 3624-3649, 3741-3751). \[5\] For
this reason the Most Ancient Church also, which was in celestial good,
was called "man" (n. 478); and therefore also in the Word, where good is
treated of, good is signified by "man," as in Isaiah: I will make a man
\[vir homo\] <span id="fr_123"></span>[4287-1](#fn_123.md) more rare than
gold, and man \[homo\] than the gold of Ophir (Isa. 13:12). The
inhabitants of the earth shall be burned, and few shall be the man \[vir
homo\] left (Isa. 24:6); a "man" \[vir homo\] denotes spiritual good, or
the good of truth; a "man" \[homo\], good. In the same: The paths are
laid waste, the wayfaring man hath ceased; he hath made vain the
covenant, he hath loathed the cities, he regardeth not a man \[vir
homo\] (Isa. 33:8). In Jeremiah: I beheld the earth, and lo it was a
void and emptiness, and the heavens, and they had no light; I beheld and
lo there was no man, and all the birds of heaven had flown away (Jer.
4:23, 25). In the same: Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I
will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of
man, and with the seed of beast (Jer. 31:27). In Ezekiel: Thy merchants
with the soul of man and vessels of brass they gave thy trading (Ezek.
27:13). In the same: Ye My flock, the flock of My pasture, ye are man,
and I am your God (Ezek. 34:31). Again: The waste cities shall be filled
with the flock of man (Ezek. 36:38). In these passages "man" \[homo\]
denotes those who are in good, thus good, because man is man from good.
But the truth which is from good is called in the Word a "man" \[vir
homo\], and also the "son of man."

<span class="margnote"><span id="4288.">4288.</span></span>

These same words which have thus far been explained have regard also to
the Jewish and Israelitish nation, which is named "Jacob" in the Word,
as has been said and shown above (n. 4279). In that sense which is
called the internal historical sense, by these words-"Let me go, for the
dawn ariseth"-is signified that what is representative should depart
from the posterity of Jacob, before they came into the representatives
of the land of Canaan. It has been shown above what the character of
that nation was, namely, that with them there was no internal worship,
but only external; thus that the heavenly conjugial was separated from
them, and therefore that no church could be instituted with them, but
only the representative of a church (n.4281). \[2\] But be it known what
a representative church is, and what the representative of a church. A
representative church is when there is internal worship in external, and
the representative of a church when there is no internal worship, but
nevertheless there is external. In both there are nearly similar outward
rituals, that is, similar statutes, similar laws, and similar precepts.
But in the representative church the externals correspond with the
internals, so as to make a one; whereas in the representative of a
church there is no correspondence, because the externals are either
devoid of internals, or are at variance with them. In a representative
church celestial and spiritual love is the principal, but in the
representative of a church bodily and worldly love is the principal.
Celestial and spiritual love is the internal itself; but where there is
no celestial and spiritual love, but only bodily and worldly love, the
external is devoid of an internal. The Ancient Church, which was after
the flood, was a representative church; but that which was instituted
among the posterity of Jacob was only the representative of a church.
\[3\] To make this evident let the distinction be illustrated by
examples. In the Representative Church Divine worship took place on
mountains, because mountains signified celestial love, and in the
supreme sense the Lord (n. 795, 1430, 2722, 4210); and when they were
holding worship on mountains, they were in their holy state, because
they were at the same time in celestial love. In the Representative
Church Divine worship took place also in groves, because groves
signified spiritual love, and in the supreme sense the Lord as to this
love (n. 2722); and when they were holding worship in groves, they were
in their holy state, because at the same time in spiritual love. In the
Representative Church when they were holding Divine worship, they turned
their faces to the rising of the sun, because by the rising sun was also
signified celestial love (n. 101, 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495, 3636, 3643).
And so when they looked at the moon they were in like manner penetrated
with a certain holy reverence, because the moon signified spiritual love
(n. 1529-1531, 2495, 4060). It was similar when they looked at the
starry heaven, because this signified the angelic heaven or the Lord's
kingdom. In the Representative Church they had tents or tabernacles, and
Divine worship in them, and this holy; because tents or tabernacles
signified the holy of love and worship (n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3312);
and so in innumerable other things. \[4\] In the representative of a
church there was indeed in the beginning a like Divine worship upon
mountains, and also in groves, and they also turned their faces toward
the rising of the sun, and looked at the moon and the stars, and
similarly held worship in tents or tabernacles. But as they were in
external worship without internal, or in bodily and worldly love, and
not in celestial and spiritual love, and thus worshiped the mountains
and groves themselves, and the sun, moon, and stars, as also their tents
or tabernacles, and thus made the rituals idolatrous which in the
Ancient Church were holy, they were therefore restricted to what was
common to all, namely, to the mountain where Jerusalem was, and at last
where Zion was, and to the rising of the sun as seen thence and from the
temple, and also to a tent in common, which was called the tent of
meeting, and finally to the ark in the temple; and this to the intent
that a representative of a church might exist when they were in a holy
external; as otherwise they would have profaned holy things. \[5\] From
this it is evident what the distinction is between a representative
church and a representative of a church; in general, that they who were
of the representative church communicated with the three heavens as to
their interiors, to which these external things served as a plane; but
they who were in the representative of a church did not communicate with
the heavens as to their interiors; but still the external things in
which they were kept could serve as a plane, and this miraculously of
the Lord's providence, to the intent that something of communication
might exist between heaven and man, by means of some semblance of a
church; for without the communication of heaven with man through
something of a church, the human race would perish. What the
correspondence of internal things is, cannot be told in few words, but
will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in the following pages.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4289.">4289.</span></span>

That by "Let me go, for the dawn ariseth," is signified that what is
representative would depart from the posterity of Jacob, before they
came into the representatives of the land of Canaan, is evident from the
series of things in the internal historical sense, in which Jacob's
posterity are treated of. Their state in respect to the things of the
church is also described in the Word by evening, by night, and by
morning or dawn - by the latter when they came into the land of Canaan,
consequently into the representative of a church there. The case herein
is that the representative of a church could not be instituted among
them until they had been altogether vastated, that is, until they had no
knowledge of internal things; for if they had had a knowledge of
internal things they could have been affected by them, and thus would
have profaned them. For holy things (that is, internal truths and goods)
can be profaned by those who know and acknowledge them, and still more
by those who are affected by them, but not by those who do not
acknowledge them. But see what has been previously said and shown about
profanation, namely: That those can profane holy things who know and
acknowledge them, but not those who do not (n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059,
3398, 3898): That those who are within the church can profane holy
things, but not those who are without (n. 2051): That therefore so far
as is possible those are withheld from the acknowledgment and belief of
good and truth who cannot remain therein permanently (n. 3398, 3402):
That these are also kept in ignorance lest they should profane (n.
301-303): What danger there is from the profanation of holy things (n.
571, 582): That worship becomes external lest what is internal should be
profaned (n. 1327, 1328): And that therefore internal truths were not
disclosed to the Jews (n. 3398). \[2\] It was therefore provided by the
Lord that the genuine representative of a church (that is, what is
internal) should depart from the posterity of Jacob before they came
into the representatives of the land of Canaan, insomuch that they did
not know anything at all concerning the Lord. They did indeed know that
the Messiah was to come into the world, but to the end that He should
exalt them to glory and eminence over all nations of the whole earth -
not to save their souls to eternity. Neither did they know anything
about the heavenly kingdom, nor about the life after death, and not even
about charity and faith. In order that they might be reduced to this
ignorance they were kept some hundreds of years in Egypt; and when they
were called out thence, they did not know even the name of Jehovah
(Exod. 3:12-14). Moreover, they had lost all the worship of the
representative church, insomuch that after the commandments of the
Decalogue had been promulgated before them from Mount Sinai, within a
month they fell back to the Egyptian worship, which was that of a golden
calf (Exod. 32). \[3\] And because the brood that had been brought out
of Egypt was of such a character, they all perished in the wilderness.
For nothing more was required of them than to keep the statutes and
precepts in the outward form, because this was to act as the
representative of a church; but those who had grown up in Egypt could
not be reduced to this; yet their children could, although with
difficulty, in the beginning by miracles, and afterwards by fears and
captivities, as is manifest from the books of Joshua and Judges. From
this it is evident that all genuine or internal representation of the
church had departed from them before they came into the land of Canaan,
where the external representative of the church was begun among them in
full form. For the land of Canaan was the veriest land of all where the
representatives of the church could be presented, because all the places
and all the boundaries of this land had been representative from ancient
times (see n. 3686).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4290.">4290.</span></span>

In the internal historical sense, by "he said, I will not let thee go
unless thou bless me," is signified that they insisted upon being
representative; for their insisting is signified by "I will not let thee
go," and representing a church by being "blessed." In regard to this
subject - that the posterity of Jacob insisted upon being representative
of a church, and that they were chosen above all other nations - this
cannot indeed be made so evident from the historicals of the Word in the
sense of the letter, for the reason that the historicals of the Word in
the sense of the letter enfold within them deep secrets of heaven, and
therefore these so follow in the series; and also because the names
themselves signify things; many names indeed in their supreme sense
signify the Lord Himself, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. That these
in the supreme sense signify the Lord, has been shown many times in what
precedes (see n. 1965, 1989, 2011, 3245, 3305, 3439). \[2\] That the
posterity of Jacob were not chosen, but insisted that a church should be
among them, may be seen from many passages of the Word, from its
internal historical sense, and openly in the following. In Moses:
Jehovah spoke unto Moses, Go up hence, thou and the people which thou
hast made to go up out of the land of Egypt, into the land of which I
sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I
give it; I will not go up in the midst of thee, for thou art a
stiffnecked people; lest I consume thee in the way. And when the people
heard this evil word, they mourned, and put off everyone his ornament
from upon him. And Moses took the tent, and pitched it for himself
without the camp, in removing far from the camp. And Moses said unto
Jehovah, See, Thou sayest unto me, Make this people go up, and Thou hast
not made known to me whom Thou wilt send with me. Now therefore I pray
If I have found grace in Thine eyes, make known to me I pray Thy way,
that I may know concerning Thee, that I have found grace in Thine eyes;
behold also that this nation is Thy people. He said therefore, My faces
shall go until I give thee rest (Exod. 33:1-7, 12-14). It is here said
that Moses made the people go up out of the land of Egypt, and then that
they put off their ornament and mourned, and that Moses pitched his tent
without the camp, and that thereby Jehovah assented; thus plainly
showing that they themselves insisted. \[3\] In the same: Jehovah said
unto Moses, How long will this people provoke Me, and how long will they
not believe in Me, for all the signs which I have wrought in the midst
of them? I will smite them with the pestilence, and will extinguish
them, and will make of thee a nation greater and mightier than they. But
Moses supplicated, and Jehovah being entreated said, I will be gracious
according to thy word: nevertheless, I live, and the whole earth shall
be filled with the glory of Jehovah; for as to all those men who have
seen My glory, and My signs which I wrought in Egypt, and in the
wilderness, yet have tempted Me these ten times, and have not obeyed my
voice, surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked Me see it. Your bodies
shall fall in this wilderness; but your little children will I bring in
(Num. 14:11-12, 20-23, 29, 31). From these words it is also manifest
that Jehovah willed to extinguish them, and consequently not to set up a
church among them, but that they insisted and it was therefore done -
besides many other times also, when Jehovah willed to utterly destroy
that nation so often rebellious, but as often suffered Himself to be
entreated by their supplications. \[4\] The like is also involved in
Balaam's not being permitted to curse that people (Num. 22, 23, 24); and
in other places also, where it is said that Jehovah repented that He had
brought in that people; also that Jehovah was entreated; and also that
He so often made a new covenant with them. Such things are signified in
the internal historical sense by the words "I will not let thee go,
unless thou bless me." The same is also signified by Jacob's taking away
the birthright from Esau, and also by his taking the blessing from him
by fraud (Gen. 25 and 27).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4291.">4291.</span></span>

In the internal historical sense, by he said unto him, What is thy name?
And he said Jacob, is signified that they were the posterity of Jacob
with their quality. This is evident from the signification of a "name,"
as being quality (see n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006); and
from the signification of "Jacob," as being his posterity (see n. 4281).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4292.">4292.</span></span>

In the internal historical sense by "he said, Thy name shall no more be
called Jacob, but Israel," is signified that they could not represent as
Jacob, but as from a new quality given them. This may be seen from the
meaning of "Jacob" in the Word, as being his posterity (see n. 4281);
and from the signification of a "name," as being quality (see just
above, n. 4291). The new quality itself is "Israel" in the internal
sense; for "Israel" is the celestial spiritual, thus the internal man
(n. 4286). And because "Israel" is the celestial spiritual and thus the
internal man, "Israel" is also the internal spiritual church; for
whether you speak of the spiritual man or the spiritual church, it is
the same thing; because the spiritual man is a church in particular, and
a number are a church in general. If a man were not a church in
particular, there would not be any church in general. A congregation in
general is what in common speech is called a church, but in order that
there may be any church, everyone in this congregation must be such as
is the church in general, because every general involves parts similar
to itself. \[2\] As regards the matter itself (that they could not
represent as Jacob, but as from a new quality given them, which is
"Israel") the case is this. It was specifically Jacob's posterity who
represented the church, but not Isaac's specifically; for Isaac's
posterity were not from Jacob only, but also from Esau. Still less was
it Abraham's posterity specifically; for Abraham's posterity were not
from Jacob only, but also from Esau, and likewise from Ishmael, as also
from his sons by his second wife Keturah - thus from Zimran, Jokshan,
Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah, and their sons (see Gen. 25:1-4). Now
as Jacob's posterity insisted on being representative (as shown just
above n. 4290), they could not represent as Jacob, nor as Isaac, nor as
Abraham. That they could not as Jacob was because Jacob represented the
external of the church, but not its internal; and they could not as
Isaac at the same time, nor as Abraham at the same time, for the reason
just adduced. \[3\] There was therefore no other way by which they could
represent the church than by a new name being given to Jacob, and
thereby a new quality; which new quality should signify the internal
spiritual man, or what is the same, the internal spiritual church. This
new quality is "Israel." Every church of the Lord is internal and
external, as has been repeatedly shown. The internal church is what is
represented, and the external is what represents. Moreover the internal
church is either spiritual or celestial. The internal spiritual church
was represented by Israel, and the internal celestial church was
afterwards represented by Judah. Therefore also a division was made, and
the Israelites were a kingdom by themselves, and the Jews were a kingdom
by themselves; but on this subject of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter.
Hence it is evident that Jacob (that is, the posterity of Jacob) could
not represent a church as Jacob, for this would be to represent only the
external of a church; but must also do so as Israel, because "Israel" is
the internal. \[4\] That the internal is what is represented, and the
external what represents, has been shown before, and may likewise be
seen from man himself. Man's speech represents his thought, and his
action represents his will. Speech and action are man's externals, and
thought and will are his internals. Furthermore, man's face itself, by
its varying looks, represents both his thought and his will. That the
face by its looks represents, is known to everyone; for with the sincere
their interior states may be seen from the looks of the face. In a word,
all things of the body represent what is of the animus and of the mind.
\[5\] The case is similar with the externals of the church, for these
are like a body, and the internals are like a soul - as the altars and
the sacrifices upon them, which as is known were external things; in
like manner the showbreads; also the lampstand with its lights; and
likewise the perpetual fire: that these represented internal things may
be known to everyone; and it is the same with the rest of the rites.
That these external things could not represent external but internal
things, is evident from what has been adduced. Thus Jacob could not
represent as Jacob, because "Jacob" is the external of the church; but
Jacob could represent as Israel, because "Israel" is its internal. This
is what is meant by the new quality given in order that the posterity of
Jacob might represent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4293.">4293.</span></span>

In the internal historical sense, by "for as a prince hast thou
contended with God and with men, and hast prevailed," is signified on
account of the contumacy which was in their phantasies and cupidities,
as is evident from the signification of "God" and from the signification
of "men" as being truths and goods (see n. 4287). These same words have
here an opposite sense, because in this sense they are said of the
posterity of Jacob, among whom (as shown above) there were interiorly no
truths and goods, but falsities and evils. Falsities are phantasies
because they are of phantasies, and evils are cupidities because they
are of cupidities. \[2\] That this nation insisted on being
representative, that is, they insisted that they should be the church
above all nations in the whole world, may be seen above (n. 4290). That
this was also permitted on account of the contumacy that was in their
phantasies and cupidities, is here meant. The nature of their phantasies
and their cupidities no one can know who has not had some interaction
with them in the other life; and in order that I might know it, this has
been granted me, so that I have occasionally spoken with them there.
More than all others they love themselves and they love the wealth of
the world; and more than all others they fear the loss of this honor,
and also the loss of gain; and therefore also at this day, as of old,
they despise all others in comparison with themselves, and likewise seek
wealth for themselves with the most intense application, and moreover
are timid. As this nation had been of this character from ancient times,
they could more than others be kept in a holy external without any holy
internal, and thus could represent in external form the things of the
church. It is these phantasies and these cupidities that have produced
such contumacy. \[3\] The same also appears from many things related of
them in the historicals of the Word. After being punished they could be
in such external humiliation as could no other people, for they could
lie prostrate on the ground for entire days and wallow in the dust, not
getting up until the third day; they could wail for many days, go in
sackcloth, in rent garments, with ashes or dust sprinkled upon their
heads; they could fast continuously for several days, and meanwhile
burst forth into bitter weeping. But these things they did solely from
bodily and earthly love, and from the fear of the loss of preeminence
and worldly wealth; for it was not anything internal that affected them,
because they knew not at all and did not even want to know what anything
internal is, such as that there is a life after death, and that there is
an eternal salvation. \[4\] From this it is evident that, being of such
a nature, they must needs be deprived of all holy internal, for this in
no wise agrees with such a holy external, because the two things are
utterly contrary to each other; and also that they could, better than
others, serve as the representative of the church, that is, could
represent holy things in an external form without any holy internal; and
thus that by means of this nation something of communication with the
heavens could be possible (see n. 4288).

Verses 29-32. And Jacob asked and said, Tell I pray thy name. And he
said, Wherefore is this that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed
him there. And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for I have
seen God faces to faces, and my soul is delivered. And the sun arose to
him as he passed over Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh. Therefore
the sons of Israel eat not the nerve of that which was displaced, which
is upon the hollow of the thigh, even unto this day, because he touched
in the hollow of Jacob's thigh the nerve of that which was displaced.
"And Jacob asked and said, Tell I pray thy name," signifies the angelic
heaven and its quality; "and he said, Wherefore is this that thou dost
ask after my name?" signifies that heaven was not willing to reveal
itself; "and he blessed him there," signifies conjunction with the
Divine celestial spiritual; "and Jacob called the name of the place
Peniel," signifies a state of temptations; "for I have seen God faces to
faces and my soul is delivered," signifies that He endured the most
grievous temptations as if they were from the Divine; "and the sun arose
to him," signifies the conjunction of goods; "as he passed over Penuel,"
signifies a state of truth in good; "and he halted upon his thigh,"
signified that truths were not yet disposed into such an order that all
together with good might enter into celestial spiritual good; "therefore
the sons of Israel eat not the nerve of that which was displaced, which
is upon the hollow of the thigh," signifies that those were not
appropriated in which were falsities; "even unto this day," signifies
even forever, that falsities should not be adjoined; "because he touched
in the hollow of Jacob's thigh the nerve of that which was displaced,"
signifies the reason, because they are falsities. \[2\] In the internal
historical sense, in which the posterity of Jacob is treated of, by
"Jacob asked and said, Tell I pray thy name," evil spirits are
signified; by "he said, Wherefore is this that thou dost ask after my
name?" is signified that from evil spirits they did not acknowledge; by
"he blessed him there," is signified that it was so done; by "Jacob
called the name of the place Peniel," is signified the state in that
they put on representations; by "for I have seen God faces to faces, and
my soul is delivered," is signified that He was present
representatively; by "the sun arose to him," is signified when they came
into representations; by "as he passed over Penuel," is signified when
they came into the land of Canaan; by "he halted upon his thigh," is
signified that goods and truths were altogether destroyed with that
posterity; by "therefore the sons of Israel eat not the nerve of that
which was displaced, which is upon the hollow of the thigh," is
signified that the posterity ought to know this; by "unto this day," is
signified that they are such forever; by "because he touched in the
hollow of Jacob's thigh the nerve of that which was displaced," is
signified because they had a heredity which could not be eradicated by
regeneration, because they would not allow this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4295.">4295.</span></span>

And Jacob asked and said, Tell I pray thy name. That this signifies the
angelic heaven and its quality, may be seen from the representation of
Jacob, as being the Lord as to the Divine natural (of which above); and
from the signification of "God," whose name he asked, and also of "men,"
with whom as a prince he contended and prevailed, as being truths and
goods, and thus those who are in truths and goods (see n. 4287). And
because the angelic heaven is heaven from truths and goods, it is
specifically this which is signified by the "God and men" with whom the
Lord prevailed. Occasionally also in the Word the angels are called
"gods," and this from truths and goods, as in David: God stood in the
congregation of god, He judged in the midst of the gods. I said, Ye are
gods, and all of you sons of the Most High (Ps. 82:1, 6); where it is
plainly evident that the "congregation of god," and the "gods," denote
the angelic heaven. In the same: Who in the sky can be compared unto
Jehovah? Who among the sons of the gods can be likened unto Jehovah?
(Ps. 89:6). Again: Confess ye to the God of gods; confess ye to the Lord
of lords (Ps. 136:2-3). From these passages, as also from the fact that
no one can contend as a prince with God and prevail, and likewise from
the fact that he who is called "God" was not willing to reveal his name,
it is evident that it was the angelic heaven with which the Lord fought.
That a deep secret lies hidden in these words is plainly evident from
the words themselves: "Wherefore is this that thou dost ask after my
name?" for if it had been Jehovah God, He would not have concealed his
name; nor would Jacob have asked, "What is thy name?" for to ask the
name implies that it is another or others than God Himself. \[2\] That
the Lord in temptations at last fought with the angels themselves, nay,
with the whole angelic heaven, is a secret that has not yet been
disclosed. But the case with regard to this matter is that the angels
are indeed in the highest wisdom and intelligence, but have all wisdom
and intelligence from the Divine of the Lord. From themselves, or from
what is their own, they have nothing of wisdom and intelligence. So far
therefore as they are in truths and goods from the Divine of the Lord,
so far they are wise and intelligent. That the angels have nothing of
wisdom and intelligence from themselves, they themselves openly confess;
nay, they are indignant if anyone ascribes to them anything of wisdom
and intelligence, for they know and perceive that this would be to take
away from the Divine that which is Divine, and to claim for themselves
that which is not theirs, and thus to incur the crime of spiritual
theft. The angels also say that all that is their own is evil and false,
both from their heredity and from actual life when they were men in the
world (n. 1880); and that the evil and falsity is not separated or wiped
away from them, they being thus justified, but that it all remains with
them, and that it is by the Lord that they are withheld from evil and
falsity and are kept in good and truth (n. 1581). All the angels confess
these things, and no one is admitted into heaven unless he knows and
believes them; for otherwise they cannot be in the light of wisdom and
intelligence which is from the Lord, consequently not in good and truth.
From this it may also be known how it is to be understood that heaven is
not pure in the eyes of God, as we read in Job 15:15. \[3\] This being
the case, in order that the Lord might reduce the universal heaven into
heavenly order, He admitted into Himself temptations from the angels
also, who, insofar as they were in what is their own, were so far not in
good and truth. These temptations are the inmost of all, for they act
solely into the ends, and with such subtlety as cannot possibly be
noticed. But insofar as they are not in what is their own, so far they
are in good and truth, and so far cannot tempt. Moreover the angels are
continually being perfected by the Lord, and yet can never to eternity
be so far perfected that their wisdom and intelligence can be compared
to the Divine wisdom and intelligence of the Lord; for they are finite,
and the Lord is infinite; and there is no comparison between what is
finite and what is infinite. From all this it can now be seen what is
meant by the god with whom Jacob as a prince contended; as also why he
was not willing to reveal his name.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4296.">4296.</span></span>

Wherefore is this that thou dost ask after my name? That this signifies
that heaven was not willing to reveal itself, is evident from what has
been said and shown just above (n. 4295).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4297.">4297.</span></span>

And he blessed him there. That this signifies conjunction with the
Divine celestial spiritual, is evident from the signification of "to
bless," as being conjunction (see n. 3504, 3514, 3565, 3584). That it is
conjunction with the Divine celestial spiritual, is evident from what
precedes respecting Jacob, in that he was named Israel; for by Israel is
represented the Lord as to the Divine celestial spiritual (n. 4286).
What the celestial spiritual is, may also be seen in the same number.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4298.">4298.</span></span>

And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel. That this signifies a
state of temptations, is evident from the series of the things; for in
old times names were given to the places where anything peculiar
happened that were significative of the thing which happened there and
of its state (n. 340, 2643, 3422). To this place was given a name which
signified a state of temptations, for a state of temptations is here
described by the wrestling and contention of Jacob. In the original
language "Peniel" means "the faces of God," and "to see the faces of
God" denotes to endure the most grievous temptations, as will be
explained in what now follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4299.">4299.</span></span>

For I have seen God faces to faces, and my soul is delivered. That this
signifies that He endured the most grievous temptations as if they were
from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "seeing God," as
being an approach to Him through things interior, namely, goods and
truths, hence denoting presence (see n. 4198); and from the
signification of "faces," as being things interior (n. 1999, 2434, 3527,
3573, 4066), consequently the thoughts and affections, for thoughts and
affections are interior things, because they are of the animus and of
the mind, and manifest themselves in the face; and from the
signification of "my soul is delivered," as being to endure, namely, the
Divine presence. That by all these things is signified that He endured
the most grievous temptations as if they were from the Divine, cannot
appear except from the causes of temptations both proximate and remote.
The proximate causes are the evils and falsities in the man, which lead
him into temptations, consequently the evil spirits and genii who pour
them in (n. 4249). Nevertheless no one can be tempted (that is, undergo
any spiritual temptation) except him who has conscience; for spiritual
temptation is nothing else than torment of conscience; and consequently
none can be tempted except those who are in celestial and spiritual
good, for these have conscience, and all others have not, and do not
even know what conscience is. \[2\] Conscience is a new will and a new
understanding from the Lord; thus it is the Lord's presence in a man;
and this the nearer, in proportion as the man is in the affection of
good or of truth. If the Lord's presence is nearer than in proportion as
the man is in the affection of good or of truth, the man comes into
temptation. The reason is that the evils and falsities which are in the
man, tempered by the goods and truths that are in him, cannot endure a
nearer presence. This may be seen from the things that take place in the
other life: that evil spirits cannot possibly approach any heavenly
society without beginning to feel anguish and torment; also that evil
spirits cannot endure to have angels look upon them, for they are
instantly tortured and fall into a swoon; and also from the fact that
hell is remote from heaven, for the reason that it cannot endure heaven,
that is, the Lord's presence which is in heaven. This is the reason why
it is said of such in the Word: Then shall they begin to say to the
mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Hide us (Luke 23:30). And
elsewhere: They shall say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall down
upon us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne
(Rev. 6:16). Moreover the foggy and pitch-dark sphere which exhales from
the evils and falsities of those who are in hell appears like a mountain
or rock, under which they are hidden (see n. 1265, 1267, 1270). \[3\]
From all this it can now be known that the words, "I have seen God faces
to faces, and my soul is delivered," signify the most grievous
temptations as if they were from the Divine. Temptations and torments
appear as if from the Divine, because, as before said, they come forth
through the Lord's Divine presence; but still they are not from the
Divine, or from the Lord, but from the evils and falsities which are in
him who is being tempted or tormented. For from the Lord nothing
proceeds but the Holy which is good and true and merciful. This Holy,
which is good and true and merciful, is what those who are in evils and
falsities cannot endure, because they are opposites or contraries.
Evils, falsities, and unmercifulness are continually intent upon doing
violence to these holy things; and insofar as they assault them, so far
they are tormented; and when they assault them, and are consequently
tormented, they suppose that it is the Divine which torments them. These
things are what are meant by the words "as if they were from the
Divine." \[4\] That no one can see Jehovah face to face, and live, was
known to the ancients, and this knowledge was handed down from them to
the posterity of Jacob; for which reason they rejoiced so greatly when
they saw an angel and yet lived. As in the book of Judges: Gideon saw
that he was the angel of Jehovah; and therefore Gideon said, Lord
Jehovih! Forasmuch as I have seen the angel of Jehovah face to face. And
Jehovah said unto him, Peace be unto thee, fear not, thou shalt not die
(Judg. 6:22-23). In the same book: Manoah said unto his wife, We shall
surely die, because we have seen God (Judg. 13:22). And in Moses:
Jehovah said unto Moses, Thou canst not see My faces, for man shall not
see Me, and live (Exod. 33:20). \[5\] When it is said of Moses that he
spoke with Jehovah face to face (Exod. 33:11), and that Jehovah knew him
face to face (Deut. 34:10), the meaning is that Jehovah appeared to him
in a human form adapted to his reception, which was external, namely, as
an old man with a beard, sitting with him - as I have been instructed by
the angels. It was from this also that the Jews had no other idea of
Jehovah than as of a very old man, with a long and snowy beard, who
could do greater miracles than other gods. Not that they accounted Him
the most holy, for what holiness was they did not know; still less that
they could by any possibility see the Holy that proceeds from Him,
because they were in bodily and earthly love, without any holy internal
(n. 4289, 4293).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4300.">4300.</span></span>

And the sun arose to him. That this signifies conjunction of goods, is
evident from the signification of the "sun arising," as being the
conjunction of goods. That by the "dawn coming up" is signified when
conjunction is at hand, or is commencing, see n. 4283. From this it
follows that the "sun arose" denotes the conjunction itself; for in the
internal sense the "sun" signifies celestial love (n. 1529, 1530, 2441,
2495, 3636, 3643, 4060); consequently it signifies goods, for these are
of this love. When celestial love manifests itself with a man (that is,
when it is observed), the sun is said "to arise" upon him, for the goods
of this love are then conjoined with him.
