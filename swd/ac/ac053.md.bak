### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="2601.">2601.</span></span>

Some are reduced into a state of tranquillity, as it were a kind of
sleep; and they then seem to themselves to be building small cities, and
in the midst of them to hide some secret thing which they wish to
preserve from violence. They give these cities to others, with
entreaties not to do violence to the secret thing in the midst of them.
Innocence is thus insinuated into them, and also charity, together with
the idea that the secret thing is concerning the Lord. They are kept in
this state a considerable time. It is a state of ignorance in which
there is innocence. They are guarded by little children, lest anyone
should do them harm. I have spoken with them, and have been much
affected by their state of innocence and charity, and also by the
solicitude with which they hide the secret, and by the holy fear lest it
should be violated.

There is one nation (I was told that it is from the Indies) which makes
it their religion to worship the Greatest God with the following rite.
When they are adoring Him they first magnify themselves, but soon
prostrate themselves as worms; and at the same time they hold, that
above the universe, which they believe to be whirling around, is that
Greatest God, looking down on what they are doing. As they have had such
religious observances, in the other life they are brought back into
them; and I have spoken with them while they imagined such things. They
are for the most part modest, obedient, and simple in heart. They are by
successive steps freed by the angels from this phantasy; for they are
instructed, in accordance with their religion, that the Greatest God is
the Lord; and that they can indeed magnify themselves on account of
their being able to adore Him; and that nevertheless they are like
little worms; and that the Lord from on high sees each and all things.
In this manner, by means of their own religion, they are brought into
the knowledges of good and truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2603.">2603.</span></span>

There are some Gentiles from those regions where they are black, who
bring with them from their life in the world a wish to be treated
severely; believing that no one can come into heaven except through
punishments and afflictions, and that they will afterwards receive more
gladsome things, which they call paradisal. As they have such ideas from
their religion they are at first treated severely in the other life by
some whom they call devils, and are afterwards taken to the paradises
already described (n. 1622). But they are instructed by the angels that
their punishments and afflictions are turned by the Lord into what is
good for them, as with those who are in temptations; also that paradisal
things are not heaven, but that heaven is the affection of the celestial
and spiritual things that are in them; and that they have been in a
certain way of truth, although in the shade of ignorance. They spoke
with me a long time. While in their state of affliction their speech was
attended with a kind of collision; thus was distinct from that of
others; but after their afflictions were over, and they were taken up to
the paradises, they no longer had such a speech, but one that was almost
angelic. From their religion they have that they believe, and desire to
have interior things. They said that whenever they are treated severely
they are black; but that they shortly put off the blackness, and put on
whiteness; knowing that their souls are white, but their bodies black.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2604.">2604.</span></span>

It is usual for Gentiles who adore any god under an image or statue, or
any carved thing, to be introduced, on coming into the other life, to
certain ones who are in the place of their gods or idols, in order that
they may put away their phantasies; and when they have been with these
for some days, they are taken away from such persons. They who have
adored men are also sometimes introduced to them, or to others in their
stead; as many of the Jews are to Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and David; but
when they perceive that these have the same kind of human nature as
others have, and can afford them no help, they become ashamed, and are
taken to their own places in accordance with their life. Among the
Gentiles in the other life the Africans are the most beloved, because
they receive the goods and truths of heaven more easily than others.
They especially desire to be called the obedient, but not the faithful.
They say that Christians can be called faithful, because they have the
doctrine of faith; but not they, unless they receive it, or as they say,
are able to receive it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2605.">2605.</span></span>

I have spoken with some who were in the Ancient Church, and who then
knew concerning the Lord that He was to come, and who had been imbued
with the goods of faith, but yet fell away and became idolaters. They
were in front, toward the left, in a darksome place, and in a miserable
state. Their speech was like the sound of a fife, of one tone, almost
devoid of rationality of thought. They said that they had been there for
many ages, and that they are sometimes taken out thence to serve others
for some uses, which are vile. From these it was given me to think about
many Christians, who are idolaters not exteriorly but interiorly, and
who at heart deny the Lord, and thereby also the truths of faith; and to
reflect upon what kind of a lot must await them in the other life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2606.">2606.</span></span>

CHAPTER 21 The Word of the Old Testament was formerly called the "Law
and the Prophets." By the "Law" were meant all the historical books,
which are the five books of Moses, and those of Joshua, Judges, Samuel,
and Kings: by the "Prophets" were meant all the prophetical books, which
are those of Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos,
Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zephaniah,
Malachi; and also the Psalms of David. The historical books of the Word
are also called "Moses;" hence it is occasionally said, "Moses and the
Prophets," instead of the "Law and the Prophets;" and the prophetical
books are called "Elias" (see the preface to the eighteenth chapter of
Genesis).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2607.">2607.</span></span>

As regards the historicals they are all historically true, except those
in the first chapters of Genesis, which are made up history, as shown in
volume 1. Yet although they are historically true, they nevertheless
have an internal sense; and in that sense, like the propheticals, treat
solely of the Lord. They do indeed treat of heaven and the church, and
of what belongs to heaven and the church, but as these are of the Lord,
through these the historicals look to the Lord, and therefore are the
Word. The historic events are all representative, and every word by
which they are described is significative. That the historic events are
representative is evident from what has been unfolded thus far
concerning Abraham, and will be further evident from what of the Lord's
Divine mercy is to be explained concerning Isaac, Jacob, and his twelve
sons; concerning Egypt, the sojourning of the people in the wilderness,
their entrance into the land of Canaan, etc. \[2\] That every word by
which these historicals are described is significative, is also evident
from what has been shown for instance in regard to the names as
signifying actual things; thus "Egypt" signifies memory-knowledge,
"Asshur" the rational, "Ephraim" the intellectual, "Tyre" knowledges,
"Zion" the celestial church, "Jerusalem" the spiritual church, and so
on. The same has been shown in regard to the words; as that "king"
signifies truth, "priest" good, and that all other words have their
respective internal significance; such as "kingdom," "city," "house,"
"nation," "people," "garden," "vineyard," "oliveyard," "gold," "silver,"
"brass," "iron," "birds," "beasts," "bread," "wine," "oil," "morning,"
"day," "light;" and this uniformly in both the historical and the
prophetical books, although they were written by various individuals,
and at different times-a uniformity that would not be possible unless
the Word had come down from heaven. From this it may be known that there
is an internal sense in the Word; as well as from the fact that the
Divine Word cannot treat of mere men, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
their posterity (which was the worst of nations); of their kings, their
wives, sons, and daughters; of harlots, plunderings, and such things,
which, considered in themselves, are not worthy to be even mentioned in
the Word, unless by them are represented and signified such things as
are in the Lord's kingdom: it is these things that are worthy of the
Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2608.">2608.</span></span>

Similar to these also are very many things in the Prophets, such as
those adduced above (n. 1888); and also the following in Isaiah: Moab
shall howl, all Moab shall howl, for the foundations of Kirhareseth
shall ye mourn howbeit ye have been bruised; for the fields of Heshbon
have failed, the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations break down the
shoots, they reached even unto Jazer, they wandered in the wilderness,
her offshoots have been torn away; they have passed over the sea.
Therefore with weeping will I weep for Jazer, for the vine of Sibmah; I
will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh; for upon thy
vintage and upon thy harvest the shout is fallen (Isa. 16:7-9). In
Jeremiah: The voice of a cry from Horonaim, wasting and great
destruction, Moab is broken to pieces, her little ones have caused a cry
to be heard; for by the ascent of Luhith with weeping a weeping goeth
up; for in the going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of a
breaking to pieces. Judgment is come unto the land of the plain, unto
Holon, and unto Jahzah, and unto Mephaath, and upon Dibon, and upon
Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim, and upon Kiriathaim, and upon
Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon, and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah (Jer.
48:3-5, 21-24). Such in very many places is the character of the
propheticals of the Word, which would be of no use unless they had an
internal sense; and yet the Word, being Divine, must needs contain
within itself the laws of that Heavenly Kingdom into which man is to
come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2609.">2609.</span></span>

But as regards the Precepts of Life, such as all things in the
Decalogue, and many in the Law and the Prophets-these, being of service
to man's very life, are of use in both senses, both the literal and the
internal. The things contained in the literal sense were for the people
and peoples of that period, who did not apprehend internal things; and
the things contained in the internal sense were for the angels, who have
no care for external things. Unless the precepts of the Decalogue
contained internal things also, they would never have been promulgated
on Mount Sinai with so great a miracle; for such things as it contains,
such as that parents are to be honored, that men must not steal, must
not kill, must not commit adultery, must not covet what is another's,
are things which the Gentiles also know and have prescribed in their
laws; and which the sons of Israel as men must have been well acquainted
with, without such a promulgation. But as those precepts were for the
service of life, in both senses, and were as external forms produced
from internal, that corresponded to each other-this was the reason why
they came down out of heaven upon Mount Sinai with so great a miracle,
and in their internal sense were uttered and heard in heaven, while in
their external sense they were uttered and heard on earth. \[2\] Take as
an example the promise that they who honor their parents shall have
their days prolonged upon the land: by "parents" the angels in heaven
perceived the Lord; by the "land," His kingdom, which those who worship
Him from love and faith should eternally possess as sons and heirs;
whereas by "parents" men on earth understood parents; by "land," the
land of Canaan; by the "prolongation of their days," the years of their
life. Take again the precept that men must not steal: by this the angels
who were in heaven perceived that they should take nothing away from the
Lord, and should not claim anything of righteousness and merit for
themselves; whereas men on earth understood that they must not steal;
from which we can see that these precepts are true in both senses. Take
again the precept that men must not kill: by this the angels in heaven
perceived that they should not hate anyone, and should not extinguish
anything of good and truth with anyone; whereas men on earth understood
that their friends must not be killed. The case is the same with all the
other precepts. GENESIS 21 1. And Jehovah visited Sarah, as He had said;
and Jehovah did unto Sarah as He had spoken. 2. And Sarah conceived and
bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time, as God had
spoken with him. 3. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born
unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. 4. And Abraham circumcised
Isaac his son, a son of eight days, as God had commanded him. 5. And
Abraham was a son of a hundred years when Isaac his son was born unto
him. 6. And Sarah said, God hath made laughter for me, everyone that
heareth will laugh with me. 7. And she said, Who would have said unto
Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons? For I have borne a son to his old age.
8. And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great feast,
on the day when he weaned Isaac. 9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the
Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Abraham, mocking. 10. And she said
unto Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this
handmaid shall not inherit with my son, with Isaac. 11. And the word was
evil exceedingly in the eyes of Abraham, on account of his son. 12. And
God said unto Abraham, Let it not be evil in thine eyes because of the
boy, and because of thine handmaid; all that Sarah saith unto thee,
hearken unto her voice, for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 13. And
also the son of the handmaid I will make a nation, because he is thy
seed. 14. And Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread, and a
bottle of water, and gave to Hagar, and put them on her shoulder, and
the child, and sent her away; and she went and wandered in the
wilderness of Beersheba. 15. And the water was spent out of the bottle,
and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. 16. And she went and sat
by herself over against him, withdrawing about a bowshot; for she said,
Let me not see the death of the child; and she sat over against him; and
she lifted up her voice, and wept. 17. And God heard the voice of the
child, and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto
her, What aileth thee, Hagar? Fear not, for God hath heard the voice of
the child where he is. 18. Arise, lift up the child, and strengthen thy
hand in him, for I will make him a great nation. 19. And God opened her
eyes, and she saw a well of water, and she went and filled the bottle
with water, and gave the child drink. 20. And God was with the child,
and he grew, and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became a shooter of the
bow. 21. And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took
him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 22. And it came to pass at that
time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his army said unto
Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest. 23. And now
swear unto me here by God, that thou wilt not be false to me, nor to my
son, nor to my son's son; according to the kindness that I have done
unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast
sojourned. 24. And Abraham said, I will swear. 25. And Abraham reproved
Abimelech, because of the well of water which Abimelech's servants had
taken away. 26. And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this word,
neither didst thou tell me, neither heard I of it, but today. 27. And
Abraham took flock and herd, and gave to Abimelech, and they two struck
a covenant. 28. And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by
themselves. 29. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What are these seven
ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 30. And he said, Because
these seven ewe lambs thou shalt take from my hand, that it may be a
witness unto me that I have digged this well. 31. Therefore he called
that place Beersheba, because there they sware both of them. 32. And
they struck a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol
the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the
Philistines. 33. And he planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there
on the name of the God of eternity. 34. And Abraham sojourned in the
land of the Philistines many days.

THE CONTENTS. In the internal sense of this chapter the Lord's Divine
Rational is first treated of, which is represented by "Isaac" (verses
1-8).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2611.">2611.</span></span>

Next the merely human rational, which was then separated, and which is
the "son of Hagar the Egyptian" (verses 9-12).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2612.">2612.</span></span>

After this had been separated, the spiritual church is represented by
the same, namely, by Hagar's son, as well as by his mother; which church
and its state are treated of in verses 13-21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2613.">2613.</span></span>

Concerning the human rational things that were adjoined to the doctrine
of faith, which in itself is Divine (verses 22-34).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2614.">2614.</span></span>

This doctrine together with those things adjoined is "Beersheba" (verses
14, 31, 33).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2615.">2615.</span></span>

THE INTERNAL SENSE Verse 1. And Jehovah visited Sarah, as he had said;
and Jehovah did unto Sarah as He had spoken. "Jehovah visited Sarah,"
signifies the presence of the Divine celestial in the Divine spiritual;
"as He had said," signifies as He had perceived; "and Jehovah did unto
Sarah," signifies the state of unition; "as He had spoken" signifies as
He had thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2616.">2616.</span></span>

Jehovah visited Sarah. That this signifies the presence of the Divine
celestial in the Divine spiritual, is evident from the signification of
"Jehovah," as being the Divine celestial, that is, the Divine Good, or
Esse (Being) itself, which, because it is of love and mercy, is Good
itself; from the signification of "visiting," as meaning to be present;
and from the signification of "Sarah," as being the Divine spiritual,
that is, Divine truth (see n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2507).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2617.">2617.</span></span>

As He had said. That this signifies as He had perceived, is evident from
the signification in the historical parts of the Word of "saying," as
meaning to perceive (see n. 2238, 2260, 2552).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2618.">2618.</span></span>

And Jehovah did unto Sarah. That this signifies the state of unition,
namely, of the Lord's Divine spiritual in His Divine celestial, is
evident from the signification of "doing," when predicated of the Lord's
Divine, as being the sum total of the effect, consequently the state;
and from the signification of "Jehovah," and also of "Sarah" (concerning
which see above, n. 2616). As regards the state of unition of the Lord's
Divine spiritual in His Divine celestial, this is the very marriage
itself of good and truth, from which comes the heavenly marriage; and
this marriage is the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth. For
this reason the Lord's kingdom is so frequently in the Word called a
"marriage," and is compared to a marriage. The reason (a secret one) is
that all conjugial love (and through this all celestial and spiritual
love) comes from the marriage of Divine good and truth, and of Divine
truth and good, in the Lord. What further arcana are enfolded in these
words: that "Jehovah visited Sarah as He had said," and that "Jehovah
did unto Sarah as He had spoken," cannot be declared, because they are
inexpressible; for they comprise the very state itself of the unition of
the Lord's Divine with His Human. Appearances of this are presented by
the Lord before the angels by means of heavenly lights, and are
illustrated by means of ineffable representations; but they cannot be
presented before men, because it would have to be done by means of such
things as belong to the light of the world, into which such arcana do
not fall; nay, by a description based on such things they become more
obscure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2619.">2619.</span></span>

As He had spoken. That this signifies as He had thought, is evident from
the signification of "speaking," as being to think (see n. 2271, 2287).
The perception which is signified by "Jehovah said" was from the Divine
celestial; but the thought which is signified by "Jehovah spoke" was
from the Divine celestial through the Divine spiritual; and there is
therefore an apparent repetition in the sense of the letter, namely, "as
He said," and "as He spake." But what it is to perceive from the Divine
celestial and to think from the Divine celestial through the Divine
spiritual, does not fall into even the most enlightened apprehension by
means of things that belong to the light of the world. This shows how
infinite the rest of the Word may be. (That thought is from perception
may be seen above, n. 1919, 2515.) With man the case is this: it is good
from which he perceives, but it is truth by means of which he thinks.
Good is of love and its affections, consequently from it is perception;
but truth is of faith, consequently this is of thought. The former is
signified in the historic parts of the Word by "saying," but the latter
by "speaking." But when "saying" is found alone, it then sometimes
signifies perceiving, and sometimes thinking; because "saying" involves
both.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2620.">2620.</span></span>

Verse 2. And Sarah conceived and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
the appointed time, as God had spoken with him. She "conceived and
bare," signifies that it was and came forth; "Sarah bare Abraham,"
signifies from the unition of the Lord's Divine spiritual with His
Divine celestial; "a son" signifies the Divine rational; "in his old
age," signifies when the days were fulfilled that He should put off the
human; "at the appointed time," signifies when the rational was such as
to receive; "as God had spoken with him," signifies as He had willed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2621.">2621.</span></span>

That "conceived and bare" signifies that it Was and Came forth, namely
(as follows) the Divine rational, from the unition of the Lord's Divine
spiritual with His Divine celestial, is evident from the signification
of "conceiving and bearing." That in the internal sense of the Word no
other conceptions and bearings are meant than those which are spiritual
and celestial, may be seen above (n. 2584); but here those which were
Divine, because the subject here treated of is the Lord's rational made
Divine; and of Him, namely, the Lord, Being and Coming forth \[Esse et
Existere\] are chiefly predicated; for He alone Is and Comes forth. As
regards Being and Coming forth (Esse et Existere) we may add that they
seem as if they were nearly the same, but are not the same. Every person
and every thing, has its Being from conception, but its Coming forth
from birth; and thus, as conception is prior to birth, so Being is prior
to Coming forth. \[2\] The soul is the Being itself of man, and the
sensitive or corporeal faculty is its Coming forth, for the former comes
forth in the latter. Celestial and spiritual love are the very Being of
the man who is being regenerated; and the rational and sensitive
faculties, when imbued with that love, are his Coming forth. And so it
is with each and all things in the universe; for there is nothing
whatever which has not its conception that it may Be, and its birth that
it may Come forth; which may also be illustrated in the terms of
philosophy by saying that every effect has its cause, and every cause
has its end. The end is the Being of the cause, and the cause is the
Coming forth of the end. In the same way, the cause is the Being of the
effect, and the effect is the Coming forth of the cause.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2622.">2622.</span></span>

Sarah to Abraham. That this signifies from the unition of the Divine
spiritual with the Divine celestial, is evident from the representation
of Sarah, as being the Divine spiritual, or Divine Truth (see n. 1468,
1901, 2063, 2065, 2172, 2173, 2198, 2507); and from the representation
of Abraham, as being the Divine celestial, or Divine Good (see n. 1989,
2011, 2172, 2198, 2501). (Concerning the unition of the Divine spiritual
with the Divine celestial, see what was said above, n. 2618.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="2623.">2623.</span></span>

A son. That this signifies the Divine rational is evident from the
signification of a "son." In the internal sense of the Word a "son"
signifies truth (n. 489, 491, 533); and as truth is the chief thing in
the rational (n. 2072, 2189), the rational is also signified by a "son;"
but here the Divine rational, in which principally there is good, which
Isaac, who is the "son," also represents (concerning which hereafter).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2624.">2624.</span></span>

In his old age. That this signifies when the days were fulfilled that
the human should be put off, is evident from the signification of "old
age," as being the state when the human should be put off and the Divine
put on (see n. 2198); for Abraham was at that time a hundred years old;
and by this number is signified a full state of unition, as will be seen
in the explication at verse 5.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2625.">2625.</span></span>

At the appointed time. That this signifies when the rational was such as
to receive, is evident from the signification of "time." There are two
things which while man lives in the world appear to be essential,
because they are proper to nature, namely, space and time. Hence to live
in space and time is to live in the world or in nature. But in the other
life these two things are of no consequence. In the world of spirits
indeed they do appear to be of some consequence, for the reason that
spirits fresh from the body still retain the idea of natural things; yet
it is not long before they perceive that there is no space and time
there, but state instead; and that in the other life states correspond
to spaces and times in nature; to spaces states as to Being \[esse\],
and to times states as to Coming forth \[existere\]. (In regard to space
or place see above, n. 1274, 1379, 1380, 1382.) \[2\] From this anyone
can see what kind of an idea a man may have, while in the world or in
nature, respecting the things of the other life and many arcana of
faith; namely, that he is not willing to believe them until he
apprehends them by means of the things in the world, nay, by sensuous
things; for he must needs suppose that if he were to put off the idea of
space and time, and still more space and time themselves, he would
become absolutely nothing; and thus that he would have nothing left from
which he could feel and think, except something confused and
incomprehensible; when yet the case is exactly the reverse. Angelic life
is of such a nature as to be the wisest and happiest of all. \[3\] This
is the reason why in the Word "ages" in the internal sense do not
signify ages, but states; so that in this verse "old age" does not mean
old age. And in the same way the numbers do not signify numbers, but
some specific state, as for instance the number a hundred years,
concerning which hereafter. From this we can now see that by the
"appointed time" is signified the state when the rational was such as to
receive. \[4\] In regard to the specific matter here treated of, namely,
that the Divine rational was and came forth from the unition of the
Divine spiritual with the Divine celestial of the Lord, when the days
were fulfilled for the human to be put off, and when the rational was
such as to receive (all of which is signified in the internal sense by
Sarah's conceiving and bearing to Abraham a son to his old age at the
appointed time), be it known that the human begins in the inmost of the
rational (see n. 2106, 2194); and that the Lord advanced successively to
the union of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence, and of the
Divine Essence with the Human Essence (n. 1864, 2033, 2523); and this by
His own power (n. 1921, 2025, 2026, 2083), by continual temptations and
victories (n. 1737, 1813, 1690), and by continual revelations from His
Divine (n. 1616, 2500); and this until at length He had expelled all the
maternal human (n. 1414, 1444, 2574); and thus had made His Human Divine
in respect to the rational, according to the things contained in this
verse. Hence it is manifest what is to be understood by the days being
fulfilled for the human to be put off, and by the rational being such as
to receive. \[5\] Some idea of this may be formed from what takes place
in those who are being regenerated. The celestial things of love and the
spiritual things of faith are not at once implanted in them by the Lord,
but successively; and when by means of them the man's rational has
become such that it can receive, then for the first time is he becoming
regenerate, for the most part by means of temptations in which he
conquers. When these things take place, the days are fulfilled for him
to put off the old man, and to put on the new. (Concerning man's
regeneration, see above, n. 677, 679, 711, 848, 986, 1555, 2475.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="2626.">2626.</span></span>

As God had spoken with him. That this signifies as He had willed, is
evident from the signification of "speaking," as being to think (see n.
2271, 2287, 2619); but that here it means to will is because it is said,
"as God had spoken;" since for the Divine to think is to will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2627.">2627.</span></span>

Verse 3. And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac. "Abraham called the name of his son that
was born unto him," signifies the quality of the rational as being
Divine; "whom Sarah bare to him," signifies that it was and came forth
from the Divine spiritual united to the Divine celestial; "Isaac"
signifies the Divine rational.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2628.">2628.</span></span>

Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him. That this
signifies the quality of the rational as being Divine, is evident from
the representation of Abraham, as being the Lord as to the Divine
celestial, or the Divine Good, treated of many times before; and from
the signification of "calling a name," as being the quality (see n. 144,
145, 1754, 1896, 2009); and from the signification of his "son," as
being the rational (see n. 2623); and also from the signification of his
being "born unto him," as being to come forth from the Divine. Hence it
is evident that "Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto
him," signifies the quality of the rational as being Divine. From these
few words three arcana shine forth for those who are in the internal
sense: First, that the Lord's Divine Human came forth \[exstiterit\]
from the Divine Itself; which is further treated of in this verse.
Second, that the Lord's Divine Human was not only conceived, but also
born, of Jehovah, and hence the Lord as to His Divine Human is called
the "Son of God," and the "Only-begotten" (John 1:14, 18, 50; 3:16, 18,
35-36; 5:19-27; 6:69; 9:35; 10:36; 11:27; 14:13-14; 17:1; 20:31; and in
like manner in the other Evangelists). Third, that the Lord's Divine
Human is the "name" of Jehovah, that is, His quality (see John 12:28).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2629.">2629.</span></span>

Whom Sarah bare to him. That this signifies being and coming forth from
the Divine spiritual united to the Divine celestial is evident from the
signification of "bearing," as being to come forth \[existere\] (see n.
2621); and as birth involves conception, and the birth or coming forth
is from the Divine spiritual, and the conception, or being, from the
Divine celestial, which two have now been united, hence "bearing" here
signifies both being and coming forth; and also from the representation
of Sarah, as being the Divine spiritual united to the Divine celestial
(see n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2172, 2173, 2198, 2507). These things
are arcana too deep to be described, or indeed to be illustrated by
anything in this world. They are for angelic minds, to whom they are
presented in the light of heaven by means of things ineffable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2630.">2630.</span></span>

Isaac. That this signifies the Divine Rational, is evident from what has
been said before concerning Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (n. 1893, 2066,
2083), namely, that Abraham represents the supreme Divine, Isaac the
Divine rational, and Jacob His Divine natural; as will also be seen
hereafter, where Isaac is treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2631.">2631.</span></span>

Verse 4. And Abraham circumcised Isaac his son, a son of eight days, as
God commanded him. "Abraham circumcised Isaac his son," signifies the
purification of the rational; "a son of eight days," signifies a
beginning and continuance; "as God had commanded him," signifies
according to Divine order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2632.">2632.</span></span>

Abraham circumcised Isaac his son. That this signifies the purification
of the rational, is evident from the signification of "being
circumcised," which is to be purified (see n. 2039); and from the
representation of "Isaac," as being the Divine rational (see n. 2630).
\[2\] That the Lord's first rational was born as with others, namely, by
means of knowledges \[scientifica et cognitiones\], has been stated
before, where Ishmael was treated of, by whom that rational is
represented. As this was born by means of knowledges, thus by the
external way, which is that of the senses, and as with others, it could
not but have in itself many things from the outward world, for from them
are the ideas of the rational procured; and this the more because it had
its hereditary from the mother. It was these worldly things and this
hereditary which the Lord successively expelled from His rational, and
this until it was such as to be able to receive the Divine (n. 2624,
2625). The Lord's Divine rational was then born, which is represented by
Isaac (n. 2630); not however by the external way, which is that of the
senses, as the former rational was; but by the internal way from the
Divine Itself (n. 2628, 2629). As this was not done at once, but
successively (n. 1690, 2033), it was purified, and this continually;
which is signified by "Abraham's circumcising his son, a son of eight
days." That the Lord made His rational Divine by successive steps, and
continually purified it, is evident also in John: Jesus said, Father,
glorify Thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven: I have both
glorified, and will glorify again (John 12:28). That to "glorify" is to
make Divine, may be seen above (n. 1603, 1999). \[3\] In the Ancient
Church nothing else was represented and signified by circumcision than
that a man should be purified from the loves of self and of the world,
and this also by successive steps and continually (see n. 2039, 2046 at
the end, 2049, 2056); especially when he has been born a new man, that
is, when he has been regenerated; for the Lord then flows in by the
internal way, that is, by the good of conscience, and successively and
continually separates the things which adhere both from hereditary and
from actual evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2633.">2633.</span></span>

A son of eight days. That this signifies a beginning and continuance, is
evident from the signification of the "eighth day," on which they were
circumcised, as being any beginning, and thus continuance (see n. 2044).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2634.">2634.</span></span>

As God had commanded him. That this signifies according to Divine order,
is evident from the signification of "God commanding," or of His
precepts. God's precepts, or the things which God has commanded, are all
things that are of Divine order both in general and in particular; so
that Divine order is nothing but the perpetual precept of God; and
therefore to live according to the precepts of God, and to live in the
precepts of God, is to live according to Divine order and in Divine
order. Hence it is that by "as God commanded," is signified according to
Divine order. It was according to Divine order that every male should be
circumcised on the eighth day from his birth; not that circumcision was
of any avail, or that they who were circumcised would enter into the
kingdom of God before the uncircumcised; but because in the
representative church such a rite corresponded to the purification of
the heart; which correspondence will of the Lord's Divine mercy be
spoken of elsewhere. It is of Divine order that the heart, that is,
man's interiors, should be purified gradually and continually from the
evils of cupidities, and from the falsities of the phantasies thence
derived. The precepts relating to the purification of the heart are all
things of Divine order both in general and in particular. Insofar
therefore as a man lives in those precepts, so far he lives in Divine
order; and insofar as he lives in this, so far all things in him, both
of reason and memory, are disposed by the Lord according to the order
which is from Him in the heavens. Hence the man becomes a little heaven
corresponding to the greatest.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2635.">2635.</span></span>

Verse 5. And Abraham was a son of a hundred years when Isaac his son was
born unto him. "Abraham was a son of a hundred years," signifies a full
state of unition; "when Isaac his son was born unto him," signifies when
the Lord's rational was made Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2636.">2636.</span></span>

Abraham was a son of a hundred years. That this signifies a full state
of unition, is evident from the signification of a "hundred," as being
what is full (concerning which presently); and from the signification of
"years," as being state (see n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 893); here, a state
of unition. What a full state of unition of the Lord's Divine with His
Human is, or what is the same, with His rational (for the human begins
in the inmost of the rational, n. 2106, 2194), cannot so well be told to
the apprehension, but still can be illustrated by what is called with
man a full state when he is being reformed and regenerated. \[2\] It is
known that a man cannot be regenerated until adult age, because he then
for the first time has the full exercise of reason and judgment, and
thus can receive good and truth from the Lord. Before he comes into this
state he is being prepared by the Lord by such things being insinuated
into him as may serve him as ground for receiving the seeds of good and
truth; which are the many states of innocence and charity, and also the
knowledges of good and truth, and the thoughts derived from them. This
preparation is going on for some years before his regeneration
commences. When the man has been imbued with these things, and is thus
prepared, his state is then said to be full; for his interiors are then
disposed for receiving. All those things with which a man is endowed by
the Lord before regeneration, and by means of which he is regenerated,
are called remains, which are signified in the Word by the number "ten"
(n. 576, 1738, 2284); and also by a "hundred," when the state for
regeneration is full (n. 1988). \[3\] These things may serve for
illustration as to what is signified by a full state of unition of the
Human with the Divine in the Lord, namely, when from His own power, by
means of the combats of temptations and by victories, and by the powers
of the Divine wisdom and intelligence, He had procured to Himself so
much of the Divine in His Human, that is, in His rational, as to be able
to unite the Divine Itself to the Divine acquired in the rational. That
this state might be represented, it was brought to pass that, although
Abraham had dwelt for many years in the land of Canaan, Isaac was not
born to him until he was a hundred years old. These are the arcana
contained in the number a "hundred years," which was Abraham's age.
\[4\] That the number a "hundred" signifies what is full, is evident
from other passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: There shall be no more
thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled His days;
for the child shall die a son of a hundred years, and the sinner a son
of a hundred years shall be accursed (Isa. 65:20); where a "hundred"
manifestly denotes what is full; for it is said, there shall be no more
an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days, and a
child and a sinner of a hundred years; that is, when his state is full.
\[5\] In Matthew: Everyone that hath left houses, or brethren, or
sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My
name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life
(Matt. 19:29; Mark 10:29-30); where a "hundredfold" denotes what is
full; or "good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over"
(Luke 6:38). \[6\] And in Luke: And other seed fell upon the good earth
and having sprung up it brought forth fruit a hundredfold (Luke 8:8;
Matt. 13:8, 23; Mark 4:20); where also a "hundred" denotes what is full,
which number would not have been mentioned unless it had signified that.
The same is true where the Lord speaks by parable concerning the
debtors, that one owed "a hundred baths of oil," and the other "a
hundred cors of wheat" (Luke 16:5-7). So also in other places where a
"hundred" is mentioned. The case is similar with a "thousand,"
respecting which number, see above (n. 2575).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2637.">2637.</span></span>

When Isaac his son was born unto him. That this signifies when the
Lord's rational was made Divine, is evident from the signification of
"being born," which is to come forth \[existere\] (see n. 2584, 2621,
2629) and from the representation of "Isaac," as being the Divine
rational (see n. 2630). This is said to be "born to Abraham," when made
Divine; as also above, verse 3: "Abraham called the name of his son that
was born unto him" (see n. 2628).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2638.">2638.</span></span>

Verses 6, 7. And Sarah said, God hath made laughter for me; everyone
that heareth will laugh with me. And she said, Who would have said unto
Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons? For I have borne a son to his old age.
"Sarah said" signifies perception from the Divine spiritual; "God hath
made laughter for me," signifies the affection of celestial truth;
"everyone that heareth will laugh with me," signifies that all things in
it will have this affection; "and she said," signifies thought; "who
would have said unto Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons?" signifies that
the Lord implanted the Human in the Divine by His own power; "for I have
borne a son to his old age," signifies that this was done when the days
were fulfilled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2639.">2639.</span></span>

Sarah said. That this signifies perception from the Divine spiritual, is
evident from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive (as has
been often shown); and from the representation of Sarah, as being the
Divine spiritual, or Divine truth (see n. 2622).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2640.">2640.</span></span>

God hath made laughter for me. That this signifies the affection of
celestial truth, is evident from the signification of "laughter," as
being the affection of truth (see n. 2072, 2216); and from the
expression "God making," as denoting the celestial from which it is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2641.">2641.</span></span>

Everyone that heareth will laugh with me. That this signifies that all
things in it will have this affection, is evident from the signification
of "hearing" and "laughing." In the Word to "hear" is predicated of what
is of affection, but to "see" of what is of thought; which is evident
from a great many passages in the Word, as also from the correspondences
(see n. 2542). As the affection of celestial truth is here treated of,
it is said, "Everyone that heareth," by which are signified all things
that are of affection. (That to "laugh" denotes to be affected by truth,
that is, to have the affection of truth, see above, n. 2072, 2216,
2640.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="2642.">2642.</span></span>

And she said. That this signifies thought, is evident from the
signification of "saying," as being to perceive, and also to think (as
explained very often, see n. 2619 at the end).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2643.">2643.</span></span>

Who would have said unto Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons? That this
signifies that the Lord implanted the Human in the Divine by His own
power, is evident from the representation of Abraham, and also of Sarah,
and from the signification of "suckling" and of "sons." That Abraham
represents Divine good, and Sarah Divine truth, has been shown before.
That "milk" denotes what is spiritual from a celestial origin, or truth
from good, may be seen above (n. 2184); and thus to "suckle" is to
implant it. That "sons" are truths, here those that are in the rational,
is evident from the signification of "sons" (n. 489, 490, 491, 533).
That these things signify in the internal sense that the Lord implanted
the Human in the Divine by His own power, is because the Divine truth is
the same as the Divine Human; and when it is said of this that it
"suckles sons to Abraham," the signification is that it has implanted
the Human in the Divine; and as it was the Human, He did it from His own
power. But these things can with difficulty be explained more clearly to
the understanding. If many words be used, the sense will become still
more obscure; for these are Divine things, which can only be presented
before angels by things celestial and spiritual; and if they were
presented before man in any more elevated style, they would fall into
the material and corporeal ideas which man has. \[2\] It is further to
be known that the Lord's Divine rational is described as to its quality
when it was first born in the words, "God hath made laughter for me;
everyone that heareth will laugh with me; and she said, Who would have
said unto Abraham, Sarah shall suckle sons?" For it was according to
ancient custom, that when a child was born, a name was given
significative of the state; and that the state also was then described;
as when Cain was born to Eve and Adam (Gen. 4:1); when Sheth was born to
them (Gen. 4:25); when Noah was born to Lamech (Gen. 5:29); when Esau
and Jacob were born to Isaac (Gen. 25:25-26); when the twelve sons were
born to Jacob (Gen. 29:32-35; 30:6, 8, 11, 13, 18, 20, 24; 35:18); when
Perez and Zerah were born to Tamar (Gen. 38:29-30); when Manasseh and
Ephraim were born to Joseph (Gen. 41:51, 52); when Gershom and Eliezer
were born to Moses (Exod. 2:22; 18:4). What all these represent, and
what they signify in the internal sense, was involved in the
descriptions added to the names which were given; thus here what Isaac
represents. What is involved is manifest in some degree from this brief
explication, but deeper arcana yet are hidden within; for they are
Divine things, which can be expressed by no forms or formulas of
expression.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2644.">2644.</span></span>

For I have borne a son to his old age. That this signifies that this was
done when the days were fulfilled, is evident from the explication of
nearly the same words in the second verse (as to which see n.
2621-2624).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2645.">2645.</span></span>

Verse 8. And the child grew, and was weaned; and Abraham made a great
feast on the day when he weaned Isaac. "The child grew," signifies the
further perfecting of the Lord's rational; "and was weaned," signifies
the separation of the merely human rational; "Abraham made a great
feast," signifies dwelling together and union; "on the day when he
weaned Isaac," signifies the state of separation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2646.">2646.</span></span>

The child grew. That this signifies the further perfecting of the Lord's
rational, is evident from the signification of "growing," as being to be
perfected; and from the signification of the "child" or "son," as being
the Lord's Divine rational (see n. 2623).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2647.">2647.</span></span>

And was weaned. That this signifies the separation of the merely human
rational, is evident from the signification of "being weaned," as being
to be separated, like infants from their mothers' breasts. That the
merely human rational was separated, is further described in this
chapter, and is represented by Hagar's son, in his being cast out of the
house.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2648.">2648.</span></span>

Abraham made a great feast. That this signifies dwelling together and
union, is evident from the signification of a "feast," as being a
dwelling together (see n. 2341); here union also, because the Lord is
treated of, whose Human was united to His Divine, and the Divine to the
Human; and because this union is treated of, it is said a "great feast."

<span class="margnote"><span id="2649.">2649.</span></span>

On the day when he weaned Isaac. That this signifies the state of
separation, is evident from the signification of "day," as being state
(see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893); and from the signification of "being
weaned," as being to be separated (see n. 2647). From the first verse of
this chapter the uniting of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human
Essence has been treated of, in this order: The presence of the Divine
in the Human for the sake of unition (verse 1). The presence of the
Human in the Divine, and thus a reciprocal unition (see n. 2004) (verse
2). From this unition the Human was made Divine (verse 3). And this
successively and continually while the Lord lived in the world (verse
4). And this commenced when the rational was in a state to receive
(verse 5). The state of the unition is described as to its quality, with
its arcana (verses 6, 7). Now follows the separation of the maternal
human, and this is continued down to verse 12; which separation is
signified in this verse by the weaning of Isaac, and is represented in
the following verses by Hagar's son being sent away out of the house.
And as the union of the Lord's Divine with His Human and of His Human
with His Divine is the very marriage of good and truth, and from it is
the heavenly marriage, which is the same as the Lord's kingdom,
therefore a great feast is mentioned which Abraham made when he weaned
Isaac, by which the beginning of marriage or the first union is
signified; which feast and weaning, but for the signification, would
never have been mentioned. \[2\] As the separation of the first human,
which the Lord had from the mother, now follows, and at length the full
removal of it, it is to be known that the Lord gradually and
continually, even to the last of His life when He was glorified,
separated from Himself and put off that which was merely human, namely,
that which He derived from the mother, until at length He was no longer
her son, but the Son of God, not only as to conception but also as to
birth, and thus was one with the Father, and was Jehovah Himself. That
He separated from Himself and put off all the human from the mother, so
that He was no longer her son, is manifest from His words in John: When
the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said unto Him, They have no wine.
Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what \[belongs\] to Me and to thee ? (John
2:3, 4). In Matthew: One said, Behold, Thy mother and Thy brethren stand
without, seeking to speak to Thee. But Jesus answering said unto him
that told Him, Who is My mother? and who are My brethren? And stretching
forth His hand toward His disciples, He said, Behold My mother, and My
brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of My Father who is in the
heavens, the same is My brother, and sister, and mother (Matt. 12:47-50;
Mark 3:2-35; Luke 8:20, 21). In Luke: A certain woman out of the
multitude lifting up her voice, said unto Him, Blessed is the womb that
bare Thee, and the breasts which Thou didst suck. But Jesus said,
Blessed are they that hear the Word of God, and keep it (Luke 11:27,
28). \[3\] Here, when the woman spoke of His mother, the Lord spoke of
those described above, namely, "Whoever shall do the will of My Father,
the same is My brother, and sister, and mother;" which is the same as
this, "Blessed are they that hear the Word of God, and keep it." In
John: Jesus seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing
by, said unto His mother, Woman, behold thy son. Then said He to the
disciple, Behold thy mother. Therefore from that hour the disciple took
her to his own home (John 19:26, 27). From these words it is manifest
that the Lord spoke to her according to her thought when she saw Him on
the cross, and even then not calling her mother, but "woman;" and that
He transferred the name of mother to those who are signified by the
disciple; on which account He said to the disciple, "Behold thy mother."
Still more manifest is this from the Lord's own words, in Matthew: Jesus
asked the Pharisees, saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is He?
They say unto Him, David's. He saith unto them, How then doth David in
the spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou
on My right hand until I make Thine enemies Thy foot stool? If David
therefore call Him Lord, how is He his Son ? And no one was able to
answer Him a word (Matt. 22:41-46 Mark 12:35-37 Luke 20:42-44). Thus He
was no longer the Son of David as to the flesh. \[4\] And further, in
regard to the separation and putting off of the maternal human those do
not comprehend this who have merely corporeal ideas respecting the
Lord's Human, and think of it as of the human of any other man; hence to
such these things are stumbling-blocks. They do not know that such as
the life is such is the man, and that the Divine Esse \[Being\] of life,
or Jehovah, was in the Lord from conception, and that a similar Esse of
life came forth in His Human by means of the union.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2650.">2650.</span></span>

Verse 9. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne
unto Abraham, mocking. "Sarah saw," signifies the Lord's insight from
the Divine spiritual; "the son of Hagar the Egyptian," signifies into
the merely human rational; "Hagar the Egyptian" is the affection of
memory-knowledges, of which as a mother that rational was born; "whom
she had borne unto Abraham," signifies that it came forth from the
Divine celestial as a father; "mocking" signifies not in agreement with
or favoring the Divine rational.
