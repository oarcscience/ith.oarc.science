### Arcana Coelestia

<span class="margnote"><span id="951.">951.</span></span>

Those who in the life of the body have thought themselves holy, are in
the lower earth before the left foot. At times they there appear to
themselves to have a shining face, which flows from their idea of their
own holiness. But the outcome with them is that they are kept in the
most intense desire to ascend into heaven, which they suppose to be on
high. This desire is increased and is turned more and more into anxiety,
which grows immensely until they acknowledge that they are not holy; and
when they are taken out of that place, they are enabled to perceive
their own stench, which is very offensive.

<span class="margnote"><span id="952.">952.</span></span>

A certain spirit supposed that he had lived holily in the world because
he was esteemed as holy by men and so merited heaven. He said that he
had led a pious life, and had spent much time in prayer, supposing it to
be sufficient for each person to look out for his own interests. He also
said that he was a sinner, and was willing to suffer even to being
trodden under foot by others, which he called Christian patience; and
that he was willing to be the least, in order that he might become the
greatest in heaven. When examined in order to see whether he had
performed or had been willing to perform anything of good, that is, any
works of charity, he said that he did not know what these were; but only
that he had lived a holy life. But because he had as his end his own
preeminence over others, whom he accounted vile in comparison with
himself, at first, because he supposed himself to be holy, he appeared
in a human form shining white down to the loins, but was turned first to
a dull blue, and then to black; and as he desired to rule over others,
and despised them in comparison with himself, he became blacker than
others. (Concerning those who desire to be greatest in heaven, see
above, n. 450, 452.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="953.">953.</span></span>

I was led through some abodes of the first heaven, from which I was
permitted to see afar off a great sea swelling with mighty waves, the
boundaries of which stretched beyond the range of vision, and I was told
that those have such phantasies, and see such a sea, with fear of being
sunk in it, who have desired to be great in the world, caring nothing
whether by right or by wrong, provided they could secure their own glory
and renown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="954.">954.</span></span>

The phantasies which have been indulged in the life of the body are
turned in the next life into others, which, however, correspond to the
first. For example, with those who have been violent and merciless on
earth, their violence and unmercifulness are turned into incredible
cruelty; and they seem to themselves to kill whatever companions they
meet, and to torture them in various ways, wherein they take what is to
them the greatest possible delight. Those who have been bloodthirsty
take delight in torturing other spirits, even to bloodshed, for they
suppose spirits to be men, not knowing otherwise. At the sight of
blood-for such is their phantasy that they as it were see blood-they are
greatly delighted. From avarice there break forth phantasies as if they
were infested with mice, and the like, according to the species of
avarice. Those who have been delighted with mere pleasures, having these
as their ultimate end, as their highest good, and as it were their
heaven, find their highest delight in staying in privies, perceiving
there what is most enjoyable. Some take delight in urinous and noisome
pools, some in miry places, and so on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="955.">955.</span></span>

Moreover there are penalties of various kinds with which in the other
life the evil are most grievously punished, and into which they run when
they return to their foul cupidities, and by which they contract shame,
terror, and horror for such things, until at last they desist from them.
The penalties are various, being in general those of laceration, of
discerption or pulling to pieces, of sufferings under veils, and many
others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="956.">956.</span></span>

Those who are tenacious of revenge and who think themselves greater than
all others, regarding them as of no account in comparison with
themselves, suffer the punishment of laceration in the following manner:
They are mangled in face and body until there is scarcely anything human
left; the face becomes like a broad round cake, the arms look like rags,
and these being stretched out, the man is whirled around on high and all
the time toward heaven, while his character is proclaimed in the
presence of all until shame penetrates him to the inmost. Thus, a
suppliant, he is compelled to beg for pardon in terms that are dictated
to him. Afterwards he is carried to a miry lake, which is near the
filthy Jerusalem, and is plunged and rolled in it till he becomes a
figure of mud; and this is done repeatedly, until such cupidity is taken
away. In this miry lake there are malicious women belonging to the
province of the bladder.

<span class="margnote"><span id="957.">957.</span></span>

Those who in the life of the body have contracted a habit of saying one
thing and thinking another, especially those who under the appearance of
friendship have longed for the possessions of others, wander about, and
wherever they come ask whether they may stay there, saying that they are
poor; and when they are received they from innate desire long for all
they see. As soon as their character is detected they are driven out and
fined; and sometimes they are miserably racked in various ways in
accordance with the nature of the deceitful simulation which they have
contracted, some being racked in the whole body, some in the feet, some
in the loins, some in the breast, some in the head, and some only in the
region of the mouth. They are knocked backward and forward in a way that
is indescribable; there are violent collisions of the parts, thus
pullings asunder, so that they believe themselves to be torn into small
bits; and resistance is induced, to increase the pain. Such punishments
of discerption take place with great variety, and at intervals are
repeated again and again, until the sufferers are penetrated with fear
and horror at false statements made with an intention to deceive. Each
punishing takes away something. The discerptors said that they are so
delighted to punish that they are not willing to desist, even should it
go on to eternity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="958.">958.</span></span>

There are troops of spirits who wander about and whom other spirits
greatly dread. They apply themselves to the lower part of the back, and
inflict torture by rapid movements to and fro which no one can prevent,
and which are attended with sound, and they direct the constrictive and
expansive movement upward in the form of a cone with its point at the
top; and whoever is introduced within this cone, especially toward the
top of it, is miserably racked in every particle of his limbs. It is
deceitful pretenders who are introduced into it and so punished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="959.">959.</span></span>

I awoke in the night from my sleep, and heard spirits about me who
desired to ambush me in my sleep, yet presently dozing I had a sad
dream. But having awaked, punishing spirits were suddenly present-at
which I wondered-and miserably punished the spirits who had ambushed me
in my sleep. They induced on them as it were bodies-visible ones-and
bodily senses, and thus tortured them by violent collisions of the parts
to and fro, with pains induced by resistance. The punishers would have
killed them if they could, so that they used the most extreme violence.
Those guilty were for the most part sirens (concerning whom see n. 831).
The punishment lasted a long time, and extended around me to many
troops, and to my astonishment all those who had ambushed me were found,
though they wanted to hide themselves. Being sirens, they tried with
many arts to elude the penalty, but could not. Now they sought to
withdraw into interior nature, now to induce the belief that they were
others, now to transfer the punishment to others by a transference of
ideas, now they counterfeited infants who would thus be tortured, now
good spirits, now angels, besides making use of many other artifices,
but all in vain. I was surprised that they should be so grievously
punished, but perceived that the crime is enormous from the necessity of
man's being able to sleep in safety, without which the human race would
perish; so that it is of necessity that there should be so great a
penalty. I perceived that the same takes place around other men whom
they attempt to assail insidiously in their sleep, although the men know
nothing about it. For one to whom it is not given to speak with spirits
and to be with them by inner sense, can hear nothing of the kind, still
less see it, when yet the same things happen with all. The Lord guards
man with most especial care during his sleep.

<span class="margnote"><span id="960.">960.</span></span>

There are certain deceitful spirits who while they lived in the body
practiced their wiles in secret, and some of them in order to deceive
have by pernicious arts feigned being as it were angels. In the other
life these learn to withdraw themselves into a finer or more interior
realm of nature \[in subtiliorem naturam\], and to snatch themselves
away from the eyes of others, and in this way they suppose themselves to
be safe from every penalty. But these, just like others, undergo the
penalty of discerption in accordance with the nature and the wickedness
of their deceit, and in addition to this they are glued together, and
when this happens the more they desire to loose themselves-that is, to
tear themselves away from one another-the more tightly they are
fastened. This penalty is attended with a more intense torture because
it answers to their more hidden deceptions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="961.">961.</span></span>

Some persons from habit, and some from contempt, make use in familiar
conversation of the things contained in Holy Scripture as an aid or
formula for joking and ridicule, thinking thus to give point thereto.
But such things of Scripture when thus thought and spoken add themselves
to their corporeal and filthy ideas, and in the other life bring upon
them much harm; for they return together with the profane things. These
persons also undergo the punishment of discerption, until they become
disused to such things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="962.">962.</span></span>

There is also a penalty of discerption in respect to the thoughts, so
that the interior thoughts fight with the exterior, which is attended
with interior torment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="963.">963.</span></span>

Among punishments a frequent one consists in the throwing over the
sufferers of a veil, and is as follows. By means of phantasies that are
impressed on them the sufferers seem to themselves to be under a veil
that is stretched out to a great distance. It is like a closely clinging
cloud that increases in density in proportion to the phantasy, and under
which, incited by the desire to burst out of it, they run hither and
thither at various rates of speed, until they are wearied out. This
usually lasts for the space of an hour, more or less, and is attended
with different degrees of torment in proportion to the degree of the
desire for extrication. The veil is for those who although they see the
truth, yet under the influence of the love of self are unwilling to
acknowledge it, and feel constant indignation that the truth should be
so. When under the veil some feel such anxiety and terror that they
despair of the possibility of their deliverance, as I was informed by
one who had himself been delivered from it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="964.">964.</span></span>

There is an additional kind of veil in which the sufferers are wrapped
up as it were in a cloth, so that they seem to themselves to be bound in
hand, in foot, and in body, and there is injected into them a burning
desire to unwrap themselves. As the sufferer has been wrapped round only
once, he supposes that he will easily be unwrapped, but when he begins
to unwrap himself the veil increases in length, and the unwrapping goes
on without end, until he despairs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="965.">965.</span></span>

These things relate to the hells and to penalties. Infernal torments are
not the stings of conscience, as some suppose, for those who are in hell
have had no conscience, and therefore cannot suffer torment of
conscience. Those who have had conscience are among the happy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="966.">966.</span></span>

It is to be observed that in the other life no one undergoes any
punishment and torture on account of his hereditary evil, but only on
account of the actual evils which he himself has committed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="967.">967.</span></span>

When the evil are being punished, angels are always present who moderate
the punishment and alleviate the pains of the sufferers, but cannot take
them away. For there is such an equilibrium of all things in the other
life that evil punishes itself, and unless it could be taken away by
means of punishment, those in whom it exists could not but be kept in
some hell to eternity, for they would otherwise infest the societies of
the good, and offer violence to the order instituted by the Lord,
wherein lies the safety of the universe.

<span class="margnote"><span id="968.">968.</span></span>

Certain spirits had brought with them from the world the idea that they
must not speak with the devil, but flee from him. But they were
instructed that it would do no harm at all to those whom the Lord
protects, even if they should be encompassed by all hell, both within
and without. This it has been given me to know by much and by marvelous
experience, so that at length I came to have no fear of even the worst
of the infernal crew, to hinder my speaking with them; and this was
granted in order that I might become acquainted with their character. To
those who have wondered that I spoke with them, I have been permitted to
say not only that this would do me no harm, but also that the devils in
the other life are such as have been men, and who when they lived in the
world passed their life in hatred, revenge, and adultery, some of them
being then preeminently esteemed; nay, that among them are some I had
known in the bodily life; and that the devil means nothing else than
such a crew of hell. And furthermore, that men, while they live in the
body, have with them at least two spirits from hell, as well as two
angels from heaven; and that these infernal spirits rule with the evil,
but with the good have been subjugated and are compelled to serve. Thus
it is false to suppose that there has been a devil from the beginning of
creation, other than such as were once men. When they heard these things
they were amazed, and confessed that they had held a totally different
opinion in regard to the devil and the diabolical crew.

<span class="margnote"><span id="969.">969.</span></span>

In so great a kingdom, where all the souls of men from the first
creation flock together, from this earth alone nearly a million coming
every week, and each person among them all having his own individual
genius and nature; and where there is a communication of all the ideas
of everyone; and where notwithstanding all this, all things both in
general and in particular must be reduced into order, and this
continually; it cannot be but that numberless things exist there which
have never entered into the idea of man. And as in relation to hell, as
well as in relation to heaven, scarcely anyone has conceived more than
one single obscure idea, it cannot be but that these things will appear
strange and wonderful, especially from the fact that men suppose spirits
to have no sense of feeling, although the truth is that they feel more
exquisitely than do men, and what is more have induced on them by evil
spirits, by artifices unknown in this world, a sense of feeling almost
like that of the body, but much more gross.

<span class="margnote"><span id="970.">970.</span></span>

The subject of Vastations will follow on at the end of this chapter.
CHAPTER 9. 1. And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. 2. And let the fear of
you and the terror of you be upon every beast of the earth, and upon
every bird of heaven; even to everything that the ground maketh to creep
forth, and to all the fishes of the sea, into your hands let them be
given. 3. Every creeping thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the
esculent herb \[olus herbae\] have I given it all to you. 4. Only the
flesh with the soul thereof, the blood thereof, shall ye not eat. 5. And
surely your blood with your souls will I require; at the hand of every
wild beast will I require it; and at the hand of man \[homo\], even at
the hand of the man \[vir\] his brother, will I require the soul of man
\[homo\]. 6. Whoso sheddeth man's blood in man, his blood shall be shed;
for in the image of God made He man. 7. And you, be ye fruitful, and
multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and be ye multiplied
therein. 8. And God said unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 9.
And I, behold, I establish My covenant with you, and with your seed
after you; 10. And with every living soul that is with you, the fowl,
the beast, and the wild animal of the earth with you; of all that go out
of the ark, even every wild animal of the earth. 11. And I will
establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off
anymore by the waters of the flood; neither shall there anymore be a
flood to destroy the earth. 12. And God said, This is the sign of the
covenant which I make between Me and you and every living soul that is
with you, for the generations of an age: 13. I have set My bow in the
cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the
earth. 14. And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the
earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, 15. And I will remember
My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living soul of all
flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
16. And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will see it, that I may
remember the eternal covenant between God and every living soul of all
flesh that is upon the earth. 17. And God said unto Noah, This is the
sign of the covenant which I have established between Me and all flesh
that is upon the earth. 18. And the sons of Noah, that went forth from
the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of
Canaan. 19. These three were the sons of Noah; and from these was the
whole earth overspread. 20. And Noah began to be a man of the ground,
and he planted a vineyard: 21. And he drank of the wine and was drunken;
and he was uncovered in the midst of his tent. 22. And Ham, the father
of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren
without. 23. And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon their
shoulders, both of them, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of
their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their
father's nakedness. 24. And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his
younger son had done unto him. 25. And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a
servant of servants shall he be to his brethren. 26. And he said,
Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
27. May God enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem;
and Canaan shall be his servant. 28. And Noah lived after the flood
three hundred and fifty years. 29. And all the days of Noah were nine
hundred and fifty years; and he died.

<span class="margnote"><span id="971.">971.</span></span>

THE CONTENTS The subject that now follows on is the state of the
regenerate man; first, concerning the dominion of the internal man, and
the submission of the external.

<span class="margnote"><span id="972.">972.</span></span>

Namely, that all things of the external man have been made subject to
and serviceable to the internal (verses 1 to 3), but that especial care
must be taken lest the man should immerse the goods and truths of faith
in cupidities, or by the goods and truths which are of the internal man
should confirm evils and falsities, which must of necessity condemn him
to death, and punish him (verses 4 and 5); and thus destroy the
spiritual man, or the image of God, with him (verse 6). That if these
things are avoided, all will go well (verse 7).

<span class="margnote"><span id="973.">973.</span></span>

It next treats of the state of man after the flood, whom the Lord had so
formed that He might be present with him by means of charity, and thus
prevent his perishing, like the last posterity of the Most Ancient
Church (verses 8 to 11).

<span class="margnote"><span id="974.">974.</span></span>

Afterwards the state of man subsequent to the flood, who is in the
capacity to receive charity, is described by the "bow in the cloud"
which he resembles (verses 12 to 17). This "bow" has regard to the man
of the church, or the regenerate man (verses 12, 13); to every man in
general (verses 14, 15); specifically, to the man who is in the capacity
of being regenerated (verse 16); and consequently not only to man within
but also to man without the church (verse 17).

<span class="margnote"><span id="975.">975.</span></span>

It treats lastly of the Ancient Church in general; by "Shem" is meant
internal worship; by "Japheth" corresponding external worship; by "Ham"
faith separated from charity; and by "Canaan" external worship separated
from internal (from verse 19 to the end). This church, through the
desire to investigate from itself the truths of faith, and by
reasonings, first lapsed into errors and perversions (verses 19 to 21).
Those who are in external worship separated from internal, deride the
doctrine of faith itself, in consequence of such errors and perversions
(verse 22); but those who are in internal worship, and in the external
worship thence derived, put a good interpretation on such things, and
excuse them (verse 23). Those who are in external worship separated from
internal, are most vile (verses 24, 25); and yet they are able to
perform vile services in the church (verses 26, 27).

<span class="margnote"><span id="976.">976.</span></span>

Lastly, the duration and state of the first Ancient Church are described
by the years of Noah's age (verses 28, 29).

<span class="margnote"><span id="977.">977.</span></span>

THE INTERNAL SENSE As the subject here treated of is the regenerate man,
a few words shall be said about what he is relatively to the
unregenerate man, for in this way both will be apprehended. With the
regenerate man there is a conscience of what is good and true, and he
does good and thinks truth from conscience; the good which he does being
the good of charity, and the truth which he thinks being the truth of
faith. The unregenerate man has no conscience, or if any, it is not a
conscience of doing good from charity, and of thinking truth from faith,
but is based on some love that regards himself or the world, wherefore
it is a spurious or false conscience. With the regenerate man there is
joy when he acts according to conscience, and anxiety when he is forced
to do or think contrary to it; but it is not so with the unregenerate,
for very many such men do not know what conscience is, much less what it
is to do anything either according or contrary to it, but only what it
is to do the things that favor their loves. This is what gives them joy,
and when they do what is contrary to their loves, this is what gives
them anxiety. With the regenerate man there is a new will and a new
understanding, and this new will and new understanding are his
conscience, that is, they are in his conscience, and through this the
Lord works the good of charity and the truth of faith. With an
unregenerate man there is not will, but instead of will there is
cupidity, and a consequent proneness to every evil; neither is there
understanding, but mere reasoning and a consequent falling away to every
falsity. With the regenerate man there is celestial and spiritual life;
but with the unregenerate man there is only corporeal and worldly life,
and his ability to think and understand what is good and true is from
the Lord's life through the remains before spoken of, and it is from
this that he has the faculty of reflecting. With the regenerate the
internal man has the dominion, the external being obedient and
submissive; but with the unregenerate the external man rules, the
internal being quiescent, as if it had no existence. The regenerate man
knows, or has a capacity of knowing on reflection, what the internal man
is, and what the external; but of these the unregenerate man is
altogether ignorant, nor can he know them even if he reflects, since he
is unacquainted with the good and truth of faith originating in charity.
Hence may be seen what is the quality of the regenerate, and what of the
unregenerate man, and that they differ from each other like summer and
winter, and light and darkness; wherefore the regenerate is a living,
but the unregenerate a dead man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="978.">978.</span></span>

What the internal man is, and what the external, is at this day known to
few, if any. It is generally supposed that they are one and the same,
and this chiefly because men believe that they do good, and think truth
from what is their own, for it is the nature of man's Own to believe
this; whereas the internal man is as distinct from the external as
heaven is from earth. Both the learned and the unlearned, when
reflecting on the subject, have no other conception respecting the
internal man than its being thought, because it is within; and of the
external man that it is the body, with its life of sense and pleasure,
because this is without. Thought, however, which is thus ascribed to the
internal man, does not belong thereto; for in the internal man there are
nothing but goods and truths which are the Lord's, and in the interior
man conscience has been implanted by the Lord; and yet the evil, and
even the worst of men, have thought, and so have those who are devoid of
conscience, which shows that man's thought does not belong to the
internal, but to the external man. That the body, with its life of sense
and pleasure, is not the external man, is evident from the fact that
spirits equally possess an external man, although they have no such body
as they had during their life in this world. But what the internal man
is, and what the external, no one can possibly know unless he knows that
there is in every man a celestial and a spiritual that correspond to the
angelic heaven, a rational that corresponds to the heaven of angelic
spirits, and an interior sensuous that corresponds to the heaven of
spirits. For there are three heavens, and as many in man, which are most
perfectly distinct from each other; and hence it is that after death the
man who has conscience is first in the heaven of spirits, afterwards is
elevated by the Lord into the heaven of angelic spirits, and lastly into
the angelic heaven, which could not possibly take place unless there
were in him as many heavens, with which and with the state of which he
has the capacity of corresponding. From this I have learned what
constitutes the internal, and what the external man. The internal man is
formed of what is celestial and spiritual; the interior or intermediate
man, of what is rational; and the external man of what is sensuous, not
belonging to the body, but derived from bodily things; and this is the
case not only with man, but also with spirits. To speak in the language
of the learned, these three, the internal, the interior, and the
external man, are like end, cause, and effect; and it is well known that
there can be no effect without a cause, and no cause without an end.
Effect, cause, and end, are as distinct from each other as are what is
exterior, what is interior, and what is inmost. Strictly speaking, the
sensuous man-or he whose thought is grounded in sensuous things-is the
external man, and the spiritual and celestial man is the internal man,
and the rational man is intermediate between the two, being that by
which the communication of the internal and the external man is
effected. I am aware that few will apprehend these statements, because
men live in external things, and think from them. Hence it is that some
regard themselves as being like the brutes, and believe that on the
death of the body they will die altogether, although they then first
begin to live. After death, those who are good, at first live a sensuous
life in the world or heaven of spirits, afterwards an interior sensuous
life in the heaven of angelic spirits, and lastly an inmost sensuous
life in the angelic heaven, this angelic life being the life of the
internal man, and concerning which scarcely anything can be said that is
comprehensible by man. The regenerate may know that there is such a life
by reflecting on the nature of the good and the true, and of spiritual
warfare, for it is the life of the Lord in man, since the Lord-through
the internal man-works the good of charity and the truth of faith in his
external man. What is thence perceived in his thought and affection is a
certain general which contains innumerable things that come from the
internal man, and which the man cannot possibly perceive until he enters
the angelic heaven. (Concerning this general and its nature, see above,
n. 545, from experience.) The things here said about the internal man,
being above the apprehension of very many, are not necessary to
salvation. It is sufficient to know that there is an internal and an
external man, and to acknowledge and believe that all good and truth are
from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="979.">979.</span></span>

These observations on the state of the regenerate man, and on the influx
of the internal man into the external, have been premised, because this
chapter treats of the regenerate man, of the dominion of the internal
man over the external, and of the submission of the external man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="980.">980.</span></span>

Verse 1. And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth. "God blessed" signifies
the presence and grace of the Lord; "Noah and his sons" signifies the
Ancient Church; "be fruitful" signifies the goods of charity; "and
multiply" signifies the truths of faith, which were now to be increased;
"replenish the earth" signifies in the external man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="981.">981.</span></span>

That "God blessed" signifies the presence and grace of the Lord, is
evident from the signification of "to bless." "To bless" in the Word, in
the external sense signifies to enrich with every earthly and corporeal
good, according to the explanation of the Word given by those who abide
in the external sense-as the ancient and modern Jews, and also
Christians, especially at the present day-wherefore they have made the
Divine blessing to consist in riches, in an abundance of all things, and
in self-glory. But in the internal sense, "to bless" is to enrich with
all spiritual and celestial good, which blessing is and never can be
given except by the Lord, and on this account it signifies His presence
and grace, which necessarily bring with them such spiritual and
celestial good. It is said presence, because the Lord is present solely
in charity, and the subject treated of here is the regenerate spiritual
man, who acts from charity. The Lord is indeed present with every man,
but in proportion as a man is distant from charity, in the same
proportion the presence of the Lord is-so to speak-more absent, that is,
the Lord is more remote. The reason why grace is mentioned, and not
mercy, is for the reason-which as I conjecture, has been hitherto
unknown-that celestial men do not speak of grace, but of mercy, while
spiritual men do not speak of mercy, but of grace. This mode of speaking
is grounded in the circumstance that those who are celestial acknowledge
the human race to be nothing but filthiness, and as being in itself
excrementitious and infernal; wherefore they implore the mercy of the
Lord, for mercy is predicated of such a condition. Those, however, who
are spiritual, although they know the human race to be of such a nature,
yet they do not acknowledge it, because they remain in their Own, which
they love, and therefore they speak with difficulty of mercy, but easily
of grace. This difference in language results from the difference in the
humiliation. In proportion as anyone loves himself, and thinks that he
can do good of himself, and thus merit salvation, the less capable is he
of imploring the Lord's mercy. The reason why some can implore grace is
that it has become a customary form of speaking, in which there is but
little of the Lord and much of self, as anyone may discover in himself
while he names the grace of the Lord.

That by "Noah and his sons" is signified the Ancient Church, has been
said and shown above, and is evident also from what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="983.">983.</span></span>

That "be fruitful" signifies the good of charity, and "multiply" the
truths of faith, which were now about to be increased, is evident from
the signification of these two expressions in the Word, where "to be
fruitful" or to produce fruit, is constantly predicated of charity, and
"to multiply" of faith, as was shown above, n. 43, 55, and in further
confirmation of which we may adduce the following passages from the
Word: Turn, O backsliding sons; I will give you shepherds according to
Mine heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and intelligence and
it shall be that ye shall be multiplied and made fruitful in the earth
(Jer. 3:14-16), where "to be multiplied" manifestly denotes growth in
knowledge and intelligence, that is, in faith, and "to be made fruitful"
denotes the goods of charity; for it there treats of the implantation of
the church, in which faith or "multiplication" comes first. Again: I
will gather the remnant of My flock out of all lands whither I have
driven them, and will bring them again to their folds, and they shall be
fruitful and multiplied (Jer. 23:3), speaking of a church already
planted, consequently to be "made fruitful" as to the goods of charity
and to be "multiplied" as to the truths of faith. So in Moses: Moreover
I will look to you, and make you to be fruitful, and I will make you to
be multiplied, and establish My covenant with you (Lev. 26:9), speaking
in the internal sense of the celestial church, wherefore "to be
fruitful" is predicated of the goods of love and charity, and "to be
multiplied" of the goods and truths of faith. In Zechariah: I will
redeem them, and they shall be multiplied as they have been multiplied
(Zech. 10:8); that "to be multiplied" is here predicated of the truths
of faith, is evident from their being to "be redeemed." In Jeremiah: The
city shall be builded upon her own heap, and out of them shall proceed
confession, and the voice of them that make merry, and I will cause them
to be multiplied, and they shall not be diminished; their sons also
shall be as aforetime (Jer. 30:18-20),speaking of the affections of
truth, and of the truths of faith; the former being denoted by
"confession, and the voice of them that make merry" and the latter by
"being multiplied;" "sons" also here denote truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="984.">984.</span></span>

That to "replenish the earth" signifies in the external man, is evident
from the signification of the "earth" as being the external man, which
has been already shown several times. In reference to the goods of
charity and the truths of faith in the regenerate man, it may be
observed that they are implanted in his conscience; and as they are
implanted by means of faith, or by the hearing of the Word, they are at
first in his memory, which belongs to the external man. When the man has
been regenerated, and the internal man acts, the same takes place with
respect to fructification and multiplication, the goods of charity
putting themselves forth in the affections of the external man, and the
truths of faith in his memory, increasing and multiplying in each case.
The nature of this multiplication may be known to every regenerate
person, for things that confirm constantly accrue, from the Word, from
the rational man, and from knowledges \[scientifica\], by which he
becomes more and more confirmed, this being an effect of charity, the
Lord alone doing the work through charity.

Verse 2. And let the fear of you and the terror of you be upon every
beast of the earth, and upon every bird of heaven even to everything
which the ground causeth to creep forth, and to all the fishes of the
sea; into your hands let them be given. "The fear of you and the terror
of you" signifies the dominion of the internal man; "fear" having
reference to evils; and "terror" to falsities; "upon every beast of the
earth" signifies upon the cupidities which are of the mind \[animus\]
"and upon every bird of heaven" signifies upon the falsities which
belong to reasoning; "to everything which the ground causeth to creep
forth" signifies affections of good; "to all the fishes of the sea"
signifies memory-knowledges \[scientifica\] "let ahem be given into your
hands" signifies the possession of the internal man in the external.

<span class="margnote"><span id="986.">986.</span></span>

The fear of you and the terror of you. That this signifies the dominion
of the internal man, "fear" having reference to evils, and "terror" to
falsities, is evident from the state of the regenerate man. The state of
man before regeneration is such that cupidities and falsities, which are
of the external man, continually predominate, and hence arises a combat;
but after regeneration the internal man has dominion over the external,
that is, over its cupidities and falsities, and then the man is in fear
of evils and in terror of falsities, both of which are contrary to
conscience, and to act in opposition to this affects him with horror.
Howbeit, it is not the internal but the external man that fears evils
and dreads falsities, wherefore it is here said "let the fear of you and
the terror of you be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird
of the heaven" that is, upon all cupidities, here signified by "beasts"
and upon all falsities, here meant by the "bird of heaven." This "fear"
and this "terror" appear as if they were the man's own, but they arise
from the following cause. As has been previously stated, there are with
every man at least two angels, through whom he has communication with
heaven, and two evil spirits, through whom he has communication with
hell. When the angels rule-as is the case with the regenerate man-then
the attendant evil spirits dare not attempt to do anything contrary to
what is good and true, because they are in bonds; for, on their
attempting to do anything evil, or to speak what is false-that is, to
excite it-they are instantly seized with a kind of infernal fear and
terror. This fear and terror are what are perceived in the man as a fear
and terror for what is contrary to conscience; and therefore as soon as
he does or speaks anything contrary to conscience, he comes into
temptation, and into the pangs of conscience, that is, into a kind of
infernal torment. As to "fear" being predicated of evils, and "terror"
of falsities, the case is this: the spirits with a man do not so much
fear to do evils as they do to speak falsities, because man is born
again and receives conscience through the truths of faith, and therefore
the spirits are not allowed to excite false things. With everyone of
them there is nothing but evil, so that they are in evil; their very
nature, and all their effort therefrom is evil; and since they are in
evil, and their proper life consists in evil, they are pardoned for
doing evil when they are serving any use. But it is not permitted them
to speak anything false, and this in order that they may learn what is
true, and thus so far as possible be amended, so that they may serve
some low use; but concerning this subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy,
more hereafter. Similar is the case with the regenerate man, for his
conscience is formed of the truths of faith, and therefore his
conscience is a conscience of what is right, what is false being to him
the very evil of life, because it is contrary to the truth of faith. It
was otherwise with the man of the Most Ancient Church, who had
perception. He perceived evil of life as evil, and falsity of faith as
falsity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="987.">987.</span></span>

Upon every beast of the earth. That this signifies over the cupidities
of the lower mind, is evident from the signification of "beasts" in the
Word, where they signify either affections or cupidities, affections of
good being signified by gentle, useful, and clean beasts; and affections
of evil, or cupidities, by those that are fierce, useless, and unclean
(concerning which see above, n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 776). Here, as
cupidities are signified, they are called "beasts of the earth" not
beasts of the field. With regard to the rule of the regenerate man over
cupidities, it is to be known that those are in the greatest error, and
are by no means the regenerate, who believe that they can of themselves
rule over evils. For man is nothing but evil; he is a mass of evils; all
his will being merely evil; which is what is said in the preceding
chapter (8:21): that "the imagination of man's heart is evil from his
youth." It has been shown me by living experience that a man and a
spirit, even an angel, in himself regarded, that is, as to all that is
his own, is but vilest excrement; and that left to himself he breathes
nothing but hatred, revenge, cruelty, and most foul adultery. \[2\]
These things are his own; these are his will; as must also be evident to
everyone if he reflects, merely from this, that man when born is, among
all wild animals and beasts, the vilest creature living. And when he
grows up and becomes his own master, if not hindered by outward bonds of
the law, and bonds which he imposes on himself for the purpose of
gaining great honor and wealth, he would rush into every crime, and not
rest until he had subjugated all in the universe, and raked together the
wealth of all in the universe; nor would he spare any but those who
submitted to be his humble servants. Such is the nature of every man,
although those are unaware of it who are powerless and to whom such
attempts are impossible, and also those who are in the bonds above
mentioned. But let the possibility and power be given, and the bonds be
relaxed, and they would rush on to the extent of their ability. Wild
animals never show such a nature. They are born into a certain order of
their nature. Those which are fierce and rapacious inflict injury on
other creatures, but only in self-defense; and their devouring other
animals is to allay their hunger, and when this is allayed they do harm
to none. But it is altogether different with man. From all this it is
evident what is the nature of man's Own and will. \[3\] Since man is
such mere evil and excrement, it is evident that he can never of himself
rule over evil. It is an utter contradiction for evil to be able to rule
over evil, and not only over evil, but also over hell; for every man is
in communication through evil spirits with hell, and thereby the evil in
him is excited. From all this everyone may know, and he who has a sound
mind may conclude, that the Lord alone rules over evil in man and over
hell with him. In order that the evil in man may be subjugated, that is,
hell, which strives every moment to rush in upon him and destroy him
forever, man is regenerated by the Lord and endowed with a new will,
which is conscience, through which the Lord alone performs all good.
These are points of faith: that man is nothing but evil; and that all
good is from the Lord. They are therefore not only known by man, but
also acknowledged and believed; and if he does not so acknowledge and
believe in the life of the body, it is shown him to the life in the life
to come.

<span class="margnote"><span id="988.">988.</span></span>

And upon every bird of heaven. That this signifies upon falsities of
reasoning, is evident from the signification of "bird." In the Word
"birds" signify intellectual things: those which are gentle, useful, and
beautiful, signifying intellectual truths; and those which are fierce,
useless, and ugly, signifying intellectual falsities, or falsities of
reasoning. (That they signify intellectual things may be seen above, n.
40, 776, 870.) From this it is also evident that "birds" signify
reasonings and their falsities. That there may be no doubt let the
following passages (in addition to those cited about the raven, n. 866)
serve for confirmation. In Jeremiah: I will visit upon them in four
kinds, saith Jehovah; the sword to slay, and the dogs to drag, and the
fowl of heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy
(Jer. 15:3). In Ezekiel: Upon his ruin all the fowls of the heaven shall
dwell, and all the wild animals of the field shall be upon his branches
(Ezek. 31:13). In Daniel: At last upon the bird of abominations shall be
desolation (Dan. 9:27). In John: Babylon is become a hold of every
unclean and hateful bird (Rev. 18:2).Many times it is said in the
Prophets that carcasses should be given for meat to the fowl of the air
and to the beast of the field (Jer. 7:33; 19:7; 34:20; Ezek. 29:5; 39:4;
Ps. 79:2; Isa. 18:6). By this was signified that they should be
destroyed by falsities, which are "birds of heaven" and by evils, or
cupidities, which are the "beasts of the earth."

<span class="margnote"><span id="989.">989.</span></span>

As regards dominion over falsities, it is the same as with dominion over
evils: man cannot of himself have the least dominion over them. Since
the subject here is the dominion of the regenerated man over cupidities,
or the "beast of the earth" and over falsities, or the "bird of heaven"
it is to be known that no one can ever say that he is regenerate unless
he acknowledges and believes that charity is the primary thing of his
faith, and unless he is affected with love toward the neighbor, and has
mercy on him. Of charity his new will is formed. Through charity the
Lord brings about good, and thereby truth, but not through faith without
charity. There are some who perform works of charity from obedience
alone, that is, because it is so commanded by the Lord, and yet are not
regenerate. These if they do not place righteousness in their works are
regenerated in the other life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="990.">990.</span></span>

Even to everything that the ground maketh to creep forth. That this
signifies affections of good is evident both from what precedes and from
the signification of the "ground" from which they are produced or creep
forth; from what precedes, since there evils and falsities are treated
of, over which the regenerate man rules, and therefore here affections
of good, which are given into his hands; and from the signification of
the "ground" from which they are produced or creep forth, since the
"ground" is in general the man of the church and whatever is of the
church, and thus here whatever is produced by the Lord through the
internal man in the external. The ground itself is in the external man,
in his affections and memory. It appears as if man produced what is
good, and therefore it is said "everything that the ground maketh to
creep forth;" but this is only the appearance; good is produced through
the internal man by the Lord, since, as has been said, there is nothing
of good and truth except from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="991.">991.</span></span>

And to all the fishes of the sea. That this signifies memory-knowledges
\[scientifica\], is evident from the signification of a fish. "Fishes"
in the Word signify memory-knowledges, which spring from things of
sense. For memory-knowledges \[scientifica\] are of three kinds:
intellectual, rational, and sensuous. All these are planted in the
memory, or rather memories, and in the regenerate man are called forth
thence by the Lord, through the internal man. These memory-knowledges
which are from things of sense come to man's sensation or perception
when he lives in the body, for he thinks from them. The rest, which are
interior, do not come so much to perception until man puts off the body
and enters the other life. That "fishes" or the creeping things which
the waters produce, signify memory-knowledges, may be seen above (n.
40); and that a "whale" or "sea monster" signifies the generals of these
knowledges (n. 42). Moreover the same is evident from the following
passages in the Word. In Zephaniah: I will make man and beast to fail; I
will make the fowls of the heavens and the fishes of the sea to fail
(Zeph. 1:3), where the "fowls of the heavens" denote things of reason,
and the "fishes of the sea" lower rational things, that is, man's
thought from sensuous memory-knowledges. \[2\] In Habakkuk: Thou makest
man as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping thing that has no ruler
over them (Hab. 1:14), where "making man as the fishes of the sea" means
that he is altogether sensuous. In Hosea: Therefore shall the land
mourn, and everyone that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the wild
animal of the field and the fowl of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the
sea also shall be gathered (Hos. 4:3), where the "fishes of the sea"
denote memory-knowledges from things of sense. In David: Thou hast put
all things under his feet; all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of
the field, the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever
passeth through the paths of the seas (Ps. 8:6-8), speaking of the
dominion of the Lord in man, the "fish of the sea" denote
memory-knowledges. That "seas" signify the gathering together of
knowledges \[scientificorum seu cognitionum\], may be seen above (n.
28). In Isaiah: The fishers shall lament, and all they that cast a hook
into the river shall mourn, and they that spread a net upon the faces of
the waters shall languish (Isa. 19:8); "fishers" denoting those who
trust only in things of sense, and out of these hatch falsities; the
subject being Egypt, or the realm of memory-knowledge.

<span class="margnote"><span id="992.">992.</span></span>

Into your hands let them be given. That this signifies the possession of
the internal man in the external, is evident from what has been already
said, and from the signification of "hand" (as above, n. 878). It is
said "into your hands let them be given" because such is the appearance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="993.">993.</span></span>

Verse 3. Every creeping thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the
esculent herb have I given it all to you. "Every creeping thing that
liveth" signifies all pleasures in which there is good which is living;
"shall be food for you" signifies their delight, which they enjoy; "as
the esculent herb" signifies what is vile of delights; "have I given it
all to you" signifies enjoyment on account of use.

<span class="margnote"><span id="994.">994.</span></span>

Every creeping thing that liveth. That this signifies all pleasures in
which there is good which is living, is evident from the signification
of a "creeping thing" as shown before. That creeping things here mean
all clean beasts and birds, is evident to everyone, for it is said that
they are given for food. Creeping things in their proper sense are such
as are vilest of all (as named in Lev. 11:23, 29, 30), and were unclean.
But in a broad sense, as here, animals are meant which are given for
food; yet here they are called "creeping things" because they signify
pleasures. Man's affections are signified in the Word by clean beasts,
as already said; but since his affections are perceived only in his
pleasures, so that he calls them pleasures, they are here called
"creeping things." \[2\] Pleasures are of two kinds, those of the will,
and those of the understanding. In general there are the pleasures of
possession of land and wealth, the pleasures of honor and office in the
state, the pleasures of conjugial love and of love for infants and
children, the pleasures of friendship and of converse with companions,
the pleasures of reading, of writing, of knowing, of being wise; and
many others. There are also the pleasures of the senses: as the pleasure
of hearing, which is in general that from the sweetness of music and
song; and that of seeing, which is in general that of various and
manifold beauties; and of smelling, which is from the sweetness of
odors; and of tasting, which is from the agreeableness and wholesomeness
of foods and drinks; and of touch, from many pleasing sensations. These
kinds of pleasures, being felt in the body, are called pleasures of the
body. But no pleasure ever exists in the body unless it exists and
subsists from an interior affection, and no interior affection exists
except from one more interior, in which is the use and the end. \[3\]
These things which, in regular order, are interior, commencing from
those which are inmost, are not perceived by man while he lives in the
body, and most men hardly know that they exist, still less that they are
the source of pleasures; when yet nothing can ever exist in externals
except from things interior in order. Pleasures are only ultimate
effects. The interior things do not lie open to view so long as men live
in the body, except to those who reflect upon them. In the other life
they for the first time come forth to view, and indeed in the order in
which they are elevated by the Lord toward heaven. Interior affections
with their delights manifest themselves in the world of spirits, the
more interior with their delights in the heaven of angelic spirits, and
the still more interior with their happiness in the heaven of angels;
for there are three heavens, one more interior, more perfect, and more
happy than another (see n. 459, 684). These interiors unfold and present
themselves to perception in the other life; but so long as man lives in
the body, since he is all the time in the idea and thought of corporeal
things, these interior things are as it were asleep, being immersed in
the corporeal things. But yet it may be evident to anyone who reflects,
that all pleasures are such as are the affections that are more and more
interior in order, and that they receive from these all their essence
and quality. \[4\] Since the affections that are more and more interior
in order are felt in the extremes or outermost things, that is, in the
body, as pleasures, they are called "creeping things" but they are only
corporeal things affected by internal ones, as must be evident to
everyone merely from sight and its pleasures. Except there be interior
sight, no eye can ever see. The sight of the eye exists from interior
sight, and for this reason after the death of the body man sees equally
as well and even better than when he lived in the body-not indeed
worldly and corporeal things, but those of the other life. Those who
were blind in the life of the body, see in the other life as well as
those who had keen vision. So too when man sleeps, he sees in his dreams
as clearly as when awake. It has been given me to see by internal sight
the things in the other life more clearly than I see the things in the
world. From all this it is evident that external sight comes forth from
interior sight, and this from sight still more interior, and so on. It
is similar with every other sense and with every pleasure. \[5\]
Pleasures are likewise in other parts of the Word called "creeping
things" with a distinction between the clean and the unclean, that is,
between pleasures the delights of which are living, or heavenly, and
pleasures the delights of which are dead or infernal. As in Hosea: In
that day will I make a covenant for them with the wild animal of the
field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of
the ground (Hos. 2:18). That here the wild animal of the field, the fowl
of the heavens, and the creeping thing, signify such things in man as
have been said, is evident from the subject being a new church. In
David: Let the heavens and the earth praise Jehovah, the seas, and
everything that creepeth therein (Ps. 69:34). The seas and the things
that creep therein cannot praise Jehovah, but the things in man that are
signified by them and are living, thus from what is living within them.
Again: Praise Jehovah ye wild animal and every beast, creeping thing and
winged fowl (Ps. 148:10), with a similar meaning. \[6\] That here by
"creeping thing" nothing else is meant than good affections from which
are pleasures, is evident also from creeping things being with this
people unclean, as will be plain from what follows. Again: O Jehovah the
earth is full of Thy riches; this sea, great and wide, wherein are
things creeping without number; these wait all upon Thee, that Thou
mayest give them their food in due season; Thou givest them, they
gather; Thou openest Thy hand, they are satiated with good (Ps.
104:24-28). Here in the internal sense by "seas" are signified spiritual
things, by "things creeping" all things that live therefrom; the
enjoyment is signified by giving them food in due season, and by their
being satiated with good. In Ezekiel: And it shall come to pass that
every living soul that creepeth, in every place whither the rivers come,
shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because
these waters are come thither, and they shall be healed, and everything
shall live whithersoever the river cometh (Ezek. 47:9). Here are meant
the waters of the New Jerusalem; these waters denote spiritual things
from a celestial origin; "the living soul that creepeth" the affections
of good, and the pleasures therefrom, both of the body and of the
senses; that these live from the "waters" or from spiritual things from
a celestial origin, is very evident. \[7\] That filthy pleasures too,
which have their origin in what is man's own, thus in the foul
cupidities thereof, are also called "creeping things" is evident in
Ezekiel: So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping thing
and of beast, the abomination, and all the idols of the house of Israel,
portrayed upon the wall round about (Ezek. 8:10). Here the "form of
creeping thing" signifies unclean pleasures whose interiors are
cupidities, and the interiors of these, hatreds, revenges, cruelties,
and adulteries; such are the "creeping things" or delights of pleasures
from the love of self and of the world, or from man's Own, which are
their "idols" because they regard them as delightful, love them, have
them for gods, and thus adore them. In the representative church, these
creeping things, because they had such a vile signification, were
likewise so unclean that it was not permitted even to touch them; and he
who but touched them was unclean (as may be seen in Lev. 5:2; 11:31-33;
22:5-6).

<span class="margnote"><span id="995.">995.</span></span>

Shall be food for you. That this signifies its delight which they should
enjoy, is evident from this, that any pleasure not only affects man, but
also sustains him, like food. Pleasure without delight is not pleasure,
but is something without life, and only from delight is and is called
pleasure. Such also as is the delight, such is the pleasure. Corporeal
and sensuous things are in themselves only material, lifeless, and dead;
but from delights which come in order from the interiors, they have
life. From this it is evident that such as is the life of the interiors,
such is the delight in the pleasures, for in the delight there is life.
The delight in which there is good from the Lord is alone living, for it
is then from the very life of good; for which reason it is here said,
"every creeping thing that liveth shall be food for you" that is, for
enjoyment. \[2\] Some think that no one ought ever to live in the
pleasures of the body and its senses who wishes to be happy in the other
life, but that all these should be renounced on the ground that they are
corporeal and worldly, withdrawing man and keeping him away from
spiritual and heavenly life. But those who think so and therefore reduce
themselves to voluntary misery while they live in the world, are not
well-informed as to what the real case is. No one is forbidden to enjoy
the pleasures of the body and its senses, that is, the pleasures of
possession of lands and wealth; the pleasures of honor and office in the
state; the pleasures of conjugial love and of love for infants and
children; the pleasures of friendship and of interaction with
companions; the pleasures of hearing, or of the sweetness of singing and
music; the pleasures of sight, or of beauties, which are manifold, as
those of becoming dress, of elegant dwellings with their furniture,
beautiful gardens, and the like, which are delightful from harmony of
form and color; the pleasures of smell, or of fragrant odors; the
pleasures of taste, or of the flavors and benefits of food and drink;
the pleasures of touch. For these are most external or bodily affections
arising from interior affections, as already said. \[3\] Interior
affections, which are living, all derive their delight from good and
truth; and good and truth derive their delight from charity and faith,
and in this case do so from the Lord, thus from life itself; wherefore
the affections and pleasures therefrom are living. And since genuine
pleasures have this origin, they are denied to no one. Indeed, when they
are from this origin their delight indefinitely surpasses delight not
from this source, which is in comparison unclean. For example, the
pleasure of conjugial love, when it has its origin from true conjugial
love, surpasses immeasurably pleasure that has not this origin, so much
so that those who are in true conjugial love are in heavenly delight and
happiness, since it comes down from heaven. This was acknowledged by the
men of the Most Ancient Church. The delight from adulteries felt by
adulterers was to those men so abominable that when they thought of it
they shuddered. From all this it is evident what is the nature of the
delight that does not flow from the true fountain of life, or from the
Lord. \[4\] That the pleasures above mentioned are never denied to man,
and that so far from being denied they are then first really pleasures
when they come from their true origin, may also be seen from the fact
that very many who have lived in power, dignity, and opulence in the
world, and who had all pleasures in abundance, both of the body and of
the senses, are among the blessed and happy in heaven, and with them now
the interior delights and happinesses are living, because they have had
their origin in the goods of charity and the truths that are of faith in
the Lord. And since they had regarded all their pleasures as coming from
charity and faith in the Lord, they regarded them from use, which was
their end. Use itself was the most delightful thing to them, and from
this came the delight of their pleasures. (See what has been related
from experience, n. 945.)

That the "esculent herb" signifies the vile things of delights is
evident from what has been said. They are called the esculent herb
because they are only worldly and corporeal, or external. For, as
already said, the pleasures that are in the bodily or outermost things
of man have their origin in delights that are successively more and more
interior. The delights that are perceived in those outermost or bodily
things are relatively vile, for it is the nature of all delight to
become more vile in proportion as it progresses toward the externals,
and more happy in proportion as it advances toward the internals. For
this reason, as before said, in proportion as the externals are stripped
off, or rolled away, the delights become more pleasant and happy, as may
be evident enough from man's delight in pleasures being vile while he
lives in the body, in comparison with his delight after the life of the
body, when he comes into the world of spirits; so vile indeed that good
spirits utterly spurn the delights of the body, nor would they return to
them if all in the whole world should be given them. \[2\] The delight
of these spirits in like manner becomes vile when they are taken up by
the Lord into the heaven of angelic spirits; for they then throw off
these interior delights and enter into those that are still more
interior. So again to angelic spirits the delight which they have had in
their heaven becomes vile when they are taken up by the Lord into the
angelic or third heaven, in which heaven, since internal things are
there living, and there is nothing but mutual love, the happiness is
unspeakable. (See what is said of interior delight or happiness above,
n. 545.) From these things it is evident what is signified by "as the
esculent herb have I given it all to you." Inasmuch as creeping things
signify both pleasures of the body and pleasures of the senses, of which
the esculent herb is predicated, the word in the original language is
one which signifies both "esculent" and "green"-"esculent" in reference
to pleasures of the will, or of celestial affections, and "green" in
reference to pleasures of the understanding, or of spiritual affections.
\[3\] That the "esculent herb" and "green herb" signify what is vile, is
evident in the Word, as in Isaiah: The waters of Nimrim shall be
desolate; for the grass is dried up, the herbage is consumed, there is
no green thing (Isa. 15:6). Their inhabitants were short of hand, they
were dismayed, and put to shame; they became the herb of the field, and
the green herbage, the grass on the house tops (Isa. 37:27), the "green
herbage" denoting what is most vile. In Moses: The land whither thou
goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came
out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a
garden of herbs (Deut. 11:10), where a "garden of herbs" denotes what is
vile. In David: The evil are as grass, suddenly are they cut down, and
will be consumed as the green herbage (Ps. 37:2), where "grass" and the
"green herbage" denote what is most vile.

Have I given it all to you. That this signifies enjoyment on account of
use, is because it is "for food"; for whatever is given for food is for
use. With regard to use: those who are in charity, that is, in love to
the neighbor (from which is the delight in pleasures that is alive), pay
no regard to the enjoyment of pleasures except on account of the use.
For there is no charity apart from works of charity; it is in its
practice or use that charity consists. He who loves the neighbor as
himself perceives no delight in charity except in its exercise, or in
use; and therefore a life of charity is a life of uses. Such is the life
of the whole heaven; for the kingdom of the Lord, because it is a
kingdom of mutual love, is a kingdom of uses. Every pleasure therefore
which is from charity, has its delight from use. The more noble the use,
the greater the delight. Consequently the angels have happiness from the
Lord according to the essence and quality of their use. \[2\] And so it
is with every pleasure-the more noble its use, the greater its delight.
For example, the delight of conjugial love: because this love is the
seminary of human society, and thereby of the Lord's kingdom in the
heavens, which is the greatest of all uses, it has in it so much delight
that it is the very happiness of heaven. It is the same with all other
pleasures, but with a difference according to the excellence of the
uses, which are so manifold that they can scarcely be classed in genera
and species, some having regard more nearly and directly, and some more
remotely and indirectly, to the kingdom of the Lord, or to the Lord.
From these things it is further evident that all pleasures are granted
to man, but only for the sake of use; and that they thus, with a
difference from the use in which they are, partake of heavenly happiness
and live from it.

Verse 4. Only the flesh with the soul thereof, the blood thereof, shall
ye not eat. "Flesh" signifies the will part of man; the "soul" signifies
the new life; the "blood" signifies charity; "not to eat" signifies not
to mingle together; wherefore by "not eating flesh with the soul
thereof, the blood thereof" is meant not mingling profane things with
holy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="999.">999.</span></span>

That "flesh" signifies the will part of man, is evident from the
signification of "flesh" in its proper sense in reference to man when
corrupt. "Flesh" in general, signifies the whole man, and specifically
the corporeal man, as may be seen above (n. 574); and since it signifies
the whole man, and specifically the corporeal man, it signifies what is
proper to man, consequently his will part. Man's will part, or will, is
nothing but evil; and therefore "flesh" predicated of man, because he is
such, signifies all cupidity, or all concupiscence, for man's will is
nothing but cupidity, as occasionally shown before. And because "flesh"
has this signification, such was also the representation of the flesh
which the people lusted after in the desert-as in Moses: The mixed
multitude that was among them fell a lusting whence they wept again, and
said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? (Num. 11:4). Here flesh is plainly
called lust, for it is said that they fell a lusting, saying, Who shall
give us flesh? The same is likewise evident from what follows: While the
flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of
Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people
with a very great plague; and the name of that place was called the
Graves of Lust, because there they buried the people that lusted (Num.
11:33-34). \[2\] It must be evident to everyone that such a plague would
never have been sent among the people on account of their lusting after
flesh, thus not on account of a lust for flesh, since this is natural
when a man has been kept from eating it for a long time, as the people
then had in the wilderness. But a deeper reason lies hidden, which is
spiritual, namely, that the people were of such a nature as to loathe
what was signified and represented by the manna-as is evident also from
the sixth verse-and to desire only such things as were signified and
represented by "flesh" the things of their own will, which are of those
of cupidities, and in themselves are excrementitious and profane. It was
because that church was representative, from the representation of such
things, that the people were afflicted with so great a plague; for what
was done among the people was represented spiritually in heaven. The
manna represented in heaven what is heavenly, and the flesh which they
lusted after, the unclean things of their own will. For this reason,
because they were of such a nature, they were punished. From these and
other passages in the Word, it is evident that by "flesh" is signified
what is of the will, and here of the will of man, the uncleanness of
which may be seen under the second verse of this chapter, where the
beast of the earth is treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1000.">1000.</span></span>

That the "soul" signifies life, is evident from the signification of
"soul" in the Word, in many places. "Soul" in the Word signifies in
general all life, as well internal, or that of the internal man, as
external, or that of the external man. And because it signifies all
life, it signifies such life as is that of the man of whom the soul is
predicated. Here it is predicated of the life of the regenerate man,
which is separate from man's will; for, as already said, the new life
which the regenerate spiritual man receives from the Lord is entirely
separate from the will or Own of the man, that is, from the life that is
his own, which is not life, though so called, but is death, because it
is infernal life. Here therefore "flesh with the soul thereof" which
they should not eat, signifies flesh together with its soul; that is,
they should not mingle this new life, which is of the Lord, with the
evil or excrementitious life which is of man, that is, with his will or
Own.
