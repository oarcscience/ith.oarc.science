### Apocalypse Revealed

<span class="margnote"><span id="251.">251.</span></span>

Verse 10. The four-and-twenty elders fell down before Him that sat upon
the throne and adored Him that liveth for ages of ages, signifies the
humiliation of all in heaven before the Lord. That by " the
four-and-twenty elders" are meant all who are of the Lord's church, may
be seen above (n. 233); here all who are of His church in heaven; "the
elders," as heads, represented all. That it is humiliation before the
Lord, and from humiliation adoration, is evident without explanation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="252.">252.</span></span>

And cast their crowns before the throne, signifies the acknowledgment
that their wisdom is from Him alone. That "a crown" signifies wisdom,
may be seen above (n. 189, 235); therefore by "casting their crowns
before the throne," is signified to acknowledge that wisdom is not their
own, but the Lord's with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="253.">253.</span></span>

Verse 11. Saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor,
and power, signifies the confession that the kingdom is the Lord's from
merit and justice, because He is the Divine truth and the Divine good.
Confession is signified by "saying." That it is from merit and justice
is signified by "thou art worthy, O Lord;" that He is the Divine truth
and the Divine good, is signified by "glory and honor," as above (n.
249). That His is the kingdom is signified by "receiving power": these,
therefore, collected into one sense, signify the confession that the
kingdom is the Lord's from merit and justice, because He is the Divine
truth and the Divine good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="254.">254.</span></span>

For Thou hast created all things, and by Thy will they are, and were
created, signifies that all things of heaven and the church were made
and formed, and men reformed and regenerated from the Divine love of the
Lord through His Divine wisdom, or from the Divine good through the
Divine truth, which also is the Word. This is the spiritual sense of
these words, because by "creating" is signified to reform and regenerate
by the Divine truth, and by "the will of the Lord" is signified the
Divine good. Whether you call it the Divine good and the Divine truth,
or the Divine love and the Divine wisdom, it is the same, because all
good is of love, and all truth is of wisdom. That from the Divine love
and the Divine wisdom are all things of heaven and the church, yea and
the world itself was created from them is shown in many places in The
Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom; also that love and
good is of the will, and wisdom and truth of the understanding; hence it
appears, that by "the Lord's will" is meant His Divine good or Divine
love. \[2\] That "to create," in the Word, signifies to reform and
regenerate, is plain from these passages: Create in me a clean heart, O
God, and renew a firm spirit in the midst of me (Ps. 51:10). Thou
openest Thine hand, they are filled with good; Thou sendest forth Thy
Spirit; they are created (Ps. 104:28, 30). The people which shall be
created shall praise Jah (Ps. 102:18). Behold, I create a new heaven and
a new earth, rejoice for ever in that which I create; behold I create
Jerusalem an exultation (Isa. 65:17-18). Jehovah createth the heavens,
He that stretcheth out the earth, He giveth breath unto the people upon
it, and spirit to them that walk therein (Isa. 42:5; 45:12, 18). Thus
saith Jehovah thy Creator, O Jacob, thy Former, O Israel; I have
redeemed thee, I have called thee by My name; everyone that is called by
My name, I have created him in My glory (Isa. 43:1, 7). They were
prepared in the day that thou wast created; thou was perfect in thy ways
in the day that thou was created, until perversity was found in thee
(Ezek. 28:13, 15). These things are concerning the king of Tyre, by whom
are signified they who are in intelligence by the Divine truth. That
they may see, know, consider, and understand that the hand of Jehovah
hath done this, and the Holy one of Israel hath created it (Isa. 41:20).

<span class="margnote"><span id="255.">255.</span></span>

Here I will add this Relation. Lest anyone should enter into the
spiritual sense of the Word, and pervert the genuine truth which
pertains to that sense, there are placed guards by the Lord, which are
meant by cherubim in the Word, which are the four animals here: that
guards are placed, was thus represented to me. \[2\] It was given to see
great purses, which seemed like bags, in which silver in great abundance
was stored up; and as they were open, it was perceived as though anyone
might take the silver out of them, and even carry it off. But near the
purses there sat two angels who were guards. The place where they were
deposited appeared like a manger in a stable; in the next apartment were
seen some modest virgins with a chaste wife; and near that apartment
stood two infants; and it was said, that they were not to be played with
in an infantile manner, but wisely; and afterwards there appeared a
harlot, and also a dead horse. \[3\] On seeing which I was instructed,
that by these was represented the sense of the letter of the Word, in
which is the spiritual sense. The great purses full of silver signified
the knowledges of truth and good in great abundance. Their being open,
and yet guarded by angels, signified that anyone might take from thence
the knowledges of truth, but that care is taken lest anyone should
falsify the spiritual sense, in which were nothing but truths. The
manger in the stable, in which the purses lay, signified spiritual
instruction for the understanding; this is the signification of a
manger, and the same is signified by the manger in which the Lord lay
when an infant, because a horse, which eats therefrom, signifies the
understanding of the Word. \[4\] The modest virgins, who were seen in
the adjoining apartment, signified affections of truth, and the chaste
wife, the conjunction of good and truth. The infants signified the
innocence of wisdom in the Word. They were angels from the third heaven,
who all appear like infants. The harlot with the dead horse signified
the falsification of the Word by many at this day, by which all the
understanding of truth perishes; a harlot signifies falsification, and a
dead horse no understanding of truth. \[5\] It has been granted me to
speak with many after death, who believed they should shine like stars
in heaven, because, as they said, they had held the Word as holy, had
read it frequently, and collected many things from it by which they had
confirmed the dogmas of their faith, and were therefore celebrated as
men of learning in the world, for which reason they thought they would
be Michaels or Raphaels. But many of them were explored, as to the love
from which they had studied the Word, and it was found, that some had
studied it from self-love, that they might appear great in the world,
and be reverenced as primates of the church; but others from the love of
the world, that they might gain wealth. When they were examined as to
what they knew from the Word, it was found, that they knew nothing of
genuine truth therefrom, but only such as is called truth falsified,
which in itself is falsity, and this, in the spiritual world, is a
stench to the nostrils of the angels. And it was said to them that this
was the case with them, because they themselves and the world were their
ends, or what is the same, their loves, and not the Lord and heaven; and
when themselves and the world are ends, then, when they read the Word,
their mind cleaves to self and the world, and therefore they think
constantly from their own proprium, which is in thick darkness as to all
things of heaven. In this state man cannot be withdrawn from his own
light, and so elevated into the light of heaven, nor thence receive any
influx from the Lord through heaven. \[6\] I also saw them admitted into
heaven, and when they were found to be without truths, they were
stripped of their garments and appeared in nakedness. And they who had
falsified truths, were, by reason of their stench, expelled, but still
their pride remained with them, and the belief in their own merit. It
was otherwise with those who had studied the Word from the affection of
knowing truth because it is truth, and because it subserves the uses of
spiritual life, not only to a man's self, but also to his neighbor.
These I saw taken up into heaven, and thus into the light, in which the
Divine truth is there, and at the same time they were then exalted into
angelic wisdom and its felicity, which is life eternal.

Revelation 5 1. And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat on the
throne, a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is
worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 3. And no one
in heaven, nor on earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the
book, neither to look thereon. 4. And I wept much because no one was
found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. 5.
And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion which is
of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the
book, and to loose the seven seals thereof. 6. And I saw, and, behold,
in the midst of the throne and of the four animals, and in the midst of
the elders, a Lamb standing as if slain, having seven horns and seven
eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
7. And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat
upon the throne. 8. And when He had taken the book, the four animals,
and the twenty-four elders, fell down before the Lamb, having everyone
of them harps, and golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers
of the saints. 9. And they sang a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to
take the book, and to open the seals thereof; because Thou wast slain,
and hast redeemed us to God in Thy blood, out of every tribe, and
tongue, and people, and nation. 10. And Thou hast made us unto our God
kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth. 11. And I saw, and I
heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the animals,
and the elders; and the number of them was myriads of myriads, and
thousands of thousands; 12. Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the
Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and honor,
and glory, and blessing. 13. And every created thing which is in heaven,
and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and
all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory,
and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb,
for ages of ages. 14. And the four animals said, Amen. And the
twenty-four elders fell down, and adored Him that liveth for ages of
ages. THE SPIRITUAL SENSE The contents of the whole chapter That the
Lord in the Divine Human will execute judgment from the Word and
according to it, because He Himself is the Word; and that this is
acknowledged by all in the three heavens. The contents of the whole
chapter Verse 1. "And I saw in the right hand of Him that sat on the
throne, a book written within and on the back," signifies the Lord as to
His Divine itself from eternity, who is omnipotent and omniscient, and
who is the Word (n. 256). "Sealed with seven seals," signifies that it
is altogether hidden from angel and man (n. 257). Verse 2. "And I saw a
strong angel proclaiming with a great voice," signifies the Divine truth
from the Lord inflowing interiorly with angels and men (n. 258). "Who is
worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?" signifies, Who
has power to know the states of life of all in the heavens and on the
earths, and to judge everyone according thereto? (n. 259). Verse 3. "And
no one in heaven, nor on earth neither under the earth, was able,"
signifies that no one in the higher heavens or in the lower heavens, was
able (n. 260); "to open the book," signifies to know the states of the
life of all, and to judge everyone according to his state (n. 261);
"Neither to look thereon," signifies not in the least (n. 262). Verse 4.
"And I wept much because no one was found worthy <span
id="fr_21"></span>[256-1](#fn_21.md) to open and to read the book, neither
to look thereon," signifies grief of heart, because if no one could do
it, all must perish (n. 263). Verse 5. "And one of the elders saith unto
me, Weep not," signifies consolation (n. 264); "Behold, the lion which
is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David hath prevailed," signifies
the Lord, who by His own power subjugated the hells and reduced all
things to order when He was in the world by the Divine good united to
the Divine truth in His Human (n. 265, 266): "To open the book and to
loose the seven seals thereof," signifies here as before (n. 267). Verse
6. "And I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne, and of the four
animals, and in the midst of the elders," signifies from the inmost and
thence in all things of heaven, the Word, and the church (n. 268). "A
Lamb standing as if slain," signifies the Lord as to His Human, not
acknowledged in the church to be Divine (n. 269). "Having seven horns,"
signifies His omnipotence (n. 270). "And seven eyes" signifies His
omniscience and Divine wisdom (n. 271). "Which are the seven spirits of
God sent forth into all the earth," signifies that from the Divine
wisdom is derived the Divine truth throughout the whole world,
wheresoever there is any religion (n. 272). Verse 7. "And He came and
took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat upon the throne,"
signifies that the Lord as to His Divine Human is the Word, and this
from His Divine in Himself and that therefore He will execute judgment
from His Divine Human (n. 273). Verse 8. "And when He had taken the
book," signifies when the Lord determined to execute the judgment, and
thereby to reduce all things in the heavens and upon the earth to order
(n. 274). "The four animals and the twenty-four elders fell down before
the Lamb," signifies humiliation and adoration of the Lord from the
higher heavens (n. 275). "Having everyone of them harps" signifies
confession of the Lord's Divine Human from spiritual truths (n. 267).
"And golden vials full of incense," signifies confession of the Lord's
Divine Human from spiritual goods (n. 277). "Which are the prayers of
the saints," signifies thoughts which are of faith from affections which
are of charity with those who worship the Lord from spiritual goods and
truths (n. 278). Verse 9. "And they sang a new song," signifies the
acknowledgment and glorification of the Lord, that He alone is the
Judge, Redeemer, and Savior, thus the God of heaven and earth (n. 279).
"Saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals
thereof," signifies here as before (n. 280). "Because Thou wast slain,
and hast redeemed us to God in Thy blood," signifies deliverance from
hell and salvation by conjunction with Him (n. 281). "Out of every
tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation," signifies that they in the
church, or in any religion, who are in truths as to doctrine, and in
goods as to life are redeemed by the Lord (n. 282). Verse 10. "And hast
made us unto our God kings and priests," signifies that from the Lord
they are in wisdom from Divine truths and in love from Divine goods (n.
283). "And we shall reign on the earth," signifies, and will be in His
kingdom, He in them and they in Him (n. 284,285). Verse 11. "And I saw,
and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the
animals, and the elders," signifies confession and glorification of the
Lord by the angels of the lower heavens (n. 286). <span
id="fr_22"></span>[256-2](#fn_22.md) Verse 12. "Saying with a great voice,
Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and
wisdom, and honor, and glory," signifies confession from the heart, that
to the Lord as to His Divine Human is omnipotence, omniscience, Divine
good, and Divine truth (n. 288). "And blessing," signifies all these in
Him, and from Him in them (n. 289). Verse 13. "And every created thing
which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as
are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying," signifies
confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lowest
heavens (n. 290). "Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto
Him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ages of ages,"
signifies that in the Lord from eternity, and thence in His Divine
Human, is the All of heaven and the church, Divine good, and Divine
truth, and Divine power, and from Him in them (n. 291). Verse 14. "And
the four animals said, Amen," signifies Divine confirmation from the
Word (n. 292). "And the twenty-four elders fell down and adored Him that
liveth for ages of ages," signifies humiliation before the Lord, and
from humiliation, adoration of Him by all in the heavens, from whom and
in whom is life eternal (n. 293). THE EXPLANATION Verse 1. And I saw in
the right hand of Him that sat on the throne a book, written within and
on the back, signifies the Lord as to His Divine Itself from eternity,
who has omnipotence and omniscience, and who is the Word; who also knows
from Himself the state of the life of all in the heavens and on the
earths, in every particular and in general. By "Him that sat on the
throne" is meant the Lord as to His Divine, from which is His Human, for
it follows that "the Lamb took the book out of the right hand of Him
that sat on the throne" (verse 7), and by "the Lamb" is meant the Lord
as to the Divine Human. By "the book written within and on the back" is
meant the Word in every particular and in every general; by "within," in
every particular, and by "on the back" in every general. By "within and
on the back" is also meant the interior sense of the Word, which is
spiritual, and its exterior sense, which is natural; by "right hand" is
meant Himself as to omnipotence and omniscience, because the exploration
of all in the heavens and on the earths, upon whom the Last Judgment is
to be executed, and their separation, is treated of. The Lord, as the
Word, knows the states of life of all in the heavens and on the earths
from Himself, because He is the Divine truth itself, and the Divine
truth itself knows all things from itself; but this is an arcanum, which
is revealed in Angelic Wisdom concerning Divine Love and Wisdom. That
the Lord as to His Divine from eternity was the Word, that is, the
Divine truth, is evident from these words in John: In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word (John 1:1).
And that the Lord as to His Human also was made "the Word," in the same:
And the Word became flesh (John 1:14). Hence it may appear what it means
that the book was in the right hand of Him that sat on the throne, and
that the Lamb took the book thence (Rev. 5:7). \[2\] Since the Lord is
the Word, and the Word is the Divine truth, which in general makes
heaven and the church, and in particular each angel, that heaven may be
in Him, and man that the church may be in Him; and because the Word is
here meant by "the book," from which and according to which all are to
be judged, therefore in many places occur the expressions, "to be
written in the book," "to be judged from the book," "to be blotted out
of the book," where the state of eternal life of anyone is treated of,
as in these passages: The Ancient of days did sit in judgment, and the
books were opened (Dan. 7:10). Every people shall be delivered that
shall be found written in the book (Dan. 12:1). My bone was not hid from
Thee, in Thy book all my days were written, not one of them is wanting
(Ps. 139:15, 16). Moses said, blot me, I pray thee, out of the book
which Thou hast written. And Jehovah said, Whosoever hath sinned against
Me will I blot out of the book (Exod. 32:32, 33). Let them be blotted
out of the book of life, and not be written with the just (Ps. 69:28). I
saw that the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is
the book of life, and the dead were judged according to those things
which were written in the book according to their works, and whosoever
was not found written in the book of life, was cast into the lake of
fire (Rev. 20:12, 15). None shall enter into the New Jerusalem, but them
that are written in the Lamb's book of life (Rev. 21:27). All shall
adore the beast whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life
(Rev. 13:8; 17:8). That by "the book" is meant the Word, in David: In
the volume of the book it is written of me (Ps. 40:7). And in Ezekiel: I
saw, and behold a hand sent forth unto me, and in it the volume of a
book, written before and behind (Ezek. 2:9, 10). The book of the words
of Isaiah (Luke 3:4). The book of Psalms (Luke 20:42.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="257.">257.</span></span>

Sealed with seven seals, signifies that it is altogether hidden from
angel and man. That "to be sealed with a seal" signifies to be hidden is
evident, hence "to be sealed with seven seals" signifies to be
altogether hidden, for "seven" signifies all (n. 10), and therefore
altogether; that it was altogether hidden from angel and man, is
presently said in these words: And no one in heaven, nor on earth,
neither under the earth, was able to open and read the book, neither to
look thereon (Rev. 5:3). Such is the Word to all to whom the Lamb, that
is, the Lord, does not open it. Here, because the exploration of all
before the Last Judgment is treated of, it is the states of life of all
in general and in particular, which are altogether hidden.

<span class="margnote"><span id="258.">258.</span></span>

Verse 2. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice,
signifies the Divine truth from the Lord flowing in deeply into the
thought of angels and men, and investigation. By "an angel" proclaiming,
is meant in the spiritual sense, the Lord, because an angel does not
proclaim and teach from himself but from the Lord, but still as from
himself. It is said "a strong angel," because with power, and that which
is proclaimed with power flows in deeply into the thought. "A great
voice" signifies the Divine truth from the Lord in power or virtue. It
also signifies investigation, because he asks, "Who is worthy to open
the book?" as now follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="259.">259.</span></span>

Who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof? signifies
who has power to know the states of life of all in the heavens and on
the earth, and to judge everyone according to his state? "Who is
worthy?" signifies who is able, or who has the power? "to open the book
and to loose the seals thereof," signifies here to know the states of
life of all in the heavens and on the earth, and also to judge everyone
according to his state; for when "the book is opened," there is an
examination into their quality, and then sentence or judgment,
comparatively as a judge does with a book of the law and acts from it.
That by "opening the book," is signified investigation into the quality
of the states of life in all and everyone, is evident from the following
chapter, where is described what was seen, when the Lamb opened the
seven seals in their order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="260.">260.</span></span>

Verse 3. And no one in heaven, nor on earth, neither under the earth,
was able, signifies that no one in the higher heavens or the lower
heavens was able. "In heaven, on earth, and under the earth," mean in
the higher and in the lower heavens, in like manner as in the 13th
verse, where it is said: And every created thing which is in heaven, on
the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that
are in them, heard I saying (Rev. 5:13). Since he heard the latter and
the former saying, it is evident that they were angels and spirits who
spoke; for John was in the spirit, as he himself says in the preceding
chapter (4:2), in which state no other earth appeared to him than the
earth of the spiritual world; for there are earths there as well as in
the natural world, as may appear from the description of that world in
the work concerning Heaven and Hell; as also in The Continuation
concerning the Spiritual World (n. 32-38). The higher heavens appear
there upon mountains and hills, the lower heavens in the earth beneath,
and the ultimate heavens as it were under the earth. For the heavens are
expanses one above another, and each expanse is like the earth under the
feet of those who are there. The highest expanse is like the top of a
mountain, the next expanse is under it, but extending itself more widely
on all sides round about, and the lowest expanse more widely still; and
since this last is under the other, they who are there are "under the
earth." The three heavens also appear thus to the angels who are in the
higher heavens, because to them there appear two heavens beneath them;
therefore in like manner they appeared to John, because he was with
them, for he had ascended to them, as is evident from chap. 4:1, where
it is said: Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be
hereafter (Rev. 4:1). He who does not know anything of the spiritual
world and the earths there, can by no means know what is meant by "under
the earth," nor by "the lower parts of the earth," in the Word, as in
Isaiah: Sing, O heavens, shout, ye lower parts of the earth, resound
with singing, ye mountains, for Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob (Isa. 44:23;
and in other places). Who does not see that the earths of the spiritual
world are here meant? for no man lives under the earth in the natural
world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="261.">261.</span></span>

To open the book, signifies to know the states of life of all, and to
judge everyone according to his state, as appears from the explanation
above (n. 259).

<span class="margnote"><span id="262.">262.</span></span>

Neither to look thereon, signifies not in the least. Since by "opening
the book," is signified to know the states of life of all, by "looking
on it" is signified to see what the state of life of this or that person
is, therefore by "no one being able to open the book nor to look
thereon," is signified that they were not able in the least. For the
Lord alone sees the state of everyone from inmosts to outmosts, as also
what a man has been from infancy to old age, and what he will be to
eternity, and likewise what place will be allotted to him either in
heaven or in hell; and this the Lord sees in an instant, and from
Himself, because He is the Divine truth itself or the Word; but angels
and man do not see this in the least, because they are finite, and the
finite see only a few things, and those only external, and not these
indeed from themselves, but from the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="263.">263.</span></span>

Verse 4. And I wept much because no one was found <span
id="fr_23"></span>[263-1](#fn_23.md) to open and to read the book, neither
to look thereon, signifies grief of heart, because if no one could do
it, all must perish. That "to weep much" is to grieve at heart, is
evident; the reason why he grieved at heart, was, because otherwise all
would have perished; for if all things in the heavens and on the earth
were not reduced to order by the Last Judgment, it could not be
otherwise; for Revelation treats of the last state of the church, when
it comes to its end, the nature of which state is described by the Lord
in these words: There shall be great affliction, such as was not from
the beginning of the world to this time, nor shall be; therefore except
those days should be shortened, no flesh would be saved (Matt. 24:21,
22). These are concerning the last time of the church, when judgment
takes place. \[2\] That such is the state of the church at this day, may
be known solely from these considerations, that the greatest part of the
Christian world is occupied by those who have transferred to themselves
the Divine power of the Lord, and wish to be worshiped as gods, and who
invoke dead men, and scarce any of them the Lord; and that the rest of
the church make God three, and the Lord two, and place salvation, not in
amendment of life, but in certain words uttered with a devout tone; thus
not in repentance, but in confidence that they are justified and
sanctified, provided they do but fold their hands and look upwards, and
pray in the customary form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="264.">264.</span></span>

Verse 5. And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; that this
signifies consolation, is evident.

<span class="margnote"><span id="265.">265.</span></span>

Behold, the Lion hath prevailed, signifies the Lord, that from His own
power He had subjugated the hells, and reduced all things to order when
He was in the world. That "a lion" signifies the Divine truth of the
Word as to its power, may be seen above (n. 241); and because the Lord
is the Divine truth itself, or the Word, He is called "a Lion." That the
Lord, when He was in the world, subjugated the hells and reduced all
things in the heavens to order, and likewise glorified His Human, may be
seen above (n. 67); and how He did this, may be seen in The Doctrine of
the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 12-14). Hence it is evident,
what is meant by "the Lion hath prevailed."

<span class="margnote"><span id="266.">266.</span></span>

Which is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, signifies by the
Divine good united to the Divine truth in His Human. By "Judah," in the
Word, is meant the church which is in the good of love to the Lord, and
in the highest sense the Lord as to the Divine good of the Divine love;
and by "David" is meant the Lord as to the Divine truth of the Divine
wisdom. That this is meant by "David," may be seen in The Doctrine of
the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 43, 44); and that the former
is meant by " Judah," may be seen (n. 96, 266, 350). Hence it appears
that by "Behold the Lion which is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of
David hath prevailed," is signified that the Lord overcame the hells and
reduced all things to order by the Divine good united to the Divine
truth in His Human. That this is the sense of these words, cannot be
seen in the sense of the letter, but only that it is He Himself who was
born in the world of the tribe of Judah and of the stock of David.
Still, however, these words contain in them a spiritual sense, in which
by the names of persons are meant things, as has frequently been
observed above, thus by "Judah" is not meant Judah, nor by "David,"
David; but by "Judah," the Lord as to the Divine good, and by "David,"
the Lord as to the Divine truth. Hence it is that this sense results
therefrom. The reason why this sense is here explained is because
Revelation as to its spiritual sense is now opened.

<span class="margnote"><span id="267.">267.</span></span>

To open the book, and loose the seven seals thereof, signifies to know
the states of life of all in the heavens and on the earth, and to judge
everyone according to his state, as above (n. 258, 259).

<span class="margnote"><span id="268.">268.</span></span>

Verse 6. And I saw, and behold, in the midst of the throne, and of the
four animals, and in the midst of the elders, signifies from inmosts,
and thence in all things of heaven, the Word, and the church. "In the
midst" signifies in the inmosts, and thence in all things (n. 44); "a
throne" signifies heaven (n. 14); "the four animals" or cherubs signify
the Word (n. 239) and the "twenty-four elders" signify the church as to
all things belonging thereto (n. 233, 251). From these things it
follows, that, "in the midst of the throne, and of the four animals, and
in the midst of the elders," signifies from inmosts in all things of
heaven, the Word, and the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="269.">269.</span></span>

A Lamb standing as if slain, signifies the Lord as to His Human, not
acknowledged in the church as Divine. By "Lamb," in Revelation, is meant
the Lord as to the Divine Human, and by "a Lamb slain," that His Human
is not acknowledged in the church as Divine; in like manner as in
chapter 1:18, where it is said: I was made dead, and behold I am alive
for ages of ages (Rev. 1:18). By which is meant that the Lord is
neglected in the church, and His Human not acknowledged as Divine (n.
59); that this is the case may be seen below (n. 294). Since, therefore,
the Lord as to the Divine Human is meant by "the Lamb," and it is said
of Him, that "He took the book out of the right hand of Him that sat
upon the throne," and afterwards that "He opened it, and loosed the
seven seals thereof," and since no mortal could do this, but God alone,
it follows, that by "the Lamb" is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human,
and by "slain," that He is not acknowledged as God as to His Human.

<span class="margnote"><span id="270.">270.</span></span>

Having seven horns, signifies His omnipotence. "A horn" is frequently
mentioned in the Word, and by it is everywhere signified power;
therefore when "a horn" is predicated of the Lord, it signifies
omnipotence. The reason why "seven horns" are mentioned, is, because
"seven" signifies all (n. 10), thus omnipotence. That "a horn" signifies
power, and when applied to the Lord, omnipotence, may appear from the
following passages: They who rejoice at a thing of naught, who say, have
we not taken us horns by our own strength? (Amos 6:13). I said unto the
wicked, Lift not up the horn, lift not up your horn on high; All the
horns of the wicked I will cut off; but the horns of the just shall be
exalted (Ps. 75:4, 5, 10). Jehovah hath exalted the horn of thine
enemies (Lam. 2:17). The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken
(Jer. 48:25). Ye thrust with side and shoulder, and strike all the
feeble sheep with your horns (Ezek. 34:21). Jehovah hath exalted the
horn of his people (Ps. 148:14). Jehovah God of hosts, the glory of
our <span id="fr_24"></span>[270-1](#fn_24.md) strength, hath exalted our
horn (Ps. 89:17). The brightness of Jehovah God shall be as the light,
He had horns out of His hand, and there was the hiding of His power
(Hab. 3:4). My arm shall strengthen David, and in My name shall his horn
be exalted (Ps. 89:21, 24). Jehovah is my strength, my rock, my horn
(Ps. 18:2-3; 2 Sam. 22:3). Arise, O daughter of Zion, for I will make
thy horn iron, and thou shalt beat in pieces many people (Micah 4:13).
Jehovah <span id="fr_25"></span>[270-2](#fn_25.md) hath destroyed in His
wrath the stronghold of the daughter of Judah, and hath cut off all the
horn of Israel (Lam. 2:2-3). Powers are also signified by: The horns of
the dragon (Rev. 12:3). By the horns of the beast which came up out of
the sea (Rev. 13:1). By the horns of the scarlet beast upon which the
woman sat (Rev. 17:3, 7, 12). By the horns of the ram and the he-goat
(Dan. 8:3, 4-5, 7-12, 21, 25). By the horns of the beast which came up
out of the sea (Dan. 7:3, 7-8, 20-21, 23-24). By the four horns which
scattered Judah and Israel (Zech. 1:18-21). By the horns of the altar of
burnt-offerings, and the altar of incense (Exod. 27:2; 30:2-3, 10). By
these last was signified the power of Divine truth in the church; and,
on the other hand, that power would perish is signified by "the horns of
the altars in Bethel," in Amos: I will visit upon the transgressions of
Israel, I will visit upon the altars of Bethel, that the horns of the
altar may be cut off, and fall to the earth (Amos 3:14).

<span class="margnote"><span id="271.">271.</span></span>

And seven eyes, signifies His omniscience and Divine wisdom. That
"eyes," when spoken of the Lord, signify His Divine wisdom, may be seen
above (n. 48, 125), thus also omniscience; and that "seven" signifies
all, and is predicated of anything holy (n. 10); hence by "the seven
eyes of the Lamb," is signified the Divine wisdom of the Lord, which is
also omniscience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="272.">272.</span></span>

Which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth,
signifies that from the Divine wisdom is derived Divine truth into the
whole world, where there is religion. "The seven spirits of God" are the
Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as above (n. 14, 155). "To be sent
forth into all the earth," is into the whole world where there is
religion, is evident; for where there is religion, it is taught that
there is a God, and that there is a devil, and that God is good itself,
and that all good is from Him, and that the devil is evil itself, and
that all evil is from him; and, as they are opposites, so evil, because
it is from the devil, is to be shunned, and good, because it is from
God, is to be done; consequently, in proportion as anyone does evil, so
far he loves the devil, and acts against God. Such Divine truth is in
the whole world where there is any religion; so that it is only
necessary to know what evil is, and this also is known by all who have
any religion; for the precepts of all religions are similar to those
contained in the Decalogue, that one must not kill, nor commit whoredom,
nor steal, nor bear false witness. These are in general Divine truths
from the Lord "sent forth into all the earth," see The Doctrine of the
New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 101-118). Therefore he
who lives according to them because they are Divine truths, or the
commandments of God, and thence of religion, is saved. But he who only
lives according to them because they are civil and moral truths, is not
saved, for he that denies God may also so live, but not he that
confesses God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="273.">273.</span></span>

Verse 7. And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him that
sat upon the throne, signifies that the Lord as to His Divine Human is
the Word, and this is from His Divine in Himself and that therefore He
will execute judgment from His Divine Human. Here it manifestly appears,
that "He that sat upon the throne" and "the Lamb" are one Person, and
that by "Him that sat upon the throne" is meant His Divine from which
all things are, and by "the Lamb," His Divine Human; for it is said in
the preceding verse, that "he saw a Lamb standing in the midst of the
throne," and in this, that "He took the book from Him that sat upon the
throne." That the Lord will execute judgment from His Divine Human,
because He is the Word, is evident from these passages: And then shall
appear the sign of the Son of man; and they shall see the Son of man
coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory (Matt. 24:30). When
the Son of man shall sit on His throne He will judge the twelve tribes
of Israel (Matt. 19:28). The Son of man shall come in the glory of His
Father, and then shall He render to everyone according to his deeds
(Matt. 16:27). Watch always, that ye may be accounted worthy to stand
before the Son of man (Luke 21:36). In such an hour as ye think not, the
Son of man cometh (Matt. 24:44). For the Father judgeth no one, but hath
given all judgment unto the Son, because He is the Son of man (John
5:22, 27). "The Son of man" is the Lord as to the Divine Human, and this
is the Word, which was God, and became flesh (John 1:1, 14).

<span class="margnote"><span id="274.">274.</span></span>

Verse 8. And when He had taken the book, signifies when the Lord decided
to execute the judgment, and thereby to reduce all things in the heavens
and in the earths to order. By "taking the book" and opening it, is
signified to explore the states of life of all, and to judge everyone
according to his state, as above. Therefore here by "His taking the
book," is signified His decision to execute the Last Judgment; and as
the Last Judgment is executed for the purpose of reducing all things to
order in the heavens, and through the heavens, in the earths, this also
is signified.

<span class="margnote"><span id="275.">275.</span></span>

The four animals and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb,
signifies humiliation, and from humiliation, adoration of the Lord from
the higher heavens. Now follows the glorification of the Lord on the
above account, for, as was observed above (n. 263), unless the Lord
should now execute the Last Judgment, and thereby reduce all things in
the heavens and in the earths to order, all would perish. The
glorification of the Lord, which now follows, takes place first in the
higher heavens, afterwards in the lower heavens, and lastly in the
lowest heavens; the glorification by the higher heavens (verses 8-10);
by the lower heavens (verses 11, 12); and by the lowest heavens (verse
13); and lastly confirmation and adoration by the higher heavens (verse
14). Therefore the higher heavens are signified by the "four animals"
and "the twenty-four elders;" for by "the cherubim," which are the four
animals "in the midst of the throne," is signified the Lord as to the
Word; but by "the cherubim," or four animals "round about the throne,"
is signified heaven as to the Word; for it is said: That in the midst of
the throne, and round about the throne, were seen four animals, full of
eyes before and behind (Rev. 4:6). For the heavens are heavens from the
reception of the Divine truth through the Word from the Lord. By "the
twenty-four elders" are also signified the angels in the higher heavens,
because those elders were nearest around the throne (4:4). That "to fall
down before the Lamb" is humiliation, and from humiliation, adoration,
is evident.

<span class="margnote"><span id="276.">276.</span></span>

Having everyone of them harps, signifies confession of the Lord's Divine
Human from spiritual truths. It is known that confessions of Jehovah
were made in the temple at Jerusalem by singing, and at the same time by
instruments of music which corresponded; the instruments were
principally trumpets and timbrels, and psalteries and harps; the
trumpets and timbrels corresponded to celestial goods and truths, and
the psalteries and harps to spiritual goods and truths; the
correspondences were with their sounds. What celestial good and truth
is, and what spiritual good and truth, may be seen in the work
concerning Heaven and Hell (n. 13-19, and 20-28). That "harps" signify
confessions of the Lord from spiritual truths, may appear from these
passages: Confess to Jehovah with the harp, sing unto Him with the
psaltery of ten strings (Ps. 33:2). I will confess to Thee on the harp,
O God, my God (Ps. 43:4). I will confess to Thee on the instrument of
the psaltery, I will sing unto Thee with the harp, O Thou Holy One of
Israel (Ps. 71:22). Arouse me psaltery and harp, I will confess Thee
among the nations, O Lord (Ps. 57:8, 9; 108:2-4). Answer to Jehovah by
confession, play on the harp to our God (Ps. 147:7). It is good to
confess to Jehovah upon the psaltery, and upon higgaion on the harp (Ps.
92:2-4). Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah all the earth, sing unto
Jehovah with the harp, with the harp and the voice of singing (Ps.
98:4-6; and in many other places; as Ps. 43:4; 137:2; Job 30:31; Isa.
24:7-9; 30:31, 32; Rev. 14:2; 18:22). Because "the harp" corresponded to
confession of the Lord, and evil spirits could not endure it, therefore
David by the harp caused the evil spirit to depart from Saul (1 Samuel
16:14-16, 23). That they were not harps, but that confessions of the
Lord were heard by John as harps, may be seen below (n. 661).

<span class="margnote"><span id="277.">277.</span></span>

And golden vials full of incense, signifies confession of the Lord's
Divine Human from spiritual good. The reason why "incense" signifies
worship from spiritual goods, but in this instance confession from such
goods, is because the principal worship in the Jewish and Israelitish
church consisted in sacrifices and incense; wherefore there were two
altars, one for sacrifices and the other for incense; the latter altar
was within the tabernacle, and was called the golden altar, but the
former was without the tabernacle, and was called the altar of
burnt-offering; the reason was, because there are two kinds of goods,
from which all worship exists, celestial good and spiritual good:
celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is
the good of love towards the neighbor. Worship by sacrifices was worship
from celestial good, and worship by incense was worship from spiritual
good. Whether you call it worship or confession, it is the same thing,
for all worship is confession. What is signified by "incense," is also
signified by "the vials" in which the incense is contained, because the
thing containing and the thing contained, like the instrumental and
principal, act as one cause. \[2\] Worship from spiritual good is
signified by "incense" in the following passages: For from the rising of
the sun even unto the going down of the same, My name shall be great
among the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered unto My
name (Mal. 1:11). They shall teach Jacob Thy judgments, they shall put
incense in Thy nostril and a burnt-offering upon Thine altar (Deut.
33:10). I will offer unto Thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, with incense
(Ps. 66:13, 15). And they shall come from the circuit of Judah, offering
a burnt-offering, and a sacrifice, a meal-offering and incense (Jer.
17:26). They shall come from Sheba; they shall bring gold and incense,
and they shall declare the praises of Jehovah (Isa. 60:6). By
"frankincense" the same is signified as by "incense," because
frankincense was the principal aromatic from which incense was made.
Likewise in Matthew: The wise men from the east opened their treasures,
and offered to the Lord recently born, gold, frankincense, and myrrh
(Matt. 2:11). The reason why they offered these three was, because
"gold" signified celestial good, "frankincense" spiritual good, and
"myrrh" natural good, and from those three goods all worship is made.

<span class="margnote"><span id="278.">278.</span></span>

Which are the prayers of saints, signifies thoughts which are of faith,
from affections which are of charity, with those who worship the Lord
from spiritual goods and truths. By "prayers" are meant the things which
are of faith, and at the same time things which are of charity, with
those who pour forth prayers, because prayers without them are not
prayers, but empty sounds. That "saints" mean those who are in spiritual
goods and truths, may be seen above (n. 173). The reason why incense is
called "the prayers of saints" is because fragrant odors correspond to
the affections of good and truth; hence it is, that "a grateful odor"
and "an odor of rest to Jehovah," so often occur in the Word (as in
Exodus 29:18, 25, 41; Leviticus 1:9, 13, 17; 2:2, 9, 12; 3:5; 4:31;
6:15, 21; 8:28; 23:13, 18; 26:31; Numbers 15:3, 7; 28:6, 8, 13; 29:2, 6,
8, 13, 36; Ezekiel 20:41; Hosea 14:7). "Prayers" which are called
"incense" have a similar signification in the following passages in
Revelation: An angel stood at the altar having a golden vial, and there
was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the
prayers of all saints upon the golden altar; And the smoke of the
incense with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of
the angel's hand (Rev. 8:3-5). And in David: Give ear unto my voice; my
prayers have been accepted before Thee as incense (Ps. 141:1-2).

<span class="margnote"><span id="279.">279.</span></span>

Verse 9. And they sung a new song, signifies acknowledgment and
glorification of the Lord, that He alone is the Judge, Redeemer, and
Savior, thus the God of heaven and earth. These things are contained in
the song which they sung, and the things which are contained are also
signified; as an acknowledgment that the Lord is the Judge, in these
things which now follow: Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open
the seals thereof (Rev. 5:9). That He is the Redeemer, in this: Because
Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us in Thy blood (Rev. 5:9). That He
is the Saviour, in this: Thou hast made us unto our God kings and
priests, and we shall reign upon the earth (Rev. 5:10). That He is the
God of heaven and earth, in this: They fell down and adored Him that
liveth for ages of ages (Rev. 5:14). Since the acknowledgment that the
Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth, and that His Human is Divine,
and that in no other way could He be called the Redeemer and Saviour,
was not before in the church, it is therefore called a "new song." \[2\]
The reason why "a song" also signifies glorification, which is
confession from joy of heart, is because singing exalts, and causes
affection to break out from the heart into sound, and show itself
intensely in its life. Nor are the Psalms of David any other than songs;
for they were played and sung, and therefore were also called songs in
many passages (as Ps. 18:1; 33:1; 45:1; 46:1; 48:1; 65:1; 66:1; 67:1;
68:1; 75:1; 76:1; 87:1; 88:1; 92:1; 96:1; 98:1; 108:1; 120:1; 121:1;
122:1; 123:1; 124:1; 125:1; 126:1; 127:1; 128:1; 129:1; 130:1; 132:1;
133:1; 134:1). \[3\] That songs were for the sake of exalting the life
of love, and the joy derived from it, is evident from the following
passages: O sing unto Jehovah a new song, make a joyful noise unto
Jehovah all the earth, resound, shout (Ps. 98:1, 4-8). Sing unto Jehovah
a new song, let Israel rejoice in His Maker, sing psalms to Him (Ps.
149:1-3). Sing unto Jehovah a new song, lift up the voice (Isa. 42:10,
12). Sing, O ye heavens, shout ye lower parts of the earth, resound with
singing, ye mountains (Isa. 44:23; 49:13). Shout unto God our strength,
cry out to the God of Jacob; lift up a song (Ps. 81:1-3). Gladness and
joy shall be found in Zion, confession and the voice of singing (Isa.
51:3; 52:8, 9). Sing unto Jehovah, cry out and shout, O daughter of
Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee (Isa.
12:1-6). My heart is fixed, I will sing and sing psalms. Arouse thee, my
glory, I will confess Thee, O Lord, among the nations, I will sing
psalms unto Thee among the peoples (Ps. 57:7-9; and in many other
places).

<span class="margnote"><span id="280.">280.</span></span>

Saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof,
signifies that He alone can know the states of life of all, and judge
every man according to his own state, as above (n. 256, 259, 261, 267,
273).

<span class="margnote"><span id="281.">281.</span></span>

For thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God in Thy blood, signifies
deliverance from hell, and salvation by conjunction with Him. It is not
necessary to explain by the spiritual sense what is specifically
signified by all the particulars here mentioned, as what by "being
slain," by "redeeming us to God," and what by "His blood," for they are
arcana which do not appear in the sense of the letter; suffice it to
know that it is redemption which is thus described; and since it is
redemption it is deliverance from hell, and salvation by conjunction
with the Lord, which are signified. Here it shall only be confirmed from
the Word that Jehovah Himself came into the world, was born a Man, and
became the Redeemer and Savior of all, who by a life of charity and its
faith are conjoined with His Divine Human, and that Jehovah is the Lord
from eternity, consequently that the Divine Human of the Lord, with
which there must be conjunction, is the Divine Human of Jehovah Himself.
\[2\] Here therefore some passages shall be adduced, which prove that
Jehovah and the Lord are one; and since they are one and not two, that
the Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah Himself, by the assumption of the
Human, is the Redeemer and Savior: this is evident from the following
passages: Thou, O Jehovah, art our Father, our Redeemer; Thy name is
from everlasting (Isa. 63:16). Thus saith the king of Israel and his
Redeemer, Jehovah of Hosts, I am the First and the Last, and besides Me
there is no God (Isa. 44:6). Thus saith Jehovah thy Redeemer, and thy
Former; I am Jehovah that maketh all things, alone by Myself (Isa.
44:24). Thus saith Jehovah thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel, I am
Jehovah thy God (Isa. 48:17). Jehovah my Rock and my Redeemer (Ps.
19:14). Their Redeemer is strong, Jehovah of Hosts is His name (Jer.
50:34). Jehovah of Hosts is His name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of
Israel, the God of the whole earth shall He be called (Isa. 54:5). And
all flesh shall know that I Jehovah am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the
Mighty One of Jacob (Isa. 49:26; 60:16). As for our Redeemer, Jehovah of
Hosts is His name (Isa. 47:4). With everlasting mercy will I have mercy
on thee, saith Jehovah thy Redeemer (Isa. 54:8). Thus saith Jehovah your
Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 43:14). Thus saith Jehovah the
Holy One of Israel, your Redeemer (Isa. 49:7). Thou hast redeemed me,
Jehovah of truth (Ps. 31:5). Let Israel hope in Jehovah, for with Him
there is plenteous redemption, and He shall redeem Israel from all his
iniquities (Ps. 130:7, 8). Arise, O Lord, for our help, and redeem us
for Thy mercy's sake (Ps. 44:26). Thus saith Jehovah God, I will redeem
them from the hand of hell, I will redeem them from death (Hos. 13:4,
14). O Jehovah, hear my voice, He shall redeem my soul (Ps. 55:17, 18).
Also in Ps. 49:15; 69:18; 71:23; 103:1, 4; 107:2; Jer. 15:20, 21. \[3\]
That the Lord as to His Human is the Redeemer, is not denied in the
church, because it is according to Scripture, and the following
passages: Who is this that cometh from Edom, going in the multitude of
His strength? the year of His redeemed is come. He redeemed them (Isa.
63:1, 4, 9). Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation
cometh, behold, His reward is with Him, and they shall call them, The
people of holiness, the redeemed of Jehovah (Isa. 62:11-12). Blessed be
the Lord God of Israel, for He hath visited and hath made redemption for
His people (Luke 1:68; besides other places). Many other passages,
proving that the Lord from eternity, who is Jehovah Himself, came into
the world, and took upon Him the Human, to redeem men, may be seen in
The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 37-46).
Jehovah is also called the Savior in many places, which cannot be
adduced by reason of their abundance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="282.">282.</span></span>

Out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, signifies that
they in the church or in any religion, who are in truths as to doctrine,
and in goods as to life, are redeemed by the Lord. By "tribe" is
signified the church as to religion; by "tongue" is signified its
doctrine, of which we shall speak presently; by "people" are signified
they who are in truths of doctrine, and, abstractly, truths of doctrine
(n. 483); and by "nation" are signified they who are in the goods of
life, and, abstractly, the goods of life (n. 483); from hence it appears
that by these words, "Out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and
nation," such things are signified as were said above (see also n. 627).
\[2\] It shall now be proved that "tongue," in the spiritual sense,
signifies the doctrine of the church, or of any religion; this is
evident from the following passages: My tongue also shall meditate of
Thy justice, all the day Thy praise (Ps. 35:28; 71:24). Then shall the
lame leap as a stag, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing, for in the
wilderness shall waters break out (Isa. 35:6). The tongue of the
stammerers shall be swift to speak (Isa. 32:4). It appears as if in
these instances, by "tongue" was meant speech, but in the spiritual
sense that which is spoken is meant, which is truth of doctrine, which
they will have from the Lord. In like manner: I have sworn that unto Me
every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear (Isa. 45:23). The time
shall come to gather all nations and tongues, that they may come and see
My glory (Isa. 66:18). In those days ten men out of all the tongues of
the nations, shall take hold of the skirt of a man that is a Jew,
saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you
(Zech. 8:23). This is also concerning the conversion of the Gentiles by
the Lord to the truth of doctrine. \[3\] But by "tongues," in the
opposite sense, are signified false doctrines in the following passages:
A man of tongue shall not subsist on the earth (Ps. 140:11). Thou shalt
hide them in Thy tabernacle from the strife of tongues (Ps. 31:20). I
will bring a nation upon you, whose tongue thou knowest not (Jer. 5:15).
To be sent to people of heavy tongue (Ezek. 3:5, 6). To people of
barbarous tongue (Isa. 33:19). It is to be known that "tongue," as an
organ, signifies doctrine, but, as speech, it also signifies religion.
\[4\] He who knows that "tongue" signifies doctrine, may understand what
is meant by the words of the rich man in hell to Abraham: That he would
send Lazarus that he might dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool
his tongue, that he should not be tormented in the flame (Luke 16:24).
"Water" signifies truth, and "tongue" doctrine; by the falsities of
which he was tormented, and not by the flame; for no one in hell is in
flames, but flames there are appearances of the love of falsity; and
fire is the appearance of the love of evil.

Verse 10. And hast made us unto our God kings and priests, signifies
that from the Lord they are in wisdom from Divine truths and in love
from Divine goods, and thus images of His Divine wisdom, and of His
Divine love; as above (n. 21).

<span class="margnote"><span id="284.">284.</span></span>

And we shall reign upon the earth, signifies, and will be in His
kingdom, He in them and they in Him. By "reigning upon the earth,"
nothing else is meant, than being in the Lord's kingdom, and there one
with Him, according to these words of the Lord: That all who believe in
Me, may be one; and may be one as Thou Father art in Me and I in Thee,
that they also may be one in us; And the glory which thou gavest Me I
have given them, that they may be one even as we are one, I in them and
Thou in Me, that where I am, they also may be with Me (John 17:20-24).
As, therefore, they are thus one with the Lord, and, together with the
Lord, constitute a kingdom, which is called the kingdom of God, it is
evident that nothing else is signified by "reigning." It is said "to
reign" because it was before said, "Thou hast made us kings and
priests;" and by "kings" are signified they who are in wisdom from
Divine truths from the Lord; and by "priests," they who are in love from
Divine good from Him (n. 20); hence it is that the kingdom of the Lord
is also called "the kingdom of the saints" (Dan. 7:18, 27); and it is
said of the apostles, that: With the Lord they should judge the twelve
tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28). Nevertheless the Lord alone judges and
reigns; for He judges and reigns from Divine good by Divine truth, which
is also from Him in them; but he who believes, that what is in them from
the Lord is their own, is cast out of the kingdom, that is, out of
heaven. The signification of "reigning" is the same in the following
passages in Revelation: They shall be priests of God and Christ, and
shall reign with Him a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6). And concerning
those who are to enter into the New Jerusalem: The Lamb shall enlighten
them, and they shall reign for ages of ages (Rev. 22:5).

<span class="margnote"><span id="285.">285.</span></span>

It is said, "They shall reign on the earth," because by "earth" here and
elsewhere is meant the Lord's church in the heavens and on the earth.
The church, wherever it may be, is the Lord's kingdom. Lest, therefore,
anyone should believe that all who are redeemed by the Lord become kings
and priests, and that they will reign on the earth, it is important that
it be shown from the Word that the earth signifies the church. This may
be seen from the following passages: Behold, Jehovah maketh the earth
void, and maketh the earth empty, and turneth over the face of it; the
earth shall be made utterly void; the habitable earth shall mourn and be
confounded; the earth shall be profaned under its inhabitants; therefore
the curse shall devour the earth, and the inhabitants of the earth shall
be burnt up, and few men shall be left; there shall be in the midst of
the earth as the plucking of an olive tree. The cataracts from on high
are opened, and the foundations of the earth are shaken; the earth is
utterly broken in pieces; the earth is altogether burst asunder; the
earth is thoroughly shaken; the earth staggereth like a drunkard (Isa.
24:1-23). \[2\] The lion hath come up from the thicket to lay waste thy
land; I saw the earth, when, behold, it was void and empty; Jehovah
said, The whole earth shall be waste, therefore the earth shall mourn
(Jer. 4:7, 23-28). How long shall the earth mourn; the whole earth is
desolate, because there is not a man that layeth it to heart (Jer. 12:4,
11-13). The earth mourneth and languisheth, Lebanon is ashamed and is
withered away (Isa. 33:9). The earth shall become burning pitch, and be
laid waste (Isa. 34:9-10). I have heard a consummation and decree from
the Lord upon the whole earth (Isa. 28:2, 22). Behold, the day of
Jehovah cometh to lay the earth waste, and the earth shall be shaken out
of its place (Isa. 13:9, 13). The earth was shaken and trembled, and the
foundations of the mountains quaked (Ps. 18:7). We will not fear when
the earth is changed; when He uttereth his voice, the earth shall melt
(Ps. 46:2-3, 6, 8). Have ye not understood from the foundations of the
earth? (Isa. 40:21, 23). O God, Thou hast deserted us, Thou hast made
the earth to tremble; heal its breaches, because it is shaken (Ps.
60:1-2). \[3\] The earth and all its inhabitants shall melt; I will make
firm its pillars (Ps. 75:3). Woe to the land shadowed with wings; go, ye
ambassadors, to a nation trodden down, whose land the rivers have
spoiled (Isa. 18:1-2). Through the wrath of Jehovah Zebaoth is the earth
darkened (Isa. 9:19). Ye shall be a land of good pleasure (Mal. 3:12). I
have given thee for a covenant of the people, to restore the earth;
sing, O heavens; and exult, O earth (Isa. 49:8, 13). Thou shalt not see
Jah in the land of the living (Isa. 38:11). Who gave terror in the land
of the living (Ezek. 32:23-27). Unless I believed to see good in the
land of life (Ps. 27:13). Blessed are the meek, for they shall receive
the earth as an inheritance (Matt. 5:5). I am Jehovah that maketh all
things, that spreadeth out the heavens alone, that stretcheth out the
earth by Myself (Isa. 44:23, 24; Zech. 12:1; Jer. 10:11-13; 51:15; Ps.
136:6). Let the earth open itself, let it bring forth salvation; thus
said Jehovah, that createth the heavens, that formeth the earth (Isa.
45:8, 12, 18, 19). Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth (Isa.
65:17; 66:22). Besides many other places, which, if they were adduced,
would fill pages. \[4\] The reason why the church is signified by "the
earth" is because by "earth" the land of Canaan is often meant, in which
was the church; "the heavenly Canaan" is no other; as, also, because
when "the earth" is named, the angels, who are spiritual, do not think
of the earth, but of the human race that is upon it and of its spiritual
state, and its spiritual state is the state of the church. "The earth"
has also an opposite sense, and in that it signifies damnation, because
when there is no church with man, there is damnation; in this sense the
earth is mentioned in Isaiah 14:12; 21:9; 26:19, 21; 29:4; 47:1; 63:6;
Lamentations 2:10; Ezekiel 26:20; 32:24; Numbers 16:29-33; 26:10; and in
other places.

<span class="margnote"><span id="286.">286.</span></span>

Verse 11. And I saw, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
the throne, and the animals and the elders, signifies confession and
glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens. That there
was confession and glorification of the Lord by the angels of the three
heavens, may be seen above (n. 275); and by the angels of the higher
heavens, (from verses 8 to 10); and therefore now by the angels of the
lower heavens (verses 11, 12); wherefore by "the voice of the angels
round about the throne," is meant the confession and glorification of
the Lord by the angels of the lower heavens. That he then saw also the
animals and elders together with them, because by "the animals" and
"elders" are signified the angels of the higher heavens (n. 275), and
the lower heavens never act separately from the higher heavens, but in
conjunction with them; for the Lord inflows into all the heavens
immediately from Himself; thus also into the lower heavens; and at the
same time mediately through the higher heavens into the lower. This is
the reason, therefore, why "he saw and heard the animals and elders"
first by themselves, and afterwards in conjunction with the others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="287.">287.</span></span>

And the number of them was myriads of myriads, and thousands of
thousands, signifies all in truths and in goods. By "number," in the
natural sense, is meant that which has relation to measure or weight,
but by "number," in the spiritual sense, that which has relation to
quality; and here their quality is described by their being "myriads of
myriads, and thousands of thousands," for "a myriad" is predicated of
truths, and "a thousand" of goods. The reason why "a myriad" is
predicated of truths, and "a thousand" of goods, is because a myriad is
the greater number, and a thousand a less, and truths are manifold, but
goods are simple; also because where truths are treated of in the Word,
goods are treated of also, on account of the marriage of good and truth
existing in every particular, otherwise it would have been sufficient to
have said "myriads of myriads." Since these two numbers have such a
signification, they are mentioned also in other places, as in the
following: The chariots of God are two myriads, thousands of angels of
peace, the Lord is in them, Sinai in the sanctuary (Ps. 68:17). I saw,
when the Ancient of Days did sit, a thousand thousands ministered unto
Him, and myriads of myriads stood before Him (Dan. 7:9-10). Moses said
of Joseph: His horns are the horns of a unicorn; with them he shall push
the people together to the ends of the earth; and they are the myriads
of Ephraim, and the thousands of Manasseh (Deut. 33:17). Thou shalt not
be afraid for the pestilence that creepeth in thick darkness, nor for
the death that wasteth at noonday, a thousand shall fall at thy side,
and a myriad at thy right hand (Ps. 91:5-7). Our flocks are thousands,
myriads in our streets (Ps. 144:13). Is Jehovah delighted with thousands
of rams, or with myriads of rivers of oil? (Micah 6:7). When the ark
rested, Moses said: Return, Jehovah, unto the myriads of the thousands
of Israel (Num. 10:36). In all these places "myriads" are spoken of
truths, and "thousands" of goods.

Verse 12. Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain
to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and honor, and glory,
signifies confession from the heart, that the Lord as to the Divine
Human has omnipotence, omniscience, Divine good, and Divine truth. "To
say with a great voice," signifies confession from the heart; "Thou art
worthy," signifies that in Him are the things which follow; "The Lamb"
signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human; "power" signifies the Divine
power, which is omnipotence; "riches and wisdom," signify Divine
knowledge and wisdom, which are omniscience; "honor and glory," signify
the Divine good and the Divine truth. That "riches" signify the
knowledges of good and truth, and thus science, may be seen above (n.
206); therefore, when said of the Lord, they signify omniscience; and
that "honor and glory," when spoken of the Lord, signify the Divine good
and the Divine truth, see above (n. 249).

<span class="margnote"><span id="289.">289.</span></span>

And blessing, signifies all these things in Him, and from Him in them.
By "blessing" is meant every good which man receives from the Lord, as
power and opulence, and all that is implied by them; but especially
every spiritual good, as love and wisdom, charity and faith, and the joy
and felicity thence, which are of eternal life; and because all these
are from the Lord, it follows that they are in Him, for unless they were
in Him, they could not be in others from Him. Hence it is, that, in the
Word, the Lord is called "Blessed," and also "Blessing," that is,
Blessing Itself. That Jehovah, that is the Lord, is called "Blessed," is
evident from these passages: The high priest asked Jesus, Art thou the
Christ, the Son of the Blessed? (Mark 14:61). Jesus said, Ye shall not
see Me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is He that cometh in the
name of the Lord (Matt. 23:39; Luke 13:35). Melchizedek blessed Abram,
and said, Blessed be God Most High who hath given thine enemies into thy
hand (Gen. 14:18-20). Blessed be Jehovah the God of Shem (Gen. 9:26).
Blessed be Jehovah, who hath heard my voice (Ps. 28:6). Blessed be
Jehovah, for He hath made marvelous His kindness (Ps. 31:21). Blessed be
Jehovah, from everlasting to everlasting (Ps. 41:13). In like manner Ps.
66:20; 68:19, 35; 72:18, 19; 89:52; 119:12; 124:6; 135:21; 144:1; Luke
1:68). This is the reason why "blessing" is here mentioned, as also
verse 12, and 7:12; and likewise in David: Glory and honor dost Thou lay
upon Him, for Thou makest Him a blessing for ever (Ps. 21:5, 6). \[2\]
These are concerning the Lord. Hence it may be seen what is meant in the
Word by "blessing God," namely, to ascribe to Him all blessing; also to
pray that He would bless, and to give thanks for having blessed; as may
appear from the following passages: The mouth of Zacharias was opened,
and he spoke, blessing God (Luke 1:64, 68). Simeon took up the infant
Jesus in his arms, and blessed God (Luke 2:28, 30-31). Bless ye Jehovah,
who hath counselled for me (Ps. 16:7). Bless the name of Jehovah,
evangelize His salvation from day to day (Ps. 96:1-3). Blessed be the
Lord from day to day, bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord
from the fountain of Israel (Ps. 68:19, 26).

<span class="margnote"><span id="290.">290.</span></span>

Verse 13. And every created thing which is in heaven, and on the earth,
and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in
them, heard I saying, signifies confession and glorification of the Lord
by the angels of the lowest heavens. That this is a confession and
glorification of the Lord by the angels of the lowest heavens is evident
from the series, because the confessions and glorifications of the Lord
which precede were made by the angels of the higher and lower heavens
(n. 275, and following numbers, n. 286, and following numbers); for
there are three heavens, and innumerable societies in each, and each of
them is called a heaven. That by "every created thing which is in
heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and in the sea," are
meant angels, is evident, for it says, "heard I saying," and they said,
"Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth
upon the throne and unto the Lamb for ages of ages." \[2\] Their being
called "created thing" is according to the style of the Word, in which,
by all created things, as well those which belong to the animal kingdom
as those which belong to the vegetable kingdom, are signified various
things with man, in general such things as belong to his will or
affection, and such as pertain to his understanding or thought; for they
signify such things, because they correspond to them. And since the Word
is written by mere correspondences, similar things are said of the
angels of heaven and the men of the church; in proof of which a few
passages only shall be adduced, which are as follows: Jesus said to His
disciples, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every
creature (Mark 16:15). Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
and the birds of heaven and they shall tell thee; or the shrub of the
earth, and it shall teach thee, and the fishes of the sea shall declare
unto thee; who knoweth not from all these, that the hand of Jehovah hath
done this? (Job 12:7-9). Let the heaven and earth praise Jehovah, the
seas, and all that creepeth therein, for God will save Zion (Ps.
69:34-35). Praise Jehovah from the earth, ye whales and all deeps (Ps.
148:7). I will utterly consume all things from upon the face of the
earth, I will consume man and beast, I will consume the birds of the
heavens, and the fishes of the sea (Zeph. 1:2-3; likewise in Isa.
50:2-3; Ezek. 38:19-20; Hos. 4:2-3; Rev. 8:7-9). The heavens shall be
glad, and the earth shall rejoice; the sea shall be moved, and the
fullness thereof; the field shall exult, and all that is therein; then
shall all the trees of the wood sing before Jehovah, for He cometh; for
He cometh to judge the earth (Ps. 96:11-13; and in many other places).
\[3\] It is said "every created thing," by which is meant every reformed
thing, or all the reformed, for "to create" signifies to reform and
regenerate (n. 254). What is meant by "in heaven, upon the earth, and
under the earth," may be seen above (n. 260); and what by the "sea" (n.
238); hence it is evident what is signified by "such things as are in
the sea, and all that are in them"; these things are meant in the Word
by "the fishes of the sea," which are the sensual affections, these
being the lowest of the natural man, for in the spiritual world such
affections appear at a distance like "fishes," and as if they were "in
the sea," because the atmosphere in which they are, appears watery, and
therefore to those who are in the heavens and on the earth there, it
seems like "a sea," as may be seen above (n. 238), and concerning fishes
(n. 405).

<span class="margnote"><span id="291.">291.</span></span>

Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power, be unto Him that sitteth upon
the throne and unto the Lamb for ages of ages, signifies that in the
Lord from eternity, and thence in His Divine Human, is the all of heaven
and the church, the Divine good, and the Divine truth, and the Divine
power, and from Him in those who are in heaven and in the church. That
the Lord from eternity is Jehovah, who took upon Him the Human in time,
that He might redeem and save men, may be seen above (n. 281); therefore
by "Him that sitteth upon the throne," is meant the Lord from eternity,
who is called the Father, and by "the Lamb," the Lord as to the Divine
Human, which is the Son; and because the Father is in the Son, and the
Son in the Father, and they are one, it is evident that by both, or by
"Him that sitteth upon the throne and the Lamb," the Lord is meant; and
because they are one, it is also said that "the Lamb was in the midst of
the throne" (verse 6; also 7:17). That "blessing," when spoken of the
Lord, is the all of heaven and of the church in Him and from Him, in
those who are in heaven and in the church, may be seen above (n. 289).
That "honor and glory," are the Divine good and the Divine truth, may
also be seen above (n. 249); and that "power" when spoken of the Lord,
is the Divine power, is evident. That all these are the Lord's, may
appear from what is said in Daniel: Behold, with the clouds of the
heavens one like the Son of man came and even to the Ancient of Days;
and there was given Him dominion, and glory, and the kingdom, and all
peoples, nations, and languages, shall worship Him; His dominion is the
dominion of an age, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that
which shall not perish (Dan. 7:13-14). That "the Ancient of Days" is the
Lord from eternity, appears from these words in Micah: But thou,
Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah,
out of thee shall come forth unto Me, He who shall be ruler in Israel;
and whose goings forth have been from of old, from the days of eternity
(Micah 5:2). Also from these in Isaiah: Unto us a Boy is born, unto us a
Son is given, and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His
name shall be called Counsellor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, the
Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6).

<span class="margnote"><span id="292.">292.</span></span>

Verse 14. And the four animals said, Amen, signifies Divine confirmation
from the Word. That "the four animals" or cherubs signify the Word, may
be seen above (n. 239); and that "amen" signifies Divine confirmation
from truth itself (n. 23, 28, 61), thus from the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="293.">293.</span></span>

And the twenty-four elders fell down and adored Him that liveth forever
and ever signifies humiliation before the Lord, and from humiliation,
adoration of Him by all in the heavens, in Whom and from Whom is eternal
life, as above (n. 251, and n. 58, 60).

<span class="margnote"><span id="294.">294.</span></span>

To the above I will add this Relation. In the natural world the speech
of man is twofold, because his thought is twofold, exterior and
interior; for a man can speak from interior thought and at the same time
from exterior thought, and he can speak from exterior thought and not
from interior, yea, contrary to interior thought, whence come
dissimulations, flatteries, and hypocrisies. But in the spiritual world
man's speech is not twofold, but single. He there speaks as he thinks,
otherwise the sound is harsh and offends the ear; but yet he may be
silent, and so not publish the thoughts of his mind. Therefore, a
hypocrite, when he comes among the wise, either goes away, or retires to
a corner of the room and withdraws himself from observation, and sits
silent. \[2\] On one occasion there were many gathered together in the
world of spirits, who were discoursing on this subject, and saying, that
not to be able to speak except as one thinks, must be a hard thing for
those who might be in company with the good, but yet who have not
thought justly concerning God and the Lord. In the midst of the assembly
were those of the Reformed, and many of the clergy, and next to them
were papists and monks; and they all at first said it was not a hard
thing. "What need is there to speak otherwise than one thinks, and if
one should happen not to think justly, can he not close his lips and
keep silence?" And one of the clergy said, "Who does not think justly of
God and the Lord?" But some of the company said, "Let us, however, try."
And to those who had confirmed themselves in the idea of a Trinity of
Persons in God, especially from these words in the Athanasian doctrine,
"There is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of
the Holy Spirit, and as the Father is God, so the Son is God, and the
Holy Spirit is God," it was said that they should say, "one God"; but
they could not; they distorted and folded their lips in many ways, but
could not articulate a sound in any other words than such as were
consonant with the ideas of their thought, which were ideas of three
Persons, and thence of three gods. \[3\] They who had confirmed
themselves in faith separate from charity, were then asked to name
"Jesus"; but they could not; yet they could all say Christ, and also God
the Father. This they wondered at, and inquired into the cause, which
they found to be this, that they had prayed to God the Father for the
Son's sake, and had not prayed to the Savior Himself; for "Jesus"
signifies Savior. \[4\] They were then requested that from thinking of
the Lord's Divine Human, they should say, "Divine Human"; but none of
the clergy that were present could do so, though some of the laity
could, wherefore the matter was taken into serious discussion; and then:
1. The following passages from the Evangelists were read to them: The
Father hath given all things into the Son's hand (John 3:35). The Father
hath given the Son power over all flesh (John 17:2). All things are
delivered unto Me by the Father (Matt. 11:27). All power is given unto
Me in heaven and in earth (Matt. 28:18). And they were directed to keep
in the thought, that Christ, both as to His Divine and as to His Human,
is the God of heaven and earth, and thus to pronounce "Divine Human."
But still they could not; and they said that they indeed retained from
those passages something of the thought of it from their understanding
concerning it, but not acknowledgment, and that on its account they were
not able. \[5\] 2. Afterwards was read to them out of Luke (1:32, 34,
35), that the Lord as to the Human was the Son of Jehovah God, and that
everywhere in the Word He is called, as to the Human, "the Son of God,"
and also "the Only-begotten," and they were asked to hold this in the
thought; and likewise that the Only-begotten Son of God born in the
world cannot but be God, as the Father is God, and to utter the words,
"Divine Human." But they said, "We cannot, by reason that our spiritual
thought, which is interior, does not admit into the thought which is
next to the speech any other than similar ideas;" and that thence they
could perceive, that it is not permitted them to divide their thoughts,
as it was in the natural world. \[6\] 3. Then were read to them these
words of the Lord to Philip: Philip said, Lord, show us the Father, and
the Lord said, he who seeth Me seeth the Father; believest thou not that
I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? (John 14:8-11). And in another
place: The Father and He are one (John 10:30, and elsewhere). And it was
enjoined them to hold this in the thought and say, "Divine Human." But
as their thought was not rooted in the acknowledgment that the Lord was
God as to His Human also, therefore they could not; they twisted and
folded their lips even to indignation, and would have forced their mouth
to utter and force it out, but they were not able. The reason was,
because the ideas of thought, which flow from acknowledgment, make one
with words uttered by the tongue, with those who are in the spiritual
world; and where such ideas do not exist, there are no words, for the
ideas become words in speaking. \[7\] 4. Moreover there was read to them
from the doctrine of the church received throughout the whole world, the
following passage, taken from the Athanasian Creed: "That the Divine and
Human in the Lord are not two but one, yea, one Person, united
altogether like soul and body;" and it was said to them, "From this you
may possibly have an idea from the acknowledgment that the Lord's Human
is Divine, because His soul is Divine, for it is from the doctrine of
your church, acknowledged by you when in the world. Moreover the soul is
the essence itself, and the body is its form, and the essence and form
make one, like being and existing, and like the efficient cause of the
effect, and the effect itself." They retained that idea, and wished to
utter "Divine Human"; but they could not; for their interior idea
concerning the Lord's Human exterminated and expunged this new
supplemental idea, as they called it. \[8\] 5. Again there was read to
them this passage from John: The Word was with God, and God was the
Word; and the Word became flesh (John. 1:1, 14). And the following from
Paul: In Jesus Christ dwelleth all the fullness of the Divinity bodily
(Col. 2:9). And they were told to think firmly that God, who was the
Word, was made flesh, and that all the Divine dwells in Him bodily, and
perhaps then they might be able to pronounce "Divine Human." But still
they could not, saying openly that they could not have the idea of the
Divine Human, because God is God, and man is man, and God is spirit, and
of a spirit we have never thought any otherwise than as of wind or
ether. \[9\] 6. At length it was said to them: you know that the Lord
said: Abide in me, and I in you, he who abideth in Me, and I in him, the
same beareth much fruit, for without Me ye can do nothing (John 15:4-5).
And as some of the English clergy were present, there was read to them
this passage out of one of their exhortations before the holy communion,
"For when we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ, and drink the blood,
then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us." "If now you will but think
that this cannot take place, except the Lord's Human be Divine, you may
pronounce 'Divine Human,' from an acknowledgment in thought." But still
they could not; so deeply was the idea impressed upon them that the
Lord's Divine was one thing and His Human another, and that His Divine
was like the Divine of the Father, and His Human like the human of
another man. But it was said to them, "How can you think thus? Is it
possible for a rational mind ever to think that God is three, and the
Lord two?" \[10\] 7. Afterwards they turned to the Lutherans, saying
that the Augustan confession and Luther taught that the Son of God and
the Son of man in Christ are one Person, and that He even as to the
Human nature, is the true, omnipotent, and eternal God, and that as to
this nature also, being present at the right hand of God Almighty, He
governs all things in the heavens and on earth, fills all things, is
with us, and dwells and operates in us; and that there is no distinction
of adoration, because by the nature which is seen, the Divinity which is
not seen is adored, thus that in Christ God is Man and Man is God. On
hearing this, they said, "Is it so?" And they looked round, and
presently they said, "This is what we did not know before; therefore we
are not able." But one and another said, "We have read it and written
it, but yet when we thought of it in ourselves from ourselves, they were
only words of which we had no interior idea." \[11\] 8. At length,
turning to the papists, they said, "Possibly you can name the 'Divine
Human,' because you believe that in your Eucharist, in the bread and
wine and in every part, there is the whole of Christ, and also you adore
Him as God, when you show and carry about the host; and likewise because
you call Mary the bringer forth of God, consequently you acknowledge
that she brought forth God, that is, the Divine Human." They then wished
to pronounce it from those ideas, of the thought concerning the Lord,
but could not, by reason of their entertaining a material idea of His
body and blood; and by reason of the assertion that the Human and not
the Divine power is transferred by Him to the Pope. Then a certain monk
rose up and said that he could think of the Divine Human, concerning the
most holy virgin Mary, the God-bearer, and also of the saint of his
monastery. And another monk came, and said, "From my idea of thought, I
could rather call his holiness, the Pope, the Divine Human, than
Christ;" but then some other monks pulled him back, and said, "Shame on
you." \[12\] After this heaven was seen open, and there were seen
tongues, as little flames, descending and flowing in with some; and they
then celebrated the Divine Human of the Lord, saying, "Remove the idea
of three Gods, and believe that in the Lord dwells all the fullness of
Divinity bodily, and that the Father and He are one, as the soul and
body are one, and that God is not wind, or ether, but that He is Man,
and then you will be conjoined with heaven, and thereby have power from
the Lord to pronounce the name of 'Jesus,' and say 'Divine Human.'"

Revelation 6 1. And I saw when the lamb had opened the first of the
seals, and I heard one of the four animals saying, as with a voice of
thunder, Come and look. 2. And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he
that sat upon him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him, and he went
forth conquering and to conquer. 3. And when he had opened the second
seal, I heard the second animal saying, Come and look. 4. And there went
out another horse that was red, and it was given to him that sat thereon
to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and
there was given unto him a great sword. 5. And when he had opened the
third seal, I heard the third animal saying, Come and look. And I saw,
and behold, a black horse; and he that sat upon him had a balance in his
hand. 6. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals, saying, A
measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny;
and hurt not the oil and the wine. 7. And when he had opened the fourth
seal, I heard the voice of the fourth animal saying, Come and look. 8.
And I saw, and behold, a pale horse; and his name that sat upon him was
Death, and hell followed with him; and power was given unto them over
the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with hunger,
and with death, and by beasts. <span id="fr_26"></span>[295-1](#fn_26.md)
9. And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the
souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony
which they held. 10. And they cried with a great voice, saying, How
long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on
them that dwell on the earth? 11. And white robes were given unto each
of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet a little
while, until their fellow-servants also, and their brethren, that would
be killed as they were, should be fulfilled. 12. And I saw when he had
opened the sixth seal, and behold, there was a great earthquake; and the
sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood. 13.
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, as a fig tree casteth its
unripe figs, when shaken by a great wind. 14. And the heaven departed as
a book rolled together: and every mountain and island were moved out of
their places. 15. And the kings of the earth, and the great ones, and
the rich, and the rulers of thousands, and the mighty, and every
servant, and every freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks
of the mountains; 16. And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall upon us,
and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne, and from
the anger of the Lamb. 17. Because the great day of His anger is come,
and who shall be able to stand? THE SPIRITUAL SENSE The contents of the
whole chapter It treats of the exploration of those on whom the Last
Judgment is to be executed; and exploration is made as to what the
quality of their understanding of the Word had been and thence the
quality of their state of life. That there were those who were in truths
from good (verses 1, 2); those who were without good (verses 3, 4);
those who were in contempt of truth (verses 5, 6); and those who were
totally vastated both as to good and truth (verses 7, 8). Of the state
of those who were guarded by the Lord in the lower earth, on account of
the evil, and were to be delivered at the time of the Last Judgment
(verses 9-11). Of the state of those who were in evils and thence in
falsities, what it is at the day of the Last Judgment (verses 12-17).
The contents of each verse Verse 1. "And I saw when the Lamb had opened
the first of the seals," signifies exploration by the Lord of all those
upon whom the Last Judgment was about to come as to their understanding
of the Word, and thence as to their states of life (n. 295). "And I
heard one of the four animals saying, as with a voice of thunder,"
signifies, according to the Divine truth of the Word (n. 296). "Come and
look," signifies a manifestation concerning the first in order (n. 297).
Verse 2. "And I saw, and behold, a white horse," signifies the
understanding of truth and good from the Word with these (n. 298); "And
he that sat upon him had a bow," signifies that they had the doctrine of
truth and good from the Word, from which they fought against the
falsities and evils which are from hell (n. 299); "And a crown was given
unto him," signifies their badge of combat (n. 300); "And he went forth
conquering, and to conquer," signifies victory over evils and falsities
to eternity (n. 301). Verse 3. "And when He had opened the second seal,
I heard the second animal saying, Come and look," signifies the same
here as above (n. 302-304). Verse 4. "And there went out another horse
that was red," signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed as to
good, and thence as to life, with these (n. 305). "And it was given to
him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth," signifies the taking
away of charity, spiritual security, and internal rest (n. 306). "And
that they should kill one another," signifies intestine hatreds,
infestations from the hells, and internal unrest (n. 307). "And there
was given unto him a great sword," signifies the destruction of truth by
falsities of evil (n. 308). Verse 5. "And when He had opened the third
seal, I heard the third animal saying, Come and look," signifies the
same here as above (n. 309-311). "And I saw, and behold, a black horse,"
signifies the understanding of the Word destroyed with these as to
truth, and thus as to doctrine (n. 312). "And he that sat upon him had a
balance in his hand," signifies the estimation of good and truth, what
it was with these (n. 313). Verse 6. "And I heard a voice in the midst
of the four animals saying," signifies the Divine guarding of the Word
by the Lord (n. 314). "A measure of wheat for a penny, and three
measures of barley for a penny," signifies, because the estimation of
good and truth is so small as to be scarcely anything (n. 315). "And
hurt not the oil and the wine," signifies that it is provided by the
Lord, that the holy goods and truths which lie interiorly concealed in
the Word, should not be violated and profaned (n. 316). Verse 7. "And
when He had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth
animal saying, Come and look," signifies the same here as above (n.
317-319). Verse 8. "And I saw, and behold, a pale horse," signifies the
understanding of the Word destroyed both as to good and as to truth (n.
320). "And his name that sat upon him was Death, and hell followed with
him," signifies the extinction of spiritual life and thence damnation
(n. 321). "And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the
earth, to kill," signifies the destruction of all good in the church (n.
322). "With sword, and with hunger, and with death, and by the beasts of
the earth," signifies by falsities of doctrine, by evils of life, by the
love of the proprium, and by lusts (n. 323). Verse 9. "And when He had
opened the fifth seal," signifies exploration by the Lord of the states
of life of those who were to be saved at the day of the Last Judgment,
and were in the meantime reserved (n. 324). "I saw under the altar the
souls of them that were slain for the Word of God, and for the testimony
which they held," signifies those who were rejected by the evil on
account of their life according to the truths of the Word, and their
acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine Human, and who were guarded by the
Lord lest they be seduced (n. 325). Verse 10. "And they cried with a
great voice," signifies grief of heart (n. 326), "Saying, How long, O
Lord, <span id="fr_27"></span>[295-2](#fn_27.md) dost Thou not judge and
avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" signifies by reason
that the Last Judgment is delayed, and that they who offer violence to
the Word and to the Lord's Divine are not removed (n. 327). Verse 11.
"And white robes were given unto each of them," signifies their
communication and conjunction with angels who are in Divine truths (n.
328); "And it was said, that they should rest yet for a little while,
until their fellow-servants also, and their brethren, that would be
killed as they were, should be fulfilled," signifies that the Last
Judgment would yet be delayed a little, till they should be collected,
who were in like manner rejected by the evil (n. 329). Verse 12. "And I
saw when He had opened the sixth seal," signifies exploration by the
Lord of their state of life, who were interiorly evil, upon whom the
judgment was about to come (n. 330). "And behold, there was a great
earthquake," signifies the state of the church with those totally
changed, and terror (n. 331). "And the sun became black as sackcloth of
hair, and the moon became as blood," signifies the adulteration of all
the good of love with them, and the falsification of all the truth of
faith (n. 332). Verse 13. "And the stars <span
id="fr_28"></span>[295-3](#fn_28.md) fell unto the earth," signifies the
dispersion of all the knowledges of good and truth (n. 333). "Even as a
fig tree casteth its unripe figs, when shaken by a great wind,"
signifies by the reasonings of the natural man separated from the
spiritual (n. 334). Verse 14. "And the heaven departed as a book rolled
together," signifies separation from heaven and conjunction with hell
(n. 335). "And every mountain and island were moved out of their
places," signifies that all the good of love and truth of faith departed
(n. 336). Verse 15. "And the kings of the earth, and the great ones, and
the rich, and the rulers of thousands, and the mighty, and every
servant, and every freeman," signifies those who, before separation,
were in the understanding of truth and good, in the science of the
knowledges thereof, in erudition, either from others or from themselves,
and yet not in a life according to them (n. 337). "Hid themselves in the
caves and in the rocks of the mountains," signifies that they were now
in evils and in falsities of evil (n. 338). Verse 16. "And said to the
mountains and rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of Him that
sitteth upon the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb," signifies
confirmations of evil by falsities from evil, until they did not
acknowledge any Divine of the Lord (n. 339). Verse 17. "Because the
great day of His anger is come, and who shall be able to stand?"
signifies that they had become such of themselves by separation from the
good and the faithful on account of the Last Judgment, which otherwise
they could not endure (n. 340). THE EXPLANATION Verse 1. And I saw when
the Lamb had opened the first of the seals, signifies exploration by the
Lord of all those upon whom the Last Judgment was about to come, as to
their understanding of the Word, and thence as to their states of life.
This is signified, because now follows in order the exploration of all
upon whom the Last Judgment was about to come, as to their states of
life, and this from the Lord according to the Word. This then is the
signification of "the Lamb's opening the seals of the book." That "to
open the book," and "loose the seals thereof," signifies to know the
states of the life of all, and to judge everyone according to his own,
may be seen above (n. 259-265, 267, 273, 274).

<span class="margnote"><span id="296.">296.</span></span>

And I heard one of the four animals saying as with a voice of thunder,
signifies according to the Divine truth of the Word. That by "the four
animals," or "cherubim," is meant the Word, may be seen above (n. 239,
275, 286), and by "a voice of thunder," the perception of the Divine
truth (n. 236). It is here said "a voice of thunder," because by this
animal is meant the lion, by which is signified the Divine truth of the
Word as to power (n. 241); hence it is, that this animal is said to have
spoken "as a voice of thunder," for it is said afterwards, that the
second animal spoke, then the third, and the fourth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="297.">297.</span></span>

Come and look, signifies a manifestation concerning the first in order.
It was said above, that in this chapter is described the exploration of
all upon whom the judgment was about to come, as to their states of
life, and this from the Lord according to the Word (n. 295); here
therefore is described the exploration of the first in order, as to
their understanding of the Word, and thence the states of their life.
That the church is from the Word, and that it is such as is its
understanding of the Word, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 76-79).

<span class="margnote"><span id="298.">298.</span></span>

Verse 2. And I saw, and behold, a white horse, signifies the
understanding of truth and good from the Word with these. By "horse" is
signified the understanding of the Word, and by "a white horse" the
understanding of truth from the Word; for white is predicated of truth
(n. 167). That "a horse" signifies the understanding of the Word, is
shown in a separate small work on The White Horse; but as a few passages
only are there quoted, others shall be here quoted by way of further
confirmation. This is very manifest from this that "horses" were seen to
go out of the book which the Lamb had opened, and from "the animals
saying, Come and look"; for by "the animals" is signified the Word (n.
239, 275, 286); so likewise by "the book" (n. 256); and by "the Son of
man," who is here "the Lamb," the Lord as to the Word (n. 44). From
these things it is now evident, that nothing is meant here by "horse"
but the understanding of the Word. This may appear more manifestly still
from the following passages in Revelation: I saw heaven opened, and
behold, a white horse, and He that sat upon him is called the Word of
God, and He hath on His vesture and on His thigh a name written, King of
kings and Lord of lords. And His armies in the heavens followed Him upon
white horses (Rev. 19:11, 13-14, 16). \[2\] That "a horse" signifies the
understanding of the Word, may also appear from the following passages:
Was thy wrath against the sea, O Jehovah, that Thou didst ride upon Thy
horses, and Thy chariots of salvation? Thou didst tread the sea with Thy
horses, the mud of the waters (Hab. 3:8, 15). The hoofs of Jehovah's
horses are counted as flints (Isa. 5:28). In that day I will smite every
horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness; and will smite
every horse of the people with blindness (Zech. 12:4). In that day there
shall be upon the bells of the horses holiness unto Jehovah (Zech.
14:20). Because God hath made her forget wisdom, neither hath imparted
intelligence. What time she lifteth up herself on high she laugheth at
the horse and his rider (Job 39:17-18 seq.). And I will cut off the
horse from Jerusalem, and he shall speak peace to the nations (Zech.
9:10). At Thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and the horse are
cast into a deep sleep (Ps. 76:6). And I will overthrow the throne of
kingdoms, and I will overthrow the chariot and those that ride in them,
and the horses and their riders shall come down (Hag. 2:22). By thee I
will destroy kingdoms; and by thee I will disperse the horse and his
rider (Jer. 51:20-21). Gather yourselves on every side to My sacrifice;
thus shall ye be satiated at My table with horse and chariot, thus I
will give My glory among the nations (Ezek. 39:17, 20-21). Gather
yourselves together unto the great supper of God; and ye shall eat the
flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them (Rev. 19:17-18). Dan shall
be an asp upon the path, that biteth the heels of the horse, so that his
rider shall fall backwards; I wait for thy salvation, O Jehovah (Gen.
49:17-18). Gird on thy sword, O Mighty One, mount, ride upon the Word of
truth (Ps. 45:3-4). Sing unto God, extol him that rideth upon the clouds
(Ps. 68:4). Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a cloud (Isa. 19:1). Sing psalms
unto the Lord that rideth upon the heaven of heavens of old (Ps.
68:32-33). God rode upon a cherub (Ps. 18:10). Then shalt thou delight
thyself in Jehovah, and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places
of the earth (Isa. 58:14). Jehovah alone did lead him, and made him to
ride upon the high places of the earth (Deut. 32:12-13). I will make
Ephraim to ride (Hos. 10:11). \[3\] Ephraim also signifies the
understanding of the Word. Because Elijah and Elisha represented the
Lord as to the Word, therefore they were called "the chariot of Israel
and his horsemen." Elisha said to Elijah: My father, my father, the
chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof (2 Kings 2:12). And king
Joash said to Elisha, O my father, the chariot of Israel and the
horsemen thereof (2 Kings 13:14). Jehovah opened the eyes of Elisha's
boy, and he saw, and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots
of fire round about Elisha (2 Kings 6:17). A "chariot" signifies
doctrine from the Word, and a "horseman," one that is wise by means of
it. The same is signified by: The four chariots which came out from
between the mountains of brass, and by the four horses harnessed in
them, which were red, black, white, and speckled, which are also called
the four spirits, and are said to have gone forth from standing before
the Lord of all the earth (Zech. 6:1-8, 15). In these places, by
"horses" is signified the understanding of the Word, or the
understanding of truth from the Word, and in like manner in other
places. \[4\] It may appear still more clearly from the mention that is
made of "horses" in the opposite sense, in which they signify the
understanding of the Word and of truth falsified by reasonings, and
likewise destroyed; as also one's own intelligence; as in the following
passages: Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on
horses, but look not unto the Holy One of Israel; for Egypt is man and
not God, and the horses thereof flesh and not spirit (Isa. 31:1, 3).
Thou shalt set him king over Israel whom Jehovah shall choose; but only
he shall not multiply horses to himself, lest he bring back the people
into Egypt to multiply horses (Deut. 17:15-16). These things were said,
because by "Egypt" are signified science and reasoning from one's own
intelligence, whence comes the falsification of the truth of the Word,
which is here "a horse." Asshur shall not save us, we will not ride upon
a horse (Hos. 14:3). Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we
will glory in the name of the Lord our God (Ps. 20:7). A horse is a
false thing for safety (Ps. 33:17). Jehovah delighteth not in the
strength of the horse (Ps. 147:10). The Holy One of Israel saith, In
confidence shall be your strength; but ye said, No; for we will flee
upon a horse; we will ride upon the swift (Isa. 30:15-16). Jehovah will
make Judah as a horse of glory; the riders on horses shall be ashamed
(Zech. 10:3, 5). Woe to the city of blood, it is all full of a lie, the
neighing horses, and the leaping chariots; the horseman lifteth up
(Nahum 3:1-4). I will bring against Tyre the king of Babylon, with horse
and with chariot, and with horsemen; by reason of the abundance of
horses their dust shall cover thee; thy walls shall be shaken at the
voice of the horsemen and of the chariots; with the hoofs of his horses
shall he tread down all thy streets (Ezek. 26:7-11). By "Tyre" is
signified the church as to the knowledges of truth, here such as are
falsified in her, which are "the horses of Babylon," besides other
places (as Isa. 5:26, 28; Jer. 6:22, 23; 8:16; 46:4, 9; 50:37, 38, 42;
Ezek. 17:15; 23:6, 20; Hab. 1:6, 8-10; Ps. 66:12). The understanding of
the Word destroyed is also signified by the "red, black, and pale
horse," mentioned below. That it is from appearances in the spiritual
world that "a horse" signifies the understanding of truth from the Word,
see the small tract concerning The White Horse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="299.">299.</span></span>

And he that sat upon him had a bow, signifies that they had the doctrine
of truth and good from the Word, from which they fought against the
falsities and evils which are from hell, thus against hell. By "Him that
sat upon the white horse," as mentioned in Revelation 19:13, is meant
the Lord as to the Word; but by him that sat upon this white horse, is
meant a man-angel as to the doctrine of truth and good from the Word,
thus from the Lord; in like manner as by: The Lord's army in heaven,
which followed the Lord upon white horses (Rev. 19:14). Of Him that sat
on the white horse (Revelation 19), it is said that: Out of His mouth
went forth a sharp sword, that with it He should smite the nations (Rev.
19:15). And by "the sword out of His mouth," is signified the Divine
truth of the Word fighting against falsities and evils (n. 52, 108,
117); but here it is said that he who sat on this white horse had "a
bow," and by "a bow" is signified the doctrine of truth and good from
the Word fighting against evils and falsities. To fight against
falsities and evils is also to fight against the hells, because evils
and falsities are from thence, therefore this also is signified. \[2\]
That "a bow," in the Word, signifies doctrine combating, in both senses,
may appear from these passages: The arrows of Jehovah are sharp, and all
His bows bent, the hoofs of His horses shall be counted like flints
(Isa. 5:28). The Lord bent His bow like an enemy (Lam. 2:4). Thou, O
Jehovah, ridest upon Thy horses, Thy bow shall be made naked (Hab.
3:8-9). He gave the nations before Him and made Him rule over kings. He
gave them as dust to His sword, and as stubble to His bow (Isa. 41:2).
In these places "a bow," because it is applied to Jehovah or the Lord,
signifies the Word, from which the Lord fights with man against evils
and falsities. I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse
from Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be cut off; and he shall speak
peace to the nations (Zech. 9:10). They bend their tongue, their bow is
a lie, and not the truth (Jer. 9:3). Behold the wicked bend their bow,
they make ready the arrows upon the string, to shoot in the darkness the
upright in heart (Ps. 11:2). They shall sorely grieve Joseph, and shoot,
the archers hold him in hatred; but he shall sit in the strength of his
bow, from the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (Gen. 49:23-24). Put
yourselves in array against Babylon, all ye that bend the bow, shoot at
her, spare not the arrow, for she hath sinned against Jehovah (Jer.
50:14, 29). David lamented over Saul to teach the sons of Judah the bow
(2 Sam. 1:17-18). In that lamentation the combat of truth against
falsities is treated of. \[3\] Thus saith Jehovah of Hosts; Behold I
break the bow of Elam, the beginning of his might (Jer. 49:35). Jehovah
hath made me a polished shaft, in His quiver hath He hidden me (Isa.
49:2). Behold, sons are an heritage of Jehovah, happy is he that hath
filled his quiver with them (Ps. 127:3-5). "Sons" here, as in other
places, signify truths of doctrine. In Salem shall be the tabernacle of
Jehovah, there broke He the string of the bow, the shield, the sword,
and war (Ps. 76:2-3). Jehovah will make wars to cease, He will break the
bow, He will cut the spear in sunder, He will burn the chariot in the
fire (Ps. 46:9; Ezek. 39:8-9; Hos. 2:18). In these passages "a bow"
signifies the doctrine of truth combating against falsities, and in the
opposite sense, the doctrine of falsity combating against truths;
therefore "arrows" and "darts" signify truths or falsities. As "war" in
the Word signifies spiritual war, therefore the arms of war, such as the
sword, spear, shield, buckler, bow and arrows, signify such things as
belong to that war.

<span class="margnote"><span id="300.">300.</span></span>

And a crown was given unto him, signifies his badge of combat. "A crown"
signifies a badge of combat, because in ancient times kings wore crowns
in battle, as may appear from history, and partly from 2 Samuel 1:10,
where: The man said to David concerning Saul, that when he died in
battle, he took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelets that
were upon his arms (2 Sam. 1:10). Then also from what is said of the
king of Rabbah and David (2 Samuel 12:29-30). And as temptations are
spiritual combats which the martyrs sustained, therefore crowns were
given them as badges of victory (n. 103). Hence it appears, that by "a
crown" is here signified the badge of their combat; therefore it
follows, "And he went forth conquering, and to conquer."
