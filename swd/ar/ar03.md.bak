### Apocalypse Revealed

<span class="margnote"><span id="101.">101.</span></span>

And ye shall have affliction ten days, signifies that this will endure
its full time, that is, as long as they are willing to remain in
falsities. "Affliction" here signifies infestation (of which above, n.
33, 95), thus temptation; and "ten days" signify the duration of that
state to the full; therefore it follows, "Be thou faithful unto death,"
by which is signified the reception and acknowledgment of truths, until
by their means falsities are removed, and as it were abolished. That
"ten days" signify duration of state even to the full is, because "days"
signify states, and "ten" what is full: for times in the Word signify
states (n. 947), and numbers describe their quality (n. 9). \[2\] As
"ten" signify what is full, they also signify much and many, also each
and all, as may appear from these passages which follow: The men who
have seen My glory, have tempted Me ten times (Num. 14:22). These ten
times have ye treated me with ignominy (Job 19:3). Daniel was found ten
times wiser than the astrologers (Dan. 1:20). Ten women shall bake bread
in one oven (Lev. 26:26). Ten men out of all languages of the nations
shall take hold of the skirt of a man a Jew (Zech. 8:23). Because "ten"
signifies many, and also all, therefore the things which were written
upon the tables of the Decalogue by Jehovah, are called the "Ten Words"
(Deut. 4:13; 10:4); the "Ten Words" signify all truths, for they include
them. And because "ten" signifies all and all things, therefore the Lord
compared the kingdom of the heavens to "ten virgins" (Matt. 25:1).
Likewise in the parable He said of the nobleman, that he gave his
servants "ten pounds" to trade with (Luke 19:12-27). Many are also
signified by: The ten horns of the beast which came up out of the sea
(Dan. 7:7); And by the ten horns and the ten diadems upon the horns of
the beast coming up out of the sea (Rev. 13:1); Also by the ten horns of
the dragon (Rev. 12:3); And by the ten horns of the scarlet-colored
beast, upon which the woman sat (Rev. 17:3, 7, 12). \[3\] By "ten horns"
is signified much power. From the signification of the number "ten," as
being what is full, much, and all, it may be seen why it was ordained,
that: A tenth part of all the produce of the earth was given to Jehovah,
and by Jehovah to Aaron and the Levites (Num. 18:24, 28; Deut. 14:22);
also, why Abram gave Melchizedek tithes of all (Gen. 14:18, 20); for by
this was signified that thus all they had was from Jehovah, and was
sanctified (see Mal. 3:10). From these things, it may now appear, that
by having "affliction ten days," is signified that temptation will last
its full time, that is, so long as they are willing to remain in
falsities; for falsities are never taken away from a man against his
will, but with it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="102.">102.</span></span>

Be thou faithful unto death, signifies reception and acknowledgment of
truths, until falsities are removed, and as it were abolished. By "be
thou faithful unto death," in the natural sense, is meant, that they
must not depart from fidelity even to the end of life; but in the
spiritual sense, that they must receive and acknowledge truths, even
until falsities are removed by them, and as it were abolished; for this
sense is properly for those who are in the spiritual world, for whom
there is no death. Therefore by "death" is here meant the end of their
temptation. It is said, until they are, as it were, abolished, because
falsities and evils with man are not abolished, but removed, and when
they are removed they appear as if they were abolished, because when
evils and falsities are removed, man is kept in goods and truths by the
Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="103.">103.</span></span>

And I will give thee a crown of life, signifies that they will then have
eternal life, the reward of victory. Because temptations even unto death
are here treated of, it is said that a crown of life will be given them,
such as the martyrs had, who were faithful even unto death; and because
the martyrs wished for it, therefore after death crowns were given them,
by which was signified the reward of victory; they still appear in their
crowns in heaven, which it has been granted me to see.

<span class="margnote"><span id="104.">104.</span></span>

Verse 11. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
the churches; that this signifies that he who understands these things,
ought to obey what the Divine truth of the Word teaches those who will
be of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, is evident from the
explanation of like words above (n. 87).

<span class="margnote"><span id="105.">105.</span></span>

He that overcometh; that this signifies he that fights against evils and
falsities, and is reformed, is evident from the explanation (n. 88),
where like words occur.

<span class="margnote"><span id="106.">106.</span></span>

Shall not be hurt of the second death, signifies that afterwards they
shall not succumb to the evils and falsities from hell. By the first
death is meant the death of the body, and by the "second death" is meant
the death of the soul, which is damnation (see below, n. 853, 873); and
because "Be thou faithful unto death," signifies that they ought to
acknowledge truths till by their means falsities are removed (n. 102),
it follows, that by "not being hurt of the second death," is signified
that afterwards they shall not succumb under evils and falsities from
hell, for thereby they are exempted from damnation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="107.">107.</span></span>

Verse 12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, signifies to
those and concerning those who place the all of the church in good
works, and not anything in the truths of doctrine. That these are meant
by "the church in Pergamos," is evident from what is written to it, when
understood in the spiritual sense. But something must be premised
concerning these, that it may be known who they are in the church, and
what is their quality. There are two kinds of men of whom the Christian
church at this day for the most part consists; one, who are in works
alone, and in no truths; the other, who are in worship alone, and
neither in works nor in truths; the former are here treated of; the
latter in what is written to the church in Sardis (n. 154). They who are
in works alone and in no truths, are like those who act and do not
understand, and deeds without understanding are inanimate. They appear
before the angels like images carved out of wood; and they who have
placed merit in their works, appear like those carved images, naked,
without any covering whatever; they appear also like sheep without wool;
and they who place merit in them, like such sheep covered with dung; for
all works are done from the will by the understanding, and in the
understanding they receive life, and at the same time clothing; hence it
is, as was said, that they appear to the angels as things inanimate and
naked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="108.">108.</span></span>

These things saith He that hath the sharp two-edged sword, signifies the
Lord as to the truths of doctrine from the Word, by which evils and
falsities are dispersed. In the preceding chapter, where the Son of man
is described, Who is the Lord as to the Word, it is said that: A sharp
two-edged sword was seen to go out of His mouth (Rev. 2:16). That by
this is signified the dispersion of falsities by the Word, and by
doctrine thence from the Lord, may be seen above (n. 52). This is said
to those and concerning those, who place the all of the church in works
alone, and not anything in the truths of doctrine; to whom, because they
omit or lightly esteem truths of doctrine which yet are necessary, it is
said in what follows: Repent, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and
will fight with them with the sword of My mouth (Rev. 2:16).

<span class="margnote"><span id="109.">109.</span></span>

Verse 13. I know thy works; that this signifies that the Lord sees all
their interiors and exteriors at once, may be seen above (n. 76), where
the same is explained; here that the Lord sees that they are in works
alone, and not in doctrinals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="110.">110.</span></span>

And where thou dwellest, where Satan's throne is, signifies their life
in thick darkness. That by "Satan" is meant the hell of those who are in
falsities may be seen above (n. 97); and to be in falsities is to be in
spiritual thick darkness. "Spiritual thick darkness," "the shadow of
death," and "darkness" are nothing else but the states of those in hell,
who are in the falsities of evil; therefore, in the Word, falsities are
described by them; from which it may appear, that by "Satan's throne" is
signified mere thick darkness. But by thick darkness here is not meant
that they are in mere falsities, but that they are in no truths of
doctrine; for truths of the doctrine, which are from the Word, are in
light, therefore not to be in truths is not to be in light, consequently
to be in thick darkness. That truths are in the light of heaven, may be
seen in Heaven and Hell (n. 126-140); and in Doctrine of the New
Jerusalem concerning Sacred Scripture (n. 73, 104-113). \[2\] The Word
in many places treats of those who are in "darkness," in "the shadow of
death," and in "thick darkness," whose eyes the Lord will open; and by
them are meant the Gentiles, who were in good works, but not in any
truths, because they did not know the Lord, nor did they have the Word.
Exactly similar to these are they in the Christian world, who are in
works alone and in no truths of doctrine, therefore they cannot be
called anything else than Gentiles; they know the Lord indeed, but yet
do not approach Him, and they have the Word, but yet do not search for
the truths therein. By "I know where thou dwellest" is signified to know
their quality, because in the spiritual world everyone dwells according
to the quality of his affection. Hence it may appear, that by "thou
dwellest where Satan's throne is" is signified the life of their good in
thick darkness. \[3\] Satanic spirits also have power through those in
the spiritual world who are in works alone, but without them they have
none; for they adjoin them to themselves, provided one of them says, I
am thy neighbor, and on this account good offices ought to be extended
to me; on hearing this they approach, and give aid; nor do they inquire
who and what he is, because they do not have truths, by which alone one
can be distinguished from another. This also is signified by "thou
dwellest where satan's throne is."

<span class="margnote"><span id="111.">111.</span></span>

And thou holdest fast My name, and hast not denied My faith, signifies
when yet they have religion and worship according to it, and also
acknowledge the Word to be the Divine truth. That by the "name" of
Jehovah, or of the Lord is meant all by which He is worshiped, thus the
all of religion, may be seen above (n. 81); here therefore it signifies
that they have religion, and, according to religion, worship. By
"faith," here is not meant that which exists in the church at this day,
but the Divine truth, because faith is of truth and truth is of faith;
nothing else is meant by "faith" in heaven, nor by the "faith of God" in
the Word; hence it is that faith and truth are expressed in the Hebrew
language by one and the same word, and are called Amuna. Since then by
"the faith of God" is meant the Divine truth, and the Word is Divine
truth itself, it is evident that by "thou hast not denied My faith," is
meant, that they acknowledge that the Word is the Divine truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="112.">112.</span></span>

Even in those days wherein Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain
among you where Satan dwelleth, signifies when all truth was
extinguished by falsities in the church. By "martyr" is signified
confession of the truth, the same as by "a witness" (above, n. 6, 16),
because "martyr" and "witness" are expressed in the Greek language by
one expression. "Antipas" is named from the spiritual or angelic
language. Since by "Antipas the martyr" is signified a confessor of the
truth, and, abstractly, the truth itself, it is evident that, by "in the
days wherein Antipas was My faithful martyr, who was slain among you,
where Satan dwelleth," is signified, when truth was extinguished by
falsities in the church. That by "Satan" is meant the hell where and
from whence falsities are, may be seen above (n. 97).

<span class="margnote"><span id="113.">113.</span></span>

Verse 14. But I have a few things against thee, signifies that the
things which follow are against them, as is evident without explanation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="114.">114.</span></span>

Because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who
taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat
idol-sacrifices, and to commit whoredom, signifies that there are some
among them who do hypocritical works, by which the worship of God in the
church is defiled and adulterated. That by these things are meant they
who do works by which worship is defiled and adulterated, is evident
from the historical parts of the Word concerning Balaam and Balak king
of Moab. For Balaam was a hypocrite, and a diviner; for he spoke well of
the sons of Israel from Jehovah, when yet he cherished in his heart a
desire to destroy them, and also he did destroy them by the counsel he
gave Balak; from which it was evident that his works were hypocritical.
That he was a diviner we read in Num. 22:7; 24:1; Josh. 13:22. That he
spoke in favor of the children of Israel, by blessing them (see Num.
23:7-15, 18-24; 24:5-9, 16-19). But that he spoke these things from
Jehovah (see Num. 23:5, 12, 16; 24:13). That he cherished in his heart a
desire to destroy them, and also did destroy them by the counsel given
to Balak (see Num. 31:16). The counsel which he gave is in Num. 25:1, 9,
18. This was the stumbling block which he cast before the sons of
Israel, concerning which it is thus written: In Shittim the people began
to commit whoredom with the daughters of Moab, and they called the
people unto the sacrifices of their gods; the people did eat and bowed
themselves down to their gods, especially they adjoined themselves unto
Baalpeor: therefore there were slain of Israel twenty-four thousand
(Num. 25:1-3, 9, 18). By "the sons of Israel" is signified the church;
by eating of their sacrifices, is signified the appropriation of what is
holy; therefore by eating of the sacrifices of other gods, or
idol-sacrifices, is signified the defilement and profanation of what is
holy; by "committing whoredom," is signified to adulterate and pervert
worship; that by "Moab," and therefore by its king, and its daughters,
are also signified they who defile and adulterate worship, may be seen
in The Arcana Coelestia, published at London (n. 2468). From hence it is
evident, that this is the spiritual sense of these words.

<span class="margnote"><span id="115.">115.</span></span>

Verse 15. So thou hast, even thou, them that hold the doctrine of the
Nicolaitans, which I hate, signifies that there are some among them also
who make works meritorious. That the "works of the Nicolaitans" are
meritorious works, may be seen above (n. 86). Among those who place the
all of the church and of salvation in good works, and not anything in
truths of doctrine, who are those who are meant by "the church in
Pergamos," there are some who do hypocritical works and also meritorious
works, but still not all; therefore it is said, "Thou hast there them
that hold the doctrine of Balaam;" as also, "So thou hast, even thou,
them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans;" and all works of
worship are either good, or meritorious, or hypocritical, therefore the
two latter are here spoken of, and good works afterwards in what
follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="116.">116.</span></span>

Verse 16. Repent, signifies that they should guard themselves against
such works, and do works which are good. That these things are signified
by "repent," is, because it now treats of meritorious and hypocritical
goods, against which they should guard themselves who place the all of
the church and of salvation in good works, and not anything in the
truths of doctrine; when yet the truths of doctrine teach how and what
is to be willed and thought, or loved and believed, that the works may
be good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="117.">117.</span></span>

Or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight with them with the
sword of my mouth, signifies, if not, that the Lord will contend with
them from the Word, and convince them that their works are evil. But the
explanation of these words may be seen above (n. 108).

<span class="margnote"><span id="118.">118.</span></span>

Verse 17. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
the churches, signifies that he who understands these things, ought to
obey what the Divine truth of the Word teaches those who will be of the
New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, as appears above (n. 87), where
similar words are explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="119.">119.</span></span>

To him that overcometh, signifies he that fights against his evils and
falsities and is reformed, as is also evident from the explanation given
above (n. 88).

<span class="margnote"><span id="120.">120.</span></span>

I will give to eat of the hidden manna, signifies wisdom, and at the
same time the appropriation of the good of celestial love in works, and
thus conjunction of the Lord with those who work. By "the hidden manna,"
which they will have who are in good works, and who at the same time
adjoin the truths of doctrine to works, is meant hidden wisdom of a
quality like that which they have who are in the third heaven. For
these, because they were in good works, and at the same time in truths
of doctrine in the world, are in wisdom above other angels, but in
hidden wisdom, for it is written in their life and not so much on their
memory; therefore they are of such a nature that they do not talk of the
truths of doctrine, but do them, and they do them because they know
them, and also see them when others speak them. That the good of love is
appropriated to them, and the Lord conjoins Himself with those who
adjoin truths of doctrine to good works, and thus gives them wisdom in
their good, and that this is "giving to eat of the hidden manna," may
appear from these words of the Lord: The bread of God is He which cometh
down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world. I am the bread of
life; your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead. This is
the bread which cometh down from heaven, that he who eateth thereof may
not die. I am the living bread, that came down from heaven; if anyone
eat of this bread he shall live forever (John 6:31-51). From which it is
evident, that the Lord Himself is "the hidden manna" which will be in
their works, if they approach Him alone. Whether you say "the Lord" or
"the good of celestial love," and "the wisdom of that love," it is the
same. But this is an arcanum which enters with difficulty into the
natural idea of anyone, so long as it is veiled over with a cloud from
worldly things; but it does enter when the mind is serene and in the
sunshine, as may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine
Love and Wisdom from beginning to end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="121.">121.</span></span>

And I will give him a white stone, signifies truths favoring and united
to good. "A white stone" signifies this because in judgments votes were
collected by stones, and by white stones those which were affirmative;
that it is affirmative truths which are signified is, because "white" is
predicated of truths (n. 167, 379); hence it is, that by a "white stone"
are signified truths favoring good; the reason why they are also united
to good, is, because good invites and unites them to itself; for all
good loves truth and conjoins to itself such as agrees with itself,
especially the good of celestial love; this so unites truths to itself,
that they altogether make a one. Hence it is, that they see truths from
good alone. These are meant by "those who have the law written in their
hearts," of whom it is said in Jeremiah: I will put My law in the midst
of them, and I will write it on their heart; neither shall they teach
any longer everyone his neighbor, and everyone his brother, saying, Know
ye Jehovah, for all shall know Me (Jer. 31:33-34). Such are all who are
in the third heaven. They do not speak of truths from any memory, but
clearly see them when they hear others speaking of them, especially when
they are reading the Word; the reason is, because they are in the very
marriage of good and truth. Such do they become in the world, who have
approached the Lord alone, and have done good works, because they are
according to the truths of the Word; concerning whom something may be
seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 25-26, 270-271).

<span class="margnote"><span id="122.">122.</span></span>

And in the stone a new name written, signifies that thus they will have
good of a quality such as they had not before. That "name" signifies the
quality of a thing, may be seen above (n. 81), therefore here the
quality of good. All the quality of good is from the truths that are
united to it; for good without truths is like bread and food without
wine and water, which do not nourish; and also like fruit in which there
is no juice. It appears also like trees stripped of the leaves, on which
there hang a few dry apples left from the autumn. This is also meant by
these words of the Lord: For everyone shall be salted with fire, and
every sacrifice shall be salted with salt. Salt is good, but if the salt
has lost its saltiness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in
yourselves (Mark 9:49-50). Salt here is the desire of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="123.">123.</span></span>

Which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it, signifies that it does
not appear to anyone, because it is inscribed on their life. That truths
united to good are not inscribed on their memories, but on their lives,
may be seen above (n. 121, 122), and what is inscribed on the life
alone, and not on the memory, does not appear to anyone, not even to
themselves, except from this, that they perceive whether it is true, and
what is true, when they hear and read; for the interiors of their mind
are open even unto the Lord; and because the Lord is in them, and He
sees all things, therefore He causes them to see as from themselves; but
yet from their wisdom they know that they do not see truths from
themselves, but from the Lord. Hence, it may appear what is meant by all
this, "I will give him to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a
white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth
but he that receiveth it:" the sum of its signification is, that they
will be angels of the third heaven, if they read the Word, draw
therefrom truths of doctrine, and approach the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="124.">124.</span></span>

Verse 18. And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write, signifies,
to those and concerning those, who are in faith from charity, and thence
in good works; and also to those and concerning those, who are in faith
separate from charity, and thence in evil works. That both the former
and latter are described by "the church in Thyatira," is evident from
what is written to it, when understood in the spiritual sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="125.">125.</span></span>

These things saith the Son of God, who hath His eyes like unto a flame
of fire, signifies the Lord as to the Divine wisdom of His Divine love.
That this is the signification, may be seen explained above (n. 48).

<span class="margnote"><span id="126.">126.</span></span>

And His feet like fine brass, signifies the Divine good natural, as is
evident from the explanation given above (n. 49).

<span class="margnote"><span id="127.">127.</span></span>

Verse 19. I know thy works, signifies that the Lord sees all their
interiors and exteriors at once, as may be seen above, where these words
are explained (n. 76).

<span class="margnote"><span id="128.">128.</span></span>

And charity and ministry, signifies the spiritual affection which is
called charity, and its operation. Charity is a spiritual affection,
because charity is love towards the neighbor, and love towards the
neighbor is that affection: that "ministry" is its operation, follows
from their being called "ministers" in the Word who do the things which
are of charity. The man who is a worshiper of God is sometimes called "a
servant," and sometimes a "minister," and he is called "a servant of
God" who is in truths, and "a minister of God" who is in goods; the
reason is, because truth serves good, and good ministers to truth. That
he is called "a servant" who is in truths, may be seen above (n. 3); but
that he is called "a minister" who is in good, is evident from these
passages: Ye shall be called the priests of Jehovah, the ministers of
our <span id="fr_11"></span>[128-1](#fn_11) God (Isa. 61:6.md). My covenant
shall not be broken with the Levites My ministers (Jer. 33:21). They are
called "ministers," because priests represented the Lord as to Divine
good. Bless Jehovah all His hosts, ye ministers of His that do His will
(Ps. 103:21-22). Jehovah maketh His angels spirits; His ministers a
flaming fire (Ps. 104:4). "Angels spirits" are they who are in truths,
and "angels ministers" they who are in goods; "flaming fire" also
signifies the good of love. Jesus said: Whosoever will be great, let him
be your minister; and whosoever will be first, let him be your servant
(Matt. 20:26-27; 23:11-12). "Minister" is here predicated of good, and
"servant" of truth. The same is signified by "ministering" and
"ministry" in Isaiah 61:6; John 12:26; Luke 12:37; and in other places.
Hence it is evident, that by "charity" and "ministry," is signified
spiritual affection and its operation; for good is of charity, and truth
is of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="129.">129.</span></span>

And thy faith and endurance, signifies truth, and the study to procure
and teach it. That "faith" signifies truth, may be seen above (n. 111);
and that in such case endurance signifies study and labor of procuring
and teaching it, follows as a consequence. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[129-1](#fn_12.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="130.">130.</span></span>

And the last to be more than the first, signifies the increase thereof
from the spiritual affection of truth, which is charity. By "the last
works more than the first," are meant all things of their charity and
faith, for these are the interior things from which are works (n. 73,
76, 94). These things increase when charity is in the first place and
faith in the second; for charity is the spiritual affection of doing
good, and from it comes the spiritual affection of knowing truth, for
good loves truth as food does drink, for it desires to be nourished, and
is nourished, by truths; hence it is, that they who are in genuine
charity have a continual increase of truth. This then is what is
signified by "I know thy works the last more than the first."

<span class="margnote"><span id="131.">131.</span></span>

Verse 20. But I have a few things against thee, signifies that the
following things may possibly be a stumblingblock to them. For what now
follows relates to faith separated from charity, which may be a
stumblingblock to those who are in faith from charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="132.">132.</span></span>

That thou permittest the woman Jezebel, signifies that among them there
are some in the church who separate faith from charity, and make faith
alone saving. That faith separated from charity is meant by "the woman
Jezebel" is evident from the things which now follow, when they are
unfolded in series by means of the spiritual sense and when they are
compared with that faith; for these were the evil deeds of Jezebel the
wife of Ahab: That she went and served Baal, and built him an altar in
Samaria, and made a grove (1 Kings 16:31-33). That she slew the prophets
of Jehovah (1 Kings 18:4, 13). That she wished to kill Elijah (1 Kings
19:1-2). That through deceit by substituting false witnesses, she took
away the vineyard from Naboth, and killed him (1 Kings 21:6-7 seq.).
That on account of these evil deeds, it was foretold to her by Elijah,
that the dogs should eat her (1 Kings 21:23). That she was thrown down
from the window where she stood painted, and that some of her blood was
sprinkled upon the wall, and upon the horses which trampled her (2 Kings
9:30-33). \[2\] As all the historical as well as the prophetical parts
of the Word signify the spiritual things of the church, so also do
these; and they signify faith separated from charity is evident from the
spiritual sense, and from collating them together; for by "going and
serving Baal" and "building him an altar" and "making a grove" is
signified to serve lusts of all kinds, or what is the same, the devil,
not thinking of any evil lust, nor of any sin, as they do who have no
doctrine of charity and life, but of faith only. By "slaying the
prophets" is signified to destroy the truths of doctrine from the Word.
By "wishing to kill Elijah" is signified to wish to do the same to the
Word itself. By "taking away the vineyard from Naboth and killing him"
is signified the church, for "the vineyard" is the church: by "the dogs"
which ate her, are signified lusts. By "casting from the window,
sprinkling the blood on the wall, and being trampled by the horses" is
signified their destruction, for the particulars signify that also;
"window" signifies truth in the light; "blood" falsity; "wall" truth in
ultimates, "horse" the understanding of the Word. Hence it may be
concluded, that these things, collated together, coincide with faith
separated from charity, as may further appear from what follows in
Revelation, where this faith is treated of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="133.">133.</span></span>

Who calleth herself a prophetess, signifies and who make it the very
doctrine of the church, and found all theology upon it. That by
"prophet" in the Word is signified the doctrine of the church, may be
seen above (n. 8); therefore the like is signified by "prophetess." It
is known that in the Reformed Christian church faith alone has been
accepted as the only means of salvation, and that thence the works of
charity have been separated from faith, as not saving; hence it is that
the entire doctrine of the salvation of man, which is called theology,
at this day is that faith, consequently "the woman Jezebel."

<span class="margnote"><span id="134.">134.</span></span>

To teach and to seduce My servants to commit whoredom, signifies, from
which it comes to pass that the truths of the Word are falsified. By "to
teach and to seduce the servants of the Lord," is meant those who are
able and willing to be instructed in truths from the Word; that they are
called "servants of the Lord" who are in truths, may be seen above (n.
3, 128); and by "committing whoredom," is signified to adulterate and
falsify the Word: that this is signified by "committing whoredom," is,
because in every particular of the Word there is the marriage of good
and truth, and this marriage is broken when good is separated and taken
away from truth. That in every particular of the Word there is the
marriage of the Lord and the church, and thence the marriage of good and
truth, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the
Sacred Scripture (n. 80-90). From this it is, that "to commit whoredom"
signifies to adulterate the goods and falsify the truths of the Word;
and because this is spiritual whoredom, therefore also they who from
their own reason have falsified the Word, after death, when they come
into the spiritual world, become whoremongers: and, what has hitherto
been concealed from the world, they who have confirmed themselves in
faith alone to the exclusion of works of charity, are in the lust of
committing the adultery of a son with his mother. That they are in the
lust of committing so abominable a kind of adultery, has often been
perceived in the spiritual world. Remember this, and inquire after
death, and you will be confirmed. \[2\] I have not ventured to reveal
this before, because it offends the ears. This adultery is signified by
the adultery of Reuben with Bilhah his father's concubine (Gen. 35:22);
for by "Reuben" that faith is signified, for which cause he was cursed
by his father Israel, and afterwards his birthright was taken away from
him; for his father Israel, prophesying concerning his sons, said of
Reuben: Reuben my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of
my power, light as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up
to thy father's bed; then thou didst profane it: he went up to my couch
(Gen. 49:3-4). Therefore his birthright was taken from him. Reuben was
the firstborn of Israel; but because he polluted his father's couch, his
birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph (1 Chron. 5:1). That by
"Reuben" was represented truth from good, or faith from charity, and
afterwards truth separated from good, or faith separated from charity,
will be seen in the explanation of chapter 7:5. \[3\] That by
"whoredoms" are signified adulterations of good and falsifications of
truth in the Word, may appear from the following passages: When Joram
saw Jehu, he said, Is it peace, Jehu? Who said, What peace, so long as
the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel, and her incantations are so many?
(2 Kings 9:22). By "the whoredoms of Jezebel" are not meant any
whoredoms, but her deeds, of which above (n. 132). Your sons shall be
pasturing in the wilderness forty <span
id="fr_13"></span>[134-1](#fn_13.md) years, and they shall bear your <span
id="fr_14"></span>[134-2](#fn_14) whoredoms (Num. 14:33.md). And I will cut
off the soul that looketh back to pythons and soothsayers to go a
whoring after them (Lev. 20:6). Lest thou make a covenant with the
inhabitants of the land, and they go a whoring after their gods (Exod.
34:15-16). Jerusalem, thou didst trust in thy beauty, and didst commit
whoredom on account of thy fame, even so that thou didst pour out thy
whoredoms on everyone that passed by. Thou didst commit whoredom with
the sons of Egypt, thy neighbors, great of flesh, and didst multiply thy
whoredom. Thou didst commit whoredom with the sons of Assyria even when
there was no satiety to thee with whom thou didst commit whoredom. Thou
hast multiplied thy whoredom even to Chaldea. A woman, an adulteress,
that taketh strangers instead of her husband. All give reward to their
harlots; but thou hast given rewards to all, that they may come unto
thee on every side in thy whoredoms. Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word
of Jehovah (Ezek. 16:15-16, 26, 28-29, 32-33, 35 seq.). "Jerusalem" in
this passage is the Israelitish and Jewish church; by her "whoredoms"
are meant adulterations and falsifications of the Word; and because in
the Word by "Egypt" is signified the science of the natural man, by
"Assyria" ratiocination thence, by "Chaldea" profanation of truth, and
by "Babylon" profanation of good, therefore it is said that she
committed whoredom with them. \[4\] There were two women, the daughters
of one mother; they committed whoredom in Egypt; they committed whoredom
in their youth; one committed whoredom under Me, and she doted on her
lovers, the Assyrians her neighbors. Thus she gave her whoredoms with
them; yet she did not abandon her whoredoms in Egypt. The other
corrupted her love more than she, and her whoredoms more than the
whoredoms of her sister. She added to her whoredoms, she loved the
Chaldeans. The sons of Babel came to her to the bed of loves, and they
polluted her by their whoredoms (Ezek. 23:2-3, 5, 7-8, 11, 14, 16-17
seq.). Here "the two daughters of one mother" are likewise the
Israelitish and Jewish church, whose adulterations and falsifications of
the Word are here described as above by "whoredoms." \[5\] So in the
following passages: Thou hast committed whoredom with many companions;
thou hast profaned the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? going up upon
every high mountain, and committing whoredom. Also perfidious Judah went
and committed whoredom. So that by the voice of her whoredom, she hath
profaned the land; she hath committed adultery with stone and wood (Jer.
3:1-2, 6, 8-9; and in other places). Run ye to and fro through the
streets of Jerusalem, seek if you can find a man, who doeth judgment,
and seeketh the truth. When I had satiated them, they committed whoredom
and came into the harlot's house in a crowd (Jer. 5:1, 7). I have seen
thy adulteries, thy neighings, the crime of thy whoredoms, thy
abominations on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem, wilt
thou not be made clean? (Jer. 13:27). I have seen also in the prophets
of Jerusalem a horrible stubbornness, in committing adultery and walking
in lies (Jer. 23:14). They have committed foolishness in Israel, they
committed whoredom and spoke My word in My name with lying (Jer. 29:23).
They sinned against Me, I will turn their glory into reproach; they
committed whoredom, because they have forsaken Jehovah. Whoredom
occupied their heart. Your daughters commit whoredom, and your
daughters-in-law commit adultery (Hos. 4:7, 10-11, 13). I know, Ephraim,
that he hath altogether committed whoredom, and Israel is polluted (Hos.
5:3). I have seen a foul thing in the house of Israel; there Ephraim
committeth whoredom; Israel is polluted (Hos. 6:10). "Israel" here is
the church, and "Ephraim" is the understanding of the Word, from which,
and according to which, the church is; therefore it is said "Ephraim
hath committed whoredom, and Israel is polluted." \[6\] Because the
church had falsified the Word, the prophet Hosea was commanded to take
unto himself a harlot to wife, saying: Take unto thee a woman of
whoredoms, and children of whoredoms; for the land, by committing
whoredom, hath committed whoredom against Jehovah (Hos. 1:2). Again:
Love a woman beloved of her companion, and an adulteress (Hos. 3:1). As
the Jewish church was such, therefore the Jewish nation was called by
the Lord "an adulterous generation" (Matt. 12:39; 16:4; Mark 8:38); and
in Isaiah, "a seed of adulterers" (57:3); and in Nahum: Woe to the city
of bloods, wholly in a lie, a multitude of those pierced, above the
multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot, that selleth nations by her
whoredoms (Nahum 3:1, 3-4). \[7\] Since "Babylon" adulterates and
falsifies the Word more than others in the Christian world, she is
therefore called "the great harlot," and the following is said of her in
Revelation: Babylon hath made all nations to drink of the wine of the
anger of her whoredom (Rev. 14:8). For all nations have drunk of the
wine of the wrath of her whoredom, and the kings of the earth have
committed whoredom with her (Rev. 18:3). The angel said, I will show
unto thee the judgment of the great harlot, with whom the kings of the
earth have committed whoredom (Rev. 17:1-2). He hath judged the great
harlot, which did corrupt the earth with her whoredom (Rev. 19:2). From
these passages it manifestly appears, that "to commit adultery" and "to
commit whoredom" signify to adulterate and falsify the goods and truths
of the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="135.">135.</span></span>

And to eat idol-sacrifices, signifies the defilement of worship thence,
and profanations, as is clear from the explanation given above (n. 114);
for they who adulterate goods appropriate to themselves unclean things,
by which they defile and profane worship.

<span class="margnote"><span id="136.">136.</span></span>

Verse 21. And I gave her time to repent of her whoredom, and she
repented not, signifies that they who have confirmed themselves in that
doctrine, will not recede, although they see things contrary to it in
the Word. By receding from whoredom, is here signified to recede from
falsifying the Word. That they see things contrary to their doctrine, is
evident from a thousand passages in the Word, where it is said that
evils are to be shunned, and that goods are to be done; also that they
who do goods come into heaven, and they who do evils into hell, as also
that faith without works is dead and diabolical. But it may be asked,
what part of the Word have they falsified, or where have they
spiritually committed whoredom with the Word? It may be answered, that
they have falsified the whole Word; for the whole Word is nothing else
but the doctrine of love to the Lord, and of love towards the neighbor,
for the Lord says, that on the commandments concerning those two loves
hang all the law and the prophets (Matt. 22:40). There is also in the
Word the doctrine of faith, yet not of such faith, but of the faith of
love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="137.">137.</span></span>

Verse 22. Behold I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
adultery with her into great affliction, signifies that thus they will
be left in their doctrine with the falsifications, and that they will be
grievously infested by falsities. That by "bed" is signified doctrine,
will be seen presently; that by "committing adultery" falsifications of
truth are signified, may be seen above (n. 134, 136); and that by
"affliction" is signified infestation from falsities (n. 33, 95, 101);
and hence by "great affliction" is signified grievous infestation. That
"a bed" signifies doctrine is from correspondence, for as the body rests
in its bed, so does the mind rest in its doctrine. But by "bed" is
signified the doctrine which everyone acquires to himself either from
the Word, or from his own intelligence, for therein the mind rests and,
as it were, sleeps. The beds in which they lie in the spiritual world,
are from no other origin; for there everyone's bed is according to the
quality of his science and intelligence, magnificent for the wise, mean
for the unwise, and filthy for falsifiers. \[2\] This is signified by "a
bed" in Luke: I say unto you, in that night there shall be two in one
bed; the one shall be taken and the other left (Luke 17:34). This is
concerning the Last Judgment; "two in one bed" means two in one
doctrine, but not in similar life. In John: Jesus saith unto the sick
man, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk; and he took up his bed, and walked
(John 5:8-9); and in Mark: Jesus said unto the palsied, Son, thy sins be
forgiven thee; and He said unto the Scribes, Whether is it easier to
say, thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, take up thy bed, and walk?
then He said, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk; and he took up the bed,
and went forth from them (Mark 2:5, 9, 11-12). That here something is
signified by "bed" is evident, because Jesus said, "Whether is it easier
to say, thy sins be forgiven thee, or to say, take up thy bed and walk?"
By "carrying his bed and walking" is signified to meditate in doctrine;
it is so understood in heaven. \[3\] Doctrine is also signified by "bed"
in Amos: As the shepherd rescueth from the mouth of the lion, so shall
the sons of Israel be rescued that dwell in Samaria, in the corner of a
bed, and in the extremity of a couch (Amos 3:12). "In the corner of a
bed" and "in the extremity of a couch" means what is more remote from
the truths and goods of doctrine. "Bed" and "couch" and "bed chamber"
have a similar signification in other places (as in Isa. 28:20; 57:2,
7-8; Ezek. 23:41; Amos 6:4; Micah 2:1; Ps. 4:4; Ps. 36:4; Ps. 41:3; Job
7:13; Lev. 15:4-5). Since by "Jacob" in the Propheticals of the Word is
signified the church as to doctrine, therefore it is said of him, that:
He bowed himself upon the head of the bed (Gen. 47:31). That when Joseph
came, he sat upon the bed (Gen. 48:2). That he gathered up his feet upon
the bed, and expired (Gen. 49:33). The doctrine of the church is
signified by "Jacob" therefore sometimes when I have thought of Jacob,
there has appeared to me above, in front, a man lying in a bed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="138.">138.</span></span>

Except they repent of their works, signifies if they will not desist
from separating faith from charity, and from falsifying the Word, as may
appear without further explanation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="139.">139.</span></span>

Verse 23. And I will kill her sons with death, signifies that all the
truths of the Word with them will be turned into falsities. By "sons" in
the Word, are signified truths, and in the opposite sense, falsities;
therefore "to kill sons" signifies to turn truths into falsities, for
thus they perish; neither is anything else meant by "the slain and
pierced of Jehovah;" by "killing her sons with death" is also signified
to condemn their falsities. That "sons" signify truths, and in the
opposite sense falsities is because in the spiritual sense of the Word
by generations, are meant spiritual generations, and in like manner by
consanguinities and affinities; thus by their names, as by father,
mother, sons, daughters, brethren, sisters, sons-in-law,
daughters-in-law, and the rest; neither does spiritual generation give
birth to any other sons and daughters, than truths and goods. See (n.
542, 543), below.

<span class="margnote"><span id="140.">140.</span></span>

And all the churches shall know that I am He which searcheth the reins
and hearts, signifies that the church shall know that the Lord sees the
quality of everyone's truth and the quality of everyone's good. By "the
seven churches" is signified the whole church, as before; and by
"searching the reins and hearts," is signified to see all the things
which a man believes and loves, thus the quality of his truth and of his
good. That this is the signification of "searching the reins and
hearts," is from correspondence, for the Word in its literal sense
consists of mere correspondences. The correspondence is from this, that
as the reins purify the blood from the impurities which are called
urinous, and the heart purifies the blood from the unclean things which
are called foul, so the truth of faith purifies man from falsities, and
the good of love from evils. \[2\] Thence it is that the ancients placed
love and its affections in the heart, and intelligence and its
perceptions in the reins; as may appear from these passages in the Word:
Behold, thou desirest truth in the reins, and in the hidden part thou
makest wisdom known to me (Ps. 51:6). Thou possessest my reins, my bone
was not hid from thee when I was made in secret (Ps. 139:13, 15). My
heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins, but I am stupid, I do
not know (Ps. 73:21-22). I Jehovah search the heart, and try the reins,
even to give everyone according to his ways (Jer. 17:10). Thou art near
in their mouth, and far from their reins; Thou, O Jehovah, wilt see me,
and try my heart (Jer. 12:2-3). Jehovah is a judge of justice, trying
the reins and the heart (Jer. 11:20; 20:12). Confirm the just, for it is
the just God who trieth the hearts and reins (Ps. 7:9). Prove me, O
Jehovah, and try me, explore my reins and my heart (Ps. 26:2). By
"reins" in these places are signified truths of intelligence and faith,
and by "heart," the good of love and charity. That "heart" signifies the
love and its affections, may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning
the Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 371-393).

<span class="margnote"><span id="141.">141.</span></span>

And I will give unto everyone according to his works, signifies that He
gives unto everyone according to the charity and its faith which are in
his works. That "works" are the containers of charity and faith, and
that charity and faith without works are only like airy images, which
vanish as soon as they have appeared, may be seen above (n. 76).

<span class="margnote"><span id="142.">142.</span></span>

Verse 24. But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
have not this doctrine, signifies both to those with whom the doctrine
of faith is separated from charity, and to those with whom the doctrine
of faith is joined with charity, is evident from what is said above,
without further explanation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="143.">143.</span></span>

And who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak, signifies
they who do not understand their interiors, which are mere falsities.
That by "Satan" is meant the hell of those who are in falsities, and
abstractly, falsities, may be seen above (n. 97); therefore by its
"depths" are signified the interiors of the doctrine separated from
charity, which are mere falsities. The depths and interiors of that
doctrine are what are delivered in their books and lectures in the
universities, and thence in their preachings, the nature of which is
pointed out in what is prefixed to the first chapter, where their
doctrines are quoted; and particularly in what is there adduced
concerning Justification by Faith and concerning Good Works; where it
may be seen stated that the clergy alone know the arcana of that
doctrine, but not the laity, therefore the latter principally are meant
by those "who have not known the depths of Satan."

<span class="margnote"><span id="144.">144.</span></span>

I will put upon you none other burden, signifies, only that they should
beware of them. The reason is, because they confirm their falsities by
reasonings from the natural man, and by some things from the Word which
they falsify, for by these they can seduce. They are like serpents in
the grass which bite those that pass by; or like concealed poisons which
kill the unwary.

<span class="margnote"><span id="145.">145.</span></span>

Verse 25. Nevertheless, that which ye have, hold fast till I come,
signifies that they should retain the few things which they know from
charity and faith, thence from the Word, and live according to them,
until the New Heaven and the New Church are formed, which are the Lord's
coming. For these and no others receive the things which the doctrine of
the New Jerusalem teaches concerning the Lord and charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="146.">146.</span></span>

Verse 26. And he that overcometh and keepeth My works unto the end,
signifies those who fight against evils and falsities and are reformed,
and are actually in charity, and thence faith, and remain in them to the
end of life. That "to overcome" is to fight against evils and falsities,
may be seen above (n. 88); and that "works" are charity and thence faith
in act (n. 76, 141); that "to keep them unto the end," is to be in them,
and remain in them to the end of life, is evident.

<span class="margnote"><span id="147.">147.</span></span>

To him will I give power over the nations, signifies that they shall
overcome evils in themselves which are from hell. That by "nations" in
the Word are meant those who are in good, and in the opposite sense,
those who are in evil, thus, abstractly, goods and evils, may be seen
below (n. 483); therefore here by "giving power over the nations," is
signified to give them to overcome the evils from hell in themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="148.">148.</span></span>

Verse 27. And He shall rule them with a rod of iron, signifies by truths
from the literal sense of the Word, and at the same time by rational
things from natural light. These things are signified by "a rod or staff
of iron" because "a rod or staff" in the Word signifies power, and
"iron" signifies natural truth, consequently the natural sense of the
Word, and at the same time the natural light of man; in these two
consists the power of truth. That Divine truth in the natural sense of
the Word, which is the sense of its letter is in its power, may be seen
in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n.
37-49); from this cause the literal sense is the basis, container, and
support of its spiritual sense (n. 27-36). And that all power is in the
ultimates which are called things natural, may be seen in Angelic Wisdom
concerning Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 205-221); consequently in the
natural sense of the letter of the Word, and in the natural light of
man. These, therefore, are "the rod of iron" by which He shall "rule the
nations" that is, overcome the evils which are from hell. The like is
signified by a "rod of iron" in these passages: Thou shalt break the
nations in pieces with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces
like a potter's vessel (Ps. 2:9). The woman brought forth a male who was
to rule all nations with a rod of iron (Rev. 12:5). Out of the mouth of
Him that sat upon the white horse went a sharp sword, that with it He
should smite the nations; but He shall rule them with a rod of iron
(Rev. 19:15). Jehovah shall smite the wicked with the rod of His mouth
(Isa. 11:4).

<span class="margnote"><span id="149.">149.</span></span>

As the vessels of a potter shall they be broken in pieces, signifies, as
of little or no account. It is said "the vessels of a potter" because by
them are signified the things which are of one's own intelligence, which
are all falsities, and in themselves of no account; so in David: Thou
shall break the nations in pieces with a rod of iron, Thou shalt dash
them in pieces like a potter's vessel (Ps. 2:9).

<span class="margnote"><span id="150.">150.</span></span>

Even as I have received from My Father, signifies that they have this
from the Lord, who, when He was in the world procured to Himself all
power over the hells, from His Divine which was in Himself. That the
Lord, when He was in the world, by admitting temptations into Himself,
and finally by the last of them, which was the passion of the cross,
subjugated the hells and glorified His Human, may be seen in Doctrine of
the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 29-36); as also above (n. 67);
from which it may appear, that "to receive from His Father" is to
receive from the Divine which was in Him, for He said that "the Father
is in Him and He in the Father"; that "the Father and He are one"; as
also "the Father who is in Me"; and more.
