### Apocalypse Revealed

<span class="margnote"><span id="201.">201.</span></span>

Verse 15. I know thy works, signifies that the Lord sees all their
interiors and exteriors at once, as above (n. 76).

<span class="margnote"><span id="202.">202.</span></span>

That thou art neither cold nor hot, signifies that they who are such,
sometimes deny that the Word is Divine and holy, and at other times
acknowledge it. At one time to deny the holiness of the Word, and at
another time to acknowledge it, is "to be neither cold nor hot," for
they are against the Word and also for the Word. They are also such
concerning God, at one time they deny, and at another time acknowledge
Him; in like manner as to all things of the church; for which reason
they are sometimes with those who are in hell, and at other times with
those who are in heaven. They fly as it were between both, up and down,
and wherever they fly, thither they turn the face. They become such who
have confirmed with themselves the belief in the existence of God, of
heaven and hell, and of life eternal, and afterwards recede from it.
When the first confirmation returns, they acknowledge, but when it does
not return, they deny. They recede because they afterwards think only of
themselves and the world, continually aspiring to preeminence, and
thereby they immerse themselves in their proprium; thus hell swallows
them up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="203.">203.</span></span>

I would thou wert cold or hot, signifies that it is better for them
either from the heart to deny the holy things of the Word and of the
church, or from the heart to acknowledge them. The reason will be
explained in the next article.

<span class="margnote"><span id="204.">204.</span></span>

Verse 16. Therefore because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot,
I will vomit thee out of My mouth, signifies profanation and consequent
separation from the Lord. "To vomit out of My mouth," signifies to be
separated from the Lord, and to be so separated from the Lord is to be
neither in heaven nor in hell, but in a place apart, deprived of human
life, where there are mere phantasies. The reason is, because they have
mixed truths with falsities, and goods with evils, thus holy things with
profane, even so that they cannot be separated. And since man cannot
then be prepared, either to be in heaven or in hell, the whole of his
rational life is destroyed, and the ultimates of life alone remain,
which, when separated from the interiors of life, are mere phantasies.
Concerning their state and lot more may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom
concerning the Divine Providence (n. 226-228, 231), which will suffice
to give a knowledge of them. It is said of them that "they are vomited
out," because the world of spirits, which is in the midst between heaven
and hell, and into which every man first comes after death, and is there
prepared, corresponds to the stomach, in which all the things put in are
prepared either to become blood and flesh, or to become excrement and
urine, the latter having a correspondence with hell, but the former with
heaven. But the things that are vomited out of the stomach are those
that have not been separated, but remain commixed. By reason of this
correspondence, the expression "to vomit" and "vomit" are used in the
following passages: Drink and be drunken, and let thy foreskin be
uncovered; and the cup of Jehovah shall go around unto thee, and the
shameful vomiting shall be upon the glory (Hab. 2:15-16). Make Moab
drunken, that he may clap the hands in his vomit (Jer. 48:26). All
tables are full of the vomit of emptying; what one shall he teach
knowledge? (Isa. 28:8-9). Besides other places (as Jer. 25:27; Lev.
18:24, 25, 28). That warm water excites vomiting, is also from
correspondence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="206.">206.</span></span>

 <span id="fr_19"></span>[206-1](#fn_19.md) Verse 17. Because thou sayest,
I am rich and increased in goods, signifies that they think they possess
in all abundance the knowledges of truth and good which are of the
church and heaven. "To be rich and increased in goods," here signifies
nothing else than to know and understand fully such things as are of the
church and heaven which are called spiritual and theological, because
these are here treated of; spiritual riches and abundance are nothing
else. They who believe from themselves, and not from the Lord through
the Word, also believe that they know and understand all things. The
reason is, that their spiritual mind is shut, and their natural mind
alone open; and this mind, without spiritual light, sees no otherwise.
That by "riches" and "wealth" in the Word are signified spiritual riches
and wealth, which are the knowledges of truth and good, is manifest from
the following passages: In thy wisdom and in thy understanding thou hast
gotten thee wealth, gold and silver in thy treasures; by the
multiplication of thy wisdom thou hast multiplied thy wealth (Ezek.
28:4-5). This is spoken of Tyre, by which is signified the church as to
the knowledges of truth and good. In like manner: The daughter of Tyre
shall bring thee a gift; O daughter of the king, the rich peoples shall
entreat thy faces (Ps. 45:12). Jehovah will impoverish Tyre; He will
shake off her wealth into the sea (Zech. 9:4). O Tyre, they shall
plunder thy wealth (Ezek. 26:12). Assyria said, By the strength of my
hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, because I am intelligent; whence
I will plunder the treasures of the peoples, my hand shall find the
wealth of the peoples (Isa. 10:13-14). By Assyria the rational is
signified; here that it perverts the goods and truths of the church,
which here are the "treasures and wealth of the peoples," which he will
plunder. I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and the hidden
wealth of the lurking-places (Isa. 45:3). Happy is the man that feareth
Jehovah; wealth and riches are in his house, and his justice standeth
forever (Ps. 112:1, 3). God hath filled the hungry with good things, and
the rich He hath sent away empty (Luke 1:53). Woe unto you that are
rich, for ye have received your joy; woe unto you that are filled, for
ye shall hunger (Luke 6:24-25). By the "rich" here are meant those who
were in possession of the knowledges of truth and good because they had
the Word, who were the Jews: the same is meant by the rich man, who was
clothed in purple and fine linen (Luke 16:19); and in like manner by the
"rich" and "riches" in other places (as in Isa. 30:6; Jer. 17:11; Micah
4:13; 6:12; Zech. 14:14; Matt. 12:35; 13:44; Luke 12:21).

<span class="margnote"><span id="207.">207.</span></span>

And have need of nothing, signifies that they have no need of more
knowledge and wisdom, and from any other source, is evident from what
has been said above, because it is a consequence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="208.">208.</span></span>

And knowest not that thou art wretched, signifies that they do not know
that all they know and think concerning the truths and goods of the
church, do not at all cohere, and are uncemented walls. By "being
wretched" is here signified no coherence, thus by "the wretched," those
who think incoherently concerning the things of the church; the reason
is, because they of whom this is said, at one time deny God, heaven,
eternal life, and the sanctity of the Word, and at another time
acknowledge them; therefore what they build with one hand they destroy
with the other. Thus they are like those that build a house, and
presently pull it down; or that clothe themselves in becoming garments,
and presently tear them off. Their houses are therefore rubbish, and
their garments rags. Such are all things which they think concerning the
church and heaven, but they do not know this. These things are also
meant by "wretchedness" in the following passages: Thy wisdom and thy
knowledge hath seduced thee, when thou saidst in thine heart, I am, and
none besides; therefore shall wretchedness fall upon thee (Isa.
47:10-11). Wretchedness shall come upon wretchedness, the king shall
mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with astonishment (Ezek.
7:26-27). "The king who shall mourn," and "the prince who shall be
clothed with astonishment," are they who are in the truths of the
church. The right is not in their mouth, wretchedness is in the midst of
them (Ps. 5:9). Such also is the signification of "uncemented walls" (in
Jer. 49:3; Ezek. 13:10, 11; Hos. 2:6).

<span class="margnote"><span id="209.">209.</span></span>

And miserable and poor, signifies that they are without truths and
goods. By "miserable and poor," in the spiritual sense of the Word, are
meant they who are without the knowledges of truth and good, for they
are spiritually miserable and poor; the same are meant hereby in the
following passages: I am miserable and poor, O Lord; remember me (Ps.
40:17; 70:5). O Jehovah, incline Thine ear, and answer; for I am
miserable and poor (Ps. 86:1). The wicked draw the sword, and bend their
bow, to cast down the miserable and poor (Ps. 37:14). The wicked
persecuteth the miserable and the poor, and to slay the dejected in
heart (Ps. 109:16). God will judge the miserable of the people; He will
keep the sons of the poor; He will deliver the poor that crieth and the
miserable (Ps. 72:4, 12-13). Jehovah rescueth the miserable from him
that is stronger than he, and the poor from them that spoil him (Ps.
35:10). The wicked deviseth crimes to destroy the miserable by the words
of a lie, even when the poor speaketh judgment (Isa. 32:7). The
miserable shall have joy in Jehovah, and the poor among men shall exult
in the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 29:19). Happy are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 5:3; besides other
places, as Isa. 10:2; Jer. 22:16; Ezek. 16:49; 18:12; 22:29; Amos 8:4;
Ps. 9:18; Ps. 69:32-33; Ps. 74:21; Ps. 109:22; Ps. 140:12; Deut. 15:11;
24:14; Luke 14:13, 21, 23). By the "miserable and poor" are chiefly
meant those who are not in the knowledges of truth and good and yet
desire them, since by the "rich" are meant those who possess the
knowledges of truth and good (n. 206).

<span class="margnote"><span id="210.">210.</span></span>

And blind and naked, signifies that they are without the understanding
of truth, and the will of good. By "the blind," in the Word, are meant
those who are without truths, either from a defect thereof in the church
and so from ignorance, or from not understanding them; and by "the
naked" are meant those who thence are without goods; for all spiritual
good is acquired by truths. No others are meant by "the blind" in the
following passages: Then in that day shall the deaf hear the words of
the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of thick darkness
(Isa. 29:18). Behold, your God will come; then the eyes of the blind
shall be opened (Isa. 35:4-5). I will give thee for a light of the
Gentiles, to open the blind eyes (Isa. 42:6-7). I will lead the blind in
a way that they knew not, I will make their darkness light (Isa. 42:16).
Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears
(Isa. 43:8). His watchmen are all blind, and do not know to understand
(Isa. 56:10-11). He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart,
that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their
heart (John 12:40). Jesus said, For judgment am I come into the world,
that they which see not might see, and that they which see, might be
made blind (John 9:39-41). Blind, foolish, infatuated guides (Matt.
23:16, 17, 19, 24). Blind, leaders of the blind (Matt. 15:14; Luke
6:39). By reason of the signification of "blind" and "blindness," it was
forbidden to offer for sacrifice anything that was blind (Lev. 21:18;
Deut. 15:21). That they should not cast a stumbling-block before the
blind (Lev. 19:14). That he was cursed who made the blind to wander
(Deut. 27:18). Concerning the signification of "naked" and "nakedness,"
see below (n. 213).

<span class="margnote"><span id="211.">211.</span></span>

Verse 18. I counsel thee to buy of Me gold tried in the fire, that thou
mayest be rich, signifies an admonition to acquire to themselves the
good of love from the Lord through the Word, that they may become wise.
For "to buy" signifies to acquire to oneself; "of Me," signifies of the
Lord through the Word; "gold" signifies good, and "gold tried in the
fire," the good of celestial love; and "to be enriched" thereby,
signifies to understand and be wise. "Gold" signifies good, because
metals in their order signify such things as are of good and truth, gold
celestial and spiritual good, silver the truth of those loves, brass
natural good, and iron natural truth. These are signified by the metals
of which the statue of Nebuchadnezzar consisted: The head of which was
of gold, the breast and arms of silver, the belly and thighs of brass,
the legs iron, the feet part iron and part clay (Dan. 2:32-33). By which
are represented the successive states of the church as to the good of
love and the truth of wisdom. From this succession of the states of the
church, the ancients gave similar names to times, calling them ages of
gold, silver, brass, and iron; and by the golden age they understood the
first time, when the good of celestial love reigned; celestial love is
love to the Lord from the Lord; from this love they at that time had
wisdom. That "gold" signifies the good of love may be seen below (n.
913).

<span class="margnote"><span id="212.">212.</span></span>

And white garments, that thou mayest be clothed, signifies that they
should acquire to themselves genuine truths of wisdom. That "garments"
signify truths clothing good, may be seen above (n. 166), and that
"white" is spoken of truths (n. 167), therefore "white garments" signify
the genuine truths of wisdom, and this, because "gold purified in the
fire" signifies the good of celestial love, the truths of this love
being genuine truths of wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="213.">213.</span></span>

That the shame of thy nakedness may not appear, signifies lest the good
of celestial love should be profaned and adulterated. No one can know
what "the shame of nakedness" signifies, unless he knows that the
members of generation in both sexes, which are also called the genitals,
correspond to celestial love. That there is a correspondence of man and
all his members with the heavens, may be seen in the work concerning
Heaven and Hell, published in London in the year 1758 (n. 87-102); and
that the genital members correspond to celestial love, in The Arcana
Coelestia, also published in London (n. 5050-5062). As those members
correspond to celestial love, which is the love of the third or inmost
heaven, and man is born from his parents in loves which are opposite to
that love, it is evident, that if he does not acquire to himself the
good of love and the truth of wisdom from the Lord, signified by "gold
tried in the fire," and by "white garments," he will appear in the
opposite love, which is profane. \[2\] This is signified by "uncovering
nakedness" and "revealing shame," in the following passages: Happy is he
that watcheth and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see
his shame (Rev. 16:15) Daughter of Babylon and of Chaldea, sit on the
earth; uncover thy locks, uncover the thigh, pass over the stream; let
thy nakedness be uncovered, and let thy reproach also be seen (Isa.
47:1-3). Woe to the city of bloods, because of the multitude of her
whoredoms: I will uncover the skirts upon thy face, and will show the
nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy disgrace (Nahum 3:1, 4-5).
Contend with your mother, lest perchance I set her naked (Hos. 2:2-3).
When I passed by thee, I covered thy nakedness, and washed thee, and
clothed thee; but thou committedst whoredom; not recollecting thy youth,
when thou wast naked and stripped bare; therefore thou hast revealed thy
nakedness (Ezek. 16:6 seq.). Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore
all speak ill of her, because they saw her nakedness (Lam. 1:8). By
"Jerusalem," of which these things are said, the church is meant; and by
"committing whoredom" is signified to adulterate and falsify the Word
(n. 134). Woe to him that maketh his companion drink, making him drunk,
that thou mayest look upon his nakedness: drink also thyself, that thy
foreskin may be uncovered (Hab. 2:15-16). \[3\] He who knows what
"nakedness" signifies can understand what is signified by: Noah, when
drunken with wine lay naked in the midst of his tent, and Ham saw and
laughed at his nakedness, and Shem and Japheth covered his nakedness,
turning away their faces lest they should see it (Gen. 9:21-23). Also
why it was ordained that: Aaron and his sons should not go up by steps
upon the altar, lest their nakedness should be uncovered (Exod. 20:26).
As also that: They should make for them breeches of linen to cover the
flesh of nakedness, and that they should be upon them when they
approached to the altar, and that otherwise they should carry their
iniquity, and should die (Exod. 28:42-43). By "nakedness" in these
passages are signified the evils into which a man is born, which,
because they are opposite to the good of celestial love, are in
themselves profane; which are not removed except by truths, and by a
life according to them: "linen" also signifies truth (n. 671). \[4\] By
"nakedness" is also signified innocence, and likewise ignorance of good
and truth; innocence in the passage: They were both naked, the man and
his wife, and had no cause for shame (Gen. 2:25). Ignorance of good and
truth by these: This is the fast which I choose; to break bread to the
hungry; and when thou seest the naked, to cover him (Isa. 58:6-7). Let
him give his bread to the hungry, and cover the naked with a garment
(Ezek. 18:7). I hungered, and ye gave Me to eat; I was naked, and ye
clothed Me (Matt. 25:35-36).

<span class="margnote"><span id="214.">214.</span></span>

And anoint thine eyes with eye salve, that thou mayest see, signifies
that their understanding may be healed, lest the genuine truths of
wisdom should be profaned and falsified. That by "the eyes" is signified
the understanding, and by "the eye-sight" intelligence and wisdom, may
be seen (n. 48). And since by "eye-salve" a medicine for the same is
signified, it follows that by "anoint thine eyes with eye-salve," is
signified to heal the understanding, that it may see truths and be wise;
for unless this is the case, the genuine truths of the Word are profaned
and adulterated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="215.">215.</span></span>

Verse 19. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten, signifies that those
of them who do so are loved by the Lord, and that then they cannot but
be admitted to temptations that they may fight against themselves. That
this is the sense of these words, is evident, for it is said, "As many
as I love," by whom are meant they who "buy of the Lord gold purified in
the fire," and who "anoint their eyes with eye-salve that they may see."
It is said, "I rebuke and chasten" them, by which is meant temptation as
to falsities and as to evils; by "rebuking" temptation as to falsities,
and by "chastening" temptation as to evils. Such as are here treated of,
could not but be admitted into temptations, because, without them,
negations and confirmations against Divine truth could not be
extirpated. Temptations are spiritual combats against the falsities and
evils in one's self, thus against one's self. What temptations are,
whence they proceed, and what good they produce, see the work concerning
The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, published at London in the
year 1758 (n. 187-201).

<span class="margnote"><span id="216.">216.</span></span>

Be zealous, therefore, and repent, signifies that this should be done
from the affection of truth, and aversion from what is false. It is here
said, "Be zealous," because it was said above (verse 15), "I would thou
wert either cold or hot," here hot, for "zeal" is spiritual heat, and
spiritual heat is the affection of love, here the affection of the love
of truth, and he who acts from the affection of the love of truth acts
also from aversion to what is false; therefore this is signified by
"repent." "Zeal" in the Word, when it treats of the Lord, signifies
love, and wrath; love in John 2:17; Psalm 69:9; Isaiah 37:32; 63:15;
Ezekiel 39:25; Zechariah 1:14; 8:2. Wrath in Deuteronomy 32:16, 21;
Psalm 79:5-6; Ezekiel 8:3, 5; 16:42; 23:25; Zephaniah 1:18; 3:8. But
"zeal" in the Lord is not wrath, it only appears so in externals,
interiorly it is love. It appears so in externals, because the Lord
seems to be angry when He rebukes man, especially when man's own evil
punishes him. It is so permitted from love, that his evil may be
removed; just like a parent, who, if he loves his children, suffers them
to be chastised for the sake of removing their evils. Hence it is
evident, why Jehovah calls Himself "zealous" (Deuteronomy 4:24; 5:9, 10;
6:14-15).

<span class="margnote"><span id="217.">217.</span></span>

Verse 20. Behold, I stand at the door, and knock, signifies that the
Lord is present to everyone in the Word, and is there pressing to be
received, and teaches how. Something similar to this is said by the Lord
in Luke: Be ye like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will
return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open
unto him immediately (Luke 12:36). That "door" signifies admission and
entrance, may be seen above (n. 176).

<span class="margnote"><span id="218.">218.</span></span>

If anyone hear my voice, and open the door, signifies he who believes in
the Word and lives according to it. "To hear His voice," is to believe
in the Word, for the Divine truth of the Word is "the voice of Jehovah"
(n. 37, 50); and "to open the door" is to live according to it, because
the door is not opened, and the Lord received, by merely hearing the
voice, but by living according to it, for the Lord says: He that hath My
commandments, and doeth them, I will manifest Myself to him, and I will
come unto him and make an abode with him (John 14:21-24). That man ought
to open the door as from himself, by shunning evils as sins, and doing
goods, is shown in The Doctrine of Life for the New Jerusalem; and that
this is the case, is also evident from the Lord's words here, "If anyone
open"; as also from His words in Luke 12:36.

<span class="margnote"><span id="219.">219.</span></span>

I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me, signifies
that the Lord joins Himself with them and them with Himself. "To come in
and sup with him," signifies to join Himself to him, and, since there
must be a reciprocal that there may be conjunction, it is also said,
"and he with Me." That to be conjoined is signified by "coming in and
supping," appears from the Holy Supper instituted by the Lord, by means
of which the Lord's presence is effected with those who hear His voice,
that is, who believe in the Word, but there is conjunction with those
who live according to the Word; to live according to the Word is to do
the work of repentance, and to believe in the Lord. "To sup," and "the
Lord's Supper," are mentioned, because supper takes place in the
evening, and by "the evening" is signified the last time of the church;
therefore when the Lord departed out of the world, the last time of the
church being then arrived, He supped with His disciples, and instituted
the Sacrament of the Supper. That "evening" signifies the last time of
the old church and "morning" the first of the New Church may be seen
above (n. 151).

<span class="margnote"><span id="220.">220.</span></span>

Verse 21. To him that overcometh, signifies such as are in conjunction
with the Lord by a life according to His precepts in the Word, is
evident from what has been said above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="221.">221.</span></span>

Will I give to sit with Me in My throne, signifies that they will have
conjunction with the Lord in heaven. That "the Lord's throne" is heaven,
may be seen above (n. 14), therefore "to sit with the Lord in His
throne," signifies conjunction with Him in heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="222.">222.</span></span>

As I overcame, and sit with the Father in His throne, signifies as He
and the Father are one, and are heaven. That the Father and the Lord are
one is fully shown in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord,
and elsewhere. That heaven is not heaven from anything proper to the
angels, but from the Divine of the Lord, which is in the angels and with
them; therefore by these words, "as I sit with the Father in His
throne," is signified as He and the Father are one, and are heaven;
"throne" is heaven (n. 14, 221). "As I also overcame" signifies that by
temptations admitted into His Human, and by the last of them, which was
the passion of the cross, as also by the fulfilling of all things of the
Word, He overcame the hells and glorified His Human, that is, he united
it to his Divine which was in Him from conception, and is called Jehovah
the Father, on which subject see the above-mentioned Doctrine of the New
Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 8-11, 12-14, 29-36), and also above
(n. 67). \[2\] The reason why the Lord says, "To him that overcometh
will I give to sit with Me in my throne, as I overcame and sit with the
Father in His throne," is because the union of the Lord with the Father,
that is, with His Divine within Himself, took place, to the end that it
might be possible for man to be conjoined to the Divine which is called
the Father in the Lord; because it is impossible for man to be conjoined
with the Divine of the Father immediately, but mediately through His
Divine Human, which is the Divine natural; therefore the Lord says: No
one hath seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, who is in the
bosom of the Father, He hath manifested Him (John 1:18). I am the way,
the truth, and the life, no one cometh to the Father, but by Me (John
14:6). \[3\] The Lord's conjunction with man is by His Divine truth, and
this in man is of the Lord, thus the Lord, and by no means man's,
consequently is not man. Man, indeed, feels it as his own, but still it
is not his, for it is not united to him, but adjoined; not so the Divine
of the Father, this is not adjoined but united to the Lord's Human, as
the soul to its body. He who understands these things may understand the
following words of the Lord: He that abideth in Me and I in him, the
same bringeth forth much fruit, for without Me ye can do nothing (John
15:5). In that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me,
and I in you (John 14:20). Sanctify them in Thy truth; Thy Word is
truth; for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that they also might be
sanctified in the truth: that they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art
in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us; I in them and
thou in me (John 17:17, 19, 21, 23).

<span class="margnote"><span id="223.">223.</span></span>

Verse 22. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
the churches, signifies that he who understands, ought to obey what the
Divine truth of the Word teaches those who will be of the New Church,
which is the New Jerusalem, as above (n. 87).

To this I will add this Relation. I saw an assembly of spirits, all upon
their knees, praying to God to send angels to them, that they might
converse with them face to face, and open to them the thoughts of their
hearts. And when they arose, there appeared three angels in fine linen,
standing before them, and they said, "The Lord Jesus Christ has heard
your prayers, and has therefore sent us to you; open unto us the
thoughts of your hearts." \[2\] And they answered, "We have been told by
our priests, that in matters of a theological nature the understanding
avails nothing, but only faith, and that in such things intellectual
faith is of no service to anyone, because it is derived from man. We are
Englishmen, and have heard many things from our sacred ministry, which
we believed; but when we have conversed with others, who also called
themselves the Reformed, and with others who called themselves the Roman
Catholics, and likewise with sectaries, they all appeared to us learned,
and yet, in many things, one did not agree with another, and still they
all said, \`Believe us;' and some of them, \`We are God's ministers, and
know.' But as we know that the Divine truths, which are called truths of
faith, and which appertain to the church, are not derived to anyone from
his native soil, nor by inheritance, but out of heaven from God; and as
these show the way to heaven, and enter into the life together with the
good of charity, and so lead to eternal life, we became anxious, and
prayed to God upon our knees." \[3\] Then the angels answered, "Read the
Word, and believe in the Lord, and you will see the truths which should
constitute your faith and life; for all in the Christian world draw
their doctrinals from the Word as from the only fountain." But two of
the company said, "We have read, but did not understand." \[4\] And the
angels replied, "You did not approach the Lord, and you have also
confirmed yourselves in falsities"; and the angels said further, "What
is faith without light, and what signifies thinking without
understanding? This is not human; even magpies and ravens can learn to
speak without understanding. We can affirm to you, that every man whose
soul desires it is capable of seeing the truths of the Word in the
light; there does not exist an animal that does not know the food proper
to its life when it sees it, and man is a rational and spiritual animal,
who sees the food of his life, not that of his body, but of his soul,
which is the truth of faith, provided indeed he hungers after it, and
seeks it from the Lord; whatsoever is not received also in the
understanding is not fixed in the memory in reality, but only verbally;
therefore, when we have looked down out of heaven into the world, we
have not seen anything, but have only heard sounds, that are for the
most part dissonant. \[5\] "But we will enumerate some things which the
learned among the clergy have removed from the understanding, not
knowing that there are two ways to the understanding, one from the
world, and the other from heaven, and that the Lord withdraws the
understanding from the world when He enlightens it; but if the
understanding be closed by religion, the way into it from heaven is
closed, and then man sees no more in the Word than a blind person. We
have seen many such fall into pits, out of which they have never risen
again. Examples must serve for illustration: are you not able to
understand what charity is, and what faith is; that charity consists in
doing well by your neighbor, and that faith consists in thinking well of
God and of the essentials of the church, and therefore that he who does
well and thinks well, that is, who lives well and believes well, is
saved?" They replied, that they understood these things. \[6\] The
angels said further, "Do you not understand, that repentance from sins
is to be performed, in order that man may be saved, and that, unless a
man actually repents, he abides in the sins into which he was born, and
that the work of repentance consists in not willing evils because they
are against God, and in examining himself once or twice a year, in
seeing his evils, in confessing them before the Lord, imploring
assistance, desisting from them, and leading a new life, and as far as
he does this, and believes in the Lord, so far his sins are remitted?"
Then some of the company replied, "This we understand, and thence also
what remission of sins is." \[7\] And then they solicited the angels to
give them further information, and especially concerning God, the
immortality of the soul, regeneration and baptism. To this the angels
replied, "We will not say anything but what you can understand,
otherwise our discourse will fall like rain upon sand, and upon seeds
therein, which although watered from heaven, still wither and perish."
Concerning God they said, "All who come into heaven have their place
allotted them there, and thence eternal joy, according to their idea of
God, because this idea reigns universally in every particular of
worship. The idea of an invisible God is not determined to anyone, nor
does it terminate in any, therefore it ceases and perishes. The idea of
God as Spirit, when a spirit is believed to be like ether or wind, is an
empty idea; but the idea of God as Man is a just idea, for God is the
Divine love and the Divine wisdom, with every quality belonging thereto,
and the subject of these is man, and not ether or wind. The idea of God
in heaven is the idea of the Lord. He is the God of heaven and earth, as
He Himself taught. Let your idea of God be like unto ours, and we shall
be consociated together." On saying these words, their faces became
resplendent. \[8\] Concerning the Immortality of the Soul, they said,
"Man lives to eternity, because he can be conjoined with God by love and
faith, this indeed is possible with everyone. That this possibility
constitutes the immortality of the soul you may understand, if you think
of it a little more deeply." \[9\] Concerning Regeneration;" "Who does
not see that everyone is at liberty to think of God, or not to think of
Him, provided he be instructed that there is a God; so that everyone has
liberty in spiritual things, equally as in things civil and moral; the
Lord gives this liberty to all continually; for which reason he becomes
guilty, if he does not think of God. Man is man from this ability; but a
beast is a beast from not having this ability; therefore man can reform
and regenerate himself as from himself, provided he acknowledges in
heart that it is from the Lord. Everyone who does the work of
repentance, and believes in the Lord, is reformed and regenerated. Man
must do both as from himself, but this 'as from himself' is from the
Lord. It is true that man cannot contribute anything thereto, no not in
the least, nevertheless you were not created statues, but you were
created men, that you might do that from the Lord as from yourselves.
This is the only reciprocal of love and faith, that it is altogether the
Lord's will that it should be done by man unto Him. In a word, do it
from yourselves, and believe that you do it from the Lord, thus do it as
from yourselves." \[10\] But then the Englishmen inquired, Whether to
act as from oneself, is a faculty implanted in man from creation? The
angel answered, "It is not implanted, because to act from Himself is the
Lord's alone, but it is communicated continually, that is, adjoined
continually, and then so far as man does good and believes what is true,
as from himself, so far he is an angel of heaven; but so far as he does
evil and thence believes what is false, which is done also as from
himself, so far he is an angel of hell. That this also is as from
himself surprises you, but still you see that it is so, when you pray
that you may be preserved from the devil, lest he should seduce you, and
enter into you, as he did into Judas, fill you with all iniquity, and
destroy you, soul and body. But everyone incurs guilt who believes that
he acts from himself, whether it be good, or whether it be evil; but he
does not incur guilt, who believes that he acts as from himself." \[11\]
Concerning Baptism, they said, "That it is spiritual washing, which is
reformation and regeneration; and that an infant is reformed and
regenerated, when, on becoming an adult, he does the things which his
sponsors promised for him, which are two, repentance and faith in God;
for they promise first that he shall renounce the devil and all his
works; and second, that he shall believe in God. All infants in heaven
are initiated into these two, but to them the devil is hell, and God is
the Lord. Moreover baptism is a sign before the angels that a man is of
the church. \[12\] On hearing these things, some of the assembly said,
"This we understand." But a voice was heard from one side, exclaiming,
"We do not understand;" and another voice, "We will not understand;" and
inquiry was made from whence these voices proceeded, and it was found
that they came from those who had confirmed themselves in falsities of
faith, and who wished to be believed as oracles, and thus to be adored.
The angels said, "Be not surprised: there are very many such at this
day; they appear to us from heaven like graven images, made with such
art as to be able to move the lips, and utter sounds like organs, but
without knowing whether the breath, by means of which they utter these
sounds, comes from hell or from heaven, because they do not know whether
a thing be false or true. They reason and reason; they confirm and
confirm, nor do they ever see whether it is so. But know, that human
ingenuity can confirm whatsoever one wishes, even until it appears to be
so; therefore heretics and impious persons, yea atheists can confirm
that there is no God, but nature only." \[13\] Afterwards the assembly
of Englishmen, enkindled with the desire of being wise, said to the
angels, "So many various opinions are spoken of the Holy Supper, tell us
what is the truth." The angels replied, "The truth is that the man who
looks to the Lord and performs repentance, is conjoined with the Lord by
means of that most holy sacrament, and is introduced into heaven." But
some of the company said, "This is a mystery." To which the angels
replied, "It is a mystery, but still such that it can be understood. The
bread and wine do not produce this effect, for there is nothing holy in
them, but material bread and heavenly bread correspond mutually to each
other, and so do material wine and heavenly wine; and heavenly bread is
the holy of love, and heavenly wine is the holy of faith, both from the
Lord, and both the Lord. Thence there is a conjunction of the Lord with
man, and of man with the Lord, not with the bread and wine, but with the
love and faith of the man who had done the work of repentance; and
conjunction with the Lord is also introduction into heaven." And after
the angels had taught them something concerning correspondence and its
effect, some of the company said, "Now for the first time we
understand." And when they said, "We understand," behold a flame with
light descending from heaven, consociated them with the angels, and they
loved one another.

Revelation 4 1. After these things I saw, and behold a door opened in
heaven. And the first voice, which I heard, as of a trumpet speaking
with me, said, Come up hither, and I will show thee the things which
must be hereafter. 2. And immediately I was in the spirit. And, behold,
a throne was set in heaven, and One sitting on the throne. 3. And He
that sat was in appearance like a jasper and a sardius stone; and there
was a rainbow round about the throne in appearance like an emerald. 4.
And round about the throne were four-and-twenty thrones; and upon the
thrones I saw four-and-twenty elders sitting, clothed in white garments;
and they had on their heads golden crowns. 5. And out of the throne
proceeded lightnings, and thunders, and voices; and there were seven
lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of
God. 6. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto
crystal. And in the midst of the throne and round about the throne, were
four animals full of eyes before and behind. 7. And the first animal was
like a lion, and the second animal like a calf, and the third animal
having a face like a man, and the fourth animal was like a flying eagle.
8. And the four animals each by himself had six wings about him; and
they were full of eyes within; and they had no rest day and night,
saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and
who is to come. 9. And when the animals gave glory, and honor, and
thanks to Him that sat upon the throne, who liveth for ages of ages, 10.
The four-and-twenty elders fell down before Him that sat on the throne,
and adored Him that liveth for ages of ages, and cast their crowns
before the throne, saying, 11. Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive
glory, and honor and power, for Thou hast created all things, and by Thy
will they are and were created. THE SPIRITUAL SENSE The contents of the
whole chapter It treats of the arrangement and preparation of all things
in heaven for the judgment, to be executed from the Word, and according
to it; likewise concerning the acknowledgment that the Lord is the only
judge. The contents of each verse Verse 1. "After these things, I saw
and behold a door opened in heaven," signifies a manifestation
concerning the arrangement of the heavens preparatory to the Last
Judgment from the Lord, about to be performed according to His Divine
truths in the Word (n. 225). "And the first voice which I heard, as of a
trumpet, speaking with me, said, Come up hither," signifies Divine
influx, and thence an elevation of the mind, followed by manifest
perception (n. 226). "And I will show thee the things which must be
hereafter," signifies revelations of things to come before the Last
Judgment, and concerning it, and after it (n. 227). Verse 2. "And
immediately I was in the spirit," signifies that he was let into a
spiritual state, in which the things which exist in heaven manifestly
appear (n. 228). "And, behold, a throne was set in heaven," signifies
the Judgment in a representative form. "And One sitting on the throne,"
signifies the Lord (n. 230). Verse 3. "And He that sat was in appearance
like a jasper and a sardine stone," signifies the appearance of the
Lord's Divine wisdom and Divine love in ultimates (n. 231). "And there
was a rainbow round about the throne in appearance like an emerald,"
signifies the appearance of the same also round about the Lord (n. 232).
Verse 4. "And round about the throne were four-and-twenty thrones, and
upon the thrones I saw four-and-twenty elders sitting," signifies the
arrangement of all things in heaven preparatory to the Judgment (n.
233). "Clothed in white garments," signifies from the Divine truths of
the Word (n. 234). "And they had on their heads golden crowns,"
signifies the things which are of wisdom from love (n. 235). Verse 5.
"And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, and thunders, and voices,"
signifies enlightenment, perception, and instruction from the Lord (n.
236). "And there were seven lamps of fire before the throne, which are
the seven spirits of God," <span id="fr_20"></span>[225-1](#fn_20.md)
signifies the New Heaven from among Christians (n. 237-238). Verse 6.
"And in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, there were
four animals," signifies the Word of the Lord from first to ultimates,
and its guards (n. 239). "Full of eyes before and behind," signifies the
Divine wisdom therein (n. 240). Verse 7. "And the first animal was like
a lion," signifies the Divine truth of the Word as to power (n. 241).
"And the second animal like a calf," signifies the Divine truth of the
Word as to affection (n. 242). "And the third animal having a face like
a man," signifies the Divine truth of the Word as to wisdom (n. 243).
"And the fourth animal was like a flying eagle," signifies the Divine
truth of the Word as to knowledges and thence understanding (n. 244).
Verse 8. "And the four animals each by himself had six wings about him,"
signifies the Word as to its powers and as to its guards (n. 245). "And
they were full of eyes within," signifies the Divine Wisdom in the Word
in its natural sense from its spiritual and celestial sense (n. 246).
"And they had no rest day and night, saying, \`Holy, holy, holy, Lord
God Almighty,'" signifies that the Word continually teaches the Lord,
and that He alone is God, and thence that He alone is to be worshiped
(n. 247). "Who was, and who is, and who is to come," signifies the Lord
(n. 248). Verse 9. "And when the animals gave glory, and honor, and
thanks to Him that sat upon the throne," signifies that the Word
ascribes all truth, and all good, and all worship to the Lord Who is to
judge (n. 249). "Who liveth for ages of ages," signifies that the Lord
alone is life, and that life eternal is from Him alone (n. 250). Verse
10. "The four-and-twenty elders fell down before Him that sat on the
throne, and adored Him that liveth for ages of ages," signifies the
humiliation of all in heaven before the Lord (it. 251). "And cast their
crowns before the throne," signifies the acknowledgment that their
wisdom is from Him alone (n. 252). Verse 11. " Saying, Thou art worthy,
O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power," signifies that the
kingdom is the Lord's by merit and justice, because He is the Divine
truth and the Divine good (n. 253). "For Thou hast created all things,
and by Thy will they are, and were created," signifies that all things
of heaven and the church were made and formed, and men reformed and
regenerated from the Lord's Divine love by His Divine wisdom, or from
His Divine good by His Divine truth, which also is the Word. THE
EXPLANATION Verse 1. After these things I saw, and behold a door opened
in heaven, signifies the manifestation of the arrangement of the heavens
preparatory to the Last Judgment from the Lord, about to be performed
according to His Divine truths in the Word. By "an open door," when it
relates to heaven, is signified admission, as above (n. 176); here,
also, manifestation, because he says, "I saw and behold;" and because
then were seen the things which are recorded in this chapter, which
refer to the arrangement of the heavens for the Last Judgment by the
Lord, to be executed according to His Divine truths in the Word,
therefore by "I saw, and behold a door opened in heaven," is signified a
manifestation concerning them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="226.">226.</span></span>

And the first voice which I heard, as of a trumpet speaking with me,
said, Come up hither, signifies Divine influx, and thence an elevation
of the mind, and then manifest perception. That "a voice," when heard
from heaven, is the inflowing Divine truth may be seen above (n. 37,
50), thus Divine influx; and that by "a voice as of a trumpet," is
signified manifest perception, may also be seen above (n. 37); and by
"Come up hither," is signified elevation of the mind; for in the
spiritual world, the higher anyone ascends, so much the more does he
come into purer light, by which the understanding is by degrees opened,
that is, the mind is elevated. Therefore it also follows, that he was
then in the spirit, by which is meant that he was let into a spiritual
state, in which the things which are in the heavens manifestly appear.
The voice was heard "as of a trumpet," because it treats of the
arrangement of the heavens for the Last Judgment; and voices as of a
trumpet are heard in heaven when convocations and arrangements are made.
Therefore also among the sons of Israel with whom all things were
representative of heaven and the church, it was also commanded: That
they should make trumpets of silver, and that the sons of Aaron should
sound them for the calling of assemblies, and for the journeyings, in
days of rejoicing, in festivals, in the beginnings of months, over burnt
offerings, for a memorial, and for war (Num. 10:1-10). But we shall
speak of "trumpets," and of "sounding" them, in the explanation of chap.
8, where the seven angels are mentioned, to whom were given seven
trumpets.

<span class="margnote"><span id="227.">227.</span></span>

And I will show thee things which must be hereafter, signifies
revelations of things to come before the Last Judgment, and concerning
it, and after it. These things are signified, because in Revelation
nothing else is treated of but the state of the church at its end, thus
the things that are to be before the Last Judgment, and concerning it,
and after it, as above (n. 2).

<span class="margnote"><span id="228.">228.</span></span>

Verse 2. And immediately I was in the spirit, signifies that he was let
into a spiritual state, in which the things which exist in heaven
manifestly appear. That "to be in the spirit" is to be let into a
spiritual state from Divine influx, as also what a spiritual state is
and its quality, and that a man in that state sees as manifestly the
things which are in the spiritual world, as in the natural state of the
body he sees the things which are in this world, may be seen above (n.
36).

<span class="margnote"><span id="229.">229.</span></span>

And, behold, a throne was set, signifies a representation of the
Judgment. That "a throne" signifies heaven may be seen (n. 14); that a
throne also signifies judgment, is evident from the following passages:
When the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels
with Him, then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory (Matt. 25:31
seq.). The Last Judgment is here treated of: O Jehovah, Thou hast done
my judgment, Thou sattest upon the throne a Judge of justice. Jehovah
will prepare His throne for judgment (Ps. 9:4-5, 7). I saw when the
Ancient of Days did sit; His throne was as a flame of fire; a thousand
and thousands ministered unto Him, and a myriad of myriads stood before
Him, the judgment was set and the books were opened (Dan. 7:9-10).
Jerusalem is built; thither the tribes go up; and there are set thrones
for judgment (Ps. 122:3-5). I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and
judgment was given unto them (Rev. 20:4). "The throne" built by Solomon,
mentioned (1 Kings 10:18-20) signifies both kingdom and judgment; since
kings, when they executed judgment, sat upon thrones. It is said that
"the throne" signifies judgment in a representative form, because the
things which John saw were visions which represented. They were seen as
he has described; but they were forms representative of future things,
as may be evident from what follows; as that there were seen animals, a
dragon, beasts, a temple, a tabernacle, the ark, and many other things.
Similar were the things which were seen by the prophets, spoken of above
(n. 36).

<span class="margnote"><span id="230.">230.</span></span>

And one sitting on the throne, signifies the Lord, as appears manifestly
from what follows, and from passages in the Word where it is said that
the Lord will execute judgment (as in Matt. 25:32, 33; and following
verses; John 5:22, 27; and elsewhere).

<span class="margnote"><span id="231.">231.</span></span>

Verse 3. And He that sat was in appearance like a jasper and sardius
stone signifies the appearance of the Lord's Divine wisdom and Divine
love in ultimates. "A stone," in the Word, signifies truth in ultimates,
and "a precious stone," truth transparent from good (n. 915). There are
two colors fundamental of the rest in the spiritual world, the color
white and the color red, the color white derives its origin from the
light of the sun in heaven, thus from spiritual light, which is shining
white; and the color red derives its origin from the fire of the sun
there, thus from celestial light, which is flaming. The spiritual
angels, because they are in truths of wisdom from the Lord, are in that
shining white light, therefore they are clothed in white; and the
celestial angels, because they are in the good of love from the Lord,
are in that flaming light, therefore they are clothed in red; thence
those two colors also are in the precious stones in heaven, where they
are in great abundance. This is the reason why precious stones, in the
Word, signify such things as are of the truth of wisdom, or of the good
of love, and that "the jasper," because it is shining white, signifies
the things which are of the truth of wisdom; and "the sardius," because
it is red, the things which are of the good of love. These stones
signify the appearance of the Divine wisdom and the Divine love in
ultimates, because all precious stones in heaven derive their origin
from the ultimates of the Word, and their transparency from the
spiritual sense of the ultimates. That this is the case, may be seen in
The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n.
44, 45). The ultimates of the Word are the truths and goods of the sense
of the letter. That this is the origin of precious stones in heaven can
scarcely be believed by anyone in our world, because he does not know
that all the things which exist in the spiritual world are
correspondences, and that from thence all the things which exist in the
natural world derive their spiritual origin. That this is the origin of
precious stones in heaven has been granted me to know from speech with
angels, and also to see it with my eyes, but the formation of them is
from the Lord alone. But black colors, which are also two in number,
derive their origin from hell; one in opposition to white, this
blackness being with those who have falsified the truths of the Word;
the other in opposition to red, this blackness being with those who have
adulterated the goods of the Word; the latter blackness is diabolical,
but the former satanic. The signification of "the jasper" and "the
sardius" may be seen in the explanation of chap. 21:11, 18-20.

<span class="margnote"><span id="232.">232.</span></span>

And there was a rainbow round about the throne in appearance like an
emerald, signifies the appearance of the same also round about the Lord.
In the spiritual world there appear rainbows of many kinds, they appear
of various colors as upon the earth, and they appear of one color; here
of one color, because it is said "like unto an emerald." This appearance
was round about the Lord, because it is said "round about the throne;"
round about Him is also in the angelic heaven. The Divine sphere which
surrounds the Lord is from His Divine love, and at the same time from
His Divine wisdom, which, when it is represented in the heavens, appears
in the celestial kingdom red like a ruby, in the spiritual kingdom blue
like the lapis lazuli, in the natural kingdom green like the emerald;
everywhere with ineffable splendor and radiance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="233.">233.</span></span>

Verse 4. And round about the throne were four-and-twenty thrones, and
upon the thrones I saw four-and-twenty elders sitting, signifies the
arrangement of all things in heaven preparatory to the Last Judgment. He
who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word, and at the same time
the genuine truths of the church, may believe, that when the Last
Judgment shall come, the Lord will sit upon a throne, and that there
will be other judges also upon thrones around Him. But he who knows the
spiritual sense of the Word, and at the same time the genuine truths of
the church, knows that the Lord will not then sit upon a throne, and
that neither will there be other judges about Him; and further, that
neither will the Lord judge anyone to hell, but that the Word will judge
everyone, the Lord moderating that all things may be done according to
justice. The Lord says, indeed: The Father judgeth no one, but hath
committed all judgment to the Son, and hath given Him authority to
execute judgment, because He is the Son of man (John 5:22, 27). But in
another place he says: I came not to judge the world, but to save the
world; the Word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last
day (John 12:47-48). These two passages agree, when it is known that
"the Son of man" is the Lord as to the Word (see above, n. 44);
therefore the Word will judge, the Lord moderating. \[2\] That by the
twelve tribes of Israel and their elders are signified all who are of
the Lord's church in the heavens and on earth, and, abstractly, all the
truths and goods therein, may be seen (n. 251, 349, 369, 808); and the
same by the apostles (n. 79, 790, 903); hence it is plain what is
signified by these words of the Lord: Jesus said unto the disciples, Ye
which have followed Me, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of
His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve
tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28; Luke 22:30). "Twelve" signifies all, and
is predicated of the truths and goods of heaven and the church (n. 348);
the same is signified by "twenty-four"; therefore "the twelve apostles"
and the "twenty-four elders" signify all things of the church; and
"twelve," as also "twenty-four thrones," signify the all of judgment.
Who cannot understand, that the apostles and elders will not judge; and
that they cannot? From these considerations it may appear why "thrones"
and "elders" are mentioned when the Judgment is treated of; as also in
Isaiah: Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of His people
(Isa. 3:14). In David: Jerusalem is builded, whither the tribes go up;
and there are set thrones for judgment (Ps. 122:3, 5). And in
Revelation: And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
given unto them (Rev. 20:4).

<span class="margnote"><span id="234.">234.</span></span>

Clothed in white garments, signifies from the Divine truths of the Word.
That "white garments" signify genuine truths of the Word, may be seen
above (n. 166, 212).

<span class="margnote"><span id="235.">235.</span></span>

And they had on their heads golden crowns, signifies such things as are
of wisdom from love. That "a crown" signifies wisdom, may be seen above
(n. 189); and that "gold" signifies the good of love (n. 211, 913);
hence "a golden crown" signifies wisdom from love. As from this wisdom
are derived all the things of heaven and the church, which are signified
by the four-and-twenty elders (n. 233); therefore golden crowns were
seen upon their heads. It is to be known, that the spiritual sense is
abstracted from persons, as above (n. 78, 79, 96), so also here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="236.">236.</span></span>

Verse 5. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, and thunders, and
voices, signifies enlightenment, perception, and instruction from the
Lord. "Lightnings," by reason of the flash which strikes the eyes
signify enlightenment, and "thunders," by reason of the noise which
strikes the ears signify perception, and when these two signify
enlightenment and perception, then "voices" signify instruction. These
were seen to proceed "from the throne," because they proceed from the
Son of man, or from the Lord as to the Word, and from the Lord through
the Word come all enlightenment, perception, and instruction.
"Lightnings, thunders, and voices," have a similar signification in
other parts of the Word, as in these passages: Thou hast with Thine arm
redeemed Thy people: the skies gave forth a voice; the voice of thunder
went into the world; the lightnings enlightened the world (Ps. 77:15,
17-18). The lightnings of Jehovah shall enlighten the world (Ps. 97:4).
Thou didst call upon Me in straitness, and I rescued thee: I answered
thee in the secret place of the thunder (Ps. 81:7). I heard the sound of
a great multitude, as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Hallelujah,
because the Lord, our God, the Almighty, hath taken the kingdom (Rev.
19:6). \[2\] Because enlightenment, perception, and instruction are
signified by "lightnings, thunders, and voices," therefore: When Jehovah
descended upon Mount Sinai, and promulgated the Law, there were thunders
and voices (Exod. 19:16). And when: A voice was sent down from heaven to
the Lord, it was heard as thunder (John 12:28-29). And as James and John
represented charity and its works, and all perception of truth and good
is from these: They were called by the Lord, Boanerges, that is, sons of
thunder (Mark 3:17). From these things it is manifest that similar
things are signified by "lightnings, thunders, and voices," in the
following passages in Revelation: I heard a voice from the four animals,
as it were a voice of thunder (Rev. 6:1). I heard a voice out of heaven
as a voice of great thunder (Rev. 14:2). When the angel cast the censer
unto the earth, there were thunders, voices, and lightnings (Rev. 8:5).
When the angel cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices (Rev.
10:3-4). When the temple of God was opened in heaven, there were
lightnings, and voices, and thunders (Rev. 11:19; in like manner
elsewhere).

And there where seven lamps of fire before the throne, which are the
seven spirits of God signifies the New Church in heaven and on earth
from the Lord through the Divine truth proceeding from Him. Here by
"seven lamps" the same is signified as by "the seven lamp stands;" and
also by "the seven stars" above. That by "the seven lamp stands" is
meant the New Church upon earth, which will be in enlightenment from the
Lord, may be seen above (n. 43), and by "the seven stars," the New
Church in the heavens (n. 65); and because the church is a church from
the Divine which proceeds from the Lord, which is the Divine truth, and
is called the Holy Spirit, therefore it is said, "which are the seven
spirits of God." That by "the seven spirits of God" is signified that
proceeding Divine, may be seen above (n. 14, 155).

<span class="margnote"><span id="238.">238.</span></span>

Verse 6. And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto
crystal, signifies the New Heaven from Christians who are in general
truths from the literal sense of the Word. In the spiritual world there
appear atmospheres, and also waters, like as in our world; the
atmospheres, in which the angels of the highest heaven dwell, are as it
were ethereal; the atmospheres, in which the angels of the middle heaven
dwell, are as it were aerial; and the atmospheres, in which the angels
of the lowest heaven dwell, are as it were aqueous; and these last
appear as seas at the boundaries of heaven, where they dwell who are in
general truths from the literal sense of the Word. That "waters" signify
truths, may be seen above (n. 50); hence "the sea," in which waters
terminate and are collected, signifies the Divine truth in its
boundaries. Since, therefore, by "One sitting on the throne" is meant
the Lord (n. 230), and by "the seven lamps," which are "the seven
spirits of God before the throne," is meant the New Church, which will
be in Divine truth from the Lord (n. 237), it is evident that, by "the
sea of glass" which was before the throne, is meant the church among
those who are at the boundaries. \[2\] It has also been granted me to
see the seas which are at the boundaries of the heavens, and to converse
with those who were therein, and thus to know the truth of this matter
from experience. They seemed to me to be in the sea, but they said that
they are not in the sea, but in an atmosphere; from which it was
manifest to me, that the sea is an appearance of the Divine proceeding
from the Lord in its boundaries. That there are seas in the spiritual
world, is fully evident from their having been seen by John frequently
(as also here, in chap. 5:13; 7:1-3; 8:8, 9; 10:2, 8; 12:12; 13:1; 14:7;
15:2; 16:3; 18:17, 19, 21; 20:13). It is called "a sea of glass like
unto crystal," from the pellucidity of the Divine truth proceeding from
the Lord. \[3\] Because Divine truth at its boundaries causes the
appearance of a sea in the spiritual world, therefore "sea," in other
parts of the Word, has a similar signification, as in these passages: In
that day living waters shall go forth from Jerusalem, part of them
toward the eastern sea, and part of them toward the hinder sea (Zech.
14:8). "Living waters from Jerusalem," are the Divine truths of the
church from the Lord, therefore "the sea" is where they terminate: Thy
way, O Jehovah, is in the sea, and Thy highway in many waters (Ps.
77:19). Thus saith Jehovah, which maketh a way in the sea, and a highway
in many waters (Isa. 43:16). Jehovah hath founded the world upon the
seas, and established it upon the floods (Ps. 24:2). Jehovah hath
founded the earth upon its bases that it should not be removed to
eternity. Thou coveredst it with the deep \[or sea\] as with a garment
(Ps. 104:5, 6). "The earth is founded upon the sea," is the church,
which is meant by "the earth," is founded upon general truths; for these
are its bases and foundations. \[4\] And I will dry up the sea of
Babylon and make her springs dry; He shall make the sea to ascend over
Babylon, she shall be covered with the multitude of the waves (Jer.
51:36, 42). "Drying up the sea of Babylon and making her springs dry,"
signifies to extinguish every truth of its church from firsts to lasts.
They shall walk after Jehovah, then the sons shall approach with honor
from the sea (Hos. 11:10). "Sons from the sea" are they who are in
general or ultimate truths. Jehovah who buildeth His steps in the
heavens, and calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out
upon the faces of the earth (Amos 9:6). By the word of Jehovah were the
heavens made, He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap,
giving the abysses in treasuries (Ps. 33:6-7). At My rebuke I dry up the
sea, I make the rivers a wilderness (Isa. 50:2: besides in other
places). \[5\] As by "sea" is signified the Divine truth with those who
are in the borders of heaven, therefore by "Tyre and Zidon," from their
being near the sea, is signified the church as to the knowledges of good
and truth; and also by the "islands of the sea" are signified those who
are in more remote Divine worship (n. 34): and therefore "the sea," in
the Hebrew language, is called "the west," that is, where the light of
the sun declines towards its evening, or truth into obscurity. That
"sea" also signifies the natural of man separated from the spiritual,
thus also hell, will be seen in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="239.">239.</span></span>

And in the midst of the throne and round about the throne, there were
four animals, signifies the Word of the Lord from first to ultimates,
and its guards. I know they will wonder that it should be said, "the
four animals" signify the Word; that this is their signification, will
however be seen in what follows. These "animals" are the same as "the
cherubim" in Ezekiel, where they are also called "animals" in chapter 1,
but "cherubim" in chapter 10, and were, in like manner as here, a lion,
an ox, a man, and an eagle. In the Hebrew language they are there called
"chajoth," a word which indeed signifies animals, but is derived from
"chaja," which is life, whence also the wife of Adam was called "Chaja"
(Genesis 3:20). "Animal" in the singular number is also called "chaja"
in Ezekiel, therefore those animals may also be called living things.
Neither is it anything extraordinary that the Word is described by
animals, since the Lord Himself in many parts of the Word is called "a
lion," and often "Lamb," and they who are in charity from the Lord are
called "sheep"; and the understanding also of the Word, in what follows,
is called "a horse." That the Word is signified by these "animals" or
"cherubim," is evident from this, that they were seen "in the midst of
the throne and round about the throne," and in the midst of the throne
was the Lord, and, as the Lord is the Word, they could not be seen
anywhere else. That they were round about the throne also, was, because
they were in the angelic heaven, where also the Word is. \[2\] That by
"cherubim" is signified the Word, and its guards, is shown in The
Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 97),
where are the following words: The sense of the letter of the Word
serves as a guard for the genuine truths which lie within; and the guard
consists in this, that the literal sense can be turned hither and
thither, that is, can be explained according to everyone's apprehension,
without its internal being hurt or violated; for no harm ensues from the
literal sense being understood differently by different people; but it
does harm when the Divine truths which are within are perverted, for it
is by this that the Word suffers violence. To prevent this, the literal
sense guards, and it guards with those who are in falsities from
religion, but yet do not confirm them, for from these the Word suffers
no violence. This guard is signified by "cherubim," and is also
described by them in the Word. This guard is signified by "the
cherubim," which after the expulsion of Adam and his wife from the
garden of Eden, were placed at its entrance; concerning which we read:
When Jehovah God had driven out the man, He made to dwell from the east
to the garden of Eden cherubim, and a flame of a sword, which turned
every way, to guard the way of the tree of life (Gen. 3:23-24). By
"cherubim" is signified a guard; by "the way of the tree of life" is
signified admission to the Lord, which is given to men through the Word;
by "a flame of a sword which turned every way," is signified the Divine
truth in ultimates, which is as the Word in the sense of the letter,
that allows of being turned this way and that. \[3\] The same is meant
by: The cherubim made of gold over the two extremities of the
mercy-seat, which was above the ark in the Tabernacle (Exod. 25:18-21).
Because this was signified by "cherubim," therefore: Jehovah spoke from
between them with Moses (Exod. 25:22; 30:6; Num. 7:89). Nor was anything
else understood by: The cherubim over the curtains of the tabernacle and
over the veil there (Exod. 26:31). For the curtains and veil of the
tabernacle represented the ultimates of heaven, and the church, thus
also the ultimates of the Word. Nothing else is signified by the
cherubim in the middle of the temple of Jerusalem (1 Kings 6:23-28); and
by the cherubim carved upon the walls and doors of the temple (1 Kings
6:29, 32, 35); and also by the cherubim in the new temple (Ezek.
41:18-20). \[4\] Since by "cherubim" was signified a guard that the
Lord, heaven, and the Divine truth such as it is interiorly in the Word,
be not approached immediately, but mediately by ultimates, therefore it
is said of the king of Tyre: Thou sealest up the measure, full of wisdom
and perfect in beauty. Thou hast been in the garden of Eden; every
precious stone was thy covering; thou O spreading cherub that covereth;
I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, in the midst of the stones of
fire (Ezek. 28:12-14, 16). By "Tyre" is signified the church as to the
knowledges of truth and good, and thence, by its "king," the Word where
and whence those knowledges are. That the Word in its ultimate, which is
the sense of the letter, is here signified by him, and a guard, by "the
cherub," is evident, for it is said, "Thou sealest up the measure, every
precious stone was thy covering," and, "thou O spreading cherub that
covereth;" by "the precious stones" which are also mentioned there, are
signified the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word (n. 231).
\[5\] Because by "cherubim" is signified the Divine truth in ultimates
as a guard, therefore it is said in David: O Shepherd of Israel, that
sitteth upon the cherubim, shine forth (Ps. 80:1). Jehovah sitteth upon
the cherubim (Ps. 99:1). Jehovah bowed the heavens and came down, and
rode upon the cherubim (Ps. 18:10-11). "To ride upon cherubim," "to sit"
and "to be seated upon them," means upon the ultimate sense of the Word.
The Divine truth in the Word, and its quality, is described by the
cherubim in Ezekiel, in chapters 1, 9, 10, but because no one can know
what the particulars by which they are described signify, unless the
spiritual sense has been opened to him, therefore, as it has been
disclosed to me, I will explain, in a summary way, the signification of
those things which are related concerning the four animals or cherubim
in the first chapter of Ezekiel, which is as follows: \[6\] The Divine
external sphere of the Word is described (Ezek. 1:4). It is represented
as a man (Ezek. 1:5). Its conjunction with things spiritual and
celestial (Ezek. 1:6). The natural of the Word, its quality (Ezek. 1:7).
The conjunction of the spiritual and celestial senses of the Word with
the natural, its quality (Ezek. 1:8-9). The Divine love of celestial,
spiritual, and natural good and truth therein, jointly and severally
(Ezek. 1:10-11). That they regard one end (Ezek. 1:12). The sphere of
the Word from the Lord's Divine good and Divine truth, from which the
Word lives (Ezek. 1:13-14). The doctrine of good and truth in the Word
and from the Word (Ezek. 1:15-21). The Divine of the Lord above it and
in it (Ezek. 1:22-23). And out of it (Ezek. 1:24-25). That the Lord is
above the heavens (Ezek. 1:26). That the Divine love and the Divine
wisdom are His (Ezek. 1:27-28). These are summaries.

<span class="margnote"><span id="240.">240.</span></span>

Full of eyes before and behind, signifies the Divine wisdom, therein. By
"eyes," when spoken of man, is signified the understanding, and when of
the Lord, the Divine wisdom (n. 48, 125); the same when said of the
Word, as here, because the Word is from the Lord, and concerning the
Lord, and thus is the Lord. The like is said of the cherubim in Ezekiel,
that "they were full of eyes" (10:12). "Before and behind," when it
relates to the Word from the Lord, signifies the Divine wisdom and
Divine love therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="241.">241.</span></span>

Verse 7. And the first animal was like a lion, signifies the Divine
truth of the Word as to power. That "a lion" signifies truth in its
power, here the Divine truth of the Word as to power, may appear from
the power of the lion above every animal of the earth, as also from
lions in the spiritual world, where they are images representative of
the power of Divine truth; and likewise from the Word, where they
signify the Divine truth in its power. What the power of the Divine
truth in the Word is, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Sacred Scripture, n. 49, and in the work on Heaven and
Hell, (n. 228-233). Hence it is that Jehovah, or the Lord is compared to
"a lion," and is also called "a lion"; as in the following passages: The
lion roareth, who will not fear? the Lord Jehovah hath spoken, who will
not prophesy? (Amos 3:8). I will not return to destroy Ephraim, they
shall walk after Jehovah. He roareth as a lion (Hos. 11:9-10). As the
lion roareth and the young lion, so shall Jehovah come down to fight
upon Mount Zion (Isa. 31:4). Behold the Lion which is of the tribe of
Judah, the Root of David hath conquered (Rev. 5:5). Judah is a lion's
whelp, he coucheth, he lay down, as an old lion, who shall rouse him up?
(Gen. 49:9). \[2\] In these passages the power of Divine truth which is
from the Lord, is described by "the lion." "To roar" signifies to speak
and act from power against the hells which wish to carry man away, but
from which the Lord rescues him as a lion his prey; to "couch himself,"
is to put himself in power; "Judah," in the highest sense, signifies the
Lord (n. 96, 266). The angel cried with a great voice as a lion roareth
(Rev. 10:3). He couched, he lay down as an old lion, who shall stir him
up? (Num. 24:9). Behold, the people shall rise up as an old lion, and
lift up himself as a young lion (Num. 23:24) This is concerning Israel,
by whom is signified the church, whose power, which is in Divine truths,
is thus described. In like manner: The remnant of Jacob shall be in the
midst of the people, as a lion among the beasts of the forests, as a
young lion among the flocks of sheep (Micah 5:7-8; besides many other
places; as Isa. 11:6; 21:6-9; 35:9; Jer. 2:15; 4:7; 5:6; 12:8; 50:17;
51:38; Ezek. 19:3, 5-6; Hos. 13:7-8; Joel 1:6-7; Nahum 2:12; Ps. 17:12;
22:13; 57:4; 58:6; 91:13; 104:21-22; Deut. 33:20).

<span class="margnote"><span id="242.">242.</span></span>

And the second animal like a calf signifies the Divine truth of the Word
as to affection. By the beasts of the earth are signified the various
natural affections, for such indeed they are; and by "a calf," is
signified the affection of knowing; in the spiritual world this
affection is represented by a calf, therefore it is also signified by "a
calf" in the Word, as in Hosea: We will render unto Jehovah the calves
of our lips (Hos. 14:2). "Calves of the lips" are confessions from the
affection of truth. In Malachi: But unto you that fear My name, shall
the sun of justice arise, and healing in his wings, that ye may grow up
as fatted calves (Mal. 4:2). They are compared to "fatted calves"
because by them are signified those who are filled with the knowledges
of truth and good from the affection of knowing them. In David: The
voice of Jehovah maketh the cedars of Lebanon to skip like a calf (Ps.
29:6). By "the cedars of Lebanon" are signified the knowledges of truth;
hence it is said that "the voice of Jehovah maketh them to skip like a
calf." "The voice of Jehovah" is the Divine truth, here affecting. \[2\]
Since the Egyptians loved the sciences, they made to themselves calves
as a sign of their affection for them; but afterwards they began to
worship the calves as gods, then by them, in the Word, are signified the
affections of knowing falsities as in Jeremiah (46:20, 21; Psalm 68:30);
and in other places; therefore the same is signified by the calf which
the sons of Israel made for themselves in the wilderness (Exodus 32); as
also by the calves of Samaria (1 Kings 12:28-32; Hosea 8:5; 10:5).
Therefore it is said in Hosea: They make for themselves a molten image
of silver, sacrificing a man, they kiss the calves (Hos. 13:2). To "make
for themselves a molten image of silver," signifies to falsify truth,
"to sacrifice a man" signifies to destroy wisdom, and "to kiss calves"
signifies to acknowledge falsities from affection. In Isaiah: There
shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down and consume the
branches thereof (Isa. 27:10). The same is signified by calf in Jeremiah
34:18-20. \[3\] Since all Divine worship is from the affections of truth
and good, and thence from the knowledge of them, therefore sacrifices,
in which the worship of the church with the sons of Israel chiefly
consisted, were made of various beasts, such as lambs, goats, kids,
sheep, he-goats, calves, oxen; they were from calves, because they
signified the affection of knowing truths and goods, which is the first
natural affection. This is what was signified by "sacrifices of calves"
(Exodus 29:11, 12; Leviticus 4:3, 13 and following verses; 8:14 and
following verses; 9:2; 16:3; 23:18; Numbers 8:8 and following verses;
15:24; 28:19, 20; Judges 6:25-29; 1 Samuel 1:25; 16:2; 1 Kings 18:23-26,
33). The second animal appeared like a calf, because the Divine truth of
the Word, which is signified by it, affects minds and thus instructs and
imbues.

<span class="margnote"><span id="243.">243.</span></span>

And the third animal having a face like a man, signifies the Divine
truth of the Word as to wisdom. By "a man," in the Word, is signified
wisdom, because he is born that he may receive wisdom from the Lord, and
become an angel; therefore in proportion as anyone is wise, in the same
proportion he is a man. Wisdom truly human consists in knowing that
there is a God, what God is, and what is of God; this the Divine truth
of the Word teaches. That by "a man" is signified wisdom, is plain from
the following places: I will make a man \[vir\] more rare than pure
gold; even a man \[homo\] than the gold of Ophir (Isa. 13:12). Man \[vir
homo\] is intelligence, and man \[homo\] is wisdom: The inhabitants of
the earth shall be burned, and rare shall be the man that is left (Isa.
24:6). I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the
seed of man and with the seed of beast (Jer. 31:27). And ye, my flock,
are man, I am your God (Ezek. 34:31). The devastated cities shall be
filled with the flocks of man (Ezek. 36:38). I beheld the earth, and lo,
it was vacant and empty; and the heavens, and they had no light; I
beheld, and lo, there was no man (Jer. 4:23, 25). They sacrifice a man,
they kiss calves (Hos. 13:2). He measured the wall of the holy Jerusalem
a hundred and forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is of an
angel (Rev. 21:17). Besides many other places in which by man is
signified one that is wise, and, in the abstract sense, wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="244.">244.</span></span>

And the fourth animal was like a flying eagle, signifies the Divine
truth of the Word as to knowledges, and thence understanding. By
"eagles" various things are signified, and by "flying eagles" are
signified knowledges from which understanding is derived, because when
they fly they both know and see; for they have sharp eyes that they may
see clearly, and by "eyes" are signified the understanding (n. 48, 214):
by "flying" is signified to receive and instruct, and, in the highest
sense, in which it has relation to the Lord, it signifies to foresee and
provide. That "eagles" in the Word have such a signification, appears
from these passages: They that wait for Jehovah shall renew their
strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles (Isa. 40:31). "To
mount up with wings as eagles," is to be elevated into the knowledges of
truth and good, and thence into intelligence: Is it by thy intelligence
and according to thy mouth that the eagle lifteth himself and searcheth
out his food; his eyes see clearly afar (Job. 39:26-27, 29). The faculty
of knowing, understanding, and seeing clearly, is here described by "the
eagle," and that this is not from man's own intelligence. Jehovah who
satisfieth thy mouth with good so that thy youth is renewed like the
eagle (Ps. 103:5). "To satisfy the mouth with good," is to give
understanding by knowledges; hence a comparison is made with the eagle.
A great eagle, great in wings, long in feathers, came upon Lebanon, and
took a twig of a cedar, and placed it in a field of seed, and it grew.
And there was also another great eagle, to which the vine applied its
roots (Ezek. 17:1-8). Here by "the two eagles" is described the Jewish
and Israelitish churches, both as to the knowledges of truth and
consequent intelligence. But "eagles" in the opposite sense signify the
knowledges of what is false, from which the understanding is perverted
(as in Matt. 24:28; Jer. 4:13; Hab. 1:8, 9; and other places).

<span class="margnote"><span id="245.">245.</span></span>

Verse 8. And the four animals each by himself had six wings about him,
signifies the Word as to its powers and as to its guards. That by "the
four animals" the Word is signified, was shown above; that by wings are
signified powers, and also guards, will be seen below. By "six" is
signified all as to truth and good, for six is composed of "three" and
"two" multiplied together, and by "three" is signified all as to truth
(n. 505), and by "two" all as to good (n. 762). By "wings" are signified
powers, because by them birds lift themselves up, and wings with birds
are in the place of arms with men, and by "arms" are signified powers.
Since by "wings" are signified powers, and each animal had six wings, it
is evident, from what has been said above, what kind of power is
signified by the wings of each, namely, that by "the wings of the lion"
is signified the power of fighting against evils and falsities from
hell; which power is of the Divine truth of the Word from the Lord. That
by "the wings of the calf" is signified the power of affecting minds,
for the Divine truth of the Word affects those who read it as holy. That
by "the six wings of the man" is signified the power of being wise as to
what God is, and what is of God, for this is properly man's in reading
the Word: and that by "the wings of the eagle" is signified the power of
knowing truth and good, and thereby acquiring intelligence for oneself.
\[2\] Concerning the wings of the cherubim we read in Ezekiel that: The
wings kissed each other, and that they also covered their bodies, and
that under them there was the likeness of hands (Ezek. 1:23-24; 3:13;
10:5, 21). By "kissing each other," is signified to act in conjunction
and unanimously; by "covering their bodies," is signified to guard lest
the interior truths which belong to the spiritual sense of the Word be
violated; and by "the hands under the wings" are signified powers.
Concerning "the seraphim," it is also said, that: They had six wings;
with two of which they covered the face, and with two the feet, and with
two they flew (Isa. 6:2). By "seraphim" in like manner is signified the
Word, properly doctrine from the Word, and by "the wings with which they
covered the faces and feet," in like manner are signified guards, and by
"the wings with which they flew," powers, as above. That by "flying" is
signified to perceive and instruct, and in the highest sense to look out
for and provide, is also evident from these passages: God rode upon a
cherub, He did fly, and was carried upon the wings of the wind (Ps.
18:10; 2 Sam. 22:11). I saw an angel flying through the midst of heaven,
having the everlasting gospel (Rev. 14:6). \[3\] That by wings are
signified guards, is plain from the following passages: Jehovah shall
cover thee under His wings (Ps. 91:4). To be hid under the shadow of
God's wings (Ps. 17:8). To confide in the shadow of His wings (Ps. 36:7;
57:1; 63:7). I stretched out a wing over thee, and covered thy nakedness
(Ezek. 16:8). Unto you shall be healing in His wings (Mal. 4:2). As an
eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad
her wings, beareth them on her wings, so Jehovah leadeth him (Deut.
32:11-12). Jesus said, O Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy
children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings
(Matt. 23:37; Luke 13:34).

<span class="margnote"><span id="246.">246.</span></span>

And they were full of eyes within, signifies the Divine wisdom in the
Word, in its natural sense from its spiritual and celestial senses. That
by "the animals were full of eyes before and behind" is signified the
Divine wisdom in the Word, may be seen above (n. 240); in like manner
here, by "their wings were full of eyes." And because the Divine wisdom
of the Word in its natural sense is from its spiritual and celestial
senses, which are concealed within, it is therefore said, that "within
they were full of eyes." Concerning the spiritual and celestial senses,
which are contained in every particular of the Word, see The Doctrine of
the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 5-26).

And they had no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
Almighty, signifies that the Word continually teaches of the Lord, and
that He alone is God, and thence that He alone is to be worshiped. "The
animals had no rest day and night," signifies that the Word continually,
and without intermission, teaches; and that it teaches what the animals
say, namely, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty," that is, that the
Lord alone is God, and thence that He alone is to be worshiped. This is
what is signified by holy three times repeated, for the triplication
involves all holiness in Him alone. That the Divine Trinity is in the
Lord, is fully shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the
Lord; as also that the Word treats of the Lord alone, and that thence is
its sanctity. That the Lord alone is holy, may be seen above (n. 173).

Who was, and who is, and who is to come, signifies the Lord. That it is
the Lord is plain from chap. 1:4, 8, 11, 17, where it treats of the Son
of man who is the Lord as to the Word, and there it is expressly said
that: He is the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the
First and the Last, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the
Almighty (Rev. 1:8). But what is signified by these words, is explained
(n. 13, 29-31, 38, 57); here that the Lord is meant by "Holy, holy,
holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come."

Verse 9. And when these animals gave glory, and honor, and thanks to Him
that sat upon the throne, signifies that the Word ascribes all truth,
and all good, and all worship to the Lord, who is to judge. "The
animals" are the Word, as has been shown; "glory and honor," when
ascribed to the Lord, mean, that all truth and all good are His and from
Him; "thanks" signify the all of worship; "He that sat on the throne"
signifies the Lord as to judgment, as above. Hence it is evident, that
by "when the animals gave glory, and honor, and thanks to Him that sat
on the throne," is signified that the Word ascribes all truth, and all
good, and all worship, to the Lord who is to judge. By "giving the Lord
glory and honor," nothing else is meant in the Word than to acknowledge
and confess that all truth and all good is from Him, thus that He alone
is God, for He has glory from the Divine truth, and honor from the
Divine good. \[2\] This is signified by "glory and honor" in the
following passages: Jehovah made the heavens, glory and honor are before
Him (Ps. 96:5-6). O Jehovah, O God, Thou art very great, Thou art
clothed with glory and honor (Ps. 104:1). The works of Jehovah are
great, glory and honor are His work (Ps. 111:2-3). Glory and honor Thou
layest upon Him, blessings for ever (Ps. 21:5-6). Concerning the Lord:
Gird Thy sword upon the thigh, O mighty, in glory and honor; in Thy
honor mount up, ride upon the Word of truth (Ps. 45:3-4). Thou hast made
him a little lower than the angels, Thou hast crowned him with glory and
honor (Ps. 8:5). The glory of Lebanon is given unto it, the honor of
Carmel and Sharon; they shall see the glory of Jehovah and the honor of
our God (Isa. 35:2). These things refer to the Lord (besides other
places, as Psalms 145:4-5, 12; Revelation 21:24, 26). Moreover, when the
Divine truth is treated of in the Word, it is called "glory" (n. 629);
and when the Divine good is treated of it is called "honor."

Who liveth for ages of ages, signifies the Lord that He alone is life,
and from Him alone is life eternal, as seen above (n. 58, 60).
