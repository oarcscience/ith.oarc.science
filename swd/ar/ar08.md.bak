### Apocalypse Revealed

<span class="margnote"><span id="351.">351.</span></span>

Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand signifies wisdom from
celestial love, with those who will be in the Lord's New Heaven and New
Church. By "Reuben," in the highest sense is signified omniscience; in
the spiritual sense, wisdom, intelligence, and science, also faith; and,
in the natural sense sight; but here by "Reuben" is signified wisdom,
because it follows after "Judah," by whom is signified celestial love,
and celestial love produces wisdom; for love does not exist without its
consort, which is science, intelligence, and wisdom. The consort of
natural love is science, that of spiritual love is intelligence, and
that of celestial love is wisdom. \[2\] That these things are signified
by "Reuben," follows from his being named from "sight," and
spiritual-natural sight is science, spiritual sight is intelligence, and
celestial sight is wisdom. Reuben was also the first born of Jacob, and
therefore was called by Israel: His might, the beginning of his
strength, excellent in eminence, and excellent in valor (Gen. 49:3).
Such indeed is wisdom from celestial love. And as Reuben from his
primogeniture represented, and thence signified, the wisdom of the men
of the church, therefore: He exhorted his brethren not to kill Joseph,
and was grieved when Joseph was not found in the pit (Gen. 37:21-22,
29). And on this account: His tribe encamped on the south, and was
called the camp of Reuben (Num. 2:10-16). The "south" also signifies
wisdom from love; therefore they who are in that wisdom dwell to the
south in heaven, as may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n.
148-150). This wisdom is signified by "Reuben" in the prophecy of
Deborah and Barak by these words: For the divisions of Reuben were great
statutes of heart. Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the
bleatings of the flocks? In the divisions of Reuben there were great
searchings of heart (Judg. 5:15-16). "The divisions of Reuben" are the
knowledges of every kind which have relation to wisdom. \[3\] As all the
tribes have an opposite signification also, the tribe of Reuben, in this
sense, signifies wisdom separated from love, and thence also faith
separated from charity; wherefore: He was cursed by his father Israel
(Gen. 49:3-4). And therefore he was deprived of his birthright (1 Chron.
5:1). See above (n. 17); and therefore: An inheritance was given him on
the other side Jordan, and not in the land of Canaan; and instead of
Reuben and Simeon, the sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, were
acknowledged (Gen. 48:5). Nevertheless he retained the representation
and thence the signification of wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="352.">352.</span></span>

Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand, signifies uses of life,
which are of wisdom from that love, also with those who will be in the
Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Gad," in the highest sense, is
signified omnipotence; in the spiritual sense, the good of life, which
also is use; and, in the natural sense, work; in this instance uses of
life, because it follows after Reuben and Judah, and celestial love
through wisdom produces uses. There are three things which cohere and
cannot be separated: love, wisdom, and use of life; if one is separated,
the other two fall to the ground, as may be seen in The Angelic Wisdom
Concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 241, 297, 316). That by "Gad"
is signified use of life, which is also called fruit, may appear from
his being named from a troop or a heap (Gen. 30:10-11); as also from his
father Israel's blessing (Gen. 49:19); and from the blessing of him by
Moses (Deut. 33:20-21); and likewise from his inheritance (Num. 32:1-42;
34:14; Deut. 3:16-17; Josh. 13:24-28). Also from the signification of
"Gad" in the opposite sense (Isa. 65:11; Jer. 49:1-3). It must be known,
that all the tribes of Israel are here divided into four classes, as in
the Urim and Thummin, and in the encampments, and that each class
contains three tribes, by reason that three cohere as one, as love,
wisdom, and use, and as charity, faith, and work; for, as was said, if
one is wanting, the other two are not anything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="353.">353.</span></span>

Verse 6. Of the tribe of Asher were sealed twelve thousand, signifies
mutual love, which is the love of doing good uses to the community or
society, with those who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church.
By "Asher," in the highest sense, is signified eternity; in the
spiritual sense, eternal happiness; and, in the natural sense, the
affection of good and truth; but here by "Asher" is signified the love
of doing uses, which is with those who are in the Lord's celestial
kingdom, and is there called mutual love. This love descends proximately
from love to the Lord, because the love of the Lord is to do uses to the
community, and to each society in the community, and He does these by
means of men who are in love to Him. That Asher has the above
signification, may in some measure be seen from the blessing of his
father Israel: Of Asher; his bread shall be fat, and he shall give the
dainties of a king (Gen. 49:20). And from his blessing by Moses: Blessed
above sons is Asher; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and as his
day his fame shall be (Deut. 33:24-25). He was named also from blessing;
and they who are in the love of doing uses to the community and to
society, enjoy happiness above all others in heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="354.">354.</span></span>

Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the
perception of use and what use is, with those who will be in the Lord's
New Heaven and New Church. By "Naphtali" in the highest sense, is
signified the proper power of the Lord's Divine Human; in the spiritual
sense, temptation and victory; and, in the natural sense, resistance by
the natural man; for he was named from wrestlings. But "Naphtali" here
signifies the perception of use, and what use is, because it follows in
the series after Asher, by whom is signified the love of uses; and also
because they who have conquered in temptation, have an interior
perception of uses; for by temptations the interiors of the mind are
opened. The perception which they have is described in Jeremiah 31:33,
34; they feel in themselves what is good, and see in themselves what is
true. That "the tribe of Naphtali" signifies angels and men as to that
perception, may be confirmed from these things in the Word: Naphtali is
upon the heights of the field (Judg. 5:18). The heights of "the field"
are the interiors of the church as to perception. Naphtali is satisfied
with good pleasure, and full with the blessing of Jehovah; possess thou
the west and the south (Deut. 33:23). "To possess the west," is the good
of love serving, and "to possess the south," is the light of wisdom,
which is that perception. Naphtali is a hind let loose, giving
discourses of elegance (Gen. 49:21). Thus is described the state after
temptation as to free eloquence from perception. It is also recorded
that: One of the tribe of Naphtali was filled with wisdom, intelligence
and knowledge and made all Solomon's work about the temple in brass (1
Kings 7:14). The historical parts of the Word, as to names and tribes,
are equally as significative as the prophetical.

<span class="margnote"><span id="355.">355.</span></span>

Of the tribe of Manasseh were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the will
of serving and of action, with those also who will be of the Lord's New
Heaven and New Church. There are three things which follow in order:
love to the Lord, wisdom, and use, as was said above (n. 352); so also
here, mutual love, understanding or perception, and will or action;
these likewise make one, so that if one of them is wanting, the other
two are not anything; the will of serving with the action, is the
effect, thus the ultimate, in which the two former are and co-exist. The
reason why "Manasseh" has this signification, is, because Joseph, who
was the father of Manasseh and Ephraim, signifies the spiritual of the
church; and the spiritual of the church is the good of the will, and at
the same time the truth of the understanding; hence it is that
"Manasseh" signifies the voluntary of the church, and "Ephraim" its
intellectual. "Manasseh" signifies the voluntary of the church, because
"Ephraim" signifies its intellectual, as appears manifestly in Hosea,
where Ephraim is so frequently mentioned; and as "Manasseh" signifies
the voluntary of the church, he also signifies act, for the will is the
endeavor of every act, and where there is endeavor, there is action,
when it is possible. Mention is made of "Manasseh" in several places, as
when he was born (Gen. 41:50-52); when he was accepted of Jacob as if
instead of Simeon (Gen. 48:3-5) and blessed by him (Gen. 48:15, 16); and
by Moses, (Deut. 33:17) and moreover in Isaiah 9:18-20; Psalms 60:7;
80:2; 108:8. From which it may in some measure be seen, that by
"Manasseh" is signified the voluntary of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="356.">356.</span></span>

Verse 7. Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand, signifies
spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor or charity, with
those who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Simeon,"
in the highest sense, is signified providence; in the spiritual sense,
love towards the neighbor or charity; and, in the natural sense,
obedience and hearing. In the two foregoing series they are treated of
who are in the Lord's celestial kingdom; but in this series they are
treated of who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom; the love of the
latter is called spiritual love, which is love towards the neighbor, and
charity. The reason why Simeon and his tribe represented this love, and
therefore signify it in the Word, is because he was born after Reuben,
and immediately before Levi, and by these three, Reuben, Simeon, and
Levi, in their order, is signified truth in the understanding, or faith;
truth in the will, or charity; and truth in act, or good work; in like
manner as by Peter, James, and John. That Simeon and his tribe might
therefore represent truth in the will, which is both charity and
obedience, he was named from hearing, and to hear signifies both to
understand truth and to will or obey it; to understand it when it is
said to hear anyone, and to will and obey it, when it is said to listen
to anyone, or to hearken. \[2\] Here something shall be said concerning
love towards the neighbor, or charity: love towards the neighbor, is the
love of obeying the Lord's commandments, which are chiefly those
contained in the second table of the Decalogue, and which are, thou
shalt not kill; thou shalt not commit whoredom; thou shalt not steal;
thou shalt not bear false witness; thou shalt not covet the things which
are thy neighbor's. The man who will not do such things because they are
sins, loves the neighbor; for he does not love the neighbor who hates
him, and from hatred wishes to kill him; he does not love the neighbor
who desires to commit whoredom with his wife; nor does he love the
neighbor who wishes to steal and plunder his goods, and so on. This,
also, Paul teaches in the following words: For he that loveth another,
hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit whoredom, Thou
shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is
comprehended in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;
therefore charity is the fulfilling of the law (Rom. 8:8-10).

<span class="margnote"><span id="357.">357.</span></span>

Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the
affection of truth from good, from whence comes intelligence with those
who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Levi," in the
highest sense, is signified love and mercy; in the spiritual sense,
charity in act, which is the good of life; and, in the natural sense,
consociation and conjunction. He was named the name also from adhering,
by which, in the Word, is signified conjunction through love. But by
"Levi" is here signified the love or affection of truth, and thence
intelligence, because it follows after Simeon, and in this series forms
the intermediate. Since Levi represented these things, therefore this
tribe was appointed to the priesthood (Num. 3:1 to the end; Deut. 21:5;
and in other places). That the tribe of Levi signifies the love of
truth, which is the essential love from which the church is a church,
and thence intelligence, may appear from these passages: The sons of
Levi are chosen by Jehovah to minister unto Him, and to bless in His
name (Deut. 21:5). "To bless in the name of Jehovah" is to teach; which
they alone can do, who are in the affection of truth, and thence in
intelligence. They guard Thy Word, and kept Thy covenant; they shall
teach Jacob Thy judgments, and Israel Thy law (Deut. 33:8-11). The Lord
shall suddenly come to His temple, and He shall sit as a refiner and
purifier of silver, and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them
as gold and silver (Mal. 3:1, 3). "To purify the sons of Levi," is to
purify those who are in the affection of truth. As that affection
flourishes from intelligence, therefore: The rod of Levi, upon which was
written the name of Aaron, blossomed with almonds (Num. 17:2-11).

<span class="margnote"><span id="358.">358.</span></span>

Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the good
of life with those who will be of the Lord's New Heaven and New Church.
By "Issachar" is signified, in the highest sense, the Divine good of
truth, and the truth of good; in the spiritual sense, celestial
conjugial love, which is the love of good and truth; and, in the natural
sense, remuneration; but here the good of life, because in this class it
is the third in order, and the third in any class signifies the
ultimate, which is produced from the two former, as the effect from its
causes; and the effect from spiritual love, which is love towards the
neighbor, and is signified by Simeon, through the affection of truth,
which is signified by Levi, produces the good of life, which is
"Issachar." He was also named from "hire" (Gen. 30:17, 18), thus from
remuneration, and the good of life has remuneration in itself. Something
of this sort is also signified by Issachar in his blessing by Moses: Be
glad Zebulon in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents. They shall
call the people unto the mountain; there shall they sacrifice the
sacrifices of justice, for they shall suck the abundance of the sea, and
the hidden things concealed in the sand (Deut. 33:18-19). But by
"Issachar," in his blessing by his father Israel (Gen. 49:14, 15) is
signified meritorious good of life, as may be seen in The Arcana
Coelestia, published at London (n. 6388).

<span class="margnote"><span id="359.">359.</span></span>

Verse 8. Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand, signifies
the conjugial love of good and truth also with those who will be of the
Lord's New Heaven and New Church. By "Zebulon," in the highest sense, is
signified the union of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human in the
Lord; in the spiritual sense, the marriage of good and truth with those
who are in heaven and in the church; and, in the natural sense,
conjugial love itself; therefore here, by "Zebulon" is signified the
conjugial love of good and truth; he was also named from "cohabitation"
(Gen. 30:19, 22); and cohabitation is predicated of married partners
whose minds are joined into one, for such conjunction is spiritual
cohabitation. The conjugial love of good and truth, which is here
signified by "Zebulon," is the conjugial love of the Lord and the
church. The Lord is the good of love itself, and gives to the church to
be truth from that good; and cohabitation is effected, when the man of
the church receives good from the Lord in truths. In this case the
marriage of good and truth takes place with man, which is the church
itself, and he becomes a heaven. Hence it is that the kingdom of God,
that is, heaven and the church, is so often compared in the Word to a
marriage.

<span class="margnote"><span id="360.">360.</span></span>

Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the
doctrine of good and truth with those who will be of the Lord's New
Heaven and New Church. By "Joseph" is signified the Lord as to the
spiritual Divine, in the spiritual sense, the spiritual kingdom; and, in
the natural sense, fructification and multiplication; but by "Joseph" is
here signified the doctrine of good and truth, which is with those who
are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. Joseph here has this signification,
because he is named after the tribe of Zebulon, and before the tribe of
Benjamin, thus in the middle; and the tribe which is first named in a
series or class, signifies some love which is of the will; and the tribe
which is named after it signifies something of wisdom which is of the
understanding; and the tribe which is named last signifies some use or
effect derived from them. Thus each series is full. As Joseph signifies
the Lord's spiritual kingdom, therefore he was made ruler in Egypt (Gen.
41:38-44; Psalm 105:17-22); where each particular signifies such things
as are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom. The spiritual kingdom is the
Lord's royalty; and the celestial kingdom is His priesthood. \[2\]
"Joseph," here signifies the doctrine of good and truth, because he is
here in the place of Ephraim; and by "Ephraim" is signified the
intellectual of the church; see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 79); and the intellectual of the
church is all from the doctrine of good and truth from the Word. The
reason why Joseph is here in the place of Ephraim, is because Manasseh,
who was Joseph's other son, and signified the voluntary of the church,
was before reckoned among the tribes (n. 355). The intellectual of the
church being derived from the doctrine of good and truth, therefore that
intellectual, and also that doctrine, are signified by "Joseph" in the
following passages: Joseph is the son of a fruitful one, even a fruitful
one near a fountain; in the strength of his bow he shall sit; he shall
be blessed with the blessings of heaven from above, and with the
blessings of the deep that lieth below (Gen. 49:22-26). "A fountain"
signifies the Word, and "a bow" doctrine (n. 299). Blessed of Jehovah is
the land of Joseph, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and
for the deep lying below; and for the precious things of the products of
the sun, and for the precious things of the products of the moons, and
for the precious things of the earth and its fulness; let it come upon
the head of Joseph (Deut. 33:13-17). By "the precious things" are
signified the knowledges of good and truth, from which is doctrine: Who
drink from bowls of wine, and are not grieved for the breaking of Joseph
(Amos 6:6). And I will make the house of Judah powerful, and I will save
the house of Joseph; and they shall be like mighty Ephraim, and their
heart shall rejoice as through wine (Zech. 10:6-7). Here also "Joseph"
signifies doctrine, and "wine," the truth of it from good (n. 316).

<span class="margnote"><span id="361.">361.</span></span>

Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand, signifies the life
of truth from good according to doctrine, with those who will be in the
Lord's New Heaven and New Church. When by "Zebulon" is signified the
conjugial love of good and truth; and by "Joseph," the doctrine of good
and truth; then by "Benjamin" because he is third in the series, is
signified the life of truth from good. Benjamin has this signification,
because he was born last, and was called by his father Jacob, "the son
of his right hand" (Gen. 35:18), and by the son of the right hand is
signified truth from good; therefore also his tribe dwelt round about
Jerusalem, where the tribe of Judah was, and the city of Jerusalem
signified the church as to doctrine, and its environs the things which
are from doctrine (see Josh. 18:11-28; Jer. 17:26; 32:8, 44; 33:13; and
other places).

<span class="margnote"><span id="362.">362.</span></span>

In the enumeration of the tribes of Israel neither Dan nor Ephraim is
named; the reason is, because Dan was the last of the tribes, and his
tribe dwelt in the most remote part of the land of Canaan, and thus
could not signify anything in the Lord's New Heaven and New Church,
where there will be only celestial and spiritual things; wherefore
Manasseh is put in the place of Dan, while Joseph is put in the place of
Ephraim; see above (n. 360).

<span class="margnote"><span id="363.">363.</span></span>

Verse 9. After this I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no one
could number, signifies all the rest who are not of those enumerated,
and yet are in the Lord's New Heaven and New Church, being those who
make the ultimate heaven and the external church, whose quality no one
knows but the Lord alone. That by "a great multitude" are signified the
rest who are not enumerated above, and yet are in the Lord's Heaven and
Church, is plain from verses 9-10, 13-17, where it is said, that "they
stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and
palms in their hands;" and that "they serve Him in His temple; and He
that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them;" besides many other
things. By "numbering," in the spiritual sense, is signified to know
what or of what quality they are; that such is the signification of
numbering, will be seen in the next paragraph. But who they are in
particular, who are meant by those who are called "a great multitude,"
cannot be known without first revealing an arcanum. The arcanum is this:
\[2\] The whole heaven, together with the church on the earth, before
the Lord, is as one Man; and because it is as one Man, there are those
there who make the head, and thus the face with all its organs of the
senses; and there are those who make the body with all its members.
Those who are enumerated above make the face with all its organs of the
senses; but these now mentioned, are those who make the body with all
its members. That this is the case has been revealed to me; as also,
that they who make the first class of the tribes (verse 5), are those
who correspond to the forehead down to the eyes; that they who are of
the second class (verse 6) are those who correspond to the eyes,
together with the nose; the third class (verse 7), those who correspond
to the ears and cheeks; and the fourth class (verse 8), those who
correspond to the mouth and tongue. \[3\] The Lord's church is also
internal and external; those who are meant by "the twelve tribes of
Israel" are those who make the Lord's internal church, but they who are
now mentioned are those who make the external church, and cohere as one
with those enumerated above, as lower things with higher, thus as the
body does with the head; therefore the twelve tribes of Israel signify
the higher heavens and also the internal church, but these signify the
lower heavens and the external church. That elsewhere these are also
called "a great multitude," see below (n. 803, etc., and 811).

<span class="margnote"><span id="364.">364.</span></span>

"To number," in the spiritual sense, signifies to know the quality,
because a "number" in the Word does not signify a number, but its
quality (n. 10); in this passage therefore, by "a great multitude which
no one could number," in the natural sense, is meant what the words
import, that there was an immense multitude; but in the spiritual sense,
is meant that no one but the Lord alone knows their quality. For the
Lord's heaven consists of innumerable societies, and these societies are
distinguished according to the varieties of affections in general; in
like manner all in each society, are distinguished in particular. The
Lord alone knows the quality of the affection of each individual, and
disposes all in order according thereto. By "numbering," the angels
understand, to know this quality. The same is meant, in the Word, in
these passages: When Belshazzar drank wine out of the vessels of the
temple of Jerusalem, there was written upon the wall, Thou art numbered,
thou art numbered (Dan. 5:2, 5, 25). I shall go to the gates of hell, I
am numbered (Isa. 38:10). A voice of the tumult of the kingdoms, Jehovah
of hosts numbereth the host of war (Isa. 13:4). See, who hath created
these things, that bringeth out their host by number (Isa. 40:26).
Jehovah who numbereth the host of the stars (Ps. 147:4). The flocks
shall pass again under the hands of him that numbereth (Jer. 33:13). My
steps are numbered (Job 14:16). The houses and towers of Zion and of
Jerusalem are numbered (Isa. 22:9-10; 33:18-19; Ps. 48:12-14). To
"number" is to know the quality. From the signification of "numbers" and
of "numbering," it may appear why punishment was denounced against David
for numbering the people or the tribes of Israel, and why he said to the
prophet Gad: I have sinned greatly in what I have done (2 Sam. 24:1, to
the end). And why, when the people were numbered by Moses as to all
their tribes, it was commanded that: Everyone should give an expiation
of his soul to Jehovah in numbering, that there be no plague among them
in numbering them (Exod. 30:12). The reason was, because "to number"
signified to know their quality as to their spiritual state, thus as to
the state of the church meant by "the twelve tribes of Israel," which
the Lord alone knows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="365.">365.</span></span>

Of every nation, and tribes, and peoples, and tongues, signifies all in
the Christian world, who are in religion from good and in truths from
doctrine. By "every nation and tribes," are meant those who are in
religion from good, who are of the lowest heaven (n. 363); by "nations,"
those who are in good (n. 920, 921); and by "tribe," religion (n. 349);
by "peoples and tongues" are meant those who are in truths from
doctrine; by "peoples," those who are in truths (n. 483); and by
"tongue," doctrine (n. 282). By "out of every nation, tribes, peoples,
and tongues," taken together in the spiritual sense, are therefore
signified all who are in religion from good, and in truths from
doctrine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="366.">366.</span></span>

Standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, signifies hearing the
Lord, and doing what He commands. By "standing before God," is signified
to hear and do what He commands, as he who stands before a king. The
same is also signified by "standing before God," in other parts of the
Word; thus: The angel said to Zacharias, I am Gabriel, that standeth
before God (Luke 1:19). There shall not be cut off a man standing before
Me all the days (Jer. 35:19). These are the two sons of oil standing
before the Lord of the whole earth (Zech. 4:14). He hath separated the
tribe of Levi to stand before Jehovah (Deut. 10:8; and in other places).

<span class="margnote"><span id="367.">367.</span></span>

Clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands, signifies
communication and conjunction with the higher heavens, and confession
from Divine truths. That "to be clothed with white robes," signifies to
have communication and conjunction with the heavens, may be seen above
(n. 328). "To hold palms in their hands" signifies confession from
Divine truth because "palms" signify Divine truths; for every tree
signifies something of the church, and "palms" signify the Divine truth
in ultimates, which is the Divine truth of the sense of the letter of
the Word; for this reason: On all the walls of the temple of Jerusalem,
within and without, and also upon the doors, were carved cherubim and
palms (1 Kings 6:29, 32). The same in the new temple, mentioned in
Ezekiel 41:18-20. By "cherubim" is signified the Word (n. 239), and by
"palms" Divine truths therein. That by "palms" are signified the Divine
truths of the Word, and by "palms in their hands" confessions from them,
may appear from its being commanded that: At the feast of tabernacles
they should take fruits of the tree of honor, and leaves of palms, and
should be glad before Jehovah (Lev. 23:39-40). When Jesus went to
Jerusalem to the feast, they took branches of palms, and went to meet
Him, crying, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord (John
12:12-13). By which was signified confession from Divine truths
concerning the Lord. "The palm" signifies Divine truth also in David:
The just shall flourish like the palm, those that be planted in the
house of Jehovah shall grow, he shall spring up in the courts of our God
(Ps. 92:12-13). In like manner in other places. Because Jericho was a
city near Jordan, and by "the river Jordan" was signified that which is
first in the church, and this is the Divine truth, such as it is in the
sense of the letter of the Word, therefore it was called "the city of
palms" (Deut. 34:3; Judg. 1:16; 3:13). For Jordan was the first boundary
or entrance into the land of Canaan, and by the land of Canaan is
signified the church.

Verse 10. And crying with a great voice, saying, Salvation to our God,
that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, signifies the
acknowledgment from the heart that the Lord is their Savior. To cry with
a great voice, signifies acknowledgment from the heart; "Salvation to
our God that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb," signifies that
the Lord is salvation itself, and that the salvation of all is from Him,
thus that He is the Savior. By "Him that sitteth upon the throne and the
Lamb," is meant the Lord alone; by "Him that sitteth upon the throne,"
His Divine from which all things are, and by "the Lamb," His Divine
Human; as may also be seen above (n. 273); they are both named, because
from His Divine, from which all things are by means of His Divine Human,
He was the Saviour; that they are one, is evident from the passages
where it is said: The Lamb in the midst of the throne (Rev. 5:6; 7:17).
The Lord many times in the Word is called "salvation," by which is meant
that He is the Saviour; as: My salvation shall not tarry, and I will
give salvation in Zion (Isa. 46:13). Say ye to the daughter of Zion,
Behold, thy salvation cometh (Isa. 62:11). I will give thee that thou
mayest be My salvation unto the end of the earth (Isa. 49:6). This is
Jehovah whom we have waited for, we will exult and be glad in His
salvation (Isa. 25:9). Salvation, in the Hebrew language, is called
Joschia, which is Jesus.

Verse 11. And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders,
and the four animals, signifies all in the whole heaven hearing and
doing what the Lord commands. By "the animals and elders" are meant the
angels of the higher heavens, as above, and also below (n. 808); but by
"angels" are here meant the angels of the lower heavens, thus all in the
whole heaven. "To stand," signifies to hear and do what He commands (n.
366).

<span class="margnote"><span id="370.">370.</span></span>

And fell before the throne on their faces and adored God, signifies the
humiliation of their heart, and, from humiliation, adoration of the
Lord. That "to fall upon their faces and adore," is humiliation of
heart, and thence adoration, is evident. Humiliation before the Lord and
adoration of Him, is signified by "falling before the throne and adoring
God," because by "God" is meant His Divine, which is the Divine from
which all things are, and at the same time, His Divine Human (n. 368);
for both together are one God, because they are one Person.

<span class="margnote"><span id="371.">371.</span></span>

Verse 12. Saying, Amen, signifies the Divine truth and confirmation
therefrom; as may be seen above (n. 23, 28, 61).

<span class="margnote"><span id="372.">372.</span></span>

Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, signifies the Divine
spiritual things of the Lord. All acknowledgment and confession of the
Lord in general, comprehends these two, that He is the Divine love
itself and the Divine wisdom itself, and consequently that love, and all
that is of it, with those who are in heaven and in the church, is from
Him; in like manner wisdom, and all that is of it. Whatsoever proceeds
from the Lord's Divine love, is called the celestial Divine, and what
from His Divine wisdom, is called the spiritual Divine. The Lord's
spiritual Divine is meant by "glory, wisdom, and thanksgiving;" and His
celestial Divine, by "honor, power, and might," which follow. "The
blessing" which precedes, signifies both, as may be seen above (n. 289).
That "glory" is predicated of the Divine truth, thus of the spiritual
Divine (see n. 249). That "wisdom" has relation to the same, is evident.
That "thanksgiving" has also a like reference, is, because it is
performed from the Divine truth; for man gives thanks from it and by it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="373.">373.</span></span>

And honor, and power, and might, signifies the Lord's celestial Divine.
In the preceding article it is said that these three, "honor, power, and
might," in the Word, when applied to the Lord, are predicated of the
celestial Divine, or the Divine love, or His Divine good. That "honor"
is so predicated, may be seen (n. 249); and "might" (n. 22); and that
"power" is so likewise, may be evident from the passages in the Word
where it is mentioned. It is to be known, that in all the particulars of
the Word there is a marriage of good and truth, and that there are
expressions which have relation to good, and expressions which have
relation to truth; but these expressions can only be distinguished by
those who study the spiritual sense. From that sense it appears what
expressions have relation to good or love, and what to truth or wisdom;
and from many passages it has been given to know, that "honor, power,
and might," occur when it treats of the Divine good. That "power" also
relates to the Divine good may be seen in Matthew 13:54; 24:30; Mark
13:25-26; Luke 1:17, 35; 9:1; 21:27; and elsewhere. That in the
particulars of the Word there is a marriage of the Lord and the church,
and thence a marriage of good and truth, may be seen in The Doctrine of
the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 80-90).

<span class="margnote"><span id="374.">374.</span></span>

Be unto our God for ages of ages, signifies these things in the Lord and
from the Lord to eternity. This is evident from what was said above; and
also that "for ages of ages," is to eternity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="375.">375.</span></span>

Amen, signifies the consent of all. In this verse "Amen" is said at the
beginning, and again at the end; when it is said at the beginning it
signifies truth, and thence confirmation (n. 371); but when at the end,
it signifies the confirmation and consent of all that it is the truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="376.">376.</span></span>

Verse 13. And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, Who are these
that are arrayed in white robes, and whence came they? Verse 14. And I
said unto him, Lord, thou knowest, signifies the desire of knowing, and
the will of interrogating, and the answer and information. The reason
why John was questioned concerning these things, is, because it is
common in all Divine worship, that man should first will, desire, and
pray, and the Lord then answer, inform, and do; otherwise man does not
receive anything Divine. Now as John saw "those who were arrayed in
white robes," and was desirous to know and to ask who they were, and as
this was perceived in heaven, therefore he was first asked and then
informed. The same occurred to the prophet Zechariah, when he saw
several things represented to him, as may appear from Zech. 1:9, 19, 21;
4:2, 5, 11-12; 5:2. 6, 10; 6:4. Besides, we frequently read in the Word,
that the Lord answers when they call and cry; as in Psalms 4:1; 17:6;
20:9; 34:4; 91:15; 120:1; also, that he gives when they ask (Matthew
7:7, 8; 21:22; John 14:13, 14; 15:7; 16:23-27). But yet the Lord gives
them to ask, and what to ask; therefore the Lord knows it beforehand;
but still the Lord wills that man should ask first, to the end that he
may do it as from himself, and thus that it should be appropriated to
him; otherwise, if the petition itself were not from the Lord, it would
not be said in those places, that "they should receive whatsoever they
asked."

<span class="margnote"><span id="377.">377.</span></span>

And he said, These are they that come out of great affliction, signifies
that they are those who have been in temptations, and have fought
against evils and falsities. That "affliction" is infestation from evils
and falsities, and spiritual combat against them, which is temptation
(see n. 33, 95, 100-101).

<span class="margnote"><span id="378.">378.</span></span>

And have washed their robes, signifies, and who have cleansed their
religions principles from the evils of falsity. By "washing," in the
Word, is signified to cleanse from evils and falsities; and by "robes"
are signified general truths (n. 328). General truths are the knowledges
of good and truth from the sense of the letter of the Word, according to
which they have lived, and thence they are religious principles; and as
every religious principle relates to good and truth, therefore robes are
twice mentioned, namely, "they have washed their robes" and "have made
their robes white." "Robes," or religious principles, are cleansed only
with those who fight against evils, and so reject falsities; thus by
temptations, which are signified by "great affliction" (n. 377). That
"to be washed" signifies to be cleansed from evils and falsities, and so
to be reformed and regenerated, may be seen evidently from the following
passages: When the Lord hath washed off the filth of the daughters of
Zion, and hath washed away the blood of Jerusalem by the spirit of
judgment and by the spirit of purifying (Isa. 4:4). Wash you, make you
clean; put away the evil of your doing from Mine eyes; cease to do evil
(Isa. 1:16). Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou
mayest be saved (Jer. 4:14). Wash me from my iniquity, and I shall be
whiter than snow (Ps. 51:2, 7). If thou shouldst wash thee with nitre,
and shouldst take thee much soap, thy iniquity will still retain its
spots (Jer. 2:21). If I should wash me in the waters of snow, and should
cleanse my hands with soap, still my garments shall abhor me (Job
9:30-31). Who washed his garment in wine, his covering in the blood of
grapes (Gen. 49:11). This is said of the celestial church, from which
they are who are in love to the Lord, and in the highest sense it is
concerning the Lord; "wine" and "the blood of grapes" is the Divine
truth spiritual and celestial. I have washed thee with waters, and I
have washed away the blood from off thee (Ezek. 16:9). This is said of
Jerusalem; "waters" are truths, and "bloods" are the adulterations of
truth. \[2\] It may be evident from these things what was represented
and thence signified by the "washings" in the Israelitish church. Aaron
should wash himself before he put on the garments of ministry (Lev.
16:24). And before he drew near to the altar to minister (Exod.
30:18-21; 40:30-31). In like manner the Levites (Num. 8:6-7). In like
manner others, who were made unclean by sins; even that they washed the
vessels (Lev. 11:32; 14:8-9; 15:5-13; 17:15-16; Matt. 23:25-26). They
were sanctified by the washings (Exod. 29:4; 40:12; Lev. 8:6). Naaman of
Syria washed himself in the Jordan (2 Kings 5:10, 14). Therefore: That
they might wash themselves, the brazen sea and many lavers were placed
near the temple (1 Kings 7:23-39). And that the Lord washed the feet of
the disciples (John 13:5-10). And He said to the blind man that he
should wash in the pool of Siloam (John 9:6-7, 11). \[3\] From these
things it may appear that "washing" with the sons of Israel represented
spiritual washing, which is cleansing from evils and falsities, and
thence reformation and regeneration. From what has been said above, it
is also evident what was signified by: The baptism in Jordan by John
(Matt. 3:5-7; Mark 1:4-13). And what by these words of John concerning
the Lord, that: He would baptize with the Holy Spirit and with fire
(Luke 3:16; John 1:33). And of himself, that: He baptized with water
(John 1:26). The meaning of which is, that the Lord washes or purifies
man by the Divine truth and the Divine good, and that John represented
this by his baptism; for the "Holy Spirit" is the Divine truth, "fire"
is the Divine good, and "water" is the representative of both; for
"water" signifies the truth of the Word, which becomes good by a life
according to it (n. 50).

<span class="margnote"><span id="379.">379.</span></span>

And made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb, signifies, and have
purified them from the falsities of evil by truths, and thus are
reformed by the Lord. There are evils of falsity and falsities of evil;
evils of falsity with those who from religion believe that evils do not
condemn, provided they confess with their lips that they are sinners;
and falsities of evil with those who confirm evils in themselves. By
"robes" are here signified general truths from the Word, which
constitute their religious principles as above (n. 378). It is said,
"they made white their robes in the blood of the Lamb," because "white"
is predicated of truths (n. 167, 231, 232); thus, that they purified
falsities by truths. It also signifies that thus they were reformed by
the Lord; because all who have fought against evils in the world, and
have believed in the Lord, after their departure out of the world, are
taught by the Lord, and are withdrawn from the falsities of their
religion by truths, and thus are reformed. The reason is because they
who shun evils as sins are in the good of life; and the good of life
desires truths, and acknowledges and accepts them; but evil of life
never. By "the blood of the Lamb" here, and in other parts of the Word,
it is believed that the Lord's passion of the cross is signified; but
the passion of the cross was the last temptation, by which the Lord
fully conquered the hells, and fully glorified His Human, by which two
He saved man; see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n.
12-14, 15-17;6 also above n. 67). And because the Lord thus fully
glorified His Human, that is made it Divine, therefore nothing else can
be meant by His "flesh," and "blood" but the Divine in Him and from Him;
by "flesh," the Divine good of the Divine love; and by "blood," the
Divine truth from that good. \[2\] "Blood" is mentioned in many places
in the Word, and everywhere signifies, in the spiritual sense, the
Divine truth of the Lord, which also is the Divine truth of the Word;
and, in the opposite sense, the Divine truth of the Word falsified or
profaned, as may appear from the following passages: First: that "blood"
signifies the Divine truth of the Lord or of the Word is manifest from
these considerations: that blood was called "the blood of the covenant,"
and "covenant" is conjunction, and this is effected from the Lord by His
Divine truth; as in Zechariah: By the blood of thy covenant I will send
forth the bound out of the pit (Zech. 9:11). And in Moses: Moses, after
he had read the book of the Law in the ears of the people, sprinkled
half of the blood upon the people, and said, Behold the blood of the
covenant, which Jehovah hath made with you concerning all these Words
(Exod. 24:3-8). And Jesus took the cup, and gave it to them, saying,
Drink ye all of it; for this is My blood, that of the New Covenant
(Matt. 26:27-28; Mark 14:24; Luke 22:20). By "the blood of the New
Covenant" or Testament, nothing else is signified but the Word, which is
called "Covenant" and "Testament," Old and New, thus the Divine truth
therein. \[3\] As this is signified by "blood," therefore the Lord gave
them the wine, saying, "This is my blood"; and "wine" signifies the
Divine truth (n. 316); it is also on this account called "the blood of
grapes" (Gen. 49:11; Deut. 32:14). This is again evident from these
words of the Lord: Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the
flesh of the Son of man, and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.
For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink. He that eateth
My flesh and drinketh My blood, abideth in Me, and I in him (John
6:53-56). That by "blood" is here meant the Divine truth, appears
manifestly, because it is said that he who drinks has life, and abideth
in the Lord, and the Lord in him. That the Divine truth and a life
according to it effects this, and that the Holy Supper confirms it, can
be known in the church. \[4\] Since "blood" signifies the Divine truth
of the Lord, which is also the Divine truth of the Word, and this is the
Old and New Covenant or Testament itself, therefore blood was the most
holy representative in the Israelitish church, in which each and all
things were correspondences of spiritual things; as that: They should
take of the paschal blood, and put it upon the posts and the lintels of
the houses, that the plague might not come upon them (Exod. 12:7, 13,
22). The blood of the burnt-offering should be sprinkled upon the altar,
on the foundations of the altar, upon Aaron, his sons, and their
garments (Exod. 29:12, 16, 20-21; Lev. 1:5; 11, 15; 3:2, 8, 13; 4:25,
30, 34; 5:9; 8:15, 24; 17:6; Num. 18:17; Deut. 12:27). Also upon the
veil which was over the ark, upon the mercy-seat, and upon the horns of
the altar of incense (Lev. 4:6, 7, 17-18; 16:12-15). \[5\] The same is
signified by "the blood of the Lamb" in the following passage in
Revelation: And there was war in heaven; Michael and his angels fought
against the dragon, and overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by
the word of their testimony (Rev. 12:7, 11). For it cannot be thought
that Michael and his angels overcame the dragon by anything else than
the Divine truth of the Lord in the Word; for, in heaven, the angels
cannot think of any blood; nor do they think of the Lord's passion, but
of the Divine truth and of His resurrection. Therefore, when man thinks
of the Lord's blood, the angels perceive His Divine truth; and when he
thinks of the Lord's passion, they perceive His glorification, and then
His resurrection only. It has been granted me to know this by much
experience. \[6\] That "blood" signifies the Divine truth is also
evident from these words in David: God will preserve the souls of the
needy, and precious shall their blood be in His eyes; and they shall
live, and He shall give them of the gold of Sheba (Ps. 72:13-15). "Blood
precious in the eyes of God" is for the Divine truth with them; "the
gold of Sheba" is wisdom from it. In Ezekiel: Gather yourselves together
to the great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat
flesh and drink blood; ye shall drink the blood of the princes of the
earth, and ye shall drink blood even to drunkenness, of My sacrifice
which I sacrifice for you; thus I will give My glory among the nations
(Ezek. 39:17-21). By "blood" here cannot be meant blood, because it is
said that "they shall drink the blood of the princes of the earth," and
that "they shall drink blood even to drunkenness." But the true sense of
the Word results, when by "blood" is understood the Divine truth. The
Lord's church also is there treated of, which He was about to establish
with the Gentiles. \[7\] Secondly: that "blood" signifies the Divine
truth, may be clearly seen from its opposite sense, in which it
signifies the Divine truth of the Word falsified or profaned, as is
evident from the following passages: Who stoppeth his ears lest he hear
of blood, and shutteth his eyes lest he see evil (Isa. 33:15). Thou
shalt destroy them that speak a lie; Jehovah abhorreth the man of blood
and deceit (Ps. 5:6). Everyone that is written for life in Jerusalem
when the Lord shall have washed away the blood thereof from the midst
thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of purifying (Isa.
4:3-4). In the day that thou wast born, I saw thee trampled down in
blood; and I said, In thine own blood live; I washed thee, and washed
away the blood from off thee (Ezek. 16:5-6, 9, 22, 36, 38). The blind
wandered in the streets, they were polluted with blood, and what they
cannot do, they touch with their garments (Lam. 4:13-14). The garment is
polluted with blood (Isa. 9:5). Also in thy skirts is found the blood of
the souls of the innocents (Jer. 2:34). Your hands are full of blood;
wash you, purify you; put away the wickedness of your doings (Isa.
1:15-16). Your hands are polluted with blood, and your fingers with
iniquity; your lips have spoken a lie, they make haste to shed innocent
blood (Isa. 59:3, 7). For Jehovah goeth out to visit the iniquity of the
earth; then the earth shall reveal its blood (Isa. 26:21). As many as
received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, who were
not of blood (John 1:12-13). In Babylon was found the blood of the
prophets and saints (Rev. 18:24). The sea became as the blood of one
dead, and the fountains of waters became blood (Rev. 16:3-4; Isa. 15:9;
Ps. 105:29). The same is signified by the rivers, collections, and lakes
of waters in Egypt being turned into blood (Exod. 7:15, 25). The moon
shall be turned into blood before the great day of Jehovah cometh (Joel
2:31). The moon became blood (Rev. 6:12). In these places, and many
others, "blood" signifies the truth of the Word falsified, and also
profaned; which yet may be seen more manifestly still by reading those
passages in the Word in their series. Since therefore by "blood," in the
opposite sense, is signified the truth of the Word falsified or
profaned, it is evident that by "blood," in the genuine sense, is
signified the truth of the Word not falsified.

<span class="margnote"><span id="380.">380.</span></span>

Verse 15. Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him day
and night in His temple; and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell
among them, signifies that they are in the presence of the Lord, and
constantly and faithfully live according to the truths which they
receive from Him in His church, and that the Lord continually gives good
in their truths. "Therefore are they before the throne of God,"
signifies that they are in the Lord's presence; "and serve Him day and
night," signifies that they constantly and faithfully live according to
the truths, that is, the precepts, which they receive from Him. By
"serving the Lord" nothing else is signified; "in His temple" signifies
in the church (n. 191). "He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among
them," signifies that the Lord continually gives good in the truths
which they receive from Him. That this is signified by "dwelling among
them," is because in the Word, "to dwell" is predicted of good, and "to
serve," of truth. This arcanum now is to be disclosed, that the marriage
of the Lord with the church consists in this: that the Lord flows into
angels and men with the good of love, and that angels and men receive
Him, or the good of His love, in truths; that hereby the marriage of
good and truth is effected, which marriage is the church itself, and
becomes heaven with them. Such being the nature of the Lord's influx and
reception of Him, therefore the Lord looks at angels and men in the
forehead, and they look at the Lord through the eyes; for the forehead
corresponds to the good of love, and the eyes correspond to truths from
that good, which thus by conjunction become the truths of good. But the
Lord's influx with truths into angels and men, is not as the influx of
good into them, for it is mediate, flowing from good, as light does from
fire, being received by them in the understanding, and only so far in
the will as they do truths. This then is the marriage of love and
wisdom, or of good and truth from the Lord, with those who receive them
in the heavens and on earth. This arcanum was disclosed for the sake of
making it known how it is to be understood, that the Lord continually
gives good in their truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="381.">381.</span></span>

Verse 16. They shall not hunger any more, neither thirst anymore
signifies that hereafter there shall be no deficiency of goods and
truths with them. By "not hungering" is signified to have no lack of
good, and by "not thirsting" is signified to have no lack of truth; for
to hunger is predicated of bread and food, and to thirst, of wine and
water; and by "bread" and "food" is signified good and by "wine" and
"water" is signified truth; see above (n. 323).

<span class="margnote"><span id="382.">382.</span></span>

Neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor any heat, signifies that
hereafter they shall not have lusts to evil, nor to the falsity of evil.
"The sun shall not fall upon them," signifies that they shall not have
lusts to evil, "neither shall any heat fall upon them," signifies that
they shall not have lusts to falsity. That "the sun" signifies the
Divine love and thence the affections of good; and, in the opposite
sense, diabolical love and thence lusts to evil, may be seen above (n.
53). But the reason why "heat" signifies lusts to the falsities of evil,
is, because falsity is produced from evil, as heat is from the sun; for
when the will loves evil, the understanding loves falsity, and burns
with the lust of confirming it, and evil confirmed in the understanding,
is the falsity of evil; consequently the falsity of evil is evil in its
form. "Heat" and "to be hot" have a like signification in the following
passages: Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jehovah, he shall not see
when heat cometh (Jer. 17:7-8). For thou hast been a refuge to the needy
from the inundation, a shade from the heat; He tempered the heat with
the shadow of a cloud (Isa. 25:4-5). When they are heated, I will make
them drunken, that they may sleep the sleep of an age (Jer. 51:39). They
are all hot as an oven, there is none among them that calleth unto Me
(Hos. 7:7). He beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. Drought and heat
seize the waters of the snow (Job 24:18-19). The fourth angel poured out
his vial upon the sun; and it was given unto him to scorch men with
great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God (Rev. 16:8-9). To say to
the bound, Go forth; they shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the
heat smite them (Isa. 49:9-10).

<span class="margnote"><span id="383.">383.</span></span>

Verse 17. For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
them, signifies that the Lord alone will teach them. By "the Lamb in the
midst of the throne," is signified the Lord as to His Divine Human in
the inmost, and thus in all things of heaven; "in the midst" is in the
inmost, and thus in all things (n. 44); "the throne" is heaven (n. 14);
and "the Lamb" is the Lord as to His Divine Human (n. 269, 291); and He
who is in the inmost, and thus in all things of heaven, alone feeds,
that is, teaches all. If it be asked, how He alone can feed all, be it
known that it is because He is God, and because in the whole heaven He
is as the soul in its body, for heaven is from Him as one man. "To feed"
is to teach, because the church, in the Word, is called "a flock" and
the men of the church are called "sheep" and "lambs," hence "to feed"
signifies to teach, and "the shepherd" one that teaches; and this in
many places, as: In that day they shall feed the flocks in a wide meadow
(Isa. 30:23). He shall feed his flock like a shepherd (Isa. 40:11). They
shall feed in the ways <span id="fr_39"></span>[383-1](#fn_39.md) and their
pastures shall be in all hillsides (Isa. 49:9). Israel shall feed in
Carmel and Bashan (Jer. 50:19). I will seek my flock, I will feed them
in a good pasture, and in a fat pasture upon the mountains of Israel
(Ezek. 34:12-14). Feed thy people, let them feed in Bashan and Gilead
(Micah. 7:14). The remnant of Israel shall feed, and they shall rest
(Zeph. 3:13). Jehovah is my Shepherd, I shall not want, He maketh me to
lie down in the pastures of herb (Ps. 23:1-2). The Lord hath chosen
David to feed Jacob and Israel, and he fed them (Ps. 78:70-72). Jesus
said to Peter, Feed My lambs, the second and third time He said, Feed My
sheep (John 21:15-17).

And shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, signifies, and lead
them by the truths of the Word to conjunction with Himself. Since by "a
living fountain of waters" is signified the Lord, and also the Word, and
by "waters" are signified truths (n. 50), and since by the Divine truths
of the Word, when they are made of the life, which is done when one
lives according to them, conjunction is effected with the Lord,
therefore by "leading them to living fountains of waters," is signified
to lead by the truths of the Word to conjunction with the Lord. That by
"a fountain" and "fountains" is signified the Lord, and also the Word,
is evident from these passages: All my fountains are in Thee, O Jehovah
(Ps. 87:7). They have deserted Jehovah, the fountain of living waters
(Jer. 17:13). The people deserted Me the fountain of living waters (Jer.
2:13). Thou makest them drink of the river of pleasures, for with Thee
is the fountain of life (Ps. 36:8-9). In that day shall a fountain be
opened to the inhabitants of Jerusalem (Zech. 13:1). Israel dwelt
securely solitary at the fountain of Jacob (Deut. 33:28). When the Lord
sat at the fountain of Jacob, He said to the woman, The water that I
shall give shall become a fountain of water springing up into eternal
life (John 4:5-20). Joseph is the son of a fruitful one near a fountain
(Gen. 49:22). Bless the Lord from the fountain of Israel (Ps. 68:26).
Then with joy shall ye draw waters from the fountains of salvation (Isa.
12:3). Unto him that thirsteth I will give of the fountain of the water
of life freely (Rev. 21:6). I will lead them to the fountains of waters
in a straight way (Jer. 31:9). Similar to these and the above in
Revelation, are said also in Isaiah: They shall not hunger nor thirst,
neither shall the heat smite them, for He that hath mercy on them shall
lead them even to the fountains of waters (Isa. 49:10).

And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, signifies that they
shall no longer be in combats against evils and their falsities, and
thus not in grief, but in goods and truths, and thence in celestial joys
from the Lord. That these things are signified by the Lamb "wiping away
every tear from their eyes," is, because above (in verse 14), it is
said, that "these are they which come out of great affliction," by which
is signified that they are those who have been in temptations, and have
fought against evils (n. 377); and who afterwards are not in combats
against evils, the same are in goods and truths, and thence in celestial
joys. The following passage in Isaiah has a similar signification: He
will swallow up death forever, and the Lord Jehovah will wipe away the
tears from all faces. Then they shall say in that day, Behold this is
our God, whom we have waited for that He might deliver us; This is
Jehovah, whom we have waited for, we will exult and be glad in His
salvation (Isa. 25:8-9).

To the above I will add this Relation. Once when I looked around in the
spiritual world, I heard as it were the gnashing of teeth, and also as
it were a knocking, and mixed with them a grating sound; and I inquired
what they were. And the angels who were with me said, "There are
colleges which are called by us diversoria, where disputations are
carried on. These disputations are so heard at a distance, but on coming
near to them they are only heard as disputations." I drew near and saw
small houses, constructed of reeds plastered with mud. And I desired to
look in through a window, but there was none; for it was not allowed to
enter through the door, because the light from heaven would flow in and
confuse them. But suddenly a window was made on the right side; and then
I heard them complain that they were in darkness. Shortly afterwards a
window was made on the left side, and that on the right was closed; upon
which the darkness gradually dispersed, and they seemed to themselves to
be in the light. After this I was permitted to go in through the door
and hear. There was a table in the middle, and benches round about; but
they all seemed to me to stand upon the benches, and to dispute sharply
with one another concerning Faith and Charity: on one side, that faith
was the principal thing of the church; on the other, that charity was.
They who made faith the principal, said, "Have we not to do with God by
faith, and with man by charity? Is not faith therefore heavenly, and
charity earthly? Are we not saved by what is heavenly, and not by what
is earthly? Again, cannot God give faith from heaven, because it is
heavenly, and must not man procure to himself charity, because it is
earthly? And what man procures for himself, is not of the church, and
therefore does not save? Can anyone be justified in the sight of God by
works, which are called works of charity? Believe us, we are not only
justified, but also sanctified by faith alone, provided that faith be
not defiled by things meritorious, which are from the works of charity."
Besides many more things. \[2\] But they who made charity the principal
thing of the church, sharply refuted these things, saying, "That charity
saves, and not faith; are not all dear to God, and does He not will the
good of all? How can God effect this, except by men? Does God only give
to men to talk with one another about such things as relate to faith?
and does He not give to men to do those things which are of charity? Do
you not see that it is absurd in you to say that charity is earthly?
Charity is heavenly, and because you do not do the good of charity, your
faith is earthly. How do you receive faith but as a stock or a stone?
You say by the hearing of the Word only. But how can the Word operate by
being heard only, and this too upon a stock or a stone? Perhaps you are
vivified without knowing it; but what is this vivification except in
being enabled to say that faith alone saves? But what faith is, and what
saving faith, you do not know." \[3\] But there then arose one, who, by
the angel that was talking with me, was called a Syncretist. He took off
a turban from his head, and placed it on the table; but suddenly put it
on again, because he was bald. He said, "Attend! you are all in error;
it is true that faith is spiritual, and charity, moral; but yet they are
joined together; and this by the Word, by the Holy Spirit, and by
effect, without man's knowledge, which indeed may be called obedience,
but in which man has no part. I have thought of these things with myself
for a long time, and have at length discovered, that man may receive
faith from God, which is spiritual, but that he cannot be moved by God
to charity, which is spiritual, except as a pillar of salt." \[4\]
Having said this, he was applauded by those who were in faith alone, but
hooted by those who were in charity; and the latter said, with
indignation, "Hear, friend; you do not know that there is a moral life
which is spiritual, and that there is a moral life merely natural; a
moral life which is spiritual with those who do good from God, and yet
as if from themselves; and a moral life merely natural with those who do
good from hell, and yet as if from themselves." \[5\] It was said that
the disputation was heard as a gnashing of teeth, and as a knocking,
with which a grating sound was mixed. The disputation heard as a
gnashing of teeth, was by those who were in faith alone; but the
disputation heard as a knocking, was by those who were in charity alone;
and the grating sound that was mixed with them was from the Syncretist.
The sounds of them were so heard at a distance, because when in the
world, they all spent their time in disputations and did not shun any
evil, and therefore they did not do any spiritual moral good; and,
moreover, they were entirely ignorant that the all of faith is truth,
and the all of charity, good, and that truth without good is not truth
in spirit, and that good without truth is not good in spirit, and that
thus one must make the other. The reason why there was darkness when a
window was made on the right side, is because light from heaven flowing
in on that side affects the will; and the reason why there was light
when the window on the right side was shut, and another was made in the
left, is because light flowing in from heaven on the left side affects
the understanding, and every man may be in the light of heaven as to his
understanding, provided the will be closed as to its evil.

Revelation 8 1. And when He had opened the seventh seal, there was
silence in heaven as of half an hour. 2. And I saw the seven angels, who
stood before God; and there were given to them seven trumpets. 3. And
another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and
there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the
prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the
throne. 4. And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the
saints out of the hand of the angel before God. 5. And the angel took
the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and cast it unto
the earth: and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an
earthquake. 6. And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound. 7. And the first angel sounded, and there became
hail and fire, mingled with blood; and they were cast upon the earth;
and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was
burnt up. 8. And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great
mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of
the sea became blood. 9. And the third part of the creatures which were
in the sea that had souls died; and the third part of the ships
perished. 10. And the third angel sounded, and there fell from heaven a
great star burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of
the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters. 11. And the name of the
star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became
wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made
bitter. 12. And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun
was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the
stars; so that the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone
not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. 13. And I saw, and I
heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a great voice,
Woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell on the earth, by reason of the other
voices of the trumpet of the three angels that are about to sound. THE
SPIRITUAL SENSE The contents of the whole chapter The church of the
Reformed is here treated of, as to the quality of those therein who are
in faith alone: the preparation of the spiritual heaven for
communication with them (verses 1-6). The exploration and manifestation
of those therein, who are in the interiors of that faith (verse 7). Of
those who are in its exteriors (verses 8-9). What they are as to the
understanding of the Word (verses 10-11). That they are in falsities and
thence in evils (verses 12-13). The contents of each verse Verse 1. "And
when He had opened the seventh seal," signifies exploration by the Lord
of the state of the church, and thence of the life of those who are in
His spiritual kingdom, being those who are in charity and its faith, in
this case who are in faith alone (n. 388). "There was silence in heaven
as of half an hour," signifies that the angels of the Lord's spiritual
kingdom were greatly amazed when they saw those who said they were in
the faith in such a state (n. 389). Verse 2. "And I saw the seven angels
who stood before God," signifies the entire spiritual heaven in the
presence of the Lord, hearing and doing what He commands (n. 390). "And
there were given to them seven trumpets," signifies the exploration and
disclosure of the state of the church, and thence of the life of those
who are in faith alone (n. 391). Verse 3. "And another angel came and
stood at the altar, having a golden censer," signifies spiritual
worship, which is from the good of charity by the truths of faith (n.
392). "And there was given him much incense, that he should offer it
with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was
before the throne," signifies propitiation lest the angels of the Lord's
spiritual kingdom should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom
that were below (n. 393). Verse 4. "And the smoke of the incense went up
with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel before God,"
signifies the protection of them by the Lord (n. 394). Verse 5. "And the
angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of the altar, and
cast it unto the earth," signifies spiritual love, in which is celestial
love, and its influx into lower things, where they were who were in
faith separated from charity (n. 395). "And there were voices, and
thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake," signifies that after
communication was opened with them, there were heard reasonings
concerning faith alone, and confirmations in favor of it (n. 396). Verse
6. "And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared themselves
to sound," signifies that they were prepared and girded to explore the
state of the church and thence the state of life with those whose
religion is faith alone (n. 397). Verse 7. "The first angel sounded,"
signifies the exploration and manifestation of the quality of the state
of the church with those who are interiorly in that faith (n. 398). "And
there became hail and fire mingled with blood," signifies falsity from
infernal love destroying good and truth, and falsifying the Word (n.
399). "And they were cast upon the earth, and the third part of the
trees was burnt up," signifies that with them, every affection and
perception of truth, which constitute the man of the church, had
perished (n. 400). "And all green grass was burnt up," signifies thus
every living thing of faith (n. 401). Verse 8. "And the second angel
sounded," signifies the exploration and manifestation of what the state
of the church is with those who are exteriorly in that faith (n. 402).
"And as it were a mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea,"
signifies the appearance of infernal love with them (n. 403). "And the
third part of the sea became blood," signifies that all general truths
with them were falsified (n. 404). Verse 9. "And the third part of the
creatures which were in the sea that had souls, died," signifies that
they who have lived and do live this faith cannot be reformed and
receive life (n. 405). "And the third part of the ships perished,"
signifies that all the knowledges of good and truth from the Word,
serving for the use of life, were destroyed with them (n. 406). Verse
10. "And the third angel sounded," signifies the exploration and
manifestation of the state of the church with those whose religion is
faith alone, as to the affection and reception of truths from the Word
(n. 407). "And there fell from heaven a great star, burning as it were a
lamp," signifies the appearance of their own intelligence from pride
arising from infernal love (n. 408). "And it fell upon the third part of
the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters," signifies that thence all
the truths of the Word were altogether falsified (n. 409). Verse 11.
"And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the
waters became wormwood," signifies the infernal falsity from which their
own intelligence is derived, by which all the truths of the Word are
falsified (n. 410). "And many men died of the waters, because they were
made bitter," signifies the extinction of spiritual life from the
falsified truths of the Word (n. 411). Verse 12. "And the fourth angel
sounded," signifies the exploration and manifestation of the state of
the church with those whose religion is faith alone, as being in the
evils of falsity, and in the falsities of evil (n. 412). "And the third
part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the
third part of the stars, and the third part of them was darkened,"
signifies that by reason of evils from falsities and of falsities from
evils, they did not know what love is, or what faith is, or any truth
(n. 413). "And the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night
likewise," signifies that there is no longer any spiritual truth nor
natural truth serviceable for doctrine and life from the Word with them
(n. 414). Verse 13. "And I saw, and I heard an angel flying in the midst
of heaven," signifies instruction and prediction from the Lord (n. 415).
"Saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell on the
earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels
which are about to sound," signifies the deepest lamentation over the
damned state of those in the church, who in doctrine and life have
confirmed themselves in faith separate from charity (n. 416). THE
EXPLANATION There are two kingdoms into which the entire heaven is
divided, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. The celestial
kingdom consists of those who are in love to the Lord and thence in
wisdom; and the spiritual kingdom consists of those who are in love
towards the neighbor, and thence in intelligence; and as love towards
the neighbor is at this day called "charity" and intelligence, "faith,"
the latter kingdom consists of those who are in charity, and thence in
faith. Now, because heaven is distinguished into two kingdoms, hell also
is distinguished into two kingdoms that are opposite to them; into the
diabolical kingdom and into the satanic kingdom. The diabolical kingdom
consists of those who are in the love of dominion from love of self and
thence in foolishness; for this love is opposite to celestial love, and
its foolishness is opposite to celestial wisdom; but the satanic kingdom
consists of those who are in the love of dominion from the pride of
their own intelligence, and thence in insanity; for this love is
opposite to spiritual love, and its insanity is opposite to spiritual
intelligence. By foolishness and insanity are meant foolishness and
insanity in things celestial and spiritual. Similar things are to be
understood of the church on earth as are said of heaven, for they make
one. Concerning these two kingdoms, see the work on Heaven and Hell,
published at London (n. 20-28), and see also many other places. \[2\]
Now, as Revelation treats only of the state of the church at its end (as
was observed in the preface, and at n. 2), therefore what now follows
treats of those who are in the two kingdoms of heaven, and of those who
are in the two kingdoms of hell, and of their quality. From this chapter
(Rev. 8:8-16), of those who are in the spiritual kingdom, and in the
satanic kingdom opposite to it; in chapters 17-18, of those who are in
the celestial kingdom, and in the diabolical kingdom opposite to it; and
afterwards of the Last Judgment; and at length of the New Church which
is the New Jerusalem; this bringing all that goes before to a
conclusion, because it is the end on account of which they are. In many
parts of the Word "the Devil" and "Satan" are mentioned, and by both is
meant hell; it is so named, because all in one hell are called devils,
and all in the other are called satans.

<span class="margnote"><span id="388.">388.</span></span>

Verse 1. And when He had opened the seventh seal, signifies exploration
by the Lord of the state of the church, and thence of the state of life
of those who are in His spiritual kingdom, being those who are in
charity and its faith; in this case, who are in faith alone. That this
is the signification of these words, may appear from all the particulars
of this chapter when understood in the spiritual sense. For this chapter
and the following to chapter 16 treat of those who are in the spiritual
kingdom, or those who are in love towards the neighbor and thence in
intelligence, as was said above (n. 387). But since, at this day, they
say "charity" instead of love towards the neighbor, and "faith" instead
of intelligence; and here there is not any exploration of those who are
in charity and thence in faith, because these belong to such as are in
heaven; therefore exploration is here made of those who are in faith
alone. Faith alone is also faith separated from charity, there being no
conjunction (see below, n. 417). That "to open the seal" signifies to
explore states of life, or, what is the same thing, the states of the
church and thence of life, see above, n. 295, 302, 309, 317, 324.

<span class="margnote"><span id="389.">389.</span></span>

There was silence in heaven as of half an hour, signifies that the
angels of the Lord's spiritual kingdom were greatly amazed, when they
saw those who said they were in faith, in such a state. By "silence in
heaven," nothing else is meant but amazement there in regard to those
who say they are in faith, and yet are in such a state; for their state
is described in what follows, the quality of which can be seen from the
explanation. By "half an hour" is signified greatly, because by "an
hour" is signified a full state. That "time" signifies state, will be
seen below.

<span class="margnote"><span id="390.">390.</span></span>

Verse 2. And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, signifies the
entire spiritual heaven in the presence of the Lord, hearing and doing
what He commands. By "seven angels" is signified the entire heaven,
because "seven" signifies all, or all things, thence the whole and
entire (n. 10); and by "angels," in the highest sense, is signified the
Lord, and, in a relative sense, heaven (n. 5, 65, 342, 344); here, the
spiritual heaven, as may appear from what was said above (n. 387, 388).
That "to stand before God" signifies to hear and do what He commands,
see above (n. 366).

<span class="margnote"><span id="391.">391.</span></span>

And there were given to them seven trumpets, signifies the exploration
and disclosure of the state of the church, and thence of the life of
those who are in faith alone. Here, by "trumpets" the same thing is
signified as by "sounding," because they sounded with them, and by
"sounding with trumpets" is signified to call together upon solemn
occasions, which were various; in this case, to explore and discover the
quality of those who are in faith alone, thus the quality of those who
are at this day of the churches of the Reformed. It should be known,
that the church in the Reformed world is at this day divided into three,
from the three leaders, Luther, Calvin, and Melancthon, and that these
three churches differ in various things; but in this article, that man
is justified by faith without the works of the law, they all agree,
which is remarkable. That by "sounding with trumpets" is signified to
call together, will be seen below (n. 397).

<span class="margnote"><span id="392.">392.</span></span>

Verse 3. And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden
censer, signifies spiritual worship, which is from the good of charity
by the truths of faith. By "the altar" at which the angel stood, and by
"the golden censer" which he had in his hand, is signified the worship
of the Lord from spiritual love, which worship is from the good of
charity by the truths of faith. With the sons of Israel there were two
altars, one without the tent, and the other within it; the altar without
the tent was called "the altar of burnt-offering," because
burnt-offerings and sacrifices were offered upon it. The altar within
the tent was called "the altar of incense," as also "the golden altar."
There were two altars, because the worship of the Lord is from celestial
love and from spiritual love; from celestial love by those who are in
His celestial kingdom, and from spiritual love by those who are in His
spiritual kingdom; concerning these two kingdoms, see above (n. 387).
Concerning the two altars, see the following passages in Moses:
concerning the altar of burnt offering see Exod. 20:24-26; 27:1-8;
39:38-39; Lev. 7:1-5; 8:11; 16:18, 19, 33-34; concerning the altar of
incense see Exod. 30:1-10; 31:8; 37:25-29; 40:5-26; Num. 7:1. That
altars, censers, and incense, were seen by John, was not because such
things exist in heaven, these were only representative of the worship of
the Lord there; the reason is, because such things were instituted among
the sons of Israel, and are therefore often mentioned in the Word; and
that church was a representative church, for all things of their worship
represented and thence they now signify the Divine celestial and
spiritual things of the Lord, which are of His church in the heavens and
on the earth. \[2\] The same is therefore signified by the two altars
spoken of in the Word, in the following passages: O send out Thy light
and Thy truth, let them lead me to Thy habitation, and I will go to the
altar of God, unto God (Ps. 43:3-4). I will wash my hands in innocence;
and so will I compass Thy altar, O Jehovah; and I will make the voice of
thanksgiving to be heard (Ps. 26:6-7). The sin of Judah is written with
a pen of iron upon the tablet of their heart, and upon the horns of your
altars (Jer. 17:1-2). God is Jehovah, Who enlighteneth us; bind the
festal-offering with cords unto the horns of the altar (Ps. 118:27). In
that day shall there be an altar in the midst of the land of Egypt (Isa.
19:19). "The altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt,"
signifies the worship of the Lord from love in the natural man. The
thistle and the thorn shall come up upon their altars (Hos. 10:8). By
this is signified worship from evil and from the falsities of evil.
(Besides other places; as Isaiah 27:9; 56:6, 7; 60:7; Lamentations 2:7;
Ezekiel 6:4-6, 13; Hosea 8:11; 10:1, 2; Amos 3:14; Psalms 51:19; 84:3;
Matthew 5:23, 24; 23:18-20). \[3\] Since the worship of the Lord was
represented and thence signified by "the altar," it is evident that by
"altar" here in Revelation nothing else is meant, and also elsewhere;
as: I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the Word
of God (Rev. 6:9). The angel stood and said, Measure the temple of God
and the altar, and them that adore therein (Rev. 11:1). I heard another
angel from the altar, saying, True and just are Thy judgments (Rev.
16:7). Since representative worship, which was performed chiefly upon
two altars, was abrogated by the Lord when He came into the world,
because He Himself opened the interiors of the church; therefore it is
said in Isaiah: In that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes
shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel, and not to the altars, the
work of his hands (Isa. 17:7-8).

<span class="margnote"><span id="393.">393.</span></span>

And there was given him much incense, that he should offer it with the
prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the
throne, signifies propitiation lest the angels of the Lord's spiritual
kingdom should be hurt by the spirits of the satanic kingdom, that were
below. By "the incense" and by "the golden altar" is signified the
worship of the Lord from spiritual love (n. 277, 392); by "prayers" are
signified those things which relate to charity and thence to faith in
worship (n. 278); and by "saints" are meant those who are of the Lord's
spiritual kingdom; and by "the just," those who are of His celestial
kingdom (n. 173). From this it may appear, that they who are in the
Lord's spiritual kingdom are here treated of. That here "much incense
offered with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar"
signifies propitiation lest they should be hurt by the spirits of the
satanic kingdom who were below, because propitiations and expiations
were made by incense, especially when dangers threatened; as may appear
from the following passages: When the congregation murmured against
Moses and Aaron, and were affected with a plague, Aaron took fire from
the altar, and put incense into a censer, and ran between the living and
the dead to expiate, and the plague was stayed (Num. 16:42-50). The
altar of incense was also placed in the tent, before the mercy-seat that
was over the ark, and incense was offered on it every morning when the
lamps were trimmed (Exod. 30:1-10). And it was commanded, that as often
as Aaron entered within the veil, he should offer incense, and the cloud
of incense should cover the mercy-seat, lest he should die (Lev.
16:11-13). From these things it may appear, that propitiations in the
representative Israelitish church were made by offering incense; in like
manner here, that they might not be hurt by the satanic spirits who were
below.

<span class="margnote"><span id="394.">394.</span></span>

Verse 4. And the smoke of the incense went with the prayers of the
saints, out of the hand of the angel before God, signifies the
protection of them by the Lord. By "the smoke of the incense went up
before God" is signified what is accepted and grateful; wherefore the
like is said by David: Let my prayers be accepted before Thee as incense
(Ps. 141:2). The reason was, because the smoke of the incense was
fragrant from the aromatics of which it was composed, which were stacte,
onycha, galbanum, and frankincense (Exodus 30:34); and the fragrance of
those aromatics corresponds to such things as are of spiritual love or
charity, and thence of faith; for in heaven most fragrant odors are
sensibly perceived corresponding to the perceptions of the angels
originating from their love. Therefore it is also said in many parts of
the Word, that "Jehovah smelled an odor of rest." That protection by the
Lord is signified, follows from what was said above (n. 393).

<span class="margnote"><span id="395.">395.</span></span>

Verse 5. And the angel took the censer, and filled it with the fire of
the altar, and cast it unto the earth, signifies spiritual love, in
which is celestial love, and its influx into the lower parts, where they
were who are in faith separated from charity. That by "a censer," as
well as by "incense," is signified worship from spiritual love, is
evident from what was shown above; and also from this, that in the Word,
the thing containing signifies the same as the thing contained, as a cup
and platter signify the same as wine and food (Matthew 23:25, 26; Luke
22:20; and in other places). By "the fire of the altar of
burnt-offering," is signified the Divine celestial love, because by that
altar was signified worship from that love, as may be seen above (n.
392); and by "fire," in the highest sense, is signified the Divine love
(n. 494). Spiritual love, which is charity, derives its essence from
celestial love, which is love to the Lord; without this love there is
nothing vital in spiritual love or charity, for spirit and life is from
no other source than from the Lord. This was represented in the
Israelitish church by their taking fire for the censers when they
offered incense, only from the altar of burnt-offering; as may appear in
Moses (Leviticus 16:12-13, Numbers 16:46-47); and that: The two sons of
Aaron were consumed by fire from heaven, because they offered incense
from strange fire (that is, from fire not taken from the altar) (Lev.
10:1-2). Therefore it was also ordained, that: Fire should burn
continually on the altar of burnt-offering, and should not be put out
(Lev. 6:13). This was because the fire of that altar signified the
Divine love of the Lord, and thence love to the Lord. By "casting the
censer upon the earth" is signified influx into lower things.

And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings and an earthquake,
signifies that after communication was opened with them, there were
heard reasonings concerning faith alone, and confirmations in favor of
it, and that the state of the church with them was perceived to be
tottering to destruction. That "lightnings, thunders, and voices,"
signify enlightenments, perceptions, and instructions, by influx from
heaven (see above, n. 236); but here, with those who were in faith
alone, who have no enlightenment, perception, and instruction by influx
from heaven, by voices, thunders, and lightnings, are signified
reasonings about faith alone, and arguments and confirmations in favor
of it; by "earthquakes" are signified changes of the state of the church
(n. 331), in this case, that the state of the church among them was
perceived to be tottering to destruction. For earthquakes take place in
the world of spirits, when the state of the church in the societies is
perverted and inverted. The reason why the censer was cast unto the
earth by the angel, before the seven angels began to sound with the
trumpets, was that by influx communication might be opened between those
who were in the spiritual heaven, with those below who were in faith
alone; from which communication there arose reasonings and confirmations
in favor of it, which were also heard and perceived; wherefore it is
said that after communication was opened, they were heard and perceived.

<span class="margnote"><span id="397.">397.</span></span>

Verse 6. And the seven angels that had the seven trumpets prepared
themselves to sound, signifies that they were prepared and girded to
explore the state of the church, and thence the state of life, with
those whose religion is faith alone. What is signified by "trumpets,"
appears from the statute respecting the use of them with the sons of
Israel, concerning which it is thus written in Moses: Jehovah spake unto
Moses to make trumpets of silver for the calling of the assembly, and
for the journeying of the camps; and that they should sound with them on
days of joy, festivals, new moons, over burnt-offerings and sacrifices;
also, that when they went to war against enemies that infested them,
they should blow an alarm with the trumpets, and that then they should
come into remembrance before Jehovah God, and should be preserved from
their enemies (Num. 10:1-10). From these words it may be seen what is
signified by "sounding with trumpets." That here by "the seven angels
sounding," is signified the exploration and manifestation of what the
state of the church is with those whose religion is faith alone, is
evident from the particulars of this chapter, and from the particulars
of the chapters that follow as far as the sixteenth inclusive, when
understood in the spiritual sense. \[2\] From the use of trumpets with
the sons of Israel may also be seen what is signified by "trumpets," and
by "sounding with them," in the following passages: Sound ye the trumpet
in Zion, and sound in the mountain of holiness, for the day of Jehovah
cometh (Joel 2:1-2). Jehovah shall appear upon them, and His arrow shall
go forth as the lightning, and the Lord Jehovih shall sound the trumpet
(Zech. 9:14). Jehovah shall go forth as a lion and sound (Isa. 42:13).
In that day the great trumpet shall be sounded, and they shall come that
are perishing in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of
Egypt, and shall bow themselves down to Jehovah in the mountain of
holiness (Isa. 27:13). He shall send His angels with a great sound of a
trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,
from one end of heaven to the other (Matt. 24:31). Happy is the people
who know the sound; they shall walk, O Jehovah, in the light of Thy
countenance (Ps. 89:15). When the morning stars sing, and the sons of
God sound (Job 38:7). \[3\] Since "the sounds of trumpets" signify such
things, and as, in the Israelitish Church, all things were represented
to the life according to correspondences and thence significations,
therefore it came to pass: When Jehovah came down upon Mount Sinai, that
there were voices, and lightnings, and a heavy cloud, and a vehement
voice of a trumpet, and the voice of the trumpet going and strengthening
itself greatly, and the people in the camp trembled exceedingly (Exod.
19:16-25). And for the same reason it came to pass: When the three
hundred with Gideon sounded with the trumpets against Midian, then the
sword of a man was against his companion, and they fled away (Judges
7:16-22). In like manner, that: Twelve thousand of the sons of Israel
with vessels of holiness and trumpets in their hands overcame Midian
(Num. 31:1-8). As also that: The wall of Jericho fell down, after the
seven priests with seven trumpets compassed the city seven times (Josh.
6:1-20). Wherefore it is said in Jeremiah: Sound against Babylon round
about, her walls are destroyed (Jer. 50:15). And in Zephaniah: A day of
darkness and thick darkness, a day of the trumpet and sounding against
the fortified cities (Zeph. 1:15-16).

Verse 7. And the first angel sounded, signifies exploration and
manifestation of the quality of the state of the church with those who
are interiorly in that faith. By "sounding" is signified to explore and
make manifest (n. 397). The reason why by "the sounding of this first
angel," is meant the exploration and manifestation of the state of the
church with those who are interiorly in that faith, is, because its
operation was directed upon "the earth," as appears from what follows;
and the operation of the sounding of the second angel was into "the
sea," and by "the earth and the sea," throughout Revelation, when named
together, is meant the entire church; by "the earth," the church
consisting of those who are in its internals, and by "the sea," the
church consisting of those who are in its externals: for the church is
internal and external; internal with the clergy, and external with the
laity; or internal with those who have studied its doctrinals
interiorly, and have confirmed them from the Word, and external with
those who have not. \[2\] Both are meant by "the earth and the sea" in
the following passages in Revelation: That the wind should not blow upon
the earth, nor on the sea (Rev. 7:1). Hurt not the earth, neither the
sea (Rev. 7:3). The angel descending out of heaven set his right foot
upon the sea, and his left upon the earth (Rev. 10:2, 8; also in Rev.
7:5). I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, and another beast coming
up out of the earth (Rev. 13:1, 11). Praise God who made the heaven, the
earth, and the sea (Rev. 14:7). The first angel poured out his vial upon
the earth, and the second angel his upon the sea (Rev. 16:2-3). "The
earth and the sea" signify the church internal and external, thus the
entire church, because, in the spiritual world, they who are in the
internals of the church appear upon dry land, and they who are in its
externals, as in the seas; but the seas are appearances from the general
truths in which they are. That "earth" signifies the church, may be seen
(n. 285); so also "the world" (n. 551).

And there became hail and fire mingled with blood, signifies falsity
from infernal love destroying good and truth, and falsifying the Word.
By "hail" is signified falsity destroying good and truth; by "fire" is
signified infernal love; and by "blood" is signified the falsification
of truth. That "hail" signifies falsity destroying good and truth, will
be seen below; that "fire" is love in both senses, celestial and
infernal, may be seen (n. 468); that blood is the Divine truth of the
Lord, which is also the Word, and, in the opposite sense, the Word
falsified (n. 379). On joining these together into one sense, it is
plain, that by "there became hail and fire mingled with blood," is
signified falsity from infernal love destroying good and truth and
falsifying the Word. This is signified, because such things appear in
the spiritual world when the sphere of the Lord's Divine love and Divine
wisdom descends from heaven into the societies below, where there are
falsities from infernal love, and the Word is falsified thereby. \[2\]
"Hail" and "fire" together have a like signification in the following
passages: At the brightness before Him the clouds passed by, hailstones
and coals of fire; the Most High gave a voice, hailstones and coals of
fire; and He sent out His many arrows and scattered them (Ps. 18:12-14).
And I will plead with pestilence and blood, and I will make to rain upon
them hailstones, fire, and brimstone (Ezek. 38:22). And Jehovah shall
cause His voice to be heard, in the flame of a devouring fire and
hailstone (Isa. 30:30). He gave them hail for their rains, the fire of
flames in their land, and broke the tree of their coasts (Ps.
105:32-33). The hail smote their vine, and their sycamore trees with
grievous hail, and their cattle with burning coals; in the wrath of His
anger He sent an incursion of evil angels (Ps. 78:47-49). These words
are applied to Egypt. Concerning them it is thus written in Moses: Moses
stretched forth his rod, and Jehovah gave voices and hail; and there was
hail and fire together walking in the midst of the grievous hail; and
the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the
field (Exod. 9:23-35). All the miracles that were wrought in Egypt
signified the evils and falsities from infernal love, which were with
the Egyptians; each miracle signifying some particular evil and falsity:
for with them was a representative church, as in many kingdoms of Asia,
but it became idolatrous and magical; by the "Red Sea" is signified
hell, in which at last they perished. \[3\] Something similar is
signified by: The hailstones, by which more of the enemy perished than
by the sword (Josh. 10:11). The same, also, is meant by "hail" in the
following passages: Woe to the crown of pride, the Lord is strong, like
an inundation of hail; the hail overturneth the refuge of lies (Isa.
28:1-2, 17). It shall hail, until the forest sinketh itself down (Isa.
32:19). The temple of God was opened in heaven, and there were
lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail
(Rev. 11:19). And there came down upon men out of heaven a great hail,
about the weight of a talent (Rev. 16:21). Hast thou seen the treasures
of hail which I have reserved unto the day of battle and war? (Job
38:22-23). Say unto them which daub with what is unfit, that it shall
fall; there shall be an inundating rain, in which you, O hailstones,
shall fall (Ezek. 13:11). "To daub with what is unfit" is to confirm
falsity that it may appear like truth; they therefore who do so are
called "hailstones."

And they were cast upon the earth, and the third part of the trees was
burnt up, signifies that with those who are in the internals of the
church and in faith alone, every affection and perception of truth,
which make the man of the church, perished. By "the earth," upon which
were cast "hail and fire mingled with blood," is signified the church
with those who are in its internals, and in faith alone. That these are
the clergy, may be seen above (n. 398). By "the third part" is signified
all as to truth, as by "the fourth part," all as to good (n. 322). That
by "three" is signified all, full, and altogether, will be seen below
(n. 505); thence, by "a third," which is "a third part," the same is
signified. By "being burnt up" is signified to perish, here by falsity
from infernal love, which is meant by "hail and fire mingled with
blood," see above (n. 399). By "a tree" is signified man; and as man is
man from affection, which is of the will, and from perception, which is
of the understanding, therefore these also are signified by "a tree."
There is also a correspondence between man and a tree; wherefore in
heaven there appear paradises of trees, which correspond to the
affections and the perceptions therefrom of the angels; and, likewise,
in some places in hell there are forests of trees which bear evil
fruits, according to correspondence with the lusts and the thoughts
therefrom of those who are there. That "trees" in general signify men as
to their affections and perceptions therefrom, may appear from the
following passages: All the trees of the field shall know, that I
Jehovah have brought down the high tree, I have exalted the low tree, I
have dried up the green tree, and I have made the dry tree to shoot
forth (Ezek. 17:24). Happy is the man that trusteth in Jehovah, for he
shall be like a tree planted by the waters, he shall not cease from
bearing fruit (Jer. 17:7-8). Happy is the man whose good pleasure is in
the law; he shall be like a tree planted by the brooks of waters, that
giveth fruit in its season (Ps. 1:1-3). Praise Jehovah, ye trees of
fruit (Ps. 148:9). The trees of Jehovah are full (Ps. 104:16). The axe
is laid at the root of the tree, every tree which bringeth not forth
good fruit, is hewn down (Matt. 3:10; 7:16-20). Either make the tree
good and the fruit good; or make the tree corrupt and the fruit corrupt;
for the tree is known from the fruit (Matt. 12:33; Luke 6:43-44). I will
kindle a fire which shall devour every green tree, and every dry tree
(Ezek. 20:47). Since a tree signifies man, therefore it was ordained
that: The fruit of a tree serving for food in the land of Canaan should
be circumcised (Lev. 19:23-25). Also: When any city was besieged, they
should not put forth an axe against any tree of good fruit (Deut.
20:19-20). As also that: At the feast of tabernacles they should take
fruit of the tree of honor, and be glad before Jehovah (Lev. 23:40-41).
Besides other passages, which are not here adduced by reason of their
abundance.
