### Apocalypse Revealed

<span class="margnote"><span id="401.">401.</span></span>

And all green grass was burnt up, signifies, thus every living thing of
faith. By "being burnt up" is signified to perish, as just above (n.
400); by "green grass," in the Word, is signified that good and truth of
the church or of faith, which first springs up in the natural man; the
same also is signified by "the herb of the field"; and because faith
lives from good and truth, therefore by "all green grass was burnt up,"
is signified that every living thing of faith perished; and every living
thing of faith perishes when there is no affection of good and
perception of truth, of which just above. That "grass" signifies this is
also from correspondence; wherefore they who separate faith from
charity, not only in doctrine but also in life, in the spiritual world
pass the time in a desert, where there is not even grass. As "a fruit
tree" signifies man as to the affections of good and the perceptions of
truth, so "green grass" signifies man as to that of the church which is
first conceived and also born in him, and "grass not green" signifies
the same destroyed. In general all things which are in gardens, woods,
fields, and plains, signify man as to something of the church, or what
is the same, something of the church with him; the reason is, because
they correspond. That "grass" has this signification, may appear from
these passages: The voice said, Cry; and he said, What shall I cry? All
flesh is grass, the grass withereth, and the flower fadeth, because the
wind hath breathed upon it; truly the people is grass. The grass
withereth and the flower fadeth, but the Word of our God shall stand for
ever (Isa. 40:5-8). The inhabitants were as the herb of the field, and
as the green grass, as the grass of the roofs, and a field burned before
the corn (Isa. 37:27; 2 Kings 19:26). I will pour out My blessing upon
those born of thee, and they shall spring up in the midst of the grass
(Isa. 44:3-4; and in other places; as in Isa. 51:12; Ps. 37:2; 103:15;
129:6; Deut. 32:2). That by "green" or "growing green," is signified
what is living or alive, is evident in Jeremiah 11:16; 17:8; Ezekiel
17:24; 20:47; Hosea 14:8; Psalms 37:35; 52:8; 92:10, 14. The same as
what is here described in Revelation came to pass in Egypt, namely: By
hail and fire mingled, every tree and every herb of the field was burnt
up (Exod. 9:29-35; Ps. 78:47-49; 105:32-33).

<span class="margnote"><span id="402.">402.</span></span>

Verse 8. And the second angel sounded, signifies the exploration and
manifestation of what the state of the church is with those who are
exteriorly in that faith. That "to sound with a trumpet" signifies to
explore and make manifest the state of the church, and thence of the
life with those whose religion is faith alone, may be seen above (n.
397). It is said of those who are exteriorly in that faith, because they
are here treated of who are in "the sea," and previously they were
treated of who were on "the earth;" and by those who were on "the earth"
are meant such as are in the internals of the church, who are the
clergy, and by those who are in "the sea" are meant such as are in the
externals of the church, who are the laity, as may be seen above (n.
398), who in the spiritual world appear as it were in the sea (n. 238,
290).

<span class="margnote"><span id="403.">403.</span></span>

And as it were a mountain <span id="fr_40"></span>[403-1](#fn_40.md)
burning with fire was cast into the sea, signifies the appearance of
infernal love with those who are in the externals of the church and in
faith alone. By "the sea" is signified the church with those who are in
externals, and in faith alone; and they who are in externals are called,
in common language, the laity, because they who are in internals are
called the clergy (n. 397, 402). "A mountain" signifies love (n. 336),
and "a mountain burning with fire" signifies infernal love (n. 494,
599); this is the appearance of this love with those who are here
treated of, and is so seen by the angels; the reason is, because faith
alone is faith separated from charity (n. 388); and where there is no
charity, that is, love towards the neighbor, which is spiritual love,
there is infernal love; an intermediate love does not exist except among
the lukewarm (concerning whom see in Revelation 3:15, 16).

<span class="margnote"><span id="404.">404.</span></span>

And the third part of the sea became blood signifies that all general
truths with them were falsified. By "the third part" is signified all
(n. 400); by "blood" is signified the falsification of the truth of the
Word (n. 379); by "the sea" is signified the church with those who are
in its externals, and in faith alone (n. 398, 402). General truths are
falsified with such because they are in them alone, for they do not know
the particulars of that faith, as the clergy do; it is from the general
truths with them that they appear as in a sea in the spiritual world;
the reason is, because waters signify truths (n. 50), and the sea is
their general receptacle (n. 238).

<span class="margnote"><span id="405.">405.</span></span>

Verse 9. And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea that
had souls died, signifies that they who have lived and do live this
faith cannot be reformed and receive life. By "the third part" is
signified all of them, as above; by "creatures" are meant those who can
be reformed (n. 290); the reason is, because "to create" signifies to
reform (n. 254). By "having souls" is signified to be capable of
receiving life by reformation; by "they died" is signified that they who
live that faith alone cannot receive life; the reason why they cannot is
because all are reformed by faith united to charity, thus by the faith
of charity, and no one by faith alone, for charity is the life of faith.
\[2\] Since the affections and thence the perceptions and thoughts of
spirits and angels, in the spiritual world, appear at a distance in the
forms of animals or creatures upon the earth, which are called beasts,
of creatures in the air which are called birds, and of creatures in the
sea which are called fishes, therefore in the Word mention is so often
made of "beasts," "birds," and "fishes," by which nothing else is meant;
as in these passages: Jehovah hath a strife with the inhabitants of the
earth, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God; and
everyone that dwelleth therein shall waste away, the beast of the field,
and the bird of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea shall be
collected (Hos. 4:1, 3). I will consume man and beast, the bird of the
heavens and the fishes of the sea, and the stumbling blocks with the
wicked (Zeph. 1:3). There shall be a great earthquake upon the land of
Israel, and the fishes of the sea, and the bird of the heavens, and the
beast of the field, shall tremble before Me (Ezek. 38:18-20). Thou
madest him to have dominion over the works of Thy hands; Thou hast put
all things under his feet, the beasts of the field, the bird of the air,
and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the way of the
seas (Ps. 8:6-8). This is concerning the Lord: But, ask now, the beasts,
and they will teach thee; or the birds of heaven, and they shall
announce to thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee. Who
knoweth not from all these that the hand of Jehovah hath done this? (Job
12:7-9). Besides many other places. \[3\] By "fishes" or "creatures of
the sea," are here meant the affections and thence the thoughts of those
men who are in general truths, and are thus more attracted by what is
natural than what is spiritual; these are meant by "fishes" in the
passages above cited, and also in the following: Behold, at My rebuke I
dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish putrefy, and
die of thirst (Isa. 50:2). The king of Egypt is a great whale that lieth
in the midst of thy rivers; thou hast said, The river is mine, I have
made it; therefore I will make the fish of thy rivers to adhere to thy
scales, and I will leave thee in the wilderness, thee and all the fish
of thy rivers (Ezek. 29:3-5). These things were said to the king of
Egypt, because by "Egypt" is signified the natural separated from the
spiritual, and therefore by "the fishes of his rivers" are meant those
who are in doctrinals, and from them in faith separated, which faith is
only science; on account of this separation, one of the miracles that
were performed there was as follows: That their waters were turned into
blood, and that thereby the fish died (Exod. 7:17-25; Ps. 105:29). \[4\]
Again: Wherefore dost thou make man as the fishes of the sea, everyone
draweth out with a hook, <span id="fr_41"></span>[405-1](#fn_41.md) and
gathereth into the net (Hab. 1:14-16). "Fishes" here are for those who
are in general truths, and in faith separated from charity. But "fishes"
signify those who are in general truths and in faith conjoined with
charity, in Ezekiel: He said unto me, These are the waters that go forth
to the eastern boundary; they come to the sea, whence it is that every
soul that creepeth liveth: and exceeding much fish; the fishers shall
stand upon it to spread forth nets; its fish shall be according to their
kinds, exceeding many like the fish of the great sea (Ezek. 47:8-10). In
Matthew: Jesus said, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a net that
was cast into the sea, and they collected fishes, the good they put into
vessels, but cast the bad away (Matt. 13:47-49). And in Jeremiah: I will
bring again the sons of Israel upon their land, and, I will send for
many fishers, who shall fish them (Jer. 16:15-16). \[5\] He that knows
therefore, that such persons and things are signified by "fishes," may
see why: The Lord chose fishers for His disciples, and said, Come unto
Me, and I will make you fishers of men (Matt. 15:18-19; Mark 1:16-17).
That the disciples, by the blessing of the Lord, caught an immense
multitude of fishes, and the Lord said unto Peter, Fear not, from
henceforth thou shalt catch men (Luke 5:2-10). Why the Lord, when they
wished to take tribute of Him, said to Peter to go to the sea, and draw
up a fish, and give the piece of money found in it for Himself and him
(Matt. 17:24-27). Why the Lord, after the resurrection, gave the
disciples a fish and bread to eat (John 21:2-13). And said to them, Go
ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature (Mark
16:15). For "the nations" which they converted were only in general
truths, in natural truth more than in spiritual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="406.">406.</span></span>

And the third part of the ships perished, signifies that all the
knowledges of good and truth from the Word serving for use of life were
destroyed with them. "The third part" signifies all, as above (n. 400,
404, 405); "ships" signify the knowledges of good and truth from the
Word serving for the use of life. That these are signified by "ships" is
because ships cross the sea, and bring back the necessaries which are
for the natural man for every use; and the knowledges of good and truth
are the necessaries which are for the spiritual man for every use of it;
for from them is the doctrine of the church, and according to this is
life. "Ships" signify these knowledges, because they are containers; and
in many places in the Word the container is taken for the thing
contained, as a cup for wine, a platter for food, the tabernacle and the
temple for the holy things in them, the ark for the law, the altars for
worship, and so on. \[2\] "Ships" signify the knowledges of good and
truth in the following passages: Zebulon shall dwell at the shore of the
seas, and he is for a port of the ships (Gen. 49:13). By "Zebulon" is
meant the conjunction of good and truth. O Tyre, the builders have
perfected thy beauty; of firs from Senir have they made all thy boards;
they have taken the cedar of Lebanon to make a mast; they have made
thine oars of the oaks of Bashan; thine oar-bench have they made of
ivory, the daughter of steps from the isles of Kittim; the inhabitants
of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men were thy ship-masters;
all the ships of the sea and their sailors were in thee to trade; the
ships of Tarshish were thy troops in thy tradings; whence thou wast
exceedingly filled and honored in the heart of the seas (Ezek. 27:4-9,
25). This is concerning Tyre, because the church as to the knowledges of
truth and good is signified by "Tyre" in the Word, as may be evident
from the particulars concerning it in this chapter and in the eighteenth
following, when understood in the spiritual sense. And as the knowledges
of the truth and good of the church are signified by "Tyre," a ship is
therefore described as to the particulars of it, and by each one is
signified some quality of those knowledges that conduces to
intelligence. What has the Word in common with the ships of Tyre and its
commerce? \[3\] The devastation of that church is afterwards described
thus: At the voice of the cry of thy shipmasters the suburbs shall
quake, and all that hold an oar shall descend from thy ships, all
mariners and shipmasters of the sea shall cry out bitterly upon thee
(Ezek. 27:28-30; also Isa. 23:14-15). The devastation of Babylon as to
all the knowledges of truth is similarly described in what follows in
Revelation: In one hour are so great riches devastated; every pilot and
everyone employed upon ships, and the sailors, shall cry out, saying,
Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, in which all who have ships in the
sea were made rich (Rev. 18:17, 19). \[4\] See the explanation below.
The knowledges of truth and good are also signified by "ships" in the
following passages: My days were swift, they fled away, they saw not
good, they passed by with the ships of desire (Job 9:25-26). They that
go down to the sea in ships, that do work in many waters, these see the
works of Jehovah, and His wonders in the deep (Ps. 107:23-24). The isles
shall trust in Me, and the ships of Tarshish in the beginning, to bring
thy children from afar (Isa. 60:9). The kings gathered themselves
together, terror seized them; thou shalt break the ships of Tarshish by
the east wind (Ps. 48:4-7). Howl, ye ships of Tarshish (Isa. 23:1, 14;
besides other places, as Num. 24:24; Judges 5:17; Ps. 104:26; Isa.
33:21).

<span class="margnote"><span id="407.">407.</span></span>

Verse 10. And the third angel sounded, signifies the exploration and
manifestation of the <span id="fr_42"></span>[407-1](#fn_42.md) church with
those whose religion is faith alone, of what quality they are as to the
affection and reception of truths from the Word. That this is signified
may be evident from the things which now follow, when understood in the
spiritual sense.

<span class="margnote"><span id="408.">408.</span></span>

And there fell from heaven a great star burning as it were a lamp,
signifies the appearance of their own intelligence from pride arising
from infernal love. The appearance of their own intelligence from pride
arising from infernal love is signified by "the great star falling from
heaven," because it was seen "to burn as a lamp," and because its name
was "wormwood," as it follows; and by "a star" and also by "a lamp"
intelligence is signified, here one's own intelligence, because it
seemed to burn, and all self-intelligence burns from pride; and the
pride of it arises from infernal love, which is signified by "the
mountain burning with fire" (n. 403). By "wormwood" infernal falsity is
signified, from which that intelligence exists and is enkindled. That "a
star" signifies intelligence may be seen (n. 151, 954); so too "a lamp"
or "a lantern" (796).

<span class="margnote"><span id="409.">409.</span></span>

And it fell upon a third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of
waters, signifies that thence all the truths of the Word were altogether
falsified. By "rivers" are signified truths in abundance, because truths
are signified by "waters" (n. 50); and by "fountains of waters" the Word
is signified (n. 384). The truths of the Word were altogether falsified;
because it follows that "the third part of the waters became wormwood,"
and by "wormwood" infernal falsity is signified (n. 410). \[2\] That
"rivers" signify truths in abundance may be evident from the following
passages: Behold, I do a new thing: I will give waters in the wilderness
and rivers in the solitude to give drink to My people, My chosen (Isa.
43:19-20). I will pour water upon the thirsty, and rivers upon the dry
ground; I will pour My spirit upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thy
children (Isa. 44:3). Then the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the
wilderness shall waters break out, and rivers in the plain of the
wilderness (Isa. 35:6). I will open rivers upon the hillsides, and I
will put fountains in the midst of the valleys, I will make the
wilderness a pool of waters, and the dry land springs of water (Isa.
41:18). Jehovah hath founded the world upon the seas, He hath
established it upon the rivers (Ps. 24:2). I will put His hand in the
sea, and His right hand in the rivers (Ps. 89:25). Was Jehovah incensed
at the rivers? Was thy anger against the rivers? Was thy wrath against
the sea, because thou dost ride upon thy horses? (Hab. 3:8.) A river
whose streams shall make glad the city of God (Ps. 46:4). He showed me a
pure river of water of life, going forth from the throne of God and of
the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). He clave the rock in the wilderness, and gave them
drink from the great deeps; He smote the rock and the rivers flowed
forth (Ps. 78:15-16, 20; 105:41). Then the waters shall fail in the sea,
and the river shall be dried up (Isa. 19:5-7; 42:15; 50:2; Nahum 1:4;
Ps. 107:33; Job 14:11). Jesus said, if anyone come unto Me, as the
Scripture hath said, Out of his belly shall flow living water (John
7:37, 38. Besides other places, as Isa. 33:21; Jer. 17:7-8; Ezek. 31:3,
4; 47:1-12; Joel 3:18; Zech. 9:10; Ps. 80:11; 93:3-4; 98:7-8; 110:7;
Num. 24:6-7; Deut. 8:7). \[3\] But that "rivers" in the opposite sense
signify falsities in abundance may be evident from these: He shall send
ambassadors on the sea to a nation trodden down, whose land the rivers
have despoiled (Isa. 18:2). Except Jehovah were for us, the waters would
have submerged us, and the river would have gone over our soul (Ps.
124:2-5). When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and
through the rivers, they shall not submerge thee (Isa. 43:2). The cords
of death encompassed me, and the floods of Belial terrified me (Ps.
18:5). The dragon cast forth water as a river out of his mouth after the
woman, that he might cause her to be swallowed up by the flood (Rev.
12:15). Behold, Jehovah bringeth up upon you the waters of a river
strong and many, and it shall inundate and go over, and shall reach even
to the neck (Isa. 8:7-8). The floods came, and beat upon that house, and
it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock (Matt. 7:25, 27; Luke
6:48-49). Here "floods or rivers" also stand for falsities in abundance,
because the Lord as to the Divine Truth is signified by "the rock." By
"floods" also temptations are signified, because temptations are
inundations of falsities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="410.">410.</span></span>

Verse 11. And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third
part of the waters became wormwood, signifies the infernal falsity from
which their own intelligence is derived, and by which all the truths of
the Word are falsified. By "a star" is signified their own intelligence
springing from pride from infernal love (n. 408). By "name" is signified
its quality (n. 81, 122, 165); by "wormwood" is signified infernal
falsity concerning which something will be said presently; by "waters"
are signified truths (n. 50), here the truths of the Word, because the
subject relates to faith; by "the third part" is signified all, as
above; from these taken together the sense results as delivered above.
"Wormwood" signifies infernal falsity, from its intense bitterness,
whereby it renders food and drink abominable; such falsity is signified
therefore by "wormwood," in the following passages: Behold, I feed these
people with wormwood, and I will give them water of gall to drink (Jer.
9:14-15). Thus saith Jehovah against the prophets: Behold, I feed them
with wormwood, and I will make them drink the water of gall; for from
the prophets of Jerusalem hypocrisy is gone forth into the whole earth
(Jer. 23:15). Ye turn judgment into gall, and the fruit of justice into
wormwood (Amos 5:7; 6:12). Lest there should be among you a root that
beareth gall and wormwood (Deut. 29:18). Since the Jewish church had
falsified all the truths of the Word, like the church here treated of,
and since the Lord by all things of His passion represented it, by
permitting the Jews to treat Him as they did the Word, because He was
the Word, therefore: They gave Him vinegar mingled with gall (which is
like wormwood), but, tasting it, He would not drink (Matt. 27:34; Mark
15:23; Ps. 69:21). Because the Jewish church was such, therefore it is
thus described: He hath filled me with bitterness, and hath made me
drunken with wormwood (Lam. 3:15, 18-19).

<span class="margnote"><span id="411.">411.</span></span>

And many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter,
signifies the extinction of spiritual life with many from the falsified
truths of the Word. "Many men died," signifies the extinction of
spiritual life; for man from the spiritual life with him is called
alive, but from the natural life separated from spiritual life, he is
called dead; "of the waters because they were made bitter," signifies by
the falsified truths of the Word; that "waters" are the truths of the
Word may be seen above (n. 409). The reason why "bitter" signifies what
is falsified, is, because the bitter of wormwood is meant, and by
"wormwood" is signified infernal falsity (n. 410). \[2\] A Christian man
has spiritual life from no other source than from the truths of the
Word, for in them there is life; but when the truths of the Word are
falsified, and man understands and views them according to the falsities
of his religion, then spiritual life with him is extinguished. The
reason is, because the Word communicates with heaven, therefore when it
is read by man, the truths therein ascend into heaven, and the falsities
to which truths are adjoined or conjoined, tend towards hell, whence
there is a rending asunder, whereby the life of the Word is
extinguished. But this is the case only with those who confirm falsities
by the Word, but not with those who do not confirm them. I have seen
such rendings asunder, and have heard the noise like that of wood split
by the fire on a hearth. \[3\] "Bitter" signifies what is falsified also
in the following passages: Woe unto them that call evil good, and good
evil, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter (Isa. 5:20). They
shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them
that drink it (Isa. 24:9). The like is signified by: The little book
that was eaten, which was sweet in the mouth, and by which the belly was
made bitter (Rev. 10:9-10). And by this: They came to Marah but they
could not drink of the waters, on account of the bitterness; but Jehovah
showed him wood, which he cast into the waters, and they became sweet
(Exod. 15:23-25). "Wood," in the Word, signifies good. The same is also
signified by: The wild gourds which were put into the pottage, by reason
of which the sons of the prophets cried out, There is death in the pot,
which Elisha healed by putting in meal (2 Kings 4:38-41). Meal signifies
truth from good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="412.">412.</span></span>

Verse 12. And the fourth angel sounded, signifies the exploration and
manifestation of the state of the church with those whose religion is
faith alone, that they are in the evils of falsity, and in the falsities
of evil. That this is the signification of these words, is evident from
what follows, when understood in the spiritual sense. "To sound"
signifies here, as before, to explore and make manifest (n. 398, 402,
407).

<span class="margnote"><span id="413.">413.</span></span>

And the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the
moon, and the third part of the stars, so that the third part of them
was darkened, signifies that by reason of evils from falsities and of
falsities from evils, they did not know what love is, or what faith is,
or any truth. By "the third part" is signified all (n. 400); by "the
sun" is signified love (n. 53); by "the moon" is signified intelligence
and faith (n. 332); by "stars" are signified the knowledges of truth and
good from the Word (n. 51); by "being darkened" is signified not to be
seen or known by reason of evils from falsities and falsities from
evils. Evils from falsities are with those who assume the falsities of
religion, and confirm them till they appear as truths, and when they
live according to them they do evils from falsities, or the evils of
falsity. But those have falsities from evils, who do not regard evils as
sins; and still more those who, by reasonings from the natural man, and
more still from the Word, confirm with themselves that evils are not
sins. The confirmations themselves are falsities from evils, and are
called the falsities of evil. \[2\] The reason that "darkness" signifies
this is because light signifies truth; and when the light is
extinguished, there comes darkness. In confirmation the passages will
first be adduced, where similar things to those here in Revelation are
said of "the sun, the moon, and the stars," and of "the darkness"
arising from the extinction of them: The sun shall be turned into
darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of
Jehovah cometh (Joel 2:31). The stars of the heavens and their
constellations shall not shine with their light; the sun shall be
darkened in his rising; and the moon shall not make her light to shine
(Isa. 13:10; see also 24:23). When I shall extinguish thee, I will cover
the heavens; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not
make her light to shine; all the luminaries of light in the heavens will
I make black over thee, and I will set darkness upon thy land (Ezek.
32:7-8). The day of Jehovah is near; the sun and the moon are blackened,
and the stars shall withdraw their brightness (Joel 2:10). Immediately
after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the
moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven
(Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:24-25). Who, that elevates his mind, cannot see
that the sun, the moon, and the stars of the world are not meant in
these cases? \[3\] That falsities of various kinds are signified by
"darkness," is evident from these passages: Woe to them that desire the
day of Jehovah; it is a day of darkness and not of light: is not the day
of Jehovah darkness, and not light, thick darkness, and not brightness?
(Amos 5:18, 20). The day of Jehovah is a day of darkness and thick
darkness, a day of cloud and of cloudiness (Zeph. 1:15). In that day He
shall look down upon the earth, which, behold, is darkness; and the
light shall grow dark in its ruins (Isa. 5:30; 8:22). Behold, darkness
covereth the earth, and thick darkness the peoples (Isa. 60:2). Give
glory to Jehovah, before He cause darkness: we wait for light, but He
maketh it thick darkness (Jer. 13:16). We wait for light, but behold
darkness, and not brightness; we walk in thick darkness; we stumble at
noon as in the twilight, as if dead among the living (Isa. 59:9-10). Woe
to them that put darkness for light, and light for darkness (Isa. 5:20).
The people walking in darkness see a great light (Isa. 9:2; Matt. 4:16).
The dayspring from on high hath appeared to those who sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death (Luke 1:78-79). If thou give thy soul to the
hungry, then shall thy light rise in the darkness, and thy thick
darkness shall be as the noonday (Isa. 58:10). In that day the eyes of
the blind, who are in thick darkness and darkness, shall see (Isa.
29:18; 42:16; 49:9). Jesus said, I am the light of the world; he that
followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of
life (John 8:12). Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness seize upon
you: I am come a light into the world, that everyone that believeth in
Me should not abide in darkness (John 12:35, 46). When I sit in darkness
Jehovah is a light unto me (Micah 7:8). This is the judgment, that light
hath come into the world; but men loved the darkness more than the light
(John 3:19; 1:4-5). If the light \[lumen\] that is in thee be darkness,
how great is the darkness (Luke 11:34-36). This is your hour, and the
power of darkness (Luke 22:53). By "darkness" in these places is
signified falsity arising either from ignorance of the truth, or from a
false principle of religion, or from a life of evil. Concerning those
who are in the falsities of religion and thence in evils of life, the
Lord says that they shall be cast into outer darkness (Matt. 8:12;
22:13; 25:30).

That the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise,
signifies that there is no longer any spiritual truth nor natural truth
serving for doctrine and life from the Word with them. By "the day not
shining," is meant that there was no light from the sun; and by "no
night likewise," is meant that there was no light from the moon and
stars. By "light," in general, is signified the Divine truth, which is
truth from the Word; by "the light of the sun," Divine truth spiritual;
and by the light of the moon and stars, the Divine truth natural, both
from the Word. The Divine truth, in the spiritual sense of the Word, is
like the light of the sun by day; and the Divine truth in the natural
sense of the Word, is like the light of the moon and stars by night. The
spiritual sense of the Word also flows into its natural sense as the sun
does with its light into the moon, which gives forth the light of the
sun in a mediate manner. In the same way does the spiritual sense of the
Word enlighten men, even those who know nothing at all concerning it,
whilst they read the Word in its natural sense; but it enlightens the
spiritual man, as the sun's light does the eye; but the natural man, as
the light of the moon and stars enlighten his eye. Everyone is
enlightened according to the spiritual affection of truth and good, and
at the same time according to genuine truths, by which he has opened his
rational faculty. \[2\] The same is meant by "day" and "night," in the
following passages: And God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse
of the heavens to distinguish between the day and the night; and God
made two great luminaries, the great luminary to rule in the day, and
the lesser luminary to rule in the night; and the stars: And God set
them in the expanse of the heavens to give light upon the earth, and to
rule in the day and in the night, and to distinguish between the light
and the darkness (Gen. 1:14-19). Jehovah made great luminaries, the sun
to rule in the day, the moon and stars to rule in the night (Ps.
136:7-9). To Thee, O Jehovah, is the day, and to Thee the night; Thou
hast prepared the light and the sun (Ps. 74:16). Jehovah that giveth the
sun for the light of the day, the statutes of the moon and stars for the
light of the night (Jer. 31:35). If ye can make void My covenant of the
day and My covenant of the night, that there should not be day and night
in their season, My covenant also with David My servant shall be made
void; if I have not set My covenant of the day and of the night, the
statutes of heaven and earth, I will also reject the seed of Jacob and
of David (Jer. 33:20-21, 25-26). These are adduced, that it may be known
that the darkening of both kinds of light is meant.

Verse 13. And I saw and I heard an angel flying in the midst of heaven,
signifies instruction and prediction from the Lord. By "an angel," in
the highest sense, is meant the Lord, and thence also something from the
Lord (n. 344) and by "flying in the midst of heaven and saying," is
signified to perceive and understand, and when concerning the Lord, to
foresee and provide (n. 245); but here, to instruct and foretell.

Saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell upon the
earth, by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels
which are about to sound, signifies deepest lamentation over the damned
state of those in the church, who in doctrine and life have confirmed
themselves in faith separated from charity. By "woe" is signified
lamentation over the evil with anyone, and thence over his unhappy
state; here, over the damned state of those who are treated of in the
next chapter, and afterwards. And by "Woe, woe, woe," is signified the
deepest lamentation; for triplication makes the superlative, because
"three" signifies all and full (n. 505). By "them that dwell upon the
earth" are meant they who are in the church where the Word is, and by
which the Lord is known: that "earth" signifies the church may be seen
above (n. 285). By "the voices of the trumpet of the three angels which
are about to sound," is signified the exploration and manifestation of
the state of the church and of life with those who by doctrine and life
have confirmed in themselves faith separated from charity, over whose
state lamentation is made. "Woe" signifies lamentation over the present
or future calamity, unhappiness, or damnation of others, in these
passages: Woe unto you, Pharisees and hypocrites (Matt. 23:13-16, 23,
25, 27, 29). Woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed (Luke
22:22). Woe unto him by whom offenses come (Luke 17:1). Woe unto them
that join house to house. Woe unto them that rise up early in the
morning to follow strong drink. Woe unto them that draw iniquity. Woe
unto them that call evil good. Woe unto them that are wise in their own
eyes. Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine (Isa. 5:8, 11, 18,
20-22; and in many other places).

To the above I will add this Relation. I saw in the spiritual world two
flocks, one of goats and the other of sheep; I wondered who they were,
for I knew that animals, seen in the spiritual world, are not animals,
but correspondences of the affections and thence of the thoughts of
those who are there. Wherefore I approached nearer, and as I drew near,
the likenesses of animals disappeared, and instead of them were seen
men. And it was shown, that they who constituted the flock of goats,
were those who had confirmed themselves in the doctrine of justification
by faith alone; and they who constituted the flock of sheep, were those
who believed that charity and faith are a one, as good and truth are a
one. \[2\] And then I spoke with those who had been seen as goats, and
said, "Why are you thus assembled?" They consisted chiefly of clergy,
who gloried in their fame for erudition, because they knew the arcana of
justification by faith alone. They said that they were assembled to sit
in council, because they had heard that what is said by Paul (Romans
3:28), that "man is justified by faith without the works of the Law,"
was not rightly understood, because Paul by "the works of the Law" meant
the works of the Mosaic law, which was for the Jews; which we also
clearly see from his words to Peter; whom he rebuked for judaizing, when
yet he knew that "no one is justified by the works of the Law"
(Galatians 2:14-16); also, that he distinguishes between the law of
faith and the law of works; and between Jews and Gentiles, or
circumcision and uncircumcision, meaning by circumcision, Judaism, as
everywhere else; and likewise from his summing up with these words: Do
we then abrogate the law through faith? Not so, but we establish the Law
(Rom. 3:31). He says all these things in one series (Romans 3:27-31);
and he also says in the preceding chapter: For not the hearers of the
Law are justified by God, but the doers of the Law shall be justified
(Rom. 3:13). God will render to every man according to his deeds (Rom.
2:6). We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that each
one may receive the things done in the body, whether they be good or
evil (2 Cor. 5:10). Besides many other things from him; from which it is
evident that Paul rejects faith without good works, equally with James
(2:17-26). \[3\] That the works of the Mosaic law, which were for the
Jews, were meant by Paul, we are additionally confirmed in by this
consideration, that all the statutes for the Jews in Moses are called
"the Law," thus "the works of the Law," which we perceive from these
passages: This is the law of the meal-offering (Lev. 6:9 seq.). This is
the law of the sacrifice (Lev. 7:1). This is the law of the sacrifice of
the peace-offering (Lev. 7:7, 11 seq.). This is the law of the burnt
offering, of the meal-offering, of the sacrifice for sin and guilt, for
the consecration (Lev. 7:37). This is the law of the beast and of the
bird (Lev. 11:46 seq.). This is the law for her that bringeth forth a
son or a daughter (Lev. 12:7). This is the law of leprosy (Lev. 13:59;
14:2, 32, 54, 57). This is the law of him that hath an issue (Lev.
15:32). This is the law of jealousy (Num. 5:29-30). This is the law of
the Nazarite (Num. 6:13, 21). This is the law of cleansing (Num. 19:14).
This is the law concerning the red heifer (Num. 19:2). The law for the
king (Deut. 17:15-19). Yea, the whole book of Moses is called: The book
of the law (Deut 31:9, 11-12, 26; also in the evangelists, Luke 2:22;
24:44; John 1:45; 7:22-23; 8:5; and other places). To this they added
also what they had seen in Paul, that the law of the Decalogue was to be
lived, and that it is fulfilled by charity, which is love towards the
neighbor (Romans 13:8-11); thus not by faith alone. They said that this
was the reason of their being convened. \[4\] But that I might not
disturb them, I retired; and then they again appeared, at a distance,
like goats, and sometimes as lying down, and sometimes as standing; but
they turned themselves away from the flock of sheep. They appeared as if
they were lying down, when deliberating, and as standing up, when they
came to a conclusion. But, keeping my eyes fixed upon their horns, I
wondered on seeing that the horns on their foreheads sometimes appeared
to extend forward and upward, then to be bent backward, and at last to
be thrown back entirely. And then they all suddenly turned round to the
flock of sheep, but still appeared as goats. Wherefore I drew near to
them again, and inquired, What now? They replied, that they had come to
this conclusion, that faith alone produces the goods of charity, which
are called good works, as a tree produces fruit. But then thunder was
heard, and lightning seen from above; and presently there appeared an
angel standing between the two flocks, who cried to the flock of sheep,
"Do not hearken to them; they have not receded from their former faith,
which is, that God the Father hath compassion for the sake of the Son;
which faith is not faith in the Lord; neither is faith a tree, but man
is a tree; but do the work of repentance, and look to the Lord, and you
will have faith; faith before that, is not a faith in which there is
anything living." Then the goats, whose horns were directed backward,
wished to approach the sheep; but the angel standing between them,
divided the sheep into two flocks, and said to those on the left, "Join
yourselves to the goats; but I say to you, that a wolf will come, which
will snatch them away; and you with them." \[5\] But after the two
flocks of sheep had separated, and they on the left hand had heard the
threatening words of the angel, they looked at one another, and said,
"Let us confer with our former associates." And then the left-hand flock
spoke to the right, saying, "Why have you receded from your pastors? Are
not faith and charity a one, as a tree and its fruit are one? For the
tree by its branch is continued into the fruit. Tear away anything from
the branch which flows by continuity into the fruit, and will not the
fruit perish? Ask our priests if it is not so." And then they asked, and
the priests looked around to the rest, who winked with their eyelids to
intimate that they had spoken well. And then they replied that it was
so, that faith is preserved by the fruit; but they would not say faith
is continued in the fruit. \[6\] But then one of the priests, who was
among the sheep on the right hand, rose up and said, "They have answered
you that it is so, but they have told their companions that it is not
so; for they think otherwise." Wherefore they inquired, "How, then, do
they think? Do they not think as they teach?" He said, "No; they think
that every good of charity, which is called a good work, done by man for
the sake of salvation or eternal life, is not good but evil, by reason
that man desires to save himself by his own works, by claiming to
himself the justice and merit of the only Savior; and that it is so with
every good work, in which man feels his own will. Therefore among
themselves they call good works from man, not blessed, but cursed; and
say that they merit hell rather than heaven." \[7\] But the flock on the
left hand said, "You speak falsehoods against them; do they not preach
manifestly before us charity and its works, which they call the works of
faith?" He replied, "You do not understand their preachings; only a
clergyman, who is present, attends and understands. They think only of
moral charity, and its civil and political goods, which they call the
goods of faith, which yet are not at all so. For a man may be an
atheist, and perform these works in the same manner, and under the same
form. Wherefore they are unanimous in saying that no one is saved by any
works, but by faith alone; but this shall be illustrated by comparisons.
An apple tree produces apples; but if a man does what is good for the
sake of salvation, as the tree produces apples by continuity, then those
apples are rotten within, and full of worms. They say, also, that a vine
produces grapes; but that if a man were to do spiritual goods as a vine
grapes, he would produce wild grapes." \[8\] But then they asked, "What
is the nature of their goods of charity or works, which are the fruits
of faith?" He replied, "They are inconspicuous, being inwardly in man
from the Holy Spirit, concerning which man knows nothing." But they
said, "If a man knows nothing concerning them, there must surely be some
conjunction, or how could they be called works of faith? perhaps those
insensible goods are then insinuated into the voluntary works of man by
some mediating influx, as by some affection, aspiration, inspiration,
incitation, and excitation of the will; by a tacit perception in thought
and thence exhortation, contrition, and thus by conscience, and thence
by impulse and obedience to the Decalogue and the Word, as an infant, or
as a wise man, or by something else of a similar nature." But he
replied, "No; and if they say it is effected by such means because by
faith, still they bury them with words in their discourses in such a
manner that the result after all is, that they do not proceed from
faith; some, however, do maintain such things, but as the signs of
faith, but not as its bonds with charity. Some have nevertheless thought
of a conjunction by the Word." And then they said, "Is there not thus
conjunction, when man voluntarily acts according to the Word?" But he
replied, "This is not what they think; they ascribe it solely to the
hearing the Word, thus not to the understanding of the Word, lest
anything should manifestly enter by the understanding into the thought
and will of man; since they assert that everything voluntary in man is
meritorious, and that in spiritual things, man cannot begin, will,
think, understand, believe, operate, and cooperate anything, any more
than a stock; but yet it is different with the influx of the Holy Spirit
by faith into the speech of the preacher, because these are acts of the
mouth, and not acts of the body; likewise because man acts by faith with
God, but by charity with men." \[9\] But when one of them heard that it
was done merely by hearing the Word, and not by understanding the Word,
being indignant, said, "Is this through the understanding of the Word,
by the Holy Spirit alone, whilst man, throughout the church service,
turns himself away, or sits deaf as a post, or while he is sleeping, or
only from an exhalation from the volume of the Word? What is more
ludicrous?" After this a certain man of the flock of the right hand, who
excelled the rest in judgment, requested to be heard, and said, "I heard
a certain person say, 'I have planted a vineyard, now will I drink wine
even to intoxication.' But another asked, 'Will you drink the wine out
of your own cup by your own right hand?' And he said, 'No; but out of an
inconspicuous cup from an inconspicuous hand.' And the other replied,
'Of a certainty then you will not be intoxicated.'" Presently the same
man said, "But hear me, I beseech you; I say unto you, drink wine from
the Word understood. Do you not know that the Lord is the Word? Is not
the Word from the Lord? Is he not therefore in it? If then you do good
from the Word, do you not do it from the Lord, from his mouth and will?
And if you at the same time look to the Lord, he will also lead you, and
will cause you to do it, and this he will do through you, and you as
from yourselves. Who can say, when doing anything from a king, from his
mouth and will, 'I do this from myself, from my own mouth or command,
and from my own will?' After this he turned to the clergy, and said, "Ye
ministers of God, seduce not the flock." \[10\] On hearing these things,
the greater part of the flock on the left hand receded, and joined
themselves with the flock on the right; some of the clergy also then
said, "We have heard what we have not heard before; we are shepherds; we
will not leave the sheep." And they receded along with them, and said,
"That man spoke a true word. Who can say, when he does anything from the
Word, thus from the Lord, from His mouth and will, I do this from
myself? Who that does anything from the mouth and will of a king, says,
'I do this from myself'"? Now we see Divine providence, why a
conjunction of faith and works has not been discovered, which has been
acknowledged by the ecclesiastical body. It could not be found, because
no such conjunction can be given, for theirs is not a faith in the Lord,
who is the Word, and therefore neither is it a faith from the Word. But
the other priests went away, flourishing their caps, and crying out,
"Faith alone! faith alone, it will live still."

Revelation 9 1. And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from
heaven unto the earth, and to him was given the key of the pit of the
abyss. 2. And he opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up a smoke
out of the pit of the abyss, as the smoke of a great furnace: and the
sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit. 3. And out of
the smoke there went forth locusts upon the earth; and unto them was
given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 4. And it was
said to them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any
green thing, nor any tree; but only the men who had not the seal of God
in their foreheads. 5. And it was given to them that they should not
kill them, but that they should torment them five months: and their
torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it striketh a man. 6. And
in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall
desire to die, and death shall flee from them. 7. And the likenesses of
the locusts were like unto horses prepared for war; and upon their heads
as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.
8. And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as those
of lions. 9. And they had breastplates, as breastplates of iron; and the
voice of their wings was as the voice of chariots of many horses running
to war. 10. And they had tails like unto scorpions; and there were
stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. 11.
And they had a king over them, the angel of the abyss, whose name in the
Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he hath the name Apollyon. 12. One
woe is past; behold, there come two woes more hereafter. 13. And the
sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the
golden altar that is before God. 14. Saying to the sixth angel who had
the trumpet, Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river
Euphrates. 15. And the four angels were loosed; who were prepared for an
hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, to kill a third part of men.
16. And the number of the armies of horsemen was two myriads of myriads:
and I heard the number of them. 17. And thus I saw the horses in the
vision, and them that sat upon them, having breastplates of fire, and
jacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses were as the heads of
lions; and out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone.
18. By these three was a third part of men killed, by the fire, and by
the smoke, and by the brimstone, that issued out of their mouths. 19.
And their power was in their mouth; for their tails were like unto
serpents, having heads, and with them they hurt. 20. And the rest of the
men who were not killed by these plagues, yet repented not of the works
of their hands, that they should not adore demons, and idols of gold,
and silver, and brass, and stone, and wood; which neither can see, nor
hear, nor walk: 21. Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their
enchantments, nor of their whoredoms, nor of their thefts. THE SPIRITUAL
SENSE The contents of the whole chapter Of the exploration and
manifestation of the states of life of those in the church of the
Reformed, who are called learned and wise from the confirmation of faith
separated from charity, and of justification and salvation by it alone
(these are treated of from verses 1-12). Of the exploration and
manifestation of those therein, who are not so learned and wise, and are
in faith alone, and who live as they please (from verses 13-19). Lastly,
of those therein, who know nothing but that faith is the all by which
man is saved, and not anything besides (verses 20-21). The contents of
each verse Verse 1. "The fifth angel sounded," signifies the exploration
and manifestation of the states of life of those in the church of the
Reformed, who are called learned and wise from the confirmation of faith
separated from charity, and of justification and salvation by it alone
(n. 419). "And I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth," signifies
spiritual Divine truth flowing from heaven into the church with them and
exploring and manifesting (n. 420). "And to him was given the key of the
pit of the abyss," signifies the opening of their hell (n. 421). Verse
2. "And he opened the pit of the abyss, and there went up a smoke out of
the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace," signifies the falsities of
the concupiscences of the natural man springing forth from their evil
loves (n. 422). "And the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of
the pit," signifies that thence the light of truth became thick darkness
(n. 423). Verse 3. "And there went forth out of the smoke locusts upon
the earth," signifies that from them were falsities to the lowest
things, such as are with those who have become sensual, and see and
judge of all things from the senses and their fallacies (n. 424). "And
unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power,"
signifies the power of persuading that their falsities are truths (n.
425). Verse 4. "And it was said to them that they should not hurt the
grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree; but only the men
who had not the seal of God in their foreheads," signifies the Divine
providence of the Lord, that they should not be able to take away any
truth and good of faith, nor any affection and perception of them, from
any others than such as are not in charity and thence not in faith (n.
426). Verse 5. "And it was given to them that they should not kill them,
but that they should torment them five months," signifies that neither
from these should they be able to take away the faculty of understanding
and willing truth and good, but that they should only be able to bring
on stupor for a short time (n. 427). "And their torment was as the
torment of a scorpion when it striketh a man," signifies that this is
from their persuasive power (n. 428). Verse 6. "And in those days shall
men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and
death shall flee from them," signifies that they wish that in matters of
faith the understanding should be shut up and the will closed, by which
means spiritual light and life are extinguished, and that yet this
cannot be done (n. 429). Verse 7. "And the likenesses of the locusts,"
signifies the appearances and images of those who have confirmed in
themselves faith separated from charity (n. 430). "Were like unto horses
prepared for war," signifies that because they can reason, they appear
to themselves as if they were combating from the understanding of truth
from the Word (n. 431). "And upon their heads as it were crowns like
gold," signifies that they appeared to themselves as if they were
conquerors (n. 432). "And their faces were as the faces of men,"
signifies that they appeared to themselves as if they were wise (n.
433). Verse 8. "And they had hair as the hair of women," signifies that
they appeared to themselves as if they were in the affection of truth
(n. 434). "And their teeth were as the teeth of lions," signifies that
sensual things, which are the ultimates of the life of the natural man,
appeared with them to have power over all things (n. 435). Verse 9. "And
they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron," signifies that
arguments from fallacies, by which they fight and prevail, appeared to
them so powerful that they could not be refuted (n. 436). "And the voice
of their wings was as the voice of chariots of many horses running to
war," signifies their reasonings as if they were from the truths of
doctrine from the Word fully understood, for which they must ardently
fight (n. 437). Verse 10. "And they had tails like unto scorpions,"
signifies the truths of the Word falsified, by which they induce stupor
(n. 438). "And there were stings in their tails, and their power was to
hurt men five months," signifies subtle falsifications of the Word, by
which for a short time they darken and fascinate the understanding, and
thus deceive and captivate (n. 439). Verse 11. "And they had a king over
them, the angel of the abyss, whose name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, and
in the Greek he hath the name Apollyon," signifies that they are in the
satanic hell who are in falsities from lusts, and by the total
falsification of the Word they have destroyed the church (n. 440). Verse
12. "One woe is past; behold, there come two woes more hereafter,"
signifies still further lamentations over the state of the church (n.
441). Verse 13. "And the sixth angel sounded," signifies the exploration
and manifestation of their state of life in the church of the Reformed
who are not so wise, and yet place the all of religion in faith, and
think of it alone, and live as they please (n. 442). "And I heard a
voice from the four horns of the golden altar that is before God, saying
to the sixth angel who had the trumpet" signifies a command from the
Lord out of the spiritual heaven to those who were to explore and make
manifest (n. 443). Verse 14. "Loose the four angels that are bound at
the great river Euphrates," signifies that external bonds should be
taken away from them, that the interiors of their minds might appear (n.
444). Verse 15. "And the four angels were loosed," signifies that when
external bonds were taken away, the interiors of their minds appeared
(n. 445). "Who were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a
year, to kill a third part of men," signifies that they were perpetually
in the effort to take away spiritual light and life from the men of the
church (n. 446). Verse 16. "And the number of the armies of horsemen was
two myriads of myriads," signifies reasoning concerning faith alone,
with which the interiors of their minds were filled up, from the great
abundance of the mere falsities of evil (n. 447). "And I heard the
number of them," signifies that the quality of them was perceived (n.
448). Verse 17. "And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that
sat on them," signifies that it was then discovered that the reasonings
of the interiors of their minds concerning faith alone were imaginary
and visionary, and that they themselves were insane with them (n. 449).
"Having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone," signifies
their imaginary and visionary arguments from infernal love and their own
intelligence, and from the lusts thence (n. 450). "And the heads of the
horses were as the heads of lions," signifies fantasies concerning faith
alone as if it were in power (n. 451). "And out of their mouths issued
fire, and smoke, and brimstone," signifies that in their thoughts and
discourses, viewed interiorly, there is nothing, and from them there
proceeds nothing, but the love of self and of the world, and the pride
of their own intelligence, and the lusts of evil and falsity from these
two (n. 452). Verse 18. "By these three was the third part of men
killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which
issued out of their mouths," signifies that from these it is that the
men of the church perish (n. 453). Verse 19. "And their power was in
their mouth," signifies that they prevail only by their discourse in
confirmation of faith (n. 454). "For their tails were like unto
serpents, having heads, and with them they do hurt," signifies the
reason, because they are sensual and inverted, speaking truths with
their lips, but falsifying them by the principle which constitutes the
head of their religion, and thus they deceive (n. 455). Verse 20. "And
the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues," signifies
those in the church of the Reformed who are not so spiritually dead from
visionary reasonings, and from the love of self, the pride of their own
intelligence, and from lusts, thence as those before mentioned, and yet
make faith alone the head of their religion (n. 456). "Yet repented not
of the works of their hands," signifies that neither did they shun the
things that are of their proprium, which are evils of every kind, as
sins (n. 457). "That they should not adore demons," signifies that thus
they are in the evils of their concupiscences, and make one with their
like in hell (n. 458). "And idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and
stone, and wood," signifies that thus they are in worship from mere
falsities (n. 459). "Which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk,"
signifies, in which there is nothing of spiritual and truly rational
life (n. 460). Verse 21. "Neither repented they of their murders, nor of
their enchantments, nor of their whoredoms, nor of their thefts,"
signifies that the heresy of faith alone induces on their hearts
stupidity, tergiversation, and hardness, so that they do not think
anything of the precepts of the Decalogue, nor indeed of any sin that it
ought to be shunned because it is in favor of the devil and against God.
THE EXPLANATION Verse 1. And the fifth angel sounded, signifies the
exploration and manifestation of the states of life of those in the
church of the Reformed, who are called learned and wise from their
confirmation of faith separated from charity, and of justification and
salvation by it alone. That these are treated of in what now follows as
far as verse 12, is evident from the particulars, understood in the
spiritual sense. That by "sounding" is signified to explore and make
manifest the state of the church, and thence the state of life with
those whose religion is faith alone, may be seen above (n. 397).

<span class="margnote"><span id="420.">420.</span></span>

And I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth, signifies spiritual
Divine truth flowing from heaven into the church as existing with them,
and exploring and manifesting. By "a star" is here signified spiritual
Divine truth, because it fell from the spiritual heaven, concerning
which, above (n. 387, 388); and by "the earth" is here signified the
church with those who are in its internals, as above (n. 398). By
spiritual Divine truth is meant intelligence from spiritual love, which
is love towards the neighbor; and as that intelligence at this date is
called faith, and that love, charity, it is faith from charity, or
rather it is the truth of faith from the good of charity, which is here
signified by "a star." The same is signified by "a star" in the singular
number (Revelation 2:28; 22:16); for by "stars," in the plural number,
are signified the knowledges of good and truth (n. 51), and by these
there is intelligence. That it is the Divine truth exploring and
manifesting, is evident from what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="421.">421.</span></span>

And to him was given the key of the abyss, signifies the opening of
their hell. By "a key" is signified the power of opening, and also the
act of opening (n. 62, 174, 840). And by "the abyss" is signified the
hell where they are who have confirmed themselves in justification and
salvation by faith alone, who are all from the church of the Reformed;
but in the present case, they who in their own eyes, and thence in the
eyes of many others, appear as learned and erudite, when yet in the
sight of the angels in heaven they appear destitute of understanding as
to those things which pertain to heaven and the church; since they who
confirm that faith even to its interiors, close the higher things of
their understanding, till at length they are unable to see any spiritual
truth in light. The reason is, because the confirmation of falsity is
the denial of truth; therefore when they hear any spiritual truth, which
is a truth of the Word serviceable to those who are of the church for
doctrine and life, they keep their minds fixed in the falsities which
they have confirmed, and then they either veil over the truth they have
heard with falsities, or reject them as a mere sound, or yawn at it and
avert themselves; and this in the degree in which they are in the pride
of their own erudition; for pride glues falsities together, so that at
last they cohere like the hardened foam of the sea. \[2\] Therefore the
Word is hidden from them as a book sealed with seven seals. What their
quality is, and what their hell, shall also be told, because it has been
granted me to see it, and to discourse with those who are therein, and
also to see "the locusts" that went forth from it. That pit, which is
like the aperture of a furnace, appears in the southern quarter, and the
abyss beneath is of large extent towards the east; there is light in it,
but if light from heaven be admitted into it, it becomes darkness,
wherefore the pit is closed above. Huts, arched as it were with brick,
appear therein, divided into various little cells, in each of which
there is a table, with paper and some books lying upon it. Everyone sits
at his own table, who in the world had confirmed justification and
salvation by faith alone, making charity a merely natural-moral act, and
its works only works of civil life, whereby men may gain rewards in the
world; but if they are done for the sake of salvation, they condemn
them, and this severely, because human reason and will are in them. All
who are in this abyss were learned and erudite in the world; and among
them there are some metaphysicians and scholastics, who are esteemed
there above the rest. When it was granted me to speak with them, I
recognized some of them. \[3\] But this is their lot: When they are
first admitted, they sit in the foremost cells; but as they confirm
faith by excluding works of charity; they leave their first habitations,
and enter into cells nearer to the east, and so on successively till
towards the end, where those are who confirm these dogmas from the Word;
and as they then cannot but falsify the Word, their huts disappear, and
they see themselves in a desert, whereupon what is described above (n.
153) happens to them. There is also an abyss beneath the one just
mentioned, where they are who in like manner have confirmed
justification and salvation by faith alone, but who by themselves in
their spirit have denied God, and in their hearts have laughed at the
holy things of the church. There they do nothing but quarrel, tear their
garments, climb upon the tables, kick, and fight with each other with
vituperations; and because no one is there permitted to do mischief to
the body of another, they menace with their faces and fists. It is
unclean and squalid there. But these are not treated of in this place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="422.">422.</span></span>

Verse 2. And he opened the pit of the abyss, and there went up a smoke
out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace, signifies the falsities
of the lusts of the natural man springing from their evil loves. By "the
pit of the abyss" is signified the hell above described (n. 421); by
"the smoke" from thence, are signified the falsities from lusts; and
because it is said "the smoke as of a great furnace," the falsities of
lusts springing from evil loves are meant, for "fire" signifies love (n.
468); and "the fire of hell," evil love (n. 494). "A great furnace" has
a like signification, because it smokes from fire. Infernal spirits are
not in any material fire, but in spiritual fire, which is their love;
therefore they do not feel any other fire; on which subject see in the
work on Heaven and Hell, published at London in 1758 (n. 134, 566-575).
Every love in the spiritual world, when it is excited, appears at a
distance as fire, within the hells as a glowing fire, and without, as
the smoke of a fire or as the smoke of a furnace. The falsities of the
lusts springing from evil loves, are also described by "smoke from a
fire" and "from a furnace," in other parts of the Word, as in these
passages: Abraham looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah, and beheld, and lo,
the smoke of the earth went up as the smoke of a furnace (Gen. 19:28).
The sun set, and there was thick darkness, and behold, a furnace of
smoke and a torch of fire, that passed between those pieces (Gen.
15:17). They go on to sin, therefore they shall be as the smoke out of
the chimney (Hos. 13:2-3). The wicked shall perish, into smoke shall
they consume (Ps. 37:20). And I will show signs in heaven, and on the
earth, fire, and pillars of smoke (Joel 2:30). They shall cast the evil
into a furnace of fire, there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth
(Matt. 13:41-42, 49-50, and in other places).

<span class="margnote"><span id="423.">423.</span></span>

And the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the pit,
signifies that thereby the light of truth became thick darkness. By "the
sun" and "the air" is here signified the light of truth, for by "the
sun" is signified love, and by "the light" thence the Divine truth;
wherefore when it is said that "the sun is darkened," and at the same
time "the air," it signifies that the Divine truth had become thick
darkness; that this was from the falsities of lusts is signified by its
being from "the smoke of the pit."

<span class="margnote"><span id="424.">424.</span></span>

Verse 3. And out of the smoke there went forth locusts upon the earth,
signifies that from them were falsities in the outermost parts, such as
prevail with those who have become sensual, and see and judge of all
things from the senses and their fallacies. They are called falsities in
the outermost parts, which occupy the outermost things of man's life,
and are called sensual, concerning which we shall speak presently; these
are signified by "locusts," in the Word: but it is to be known that they
did not appear like the locusts of the field, which leap about and lay
waste the meadows and the crops, but like pygmies or dwarfs, which is
evident also from their description, in that "they had crowns on their
heads, faces like men, hair like women, teeth like lions, breastplates
of iron, and a king over them, the angel of the abyss." That dwarfs were
also called "locusts" by the ancients, may be concluded from these
passages: The spies of the land of Canaan said, We saw the Nephilim, the
sons of the Anakim, and we were in their eyes as locusts (Num. 13:33).
Jehovah who sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants
thereof are as locusts (Isa. 40:22). \[2\] But because falsities in
outermost things, such as prevail among them, are signified by "locusts"
in the Word, therefore they are called "locusts," as also "crowned" and
"commanders," in Nahum: The fire shall devour thee, it shall eat thee up
like the canker worm; make thyself many as the canker worm, make thyself
many as the locust; thy crowned are as the locust, and thy commanders as
the locust of locusts (Nah. 3:15-17). It is in consequence of falsities
in the outermost parts consuming the truths and goods of the church, as
they spring up in man, that they are signified by "locusts," which
consume the grass and the herbs of the fields, as may be evident from
these passages: Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, but the
locust shall consume it (Deut. 28:38). That which the palmer worm left
hath the locust eaten, and that which the locust left hath the canker
worm eaten, and that which the canker worm left hath the caterpillar
eaten (Joel 1:4). And I will compensate to you the years that the
locust, the cancer worm, the caterpillar, and the palmer worm have
consumed (Joel 2:25). \[3\] The same is signified by "the locusts in
Egypt," concerning which it is thus written in Moses: And Moses
stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the east wind
brought the locust. And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt;
before it there was no such locust, and it did eat every herb of the
field, and afterwards Moses stretched forth his rod, and the locust was
cast into the Red Sea (Exod. 10:12, and subsequent verses). And in
David: He gave their produce to the caterpillar, and their labor to the
locust (Ps. 78:46; also 105:34-35). By the miracles in Egypt is
described the vastation of the church; and by this miracle, vastation by
falsities in outermost things; and the outermost things of man's life,
when the interiors on which they depend are closed, are infernal; for
this reason "the locusts were cast into the Red Sea," by which is
signified hell. \[4\] As few at this day know what is meant by the
sensual, and what the quality of the sensual man is; and as "locusts"
signify that, the following extracts are therefore adduced concerning it
from our Arcana Coelestia. That the sensual is the ultimate of the life
of man's mind, adhering and cohering to his five bodily senses (n. 5077,
5767, 9212, 9216, 9331, 9730). That he is called a sensual man who
judges of all things from the bodily senses, and who believes nothing
but what he can see with his eyes, and touch with his hands; saying that
these are something, and rejecting the rest (n. 5094, 7693). That the
interiors of his mind, which see from the light of heaven, are closed,
so that he sees nothing of truth there, which is of heaven and the
church (n. 6564, 6844-6845). That such a man thinks in outermost things,
and not interiorly from any spiritual light (n. 5089, 5094, 6564, 7693).
In a word, that they are in a gross natural light \[lumen\] (n. 6201,
6310, 6564, 6844-6845, 6612, 6614, 6622, 6524). That thence interiorly
they are against the things which are of heaven and the church, but that
exteriorly they can speak in favor of them, and ardently, according to
the dominion they exercise by means of them (n. 6201, 6316, 6844-6845,
6948-6949). That the learned and erudite, who have confirmed themselves
deeply in falsities, and still more they who have confirmed themselves
against the truths of the Word, are more sensual than others (n. 6316).
That sensual men reason acutely and skillfully, because their thought is
so near their speech that it is almost in it, and as it were in their
lips, and because they place all intelligence in speech from memory
only; also that some of them can dexterously confirm falsities, and that
after confirmation they believe them to be truths (n. 195, 196, 5700,
10236). But that they reason and confirm things from the fallacies of
the senses, by which the common people are captivated and persuaded (n.
5084, 6948, 6949, 7693). That sensual men are more cunning and malicious
than others (n. 7693, 10236). That the avaricious, adulterers, the
voluptuous and the deceitful, are especially sensual, although in the
eyes of the world they do not appear so (n. 6310). That the interiors of
their minds are foul and filthy (n. 6201). That by these they
communicate with the hells (n. 6311). That they who are in the hells are
sensual, and the more so the deeper they are in it (n. 4623, 6311). That
the sphere of infernal spirits conjoins itself with the sensual of man
from behind (n. 6312). That they who have reasoned from sensual things
only, and thence against the genuine truths of the church, were called
by the ancients, serpents of the tree of knowledge (n. 195, 196, 197,
6398, 6399, 10313). Moreover the sensual of man, and the sensual man,
are described (n. 10236); and the extension of things sensual in man (n.
9731). That sensual things ought to be in the last place, and not in the
first, and that in a wise and intelligent man they are in the last
place, and subject to the interiors; but that with an unwise man, they
are in the first place, and govern; these are they who are properly
called sensual (n. 5077, 5125, 5128, 7645). If sensual things are in the
last place, a way is opened by them to the understanding, and truths are
elaborated by a mode of extraction (n. 5580). That those sensual things
are in close contact with the world, and admit the things which flow
from the world, and, as it were, sift them (n. 9726). That man by means
of those sensual things, communicates with the world, and, by means of
rational things, with heaven (n. 4009). That sensual things supply such
as are subservient to the interiors of the mind (n. 5077, 5081). That
there are sensual things which minister to the intellectual part; and
such as minister to the voluntary part (n. 5077). That unless the
thought be elevated above sensual things, man enjoys but little wisdom
(n. 5089). That a wise man thinks about sensual things (n. 5089, 5094).
That man, when his thought is elevated above sensual things, comes into
a clearer light, and, at length, into heavenly light (n. 6183, 6313,
6315, 9407, 9730, 9922). That elevation above sensual things, and
abstraction from them, was known to the ancients (n. 6313). That man, by
his spirit, might perceive the things which are done in the spiritual
world, if he could be withdrawn from sensual things, and be elevated
into the light of heaven by the Lord (n. 4622). The reason is, because
the body does not think, but the spirit of man in the body; and in
proportion as it thinks in the body, in the same proportion it thinks
obscurely and in darkness; and in proportion as it does not think in the
body, in the same proportion it thinks clearly and in the light; but in
spiritual things (4622, 6614, 6622). That the sensual scientific is the
ultimate of the understanding, and the sensual delight, the ultimate of
the will (n. 9996). What the difference is between the sensual things
common to beasts, and the sensual things not common to them (n. 10236).
That there are sensual men not evil, by reason that their interiors are
not so closed (concerning whose state in another life, see n. 6311).

<span class="margnote"><span id="425.">425.</span></span>

And unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power,
signifies the power of persuading that their falsities are truths. By "a
scorpion" is signified a deadly persuasive power; and, by "a scorpion of
the earth," persuasive power in things relating to the church, "the
earth" signifying the church (n. 285); for a scorpion, when he stings a
man, induces a stupor upon the limbs, and if it is not cured, death;
their persuasion produces a corresponding effect upon the understanding.
Such is also the signification of "scorpion" in these passages: Fear not
thou on account of them and their words, they are thorny; thou dwellest
among scorpions, they are hard of face and obstinate in heart (Ezek.
2:4, 6). Jesus said unto the seventy whom he had sent forth, Behold, I
give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the
power of the enemy; and nothing shall by any means hurt you (Luke
10:19).

<span class="margnote"><span id="426.">426.</span></span>

Verse 4. And it was said to them that they should not hurt the grass of
the earth, nor any green thing; nor any tree; but only the men who had
not the seal of God in their foreheads, signifies the Divine providence
of the Lord, that they should not be able to take away any truth and
good of faith, nor affection and perception of them, from any others
than such as are not in charity and thence not in faith. By "it was said
to them," is signified the Lord's Divine providence, because it was said
from heaven; by "not hurting the grass of the earth nor any green
thing," is signified not to be able to take away any truth and good of
faith; for by "grass" is signified the truth of faith, which is what
first springs up in man (n. 401); and, by "green thing," is signified
the living principle of faith, which is from good (n. 401); by "not
hurting any tree," is signified not to be able to take away the
affection and perception of truth and good; for by "a tree" is signified
man as to these (n. 400); by "those who had not the seal of God in their
foreheads" are signified those who are not in charity, and thence in
faith; for "the forehead" signifies love and charity (n. 347); and "to
have the seal," signifies to know and distinguish them from others (n.
345). \[2\] The reason why they who have confirmed faith alone, to the
very arcana of justification and salvation by it, cannot take away any
truth and good of faith, nor the affection and perception of them, from
any but those who are not in the faith of charity, is, because they are
scarcely comprehended by anyone but the prelate who teaches and preaches
them. The layman hears them, but they enter in at one ear and go out at
the other; which the mystery-teaching priest himself, who utters those
arcana, may know of a certainty from this circumstance, that he himself
spent the whole force of his genius in acquiring a knowledge of them in
his youth, and afterwards in retaining them in the following age,
likewise from his considering himself as a man of extraordinary learning
on account of them. What then must be the case with a layman, who simply
thinks of faith from charity, when he hears these mysteries? From what
has been said, it may be seen that faith alone justifying is the faith
of the clergy, and not of the laity, except of those who live
unconcernedly, who imbibe no more from their arcana than that faith
alone saves; that they cannot do good from themselves, nor fulfil the
law, that Christ suffered for them; besides some other universals of a
similar nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="427.">427.</span></span>

Verse 5. And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but
that they should be tormented five months, signifies that from the
Divine providence of the Lord, they are not able to take away from those
who are not in the faith of charity the faculty of understanding and
willing what is true and good, but that they should only be able to
induce stupor for a short time. By "its being given them," is signified
that it is from the Divine providence of the Lord, as above; "not to be
able to kill them," signifies not to be able to take away from those who
are not in the faith of charity the faculty of understanding and willing
what is true and good, for when this faculty is taken away, man is
spiritually killed. By "tormenting them five months," is signified to
induce stupor for a short time; "five" signifies a little, or a short
time, and "to torment" signifies to induce stupor, because this is what
is signified by "a scorpion" (n. 425); and by "the torment like that of
a scorpion," as follows (n. 428). That the faculty of understanding
truth and of willing it, or rationality and liberty, cannot be taken
away from man, is amply shown in the Angelic Wisdom concerning the
Divine Providence (n. 73, 74, 82-86, 92-99, 138-149, 322). \[2\] That
"five months" signify a little, and a short time, is because that is
signified by "five;" for times, whether they be hours, days, weeks,
months, or years, do not signify time but state; and the numbers
determine its quality (n. 4, 10, 348, 947). That "five" signifies
something, and also a little, may appear from these passages: A thousand
shall flee at the rebuke of five (Isa. 30:17). Five shall pursue a
hundred (Lev. 26:8). Jesus said, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto
ten virgins, of whom five were prudent and five were foolish (Matt.
25:1-2). By "ten virgins" are signified all in the church; by "five" are
signified a certain part or some of them. The like is signified by "ten"
and "five" in the parable: There were given unto the servants talents
that they should trade, and one with his talent gained ten talents, and
another five (Luke 19:13-20). "Ten talents" signify much, and "five
talents" a little. Besides other places (as in Isaiah 17:6; 19:18-19;
Matthew 14:15-22).

<span class="margnote"><span id="428.">428.</span></span>

And their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when it striketh a
man, signifies that this is from their persuasive power. This follows
from what was said (n. 427); for by "torment" is signified the stupor,
which their persuasive power induces upon the understanding, as the
scorpion does upon the body when he stings it. "The scorpion" signifies
that persuasive power (n. 425). In the spiritual world there exists a
persuasive power which takes away the understanding of truth, and
induces stupor and thus distress upon the mind; but this persuasive
power is unknown in the natural world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="429.">429.</span></span>

Verse 6. And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it;
and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them, signifies that
it is the desire of those who are in the doctrine of faith separated,
that in matters of faith the understanding should be shut up and the
will closed, and thus that they should not have any spiritual light and
life; but that it is nevertheless provided by the Lord that the
understanding should not be shut up, nor the will closed, lest spiritual
light and life with man should be extinguished. "In those days,"
signifies the last state of the church, when the doctrine of faith alone
is universally received. "Men shall seek death," signifies that they
will that, in matters of faith, the understanding should be shut up;
"and shall not find it," signifies that it is provided of the Lord, that
this should not be done; "and shall desire to die," signifies that they
also wish to have the will closed in them; "and death shall flee from
them," signifies that it is provided that neither should take place; for
thus spiritual light and life would be extinguished, and man would
spiritually die. "To seek," is predicated of the understanding; and "to
desire," of the will; and "death," of both. That this is the
signification of these words, is evident; otherwise, what meaning could
there be in that "men should seek death in those days and not find it,
and should desire to die and death should flee from them?" For by
"death," no other death is meant but spiritual death, which is induced
when the understanding is removed from the things that are to be
believed; for in this case man does not know whether he thinks and does
what is true, or what is false, thus whether he thinks and acts with the
angels of heaven, or with the devils of hell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="430.">430.</span></span>

Verse 7. And the likenesses of the locusts, signifies the appearances
and images of those who have confirmed in themselves faith separated
from charity. By "likenesses," is signified their appearances in a
representative image; by "locusts," are signified falsities in outermost
things (n. 424); and as falsities make one with those who are in
falsities, they also are signified by "locusts." That they who have
confirmed themselves in faith alone, or their falsities, are meant by
"locusts," appeared evident to me from this circumstance, that the
presbyters who were in that faith, embraced the locusts that were seen,
and kissed them, and were desirous of introducing them into their
houses. For the images, which are forms representative of the affections
and thoughts of angels and spirits in the spiritual world, appear as if
they were alive, in like manner as the animals, birds, and fishes,
mentioned above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="431.">431.</span></span>

Were like unto horses prepared for war, signifies that because they can
reason, they appear to themselves as if combating from the understanding
of truth from the Word. By "a horse" is signified the understanding of
the Word (n. 298); by "war" is signified spiritual war, which consists
in reasonings and arguments (n. 500, 586); by "like," or similitudes,
are signified appearances, as above (n. 430).

<span class="margnote"><span id="432.">432.</span></span>

And upon their heads as it were crowns like gold, signifies that they
appeared to themselves as conquerors. By "crowns on their heads like
gold," are signified tokens of victory, because formerly kings wore
crowns of gold in battle (n. 300); for it is said that they were seen
"like horses," that is, on horses prepared for war (n. 431), for they
had the faces of men, as follows; and they are in the persuasion that
they cannot be conquered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="433.">433.</span></span>

And their faces were as the faces of men, signifies that they appeared
to themselves to be wise. By "man," in the Word, is signified one wise
and intelligent (n. 243); and by his "face," wisdom and intelligence;
hence it is, that by "their faces as the faces of men," is signified
that they appeared to themselves to be wise. They are also called wise,
learned, and erudite, although they are among the foolish virgins, who
had no oil in their lamps (Matthew 25:1-2). "Oil" signifies love and
charity; and among the foolish means among those who hear the Lord, that
is, read the Word, and do not do it (Matthew 7:26).

<span class="margnote"><span id="434.">434.</span></span>

Verse 8. And they had hair as the hair of women, signifies that they
appeared to themselves to be in the affection of truth. By "man" in the
Word, is signified the understanding of truth; and "woman," the
affection of truth, because the man is born understanding, and the woman
affection; on which subject, see in The Angelic Wisdom Concerning
Marriage. By "hair" in the Word, is signified the ultimate of man's
life, which is the sensual (see n. 424). This is what gives them the
appearance of being in the affection of truth, when yet they are in the
affection of falsity; for this they believe to be truth. That a "woman"
signifies the affection of truth, may appear from many passages in the
Word; hence it is, that the church is called "a wife," "a woman," "a
daughter," and "a virgin," and the church is a church from the love or
affection of truth; for from this comes the understanding of truth.
\[2\] The church is called "a woman" in these passages: There were two
women of one mother, and they committed whoredom in Egypt, Ohola which
is Samaria, and Oholiba which is Jerusalem (Ezek. 23:2-4). Jehovah hath
called thee as a woman deserted and afflicted in spirit, and a woman of
youth (Isa. 54:6-7). Jehovah will create a new thing in the earth, a
woman shall compass a man (Jer. 31:21-22). By "the woman clothed with
the sun, whom the dragon persecuted" (Revelation 12:1, 13), is signified
the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. By "women" are signified the
affections of truth, from which the church is a church, in many
passages, as in the following: The women of My people have ye driven out
from the house of her delights (Micah 2:9). The families of houses shall
mourn apart, and the women apart (Zech. 12:11-13). Stand up, ye secure
women, hear my speech (Isa. 32:9) Wherefore do ye evil to cut off from
you man and woman? (Jer. 44:7). I will disperse man and woman (Jer.
51:22). By "man" and "woman," here and elsewhere, is signified, in the
spiritual sense, the understanding of truth and the affection of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="435.">435.</span></span>

And their teeth were as those of lions, signifies that sensual things,
which are the ultimates of the life of the natural man, appeared with
them to have power over all things. "Teeth" signify the ultimates of the
life of the natural man, which are called sensual things; concerning
which above (n. 424). Sensual things are of two kinds, one which is of
the will, and the other of the understanding; the sensual things of the
will are signified by "the hair of women," of which above (n. 434); and
the sensual things of the understanding are signified by "teeth;" the
latter, or what is the same, sensual men who are in falsities from
confirmation, seem to themselves to be in power over all things, so that
they cannot be conquered; wherefore the "teeth of the locusts," by which
such sensual things are signified, "were as the teeth of lions," for by
"a lion" is signified power (n. 241). That "teeth" signify the ultimates
of man's life, which are called sensual things, and which, when
separated from the interiors of the mind, are in mere falsities, and do
violence to truths even to destroying them, may appear from the
following passages: My soul, I lie down in the midst of lions, their
teeth are spears and darts (Ps. 57:4). O God, destroy their teeth in
their mouth, break out the great teeth of the young lions (Ps. 58:6). A
nation is come up upon my land, strong, its teeth are the teeth of a
lion, and it hath the great teeth of a lion (Joel 1:6). Jehovah, Thou
breakest the teeth of the ungodly (Ps. 3:7). There came up out of the
sea a beast terrible and dreadful, and exceedingly strong, which had
great iron teeth, it devoured and crushed (Dan. 7:7). Blessed be
Jehovah, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth (Ps. 124:6). Since
sensual men do not see any truth in its own light, but ratiocinate and
dispute about everything, whether it is so; and since these disputes in
the hells are heard without as the gnashing of teeth, being in
themselves the collisions of falsity and truth, it is evident what is
signified by "the gnashing of teeth" (Matthew 8:12; 13:42, 50; 22:13;
24:51; 25:30; Luke 13:28); and in a measure what by "gnashing with the
teeth" (Job 16:9; Ps. 35:15-16; 37:12; 112:10; Micah 3:5; Lam. 2:16).

<span class="margnote"><span id="436.">436.</span></span>

Verse 9. And they had breastplates, as breastplates of iron, signifies
arguments from fallacies, by which they fight and prevail, which
appeared to them so powerful that they could not be refuted. By
"breastplates" are signified defenses, because they protect the breast;
here, defenses of falsities, which are effected by arguments from
fallacies, by which a false principle is defended. For from a false
principle nothing but falsities can flow. If truths are advanced, they
are only viewed outwardly or superficially, thus also sensually, and are
consequently falsified, and, with such persons, become fallacies. The
reason why "breastplates" have this signification, is because "wars," in
the Word, signify spiritual wars, and thence the "arms of war" signify
the various things relating to such wars; as in Jeremiah: Harness the
horses and mount, ye horsemen, and stand ye in helmets; polish the
lances, and put on the cuirass (Jer. 46:4). In Isaiah: For he put on
justice as a cuirass, and an helmet of salvation upon His head (Isa.
59:17). In David: Under His wings shalt thou trust, His truth shall be
thy shield and buckler (Ps. 91:4; besides other places; as in Ezek.
23:24; 38:4; 39:9; Nahum 2:3; Ps. 5:12; 35:2-3). "Their breastplates
were as of iron," signifies that their arguments seemed to them so
strong that they could not be refuted; for "iron" from its hardness,
signifies what is strong.

<span class="margnote"><span id="437.">437.</span></span>

And the voice of their wings was as the voice of chariots of many horses
running to war, signifies their reasonings as if they were from truths
of doctrine from the Word fully understood, for which they must ardently
fight. "The voice of wings" signifies reasonings, because "to fly"
signifies to perceive and instruct (n. 245, 415); "chariots" signify
doctrinals, as will be seen presently; "horses" signify the
understanding of the Word (n. 298); and "many horses," what is plenary;
that "running to war" signifies ardor for fighting, is evident. That "a
chariot" signifies doctrine, is plain from these passages: The chariots
of God are two myriads, thousands of peaceful ones, the Lord is among
them (Ps. 68:17). Jehovah maketh the clouds His chariots; He walketh
upon the wings of the wind (Ps. 104:2-3). Jehovah, Thou didst ride upon
thine horses, Thy chariots are salvation (Hab. 3:8). Behold, Jehovah
will come with fire and with His chariots like a whirlwind (Isa. 66:15).
Ye shall be satisfied at My table with horse and chariot; and I will set
My glory among the nations (Ezek. 39:20-21). I will cut off the chariot
from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem (Zech. 9:10). I will
overthrow the throne of kingdoms, I will overthrow the chariot, and
those that ride in them (Hag. 2:22). Set a watchman who may look, let
him announce; and he saw a chariot with a pair of horsemen, and a camel
chariot and the chariot of a man, and he said, Babylon is fallen, is
fallen (Isa. 21:6-7, 9). "Elijah" and "Elisha" represented the Lord as
to the Word, and thence signify doctrine from the Word, as did all the
prophets (n. 8), therefore they were called "the chariot of Israel and
the horsemen thereof"; and for the same reason: Elijah was seen taken
into heaven in a chariot of fire, and there were seen by Elisha's boy
chariots and horses of fire round about him (2 Kings 2:11-12; 6:17;
13:14; besides other places where "chariots" occur; as in Isa. 31:1;
37:24; 66:20; Jer. 17:25; 22:4; 46:2-3, 8-9; 50:37-38; 51:20-21; Ezek.
26:7-8, 10-11; Dan. 11:40; Nahum 3:1-3; Joel 2:1-5).

<span class="margnote"><span id="438.">438.</span></span>

Verse 10. And they had tails like unto scorpions, signifies the truths
of the Word falsified, by means of which they induce stupor. By "the
tail" is signified the ultimate of the head, because the brain is
continued through the backbone into the tail, therefore the head and
tail make one; as the first and last; when, therefore, by "the head,"
faith alone justifying and saving is signified, by "the tail" is
signified all the confirmations thereof in a summary, which are from the
Word, thus which are the truths of the Word falsified. Everyone, who
from his own intelligence assumes a principle of religion, and
establishes it as the head, also takes confirmations from the Word, and
makes them the tail; thus he induces a stupor upon others, and so hurts
them. Therefore it is said, that "they had tails like unto scorpions";
and presently after, "that there were stings in their tails, and that
their power was to hurt men"; for by "a scorpion" is signified the power
of persuasion inducing stupor upon the understanding (n. 425). That "the
tail" is a continuation of the brain through the backbone to its
ultimate, any anatomist will tell you; or merely observe a dog or any
other wild beast with a tail, and encourage and coax him, and you will
see that the ridge of his back will become smooth, and his tail move
correspondingly; but that, on the contrary, he will set his back up if
you provoke him. \[2\] The primary tenet of the understanding which is
assumed as a principle, is signified by "the head," and the ultimate
thereof by "the tail," in these passages also: He will cut off from
Israel head and tail, the old and the honored, he is the head, and the
prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail (Isa. 9:14, 15). Egypt shall
not have any work to make head and tail (Isa. 19:15). Nothing else is
signified by: The seven heads of the dragon, and by his tail, with which
he drew a third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth
(Rev. 12:4); Also by: The tails like serpents, having heads with which
they do hurt (Rev. 9:10). Since by "the tail" is signified the ultimate,
and the ultimate is the complex of all, therefore Jehovah said to Moses:
Take the serpent by the tail; and he took it, and it became a rod (Exod.
4:3-4). And therefore it was commanded that: They should take off the
tail entire near the backbone, and sacrifice it together with the fat
that was upon the entrails, kidneys, intestines, and liver (Lev. 3:9-11;
8:25; 9:19; Exod. 29:22). That the ultimate is that which contains and
comprehends all prior things, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New
Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scriptures (n. 38, 65), and in The
Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom (n.
209-222).

<span class="margnote"><span id="439.">439.</span></span>

And there were stings in their tails, and their power was to hurt men
five months, signifies subtle falsifications of the Word, by which, for
a short time, they darken and fascinate the understanding, and thus
deceive and captivate. By "stings in their tails" are signified subtle
falsifications of the Word; by "stings," subtlety; and by "tails," the
truths of the Word falsified (n. 438). By "the power to hurt," is
signified that by means of these they can induce stupor, that is, they
can darken and fascinate the understanding, and thus deceive and
captivate; "for their tails were like scorpions," and by "scorpions"
such things are signified (n. 425). By "five months" is signified for a
short time, as above (n. 427). This takes place when they quote and
apply anything from the Word; for the Word is written according to
correspondences, and correspondences are in part appearances of truth,
containing within them genuine truths. If these truths are not known in
the church, many things may be taken from the Word, which at first
appear as if in agreement with heresy; but when genuine truths are known
in the church, then the appearances of truth are rendered manifest, and
genuine truths come to view. But before this is done, a heretic, by
various things drawn from the Word, may obscure and fascinate the
understanding, and thus deceive and captivate. That this is done by
those who assert that man's sins are remitted, or, in other words, that
he is justified by an act of faith, concerning which no one knows
anything, and this in a moment, and if not before, even at the last hour
of death, might be illustrated by examples, but this is not the place to
do so. By "stings" are signified falsities from evil, doing hurt, also
in Amos: Behold, the days shall come upon you, when they shall take you
away with stings (Amos 4:2). And in Moses: That they should extirpate
the inhabitants of the land, lest they should be thorns in their eyes,
and stings in their sides (Num. 33:55). "Thorns," "briers," "brambles,"
and "thistles," also signify falsities of evil, from their stings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="440.">440.</span></span>

Verse 11. And they had a king over them, the angel of the abyss; whose
name in the Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek he hath the name
Apollyon, signifies that they are in the satanic hell who are in
falsities from lusts, and, by the total falsification of the Word, have
destroyed the church. By "the king, the angel of the abyss," is not
signified any angel who is a king there, but the falsity reigning
therein; for by "a king," in the genuine sense, is signified one who is
in truths from the affection of good, and, abstractly, that truth itself
(n. 20); and thence, in the opposite sense, by "a king" is signified one
who is in falsities from the lusts of evil, and, abstractly, that
falsity itself. By the "abyss" is signified the satanic hell, where they
are (n. 387, 421); by "name" is signified the quality of the state (n.
81, 122, 165); "Abaddon," in the Hebrew tongue, is he that destroys and
a destroyer; so "Apollyon," in the Greek tongue; and this is falsity in
outermost things, which, by the total falsification of the Word, has
destroyed the church. By "Abaddon," in the Hebrew text, is signified
destruction, in these places: Thy truth in destruction (Ps. 88:11). Hell
is naked before Him, and destruction hath no covering (Job 26:6). For a
fire consumeth even to destruction (Job 31:12). Destruction and Death
say (Job 28:22). In other places, hell and the devil are called
"destruction" and "destroyer" (Isaiah 54:16; Ezekiel 5:16; 9:1; Exod.
12:13); but by another word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="441.">441.</span></span>

Verse 12. One woe is past; behold, there come two woes more hereafter,
signifies further lamentations over the devastation of the church. That
"woe" signifies lamentation over calamity, unhappiness, and damnation,
see n. 416; here, then, by "two woes to come," are signified further
lamentations over the state of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="442.">442.</span></span>

Verse 13. And the sixth angel sounded, signifies the exploration and
manifestation of their state of life in the church of the Reformed who
are not so wise, and yet place the all of religion in faith, and think
of it alone and of nothing except it, and the customary worship, and so
live as they please. That these are treated of to the end of this
chapter, will appear from the explanation of what follows. That "to
sound" signifies to explore and make manifest the state of the church,
and thence of the life of those whose religion consists in faith alone,
may be seen above (n. 397). \[2\] These who are now treated of, are
altogether distinct from those referred to thus far in this chapter, the
falsities of whose faith were seen in the form of locusts. They are
distinct in this: those already described are studious in exploring the
arcana of justification by faith, and also in giving the signs of it,
and its testimonies, which, with them, are the goods of moral and civil
life; insisting that the precepts of the Word are indeed in themselves
Divine, but that with man they become natural, because they proceed from
his will, which have no conjunction with the spiritual things of faith;
and because they confirm these things by rational considerations, which
savor of erudition, they dwell in the southern quarter of the abyss,
according to the description above (n. 421). \[3\] But they who are
treated of in what follows to the end of the chapter, do not study those
arcana, but only make mere faith the all of religion, and nothing
besides it and the customary worship, and so live as they please. I have
been permitted to see and converse with these also; they live in the
northern quarter, in huts that are scattered about, and constructed of
reeds and rushes plastered over with lime, in which the ground is the
floor. The more ingenious, who, by means of natural light, know how to
establish that faith by reasonings, and confirm that it has nothing in
common with life, dwell in front, the more simple behind them, and the
more stupid toward the western part of that region; the multitude of
them is so great that it is incredible. They are instructed by angelic
spirits, but they who do not receive the truths of faith, and live
according to them, are let down into the hell which is under them, and
imprisoned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="443.">443.</span></span>

And I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is
before God (verse 14), saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet,
signifies a command from the Lord out of the spiritual heaven to those
who were to explore and make manifest. By "a voice" is signified a
Divine command; by "the golden altar," or altar of incense, is signified
the spiritual heaven (n. 277, 392); by "the four horns" of that altar is
signified its power (n. 270); here, the power of loosing the four angels
bound at the river Euphrates, as follows: by "the sixth angel" who had
the trumpet, is signified to those to whom the office of exploring and
making manifest these things was enjoined (n. 442).

<span class="margnote"><span id="444.">444.</span></span>

Loose the four angels that are bound at the great river Euphrates,
signifies that external bonds should be removed from them, that the
interiors of their minds might appear. That this is the signification of
these words, no one can know, and scarcely can suspect, unless he knows
what is meant by "the great river Euphrates," and what by "the four
angels bound there." By "Euphrates," in the Word, are signified the
interiors of man's mind, which are called things rational, which, with
those who are in truths from good, are full of wisdom, but in those who
are in falsities from evil, are full of insanity. The reason why these
are signified in the Word by "the river Euphrates," is, because that
river divided the land of Canaan from Assyria; and by "the land of
Canaan" was signified the church; and by "Assyria," its rational; and
thence by the river which bounded it, are signified the interiors of the
mind which are called rational, in both senses. For there are three
things which constitute the man of the church, the spiritual, the
rational or intellectual, and the natural, which is also the scientific.
The spiritual of the church was signified by "the land of Canaan" and
its rivers; the rational or intellectual of the church, by "Ashur" or
"Assyria" and its "river Euphrates;" and the natural, which is also the
scientific of the church, by "Egypt" and its "river" the Nile; but
concerning these more may be seen below (n. 503). By "the four angels
bound at the river Euphrates," are signified those interiors with the
men of the church which are said "to be bound," because they are not
openly avowed; for they are infernal spirits, who are meant by these
four angels, since it is said of them, in what follows (n. 446), that
"they were prepared to kill the third part of men," and the interiors of
men make one with spirits, either infernal or celestial, because they
cohabit: by "loosing them" is signified to remove external bonds, that
the interiors of their minds may appear. Such is the signification of
these words. \[2\] By "Euphrates" are signified the interiors of man's
mind bordering upon the spiritual things of his church, may appear from
those passages in the Word where "Ashur" or "Assyria" is mentioned; but
"Euphrates" occurs in the opposite sense, in which it signifies the
interiors full of falsities and thence of insanities, in these passages:
Behold, God bringeth up over them the waters of the river (Euphrates)
strong and many; the King of Assyria, he shall go through Judah; he
shall overflow and go over (Isa. 8:7-8). What hast thou to do with the
way of Egypt, that thou drinkest the waters of Sihor? and what hast thou
to do with the way of Assyria, that thou drinkest the waters of the
river? (Jer. 2:18). Jehovah shall curse the tongue of the sea of Egypt,
and shall shake His hand over the river Euphrates (Isa. 11:15-16). The
sixth angel poured out his vial upon the river Euphrates, whose water
was dried up (Rev. 16:12). It was commanded the prophet that he should
put a girdle upon his loins, and should afterwards hide it in a hole of
a rock by the Euphrates, and when after a short time he took it again,
behold, it was rotten, nor was it good for anything (Jer. 13:1-7, 11).
And it was also commanded him that after he should finish reading the
book, he should throw it into the midst of the Euphrates, and say, Thus
shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise again (Jer. 51:63-64). By these
things the interiors of the state of the church with the sons of Israel
were represented. That the "river of Egypt," the Nile, and "the river of
Assyria," the Euphrates, were the boundaries of the land of Canaan, is
manifest from this: Jehovah made a covenant with Abraham, Unto thy seed
will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even to the great river
Euphrates (Gen. 15:18). That the Euphrates was a boundary, see Exodus
23:31; Deuteronomy 1:7, 8; 11:24; Joshua 1:4; Micah 7:12.

<span class="margnote"><span id="445.">445.</span></span>

Verse 15. And the four angels were loosed, signifies that when the
external bonds were taken away, the interiors of their minds appeared.
This follows from what is said above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="446.">446.</span></span>

Prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year, to kill a third
part of men, signifies that they were in the perpetual effort to take
away from the men of the church spiritual light and life. By "prepared"
is signified that they were in the effort; by "an hour, a day, a month,
and a year," is signified continually and perpetually, the same as by
"all time;" by "to kill" is signified to take away spiritual light and
life from the men of the church (n. 325); and the third part signifies
all (n. 400).

<span class="margnote"><span id="447.">447.</span></span>

Verse 16. And the number of the armies of horsemen was two myriads of
myriads, signifies reasonings concerning faith alone, with which the
interiors of their minds were filled, from the abundance of mere
falsities of evil. By "armies" are signified goods and truths; and, in
the opposite sense, evils and falsities; here, the falsities of evil, of
which below. By "horsemen" are signified reasonings concerning faith
alone; because by "a horse" is signified the understanding of the Word
(n. 298); and also the understanding of the Word destroyed (n. 305, 313,
320); therefore by "horsemen" are signified reasonings from the
understanding of the Word destroyed; here, concerning faith alone;
because they who are principled therein are treated of. By "two myriads
of myriads" are not meant so many in number, but a great abundance;
"two" are mentioned, because two are predicated of good, and, in the
opposite sense, of evil (n. 322); and "myriads" are predicated of
truths, and, in the opposite sense, of falsities (n. 287). Hence it may
be seen that by "the number of the armies of horsemen, two myriads of
myriads," are signified reasonings concerning faith alone, with which
the interiors of their minds were filled, from the abundance of mere
falsities of evil. \[2\] That by "armies," in the Word, are signified
the goods and truths of heaven and the church, and, in the opposite
sense, evils and falsities, may appear from those places where the sun,
moon, and stars are called "armies" (hosts); and by "the sun" is
signified the good of love; by "the moon," the truth of faith; and by
"the stars," the knowledges of good and truth; and the contrary, in the
opposite sense (n. 51, 53, 332, 413); both the former and the latter are
called "armies" (hosts), in these passages: Praise Jehovah all His
hosts, praise ye Him sun and moon, praise Him all stars (Ps. 148:2-3).
My hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their hosts have I
commanded (Isa. 45:12). By the Word of Jehovah were the heavens made,
and all the host of them by the breath of His mouth (Ps. 33:6). The
heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them (Gen.
2:1). The horn of the he-goat grew even to the host of the heavens; and
it cast down unto the earth from the host and from the stars; yea, it
raised itself up even to the prince of the host: and the host was
delivered to it on account of the continual sacrifice for transgression,
because he cast down the truth to the earth: the Holy One said, How long
is the holy place and the host given to be trodden down? (Dan. 8:10-14).
Jehovah uttered His voice before the army (Joel 2:11). Upon the roofs of
the houses they have offered incense to all the host of the heavens
(Jer. 19:13). Lest thou shouldst bow thyself down and serve the sun, the
moon, the stars, and all the hosts of the heavens (Deut. 4:19; 17:3;
Jer. 8:2; so too in Isa. 13:4; 34:4; 40:26; Jer. 33:22; Zech. 9:8; Rev.
19:14). \[3\] Since the goods and truths of heaven and the church are
signified by "the hosts (armies) of the heavens," the Lord is therefore
called "Jehovah Zebaoth," that is, Jehovah of armies (hosts); and on
this account the ministry of the Levites was called a military service
(Numbers 4:3, 23, 30, 39); and it is said in David: Bless Jehovah, all
His hosts, His ministers that do His will (Ps. 103:21). The evils and
falsities in the church are signified by: The army of the nations (Isa.
34:2). The army of the king of the north with which he came against the
king of the south (Dan. 11:13, 15, 20). "The king of the north" is the
falsity of evil in the church, and "the king of the south" is the truth
of good therein. It is said by the Lord: When ye shall see Jerusalem
encompassed with armies, know that its devastation is near (Luke 21:20).
By "Jerusalem" the church is here signified, and by "armies" the evils
and falsities which were devastating it. The consummation of the age is
there treated of, which is the last time of the church. Evils and
falsities are signified by armies in Joel: I will recompense to you the
years which the locust hath consumed, the canker worm, the caterpillar,
and the palmer worm, the great army, which I have sent among you (Joel
2:25). That by "the locust" and the rest falsity in outermost things is
signified, may be seen above (n. 424).

And I heard the number of them, signifies their quality perceived, that
it was as follows: By "hearing" is signified to perceive: by "number"
the quality and state of a thing is signified (n. 10, 348, 364). It is
the quality of their state as now follows, because it is described in
the following; on which account it is said, "and thus I saw."

Verse 17. And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat
upon them, signifies that then it was discovered that the reasonings of
the interiors of their minds concerning faith alone were imaginary and
visionary, and that they themselves were insane from them. "To see"
signifies to discover their quality; by "horses" are signified the
reasonings of the interiors of their minds concerning faith alone; in
the present case, imaginary and visionary reasonings, because it is
said, that he saw them "in vision." By "those sitting upon horses" are
signified such as are intelligent from the Word understood, but here,
such as are insane from imaginary and visionary things which are
contrary to the Word. \[2\] Because the interiors of their minds
appeared under such forms as signify imaginary and visionary reasonings
concerning faith alone, a few of them, which I have heard from their own
mouths, shall be made public; as these: "Was not faith alone, after the
grievous fall of man, made the only means of salvation? How can we
appear before God without that means? Is it not the only means? Are we
not born in sins, and is not our nature entirely corrupted by the
transgression of Adam? Can there be any other means of healing but faith
alone? What can our works contribute towards this? Who can do any good
work from himself; who can purify, forgive, justify, and save himself?
Does not merit and self-righteousness lurk in every work that man does
from himself? And if, perchance, we should do anything that was good,
could we do all, and fulfil the law? Besides, if anyone sins against one
commandment, he sins against all, because they cohere. Why did the Lord
come into the world, and suffer so grievously on the cross, but to take
away from us damnation and the curse of the law, to reconcile God the
Father, and become merit and righteousness alone, which might be imputed
to man through faith? Otherwise, what good could be answered by His
coming? Since, then, Christ suffered for us, and fulfilled the law for
us, and took away its right of condemnation, can evil then any longer
condemn, and can good save us? Therefore we who have faith, are in the
full liberty of thinking, willing, speaking, and doing whatever we
please, provided we do no injury to our reputation, honor, and interest,
nor incur the penalties of the civil law, which would be a disgrace and
hurt to us." Some, who wander further north, said, "That good works,
which are done for the sake of salvation, are hurtful, pernicious and
cursed; among these, also, there were some presbyters. \[3\] These
things are what I heard, but they mumbled and muttered many more, which
I did not hear. They spoke, also, shamelessly with all license, and were
lascivious, both in words and deeds, without fear for any wicked deed,
except out of pretense, for the sake of appearing honest. Such are the
interiors of the mind, and thence the exteriors of the body of those who
make faith alone the all of religion. But all those things, which were
uttered by them, fall to the ground, if the Lord Himself, the Savior, is
immediately approached, and believed in, and good is done, each for the
sake of salvation, and by man as from himself, with a belief, however,
that it is from the Lord. Unless these things are done as by man,
neither faith nor charity can be given at all; nor, consequently, can
religion nor salvation.

Having breastplates of fire, and jacinth, and brimstone, signifies their
imaginary and visionary arguments from infernal love and their own
intelligence, and from the lusts thence. By "breastplates" are signified
arguments from which they fight for faith alone (n. 436); by "fire" is
signified celestial love, and in the opposite sense, infernal love (n.
452, 468, 494); by "jacinth" is signified intelligence from spiritual
love, and, in the opposite sense, intelligence from infernal love, which
is one's own intelligence, of which below; and by "brimstone" is
signified lusts from that love through one's own intelligence (n. 452).
Hence it follows, that by "breastplates of fire, jacinth, and
brimstone," such things are signified. \[2\] The reason why their
arguments in favor of faith alone are thus described, is because all
they who believe themselves justified, that is, absolved from sins by
faith alone, never think of repentance; and an impenitent man is in mere
sins, and all sins are derived from, and thence draw their nature from
infernal love, one's own intelligence, and from the lusts thence; and
they who are in these things, not only act from them, but also speak,
yea, think and will, and consequently reason and argue from them; these
constitute, indeed, the very man, because they are his very life; but a
man devil, and his life which is an infernal life. They who live a moral
life, only for the sake of themselves and the world, do not know this;
the reason is, because their interiors are infernal whilst their
exteriors are similar to the exteriors of those who live a Christian
life: let them know, however, that everyone, when he dies, comes into
his interiors, because he becomes a spirit, this being the internal man;
and then the interiors accommodate the exteriors to themselves, and they
become alike; wherefore the morality of their life in the world then
becomes as the scales of fishes which are wiped away. The case is quite
different with those who hold the precepts of moral life to be Divine,
and then also civil, because they are of love towards the neighbor.
\[3\] "A jacinth" signifies intelligence from the affection of spiritual
love, because that color partakes of the redness of fire and the
whiteness of light; and by "fire" is signified love; and by "light,"
intelligence: this intelligence is signified by: The hyacinthine blue in
the coverings and veils of the tabernacle (Exod. 26:31, 36; 27:16). In
Aaron's ephod (Exod. 28:6, 15). By the cloth of hyacinth which was
placed over the ark, the table, the candlestick, and the altar, when
they journeyed (Num. 4:6-7, 9, 11-12). By the thread of blue on the
skirts of their garments (Num. 15:38-39). And by hyacinth (Ezek. 27:7,
24). But intelligence from the affection of infernal love, is signified
by "hyacinth" in Ezekiel: Oholah, or Samaria, committed whoredom and
delighted in her lovers, the Assyrians, her neighbors, clothed in
hyacinth, horsemen riding upon horses (Ezek. 23:4-6). Hereby the church
is described, which, by reasonings from their own intelligence, had
falsified the truths of the Word. And in Jeremiah: They are infatuated
and foolish; the teaching of vanities is wood; silver spread into plates
is brought from Tarshish, the work of the workmen and of the hands of
the founder; hyacinth and purple is their clothing, they are all the
work of the wise (Jer. 10:8-9). "The work of the workmen and of the
hands of the founder, and all the work of the wise," signify here, that
they are all from their own intelligence.
