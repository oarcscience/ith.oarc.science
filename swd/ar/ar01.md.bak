### Apocalypse Revealed

<span class="margnote"><span id="1.">1.</span></span>

Revelation 1 1. The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto Him,
to show unto His servants things which must shortly come to pass; and He
signified, sending by His angel to His servant John, 2. Who testified
the Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, whatsoever he saw.
3. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear, the words of the
prophecy, and keep the things written therein: for the time is near. 4.
John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and
peace, from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the
seven spirits who are before His throne; 5. And from Jesus Christ, who
is the faithful witness, the first-born from the dead, and the prince of
the kings of the earth. To Him that loveth us, and washeth us from our
sins in His blood: 6. And He maketh us kings and priests unto God and
His Father: to Him be glory and might for ever and ever. 7. Behold He
cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, and they who
pierced Him: and all the tribes of the earth shall wail because of Him.
Even so; Amen. 8. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the
End, saith the Lord, who is, and who was, and who is to come, the
Almighty. 9. I, John, who also am your brother, and companion in
affliction, and in the kingdom and patient expectation of Jesus Christ,
was in the island called Patmos, for the Word of God, and for the
testimony of Jesus Christ. 10. I became in the spirit on the Lord's day;
and I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, 11. Saying, I am
the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last: and, what thou seest,
write in a book, and send to the churches which are in Asia; unto
Ephesus, and Smyrna, and Pergamos, and Thyatira, and Sardis, and
Philadelphia, and Laodicea. 12. And I turned to see the voice that spoke
with me: and, having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands; 13. And in
the midst of the seven lampstands One like unto the Son of Man, clothed
with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden
girdle. 14. And His head and His hairs were white as white wool, like
snow; and His eyes as a flame of fire; 15. And His feet like unto fine
brass, as if glowing in a furnace; and His voice as the voice of many
waters; 16. And having in His right hand seven stars; and out of His
mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth; and His face was as the sun
shineth in His power. 17. And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as
dead. And He laid His right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am
the First and the Last; 18. And am He that liveth, and was dead; and
behold I am alive for ages of ages. Amen; and I have the keys of hell
and of death. 19. Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things
which are, and the things which shall be hereafter. 20. The mystery of
the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand, and the seven golden
lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches; and
the seven lampstands, which thou sawest, are the seven churches. THE
SPIRITUAL SENSE The contents of the whole chapter That this Revelation
is from the Lord alone, and that it is received by those who will be in
His New Church, which is the New Jerusalem, and acknowledge the Lord as
the God of heaven and earth; the Lord is also described as to the Word.

lampstands," signifies arcana in the visions concerning the New Heaven
and the New Church (n. 64). "The seven stars are the angels of the seven
churches," signifies the New Church in the heavens, which is the New
Heaven (n. 65). "And the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the
seven churches," signifies the New Church on earth, which is the New
Jerusalem descending from the Lord out of the New Heaven. THE
EXPLANATION What the spiritual sense is, has been hitherto unknown. That
there is such a sense in every particular of the Word, and that without
it, the Word in many places cannot be understood, has been shown in the
Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 5-26).
This sense does not appear in the literal sense, for it is in it as the
soul in its body. It is known that there is the spiritual and the
natural, and that the spiritual flows into the natural, and presents
itself to be seen and felt in the forms which fall under the sight and
touch, and that the spiritual, without such forms, is not perceived
otherwise than as affection and thought, or as love and wisdom which are
of the mind. That affection and thought, or love whose property it is to
be affected, and wisdom whose property it is to think, are spiritual, is
acknowledged. That these two faculties of the soul present themselves in
the body in forms which are called the organs of sense and motion, is
known; also, that they make one, and such a one as that when the mind
thinks, the mouth in an instant speaks, and when the mind wills, the
body in an instant acts; hence it is evident, that there is a perfect
union of things spiritual and natural with man. \[2\] It is similar in
each and everything in the world; there is in them the spiritual, which
is the inmost of the cause, and there is the natural, which is its
effect, and these two make one; and the spiritual does not appear in the
natural, because it is in it as the soul in the body, and as the inmost
of the cause in the effect, as was said before. It is similar with the
Word; that this in its bosom is spiritual, because it is Divine, can be
denied by no one; but as the spiritual does not appear in the sense of
the letter, which is natural, therefore the spiritual sense has been
hitherto unknown; nor could it have been known before genuine truths
were revealed by the Lord, for that sense is in these. For this reason
Revelation has not been understood before. But lest there should be
doubt that such things are within it, the particulars must be explained,
and demonstrated by similar passages elsewhere in the Word. The
explanation and demonstration now follow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2.">2.</span></span>

Verse 1. The revelation of Jesus Christ, signifies predictions from the
Lord concerning Himself and His church, what the latter will be in its
end, and what it will be afterwards, as well in the heavens as upon
earth. By "the revelation of Jesus Christ" are signified all
predictions, which because they are from the Lord, are called the
Revelation of Jesus Christ; that they relate to the Lord and His church,
will appear from the explanations. In Revelation it does not treat of
the successive states of the church, still less of the successive states
of kingdoms, as some have hitherto believed, but there from beginning to
end it treats of the last state of the church in the heavens and on the
earth; and then concerning the Last Judgment; and after this of the New
Church, which is the New Jerusalem. That this New Church is the end of
this work, is evident, wherefore those things which precede refer to the
state of the church, as to its quality just before it. But in what
series these are treated of, may be seen from the contents of each
chapter; and more distinctly from the explanation of each particular
verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3.">3.</span></span>

Which God gave unto Him to show unto His servants, signifies for those
who are in faith from charity, or in truths of wisdom from the good of
love. By "showing" is signified to manifest, and by "servants" are here
signified those who are in faith from charity; to them these things are
manifested, because they understand and receive them. By servants, in
the spiritual sense, are meant those who are in truths; and because
truths are from good, by servants are meant those who are in truths from
good, thus also, those who are in wisdom from love, because wisdom is of
truth, and love is of good; also those who are in faith derived from
charity, because faith also is of truth and charity is of good; and as
the genuine spiritual sense is abstracted from person, therefore in it
by servants are signified truths. Now as truths are serviceable to good
by teaching it, therefore, in general, and properly, by "servant" in the
Word is meant what is serviceable, or he or that which serves; in this
sense not only the prophets are called the servants of God, but also the
Lord as to His Human; that the prophets are called the servants of God
is evident from the following passages: Jehovah hath sent unto you all
His servants the prophets (Jer. 25:4). He revealeth His secret unto His
servants the prophets (Amos 3:7). He set before you <span
id="fr_3"></span>[3-1](#fn_3.md) by the hand of His servants the prophets
(Dan. 9:10); And Moses is called "The servant of Jehovah" (Mal. 4:4).
The reason is that by a prophet in the spiritual sense is meant the
truth of doctrine, as explained below. \[2\] And because the Lord was
the Divine truth itself, which also is the Word, and from this was
Himself called the Prophet; and served in the world, and serves all to
eternity by teaching, therefore, He also, in many places, is called the
servant of Jehovah; as in the following passages: He shall see of the
labor of His soul, and shall be satisfied; by His knowledge shall my
righteous servant justify many (Isa. 53:11). Behold, my servant shall
deal prudently, He shall be extolled and exalted and be lifted up
greatly (Isa. 52:13). Behold, my servant, on whom I lean, mine elect, in
whom my soul hath good pleasure, I have put my spirit upon Him (Isa.
42:1, 19); this is spoken of the Lord: in like manner David is called a
servant, where, by him, the Lord is meant; as in the following passages:
And I Jehovah will be their God, and My servant David a prince in the
midst of them (Ezek. 34:24). My servant, David, shall be king over them,
that there may be one shepherd to them all (Ezek. 37:24). I will protect
this city to preserve it, for My sake and My servant David's (Isa.
37:35). So also in Psalm 78:70-72, 89:3-4, 20. That by David in these
places is meant the Lord, may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Lord (n. 43-44). The Lord Himself says the same of
Himself: Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister,
and whosoever will be first let him be your servant, as the Son of man
came not to be ministered unto, but to minister (Matt. 20:25-28; Mark
10:42-44; Luke 22:27; likewise Luke 12:37). This the Lord says, because
by servant and minister is meant one who serves and ministers by
teaching, and abstractly from person, the Divine truth, which was
himself. \[3\] Since, therefore, by servant is meant he who teaches
Divine truth, it is evident that by servants in this place in Revelation
are meant those who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity,
because these can teach from the Lord, that is, the Lord can teach and
minister through them. In this sense they are called servants in
Matthew: In the consummation of the age, who is the faithful and prudent
servant, whom his Lord shall set over his household, to give them their
food in its season; blessed is that servant whom the Lord when He
cometh, shall find so doing (Matt. 24:45-46). And in Luke: Blessed are
those servants, whom the Lord when He cometh, shall find watching:
verily, I say unto you, that He shall gird Himself, and make them to
recline, and shall Himself come near and minister unto them (Luke
12:37). In heaven all are called servants of the Lord who are in his
spiritual kingdom; but they who are in his celestial kingdom are called
ministers; the reason is, that they who are in his spiritual kingdom,
are in wisdom from Divine truth; and they who are in his celestial
kingdom are in love from Divine good; and good ministers and truth
serves. But in the opposite sense, by servants are meant those who serve
the devil; these are in a state of servitude itself; but they who serve
the Lord are in a state of liberty; as the Lord also teaches (John
8:32-36).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4.">4.</span></span>

Things which must shortly come to pass signifies that they will
certainly be, lest the church perish. By coming to pass shortly, is not
meant that the things which are foretold in Revelation, will happen
immediately and speedily, but certainly; and that unless they do happen
the church must perish. In the Divine idea, and thence in the spiritual
sense, there is no time, but instead of time there is state; and because
shortly relates to time, by it is signified certainly, and that it will
come to pass before its time, for Revelation was given in the first
century, and since that seventeen centuries have now elapsed, from which
it is evident, that by shortly is signified that which corresponds to
it, and that is, certainly. \[2\] The like is also involved in these
words of the Lord: Except those days should be shortened, there should
no flesh be saved; but for the elect's sake, those days shall be
shortened (Matt. 24:22); by which also is meant that unless the church
should come to an end before its time, it would altogether perish; in
that chapter the consummation of the age and the Lord's coming are
treated of; and by the consummation of the age is meant the last state
of the old church, and by the Lord's coming, the first state of the new
church. \[3\] It was said that in the Divine idea there is not time, but
the presence of all things past and future; wherefore it is said in
David: A thousand years in Thy sight are as yesterday (Ps. 90:4); I will
declare the decree, Jehovah hath said unto Me, Thou art My Son, this day
have I begotten Thee (Ps. 2:7). "This day" is the presence of the Lord's
advent. Thence also it is, that an entire period is called day in the
Word, and its first state the dawning and the morning, and the last
evening and night.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5.">5.</span></span>

And He signified, sending by, His angel to His servant John, signifies
the things which are revealed from the Lord through heaven to those who
are in the good of life from charity and its faith. By "He signified,
sending by His angel," in the spiritual sense, is meant the things which
are revealed from heaven, or through heaven by the Lord: for by "angel"
in the Word is everywhere meant the angelic heaven, and in the supreme
sense the Lord Himself; the reason is, that no angel ever speaks with
man separate from heaven; for there is such a conjunction there of each
with all, that everyone speaks from the communion, although the angel is
not conscious of it. For heaven in the sight of the Lord is as one man,
whose soul is the Lord Himself; wherefore the Lord speaks with man
through heaven, as man does from his soul through his body with another;
and this is done in conjunction with all and each of the things of his
mind, in the midst of which are the things which he speaks. But this
arcanum cannot be unfolded in a few words. It is partly unfolded in The
Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and the Divine Wisdom. Hence
it is evident, that by "an angel" is signified heaven, and in the
supreme sense the Lord. The reason why by "angel" the Lord is meant in
the supreme sense, is, because heaven is not heaven from the things
proper to the angels, but from the Divine of the Lord, from which is
derived their love and wisdom, yea, their life. Hence it is that the
Lord Himself is called "Angel" in the Word. From these things it is
manifest that the angel did not speak from himself with John; but the
Lord by means of heaven through him. \[2\] By these words is meant, that
they were revealed to those who are in the good of life from charity and
its faith, because these are meant by "John." For by the "twelve
disciples" or "apostles" of the Lord, are meant all who are of the
church in truths from good; and in the abstract sense, all things of the
church; and by "Peter," all who are in faith, and, abstractly, faith
itself; by "James," they who are in charity, and, abstractly, charity
itself; by "John," they who are in the good of life from charity and its
faith, and, abstractly, the good of life itself therefrom. That these
things are meant by "John," "James," and "Peter" in the Word of the
evangelists, may be seen in the small work on The New Jerusalem and Its
Heavenly Doctrine, published at London in the year 1758, (n. 122). \[3\]
Since the good of life from charity and its faith makes the church,
therefore through the apostle John were revealed the arcana concerning
the state of the church which are contained in his visions. That by all
the names of persons and places in the Word are signified things of
heaven and the church, is shown in many places in Arcana Coelestia, also
published at London. From these things it may appear, that by "He
signified, sending by His angel to His servant John," is meant in the
spiritual sense, what is revealed by the Lord through heaven to those
who are in the good of life from charity and its faith; for charity
through faith operates good, and not charity by itself, nor faith by
itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6.">6.</span></span>

Verse 2. Who testified the Word of God, and the testimony of Jesus
Christ, signifies who, from the heart, and thus in the light, receive
the Divine truth from the Word, and acknowledge the Lord's Human to be
Divine. It is said of John that "he testified the Word of God," but as
by John are meant all who are in the good of life from charity and its
faith, as was said above (n. 5), therefore in the spiritual sense all
these are meant. The angels, who are in the spiritual sense of the Word,
never know any name of a person mentioned in the Word, but only that
which the person represents and thence signifies, which, instead of
John, is the good of life, or good in act; consequently all in the
aggregate who are in that good. These "testify," that is, see,
acknowledge, receive from the heart in the light, and confess the truths
of the Word, especially that truth therein that the Lord's Human is
Divine; which may be evident from the passages quoted from the Word in
great abundance in the Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the
Lord. By "Jesus Christ" and by "the Lamb" in the Apocalypse is meant the
Lord as to the Divine Human, and by "God," the Lord as to His Divine,
from which are all things. \[2\] With regard to the spiritual
signification of "testifying," this is predicated of truth, because in
the world the truth is to be testified, and when it is testified, it is
acknowledged. But in heaven truth testifies of itself because it is
itself the light of heaven. For when the angels hear the truth, they
immediately know and acknowledge it; and because the Lord is the truth
itself, as He Himself teaches in John 14:6, He is in heaven the
testimony of Himself. Hence it may appear what is meant by "the
testimony of Jesus Christ"; wherefore the Lord says: Ye sent unto John,
and he testified unto the truth; but I receive not testimony from man
(John 5:33-34). And in another place: John came for a witness, to bear
witness of the Light; he was not that Light; the Word which was with
God, and was God, and became flesh, was the true Light, which lighteth
every man (John 1:1-2, 7-8, 14, 34). And in another place: Jesus said,
Though I testify of Myself, yet My testimony is true, for I know whence
I came, and whither I go (John 8:14). When the Comforter has come, even
the Spirit of truth, He shall testify of Me (John 15:26). By the
Comforter, the Spirit of truth, is meant the truth itself proceeding
from the Lord, wherefore it is said of it that it will not speak from
itself, but from the Lord (John 16:13-15).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7.">7.</span></span>

Whatsoever he saw, signifies their enlightenment in all things which are
in this Revelation. By "whatsoever he saw," in the spiritual sense, are
not meant what John saw, for they were only visions, but the things
which they see who are meant by John, who are those who are in the good
of life from charity and its faith, as was said above. These see in the
visions of John, the arcana concerning the state of the church, not so
much when they read them, but when they see them revealed. Moreover to
see signifies to understand; on this account in common discourse it is
said, that one sees a thing, and he sees that it is the truth; for man
has sight as to his spirit as well as to his body. But man with his
spirit sees spiritual things, because from the light of heaven, but with
his body he sees natural things; because this sees from the light of the
world, and spiritual things are real, but natural things are their
forms. It is the spiritual sight of man which is called the
understanding. From these things it is evident what is meant, in the
spiritual sense, by "whatsoever things he saw;" in like manner in what
follows, where it is said that he saw.

Verse 3. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the
prophecy, and keep the things which are written therein, signifies the
communion of those with the angels of heaven, who live according to the
Doctrine of the New Jerusalem. By "blessed," is here meant one who, as
to his spirit, is in heaven; thus, one who, while he lives in the world,
is in communion with the angels of heaven; for as to his spirit he is in
heaven. By "the words of the prophecy" nothing else is meant than the
Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, for by "prophet," in the abstract sense,
is signified the Doctrine of the church derived from the Word, thus here
the Doctrine of the New Church, which is the New Jerusalem; the same is
signified by "prophecy." By "reading, hearing, and keeping the things
which are written therein," is signified, to desire to know that
doctrine; to attend to the things which are in it, and to do the things
which are therein; in short, to live according to it. That they are not
blessed who only read, hear and keep or retain in the memory the things
which were seen by John, is evident (see below, n. 944). \[2\] The
reason why "a prophet" signifies the Doctrine of the church from the
Word, and "prophecy" the same, is, because the Word was written through
prophets, and in heaven a person is regarded according to that which
belongs to his function and office. From this, also, is every man,
spirit, and angel, named there. Therefore, when a prophet is mentioned,
because his function was to write and teach the Word, the Word is meant
as to doctrine, or doctrine from the Word. Hence it is, that the Lord,
because He is the Word itself, was called the Prophet (Deut. 18:15-20,
Matt. 13:57, chap. 21:11, Luke 13:33). To show that by "prophet" is
meant the doctrine of the church from the Word, some passages shall be
adduced, from which this may be collected. In Matthew: In the
consummation of the age many false prophets shall rise up, and shall
seduce many. There shall arise false Christs and false prophets, and, if
it were possible, they shall lead into error the elect (Matt. 24:11,
24). "The consummation of the age" is the last time of the church, which
is now, when there are not false prophets, but falsities of doctrine.
\[3\] In the same: He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet,
shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a just man in
the name of a just man, shall receive a just man's reward (Matt. 10:41).
"To receive a prophet in the name of a prophet," is to receive the truth
of doctrine because it is true; and "to receive a just man in the name
of a just man," is to receive good for the sake of good; and "to receive
a reward," is to be saved according to reception. It is evident that no
one receives a reward, or is saved, because he receives a prophet and a
just man in the name of such. Those words cannot be understood by
anyone, without a knowledge of what "a prophet" and "a just man"
signify; nor can those which follow: Whosoever shall give to drink unto
one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a
disciple, shall not lose his reward (Matt. 10:42). By a "disciple" is
meant charity, and at the same time faith from the Lord. \[4\] In Joel:
I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, so that your sons and your
daughters shall prophesy (Joel. 2:28). This is concerning the church
which was to be established by the Lord, in which they would not
prophesy, but receive doctrine, which is to "prophesy." In Matthew:
Jesus said, Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
prophesied in thy name? but then will I confess unto them, I have not
known you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity (Matt. 7:22-23). Who
does not see, that they will not say that they have prophesied, but that
they knew the doctrine of the church, and taught it? In Revelation: The
time is come for judging the dead and for giving reward to the prophets
(Rev. 11:18); and in another place: Exult, O heaven, and holy apostles
and prophets, for God hath judged your judgment (Rev. 18:20). It is
evident that a reward would not be given to the prophets alone, and that
the apostles and prophets would not alone exult at the Last Judgment,
but all who have received the truths of doctrine, and have lived
according to them. These, therefore, are meant by "apostles" and
"prophets." \[5\] In Moses: Jehovah said unto Moses, I have made thee a
god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet (Exod. 7:1);
"a god" here means the Divine truth as to reception from the Lord, in
which sense the angels are also called gods, and by "prophet" is meant
one who teaches and speaks it, therefore Aaron is there called a
prophet. The same is signified by "prophet" in other places, as in the
following: The law shall not perish from the priest, nor the Word from
the prophet (Jer. 18:18). From the prophets of Jerusalem hath gone forth
hypocrisy into all the land (Jer. 23:15-16). The prophets shall become
wind, and the Word is not in them (Jer. 5:13). The priests and the
prophets err through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they
stagger in judgment (Isa. 28:7). The sun setteth over the prophets, and
the day groweth dark over them (Micah 3:6). From the prophet even unto
the priest, everyone doeth a lie (Jer. 8:10). \[6\] In these passages,
by "prophets" and "priests," in the spiritual sense, are not meant
prophets and priests, but the entire church; by "prophets," the church
as to the truth of doctrine, and by "priests" the church as to the good
of life, both of which were destroyed; these things are so understood by
the angels in heaven; while by men in the world they are understood
according to the sense of the letter. That the prophets represented the
state of the church as to doctrine, and that the Lord represented it as
to the Word itself, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Lord (n. 15-17).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9.">9.</span></span>

For the time is near, signifies that the state of the church is such,
that it cannot endure any longer as to its conjunction with the Lord.
There are two essentials by which conjunction with the Lord, and thence
salvation is effected, the acknowledgment of one God, and repentance of
life; but at this day, instead of the acknowledgment of one God, there
is an acknowledgment of three, and instead of repentance of life, there
is repentance of the mouth only that one is a sinner; and by these two
there is not any conjunction; therefore unless the New Church should
arise, which acknowledges these two essentials, and lives accordingly,
no one can be saved; on account of this danger the time is shortened by
the Lord, according to His words in Matthew: For then shall be great
affliction, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this
time, nor shall be; yea, except those days should be shortened, no flesh
should be saved (Matt. 24:21-22). That near or nearness of time is not
meant, may be seen below (n. 947).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10.">10.</span></span>

Verse 4. John to the seven churches, signifies to all who are in the
Christian world where the Word is, and by it the Lord is known, and who
draw near to the church. By the "seven churches" are not meant seven
churches, but all who are of the church in the Christian world; for
numbers, in the Word, signify things, and "seven," all things and all,
and thence, also, what is full and perfect, and it occurs in the Word
where anything holy is treated of, and in the opposite sense, of
anything profane; consequently, this number involves what is holy, and,
in the opposite sense, what is profane. The reason why numbers signify
things, or rather resemble certain adjectives to substantives adding
some quality to the things, is, because number is, in itself, natural;
for natural things are determined by numbers, but spiritual things by
things and their states. Therefore, he who does not know the
signification of numbers in the Word, and especially in Revelation,
cannot know the many arcana which are contained therein. Now, since
"seven" signifies all things and all, it may appear that by the "seven
churches" are meant all who are in the Christian world where the Word
is, and by it the Lord is known. These, if they live according to the
Lord's precepts in the Word, make the church itself. \[2\] Hence it is
that the Sabbath was instituted on the seventh day, and the seventh year
was called the sabbatical year; and the seven times seventh year the
Jubilee, by which was signified everything holy in the church: for this
cause, also, a week, in Daniel, and elsewhere, signifies an entire
period from beginning to end, and is predicated of the church. Similar
things are signified by seven in the following passages, as by: The
seven golden lampstands, in the midst of which was the Son of Man (Rev.
1:13). The seven stars in his right hand (Rev. 1:16, 20). The seven
spirits of God (Rev. 1:4; 4:5). The seven lamps of fire (Rev. 4:5). The
seven angels, to whom were given seven trumpets (Rev. 8:2). The seven
angels having the seven last plagues (Rev. 15:5-6). The seven vials full
of the seven last plagues (Rev. 16:1; 21:9). The seven seals with which
the book was sealed (Rev. 5:1). In like manner in the following places
that: Their hands should be filled seven days (Exod. 29:35). They should
be sanctified seven days (Exod. 29:37). When they were consecrated they
should go clothed in the garments of holiness seven days (Exod. 29:30).
They were not to go out of the door of the tent seven days, when they
were initiated into the priesthood (Lev. 8:33, 35). An atonement was to
be made seven times upon the horns of the altar (Lev. 16:18-19). The
altar was to be sanctified with oil seven times (Lev. 8:11). The blood
was to be sprinkled seven times before the veil (Lev. 4:16-17). And also
seven times toward the east (Lev. 16:12-15.) The water of separation was
to be sprinkled seven times towards the tent (Num. 19:4). The passover
was celebrated seven days; and unleavened bread was eaten seven days
(Exod. 12:15; Deut. 16:4-7). In like manner: The Jews were to be
punished seven times more for their sins (Lev. 26:18, 21, 24, 28).
Wherefore David says: Recompense unto our neighbor sevenfold into their
bosom (Ps. 79:12). \[3\] Sevenfold is fully. Likewise in these places:
The sayings of Jehovah are pure sayings, silver purified in the furnace
seven times (Ps. 12:6). The hungry ceased, so that the barren hath borne
seven, but she that hath many children lacketh (1 Sam. 2:5). "The
barren" is the church of the Gentiles, who had not the Word; "she that
hath many children" is the church of the Jews, who had the Word. She who
had borne seven languisheth, she shall breathe out her soul (Jer. 15:9).
In like manner: They that dwell in the cities of Israel shall set on
fire and burn up the arms, and they shall kindle them with fire seven
years: they shall bury Gog, and seven months shall they be cleansing the
land (Ezek. 39:9, 11-12). The unclean spirit will take with him seven
other spirits worse than himself (Matt. 12:45). Profanation is here
described, and by "the seven spirits" with which he would return, are
signified all the falsities of evil; thus the plenary extinction of good
and truth. By "the seven heads of the dragon," and "the seven diadems
upon his heads" (Rev. 12:3), is signified the profanation of all good
and truth. From these things it is evident, that "seven" involves what
is holy or profane, and signifies all and full.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11.">11.</span></span>

Which are in Asia, signifies to those who are in the light of truth from
the Word. Since, by all the names of persons and places in the Word, the
things of heaven and the church are meant, as was said before; thus also
they are meant by "Asia" and by the names of the seven churches therein,
as will appear from what follows. The reason why they who are in the
light of truth from the Word, are meant by "Asia," is, because the Most
Ancient Church, and, after it, the Ancient, and then the Israelitish
church, were in Asia; also, because the ancient Word, and, afterwards
the Israelitish, were with them; and all the light of truth is from the
Word. That there were ancient churches in the Asiatic world and that
they had a Word which was afterwards lost, and, lastly, the Word which
is extant at this day, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 101-103). On this account it is,
that by "Asia" are here signified all who are in the light of truth from
the Word. \[2\] "Concerning this Ancient Word, which was in Asia before
the Israelitish Word, it is fitting to relate this news: That it is
still reserved there among the people who are in Great Tartary; I have
spoken with spirits and angels in the spiritual world who came thence,
who said that they possess a Word, and have possessed it from ancient
times; and that their Divine worship is performed according to this
Word; and that it consists of mere correspondences. They said that it
also contains the book of Jasher, which is mentioned in Joshua (10:12,
13), and 2 Sam. (1:17, 18), and also, that with them are the books
mentioned by Moses, as The Wars of Jehovah and the Propheticals (Num.
21:14, 15, and 27-30); and when I read to them the words quoted thence
by Moses, they examined whether they were extant there, and found them.
From these things it was manifest to me that the Ancient Word is still
with them. While speaking with them they said that they worship Jehovah,
some as an invisible, and some as a visible God. Moreover they related
that they do not suffer foreigners to come among them, except the
Chinese, with whom they cultivate peace, because the emperor of China is
from their country. And further, that they are so populous, that they do
not believe any region in the whole world to be more populous; which is
very credible from the wall so many miles long, which the Chinese
formerly constructed as a safeguard against invasion from them. Seek for
it in China, and peradventure you will find it there among the Tartars.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12.">12.</span></span>

Grace be unto you and peace, signifies Divine salutation. What is
understood specifically by "grace and peace," will be explained in what
follows; that "peace be unto you" was the Lord's salutation to His
disciples, thus the Divine salutation, may be seen in Luke (24:36, 37);
John (20:19-21); and by command of the Lord, it was the salutation of
the disciples to all to whom they should enter in (Matt. 10:11-15).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13.">13.</span></span>

From Him who is, who was, and is to come, signifies, from the Lord who
is eternal and infinite, and Jehovah. That it is the Lord, appears
clearly from what follows in this chapter, where it is said that he
heard a voice from the Son of man, saying: I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the First and the Last (Rev. 1:11-13); and afterwards: I am the First
and the Last (Rev. 1:17); and in the following chapter (Rev. 1:8); and
afterwards (Rev. 21:6; 22:12); and in Isaiah: Thus saith Jehovah, the
King of Israel, and His Redeemer Jehovah of Hosts: I am the First, and I
am the Last, and besides Me there Is no God (Isa. 44:6); also (48:12);
and He who is the First and the Last, is He who is, and who was, and who
is to come. \[2\] This also is meant by Jehovah; for the name Jehovah
signifies is; and He who is, or who is Esse itself, the same is also He
who was, and is to come, for in Him the past and the future are present;
hence He is without time eternal, and without place infinite. This also
is acknowledged by the church in the Doctrine of the Trinity, called
Athanasian, in which are these words: "The Father is eternal and
infinite, the Son is eternal and infinite, and the Holy Spirit is
eternal and infinite, but yet there are not three eternals and
infinites, but one;" that this one is the Lord, is demonstrated in The
Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14.">14.</span></span>

And from the seven spirits who are before His throne, signifies, from
the whole heaven where the Lord is in His Divine truth, and where His
Divine truth is received. By "seven spirits" are meant all who are in
the Divine truth, and in the abstract sense, the Divine true or Divine
truth itself. That "seven" in the Word means all and all things, may be
seen above (n. 10); and that by "throne" is meant the whole heaven, will
be seen presently. Hence by "before His throne," is meant where His
Divine truth is; for heaven is not heaven from anything proper to the
angels, but from the Divine of the Lord, as is shown in many places in
The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence and the Divine Love
and Wisdom. That "the Lord's throne" signifies heaven, is evident from
the following passages: Jehovah saith, The heavens are My throne (Isa.
66:1). Jehovah hath made firm His throne in the heavens (Ps. 103:19). He
that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by Him who
sitteth thereon (Matt. 23:22). Above the expanse that was over the head
of the cherubim, was as it were, the appearance of a sapphire stone, the
likeness of a throne, and upon it the appearance of a Man (Ezek. 1:26;
10:1). By "the expanse over the head of the cherubim" is meant heaven.
And in Revelation: He that overcometh, I will give him to sit on My
throne (Rev. 3:21). "On my throne," is in heaven; specifically, where
His Divine truth reigns; thus also, where judgment is treated of, it is
said that the Lord will sit upon a throne, for judgment is performed by
truths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="15.">15.</span></span>

Verse 5. And from Jesus Christ, signifies the Divine Human. That by
"Jesus Christ" and by "the Lamb" in the Word, is meant the Lord as to
the Divine Human, may be seen above (n. 6).

<span class="margnote"><span id="16.">16.</span></span>

Who is the faithful witness, signifies that He is the Divine Truth
itself. That "witness" is predicated of truth, and that the truth
testifies of itself, thus the Lord, who is the Divine Truth itself, and
the Word, may be seen above (n. 6).

<span class="margnote"><span id="17.">17.</span></span>

The first-born from the dead, signifies that He is the Divine Good
itself. What "the first-born from the dead" means, no one as yet knows;
and the ancients disputed what it signifies. They knew that by "the
first-born" is signified what is first and primary, from which is the
all of the church; and it was believed by many, that it was truth in
doctrine and in faith; but by few, that it was truth in act and work,
which is the good of life. That this is the first and primary of the
church, and thence in the proper sense is meant by "the first-born,"
will be seen presently. But first something shall be said concerning the
opinion of those who believed, that truth in doctrine and in faith is
the first and primary of the church, thus the first-born. They believed
this, because it is learned first, and because a church is a church by
means of truth, though not before it is of the life. Previously it is
only in the thought of the understanding, and in the memory, and not in
the act of the will; and truth, which is not truth in act or work, does
not live. It is only like a luxuriant tree having branches and leaves
without fruit. And it is like knowledge without application to use; and
like the foundation upon which a house is built in which one is to
dwell. These things are first in time, but they are not first in end;
and what are first in end are primary; for habitation in the house is
the first in end, but the foundation is the first in time; use also is
first in end, and knowledge is first in time; in like manner the first
in end, when a tree is planted, is the fruit, but the first in time are
the branches and leaves. \[2\] With the understanding it is similar,
which is formed in man first, but to the end that what a man sees with
his understanding, he may do; otherwise the understanding is like a
preacher, who teaches well, but lives wickedly. Moreover all truth is
sown in the internal man, and rooted in the external; wherefore, unless
the truth that is inseminated takes root in the external man, which is
effected by doing, it becomes like a tree planted, not in the soil, but
upon it, which immediately withers on exposure to the heat of the sun.
The man who has done the truth, takes this root with him after death;
but not the man who had only known and acknowledged it in faith. Now
because many of the ancients made that which is first in time, the first
also in end, that is, primary; therefore they said, that the first-born
signified truth in doctrine and faith in the church; not knowing that
this is the first-born apparently, but not actually. \[3\] But all those
who have made truth in doctrine and in faith the primary, are condemned,
because there is nothing of deed or work, or nothing of life in that
truth. Therefore Cain, who was the first-born of Adam and Eve, was
condemned. That by him is signified truth in doctrine and in faith, may
be seen in the Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence (n. 242).
Therefore, also Reuben, who was the first-born of Jacob, was condemned
by his father (Genesis 49:3-4), and his birthright was taken from him (1
Chron. 5:1). That by "Reuben" in the spiritual sense, is meant truth in
doctrine and in faith, will be seen presently. By "the first-born of
Egypt," who were all smitten, because condemned, nothing else is meant
in the spiritual sense, than truth in doctrine and in faith separate
from the good of life, which truth is in itself dead. By the "goats" in
Daniel and in Matthew, no others are meant than those who are in faith
separate from life, concerning whom see The Doctrine of the New
Jerusalem concerning Faith (n. 61-68). That those who were in faith
separate from life, were rejected and condemned about the time of the
Last Judgment, may be seen in The Continuation concerning the Last
Judgment (n. 16, seq.). \[4\] From these few things it may appear that
truth in doctrine and in faith is not the first-born of the church; but
truth in act or work, which is the good of life; for the church is not
with man until the truth becomes of the life, and when the truth becomes
of the life, then it is good; for the thought of the understanding, and
the memory, do not flow into the will, and through the will into act;
but the will flows into the thought of the understanding, and into the
memory, and acts. And what proceeds from the will, through the
understanding, proceeds from affection, which is of love, through the
thought, which is of the understanding, and all this is called good, and
it enters into the life; wherefore the Lord saith, that: He who doeth
the truth, doeth it in God (John 3:21). \[5\] Because John represents
the good of life, and Peter the truth of faith, as may be seen above (n.
5), therefore: John leaned on the Lord's breast, and followed Jesus, but
not Peter (John 21:18-21). The Lord also said of John, that "he should
tarry till He came" (verse 22-23); thus to this day, which is the Lord's
coming; the good of life is therefore now taught by the Word for those
who will be of His New Church, which is the New Jerusalem. In a summary,
that is the first-born which the truth first produces from good, thus
what the understanding produces from the will; because truth is of the
understanding, and good is of the will: this first is primary, because
it is as the seed from which the rest proceed. A \[6\] As to the Lord He
is the First-born from the dead, because He, as to His Human, is the
truth itself united to the Divine good, from whom all men live, who in
themselves are dead. The same is meant in David: I will make Him the
first-born higher than the kings of the earth (Ps. 89:27). This is
concerning the Lord's Human. Thence it is that Israel is called the
first-born (Exod. 4:22, 23). By "Israel" is meant the truth in act, and
by "Jacob" the truth in doctrine; and because there is no church from
the latter alone, therefore Jacob was named Israel; but in the supreme
sense by "Israel" is meant the Lord. On account of this representation
of the "first-born," all the first-born and all the first fruits were
sanctified to Jehovah (Exod. 13:2, 12; 22:28, 29). \[7\] On account of
this representation of the "first-born," the Levites were taken instead
of all the first-born in the Israelitish church; and it is said that
thereby they belonged to Jehovah (Num. 3:12, 13, 40-46; 18:15-18): for
by "Levi" is signified truth in act, which is the good of life; and
therefore the priesthood was given to his posterity, which will be
treated of below. For the same reason a double portion of the
inheritance was given to the first-born, and he was called "the
beginning of strength" (Deut. 21:15-17). \[8\] The "first-born"
signifies the primary of the church, because in the Word by natural
births, spiritual births are signified, and then what first produces
them in man, is meant by his "first-born;" for there is no church with
him, until the truth of doctrine conceived in the internal man is born
in the external.

<span class="margnote"><span id="18.">18.</span></span>

And the prince of the kings of the earth, signifies from whom is all
truth from good in the church. This follows from what has gone before,
because by faithful witness, the Lord as to the Divine truth is
signified; and by first-born the Lord as to the Divine good; therefore
by "the prince of the earth," is signified, that all truth from good in
the church is from Him. The reason why this is signified by "the prince
of the kings of the earth," is, that by "kings" in the spiritual sense
of the Word, are meant those that are in truths from good, and
abstractly, truths from good; and by "earth" is meant the church. That
this is the signification of "kings" and "earth," may be seen below (n.
20, 285).

<span class="margnote"><span id="19.">19.</span></span>

To Him that loveth us and washeth us from our sins, signifies, who out
of love and mercy reforms and regenerates men by His Divine truths from
the Word. That "to wash us from our sins" is to purify us from evils,
thus to reform and regenerate, is evident; for regeneration is spiritual
washing. But that by "His blood," is not meant the passion of the cross,
as many believe, but the Divine truth proceeding from Him, may appear
from many passages in the Word, which it would be too prolix to adduce
here, but they will be adduced below (n. 379, 653). In the meantime, see
what is said and shown concerning the signification of the Lord's flesh
and blood in the Holy Supper, as set forth in The New Jerusalem and Its
Heavenly Doctrine, published at London in the year 1758 (n. 210-222);
and concerning spiritual washing, which is regeneration, in the same (n.
202-209).

<span class="margnote"><span id="20.">20.</span></span>

Verse 6. And maketh us kings and priests, signifies who gives to those
who are born of Him, that is, who are regenerated, to be in wisdom from
Divine truths, and in love from Divine goods. It is known that in the
Word the Lord is called "king," and also "priest"; He is called "king"
from Divine wisdom, and "priest" from Divine love; therefore, they who
are in wisdom from the Lord are called "sons of the king," and also
"kings;" and they who are in love from Him, are called "ministers" and
"priests;" for the wisdom and love with them is not from themselves,
thus not their own, but the Lord's. Hence it is that these are meant in
the Word by "kings" and "priests;" not that they are such, but that the
Lord is such in them, and causes them to be so called. They are also
called "born of Him," "sons of the kingdom," "sons of the Father," and
"heirs;" "born of him" (John 1:12, 13), that is, born again, or
regenerated (John 3:3 seq.); "sons of the kingdom" (Matt. 8:12; 8:38);
"sons of the Father in heaven" (Matt. 5:45); "heirs" (Ps. 127:3; 1 Sam.
2:8; Matt. 25:34); and because they are called heirs, sons of the
kingdom, and born of the Lord as their Father, they are called "kings
and priests;" then also it is said that: They all sit with the Lord upon
His throne (Rev. 3:21). \[2\] There are two kingdoms into which the
entire heaven is distinguished, the spiritual kingdom and the celestial
kingdom; the spiritual kingdom is what is called the Lord's royalty, and
as all who are therein are in wisdom from truths, therefore they are
meant by "the kings," which the Lord will make those men who are in
wisdom from Him; and the celestial kingdom is what is called the Lord's
priesthood, and because all who are there, are in love from goods,
therefore they are meant by "priests," which the Lord will make those
men who are in love from Him: in like manner, the Lord's church upon
earth is distinguished into two kingdoms; concerning those two kingdoms,
see the work on Heaven and Hell, published in London in the year 1758
(n. 24, 226). \[3\] He who does not know the spiritual signification of
"kings and priests," may be hallucinated <span
id="fr_4"></span>[20-1](#fn_4.md) by many things which are related
concerning them in the prophets and in Revelation; as in these in the
prophets: The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their
kings shall minister unto thee; thou shalt suck the milk of the
Gentiles, yea thou shalt suck the breasts of kings; that thou mayest
know that I Jehovah am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer (Isa. 60:10, 16).
Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their princesses thy nursing
mothers (Isa. 49:23). And in other places, as in (Gen. 49:20; Ps. 2:10;
Isa. 14:9; 24:21; 52:15; Jer. 2:26; 4:9; 69:3; Lam. 2:6, 9; Ezek. 7:26,
27; Hos. 3:4; Zeph. 1:8). By "kings" in these passages, kings are not
meant, but those who are in Divine truths from the Lord, and abstractly
Divine truths, from which is wisdom. Neither are kings meant by "the
king of the south" and "the king of the north" who waged war with each
other (Dan. 11:1 seq.); but by "the king of the south" are meant those
who are in truths, and by "the king of the north" those who are in
falsities. \[4\] In like manner in Revelation, where kings are
frequently mentioned; as in these passages: The sixth angel poured out
his vial upon the great river Euphrates, and the water thereof was dried
up, that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be
prepared (Rev. 16:12). The kings of the earth have committed whoredom
with the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters (Rev. 17:2). All
nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of the whoredom of Babylon,
and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her (Rev. 18:3).
And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies
gathered together to make war with Him that sitteth on the white horse
(Rev. 19:19). And the nations which are saved shall walk in His light,
and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into the
New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:24); and in other places (as in Rev. 16:14; 17:2,
9-14; 18:9-10). By kings are here meant those who are in truths, and, in
the opposite sense those who are in falsities; and abstractly, truths or
falsities. By "the whoredom of Babylon with the kings of the earth" is
meant the falsification of the truth of the church; that Babylon, or the
woman who sat upon the scarlet beast, did not commit whoredom with the
kings, but that she falsified the truths of the Word, is evident. \[5\]
From this it is evident that by "kings," that the Lord will make those
who are in wisdom from Him, is not meant that they will be kings, but
that they will be wise. That this is so, enlightened reason also sees.
So in the following: Thou hast made us unto our God kings and priests,
that we may reign upon the earth (Rev. 5:10). That the Lord, by "a
king," meant truth, is evident from his own words to Pilate: Pilate said
unto Him, Art thou not a king then? Jesus answered, Thou hast said that
I am a king. For this was I born, and for this I came into the world,
that I should give testimony to the truth; everyone that is of the truth
heareth My voice. Pilate saith unto Him, What is truth? (John 18:37-38).
"To bear witness unto the truth," means that He Himself is the truth;
and because from it He called Himself "a king," Pilate said, "What is
truth," that is, is truth a king? That "priests" signify those who are
in the good of love, and abstractly the goods of love, will appear in
what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="21.">21.</span></span>

Unto God and his Father signifies thus images of His Divine wisdom, and
of His Divine love. By "God and Father," in the spiritual sense, two
persons are not meant; but by "God" is meant the Divine as to wisdom,
and by "Father" the Divine as to love; for there are two things in the
Lord, the Divine wisdom and the Divine love, or the Divine truth and the
Divine good; these two are meant in the Old Testament by "God" and
"Jehovah," and here, by "God" and "Father." Now because the Lord
teaches, that He and the Father are one, and that He is in the Father
and the Father in Him (John 10:30; 14:10, 11), by God and the Father are
not meant two persons, but the Lord alone. The Divine also is one and
indivisible, therefore by "Jesus Christ made us kings and priests unto
God and His Father" is signified, that they appear before Him as images
of His Divine wisdom and of His Divine love; for in these two consists
the image of God in men and angels. That the Divine, which in itself is
one, is designated by various names in the Word, may be seen in Doctrine
of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord. That the Lord Himself is also
the Father, is evident from the following places. In Isaiah: For unto us
a Boy is born, unto us a Son is given, and His name shall be called
Wonderful, God, Hero, the Father of eternity, the Prince of Peace (Isa.
9:6). Thou, Jehovah, art our Father, our Redeemer, Thy name is from an
age (Isa. 63:16); and in John: If ye had known Me, ye should have known
My Father also, and from henceforth ye know Him, and have seen Him.
Philip saith unto Him, Lord, show us the Father. Jesus saith unto him,
he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father, therefore how sayest thou,
Show us the Father? Believe Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father
in Me (John 14:7-9, 11). See n. 962, below.

<span class="margnote"><span id="22.">22.</span></span>

To Him be glory and might unto the ages of ages, signifies, to whom
alone belong Divine majesty and Divine omnipotence to eternity. By
"glory" in the Word, where the Lord is treated of, is meant the Divine
majesty; this being predicated of His Divine wisdom; and by "might," is
meant the Divine omnipotence, this being predicated of His Divine love;
and by "ages of ages," is meant eternity. That such is the meaning of
"glory," "might," and "ages of ages," when spoken of Jehovah or the
Lord, may be confirmed from many passages in the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="23.">23.</span></span>

Amen, signifies Divine confirmation from the truth, thus from Himself.
"Amen" signifies truth; and because the Lord was truth itself, He so
often said, "Amen, I say unto you," (as in Matt. 5:18, 26; 6:16; 10:23,
42; 17:20; 18:13, 18; 25:12; 28:20; John 3:11; 5:19, 24, 25; 6:26, 32,
47, 53; 8:34, 51, 58; 10:7; 13:16, 20, 21; 21:18, 25); and in the
following passage in Revelation: These things saith the Amen, the
faithful and true witness (Rev. 3:14); that is, the Lord. That the Lord
is the truth itself, He Himself teaches in John 14:6; 17:19.

<span class="margnote"><span id="24.">24.</span></span>

Verse 7. Behold He cometh with the clouds of heaven, signifies that the
Lord will reveal Himself in the literal sense of the Word, and will open
its spiritual sense in the end of the church. He who does not know
anything of the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, cannot know
what was meant by the Lord that "He will come in the clouds of heaven";
for He said to the high priest, who adjured Him to say whether He was
the Christ the Son of God: Thou hast said I am; and ye shall see the Son
of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of
heaven (Matt. 26:63-64; Mark 14:61-62). And where the Lord speaks to His
disciples of the consummation of the age, He says: And then shall appear
the sign of the Son of man; and they shall see the Son of man coming in
the clouds of heaven with power and glory (Matt. 24:30; Mark 13:26). By
"the clouds of heaven" in which He is to come, nothing else is meant but
the Word in its literal sense; and by "the glory" in which they will see
Him, the Word in its spiritual sense. That this is the case, is
difficult to be believed by those who do not think beyond the sense of
the letter of the Word; with such, "a cloud" is a cloud, and thence is
their belief that the Lord will appear in the clouds of heaven, when the
Last Judgment is at hand. But this idea falls, when it is known what "a
cloud" is, and that it is the Divine truth in ultimates, thus the Word
in the sense of the letter. \[2\] In the spiritual world there appear
clouds as well as in the natural world; but the clouds in the spiritual
world appear beneath the heavens, with those who are in the sense of the
letter of the Word, darker or brighter according to their understanding
and reception of the Word; the reason is, that the light of heaven there
is the Divine truth, and darkness there is falsities; consequently
"bright clouds" are the Divine truth veiled in appearances of truth,
such as the Word is in the letter with those who are in truths; and
"dark clouds" are the Divine truths covered with fallacies and confirmed
appearances, such as the Word is in the letter with those who are in
falsities. I have often seen those clouds, and it was evident whence and
what they are. Now because the Lord, after the glorification of His
Human, was made the Divine truth, or the Word, even in ultimates, He
said unto the high priest, that, "Hereafter they should see the Son of
man coming in the clouds of heaven." \[3\] But His saying to His
disciples, that "in the consummation of the age the sign of the Son of
man should appear, and that they should see Him coming in the clouds of
heaven with power and glory," signifies that at the end of the church,
when the Last Judgment shall take place, He will appear in the Word, and
reveal the spiritual sense, which is also accomplished at this day,
because now is the end of the church, and the Last Judgment has taken
place, as may appear from the small works recently published. This,
therefore, is what is meant in Revelation, by "behold He cometh with
clouds": also in the following passages: I saw, and behold, a white
cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man (Rev. 14:14).
As also in Daniel: I saw in the night visions, and behold the Son of man
coming with clouds (Dan. 7:13). That by "the Son of man" is meant the
Lord as to the Word, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Lord (n. 19-28). \[4\] That also by "clouds" in other
parts of the Word, is meant the Divine truth in ultimates, and thence
the Word in the letter, may be seen in other passages where clouds are
mentioned; as in these: There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who
rideth upon the heaven, and in magnificence upon the clouds (Deut.
33:26). Sing unto God, praise His name, extol Him that rideth upon the
clouds (Ps. 68:4). Jehovah rideth upon a light cloud (Isa. 19:1). "To
ride upon the clouds," signifies to be in the wisdom of the Word, for "a
horse" signifies the understanding of the Word; who cannot see that
Jehovah does not ride upon the clouds? God rode upon a cherub, and
placed the clouds of the heavens His tent (Ps. 18:10-11). Here there is
a similar signification; "cherubs" also signify the Word, as may be seen
below (n. 239, 672); tent signifies a habitation. \[5\] Jehovah layeth
the beams of His chambers in the waters, He maketh the cloud His chariot
(Ps. 104:3). "Waters" signify truths, "chambers" signify doctrinals, and
"chariot" doctrine, all which, because they are from the sense of the
letter of the Word, are called "clouds." He bindeth up the waters in His
clouds, and the cloud is not broken under them; He spreadeth His cloud
over His throne (Job 26:8-9). In like manner: God caused the light of
His cloud to shine (Job 37:15). Give ye strength unto God, strength upon
the clouds (Ps. 68:34). "The light of a cloud" signifies the Divine
truth of the Word, and "strength" signifies Divine power there. \[6\]
Thou, O Lucifer, hast said in thine heart, I will ascend above the
heights of the cloud; I will become like the Most High (Isa. 14:14).
Forsake ye, Babylon, for she hath lifted herself up even to the clouds
(Jer. 51:9). By "Lucifer," and "Babylon" are signified those who profane
the goods and truths of the Word, therefore these truths are meant there
by "clouds." Jehovah spread a cloud for a covering (Ps. 105:39). Jehovah
createth upon every habitation of Zion a cloud by day, for upon all the
glory shall be a covering (Isa. 4:5). Here, also, by "cloud," is meant
the Word in the sense of the letter, which sense, as it includes and
covers the spiritual sense, is called "a covering upon the glory." That
the literal sense of the Word is a covering, lest its spiritual sense
should be injured, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 33); and that it is a guard (n. 97).
\[7\] The Divine truth in ultimates, which is the same with the Word in
the sense of the letter, is also represented by the "cloud," in which
Jehovah descended upon Mount Sinai, and promulgated the law (Exod. 19:9;
34:5). Also by the "cloud" which covered Peter, James, and John, when
Jesus was transfigured, concerning which it is written: While Peter yet
spake, behold a cloud overshadowed them, and behold a voice out of the
cloud saying, This is my beloved Son, hear ye Him (Matt. 17:5; Mark 9:7;
Luke 9:34-35). The Lord in this transfiguration, caused Himself to be
seen as the Word; therefore a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice was
heard out of the cloud, that He is the Son of God; "the voice out of the
cloud" is out of the Word. That by "cloud," in the opposite sense, is
meant the Word as to the sense of the letter falsified, will be seen
elsewhere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="25.">25.</span></span>

And every eye shall see Him, signifies that all who are in the
understanding of Divine truth from affection will acknowledge Him. In
the spiritual sense, by "eye" is not meant the eye, but the
understanding; therefore, "every eye shall see Him," signifies that all
who are in the understanding of Divine truth from affection will
acknowledge Him, because they alone understand and acknowledge. The rest
see indeed and also understand, but do not acknowledge; the former,
then, are signified, because it follows, that "they also who pierced
Him" will see Him, by whom are meant those who are in falsities. That
"the eye" signifies the understanding, will be seen below (n. 48).

<span class="margnote"><span id="26.">26.</span></span>

And they also who pierced Him, signifies that they also will see who are
in falsities in the church. By "piercing" Jesus Christ nothing else is
meant than to destroy His Divine truth in the Word. This, also, is meant
by: One of the soldiers pierced His side, and there went forth blood and
water (John 19:34.) "Blood and water" are the Divine truth, spiritual
and natural, thus the Word in its spiritual and in its natural sense;
and "to pierce the Lord's side" is to destroy both by falsities, as was
also done by the Jews; for all things of the Lord's passion represented
the state of the Jewish church as to the Word, on which subject, see The
Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Lord (n. 15-17). The reason
why "piercing" Him, signifies to destroy the Word by falsities, is,
because this is said of Jesus Christ, who presently is called the Son of
man, and by the Son of man is meant the Lord as to the Word, therefore
"to pierce the Son of man," is to do the same to the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="27.">27.</span></span>

And all the tribes of the earth shall wail, signifies that this will be
when there are no longer any goods and truths in the church. That "the
tribes of the earth" signify the goods and truths of the church, will be
seen in the explanation of the seventh chapter, where the twelve tribes
of Israel are treated of; "wailing" signifies lamentation that they are
dead. The same is meant here as by the Lord's words in Matthew: After
the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon
shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven; and then
shall appear the sign of the Son of man, and then shall all the tribes
of the earth wail (Matt. 24:29-30). These things are said of the
consummation of the age, which is the end of the church; "the sun shall
be darkened," signifies that there is no longer any love and charity;
"the moon shall not give her light," signifies that there is no longer
any intelligence and faith; "the stars shall fall from heaven,"
signifies that there are no longer any knowledges of good and truth;
"all the tribes of the earth shall wail," signifies that there are no
longer any goods and truths; "affliction" signifies that state of the
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="28.">28.</span></span>

Even so, Amen, signifies the Divine confirmation that so it will be.
This is evident from what was explained above (n. 23).

<span class="margnote"><span id="29.">29.</span></span>

Verse 8. And I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End,
signifies Who is the Self-existing and the Only from firsts to
ultimates, from Whom all things are; thus Who is Love Itself and the
Only Love, Wisdom Itself and the Only Wisdom, Life Itself and the Only
Life in Himself, and thus the Creator Himself and the Only Creator,
Saviour and Enlightener from Himself, and thence the All in all of
heaven and the church. These and many more things besides are contained
in the above words, by which the Lord is described. That they are spoken
of the Lord, and, indeed, of His Human, is very evident, for it follows
that John heard a voice, saying: I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First
and the Last; and He turned to see the voice that spake with him, and
saw the Son of man in the midst of seven lampstands (Rev. 1:10-13). Who,
also, a little further on, says: I am the First and the Last, I am He
that liveth and was dead (Rev. 2:8). But that all the particulars above
enumerated are contained in these words cannot be confirmed briefly, for
to confirm them fully would require many sheets; still they are in part
confirmed in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom,
recently published in Amsterdam, which see. The Lord calls Himself " the
Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," because "Alpha and
Omega" refer to His Divine love, and "Beginning and End," to His Divine
wisdom; for there is, in every particular of the Word, a marriage of
love and wisdom, or of good and truth; on which subject, see The
Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred Scripture (n.
80-90). \[2\] The Lord is called "the Alpha and the Omega," because
Alpha is the first letter and Omega the last in the Greek Alphabet, and
therefore they signify all in the aggregate. The reason is, that every
letter of the alphabet, in the spiritual world, signifies something; and
a vowel, because it is serviceable for sound, something of affection or
love. From this origin, spiritual and angelic speech, and, also, the
Scriptures, are derived; but this is an arcanum hitherto unknown. For
there is a universal language in which all angels and spirits are; and
this has nothing in common with any language of men in the world. Every
man comes into this language after death; for it is implanted in every
man from creation, therefore they all can understand each other in the
whole spiritual world. It has been granted me frequently to hear that
language, and also to speak it; and I have compared it with the
languages in the world, and have found that it does not, even in the
smallest particular, make one with any natural language on the earth. It
differs from these in its first principle, which is, that each letter of
every word has a sense and signification peculiar to itself, as well in
speaking as in writing. Therefore it is that the Lord is called the
Alpha and the Omega, which signifies that He is the All in all of heaven
and the church; and as these two letters are vowels, they have relation
to love, as was said above. Concerning this language, and the writing of
it, flowing from the spiritual thought of the angels, something may be
seen in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom (n.
295).

<span class="margnote"><span id="30.">30.</span></span>

Saith the Lord, Who is, and Who was, and Who is to come. That this
signifies who is eternal and infinite, and Jehovah, may be seen above
(n. 13), where this is explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="31.">31.</span></span>

The Almighty, signifies who is, lives, and has power from Himself, and
who rules all things from firsts by ultimates. Since all things are from
the Lord, and are created from the firsts which are from Him; and
nothing is given which does not exist therefrom, as is abundantly shown
in the Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom, it follows,
that He is omnipotent. Suppose One from whom are all things; are not all
things of that One, upon whom they depend in order, like the links of a
chain upon their hook; or like the blood vessels of the whole body upon
the heart; or as each and everything in the universe on the sun? Thus do
all things depend on the Lord, who is the sun of the spiritual world,
from whom is all the essence, life, and power, with those who are under
that sun. In a word, "from Him we live, and move, and have our being"
(Acts 17:28). This is the Divine omnipotence. That the Lord rules all
things from firsts by ultimates, is an arcanum never before revealed;
but it is now explained in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning
the Lord and Doctrine of the Sacred Scripture in many places; and also
in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Providence (n. 124); and
Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 221). It is known that the Divine because it
is infinite, does not fall into the ideas of the thought of any man nor
of any angel, because they are finite, and the finite does not have the
capacity of perceiving the infinite; still, that it may in some manner
be perceived, it has pleased the Lord to describe His infinity by these
words: I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End; Who is,
and Who was, and Who is to come, the Almighty. These words, therefore,
include all things which angel and man can ever think, spiritually and
naturally, concerning the Divine; which things, in general, are what
were adduced above universally.

<span class="margnote"><span id="32.">32.</span></span>

Verse 9. I, John, who also am your brother and companion, signifies
those who are in the good of charity, and thence in the truths of faith.
It was said above (n. 5), that the apostle John represented those who
are in the good of charity; and those who are in the good of charity are
also in the truths of faith, because charity is the soul and life of
faith; hence it is, that John calls himself the brother and companion of
those in the church to whom he writes, for he wrote to the seven
churches. By "brother," in the spiritual sense of the Word, is meant one
who is in the good of charity; and by "companion" one who is thence in
the truths of faith; for all are, as it were, in consanguinity by
charity, but in affinity by faith; for charity conjoins; not so faith,
except it be from charity. When faith is from charity, then charity
conjoins, and faith consociates; and since they make one, therefore the
Lord commanded that all should be "brethren," for he says: One is your
Teacher, Christ, but all ye are brethren (Matt. 23:8). \[2\] The Lord,
also, calls those "brethren" who are in the good of charity, or in the
good of life; for He said: My mother and my brethren are these, who hear
the Word of God, and do it (Luke 8:21; Matt. 12:49; Mark 3:33-35). By
"mother," is meant the church, and by "brethren," those who are in
charity; and because the good of charity is a "brother," therefore the
Lord calls those who are in it "brethren," also in Matt. 25:40, and so
also disciples (Matt. 28:10; John 20:17). But we do not read that the
disciples called the Lord brother, because "brother" is the good which
is from the Lord; this is comparatively as it is with a king, prince,
and magnate, who call their relatives and neighbors brethren, but yet
the latter do not in their turn call them so; for the Lord says: One is
your Teacher, Christ, but all ye are brethren (Matt. 23:8); also: Ye
call me Master and Lord; and ye say rightly, for so I am (John 13:13).
\[3\] The sons of Israel called all those brethren who were from their
father Jacob; and in a more extensive sense, those also who were from
Esau; but such as were not from them they called companions. But because
the Word, in its spiritual sense, treats only of those who are in the
Lord's church, therefore in that sense, by "brethren," are meant those
who are in the good of charity from the Lord, and by "companions," those
who are in the truths of faith; as in the following passages: Thus shall
ye say everyone to his companion, and everyone to his brother, What hath
Jehovah answered? (Jer. 23:35). Ye have not proclaimed liberty everyone
to his brother, and everyone to his companion (Jer. 34:17). Let no one
press his companion, nor his brother (Deut. 15:1, 2). For my brethren
and companions' sakes, I will now say (Ps. 122:8). Everyone helpeth his
companion, and saith to his brother, Strengthen thyself (Isa. 41:6). And
in the opposite sense: Take ye heed everyone of his companion, and trust
not in any brother; for every brother will supplant, and every companion
slandereth (Jer. 9:4). I will mingle Egypt with Egypt, that one may
fight against his brother, and against his companion (Isa. 19:2); and in
other places. These are adduced, that it may be known why John calls
himself "brother and companion;" and that by "brother" in the Word, is
meant one who is in charity or in good, and, by "companion" one who is
in faith or in truth. But because charity is from faith, therefore none
are called "companions" by the Lord, but "brethren" or "neighbor;"
everyone also is a neighbor according to the quality of good (Luke
10:36-37).

<span class="margnote"><span id="33.">33.</span></span>

In affliction and in the kingdom and patient expectation of Jesus
Christ, signifies which in the church are infested by evils and
falsities, but which will be removed by the Lord when He comes. By
"affliction" is meant the state of the church when there are no longer
any goods of charity and truths of faith, but in place of them evils and
falsities; by "the kingdom," is meant the church; and, by "patient
expectation of Jesus Christ," is meant the Lord's coming; therefore
these words, "In affliction and in the kingdom and patient expectation
of Jesus Christ," when collated into one sense, signify when the goods
and truths of the church are infested by evils and falsities, but which
will be removed by the Lord when he comes. That by "affliction" is meant
the state of the church when it is infested by evils and falsities, is
evident from the following: In the consummation of the age, they shall
deliver you up into affliction, and shall kill you. There shall be great
affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the world, nor shall
be. After the affliction of those days shall the sun be darkened, and
the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven
(Matt. 24:9, 21, 29; Mark 13:19, 24). That "the kingdom" signifies the
church, will be seen in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="34.">34.</span></span>

I was in the island called Patmos, signifies a state and place in which
he could be enlightened. The reason that the Revelation was made to John
in Patmos, was, because it was an island in Greece, not far from the
land of Canaan, and between Asia and Europe; and by "islands" are
signified the Gentiles more remote from the worship of God, but yet
which are about to draw near to it, because they can be enlightened. The
same is signified by Greece; but the church itself is signified by "the
land of Canaan"; by "Asia," those of the church who are in the light of
truth from the Word; and, by "Europe," those to whom the Word is about
to come; thence it is, that by "the island of Patmos," is signified a
state and place in which he could be enlightened. That by "islands" in
the Word are signified the nations which are more remote from the
worship of God, but which yet will draw near to it, is evident from
these passages: Honor Jehovah in the Urim, the name of the God of Israel
in the Islands of the sea (Isa. 24:15). He shall not extinguish nor
break until He set judgment in the earth, and let the islands hope in
His law. Sing unto Jehovah a new song, the islands and the inhabitants
thereof shall give glory unto Jehovah; and proclaim His praise in the
islands (Isa. 42:4, 10, 12). Attend O Islands unto Me; and ye peoples
from afar (Isa. 49:1). The islands shall hope in Me, and on Mine arm
shall they trust (Isa. 51:5). The islands shall trust in Me, and the
ships of Tarshish (Isa. 60:9). Hear the Words of Jehovah, O ye nations,
and proclaim it in the Islands from afar (Jer. 31:10). And that they
should adore Jehovah everyone in his place, all the Islands of the
nations (Zeph. 2:11); and elsewhere. That the same is signified by
"Greece," is not so evident from the Word, because Greece is mentioned
only in Daniel 8:21; 10:20; 11:2; as also in John 12:20; Mark 7:26. That
by "the land of Canaan" is meant the Lord's church, which is thence
called "the Holy Land," and "the heavenly Canaan," is evident from many
passages in the Word; that by "Asia" are meant those in the church who
are in the light of truth from the Word, may be seen above (n. 11); and
that by "Europe," those to whom the Word is about to come, is evident.

<span class="margnote"><span id="35.">35.</span></span>

For the Word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ, signifies
that the Divine truth from the Word may be received from the heart and
so in the light, and that the Lord's Human might be acknowledged to be
Divine; this was explained above (n. 6).

Verse 10. I became in the spirit on the Lord's day, signifies a
spiritual state then from Divine influx. "I became in the spirit,"
signifies the spiritual state in which he was when he was in visions,
which state is treated of in what follows. "On the Lord's day,"
signifies influx then from the Lord; for on that day the Lord is
present, because the day is holy. From which it is evident, that "I
became in the spirit on the Lord's day," signifies a spiritual state
then from Divine influx. Of the prophets we read that they were "in the
spirit" or "in vision," also that the Word came to them from Jehovah.
When they were in the spirit or in vision, they were not in the body,
but in their spirit, in which state they saw such things as are in
heaven; but when the Word came to them, then they were in the body, and
heard Jehovah speaking. These two states of the prophets are to be
carefully distinguished. In the state of vision the eyes of their spirit
were opened, and the eyes of their body shut; and then they heard what
the angels spoke; or what Jehovah spoke through the angels, and they
also saw the things which were represented to them in heaven; and then
they sometimes seemed to themselves to be carried from place to place,
the body remaining in its place. \[2\] In this state was John when he
wrote Revelation; and sometimes also Ezekiel, Zechariah, and Daniel; and
then it is said that they were " in vision," or "in the spirit"; for
Ezekiel says: The spirit took me up, and brought me back into Chaldea to
the captivity in a vision of God, in the Spirit of God; thus the vision
which I saw went up upon me (Ezek.11:1, 24). It is said also that the
spirit took him up, and he heard behind him an earthquake, and other
things (Ezek. 3:12, 24); also that: The spirit lifted him up between the
earth and heaven, and brought him in the visions of God to Jerusalem,
and he saw abominations (Ezek. 8:3 seq.). In like manner he was in a
vision of God, or in the spirit, when he saw the four animals which were
cherubs (Ezek. 1 and 10); as also when he saw the new earth and the new
temple, and the angel measuring them (Ezek. 40-48); and it is said that
he was in the visions of God (Ezek. 40:2); and that the spirit took him
up (Ezek. 43:5). \[3\] The same was the case with Zechariah, with whom
there was an angel at the time, when he saw the man riding among the
myrtle trees (Zech. 1:8 seq.); when he saw four horns, and afterwards a
man, in whose hand was a measuring line (Zech. 2:1, 5 seq.); when he saw
Joshua, the high priest (Zech. 3:1 seq.); when he saw the lampstand and
the two olive trees (Zech. 4:1 seq.); when he saw the flying roll and
the ephah (Zech. 5:1, 6); and when he saw the four chariots coming out
from between two mountains, and horses (Zech. 6:1 seq.). In a similar
state was Daniel; when he saw four beasts coming up out of the sea (Dan.
7:1 seq.). And when he saw the battle of the ram and the he-goat (Dan.
8:1 seq.). That he saw these things in visions, he himself said (Dan.
7:1-2, 7, 13; 8:2; 10:1, 7-8), and that the angel Gabriel was seen by
him in a vision (Dan. 9:21). \[4\] It was the same with John; as when he
saw the Son of man in the midst of the seven lampstands (Rev. 1); when
he saw a throne in heaven, and Him that sat thereon, and four animals
round about the throne (Rev. 4); when he saw the book sealed with seven
seals (Rev. 5); when he saw the four horses going forth out of the book
that was opened (Rev. 6); when he saw the four angels standing upon the
four corners of the earth (Rev. 7); when he saw the locusts going forth
out of the bottomless pit (Rev. 9); when he saw the angel in whose hand
was a little book, which he gave him to eat (Rev. 10); when he heard the
seven angels sound with their trumpets (Rev. 11); when he saw the
dragon, and the woman whom the dragon persecuted, and the combat of the
latter with Michael (Rev. 12); and afterwards, two beasts coming up, one
out of the sea, and the other out of the earth (Rev. 13); when he saw
the seven angels having the seven last plagues (Rev. 15-16); when he saw
the harlot sitting upon the scarlet beast (Rev. 17-18); and afterwards,
a white horse, and One sitting thereon (Rev. 19); and lastly, a new
heaven and a new earth, and then the New Jerusalem coming down out of
heaven (Rev. 21-22). That John saw these things "in the spirit," and "in
vision," he himself says (Rev. 1:10; 4:2; 9:17; 21:10); this also is
meant by "I saw" wherever it occurs. \[5\] From these things it is
evident that to be "in the spirit" is to be "in vision"; which is
effected by the opening of the sight of man's spirit; which, when it is
opened, the things which are in the spiritual world appear as clearly as
the things which are in the natural world appear before the sight of the
body. I can testify that it is so, from the experience of many years. In
this state the disciples were when they saw the Lord after His
resurrection, wherefore it is said that: "Their eyes were opened" (Luke
24:30, 31). Abraham was in a similar state when he saw the three angels,
and spoke with them. So were Hagar, Gideon, Joshua, and others, when
they saw the angels of Jehovah; and, in like manner, the boy of Elisha,
when he saw the mountain full of chariots and horses of fire round about
Elisha; for: Elisha prayed and said, Jehovah, I pray, open his eyes that
he may see; and Jehovah opened the eyes of the boy, and he saw (2 Kings
6:17). But as to the Word, it was not revealed in a state of the spirit
or in vision, but was dictated to the prophets by the Lord by the living
voice; therefore, it is nowhere said that they spoke it from the Holy
Spirit, but from Jehovah; see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Lord (n. 53).

<span class="margnote"><span id="37.">37.</span></span>

And I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, signifies manifest
perception of the Divine truth revealed from heaven. "A great voice,"
when heard from heaven, signifies the Divine truth, of which presently;
it was heard "as a trumpet," because when the Divine truth descends from
heaven, it is sometimes so heard by the angels of the lowest heaven, and
then is manifestly perceived. Therefore, by "a voice as of a trumpet,"
is signified manifest perception; of the signification of trumpet, more
will be seen below (n. 397, 519). That "a great voice" when heard from
heaven signifies Divine truth is evident from these passages: The voice
of Jehovah is upon the water, the voice of Jehovah is in power, the
voice of Jehovah is with honor, the voice of Jehovah breaketh the
cedars, the voice of Jehovah falleth as a flame of fire; the voice of
Jehovah maketh the wilderness to tremble; the voice of Jehovah maketh
the hinds to bring forth (Ps. 29:3-9). Sing psalms to the Lord ye
kingdoms of the earth, behold He will give forth His voice, a voice of
strength (Ps. 68:32-33). Jehovah gave forth His voice before His army,
for numberless, it doeth His Word (Joel 2:11). Jehovah will give forth
His voice from Jerusalem (Joel 3:16). And since "voice" signifies the
Divine truth from the Lord, therefore the Lord said that: The sheep hear
His voice; they know His voice; and other sheep I have, them also I must
bring, and they shall hear My voice; My sheep hear My voice, and I know
them, and they follow Me (John 10:3-4, 16, 27). And in another place:
The hour cometh, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of man,
and they that hear shall live (John 5:25). "Voice" here is the Divine
truth of the Lord from his Word.

Verse 11. Saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last,
signifies Who is the self-existing, and the Only from firsts to
ultimates, from whom are all things; thus Who is love itself and the
only love, wisdom itself and the only wisdom, and the life itself and
the only life in Himself; and thus the Creator Himself and the only
Creator, Saviour, and Enlightener from Himself; and thence the All in
all of heaven and the church: Who alone is infinite and eternal, and
Jehovah; and that He is the Lord. That all these things, and infinitely
more, are contained in these words, may be seen above (n. 13, 29). It
was there said, that all the syllables or letters of the alphabet, in
the spiritual world, signify things; and that their speech and writing
there are thence; and that therefore the Lord describes His Divinity and
infinity by Alpha and Omega; by which is signified that He is the All in
all of heaven and the church. Since every letter signifies a thing in
the spiritual world, and thence in the angelic language; therefore David
wrote the 119th Psalm, in order, according to the letters of the
alphabet, beginning with Aleph and ending with Thau, as may appear from
the initials of the verses there; the like appears in Psalm 111, but not
so evidently. Therefore, also, Abram was called Abraham, and Sarai was
called Sarah; which was done for the reason that in heaven by Abraham
and Sarah, they should not be understood, but the Divine, as is also the
case; for the letter "H" involves infinity, because it is only an
aspirate; more on this subject may be seen above (n. 29).

<span class="margnote"><span id="39.">39.</span></span>

And what thou seest, write in a book; that this signifies that it may be
revealed to posterity, is evident without explanation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="40.">40.</span></span>

And send to the churches which are in Asia, signifies for those in the
Christian world, who are in the light of truth from the Word. That they
are meant by the "churches in Asia," may be seen above (n. 10, 11).

<span class="margnote"><span id="41.">41.</span></span>

Unto Ephesus, and Smyrna, and Pergamos, and Thyatira, and Sardis, and
Philadelphia, and Laodicea, signifies in particular according to the
state of reception of each. That all the states of reception of the Lord
and of His church are signified by those seven names, in the spiritual
sense, will be seen below; for John, when he received this command, was
in a spiritual state, and in that state nothing is mentioned by name
which does not signify some thing or state; therefore these things which
were written by John, were not sent to any church in those places, but
were told to their angels, by whom are meant those who receive. That by
all the names of places and persons throughout the whole Word, are meant
spiritual things, is shown in many places in Arcana Coelestia, published
in London, as what is meant by "Abraham," "Isaac," and "Jacob;" also by
"Israel," and by the names of his twelve sons; as also, what is meant by
various places in the land of Canaan, and by places in the vicinity of
that land; as what by Egypt, Syria, Assyria, and other places. It is the
same with these seven names. But he who wishes to remain in the sense of
the letter, let him remain, since that sense conjoins; only let him
know, that by those names the angels perceive things and states of the
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="42.">42.</span></span>

Verse 12. And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me, signifies
inversion of the state of those who are in the good of life, as to the
perception of truth in the Word, when they turn themselves to the Lord.
John says that he heard a voice behind him (verse 10), and now, that he
turned to see the voice; and again, that being turned, he saw seven
lampstands; from which it is evident, that he heard a voice from behind,
and that he turned himself, to see from whence it proceeded; that there
is an arcanum in this, is evident. The arcanum is that before man turns
himself to the Lord, and acknowledges Him as the God of heaven and
earth, he cannot see the Divine truth in the Word. The reason is, that
God is one, both in Person and in essence, in whom there is the Trinity;
and that God is the Lord. Therefore, they who acknowledge a Trinity of
Persons, look primarily to the Father, and some to the Holy Spirit, and
rarely to the Lord, and if to the Lord, they think of His Human as of an
ordinary man. When a man does this, he can by no means be enlightened in
the Word, for the Lord is the Word, for it is from Him and concerning
Him. Therefore they who do not approach the Lord alone, see Him and His
Word behind them, and not before them; or backward, and not in front.
This is the arcanum which lies concealed in these words: "That John
heard a voice behind him, and that he turned to see the voice, and,
being turned, saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of them the
Son of man;" for the voice which he heard came from the Son of man, who
is the Lord. \[2\] That the Lord alone is the God of heaven and earth,
He now teaches in a manifest voice, for He says: I am the Alpha and the
Omega, the Beginning and the End, saith the Lord, Who is, and Who was,
and Who is to come (Rev. 1:8); and here: I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the First and the Last (Rev. 1:11); and afterwards: I am the First and
the Last (Rev. 1:17; 2:8). That by a "voice," when from the Lord is
meant the Divine Truth, may be seen above (n. 37). And that by "John"
are meant those of the church, who are in the good of life (n. 5, 6).
From these things it may now appear, that by these words: And I turned
to see the voice which spake with me, is signified an inversion of the
state of those who are in the good of life, as to the perception of
truth in the Word, when they turn themselves to the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="43.">43.</span></span>

And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, signifies the New
Church, which will be in enlightenment from the Lord out of the Word.
That the "seven lampstands" are the seven churches, is said in the last
verse of this chapter; and that by the seven churches are meant all who
are in the Christian world, and draw near to the church, may be seen
above (n. 10); and in particular according to the state of reception of
each (n. 41). The reason why the New Church is meant by "the seven
lampstands" is, because in it, and in the midst of it, the Lord is; for
it is said, that "in the midst of the seven lampstands he saw one like
unto the Son of man," and by "the Son of man" is meant the Lord as to
the Word. The lampstands were seen to be golden, because gold signifies
good, and every church is a church from good which is formed by truths;
that "gold" signifies good, will be seen in what follows. \[2\] Those
lampstands were not placed one close to another, or in contact, but at
certain distances, forming a kind of circle, as is evident from these
words in the subsequent chapter: These things saith He, who walketh in
the midst of the seven golden lampstands (Rev. 2:1). Nothing is said of
the lamps of those lampstands; but in what follows it is said, that: The
Holy Jerusalem (that is, the New Church), hath no need of the sun,
neither of the moon, for its lamp is the Lamb, and the nations which are
saved shall walk in the light of it (Rev. 21:23-24). And further: They
need no lamp, for the Lord God giveth them light (Rev. 22:5); for they
who will be of the Lord's New Church, are only lampstands which will
give light from the Lord. \[3\] By the "golden lampstand in the
tabernacle," nothing else was represented than the church as to
enlightenment from the Lord, concerning which lampstand see (Exod. 25:31
to the end; 37:17-24; Lev. 24:3, 4; Num. 8:2-4). That it represented the
Lord's church as to Divine spiritual love, which is love towards the
neighbor, may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, published at London (n. 9548,
9555, 9558, 9561, 9570, 9783); also, below (n. 493). By the "lampstand"
in Zech. 4 is also signified the New Church to be established by the
Lord, because it signifies the new house of God, or the new temple; as
is evident from what follows there; and by "the house of God," or "the
temple," the church is signified, and in the highest sense, the Lord's
Divine Human, as He Himself teaches (John 2:19-21 and elsewhere). But it
shall be told what is signified in its order, in Zech. (chap. 4), when
"the lampstand" was seen by him. \[4\] By those things contained from
verses 1 to 7, is signified the enlightenment of the New Church by the
Lord, from the good of love by truth, "the olive trees" there signify
the church as to the good of love; by the things there from verse 8 to
10, is signified that these things are from the Lord; by "Zerubbabel,"
who is to build the house, thus the church, the Lord is represented; by
the things from verse 11 to 14, is signified that in that church there
will also be truths from a celestial origin. This explanation of that
chapter was given me by the Lord through heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="44.">44.</span></span>

Verse 13. And in the midst of the seven lampstands One like unto the Son
of man, signifies the Lord as to the Word, from whom that church is. It
is known from the Word, that the Lord called Himself "the Son of God,"
and also "the Son of man;" that by "the Son of God" He meant Himself as
to the Divine Human, and by the "Son of man," Himself as to the Word, is
fully demonstrated in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the
Lord (n. 19-28); and as it is there fully confirmed from the Word, it is
unnecessary to add any further confirmation here. Now, because the Lord
represented Himself before John as the Word, therefore as seen by him,
He is called "the Son of man." He represented Himself as the Word,
because the New Church is treated of, which is a church from the Word,
and according to the understanding of it. That the church is from the
Word, and that such as its understanding of the Word is, such is the
church, may be seen in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the
Sacred Scripture (n. 76-79). As the church is a church from the Lord
through the Word, therefore the Son of man was seen in the midst of the
lampstands; "in the midst" signifies in the inmost, from which the
things which are round about, or which are without, derive their
essence, here, their light or intelligence. That the inmost is the all
in the things which are round about, or without, is shown in many places
in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom; it is like
light and flame in the midst, from which all the circumferences receive
light and heat. \[2\] "In the midst," has the same signification in the
following passages in the Word: Cry out and shout, O inhabitant of Zion;
for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee (Isa. 12:6).
God is my King working salvation in the midst of the earth (Ps. 74:12).
God doing mercy in the midst of the temple (Ps. 48:9). God standeth in
the assembly of God; he will judge in the midst of the gods (Ps. 82:1).
They are called "gods" who are in Divine truths from the Lord, and,
abstractly, the truths themselves: Behold, I send an angel before thee;
beware of his face, for My name is in the midst of him (Exod. 23:20-21).
"The name of Jehovah" is all the Divine; "in the midst," is in the
inmost, and thence in everything of it. "The midst" also signifies the
inmost, and thence the all, in many other passages in the Word, where
evils are also treated of, as in Isa. 24:13; Jer. 23:9; Ps. 5:9; Jer.
9:4, 5; Ps. 36:1; 55:4; 62:4. These passages are adduced in order to
show, that "in the midst of the lampstands" signifies in the inmost,
from which the church and everything of it is derived; for the church
and everything of it is from the Lord through the Word. That
"lampstands" signify the New Church, may be seen above (n. 43).

<span class="margnote"><span id="45.">45.</span></span>

Clothed with a garment down to the foot, signifies the proceeding
Divine, which is the Divine truth. The reason why "a garment down to the
foot" signifies the proceeding Divine, which is the Divine truth, is,
because garments in the Word, signify truths, thence "a garment down to
the foot" \[talaris\], which is an outer garment, when the Lord is
treated of, signifies the proceeding Divine truth. That garments in the
Word signify truths is because in heaven they are clothed according to
the truths proceeding from their good, concerning which see in the work
on Heaven and Hell, published in London in the year 1758 (n. 177-182).
In what follows it will also be seen, that nothing else is meant by
garments in the Word in its spiritual sense; therefore that nothing else
is meant by the Lord's garments, when He was transfigured, which
appeared white as the light (Matt. 17:1-4; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36).
Nor is anything else meant by the Lord's garments which the soldiers
divided (John 19:23, 24). That similar things are represented, and
thence signified, by the garments of Aaron, may be seen in The Arcana
Coelestia, published at London (n. 9814, 10,068); particularly what is
signified by "the ephod" (n. 9477, 9824, 10,005); what by "the robe" (n.
9825, 10,005); what by "the tunic" (n. 9826, 9942); and what by "the
miter" (n. 9827): for Aaron represented the priestly office of the Lord.
Concerning the signification of garments from the Word, see below (n.
166, 328).

<span class="margnote"><span id="46.">46.</span></span>

And girt about the paps with a golden girdle, signifies the proceeding,
and, at the same time, the conjoining Divine, which is the Divine good.
That "a golden girdle" has this signification, is, because by "the
Lord's breast," and especially by "the paps," His Divine love is
signified; thence, by "the golden girdle" which girded them, is
signified the proceeding and at the same time the conjoining Divine,
which is the Divine good of the Divine love: moreover "gold" signifies
good; see below (n. 913). "A zone" or "girdle," in the Word, also
signifies the common bond, whereby all things are held together in order
and connection; as in Isaiah: There shall go forth a rod out of the stem
of Jesse, justice shall be the girdle of His loins, and truth the girdle
of His thighs (Isa. 11:1, 5). "The rod going forth out of the stem of
Jesse" is the Lord. That the girdle of the ephod and the belt of Aaron's
coat, signified conjunction, may be seen in The Arcana Coelestia,
published at London (n. 9837, 9944). Since "a girdle" signifies the bond
conjoining the goods and truths of the church, therefore when the church
with the sons of Israel was destroyed, Jeremiah the prophet was
commanded: To buy himself a girdle, and put it upon his loins, and then
to hide it in a hole of a rock near the Euphrates; and at the end of
days, when he took it, behold it was rotten, and was profitable for
nothing (Jer. 13:1-12). By this was represented that at that time there
was no good in the church, and thence that truths were dissipated. The
like is signified by "girdle" in Isaiah: Instead of a girdle there shall
be a rent (Isa. 3:24); and elsewhere. That by the "paps" or "breasts"
the Divine love is signified, is evident from those passages in the Word
where they are named, as also from their correspondence with love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="47.">47.</span></span>

Verse 14. And his head, and hairs, were white as wool, like snow,
signifies the Divine love of the Divine wisdom in firsts and in
ultimates. By the head of man is signified the all of his life; and the
all of man's life has relation to love and wisdom, therefore by "the
head" is signified wisdom, and also love. But as there is no love
without its wisdom, nor wisdom without its love, therefore it is the
love of wisdom, which is meant by "the head;" and when the Lord is
spoken of, it is the Divine love of the Divine wisdom. But the
signification of "the head" will be shown from the Word, below (n. 538,
568). Since, therefore, by "the head" is meant love and at the same time
wisdom in their firsts, it follows that by "hair" is meant love and
wisdom in their ultimates; and because "hairs" are here spoken of the
Son of man, who is the Lord as to the Word, by His "hairs" are signified
the Divine good which is of love, and the Divine truth which is of
wisdom, in the ultimates of the Word; and the ultimates of the Word are
what are contained in the sense of its letter. \[2\] That the Word in
this sense is signified by "the hairs of the Son of man," or of the
Lord, seems a paradox, but yet it is true; this may appear from the
passages in the Word quoted in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem
concerning the Sacred Scripture (n. 35-49) where it is also shown, that
the Nazarites in the Israelitish church represented the Lord as to the
Word in ultimates, which is the sense of its letter. For "Nazarite," in
the Hebrew language is hair, or lock of hair; hence Samson, who was a
Nazarite from the womb, had power in his hairs. That in like manner the
Divine truth is in its power, in the sense of the letter of the Word,
may be seen in the above-mentioned Doctrine concerning the Sacred
Scripture (n. 37-49). Therefore, also, the high priest and his sons were
severely prohibited from shaving the head. For this reason, forty-two
boys were torn in pieces by two bears, because they called Elisha,
"bald." Elisha, like Elijah, represented the Lord as to the Word; "bald"
signifies the Word without its ultimate, which, as was observed, is the
sense of the letter, and "bears" signify that sense of the Word
separated from its internal sense. They who separate them, appear also
in the spiritual world, at a distance, like bears, whence it is evident
why it was so done with the boys. Therefore also to induce baldness was
the greatest disgrace, and a mark of extreme mourning. \[3\] For which
reason, when the Israelitish nation had perverted all the sense of the
letter of the Word, this lamentation was made over them: Her Nazarites
were whiter than snow, bright white above milk; their form was darkened
more than blackness, they are not known in the streets (Lam. 4:7-8).
Also: Every head was made bald, and every shoulder was plucked of its
hair (Ezek. 29:18). Shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all
heads (Ezek. 7:18). In like manner, Isa. 15:2; Jer. 48:37; Amos 8:10.
Because the sons of Israel dispersed by falsities all the sense of the
letter of the Word, therefore the Prophet Ezekiel was commanded to
represent it by this, that: He should shave the head with a razor, and
burn with fire a third part of the hairs, a third part he should smite
with a sword, and scatter a third part in the wind, and bind up some in
his skirts, and afterwards cast them also into the fire (Ezek. 5:1-4
seq.). \[4\] Therefore, also, it is said in Micah: Induce baldness and
poll thee for sons of thy delights, enlarge thy baldness as the eagle;
for they are removed from thee (Micah 1:16). The "sons of delights" are
the genuine truths of the church from the Word. And as Nebuchadnezzar,
king of Babylon, represented the Babylonian falsification of the Word,
and destruction of all truth therein, therefore it came to pass that:
His hairs were grown like eagles' feathers (Dan. 4:33). By reason that
"hairs" signified that holiness of the Word it is said of the Nazarite
that: They should not shave the hair of his head, because that is the
Naziriteship of God upon their head (Num. 6:1-21); and therefore it was
ordained that: The high priest and his sons should not shave their head,
lest they should die, and lest wrath should come upon the whole house of
Israel (Lev. 10:6). \[5\] Now as by "hairs" is signified the Divine
truth in ultimates, which, in the church, is the Word in the sense of
the letter, therefore, also the like is said of "the Ancient of Days" in
Daniel: I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
Days did sit, his garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head
like clean wool (Dan. 7:9). That "the Ancient of Days" is the Lord,
appears evidently in Micah: Thou Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be
little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall go forth unto
Me He who shall be ruler in Israel, and whose goings forth have been
from of old, from the days of eternity (Micah 5:2). And in Isaiah, where
He is called "the Father of Eternity" (Isa. 9:6). \[6\] From these
passages, and many others, which are not adduced by reason of their
abundance, it may appear, that by the "head" and "hairs" of the Son of
man, which were "bright white like wool, like snow" is meant the Divine
of love and wisdom, in firsts and in ultimates. And as by the Son of
man, the Lord is meant as to the Word, it follows, that this also is
meant in firsts and in ultimates. Otherwise to what purpose would the
Lord here in Revelation, and the Ancient of Days in Daniel, be described
as to the hair? That by "hair," the sense of the letter of the Word is
signified, appears evidently from those who are in the spiritual world;
they who have held the sense of the letter of the Word in contempt,
appear bald there; and on the contrary, they who have loved the sense of
the letter of the Word, appear there with becoming hair. It is said "as
wool," and "as snow," because "wool" signifies good in ultimates, and
"snow," truth in ultimates; as also in Isaiah (1:18); for "wool" is from
sheep, by which is signified the good of charity, and "snow" is from
water, by which are signified the truths of faith.

And His eyes were as a flame of fire signifies the Divine wisdom of the
Divine love. By "eyes," in the Word, is meant the understanding, and
thence, by the sight of the eyes, intelligence; therefore, when spoken
of the Lord, the Divine wisdom is meant; but by a "flame of fire" is
signified spiritual love, which is charity; wherefore, when spoken of
the Lord, the Divine love is meant; hence, then, by "His eyes were like
a flame of fire" is signified the Divine wisdom of the Divine love. That
the "eye" signifies the understanding is because they correspond; for as
the eye sees from natural light, so does the understanding from
spiritual light; wherefore "to see" is predicated of both. That by "eye"
in the Word, the understanding is signified, is evident from the
following passages: Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the
deaf that have ears (Isa. 43:8). In that day shall the deaf hear the
words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of thick
darkness (Isa. 29:18). Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and
the ears of the deaf (Isa. 35:5). I will give thee for a light of the
Gentiles, to open the eyes of the blind (Isa. 42:6-7). This is spoken of
the Lord, who, when He comes, will open the understanding of those who
are in ignorance of the truth. \[2\] That this is meant by "opening the
eyes" is further evident from these passages: Make the heart of this
people fat, and smear their eyes, lest they perchance see with their
eyes (Isa. 6:9-10; John 12:40). Jehovah hath poured out upon you the
spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets, and your
heads, the seers, hath He covered (Isa. 29:10; 30:10). Who shutteth his
eyes lest he should see evil (Isa. 33:15). Hear ye this, O foolish
people, which have eyes and see not (Ezek. 12:2). The punishment of the
shepherd that deserteth the flock; the sword shall be upon his right
eye, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened (Zech. 11:17). The
plague with which Jehovah shall smite all the people that have fought
against Jerusalem; their eyes shall consume away in their sockets (Zech.
14:12). I will smite every horse with amazement, and every horse of the
people with blindness (Zech. 12:4). "Horse," in the spiritual sense, is
the understanding of the Word (n. 298). Hear me, O Jehovah, my God,
enlighten mine eyes, lest I sleep death (Ps. 13:3). \[3\] That in these
passages, by "eyes" is signified the understanding, everyone sees. Hence
it is evident what the Lord meant by "eye" in these places: The lamp of
the body is the eye; if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be
light; if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be darkened. If
therefore the light \[lumen\] that is in thee be darkness, how great is
that darkness (Matt. 6:22-23; Luke 11:34). If thy right eye offend thee,
pluck it out, and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee to enter
into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast out into
the Gehenna of fire (Matt. 5:29; 18:9). By "eye" in these places is not
meant the eye, but the understanding of truth. Since by "eye" is
signified the understanding of truth, therefore it was among the
statutes of the sons of Israel, that: One blind, or disordered in the
eye from the seed of Aaron, should not come nigh to offer sacrifice; nor
enter within the veil (Lev. 21:18, 20); Then that anything blind should
not be offered in sacrifice (Lev. 22:22; Mal. 1:8). \[4\] From these
things it is evident what is meant by "eye," when predicated of a man;
hence it follows, that by "eye," when predicated of the Lord, His Divine
wisdom is meant, as also His Divine omniscience and providence; as in
these passages: Open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see (Isa. 37:17). I will
set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will build them (Jer. 24:6).
Behold the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear Him (Ps. 33:18).
Jehovah is in the temple of holiness, His eyes behold, His eyelids try
the sons of man (Ps. 11:4). Since by "cherubs" is signified the guard
and providence of the Lord lest the spiritual sense of the Word should
be injured; therefore it is said of the four animals which were cherubs,
that: They were full of eyes before and behind, and their wings were
likewise full of eyes (Rev. 4:6, 8); The wheels upon which the cherubs
were drawn, were full of eyes round about (Ezek. 10:12). \[5\] That by
"a flame of fire" is meant His Divine love, will be seen in what
follows, where "flame" and "fire" are mentioned; and because it is said,
that "His eyes were as a flame of fire," the Divine wisdom of the Divine
love is signified. That in the Lord there is the Divine love of the
Divine wisdom, and the Divine wisdom of the Divine love, and thus a
reciprocal union of both, is an arcanum disclosed in The Angelic Wisdom
concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom (n. 34-39; and elsewhere).

Verse 15. And His feet were like unto fine brass, as if glowing in a
furnace, signifies the Divine good natural. "The feet" of the Lord
signify His Divine natural; "fire" or "glowing" signifies good; and
"fine brass" signifies the good of natural truth; therefore, by "the
feet of the Son of man like unto fine brass, as if glowing in a
furnace," is signified the Divine good natural. That "His feet" signify
this is from correspondence. There is in the Lord, and therefore from
the Lord the Divine celestial, the Divine spiritual, and the Divine
natural; the Divine celestial is meant by the "head" of the Son of man;
the Divine spiritual, by His "eyes," and by the "breast," which was girt
about with a golden girdle; and the Divine natural, by His "feet." \[2\]
Because these three are in the Lord, therefore also they are in the
angelic heaven; the third or highest heaven is in the Divine celestial;
the second or middle heaven is in the Divine spiritual; and the first or
ultimate heaven in the Divine natural. In like manner, the church on the
earth; for the whole heaven before the Lord is as one man, in which they
who are in the Lord's Divine celestial make the head; they who are in
the Divine spiritual make the body; and they who are in the Divine
natural make the feet. Hence, also, in every man, because he was created
in the image of God, there are these three degrees, and, as these are
opened, he becomes an angel either of the third, or of the second, or of
the ultimate heaven. Hence, also it is, that in the Word there are three
senses; the celestial, the spiritual, and the natural. This may be seen
in The Angelic Wisdom concerning the Divine Love and Wisdom,
particularly in chapter 3, which treats of these three degrees. That the
feet, the soles, and the heels, correspond to natural things with man,
and therefore in the Word signify things natural, may be seen in The
Arcana Coelestia, published in London (n. 2162, 4938-4952). \[3\] The
Divine natural good is also signified by feet in the following places;
in Daniel: I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, behold a man clothed in
linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz; His body was like the
beryl, and His eyes as torches of fire, His arms and His feet like the
splendor of polished brass (Dan. 10:5-6). In Revelation: I saw an angel
come down from heaven, his feet as pillars of fire (Rev. 10:1). And in
Ezekiel: The feet of the cherubs were sparkling like the splendor of
polished brass (Ezek. 1:7). The reason why the angels and cherubs were
seen thus, was because the Divine of the Lord was represented in them.
\[4\] The Lord's church being under the heavens, thus under the Lord's
feet, it is therefore called "the footstool of His feet" in the
following places: The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, to decorate
the place of My sanctuary; and I will render the place of My feet
honorable; and they shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet
(Isa. 60:13-14). The heaven is My throne, and the earth is the footstool
of My feet (Isa. 66:1). God remembereth not the footstool of His feet in
the day of anger (Lam. 2:1). Adore Jehovah at the footstool of His feet
(Ps. 99:5). Lo, we heard of Him in Ephratah \[Bethlehem\]. We will go
into His habitations; we will bow ourselves down at the footstool of His
feet (Ps. 132:6-7). Thence it is that: They fell down at the Lord's feet
adoring (Matt. 28:9; Mark 5:22; Luke 8:41; John 11:32). Also that: They
kissed His feet and wiped them with their hairs (Luke 7:37, 38, 44-46;
John 11:2; 12:3). \[5\] As by "feet" is signified the natural, therefore
the Lord said to Peter, when He washed his feet: He that is washed,
needeth not save to wash his feet, and the whole is clean (John 13:10).
"To wash the feet" is to purify the natural man; and when this is
purified, the whole man is also purified; as is shown in many passages
in The Arcana Coelestia and in The Doctrines of the New Jerusalem. The
natural man, which is also the external man, is purified, when he shuns
the evils which the spiritual or internal man sees to be evils and that
they ought to be shunned. \[6\] Now since the natural of man is meant by
"feet," and this perverts all things if it be not washed or purified;
therefore the Lord says: And if thy foot offend thee cut it off; it is
better for thee to enter into life halt, than having two feet to be cast
into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire (Mark 9:45). Here the foot is
not meant, but the natural man. The same is meant by "trampling under
foot the good pasture," and by "troubling the waters with their feet"
(Ezek. 32:2; 34:18-19; Dan. 7:7, 19; and in other places). \[7\] Since
by the Son of man is meant the Lord as to the Word, it is evident, that
by His "feet" is also meant the Word in its natural sense; which is much
treated of in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning the Sacred
Scripture; as also that the Lord came into the world, that He might
fulfill all things of the Word, and thereby be made the Word also in
ultimates (n. 98-100). But this arcanum is for those who will be in the
New Jerusalem. \[8\] The Lord's Divine Natural is also signified by: The
brazen serpent, which was set up by the command of Moses in the
wilderness; by looking upon which, all who had been bitten by serpents
were healed (Num. 21:6, 8-9). This signified the Lord's Divine natural,
and that they are saved who look to it, the Lord Himself teaches in
John: As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the
Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should not
perish, but have eternal life (John 3:14-15). The reason why the serpent
was made of brass, is because brass, as also fine brass signifies the
natural as to good, see below (n. 775).

And His voice as the voice of many waters, signifies the Divine truth
natural. That a "voice" when from the Lord signifies the Divine truth,
may be seen above (n. 37); that "waters" signify truths, and,
specifically, natural truths, which are knowledges from the Word, is
evident from many passages in the Word; of which only the following are
adduced: The earth is full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters
cover the sea (Isa. 11:9). Therefore, with joy shall ye draw waters out
of the fountains of salvation (Isa. 12:3). He that walketh righteously
and speaketh uprightness bread shall be given him, and water shall be
sure (Isa. 33:15-16). The poor and needy seek water, but there is none;
their tongue faileth for thirst; I will open rivers on the hillsides,
and I will put fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the
wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of waters, that
they may see, acknowledge, attend and understand (Isa. 41:17-18, 20). I
will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry
ground, I will pour out my spirit (Isa. 44:3). Thy light shall rise in
darkness and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of
waters whose waters fail not (Isa. 58:10-11). My people have committed
two evils; they have deserted me, the fountain of living waters, to cut
out for themselves pits, that can hold no waters (Jer. 2:13). And their
great men sent their little ones for the waters, they came to the pits
and found no waters, they returned with their vessels empty (Jer. 14:3).
They have deserted Jehovah, the fountain of living waters (Jer. 17:13).
They shall come with weeping; and with weeping will I lead them, I will
lead them to the fountain of waters in a straight way (Jer. 31:9). I
will break the staff of bread; and they shall drink waters by measure
and with astonishment, that they may consume away for their iniquities
(Ezek. 4:16-17; 12:18-19; Isa. 51:14). Behold the days shall come, in
which I will send a famine in the land, not a famine for bread, nor a
thirst for waters, but for hearing the words of Jehovah; and they shall
wander from sea to sea; they shall run to and fro to hear the Word of
Jehovah, and shall not find it. In that day shall the virgins and youths
fail for thirst (Amos 8:11-13). And it shall be in that day that living
waters shall go out from Jerusalem (Zech. 14:8). Jehovah is my shepherd,
He will lead me to the waters of quietness (Ps. 23:1-2). They shall not
thirst, He will make waters to flow out of the rock for them, He will
cleave the rock that the waters may flow forth (Isa. 48:21). O God, I
seek thee in the morning, my soul thirsteth, I am weary without waters
(Ps. 63:1). Jehovah sendeth the Word, He causeth the wind to blow, that
the waters may flow (Ps. 147:18). Praise Jehovah, ye heavens of heavens,
and ye waters above the heavens (Ps. 148:4). Jesus, sitting at the
fountain of Jacob, said unto the woman, Whosoever drinketh of this
water, shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I
shall give, shall not thirst to eternity; and the water that I shall
give, shall be in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life
(John 4:7-15). Jesus said, If anyone thirst, let him come unto Me, and
drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his
belly shall flow streams of living water (John 7:37-38). I will give
unto him that thirsteth of the fountain of the water of life freely
(Rev. 21:6). He showed me a river of water of life, going out of the
throne of God, and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). The Spirit and the Bride
say, Come; and let him that heareth say, Come; and let him that
thirsteth come, and whosoever will, let him take the water of life
freely (Rev. 22:17). By "waters" in these passages are meant truths;
hence it is evident that by "the voice of many waters" is meant the
Divine truth of the Lord in the Word; as, also, in these places: Behold,
the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east, and His
voice was like the voice of many waters; and the earth was lighted by
His glory (Ezek. 43:2). I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many
waters (Rev. 14:2). The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters, Jehovah is
upon many waters (Ps. 29:3). When it is known that by "waters" in the
Word are meant truths in the natural man, it may appear what was
signified by washings, in the Israelitish church; and also what is
signified by baptism; and likewise by these words of the Lord, in John:
Except a man be born of water, and of the Spirit, he cannot enter the
kingdom of God (John 3:5). To be born "of water" signifies to be born by
truths; and "of the Spirit" signifies by a life according to them. That
"waters" in the opposite sense signify falsities, will be seen in what
follows.
