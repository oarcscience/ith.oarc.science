\[1\]Swedenborg gave neither numbers nor brief captions to the chapters
of the book. Nor did he prefix a recital of all the propositions and
subsidiary propositions to come in the book; this was the work of the
Latin editor. For this the above, giving the reader a succinct idea of
the book's contents, is substituted. \_Tr.\_
