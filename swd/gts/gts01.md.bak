### God the Savior

<span class="margnote"><span id="1.">1.</span></span>

The theology of the whole Christian world is founded on the worship of
three Gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2.">2.</span></span>

God is one in essence and Person.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3.">3.</span></span>

In Him is a Trinity, and this must not be distinguished into Persons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4.">4.</span></span>

The Divine attributes constitute His essence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5.">5.</span></span>

These are many, and also succeeding.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6.">6.</span></span>

The succeeding Divine attributes are creation and preservation,
redemption and salvation, reformation and regeneration.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7.">7.</span></span>

These are Divine, but that they are not as God is in Himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8.">8.</span></span>

The one God willed to become a natural Man, and thus a full Man, for
many reasons, the primary of which was the redemption of angels and men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9.">9.</span></span>

Passages from Scripture showing that there is one God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10.">10.</span></span>

He is the Redeemer and Savior.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11.">11.</span></span>

He came into the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12.">12.</span></span>

As to His Human, He called Himself Jesus Christ.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13.">13.</span></span>

Jehovah Himself came into the world and became the Savior and Redeemer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14.">14.</span></span>

The one God is not only the Creator, but also the Redeemer and
Regenerator.

<span class="margnote"><span id="15.">15.</span></span>

As to the Divine truth, He descended and took upon Himself the Human, is
confirmed in John, Chap. 1. Also, that He was from eternity, also from
His nativity, Luke 1.

<span class="margnote"><span id="16.">16.</span></span>

Passages from the sacred Scripture showing that He is the truth and the
light; also, that He is the Word and that He fulfilled the whole of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="17.">17.</span></span>

All things were made by him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="18.">18.</span></span>

In the spiritual sense, Divine truth is called the Son of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="19.">19.</span></span>

Divine truth is meant by Messiah, Christ, King, the Anointed, and David.

<span class="margnote"><span id="20.">20.</span></span>

Divine truth is meant by angel and by one sent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="21.">21.</span></span>

Divine truth is meant by glory.

<span class="margnote"><span id="22.">22.</span></span>

In no other way could all things in the heavens and in the hells have
been reduced into order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="23.">23.</span></span>

In no other way could He destroy the old church and institute a new
church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="24.">24.</span></span>

In no other way could He admit temptations into Himself, and suffer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="25.">25.</span></span>

In no other way could He be in the state of exinanition and pray to God
the Father as though absent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="26.">26.</span></span>

In no other way could He become Redemption and Justice from His own
power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="27.">27.</span></span>

Thus, in no other way could He unite the Human to the Divine and the
reverse, and thus add the Human in time to the Divine from eternity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="28.">28.</span></span>

In no other way could He be and become one with the Father.

<span class="margnote"><span id="29.">29.</span></span>

All things which are in the Divine are together in the Human.

<span class="margnote"><span id="30.">30.</span></span>

The Lord glorified His Human in the order in which He makes man
spiritual, or an angel. Concerning the two states of man's regeneration.

<span class="margnote"><span id="31.">31.</span></span>

Thus He made His Human Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="32.">32.</span></span>

Thus He became the First and the Last, thus the all in all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="33.">33.</span></span>

The Divine operation is from firsts through lasts, and because, in the
church, lasts had failed, therefore, He made Himself the Last.

<span class="margnote"><span id="34.">34.</span></span>

Man cannot be conjoined with God except by means of a visible and
accessible Human.

<span class="margnote"><span id="35.">35.</span></span>

Every male is born, as to his spiritual origin, from truth as a seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="36.">36.</span></span>

The reason why men have not hitherto perceived this, and why
consequently there have been so many opinions about the human nature of
Christ, is because men have had no distinct understanding concerning the
nature of good and truth and of their marriage, nor concerning the
nature of the will and the understanding, nor of the soul and the body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="37.">37.</span></span>

The virgin also, of whom He was born, signifies the church as to the
affection of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="38.">38.</span></span>

It was necessary for Him to be born of a virgin in legitimate marriage
with Joseph.

<span class="margnote"><span id="39.">39.</span></span>

Christ alone is man from eternity and natural man in time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="40.">40.</span></span>

In Him everything is Divine from the Divine in itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="41.">41.</span></span>

He alone is to be approached, that there may be salvation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="42.">42.</span></span>

He must be approached immediately, and if He is approached mediately,
communication is intercepted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="43.">43.</span></span>

Here may be adduced those passages, which treat of the "great
affliction," and the things which follow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="44.">44.</span></span>

To worship three Gods is to worship none.

<span class="margnote"><span id="45.">45.</span></span>

No one comes to God or is conjoined to Him, unless the Human be
approached; otherwise God is not accessible.

<span class="margnote"><span id="46.">46.</span></span>

Because God the Father is the Redeemer as to the Human.

<span class="margnote"><span id="47.">47.</span></span>

In order that there may be conjunction, there must be a visible God,
thus one accessible and fixed; this is not so apparent to Christians,
but it is to all others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="48.">48.</span></span>

The Divine truth suffered.
