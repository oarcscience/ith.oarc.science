### De Domino

<span class="margnote"><span id="51.">51.</span></span>

That He meant Himself when He named the Father, is plain from passages
quoted above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="52.">52.</span></span>

That for the sake of the internal sense He named the Divine good Father,
and the Divine truth Christ, is plain from Matt. 23:9, 10 (which may be
introduced), and from very many other passages.

<span class="margnote"><span id="53.">53.</span></span>

To know and acknowledge its God is the first thing of the church, for
the reason that without this there is no safety; as may be manifest from
the Jews, that when they did not worship Jehovah, although they were
steadfast in their other rites, they were accursed. (Passages from the
Word.) Then that the Lord so often said, Because they believe, therefore
it is done to them - for this was then the first thing, to believe in
the Lord, and to believe that to Him was all authority; and because of
their former faith, He said, "the Father" before them, but He meant
Himself, as is plain from many passages. (Let the passages be quoted.)
This knowledge and acknowledgment conjoin; and without them there is no
conjunction, and thus no salvation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="54.">54.</span></span>

(All the passages may perhaps be quoted in which it is said, "My
Father," "your Father," "the Father who is in the heavens"; and it may
be briefly told what they signify.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="55.">55.</span></span>

FROM REASON There is one God; and this is acknowledged in all the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="56.">56.</span></span>

The soul induces likeness in the body, and the body is but the external
form of its own soul.

<span class="margnote"><span id="57.">57.</span></span>

The Divine Itself, and the Divine love, was His soul; it could not be
otherwise than that the body should be like it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="58.">58.</span></span>

All the affections of a father abide in his children. (From experience.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="59.">59.</span></span>

In the Christian world they have with difficulty an idea of the Divine
in the Human; but still, everywhere . . . (Let the sections be reviewed
- and wherever . . .)

<span class="margnote"><span id="60.">60.</span></span>

When three Persons of the Divinity are acknowledged, there can by no
means be the acknowledgment of one God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="61.">61.</span></span>

The acknowledgment of three Persons has withheld Mohammedans, Jews, and
others, from the reception of Christianity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="62.">62.</span></span>

Everyone ought to know his God, so that He may be conjoined to him and
be saved. The Lord can be seen by faith, and can be known by love; but
not the Father. No one has seen the Father. (Let passages be introduced
from New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 283.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="63.">63.</span></span>

(Lastly.) CONCERNING THE HOLY SPIRIT (From those things which are in the
explanation of the Apocalypse, n. 183.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="64.">64.</span></span>

What is meant by this - That the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Lord -
but that which is holy proceeds, which is called the Holy Spirit?

<span class="margnote"><span id="65.">65.</span></span>

The sin against the Holy Spirit is the denial of the Divine of the Lord
(Matt. 12:28, 32; Mark 3:28, 29; Luke 11:20, etc.). This is evident from
what precedes. They said that He cast out demons "by the prince of the
demons"; and He said that He did it "by the Spirit of God," that is, by
His own Divine. This denial in heart is not remitted, for such cannot
enter heaven; as all Socinians. (Some things concerning them from
experience.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="66.">66.</span></span>

Also they within the church who deny the Divine of the Lord, and who
acknowledge the Father only, cannot be saved. And very many of them
acknowledge nature; and they therefore have no other idea of the Divine
than as of nature in its least parts. Reasons will be given why they
cannot be turned to the Lord, but turn to worldly loves. (These things
last.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="67.">67.</span></span>

That by "the Spirit of God" is meant the Divine, is also manifest in
Luke, where it is said, "By the finger of God" (Luke 11:20); and "the
finger of God" signifies the Divine power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="68.">68.</span></span>

That the Father means by the Divine of the Lord is evident; also that
the Lord says that their sons cast out demons through Him (Matt. 12:27;
also Luke 11:19). Jesus gave unto the disciples authority over all
demons (Luke 9:1; 10:17, 20; Mark 16:17, 18). That in the name of the
Lord they cast out demons (Luke 9:49, 50; Mark 9:38).

<span class="margnote"><span id="69.">69.</span></span>

That among Christians the Human was made distinct from the Divine, and
was made merely human, was chiefly for the sake of the Pope, who did not
dare to call himself God's vicar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="70.">70.</span></span>

Every man is born ignorant of truth, and desirous of evil, because his
soul, from his father, is an evil affection. But the Lord alone is born
seeking good, and desiring truth, because His soul from the Father was
the Divine itself, thus the affection of Divine love, or the Divine
love, from which He subdued the external which was from the mother.

<span class="margnote"><span id="71.">71.</span></span>

By "the Son of man" is meant truth from the Divine. (Because this is not
understood, it must be explained.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="72.">72.</span></span>

LASTLY (Lastly bring together passages concerning the Lord from New
Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine . . . also from Arcana Coelestia;
then from Heaven and Hell, from Last Judgment . . . and from Earths in
the Universe; only the cited passages concerning the Lord.)
