### Last Judgment Posthumous

<span class="margnote"><span id="301.">301.</span></span>

\[278\] THE MORAVIANS. I do not write of those who are in the world, but
of those who are out of the world, I spoke with these and I heard.
\[279\] (1) They are mere Arians, and deny the Divine of the Lord,
saying that He has the Divine, such as man has. When it was said to them
that He was conceived of Jehovah, they come together, nor do they wish
easily to admit it, wishing to deny the Scripture lest they should be
refuted; but still they say something that the Jews do. Others when they
are convinced, say that He was born that He might be adopted. They
confirm themselves by the Lord's word that in His freedom He was left to
suffer the cross, not knowing why this was done. They say that they love
Him, because He took it upon Himself to suffer the cross, and also
because it is commanded by the Father, then especially because He is
loved by the Father on account of the passion of the cross. (2) They
reject the Old Testament as no longer for them but for the Jews. (3)
They also despise the Gospels, saying that the Lord is spoken of as a
simple man, and thus that there is nothing Divine in them. (4)
Concerning faith in Him spoken of in the Gospels, they say that He so
wished it, and that it ought not speak thus. (5) They acknowledge the
Epistles of Paul only, and also the historicals of the Word, but they do
not believe in the holiness of the Word. (6) They say concerning good
works and charity, that they ought not to be together with faith, and
that they shudder at doing good works for the sake of heaven, and that
in their heaven they would rather adopt the most malevolent than such;
in a word they condemn them to hell. (7) In speaking they utter the
greatest fallacies; they speak with each one according to his heart in
religion. They guard lest those mysteries should be disclosed; the rest
which are concerning the Holy Supper and Baptism they think and teach
violently. They are such things as do not agree with the faith of the
Reformed, nor do they admit to the Holy Supper any others than those who
receive those three mysteries, because they have confirmed them. (8)
From these things it is evident that they are among the worst who
profess Christianity. (9) They make much of their sensation, but it was
shown to them, that their sensation is with their spirits, who were
enthusiastic spirits from their assembly in the world, who come nearer
to them, who think much of their religion and love it, saying that they
are more loving and happy than others. These confirm them very greatly,
thence is their sensation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="302.">302.</span></span>

\[280\] They are held in the lower earth to the left in a society
separated from the rest; because they are among themselves, and they are
a society of interior friendship, which if it should be in the
neighborhood of others, they would destroy their delights. They recede
by turns from that society towards the left, into a desert which is for
them alone, where there is no grass, where there are crags and cliffs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="303.">303.</span></span>

\[281\] THE DUTCH. How formally and courteously they invite their wives
and bring and lead them to their house, and show how well it is with
those who act together in unity in their houses, and also how clean and
well furnished their houses are; and on the contrary how unclean those
are where there is the dominion of one over the other; savory food is
also given those who act in unity, and they are taught by these things
the quality of their delight when one is of the other mutually and
reciprocally. Therefore when they see those things and apperceive them
to be true they desist from dominion; and then they obtain a habitation
nearer to the middle, and are led into a house better furnished. The
reason is that there is then conjugial love, which regarded in itself is
celestial love itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="304.">304.</span></span>

\[282\] THE MORAVIANS IN LONDON, THE HERRENHUTERS AND THE JEWS. The
Moravians dwell in the furthest corner of the place of exit mostly at
the side there, but when they journey into the city as to their
sanctuary, they appear to proceed towards the middle and thence a little
to the south, and thus to their corner, which is done because they wish
to appear to others as Christians, of a similar doctrine. Afterwards
from their corner they go into the west where the presbyters are who are
in faith alone, concerning whom we have before spoken, and they return
thence. From their corner, which is as it were their inn there, they go
out by turns, and descend into a vault which stretches deeply under the
west, where the presbyters are of whom we have before spoken, and their
hell is there, from which they are no longer let out, except some into
deserts. It is not allowed them to dwell near others, nor elsewhere,
because they form a society of interior friendship, which takes away the
spiritual delight of others. They say to others that they should dwell
here and there even to the middle, but still they dwell at that corner,
of which they have an idea as of their inn. \[283\] They appear in a way
towards the middle, because they persuade that they are of the Anglican
religion and speak with the English piously as if they were; and that
they differ only as to ceremonials, which are like those of the
Apostles. When they are asked why their preachers are clothed in blue,
they say because that color is loved; nor do they dare to say that they
should be clothed like the English preachers in a black gown, because
they fear lest their mysteries should be disclosed. They very greatly
fear to be sincere and just on account of religion. They are altogether
averse to this, wherefore they are prone to all kinds of evils, taking
care only lest they be discovered, because with others this would be
hurtful to their religion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="305.">305.</span></span>

\[284\] Moreover the Jews do not dwell upon the earth in London, but
under the earth there, on the northern side below, where Towerhill is.
They enter there through a dark opening. And the citizens of the city do
not know where they dwell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="306.">306.</span></span>

\[285\] THE LOVE OF KNOWING. The love of knowing is the external of the
will, the use on account of which \[it is done\] is the internal of the
will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="307.">307.</span></span>

\[286\] With infants and boys the external rules, in process of time the
internal is formed. \[Marginal Note:\] \[291\] Use of life makes the
internal of the will originating from the sun of heaven. It \[that is
the exterior\] is as in the time of winter, and like what is foul
shining exteriorly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="308.">308.</span></span>

\[287\] Then there is formed the love of knowing for the sake of use,
these are formed whether they are good or evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="309.">309.</span></span>

\[288\] But the love of understanding whether a thing is true or not,
and thence the love of being wise, is also the external of the will,
originating from the light of heaven and its variegation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="310.">310.</span></span>

\[289\] This love, because it is the external of the will, can be
separated from its internal, and then it is the love of one's own glory,
on account of glory and not on account of any use then. Therefore it can
be given also with the evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="311.">311.</span></span>

\[290\] Or the external of the will in the understanding is the love of
truth on account of glory, thus on account of the external.

<span class="margnote"><span id="312.">312.</span></span>

\[292\] THE JEWS. The Jews less than others know that they are in the
spiritual world. They think there of the Messiah as they did in the
world and expect Him. And they say that He will come. But when it is
said to them that it will be in Bethlehem, and from the house of David,
and they are asked where is Bethlehem now, and where is the house of
David, they do not know how to answer other than that He knows where
that city is, and where that family is. Some of them in the other life
say that the Messiah is in heaven, and that He will not come to those in
the spiritual world before He is born a boy in the world. \[293\] When
they are asked whether they only who are in the world will be led into
Canaan, they reply that they will then return into the world, and they
will dwell with them in the land of Canaan. When they are asked whether
they will then be again born, they say they will not, but that they will
descend to them, believing that thus they will be men like them. When
they are asked whether Canaan will be capacious enough for all who have
been born from that nation from the time of Abraham, they say that the
land of Canaan will then be enlarged. When they are asked how the
Messiah, the Son of Jehovah, can dwell with such evil persons, they say
that they are not evil. When it is said that Moses in his song said that
they were the worst, and do they read it and sing it as was commanded by
Moses, they reply that Moses was angry when he wrote that, because they
departed from him, and therefore they do not read it, but run through it
quickly. When it is said to them that their origin is from a
Canaanitess, and from whoredom with a daughter-in-law, they then are
angry and depart, saying that it is enough that they are from Abraham
and Jacob. They say that Moses and David will also return and go with
the Messiah, one at His right and the other at His left. They narrate
many fabulous things concerning the Messiah, how He will introduce them
into the land of Canaan, and how rich Christians will follow them
freely, if they give them their money. Nevertheless many of them who
know that Christ who is the Messiah rules all things in the heavens, say
that they wish to receive this, but cannot; they hear it from Moses, who
sometimes appears above with a rod, and teaches this, and when they
hear, they go away in various directions. They said to me, "Why did He
suffer the cross?" I replied, "Because He was the greatest prophet, and
therefore He carried the iniquities of the people, like the prophet who
lay on his right side and on the left, and ate bread made of barley and
filth, of whom it is said that he bore their iniquities; likewise other
prophets, one who took a harlot to wife, who put on ashes, who went
barefoot, who thus bore their iniquities; in like manner it is said of
the Messiah" (Isa. 53). When they heard this they said that they would
go off among themselves and consult together. They who have not become
foul from filthy avarice, and who have not become devils from hatred,
fraud and revenge, are tolerated below the heavens where their
habitations are, because they regard the Word as holy, and they who
suffer themselves to be instructed concerning the Lord, are transferred
to societies where they are instructed, and are sent back to those who
have not yet received. Their business is dealing in diamonds and
precious stones as in the world. They procure them for themselves from
heaven. They learn that they have that business, because they regard the
Word as holy, because the sense of the letter corresponds to those
stones and signifies them. Therefore the more holy they regard the Word,
the better do they succeed there in that business.

<span class="margnote"><span id="313.">313.</span></span>

\[303\] DEGREES. There is a natural kingdom, a spiritual kingdom, and a
celestial kingdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="314.">314.</span></span>

\[304\] In the natural kingdom are men whilst they live in the world. In
the spiritual kingdom are spiritual angels; in the celestial kingdom are
celestial angels; for there are these three universals, the natural, the
spiritual, and the celestial.

<span class="margnote"><span id="315.">315.</span></span>

\[305\] In each kingdom there are two degrees, in the natural two, in
the spiritual two, and in the celestial two; thus in the three kingdoms
there are six degrees. \[306\] All these degrees are discrete, or
discontinuous, and are called degrees of altitude. \[307\] Discrete
degrees are to each other as thought to speech, or as the affection to
gesture, or as the affection of the mind to the countenance; and in the
material world as the ether to the air, or as a nerve to the fibers of
which it is composed. All compositions in the whole natural world and in
the spiritual world are of this character, and they consist either of
two or three degrees of this kind in their order. These degrees are
called prior and posterior, higher and lower, interior and exterior;
and, in general, they are as cause and effect, or as a substance and a
substantiate, or as the aggregate from substances, or as a principle and
the principiates, or the thing formed from principles.

<span class="margnote"><span id="316.">316.</span></span>

\[308\] There are also continuous or cohering degrees; each discrete
degree has its continuous degree. The continuous degree of each discrete
degree is as light verging to shade, and at length to the obscurity of
night; and also as the rational thought which is in light to sensual
and, as it were, at length to corporeal thought, which is in a dense
shade according as it descends to the body. In such a degree continually
decreasing is the human mind. In a similar degree, but lower; are man's
sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch; in like manner his speech and
his singing; for man has a tone like the tone of a lyre, and like the
sound of a drum. It is also similar with harmonies and beauties; for
they proceed by continuous degrees from the highest harmony and beauty,
to the least. These degrees are of the cause in itself and of the effect
in itself; they are distinguished from the former degrees, because these
are of the cause and the effect in themselves. Continuous degrees are
called degrees of what is purer or grosser. An idea of these degrees can
be had chiefly from light and shade, and also from the aerial atmosphere
in its lower and higher regions; for in the lower region it is grosser,
denser, and more compressed, and in the higher region it is purer,
rarer, and more extended.

<span class="margnote"><span id="317.">317.</span></span>

\[309\] Unless one procures a knowledge of these two kinds of degrees,
he cannot have an idea of the interiors and exteriors of man, thus
neither of the soul and the body, nor indeed of causes and effects. Nor
can he have an idea of the distinction between the heavens, nor of the
wisdom of the angels in the heavens; nor can he have any idea of
correspondences, of representatives, of influx, of order, thus he cannot
have an idea of those things which are of order, both in the natural
world and in the spiritual world, thus scarcely any just idea of
anything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="318.">318.</span></span>

\[310\] Few hitherto have had any other idea of degrees than of
continuous degrees, which is, as was said, from what is pure to what is
gross, or from greatest to least. From which it follows that only one
kind of degrees has been known, and that the natural degree and the
spiritual degree are distinguished only as what is pure and gross; in
like manner the difference between the heavens, and also in the wisdom
of the angels. Whereas the difference is according to discrete degrees,
the nature of which we shall presently show from experience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="319.">319.</span></span>

\[311\] There are, therefore, as stated above, six discrete degrees, two
in the natural kingdom, two in the spiritual kingdom, and two in the
celestial kingdom; but these degrees are those in which men and angels
are, as to their thoughts, their affections, and their wisdom therefrom.
Degrees are as follows: Below these six degrees of life, there follow
similar degrees, and also material, even to the ultimate, and above
those six degrees ascend degrees of the infinite even to the Divine
itself. For the Divine itself cannot flow into any angel or man from
itself but by discrete degrees; for if it flowed in immediately, or by
what is continuous, both angel and man, from the ardor of the Divine
love, and from the light of the Divine wisdom, would be entirely
consumed. This would be as though the sun, of the world, from its fire,
were to flow immediately into the objects of the earth, and not
mediately through the atmospheres according to distinct discrete
degrees.

<span class="margnote"><span id="320.">320.</span></span>

\[312\] There are three natural atmospheres arising from the sun of the
world, and there are three spiritual atmospheres arising from the sun of
heaven, which is the Lord. The three natural atmospheres arising from
the sun of the world are the purer ether, which is universal, from which
is all gravitation; the middle ether, which forms the vortex around the
planets, in which are the moons and the satellites, from which is
magnetism; and the ultimate ether which is the air. By these three
atmospheres all the corporeal and material things of the earth are held
together, which are so composed as to be applicable to those three
degrees. The three spiritual atmospheres arising from the sun of heaven,
are those in which are the angels of the three heavens. In the two
higher atmospheres are the angels of the Lord's celestial kingdom; in
the third and the first natural, which is pure ether, are the angels of
the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and in the atmospheres following those two
which are the middle and the ultimate ether, which is the air, are men
while they are in the natural world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="321.">321.</span></span>

\[313\] But it should be known, that the atmospheres arising from the
sun of heaven, which is the Lord, properly speaking, are not three, but
six, there are three above the sun of the world, and there are three
below it. The three below the sun of the world constantly accompany the
three natural atmospheres, and enable a man in the natural world to
think and to feel. For the atmospheres arising from the sun of the world
have not life in themselves, because they originate from a sun which is
pure fire; but the atmospheres arising from the sun of heaven, which is
the Lord, have life in themselves, because they originate in the sun,
which is pure love and pure wisdom. The atmospheres which originate from
the sun of the world, which is pure fire, cause those things on the
earth, and in the human body, to subsist and be held in connection
together, and they are not changed except according to the laws of
natural order. Hence is the difference between things in the natural
world and in the spiritual world, concerning which difference more will
be said in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="322.">322.</span></span>

\[314\] That in the spiritual world which is above the natural world,
there are also atmospheres, is evident from the light and heat there,
which before the eyes and senses of the angels appear similar to the
light and heat before the eyes and senses of men; and angels are
spiritual, but men are natural, and there cannot possibly be any light
and heat with their differences without atmospheres. That there are also
spiritual atmospheres is evident from many appearances in the spiritual
world, as from the appearance of colors there, of meteors, of clouds
both thin and thick, of winds, of gravities, pressures, and consequent
consistencies, which although they appear entirely similar to such
things as are in the natural world, nevertheless, they are spiritual and
not natural; although before the angels, because they are spiritual,
they appear similar. That there are spiritual atmospheres, is evident
especially from the respiration of angels and spirits. For angels and
spirits breathe in like manner as men in the world; but angels breathe
from their atmospheres, and men from theirs. The angels in the celestial
kingdom breathe from their atmosphere which is more pure, but the angels
of the spiritual kingdom breathe from their atmosphere which is less
pure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="323.">323.</span></span>

\[315\] But the things which we have hitherto said concerning degrees
and atmospheres are, for the most part, theoretical; but all theoretical
things should be drawn and concluded from the facts of experience, and
also be confirmed by them. For unless the facts of experience, as it
were, lead the hand of man in coming to conclusions, he may be deceived
in theoretical things, and from some imaginary hypothesis, be carried
away into false principles entirely opposed to what is true, which he
can then confirm by fallacies and appearances of every kind; for false
principles may be confirmed by appearances and fallacies to such a
degree, that a man may believe that they are truths themselves. I wish,
therefore, now to produce some facts of experience, by which not only
what has been said may be confirmed, but also by which everyone who is
in the light of the mind or who has natural ability, may draw
conclusions as to many other things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="324.">324.</span></span>

\[316\] In the natural kingdom in which men are whilst they live in the
world, and in the spiritual kingdom where the spiritual angels are, and
in the celestial kingdom in which are the celestial angels, similar
things appear, so much so that there is scarcely any other difference
than that the like things in the spiritual kingdom are more perfect than
in the natural kingdom, and in the celestial kingdom still more perfect
than in the spiritual kingdom. A spirit or an angel appears like a man
in the world, even so that he knows no otherwise than that he is a man
of the world. He has a similar face and a similar body, and in the face
similar eyes, nostrils, ears, lips, mouth, and similar hair; and in the
body also a similar breast, abdomen, loins, hands and feet, and also
similar organs of generation; in a word, he is a man in external form
altogether like a man of the world. He has similar lungs, because he
breathes; and he has a similar heart, because it pulsates. The other
interior viscera of the body are also similar, because there are
societies in heaven which equally correspond to these viscera. There is
likewise a ruddiness in the face, hands, arms, and body, as if from
blood in the arteries and veins. There are also similar fibers, nerves,
and muscles, because in like manner a spirit moves his limbs like a man
in the world. Moreover, he has similar sight, hearing, smell, taste and
touch. He also has similar speech and singing; he has also a similar
power of imagination, thought, intellect, and will, also affection and
cupidity. In a word, an angel or a spirit is so similar to a man of the
world, that he himself knows no otherwise than that he is a man of the
world. Conjugial love is also similar with all its effect; moreover
there is not propagation, but in place of it unition of minds, and
thence an increase of intelligence and wisdom. Thence it is that in the
Word in its spiritual sense by marriage is meant the conjunction of
truth and good, and by daughters goods, and by sons truths, and so on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="325.">325.</span></span>

\[317\] Their garments also are similar to the garments of men; they
have tunics, mantles, breeches, stockings, shoes, caps, tiaras and
undergarments like those in the world, with some difference as to
colors, especially of the tunics. The reason is, because colors signify
the appearances of truth from good, and garments signify truths, and
hence the clothing of the understanding.

<span class="margnote"><span id="326.">326.</span></span>

\[318\] They have also similar houses, in which are apartments and
chambers with courts as in the world, and within there are tables,
benches, utensils, and various decorations. In heaven there are palaces
so magnificent that palaces in the world cannot be compared to them.
These palaces are of a magnitude so great, and of such symmetrical and
architectural beauty, both without and within, and are decorated in such
forms with gold and precious stones, that no picture painter on earth
could possibly express them. There are also marble houses and houses of
a blue color. The use of every apartment is known from its decorations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="327.">327.</span></span>

\[319\] They have also similar food and drink as in the world, and
various kinds of food and drink are named.

<span class="margnote"><span id="328.">328.</span></span>

\[320\] In the spiritual world are likewise earths, mountains, hills,
plains, grassy fields, paradises or gardens, groves and woods. There are
ways everywhere tending to various societies, some are guarded. These
ways then first appear to a spirit when he goes into his own society.
There are also in that world fountains, lakes, and seas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="329.">329.</span></span>

\[321\] There appear likewise animals of the earth and all kinds of
flying things, greater and smaller. There also appear compound animals,
such as are described in the Word, there are also various insects or
worms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="330.">330.</span></span>

\[322\] In a word, in the spiritual world there are not only similar
things as in the natural world, but innumerable others; and everything
exists with infinite variety and harmony, from which there breathes
forth delight. In a word, in heaven there is a heaven in all and in each
thing, in general and in every particular. Thus every external sense has
its own heaven, and everything of the internal sense has also its own
heaven, and an angel is a heaven in its least form, and each one, as he
has heaven in himself, has also heaven outside of himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="331.">331.</span></span>

\[323\] But it must be known that all things, and each now mentioned,
are not material but spiritual, or are from a spiritual origin; and yet
spirits know no otherwise than that they are material; the reason is,
that when what is spiritual touches or tastes what is spiritual, it is
altogether like when what is material touches or tastes what is
material. Concerning this appearance I have often had a discussion with
spirits, who believe that the things which they see and touch are
material. I have shown them by various methods, and by various reasons
even to the life, that nothing in the spiritual world is material, but
that everything there is spiritual. I demonstrated it to them by the
houses, which in a moment are formed, and in a moment are destroyed and
dissipated; also by their garments, which in a moment are put on, and in
a moment are changed; new garments are also given in a moment. In like
manner I have demonstrated it from their dinners and repasts, showing
that the tables upon which is the food, exist in a moment, and are
afterwards dissipated in a moment; and that the spirits themselves can
enter into the houses through the walls, and oftentimes not entering in
through the doors. There was a certain individual known to me, with whom
I conversed when his body which he had in the world was being buried,
and I told him that he was now being buried, when he replied that he did
not know what of him was being buried, because he had all things with
him, a similar body as before, and other things similar, for he, like
others, did not know otherwise than that he was still material, whereas
he was spiritual. He was soon instructed that his material body, which
he carried about with him in the world, and which then clothed his
spiritual body, was being buried.

<span class="margnote"><span id="332.">332.</span></span>

\[324\] WONDERFUL THINGS \[CONCERNING THE LANGUAGE OF SPIRITS\]. Spirits
and angels do not know otherwise than that they speak the same language
they did in the world, write as they did in the world, and think as they
did in the world, when yet they speak the spiritual language, in which
there is no expression similar to any in the world; and they write by
letters and characters; but it differs so much from writings in the
world, that there is nothing whatever that is similar, except the
letters and some points. Yea, they think altogether otherwise than in
the world, so differently, that no thought is similar; but still they do
not know otherwise than that all things are similar. That it is so I
have often experienced by this, that spirits and angels when they are
with me, are in my natural state; and it was said to them that in their
spiritual state they should speak words and sentences, and retain the
words with me in the natural state; and then there was not a single word
alike, nor did they understand one of their words. They like-wise wrote
a sentence in the spiritual state, and when it had been written it was
shown in the natural state; there was nothing similar but the letters
and points. Likewise when they thought in the spiritual state, they
could not bring forth any idea of thought in the natural state. As for
example, they say Rocky \[scopulosum\] and to wish life \[vitam velle\].
Scopulosum in the spiritual language signifies that he casts out of
doors, and vitam velle, that it is afar off. When they retain these
expressions in the natural state, they do not understand them, nor any
expression in the natural state when they come into the spiritual state.
When they write scopulosum, they write ---, and when they write vitam
velle, they write ---, and they suppose that they have written it fully.
They write the sense of the words by alphabetic letters, each one of
which signifies a thing ---. They write also by many signs, so that the
greater the angelic wisdom is, the more things of wisdom they understand
in the writing; the Word is thus written.

<span class="margnote"><span id="333.">333.</span></span>

\[325\] From these things it may be concluded that there is no ratio
given by continuity between the natural and the spiritual; and that
spirits and angels who are with men do not know that they are with them,
nor an angel or a spirit that he is with a man. These wonderful things
were disclosed to me before those in the spiritual world who were with
me today, because they could be with me in my natural state and not
before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="334.">334.</span></span>

\[326\] It is altogether similar between the thought, speech and writing
of the angels of the Lord's celestial kingdom and of the angels of the
spiritual kingdom, as there is between those who are in the spiritual
kingdom in relation to those who are in the natural kingdom. This also
has been confirmed by experience. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[334-1](#fn_43.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="335.">335.</span></span>

\[327\] THE ENGLISH. The garments of the English are not like their
garments in the world, neither those of the virgins nor of the women.
They are adapted altogether to their general affection. When viewed in
the spiritual state they appear graceful and beautiful, because they are
altogether in agreement with their genius. But when the same are seen in
their natural state, they do not appear so beautiful. The reason is that
garments signify truths, and therefore all are clothed according to the
reception of truth.

\[328\] <span id="fr_44"></span>[336-1](#fn_44.md) In London there are ten
moderators of similar authority.

<span class="margnote"><span id="337.">337.</span></span>

\[329\] The understanding teaches the will and does not lead it, or
faith teaches, but does not produce good works. For man can discern and
see what is good and evil, but still act contrary there to, and then he
either shuns it, or holds it in hatred, the will in the understanding is
then opposite, yea in time dissipates it. Truth seen is what one
acknowledges, but this is not the truth of life. But what once becomes
of the will is either evil or good, this is stirred up by the sight and
by the understanding, or the thought, and then the will is stirred up,
and thence it exists in the thought. It is thus effected in all things
reborn. It then appears as if the will was aroused by the thought; but
it is not so. It is as if the sight should teach the feet to walk
cautiously, and the hands to do the work. It appears as if that leads,
but it does not lead, but shows and teaches. It is altogether like the
heart and the lungs. The lungs do not respire unless the heart also
acts, nor can there be given a reciprocal conjunction from the lungs but
from the heart. See more below.

<span class="margnote"><span id="338.">338.</span></span>

\[330\] It is to be observed, that there may be anything either
spiritual, moral or civil whose effect man has produced and thence has
loved; the man (1) hears it from another, or he reads it in a book. (2)
Thence it becomes his thought. (3) In the thought there is raised up a
perception of it, because this was the first of that thing. (4) His
affection is in the perception, thus the affection of truth. (5) This
affection which is called the affection of truth is from the affection
of good, which is of the will, thus from the will in the affection of
truth there is effected the conjunction of good and truth, in which
conjunction the will and the understanding or good and truth act as one.
(6) Thus one is concealed in the other, within, and all are aroused from
the ultimate, even through the hearing and sight, that is, the rousing
up, namely because the will is concealed inmostly in the hearing, and
thence in the thought, and it goes forth not otherwise than the
spiritual sense and the celestial sense from the natural sense into the
hearing, and thence sight is simultaneous. But it does not produce;
production is effected by the will or the affection of good into the
affection of truth, thence into the perception and from this into the
thought; but not vice versa. From these things it is evident whence are
appearances.

<span class="margnote"><span id="339.">339.</span></span>

\[331\] Thought is also given from hearing, and within the thought is
perception, and within the perception is the affection of truth, and not
at the same time the affection of the good of that truth. The affection
of its good can be given with the love of self, of reputation, honor,
and gain, but this is not marriage, but adultery. The reason is that
this good which is merely natural, can be opposite to the good of truth
itself, which is spiritual in various ways and respects. Examples may
teach this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="340.">340.</span></span>

\[332\] When man is in his natural good, which in itself is evil, he
then either does not know that \[spiritual good\], or denies it. He does
so when he is in his proprium.

<span class="margnote"><span id="341.">341.</span></span>

\[333\] There is given the affection of knowing and understanding truth
on account of glory, gain, and remuneration. The love of knowing and
understanding is the love of natural light; the love of knowing and
understanding truths is the love of spiritual light, which love is
especially given with those who are in the love of good, but it is also
given with those who are in the love of glory. From experience it has
been given me to know that the love of light on account of glory as also
of use is given with those who are in the love of evil; but with them
the love of evil is then hidden or is lulled to sleep. It touches only
the surface, as beauty from various colors, and the more it is hidden or
lulled to sleep, the more it can feel delight. The love of knowing and
understanding truths is from the external, which can be given provided
the internal is hidden or is lulled to sleep; but it is a spurious love;
it is like some filthy object covered over with a beautiful color, yea,
with gold, underneath which surface there is evil. Therefore when good
is in evil, one cannot know and understand those things, yea, he holds
them in hatred, for he then confirms himself against truths. Thus the
internal dissipates the external. Yea, there is given a holy external
and a profane internal, the internal is lulled to sleep, but not the
external; the external is not asleep.

<span class="margnote"><span id="342.">342.</span></span>

\[334\] IN THE TREATISE ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. It must treat of faith
and of the understanding of truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="343.">343.</span></span>

\[335\] (1) What faith is. (2) That there is conjunction with good
works, and there is so much of faith as there is of life. (3) That life
is the soul of faith. (4) That faith separate is not faith, it is
inanimate. (5) It is the dragon; it is the he-goat; it is Philistia; it
is Cain; it is Reuben. (6) What is faith? It is truth. (7) At this day
how sterile \[is faith separate\], and religion is nothing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="344.">344.</span></span>

\[336\] (1) In heaven they altogether reject the dogma that the
understanding is to be held under obedience to faith. (2) All things of
theology can be comprehended by the understanding. (3) Not only by the
spiritual understanding by the angels, but by the rational understanding
by men. (4) Otherwise from theological authority they could say whatever
they wished.

<span class="margnote"><span id="345.">345.</span></span>

\[337\] FOODS. There were some in the lowest heaven, to whom the
atmosphere above appeared like water. I spoke with them and they said
that they have choice foods, and they take them from the table and keep
them until evening, and eat therefrom at will; but it is not allowed
them to hide them until morning. This is what is meant in the Lord's
prayer, "Give us daily bread." Concerning the manna it is said that it
bred worms when it was kept. Then they were to burn up what was left of
the paschal lamb; neither should they let anything from the sacrifices
remain over; also that the bread of faces should be replaced anew every
day. Thence it is evident why everyone is provided with spiritual daily
bread by the Lord, and that it is not given as their own, and thus there
should be no care concerning tomorrow, what they should eat and drink.
Thus and not otherwise are good spirits in their works, and in their
life and faith. Nothing is given to the evil, but only to him who is in
work. Thus also all are held in bonds, thus every use is remunerated.
\[Marginal Note:\] \[338\] Some are nourished at the tables of others,
but those who are evil and hateful sit at the table and do not see the
food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="346.">346.</span></span>

\[339\] MARRIAGE AND ADULTERY. (1) Adultery is hell itself, thus it is
the Devil himself and Satan. It has been shown by many things as also by
experience, that all in hell are adulterers, that they rage like furies
when they perceive conjugial love; which is a sign that they are from
hell; that they desire to violate chaste marriages, and many other
things; then that they are in the marriage of evil and falsity. (2)
Marriage is heaven itself because all there are in conjugial love,
everyone in his own degree. That love is the fundamental love of all the
loves of heaven, because an angel by it becomes love in form, because
they who are in marriage are in good and truth; and therefore heaven
cooperates in marriages and nuptials and hell in adulteries and
whoredoms. (3) Thence it follows that as far as a man detests adulteries
as a diabolic sin, and looks to the Lord, so far he is in a like degree
in heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="347.">347.</span></span>

\[340\] Marriage and adultery must be treated of especially, because he
who is in marriage is in the conjunction of good and truth but he who is
in adultery is in evil and falsity. And because adultery is all sin
against the Decalogue, for he who is in that is in all the evil of the
Decalogue and vice versa; and because these are involved and as it were
contained in marriage and adultery in summaries, therefore they must be
treated of especially. (2) At this day in the Christian world adulteries
are more prevalent than in any other religion, because they separate
good from truth or charity from faith; and when these are separated,
then from influx it cannot be otherwise. Therefore they confirm
adulteries and not marriages; and therefore it is not known what
conjugial love is, it must be shown how the faith of the present day
separates and thus falsifies the Word, then how it perverts man's
rational, thence adulteries are delightful, but not so marriages.

<span class="margnote"><span id="348.">348.</span></span>

\[341\] Adulteries are the worst of all abominations, because the seed
of man is his life which is conjoined with the life of the wife, so that
they are not two but one flesh; but when the lives of many men are
immitted into one woman, there becomes such foulness that on account of
the abomination it cannot be described, it becomes such before the
angels. <span id="fr_45"></span>[348-1](#fn_45.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="349.">349.</span></span>

\[342\] TO DO GOODS AND NOT TO FIGHT AGAINST EVILS IS TO DO GOODS FROM
SELF AND NOT FROM THE LORD. It is believed by many that they will be
saved because they have done goods, as that they have given to the poor,
benefitted their neighbor, acted sincerely and justly in their duty and
work, and yet have never fought against the evils opposed to their
goods; believing that thus evils are removed. It appears to them,
moreover, as if goods removed evils; saying in heart, "If I do good then
I shall avoid evil." Nevertheless the case is as follows: that such a
one does good from obedience to the precepts of the Lord, yet not from
the Lord but from himself, thus not from any spiritual law except only
apparently, but from a moral and civil law actually. In this case his
evils nevertheless remain; for although he does not do them, yet he is
not averse to them. Consequently when the love of evil with its delight
returns, he does not resist the evil, but either excuses it and does it,
or omits doing it on account of himself and the world; moreover, he does
not then know that it is evil. The case is otherwise when he fights
against evil from the spiritual law; for, insofar as he does this, he
censures evil, and he then loves good and its truth; and in proportion
as he does good from the Lord and not from himself, in the same
proportion the Lord, by the good and truth in the man, removes his
evils.

<span class="margnote"><span id="350.">350.</span></span>

\[343\] I have heard spirits saying, that they know no otherwise than
that to do good is to shun evil. But they receive for reply, that in
this case they no otherwise shun evil than that they do not do it; but
that nevertheless they do not hold evil in hatred, and reject it as sin,
unless as far as they have fought against it. By fighting against it
evil is removed, and then good succeeds, that is, by combat the devil is
removed and the Lord enters. To do good, and not to fight against evil,
is to do good only in externals and not in internals; but to fight
against evil and thus to do good, is to do good in internals. Man is not
made spiritual except by combat. Some of those who have been sincere,
just, chaste, and have not fought against what is insincere, unjust, and
unchaste, are after death let into combats, and then it clearly appears
how much they have done good from themselves, or on account of
themselves, or from the Lord; and by combats they are reformed.
