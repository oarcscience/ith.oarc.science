<p>Verse 7. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and there was given to him authority over every tribe and tongue and nation. 7. "And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them," signifies combat with those who are in truths from good, and who on account of appearances have not followed out the combinations (n. 802); "and there was given to him authority over every tribe and tongue and nation," signifies domination over all the truths and goods of the church, and over the doctrine of faith and love (n. 803). </p>

<p>Verse 7. And it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them, signifies combat with those who are in truths from good, and who on account of appearances have not followed out the combinations. This is evident from the signification of "war," as being spiritual combat, which is the combat of truth against falsity and of falsity against truth (see above, n. 573, 734); consequently "to make war" means to fight from truths against falsities and from falsities against truths, here from falsities against truths. Also from the signification of "saints," as being those who are in truths from good (see above, n. 204). Also from the signification of "overcoming them," as being to make them to be of their doctrine and thence of their religion; and as this is done by reasonings by which they induce upon falsities the appearance of truth, and by passages from the sense of the letter of the Word by which they confirm their reasonings, therefore these words also signify those who have not followed out, or have not understood, how faith can be conjoined with good works, because of the appearances of truth that have been induced upon falsities. From this it can be seen that "it was given unto the beast to make war with the saints and to overcome them" signifies combat with those who are in truths from good, and who on account of appearances have not followed out these combinations.  [2] The reasonings by means of which the defenders of faith separated from the life have induced upon falsities the appearance of truth, by which they have seemed to themselves to have cleared away the disagreements with the Word, have been treated of in several places before; but that they have not cleared away these disagreements, but have woven as it were an invisible spider's web, that they might induce a faith in falsities, can be seen from what has been presented above (n. 780, 781, 786, 790); also from this, that by doctrine, preaching, and writings, they assert and insist that faith was given as the means of salvation, because man is unable to do good of himself; also that God continues to operate whatever is good in man while man is unconscious of it, and by this operation the evils that are done by a man who is justified by faith are not sins but infirmities of nature; and that deliberate or voluntary evils are forgiven, either immediately or after some repentance of the mouth; and finally that it follows that by "works" and "doing," in the Word, faith and to have faith are meant.  [3] This is their web by which they induce the simple to believe that out of the treasures of wisdom or interior perception, that are stored up only with the teachers and the learned, they have brought forth clear evidences to establish the doctrine of faith separated from any manifest endeavor of man (which is the will) to do what is good. Thus for themselves and all the people of the church they give license and free rein to acting and living according to the bent and trend of all lusts; and as this dogma is pleasing to the flesh and to the eyes, the common crowd gladly receive it. This, therefore, is what is here signified by "it was given to the beast to make war with the saints and to overcome them." But lest the leaders of the church, who are initiated into this dogma when they are initiated into the priesthood, and from them the people of the church, should be infected by the poison drawn from these crafty reasonings, from which they cannot but die, I will take up again the arguments just mentioned respecting the separation of faith from the goods to be done by man, also the conjunctions fallaciously contrived, by which they proceed from something to nothing, or from truth to falsity, and I will present to the light before the understanding in any degree enlightened, the detestable falsities of evil and evils of falsity that are contained in that more than heretical dogma, and that gush forth from it in a constant stream. [4] First, "That faith was given as the means of salvation, because man is unable to do good of himself." That man is unable to do good of himself is true; and as man is unable to have any faith of himself it follows that as he is not able to do anything from himself, so is he not able to believe anything of himself. For what man of the church does not acknowledge that faith is from God and not from man? Therefore altogether similar things must he said of faith as is said of works. Of works it is said, that in case they are from man, and while they are from man, they do not justify. It must be similar with faith in case it is from man and while it is from man. And yet everyone believes from himself, for he evidently thinks and wishes to think in himself as if from himself that which belongs to faith. Therefore if the same is true of faith as of works, it follows that the elect only can have faith and be saved; and this implies predestination, from which with the evil flow all kinds of security of life, and with the good deprivation of all hope from which comes despair; and yet all are predestined for heaven, and those are called the elect who learn truths and do them. Again, since the same is true of faith and of good works, it follows that man cannot act and should not act otherwise than as an automaton, or as a thing that has no life, waiting to be moved by influx from God, and thus go on thinking nothing and willing nothing that is commanded in the Word; and yet such a man is continually willing and thinking something from himself. But as that which is from oneself is not from God but from hell, and yet to think and will from hell is against God, and two opposites cannot exist together, such a man is either foolish or an atheist. If anyone after this shall say that because faith is given to be the means of salvation it can be received by man as of himself he will say what is true; but to have faith, that is, to think that a thing is so and from that to speak as of oneself, and yet to be unable to will a thing because it is so as of oneself, is to annihilate faith; for one without the other is a nonentity. But if anyone shall say that justifying faith is simply to believe that God the Father sent the Son, that by the passion of His cross He might effect propitiation, redemption, and salvation, and this does not involve anything to be done, also because it is imputation that saves, it follows (since there is no truth of heaven in such belief, as will be shown in its place) that a belief in falsity, which is a dead faith, justifies.      [5] Secondly, "That still God operates what is good with man, while man is unconscious of it." It is true that God operates what is good with man, and for the most part while man is unconscious of it, and yet God gives man the power to perceive the things that are necessary to salvation. For God operates that man may think and speak those things that belong to faith, and may will and do those things that belong to love; and when man thence thinks, speaks, wills, and does, he must needs think, speak, will, and do, as if of himself. God operates into those things in man that are from Himself with him; that is, into the truths that belong to faith and into the goods that belong to love; consequently when God presents the former in the understanding and the latter in the will they appear to man as if they were his own, and he brings them forth as his own. In no other way can anyone think and speak and will and act from God. It is enough for man to know and acknowledge that these things are from God. This Divine operation itself often takes place while man is unconscious of it, but the effects that come from it man is conscious of. This is the meaning of the words:      That man can receive nothing unless it be given him from heaven (John 3:27).      Jesus said, Without Me ye can do nothing (John 15:5). If man had no consciousness in thinking truths and in doing goods, that they might not become goods and truths from himself, he would be either like an animal or like a stock; and thus would be unable to think and will anything of God or anything from God, thus would not be able to be conjoined with God by faith and love and live to eternity. The difference between animals and men is that animals are unable to think and speak truths and to will and do goods from God, while men are able to do this, and thus to believe those things that they think, and to love those things that they will, and this as if of themselves. If it were not as if of themselves the Divine influx and operation would flow through and not be received, for man would be like a vessel without a bottom, which receives no water. Man's thought is the receptacle of truth, and his will the receptacle of good; and reception is not possible unless man is conscious of it. And if there is no reception there can be given no reciprocal, which makes that which is of God to be as if it were of man. Every agent that wills to conjoin himself with another must needs have something that is seemingly his own with which conjunction is effected, for otherwise there is no reagent; and where there is no action and at the same time reaction no conjunction is possible. The things in man with which God, who is the sole Agent, conjoins Himself, are the understanding and the will. These faculties are man's; and although when they act they act from God, they cannot act otherwise than as if of themselves. From this it now follows that truths and goods that do not so act are not anything. But this shall be illustrated by examples. It is commanded in the Word that man must not commit adultery, must not steal, must not kill, must not bear false witness. It is known that man is able to do all these things of himself, also that he is able to refrain from them because they are sins; and yet he is not able to refrain from them from himself, but only from God; yet when he refrains from them from God he still thinks that he wills to refrain from them because they are sins, and thus he refrains from them as if from himself; and when this is done, then because he calls adultery a sin he lives in chastity and loves chastity, and this as if of himself; and because he calls theft a sin he lives sincerely and loves sincerity, and this also as if of himself. When he calls murder a sin he lives in charity and loves charity, and this as if of himself. When he calls false testimony a sin he lives in truth and justice and loves truth and justice, and this as if of himself. And although he lives and loves these as if of himself, yet he lives and loves them from God; for whatever a man does from chastity itself, from sincerity itself, from charity itself, and from truth itself and justice itself, as if of himself, he does from God, and consequently they are goods. In a word, all things whatever that a man does from these principles as if from himself, these, when evils are removed, are from God and are goods. But all things that a man does before evils are removed, although they are works of chastity, works of sincerity, works of charity, or works of truth and justice, are not goods, because they are from man. Since all works, both those that are done from God and those that are not done from God, must needs be carried on by man or as if by him, it is evident why "works," "deeds," "working," and "doing," are so frequently mentioned in the Word, which would never have been so mentioned and commanded if they were done by God without man's knowledge, as is taught in the interior meaning of the doctrine of those who separate faith from good works.      [6] Thirdly, "That the evils that a man does who is justified by faith are not sins but infirmities of his nature; and that voluntary or deliberate evils are forgiven, either immediately or after some repentance of the mouth." This is the profession of those who have inwardly examined and entered into the mysteries of the separation of faith from good works, with a difference with some according to the keenness of their ability to reason and draw conclusions. This, indeed, necessarily follows. For those who ascribe everything of salvation to faith alone, and ascribe nothing of salvation to good works, say that they are in grace, and some that they are in God; and if in grace they conclude that evils are not seen, and if they are seen that they are immediately forgiven; if in God they conclude that nothing condemns them, thus that their evils are not sins, since sins condemn, but are infirmities of nature. And as evils from the will, which are called in the Word "sinning with a high hand," are not infirmities of nature, they say that they are forgiven, either immediately or after some repentance of the mouth, since he who has been justified by faith is in good and has no need of repentance of life; and some add, because these evils are done by permission. Again, this follows as a consequence from the belief that he who is justified by faith is redeemed, purified before God, and regenerated; and since he cannot do good of himself, that the merit of the Lord is ascribed and imputed to him, and by virtue of this imputation, together with redemption and regeneration, he is adopted as a son of God, and is led by God the Father, and enlightened by the Holy Spirit; consequently his works are accepted, and his evils are not evils like evils with others; and as they do not condemn they cannot be called sins, but infirmities, such as cling to everyone as an inheritance from Adam, and which, as soon as they come forth, are forgiven and cast out. These and various other opinions they assert, according to their ideas about the essence of faith, and its separation from the goods of life, or the conjunction of faith with those goods. But to investigate all these particulars is not necessary, for they are all streams from a false principle, from which nothing but falsities can flow forth in a continual series. Who does not know and acknowledge, when he thinks by himself, that man should examine himself, confess his sins before God, abominate them, and afterwards lead a new life, that he may inherit life eternal? This is taught in the appointed prayers in the churches, especially in those preparatory to observing the sacrament of the Supper; this is taught in the Word, and in all preachings from the Word; and reason that is at all enlightened declares it. And yet the light of this truth is extinguished as soon as anyone studies the arcana of this doctrine, and desires to gain a reputation for learning therefrom; for being led by the love of self and thence by the pride of self-intelligence, he departs from the faith of the common people, and embraces the falsity that destroys every truth of the Word and every truth of heaven. And as he is believed to be learned he draws after him and misleads many; and thus the sheep that he ought to gather he scatters, by teaching that he who is able to think and declare with confidence that Christ suffered for him, and thereby redeemed him, is condemned by no evil. But that there is nothing of life in such a faith will be seen in what follows. Such are not unlike those who from fantasy have visions, and who believe the men whom they see to be specters, and when they see phantoms believe them to be men, thus they see truths as falsities and falsities as truths, especially when the fantasy arising from the lumen of their infatuation is skillful in forming by means of fallacies images conformable to their lumen. In the delirium of their arcana they see wisdom, not knowing that those who know nothing about these things have after their life in this world a better lot.      [7] Fourthly, "That by "works" and "doing" in the Word, faith and to have faith are meant." The wish of such is to persuade others by these means that they are verifying all things of the Word, when in fact they are falsifying all things of it, for this conclusion is both a contradiction and a false statement. It is a contradiction to say that doing goods means to have faith, when nevertheless the received faith not only separates good works but also excludes them from the means of salvation; and that which is separated and excluded from anything (thus from the faith which is said not only to be something but also everything), cannot possibly exist in it, and thus cannot be meant by it. It is also a contradiction to say that that which is saving and spiritual which is said to belong to faith-means at the same time that which is not saving and not spiritual; for they call faith saving and spiritual, but they call works not saving and so not spiritual. It is a false statement to say that the Divine operation, without any co-operation by man, is meant by "works" and "doing" in the Word when yet man is commanded to do these. It is also a false statement to say that "good works" mean the faith that is received and is called saving, when yet that faith is of the thought alone and not at all of the will. Furthermore they say that "works" and "deeds" are mentioned in the Word on account of the simple who do not grasp the arcana of faith. But it is to be noted that it is one thing to believe a person and another thing to believe in him; as to believe that there is a God and to believe in Him. To believe in God or in His name signifies both to do and to have faith, as in John:      As many as received Him, to them gave He power to become sons of God, to them that believe in His name; who were born, not of bloods nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man (vir), but of God (1:12, 13). Those born "not of bloods" are those who do not falsify the Word; those born "not of the will of the flesh" are those who are not in lusts from love of self; those born "not of the will of man" are those who are not in falsities from the pride of self-intelligence; those "born of God" are those who are regenerated by the Lord by means of truths from the Word and a life according to them; these are they who believe in the name of the Lord, and thence are called "sons of God." Such a faith is not the faith of the teachers of the church at this day. </p>

<p>And there was given to him authority over every tribe and tongue and nation, signifies domination over all the truths and goods of the church, and over the doctrine of faith and love. This is evident from the signification of "authority," as being domination; also from the signification of "tribe," as being the truths and goods of the church in general (see above, n. 39, 330, 430, 431, 454, 657). Also from the signification of "tongue," as being the doctrine of the church, also confession and religion (see above, n. 330, 455, 625, 657), here the doctrine of faith; also from the signification of "nation," as being the good of love, likewise the doctrine of love, and thence of the church (see above, n. 175, 331, 625, 657). From this it can be seen that "authority was given to the beast over every tribe and tongue and nation" signifies domination over all the truths and goods of the church, and over the doctrine of faith and love. And as "the beast" signifies faith separated from the life, corroborated and established by reasonings from the natural man, it follows that to such a faith domination is given over all things of the church and its doctrine. It is evident that domination was given to this faith, since faith alone is the universal prevailing principle in the churches; for it has been taken to be the essential means of salvation, as is clearly evident from the doctrines of the churches, as well as from the verbal profession of the men of the church, and in general from their lives; also from this, that they do not know what charity and love are, consequently what works are. And as such is the domination of faith separate, so it has domination over all the truths and goods of the church, and extinguishes them by falsifying, perverting, and adulterating them; for where that faith rules there is no longer anything good, and thence no truth.  [2] It is known that faith from love is the essential means of salvation, and thus is the principle of the doctrine of the church; but since it is important to know how a man can be in such enlightenment as to learn the truths that must constitute his faith and in such affection as to do the goods that must constitute his love, and thus can know whether his faith is a belief in truth and his love a love of good, this shall be told in its proper order, as follows: (1) Let him read the Word every day, one or two chapters, and learn from a master and from preachings the dogmas of his religion; and especially let him learn that God is one, and that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth (John 3:35; 17:2; Matt. 11:27; 28:18), that the Word is holy, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that there is a life after death. (2) Let him learn from the Word, from a master, and from preachings, what works are sins, and that they are especially adulteries, thefts, murders, false witness, and the others mentioned in the Decalogue; likewise that lascivious and obscene thoughts are also adulteries, that frauds and illicit gains are also thefts, that hatred and revenge are also murders, and that lies and blasphemies are also false witness; and so on. Let him learn all these things from childhood to youth. (3) When man begins to think for himself, which is the case after he has grown up, it must be to him the first and chief thing to refrain from doing evils for the reason that they are sins against the Word, thus against God, and for the reason that if he does them he will gain, not life eternal, but hell; and afterwards as he grows up and becomes old he must shun them as damned, and must turn away from them in thought and intention. But in order to so refrain from them and shun and turn away from them, he must pray to the Lord for help. The sins he must refrain from and must shun and turn away from are chiefly adulteries, frauds, illicit gains, hatreds, revenges, lies, blasphemies, and elation of mind. (4) So far as man detests these evils because they are opposed to the Word, and thence opposed to God, so far there is granted him communication with the Lord, and conjunction is effected with heaven. For the Lord enters, and with the Lord heaven enters, as sins are removed; since these and their falsities are the sole hindrances. The reason is because man has been placed in the midst between heaven and hell, wherefore hell acts from the one side, and heaven from the other; therefore so far as evils that are from hell are removed, so far goods from heaven enter; for the Lord says:      Behold I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hear and open the door, I will come in to him (Rev. 3:20).  But if man refrains from doing these evils for any other reason than because they are sins, and are opposed to the Word and because thence to God, no conjunction of heaven with him is effected, because his refraining is from self, and not from the Lord. The Lord is in the Word, even so that He is called the Word (John 1:1-4), because the Word is from Him; consequently the conjunction of heaven with the man of the church is by means of the Word, as may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 303-310). (5) So far, then, as man detests these sins so far good affections enter. Then so far as he detests adulteries so far chastity enters; so far as he detests frauds and unlawful gains so far sincerity and justice enter; so far as he detests hatred and revenge so far charity enters; so far as he detests lies and blasphemies so far truth enters; and so far as he detests elation of mind so far humility before God and love of the neighbor as oneself enter; and so on. From this it follows that to shun evils is to do goods. (6) So far as a man is in these good affections he is led by the Lord and not by self; and so far as he acts from them so far he does what is good, because he does this from the Lord and not from self; and then he acts from chastity, from sincerity and justice, from charity, from truth, in humility before God; and from these no one can act from self. (7) The spiritual affections that are granted by the Lord to him who is in them and who acts from them, are the affection of knowing and understanding the truths and goods of heaven and the church, together with the affection of willing and doing them; also the affection of combating with zeal against falsities and evils and dispersing them, both with himself and with others. From this man has faith and love, and from this he has intelligence and wisdom. (8) Thus and in no other way is man reformed; and so far as he knows and believes truths, and wills and does them, so far is he regenerated, and from natural becomes spiritual. The like is true of his faith and his love. [3] If evils have not been removed because they are sins nothing that a man thinks, speaks, wills, and does, is good or true before God, however it may appear as if good and true before the world. The reason is that they are not from the Lord but from man, since it is the love of the man and of the world from which they are, and which is in them. Most people at this day believe that they will come into heaven if they have faith, live piously, and do goods; and yet they do not turn away from evils because they are sins, consequently they either do them or believe them to be allowable; and those who believe them to be allowable do them when opportunity is given. But let them know that their faith is not faith, that their pious things are not pious, and that their goods are not goods; for they flow from the impurities that lie inwardly concealed with man; and externals derive everything that they are from internals. For the Lord says:      Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside may become clean also (Matt. 22:26).  From this it can now be seen that if a man were able to fulfill all things of the law, if he should give much to the poor, if he should do good to the fatherless and the widow, and if he should also give bread to the hungry and drink to the thirsty, take in the strangers, clothe the naked, visit the sick, and go to them that are bound in prison, if he should earnestly preach the Gospel, convert the Gentiles, frequent temples, listen devoutly to preachings, observe the sacrament of the Supper often every year, spend his time in prayer, and other things; and his internal has not been purified from hatred and revenge, from craftiness and malice, from insincerity and injustice, from the filthy delight of adultery, from the love of self and the consequent love of rule, and the pride of self-intelligence, from contempt of others in comparison with oneself, and from the other evils and their falsities; still all these works would be hypocritical and from the man himself, and not from the Lord. And yet these same works, when the internal has been purified, are all good, because they are from the Lord with man, and since the man is in the faith and in the love of doing these works he will do them as a matter of course. This has been proved to me by a thousand examples in the spiritual world. I have there heard that it has been granted to many to recall the actions of their life in the world, and to enumerate the goods they had done; but when their internal was opened it was found to be full of every evil and the falsity therefrom; and it was then disclosed to them that the goods they had enumerated had been done from self, because for the sake of self and the world, and that they were full of evils from their interiors; and on this account they appeared either as if scorched with fire, or as if sooty.  [4] But it was otherwise with those who from the Word had abstained from doing evils, and had afterwards shunned them and turned away from them because they were sins and were opposed to love to God and to charity towards the neighbor. Although there was a similar perception to them that their works were done as if from self, yet they were all good, and appeared in the light of heaven like white snow and wool (Isaiah 1:12-18). These are the works that are meant in the Word by the works that can in no wise be separated from faith; for faith separated from them is dead, and a dead faith is a faith in falsity from an evil love; or it is the thought that a thing is true, while the life is still evil.      That abstaining from evils for any reason whatever except from the Word does not purify the internal man is evident from the origin of evil works and from the origin of good works. For example, he that abstains from adulteries from fear of the civil law and its punishments, from fear of the loss of reputation and thus of honor, from fear of deprivations arising from poverty, parsimony, or avarice, from fear of consequent illness, from fear of brawls at home with the wife and the consequent intranquility of life, from fear of chastisement by the servants of the injured husband, from infirmity arising from abuse, or age, or impotence, or even from natural goodness and consequent moral goodness, that is, as not being proper and honorable, and so on, and if for such reasons only he lives chastely still he is interiorly unchaste and an adulterer, so long as he does not abstain from these evils from spiritual faith, which is a belief that adulteries are infernal because they are contrary to the Divine Law, and thus contrary to the fear of God and to love of the neighbor. And so in all other cases. [5] From what has now been presented it can be seen what the internal and the external are, also what faith and love are, namely, that faith and love are with man when his internal has been purified from evils in the manner just described, and that they are not in him if it be not purified, and that where faith and love are, there is heaven, and where faith and love are not, there is hell. More on this may be seen hereafter (n. 825). </p>

<p>Verses 8, 9. And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. If anyone hath an ear let him hear. 8. "And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him," signifies the necessity of acknowledgment by those who have been born within the church (n. 805); "whose names are not written in the book of life," signifies by all who have not become spiritual by regeneration by the Lord (n. 806); "slain from the foundation of the world," signifies whose Divine in His Human has not been acknowledged from the first establishment of this church (n. 807). 9. "If anyone hath an ear let him hear," signifies reception by those who are in the understanding of truth and the consequent perception of good (n. 808). </p>

<p>Verse 8. And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, signifies the necessity of acknowledgment by those who have been born within the church. This is evident from the signification of "worshipping," as being to acknowledge and believe that a thing is true, and thence to receive it in doctrine and worship. That this is the signification of "worshiping" can be seen from what has been said above (n. 789, 790), where what is signified by "they worshipped the dragon which gave authority unto the beast, and they worshipped the beast" is explained. That they acknowledge from necessity is evident from what has been said and shown in the preceding article. The above is evident also from the signification of "those that dwell on the earth," as being those who have been born within the church; for "the earth" signifies the church, and "those who dwell upon it" signify those who are there and live there. Those that have been born within the church are meant, because everyone adopts the religion of his native land, in the first place because be is educated in it, and is afterwards confirmed in it by preachings, and particularly because there are but few who study the doctrine of the church and the interior meaning of the Word, believing that such things transcend their comprehension, and also that they are not to be seen or understood, but only to be believed. This is the reason for the necessity of acknowledgment by those who have been born within the church, which is signified by "all that dwell on the earth shall worship the beast."  [2] That this is so can be seen, in the first place, from the received faith which is called the only saving faith, "That God the Father sent His Son into the world, that through the passion of His cross He might effect propitiation, redemption, and salvation." This faith if understood according to the ideas of those who defend faith separate from life, and thence according to preachings from their doctrine, is no faith; as is evident from each and every thing that is contained in that faith and that follows as a consequence from it; and these are: (1) That there is propitiation, that is, a propitiation of God the Father by the passion or by the blood of His Son. (2) That there is mercy or compassion of God the Father for the Son's sake. (3) That there was a bearing of our iniquities by the Lord, and a consequent deliverance from them. (4) That there is an imputative principle, and thus an imputation of the Lord's merit, through which we are saved. (5) That there is an intercession of the Lord with the Father. (6) That there is redemption and salvation without the means of life and faith, and thus there is immediate mercy. (7) That in such a faith there is no religion, but it is emptiness and vacuity. (8) That there is in it neither any faith in the Lord, nor any acknowledgment of His Divine in His Human. (9) That consequently the trust and confidence of that faith which at this day is received as the only saving faith is an empty sound. (10) That saving faith is wholly different. But since it is on the lips of nearly all who are of the church that the Lord endured the cross for our sins, and that He took them upon Himself and bore them, and thereby not only reconciled the Father but also redeemed us from hell, and that by this merit of the Lord we are saved, provided we believe this in trust and confidence-it is necessary to inquire, in the first place, whether these things should be understood according to the common opinion.      (1) [3] In respect to the first proposition, "That there is propitiation, that is, a propitiation of God the Father by the passion or by the blood of His Son." This involves a rejection or alienation of the human race because of some anger or vengeance, that is called vindictive justice, which was laid upon His Son by God the Father, to the end that by the passion of His cross He might be reconciled to the human race, and thus be propitiated. But who does not see that for God the Father to reject from Himself the human race, or from justice to revenge their alienation, is contrary to the Divine essence itself, which is love itself, mercy itself, and goodness itself? Such vengeance, indeed, could not exist in any angel, and scarcely with any well disposed man, much less with God. Who does not also see that it is difficult to think that such vengeance was laid upon the Son by His Father, or that the Son took such vengeance upon Himself, and that God the Father has mercy from seeing or recalling this, and not from the Divine love itself, which in its essence is infinite, eternal, and immediate towards the whole human race? I do not know, therefore, whether anyone can think from God and with God that he has been rejected of God, and therefore that by the will of the Father the Son was condemned, and was thereby made a propitiatory and a throne of grace. Moreover, justice is a Divine attribute, but not vindictive justice, and still less can it be in one on another's account; and if it is not justice neither is it according to Divine order for one to be saved on another's account, though it may be by means of another. Nor can God be reconciled by any other means than by the repentance of the man himself. To be saved by means of the Lord, and also by means of the passion of His cross, thus by the Lord, is propitiation and expiation, as will be seen in what follows.      (2) [4] "There is no mercy or compassion of God the Father for the Son's sake." The customary prayer in the churches, and by the men of the church at home and abroad, when they are in pious worship is, "May God the Father have mercy upon us for the sake of the Son, and for the sake of the passion of His cross." This prayer flows from the accepted belief respecting the propitiation or reconciliation of the Father by the Son, as mentioned just above; likewise from the doctrine of the church respecting justification by faith alone without good works. And as the defenders and vindicators of that doctrine separate the life which is of good works from faith, they could acknowledge nothing else as a saving faith than that God the Father sent His Son, and that He is moved to mercy by the passion of His cross; and for this reason this prayer is at this day accepted by the general body as the only voice that can enter heaven and move God even if man utters it with a confession of trust only at the hour of death. And yet that such a prayer has in it nothing of life from truth and good, can be seen from what has been said just above respecting propitiation and reconciliation, and thence the mercy of the Father; also from what will be said presently respecting the bearing of our iniquities by the Lord, respecting the imputation of His merit, respecting intercession, and respecting redemption and salvation apart from life as a means. Here let it be said merely that it is never granted to any man of the church to approach God the Father immediately, and to pray to Him for the Son's sake; for it is the Lord who must be approached and prayed to, since no one comes to the Father except by the Lord and in the Lord; and the Lord equally as the Father is God, infinite, eternal, uncreate, omnipotent, and neither of them is first nor last, nor greater nor less, but they are altogether equal. That no one comes to the Father except by the Lord He teaches in John:      No one hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath brought Him forth to view (1:18).  In the same:      Ye have never heard the Father's voice nor seen His form (John 5:37).  In Matthew:      No one knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son willeth to reveal Him (11:27).  In John:      No one hath seen the Father save He who is with the Father,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_408"></A><A HREF="#fn_408"><FONT SIZE="1">805-1</FONT></A> He hath seen the Father (6:46).  In the same:      I am the Way, the Truth and the Life; no one cometh unto the Father but through Me (John 14:6).  No one cometh to the Father except in the Lord, is because the Father and He are one, as He also teaches in John:      If ye know Me ye know My Father also; he that seeth Me seeth the Father. Philip, believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? Believe Me, that I am in the Father and the Father in Me (14:7, 10, 11).  In the same:      The Father and I are one. That ye may know and believe that I am in the Father and the Father in Me (John 10:30, 38).  Add to this:      That the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, as He Himself teaches (John 3:35; 17:2; Matt. 11:27; 28:18); and that thus He must be approached. It is also to be known, that unless the Lord is approached man is unable to think with the angels, because all angelic thought about God is about God-Man. Angels are unable to think otherwise about God, and consequently about things Divine, because their thoughts go forth into every part of heaven; and heaven is heaven in the form of a man. But on this more elsewhere.      (3) [5] "There was no bearing of our iniquities by the Lord, and a consequent deliverance from them," as is taught by the common faith, which is, that the Lord took upon Himself the sins of the world and cast them into hell, and thus took them away. This they conclude from the words of John respecting Jesus:      Behold the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world (John 1:29); also from Isaiah, where the Lord is treated of:      He hath borne our sicknesses and sorrows, and He hath carried our iniquities (53:4, 11).  But what is signified by "carrying iniquities" has not yet been understood in the churches; therefore it shall be told. It was according to Divine order for the prophets to represent the state of their church, that its quality might thus be known, as can be seen from the following. Isaiah was commanded:      To go naked and barefoot three years, for a sign and a wonder (Isa. 20:2, 3). In this way he represented that there were no longer any truths in the church; for this is signified by "going naked and barefoot." Hosea was commanded:      To take to himself a woman of whoredoms, and children of whoredoms, because the land had committed whoredom (Hos. 1:2, seq.).  "A woman of whoredoms" signified a church that falsifies the truths of the Word. Also Ezekiel was commanded:      To take to himself a tile and to portray upon it Jerusalem, and to lay siege against it; and to lie upon his left side three hundred and ninety days, and afterwards upon his right side forty days. Also he was commanded to eat a cake of barley made with cow's dung; and it was said that so shall they be in want of bread and water in Jerusalem and shall pine away for their iniquity (Ezek. 4:1 to the end).  This signified that the church was without goods and truths, and in mere falsities from evil; and it is said:      That thereby he should bear the iniquity of the house of Israel (Ezek. 4:5). Yet he did not thereby take away their iniquities, but only represented them; and this because a "prophet" signified doctrine from the Word, thus the church in respect to doctrine and worship therefrom. The like is meant by "bearing iniquities" where these words are applied to the Lord, who was the greatest Prophet, for He represented in Himself how the Jewish Church treated with contumely the Divine truth or the Word, for He was Himself the Word; therefore their scourging Him, spitting in His face, smiting Him with a reed, setting a crown of thorns upon Him, giving Him vinegar to drink, dividing His garments, and finally crucifying Him, were all representative of the state of that church (see above n. 83, 195, 627, 655). This, therefore, is signified by "bearing iniquities;" and in like manner also by His enduring temptations more grievous than those of all others. And yet to transfer to Himself the sins of others, and to take them away by sorrows and punishments admitted in Himself is contrary to the nature of the annulling of sins. For sins can be annulled only by repentance of life by him who has sinned. To take them away by drawing them from another upon oneself is a dogma of the Papists in which there is no truth.      (4) [6] "There can be no imputation, and thus no imputation of the Lord's merit." This cannot be because salvation by imputation is contrary to the laws of Divine order set forth in the Word; which are that man must learn what the sin is that he must shun, and what the truth is that he must do; and if he lives contrary to truths he must repent. These laws, with each and every thing that the doctrines of the churches teach from the Word, would be more than superfluous if man were saved by declaring with the confidence of faith that God has mercy on him for the sake of His Son and through the passion of His cross; and that thus the merit of the Lord would be imputed to him. For thus man might live wickedly, might commit adulteries, steal, act fraudulently, exercise hatred and revenge, calumniate, and other things, since be could not be saved by good works, but only by a faith that is wholly apart from any life. And yet it is blasphemy to say that a man can live wickedly and yet live from the Lord. It is likewise a contradiction that man must shun evils and do goods, and yet can be saved by mere faith in an imputed merit. The merit of the Lord is that from His own power He subjugated the hells and glorified His Human; by this He acquired for Himself the power to save all who believe in Him and who do what He taught. This merit cannot be attributed or imputed to anyone, still less can this be done by the Father, since it is the Lord's own merit; and salvation also is by the Lord, thus through the Lord, and not for the Lord's sake. In a word, no one's merit can be attributed to another unless he is a sharer with him through his life, according to which everyone is rewarded or punished; but life is from the Lord; this follows from His merit. Moreover, anything imputative is contrary to the essence of Divine love, which extends to all; for to impute means to love one and not another except for the sake of the one; it is also contrary to justice, which requires that everyone should have reward to the extent that he lives from the Lord.      (5) [7] "That there is intercession of the Lord with the Father" falls indeed into the ideas of men who are wholly simple, who think of the three Persons of the Divinity only as three sitting and talking together about what is to be, and that one moves the other to be merciful for His sake, which is to intercede. But the more learned see that intercession means a perpetual remembrance from love, since the one Person has the same essence or substance as the other, and the same love, thus the same mercy; and this cannot be excited or recalled to memory by any entreaty.      (6) [8] "That there is redemption and salvation without the means of life and faith, and thus there is immediate mercy." It is known that truths belong to faith, and goods to the life, and that without truths there can be no faith, as for example, without these truths: that there is a God, that the Lord is the Savior of the world, that there is a heaven and a hell, that there is a life after death, that the Word is holy, that the things that are in the Word must be believed and done, that the Holy Supper is the most holy thing of worship, and other like things; these must constitute faith; likewise that without goods there is no life of faith; for the Lord says:      He that heareth and doeth not is like a foolish man that buildeth his house upon the ground without foundation; but he that heareth and doeth is like a prudent man that buildeth his house upon a foundation from the rock (Matt. 7:24, 26).   These and like things, so far as they are to be believed, are means, and are said to belong to faith; and so far as they are to be done are means, and are said to belong to the life, without which man cannot be saved. All these things would be unmeaning, if in their place there were only this one thing which is called faith, namely, that man is saved by the mere mercy of the Father for the sake of the Son and by the imputation of His merit. That there is no such thing as immediate mercy, but mediate, and that yet man from pure mercy is led by the Lord from infancy to his old age, and afterwards to eternity, may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 521-527). Thus neither is there any immediate salvation. From this it follows that redemption consists solely in the Lord's redeeming from hell those who believe in Him, and who do what He has commanded; moreover, these, without His coming into the world, could not have been saved, since without His coming they could not have believed in Him, or have done what He has commanded, and thus have lived from Him. That these are those that are meant in the Word by "the redeemed" will be seen elsewhere.      (7) [9] "That in that faith there is no religion, but it is emptiness and vacuity." What is religion except that man may so live that he may come into heaven, and that he may know how he should live? To know this is called doctrine; and to believe it and live according to it is called religion. From doctrine man will know not only what must be thought but also what must be done; for man must think that he may do, but not think what involves doing nothing. The faith here described consists in thinking without doing, so that it may be called a mere cogitative (or thought) faith, while man implores mercy alone, because the Son of God suffered for him, and took upon Himself the sins of the world, and thus redeemed and delivered him from hell, believing at the same time that the merit of the Son of God is attributed to him. Let anyone who is willing and able consider whether there is in this anything of the Word, in which believing and doing are so often mentioned, consequently whether there is in this faith anything of the church or anything of religion. For in the things presented here, where are the truths that must constitute faith, and the goods that must constitute life, and that must make the genuine doctrine from the Word, and thus the theology of the Christian world? And as these things do not exist in that faith, it follows that it is not only a faith empty and void but also a faith in what is not true. It is a wonder to many in the spiritual world, and to all in heaven, that the theology of the Christian world has been reduced to such emptiness and vacuity that at length the whole of it is comprised in a mere utterance of thought that is possible also to the evil at the hour of death from a fear of hell. Thus the same emptiness that prevails with the Papists is found with very many of the Reformed in the Christian world. But let them consider, if they will, whether such as these can have any lot among the angels of heaven, whose intelligence is from the truths in the Word, and whose wisdom is from truths in act, which are called goods. This is what is meant by the Lord's words:      When the Son of man shall come will He find faith on the earth? (Luke 18:8).      (8) [10] "That there is in them neither any faith in the Lord nor any acknowledgment of the Divine in His Human." For he who prays to the Father to have mercy for the sake of His Son approaches the Father, and does not approach the Lord, when yet the Lord must be approached, for He is the God of heaven and earth; and the Word teaches that the Father cannot be approached except by the Lord and in the Lord, as has been shown above; also that faith must be in the Lord; for the Lord says:      He that believeth in the Son hath eternal life, but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the anger of God abideth on him (John 3:36). Likewise:      This is the will of the Father who sent Me, that everyone who seeth the Son and believeth in Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day (John 6:40).  And again:      Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in Me, though he die, yet shall he live; but everyone that liveth and believeth in Me shall not die forever (11:25, 26); and elsewhere. To believe in Him and not to approach Him, but to entreat the Father for His sake, is not to believe in Him; for all faith approaches Him in whom man believes; therefore to approach and see the Father was denied to Philip; and it was said:      That to see the Lord is to see the Father (John 14:7-11). Thence also all were healed of their diseases who prayed to the Lord to have mercy upon them, and who had faith in Him. And the sons of Israel also were saved in the wilderness who looked upon the brazen serpent, which represented the Lord as to the ultimate in His Human, which is called the sensual. Furthermore, in the spiritual world all sight and thought from acknowledgment conjoins; but sight directed to the Father conjoins no one; for the Lord says:      Ye have never heard the Father's voice nor seen His shape (John 5:37).  [11] Add to this that he who supplicates the Father to have mercy for the sake of the Son has no other idea of the Lord than as of an ordinary man; for he regards Him as beneath the Father, thus as a man from the mother Mary, who suffered the cross, and because of this there is mercy for man; thence the Lord's Divine is separated from His Human, although there is no such separation in the doctrine of the Nicene Council respecting the Trinity; for this teaches that the Divine and the Human of the Lord are not two but one Person, and that they are like the soul and body in man.  [12] But those who look to the Father, although they acknowledge the Lord's Divine yet do not approach it; for they place it near the Father above the Human of the Lord, and thus they see His Human apart from His Divine, although His Divine is His soul. This is why many at this time confess the Divine of the Lord with the mouth, while but few acknowledge it in heart; and he who does not acknowledge the Divine of the Lord in His Human, and does not look to that in his supplications, cannot have any conjunction with heaven. From this it follows that in this faith, namely, that the Father should have mercy for the sake of the Son, there is no faith in the Lord nor any acknowledgment of His Divine in His Human. This, moreover, is what the Lord foretold to Peter, that at the end of the church He would no longer be acknowledged.      (9) [13] "That consequently the trust and confidence of that faith, which is at this day accepted as the only saving faith, is an empty word." For the trust of that faith is a natural trust, in which there is nothing spiritual, since there is nothing in it of truth and good, which belong to faith and life; when, therefore, that faith is confirmed by the learned, the truth of heaven may be destroyed and man shut out of heaven by such confirmation. In such emptiness the faith alone that is accepted in the churches, or faith separated from goods of life, terminates; and yet this faith, although it is empty, fills the entire theology of the Christian world. For this reason the learned of the church, when they come after death into the spiritual world, are in so many falsities as scarcely to know a single genuine truth. But it is otherwise with those who have not confirmed these falsities with themselves, and have lived at the same time in some measure the life of faith, which is charity. These can be instructed in the truths of faith, and when they have been instructed can be received among the angels in heaven. For it is one thing to believe these falsities with a confirmed faith, thus with the heart, and a wholly different thing to believe them with a faith not confirmed.      (10) "That saving faith is wholly different" shall be treated of in what next follows. </p>

<p>Whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb, signifies by all who have not become spiritual through regeneration by the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "names," as being their quality; for in the Word "name" signifies the quality of a thing or a state, and for the reason that in the spiritual world persons do not have names as in the natural world, but everyone there is named according to his quality (see above, n. 676). Also from the signification of "written in the book of life of the Lamb," as being to be in love and faith in the Lord (see above, n. 199, 222, 299), thus also to become spiritual through regeneration by Him; for they who are in love and faith in the Lord from the Lord become spiritual, since their love and faith are spiritual; and they also are called regenerated, and are meant by those "whose names have been written in the book of life of the Lamb." From this it is clear that "names written in the book of life of the Lamb" means not that their names are there, but that their quality is such, namely, that they have become spiritual through regeneration by the Lord.  [2] It has been shown in the preceding article what&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_409"></A><A HREF="#fn_409"><FONT SIZE="1">806-1</FONT></A> the faith is that has been accepted by the general body in the church, namely, a belief that God the Father sent the Son, that through Him there might be propitiation, mercy, redemption, and salvation; likewise that the Son of God bore our iniquities, that He intercedes for us, and that His merit is attributed to those who pray for it from trust and confidence; and it has been shown in a former article that these are all vain expressions, in which as interpreted by the learned there is nothing of truth and thus nothing of salvation. That these are vain expressions in which there is nothing of truth is evident from the teachings of the Word respecting the reason of the Lord's coming and why He suffered, namely, that the Lord came into the world to save the human race, who otherwise would have perished in eternal death, and that He saved them by subjugating the hells, which infested every man coming into the world and going out of the world, and at the same time by glorifying His Human, since thus He is able to keep the hells subjugated to eternity. The subjugation of the hells, together with the glorification of His Human, was accomplished by means of temptations admitted into the human that He had from the mother, and by continual victories therein. His passion in Gethsemane and on the cross was the last temptation and complete victory.  [3] That the Lord came into the world for these two reasons, and that He thus saved the human race from eternal death, can be seen from this, that before the Lord's coming the hells were not in order, and consequently there was no equilibrium between hell and heaven, but hell on its part prevailed over heaven. And yet man has been placed in the midst between heaven and hell; in consequence of this whatever before the Lord's coming flowed into man out of heaven was taken away by hell, because of its superior power. Therefore to restore the destroyed equilibrium it pleased the Lord to come into the world, and to accomplish at that time a Last Judgment, and subjugate the hells; and by doing this the Lord acquired for Himself the power to save the men who have faith in and love to Him from Him. These things could be carried into effect only by the Lord's assuming a Human, for the reason that God works such effects from first principles by means of ultimates, since to work from first principles by means of ultimates is to work in fullness. The very might of the Divine power rests in things ultimate; so the Lord's might rests in His Human because that is in the ultimate. This was one reason of His coming into the world. The other reason was that He might glorify His Human, that is, make it Divine, since by this and by no other means is He able to keep the hells subjugated to eternity, for He thus acts to eternity from first principles by means of things ultimate, and in fullness. In this way His Divine operation reaches down even to those who are lowest in the world, while otherwise it would reach only to those who are first in heaven, and mediately through these and those that follow to the lowest, who are men; consequently if these should give way, as happened just before the Lord's coming, the Divine operation among men would cease, and consequently they would have no means of salvation. The Divine operation of the Lord through the Human assumed in the world is called His immediate influx even to those who are lowest.  [4] These are the two means whereby man has salvation, which is called redemption. This is called the redemption by His blood because the subjugation of the hells, together with the glorification of the Lord's Human, could be effected only by means of temptations admitted into Himself from the hells, the last of which temptations was the passion of the cross. From this it can now be seen that the Lord did not come into the world to propitiate the Father and to move Him to mercy, nor to bear our iniquities and thus take them away, nor that we might be saved by the imputation of His merit, or by intercession, or by immediate mercy, consequently not by a faith in these things, still less by the confidence of that faith, since that confidence confirms such things as are not true, thus such things as do not belong to faith. He who knows why the Lord came into the world, and knows that all who believe and do the things that He taught are saved by Him, and at the same time by the Father in Him, and not by the Father separated from Him, can see that many of the things that the leaders teach respecting redemption must be understood otherwise than according to their explanation of them.  [5] That the Lord subjugated the hells He taught when the passion of the cross was at hand, in John:      Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out (12:27, 28, 31).  In the same:      Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world (John 16:33). In Luke:      Jesus said, I beheld Satan as lightning falling from heaven (10:18). In Isaiah:      Who is this that cometh from Edom, walking in the multitude of his power? great to save; Mine arm brought salvation for Me; so He became their Savior (63:1, 5, 8; also 59:16-21). Because the Lord subjugated the hells He gave the seventy disciples:      Authority over demons (Luke 10:17, 19).  [6] That the Lord glorified His Human, and that the passion of the cross was the last temptation and complete victory by which He glorified it, He teaches in John:      When Judas was gone out Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God shall glorify Him in Himself, and straightway shall He glorify Him (13:31, 32).  In the same:      Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son that Thy Son also may glorify Thee (John 17:1, 5).  In the same:      Now is my soul troubled; Father, glorify Thy name. And there came a voice out of heaven, I have both glorified it and will glorify it again (John 12:27, 28).  And in Luke:      Ought not the Christ to suffer this and to enter into glory? (24:26).  This was said of His passion. "To glorify" is to make Divine. From this it can be seen that unless the Lord had come into the world and had become Man, and by this means had liberated from hell all those who believe in Him and love Him, no mortal could have been saved. Thus it is understood that without the Lord there is no salvation. This, now, is the mystery of the Lord's incarnation. </p>

<p>Slain from the foundation of the world, signifies whose Divine in His Human has not been acknowledged from the first establishment of this church. This is evident from the signification of "the Lamb slain or killed," as being not acknowledged (see above, n. 315, 328), here that His Divine in His Human has not been acknowledged (of which presently). Also from the signification of "the foundation of the world," as being the first establishment of the church. For "the world" signifies in the Word several things, namely, the world in general, also both those who are good and those who are evil in it, also the evil only who are in the world, and so also the hells. "The world" has also a similar signification as "the earth," namely, the church; and that is also here meant by "the foundation of the world," as also in Matthew:      The King shall say to them on the right hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world (25:34).  [2] The Lord is not acknowledged when His Divine in His Human is not acknowledged, for the reason that the Lord is not then regarded as God, but only as a man, who is not able to save. And although it is believed from the Athanasian Creed that the Lord is the Son of God born from eternity, and that His Divine is equal to the Divine of the Father, yet (since they separate His Human from His Divine) they divide the Lord as it were into two persons, which they call natures, making the Lord one thing as the Son of God from eternity, and another as the son of Mary. And because they so divide the Lord no one is able to approach Him unless he is willing to approach Him as one person when regarded as God and as another when regarded as man. Such has been the idea of the Lord from the first foundation of the church, as can be seen from the writings of the fathers, and afterwards from the writings of their sons. [3] The Lord has been thus divided in the church from its beginning, because they did not understand the Word. For where the Lord mentions the Father it is believed that a Divine distinct from His Human is meant, although it is clearly evident in Matthew and in Luke that the Lord was conceived by the very Divine which is called the Father, consequently that this very Divine is in His Human as a soul is in its body; and the soul and the body are one Person. And what is wonderful, this is taught in express terms in the Athanasian Creed, which is the doctrine concerning God in the whole Christian world, and yet scarcely anyone in that confession gives any heed to it. That no heed has been given to it has been made clear to me from conversations with many in the other life, both the learned and the unlearned, who have said that it was unknown to them, and that they had thought of the Son of God from eternity as a Divine Person above His Human, sitting at the Father's right hand. It was clear also that they had given no heed to those words of the Lord, that "the Father and He are One," and that "the Father is in Him and He in the Father." From this it can be seen that the church from its beginning has not acknowledged the Lord's Divine in His Human, and that this is what is signified by "the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world." </p>

<p>Verse 9. If anyone hath an ear let him hear, signifies the reception by those who are in the understanding of truth, and the consequent perception of good. This is evident from the signification of, "If anyone hath an ear let him hear," as being one who understands and hearkens to what the Lord teaches in the Word (see above, n. 108, 180, 255); thence these words signify also the reception of Divine truth by those who are in the understanding of it. Those who are in the perception of good are also meant, because "to have an ear and to hear" signifies both to understand truth and to perceive good; to understand truth pertains to thought, and to perceive good pertains to affection; and both pertain to the ear or to hearing, since what enters the ear passes into the sight of the understanding and also into the affection of the will; and for this reason the "ear" and "hearing" signify hearkening and obedience. So "to hear" anyone signifies to understand, and "to give ear to" anyone signifies to obey, and both are meant by "hearkening."  [2] As it has been shown above that in the faith received by the general body in the church there is mere emptiness, since there is nothing of life in it from any truth, I will here tell briefly what faith is saving faith. Saving faith is to believe that the Lord is the Savior of the world, and that He is the God of heaven and the God of the earth, and that by His coming into the world He entered into the power to save all who receive truths from Him through the Word, and who live according to them. Who those are that are able to receive truths from Him and to live according to them has been explained above (n. 803), namely, those who shun sins because they are sins against the Word and thus against God, since by so doing man's internal is purified, and when this is purified man is led by the Lord and not by self; and so far as man is led by the Lord he loves truths, and receives them and wills them and does them. This faith is saving faith.  [3] These words, "If anyone hath an ear let him hear" mean especially that it must be received and believed that the Divine of the Lord is in His Human, that is, that His Human is Divine. Is it not surprising that the idea of the Lord's Divine Human has been altogether destroyed in the Christian churches, especially among the learned there, and that only with the simple does anything of it remain? For the simple think of God as a Man, and not as a Spirit without a human form as the learned do. The most ancient people, who were wiser than those of our days, had no other idea of God than as a Man encompassed about the head with radiant circles, as is shown by the writings of ancient men, and by their paintings and sculptures. Moreover, all who were of the church from the time of Adam down to Abraham, Moses, and the prophets, thought of God as a Man. They also saw Him in a human form, and called Him Jehovah, as is evident from the Word; and God under a human form is the Lord, as is clear from the Lord's words in John:      Before Abraham was, I am (8:58).  [4] That the inhabitants of this earth from the primeval age had an idea of God-Man, or of the Divine Human, is evident from their idols, also from the ideas of such Gentiles as had interior thought and perception, like some of the Africans; likewise from the inhabitants of almost all the earths (as may be seen in a separate small work). Man has such an idea of the Divine because it flows in from heaven, for in heaven no one can think of God except in the human form. If he thinks otherwise his thought of God perishes, and he himself falls from heaven. This is because the human form is the form of heaven, and all the thought of angels proceeds according to the form of heaven. Yet this idea of God, which is the chief of all ideas, is with the learned of the world at this day rooted out, as it were to such an extent that when it is merely said that God is a Man they are unable to think of it.  [5] This is why, even from the first establishment of the church, they have separated the Divine of the Lord from His Human; and from this it has come to pass that few in thinking of the Lord think of His Divine, but they think of Him as a man like themselves. And yet with this idea of the Divine no one, whoever he may be, can enter heaven, but is repelled as soon as he touches the first threshold of the way that leads thither. This therefore, is what is especially meant by "If anyone hath an ear let him hear." </p>

<p>Verse 10. If anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity; if anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. 10. "If anyone shall lead into captivity be shall go into captivity," signifies that those who have shut out others from truths are shut out from the Divine truths in the Word (n. 810, 811); "if anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword," signifies that those who have imbued others with falsities are imbued with falsities from hell (n. 812). "Here is the patience and the faith of the saints," signifies that through these comes temptation and afterwards the implantation of truth with those who are made spiritual by the Lord  (n. 813). </p>

<p>Verse 10. If anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity, signifies that those who have shut out others from truths are shut out from the Divine truths in the Word. This is evident from the signification of "captivity," as being to shut out from truths, here by reasonings from the natural man, for this is the spiritual captivity that is meant by "captivity" in the internal sense. (That this is what is meant in the Word by "captivity" will be seen in the following article.) Thence it is clear that "to lead into captivity" signifies to shut out others from truths; and "to go into captivity" signifies to be also shut out from truths. Here "to lead into captivity" signifies to shut out others from truths by reasonings from the natural man, because "the beast of the dragon," which is here treated of, means those who separate faith from life, and confirm that separation by reasonings from the natural man (see above, n. 773).  [2] Before proving from the Word that "captivity" signifies spiritual captivity, which is a shutting out from truths from the Word, I will first take up what was considered above (in article n. 805), which those who separate faith from life confirm by reasonings, and thus shut out others from truths; and in this way I will exhibit to view how they pervert truths and thence falsify the Word. It is to be known that those who are in truths can say the same things as those who are not in truths; for the latter prove the separation of faith from good works by the same passages of the Word as are used by the former to prove the conjunction of faith with good works. For the same expression may be used by two persons who disagree, and yet the perception be different; and it is the perception of a thing that causes it to be true or false. I have heard lovers of falsities speak in quite a similar way as those who were anxious to speak truths, and yet the latter were in truths and the former were in falsities, since they understood in a different way the things they expressed in a similar way, and according to their understanding they explained the passages from the Word; consequently by the one such passages were falsified, and by the other verified. For the truth in man is not a matter of speech, but of his perception; and this is why those who attempt to preach from the Word appear to be in truths, and yet when the same preach from doctrine about faith alone, redemption, the imputation of the Lord's merit, and the like, they are in falsities. This may be illustrated by a thousand examples. In a word, it is the perception and not the speaking from the Word that falsifies. This is meant by these words of the Lord:      Then two men shall be in the field; one shall be taken, the other shall be left. Two women shall be grinding; one shall be taken, the other shall be left (Matt. 24:40, 41). To be "in the field" signifies to be within the church, "to grind" signifies to investigate and learn truths from the Word; and one who investigates and learns truths is meant by "the one grinding that is taken," while he who falsifies truths is meant by "the one grinding that is left." To illustrate this let us consider again how propitiation by the blood of the Son, the bearing of iniquities by the Lord, the imputation of His merit, intercession, redemption, and salvation out of mercy, also trust and confidence, and so on, are understood by such persons.  [3] As to propitiation by the blood of the Son, those who are in truths do not think about it as those do who are in falsities. Those who are in truths perceive by the propitiation by the blood of the Son that those who approach the Lord and pray to Him from the truths that are in the Word are received compassionately and are heard. "The Lord's blood" signifies not only the passion of His cross, but also the Divine truth of the Lord that is in the Word; for by the passion of the cross the Lord subjugated the hells; and this is meant by His "conquering death and rising victorious," as the leaders of the church say when they speak from the Word. By the passion of the cross the Lord also glorified His Human, and by this He keeps the hells forever subjugated. "The mercy-seat" that was over the ark of the Testimony, upon which cherubs were engraved, has the same signification. How those who are in truths understand the bearing of iniquities by the Lord has been shown above (n. 805).  [4] To those who are in truths the imputation of the Lord's merit means simply an entreaty to the Lord that He will have mercy (who endured such cruel sufferings in order to redeem and save men, who would otherwise have perished in eternal death). The Lord's merit means that by His own power He saved those who believe in Him, and who do what He has commanded. This merit cannot be imputed, but it can be prayed for. Intercession means the perpetual remembrance of man by the Lord. Trust and confidence mean trust and confidence in the Lord that out of pure mercy He will teach man the way and lead him to heaven. Thence it is also clear what is meant by redemption.  [5] From this it can now be seen that the things presented above (n. 805) do not mean, to those who are in truths from the Word, anything done by the Lord with the Father, but with Himself. For, as has been said above, God is one and not three, and the trinity is in the Lord; consequently when the Lord is approached the Father and the Holy Spirit are at the same time approached. From this it can also be seen that "to lead into captivity" signifies to shut out from Divine truths in the Word. For those who hold the doctrine of three persons in the Divinity, and who separate faith from its life, which is good works, shut out others from the understanding of truth in the Word. For they explain all things in it according to their doctrine; and what they cannot explain they falsify. Moreover, the Divine which is in the Lord, and which is of the Lord Himself, they ascribe to the Divine of the Father, and thus do not approach the Lord; and because they do this, either by reasonings or by an explanation of the truths of the Word foreign to them, they shut out from the truth the people who believe that everything that is said about Divine things is above human comprehension; this is signified by "leading into captivity." That they themselves "go into captivity," that is, shut themselves out from the Divine truths in the Word, is evident from all things of their doctrine, in that while the things they speak are true as to statement they are not true in the way they understand them. This, too, has been testified to me by the state of such in the spiritual world, where it was found, when they were examined, that they were in mere falsities, and consequently could never be brought by the Lord into any heavenly intelligence. </p>

<p>That "captivity" signifies in the Word spiritual captivity, which is a shutting out from Divine truths, that is, from the understanding of them in the Word, also destruction by the falsities of evil and by the evils of falsity, can be seen from passages in the Word where "captivity" is mentioned; as in the following. In Luke:      They shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive among all nations; and Jerusalem shall finally be trampled down (21:24). This chapter treats of the consummation of the age, which means the last time of the church, when there is no longer any truth remaining. "To fall by the edge of the sword" at that time signifies the destruction of truth by falsities; "sword" signifying the combat of falsity against truth, and also the destruction of truth by falsities. "They shall be led captive among all nations" signifies persuasions and thence obsessions by evils of every kind; for when truths have been destroyed not only do falsities succeed in their place, but evils also. "All nations" signify evils of every kind; "Jerusalem shall be trampled down" signifies a complete destruction and perversion of the doctrine of the church; "Jerusalem" signifying the church in respect to doctrine, and "to be trampled down" signifying to be wholly destroyed, which is done chiefly by falsifications and adulterations of the Word.  [2] In Ezekiel:      They shall be led captive among the nations, and the altars shall be laid waste, and the idols shall be broken, and the slain shall fall in the midst of you (6:1-10). "The altars being laid waste" signifies that all worship from the good of love shall perish; "the idols becoming broken" signifies that all worship from the truths of that good shall perish; and "the slain shall fall in the midst of you" signifies that they shall perish by falsities, "to be slain by the sword" signifying this.  [3] In Lamentations:      Hear, all ye people, and behold my grief; my virgins and my young men have gone into captivity (1:18). This is a lamentation over the devastation of all truth in the church; this lamentation is described by "Hear, all ye people, and behold my grief;" that all the affection of truth has been destroyed is signified by "my virgins have gone into captivity," a "virgin" signifying the affection of truth; and that all understanding of truth has been destroyed is signified by "my young men have gone into captivity," "young men" signifying the understanding of truth and intelligence.  [4] In Amos:      If they have gone into captivity before their adversaries, thence do I command the sword that it may slay them (9:4). "If they have gone into captivity before their adversaries" signifies, if they have suffered evils to take possession of them; "adversaries" meaning evils, and "to go into captivity" meaning to be possessed by them. "Thence do I command the sword that it may slay them" signifies that falsities will shut them out from the understanding of truths, and will destroy them.  [5] In David:      God abandoned the habitation of Shiloh, the tent He inhabited among men; and He gave His strength into captivity, and His splendor into the hand of the adversary (Ps. 78:60, 61).  "The habitation of Shiloh" signifies the church that is in the good of love, and the "tent" signifies the church that is in the truths of doctrine; thence it is clear what is signified by "God abandoned the habitation of Shiloh, the tent He inhabited among men," namely, that the goods of love and the truths of doctrine have been destroyed. The "strength" that He gave into captivity signifies spiritual truth from celestial good; and "to give into captivity" signifies to shut out from an understanding of it, and thus destruction by falsities; and the "splendor that He gave into the hand of the adversary" signifies natural truth from spiritual; this is signified by "splendor;" and its destruction by evils is signified by "being given into the hand of the adversary."  [6] In Ezekiel:      The prophet was commanded to remove out of the place, and to bring out the vessels of removal through the wall before their eyes, to bring them out in the darkness, and to cover his face that he see not the earth; and say, I am your prodigy; like as I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile, into captivity (12:1-12). By this the prophet represented the state of the church at that time, that there were no longer any truths remaining that had not been destroyed by falsities. For all the prophets represented the church in respect to doctrine from the Word. "To remove out of the place," and "to bring out the vessels of removal through the wall in darkness, and to cover his face that he see not the earth," represented that all the truths of doctrine from the Word had been cast out; "to remove out of the place" signifies rejection; "vessels of removal" signify the truths of doctrine; the "wall" through which he brought them out signifies the ultimate, which encompasses and defends truths (the ultimate of doctrine being the sense of the letter of the Word, which is called a "wall" because it contains and includes the spiritual sense); the "darkness" in which he was to bring them out signifies falsities; "to cover his face that he see not the earth" signifies that truths of good are no longer seen in the church. Because the prophet represented these things it is said, "like as I have done, so shall it be done to them; they shall go into exile and into captivity." Thence it is clear that "to go into exile" signifies the dispersion of truth, and "to go into captivity" signifies to be possessed by falsities.  [7] In Habakkuk:      I will raise up the Chaldeans, a nation that marcheth into the breadths of the land; it shall gather captivity like the sand; it shall mock at kings and rulers shall be a derision unto it (1:6, 9, 10). "The Chaldeans" signify those who destroy the truths of the church; "the breadths of the land" signify the truths of the church; that they will destroy all truths by falsities is signified by "it shall gather captivity like the sand;" that the truths and goods of the Word will be derided and blasphemed is signified by "that nation shall mock at kings, and rulers shall be a derision unto it," "kings" signifying the truths of the Word, and "rulers" its goods.  [8] In Jeremiah:      Nebuchadnezzar shall come and shall smite the land of Egypt, they who are for death to death, they who are for captivity to captivity, they who are for the sword to the sword; and I will kindle a fire in the houses of Egypt that he may burn them up, and carry them away captive; finally he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd arrayeth himself with his garment (43:11, 12). "Nebuchadnezzar," or "the king of Babylon," means in the Word those who destroy all things of the church by evils; and "the Chaldeans" those who destroy all things of the church by falsities; and in an abstract sense "the king of Babylon" signifies the evils that destroy, and "the Chaldeans" their falsities. "Nebuchadnezzar shall come and smite the land of Egypt" signifies the destruction of the natural man in respect to all goods and all truths thence from the Word; "they who are for death to death" signifies destruction by evils; "they who are for captivity to captivity" signifies destruction by shutting out from and deprivation of truth; "they who are for the sword to the sword" signifies destruction by falsities thence; "to kindle a fire in the houses of Egypt that he may burn them up, or carry them away captive," signifies that the loves of self and of the world will destroy all things of the natural man by evils and falsities; "fire" signifying those loves; "houses of Egypt" signify all things of the natural man; "to burn them up" signifies to destroy by evil loves, and "to carry them away captive" signifies to destroy by falsities thence. "Finally he shall array himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd arrayeth himself with his garment" signifies that the falsities of evil and the evils of falsity will possess the whole natural man. This is compared to the garment of a shepherd, because a "garment" signifies truth clothing good, but here falsity clothing evil; for the natural man is like a garment to the spiritual man, for it encompasses and includes it. [9] In Jeremiah:      They who are for death to death, they who are for famine to famine, and they who are for captivity to captivity (15:2). This describes the total vastation of good and truth in the church; for in the preceding verse it is said, "Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, My soul could not be towards this people; cast them out before My face, that they may go forth;" therefore "they who are for death to death" signifies that those who reject goods perish by evils; "they who are for famine to famine" signifies that those who reject truths perish by falsities; "they who are for captivity to captivity" signifies that those who love evils and falsities are taken possession of by them. [10] In Isaiah:      Like as My servant Isaiah hath gone naked and barefoot three years, so shall the king of Assyria lead the captivity of Egypt, and the crowd of Cush that is to be carried away, boys and old men, naked and barefoot, even the buttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt (20:3, 4). "The king of Assyria" signifies reasoning from the knowledges [scientifica] of the natural man; and "Egypt" signifies the natural man; so "the king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt" signifies that reasoning from falsities will destroy all the truths in the natural man, which are such as the truths of the sense of the letter of the Word. (The rest may be seen explained above, n. 532.)  [11] In Daniel:      Also their gods with their princes, with their vessels of desire, silver and gold, shall he carry captive into Egypt; and he shall stand more years than the king of the north. The intelligent of the people shall instruct many; yet they shall fall together by the sword and by flame and by captivity and by depredation, for days (11:8, 33). This treats of the war between the king of the north and the king of the south, "the king of the north" signifying falsity ruling in the church, and "the king of the south" truth defending the church against falsity; that nevertheless falsities will predominate in the church in the latter end of days is here foretold and described. "Their gods and their princes, and vessels of desire, and silver and gold, that shall be carried captive into Egypt," signify that the defending truth will take away all truths and goods of the church from those who are in falsities; its spiritual truths are signified by "their gods and princes," natural truths by "their vessels of desire," and all truth and good in general by "silver and gold," and the taking away and defense of these is signified by "carrying captive into Egypt." "To fall together by sword and flame" signifies to perish by falsities and evils therefrom; and "to fall together by captivity and depredation" signifies the deprivation of all things of truth and good.  [12] In Jeremiah:      When the prophet was given over to the prison he prophesied that all Judah should be carried away into captivity to Babylon, and should there die and be buried (20:1-6; 27:1 to the end). This "prophet," like "prophet" in general, signifies the doctrine of the church from the Word; his being "given over to the prison" represented that the like was done in respect to the church and its doctrine, which is signified by all Judah being carried away into captivity to Babylon. The captivity of the tribe of Judah in Babylon seventy years represented the complete destruction of truth and devastation of the church. [13] In the same:      The wind shall feed all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness (Jer. 22:22). "Shepherds" in an abstract sense signify the goods of the church, and "lovers" its truths; the "wind" that shall feed the shepherds signifies the hollowness and emptiness of doctrine; the "captivity" into which the lovers shall go signifies a shutting out from all truths and from the understanding of them; "to be ashamed and confounded" signifies to be destitute of all good and truth; for thus, when they come among the angels, are they ashamed and confounded.  [14] In Moses:      I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, with the blood of the stain and of captivity, and the gall of the revenges of the adversary (Deut. 32:42).  "To make arrows drunk with blood" signifies the delirium of mind from the Word falsified; "the sword shall devour flesh" signifies that falsities will destroy all things of good; "with the blood of the slain and of captivity" signifies the extinction and shutting out of all truth, "slain" meaning the extinction of truth by falsities, and "captivity" the shutting out of truth by falsities. "With the gall of the revenges of the adversary" signifies with the malice and cruelty of hell; "the gall of revenges" meaning malice and cruelty, and the "adversary" meaning hell.  [15] In Isaiah:      Bel hath bowed low, Nebo hath stooped, their idols are to the wild beast and to the beast; they have stooped and bowed low together, and their soul shall go into captivity (46:1, 2). "Their idols to the wild beast and to the beast" signifies that their falsities are infernal falsities, and evils therefrom; "they have stooped and bowed low together" signifies that they will fall apart; "their soul shall go into captivity" signifies that they shall go into hell, where they will be shut out from all truth. [16] In Obadiah:      In that day strangers led his strength captive, and aliens entered his gates and cast the lot upon Jerusalem (1:11).  This is said of Edom, which signifies the truth of the natural man, but here the falsity; "the strangers that led his strength captive" signify the falsities of the church destroying its truths, "strength" signifying truth, since all spiritual strength consists in truths; "the aliens who entered the gates" signify the falsities of doctrine destroying the truths through which entrance is given into interior truths; "Jerusalem, upon which they cast the lot," signifies the doctrine of the church from the Word, thus dispersed, "to cast the lot" meaning to disperse.  [17] In Jeremiah:      Woe to thee, Moab, the people of Chemosh have perished; for thy sons are taken into captivity, and thy daughters into captivity; yet I will bring back the captivity of Moab (48:46, 47). "Moab" means those who are in natural delight, and who therefore adulterate the goods of the Word; "the people of Chemosh" mean those who are in natural truth; "sons are taken into captivity and daughters into captivity" signifies that the truths and goods of their church are shut out by falsities and evils; "sons" meaning truths, and "daughters" goods; "I will bring back the captivity of Moab in the end of days" signifies that truths will be opened to those who are meant by "Moab," and they will be instructed in them, "the end of days" signifying the Lord's coming. [18] In many places in the Word it is said that "captives are to be brought back," and captives mean the Gentiles; and these are called "captives" because they are shut out from truths, which, however, will be opened to them by the Lord. As in Isaiah:      Jehovah hath anointed Me to proclaim good tidings unto the poor; He hath sent Me to bind up the broken in heart; to preach liberty to the captives, and to the bound, to the blind (61:1). This is said of the Lord; and "the poor" to whom Jehovah hath anointed Him to preach good tidings signify those who are in few truths, and yet desire truths that their soul may be sustained by them; "the broken in heart" signify those who in consequence are in grief; "the captives" to whom He was to preach liberty signify those who are shut out from truths and thus from goods; and to these truths are to be opened, and by them they will be imbued with goods. The "bound" and the "blind" signify those to whom it is denied to see truths, meaning the Gentiles that afterwards received truths from the Lord.  [19] In the same:      I have raised him up in justice, and I will make straight all his ways; he shall build My city and he shall let go My captivity, not for price nor reward (Isa. 45:13). This, too, is said of the Lord; and the "justice" in which Jehovah hath raised him up signifies the good of love; and "his ways which He will make straight" signify the truths proceeding from good; the "city which he shall build" signifies the doctrine of the church; and the "captivity which he shall let go" signifies the opening and revelation of Divine truths with those who had heretofore been shut out from them. That the Lord will do these things freely is signified by "not for price nor reward."  [20] In Jeremiah:      The sons of Israel and the sons of Judah are oppressed together, and all that take them captive hold them fast, they refuse to let them go. Their Redeemer is strong; pleading He will plead their cause, and will give quiet to the land (50:33, 34). This also is said of the Lord, who is meant by "their Redeemer is strong;" "to plead their cause" signifies visitation and judgment upon those who oppress them by falsities, and consequent deliverance from them; "to give quiet to the land" signifies protection from falsities, "the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah," who are said to be oppressed, do not mean the sons of Israel and of Judah, but the Gentiles that are in truths and goods from the Lord; and as these are restrained by those who deceive them and shut out truths from them, it is said that "those that take them captive hold them fast, and refuse to let them go."  [21] In David:      Thou hast ascended on high; Thou hast led captivity captive (Ps. 68:18). This, again, is said of the Lord; and "to lead captivity captive" signifies to deliver from the falsities that have held them captive. In Isaiah:      Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or shall the captivity of the just be delivered? For thus Jehovah hath said, Even the captivity of the mighty shall be taken, and the prey of the violent shall be delivered (Isa. 49:24, 25). This also is said of the Lord, and of the bringing back of the sons of Zion from captivity; and "the sons of Zion" mean those who are in love to the Lord and in truths therefrom. That they had been shut out from truths by those who eagerly confirmed falsities, and yet they were delivered by the Lord, is signified by "Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, and shall the captivity of the just be delivered?"  [22] In David:      Who will give out of Zion the salvation of Israel? When Jehovah shall bring back the captivity of His people Jacob shall exult, Israel shall be glad (Ps. 14:7; 53:6). Here also "Zion" means those who are in the good of love from the Lord; deliverance from evils by the Lord and salvation are meant by "Who will give out of Zion the salvation of Israel?" "To bring back the captivity of His people" means deliverance from falsities and evils; "Jacob shall exult, Israel shall be glad," means the joy with those who are in the external church and of those who are in the internal church because of their deliverance, "Jacob" meaning those who are of the external church, and "Israel" those who are of the internal church; and both mean the Gentiles.  [23] In Jeremiah:      Fear not, My servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel; behold I will keep thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of thy captivity, so that Jacob may return, and be quiet and tranquil, and none shall make him afraid (46:27; 30:10). Here, too, "Jacob and Israel" mean the Gentiles, "Jacob" those who are of the external church, and "Israel" those who are of the internal church; "to keep them from afar" signifies to save them although they are far from salvation; "to keep from the land of captivity" signifies to deliver from the falsities by which they have been shut out from the truths and goods of heaven and the church; "to return and be quiet and tranquil, and none shall make afraid," signifies to be protected from falsities which are from hell.  [24] In the same:      All that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, all shall go into captivity; and they that plundered thee shall be for plunder; and all that preyed upon thee will I give for a prey. I will bring back the captivity of the tents of Jacob; and I will have compassion on his habitations, that the city may be built upon its own heap, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner (Jer. 30:16, 18). "All that devour thee shall be devoured, all thine adversaries shall go into captivity, and they that plundered thee shall be for plunder, and all that preyed upon thee will I give for a prey," has a similar signification as the passage in Revelation here explained, namely, "if anyone shall lead into captivity he shall go into captivity; and if anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword." (What the rest signifies has been explained above, n. 799.)  [25] In the same:      I will be found of you, and I will bring back your captivity, and I will bring you together out of all nations, and I will bring you back to the place whence I caused you to depart (Jer. 29:14). This, too, describes the deliverance of the Gentiles from spiritual captivity, which is a shutting out from the truths and goods of heaven and the church, whereby salvation is effected. In Zephaniah:      In that time I will bring you, and in time will bring you together unto Me, for I will give you for a name and a praise to all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes (3:20). This, too, means the bringing back of the Gentiles from spiritual captivity. In Amos:      I will bring back the captivity of My people Israel, that they may build the waste cities and inhabit them, and plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof; and they shall make gardens and eat the fruit of them (9:l4). This may be seen explained above (n. 376, 405). [26] In Isaiah:      Put on thy strength, O Zion; put on the garments of thy splendor, O Jerusalem, the city of holiness; for there shall not add to come any more into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean; shake thyself from the dust; sit, O Jerusalem; open the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion (52:1, 2). "Zion" means a church that is in the good of love to the Lord; truth from that good is signified by the "strength that Zion shall put on;" and the truths of doctrine of that church are signified by "the garments of splendor that Jerusalem shall put on." "The uncircumcised and the unclean, who shall not add to come any more," signify the evils of earthly loves and their falsities; "to shake herself from the dust, to arise and to sit," signifies, in respect to Jerusalem, deliverance from infernal falsities and elevation to the truths of heaven. "To open the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion," signifies deliverance from being withheld from truths by falsities that hinder the reception of influx out of heaven, "daughter of Zion" meaning those who are in the affection of truth from the good of love from the Lord. In the verses that follow it is said of the sons of Israel:      That they sojourned in Egypt, and that Assyria oppressed them (Isa. 4); which signifies that they were shut out from truths by reasonings from the knowledges (scientifica) of the natural man.  [27] In the same:      The peoples shall take them and shall lead them to their place, and the house of Israel shall possess them for a heritage upon the land of Jehovah, for manservants and for maidservants; that they may thus take captive them whose captives they were, and they shall have dominion over their exactors (Isa. 14:2). This, too, treats of the bringing back of the sons of Israel, and by sons of Israel the Gentiles are meant. That those who shut out others from truths and lead them astray by falsities are shut out from truths and led astray by falsities, is signified by "they shall take captive them whose captives they were, and they shall have dominion over their exactors."  [28] In Hosea:      In the house of Israel I have seen a filthy thing; there is Ephraim's whoredom; Israel is polluted and Judah hath set a harvest for thee, when I shall bring back the captivity of My people (6:10, 11). This treats of the state of the church among the Jews about the time of the Lord's coming; "Ephraim's whoredom," which is "the filthy thing in the house of Israel," signifies the falsification of the Word; "whoredom" signifying falsification, and "Ephraim" the understanding of the Word. "Israel is polluted, and Judah hath set a harvest for thee," signifies that the church was in mere falsities, and that they applied the Word to confirm falsities, "Judah" signifying the Word, and "harvest" the abundance of such things in the Word as they applied. That this would be the state of the Jewish Church when truths should be opened before the Gentiles, by which they might be delivered from falsities, is signified by "when I shall bring back the captivity of My people."  [29] In the historical parts of the Word the captivities of the sons of Israel by various enemies, and their deliverances, have a like signification, as:      That they were forced to serve Cushan, king of Syria, and were delivered by Othniel (Judges 3);      That they served Eglon, king of Moab, and were delivered by Ehud (Judges 3);      That they were given over to Jabin, king of Canaan, and delivered by Deborah (Judges 4);      That they were given over to the Midianites, and delivered by Gideon (Judges 6);      That they were given over to the Philistines and Ammonites, and delivered by Jephthah (Judges 10, 11). Similar things were signified by:      The captivity of the Jews seventy years in Babylon (2 Kings 25). For the historical parts of the Word are all representative of such things as pertain to the church, and the expressions by which the historical facts are described are all significative.  [30] The "bound" have a similar signification in the Word as "captives," as in the following passages:      The bound in the pit shall be gathered together, and they shall be shut up in a prison; but after a multitude of days shall they be visited (Isa. 24:22).      By the blood of thy covenant I will send forth the bound out of the pit wherein is no water (Zech. 9:11).      The sighing of the bound shall come before Thee (Ps. 79: 11).      He hath made the world into a wilderness and destroyed his&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_410"></A><A HREF="#fn_410"><FONT SIZE="1">811-1</FONT></A> 22 cities. He hath opened not the house for His bound ones (Isa. 14:17).      To open the blind eyes, to lead him that is bound out of prison, them that sit in darkness out of the prison house (Isa. 42:7).  The king said, I was in prison, and ye came&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_411"></A><A HREF="#fn_411"><FONT SIZE="1">811-2</FONT></A> unto me (Matt. 25:36). Jesus said, Ought not this daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound lo these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the day of the sabbath? (Luke 13:16). </p>

<p>If anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword, signifies that those who imbue others with falsities are imbued with falsities from hell. This is evident from the signification of a "sword" [gladius et machaera] as being truth fighting against falsity, and in the contrary sense falsity fighting against truth, here falsity fighting against truth; therefore "to kill with the sword" means to destroy truths by falsities, and also to imbue with falsities. Also from the signification of "he must be killed with the sword," as being to be imbued with falsities from hell. Such are imbued with falsities from hell because they have shut heaven against themselves by falsities; and when heaven is shut against anyone then hell is open to him. For man must be either in heaven or in hell; he cannot be between the two; consequently when anyone closes heaven to himself he opens hell to himself and from hell nothing but falsities of evil spring forth, and with these he becomes imbued. But no other falsities but the falsities of evil close heaven. For there are various kinds of falsities, for instance, falsities of ignorance, falsities of religion, and falsities from misunderstanding the Word; in a word, the falsities that lead to a life of evil, or that proceed from a life of evil, because they are from hell close heaven. From this it is clear that "if anyone shall kill with the sword he must be killed with the sword" signifies that those who imbue others with falsities will be imbued with falsities from hell.  [2] There is a like signification in what the Lord said to Peter:      All they that take the sword must perish by the sword (Matt. 26:52).  This was said to Peter because he represented the truth of faith, and also the falsity of faith; therefore "to take the sword and to perish by it" signified to receive the falsity of faith, and to perish by it. Those who are signified by this "beast," who are such as by reasonings confirm the separation of faith from life, "kill with the sword, and are killed with the sword," that is, imbue others with falsities, and are themselves imbued with falsities from hell, because the dogma of faith alone shuts out all truths and rejects all goods. Faith alone shuts out all truths because such insist that we are saved solely by this, "That the Lord endured the cross for our sins, and thereby took away the condemnation of the law, and that He thus redeemed us." And as they hold that this alone, which they call faith itself, saves, they make no effort to learn truths, although truths are what teach man how he must live, and these truths are manifold. That faith alone rejects goods follows from the dogma itself, which is that faith justifies without good works; thus the essential goods of love to God and the goods of charity towards the neighbor are made of no account. </p>

<p>Here is the patience and the faith of the saints, signifies that through these comes temptation, and afterwards the implantation of truth from good with those who are made spiritual by the Lord. This is evident from the signification of "the patience of the saints" (of which presently); also from the signification of "faith," as being the implantation of truth; also from the signification of "saints," as being those who are in truths from good from the Lord (see above, n. 204), thus those who are made spiritual by the Lord; for man is made spiritual by truths from good. "Faith" signifies the implantation of truth because faith with man is truth acknowledged in the heart; for unless it is acknowledged in the heart it cannot be one's own faith; and this is why "faith" is nowhere mentioned in the Old Testament, but "truth" instead; and indeed, the ancient people with whom was the church were wholly ignorant that faith was anything else than truth; and when they said that they believed in God they meant by it knowing and understanding truths, and willing and doing them, and this from the Lord. Thence it is clear that "faith" signifies the implantation of truth.  [2] "The patience of the saints" signifies the temptation of the faithful, or of those who are made spiritual by the Lord, because "patience" signifies spiritual patience, which is patience in sustaining temptations; and those have that patience who fight in themselves against the falsities that are contained in the dogma of faith alone and that adhere to it; for that faith is confirmed by reasonings from the natural man and from the Word wrongly applied and thus falsified. The temptations that such sustain when they fight against falsities are meant by "patience."  [3] "Patience" has a like signification in Luke:      Ye shall be delivered up by parents and brethren, and kinsfolk and friends; some of you shall they cause to be put to death; yea, ye shall be hated by all for My name's sake: in your patience possess ye your souls (21:16, 17, 19). This is said of the last time of the church, when judgment takes place. The temptations that the faithful will then undergo on account of truths are described by "they shall be delivered up by fathers, brethren, kinsfolk, and friends, and be put to death," also "shall be hated for the sake of the Lord's name;" "parents, brethren, kinsfolk, and friends," meaning those who are of the same church, but who are in evils and falsities; their undergoing temptations is meant by "being delivered up to death" and "being hated;" therefore "in your patience possess ye your souls" signifies the preservation of the life of truth among falsities; "soul" signifying the life of truth.  [4] Again, in the same:      They who are sowed in the good land are those who in a simple and good heart hear the Word and hold fast, and bring forth fruit in patience (Luke 8:15). "To bring forth fruit in patience" signifies to do truths and goods even when living amid falsities and evils, that is, among those who are in falsities and evils. The Lord's patience in temptations, of which He suffered the most grievous of all, is described in these words in Isaiah:      He endured persecution and He was afflicted, yet like a lamb He opened not His mouth (53:7). "Enduring persecution" signifies temptations; "to be afflicted" signifies their grievousness; "to open not His mouth" signifies patience. </p>

<p>Verse 11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. 11. "And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth," signifies confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of faith separated from life, and the consequent falsifications of the truth of the church (n. 815); "and he had two horns like a lamb," signifies the power as if from the Lord of persuading that there is a conjunction with the Word of faith separate (n. 816); "and he spake as a dragon," signifies with a similar affection, thought, doctrine, and preaching, as belong to those who separate faith from the life of faith, which is charity (n. 817). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="815.">815.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Verse 11. And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, signifies confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of faith separated from life, and the consequent falsifications of the truth of the church. This is evident from the signification of "the two beasts" treated of in this chapter, as being the confirmation of those things that are signified by "the dragon," for "the dragon" signifies especially faith alone (see above, n. 714); and "the beast coming up out of the sea" signifies reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from life (see also above, n. 774); therefore this "beast" signifies confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of faith separated from life, and the consequent falsifications of the truth of the church. That "the dragon" is further described by these two "beasts" is evident from verses 2, 4, 11, of this chapter. There are moreover two means by which any heretical dogma may be confirmed, namely, by reasonings from the natural man and by confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word; and these two means are what are signified by these two "beasts." The former "beast" signifies reasonings from the natural man, because the "sea" out of which that beast came up signifies the natural of man, while this "beast" signifies confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word, because the "earth" out of which it came up signifies the church where the Word is. This "beast" signifies also falsifications of the Word, because the Word unless it is falsified can never confirm a false dogma, since all things of the Word are truths; consequently all truths can be confirmed from the Word, but by no means falsities, as can be clearly seen from what has been said above and also from what follows in this chapter. [2] As passages from the Word have been cited above (n. 785) in which "works," "deeds," "working," and "doing" are mentioned, I will now cite passages where "faith" and "believing" are mentioned, but only from the Gospels, and not from the Epistles of the Apostles, and for the reason that the Gospels contain the words of the Lord Himself, all of which have concealed in them a spiritual sense, through which immediate communication with heaven is granted, while the writings of the Apostles contain no such sense, although they are nevertheless useful books for the church.  [3] The passages of the Word where "faith" and "believing" are mentioned are the following. In Matthew:      There came a centurion to the Lord, saying, Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst come under my roof; but say the word only, and my boy shall be healed. Jesus hearing, marveled and said to them that followed Him, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith in Israel. And He said unto the centurion, Go thy way, and as thou hast believed be it done unto thee; and his boy was healed in that hour (8:8, 10, 13).  The Lord healed this person and others according to their faith, because the first and primary thing of the church then to be established was to believe that the Lord is God Almighty, for without that faith no church could have been established. For the Lord was the God of heaven and the God of earth, with whom no conjunction is possible except by an acknowledgment of His Divinity, which acknowledgment is faith. The centurion evidently acknowledged the Lord to be God Almighty, for he said, "I am not worthy that Thou shouldst come under my roof; but say the word only, and my boy shall be healed."  [4] In the same:      A woman afflicted with an issue of blood touched the hem of Jesus' garment; for she said within herself, If I shall but touch His garment I shall be healed. Jesus turning and seeing her, said, Daughter be of good cheer, thy faith hath made thee whole; and she was healed in that hour (Matt. 9:20-22).  In the same:      They brought unto Him one sick of the palsy lying on a bed; Jesus seeing their faith, said unto the sick of the palsy, Be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven. Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thy house (Matt. 9:2-7; Luke 5:19-25). In the same:      Two blind men cried, saying, Have mercy on us, Thou Son of David. Jesus said unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say unto Him, Yea, Lord. Then touched He their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you; and their eyes were opened (Matt. 9:27-30). No other faith than that which is called historical, which at that time was a miraculous faith, was meant by this faith whereby the sick were healed; consequently by this faith many wrought miracles at that time. This faith was, that the Lord was Almighty, because He was able to do miracles of Himself; for this reason He also allowed Himself to be worshiped, which was not the case with the prophets of the Old Testament, who were not worshiped. But there must always be this historical faith before it becomes a saving faith; for a historical faith becomes a saving faith with man by his learning truths from the Word, and living according to them.  [5] In the same:      A woman of Canaan, whose daughter was vexed by a demon, came and worshiped Jesus, saying, Lord, help me. Jesus said unto her, Great is thy faith; be it done unto thee as thou wilt; and her daughter was healed (Matt. 15:22-28).  In John:      A ruler whose son was sick besought Jesus to heal his son before he died. Jesus said unto him, Go thy way, thy son liveth; and the man believed in the word that Jesus spake unto him. And his servants met him, saying, Thy son liveth. Therefore he believed, and his whole house (4:46-53).  In the same:      Jesus finding the man born blind whom He healed, said unto him, Believest thou, then, on the Son of God? He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I may believe on Him? He said unto him, Thou hast both seen Him and He it is that speaketh with thee. He said, Lord, I believe; and he worshiped Him (John 9:35-38). In Luke:      Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, whose daughter was dead, Fear not, only believe, and she shall be made whole; and the daughter was raised up again (8:50, 55).  In the same:      One of the ten lepers that were healed by the Lord, who was a Samaritan, returned and fell upon his face at the feet of Jesus; and Jesus said unto him, Arise, go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole (Luke 17:15, 16, 19).  In the same:      Jesus said to the blind man, Thy faith hath saved thee; and immediately he was able to see (Luke 18:42, 43).  In Mark:      Jesus said to the disciples, when they were unable to heal a certain man's son&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_412"></A><A HREF="#fn_412"><FONT SIZE="1">815-1</FONT></A> who had a dumb spirit; to whom Jesus said, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth; the father of the boy crying out with tears, said, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief; and he was healed (9:17, 23, 24).  There were three reasons why faith in the Lord healed these; first, because they acknowledged His Divine omnipotence, and that He was God; secondly, because faith is acknowledgment, and from acknowledgment intuition; and all intuition from acknowledgment makes another to be present; this is a common thing in the spiritual world. So now, when a New Church was to be established by the Lord, it was this intuition from an acknowledgment of the Lord's omnipotence from which they were first to look to the Lord; and from this it is clear what is here meant by faith. The third reason was, that all the diseases healed by the Lord represented and thus signified the spiritual diseases that correspond to these natural diseases; and spiritual diseases can be healed only by the Lord, and in fact by looking to His Divine omnipotence and by repentance of life. This is why He sometimes said, "Thy sins are forgiven thee; go and sin no more." This faith also was represented and signified by their miraculous faith; but the faith by which spiritual diseases are healed by the Lord can be given only through truths from the Word and a life according to them; the truths themselves and the life itself according to them make the quality of the faith. But more about this in what follows.  [6] In John:      When Lazarus was dead, his sister saith, Lord, by this time he stinketh. Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, If thou wouldst believe thou shouldst see the glory of God? (11:39, 40). In Luke:      Jesus said to the woman who was a sinner, and who made His feet wet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed His feet, which she also anointed with oil, Thy sins are forgiven thee; thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace (7:38, 48, 50).  From this it is clear that it was faith in the Lord's omnipotence that healed them, and that the same faith remitted, that is, removed, sins. The reason of this was that this woman not only had faith in the Divine omnipotence of the Lord, but also loved Him, for she kissed His feet. Wherefore the Lord said, "Thy sins are forgiven thee, thy faith hath saved thee," because faith makes the Divine of the Lord to be present, and love conjoins. It is possible, however, for the Lord to be present and not be conjoined; from which it is evident that it is faith from love that saves.  [7] Again:      Jesus said to the disciples in the boat, Why are ye fearful, O ye men of little faith? Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the sea, and there came a great calm (Matt. 8:26; Mark 4:39-41; Luke 8:24, 25).      Peter, at the Lord's command, went down out of the boat and walked upon the waters; but when the wind became strong he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus took hold of his hand and said, O man of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt (Matt. 14:28-31).      When the disciples could not heal the lunatic, Jesus said unto them, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? and Jesus healed him; and He said to the disciples that they could not heal him by reason of their unbelief (Matt. 17:14, seq.).      Jesus came into His own country, and there they were offended in Him; and Jesus said, A prophet is not without honor save in his own country and in his own house. And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief (Matt. 13:57, 58).  The Lord called the disciples "men of little faith" when they were unable to do miracles in His name, and He was unable to do miracles in His own country because of their unbelief, for the reason that while the disciples believed the Lord to be the Messiah or Christ, also the Son of God, and the prophet of whom it was written in the Word, yet they did not believe that He was God Almighty, and that Jehovah the Father was in Him; and yet so far as they believed Him to be a man, and not at the same time God, His Divine to which omnipotence belongs could not be present with the disciples by faith. For faith presents the Lord as present, as has been said above; but faith in Him as a man only does not present His Divine omnipotence as present. For the same reason those in the world at the present day who look to His Human alone and not at the same time to His Divine, as the Socinians and Arians do, cannot be saved.  [8] And for a like reason the Lord could not do miracles in His own country, for there they had seen Him from infancy like another man; and therefore they were unable to add to that idea the idea of His Divinity; and when that idea is not present while the Lord is present, He is not present in man with Divine omnipotence; for faith presents the Lord as present in man according to the quality of the perception of Him. Other things man does not acknowledge and therefore rejects; for in order that the Lord may operate anything with man by faith the Lord's Divine must be present in man, and not outside of him.  John:[9] In John:      Many of the multitude believed on Jesus, and said, When the Christ shall come, will He do more signs than those which this one hath done? (7:31).  In Mark:      These signs shall follow them that believe: in My name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. And they went forth and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the Word by signs following (16:17-20). As the Jewish nation believed in Jehovah solely because of miracles, it is evidently a miraculous and not a saving faith that is here meant; for they were external men, and external men are moved to Divine worship only by external things, like miracles which forcibly strike the mind. Moreover, a miraculous faith was the first faith with those among whom a New Church was to be established; and such a faith is also the first with all in the Christian world at this day, and this is why the miracles performed by the Lord were described, and are also now preached. For the first faith with all is a historical faith, and this afterwards becomes a saving faith when man by his life becomes spiritual; for first of all it is to be believed that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, infinite, and one with the Father. These things must be known; but so far as they are merely known they are historical, and a historical faith presents the Lord as present, because it is a looking to the Lord from His Divine nature. And yet that faith does not save until man lives the life of faith, which is charity; for he then wills and does what he believes, and to will and to do is of the love, and love conjoins to Him whom faith presents as present. The signification of those miracles that the disciples were to do, and that were done by them in the beginning of the Christian church, as casting out demons, speaking with new tongues, and others, may be seen above (n. 706).  [10] In Matthew:      Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you (17:14-20).  In Mark:      Have the faith of God; for verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou lifted up and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, what he hath said shall be done for him. Therefore I say unto you, All things whatsoever ye ask when ye pray, believe that ye shall receive them and ye shall have them (11:22-24).  In Matthew:      Jesus said to the disciples, If ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which has been done to the fig-tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, be thou lifted up and cast into the sea. And all things whatsoever ye shall ask believing in Me, ye shall receive (21: 21, 22).  In Luke:      If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up and be thou planted in the sea, and it would obey you (17:6).  That this is to be understood otherwise than according to the words is evident from its being said to the disciples, that "If they had faith as a grain of mustard seed they would be able to pluck up a mountain or a sycamine tree from its place, and cast it into the sea;" also that "all things whatsoever they asked they should receive;" and yet it is not according to Divine order for one to receive what he asks if he only have faith, or for the disciples to pluck up a mountain or a tree from its place and cast it into the sea. But "faith" here means faith from the Lord, consequently it is called "the faith of God," and he who is in faith from the Lord asks for nothing but what contributes to the Lord's kingdom and to himself for salvation; other things he does not wish, saying in his heart, Why should I ask for what does not contribute to this use? Therefore if he were to ask for anything except what it is granted him from the Lord to ask he would have no faith of God, that is, no faith from the Lord. It is impossible for angels of heaven to wish and so to ask for anything else, and if they were to do so they could have no faith that they would receive it. The Lord compared such faith to the ability and power to cast a mountain or sycamine tree into the sea, because the Lord spake here as well as elsewhere by correspondences, and therefore these words must be understood spiritually. For a "mountain" signifies the love of self and of the world, thus the love of evil; and a "sycamine tree" signifies the faith of that love, which is a faith in falsity from evil, and the "sea" signifies hell; therefore "to pluck up a mountain and cast it into the sea by the faith of God" signifies to cast these loves, which in themselves are diabolical, into hell, and likewise the faith in falsity from evil; and this is done through faith from the Lord. This comparison of the ability and power of faith from the Lord with plucking up and casting a mountain and a sycamine tree into the sea was also made because in the spiritual world such things actually take place. There these loves of evil sometimes appear as mountains, and the faith in falsity from evil as a sycamine tree; and both of these an angel can root up and cast into hell through faith from the Lord. (That a "mountain" signifies love to the Lord, and in the contrary sense the love of self, see above, n. 405, 510; and that a "fig-tree," or a "sycamine tree," signifies the natural man in respect to its goods and truths, and in the contrary sense the same in respect to evils and falsities, see above, n. 403.) [11] So much respecting miraculous faith. Passages from the Gospels respecting saving faith, which is faith in truth from love to the Lord, shall now follow. In John:      As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish but may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but may have eternal life. He that believeth in Him is not judged; but he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God (3:14-19). In the same:      The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into His hand; he that believeth in the Son hath eternal life, but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the anger of God abideth on him (John 3:35, 36).  In the same:      Except ye believe that I am He ye shall die in your sins (John 8:24).  In the same:      They said to Jesus, What shall we do that we may work the works of God? Jesus answering said, This is the work of God, that ye believe in Him whom the Father hath sent. I am the bread of life; he that cometh to Me shall not hunger, and he that believeth in Me shall never thirst. This is the will of Him that sent Me, that everyone that seeth the Son and believeth in Him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. Not that anyone hath seen the Father save He that is with the Father;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_413"></A><A HREF="#fn_413"><FONT SIZE="1">815-2</FONT></A> He hath seen the Father. Verily I say unto you, he that believeth in Me hath eternal life. I am the bread of life (John 6:28, 29, 35, 40, 46-48).  In the same:      Jesus said, He that heareth My word and believeth Him that sent Me hath eternal life, and shall not come into judgment, but shall pass from death into life. Verily I say unto you, that the hour shall come when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. Even as the Father hath life in Himself so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself (John 5:24-26).  In the same:      Jesus cried out, saying, If anyone thirst let him come unto Me and drink. He that believeth in Me, as the Scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. These things He said of the Spirit which those believing in Him were to receive John (7:37-39).  In the same:      Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in Me, though he die yet shall he live; but everyone who liveth and believeth in Me shall not die to eternity (John 11:25-27). In the same:      Jesus cried out and said, He that believeth in Me believeth not in Me but in Him that sent Me. I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth in Me may not abide in the darkness. And if anyone hear My words and yet believe not, I judge him not; he that rejecteth Me and receiveth not My words hath one that judgeth him, the word that I have spoken shall judge him at the last day (John 12:44-48).  In the same:      While ye have the light believe in the light, that ye may be sons of light (John 12:36).  In the same:      Let not your heart be troubled; believe in God, believe also in Me (John 14:1). In the same:      As many as received Jesus, to them gave he power to become sons of God, even to them that believe in His name (John 1:12). In the same:      Many believed in His name, beholding His signs (John 2:23). In the same:      These are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye may have life in His name (John 20:31).  In Mark:      Jesus said to the disciples, Going into all the world, preach ye the Gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be condemned (16:15, 16).  These and other passages describe saving faith, which is to believe in the Lord; and to believe in Him is also to believe in the Father, because He and the Father are one. "To believe in the Lord" signifies not only to adore and worship Him, but also to live from Him, and one lives from Him when he lives according to the Word which is from Him; therefore "to believe in Him" is to believe that He regenerates man, and gives eternal life to those who are regenerated by Him.  [12] "To believe in His name" has a similar signification as "to believe in Him," since the Lord's "name" signifies every quality of faith and love by which He is to be worshiped, and by which He saves man. This is signified by "His name," because in the spiritual world names that are given to persons are always in accord with the quality of their affection and life, and in consequence the quality of each one is known from his name alone. So when anyone's name is pronounced, and the quality that is meant by the name is loved, that one becomes present, and the two are united as companions and brethren. The quality of the Lord however is everything of faith and love by which He saves man, for that quality is the essence proceeding from Him; therefore when that quality is thought of by man the Lord becomes present with him, and when this quality is loved the Lord is conjoined to him. Thence it is that those who believe in His name have eternal life. This shows how necessary it is that man should know the quality of faith and love, that is, the Lord's "name;" also how necessary it is to love that quality, which comes by doing those things that the Lord has commanded. The names "Jesus" and "Christ" moreover involve this same quality, since "Jesus" means salvation, and "Christ" or "Messiah" Divine truth, which is everything of faith and love as to knowledges, doctrine, and life. When, therefore, these names are mentioned their quality must be thought of and they must live according to it. This is what is meant by the words of the Lord in Matthew:      Jesus said, If two of you on earth shall agree in My name respecting anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them by My Father who is in the heavens. For where two or three are gathered together in My name there am I in the midst of them (18:19, 20).  There is, indeed, a presence of the Lord with all and also a love towards all; and yet man cannot be led and be saved by the Lord except in the measure of his reception of the Lord by faith in Him and love to Him.  [13] This shows how necessary it is for man to know the quality of faith and love, that is, the Lord's name, also to love it, since the Lord can be loved only through His quality. That the Lord, and not the Father, must be approached and must be worshiped in accordance with the quality of the faith and love that is prescribed in the Word the Lord Himself teaches, saying:      That no one has seen the Father at any time but that the Son brings Him forth to view (John 1:18);      Also that no one cometh to the Father except through Him (John 14:6);      Since the Father and He are one (John 10:30). Therefore to approach the Father and not the Lord is to make two out of one, and thus to worship apart from the Lord the Divine that is in Him. And this destroys in man the idea of Divinity in respect to the Lord, which again makes evident the truth:      That he that believeth in the Son hath eternal life (John 3:36).  [14] That to believe in the Lord is to believe in the Father, the Lord Himself teaches also in John:      He that believeth in Me believeth not in Me but in Him that sent Me; and he that seeth Me seeth Him that sent Me (12:44, 45). This means that he that believes in the Lord believes in Him not separate from the Father, but in the Father; and it is therefore added, "He that seeth Me seeth Him that sent Me." So elsewhere in John:      Believe in God, believe in Me (14:1). In the same:      Philip, believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? Believe Me, that I am in the Father and the Father in Me. Verily I say unto you, He that believeth in Me, the works that I do he shall do also, because I go to My Father (John 14:10-12).  In the same:      In that day ye shall ask in My name; and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you, for the Father Himself loveth you, because ye have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God. I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; and I go unto the Father. The disciples say, In this we believe that Thou camest forth from God (John 16:26-30).  "To come forth from the Father" signifies to be conceived of Him, and "to go to the Father" signifies to be fully united to Him. That "to come forth from the Father" means to be conceived of Him is clearly evident from His conception (Matt. 1:18-25; and in Luke 1:34, 35). That "to go to the Father" means to be fully united to Him is evident from the glorification of His Human by the passion of the cross, which has been spoken of above; and therefore He says, "In that day ye shall ask in My name," and no more in the name of the Father.  [15] In the same:       Jesus said unto Thomas, Because thou hast seen Me thou hast believed; happy are they that have not seen and yet have believed. And Thomas said, My Lord and my God (John 20:28, 29). It was because the Lord was now fully united to the Divine Itself, which is called the Father, that Thomas called Him his Lord and his God. So elsewhere in the same:      Say ye of Him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said I am the Son of God? If I do not the works of My Father believe me not; though ye believe not Me believe the works, that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me and I in the Father (10:36-38). That the Jews did not believe is evident in John 5:14-47; 10:24-26; 12:37-49; Matt. 21:31, 32. The cause of their unbelief was their wish for a Messiah who would exalt them to glory above all the nations in the world; also that they were wholly natural and not spiritual; also that they had falsified the Word, especially where it treats of the Lord and also of themselves. That such were the causes of their unbelief is evident also from the faith of the Jews at this day, who are altogether natural, and know or wish to know scarcely anything about the Lord's kingdom in the heavens. That neither would those in the Christian world at the present day believe that the Lord is one with the Father, and is therefore the God of heaven and earth, is meant by the Lord's words in Luke:      When the Son of man cometh shall He find faith on the earth? (18:8). But on this subject, the Lord willing, more will be said elsewhere.  </p>

<p>And he had two horns like a lamb, signifies a power as if from the Lord, of persuading that there is a conjunction with the Word of faith separate. This is evident from the signification of "horns," as being power (see above, n. 316, 776); also from the signification of "two," as being conjunction (see above, n. 532 at the end); also from the signification of a "lamb," as being the Lord in relation to the Divine Human (see also above, n. 314); therefore "to have two horns like a lamb" signifies a power as if from the Lord of persuading that there is a conjunction with the Word of faith separate, as can be seen from what precedes and from what follows; from what precedes, in that "the beast coming up out of the earth" signifies confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of faith separate from life (see just above, n. 815); and from what follows, in that it is said that this beast "spake as the dragon," and that "all the authority of the first beast he exercised before him," which signifies a similar affection, thought, doctrine, and preaching as belong to those who separate faith from the life of faith, which is charity, also the conjunction of the reasonings from the natural man, by which the religion of faith separate is strengthened, which will be treated of in the next articles. Thence it is clear that as the "horns" of this beast signify the power of persuading, "two" signifies conjunction, and "a lamb" the Lord, so "this beast having two horns like a lamb" signifies a power as if from the Lord of persuading that there is a conjunction with the Word of faith separate from life. Upon the head of this beast two horns only were seen, but upon the head of the former beast ten horns, because this beast signifies confirmations from the Word; and in the Word there is the marriage of good and truth, and this marriage is signified by "two." So, too, the horns appeared "like a lamb," because a "lamb" means the Lord, here the Lord in relation to the Word. That the Lord in respect to His Divine Human is the Word, that is, the Divine truth, is declared in the plainest terms in John:      That the Word became flesh (1:14).  [2] Such a power of persuading and confirming any heresy whatever from the Word is well known in the Christian world from the many heresies there, everyone of which is confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word and thus they are persuaded. The reason is that the sense of the letter of the Word is accommodated to the apprehension of the simple, and therefore consists in large part of appearances of truth; and it is the nature of appearances of truth to be capable of being adapted to confirm anything that anyone may adopt as a principle of religion and thence of doctrine, thus even when it is false. Consequently those who place genuine truth itself in the sense of the letter of the Word only, are open to many errors unless they are in enlightenment from the Lord, and in that enlightenment form doctrine for themselves that will serve them as a lamp. In the sense of the letter of the Word there are naked truths as well as truths clothed, and these latter are appearances of truth, and appearances of truth can be understood only from passages where naked truths stand out; out of these doctrine can be formed by one who is enlightened by the Lord, and according to that doctrine all other things can be explained. This is why those who read the Word without doctrine are led into manifold errors. The Word was so written in order that there might be a conjunction of heaven with man; and there is a conjunction because every expression in the Word, and in some passages every letter, contains a spiritual sense, in which the angels are; consequently when man perceives the Word according to its appearances of truth the angels that are about man understand it spiritually. Thus the spiritual of heaven is conjoined with the natural of the world in respect to such things as contribute to man's life after death. If the Word had been written otherwise no conjunction of heaven with man would have been possible.  [3] And because the Word in the letter is such it serves as it were as a support for heaven; for all the wisdom of the angels of heaven in respect to things pertaining to the church terminates in the sense of the letter of the Word as in its basis; consequently the Word in the letter may be called the support of heaven. For this reason the sense of the letter of the Word is most holy, and is even more powerful than its spiritual sense, as has been made known to me by much experience in the spiritual world, for when spirits bring forward any passage according to the sense of the letter they immediately excite some heavenly society to conjunction with them. From this it can be seen that all things of the doctrine of the church are to be confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word that there may be in them any sanctity and power, and moreover from those books of the Word in which there is a spiritual sense. Thence it is also evident how dangerous it is to falsify the Word even to the destruction of the Divine truth that is in its spiritual sense; for by so doing heaven is closed to man. That this is done by those who confirm by the Word the  separation of faith from its life, which is good works, has been shown above. </p>

<p>And he spake as a dragon, signifies with a similar affection, thought, doctrine, and preaching, as belong to those who separate faith from the life of faith, which is charity. This is evident from the signification of "speaking," as being affection, thought, doctrine, and preaching. This is the signification of "speaking" because all the speech of man is from affection and the consequent thought. The affection itself is expressed by the sound of the speech, and the thought by its words. The affection and the thought are both of them in the speech, as everyone who reflects can see. The affection alone by itself cannot speak, it can only make a sound and sing; nor can thought alone by itself speak otherwise than as an automaton without life, since it is the affection that gives life to every expression of speech; and this is why a man is regarded by others according to the affection of his speech and not according to the words he utters. "To speak" signifies also to preach from doctrine, thus doctrine and preaching therefrom, because it is said that the beast "spake as a dragon;" and a "dragon" means those who are in faith separated from charity both in doctrine and in life (see above, n. 714); and this beast means confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of the separation of faith from life, and the resulting falsifications of the Word; consequently "to speak as a dragon" signifies that kind of religion in respect to doctrine and preaching.  [2] As faith separate from charity and the resulting falsification of the Word are described by the dragon and its two beasts, I will show in this article that a like heresy is depicted in the Word by "Cain," by "Reuben," and by the "Philistines," and the like is meant also by the "he-goat" in Daniel. For there have been several churches on this earth, namely, the Most Ancient, which was before the flood; the Ancient, which was after the flood; the Jewish, which followed the Ancient; and lastly the Christian Church. All of these churches degenerated in process of time into two enormous errors, into one which adulterated all the goods of the church, and into the other which falsified all its truths. The church that adulterated all the goods of the church is described in the Word by the "Babylonians and Chaldeans;" and the church that falsified all the truths of the church is described by "Cain," by "Reuben," and by the "Philistines," and by the "he-goat" in Daniel which fought with the ram and overcame it. The adulteration of the good of the church, which is described by the "Babylonians and Chaldeans," will be spoken of hereafter where "Babylon" is treated of in Revelation; but now the falsification of truth shall be treated of, which is described here in Revelation by "the dragon and his two beasts," and was also described by "Cain," and by the others above mentioned. [3] That those who separate the knowledges of truth and good from a life according to them, and who believe that they may be saved by these alone, were represented by "Cain," has been briefly shown in the Arcana Coelestia where Cain and Abel are treated of; to which this shall be added. It is written of Cain:      That he was the firstborn of Adam, and that he tilled the ground, and brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah; and that Abel was a shepherd of the flock, and brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof; also that Jehovah had respect unto the offering of Abel and not unto the offering of Cain, that therefore Cain's anger was kindled and he slew his brother; and that Cain was therefore accursed and rejected from the ground, and became a wanderer and fugitive in the earth; and that Jehovah set a sign upon Cain lest he should be slain, and decreed that whoever should slay him should have vengeance taken on him sevenfold (see Gen. 4). It is to be known that all names of persons and places in the Word signify things and states of the church, especially the names in the first chapters of Genesis, because the stories in those chapters are made-up histories containing the deepest arcana of heaven, and yet they are most holy in the sense of the letter, because in every least word there is a spiritual sense that conjoins the heavens with the men of the church. What these stories involve in the spiritual sense and what the names of the persons there signify has been explained in the Arcana Coelestia. "Cain" signifies the knowledges of truth and good separated from a life according to them, thus from heavenly love, and "Abel" signifies heavenly love; or what is the same, "Cain" signifies truth separated from good, and "Abel" good conjoined with truth. And as truth is the first thing of the church, since every church is formed by means of truths, because every church begins from truths or from the knowledges of truth and good, therefore Cain was the firstborn, and was named "man" [vir] of Jehovah," "man of Jehovah" signifying in the Word the truth of heaven and the church; and the "ground" which Cain tilled signifies the church. The separation of truth from good is signified by the murder of Abel by Cain; for when everything of the church is placed in truths or in knowledges, and not in goods or in the affection of living according to truths, good with its affections is slain. And as everything of the church perishes when truth is separated from good, so Cain "was cast forth from the ground," which, as has been said, signifies the church. But because truths are the first things of the church, for life must be learned from truths, "a sign was set on Cain, lest someone should slay him; and it was decreed that if anyone should slay him he should be avenged seven-fold." And because truth without good is carried hither and thither, having nothing to lead it, and consequently falls successively into falsities, and departs from the way that leads to heaven, so Cain "was cast forth from the face of Jehovah, and became a wanderer and fugitive." The like is true of faith and charity, since faith is of truth and charity is of good; so when faith is separated from charity what is said of Cain takes place, namely, that "it kills Abel its brother," which is charity, and in consequence the church perishes, which is signified by "being cast forth from the ground, and becoming a wanderer and fugitive," for when faith is separated from charity truth is successively turned into falsity and falls away. [4] It has been shown above (n. 434), that "Reuben," the firstborn of Jacob, signified the light of truth and thence the understanding of the Word, and thus truth from good or faith from charity, as did the apostle Peter; and that conversely, "Reuben" represented truth separated from good, or faith separated from charity, and that this faith is signified by his adultery with Bilhah his father's concubine, in consequence of which the birthright was taken away from him and given to Joseph. To this may be added, that all heresies, so far as they are adulterations and falsifications of the Word, correspond to adulteries and whoredoms of various kinds, and these because of this correspondence are actually perceived in the spiritual world from those who are in heresies. The reason of this is that marriages as they exist in the heavens derive their spiritual origin from the conjunction of good and truth; and conversely, adulteries derive their origin from the conjunction of evil and falsity; and this is why heaven is compared in the Word to a marriage, and hell to adultery. And as there is in the hells the conjunction of evil and falsity, so there continually exhales therefrom a sphere of adultery. It is for this reason that "adulteries and whoredoms" signify in the Word the adulterations of the good of the church and the falsifications of its truth (see above, n. 141, 161).  [5] In respect to faith separated from charity, this is perceived in the spiritual world as the adultery of a son with a mother as also with a step-mother. This is so because that faith shuts out the good of charity; and when this is shut out the evil of the love of self and of the world takes its place, and that faith conjoins itself with that love. For every kind of faith must necessarily conjoin itself with some love; therefore when spiritual love, which is charity, is separated, faith then conjoins itself with the love of self or with the love of the world, which are the loves that are dominant in the natural man; and this is why so heinous an adultery results from faith separated from charity. From this then it is clear what is signified by the adultery of Reuben with Bilhah his father's concubine, and why he was rejected for this reason from the right of the primogeniture. This is also meant by the prophecy of Israel his father respecting Reuben:      Reuben my firstborn, thou art my power and the beginning of my vigor; excelling in exaltation and excelling in strength; light as water, thou shalt not excel, because thou wentest up to thy father's bed, then thou didst profane it, he went up to my couch (Gen. 49:3, 4).  These words may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 6341-6350). That such adultery is perceived in the spiritual world from faith separated from charity has been made evident to me from correspondences in that world. For whenever I have perceived afar off the sphere of adultery with a mother or stepmother, I have known at once that those who had confirmed themselves in faith alone both in doctrine and in life were near, and they were also then discovered; and when they had been explored they were found to have been such in the world. [6] So much respecting Reuben; we will now speak of the Philistines; these also in the Word represent faith separated from love. It was for this reason that they were called the "uncircumcised;" for "one uncircumcised" signifies one who is destitute of spiritual love, and is solely in natural love, and with that love alone no religious principle can be conjoined, much less anything of the church; for every religious principle and everything of the church has regard to the Divine, to heaven, and to spiritual life; and these cannot be conjoined with any other than a spiritual love; but not with a natural love separated from a spiritual love; since natural love separated from spiritual love is man's own [proprium], and this, regarded in itself, is nothing but evil. All the wars that the sons of Israel waged against the Philistines represented the combats of the spiritual man with the natural man, and thence also the combats of truth conjoined with good against truth separated from good, which in itself is not truth but falsity. For truth separated from good is falsified in the idea of the thought respecting it, and for the reason that there is nothing spiritual present in the thought to enlighten it. For the same reason those who are in faith separated from charity have no truth, except merely in their speech or in their preaching from the Word, the idea of truth instantly perishing as soon as truth is thought about.  [7] Because this religion exists in the churches with all who love to live a natural life, so in the land of Canaan the Philistines were not subjugated, as the other nations of that land were, and consequently there were many battles with them. For all the historical things of the Word are representative of such things as pertain to the church; and all the nations of the land of Canaan represented things heretical confirming either the falsities of faith or the evils of the love; while the sons of Israel represented the truths of faith and the goods of love, and thus the church. But what was represented by the wars that the inhabitants of the land of Canaan carried on will be told in its place and time; here it shall merely be shown that the Philistines represented a religious principle separated from spiritual good, such as is the religious principle of faith alone separated from its life, which is charity. This is why the sons of Israel whenever they fell away from the worship of Jehovah to the worship of other gods were given over to their enemies, or were conquered by them:      Thus they were given over to the Philistines, and served them eighteen years, and afterwards forty years (Judges 10; 13).  This represented their departure from the worship from the good of love and the truths of faith to worship from the evils of love and the falsities of faith. Likewise:      The sons of Israel were conquered and distressed by the Philistines (1 Sam. 4; 13; 28; 29; 31). But when the sons of Israel returned to the worship of Jehovah, which was the worship from the good of love and the truths of faith, they conquered the Philistines (1 Sam. 7, 14; 2 Sam. 5, 8, 21, 23; 2 Kings 18). That these historical things involve such things can be seen only from the series of things there described when viewed in the internal sense, to present which here would occupy too much time; therefore one passage only from the prophetical parts of the Word shall be cited, from which it will be manifest that such things as pertain to the church were represented by the Philistines in these narratives.  [8] Thus in Isaiah:      Rejoice not, O Philistea, all of thee, because the rod that smiteth thee is broken; for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a basilisk, whose fruit shall be a fiery-flying serpent. Then the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant. Howl, O gate; cry out, O city; thou whole Philistea art dissolved; for from the north cometh a smoke, and none shall be alone in thy assemblies. What then shall one answer, ye messengers of the nation? That Jehovah hath founded Zion, and in her the afflicted of His people shall hope (14:29-32). This describes Philistea, which signifies the church, or those in the church who indeed are in truths from the sense of the letter of the Word or from some other revelation, and yet are in filthy loves, consequently their truths are not living truths; and truths not living are turned into falsities when they are brought from exterior thought, which is the thought next to the speech, into interior thought, which belongs to the understanding, also when this thought considers truths in their origin, which those who are meant by "the Philistines" do not see. They do not see for the reason that while every man, even an evil man, has a faculty to understand, he has no good of the will, which is the good of life; for this good springs from love to God and from love to the neighbor, and it is these loves that cause that faculty to communicate with heaven and receive enlightenment therefrom. [9] This chapter in Isaiah describes those who are in truths without good, and shows that with such all truths are turned into falsities. This, therefore, is the spiritual sense of these words: "Rejoice not, O Philistea, all of thee, because the rod that smiteth thee is broken," signifies that they should not rejoice because they are permitted to remain in their heresy by reason of the fewness of those who are in truths from good; "for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a basilisk" signifies that out of the sensual man a dogma destructive of all truth will arise; "the serpent's root" being the sensual, which is the ultimate of man's life, and "the basilisk" being the destruction of all truth. "Whose fruit shall be a fiery-flying serpent" signifies from which there will spring faith separated from charity; this faith is meant by "a fiery-flying serpent" because it flies upwards by means of reasonings and confirmations from things revealed that are not understood, and thus it kills the things that are living. In like manner "the basilisk" has a similar signification as "the dragon," which is also called "a serpent;" and "the fiery-flying serpent" has a similar signification as "the beast coming up out of the sea and the beast out of the earth," in this chapter of Revelation. "Then the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down in safety," signifies that when that dogma is received by those who are natural and sensual men, and who believe themselves to be wiser than others, truths from good with those who desire what is true and will what is good, will become living; "the firstborn" in the Word signify truths born from good; the "poor" those who are not in truths but who still desire them, and the "needy" those who are not in goods but who in heart will them. "And I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy remnant," signifies that all truths, from the first of them to the last, will be destroyed by falsities. "Howl, O gate; cry out, O city," signifies that no entrance will be granted to any truth, and that doctrine will be made up of mere falsities, "gate" signifying entrance to the truths of doctrine, and "city" doctrine. "Thou whole Philistea art dissolved" signifies the destruction of that church by mere falsities. "For from the north cometh a smoke" signifies that every falsity from evil will break in from hell, "the north" meaning hell, and "smoke" the falsity of evil. "And none shall be alone in thy assemblies" signifies that there shall not remain a single truth among their knowledges. "What then shall one answer, ye messengers of the nation?" signifies the enlightenment of those who are in the good of life from love to the Lord. "That Jehovah hath founded Zion" signifies that a church shall be established from them; "and in her the afflicted of His people shall hope" signifies that those who are not in wisdom from self, and who conquer in temptations against such falsities, shall have intelligence and salvation.  [10] The vastation of truth by falsities with those who are meant by "the Philistines" is also described by Jeremiah 47:1-7; likewise in Ezekiel 25:15, 16; in Joel 3:4-6; in Amos 1:8. That such falsify truths is meant by "the daughters of the Philistines," mentioned in Ezekiel 16:27, 57; also in 2 Sam. 1:20; "the daughters of the Philistines" there meaning the affections of falsity. Their religious principle was also represented by their idol called Dagon, which was set up in Ashdod, and which, according to their description, was formed like a man from the head to the navel, and like a fish from the navel downwards; its being like a man from the head to the navel represented the understanding derived from truths; and like a fish from the navel downwards represented the natural destitute of the good of love; for the lower part down to the knees corresponds to celestial love, and a "fish" signifies the natural man which is without spiritual good. (That "man" [homo] signifies the affection of truth, may be seen above, n. 280; that his "head" signifies the understanding of truth and intelligence therefrom, n. 553; that a "fish" signifies the natural man, n. 513; and that the generative organs signify from correspondence celestial love, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5050-5062. Moreover, the "emerods" with which the Philistines were smitten when the ark of God was held captive by them, signified truths defiled by evils of life; but these and other things related about them in 1 Sam. 5 may be seen explained above, n. 700.) [11] Truth defiled by evil of life is signified also by "the uncircumcised" (2 Sam. 1:20; Ezek. 28:10; 31:18; 32:18, 19; 44:9). For the foreskin corresponds to corporeal love, because the member which it covers corresponds to spiritual and celestial love. And because "the Philistines" represented those who are in knowledge (scientia) and cognitions of truth without any spiritual and celestial good, they were called "uncircumcised." And as the sons of Israel were also actually of the same character, in order that they might nevertheless represent the church which is in spiritual and celestial good and in truths therefrom, it was commanded that they should be circumcised. From this it can be seen that the religious principle at this day that separates charity from faith is in the representative sense Philistea. [12] So much respecting the Philistines. Something shall now be said about the goats and sheep, upon which judgment will be executed, according to the Lord's words in Matthew (25:31 to the end). The common opinion is that the "goats" there mean all the evil, and it has not been known heretofore that the "goats" there mean those who are in faith separated from charity, and the "sheep" those who are in faith from charity. In a good sense "goats" mean those who are in natural good and in truths therefrom, which truths are called the knowledges (cognitiones) of truth and good from the natural sense of the Word. Such as these, or such good and such truth therefrom, are signified by the goats that were sacrificed. That there were also sacrifices of goats is evident from Lev. 4:23; 9:2-4, 8-23; 16:2-20; 23:18,19; Num. 15:22-29; 28:11-15, 18 to the end; 29; and elsewhere. For all the beasts that were offered as sacrifices signified such things as pertain to the church, all of which have reference to goods and truths. The celestial goods and the truths therefrom in which are the angels in the third heaven were signified by "lambs," while the spiritual goods and truths in which are the angels in the middle heaven were signified by "rams," and the natural goods and truths therefrom, in which are the angels who are in the lowest heaven, were signified by "goats." Celestial goods and truths are with those who are in love to the Lord; but spiritual goods and truths are with those who are in love towards the neighbor; and natural goods and truths with those who live well according to truths from natural affection. This is the signification of these three kinds of beasts in various parts of the Word (as in Ezek. 27:21; Deut. 32:14).  [13] But as most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so "goats" signify in that sense those who are in faith separated from charity, for the reason that they are more lascivious than other animals, and that they signify in the genuine sense those who are in natural good and the truth thence, and all who are in faith separated from charity both in doctrine and in life are merely natural. That such are meant in the Word by "goats" has been shown me to the life in the spiritual world. There various beasts are seen; but they are not such beasts as exist in our world, that is, not beasts that have been born, but they are correspondences of the affections and of the thoughts therefrom of spirits and angels; consequently as soon as those affections and the thoughts therefrom vary and cease, these beasts vanish out of sight. That I might know that those who are in faith separated from charity, or rather the affections and thoughts of such from their faith, are represented by "goats," it was granted me to see some of those spirits; and they appeared before my eyes and the eyes of many others altogether as goats with horns. Moreover, when rams and sheep were sent among them these goats being kindled with anger rushed upon them, and strove to throw them down, but in vain. For in the spiritual world goats have no power against the rams or sheep, therefore the goats were overcome. Afterwards it was granted me to see the same as men; and this was a proof that the goats were identical with those who had lived in the world in faith separated from charity.  [14] From this what is signified by the "ram" and the "he-goat," and "the battle between them," in the eighth chapter of Daniel can be seen, namely, that the "ram" there means those who are in faith from charity, and the "he-goat" those who are in faith separated from charity. Thus the future state of the church is there described, namely, that faith separate would dissipate all charity, which is the good of life, and falsity therefrom would have rule in the Christian world. To illustrate this, I will present a summary of what is related in Daniel respecting the ram and the he-goat, as follows:      Daniel saw in vision a ram that had two horns, one higher than the other, but the higher came up last; and he made himself great. But then a he-goat of the goats came from the west over the faces of all the earth; and he charged upon the ram and smote him, and broke his two horns; and he cast the ram down to the earth, and trampled upon him. The he-goat had a horn between his eyes, and when this was broken there came up four horns in its place towards the four winds of the heavens; and out of one of them came forth one horn which grew exceedingly, even to the host of the heavens, and cast down some of the host and of the stars to the earth and trampled upon them. Yea, it exalted itself even to the prince of the host, and the continual burnt-offering was taken away from him, and the dwelling-place of his sanctuary was cast down; and it cast down the truth to the earth (8:1-14, seq.).  That the "ram" here means those who are in faith from charity, and the "he-goat" those who are in faith separated from charity, may be seen above (n. 316 and n. 573), where the same things are explained; therefore I pass by any further explanation.  [15] Again that "he-goats" mean those who are in faith separated from charity, and "rams" those who are in faith from charity, is evident also in Ezekiel:      And as for you, O my flock, behold I judge between cattle and cattle, and between rams and he-goats (34:17).  Likewise in Zechariah:      Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will visit upon the he-goats (10:3).  From this it can be seen that the goats and the sheep in Matthew (25:31 to the end) have the same meaning; consequently works of charity only are there enumerated which were done by the sheep, and were not done by the goats. That such are there meant by the "goats" was proved also when the Last Judgment was accomplished upon those who belonged to the Christian Church; for then all those who were in faith separated from charity both in doctrine and life were cast into hell; and all who were in faith from charity were kept safe. </p>

<p>Verse 12. And all the authority of the first beast he exerciseth before him; and he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose stroke of death was healed. 12. "And all the authority of the first beast he exerciseth before him," signifies the connection of the reasonings from the natural man with the sense of the letter of the Word, by which the religion of faith separate is strengthened (n. 819); "and he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast," signifies in consequence of which those in the church who are in falsities and in evils therefrom in heart acknowledge the agreement (n. 821); "whose stroke of death was healed," signifies and thus the discordance was removed by devised conjunctions of works with faith (n. 822). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="819.">819.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Verse 12. And all the authority of the first beast he exerciseth before him, signifies the connection of the reasonings from the natural man with the sense of the letter of the Word, by which the religion of faith separate is strengthened. This is evident from the signification of "the beast coming up out of the earth," which exercised all the authority of the first beast before the dragon, as being confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word in favor of faith separated from life, and the consequent falsifications of truth (see above, n. 815), also from the signification of "the first beast," as being reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from the life (see above, n. 774); also from the signification of "the dragon," before which this beast exercised all the authority of the first beast, as being in general, faith separated from the life of faith, which is charity. From this it can be seen that this beast's "exercising all the authority of the first beast before the dragon" signifies the connection of reasonings from the natural man with the sense of the letter of the Word, by which the religion of faith separate is confirmed.  [2] The connection of reasonings from the natural man with the sense of the letter of the Word is meant, because nothing false can ever be confirmed by the sense of the letter of the Word except by means of reasonings from the natural man. For the Word in the letter consists of appearances of truth and also of correspondences, and both of these in their bosom, that is, in their spiritual sense, contain genuine truths; consequently when any falsity is confirmed by the appearances of truth that correspond to genuine truths the Word is falsified; and the falsification of the Word can be effected only by reasonings from the natural man. This is why "the dragon," which signifies the heretical dogma of faith alone, is further described by two beasts, by the first of which reasoning from the natural man in favor of faith separated from its life, which is charity, is described; and by the other, confirmation from the sense of the letter of the Word, and thus corroboration of it, also the falsification of truth, are described; from which it is again evident that this beast's "exercising all the authority of the first beast before the dragon" signifies the connection of reasonings from the natural man with the sense of the letter of the Word. But these things shall be illustrated by examples.  (1) [3] The dogmatists who contend for faith alone pay no attention to any of those passages of the Word where "works," "deeds," "working," and "doing," are mentioned; and yet these are so plain as to admit of no contrary reasoning; nevertheless by reasonings they wrest these passages from their genuine meaning and bend and turn them away from the genuine truth that is in the heavens, and that is contained in their spiritual sense. For they reason by saying that faith alone includes deeds and works, because those who are in faith are also in these, thus they are wrought by faith; when in fact, faith without deeds or works is a dead faith, by which nothing can be wrought. If this is said to them they argue that deeds are nevertheless present by a secret Divine operation, although they exclude them from being a means of salvation, thus that they may be present and not be present, as can be seen from justification by instantaneous faith, and also in the hour of death, even in the case of evil men. (2) It is a reasoning from the natural man that faith separate from goods of life is also spiritual, and yet the goods that are of love are what give life to faith, and make it spiritual. For love is the very soul of faith, and love is doing, for what a man loves he wills, and what he wills he does. And this the Lord teaches in John:      He that hath My commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me; but he that loveth Me not keepeth not My words (14:21, 24). Thence it is clear that faith without works is not spiritual; for it is without its soul, and faith without its soul is a dead faith. (3) It is also a reasoning from the natural man that faith was made the means of salvation because man cannot do good of himself. (4) It is also a reasoning from the natural man that those who are merely in faith are in God and in a state of grace, even so that nothing can condemn them. From this it is believed by many that it is not necessary to live a Christian life, which is according to the Lord's commandments; for they say to themselves, Why should I give any thought to works, when good works do not save and evil works do not condemn? I have faith that the Lord suffered the cross for the sins of the world, and delivered us from the condemnation of the law; what more is necessary? (5) It is a reasoning from the natural man that faith alone is like a seed from which all kinds of salvation spring forth like shrubs and trees from seed in gardens; and yet in faith alone there is no seed of life except what is from the spiritual life of man. (6) Moreover, all those things that are taught by the learned dogmatists of this religious principle respecting the progression to justification through faith alone are reasonings from the natural man; as, that the trust of that faith must be acquired from the Word, from preaching, and from the authority of teachers, without intellectual sight; and if the understanding enters into it faith does not become spiritual. And yet when the intellectual sight is excluded man is blind, and before a blind man falsities can be confirmed as well as truths, and even better than truths, because with one who is blind fallacies which are darkness avail more than truths themselves which are in light. Shut up the understanding, bring forth reasonings, and cite confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word, and you will persuade yourself of anything you wish, especially in theological matters that ascend into the interior of the rational mind.  [4] These are called reasonings from the natural man, because the natural man is in the delights of the love of self and of the world; and these delights, when they prevail, cause man to believe only such things as agree with them, which in themselves are falsities. They also induce darkness in everything spiritual, even to the extent that man shuns heavenly light, and thus rejects all enlightenment of the understanding. The reason is that the natural man, separated from the spiritual, regards only self and the world, and not the Lord and heaven; and thus he is conjoined to hell, which is the source of all falsities; and these can never be dissipated except by the prevalence of heavenly love and by genuine truths which are from that love. This, then, is why these are called reasonings from the natural man, and why reasonings from the natural man are what falsify the Word; for the Word cannot be falsified except by reasonings from the natural man. </p>

<p>As it was shown in a preceding article (n. 817), that Cain, Reuben, and the Philistines, represent in the Word those who are in truths separated from good, I will now show that the apostle Peter in the Word of the Evangelists means truth from good which is from the Lord, and also in the contrary sense, truth separated from good. And as truth is of faith and good is of charity, "Peter" also means faith from charity, and again faith separated from charity. For the twelve apostles, like the twelve tribes of Israel, represented the church in respect to all things of it, thus in respect to truths and goods, since all things of the church have reference to these, the same as to faith and love; for truths are of faith, and goods are of love. In general, Peter, James, and John, represented faith, charity, and the works of charity; and this is why these three followed the Lord more than the others, and it is said of them in Mark:      He suffered no one to follow Him save Peter, James, and John (5:37). [2] And as truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, Peter was the first to be called by his brother Andrew, and afterwards James and John were called, as is evident in Matthew:      Jesus walking by the sea of Galilee saw two brethren, Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers. And He said unto them, Come ye after Me, and I will make you fishers of men. And straightway leaving their nets they followed Him (4:18-20).  In John:      Andrew findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. And therefore he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking upon him, said unto him, Thou art Simon the son of Jonah; thou shalt be called Cephas, which is, by interpretation, Peter (1:41-43) In Mark:      Jesus going up into a mountain calls unto Him whom He would, first Simon upon whom He conferred the name Peter, and afterwards James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (3:13, 16, 17). Peter was the first of the apostles because truth from good is the first thing of the church; for, from the world a man does not know anything about heaven and hell, nor of a life after death, nor even about God. His natural light teaches nothing except what has entered through the eyes, thus nothing except what relates to the world and to self; and from these is his life; and so long as he is in these only he is in hell; and therefore, that he may be withdrawn from these and be led to heaven he must needs learn truths, which teach not only that there is a God, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that there is a life after death, but also teach the way to heaven. From this it is clear that truth is the first thing through which man has the church. But it must be truth from good, for truth without good is mere knowledge that a thing is so; and mere knowledge does nothing except to make a man capable of becoming a church; but this is not effected until he lives according to knowledges. Then truth is conjoined to good, and man is introduced into the church. Moreover, truths teach how a man ought to live; and when man is affected by truths for the sake of truths, which is done when he loves to live according to them, he is led by the Lord, and conjunction with heaven is granted him, and he becomes spiritual, and after death an angel of heaven. Nevertheless it is to be known that it is not truths that produce these effects, but good by means of truths; and good is from the Lord. Because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, Peter was the first to be called, and was the first of the apostles, and he was also named by the Lord "Cephas," which means petra [a rock]; but, that it might be the name of a person, he is called Petrus [Peter]. In the highest sense "rock" [Petra] signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth, or Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; consequently in a relative sense "rock" signifies truth from good, which is from the Lord, the like is meant by Peter. (That "rock" has this signification see above, n. 411. But what "Simon son of Jonah" signifies see also above, n. 443).  [3] These three apostles were fishermen, and the Lord said unto them, "Come ye after Me, and I will make you fishers of men," because "to fish" signifies to instruct natural men; for there were at that time, both within the church and outside of it, natural men who became spiritual as they received the Lord and received truths from Him.  [4] From this the signification of the Lord's words to Peter concerning the keys may be deduced; as in Matthew:      When some had said that Jesus was John the Baptist, others Elijah, others Jeremiah or another of the prophets, Jesus said to the disciples, But whom say ye that I am? Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonah; for flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but My Father who is in the heavens. And I say also unto thee, Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (16:14-19). This was said by the Lord to Peter because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, and this was what Peter signified; and this was said when he acknowledged the Lord to be the Messiah or the Christ, and to be the Son of the living God; for without such an acknowledgment truth is not truth, because truth derives its origin, essence, and life from good, and good from the Lord. Because truth from good, which is from the Lord, is the first thing of the church, therefore the Lord says, "upon this rock will I build My church." It has been said just above that "Peter" or "Rock" signifies in the highest sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and in a relative sense truth from good, which is from the Lord. That "the gates of hell shall not prevail" signifies that falsities from evil, which are from the hells, will not dare to rise up against those of the church who are in truths from good from the Lord, "the gates of hell" signifying all things of hell, for there are gates to all the hells through which falsities from evil exhale and rise up. "The keys of the heavens" signify the introduction into heaven of all those who are in truths from good from the Lord; "whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heavens," signifies that heaven is opened by the Lord to those who are in truths from good from Him; and that it is closed to those who are not. These things were said to Peter; but because "Peter" means truth from good, which is from the Lord, they were said of the Lord, who is the source of good and its truth; and this is why they were said when Peter acknowledged the Lord to be the Messiah or the Christ, and the Son of the living God. Moreover, as soon as good is implanted in truths with man he is conjoined with the angels; but so long as good is not implanted in truths with man heaven is closed to him; for he then has evil in place of good, and falsities in place of truths. From this it is clear how sensuously those think who attribute such authority to Peter, when yet such authority belongs to the Lord alone.  [5] That "Peter" signifies truth from good, which is from the Lord, has been made manifest to me from heaven, as may be seen in the work on The Last Judgment (n. 57). Because "Peter" signified truth from good which is from the Lord, and consequently also doctrine, and thus he represented those who are in truths from good and in the doctrine of genuine truth from the Lord, and since such as these instruct others, and are instructed by the Lord, therefore Peter so often spoke with the Lord and was also instructed by the Lord. He spoke with the Lord at His transfiguration:      About making three tabernacles (Matt. 17:1-5; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:26-36). The Lord then represented the Word, which is Divine truth; and "tabernacles" signify the worship of the Lord from the good of love and truths therefrom. (See above concerning the Lord's transfiguration, n. 594; and concerning the signification of tabernacles, n. 799.) He spake about the Lord:      That He was the Christ, the Son of the living God (John 6:67-69). He was taught by the Lord:      Respecting charity, that a brother must be forgiven as often as he sinned (Matt. 18:21, 22).      Respecting regeneration, which is signified by the one who having once bathed has no need except to wash his feet (John 13:10);      Respecting the power of truth from good from the Lord, which is meant by the power of those who have the faith of God (Mark 11:21, 23, 24);      Respecting sins, that they are forgiven to those who are in faith from love (Luke 7:40-48);      Respecting men who are spiritual, as being free; and those who are natural, as being servants, about which Peter was taught when he took the stater out of the mouth of a fish and gave it for tribute (a fish signifying the natural man, as likewise one that pays tribute. Matt. 17:24-27); as well as many other things (respecting which see Matt. 14:26-31; 19:27, 28; Mark 10:28, seq.; 13:3, seq.; 16:7; Luke 22:8, seq.; 24:12, 33, 34; John 18:10, 11; 20:3-8; 21:1-11). [6] It was because Peter represented those who are in truths from the good of love to the Lord, or in doctrine from truths, and these are they who instruct others, that the Lord said to Peter when he replied that he loved Him, that "he should feed His lambs and sheep," respecting which in John:      When they had breakfasted, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou Me more than these? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My lambs. He saith to him again, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? He saith unto Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My sheep. He saith unto him the third time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Lovest thou Me? And he saith unto Him, Lord, Thou knowest all things; Thou knowest that I love Thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed My sheep (21:15-17). From this it is clearly evident that Peter represented truth from the good of love to the Lord, and this is why he was now called Simon son of Jonas, for "Simon son of Jonas" signifies faith from charity; "Simon" signifies hearkening and obedience, and "Jonas" means a dove, which signifies charity. That those who are in the doctrine of truth from love to the Lord are to instruct those who will be of the Lord's church is meant by the Lord's asking, "Lovest thou Me?" and afterwards by "Feed My lambs" and "My sheep." Not that Peter only would instruct, but all those who were represented by Peter, who, as has been said, are those who are in love to the Lord, and thence in truths from the Lord. Peter was asked three times to signify the full time of the church from its beginning to its end, for this is the signification of "three;" so when he was asked the third time it is said that "Peter was grieved."  [7] And as the third asking signified the end of the church, therefore these words of the Lord to Peter immediately follow in John:      Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast younger thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldst; but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst not. And when He had thus spoken He saith unto him, Follow Me. Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following; which also leaned on His breast at supper. Peter, seeing then,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_414"></A><A HREF="#fn_414"><FONT SIZE="1">820-1</FONT></A> saith to Jesus, Lord, but what about this one? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me. This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die. Yet Jesus said not unto him that he should not die, but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? (21:18-23).  What all this signifies no one can know unless he knows that "Peter" signifies faith from charity, and also faith without charity, faith from charity in the church at its beginning, and faith without charity when the church comes to its end; thus "Peter when he was younger" signifies the faith of the church in its beginning, and "when he became old" the faith of the church coming to an end; and "to gird himself and walk" signifies to learn truths and live according to them. From this it is evident that "I say unto thee, when thou wast younger thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldst," signifies that the church in its beginning will be instructed in truths that are from good, and by means of them will be led by the Lord; and that "When thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thine hands and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst not," signifies that the church at its end will not know truths, but falsities that belong to faith without charity, and will be led by them, "to gird oneself" like as "to be clothed" signifying to be instructed in truths, because "garments" signify truths clothing good (see above, n. 195, 395, 637), and "to walk" signifying to live according to truths (see above, n. 97); consequently "to gird himself and walk whither he would" signifies to consider freely and to see truths, and do them; while "to stretch forth the hands" signifies not to be in such freedom; for "the hands" signify the power of truth from the understanding and perception of it, and "to stretch forth the hands" signifies not to have that power, thus neither the freedom to think and to see truth. "Another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldst not," signifies to acknowledge as truths what another dictates, and what one does not see for oneself, as is done at this day with the religion of faith alone. This faith is what is now meant by "Peter," and therefore it is said that Peter turning about saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, and said of him, "But what about this one?" likewise that Jesus said to Peter, "What is that to thee?" "The disciple following Jesus" signifies the goods of life, which are good works; and that these will not perish to the end of life is signified by the words that here follow.  [8] From this it can now be seen that "Peter" signifies also faith separated from charity, as also when:      Peter thrice denied the Lord (Matt. 26:69-75; Mark 14:29-31, 54, 66-72; Luke 22:33, 34, 50, 51, 55-62; John 13:36-38; 18:16-18, 25-27).      Also when the Lord, turning away from Peter, said to him, Get thee behind Me, Satan, thou art a stumbling-block unto Me; for thou savorest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men (Matt. 16:21-23).      Also when the Lord said to him, Simon, Simon, Behold Satan demanded you that he might sift you as wheat (Luke 22:31).  All these things have been cited to make known that "Peter" in the representative sense signifies in the Gospels truth from good, which is from the Lord; also faith from charity; and also in the contrary sense truth separated from good, which in itself is falsity; also faith separated from charity, which in itself is not faith. </p>

<p>And he maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast, signifies in consequence of which those in the church who are in falsities and in evils therefrom acknowledge the agreement in heart. This is evident from the signification of "the earth and them that dwell therein," as being those of the church who are in falsities and in evils therefrom; for "the earth" signifies the church that is in truths or that is in falsities, here, that which is in falsities; and "them that dwell therein" signify the goods or the evils of the church, here the evils; therefore as applied to the persons upon it, "the earth and them that dwell therein" signify those in the church who are in falsities and in evils therefrom. (That "the earth" signifies the church in respect to truths and in respect to falsities see above, n. 304, 413, 417, 697, 741, 752; and that "those that dwell" signify the good in the church, and also the evil, and in an abstract sense goods or evils, see above, n. 479.) The above is evident also from the signification of "worshiping," as being to acknowledge as certain, to acknowledge in heart, and to believe (see above, n. 790, 805); also from the signification of "the first beast," as being reasonings from the natural man confirming the separation of faith from the life (see above, n. 774), here the agreement of reasonings with the sense of the letter of the Word, because this "beast" signifies confirmations therefrom (see also above, n. 815). From this it is clear that the words "the beast coming up out of the earth maketh the earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first beast" signifies that those in the church who are in falsities and in evils therefrom acknowledge the agreement in heart. [2] In the preceding article it was shown that "Peter" signified truth and faith in both senses, namely, truth from good and truth without good; so also faith from charity and faith without charity. Something shall now be said about the apostle John, as signifying the works of charity. It has been said above that the twelve apostles, like the twelve tribes of Israel, represented the church in the whole complex, or all things of truth and good, or all things of faith and charity; likewise that Peter, James, and John, signified faith, charity, and the works of charity, in their order; from which it follows that when they were together they represented these as one. It is said as one, because without charity there is no faith that is faith; and without works there is no charity that is charity.  [3] Because these three apostles had this signification they followed the Lord more than the others, as can be seen in Mark, where it is said:      Jesus suffered no man to follow Him save Peter, James, and John the brother of James (5:37).  For this reason Peter was the first to be called by the Lord through Andrew, "Andrew" signifying the obedience of faith; and afterwards James and John were called; and to these two the Lord gave a new name. Likewise He took Peter, James, and John up into the mountain when He was transfigured; He also spoke with these three about the consummation of the age, and about His coming; they were also with the Lord in Gethsemane. That the Lord called James and John after He had called Peter is shown in the Gospels:      Jesus going on from thence saw other two brethren, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and He called them. And straightway leaving the boat and their father, they followed Him (Matt. 4:21, 22; Mark 1:19, 20).  [4] That the Lord gave a new name to James and John is evident in Mark:      Jesus called James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and them He surnamed Boanerges, which is, sons of thunder (3:17). "Sons of thunder" signify truths from celestial good. This is the signification of "thunders" in the Word, because in the spiritual world thunders are also heard, and these are produced by truths that are from celestial good when these are descending from the higher heavens into the lower. The light itself of truth from good is then seen as lightning, the good itself is heard as thunder, and the truths themselves therefrom as variations of sound. This is why lightnings, thunders, and voices, are mentioned here and there in the Word with this signification. Good is there heard as thunder, because good, which is of man's affection or love and is also of his will, is not spoken, but only sounds; while truth, which is of man's understanding and of his thought therefrom, articulates that sound into words. Celestial good is the same thing as the good of love in will and in act; before this it is not celestial good; and celestial good is what produces truths by means of thought and speech therefrom. From this it is clear why James and John were called "sons of thunder." (What "lightnings, thunders, and voices," signify in the Word may be seen above, n. 273, 702, 704.) [5] That the Lord took Peter, James and John up into a mountain when He was transfigured appears in Mark (9:2) and in Luke (9:28). These were taken because only those who are in truths from celestial good are able to see the Lord in His glory; and no others can be enlightened and can perceive the Word in enlightenment. For when the Lord was transfigured before them He represented Divine truth, which is the Word; and this is why Moses and Elijah were seen speaking with Him, "Moses and Elijah" signifying the Word. (But on this see above, n. 594). That the Lord talked with Peter, James, and John, about the consummation of the age and about His coming is evident in Mark (13:3); and that these three were with the Lord in Gethsemane is evident in Matthew (26:37) and in Mark (14:33).  [6] As John represented the church in respect to good works, and good works contain all things of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, John was more loved by the Lord than the others, as is evident:      From his reclining in the Lord's bosom, and his gliding on His breast when he spake with Him (John 13:23, 25).  The "bosom" and the "breast" signify in the Word spiritual love, which is love in act; and "the Lord's bosom and breast" Divine love itself; therefore those in heaven who are in spiritual love are in the province of the breast.  [7] So, too, John took the Lord's mother to his own house, and abode with her; which is described thus in John:      Jesus from the cross saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by; He saith to His mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then He saith to the disciple, Behold thy mother! Therefore from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home (19:26, 27). This signified that the church is where there is charity in act, or where there are good works; for the Lord's "mother" and "woman" signify the church, and "John" signifies charity in act, which is good works. (That "mother" signifies the church may be seen in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 289, 2691, 2717, 3703, 4257, 5581, 8897; and that "woman" has a similar signification see above n. 555, 707, 721, 730).  [8] That the Lord's church is in those who are in charity in act, or in good works, and not with those who are in faith separated from these, is signified also by what is related about Peter and John, namely:      Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom the Lord loved following, which also leaned upon His breast at supper. Peter seeing him, saith to Jesus, Lord, but what about this one? Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me (John 21:20-22). It may be seen above (n. 820), where also the preceding words are explained, that "Peter" here signifies truth without good, or faith separated from good works, such as the faith will be at the end of the church; and as "John" signifies the goods of charity, which are called good works, and these are with those who constitute the Lord's church; therefore it was not Peter but John who followed the Lord, and to Peter who had asked, "But what about this one?" the Lord replied, "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me," which means that the good of charity will continue with those who are the Lord's, even to the end of the church and when there is the New Church, but not with those who are in faith separated from that good; and this is what is signified by these words to Peter, "what is that to thee?" </p>

<p>Whose stroke of death was healed, signifies and thus the discordance was cleared away by devised conjunctions of works with faith. This is evident from the signification of "the stroke of death was healed" with the first beast, as being the discordance apparently cleared away by devised conjunctions of works with faith (see above, n. 786, where the same words occur). It is said, the discordance cleared away by devised conjunctions of works with faith, but what the nature of the conjunctions devised by them is, namely, that they are rather separations, may be seen in the place cited above.  [2] As it has been shown that in the Word of the Evangelists the apostle John signifies good works, which are also called the goods of charity and the goods of life, and that it was on account of this signification that John reclined on the Lord's breast, I will now show what good works are; but here only that they include in themselves all things of charity and faith that are with man. No one has known heretofore that all things of man's life are in his works, since works seem to be mere movements, which are called actions because they are alive with man, and are called speech because they are effected by movements of the mouth, tongue, and larynx. And yet these are what make manifest the charity and faith in man, and also complete and perfect them; and this for the reason that neither faith nor charity is with man until they actually exist; and they actually exist in works.  [3] All the things of charity and faith that are with man are in works, because works are the activities arising from his will and thought; and all things of the will and thought are brought forth and poured out into works, precisely as all things of cause into effects, and all things of a seed and tree into fruits; for works are their complements. That this is so is not apparent before man's eyes, but is apparent perceptibly before the angels. When man is in the exercise of charity the sphere of all his affections and of the consequent thoughts is seen about him like clear water, and sometimes like a cloud, either bright white or obscure; and this sphere contains all things of his mind in their complex; and from it what is the quality of the man in respect to all things belonging to him is known to the angels. The reason is that everyone is his own love; and the works therefrom are what cause that love to be active, and when it is active it pours itself out round about him. This spiritual sphere manifests itself not only before the sight as an undulation, but also before the sight in various representative forms, and this to the extent that by those representatives the man, spirit, or angel, is seen precisely as he is.  [4] Another reason why works contain in themselves all things of the mind is that all successive things, which advance in their order from highest to lowest, or from first things to last, form in things lowest or ultimate what is simultaneous, in which all things higher or prior coexist. But what successive order is and what simultaneous order is may be seen above (n. 595, 666), also in the Arcana Coelestia (n. 634, 3691, 4145, 5114, 5897, 6239, 6326, 6465, 9215, 9216, 9828, 9836, 10044, 10099, 10329, 10335). Moreover, works are the ultimate things of man springing from his interiors, which are in successive order. From all this it is clear that in these works all things of man's will and thought, consequently all things of his love and faith coexist. This, then, is why works are so often commanded in the Word by the Lord, and why man must be judged according to his works.  [5] From this it is clear what kind of man he is who separates faith from works, namely, that he has no faith, and that his works are evil, springing from the love of self and of the world, covered over and encompassed by such things as pertain to faith, but contaminated and profaned by the evils that are within. When, therefore, such a man is let into his interiors, as takes place after death when he becomes a spirit, all things belonging to his faith, which constituted the circumferences, are cast off and scattered. From this it can be seen why John, who represented the goods of charity or good works, reclined at the Lord's breast, and that he and not Peter followed the Lord; also why he abode with the Lord's mother after the Lord's resurrection. </p>

<p>Verses 13, 14. And he doeth great signs, so that he even maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men; and he seduceth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs that were given him to do before the beast, saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which hath the stroke of the sword and did live. 13. "And he doeth great signs," signifies testifications and persuasions (n. 824); "so that he even maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men," signifies the love of falsity from evil arising from the pride of self-intelligence as if it were the love of truth from good which is in the church from the heavens (n. 825). 14. "And he seduceth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs that were given him to do before the beast," signifies to persuade those who are in the church by testifications from the Word joined to reasonings from the natural man (n. 826); "saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast," signifies an established decree that all in the church should teach and believe nothing whatever except these things (n. 827); "which hath the stroke of the sword and did live," signifies the nature of those natural things by which the things taken from the natural sense of the Word for confirmation were conjoined (n. 829). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="824.">824.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Verse 13. And he doeth great signs, signifies testifications and persuasions. This is evident from the signification of "signs," as being testifications and persuasions (see above, n. 706); and as "great" is predicated of good, and in the contrary sense of evil, therefore "great signs" signify testifications and persuasions of falsity from evil. It is here said that the beast "did great signs," because "the beast" signifies confirmations from the Word in favor of faith separated from good works; and when reasonings from the natural man, which are signified by "the first beast," are confirmed from the Word, they both testify and persuade that it is so, and this for the reason that those who make this separation are not willing that the intellectual sight should have any part in matters of faith, which they call mysteries; and when the intellectual sight is not present they can persuade anything they please, even that which from the mere light of nature, anyone may see to be false. Propose any falsity, and declare it to be true because it has been said by some leader who is believed by his followers to be enlightened or inspired, and take away the use of reason, and thus prevent the entrance of the understanding with any light, and you will see all things as true, and will be persuaded; and for the reason that the primary proposition is believed without first investigating whether it is a truth or a falsity.  [2] That it may be known, that a falsity may be confirmed as easily as a truth, take this most trifling example: Lay down the ridiculous proposition that a crow is white, and confirm it as follows: that a crow is not born wholly black, that as it grows old it grows white, that its feathers are white within, and also its skin is white, and thus its blackness is only a shade surrounding the white parts, and reason further that man may indeed speak according to the appearance, that is, may say that it is black, and yet, since he is a man, he ought to think from his understanding that it is white, because it is inwardly white; just as it is allowable to speak of the sun's progression around the earth from appearance, and as in the Word also the sun is said to rise and set; and yet from his understanding one's thought must be that the earth revolves and causes that appearance. Add to this reasonings from the nature of colors, that they are all white in their origin, because they are from the light of heaven, also because every color when it is ground to a powder, even a black crystal, becomes white; and cite on this point those who have written on optics; and besides take away the use of reason, declaring that some man of authority and learning has seen this, and fix the mind on the confirmations, and not on the primary proposition, and it is possible that someone may be persuaded. But all this is ridiculous, because it is silly to conclude about a bird from any other color than its own, in which it appears; for thus all things in the world might be said to be white.  [3] It is similar with the falsities of heresies, as with that greatest of all that existed in Babylon, of which it is said in Daniel that the king published an edict there that he should be worshiped as God. It is similar with the reasonings, which are from hell, of those who declare that all things belong to nature, and even that nature created herself, and was not created by God; and if I may venture to say it, it is the same with the faith that is called justifying without an actual cooperation of the life. Such are the things here meant by "the great signs that the beast that came up out of the earth did, and made fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men, and seduced them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs that were given him to do before the beast," as is said in this and the following verse. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="825.">825.</A></FONT></span>
<p>So that he even maketh fire to come down from heaven unto the earth before men, signifies the love of falsity from evil, arising from the pride of self-intelligence, as if it were the love of truth from good, which is in the church from&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_415"></A><A HREF="#fn_415"><FONT SIZE="1">825-1</FONT></A> the heavens. This is evident from the signification of "fire," as being love in both senses, namely, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor; and in the contrary sense, the love of self and the love of the world (see above, n. 504, 539), consequently both the love of good and truth and the love of evil and falsity; for all goods and truths therefrom flow forth from love to the Lord and from love towards the neighbor; and on the other hand, all evils and falsities therefrom flow from the love of self and the love of the world. Therefore those who are in the love of self and of the world are in the love of all the evils that arise therefrom, and in the love of the falsities from those evils. (On these loves and the evils and falsities arising therefrom, see the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 65-83.) The above is evident also from the signification of making it, namely, the fire, "to come down from heaven," which is said because this is done in the spiritual world, by means of arts there known, by those who are in faith separate; and it means that the appearance that the love of falsity from evil is the love of truth from good, is from the confirmation of faith separated from the life by means of the sense of the letter of the Word; since what is confirmed from the Word is confirmed from heaven; but when a falsity is confirmed from the Word it is not confirmed from heaven, but only appears to be confirmed from heaven. So also from the signification of "before men," as being especially before those who are in the pride of self-intelligence, and who confirm in themselves this heretical dogma by their writings and preachings. From these it passes to the simple-minded, who have no pride of self-intelligence; but these do not confirm it with themselves, but suppose that it is so because it is declared and affirmed by a man of learning and consequent authority. But these merely hold the dogma in the memory, while the others implant it in their life, especially if they have lived according to it; and that which is implanted in the life inheres to eternity; but not what is merely in the memory.  [2] The pride of self-intelligence is with all who confirm falsities even to the destruction of the Divine truth, in which the angels of heaven are; for those are in that pride who regard self only, that is, their reputation, in their writings and preachings. For such are in the love of self, and everyone who is in the love of self when he writes and preaches is in pride; and pride derives all things from man's own [proprium], consequently it is called the pride of self-intelligence. The love of self has its seat in the will, and the pride of self-intelligence in the thought therefrom; consequently when they think anything from self they can think nothing but what is false, for one's own [proprium] which is of the will and therefore of the love, is what rules, and this, viewed in itself, is nothing but evil. It is otherwise with those who are in the love of uses, and thence in the love of truth for the sake of truth.  [3] Because those who are in the pride of self-intelligence remove works from faith, and therefore do not know what is meant by works, nor indeed what is meant by charity and by the neighbor, and even, when they have confirmed themselves, are not willing to know, it shall here be told what is meant by good works. Good works are all things that a man does, writes, preaches, and even speaks, not from self but from the Lord; and he acts, writes, preaches, and speaks from the Lord when he is living according to the laws of his religion. The laws of our religion are that one God is to be worshiped; that adulteries, thefts, murders, false witness, must be shunned; thus also frauds, unlawful gains, hatreds, revenge, lies, blasphemies, and many other things that are mentioned not alone in the Decalogue but everywhere else in the Word, and are called sins against God and also abominations. When man shuns these because they are opposed to the Word, and thence opposed to God, and because they are from hell, then man lives according to the laws of his religion, and so far as he lives according to his religion is he led by the Lord; and so far as he is led by the Lord are his works good; for he is then led to do goods and to speak truths for the sake of goods and for the sake of truths, and not for the sake of self and the world; uses are his enjoyments, and truths his delights. Moreover, he is daily taught by the Lord what he must do and what he must say, also what he must preach or what he must write; for when evils are removed he is continually under the Lord's guidance and in enlightenment. Yet he is not led and taught immediately by any dictate, or by any perceptible inspiration, but by an influx into his spiritual delight, from which he has perception according to the truths of which his understanding consists. When he acts from this influx, he appears to be acting as if from himself, and yet he acknowledges in heart that it is from the Lord. All angels are in such a state; and all infants in heaven are being led by that way to heaven.  [4] But it is otherwise with man when he refrains from evils and shuns them on account of the civil laws or the damage to his reputation; he does not then shun evils from any spiritual origin, but from a natural origin; consequently he indeed does works that appear outwardly as if good yet inwardly they are evil. They are like pictures composed of filthy mire, but overlaid with colors beautiful to the sight; or like harlots who appear comely in form, and adorned in white raiment, with diadems upon their foreheads and in their ears, and yet within are full of foulness. Consider, then, what the Christian world is at this day; how many there are who shun adulteries, frauds, unlawful gains, hatred, revenge, lies, and blasphemies, not because they are opposed to the Word and thus to God, but because they are opposed to the civil laws, and for the sake of reputation and from a fear of the loss of honor and gain in the world; then search interiorly into the reason, and you will perceive that it is because they do not believe that there is a heaven and a hell or a life after death. From this it is clear that whatever a man does, be it small or great, is a good work when it is done from religion, and in the church when it is done from the Word, when the man has come to detest evils because they are sins, and in themselves are infernal; on the other hand, that whatever a man does, be it small or great, is an evil work when it is not done from religion, and with us, from the Word. (For more about this see above, n. 803.)  [5] It must be known, however, that he who shuns evils because they are opposed to the Divine laws in the Word also shuns them because they are opposed to civil and moral laws in the world, for a man thinks from civil and moral laws when he is in a natural state, but from the Divine laws when he is in a spiritual state. From this it follows, that to shun evils and do goods for the sake of reputation and one's own honor is not hurtful, provided the Word and religion therefrom hold the higher place and constitute the head, and self and the world hold the lower place and constitute the feet. But otherwise religion is trampled down with the feet, and the world is worshiped with the head. </p>

<p>Verse 14. And he seduceth them that dwell on the earth by reason of the signs that were given him to do before the beast, signifies to persuade those who are of the church that these are truths, by testifications from the Word joined to reasonings from the natural man. This is evident from the signification of "seducing," as being to persuade that falsities are truths, for the persuasion of falsity is seduction. Also from the signification of "them that dwell on the earth," as being those who are of the church (see above, n. 821). Also from the signification of "signs," as being testifications and consequent persuasions (see just above, n. 824), here testifications from the sense of the letter of the Word. Also from the signification of "the beast" before which these signs were done, as being reasonings from the natural man (see above, n. 774). Here "the signs that were done by this beast before the other" signify testifications from the sense of the letter of the Word, joined to reasonings from the natural man, because "the beast" that did the signs signifies confirmations from the sense of the letter of the Word; and "the beast" before which the signs were done signifies reasonings from the natural man; so here it signifies the conjunction of confirmations from the Word with these reasonings; and when these are conjoined they become testifications and persuasions. For reasonings that are from the natural man are of no avail in spiritual things before the world; but when the same reasonings are confirmed from the Word they prevail; for the reason that the Word is Divine, and in the sense of the letter consists of appearances of truth and of correspondences, in which the genuine truths that lie hidden within can be seen only by one who is enlightened; while one not enlightened can draw over these appearances of truth to confirm that falsities are truths, for with one who is not enlightened fallacies prevail, and the reasonings are from fallacies. But one who is enlightened sees from spiritual and from natural light at the same time; and the natural light with him is illumined by the spiritual; but one who is not enlightened sees from natural light only, separated from spiritual light, and such a light is in spiritual things not light but thick darkness. And yet this thick darkness, when falsities have been confirmed, appears to be as it were the light of truth, but it is like the light in the hells, which in the sight of those who are there appears as light; but as soon as light from heaven enters the light there is turned into mere thick darkness, and their thought grows dull. Those who are in the hells that contain such as have more deeply persuaded themselves of falsities by their ability to think more interiorly than others, are in the light of phantasy, and this light is bright in a way, but it is turned into a still blacker thick darkness by the influx of rays of light from heaven. Such is the light of the confirmation of falsity from the sense of the letter of the Word by reasonings from the fallacies of the natural man. From this it is clear that the light of the confirmation of falsity even to the destruction of the Divine truth which is in heaven, is infernal light.  [2] As the preceding articles treat of good works, I will here go on with the plan and show what is meant by love to the Lord. All who are in love to the Lord from the Lord are in the third or inmost heaven; and they are such as have truths written in the life, and not, like the angels of the lower heavens, in the memory; and this is why those who are in the third heaven never talk about truths, but only listen to others speaking about them, and reply either that it is so, or that it is somewhat so, or that it is not so. For they see in themselves whether what they hear is true or not; and this they see not from any sight in the thought, as others do, but from the affection of truth in the understanding. For with them all truths are written on their affections, and these derive their essence from celestial love, which is love to the Lord. Thus with them truths make one with their affections. And as these angels are in love to the Lord from the Lord, their interior life consists of mere affections of good and truth from that love. For this reason they do not speak about truths, but do truths, that is, good works. For the affections of good and truth that are from that love must needs come forth in act, and when they come forth they are called uses, and are what are meant by good works. Moreover, they perceive in themselves the quality of the uses or works from the affection from which they are; and also the differences between them from the conjunction of many affections; thus they do all things with interior wisdom. And because they do not think about truths and thence speak about them, but only do them, and because this comes from their love to the Lord, and thence from the affections alone, of which their life consists, it is evident that love to the Lord consists in doing truths from the affection of them, and that their deeds are good works; consequently that to love the Lord is to do; and this is what is meant by the Lord's words in John:      He that hath My commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me. But he that loveth Me not keepeth not My words (14:21, 24).  And they are meant by these words in Jeremiah:      I will give My law in the midst of them, and will write it upon their heart. Neither shall they teach a man his companion or a man his brother, Know ye Jehovah, for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them (31:33, 34).   "The law" means all things of the Word, thus all the truths and goods of heaven; "in the midst of them" signifies in their life; and the "heart" upon which the law shall be written signifies the love. From this it is clear how ample is the doctrine of love to the Lord, for it is the doctrine of all affections which belong to love; and every affection has truths written upon it according to the quality of its perfection, and brings them forth in act with infinite variety; and these affections do not come into the understanding in the form of ideas, but come to the inner sensitive perception in the form of delights of the will, wherefore they cannot be described by words. Those who imbibe the laws of life from the Word and live according to them, and who worship the Lord, become angels of the third heaven. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="827.">827.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast, signifies an established decree that all in the church should teach and believe nothing whatever except these things. This is evident from the signification of "them that dwell on the earth," as being all who belong to the church (see just above, n. 826); also from the signification of "the image of the beast," as being the doctrine of faith separated from good works, and worship therefrom confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word by means of reasonings from the natural man; consequently "to make that image" signifies to make a decree or to determine that they should teach and believe only in this way; also that this has been done in the churches where the doctrine of faith separate has been accepted. This is the signification of the "image," because in the spiritual world all spiritual things may be exhibited by means of images, also by means of idols; and by these the particulars of doctrine may be portrayed, which I have also seen done. This is why images and idols have this signification in the Word. That idols signify the falsities of doctrine may be seen above (n. 587, 650, 654, 780). So here "saying to them that dwell upon the earth that they should make an image to the beast" signifies an established decree that all in the church should teach and believe nothing whatever except these things. With those who belonged to the ancient churches images were made representative of their doctrine and the worship therefrom; but the sons of Israel, on account of the proclivity of their mind to idolatrous worship, were forbidden to make them, as is evident from the Word.  [2] That it may be known that images have this signification I will cite in confirmation the following passages from the Word. In Moses:      Thou shalt not make to thee any graven image, or any image of that which is in the heavens above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters under the earth; thou shalt not bow thyself down to them nor worship them (Exod. 20:4, 5).      Ye shall make no idols to you, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image or a pillar, neither shall ye place the stone of an image in your land to bow yourselves down to it (Lev. 26:1).      Lest ye make to you a graven image, the image of any likeness, the figure of male or female, the figure of any beast that is on the earth, the figure of any winged bird that flieth under heaven, the figure of anything that creepeth on the ground, the figure of any fish that is in the waters under the earth (Deut. 4:16-18).  The sons of Israel were forbidden to make idols, graven images, and forms or figures of anything in the heavens, on the earth, or in the waters, because the ancient churches which were before the Israelitish Church were representative churches, also because the sons of Jacob were wholly external men, and external men at that time, when all worship was representative, were prone to idolatries, thus to the worship of such things as appeared before their eyes. But as the ancient churches were representative churches, the men of those churches made to themselves graven images and forms of various things which represented and thence signified things heavenly; and the ancients took delight in these on account of their signification, for when they looked upon them they were reminded of the heavenly things they represented; and as these belonged to their religion, therefore they worshiped the images. This is why they had groves and high places, and also sculptured, molten, and painted figures, which were set up either in groves or upon mountains, or in temples, or in their houses. So in Egypt, where the science of representations, which is the same as the science of correspondences, flourished, there were images, idols, and graven images, as also hieroglyphics; and other nations had the like. But when the men of those churches from being internal became external, then the celestial and spiritual things which were represented and thence signified remained as traditions with their priests and wise men, who were called magi and diviners; consequently the common people, because of the religious principle which their fathers saw in these things, began to worship them and to call them their gods. Now as the sons of Jacob were more external men than the others, and thence more prone to idolatries and also to magic, they were strictly forbidden to make to themselves graven images, images and figures of the likeness of anything existing in the heavens, on the earth, or in the sea, because all things that are in the world are representative, as flying things, beasts, fishes, and creeping things, for so far as they worshiped these idolatrously, so far they did not acknowledge Jehovah. And yet, since the church was representative with them also, the tabernacle was built, in which were placed the chief representatives of heavenly things, as the table on which were the loaves, the golden altar on which incense was offered, the lampstand with the lamps, the ark with the mercy-seat. and the cherubim above it, and the altar not far from the door of the tabernacle, on which was the sacred fire; and afterwards the temple was built, in which also all things were representative, as the painting therein, the lavers outside of it, the brazen sea under which were the oxen supporting it, likewise the pillars and porticos, with the vessels of gold, all of which they were permitted to worship as holy, provided they acknowledged the tabernacle, and afterwards the temple, as the dwelling-place of Jehovah. This was granted them to prevent their turning aside to idolatry and magic, which then existed with various nations in Asia; as Egypt, Syria, Assyria, Babylon, Tyre and Sidon, Arabia, Ethiopia, Mesopotamia, and especially in and about the land of Canaan.  [3] From this it is clear why "idols" signify in the Word the falsities of religion, and "images" doctrinals. That such things existed with various nations in the countries of Asia is made evident by the gods of Laban the Syrian that Rachel the wife of Jacob carried off (Gen. 31:19, 20); by the calves and other idols in Egypt; by the hieroglyphics there engraved and painted in temples, and upon obelisks and walls; by Dagon the idol of the Philistines in Ekron; by the idols made by Solomon, and afterwards by the kings in the temple of Jerusalem and in Samaria; and by the altars, pillars, images, and groves, among the nations of the land, which the sons of Israel were commanded to destroy, as is evident from various passages in the Word. [4] Moreover, it was from the science of correspondences and representations:      That the priests and diviners of the Philistines persuaded them to make golden images of the emerods and mice that had laid waste the land, and to place them beside the ark, which they sent back upon a new cart drawn by kine, and that they should thus give glory to the God of Israel (1 Sam. 6 seq.).  For at that time their priests and diviners knew what all these things represented; and that the images of the emerods and mice signified the falsities of their religion, which might be atoned for by these as gifts made of gold.  [5] Doctrinals are also signified by "images" in the following passages. In Ezekiel:      They shall cast their silver into the streets, and their gold shall be an abomination, in that they have turned the gracefulness of their adornment into pride, and have made thereof images of their abominations and their detestable things; therefore I have made it unto them for an abomination (7:19, 20).  This treats of the devastation of the church by falsities and evils, which is here meant by "the sword, pestilence, and famine" (verse 15), that were to consume them. The "silver that they shall cast into the streets," and the "gold that shall be for an abomination," signify the truth of the church and its good turned into falsity and evil; "to cast these into the streets" signifies to scatter them, and "to be for an abomination" signifies to be turned into infernal evil, for this is to be for an abomination. "They have turned the gracefulness of their adornment into pride, and have made thereof images of their abominations and their detestable things," signifies that they filled the whole church and its doctrine, and all things that are contained in it, with things profane; "the gracefulness of the adornment" signifying the church and its doctrine; and "images of abominations and of detestable things" signifying all things of it, thus doctrinals, the goods and truths of which have been profaned; "abominations" are goods profaned, and "detestable things" truths profaned.  [6] In the same:      Thou didst take the vessels of thy adornment, of my gold and of my silver which I had given to thee, and madest for thee the images of a male, with which thou couldst commit whoredom (Ezek. 16:17).  This is said of "the abominations of Jerusalem," which mean the adulterations of the truth and good of doctrine from the Word; "vessels of adornment of gold and silver" signifying the knowledges of good and truth from the Word; "to make of them images of a male" signifying to make doctrinals from falsities to appear as if from truths; and "to commit whoredom with them" signifying the falsification of them.  [7] In the same:      Oholibah committed whoredom in Egypt, she loved the sons of Assyria; she added to her whoredoms; when she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion, at the sight of her eyes she loved them (Ezek. 23:3, 12, 14, 16).  "Oholibah" means Jerusalem, which signifies the church in respect to doctrine, therefore the doctrine of the church; "to commit whoredom" signifies the falsification and adulteration of the Word; and as "Egypt" signifies natural truths, which are called knowledges [scientifica], and "Assyria" rational truths, and in the contrary sense falsities, it is clear what is signified by "committing whoredom with them." As "the Chaldeans" signify the truths of the Word profaned by being applied to the loves of self and the world, so the "images of the Chaldeans" signify doctrinals that are pleasing to those loves; "portrayed with vermilion" signifies these appearing outwardly as if truths, although inwardly they are profane; "men portrayed upon the wall" have a similar signification, "a painted wall" meaning the appearance of doctrinals in externals. "Images" have a like signification in Isaiah (2:16); in David (Ps. 73:20); also in the following passages in Revelation (14:9-11; 15:2; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4). (See also what has been said above about "idols" and "graven images," n. 587, 650, 654, 780, where other passages from the Word have been cited and explained.) </p>

<p>Love to the Lord, in which love are the angels that are in the third heaven, has been treated of above; it now remains to say something about the love towards the neighbor with those angels. By the "neighbor" they mean uses, which indeed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_416"></A><A HREF="#fn_416"><FONT SIZE="1">828-1</FONT></A> are works; but with those angels uses are all things that are done with them from the Lord, and these have relation especially to the worship of the Lord, to His church, to the implantation of its holy things, especially with little children, with whom they have conjunction, and whom they inspire with innocence and its affections; also to the good of society in general and also in particular. These are the things that chiefly belong to their love, because they belong to the Lord's love. The Lord operates these things with them by means of the love that is implanted in their life, which is such that they perceive in these things the delight of their life. Such things are the neighbor to them, because they do not regard persons, but such things as are with persons; for they have more wisdom than other angels, and it is wisdom to regard others from such things as are with them and which constitute them. For every angel, spirit, and man is his love and his affection, thus his good and his truth therefrom; and as these are what constitute them, and as they are wise, they must needs regard others according to what constitutes them. This to them is the neighbor, or the brother and companion, which are often mentioned in the Word, "brother" meaning to them good, and "companion" truth. Thence it is clear what love towards the neighbor is in the third heaven.  [2] As to the other things that relate to moral, civil, and domestic life, these, too, are works done by them from affection, but they are not such works as they mean by "neighbor," or "brother and companion;" for they derive somewhat from the world, and also from what is useful to themselves and their own. These works are derivations and productions of the uses before mentioned, and are such things as proceed from their thought, therefore they can discourse about them. These works keep the life of their body in such a state that the life of their love can dwell in it and perform its uses. These angels, being such, do not know what is meant by charity, or what is meant by faith; but they have the love of good in place of charity, and the love of truth in place of faith. Moreover, they are continually in the love of good and truth because their life is the affection of good, in which and from which is the perception of truth. When, therefore, charity from which is faith, or faith which is from charity, is mentioned, they do not know what is meant. As the angels of the third heaven are such they appear before the angels of the lower heavens like infants, some like boys, and all of them, as it were simple; moreover, they go naked. They appear like infants and like boys because they are in innocence; and love to the Lord from the Lord is innocence; and this is also why infants and boys signify in the Word innocence and also love to the Lord. [3] They appear simple because they cannot talk about the holy things of heaven and the church; for with them these things are not in the memory, from which all speech comes, but in the life; and from that in the understanding, not as thought but as the affection of good in its form, which does not descend into speech; and if it were to descend it would not be spoken, but only sounded; and those who cannot speak about such things appear to themselves and others as if simple. A further reason is that they are in humility of heart, knowing that wisdom consists in perceiving that the things in which they are wise are scarcely anything in comparison with the things in which they are not wise. They go naked because "nakedness" means in the spiritual sense innocence, and because "garments" signify truths clothing good, and the truths that clothe are in the memory, and from that in the thought; while with them truths are in the life, that is, are hidden, and manifest themselves only before the perception when others are uttering them, or their ministers are preaching them from the Word. Again, they are perfected by the conversation of those who are in the understanding of truth, and by preachings, and also by books. And they write not by letters, like the other angels, but by curves and inflexions that contain arcana that transcend the understanding of the angels in the lower heavens. Furthermore, they dwell in expanses above the others, and in gardens there in which there are shrubberies and beds of flowers, and thus they are in perpetual representatives of heavenly things; and what is wonderful, not a stone is found there; because "stone" signifies natural truth, while "wood" signifies good; a "tree" perception, and a "flower" implantation. Thus much respecting love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, that is, respecting celestial love. Hereafter spiritual love shall be described, also charity and faith. </p>

<p>Which hath the stroke of the sword and did live, signifies the nature of those natural things by which the things taken from the natural sense of the Word for confirmation were conjoined. This is evident from the explanation of what is said above in the third verse of the chapter, where are these words, "I saw one of his heads as if it had been wounded unto death, and the stroke of his death was healed," for the explanation of which see above (n. 785, 786). That "sword" signifies the combat of falsity against truth and the destruction of truth by falsities see also above (n. 131, 367). </p>

<p>Verse 15. And it was given unto him to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast may both speak and may cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast be killed. 15. "And it was given unto him to give breath to the image of the beast," signifies that by being conjoined with the Word there was something of spiritual life therein (n. 831); "that the image of the beast may both speak," signifies that consequently an agreement flowed in from heaven into the thought nearest to the speech excited and enkindled by natural love (n. 832); "and may cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast be killed," signifies threats of eternal death to those that do not believe everything and all things that are so established (n. 833). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="831.">831.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Verse 15. And it was given unto him to give breath to the image of the beast, signifies that by being conjoined with the Word there was something of spiritual life therein. This is evident from the signification of "breath," as being spiritual life (of which presently); also from the signification of "the image of the beast," as being the doctrine of faith separated from good works, which would be taught and believed in the church (see above, n. 827); from which it follows that "to give breath to the image of the beast" signifies that by a conjunction of the reasonings from the natural man with the Word there was something of spiritual life therein; but what the quality of that life is will be told presently; "breath" [spiritum] signifies spiritual life, because "breath" ["spiritum"] signifies in the highest sense Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, and thence, as applied to men, who receive it, it signifies spiritual life (see above, n. 183). Spiritual life is the same as a life from Divine truths; and as the Word is Divine truth, and thus from it man has spiritual life, therefore when reasonings from the natural man in favor of faith separated from life are conjoined with the Word, and thus it is made the doctrine for the church, there is in it something of spiritual life. For all things in the Word are in themselves spiritual, and give spiritual life to those who study it in the measure of its reception in the heart. Therefore the Lord says:      The words that I speak unto you are spirit and are life (John 6:63). [2] As celestial love in which are the angels of the third heaven has been treated of in what precedes, I will now say something about spiritual love, in which are the angels of the second heaven. Spiritual love is the love of truth, and in the highest sense the love of the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; thus it is also love to the Lord, but in a lower degree than that in which the celestial angels are. The celestial angels are in love to the Lord from the reception of Divine good from Him, while the spiritual angels are in love to the Lord from the reception of Divine truth from Him. The difference is like that between love in the will and love in the understanding, or like that between a flame and its light. Moreover light with the angels of the third heaven is derived from what is flaming, while the light of the angels of the second heaven is derived from what is bright white (but for more respecting this see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126-140). Their life differs in like manner. The life of the angels of the third heaven consists in the affections of good, and the life of the angels of the second heaven in the affections of truth. The difference is such that they are easily distinguished by their faces and by their speech. As spiritual love is love of truth, and spiritual angels in respect to their life are affections of truth, they speak about the holy things of heaven and the church, unlike the angels of the third heaven, who cannot speak about these things, as has been said above. And as the celestial angels are perfected in wisdom by hearing, there are intermediate angels, who are called celestial-spiritual angels, who preach and teach truths in their temples, which are called houses of God, and are of wood.  [3] Spiritual angels, from the spiritual love that constitutes their life, are affections of truth, and not affections of good, because they are reformed and regenerated and become angels in a way different from that of celestial angels. For spiritual angels admit truths first into the memory, and from that into the understanding, which is thus formed by these truths; and then they are perfected so far as they are spiritually affected by Divine truths, that is, on account of them and for the sake of a life according to them. But celestial angels do not first admit truths into the memory, but immediately into the will, and through acts into the life; consequently they are not able to speak about Divine truths, but they simply will and do them; while spiritual angels speak about Divine truths, because with them they are inscribed on the memory; and thought speaks from the memory.  [4] And yet spiritual angels admit no truth into the memory and from it into the understanding with themselves unless they see it; for the angels in that heaven see truths from the light of truth, thus by enlightenment from the Lord; for in the heavens truths are spiritual objects, and appear more clearly before the angels there than natural objects do before men in the world; consequently they know&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_417"></A><A HREF="#fn_417"><FONT SIZE="1">831-1</FONT></A> that faith is nothing else than the acknowledgment of truth because it is seen to be true; and they cannot at all comprehend how a faith in anything that is not seen or understood can exist in anyone, for in that case a man does not know whether it be true or false, and faith in what is false is harmful. From this it is clear that with spiritual angels intellectual sight is spiritual sight. These angels are perfected in understanding so far as they are in the love of truth for the sake of life and its genuine uses; and in the same measure truths are implanted in their life and they become affections of truth. For as truths derive all their essence and all their life from good, so the understanding derives all its essence and life from the will and its activity; for the understanding is the receptacle of truth, and the will the receptacle of good, and their activity fills and establishes them. Thence also the truths of which their understanding is formed, when they come to be of the will and thence of the action are called goods, but spiritual goods; and because they then come to be of their love they enter the life and form it. From this also it is clear that the life of every man is from his works, since in them the affection which is of the will, and the thought which is of the understanding, terminate and thus have existence; and unless they are terminated they perish. For the will has no existence unless it becomes active; and when there is no will the understanding perishes, and there remains merely the faculty to understand.  [5] Because their love is the love of truth they acknowledge as the neighbor truth in act, which is called spiritual good, thus the good of the church, the good of the society in which they are, the good of the fellow-citizens in the society, and thus also the moral good which is called integrity, and the civil good which is called justice. Therefore their love towards the neighbor consists in exercises, which are works. Moreover, all in the spiritual heaven love uses, and are intent on works, by which their thoughts are kept as it were at home, and withheld from idleness, which is, as it is also called the devil's pillow. They know that only those who perceive delight in works can be kept in spiritual love; such are in their fixed affection; but others are in every affection and thus in none, for they wander wherever pleasures and cupidities carry them. Again, the angels of the second heaven, like the angels of the third heaven, dwell in distinct societies, but the societies of the third heaven are above those of the second, because celestial love flows into spiritual love; for spiritual love derives its essence from celestial love by influx mediate and immediate from the Lord.  [6] In the spiritual heaven there are magnificent palaces, in which all things within shine with precious stones and decorations in such forms as cannot be equaled by any painting in the world, nor expressed in words. For art there, especially that of architecture, is in its own art. From that heaven many arts in the world derive their laws and harmonies, from which come their forms of beauty. The silver that is found among those who dwell beneath these heavens is given by the Lord from that heaven, but the gold from the third heaven; for silver corresponds to spiritual good, which is in its essence truth; and gold corresponds to celestial good. The spiritual angels are clothed in garments of fine linen and silk, generally in shining garments. And as the spiritual heavens correspond to the eyes, there are paradisiacal scenes, as also in many places rainbow colored appearances and these also are of ineffable beauty. They know nothing there about the sense of the letter of the Word, but only about its spiritual sense, for they have the Word in that sense, which is read by everyone. In that heaven, justice, integrity, verity, chastity, and the other praiseworthy virtues of moral life reign. These heavens constitute the royalty of the Lord, while the higher heavens, where the celestial angels are, constitute the priesthood of the Lord; for His royalty is Divine truth, and His priesthood is Divine good. </p>

<p>That the image of the beast may speak, signifies that consequently an agreement flowed in from heaven into the thought nearest to the speech excited and enkindled by natural love. This is evident from the speech and preaching of those who confirm the separation of faith from life by means of the Word. For all things of the Word and every particular of it communicate with the heavens, and from it there flows a holiness into the person speaking or preaching; but with such this holiness cannot flow into any spiritual affection and thought therefrom, because all who are in a faith separated from the life are not spiritual but merely natural. Therefore this holy principle flows into their natural love, which excites and enkindles the thought nearest to the speech. And this is why such can speak and preach like those who are spiritual, although they have no spiritual affection, but only natural affection, which is the affection of glory, honor, or gain; and yet this affection is excited, and even enkindled, by an influx of holiness from heaven.  [2] The sense of the letter of the Word communicates with heaven, because each and every thing therein contains a spiritual sense; and the spiritual sense is perceived in the heavens when the natural sense, which is the sense of the letter, is understood by man. That this is so has been confirmed to me from the spiritual world by much experience. I have heard some recite words from the sense of the letter of the Word and have perceived that immediately they had communication with some society of heaven; for the spiritual sense which was in the words then recited from the sense of the letter penetrated to that society. Sometimes this communication is abused by evil spirits to acquire for themselves favor from the heavens. From this it is clear what is the quality of the Word in the sense of the letter; and as it is a means of communicating with heaven, a spiritual which is holy and which agrees with the natural, flows in therefrom into the natural love of the one speaking or preaching from the Word; and this love excites the thought nearest to his speech. It is said the thought nearest to the speech, because man has interior thought and exterior thought. He has interior thought when he is alone and thinks by himself, but he has exterior thought when he is with others and is speaking with them. Everyone knows that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_418"></A><A HREF="#fn_418"><FONT SIZE="1">832-1</FONT></A> man can think in himself differently from the thought from which he speaks before men. This exterior thought is what is meant by the thought nearest to the speech. This thought is excited and enkindled by natural love, which is the love of glory, honor, or gain, with those who are in falsities, and who confirm them from the sense of the letter of the Word. This, then, is what is signified by "the breath given to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast may speak," which signifies that in the doctrine of faith separated from life, when it is conjoined with the Word, there is something of spiritual life, and that in consequence an agreement flowed in from heaven into the thought nearest to the speech, excited and kindled by natural love.  [3] As the preceding article treated of spiritual love, which those have who are in the second heaven, and which constitutes their life, and as man does not know how love becomes spiritual, it shall be briefly told. All love becomes spiritual by means of truths from the Word in the measure in which man acknowledges them and sees them in his understanding and afterwards loves them, that is, does them from the will. Love becomes spiritual by means of truths from the Word in the measure in which man acknowledges them and sees them in the understanding, because there are two memories in man, and from these there are two kinds of thought both with the evil and the good, namely, an interior and an exterior. Every man thinks with himself from the interior memory when he is left to himself and is led by his love. This thought is the thought of his spirit. But man thinks from the exterior memory when he is speaking before the world. Everyone sees even by a little reflection that there are these two kinds of thought. The things that a man thinks with himself from the interior memory when left alone to himself, belong to his life, and come to be of his life; for it is his spirit that then thinks, or what is the same, it is the affection proper to his life that excites this thought. But the things that a man thinks from the exterior memory, when they do not make one with the thought of the interior memory, do not belong to his life and do not come to be of his life, for they belong to the body for the sake of the world; and these things also after death, when a man becomes a spirit, are cast away. From this it can be seen what the state is of those who are evil, and who fear neither God nor man, namely, that inwardly with themselves they think evils and falsities, while outwardly they think and speak truths and also do goods; but when a man puts off the body and becomes a spirit these goods and truths are scattered, but the evils and the falsities thence remain with him as a spirit. But it is otherwise with the good. Because these have feared God and have loved the neighbor, when they think from the interior memory they think from truths that are from good; in like manner as when they think from the exterior memory. With them these two kinds of thought make one. And as they are in truths from good, the internal spiritual man, which is in conjunction with angels in the heavens, and is in itself an angel of heaven, is opened with them; and as this is in the light of heaven, in which spiritual truths appear as clearly as objects in the world appear before the eye, when it sees truths it receives them and forms the understanding from them. From this such have spiritual faith, which is in its essence the acknowledgment of truth because it is seen in the understanding. Natural faith, which is to believe that a thing is so because another has said it, is to them no faith; this they call historical faith, and with some it is a persuasive faith, which is permanent only so far as it is in harmony with the love of their life. Who cannot see that nothing can enter the life of a man and constitute it except what he has first thought to be so and afterwards has willed that it should be so? From this it can be seen that if a man's love is to become spiritual he must see his truths, that is, must grasp them by the understanding.  [4] But if you say that spiritual truths cannot be seen, and that the understanding cannot be so far opened so long as man is in the world, let it be known that he who loves truth from truth, that is, because it is truth, can see spiritual truths; and those which he does not see in the world he sees afterwards in heaven. For it is the love itself of truth that receives the light of heaven, which enlightens the understanding. Moreover, everyone can receive in thought and can understand truths more than he himself knows, unless his own love induces obscurity and causes darkness. This has often been proved to me in the spiritual world. For evil spirits have understood spiritual truths when they have been uttered by anyone just as well as good spirits, and even almost like angels; but as soon as they turned their ear away and let themselves back into the state of their own love they understood nothing at all. From this it is clear that every man has the ability to understand truths, and even to see them; but that nothing except a love of truth for the sake of truths causes a man to understand them, in the world rationally, but after death spiritually.  [5] But love with man, and his life from it, do not become spiritual by merely knowing and understanding truths unless he also wills and does them. For, as has just been said, an evil man, whose love is infernal, can know and understand truths just as well as a good man whose love is heavenly; therefore the evil believe that because of their knowledges and their understanding of verities they will not only come into heaven but will also be among the intelligent there, of whom it is said that "they shall shine as the stars," and yet, if they do not also love, that is, will to do the truths that they know and understand, they come after death among those who are in hell, from whom all truths are taken away. For after death everyone comes to be his own love; and in the world everyone comes to be his own love by willing and doing according to his understanding and knowledge; for in these a man's love has its seat, and in the love the truths of the understanding have their seat; from which it is clear whence man has life, since it is the love that makes his life.  [6] There are three degrees of life with man, the third degree in which are the angels of the third heaven; the second degree in which are the angels of the second heaven; and the first degree in which are the angels of the first or ultimate heaven. There is also a lowest degree, which is corporeal and material, which man has while he lives in the world. These degrees are opened with man according to the reception of Divine truth in his life; and Divine truth is received in the life by willing and doing truth according to the knowledge and understanding of it. And as the love and the life of man make one, it follows that there are as many degrees of love as there are of life. The love in which the angels of the third heaven are is called celestial love; the love in which the angels of the second heaven are is called spiritual love; and the love in which the angels of the first heaven are is called spiritual-natural love, also celestial-natural. As their love is, such is their wisdom and intelligence. Those who are in the third degree of love and of wisdom thence live in an atmosphere as it were purely ethereal; those who are in the second degree of love and thence of intelligence live in an atmosphere as it were purely aerial; and those who are in the first degree of love and thence of knowledge live in an atmosphere as it were purely aqueous. And as the purity of their life is in a similar degree as their love, it is evident that those who are in the third heaven and in the love and life of that heaven cannot be approached by those who are in the second and first; for to ascend from the second heaven into the third would be like a bird's flying above its own atmosphere into the ether; and to ascend from the first heaven into the second would be like elevating a fish into the air, in which it would suffocate and suffer direful things. This has been said to make known that spiritual love is the love of truth in act; and that the love of truth in act is in accordance with the sight of truth in the understanding; and that the faith of that love is nothing else than the acknowledgment of truth from that sight and understanding. This, therefore, is spiritual faith. </p>

<p>And may cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast be killed, signifies threats of eternal death to those who do not believe everything and all things that are so established. This is evident from the signification of "to worship," as being to acknowledge and believe (see above, n. 790, 805, 821); also from the signification of " the image of the beast," as being the doctrine of faith separate, and a decree that all things and each thing therein established should be taught and believed (see just above, n. 827); also from the signification of "to be killed," as being to be killed spiritually, that is, to perish in eternal death (see above, n. 315, 589). From this it is clear that "to cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast be killed" signifies threats of eternal death to those who do not believe everything and all things that are so established. It is well known that this is so, for salvation, thus life eternal, is declared to all those who believe in that doctrine, and damnation and eternal death are denounced against those who do not believe. </p>

<p>As celestial love and spiritual love have been treated of, it now remains to say something about the spiritual-natural love in which are the angels of the first or ultimate heaven. This love is what is properly called charity towards the neighbor. As these angels are nearly alike in respect to the understanding as men in the world are, and as they are natural, their understanding is raised but little above what it was while they were in the world; therefore they do not see truths in the light as the angels of the second heaven do; but they receive, acknowledge, and believe truths from doctrine, in which they are instructed before they are admitted into heaven. For this reason only the more intelligent of them know what charity towards the neighbor is, the simple there believing that every man is the neighbor, and that charity is to assist the needy, and to do good to the poor, the sojourner, and so on. For the most part they consider persons and what they say, and not the interiors which are the source of what they say. This is so because they are natural; and a natural man does not think abstractedly from what his eyes see except to the extent that he admits light from heaven into his natural lumen. Nevertheless, those are there taught that "neighbor" does not mean in the Word a man merely in respect to person, but in respect to the quality in him that makes him to be such and such a man; also that the quality of a man is from his understanding and will, and the quality of his understanding is from truths, and the quality of his will is from goods, and the quality of both the understanding and the will is from his love. From this it is known that while every man is a neighbor, every man is a neighbor from his quality, and consequently that it is the quality of a man from which he is a man that is meant in the spiritual sense by "neighbor;" for otherwise a bad man would be as much a neighbor as a good man; and yet to do good to the evil is sometimes doing evil to the good. That this is so anyone can see from natural lumen. If you were to choose a helper or servant from those in your neighborhood, and ten were brought before your eyes from whom you were to choose one, would you choose from the face alone? Would you not choose from some quality that you love, as integrity, modesty, piety, uprightness? These you would consider as you looked upon them. It is similar in respect to the neighbor; it is the man's quality that is to be loved. From this it follows that the neighbor in the spiritual sense is that with a man which makes him be such and such a man. </p>

<p>Verses 16, 17. And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, that there be given them a mark upon their right hand or upon their foreheads; and that no one be able to buy or to sell if he hath not the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. 16. "And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond," signifies the lower and the higher, the wise and the simple, both those who think from themselves and those who think from others (n. 836); "that there be given them a mark upon their right hand and upon their foreheads," signifies an attestation of the acknowledgment that they are of the church, and are in the so-called truths and goods of that faith (n. 838). 17. "And that no one be able to buy or to sell if he hath not the mark of the beast," signifies forbidding anyone to learn or teach anything but what has been acknowledged and thence accepted in doctrine (n. 840); "or the name of the beast or the number of his name," signifies either what is like it in respect to life, or what is like it in respect to faith (n. 841). </p>

<p>Verse 16. And he causeth all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bond, signifies the lower and the higher, the wise and the simple, both those who think from themselves and those who think from others. This is evident from the signification of "all, the small and the great," as being the lower and the higher, or the more common and the more eminent; also from the signification of "the rich and the poor," as being the wise and the simple. (That those are called "rich" who possess many knowledges of good and truth, thus who are wise, may be seen above, n. 118, 236; and that those are called "poor" who have no knowledges of good and truth because they do not have the Word, and yet they desire them, may also be seen above, n. 118, 238.) So also from the signification of "the free and the bond," as being those who think from themselves and those who think from others. To think from oneself is to see from oneself whether a thing be true or false, and thus to choose the one and reject the other. These are they who are made spiritual by the Lord, and are thence in the light of heaven, and from the Lord they see and are led; for to think and live from the Lord is freedom; and to think and live from hell is bondage; that such are "the free" may be seen above (n. 248, 490, 701, 774); that the Lord makes them to be free by means of His Divine truth is declared in John (8:32-36). It may also be seen above (n. 820) that the church when it is in faith from love is in a free state, but when it is in faith without love is in a servile state, and that this is what is meant by the Lord's words in John (21:18). From this it follows that by "the bond" those are meant who think not from themselves but from others, and who do not see whether a thing is true or false and yet acknowledge it to be true. That such are "the bond," while those who think from themselves are "the free," is evident from the opposition of their relation. </p>

<p>As many things have been said about faith and works, I will now bring them together in a brief summary, as follows: (1) Every man after death comes to be his own love, and the spirit of man is nothing but the affection that is of his love; when therefore a man becomes a spirit he thinks and thence speaks from his affection; he also wills and thus acts from his affection; and he desires and imbibes the things that are of his affection or love, and those that do not belong to his affection or love he turns away from and rejects. And in fact, his face gradually becomes the face of his affection or love, from which he is then known, as he is also known from his speech, the tone of which is the tone of his affection. In a word, a man after death becomes his love or his affection in form; and consequently when anyone speaks against the affection which is of his love, or assaults it, his face is changed, and he himself goes away or suddenly vanishes. As all men after death are the substances and forms of their love, therefore the whole heaven, which consists of angels who have been men, is divided into societies according to the genera and species of the affections, thus according to all the differences and varieties of the affections. And hell, also, which consists of spirits who have been men, is divided into societies according to the affections opposite to heavenly affections, and according to all the differences and varieties of these in general and in particular. That man after death is his love, or his affection which is of the love, has been heretofore unknown in the world; for the world has believed that affection does nothing and that thought does everything; and for the reason that man has not been able to reflect upon the affections and the variations of them in himself, but only upon thoughts and their variations; for thoughts he sees inwardly in himself as it were, but not affections; and what does not reach the sight of his thought, and thus become manifest, is not considered by him. But whoever is wise can know his affections by his thoughts; for the affections manifest themselves in the thoughts whenever a man is in the freedom of his spirit and is alone with himself; for he then thinks from the affection which belongs to his love. Nor is thought anything else than affection made visible in various forms by the influx of light; therefore if you take away affection the thought immediately perishes, just as light does if you take away the flame. From this it is clear how important it is to acquire for oneself heavenly love or affection. How this is acquired shall be told in what follows. But it is to be known that by affection love in its continuity is meant.  (2) [2] That the whole life of man is the life of his love, and that the love and the life make one and are one with man, can be seen from what has been said above, namely, that everyone appears in the spiritual world with a face according to his love, that he speaks according to it, thinks, wills, desires, lusts, rejoices, and is sad, according to it, and these are the things that constitute his life, and that proceed from it. That this is so is clearly evident in the case of spirits and angels, who are all men both in face and in body; for as soon as the love of one of them is assaulted he vanishes with his whole body, even though he were sitting shut up in a room; and this I have frequently seen; and thus it was made clear that an angel or spirit is not only an affection in a human form, but also that his whole life from the head to the sole of the foot, or from cap to shoe, is nothing but affection which is of love; otherwise he could not have wholly vanished from the eyes of those sitting by him. When inquiry was made whether his corporeal form with its members is also affection which is of the love, it was found that each thing and all things of these were so; for the reason that the universal heaven, which, as has been said above, is divided and formed into societies according to all the differences and varieties of the affections, has a relation to one man, and from this all angels and spirits are human forms; therefore as heaven is a complex of all affections, so, too, is an angel and a spirit, who are least forms of heaven. This arcanum was thus made clear to me, and it was also confirmed from heaven, that all things and everything of man, both of his mind and of his body, are forms of love in a wonderful series, and that the organs of the brain and of the face, as also the members and viscera of the body, are perpetual contextures corresponding to those affections of heaven in which its societies are. And from this still another arcanum was made clear to me, namely, that the affections of the mind and the thoughts therefrom spread out and pour themselves forth into all things of the body, as into the field of their excursion and circumgyration, which field and circumgyration are from the affection of the mind and its thought into the uses from which, in which, and according to which, the members and viscera of the body are formed. For it is similar as with the affections and thoughts therefrom of the angels, in that they pour themselves forth in every direction into heaven and its societies; and according to their extension is the wisdom of the angels. (But on this see further in the work on Heaven and Hell, namely, that all angels are images of heaven, and thus are as it were heavens in the least form, n. 51-58; that the universal heaven has a relation to one man; and that thence angels and spirits are human forms, n. 59-102; that all thought from affection proceeding from angels has extension into the societies of heaven according to the quality of their love and wisdom, n. 200-212.)  (3) [3] Since love constitutes the life of man, and man is to live to eternity either in heaven or in hell in accordance with the life he has acquired in the world, it is a matter of the highest importance to know how man acquires heavenly love and becomes imbued with it, so that his life, which is to have no end, may be blessed and happy.  (4) [4] There are two chief faculties of man's life, namely, the will and the understanding. The will is the receptacle of all things of good, and the understanding is the receptacle of all things of truth from that good. Man cannot be reformed except by means of these two faculties of life, and only by their being filled by goods and truths. Reformation is effected in this order: first, man must fill the memory with knowledges and cognitions of truth and good, and by means of these he must acquire for himself the light of reason; especially be must learn that God is one, that the Lord is the God of heaven and earth, that there is a heaven and a hell, that there is a life after death, and that the Word is holy.  (5) [5] Next he must learn what evils are sins, first from the Decalogue, and afterwards from the Word everywhere, and must think that they are sins against God, and that they therefore withhold and separate man from heaven, and condemn and sentence him to hell. Consequently, the first thing of reformation is to refrain from sins, to shun them, and finally to be averse to them; but that he may refrain from them, shun them, and be averse to them he must pray to the Lord for help. But he must shun them and turn away from them because they are opposed to the Word, thus opposed to the Lord, and thence opposed to heaven, and because they are in themselves infernal.  (6) [6] So far as man shuns evils, and turns away from them because they are sins, and thinks about heaven, his salvation and eternal life, so far he is adopted by the Lord, and conjoined to heaven, and so far he is endowed with spiritual affection, which is such that he not only wishes to know truths, but also to understand them, and to will and do them.  (7) [7] Thus is man reformed by the Lord; and so far as he then knows and understands truths and wills and does them, so far he becomes a new man, that is, a regenerate man, and thus becomes an angel of heaven, and has a heavenly love and life. (8) [8] The love and life of such a one are wholly according to the works of his will; and the works of the will are according to the truths that are applied to the life. The knowledges of truth and good that a man has acquired for himself from infancy, and with which he has filled his memory, are not living in him until he begins to be affected by truths because they are truths, and begins to will and to do them. Until then they are only outside of the life of man. (9) [9] By good works are meant each and every thing that a man does after he has turned away from evils because they are sins against God; for then he no longer does good works or operates them from self but from the Lord. He then also learns daily what he is to do; and he has a clear discernment of goods and evils, and shuns evils and does good with prudence, intelligence, and wisdom. Thus much respecting the love, which constitutes the life of man. Something shall now be said respecting faith.  (10) [10] The ancients did not know what faith is; but in place of faith they had truth; for when truth is perceived or is seen in the understanding, and thus acknowledged, it is believed on its own account; consequently it cannot be said of it that faith must be had in it, since faith is in it. If, for example, one sees a tree and a flower in a garden, and another should say that he should believe or have faith that there is a tree and a flower there, and that it is such a tree and such a flower, would he not answer, Why do you wish me to believe or to have faith in this when I myself see it? This is why the angels of the third heaven, since they perceive truths from good, are unwilling even to mention faith, and in fact, do not know that it exists; and why angels of the second heaven, since they see truths from the light of truth by which their understanding is enlightened, do not acknowledge the word faith. They wonder and laugh when they hear anyone saying that the understanding is to be held captive under obedience to faith, and that one should have faith in what is not perceived and seen; and they say that in this way what is false may be believed, and by confirmations be placed as if in light, and truth itself as if in darkness; and thus falsity may play with truth as with a ball. (11) [11] When the world could no longer see truths from the love of them and from their light, because men had become natural and external, then faith began to be mentioned, and everything of faith began to be called truth, although it was not perceived or seen but only asserted by some leader and confirmed by passages of the Word not understood. This is the condition of the churches in the Christian world at this day, in every one of which the doctrinals of their faith are believed to be truths, and this for the sole reason that these are held by the church of their native land; and yet that it is not perceived or seen whether they are true is clear from the discussions, disputings, opinions, and heresies respecting them, in general and in particular, both public and private.  (12) [12] So long as faith was joined with works, and charity was acknowledged in an equal degree with faith, or above it, the church was in truths from the Word, but only in a few, because they did not see them. But as soon as faith was separated from charity the church fell from truths into falsities, and at length into a faith that has destroyed all the truths of the church. This faith is a faith in justification and salvation by the merit of the Lord with the Father. For if man is saved by this faith alone, and this faith also is separated from the goods of life, which are good works, what need is there of truths, which teach the way to heaven and lead to it? Live and believe in any way you wish, and merely hold that faith, and you will be saved. But let me tell you, my reader, that all who live that faith are in natural love separated from spiritual love; and natural love separated from spiritual love is the love of self and the world, and thus the love of all evils and of all falsities from evils; and that all who thus live are so empty and so blind that they do not even know and do not see a single genuine truth of the church in the Word, although they have it and read it; and many of them have no desire to know or see truth of any kind.  (13) [13] The reason for this is that there is no truth with man, still less any faith, unless he wills it and does it, for until then it is not a truth of the life, but only a truth of the memory, which is outside of man and not within him; and what is outside of him is dispersed. From this it is clear that faith without works is not faith-unless it be a faith in falsity from evil, which is a dead faith, such as reigns in hell. </p>

<p>That there be given them a mark upon their right hand and upon their foreheads, signifies an attestation of the acknowledgment that they are of the church, and are in the so-called truths and goods of that faith. This is evident from the signification of a "mark," as being a sign or attestation of acknowledgment, here that they are of that church; also from the signification of "right hand," as being the truth of faith in its power (see above, n. 298); also from the signification of "forehead," as being the good of love (see also above, n. 427). So here "the right hand and the forehead" signify the so-called truths and goods of that faith, which, nevertheless, are either not truths and goods or are falsities and evils. The acknowledgment of these as truths and goods however is signified by "giving and receiving a mark upon their right hand and upon their foreheads." A "mark" signifies a sign of acknowledgment also in the following passages in Revelation, 14:9, 11; 15:2; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4. Moreover, a "mark" has a similar meaning as:      The sign set by Jehovah upon Cain (Gen. 4:15);      Likewise the sign that the prophet was commanded to set upon the foreheads of the men in the city of Jerusalem (Ezek. 9:4);  as also the "sign" in Moses:      Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might. Thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets before thine eyes (Deut. 6:5, 8; 11:18). </p>

<p>It has been shown already that every man is his love, and that the love and life of man make one and are one. It shall now be shown that a man's faith is such as his love or life is, also that a man's faith is according to his works. It has been shown above that works contain in themselves all things of man's love and life, since works are their products and effects, and are the ultimates in which all things prior coexist. For this reason angels of the third heaven know what the quality of a man is by the tone of his speech, also by his step, by the touch of the hand, by the action of the body, by his exultation, and by many other things, which are acts. That a man is known in the third heaven by such things is not known in the world, because man believes that there is nothing in such things but mere motion; when yet the life of his mind produces these actions by means of the life of his body; and both of these lives, with everything pertaining to them, concur in the production of these acts, from which it follows that they manifest themselves in them. Since, then, a man's life goes forth into works, and manifests itself in them, it follows that his faith does the same; for faith is the acknowledgment that a thing is so, and acknowledgment is of the thought and at the same time of the will; and as will and thought produce action by means of the life of the body, so also faith is manifested in works as to its quality. And yet nothing is acknowledged to be so in thought, will, and work together, except what pertains to man's love and life, for it is his love and life that acknowledge; which shows that as faith is such as man's love and life are, so it is such as his works are.  [2] By works all things are meant that a man does, speaks, and writes, whether great and many or little and few; as whatever an officer does in his office, or whatever a priest does in his, or a merchant in his, or a servant in his; all such works, whether little or great, are good when they are done from the Lord with man, and are evil when they are done by the man himself; thus they are good so far as man shuns evils because they are sins against God, and they are evil so far as he does not shun evils. It is similar with faith; such as his works are such is his faith, for these make one like thought and speech or like will and action. Man supposes that even if he lives wickedly he can still have faith, at least to believe that there is a God, that the Lord is the Savior of the world, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that the Word is holy. But I can affirm that if he does not shun evils because they are sins, and then look to the Lord, he does not at all believe these things; since they are not of his life and love, but only of his memory and knowledge; and they do not come to be of his life and love until he fights against evils and overcomes them. This has been made clear to me by the state of many after death who supposed that they had believed at least that there is a God, and that the Lord is the Savior of the world, and other like things; and yet such as had lived wickedly had not believed. </p>

<p>Verse 17. And that no one be able to buy and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_419"></A><A HREF="#fn_419"><FONT SIZE="1">840-1</FONT></A> to sell if he hath not the mark of the beast, signifies forbidding anyone to learn and teach anything but what has been acknowledged and thence accepted in doctrine. This is evident from the signification of "to buy and to sell," as being to acquire knowledges to oneself and to communicate them to others, thus to learn and to teach (of which presently). "To cause no one to be able" signifies to forbid. It is evident also from the signification of a "mark," as being an attestation and sign of acknowledgment that those who are in these so-called truths and goods of that faith are of the church (see just above, n. 838). From this it is clear that "to cause that no one be able to buy and to sell save he that hath the mark of the beast" signifies forbidding anyone to learn and to teach anything but what has been acknowledged and also accepted in doctrine. "To buy and to sell" signifies to acquire for oneself the knowledges of truth and good from the Word and to communicate them, or what is the same, to learn and teach, because "wealth and riches" signify in the Word the knowledges of truth and good; and "silver and gold," by means of which buying and selling are conducted, signify the truths and goods of heaven and the church; and this is why "buying and selling," and also "doing business and trading," are spoken of in the Word here and there, and why they signify spiritual buying and selling, and doing business and trading.  [2] As in Isaiah:      Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that hath no silver, come ye, buy and eat; come, I say, buy wine and milk without silver and without price (55:1).  Everyone sees that by "buying wine and milk" is not here meant buying such things. And as "to buy" signifies to acquire for oneself such things as contribute to man's spiritual life, evidently the particulars here are to be spiritually understood; thus the "waters" to which everyone that thirsts may come signify truths for those that desire them; "waters," meaning truths from the Word, and "to thirst" meaning to desire them; that these are given freely from the Lord is signified by "he that hath no silver," also by "without silver and without price;" "to eat" signifies to appropriate to oneself; "wine and milk" signify spiritual truth and natural truth therefrom, both from good.  [3] In Matthew:      The prudent virgins said to the foolish, Go ye rather to them that sell, and buy oil for yourselves; but while they went away to them to buy the bridegroom came (25:9, 10).  "The prudent virgins" signify those in the church with whom faith is conjoined to charity, and "the foolish" signify those in the church with whom faith is separated from charity; for "lamps" signify the truths of faith, and "oil" signifies the good of love; therefore "to go to them that sell and to buy" signifies to those who teach, and to learn or acquire for oneself. But as such had not acquired for themselves the good of love, and vivified by that means the truths of faith, while they lived in the world, but had acquired them afterwards, and as no one can acquire for himself the good of love after death and retain it, so these foolish virgins, by whom all who separate the good of love or the good of charity from the truths of faith are signified, were not admitted to the marriage feast nor received by the bridegroom. "The marriage feast" signifies heaven, and "the bridegroom" the Lord.  [4] In the Gospels:      Jesus entered into the temple, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of them that sold doves (Matt. 21:12; Mark 11:15; Luke 19:45).  "Those that sold and bought" here signify those who make gain for themselves out of holy things; the "tables of the money-changers" signifies those who do this from holy truths; and the "seats of them who sold doves" those who do it from holy goods; therefore it is afterwards said that they made the temple "a den of thieves," "thieves" meaning those who pillage the truths and goods of the church, and thus make to themselves gain.  [5] In Luke:      As it came to pass in the days of Lot, so shall it be in the days of the Son of man, they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded (17:28).  "To eat and drink" signifies here to live for self and the world, and to appropriate to oneself evils and falsities; "to buy and sell" signifies to acquire these and to communicate them to others; "to plant and build" signifies to confirm oneself in these, and to live in them.  [6] In the same:      Jesus said, Now he who hath a purse let him take it, and likewise a wallet; but he that hath no sword let him sell his garments and buy one (Luke 22:36). What is meant by these words is evident from what follows there, namely, that "this which was written must be fulfilled in the Lord" (verse 37), thus that He was to suffer the cross; and since this must needs distract the minds of those who were then living, as well as the minds of the disciples, and lead them into doubts respecting the Lord and His kingdom, and thus into temptations, and these doubts could be dispelled only by means of truths, therefore the Lord says, "he that hath a purse and a wallet let him take them," that is, he that possesses truths from the Word, in which it is foretold that Christ must suffer such things, let him take heed not to lose them; for the purse and the wallet have a similar signification as the coins and money in them, namely, the knowledges of truth and good from the Word. "But he that hath no sword let him sell his garments and buy one," signifies let those who have no truths reject what is their own, and acquire the truths with which they may fight against falsities, "sword" signifying the combat of truth against falsity, and the destruction of falsity.  [7] As "Tyre" signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, and thence also the knowledges of truth and good which belong to the church, and which are serviceable for its doctrine, so where "Tyre" is treated of in the Word, her "tradings" are also treated of, which signify the acquisition and also the communication to others of these knowledges, as in Ezekiel:      All the ships were for the trading of thy traffic; Tarshish was thy trader in silver, iron, tin, and lead; they traded for thy merchandise. Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, these were thy merchants; they traded for the merchandise with the soul of man and with vessels of brass. The sons of Dedan were thy merchants, many islands were the merchants of thy hand. Syria was thy trader with chrysoprasus. But thy riches and thy tradings, thy merchandise, and they who trade thy traffic, shall fall into the heart of the seas in the day of thy fall (27:1, to the end).  In Isaiah:      Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is devastated, whose merchants are princes, her traders the honored of the earth (23:1, 8).  Everyone can see that tradings and merchandise here do not mean tradings and merchandise; for what has the Word, which in itself is Divine and heavenly, and teaches man about God, heaven and the church, eternal life, and the like, in common with such things? Therefore who cannot see that all the particulars here signify spiritual things which pertain to heaven and the church, not only the names of the lands here mentioned with which trading was carried on, but also their special kinds of merchandise? But it would take too much space to explain here what the particulars in the spiritual sense signify; it is enough to know that "tradings" here signify the acquisition and communication of the knowledges of truth and good; and that "merchandise or wares" signify these knowledges; which are multifarious.  [8] That this is the signification is evident also from these words in Ezekiel:      In thy wisdom and in thine intelligence thou hast made to thyself wealth; and hast made gold and silver in thy treasures; by the abundance of thy wisdom in thy trading thou hast multiplied to thyself wealth (28:4, 5). This treats of the prince of Tyre, by whom the knowledges of truth from the Word, through which come intelligence and wisdom, are meant; and as these same knowledges are signified by "wealth," and the acquisition of them by "trading," it is said, "by the multiplication&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_420"></A><A HREF="#fn_420"><FONT SIZE="1">840-2</FONT></A> of thy wisdom in thy trading thou hast multiplied to thyself wealth."  [9] From all this it can now be seen why:      The Lord compared the kingdom of the heavens to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it (Matt. 13:45, 46).  "Pearls" signify knowledges, and also truths themselves; and "the one of great price" signifies the acknowledgment of the Lord; and "to sell all that he had" signifies to set aside all things that are of one's own love, and "to buy it" signifies to procure for oneself that Divine truth.  [10] The like is meant by:      The treasure hidden in a field, which a man having found hid, and for joy he went and sold all things whatsoever that he had and bought the field (Matt. 13:44).  The "treasure" signifies the Divine truth that is in the Word; and the "field" signifies the church and its doctrine; and "to sell all things whatsoever that he had and buy the field" signifies here as above, to set aside what is one's own and to acquire for oneself the Divine truth that is in the Lord's church.  [11] As "trading" signifies the acquisition and possession of truths, the Lord spake by a parable:      Of a man going on a journey, who gave to his servants talents, that they might trade with them and make gain (Matt. 25:14-30); and of another:      Who gave to his servants ten pounds, that they might trade with them (Luke 19:12-26).  "To trade," "tradings," and "traders," have the same signification elsewhere in the Word; also the contrary sense, in which they signify the reception and appropriation of falsities (as in Isa. 48:15; Ezek. 16:3; Nahum 3:14; Rev. 18:3, 11-24). So the church in which such things exist is called:      A land of trading (Ezek. 16:29; 21:30, 31; 29:14).  Moreover, "to sell" and "to be sold" signify to alienate truths and to be alienated from them, and to accept falsities in their place, and to be captivated by them (Isa. 50:1; 52:3; Ezek. 30:12; Joel 3:6, 7; Nahum 3:4; Zech. 13:5; Ps. 44:11-13; Deut. 32:30). From this can be seen what is properly signified by "being redeemed and redemption," where the Lord is treated of; as in Isaiah:      Ye have sold yourselves for nought; therefore ye shall be redeemed without silver (52:3);  and in many passages elsewhere. </p>

<p>Or the name of the beast, or the number of his name, signifies either what is like it in respect to life or what is like it in respect to faith. This is evident from the signification of "name," as being the quality of the good of love and of life therefrom; also from the signification of "number," as being the quality of the truth of faith and of intelligence therefrom; so "the number of a name" signifies the quality of the truth of faith and the intelligence thence from the quality of the good of love and its life; but here in the contrary sense, because it is said "the name of the beast, or the number of his name." That "name" signifies in the Word the quality of anyone in respect to good or to love, thus in respect to life, may be seen above (n. 102, 135, 148, 676, 695, 696, 815); and that "number" signifies the quality of the thing that is treated of, and that the quality is determined by the numbers that are added, may also be seen above (n. 429, 430, 574); thus it signifies the quality of the truth of faith; also that "to number" signifies to know the quality of a thing, and to arrange and to dispose according to it (n. 453). "Number" signifies the quality of truth and thence of faith, because number involves multitude; and in the Word "multitude" is predicated of truths (see above, n. 336, 337). So now "the number of the name" signifies the quality of truth from good, that is, the quality of faith from love; but because the beast is here treated of it must here be understood in the contrary sense. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="842.">842.</A></FONT></span>
<p>As faith and works have been treated of above I will draw from these the following conclusion: that love, life, and works make one in every man, so that whether you say love, or life, or works, it is the same. It has been shown above that love constitutes the life of a man, and that his life is such as his love is, not only the life of the mind, but at the same time the life of the body. And since that which a man loves he also wills with the mind and does with the body, it follows that love and deeds or works make one. There are many things to show that works proceed from both the internal and the external life of man, and that they are the activities of the sphere of the affections and of the thoughts therefrom by which he is encompassed, and that no communication of man's life and love is possible unless the encompassing sphere, which is of his life, becomes active by doing; consequently such as the life is, or such as the love is, or such as the works are, with man, such are all the things of which that sphere is composed, and in consequence such also is the faith. So if the works are evil it follows that there is no faith of truth, but only a faith of falsity; for evil and falsity cling together, but not evil and truth. But if the works are good it follows that there is a faith of truth, for good and truth mutually love each other, and join themselves together. But if a man's works appear good in external form, and yet he is interiorly evil, it follows that he has a faith in falsity, however much he may talk about truth with the mouth, for the truth is contaminated with evil from within; and thus his deeds are according to the description of them by the Lord:      They are like the cleansed outside of the cup and the platter, whose inside is full of extortion and excess; and are like unto whited sepulchers which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of the bones of the dead and all uncleanness (Matt. 23:25, 27, 28). </p>

<p>Verse 18. Here is wisdom. He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six. 18. "Here is wisdom," signifies that this is their doctrine in all its complex, which is thought to be wisdom, although it is insanity (n. 844). "He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast," signifies that those who are in enlightenment may inquire into the quality of the faith of that religion (n. 845); "for it is the number of a man," signifies its quality, as if it were from the understanding of truths such as the men of the church must have (n. 846); "and his number is six hundred sixty-six," signifies that its quality, nevertheless, is from all falsities and all evils therefrom in the complex (n. 847). </p>

<p>Verse 18. Here is wisdom, signifies that this is their doctrine in all its complex, which is thought to be wisdom, although it is insanity. This is evident from the signification of "here is wisdom," as being that all those things that have been said of the dragon and his two beasts is the doctrine of those who have separated faith from life, which however is not wisdom, as it is reputed, but insanity. That this is the meaning of "here is wisdom" follows from what precedes, that "no one is able to buy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_421"></A><A HREF="#fn_421"><FONT SIZE="1">844-1</FONT></A> and sell save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name," which signifies that no one should learn or teach anything else but what had been acknowledged, and thus accepted in doctrine. From this it can be concluded that "wisdom" here means wisdom in their own eyes; which, nevertheless, is insanity appearing to them to be wisdom. Insanity is meant by "wisdom," because those who are in falsities, when they have confirmed their falsities believe themselves to be wiser than others. The evil do the like when they are in their evils and are contriving devices by which they may do evil to the good; they then appear to themselves to be ingenious, yea even wiser than others, and yet before the eyes of angels they appear crazy. And this is why their insanity when they are in falsities is called in the Word "wisdom and intelligence," as in the following passages:      O Lord God, Thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and hast revealed them unto babes (Matt. 11:25; Luke 10:21).      Woe to the wise in their own eyes, and the intelligent before their own faces (Isa. 5:21).      I will visit upon the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria and upon the splendor of the exaltation of his eyes; for he hath said, In the power of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; because I was intelligent (Isa. 10:12, 13).      Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the wise of the counselors of Pharaoh; how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise (Isa. 19:11).      The wisdom of his wise men shall perish, and the intelligence of his intelligent shall hide itself (Isa. 29:14).      He casteth the wise men backward (Isa. 44:25).      A sword against the inhabitants of Babylon, and against her princes, and against her wise ones (Jer. 50:35).      This is why the magi in Babylon and elsewhere were called wise men (Dan. 2:48).  From this it is clear that wisdom is predicated in the Word also of those who are not wise, also of those who are insane from falsities, like as "diadems" are attributed to them (as to the dragon, Rev. 12:3, and to his beast in the first verse of this chapter); and it is said of the woman who sat on the scarlet beast:      That she was arrayed in purple and scarlet, gilded with gold, adorned with precious stones and pearls (Rev. 17:4).  Likewise the evil are called "strong" and "mighty," when in fact they are anything but strong and mighty (see above, n. 783). </p>

<p>He that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast, signifies that those who are in enlightenment may inquire into the quality of the faith of that religion. This is evident from the signification of "having intelligence," as meaning to be in enlightenment (of which presently); also from the signification of "to count," as being to inquire into. "To count" signifies to inquire into because in the two senses of the Word, namely, in the literal sense and in the spiritual sense, words are used in agreement with their subjects; that is, "to count" is predicated of number, and to inquire into is predicated of the quality of faith. Also from the signification of "the number of the beast" as being the quality of the faith of this religion. That "number" signifies the quality of faith, may be seen above (n. 841), also that "the beast" signifies faith separated from life, which is the faith of that religious principle. From this it is clear that "he that hath intelligence let him count the number of the beast" signifies that those who are in enlightenment may inquire into the quality of the faith of that religion. Those who are in enlightenment are to make the inquiry because the quality of the faith of that religion can be seen and thus can be inquired into by no others. For everything of the Word by which inquiry must be made and from which there can be judgment is in the light of heaven, and therefore can be seen only from that light, and it is that light which enlightens man; therefore to inquire into the quality of the faith of any religion which has been confirmed by some passages of the Word can be done only by one who is in the light of heaven, consequently who is in enlightenment. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="846.">846.</A></FONT></span>
<p>For it is the number of a man, signifies its quality, as if it were from the understanding of truths such as men of the church must have. This is evident from the signification of "number," as being the quality of faith (see above, n. 841); also from the signification of "man," as being the understanding of truth that men of the church have in matters of faith (see above, n. 280, 546, 547), here as if it were from the understanding; for faith separated from the life is a faith in falsity, thus without truth and an understanding of it; therefore it is similar here in regard to the signification of "man" as in regard to the signification of "wisdom" above (n. 844), which means, as if it were wisdom although it is insanity.  [2] Moreover, those who are in faith separated from charity shut out the understanding, demanding obedience to a faith not understood, and that the faith understood is man's own faith, and thus is natural and not spiritual. But what the quality of intellectual faith is shall be told. The Word in its spiritual sense treats in many passages of the understanding of the Divine truth in the Word; and where it describes the desolation of the church it treats also of the destruction of the understanding of its Divine truths from the Word; and from a collection of passages on that subject, carefully investigated in respect to their interior meaning, it is clear that so far as the understanding of truth perishes in the church, so far the church perishes. Moreover, the understanding of the Word is signified in many passages by "Egypt," "Assyria," "Israel," and also "Ephraim;" "Egypt" signifying the natural understanding of it, "Assyria" the rational understanding; "Israel" the spiritual understanding, and "Ephraim" the understanding itself of the Word in the church. But in order that man may see and perceive from enlightenment the genuine truths of the Word, these three degrees of understanding, the natural, the rational, and the spiritual, must be together; for the natural understanding, which is the lowest, cannot be enlightened by its own lumen, but must be enlightened by the light of the rational man, which is intermediate, and this by spiritual light; for the spiritual understanding is in the light of heaven and sees by it, and the rational is intermediate between the spiritual and the natural, and receives spiritual light and transmits it to the natural and enlightens it. This shows that the natural understanding without light through the rational from the spiritual is no understanding, for it is without light from heaven; and the truths of the church, which are also truths of heaven, can by no means be seen except in the light of heaven; the reason is that Divine truth proceeding from the Lord as a sun is the light of heaven, and the Lord enlightens man by His own light only, which is spiritual light.  [3] From this it is clear that the Lord wishes man both to know the truths of His church and also to understand them; not, however, from natural light separated from spiritual light; for natural light separated from spiritual light, in the things of heaven or in spiritual matters, is not light but thick darkness. For man, from natural light separated from spiritual light, views the things of the church from self and not from the Lord, and consequently he can see them only from appearances and fallacies; and to see them from these is to see falsities for truths, and evils for goods. The fire that propagates and enkindles that light is the love of self and the consequent pride of self-intelligence. Man who thinks from that fire and that light so far as he excels in genius and thence in the ability to confirm whatever he pleases, so far he is able to so confirm falsities and evils as to make them appear to be truths and goods, and can even set forth falsities and evils in a resplendent natural light, which is, nevertheless, a delusive light that has been thus exalted by art. But to apprehend church matters by this light is not to understand them, but rather to not understand them, since by that light alone man sees truths as falsities, and falsities as truths. This is especially so when any accepted dogma is assumed to be the truth itself, with no previous investigation whether it be true or not; or if investigated is investigated only through what has been established by reasonings from the natural man, and by confirmations from the Word not understood. When a man views all the dogmas of his religion in this way he can assume as a principle whatever he pleases, and can so impart to it the light of confirmation as to make it to appear to be a truth from heaven, although it is a falsity from hell.  [4] From this it can be concluded that the understanding of the truths of the church means the understanding of them that is enlightened by the light of heaven, thus by the Lord. The man who is in that enlightenment is able to see the truths of the church rationally in this world, and spiritually after death. But to enter into church matters, which are interiorly spiritual and celestial, from natural lumen separated from spiritual light, which is the light of heaven from the Lord, is to proceed by an inverse order, since what is natural cannot enter into what is spiritual, but what is spiritual can enter into what is natural. For there can be with man no natural influx (called also physical influx) into the thoughts and intentions of his spirit; but there can be spiritual influx, that is, of the thoughts and intentions of the spirit into the body and into its actions and sensations. </p>

<p>And his number is six hundred sixty-six, signifies that its quality nevertheless is from all falsities and all evils therefrom in the complex. This is evident from the signification of "number," as being the quality of faith separated from the life; also from the signification of "six hundred sixty-six" as being all falsities and all evils therefrom in the complex. This is the signification of that number, because "six" signifies all things, and is predicated of truths and of goods therefrom, and in the contrary sense of falsities and of evils therefrom; for that number is composed of the numbers two and three multiplied together, and the number two is predicated of goods, and in the contrary sense of evils; and the number three of truths, and in the contrary sense of falsities; and a composite number has a similar signification as the simple numbers of which it is composed. This, then, is why "six" signifies all truths and all goods therefrom in the complex, and in the contrary sense all falsities and all evils therefrom in the complex. That all these may be signified to the full, that number is tripled; and by triplication the number 666 arises. For a thing triplicated signifies completeness and fullness from beginning to end; so here it signifies that nothing whatever of truth and good remains.  [2] That every number in the Word signifies something pertaining to a thing or state, and that its quality is determined by the numbers added, may be seen above (n. 203, 429, 574, 841). That larger numbers composed of the smaller have a similar signification as the smaller and simple numbers from which they arise by multiplication may be seen above (n. 430); thus the number six hundred sixty-six has a similar signification as six, and six the like as three and two, from which it arises by multiplication. That three signifies fullness, completeness, altogether, and all things from beginning to end, and is predicated of truths and falsities, may be seen above (n. 532); and that two is likewise predicated of goods and evils (n. 532, at the end). Again, six has a similar signification as twelve, because twelve arises from the multiplication of three by four; and four, like two, is predicated of goods and also of evils. From this it is clear that the number "six hundred sixty-six," which is said to be "the number of a man," and "to count" which is said to be a matter of intelligence, signifies the quality of faith separated from good works, that it is composed of all falsities and of all evils therefrom in the complex. Its being said to be a matter of intelligence to count that number does not signify that it is a matter of intelligence to know or find out the signification of that number, but that it is a matter of intelligence to inquire into and see the falsities and evils that make up the quality of faith separated from life.  [3] That the quality of that faith is such in respect to falsities will be seen in what presently follows. It is also such in respect to evils because when good works are set aside (and they are set aside when it is believed that they contribute nothing at all to justification or salvation), it follows that evil works take their place; for a man must be either in goods or in evils. That he cannot be in both together is meant by these words of the Lord:      No one can serve two masters; he will either hate the one and love the other.... Ye cannot serve God and mammon (Matt. 6:24). Therefore all evils in the complex follow from a faith that sets aside good works, which are the goods of life. Moreover, every religion has life as its end; for it teaches the evils that must be shunned, and the goods that are to be done. A religion that does not have life as its end, consequently a religion in which it is taught that the works of life are of no account, but faith alone, cannot be called a religion; and where this is taught, are not all evils of life permitted so far as they are not forbidden and restrained by the civil laws, since faith alone covers, remits, and takes them away? That this is so can be seen from this, that faith alone is said to justify the life; and yet it is taught that man is not saved by any good of life, also that he may be saved by this faith even in the last hour of death, also that he is justified at the same moment that he receives this faith, with other like things, which altogether persuade that life is not the end of that religion. And if religion does not have life as its end it follows that it must give loose reins to evils of every kind.  [4] That those who are in that faith both in doctrine and in life have all falsities in the complex is clear from the claim that this faith is the only justifying or saving faith, namely, that the Father sent the Son that He might reconcile to Him the human race by the passion of the cross and by thus taking away damnation. But it has been shown above what the quality of this faith is, and what there is in it of truth and untruth; and anyone can see that in this faith there is nothing except thought, and nothing of life; for it is said that if we believe this with trust and confidence, that is, if we acknowledge it in thought, we are saved. If in this faith alone there is salvation what need is there of knowing what love to the Lord is, what charity towards the neighbor is, what the life of man is, what the goods and evils of life are, what remission of sins is, what reformation and regeneration are? Are not all these this faith alone? If it be asked what remission of sins is, is it not this faith alone? If it be asked what charity towards the neighbor is, is it not this faith alone? If it be asked what the church is, is it not this faith alone? So in the rest. It is clear, therefore, that this faith alone has absorbed, and has swallowed up like a dragon, all the goods and truths of the Word, and thus of the church, although these are innumerable, and through these the angels have all their intelligence and wisdom, and men have all their salvation.  [5] As all the truths and goods of the church have been banished by means of this faith alone, it follows that falsities and evils therefrom have taken their place, and as a consequence the church is devastated. Yea, by means of this truth that man of himself can do no good that is good, all the truths and goods of the church are cast aside, as if this made it permissible for man to refrain from doing them, because if they are not good they are rather damnable than saving. And it is wonderful that through a single truth wrongly understood all the truths and goods of the church in the whole complex should have been cast aside. This is what is signified in the spiritual sense by "the number of the beast, six hundred sixty-six."      Revelation 14       1. And I saw, and behold a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred forty-four thousand having the name of His Father written upon their foreheads.       2. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard a voice of harpers harping with their harps.       3. And they were singing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four animals and the elders: and no one was able to learn the song save the hundred forty-four thousand, those bought from the earth.       4. These are they that were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. These were bought from among men, first fruits to God and the Lamb.       5. And in their mouth was found no guile; for they are spotless before the throne of God.       6. And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people,       7. Saying with a great voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment is come; and adore Him who made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.       8. And another angel followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon that great city, for she hath given all nations to drink of the wine of the anger of her whoredom.       9. And a third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If anyone have adored the beast and his image, and have received his mark on his forehead or on his hand,       10. Even he shall drink of the wine of the anger of God, mixed with unmixed wine in the cup of His wrath; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb;      11. And the smoke of their torment shall go up unto the ages of the ages; and they shall have no rest day and night that adore the beast and his image, and if anyone have received the mark of his name.      12. Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.      13. And I heard a voice from heaven, saying to me, Write, Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works do follow with them.      14. And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud One sitting like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_422"></A><A HREF="#fn_422"><FONT SIZE="1">847-1</FONT></A>  and in his hand a sharp sickle.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_423"></A><A HREF="#fn_423"><FONT SIZE="1">847-2</FONT></A>      15. And another angel went out from the temple, crying out with a great voice to Him that sat on the cloud, Send Thy sickle and reap, for the hour for thee to reap is come, for the harvest of the earth is dried up.      16. And He that sat upon the cloud cast His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped.      17. And another angel went out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle;      18. And another angel went out from the altar, having authority over the fire; and he cried with a great cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vineyard&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_424"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">847-3</FONT></A> of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripened.      19. And the angel cast his sickle into the earth and gathered the vineyard of the earth and cast it into the great wine-press of the anger of God.      20. And the wine-press was trodden without the city; and there went out blood from the wine-press even unto the bridles of the horses, for a thousand six hundred stadia. </p>

<p>EXPOSITION. Verse 1. And I saw, and behold a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred forty-four thousand having the name of His Father written upon their foreheads. 1. "And I saw," signifies a manifestation respecting the future separation of the good from the evil before the Last Judgment (n. 849); "and behold a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion," signifies the presence of the Lord in heaven and in the church for separating the good from the evil and for executing judgment (n. 850); "and with Him a hundred forty-four thousand," signifies according to truths in the whole complex (n. 851); "having the name of His Father written upon their foreheads," signifies these according to the acknowledgment of His Divine, from love (n. 852). </p>

<p>Verse 1. And I saw, signifies a manifestation respecting the future separation of the good from the evil before the Last Judgment. This is evident from the signification of "I saw," as being the things seen by John, which now follow; these, regarded in the spiritual sense, treat of the calling together and assembling of the faithful, and their separation from the evil before the Last Judgment; and this is meant by the Lord by these words in Matthew:      They shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory; and He shall send His angels and shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other (24:30, 31). That chapter treats also of the Last Judgment, which is there meant by "the consummation of the age and the coming of the Lord." The gathering together of the good and their separation from the evil is there described by those words, as well as in this chapter (verses 14, 16), where the Son of man is described as sitting upon a white cloud with a sickle in His hand reaping the earth.  [2] Similar things in this chapter are meant also by these words of the Lord in Matthew:      The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man that sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares and went away. But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares. And the servants came and said, Wilt thou then that going we gather them up? But he said, Nay, lest haply while ye gather up the tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them. Rather let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn (13:24-30). Here the separation of the good from the evil, which was to take place at the time of the Last Judgment, is foretold by the Lord, and is meant by "Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Collect the tares to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn." The "tares" mean the evil, who will then be cast into hell, and the "wheat" means the good, who having been separated from the evil will be raised up into heaven. Similar things are meant in this chapter where it is said:      The hour for thee to reap is come; for the harvest is dried up. And he that sat upon the cloud cast in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped (verses 15, 16, and what follows). Why the good were not separated from the evil previous to the time of the Last Judgment, and the good raised up to heaven and the evil cast into hell, can be seen in the work on The Last Judgment, and also above (n. 391, 392, 394, 397, 411, 413, 418, 419, 426, 4891/2, 493, 497, 668, 669, 670, 674, 675, 676, 754). </p>

<p>And behold a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion, signifies the presence of the Lord in heaven and in the church for separating the good from the evil and for executing judgment. This is evident from the signification of "Lamb," as being the Lord as to the Divine Human (see above, n. 297, 314, 343, 460, 482); also from the signification of "standing," as meaning to be present and to be conjoined (of which presently); also from the signification of "the Mount Zion," as being heaven and the church, where the Lord reigns by His Divine truth, as can be seen from the passages in the Word where "Mount Zion" is mentioned. But first something shall be said about the Lord's presence in heaven and in the church, for separating the good from the evil and for executing judgment. The presence of the Lord is perpetual in the whole heaven and in the whole church; for heaven is not heaven from what is the angels' own [proprium] in it, nor is the church a church from what is men's own [proprium] in it, but from the Divine of the Lord with them. For an angel's own [proprium] cannot make heaven, nor a man's own [proprium] the church, since the own [proprium], both of angels and of men, is not good. Consequently it is the Divine that goes forth from the Lord, as received by them, that makes heaven and the church in particular with each one, and thus makes heaven and the church in general in all in whom heaven and the church exist. Thence it is evident that the presence of the Lord is perpetual with all who are in heaven and in the church; but it is a presence that is peaceful, tranquil, preserving, and sustaining, by which all things in the heavens and on the earth are held constantly in their order and connection, or are reduced to that order; so, too, in the hells. But the presence that is meant here by "standing upon the Mount Zion" is the unusually active presence of the Lord, for the purpose of effecting an inflow of His Divine through the heavens into the lower parts, that the good there may be separated from the evil, and the evil be cast down from their places where they had formed for themselves a semblance of heavens. But this presence and conjunction of the Lord with the heavens and His consequent influx into the lower parts to effect the judgment has been treated of above (n. 413, 418, 419, 426, 4891/2, 493, 702, 704). It is this presence that is signified elsewhere by "standing," when attributed to the Lord (as in Isaiah 3:13). From all this it can be seen that "behold a Lamb standing on the Mount Zion" signifies the presence of the Lord in heaven and in the church, for separating the good from the evil and for executing judgment.  [2] "Mount Zion" signifies heaven and the church where the Lord reigns by His Divine truth, for the reason that Zion was a city built by David, and in which he afterwards dwelt, and was therefore called "the city of David," and as "David" represented the Lord in respect to His royalty, which is the Divine truth, "Zion" signifies in the Word heaven and the church, where the Lord reigns by His Divine truth. For the same reason the ark of Jehovah, in which the law was deposited, was carried into that city by David; for that law also signifies in a broad sense Divine truth going forth from the Lord. And for the same reason Jerusalem, which lay below that mountain, signifies the church in respect to doctrine; for every doctrine of the church is from the Divine truth that goes forth from the Lord, consequently is from the Word. That city was built upon a mountain for the reason that at that time mountains, because of their height, represented the heavens, and thence also in the Word signify the heavens. The ground of this representation and consequent signification is that the highest heavens, in which are the angels of the third degree, appear at a height above the rest, and before the eyes of others like mountains; and as the highest heavens appear like mountains, and the angels who are upon them are in love to the Lord, so "mountains," and especially "Mount Zion," signify in the Word love to the Lord. (That a "mountain" signifies love see above, n. 405, 510.)  [3] That "Zion" signifies heaven and the church, in which the Lord reigns by His Divine truth, can be seen from the following passages. In David:      I have anointed My king upon Zion, the mountain of My holiness. I will declare the decree, Jehovah hath said unto Me, Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee. I will give the nations for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy possession. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way, for His anger will shortly burn forth. Happy are all they that trust in Him (Ps. 2:6-8, 12). This evidently was not said of David, but of the Lord, for it is said, "Thou art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee. I will give the nations for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy possession;" also "Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way; Happy are all they that trust in Him;" nothing of which can be said of David. Therefore "to anoint a king upon Zion, the mountain of holiness," signifies the Lord's rule in heaven and in the church by means of Divine truth. (What "to be anointed" and "one anointed" signify, in reference to the Lord, may be seen above, n. 375.) "King" signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truth, "Zion" heaven and the church, and "to declare the decree" His coming; "Thou art, My Son, this day have I begotten Thee," signifies the Divine Human, which also is the Son of God; that He has all power in the heavens and on earth is meant by "I will give the nations for Thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for Thy possession;" that there must be conjunction with Him by love that there may be salvation is signified by "Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and ye perish in the way." The Last Judgment by Him is signified by "His anger will shortly burn forth;" that those who have faith in Him will then be saved is signified by "Happy are all they that trust in Him." All this makes evident that "Zion" means heaven and the church, where the Lord reigns by means of His Divine truth.  [4] Likewise in Zechariah:      Exult greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold thy king cometh unto thee; He is just and a Deliverer; meek and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the son of an ass (9:9). That this was said of the Lord and of His kingdom in the heavens and on earth, which kingdom is meant by "Zion" and by "Jerusalem," is evident in the Gospels, where this, when it is fulfilled, is related:      Jesus sent two disciples that they might bring to Him an ass and her colt. This was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, sitting upon an ass, and upon a colt, the son of a beast of burden (Matt. 21:1, 2, 4, 5; John 12:14, 15). That "riding upon an ass and upon a foal of an ass" was a sign of royalty, and therefore the Lord so rode when He entered Jerusalem, and He was therefore called King by the multitude crying aloud, and branches of palm trees and garments were strewn upon the way before Him (verses 7-9), may be seen above (n. 31), and as the Lord thus entered Jerusalem as a King it is evident that "Zion" means heaven and the church, in which the Lord reigns by means of His Divine truth. That the kings of Judah and Israel represented the Lord as to the Divine truth, and that consequently "kings" mean those who are in truths from good from the Lord can be seen above (n. 31, 553, 625); and that especially David represented in the Word the Lord as to royalty, which is the Divine truth (n. 205). [5] In Isaiah:      O Zion, proclaimer of good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O Jerusalem, proclaimer of good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God! behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength (40:9, 10). As this is said of the Lord and of His Kingdom, and this is signified by "Zion and Jerusalem," it is said that "Zion and Jerusalem should proclaim it as good tidings," Zion from good of love, and Jerusalem from truths of doctrine. To proclaim good tidings from good of love is meant by "getting up into a high mountain;" and proclaiming good tidings from truths of doctrine is meant by "lifting up the voice with strength;" "the cities of Judah" signify the doctrine of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor in the whole complex. The Lord as to the Divine truth and the Divine good, who was to come and execute judgment, is meant by, "Behold your God! behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in strength;" for the Lord is called "God" in the Word from Divine truth, and "Jehovah," and also "Lord Jehovih," from Divine good; and "to come in strength" is to execute judgment, and thus to subjugate the hells.  [6] In Micah:      In the end of the days it shall be that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established in the head of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come and say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us of His ways and that we may go in His paths; for from Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. Then shall He judge among many nations, and shall reprove numerous nations, even afar off. Jehovah shall rule in Mount Zion from henceforth even forever. Thou, O tower of the flock, O hillside of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall come and shall return the former kingdom, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem (4:1-3, 7, 8). Anyone can see that the coming of the Lord and of His kingdom in the heavens and in the earth are here described; therefore His kingdom, which is heaven and the church, is meant by "the mountain of the house of Jehovah" that will then be established in the head of the mountains. And as "Zion" means heaven and the church in which the Lord is to reign by His Divine truth, while "Jerusalem" means heaven and the church as to doctrine from that Divine truth, it is said, "from Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem." The instruction of all from the Lord is described by what then follows.  [7] In Isaiah:      Cry out and sing for joy, O inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee (12:6). In the same:      The redeemed of Jehovah shall return to Zion with singing, and the joy of eternity shall be upon their head (35:10). In Zephaniah:      Sing for joy, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and exult with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem; Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments; He hath overturned thine adversary. Jehovah is in the midst of thee (3:14, 15). In Zechariah:      Sing for joy and be glad, O daughter of Zion; for lo, I come that I may dwell in the midst of thee; and many nations in that day shall cleave to Jehovah. I will dwell in thee (2:10, 11).   In the same:      I will return to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; whence Jerusalem shall be called the city of truth, and the mountain of Jehovah, the mountain of holiness (Zech. 8:3).   In David:      Who shall give in Zion the salvation of Israel? When Jehovah shall bring back the captivity of his people Jacob shall exult and Israel shall be glad (Ps. 14:7; 53:6). In Isaiah:      The Lord Jehovih shall lay in Zion for a foundation a tried stone, a precious corner stone of a well-founded foundation; he that believeth shall not make haste. Then I will set judgment for a rule and justice for a plummet; your covenant with death shall be abolished, and your vision with hell shall not stand (28:16-18). In the same:      In that day a present unto Jehovah of Hosts shall be brought, a people distracted and plundered, from a terrible people, to the place of the name of Jehovah of Hosts, to Mount Zion (Isa. 18:7).  In the same:      I have made near My justice, it is not far off, and My salvation shall not tarry; I will place salvation in Zion, My adornment for Israel (Isa. 46:13). In the same:      Then a Redeemer shall come to Zion (Isa. 59:20). These passages treat of the Lord's coming and of His kingdom in the heavens and on the earth, and as that kingdom is meant by "Zion and Jerusalem" it is said that they shall come thither, and that Jehovah the Holy One and the King of Israel shall dwell there; "Jehovah the Holy One and the King of Israel" meaning the Lord as to Divine truth. This makes clear that "Zion" means heaven and the church, in which the Lord reigns by Divine truth, and "Jerusalem" heaven and the church as to doctrine from that Divine truth. Who does not see that Zion and Jerusalem, to which the nations should be brought back, and where the Lord should dwell, do not mean Zion and Jerusalem where the Jewish nation was? [8] It can also be seen from the following passages that "Zion" means heaven and the church, in which the Lord reigns by Divine truth. In Isaiah:      Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and those of her that are brought back in justice (1:27). In the same:      He that is left in Zion and he that remaineth in Jerusalem shall be called holy to Him, everyone that is written unto life in Jerusalem. Jehovah will create over every dwelling of Mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud by day and a smoke and the shining of a flame of fire by night (Isa. 4:3, 5). In the same:      Jehovah of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, and before His elders shall be glory (Isa. 24:23). In the same:      Jehovah, who hath His fireplace in Zion, and His oven in Jerusalem (Isa. 31:9). In the same:      Jehovah is exalted, for He dwelleth on high; He hath filled Zion with judgment and justice. Look upon Zion, the city of our set feast; let thine eyes see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be destroyed (Isa. 33:5, 20). In the same:      The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee; she hath laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head after thee, because thou hast blasphemed and reviled the Holy One of Israel (Isa. 37:22, 23). In David:      That I may recount all Thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion (Ps. 9:14).      The sides of the north, the city of the great King; God is known in her streets (Ps. 48:2, 3). In the same:      Encompass ye Zion, and encircle her, number her towers, set your heart to her bulwarks, examine her palaces; and ye shall tell to the generation following that this God is our God forever and ever; He will lead us (Ps. 48:11-14). In the same:      In Salem is the tabernacle of God, and his dwelling place in Zion (Ps. 76:2). In the same:      The Lord hath chosen the tribe of Judah, the mountain of Zion which He hath loved (Ps. 78:68). In the same:      Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. Glorious things are to be spoken in thee, O city of God; Jehovah shall count when He describeth the peoples, This one was born there. All my fountains are in thee (Ps. 87:2, 3, 6, 7). In the same:      When Jehovah shall bring back the captivity of Zion, then shall our mouth be filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing (Ps. 126:1, 2). In the same:      Jehovah shall bless thee out of Zion, that thou mayest see the good of Jerusalem all the days of my&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_425"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">850-1</FONT></A> life; that thou mayest see the sons of thy sons, peace upon Israel (Ps. 128:5, 6). In the same:      Jehovah hath chosen Zion, He hath desired it for a seat for Himself; this is My rest forever, here will I dwell, for I have desired it (Ps. 132:13, 14). In the same:      Jehovah shall bless thee out of Zion (Ps. 134:3).  In the same:      Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, who dwelleth in Jerusalem (Ps. 135:21). In the same:      Jehovah shall reign forever thy God, O Zion, in generation and generation (Ps. 146:10). In the same:      Let the sons of Zion exalt in their king; let them praise His name in the dance; let them sing psalms with timbrel and harp (Ps. 149:2, 3). These passages respecting Zion are quoted that everyone may see that in the Word "Zion" does not mean Zion, but heaven and the church where the Lord reigns by means of His Divine truth. Most of these are also prophetic of the Lord, that when He came He would love Zion and dwell there forever; and yet He did not love that city nor Jerusalem, as is evident from His words respecting them; but He loved heaven and the church, where He is received through His Divine truth. This is why Zion is called "His rest," "His dwelling place," "the mountain of Jehovah," "the city of God," "the city of the great King," "the city of truth," and it is said that His kingdom shall be there "to eternity," "forever," and "to generation and generation;" none of which things could by any means be said of the Zion of David, or be meant by it. [9] As the Lord came into the world to execute judgment, and thereby reduce all things in the hells and in the heavens to order; and as judgment is effected by Divine truth, since this, according to reception, is what makes man spiritual, and according to its laws, which are the Divine commandments in the Word, all judgments are effected in the spiritual world, so the Lord assumed the Human, and during His life in the world made it Divine truth, to the end that He might execute judgment, as has been said. That the Lord made His Human Divine truth is meant in John by:      The Word that was with God, and that was God, and by which all things were made that were made, and by which the world was created (1:1, seq.). "The Word" means Divine truth. That the Lord became Divine truth as to His Human is clearly stated as follows:      And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only-begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth (John 1:14). The Lord as to Divine truth is also meant by "the Son of man," as the Lord frequently calls Himself in the Gospels; of whom He also says that judgment is to be wrought by Him. Since, then, the Lord executed judgment by His Divine truth, and since "Zion" means heaven and the church, in which the Lord reigns by His Divine truth, it is said in this chapter of Revelation, which treats of the separation of the good from the evil before the Last Judgment, that "a Lamb was seen standing upon the Mount Zion," which signifies the presence of the Lord in heaven and in the church for separating the good from the evil and for executing judgment, as has been said above.  [10] Because "the mount of Zion" has the same signification elsewhere in the Word, it is said that the Lord will fight from Mount Zion for the church against the evil, and will destroy them; as in the following passages. In Isaiah:      Jehovah of Hosts shall come down to fight upon the mount of Zion and upon the hill thereof (31:4). This, too, treats of the coming of the Lord and of the redemption or deliverance of the faithful; therefore "to fight upon the mount of Zion and upon the hill thereof" signifies to execute judgment by Divine truth, by which judgment is executed because all are judged according to their reception of it; since Divine truth, or the Word and doctrine therefrom, teach life, and everyone is judged according to the life.  [11] In David:      Jehovah will send help for thee out of the sanctuary, and will sustain thee out of Zion. We will sing of thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners. I know that Jehovah saveth His anointed; He answereth him from the heaven of His holiness with the might of the salvation of His right hand (Ps. 20:2, 5, 6). This, too, was said of the Lord and of His victory over the hells, and the consequent salvation of men. Combats and victories are meant by "answering His anointed from the heaven of His holiness with the might of the salvation of His right hand," and the salvation of the faithful thereby is meant by "His sustaining us out of Zion," and by "singing of His salvation."  [12] In the same:      Jehovah shall speak, and shall call the earth from the rising of the sun even unto its going down. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shall shine forth, our God shall come. He shall cry out to heaven above and to the earth to judge His people. Gather My saints together unto Me (Ps. 50:1-5). This plainly treats of judgment upon all from Zion, that is, from the Lord by the Divine truth. The separation of the good from the evil is meant by "He shall call the earth from the rising of the sun to its going down." Judgment upon all is meant by "He shall cry out to heaven above and to the earth to judge the people." The gathering together of the good and their salvation is meant by "gather My saints together unto Me." Divine truth, in which the Lord is in His glory, is meant by "Out of Zion the perfection of beauty God shall shine forth."  [13] In the same:      The saying of Jehovah to my lord, Sit thou at My right hand, until I make thine enemies a stool for thy feet. Jehovah shall send to thee the staff of thy strength out of Zion; rule thou in the midst of thine enemies (Ps. 110:1, 2). The words of the Lord Himself in Matthew (22:44) show that this was said of the Lord. "To sit at the right hand" signifies the Lord's Divine omnipotence; "to make his enemies a stool for his feet" signifies the complete subjugation and surrender of the hells; "the staff of strength out of Zion" signifies Divine truth, which is omnipotent, "Zion" meaning heaven, where the Lord reigns by His Divine truth. His rule over the hells by means of it is signified by "rule thou in the midst of thine enemies." That omnipotence belongs to the Lord alone, and this He has by His Divine truth, may be seen above (n. 726). That truths have all power from good, and that good and truth therefrom are from the Lord, may also be seen above (n. 209, 338, 716, 776, 783). [14] In Isaiah:      Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion; put on the garments of thy beauty, O Jerusalem, the city of holiness (52:1). As "Zion" signifies heaven, where the Lord reigns by His Divine truth, and as Divine truth has all power, it is said, "Awake, awake, put on thy strength, O Zion." Doctrine therefrom is signified by the "garments of beauty" that Jerusalem will put on.  [15] In Joel:      Jehovah shall roar out of Zion, and shall utter His voice from Jerusalem, that the heavens and the earth may shake. Then shall ye know that I am Jehovah, dwelling in Zion the mountain of My holiness, and that Jerusalem is holiness; no strangers shall pass through her any more (3:16, 17, 21). In Amos:      Jehovah shall roar out of Zion, and utter His voice from Jerusalem (1:2). "To roar," and the "roaring of a lion," when predicated of Jehovah, signify an ardent zeal for protecting heaven and the church, and for saving those who are therein by the Divine truth and its power, which is done by destroying the evils and falsities that rise up out of hell (see above, n. 601), and as "Zion" signifies heaven where the Lord reigns by the Divine truth, and "Jerusalem" signifies doctrine therefrom, it is clear what is signified by "Jehovah shall roar out of Zion, and shall utter His voice from Jerusalem." That the Lord is present where He reigns by His Divine truth, both with the angels of heaven and with the men of the church, is signified by "ye shall know that I am Jehovah, dwelling in Zion, the mountain of My holiness." That there shall be no falsities of evil there is signified by "no strangers shall pass through her," "strangers" being the falsities of evil.  [16] In Isaiah:      The day of vengeance of Jehovah, the year of retribution for the controversy of Zion (34:8). "The day of vengeance of Jehovah and the year of retribution" signifies the Last Judgment, and the condemnation of those who through falsities and evils have laid waste all the truths of the church; which is what is meant by the words "for the controversy of Zion." In David:      Jehovah is great out of Zion, and He is high above all the peoples, the king's strength (Ps. 99:2, 4). Here Zion is called "the king's strength" from the Divine truth which has power itself.  [17] In the same:      O Jehovah, Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion, for it is time to pity her, for the set time is come; for Thy servants desire the stones thereof, and pity the dust thereof, that the nations may fear the name of Jehovah, and all the kings of the earth Thy glory; because Jehovah hath built up Zion, and hath appeared in His glory. The name of Jehovah shall be declared in Zion, and His praise in Jerusalem, when the peoples shall be gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve Jehovah (Ps. 102: 13-16, 21, 22). This treats of the Lord's coming and of the redemption of the faithful by Him. His coming is signified by "the time to pity her," and by "the set time;" truths that are to be restored and truths that have been restored are signified by the "stones" which the servants desire; the establishment of the church and the worship of the Lord from Divine truths is described by what follows.  [18] The devastation of the church by the Jewish nation, by this that they had falsified every Divine truth, is also described throughout the Word by the vastation of Zion. As in Isaiah:      The cities of Thy holiness are become a wilderness; Zion is become a wilderness, and Jerusalem a waste (64:10). In Lamentations:      The precious sons of Zion, esteemed equal to pure gold, how are they reputed as earthenware bottles, the work of the hands of the potter (4:2 to the end; likewise in Isa. 3:16-26; Jer. 6:2; Micah 3:10, 12; and elsewhere). "The virgin" and "the daughter of Zion" are mentioned in many places, as in the following: 2 Kings 19:21; Isa. 1:8; 3:16, 17; 4:4; 10:32; 16:1; 37:22; 52:2; 62:11; Jer. 4:31; 6:2, 23; Lam. 1:6; 2:1, 4, 8, 10, 13, 18; 4:22; Micah 1:13; 4:8, 10, 13; Zeph. 3:14; Zech. 2:10; 9:9; Ps. 9:15; Matt. 21:5; John 12:15; and elsewhere. "The daughter of Zion" signifies the spiritual affection for the Divine truth, which is the love of truth for the sake of truth, and the desire for it for the sake of the uses of eternal life. From all this it is now evident what is signified by "the Lamb was seen standing upon the Mount Zion," namely, that in what here follows the separation of the good from the evil for the execution of judgment is treated of. </p>
