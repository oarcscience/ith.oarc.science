### Apocalypse Explained

<span class="margnote"><span id="601.">601.</span></span>

Verse 3. And cried out with a great voice, as a lion roareth, signifies
the testification of grievous distress on account of the desolation of
Divine truth in the church. This is evident from the signification of
"crying out with a great voice," as being the testification of grievous
distress (of which presently); and from the signification of "as a lion
roareth," as being on account of the desolation of Divine truth in the
church; for a "lion" signifies Divine truth in its power (see above, n.
278), and "to roar" signifies the result of distress because of the
desolation of truth. \[2\] That this is the signification of "crying out
with a great voice, as a lion roareth," can be seen from what follows in
this chapter, where the desolation of Divine truth in the church is
treated of; for "a strong angel coming down out of heaven" means the
Lord in relation to the Word, which is Divine truth, of whom it is said
afterwards that "the angel lifted up his hand to heaven, and sware by
Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages, that there shall be time no
longer," which signifies that there shall be no longer any understanding
of Divine truth, and thence no state of the church. \[3\] And afterwards
it is said, "In the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery
of God shall be finished," which signifies the Last Judgment that was to
come when there should be no faith in Divine truth because there would
be no good of charity. From this it can be seen that "He cried out with
a great voice, as a lion roareth," signifies the testification of
grievous distress on account of the desolation of Divine truth in the
church. \[4\] Moreover, a "lion" is often mentioned in the Word; and in
the highest sense a "lion" signifies the Lord in relation to Divine
truth, likewise heaven and the church in respect to Divine truth from
the Lord; and from this a "lion" signifies Divine truth in respect to
power (see above, n. 278). This makes evident what "to roar" or "the
roaring of a lion" signifies, namely, an ardent affection for defending
heaven and the church, and thus for saving the angels of heaven and the
men of the church, which is done by destroying the falsities of evil by
means of Divine truth and its power; but in the contrary sense "to roar"
or "the roaring of a lion" signifies an ardent desire to destroy and
devastate the church, which is done by destroying Divine truth by means
of the falsities of evil. Such is the signification of a "lion's
roaring," because when a lion is hungry and seeks its prey, and also
when it is enraged with anger against its enemy, it is its habit to
roar. \[5\] That this is the signification of "to roar" and "roaring" in
the Word can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: Thus
Jehovah said unto me, Like as the lion, and the young lion roareth over
his prey, when a multitude of shepherds goeth out against him, and he is
not dismayed at their voice nor affected by their tumult, so shall
Jehovah of Hosts come down to wage war upon Mount Zion and upon the hill
thereof (31:4). Jehovah is compared to a lion roaring, because a "lion"
signifies the Lord in relation to Divine truth and its power, and "to
roar" signifies the eagerness to defend the church against evils and
falsities; therefore it is said, "so shall Jehovah of Hosts come down to
wage war upon Mount Zion, and upon the hill thereof," "Mount Zion"
meaning the celestial church, and "the hill thereof" (or Jerusalem) the
spiritual church; the "prey over which the lion roareth" signifies
deliverance from hell. \[6\] In Joel: Jehovah shall roar out of Zion,
and shall give forth His voice from Jerusalem, and the heavens and the
earth shall quake; but Jehovah shall be a shelter for His people, and a
stronghold for the sons of Israel (3:16). The protection of the faithful
by the Lord by means of Divine truth is described by "Jehovah shall roar
out of Zion, and shall give forth His voice from Jerusalem;" the
vehement power of Divine truth, and consequent terror, are described by
"the heavens and the earth shall quake;" and salvation and protection by
"Jehovah shall be a shelter for His people, and a stronghold for the
sons of Israel;" "the people of Jehovah" and "the sons of Israel" being
the faithful who are of the church. \[7\] In Hosea: I will not return to
destroy Ephraim. They shall go after Jehovah; He shall roar like a lion,
for He shall roar, and sons from the sea shall draw near with honor,
with honor shall they come as the bird out of Egypt and as the dove out
of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell upon their houses
(11:9-11). "Ephraim" signifies the church in respect to the
understanding of truth, concerning which therefore what follows is said.
"To go after Jehovah" signifies to worship the Lord and to live from
Him; "He shall roar like a lion, for He shall roar," signifies the
protection of such by the Divine truth; "the sons from the sea shall
draw near with honor," signifies that those who are in natural good
shall draw near to the church; "with honor shall they come as a bird out
of Egypt," signifies their natural thought from true knowledges
\[scientifica\]; the "bird" meaning thought, and "Egypt" knowledge,
which is natural truth; "and as the dove out of the land of Assyria,"
signifies that they shall have rational good and truth, a "dove" meaning
rational good, and "the land of Assyria" the church in respect to
rational truth; for in man there are both natural and rational good and
truth; the natural is lower or exterior, looking to the world, the
rational is higher or interior, conjoining the natural with the
spiritual; the natural is meant by "Egypt," the rational by "Assyria,"
and the spiritual by "Israel." "To make them to dwell upon their houses"
signifies life from the will of good and from the understanding of
truth; the human mind, which consists of these, is meant by a "house,"
and "to dwell" signifies to live. \[8\] In Amos: The Lord Jehovih will
not do <span id="fr_259"></span>[601-1](#fn_259.md) a word unless He shall
reveal His secret unto His servants the prophets. The lion hath roared,
who will not fear? The Lord Jehovih hath spoken, who will not prophesy?
(3:7, 8). "The Lord Jehovih will not do a word unless He hath revealed
His secret to His servants the prophets" signifies that the Lord opens
the interior things of the Word and of doctrine to those who are in
truths from good; "to reveal a secret," signifies to enlighten and to
open the interior things of the Word; "His servants the prophets"
signify those who are in the truths of doctrine and who receive; "the
lion hath roared, who will not fear?" signifies a powerful revelation
and manifestation of Divine truth; "the Lord Jehovih hath spoken, who
will not prophesy?" signifies its reception and manifestation. The Lord
is called "Lord Jehovih" when good is treated of. \[9\] In Zechariah:
The voice of the howling of the shepherds that their magnificence is
devastated; the voice of the roaring of the young lions that the pride
of Jordan is devastated (11:3). "The voice of the howling of the
shepherds that their magnificence is devastated" signifies the grief of
those who teach, because the good of the church has perished; those are
called "shepherds" who teach truth and by truth lead to the good of
life, and "magnificence" means the good of the church; "the voice of the
roaring of the young lions that the pride of Jordan is devastated"
signifies grief, because of the desolation of Divine truth in the
church. Those are called "lions" who are in Divine truths; "roaring"
signifies grief; "the pride of Jordan, which is devastated," signifies
the church in respect to Divine truth which introduces. \[10\] In Job:
God roareth with His voice; He thundereth with the voice of His majesty;
nor yet doth He overthrow when His voice is heard; God thundereth
marvelously with His voice (37:4, 5). "To roar" and "to thunder with the
voice" signify the power and efficacy of Divine truth or the Word.
\[11\] In the passages that have been cited, "to roar" signifies in a
broad sense the ardent affection of protecting heaven and the church, or
the angels of heaven and the men of the church, which is done by
destroying the falsities of evil by means of Divine truth and its power.
But in the contrary sense, "to roar" signifies an eager cupidity for
ruining and destroying the church, which is done by destroying Divine
truth by means of the falsities of evil. In this sense "to roar" is used
in the following passages. In Jeremiah: Babylon shall become heaps, the
abode of dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing. They shall roar
together like lions; they shall growl like lions' whelps; when they are
heated I will set <span id="fr_260"></span>[601-2](#fn_260.md) their
feasts, and I will make them drunken that they may exult and may sleep
the sleep of an age and not awake (51:37-39). The destruction of Babylon
so that there may be in it no truth or good, is signified by "Babylon
shall become heaps, the abode of dragons, an astonishment, and an
hissing." "Babylon" signifies those who abuse holy things for the sake
of dominion; their eager cupidity for destroying Divine truth by means
of the falsities of evil is signified by "they shall roar together like
lions, they shall growl like lions' whelps." The eagerness of those who
unite in doing this crime is signified by "when they are heated I will
set their feasts;" that such will become insane from the falsities of
evil is signified by "I will make them drunken that they may exult."
That they will never understand anything of truth, and therefore will
not see life, is signified by "that they may sleep the sleep of an age
and not awake." \[12\] In the same: Is Israel a servant? Is he one born
of the house? Why has he become a prey? The young lions roar against
him, they give forth their voice, they reduce his land to a waste; his
cities are burned, even so that there is no inhabitant (Jer. 2:14, 15).
"Is Israel a servant? Is he one born of the house?" signifies the church
that had been in truths and goods, but is so no longer. "Israel"
signifies the church; a "servant" those who are in truths, and "one born
of the house," those who are in goods; "why has he become a prey?"
signifies its devastation; "the young lions roar against him, they give
forth their voice" signifies the desolation of Divine truth in the
church by the falsities of evil; "they reduce his land to a waste"
signifies the destruction of the church itself by evils; "his cities are
burned even so that there is no inhabitant" signifies the destruction of
the doctrinals also of the church by evils, so that there is no good of
the church left. \[13\] In Ezekiel: One of the whelps of the lioness
grew up, it became a young lion, and it learned to tear the prey; it
devoured men. It ravished widows and devastated their cities, and the
land was devastated <span id="fr_261"></span>[601-3](#fn_261.md) and the
fullness thereof by the voice of his roaring (19:3, 7). This is said of
the Jewish Church, which is here meant by "the mother of lions." A
"young lion" signifies the falsity of evil in eagerness to destroy the
truth of the church; "to tear the prey" signifies the destruction of the
truth and good of the church. "It devoured men, it ravished widows, and
devastated cities," signifies the destruction of all the understanding
of truth and of good desiring truth, likewise of doctrinals; "men"
signifying the understanding of truth, "widows" good desiring truth, and
"cities" doctrinals; "the land was laid waste and the fullness thereof
by the voice of his roaring" signifies the devastation of the church and
the extinction of all truth from the Word by the falsity of evil, "land"
meaning the church, "fullness" its truths from the Word, and "the voice
of roaring" the falsity of evil destroying. \[14\] In Jeremiah: I call
for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the land. Therefore say unto
them, Jehovah shall roar from on high, and give forth His voice from the
abode of His holiness; in roaring He shall roar against their
habitations; a tumult cometh even to the end of the earth; for Jehovah
hath a controversy against the nations. He shall enter judgment with all
flesh, He shall give the wicked to the sword (25:29-31). The vastation
of the church is attributed to Jehovah, although men are the cause of
it. "I call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the land" signifies
falsity destroying every truth in the universal church. "Jehovah shall
roar from on high, and give forth His voice from the abode of His
holiness," signifies the testification of grief in heaven on account of
the vastation of Divine truth. "In roaring He shall roar against their
habitations" signifies great grief and lamentation over all things of
the church; "a tumult cometh even to the end of the earth" signifies the
disturbance of all things of the church from first to last; "for Jehovah
hath a controversy against the nations, He shall enter judgment with all
flesh," signifies visitation and judgment upon all who are in evils; "He
shall give the wicked to the sword" signifies their destruction by
falsities. \[15\] In Amos: Jehovah shall roar from Zion, and give forth
His voice from Jerusalem; that the habitations of the shepherds may
mourn, and the head of Carmel dry up (1:2). "Roaring from Zion"
signifies grievous distress, and "the voice from Jerusalem" lamentation;
"the mourning of the habitations of the shepherds, and the drying up of
the head of Carmel," signifies because of the vastation of all the goods
and truths of the church; "the habitations of shepherds" signifying all
the goods of the church; "the head of Carmel" all its truths, and
"mourning" and "drying up" vastation. "The head of Carmel" signifies the
truths of the church, because in Carmel there were vineyards, and "wine"
signifies the truth of the church. \[16\] In Isaiah: The anger of
Jehovah is kindled against His people. He hath lifted up an ensign to
the nations from far, and hath hissed to him from the end of the earth.
His roaring is like that of a lion, He roareth like young lions; He
growleth and seizeth the prey, he shall snatch and none shall deliver,
and he growleth against him like the growling of the sea; and if He
shall look unto the earth, behold darkness and distress, and the light
is darkened in the ruins thereof (5:25-30). Here, too, "the roaring like
that of a lion, and like that of young lions," signifies grief and
lamentation over the vastation of Divine truth in the church by the
falsities of evil. "He seizeth the prey and none shall deliver"
signifies the deliverance and salvation of those who are in truths from
good. The vastation itself is described by "behold darkness, distress,
and the light is darkened in the ruins thereof;" "darkness" meaning
falsities; "distress" evil; "the darkening of the light" the
disappearance of Divine truth, and "ruins" total overthrow. \[17\] In
David: The enemy hath destroyed all things in the sanctuary; the
adversaries have roared in the midst of thy feast (Ps. 74:3, 4). "The
enemy" signifies evil from hell; "the sanctuary" the church, and "feast"
worship. This makes clear what is signified by these words in series.
That roaring signifies grievous lamentation from grief of heart can be
seen from these passages. In David: When I kept silence my bones waxed
old through my roaring all the day (Ps. 32:3). In the same: I am
weakened and crushed exceedingly; I have roared by reason of the roaring
of my heart (Ps. 38:3). And in Job: My sighing cometh before bread, and
my roarings are poured out like the waters (3:24).

<span class="margnote"><span id="602.">602.</span></span>

And when he cried out the seven thunders spake their voices, signifies
instruction from heaven and perception respecting the last state of the
church. This is evident from the signification of "speaking the voices,"
as being to instruct, here from heaven, because it is said "the seven
thunders spake;" also from the signification of "the seven thunders," as
being Divine truth in respect to understanding and perception (see
above, n. 273). The thunders are said to be "seven," because "seven"
signifies all things and fullness, and is used when things holy are
treated of (see above, n. 20, 24, 257, 300). It was the last state of
the church about which John was instructed from heaven by voices like
thunder, since that state is treated of in this chapter, as is evident
from the words that follow: "In the days of the voice of the seventh
angel, when he is about to sound, the mystery of God shall also be
finished; as He hath declared the good tidings to His servants the
prophets" (verse 7); and that teaching shall go on in the church until
that state, which is the end, shall come, is meant by the last words of
this chapter, "Thou must prophesy again over many peoples and nations
and tongues and kings" (verse 11). From this it can be seen that "the
seven thunders spake their voices" signifies instruction from heaven and
perception respecting the last state of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="603.">603.</span></span>

Verse 4. And when the seven thunders had spoken their voices I was about
to write, signifies that he wished to disclose that state. This is
evident from the signification of "when the seven thunders had spoken
their voices," as being instruction from heaven and perception
respecting the last state of the church (see just above, n. 602); and
from the signification of "I was about to write," as meaning to wish to
disclose, "to write" evidently meaning to disclose.

<span class="margnote"><span id="604.">604.</span></span>

And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up the things which
the seven thunders spake, and write them not, signifies command by the
Lord that these things should be reserved and not yet be disclosed. This
is evident from the signification of "to hear a voice from heaven," as
being a command by the Lord, which is, "write them not;" also from the
signification of "to seal up the things which the seven thunders spake,"
as being that these things in which he was instructed, and which he
perceived respecting the last state of the church, were to be kept
secret and reserved; also from the signification of "write them not," as
being that they must not yet be disclosed (see just above, n. 603). That
"to seal up" means to keep secret and to reserve until another time can
be seen from what follows in this book; for what follows treats of the
middle state of the church, which intervenes between the sounding of the
sixth and of the seventh angel, that is, between next to the last state
of the church and the last, therefore the things that are to take place
in the last state are what must be reserved and not yet disclosed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="605.">605.</span></span>

Verses 5-7. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the
earth lifted up his hand to heaven. And he sware by Him that liveth unto
the ages of the ages, who created heaven and the things that are
therein, and the earth and the things that are therein, and the sea and
the things that are therein, that time shall be no more. But in the days
of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, the
mystery of God shall also be finished, as He hath declared the good
tidings to His servants the prophets. 5. "And the angel whom I saw
standing upon the sea and upon the earth," signifies the Lord, to whom
all things of heaven and the church are subject (n. 606); "lifted up his
hand to heaven," signifies bearing witness before angels respecting the
state of the church (n. 607). 6. "And he sware by Him that liveth unto
the ages of the ages," signifies the verity from His Divine (n. 608);
"who created heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and
the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are
therein," signifies the Lord in respect to all things of heaven and the
church, interior and exterior (n. 609); "that time shall be no more,"
signifies that there shall be no longer any understanding of Divine
truth, nor any state of the church therefrom (n. 610). 7. "But in the
days \[of the voice\] of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound,"
signifies the last state of the church and revelation at that time of
Divine truth (n. 611); "the mystery of God shall also be finished, as He
hath declared the good tidings to His servants the prophets," signifies
prediction in the Word respecting the Lord's coming, to be fulfilled
when the end of the church is at hand (n. 612).

<span class="margnote"><span id="606.">606.</span></span>

Verse 5. And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the
earth, signifies the Lord, to whom all things of heaven and the church
are subject. This is evident from the signification of "the angel coming
down from heaven," as being the Lord (see above, n. 593); and from the
signification of "standing upon the sea and upon the earth," as being to
whom all things of heaven and the church are subject (see also above, n.
600), since "standing upon them" signifies that they are subject to Him.
Thus in David: Thou madest Him to have dominion over the works <span
id="fr_262"></span>[606-1](#fn_262.md) of Thy hands; Thou hast put all
things under His feet (Ps. 8:6). This is said of the Lord; His dominion
over all things of heaven and the church is meant by "all things are put
under His feet." And in Isaiah: I will make the place of My feet
honorable (60:13). "The place of the Lord's feet" in a general sense
means all things of heaven and the church, since the Lord as a sun is
above the heavens; but in a particular sense "the place of His feet"
signifies the church, for the Lord's church is with men in the natural
world, and the natural is the lowest, into which the Divine closes, and
upon which it as it were subsists. This is why the church on the earth
is also called "the footstool of the Lord," as in the same: The earth is
My footstool (Isa. 66:1; Matt. 5:35). Also in Lamentations: He hath cast
down from the heavens unto the earth the splendor of Israel, and doth
not remember His footstool (2:1). And in David: We will come into His
tabernacles, we will bow down at His footstool (Ps. 132:7). This is said
of the Lord, and "His footstool" signifies the church on the earth.
\[2\] From this it can be seen that "to stand upon the sea and upon the
earth" signifies in reference to the Lord that all things of heaven and
the church are subject to Him. But "sea and earth upon which He set His
feet," signify in particular the lowest heaven and the church on earth,
as has just been said; for the higher parts of the body belonging to an
angel signify the higher heavens, because they correspond to them; for
the inmost heaven corresponds to the head, and the middle heaven to the
breast down to the loins, and the ultimate heaven to the feet, but the
church on the earth to the soles of the feet, consequently the church is
meant by "His footstool." From this correspondence it can be concluded
what the "angel (by whom is meant the Lord) standing upon the sea and
upon the earth" represented in general and in particular, namely, that
He represented the universal heaven; for the Lord is heaven, and His
Divine Human forms heaven to an image of itself. This is why the whole
heaven is in the sight of the Lord as one man, and corresponds to all
things of man, therefore heaven also is called the Greatest Man.
(Respecting this see what is said in the work on Heaven and Hell, n.
59-102.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="607.">607.</span></span>

And lifted up his hand to heaven, signifies bearing witness before the
angels respecting the state of the church. This is evident from the
signification of "to lift up the hand to heaven," as being bearing
witness before the angels; that it means respecting the state of the
church is evident from what follows. That bearing witness before the
angels is what is here signified by "lifting up the hand to heaven" may
be concluded from this, that bearing witness is expressed by raising the
hands to heaven; also from this, that "he sware by Him that liveth unto
the ages of the ages that time shall be no more," as immediately
follows, and "to swear" is an expression of bearing witness, and the
"time that shall be no more" means the state of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="608.">608.</span></span>

Verse 6. And he sware by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages,
signifies the verity from His own Divine. This is evident from the
signification of "to swear," as being a strong assertion and
confirmation, and in reference to the Lord the verity (of which
presently); also from the signification of "Him that liveth unto the
ages of the ages," as being the Divine from eternity, which alone lives,
and which is the source of life to all in the universe, both angels and
men. (That this is signified by "Him that liveth unto the ages of the
ages" may be seen above, n. 289, 291, 349.) That "to swear" signifies
asseveration and confirmation, but here verity (since it is the Lord
that is meant by the angel that swears), can be seen from this, that "to
swear" means to asseverate and confirm that a thing is so, and when done
by the Lord means Divine verity; for oaths are made only by those who
are not interiorly in truth itself, that is, by those who are not
interior but only exterior men; consequently they are never made by
angels, still less by the Lord; but He is said in the Word to swear, and
the Israelites were allowed to swear by God, because they were only
exterior men, and because the asseveration and confirmation of the
internal man, when it comes into the external, falls into the form of an
oath. In the Israelitish Church all things were external, representing
and signifying things internal. The Word in the sense of the letter is
similar. From this it can be seen that "the angel sware by Him that
liveth unto the ages of the ages" cannot mean that he thus sware, but
that he said in himself that this is verity, and that when this came
down into the natural sphere it was changed, according to
correspondences, into the form of an oath. \[2\] Now as "to swear" is
only an external corresponding to the confirmation that belongs to the
mind of the internal man, and is therefore significative of that, so in
the Word of the Old Testament it is said to be lawful to swear by God,
yea, that God Himself is said to swear. That this signifies
confirmation, asseveration and simply verity, or that it is true, can be
seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: Jehovah hath sworn by His
right hand and by the arm of His strength (62:8). In Jeremiah: Jehovah
of Hosts hath sworn by His soul (51:14; Amos 6:8). In Amos: The Lord
Jehovih hath sworn by His holiness (4:2). In the same: Jehovah hath
sworn by the excellency of Jacob (8:7). In Jeremiah: Behold, I have
sworn by My great name (44:26). Jehovah is said "to have sworn by His
right hand," "by His soul," "by His holiness," and "by His name," to
signify by Divine verity; for "the right hand of Jehovah," "the arm of
His strength," "His holiness," "His name," and "His soul," mean the Lord
in relation to Divine truth, thus Divine truth proceeding from the Lord;
the like is meant by "the excellency of Jacob," for "the mighty One of
Jacob" means the Lord in relation to Divine truth. \[3\] That "to
swear," in reference to Jehovah, signifies confirmation by Himself, that
is, from His Divine, is evident in Isaiah: By Myself have I sworn, the
word has gone forth from My mouth, and shall not be recalled (45:23). In
Jeremiah: By Myself I have sworn that this house shall become a
desolation (22:5). Because "to swear" in reference to Jehovah signifies
Divine verity it is said in David: Jehovah hath sworn truth unto David,
He turneth <span id="fr_263"></span>[608-1](#fn_263.md) not from it (Ps.
132:11). \[4\] Jehovah God, or the Lord, never swears, for to swear is
not becoming to God Himself, or the Divine verity; but when God, or the
Divine verity, wills to have anything confirmed before men, then that
confirmation in its descent into the natural sphere falls into the form
or formula of an oath, such as is used in the world. This shows why it
is said in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is the natural
sense, that God swears, although He never swears. This, then, is the
signification of "to swear" in reference to Jehovah or the Lord in the
preceding passages, and also in the following. In Isaiah: Jehovah of
Hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to
pass (14:24). In David: I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have
sworn unto David My servant. Lord, Thou hast sworn unto David in verity
(Ps. 89:3, 35, 49). In the same: Jehovah hath sworn and will not repent
(Ps. 110:4). In Ezekiel: I have sworn unto thee, and have entered into a
covenant with thee, that thou mightest become Mine (16:8). In David:
Unto whom I have sworn in Mine anger (Ps. 95:11). In Isaiah: I have
sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more pass over the earth (54:9).
In Luke: To remember His holy covenant, the oath which He sware to
Abraham our father (1:72, 73). In David: He hath remembered His covenant
which He made with Abraham, and His oath with Isaac (Ps. 105:8, 9). In
Jeremiah: That I may establish the oath which I have sworn unto your
fathers (11:5; 32:22). In Moses: The land which I have sworn to give
unto your fathers (Deut. 1:35; 10:11; 11:9, 21; 26:3, 15; 31:20; 34:4).
\[5\] From this it can be seen what is meant by "the angel lifted up his
hand to heaven, and sware by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages,"
as it is likewise said in Daniel: And I heard the man clothed in linen,
that he held up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens, and
sware by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages (12:7); as meaning to
bear witness before the angels respecting the state of the church, that
what follows is Divine verity. \[6\] Because the church that was
instituted with the sons of Israel was a representative church, in which
all things that were commanded were natural things representing and
signifying spiritual things, the sons of Israel, with whom that church
existed, were permitted to swear by Jehovah, and by His name, likewise
by the holy things of the church; and this represented and thus
signified internal confirmation, and also verity, as can be seen from
the following passages. In Isaiah: He that blesseth himself in the earth
let him bless himself in the God of truth, and he that sweareth in the
earth let him swear in the God of truth (65:16). In Jeremiah: Swear by
the living Jehovah, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness (4:2).
In Moses: Thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, Him shalt thou serve, and
shalt swear in His name (Deut. 6:13; 10:20). In Isaiah: In that day
there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that swear to Jehovah of
Hosts (19:18). In Jeremiah: If in learning they will learn the ways of
My people, to swear by My name, Jehovah liveth! (12:16). In David:
Everyone that sweareth by God shall glory, but the mouth of them that
speak a lie shall be stopped (Ps. 63:11). "To swear by God" here
signifies to speak the truth, for it is added, "the mouth of them that
speak a lie shall be stopped." (That they swore by God see also Gen.
21:23, 24, 31; Josh. 2:12; 9:20; Judg. 21:7; 1 Kings 1:17.) \[7\] As the
ancients were allowed to swear by Jehovah God, it follows that it was an
enormous evil to swear falsely or to swear to a lie, as is evident from
these passages. In Malachi: I will be a witness against the sorcerers,
and against the adulterers, and against those that swear to a lie (3:5).
In Moses: Thou shalt not swear to a lie by My name, so that thou profane
the name of thy God; also, Thou shalt not take the name of thy God in
vain (Lev. 19:12; Deut. 5:11; Exod. 20:7; Zech. 5:4). In Jeremiah: Run
ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see whether there be
any who say, By the living Jehovah; surely they swear by a lie. Thy sons
have destroyed <span id="fr_264"></span>[608-2](#fn_264.md) Me, and sworn
by one not God (5:1, 2, 7). In Hosea: Israel, ye shall not swear,
Jehovah liveth (4:15). In Zephaniah: I will cut off them that swear by
Jehovah, and that swear by their king, and them that are turned back
from following Jehovah (1:4-6). In Zechariah: Love not the oath of a lie
(8:17). In Isaiah: Hear ye, O house of Jacob, who swear by the name of
Jehovah, not in truth nor in righteousness (48:1). In David: The clean
in hands and the pure in heart doth not lift up his soul unto vanity,
nor swear with deceit (Ps. 24:4). \[8\] From this it can be seen that
the ancients, who were in the representatives and the significatives of
the church, were permitted to swear by Jehovah God in order to bear
witness to the truth, and by that oath it was signified that they
thought what is true and willed what is good. Especially was this
granted to the sons of Jacob, because they were wholly external and
natural men, and not internal and spiritual; and merely external or
natural men wish to have the truth confirmed and witnessed to by oaths;
but internal or spiritual men do not wish this; indeed, they turn away
from oaths and shudder at them, especially those in which God and the
holy things of heaven and the church are appealed to, and are content
with saying and with having it said that a thing is true, or that it is
so. \[9\] As swearing does not belong to the internal or spiritual man,
and as the Lord, when He came into the world, taught men to be internal
or spiritual, and to that end abrogated the externals of the church, and
opened its internals, therefore He forbade swearing by God and by the
holy things of heaven and the church. This is evident from these words
of the Lord in Matthew: Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt not
swear \[falsely\], but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oath; but I say
unto you, swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is the throne
of God; neither by the earth, for it is the footstool of His feet;
neither by Jerusalem, for it is a city of the great King. Neither shalt
thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make one hair white or black
(5:33-37). Here the holy things by which one must not swear are
mentioned, namely, "heaven," "earth," "Jerusalem," and the "head;" and
"heaven" means the angelic heaven, wherefore it is called "the throne of
God" (that "the throne of God" means that heaven, see above, n. 253,
462, 477); "the earth" means the church (see above, n. 29, 304, 413,
417), which is called therefore "the footstool of God's feet" (that "the
footstool of God's feet" also means the church, see above, n. 606);
"Jerusalem" means the doctrine of the church, wherefore it is called
"the city of the great king" (that "city" means doctrine, see above, n.
223); and the "head" means intelligence therefrom (see above, n. 553,
577), therefore it is said "thou canst not make one hair white or
black," which signifies that man of himself can understand nothing.
\[10\] Again, in the same: Woe unto you, ye blind guides, for ye say,
Whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing; but whosoever shall
swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor! Ye fools and blind; for
whether is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
And whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing; but whosoever
shall swear by the gift that is upon it he is a debtor. Ye fools and
blind; whether is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the
gift? But whosoever sweareth by the altar sweareth by it and by
everything thereon. And whosoever sweareth by the temple sweareth by it
and by Him that dwelleth therein. And he that sweareth by heaven
sweareth by the throne of God and by Him that sitteth thereon (Matt.
23:16-22). One must not swear "by the temple and by the altar," because
to swear by these was to swear by the Lord, by heaven, and by the
church; for the "temple" in the highest sense means the Lord in relation
to Divine truth, and in a relative sense heaven and the church in
respect to truth, likewise all worship from Divine truth (see above, n.
220); and the "altar" signifies the Lord in relation to Divine good, and
in a relative sense heaven and the church in respect to that good,
likewise all worship from Divine good (see above, n. 391); and because
by the Lord all Divine things that proceed from Him are meant, for He is
in them and they are His, so he who swears by Him swears by all things
that are His; likewise he who swears by heaven and by the church, swears
by all the holy things that belong to heaven and the church, for heaven
is the complex and containant of these things; so, in like manner, is
the church; therefore it is said that the temple is greater than the
gold of the temple, because the temple sanctifies the gold, and that the
altar is greater than the gift which is upon it, because the altar
sanctifies the gift.

<span class="margnote"><span id="609.">609.</span></span>

Who created heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth and
the things that are therein, and the sea and the things that are
therein, signifies the Lord in respect to all things of heaven and the
church, interior and exterior. This is evident from the signification of
"to create," as being not only to cause to be, but also to be
perpetually, by holding it together and sustaining it by the Divine
proceeding; for the heavens have had existence and perpetually have
existence, that is, subsist by means of the Lord's Divine, which is
called the Divine truth united to Divine good. This received by angels
makes heaven. Thence it is that when heaven is mentioned the Lord is
meant, because heaven, where the angels are, is heaven from the Lord,
that is from the Divine proceeding from Him. This, therefore, is what is
signified here by "to create." (That "to create," in reference to the
church and to men of the church, means to create anew, that is, to
regenerate, may be seen above, n. 294.) The above is evident also from
the signification of "heaven, earth, and sea, and the things that are in
them," as being all things of heaven and the church, interior and
exterior. "Heaven, earth, and sea," signify here in particular the
higher and the lower heavens, since in the spiritual world the face of
things is similar as in the natural world, that is, there are mountains,
lands, and seas; the mountains there are the higher heavens, because the
angels of those heavens dwell upon mountains, and the land and sea are
the lower heavens, for the angels of these heavens dwell below the
mountains upon the lands, and as it were in seas (see above, n. 594).
Thence it is that the angel who spoke these things was seen "standing
upon the earth and the sea." "The earth and the sea and the things that
are in them" signify also all things of the church, both interior and
exterior, because there are in the church things interior and exterior,
as there are in the heavens things higher and lower, and the former
correspond to the latter. (That "the sea and the earth," signify the
church in respect to its exteriors and interiors, may be seen above, n.
600.) According to the sense of the letter, "heaven, earth, and sea,"
mean the visible heaven, the habitable earth, and the navigable sea, and
"the things therein" mean birds, beasts, and fishes; but that this is
not the meaning of these words is evident from this, that John was "in
the spirit" when he saw the angel "standing upon the sea and upon the
earth;" and what is seen "in the spirit" is seen not in the natural
world but in the spiritual world, where also, as has been said just
above, there are earths and seas, and angels and spirits in them. But
respecting the appearance of the seas in that world, and those who are
in them, see above (n. 342).

<span class="margnote"><span id="610.">610.</span></span>

That time shall be no more, signifies that there shall be no longer any
understanding of Divine truth, nor any state of the church therefrom.
This is evident from the signification of "time," as being here the
state of man in respect to the understanding of the Word, and thus the
state of the church, because both the one and the other are treated of
in this chapter. "Time" signifies state, because times in the spiritual
world are determined and distinguished only by particular and general
states of life. This is because the sun in that world, which is the
Lord, does not move, but remains in the same place in heaven, and that
place is the east; that sun does not there revolve through the heavens
as the sun in the natural world appears to do. By the apparent
revolution of the sun of the natural world times in general and in
particular are determined, and thus have existence; in general, the year
and its four seasons, called spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
Moreover, these four seasons of the year are the four natural states of
the natural world corresponding to the same number of states in the
spiritual world, which are its general spiritual states. In particular,
within these general states in the natural world, there are determined
and fixed times, called months and weeks, but especially days, and days
are divided into four natural states, which are called morning, noon,
evening, and night, corresponding to which there are four states in the
spiritual world. In the spiritual world, because the sun, as has been
said, does not revolve through the heavens but remains constant and
fixed in its east, there are no years, months, weeks, days, or hours,
consequently there are no determinations by times, but only
determinations by states of life, general and particular. Therefore it
is not known there what time is, but only what state is, for the
determination of a thing is what gives the idea of it, and according to
the idea is the thing named. This, then, is the reason that it is not
known in the spiritual world what times are, although they succeed each
other there the same as in the natural world, but instead of times there
are states and their changes; this is the reason also that times, when
mentioned in the Word, signify states. (But respecting time and times in
the spiritual world, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 162-169; and
on the Changes of States of the angels, n. 154-161. \[Note from the
Margin:\] Notice where it is said, "it shall be when there shall be
neither day nor night" \[Jer. 33:20; Zech. 14:7\].) \[2\] Since "time"
means the things pertaining to time in the natural world, as those
pertaining to the year and the day (those of the year are seedtime and
harvest, and those of the day are morning and evening), by these things
pertaining to time states of the church are described in the Word,
"seedtime" describing and signifying the establishment of the church;
"harvest" its fruit bearing; "morning" its first time, and "noon to
evening" its progression. These natural states (or conditions) also
correspond to spiritual states, which are states of heaven and the
church. As concerns the church, the church in general passes through
these states, so does each man of the church in particular. Moreover,
each man of the church from his earliest age is also inaugurated into
these states, but when the church is at its end he can no more be
inaugurated, for he does not receive Divine truth, but either rejects or
perverts it, therefore he has neither seedtime nor harvest, that is, no
establishment and no fruit bearing, nor has he morning or evening, that
is, neither beginning nor progression. These states are meant and
signified by "times" in the Word; and as in the end of the church these
states cease with men of the church, therefore it is here said that
"time shall be no more;" and this signifies that there shall be no
further understanding of Divine truth or the Word, consequently not any
state of the church. \[3\] The like is signified by "time" in Ezekiel:
The evil, behold one evil cometh; the end is come, the end is come, it
hath awakened upon thee. Behold, the morning is come upon thee, O
inhabitant of the land, the time is come (7:5-7). This, too, was said of
the state of the church. The end of the former church is first
described, and the establishment of a new church afterwards, the end of
the former church by this, "One evil, behold the evil cometh; the end is
come, the end is come;" the establishment of a new church by this,
"Behold, the morning is come upon thee, O inhabitant of the land, the
time is come," "morning" signifying the state of a new or commencing
church, and "time" its progressive state; accordingly the meaning is
similar as that of "seedtime and harvest" and "morning and evening,"
mentioned above, consequently it means the state of the church in
respect to the understanding of truth and the will of good. \[4\] In
Daniel: The fourth beast shall speak words against the Most High, and
shall wear out the saints of the Most High, for he shall think to change
times and the right; and they shall be given into his hand for a time
and times and half a time (Dan. 7:25). "The fourth beast" means the evil
that was about to vastate the church completely; falsities destroying
the truths of the church are meant by "the words that he shall speak
against the Most High," and by "the saints of the Most High whom he will
wear out," "the saints of the Most High" signifying in the abstract
sense Divine truths. That the truths of the Word and its goods will then
be turned into falsities and evils is signified by "he shall change the
times and the right," "times" meaning the states of the church in
respect to the understanding of truth. The duration of that state in
relation to the end of the church is signified by "for a time and times
and half a time," which means a full state of vastation. \[5\] So, too,
in the following words in Daniel: And I heard the man clothed in linen,
that he lifted up his right hand and his left hand unto the heavens, and
sware by Him that liveth unto the ages of the ages that it shall be for
a fixed time of fixed times, and a half, when they are to make an end of
dispersing the people of holiness, all these things shall be finished
(12:7). "Time" here signifies state; and "time, times and a half"
signifies a full state of vastation; therefore it is said, "when they
are to make a full end of dispersing the people of holiness," "the
people of holiness" meaning those of the church who are in Divine
truths; or in an abstract sense Divine truths. With a similar meaning it
is said in Revelation: That the woman should be nourished in the
wilderness for a time and times and half a time (12:14). \[6\] As by
"time" things pertaining to time are meant, such as spring, summer,
autumn, and winter, these signifying the states of one who is to be
regenerated, or is regenerated, also the things pertaining to these
times, such as seedtime and harvest, these signifying the state of the
church in respect to the implantation of truth and the fructification of
good therefrom, and as like things are signified by the times of the
day, which are morning, noon, evening, and night, so these times have
this signification in the following passages. In Genesis: During all the
days of the earth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer
and winter, and day and night shall not cease (8:22). This may be seen
explained in Arcana Coelestia (n. 930-937). In David: The day is Thine,
the night also is Thine; thou hast prepared the light and the sun. Thou
hast set all the borders of the earth; summer and winter hast Thou
formed (Ps. 74:16, 17). In Jeremiah: Jehovah giveth the sun for a light
of the day, and the statutes of the moon and stars for a light of the
night. If these statutes shall depart from before Me, the seed of Israel
also shall cease from being a nation before Me all the days (31:35, 36).
In the same: Jehovah said, If I shall not have set My covenant of day
and night, the statutes of heaven and earth, I will reject also the seed
of Jacob and of David <span id="fr_265"></span>[610-1](#fn_265.md) My
servant (33:25, 26). "The statutes of the sun, moon, and stars," also
"the covenant of day and night," and "the statutes of heaven and earth,"
have a similar signification as "times," since "times" exist from those
statutes. That "seedtime and harvest, summer and winter," also "day and
night," have a similar signification as "times" has been said above.
\[7\] It follows that "times" have the same signification in these words
in Genesis: God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the
heavens, to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and
for seasons, and for days and for years (1:14-19). The two "luminaries,"
the sun and moon, signify love and faith; for that chapter treats in the
spiritual sense of the new creation, or the regeneration of the man of
the church, and the things said respecting the sun and moon signify the
things that chiefly regenerate man and make the church; therefore these
words and those that follow describe the process by which regeneration
is effected, and afterwards it describes their states. This makes
evident what is signified by "time shall be no more."

<span class="margnote"><span id="611.">611.</span></span>

Verse 7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is
about to sound, signifies the last state of the church, and revelation
at that time of Divine truth. This is evident from the signification of
"the days of the voice of the seventh angel," as being the last state of
the church; for as the progressive changes of the state of the church
are described by the sounding of the seven angels, so "the voice of the
seventh angel" signifies the last state; also from the signification of
"when he is about to sound," as being the revelation at that time of
Divine truth. That "to sound a trumpet or horn" signifies the influx of
Divine truth and revelation of it, may be seen above (n. 502); here the
revelation of it is signified, as is evident from the rest of this
verse, where it is said "the mystery of God shall also be finished, as
He hath declared the good tidings to His servants the prophets," which
signifies that the prediction respecting the Lord's coming shall then be
fulfilled. With the Lord's coming there is also a revelation of Divine
truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="612.">612.</span></span>

The mystery of God shall also be finished, as He hath declared the good
tidings to His servants the prophets, signifies prediction in the Word
respecting the Lord's coming, to be fulfilled when the end of the church
is at hand. This is evident from the signification of "to be finished,"
as being to be fulfilled; also from the signification of "the mystery of
God as He hath declared the good tidings," as being the Lord's coming
(of which presently); also from the signification of "His servants the
prophets," as being the truths of doctrine, here the Word. That those
are called "servants of the Lord" who are in truths from good, may be
seen above (n. 6, 409); and that those are called "prophets" who teach
doctrine, and in the abstract sense "prophets" mean doctrines, will be
further shown below. The Word also is meant, because the Word is the
doctrine of Divine truth, and because the Word was written through the
prophets; also because everything of doctrine must be from the Word.
From this it now follows that "the mystery of God shall be finished, as
He hath declared the good tidings to His servants the prophets,"
signifies the prediction in the Word respecting the Lord's coming, to be
fulfilled when the end of the church is at hand. That this is the
signification of these words is evident from what just precedes and from
what follows. In what just precedes it is said that this shall be "in
the days of the voice of the seventh angel," which means that this shall
be when the end of the church is at hand. In what follows, after the
seventh angel had sounded it is said "The kingdoms of the world are
become our Lord's and His Christ's;" and afterwards, that "the temple of
God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in His temple the ark of
His Covenant" (11:15-19). The same is evident from this, that when the
end of the church is at hand the Word is opened and a new church
established. This is meant also by the Lord's coming, for the Lord is
the Word, wherefore when the Word is opened the Lord appears. That the
Word was opened when the Lord came into the world is known; that it has
now also been opened by the revelation of its spiritual sense can be
seen from the little work on The White Horse, and in the work on Heaven
and Hell (n. 1); and that now is the end of the church, in the little
work on The Last Judgment (n. 33-39, 45-52, et seq.). \[2\] The end of
the church is meant also by "evening," and the Lord's coming by
"morning" in Daniel: Unto evening and morning two thousand three hundred
(8:14, 26). "Evening" signifies the end of a former church, and
"morning" the Lord's coming and the beginning of a new church. "Morning"
has a similar signification in Ezekiel: Behold an evil cometh, the end
is come, the end is come; it hath awaked upon thee; behold it is come,
the morning is come upon thee, O inhabitant of the land, the time is
come (7:5-7). Here, too, the "end" signifies the end of the church, and
"morning" the Lord's coming and the beginning of a new church. So, too,
in Zechariah: It shall be one day that shall be known to Jehovah, not
day nor night; for about the time of evening it shall be light (14:7).
"One day that shall be known to Jehovah" means the Lord's coming, "the
time of evening" the end of the church, when all Divine truth has been
obscured and falsified; and "light" signifies Divine truth made
manifest. This new light, or this morning which shall appear in the end
of the church, is here meant also by "the mystery of God that shall be
consummated, as He hath declared the good tidings to His servants the
prophets." \[3\] In the Word, "to proclaim good tidings" and "good
tidings" are frequently mentioned, and this signifies the Lord's coming,
as can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: O Zion,
proclaimer of good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O
Jerusalem, proclaimer of good tidings, lift up thy voice with power; say
unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God; behold, the Lord Jehovih
cometh in strength, and His arm shall rule for Him; He shall feed His
flock like a shepherd (Isa. 40:9-11). It is very clear that this is said
of the Lord's coming; and this is why Zion and Jerusalem are called
"proclaimers of good tidings." "Zion" means all who are of the celestial
church, who are those that are in love to the Lord, therefore it is
said, "get thee up into the high mountain," "high mountain" signifying
that love (see above, n. 405). "Jerusalem" means all who are of the
spiritual church, who are those that are in the doctrine of genuine
truth, therefore it is said, "lift up thy voice with power;" which
signifies confession from genuine truths. "The cities of Judah," to
which it is said, "Your God, the Lord Jehovih, cometh in strength,"
signify doctrinals from the Word, "cities" signifying doctrinals, and
"Judah" the Word. Evidently Zion and Jerusalem are called "proclaimers
of good tidings," for the reason that "good tidings" mean the coming of
the Lord, for it is said, "Behold your God, behold the Lord Jehovih
cometh in strength." That He will effect judgment, and will protect
those who acknowledge Him, is signified by "His arm shall rule for Him,
He shall feed His flock like a shepherd." \[4\] In the same: How joyous
upon the mountains are the feet of him that proclaimeth good tidings,
that maketh peace to be heard, that proclaimeth good tidings of good,
that maketh salvation to be heard; that saith unto Zion, Thy king <span
id="fr_266"></span>[612-1](#fn_266.md) shall reign, when he shall see eye
to eye that Jehovah returneth to Zion (Isa. 52:7, 8). This, too, is said
of the Lord's coming, who is evidently meant by "thy king shall reign,
when he shall see eye to eye that Jehovah returneth to Zion," likewise
in what follows in that chapter; this is why it is said "proclaim good
tidings." (The rest of the verse may be seen explained above, n. 365.)
In Nahum: Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that proclaimeth
good tidings, that publisheth peace; celebrate thy feasts, O Judah
(1:15). \[5\] In Isaiah: The spirit of the Lord Jehovih is upon me,
therefore Jehovah hath anointed me to proclaim good tidings unto the
poor; He hath sent me to bind up the broken in heart, to preach liberty
to the captives, to the bound, to the blind; to proclaim the year of
Jehovah's good pleasure and the day of vengeance for our God; to comfort
all that mourn (61:1, 2). That this was said of the Lord and His coming
is evident in Matthew (5:3, et seq.) and in Luke (4:16-22). The coming
itself is meant by "the year of Jehovah's good pleasure and the day of
vengeance for our God." "The poor to whom the Lord will proclaim good
tidings," also "the captives," "the bound" and "the blind," mean the
Gentiles who are said to be such because they have been ignorant of
truth from not having had the Word. The Gentiles are also meant in
Matthew by: The poor hear the gospel (11:5). In David: Sing unto
Jehovah, bless His name; proclaim the good tidings of His salvation from
day to day; for Jehovah cometh, for He cometh to judge the earth; He
shall judge the world in righteousness, and the peoples in His truth
(Ps. 96:2, 13). \[6\] The acknowledgment and celebration of the Lord
with joy of heart because of His coming is signified by "Sing unto
Jehovah, bless His name; proclaim the good tidings of His salvation from
day to day." The coming itself is described by "Jehovah cometh;" and as
He comes when the Last Judgment is at hand it is said "He cometh to
judge the earth; He shall judge the world in righteousness, and the
peoples in truth," "the earth" meaning the church, "the world" those in
the church who are in the good of charity, and "the peoples" those who
are in truths therefrom. That the Lord comes when the Last Judgment is
at hand has been said above, for the evil will then be separated from
the good, or the goats from the sheep, and the evil will be judged to
hell, and the good to heaven; this also is signified by the words of
Isaiah, just above, "to proclaim the day of vengeance for our God, to
comfort all that mourn." This is why, where the Last Judgment is treated
of, "proclaiming good tidings" is also mentioned, as also in the
following in Revelation: And I saw another angel flying in midheaven,
having the everlasting gospel to proclaim unto those that dwell on the
earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people, saying
with a great voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His
judgment is come (14:6, 7). That when the end of the church is at hand
the good tidings of the Lord's coming will be proclaimed, is predicted
also by the Lord Himself in the Gospels: These good tidings of the
kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all the
nations; and then shall the end come (Matt. 25:14; Mark 13:8-10). \[7\]
That the Lord's coming is meant by "proclaiming good tidings" and by
"good tidings" can be seen also from the following passages. In Luke:
The angel said to Zacharias, I am Gabriel, that stand in the presence of
God; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to proclaim to thee these
good things (1:19). In the same: The angel said to the shepherds, Be not
afraid, behold I proclaim to you good tidings of great joy, which shall
be to all people. For there is born to you this day, in the city of
David, a Savior, who is Christ the Lord (2:10, 11). In the same: That
John proclaimed to the people the good tidings respecting Jesus
(3:16-18); Jesus said, The law and the prophets are proclaimed until
John (16:16). And elsewhere: That the Lord Himself and His disciples
also proclaimed the good tidings of the kingdom of God (Matt. 4:23;
9:35; Mark 1:15; Luke 7:22; 8:1; 9:1, 2, 6). "The kingdom of God" means
a new heaven and a new church from the Lord. \[8\] Because "to proclaim
good tidings" signifies to announce the Lord's coming, "the good
tidings" in the highest sense signify the Lord Himself in relation to
His coming, in relation to judgment, and to the salvation of the
faithful, in these passages in Mark: Jesus said, Whosoever shall wish to
save his soul shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his soul for My
sake and the Gospel's shall save it (8:35; 10:29, 30). Jesus said to His
disciples, Going into all the world, preach ye the Gospel to every
creature (16:15).

Verses 8-10. And the voice which I heard from heaven again spake with
me, and said, Go, take the little book that is open in the hand of the
angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. And I went unto the
angel, saying unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me,
Take and eat it up; and it shall make bitter thy belly, but in thy mouth
it shall be sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the hand
of the angel and ate it up; and it was in my mouth like honey, sweet.
And when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter. 8. "And the voice
which I heard from heaven again spake with me, and said," signifies
exploration of the men of the church as to what understanding of the
Word yet remained with them (n. 614); "Go, take the little book that is
open in the hand of the angel that standeth upon the sea and upon the
earth," signifies the Word laid open by the Lord to heaven and the
church (n. 615). 9. "And I went unto the angel, saying unto him, Give me
the little book," signifies the faculty to perceive from the Lord of
what quality the Word is (n. 616); "And he said unto me, Take and eat it
up," signifies that he should read, perceive, and explore the Word, of
what quality it is within and of what it is without (n. 617); "and it
shall make bitter thy belly" signifies that inwardly it was undelightful
because adulterated (n. 618); "but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as
honey" signifies that outwardly it was delightful (n. 619). 10. "And I
took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and ate it up,"
signifies exploration (n. 620); "and it was in my mouth like honey,
sweet," signifies that the Word in respect to its external or in respect
to the sense of its letter was still perceived to be delightful, but
only for the reason that it served to confirm the principles of falsity
arising from love of self and of the world (n. 621); "and when I had
eaten it my belly was made bitter," signifies that it was perceived and
ascertained that the Word was inwardly undelightful, because of the
adulterated truth of the sense of its letter (n. 622).

<span class="margnote"><span id="614.">614.</span></span>

Verse 8. And the voice which I heard from heaven again spake with me,
and said, signifies exploration of the men of the church as to what
understanding of the Word yet remained with them. This is evident from
the things that precede and those that follow in this chapter; for "the
voice from heaven that spake with him and said" involves these things.
Those that precede treat of the understanding of Divine truth or of the
Word, as can be seen from verses 2-4, where the "voice" with which the
strong angel coming down from heaven cried out, and "the voices of the
seven thunders" signify a manifestation of what the state of the church
is in regard to the understanding of the Word (see above, n. 601-604).
The things that follow treat of the understanding of the Word yet
remaining with the men of the church; for "the little book that the
angel had in his hand" signifies the Word, and "eating it up" signifies
exploration, and that "it was sweet in the mouth and bitter in the
belly" signifies that in the sense of the letter the Word was
delightful, but in the internal sense, in which are the truths
themselves, it was undelightful. This will further appear from what
follows. As these are the things treated of and yet to be treated of, it
is clear that "the voice that he heard from heaven again speaking and
saying" signifies the exploration of the men of the church as to what
understanding of the Word yet remained with them. \[2\] It is to be
known that the understanding of the Word perishes in the church by
degrees, as the man of the church from internal becomes external; and
from internal he becomes external as he falls away from charity,
consequently as he falls away from the life of faith. When the man of
the church is such he may, indeed, take delight in reading the Word, but
yet he takes no delight in the truth itself, which belongs to the
interior sense of the Word; for it is the life itself of faith, which is
charity, that produces the affection of interior truth and makes it
delightful. Therefore the Word as to the sense of the letter may be
loved, but for the reason that it can be drawn over to confirm the
falsities arising from the love of self and of the world, for such is
the Word in the letter. From this it comes that in the end of the church
there is scarcely any understanding of truth. Truths from the Word are
indeed then spoken with the mouth, but yet there is no idea of truth. It
has been granted me to test whether this is so in the case of many in
the spiritual world, and it was found that although, so far as they had
spoken from the Word they had spoken truths, yet they had no
understanding of them; thus they were like empty vessels and like
tinkling bells, speaking only from such things as they drew forth from
the memory, and not at all from any perception of the understanding.
When man is such he cannot inwardly possess anything celestial or
spiritual, but only what is natural, from the body and the world, and
when this is separated from what is celestial and spiritual it is
infernal. From this it can be seen what is meant in what follows by the
little book given to John to eat being in his mouth sweet as honey, but
that his belly was made bitter from it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="615.">615.</span></span>

Go, take the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who
standeth upon the sea and upon the earth, signifies the Word manifested
by the Lord to heaven and the church. This is evident from the
signification of "the little book that is open," as being the Word
manifested (see above, n. 599); also from the signification of the
"angel who had the little book in his hand," as being the Lord in
relation to the Word (see above, n. 593); also from the signification of
"sea and earth," as being heaven and the church (see above, n. 600); and
also from the signification of "standing upon them," as being that all
things in them are subject to the Lord (see above, n. 606). From this it
can be seen that "the little book that is open in the hand of the angel
who standeth upon the sea and upon the earth" signifies the Word
manifested by the Lord to heaven and the church. The signification of
"taking it and eating it up" will be shown in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="616.">616.</span></span>

Verse 9. And I went unto the angel, saying, Give me the little book,
signifies the faculty to perceive from the Lord of what quality the Word
is. This is evident from the signification of "going to the angel and
saying, Give me the little book," as being in the nearest sense to obey
the command, because he was told to go and take it; but in a more remote
sense, which also is the interior sense, these words mean the faculty to
perceive from the Lord of what quality the Word is. It is granted by the
Lord to every man to perceive this, but yet no one does perceive it
unless he wishes as of himself to perceive it. This ability to
reciprocate, man must have in order to receive the faculty to perceive
the Word; unless a man wishes and does this as of himself no such
faculty can be appropriated to him; since, in order that appropriation
may be effected, there must be an active and a reactive; the active is
from the Lord, so is the reactive, but the latter appears to be from
man; for the Lord Himself gives this reactive, and thence it is from the
Lord and not from man; but as man does not know otherwise than that he
lives from himself, and consequently that he thinks and wills from
himself, so he must needs do this as if it were from what is proper to
his own life; and when he so acts, it is then first implanted in him,
and conjoined and appropriated to him. \[2\] He who believes that Divine
verities and goodnesses flow into man apart from such an ability to
react or reciprocate, is much deceived, for this would be to let the
hands hang down, and to wait for immediate influx; as those think who
wholly separate faith from charity, and who say that the goods of
charity, which are the goods of life, flow in without any cooperation of
man's will, when yet the Lord teaches that He continually stands at the
door and knocks, and that man must open the door, and that He enters in
to him who opens (Rev. 3:20). In brief, action and reaction constitute
all conjunction, and in action and mere passiveness there is no
conjunction; for when the agent or active flows into the mere patient or
passive, it passes through and is dissipated, for the passive yields and
retires; but when the agent or active flows into a passive that is also
a reactive, then they join together and the two remain conjoined. Thus
it is with the influx of Divine good and Divine truth into man's will or
love; for this reason when the Divine flows into the understanding alone
it passes through and is dissipated, but when it flows into the will,
where what is man's own (proprium) resides, it remains conjoined. From
this it can be seen what is involved in its being said, first, "Go, take
the little book that is open in the hand of the angel who standeth upon
the sea and upon the earth," and then that he "went unto the angel,
saying, Give me the little book," and the angel then said, "Take and eat
it up," thus the ability to react or reciprocate is described. And from
this then it is that these words signify the faculty to receive and
perceive from the Lord of what quality the Word is. The reception of the
Divine influx is described in like manner elsewhere in the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="617.">617.</span></span>

And he said unto me, Take and eat it up, signifies that he should read,
perceive, and explore the Word, of what quality it is within and what it
is without. This is evident from the signification of "he said unto me,
Take the little book," as being the faculty given to perceive of what
quality the Word is, that is, what the understanding of the Word now is
in the church (see the preceding article, n. 616); and from the
signification of "to eat up" (or devour), as being to conjoin and
appropriate to oneself, and as the Word is conjoined to man by reading
and perception, here "to eat up" or "to devour" signifies to read and
perceive. "To eat up" here signifies also to explore, because it is
added that "the little book made his belly bitter," and was perceived to
be "in his mouth sweet as honey," and by this it was ascertained what
the Word, as regards its understanding, is within and without; what it
is within is signified by "the belly and its bitterness," and what it is
without by the "mouth" in which it was perceived to be sweet as honey.
From this it can be seen that "he said unto me, Take and eat it up,"
signifies that he should read, perceive, and explore the Word, of what
quality it is within and of what it is without. \[2\] "To eat" and "to
drink" are often mentioned in the Word, and those who have no knowledge
of the spiritual sense can have no other idea than that natural eating
and drinking are thereby meant; but "to eat" and "to drink" signify to
nourish oneself spiritually, consequently to appropriate to oneself good
and truth, "to eat" signifying to appropriate to oneself good, and "to
drink" to appropriate to oneself truth. Anyone who believes that the
Word is also spiritual may know that "to eat" and "to drink," likewise
"bread," "food," "wine," and "drink" mean spiritual nourishment; if they
did not mean this the Word would be merely natural and not at the same
time spiritual, thus merely for the natural man and not for the
spiritual man, much less for angels. That "bread," "food," "wine," and
"drink" mean in the spiritual sense the nourishment of the mind, has
been frequently shown above; also that the Word is spiritual throughout,
although in the sense of the letter it is natural. To be nourished
spiritually is to be instructed and imbued, consequently to know, to
understand, and to be wise. Unless a man enjoys this nourishment
together with the nourishment of the body, he is not a man but a beast;
and this is why those who place all delight in feastings and banquetings
and daily indulge their palates are dull in spiritual things, however
they may be able to reason respecting the things of the world and of the
body; therefore after death they live a life that is beastly rather than
human, for instead of intelligence and wisdom they have insanity and
folly. This has been said to make known that here "to devour or eat up
the little book" signifies to read, to perceive, and to explore the
Word, for "the little book" that was in the hand of the angel coming
down from heaven means the Word, as has been said above. Moreover, one
cannot eat or devour a book naturally, thus not the Word; and this, too,
makes clearly evident that "to eat" here signifies to be spiritually
nourished. \[3\] That "to eat" and "to drink" signify in the Word to eat
and drink spiritually, which is to be instructed, and by instruction and
living to imbue oneself with good and truth and to appropriate this,
consequently intelligence and wisdom, can be seen from the following
passages. In Jeremiah: Thy words shall be found, that I may eat them,
and Thy Word be to me for joy and for the gladness of my heart (15:16).
Here "to eat" manifestly stands for spiritual eating, which is to know,
to perceive, and to appropriate to oneself, for it is said, "that I may
eat Thy words, and Thy Word be to me for joy and for the gladness of my
heart;" the "words of God" signify His precepts or Divine truths. This
is similar to what the Lord said to the tempter: That man shall not live
by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
God (Matt. 4:3, 4; Luke 4:4; Deut. 8:3). Again: Work not for the food
that perisheth, but for the food that abideth unto eternal life (John
6:27). So, too, with the words of the Lord to the disciples: The
disciples said, Rabbi, eat. But He said, I have food to eat that ye know
not. The disciples said one to another, Hath anyone brought Him aught to
eat? Jesus said unto them, My food is to do the will of Him that sent
Me, and to accomplish His work (John 4:31-34). \[4\] From this, too, it
is evident that "to eat" signifies in the spiritual sense to receive in
the will and to do, from which is conjunction; for the Lord by doing the
Divine will conjoined the Divine that was in Him with His Human, and
thus appropriated the Divine to His Human. To this may be referred: The
Lord's feeding the five thousand men, besides women and children, with
five loaves and two fishes, and when they had eaten and were filled they
took up twelve baskets of fragments (Matt. 14:15-22; John 6:5, 13, 23).
Also His feeding four thousand men from seven loaves and a few fishes
(Matt. 15:32, et seq.). This miracle was done because previously the
Lord had been teaching them, and they had received and appropriated to
themselves His doctrine; this is what they ate spiritually; therefore
natural eating followed, that is, flowed in out of heaven with them as
the manna did with the sons of Israel, unknown to them; for when the
Lord wills, spiritual food which also is real food but only for spirits
and angels, is changed into natural food, just as it was turned into
manna every morning. \[5\] The like is signified by "eating bread in the
kingdom of God" in Luke: I appoint unto you a kingdom that ye may eat
and drink at My table in My kingdom (22:27, 29, 30). Here also "to eat"
and "to drink" signify to eat and drink spiritually, therefore "to eat"
there signifies to receive, to perceive; and to appropriate to oneself
the good of heaven from the Lord, and "to drink" signifies to receive,
to perceive, and to appropriate to oneself the truth of that good; for
"to eat" is predicated of good because "bread" signifies the good of
love, and "to drink" is predicated of truth because "water" and "wine"
signify the truth of that good. The like is signified elsewhere in Luke:
Blessed is he that eateth bread in the kingdom of God (14:15). This is
why the Lord there likened the kingdom of God: To a great supper, to
which those invited did not come, and to which only those came who were
brought in from the streets (verses 16-24). \[6\] Spiritual eating, by
which the soul is nourished, is also signified by "eating" in the
following passages. In Isaiah: If ye will be willing and obedient ye
shall eat good (1:19). "To eat good" signifies spiritual good, therefore
it is said, "If ye will be willing and obedient," that is, if ye will
do; for spiritual food is given, conjoined, and appropriated to man by
his willing and his doing therefrom. In David: Blessed is everyone that
feareth Jehovah, that walketh in His ways. Thou shalt eat the labor of
thy hands; blessed art thou, and it is good with thee (Ps. 128:1, 2).
"To eat the labor of his hands" signifies the celestial good that man
receives from the Lord by a life according to Divine truths, and
acquires as it were by his own labor and zeal, therefore it is said that
he shall eat "who feareth Jehovah and walketh in His ways," and it is
added "Blessed art thou, and it is good with thee." \[7\] In Isaiah: Say
to the righteous that it is good, for they shall eat the fruit of their
works (3:10). "To eat the fruit of their works" has a similar
signification as "eating the labor of their hands," mentioned above. In
Ezekiel: Thou didst eat fine flour, honey, and oil; whence thou didst
become exceeding beautiful, and didst prosper even to a kingdom (16:13).
This was said of Jerusalem, which signifies the church, here the Ancient
Church, which was in truths and in spiritual good, and at the same time
in natural good; "fine flour" signifies truth, "honey" natural good, or
the good of the external man; and "oil" spiritual good, or the good of
the internal man; the reception, perception, and appropriation of these
goods is signified by "eating fine flour, honey, and oil;" that from
these the church became intelligent is signified by "whence thou didst
become exceedingly beautiful," "beauty" signifying intelligence; that
from these it became a church is signified by "thou didst prosper even
to a kingdom," "kingdom" signifying the church. \[8\] In Isaiah: Behold,
a virgin shall conceive, and bear a Son, and shall call His name God
with us; butter and honey shall He eat, that He may know to reject the
evil and to choose the good. For before the boy knoweth to reject the
evil and to choose the good the land which thou abhorrest shall be
forsaken from before its two kings (7:14-16). It is evident that the
"Son" whom the virgin shall conceive and bear, and whose name shall be
called "God with us," is the Lord in respect to His Human; the
appropriation, in respect to the Human, of spiritual and natural Divine
good is meant by "butter and honey shall He eat," spiritual Divine good
by "butter," natural Divine good by "honey," and appropriation by
"eating;" and because so far as it is known how to reject evil and to
choose good, so far spiritual and natural Divine good is appropriated,
therefore it is said, "that He may know to reject the evil and to choose
the good." That the church was deserted and vastated in respect to all
good and truth by knowledges falsely applied, and by reasonings
therefrom, is signified by "the land which thou abhorrest shall be
forsaken from before its two kings," "land" signifying the church; the
desertion and devastation of it are meant by "it shall be forsaken and
abhorred;" and "the two kings," who are the king of Egypt and the king
of Assyria, signify knowledges wrongly applied, and reasonings
therefrom, "the king of Egypt" such knowledges, and "the king of
Assyria" reasonings therefrom. That these kings are meant is evident
from what follows in verses 17 and 18, where Egypt and Assyria are
mentioned; moreover, these things also are what chiefly devastate the
church. That the Lord came into the world when there was no longer any
truth and good in the church, thus when there was nothing of the church
remaining, has been said several times above. \[9\] In the same prophet:
It shall come to pass by reason of the abundance of milk that one shall
eat butter; for butter and honey shall everyone eat that remains in the
land (Isa. 7:22). This is said of a new church to be established by the
Lord; and "butter and honey" signify spiritual good and natural good,
and "to eat" signifies to appropriate (as above); "milk" signifies the
spiritual from the celestial, from which these goods are. \[10\] In the
same: Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that
hath no silver; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk
without silver and without price. Wherefore do ye weigh silver for that
which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfieth not? In
hearkening hearken unto Me, <span id="fr_267"></span>[617-1](#fn_267.md)
and eat good, that your soul may delight itself in fatness (Isa. 55:1,
2). It is very clear that "to eat" signifies here to appropriate to
oneself from the Lord, for it is said, "Ho, everyone that thirsteth,
come ye to the waters, and he that hath no silver; come ye, buy and
eat," which signifies that everyone who desires truth, and who had not
truth before, may acquire and appropriate it from the Lord; "one that
thirsts" signifies one who desires, "water" truth, "silver" the truth of
good, here one who has no truth of good is meant; "to come" means to
come to the Lord, "to buy" means to acquire for oneself, and "to eat" to
appropriate. "Come ye, buy wine and milk without silver and without
price," signifies that spiritual Divine truth and natural Divine truth
may be acquired without self-intelligence, "wine" signifying spiritual
Divine truth, and "milk" spiritual-natural Divine truth. "Wherefore do
ye weigh silver for that which is not bread? and your labor for that
which satisfieth not?" signifies that it is useless to endeavor to
acquire from what is one's own \[proprium\] the good of love and that
which nourishes the soul; "silver" as well as "labor" means here truth
from what is one's own \[proprium\], or from self-intelligence, "bread"
means the good of love, and "that which satisfies" that which nourishes
the soul, here that which does not nourish; "In hearkening hearken unto
Me" signifies that these things are from the Lord alone; "and eat ye
good, that your soul may delight itself in fatness," signifies that they
may appropriate to themselves celestial good, from which is every
enjoyment of life, "to delight in fatness" signifying to have enjoyment
from good, and "soul" signifying life. \[11\] In the same: The
merchandise of Tyre shall be for them that dwell before Jehovah, to eat
to satiety and for a covering with what is ancient (Isa. 23:18). "The
merchandise of Tyre" signifies the knowledges of good and truth of every
kind; "to dwell before Jehovah" signifies to live from the Lord; "to eat
to satiety" signifies to receive, perceive, and appropriate to oneself
knowledges of good sufficient for nourishing the soul; "for a covering
with what is ancient" signifies to be imbued with knowledges of genuine
truth; for "to cover" is predicated of truths, because "garments"
signify truths clothing good, and "ancient" is predicated of what is
genuine, since there were genuine truths with the ancients. The
signification is similar in Moses: That they should eat to the full, and
should eat the old store long kept (Lev. 26:5, 10). In the same: That
they should eat and be full in the good land (Deut. 11:15). Then also
that they should eat and not be satisfied (Lev. 26:26). \[12\] In
Isaiah: They shall build houses and inhabit them, and they shall plant
vineyards and eat the fruit of them. They shall not build that another
may inhabit, they shall not plant that another may eat (65:21, 22).
Everyone knows what is signified by these words in the sense of the
letter; but as the Word in its bosom is spiritual, spiritual things also
are meant, that is, such things as belong to heaven and the church, for
these are spiritual things. "To build houses and to inhabit them"
signifies to fill the interiors of the mind with the goods of heaven and
the church, and thereby to enjoy celestial life, "houses" signifying the
interiors of the mind, and "to inhabit" celestial life therefrom. "To
plant vineyards and to eat the fruit of them" signifies to enrich
themselves with spiritual truths, and to appropriate to themselves goods
therefrom; "vineyards" mean spiritual truths, "fruits" goods therefrom;
and "to eat" to receive, perceive, and appropriate to themselves, for
every good is appropriated to man by means of truths, that is, by a life
according to them. This that has been said makes evident what is
signified by "they shall not build that another may inhabit, they shall
not plant that another may eat," "another" signifying falsity and evil
destroying truth and good; for when truths and goods perish with man
falsities and evils enter. In Jeremiah: Build ye houses and inhabit
them, and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them (29:5, 28). These
words have a similar meaning as those just explained. \[13\] In Moses:
That there shall be given in the land great and good cities which they
builded not, houses full of every good thing which they did not fill,
cisterns hewed out which they did not hew, vineyards and olive gardens
which they did not plant; they shall eat to satiety (Deut. 6:10, 11).
The natural man understands these things only according to the sense of
the letter, but if the particulars contained no spiritual meaning the
Word would be merely natural and not spiritual, and thus it might be
believed that merely worldly opulence and abundance are promised to
those who live according to the Divine commandments. "But what would it
profit a man if he should gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?"
In other words, what would it profit a man to be given houses full of
every good thing, likewise cisterns, and to have vineyards and olive
gardens given him from which he might eat to satiety? But these riches
enumerated are worldly riches by which are meant spiritual riches, from
which man has eternal life. The "great and good cities to be given"
signify doctrinals from genuine goods and truths; "houses full of every
good thing" signify the interiors of the mind full of love and wisdom;
"cisterns hewn" signify the interiors of the natural mind full of the
knowledges of good and truth; "vineyards and olive gardens" signify all
things of the church, both its truths and its goods, "vineyards" meaning
the church in respect to truths, and "olive gardens" the church in
respect to goods, since "wine" signifies truth, and "oil" good; "to eat
to satiety" signifies full reception, perception, and appropriation.
\[14\] In Isaiah: He shall delight in Jehovah; and I will make thee to
ride upon the high places of the earth, and will feed thee with the
heritage of Jacob (58:14). "To make to ride upon the high places of the
earth" signifies to give an understanding of higher or interior truth
respecting the things of the church and of heaven; and "to feed with the
heritage of Jacob" signifies to bestow all things of heaven and the
church; for "the heritage of Jacob" means the land of Canaan, and that
land signifies the church, and in a higher sense heaven. \[15\] As "to
eat" signifies to appropriate to oneself, it can be seen what is
signified by: Eating of the tree of life which is in the midst of the
paradise (Rev. 2:7); namely, to appropriate to oneself celestial life;
also what is signified by "eating of the tree of knowledge" in Genesis:
Jehovah God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden
eating thou shalt eat, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil, of this thou shalt not eat, for in the day that thou shalt eat of
it dying thou shalt die (2:16, 17). The "tree of the knowledge
(scientia) of good and evil" signifies the knowledge of natural things,
through which it is not permitted to enter into the celestial and
spiritual things which belong to heaven and the church, thus to enter
from the natural man into the spiritual, which is the inverse way, and
therefore does not lead to wisdom, but destroys it. "Adam and his wife"
mean the Most Ancient Church, which was a celestial church. Because the
men of that church were in love to the Lord they had Divine truths
inscribed on them, and thence they knew from influx the corresponding
things in the natural man, which are called knowledges \[scientifica\];
in a word, there was with them spiritual influx, that is, influx from
the spiritual mind into the natural, and thus into the things that are
in it, and what these were they saw by correspondence as in a mirror.
\[16\] With them spiritual things were entirely distinct from natural
things; spiritual things had their seat in their spiritual mind, and
natural things in their natural mind, and thus they did not immerse what
is spiritual in their natural mind, as spiritual-natural men are wont to
do. For this reason, if they had consigned spiritual things to the
natural memory, and had appropriated them to themselves in that way,
that which was implanted with them would have perished, and they would
have begun to reason about spiritual things from the natural man, and
thus to form conclusions, which celestial men never do. This, moreover,
would have been wishing to be wise from self-intelligence, and not from
Divine intelligence, as before, and by this they would have extinguished
all their celestial life, and they would have entertained natural ideas
even about spiritual things. This, therefore, is what is signified by
their "not eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil," and if
they did eat, "dying they should die." The like is true of those who are
in the Lord's celestial kingdom as of these most ancient people meant by
"Adam." If these were to imbue the natural man and its memory with
knowledges of spiritual truth and good, and should wish to be wise from
these, they would become stupid, while yet they are the wisest of all in
heaven. (On this more may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n.
20-28, where the Two Kingdoms, Celestial and Spiritual, into which
Heaven is in general distinguished, are treated of.) \[17\] In David: He
that did eat of My bread hath lifted up his heel against Me (Ps. 41:9).
This is said of the Jews, who had Divine truths because they had the
Word, as can be seen in John (13:18), where these words are applied to
the Jews; therefore "to eat the Lord's bread" signifies the
appropriation of Divine truth, but here a communication of it, for the
Jews could not appropriate it. "Bread" signifies the Word, from which is
spiritual nutrition. "To lift up the heel against Him" signifies to
pervert the sense of the letter of the Word even to denial of the Lord,
and the falsification of every truth. For the Divine truth is presented
in image as a man; this is why heaven in its whole complex is called the
Greatest Man, and corresponds to all things of man; for heaven is formed
according to the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord; and as the Word
is the Divine truth, this, too, before the Lord is in image like a
Divine Man; for this reason its ultimate sense, which is the mere sense
of the letter, corresponds to the heel. The perversion of the Word, or
of the Divine truth, by applying the sense of the letter to falsities,
such as were the traditions of the Jews, is signified by "lifting up the
heel against the Lord." The whole heaven is in image like a man, and
thence corresponds to all things of man, and heaven is such because it
was created and formed by the Lord by means of the Divine truth
proceeding from Him, which is the Word by which all things were made
(John 1:1-3), as may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell (n. 59-102,
and n. 200-212). \[18\] In Luke: They shall begin to say, We did eat
before Thee and drink before Thee, and Thou didst teach in our streets.
But He shall say, I know you not whence ye are; depart, ye workers of
iniquity (13:26, 27). Their saying, when presented for judgment, that
they "ate and drank before the Lord," signifies that they had read the
Word and drawn from it the knowledges of good and truth, supposing that
this would save them; therefore it follows, "Thou didst teach in our
streets," which signified that they had been instructed in truths from
the Word, thus by the Lord. But that reading the Word and being
instructed from it is of no avail for salvation, without at the same
time a life according to it, is signified by the answer, "He shall say,
I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity;"
for it is of no avail for salvation to enrich the memory from the Word
and from the doctrinals of the church, unless they are committed to
life. \[19\] In Matthew: The king said to them on his right hand, I was
an hungered and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty and ye gave me to
drink. And to those on the left hand, I was an hungered and ye gave me
not to eat; I was thirsty and ye gave me not to drink (25:34, 35, 41,
42). By these words also spiritual hunger and thirst and spiritual
eating and drinking are signified; spiritual hunger and thirst are the
affection and desire for good and truth, and spiritual eating and
drinking are instruction, reception, and appropriation. It is said here
that the Lord hungered and thirsted, because from His Divine love He
desires the salvation of all; and it is said that men gave Him to eat
and to drink; which is done when from affection they receive and
perceive good and truth from the Lord, and by means of the life
appropriate them to themselves. The like may be said of a man who from
his heart loves to instruct man and desires his salvation; therefore it
is charity, or the spiritual affection of truth, that is described by
these words and those that follow. \[20\] From what has been said it can
now be seen what is signified in the spiritual sense by eating bread and
drinking wine in the Holy Supper, Matthew 26:26; Mark 14:22; where it is
also said, that the bread is the Lord's body, and the wine is His blood.
There "bread" signifies the good of love, and "wine" truth from that
good, which is the good of faith, and "flesh and blood," have a similar
signification, also "eating" signifies appropriation and conjunction
with the Lord, as can be seen from what is said and shown in The
Doctrine of the New Jerusalem (n. 210-222). That such is the
signification of "bread and wine," and "body and blood," also of
"eating," becomes still more evident from the Lord's words in John:
Your <span id="fr_268"></span>[617-2](#fn_268.md) fathers did eat the manna
in the wilderness, and they are dead. This is the bread which cometh
down out of heaven; if anyone shall eat of this bread he shall live
forever; and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I will give
for the life of the world. Verily I say unto you, Except ye eat the
flesh of the Son of man and drink His blood ye have not life in you. He
that eateth My flesh and drinketh My blood hath eternal life; and I will
raise him up at the last day. He that eateth My flesh and drinketh My
blood abideth in Me and I in him. This is that bread that came down out
of heaven. He that eateth of this bread shall live forever (John
6:49-58). Anyone who has the ability to think interiorly can see that
neither flesh nor blood nor bread nor wine, are here meant, but the
Divine proceeding from the Lord; for it is the Divine proceeding, which
is Divine good and Divine truth, that gives eternal life to man, and
causes the Lord to abide in man, and man in the Lord; for the Lord is in
man in His own Divine and not in what is man's own \[proprium\], for
this is nothing but evil; and the Lord is in man, and man in the Lord,
when the Divine proceeding is appropriated to man by a right reception.
The appropriation itself is signified by "eating," the Divine good
proceeding, by "flesh" and "bread," and the Divine truth proceeding, by
"blood" and "wine." It was similar in the sacrifices, in which the
"flesh" and the "meal-offering," which was bread, signified the good of
love, and the "blood" and "wine," which were the drink-offering,
signified truth from that good, both from the Lord. Since "flesh" and
"bread" signify the Divine good proceeding, and "blood" and "wine," the
Divine truth proceeding, "flesh" and "bread" mean the Lord Himself in
relation to Divine good, and "blood" and "wine," the Lord Himself in
relation to Divine truth. The Lord Himself is meant by these, because
the Divine proceeding is the Lord Himself in heaven and in the church;
therefore the Lord says of Himself, "This is the bread that cometh down
out of heaven;" also "He that eateth and drinketh these abideth in Me,
and I in him." \[21\] Because "bread" signifies the Lord in relation to
Divine good, and "to eat it" signifies appropriation and conjunction:
When the Lord manifested Himself to the disciples after His death, when
He brake bread and gave to them, their eyes were opened and they knew
Him (Luke 24:30, 31). This, too, shows that "to eat bread" given by the
Lord signifies conjunction with Him. Enlightened by this the disciples
knew Him; for "eyes" in the Word correspond to the understanding and
thence signify it, and this is what is enlightened; and thence "their
eyes were opened." "To break bread" signifies in the Word to communicate
one's good to another. \[22\] The Lord ate with publicans and sinners:
At which the Jews murmured and were offended (Mark 2:15, 16; Luke 5:29,
32; 7:33-35); because the Gentiles that are meant by "publicans and
sinners" received the Lord, imbibed His precepts, and lived according to
them, and by this means the Lord appropriated to them the goods of
heaven, and this is signified in the spiritual sense by "eating with
them." \[23\] Because "to eat" signifies to be appropriated, it was
granted to the sons of Israel to eat of the sanctified things or of the
sacrifices, for the "sacrifices" signified Divine celestial and
spiritual things, and thus "eating" of them signified their
appropriation. Because the appropriation of holy things was signified by
such "eating," various laws were given, prescribing who should eat and
where they should eat and of what sacrifices, thus: What Aaron and his
sons should receive and eat of the sacrifices (Exod. 29:31-33; Lev.
6:16-18; 7:6, 7; 8:31-33; 10:13-15); That they should eat the shew-bread
in the holy place (Lev. 24:5-9); That the daughter of a priest married
to a stranger should not eat of the holy things, but that the daughter
of a priest being a widow or divorced, who had no child, but was
returned to the house of her father, might eat (Lev. 22:12, 13); Who of
the people might eat (Num. 18:10, 11, 13, 19); That a stranger, a
sojourner, a hired servant of a priest, should not eat of them, but that
one bought with silver might eat (Lev. 22:10-12); That one who was
unclean must not eat (Lev. 7:19-21; 21:16 to the end; 22:2-8); That they
should eat no part of the burnt-offerings, but of the eucharistic
sacrifices they should eat and be glad before Jehovah (Deut. 12:27;
27:7). In these and many other statutes and laws respecting the eating
of things sanctified are contained arcana respecting the appropriation
of Divine good and Divine truth, and thus of conjunction with the Lord;
but this is not the place to unfold the particulars, only let it be
known from the passages cited, that "to eat" signifies to be
appropriated and conjoined. So again: When the sons of Israel were
joined to the Lord by the blood of the covenant, and when Moses had read
the book of the law before them, and they presently saw the God of
Israel, it is said that they did eat and drink (Exod. 24:6-11). \[24\]
That "to eat flesh and drink blood" signifies the appropriation of
spiritual good and truth, can be seen in Ezekiel: Thus said the Lord
Jehovih, Gather yourselves from every side to My sacrifice that I do
sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that
ye may eat flesh and drink blood. Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty
and drink the blood of the princes of the earth. And ye shall eat fat to
satiety, and drink blood even to drunkenness, of My sacrifice which I
sacrifice for you. Ye shall be satiated at My table with horse and with
chariot, with the mighty man and with every man of war. So will I give
My glory among the nations (39:17-21). This treats of the calling
together of all to the Lord's kingdom, and in particular the
establishment of the church with the Gentiles, for it is said, "so will
I give My glory among the nations." "To eat flesh and drink blood" means
to appropriate to oneself Divine good and Divine truth, "flesh"
signifying the good of love, and "blood" the truth of that good; "the
mighty" (or oxen) signify the affections of good, "the princes of the
earth" the affections of truth. The full fruition of these is signified
by "eating fat to satiety, and drinking blood to drunkenness," "fat"
signifying interior goods, and "blood" interior truths, which were
disclosed by the Lord when He came into the world, and were appropriated
by those who received Him. \[25\] Before the Lord's coming into the
world, to eat fat and drink blood was forbidden, because the sons of
Israel were in externals only, for they were natural-sensual men, and
not at all in things internal or spiritual, consequently if they had
been permitted to eat fat and blood, which signifies the appropriation
of interior goods and truths, they would have profaned them, therefore
"eating fat and blood" signified profanation. "To be satiated at the
Lord's table with horse and with chariot, with the mighty man and with
every man of war" has a similar signification; "horse" signifying the
understanding of the Word; "chariot," the doctrine from the Word; "the
mighty man and the man of war," good and truth fighting against evil and
falsity and destroying them, and "the mountains of Israel upon which
they should eat," the spiritual church in which the good of charity is
the essential. All this makes very clear that "to eat" signifies to
appropriate to oneself, and that "flesh," "blood," "mighty man,"
"princes of the earth," "horse," "chariot," and "man of war," signify
the spiritual things that are to be appropriated, and by no means
natural things, for to eat such things naturally would be abominable and
diabolical. Similar things are signified by: Eating the flesh of kings,
of commanders of thousands, of horses, and of them that sit upon them,
free and bond (Rev. 19:18). \[26\] As most things in the Word have also
a contrary sense, so have "to eat" and "to drink;" and in that sense
they signify to appropriate evil and falsity, and thus to be conjoined
to hell; as can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: In that
day will the Lord Jehovih call to weeping and to lamentation, and to
baldness, and to girding with sackcloth; and behold, gladness and joy in
slaying an ox and slaughtering a sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine;
let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die (22:12, 13). The devastation
of the church and lamentation over it are signified by "to be called in
that day to weeping, lamentation, baldness, and girding with sackcloth;"
lamentation over the destruction of truth is signified by "weeping,"
over the destruction of good by "lamentation," over the destruction of
all affection of good by "baldness," and over the destruction of the
affection of truth by "sackcloth;" "to slay an ox and to slaughter a
sheep" signifies to extinguish natural good and spiritual good; "to eat
flesh and drink wine" signifies to appropriate evil and falsity, "flesh"
here signifying evil, "wine," the falsity of evil, and "to eat and
drink" these, to appropriate to oneself. \[27\] In Ezekiel: The prophet
was told to eat food by weight and with care, and to drink water by
measure and with astonishment; and that he should eat a cake of barley
made with dung; and that thus shall the sons of Israel eat their bread
unclean among the nations whither they shall be thrust out, and they
shall be in want of bread and water, and be made desolate, a man and his
brother, and shall waste away for their iniquity (4:10-17). These words
in the prophet represented the adulteration of Divine truth, or of the
Word, with the Jewish nation; "the cake of barley made with dung"
signifies such adulteration, "a cake of barley" meaning natural good and
truth, such as the Word is in the sense of the letter, and "dung,"
infernal evil; therefore it is said, "thus shall the sons of Israel eat
their bread unclean," "bread unclean" meaning good defiled with evil,
that is, adulterated. That "they would be in want of bread and water
among the nations whither they should be driven" signifies that they
would no more have good and truth because of being in evils and
falsities, "nations" signifying evils and falsities, and "to be thrust
out thither," to be delivered up to these; "man and brother" who shall
be made desolate, signify faith and charity, "man" signifying the truth
of faith, and "brother," the good of charity, and "to be made desolate,"
the complete extinction of both. This being the signification of "eating
bread and drinking water" it is said that "they shall waste away for
their iniquity;" "to waste away" is predicated of spiritual life, when
it is perishing. \[28\] As "beasts" signify affections, some beasts good
affections and others evil affections, there were laws established for
the sons of Israel, with whom the church was representative, as to what
beasts should be eaten and what should not be eaten (Lev. 11); and these
signified what beasts represented good affections that should be
appropriated, and what beasts evil affections that should not be
appropriated, since good affections render a man clean, while evil
affections render him unclean. All things in that chapter relating to
particular beasts and birds, and to their hoofs, feet, and cud, by which
the clean are distinguished from the unclean, are significative. \[29\]
In Isaiah: If he shall cut down <span
id="fr_269"></span>[617-3](#fn_269.md) on the right hand he shall still be
hungry, and if he shall eat on the left hand they shall not be
satisfied; they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm; Manasseh
Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh (9:20, 21). This describes the extinction
of good by falsity and of truth by evil; the extinction of all good and
truth, however it is sought for, is signified by "if he shall cut down
on the right hand he shall still be hungry, and if he shall eat on the
left hand they shall not be satisfied;" "to cut down and to eat" on the
right and left means to search for, "to be hungry and not be satisfied"
means not to be found, or if found to have no ability to receive; "they
shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm" signifies that falsity
shall consume good, and evil truth, in the natural man; "Manasseh
Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasseh," signifies that the will of evil shall
consume the understanding of truth, and the understanding of falsity
shall consume the will of good. (But this may be seen explained above,
n. 386, 600.) \[30\] The consumption of all truth and good is signified
by: Their eating the flesh of their sons and daughters (Lev. 26:29).
Also by: The fathers shall eat the sons, and the sons shall eat the
fathers (Ezek. 5:10). "Fathers" signify the goods of the church, and in
the contrary sense its evils; "sons" signify the truths of the church,
and in the contrary sense its falsities; "daughters," the affections of
truth and good, and in the contrary sense the desires for falsity and
evil; the consumption and extinction of these one by another are
signified by their "eating one another." This makes evident that these
things must be understood otherwise than according to the sense of the
letter. \[31\] In Matthew: In the consummation of the age it shall be as
it was before the flood, eating and drinking, contracting marriage, and
giving in marriage (24:38; Luke 17:26-28). "To eat and drink, to
contract marriage, and give in marriage" does not mean here to eat and
drink, nor to contract marriage, and give in marriage, but "to eat"
means to appropriate evil, "to drink" to appropriate falsity, "to
contract marriage and give in marriage," to conjoin falsity with evil,
and evil with falsity; for this treats of the state of the church when
the Last Judgment is at hand; for this is signified by "the consummation
of the age." Evidently the good as well as the evil will then be eating
and drinking, for there is nothing evil in eating and drinking, and this
they also did before the flood, and it was not on this account that they
perished, but because they appropriated to themselves evil and falsity,
and conjoined these in themselves; this, therefore, is what is here
signified by "eating and drinking, and by contracting in marriage and
giving in marriage." \[32\] In Luke: The rich man said to his soul,
Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thy rest, eat,
drink (12:19). If that servant shall say in his heart, The Lord delayeth
to come; and shall begin to beat the servants, to eat, to drink, and to
be drunken (12:45). So, too, by surfeiting and drunkenness, in the same:
Jesus said, Take heed to yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down
with surfeiting and drunkenness (Luke 21:34). It seems as if "eating and
drinking" and "surfeiting" in these passages mean such luxury and
intemperance as those indulge in who follow appetite only; this is
indeed the natural literal sense of these words; but in their spiritual
sense they mean the appropriation of evil and falsity, as can be seen
from the passages cited above, where this is signified by "eating and
drinking," also from this, that the Word in the letter is natural, but
interiorly is spiritual; the spiritual sense is for the angels, and the
natural for men. \[33\] Besides these many other passages might be cited
from the Word, testifying and confirming that "to eat" signifies to
receive, perceive, and appropriate to oneself such things as nourish the
soul; for "to eat" spiritually is simply to imbue the mind with its own
food, which is to wish to know, understand, and become wise in such
things as pertain to eternal life. That this is the signification of "to
eat" can be seen also from the signification of "bread" and "food," as
also of "famine" and "hunger," and of "wine" and "water," which have
been treated of above in their proper places. Since "to eat" means to
perceive the quality of a thing, and this is perceived by its taste, it
is from correspondence that in human language taste \[sapor\] and to
have a taste \[sapere\] are predicated of the perception of a thing, and
from this comes wisdom \[sapientia\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="618.">618.</span></span>

And it shall make bitter thy belly, signifies that inwardly it was
undelightful, because outwardly it was adulterated. This is evident from
the signification of "to be bitter" or "bitterness," as meaning
undelightful because of adulterated truth (of which presently); and from
the signification of the "belly," as meaning what is interior. The
"belly" means what is interior, because after this it is said that "in
the mouth it was as honey, sweet," and the "mouth" means what is
exterior, for what is taken in by the mouth is chewed and passed down
into the belly, thus going from the exterior to the interior and
entering into the viscera of man; but as to the signification of "belly"
it shall be told presently. "Bitter" (or bitterness) signifies what is
undelightful because of adulterated truth, and therefore "to make
bitter" signifies to render undelightful, because what is sweet becomes
bitter and thus undelightful by a mixture with something offensive; from
this comes the bitterness of wormwood, gall, and myrrh. Now as "sweet"
signifies what is delightful from the good of truth and the truth of
good, so "bitter" signifies what is undelightful because of adulterated
truth. What is undelightful thence is not perceived and felt as bitter
by anyone in the natural world, but by the spirit and angel in the
spiritual world; for every adulterated good of truth, when it is changed
with them into taste, is clearly perceived as bitter. For spirits and
angels equally with men have taste, but the taste of spirits and angels
flows forth from a spiritual source, but that of men from a natural
source; the taste of bitterness with spirits is from the adulterated
truth of good, but with men it is from a mixture of what is sweet with
what is offensive. John's sensation of bitterness was also from a
spiritual origin, for he was in the spirit, otherwise he could not have
eaten the little book. Adulterated truth means the truth of good applied
to evil and mixed with its falsity, and this is done when the truths of
the sense of the letter of the Word are applied to filthy loves, and are
thus mixed with evils. This undelightfulness is what is here signified
by the bitterness of the belly. \[2\] It shall also be told briefly what
is meant by what is interior in the Word, that is, the interiors of the
Word. The interiors of the Word are the things contained in its internal
or spiritual sense; these truths are genuine truths; to these the
exterior truths of the Word correspond, which are the truths in the
external or natural sense, called the sense of the letter and the
literal sense. When the exterior things of the Word, or the truths in
the sense of the letter or the literal sense of the Word, are falsified
and adulterated, then the interior truths of the Word are falsified and
adulterated; for this reason, when a man applies the Word in the sense
of the letter to the evils of earthly loves, it becomes undelightful to
angels, who are in the internal or spiritual sense of the Word, and this
undelightfulness is like that of bitterness. From this it can be seen
that "the little book would make bitter, and did make bitter, the
belly," signifies that the Word was inwardly undelightful. This
undelightfulness thus far spoken of is spiritual undelightfulness; but
there is also a spiritual-natural undelightfulness that is also meant by
this "bitterness," which is that the truth of doctrine inwardly gathered
from the sense of the letter of the Word and called its literal sense,
is undelightful to those who are in falsities of evil; for this relates
to the understanding of the Word by the men of the church at its end,
when they are for the most part in falsities from evil; and to such the
falsities of evil, confirmed from the sense of the letter of the Word,
are delightful, <span id="fr_270"></span>[618-1](#fn_270.md) but truths
confirmed from the literal sense of the Word are undelightful. This,
too, is signified by "the little book made bitter the belly, but in the
mouth was like honey, sweet." \[3\] That "bitter" signifies the truth of
good adulterated can also be seen from the Word where "bitter" is
mentioned, as in the following passages. In Isaiah: Woe unto them that
call evil good and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for
darkness; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter! Woe unto the
mighty to drink wine, and to the men of strength to mingle strong drink
(5:20, 22). Evidently good and truth adulterated are here signified by
"bitter," for it is said, "Woe unto them that call evil good, and good
evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness," which
signifies the adulteration of good and the falsification of truth; for
good is adulterated when "good is called evil and when evil is called
good," and truth is falsified when "darkness is put for light and light
for darkness," "darkness" meaning falsities, and "light" truths. This
makes clear that like things are signified by "putting bitter for sweet
and sweet for bitter," also by "Woe unto the mighty to drink wine, and
to the men of strength to mingle strong drink;" "the mighty to drink
wine" signify those who adulterate the truth of the Word, and "the men
of strength to mingle strong drink" signify those who falsify it, "wine"
and "strong drink" meaning the truths of the Word, and "the mighty" and
"men of strength" those who excel in ingenuity and skill in adulterating
these. \[4\] In the same: The new wine shall mourn, the vine shall
languish, all the glad in heart shall sigh. They shall not drink wine
with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it (Isa.
24:7, 9). "The new wine that shall mourn," and "the vine that shall
languish," signify the truth of the Word and of the church which has
been lost, "new wine" signifying the truth of the Word, and the "vine"
the truth of the doctrine of the church; "all the glad in heart shall
sigh, and they shall not drink wine with a song," signifies that
internal blessedness of mind and felicity of heart will perish because
of the loss of the truth of spiritual good; "strong drink shall be
bitter to them that drink it," signifies the truth of good made
undelightful by its falsification and adulteration. \[5\] In Moses: The
waters in Marah, that they were unable to drink because of the
bitterness, were healed by the wood that was cast into them (Exod.
15:23-25). "The waters in Marah, that they were unable to drink because
of their bitterness," represented truths adulterated, "waters"
signifying truths, and "bitterness" adulteration. "Healing them by wood
cast into them" represented the good of love and of life dispelling
falsity and opening truth, and thus restoring it; for all truth is
adulterated by the evil of life and of love, consequently it is opened
and restored by the good of love and of life, because all truth is of
good, and the good of love is like a fire, from which truth appears in
light. \[6\] The like is signified by: The pottage into which the sons
of the prophets cast the wild gourds or the bitter wild grapes, and
which Elisha healed by casting in meal (2 Kings 4:38-41). "The pottage
into which they cast the bitter gourds" signifies the Word falsified;
and the "meal" that was cast in, by which it was healed, signifies truth
from good; for the truth that is from good dissipates the falsities from
which is falsification. \[7\] Because the sons of Jacob perverted all
the truths of the Word, and by applying them to themselves and to
earthly loves falsified and adulterated them, it is said of them in the
song of Moses: That their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields
of Gomorrah, and their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are of
bitternesses (Deut. 32:32). A "vine" signifies the church in respect to
truth, consequently also the truth of the church; and "the grapes"
signify the goods therefrom, which are the goods of charity, and
"clusters", the goods of faith; from which it is evident that "clusters
of bitternesses" signify the goods of faith adulterated. \[8\] In the
same: That the waters of the curse should be given to the wife accused
by her husband of adultery, and if she was <span
id="fr_271"></span>[618-2](#fn_271.md) guilty the waters would become
bitternesses in her, and the belly would swell and the thigh fall away
(Num. 5:12-29). The marriage of man and wife signifies the marriage of
truth and good, for love truly conjugial descends from that spiritual
marriage; therefore "adultery" signifies the conjunction of falsity and
evil, and this was why "if she was guilty the waters became
bitternesses," which signifies the adulteration of good; and as the
"belly" signified conjugial love, in like manner as the womb, and also
the thigh, so "the belly swelled and the thigh fell away," which
signifies in the spiritual sense that the conjugial or conjugial love
itself, spiritual and natural, had perished; "the womb" or "belly"
signifying spiritual conjugial love, and the "thigh" natural conjugial
love. From this it can be seen that "bitter" and "bitterness" signify in
general the falsification and adulteration of truth and good, and that
the various kinds of these are signified by "gall," "wormwood," "myrrh,"
"wild grapes," "wild gourds," and many others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="619.">619.</span></span>

But in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey, signifies outwardly
delightful. This is evident from the signification of "mouth," as being
what is exterior; for this treats of the little book and eating it up,
and "the little book" signifies the Word, and "eating it up" signifies
perception and exploration; thence "the mouth," which first receives,
means the external of the Word. It is evident also from the
signification of "sweet as honey," as being the delight of natural good.
The external of the Word was "sweet as honey," that is, thus delightful,
because the external of the Word is such that it can be applied to any
love whatever, or to any principle derived therefrom; and these can be
confirmed by it. The external of the Word, which is the sense of its
letter, is such because many things in it are written in accordance with
the appearances presented to the natural man, and many appearances, when
not interiorly understood, are fallacies, like the fallacies of the
senses. Those, therefore, who love to live for the body and for the
world, by means of these appearances draw over the external of the Word
to confirm evils of life and falsities of faith. \[2\] This was done
especially by the sons of Jacob, who applied all things of the Word to
themselves, and from the sense of the letter they held the belief, and
also maintain it to this day, that they were chosen in preference to
others, and therefore were a holy nation; that their Jerusalem, the
temple there, the ark, the altar, the sacrifices, with innumerable other
things, were holy of themselves; they did not know, and did not wish to
know, that the holiness of all those things proceeded solely from this,
that they represented things Divine proceeding from the Lord that are
called celestial and spiritual, and are the holy things of heaven and
the church, and that to think that these are holy of themselves, and not
because of the Divine things they represent, would be to falsify and
adulterate the Word by applying it to themselves and to their own loves.
It was similar with their belief respecting the Messiah, that he would
be king of the world, and would raise them above all other nations and
peoples throughout the globe; not to mention other things which they
gathered from the mere sense of the letter of the Word, which to them
were sweet as honey in the mouth. This is why the things in the
spiritual sense of the Word are undelightful, for in that sense are the
truths themselves which are not according to appearances; as that the
Jewish nation itself was not holy, but worse than every other nation,
consequently that it was not chosen; that the city of Jerusalem merely
signifies the Lord's church and doctrine respecting Him and the holy
things of heaven and the church; and that the temple, the ark, the
altar, and the sacrifices represented the Lord and the holy things that
proceed from Him, and that for this and no other reason were they holy.
These are truths that are stored up inwardly in the sense of the letter
of the Word, that is, in its internal spiritual sense; and these truths
they deny, because, as was said, they have falsified and adulterated the
Word in the sense of the letter; and these things therefore are
undelightful to them, like foods that are bitter in the belly. \[3\] It
is said that the little book was "in the mouth sweet as honey," because
"honey" signifies the delight of natural good; that "honey" signifies
that delight can be seen from the following passages. In Ezekiel: It was
said to the prophet, Open wide thy mouth and eat that I give thee. And I
saw and behold, a hand was put forth unto me, and lo, the roll of a book
was therein; and when he had spread it before me it was written in front
and behind, and written thereon were dirges, moaning, and woe. Then he
said unto me, Son of man, eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of
Israel. Then he said unto me, Feed thy belly and fill thy bowels with
this roll that I give thee; and when I ate it, it was in my mouth as
honey for sweetness. And he said, Go to the house of Israel and speak my
words unto them (2:8-10; 3:1-4). These things involve things altogether
similar to those in Revelation. The command to the prophet Ezekiel "to
eat the roll of the book" involves something similar as the command to
John "to eat the little book," namely, to explore how the Divine truth
which is in the Word is yet received, perceived, and appropriated by
those who are of the church; for the prophet Ezekiel and John represent
the doctrine of truth and the Word, therefore the exploration was made
with them. It was made by eating a book, because "to eat" signifies to
perceive and thus to appropriate, as has been shown above; and when this
has been ascertained, namely, how the Word was still perceived, it is
said to the prophet Ezekiel that "he should go to the house of Israel
and speak to them the words of God;" also to the prophet John that "he
must prophesy," that is, still teach the Word in the church; and this
because the book was perceived to be "in his mouth sweet as honey," that
is, because the Word in the sense of the letter is still delightful, but
for the reason that this sense can be applied to any principles of
falsity and to any loves of evil, and can thus serve them in confirming
the delights of the natural life separated from the delights of the
spiritual life; and when these are separated they become mere delights
of the loves of the body and of the world whence are principles of
falsity from fallacies. \[4\] In Isaiah: A virgin shall conceive and
bear a son, and shall call His name God-with-us. Butter and honey shall
He eat, that He may know to reject the evil and to choose the good
(7:14, 15). That this was said of the Lord is proved in Matthew (1:23).
Anyone can see that "butter and honey" do not mean here butter and
honey, but something Divine corresponding to them, for it is added,
"that He may know to reject the evil and to choose the good," and that
is not known by eating butter and honey; but "butter" signifies the
delight of spiritual good, and "honey" the delight of natural good,
consequently the two signify the Lord's Divine spiritual and Divine
natural, and thus His Human, interior and exterior. That the Lord's
Human is meant can be seen from its being said that "a virgin shall
conceive and bear a son;" and that it is Divine from its being said,
"and shall call His name God-with-us," "to call a name" signifying the
quality of a thing, here what the Divine is, for He was to be called
"God-with-us." \[5\] "Butter and honey" also signify the delight of
spiritual and natural good in these words in the same chapter: Butter
and honey shall everyone eat that remains in the land (verse 22). "That
remains" mean those that are inwardly and also outwardly good from the
Lord, consequently who receive the good proceeding from the Lord in
truths; the blessedness therefrom of the internal or spiritual man, and
also of the external or natural man, is signified by "butter and honey."
\[6\] In Job: He shall suck the poison of asps; the viper's tongue shall
slay him. He shall not see the streams, the flowings of the brooks of
honey and butter (20:16, 17). This is said of hypocrites who talk well
and smoothly about God, about the neighbor, and about heaven and the
church, and yet think altogether otherwise; and because they cunningly
contrive by these means to captivate minds, although in heart they
cherish what is infernal, it is said, "He shall suck the poison of asps,
the viper's tongue shall slay him." That such have no delight in natural
good or spiritual good is meant by "He shall not see the streams, the
flowings of the brooks of honey and butter," "streams" meaning the
things of intelligence, and "the flowings of the brooks of honey and
butter," the things therefrom that are of affection and love, which are
the very delights of heavenly life. Every delight of life that abides to
eternity is a delight of spiritual good and truth, and from that a
delight of natural good and truth; but hypocritical delight is a natural
delight separate from spiritual delight, and this delight is turned in
the other life into what is direfully infernal. Evidently "butter and
honey" do not mean here butter and honey, for where, in the world, can
there be found "flowings of brooks of honey and butter"? \[7\] "Milk and
honey" have a similar signification as "butter and honey;" and as "milk"
signifies the delight of spiritual good, and "honey" the delight of
natural good, and these delights are with those who are of the Lord's
church, therefore the land of Canaan, which signifies the church, was
called: A land flowing with milk and honey (Exod. 3:8, 17; Lev. 20:24;
Num. 13:27; 14:8; Deut. 6:3; 11:9; 26:9, 15; 27:3; 31:20; Josh. 5:6;
Jer. 11:5; 32:22; Ezek. 20:6). That in the Word "the land of Canaan"
means the church has been shown above (n. 29, 304, 431); and the church
is with those only who are in spiritual good and at the same time in
natural good; in such the church is formed by the Lord; for the church
is in man and not outside of him, consequently is not with those with
whom these goods are not. These goods with their delights are signified
by "milk and honey." \[8\] There was also much honey in the land of
Canaan at that time, because at that time the church of the Lord was
there, as can be seen from the first book of Samuel, where it is said:
That they came into the forest, where there was honey upon the face of
the ground, and there was a stream of honey, and Jonathan's eyes were
opened by tasting the honey (14:25-27, 29). "Jonathan's eyes were opened
by tasting the honey" because "honey" corresponds to natural good and
its delight, and this good gives intelligence and enlightens, from which
Jonathan knew that he had done evil; as we read in Isaiah, "He shall eat
butter and honey, that he may know to reject the evil and to choose the
good." For at that time correspondences exhibited their effects
outwardly, since all things of the Israelitish Church consisted of
correspondences, which represented and signified things celestial and
spiritual. \[9\] Again, "oil and honey" have a similar signification as
"butter and honey" in the following passages. In Moses: He made him to
ride on the high places of the earth, and fed him with the produce of
the fields; he made him to suck honey out of the cliff, and oil out of
the flint of the rock (Deut. 32:13). This is in the song of Moses, which
treats of the church in its beginning, and afterward in its progress,
and finally in its end. Those that constituted the Ancient Church are
described by these words, not those however who constituted the
Israelitish Church, for these were evil from the beginning even to the
end, as can be seen from their fathers in Egypt, and afterwards in the
wilderness; but the Ancient Church, the men of which are meant by "their
fathers," was that which the Lord "made to ride on the high places of
the earth, and fed with the produce of the fields." That to these the
good of natural love and the good of spiritual love with their delights
were given by means of truths, from which they had their intelligence
and according to which they lived, is signified by "he made him to suck
honey out of the cliff, and oil out of the flint of the rock," "honey"
signifying the delight of natural love, "oil," the delight of spiritual
love, and "the cliff" and "the flint of the rock," truth from the Lord.
(That "oil" signifies the good of love and charity, may be seen above,
n. 375; and that "cliffs" and "rocks" signify truth from the Lord, n.
411, 443.) \[10\] In David: I fed <span
id="fr_272"></span>[619-1](#fn_272.md) them with the fat of wheat, and with
honey out of the rock I satisfied them (Ps. 81:16). "The fat of wheat"
signifies the delight of spiritual good, and "honey out of the rock,"
the delight of natural good through truths from the Lord (as above). It
is to be known that natural good is not good unless there is also
spiritual good; for all good flows in through the spiritual man or mind
into the natural man or mind, and so far as the natural man or mind
receives the good of the spiritual man or mind so far man receives good;
that there may be good there must be both, or the two sides,
consequently natural good separated from spiritual good is in itself
evil, although by man it is still perceived as good. Since there must be
both, it is said in the passages cited and yet to be cited, "butter and
honey," "milk and honey;" "fat and honey," as also "oil and honey;" and
"butter," "milk," "fat," and "oil" signify the good of spiritual love,
and "honey" the good of natural love, together with their delights.
\[11\] In Ezekiel: Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver, and thy
garments were fine linen and silk and broidered work; thou didst eat
fine flour, honey, and oil, whence thou didst become exceeding
beautiful, and didst prosper even to a kingdom. But my bread which I
gave thee, and the fine flour and oil and honey with which I fed thee,
thou didst set before idols as an odor of rest (16:13, 19). This is said
about Jerusalem, which signifies the church, first the Ancient Church,
and afterwards the Israelitish Church. Of the Ancient Church it is said
"she was decked with gold and silver," which signifies the love of good
and truth that the men of that Church had; "the garments of fine linen,
silk, and broidered work," signify the knowledges of celestial,
spiritual, and natural truth, "fine linen" signifying truth from a
celestial origin, "silk" truth from a spiritual origin, and "broidered
work" truth from a natural origin, which is called knowledge
\[scientificum\]. "She ate fine flour, honey and oil," signifies the
perception of natural and spiritual truth and good, and their
appropriation, "to eat" signifying to be appropriated, "fine flour"
truth, "honey" natural good, and "oil" spiritual good, which were
appropriated to them by a life according to the truths above mentioned.
"She became exceeding beautiful and prospered even to a kingdom"
signifies to become intelligent and wise so as to constitute a church,
"beauty" signifying intelligence and wisdom, and a "kingdom" the church.
But of the Israelitish Church, which was merely in externals without
internals, whence the men of that church were idolatrous, it is said
that "they set the fine flour, honey, and oil before the images of a
male, or idols, as an odor of rest," that is, they perverted the truths
and goods of the church into falsities and evils, and thus profaned
them. \[12\] In the same: Judah and the land of Israel were thy
merchants in the wheats of Minnith and Pannag, and honey and oil and
balsam they gave for thy merchandise (Ezek. 27:17). This is said of
Tyre, which signifies the church in respect to the knowledges of truth
and good; so, too, "Tyre" signifies the knowledges of truth and good
themselves belonging to the church; "oil and honey" have a similar
signification as above. What is meant here in the spiritual sense by
"Judah and the land of Israel," by "the wheats of Minnith and Pannag,"
and by "balsam," also by "the merchandise of Tyre," may be seen
explained above (n. 433). \[13\] In Moses: A land of brooks of water, of
fountains and depths going forth from the valley and mountain; a land of
wheat and barley, and of vine and fig-tree and pomegranate; and of olive
oil and honey (Deut. 8:7, 8). This is said of the land of Canaan, which
means the church which is in celestial, spiritual, and natural good, and
in truths therefrom; but the contents of this verse are explained above
(n. 374, 403), showing that "oil and honey" here signify the good of
love in the internal or spiritual man and in the external or natural
man. \[14\] In David: The judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are
righteous altogether; more desirable than gold and than much fine gold;
and sweeter than honey and the dropping of honeycombs (Ps. 19:9, 10). In
the same: I have not departed from Thy judgment; for Thou hast
instructed me. How sweet are Thy words to my palate, more than honey to
my mouth (Ps. 119:102, 103). "Judgments" signify the truths and goods of
worship, therefore it is said "the judgments of Jehovah are truth, they
are righteous altogether;" "righteous" signifies the good of life and
worship therefrom; and as good is also signified by "gold" and "fine
gold," it is said that "they are more desirable than gold and than much
fine gold," "gold" meaning celestial good, "fine gold" spiritual good,
and "desirable" means what belongs to affection and love. Since the
goods by which a man is affected are delightful it is said that they are
"sweeter than honey and the dropping of honeycombs," and that "the words
of Jehovah are sweet to the palate, more than honey to the mouth,"
"sweet" signifying what is delightful, "honey" natural good, and "the
dropping of honeycombs" natural truth. And because "honey" means natural
good, and the "mouth" signifies what is external, it is said "more than
honey to my mouth," as in Revelation, that "the little book was sweet as
honey in the mouth." \[15\] In Luke: Jesus said to the disciples, who
believed that they saw a spirit, See My hands and My feet, that it is I
Myself; feel of Me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye
see Me having. Then He said to them, Have ye here anything to eat? And
they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb. And He took
it and did eat it before them (Luke 24:39, 41-43). From the series of
these words regarded in the spiritual sense it is very evident that
"honeycomb" and "honey" signify natural good, for the Lord disclosed to
His disciples that He had glorified or made Divine His whole Human, even
to its natural and sensual; this is signified by "hands and feet" and by
"flesh and bones," which they saw and felt, "hands and feet" signifying
the ultimate of man which is called the natural, "flesh" its good, and
"bones" its truth; for all things that are in the human body correspond
to spiritual things, the "flesh" corresponding to the good of the
natural man, and the "bones" to its truths. (On this correspondence, see
in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 87-102.) And this the Lord confirmed
by eating before the disciples of the broiled fish and honeycomb; "the
broiled fish" signifying the truth of good of the natural and sensual
man, and "the honeycomb," the good of the truth of the same. The Lord,
therefore, by letting them feel of Him, showed and confirmed that His
whole Human, even to its ultimates, was glorified, that is, made Divine;
and this He showed, too, by the eating, in that "He ate before them a
piece of broiled fish and of a honeycomb." \[16\] As "honey" signifies
the good of the natural man, so also: John the Baptist had his raiment
of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was
locusts and wild honey (Matt. 3:4; Mark 1:6). For John the Baptist
represented something similar as Elijah; wherefore it is also said that
"Elijah should come," by whom John is meant. Elijah represented the Lord
in relation to the Word, or the Word from the Lord; John had a similar
representation; and as the Word teaches that the Messiah or the Lord was
about to come, John was sent before to preach respecting the Lord's
coming, according to the predictions in the Word. And as John
represented the Word, therefore he represented the ultimates of the
Word, which are natural, by his raiment and also by his food, namely, by
his raiment of camel's hair and the leathern girdle about his loins;
"camel's hair" signifying the ultimates of the natural man, such as are
the exterior things of the Word, and "the leathern girdle about the
loins," the external bond and connection of these with the interior
things of the Word, which are spiritual. "Locust and wild honey" have a
like signification, "locust" signifying the truth of the natural man,
and "wild honey" its good. It is the same whether you say the truth and
good of the natural man or natural truth and good, such as the Word is
in its ultimate sense, which is called the sense of the letter or the
natural sense, for this was what John represented by his raiment and
food. \[17\] That: No leaven and no honey were to be offered in the
offerings made by fire to Jehovah (Lev. 2:11); because "leaven"
signifies the falsity of the natural man, and "honey" the delight of
good of the natural man, and in the contrary sense the delight of its
evil; this is also like leaven when it is mixed with such things as
signify things interiorly holy, for natural delight draws its own from
the delights of the love of self and of the world; and as the
Israelitish nation was in such delights more than other nations,
therefore they were forbidden to use honey in their sacrifices. (On the
signification of "honey," as meaning the delight of the good of the
natural man, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5650, 6857, 8056, 10137, 10530.)
\[18\] That: When Samson had rent the young lion he found in its carcass
a swarm of bees and honey, when he was about to take a wife from the
Philistine nation (Judges 14:8); signified the dissipation of faith
separated from charity, which the Philistine nation represented; for
this reason the Philistines were called "uncircumcised," and this term
signified that they were without spiritual love and charity and only in
natural love, which is the love of self and of the world. Because such a
faith destroys the good of charity it was represented by a young lion
that attacked Samson with intent to tear him in pieces, but as Samson
was a Nazirite, and by his Naziriteship represented the Lord in respect
to His ultimate natural, he rent the lion, and afterwards found in its
carcass "a swarm of bees and honey," and this signifies that when such
faith has been dissipated, the good of charity succeeds in its place.
The other things related of Samson in the book of Judges have a like
signification; for there is nothing written in the Word that does not
represent and signify such things as belong to heaven and the church,
and these can be known only by a knowledge of correspondences, and thus
from the spiritual sense of the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="620.">620.</span></span>

Verse 10. And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and
ate it up, signifies exploration. This is evident from the things that
precede, namely, that "the little book" means the Word, "the angel" the
Lord in relation to the Word, and "to devour or to eat it" means to
receive, perceive, and appropriate to oneself, consequently to explore,
here of what quality the understanding of the Word still is in the
church. Exploration is effected by means of a thing's being perceived
and the way in which it is perceived; it was effected with the prophet
John, because a "prophet" signifies the doctrine of the church, and in a
universal sense, the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="621.">621.</span></span>

And it was in my mouth as honey, sweet, signifies that the Word, in
respect to its external, or in respect to its sense of the letter, was
still perceived as the delight of good, but as delight only for the
reason that it served to confirm the principles of falsity, and the
loves of evil, that is, the principles arising from the love of self and
of the world, all of which are falsities. That the Word, which is meant
by "the little book," was perceived on this account to be "sweet as
honey," may be seen in what has been shown above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="622.">622.</span></span>

And when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter, signifies that it was
perceived and ascertained that the Word was inwardly undelightful
because of the adulterated truth of the sense of its letter. This is
evident from the explanations above (n. 617, 618), where there are like
words. The "belly" here signifies the interiors of the Word, which are
called spiritual, because exploration was represented by "devouring or
eating up the little book," which means the Word, and by its taste,
which means perception; therefore the first perception is signified by
the taste in the mouth, where the little book was "sweet as honey." The
first perception of the Word is such as is the perception of the sense
of its letter, that is, as the Word is outwardly. The other perception
however is signified by its taste when it has come into the belly, which
is said to be made bitter by it. This other perception of the Word is
such as the perception of its spiritual sense is, that is, as the Word
is inwardly. Consequently, as the "mouth" signifies what is exterior, so
here the "belly" signifies what is interior, because inwardly received
and ascertained. The "belly" signifies interior things because the belly
stores up the food inwardly, and "food" signifies everything that
nourishes the soul; also because the belly, like the bowels, is within
or in the midst of the body; for this reason the "belly," and also the
"bowels," signify in the Word interior things. \[2\] That the "belly,"
and the "bowels" signify interior things can be seen from the following
passages. In Ezekiel: Son of man, feed thy belly and fill thy bowels
with this roll (3:1, 3). This has a similar signification as what is now
being explained in Revelation, that "he took and ate up the little
book," for the "roll" has a similar signification as "the little book,"
namely, the Word, and "to feed the belly and fill the bowels with the
roll" signifies to explore how the Word is understood in the church,
which is done by the reading and perception of it. \[3\] In David: Fill
their belly with Thy treasure; the sons are fed to the full, and what
remains to them they leave to their babes (Ps. 17:14). "Treasure"
signifies the truth of the Word, "belly" the interior understanding, so
"to fill their belly with treasure" signifies to instruct their interior
understanding in the truths of the Word; that thence those who are
affected by truths are fully instructed is signified by "the sons are
fed to the full," "sons" signifying those who are in the affection of
truth; and the sons' "babes," truths in their birth; of such it is said
that "what remains to them they leave to their babes." It is here said
the interior understanding, for man has an exterior understanding and an
interior understanding; the exterior understanding is of the natural
mind, and the interior understanding is of the spiritual mind; the
interior understanding is signified by the "belly." \[4\] In John: Jesus
said, If anyone thirst let him come unto Me and drink. He that believeth
on Me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of
living water. This He said of the Spirit which they that believe on Him
were to receive (7:37-39). Thus the Lord describes Divine truth inwardly
perceived by those who are in the spiritual affection of truth; such are
meant by "those who thirst and come to the Lord and drink;" that such
shall have an understanding of Divine truth is signified by "out of his
belly shall flow rivers of living water," "rivers out of the belly"
meaning interior understanding or intelligence, and "living water,"
Divine truth from the Lord; and as "the Holy Spirit" means Divine truth
proceeding from the Lord, it is added "this He said of the Spirit which
they that believe on Him were to receive." \[5\] In Mark: Whatsoever
from without goeth into the man cannot render him unclean, because it
goeth not into his heart but into the belly; and is cast out into the
draught purging all foods. But that which goeth forth out of the man,
that rendereth the man unclean; for from within out of the heart of men
it goeth forth (7:18-21; Matt. 15:17-20). These words must be thus
understood, that all things, whether falsities or evils, that from
things seen or things heard flow into the thought of the understanding
and not into the affection of its will, do not affect or infect the man,
since the thought of a man's understanding, so far as it does not
proceed from the affection of his will, is not in the man but outside of
him, therefore it is not appropriated to him; it is similar with truth
and good. This the Lord teaches by correspondences when He says that
"that which enters through the mouth into the belly does not render a
man unclean, because it does not enter into the heart, for that which
enters into the belly is cast out into the draught;" which means that
whatever enters into the thought of man's understanding from without or
from the outside, whether from objects of sight or from objects of
speech or from objects of the memory, does not render him unclean, but
so far as it is not of his affection or will it is separated and cast
out, as what is taken into the belly is cast out into the draught. These
spiritual things the Lord explained by natural things, since the foods
that are taken into the mouth and thus pass into the belly signify such
things as man takes in spiritually and with which he nourishes his soul;
this is why the "belly" corresponds to the thought of the understanding
and signifies it. That the "heart" signifies the affection of man's will
has been shown above; also that only that which is made a part of a
man's affection or will is appropriated to him. Evidently spiritual, not
natural, things are here meant, for the Lord says that "out of the heart
proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, whoredoms, thefts, false
testimonies, blasphemies." Since the falsities and evils that enter from
without into the thoughts enter from the hells, and if not received by
man with the will's affection are cast back into the hells, it is said
that "they are cast out into the draught," for the "draught" signifies
hell; and for the reason that in the hells all things are unclean, and
those who are there have been cast out of heaven, which is like a man in
form, and is therefore called the Greatest Man and also corresponds to
all things of man, while the hells correspond to what is cast out of the
belly of the Greatest Man or heaven; this is why hell is meant in the
spiritual sense by the "draught." The "belly" is said "to purge all
foods," because the "belly" signifies the thought of the understanding,
as has been said above, and "foods" signify all spiritual nourishments,
and the thought of the understanding is what separates unclean things
from what are clean, and thus purges. \[6\] In Jeremiah: Jehovah God
hath said, Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath confounded Me, he
hath placed Me as an empty vessel, he hath swallowed Me up as a whale,
he hath filled his belly with My delicacies, he hath thrust Me out
(51:34). "Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon" signifies the profanation
of Divine truth; and as those who profane it drink it in more than
others and apply it to filthy loves, especially to the love of rule,
even to the transference to themselves of all Divine power, this is
signified by "he hath swallowed me up as a whale, he hath filled his
belly with my delicacies," "whale" signifying the lowest natural, in
which those are who are in the love of self, and "delicacies" meaning
the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, so "to fill the belly
with them" signifies to drink in and to profane them. \[7\] In David: Be
gracious unto me, O Jehovah, for I am in distress; mine eye wasteth away
with vexation, my soul and my belly (Ps. 31:9). "Eye, soul, and belly,"
here signify the understanding and exterior and interior thought of
truth therefrom; thus the "belly" signifies the interiors of the
understanding, which are said "to waste away with vexation" when they
are destroyed by falsities. \[8\] In the same: Our soul is bowed down to
the dust, our belly cleaveth unto the earth (Ps. 44:25). Here, too,
"soul" and "belly" signify in the spiritual sense the thought of the
understanding; and "bowed down to the dust," and "cleaving to the
earth," signify to be imbued with falsities, for "dust" and "earth"
signify what is infernal and damned. What is infernal and damned is
signified also by "going upon the belly" and "eating dust," as was said
to the serpent: Be thou cursed above all beasts, and above all the wild
beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou
eat all the days of thy life (Gen. 3:14). For this reason also: It was
strictly forbidden to eat anything that goeth upon the belly, for it was
an abomination (Lev. 11:42). "Dust" and "the cleaving of the belly to
the earth" signify falsity infernal and damned, because in the spiritual
world the hells are under the lands, and through the lands there,
falsities of evil are exhaled from the hells; also because the "belly"
signifies from correspondence the interiors of the understanding and of
thought, and these, if they cleave to the earths there, are infected and
imbued with the falsities of evil. For this reason, in the spiritual
world no one lies with the belly upon the ground; and indeed, to walk
there with the feet upon the ground means to touch and drink in what is
exhaled from the hells with the corporeal natural, which corresponds to
the soles of the feet; and this natural has no communication with the
thoughts of the understanding, except in those who are in evils in
respect to life and in falsities in respect to doctrine. \[9\] In Job:
The belly prepareth deceit (15:35). And again: I am filled with words,
the spirit of my belly causes anguish for me; and my belly, like wine,
is not opened (32:18, 19); which means inability to open the thoughts of
one's understanding. In Jeremiah: O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from evil,
that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thoughts of thy iniquity lodge
in thy belly? (4:14). Here thoughts are plainly attributed to the belly,
for it is said, "How long shall thoughts of iniquity lodge in thy
belly?" and evil is attributed to the heart, because the heart
corresponds to the will, in which evil has its seat. In David: There is
no certainty in the mouth of anyone; perditions are their belly; their
throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue (Ps. 5:9).
Here "perditions," that is, evil thoughts, are attributed to "the
belly." In the same: The belly of man and the heart are deep (Ps. 64:6).
Here "the belly of man" signifies the thoughts of falsity, and "the
heart" the affections of evil; the latter belong to the will, the former
to the understanding. In Habakkuk: My belly trembled, my lips quivered
at the voice (3:16). "My belly trembled" signifies grief of thought,
therefore it is added, "my lips quivered at the voice," which signifies
a consequent stammering of the speech: The bowels of the whale in which
Jonah was three days and three nights (Jonah 1:17); signifies the hells
where there are most direful falsities, with which he was encompassed,
consequently grievous temptations, as can be seen from the prophecy of
Jonah in the next chapter, where it is also said: Out of the belly of
hell have I cried, and Thou hast heard my voice (2:2). \[10\] The
"bowels" have a similar signification as the "belly," as can be seen
from the following passages. In Isaiah: My bowels are moved like a harp
for Moab, and My inward part for Kir-heres (16:11). In David: Bless
Jehovah, O my soul, and all my bowels the name of His holiness (Ps.
103:1). In the same: I have desired to do Thy will, O my God, and Thy
law is in my bowels (Ps. 40:8). In Ezekiel: Their silver and their gold
shall not be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah's anger; they
shall not satisfy their soul, neither fill their bowels (7:19). "Their
silver and gold" signify falsities and evils of a religion that is from
self-intelligence and self-will; that from these there is no spiritual
nourishment, or intelligence and affection of good, is signified by
"they shall not satisfy their soul, neither fill their bowels." Because
the "bowels" signify the interiors of the thought, and these are what
are affected by grief, such grief is described in the Word by "being
moved in the bowels" (as Isa. 63:15; Jer. 31:20; Lam. 1:20; Matt. 9:36;
Mark 6:34; 8:2; Luke 1:78; 7:12, 13; 10:33, 34; 15:20). \[11\] As the
"belly" signifies the interiors of the thought or of the understanding,
so "the fruit of the belly" signifies in the spiritual sense the goods
of the understanding, and "sons" its truths. Thus in David: Lo, sons are
the heritage of Jehovah, and the fruit of the belly is His reward (Ps.
127:3). In Isaiah: They shall have no compassion on the fruit of the
belly, their eye shall not spare the sons (13:18). And in Job: Pitying I
mourn for the son of my belly (19:17). In Moses: He will bless the fruit
of the belly and the fruit of the ground (Deut. 7:13). In Hosea: Even
when they have brought forth I will slay the desires of their belly
(9:11, 16). "The fruit of the belly" and "the desires of the belly"
signify in the sense of the letter, natural offspring, but in the
spiritual sense spiritual offspring, which is knowledge \[scientia\],
intelligence, and wisdom, for man is reborn into these when he is
regenerated; this is why "births," "sons," "daughters," and other terms
pertaining to nativity signify such things as pertain to spiritual
nativity, that is, regeneration; for angels, who perceive the Word
spiritually, know of no other births or "fruits of the belly." \[12\]
For the same reason "womb" and "belly" have this signification in the
following passages. In Isaiah: O that thou hadst hearkened to My
commandments! Thy seed would have been as the sand, and the issue of thy
bowels like the grains thereof (48:18, 19). In David: I was cast upon
Thee; from my mother's belly Thou art my God (Ps. 22:10). In the same:
Thou dost possess my reins; Thou hast covered me in my mother's belly
(Ps. 139:13). In the same: The wicked are estranged from the womb; they
err from the belly, speaking falsehood (Ps. 58:3). So elsewhere. \[13\]
The "belly" or "bowels" signify the interiors of the thought or of the
understanding, because there are two lives with man, the life of the
understanding and the life of the will; to these two fountains of life
all things of the body correspond; consequently under their direction
all things of the body are acted upon and act, even to the extent that
any part of the body that does not suffer itself to be put in action by
the understanding and the will has no life. For this reason the
universal body is subject to the control of these two lives, for all
things in the body that are moved, and so far as they are moved by the
respiration of the lungs, are subject to the control of the life of the
understanding; and all things in the body that are brought into action,
and so far as they are brought into action by the pulsation of the
heart, are subject to the control of the life of the will. This is why
"soul" and "heart" are often mentioned in the Word, and why the "soul"
signifies the life of the understanding, also the life of faith, for the
soul is predicated of respiration; and why the "heart" signifies the
life of the will, also the life of the love. For the same reason "the
belly and bowels" are predicated of thought, which is of the
understanding, and the "heart" is predicated of affection, which is of
the will.

Verse 11. And he said to me, Thou must again prophesy upon peoples and
nations and tongues and many kings. 11. "And he said to me, Thou must
again prophesy," signifies Divine command to still teach the Word (n.
624); "upon peoples and nations and tongues and many kings," signifies
with all who are in truths and goods in respect to life, and at the same
time in goods and truths in respect to doctrine, consequently to teach
the Word in respect to the goods of life and the truths of doctrine (n.
625).

<span class="margnote"><span id="624.">624.</span></span>

Verse 11. And he said to me, Thou must again prophesy, signifies Divine
command to still teach the Word. This is evident from the signification
of "saying," when the angel speaks, by whom in this chapter the Lord in
relation to the Word is represented, as being command, for what the Lord
says is a command; also from the signification of "to prophesy," as
being to teach the Word (of which presently). It is said he must still
teach the Word, because such understanding of the Word as still remained
in the church was explored, and it was found that the Word was
delightful in respect to the sense of the letter, for this is signified
by "the little book was in the mouth sweet as honey," "the little book"
meaning the Word. It was commanded to still teach the Word in the
church, because its end was not yet come. The end of the church is
described by "the sounding of the seventh angel;" but here the state of
the church next before the end is described by "the sounding of the
sixth angel;" this state of the church is here treated of. Before the
end, the Word when taught is still delightful to some, but not so in the
last state of the church or its end, for then the Lord opens the
interior things of the Word, which are undelightful, as has been said
above in treating of the eating up of the little book and its making the
belly bitter. \[2\] Why the Word must still be taught although its
interior truths are undelightful, and why the Last Judgment does not
come until the consummation, that is, when there is no longer any good
or truth remaining with the men of the church, is wholly unknown in the
world, although known in heaven. The reason is that there are two
classes of men upon whom judgment is effected; one class consists of the
well-disposed, and the other of those who are not well-disposed. The
well-disposed are the angels in the ultimate heaven, most of whom are
simple, because they have not cultivated the understanding by interior
truths, but only by exterior truths from the sense of the letter of the
Word, according to which they have lived; for this reason their
spiritual mind, which is the interior mind, was not indeed, closed, but
neither has it been opened, as it is with those who have received
interior truths in doctrine and in life; this is why they have become
simple in respect to spiritual things, and are called well-disposed. But
the ill-disposed are those who have lived outwardly as Christians but
inwardly have admitted evils of every kind into the thought and into the
will, so that while in the external form they appeared to be angels, in
internal form they were devils. When such come into the other life they
come into association for the most part with the well-disposed, that is,
with the simple good who are in the ultimate heaven; for exterior things
consociate, and the simple good are such that what appears in external
form to be good they believe to be good, their thought not penetrating
farther. These ill-disposed must be separated from the well-disposed
before the Last Judgment comes, and also afterward and they can only be
separated successively. This is why before the time of the Last Judgment
the Word must still be taught, although interiorly, that is, in respect
to its interiors, it is undelightful; and as these interior things are
undelightful they do not receive them, but only such things from the
sense of the letter of the Word as favor their loves and the principles
derived from them, on account of which the Word in respect to the sense
of the letter is delightful to them. It is therefore by means of these
interior things that the well-disposed are separated from the
ill-disposed. \[3\] That for this reason the time is extended after the
Last Judgment before the new church is fully established, is an arcanum
from heaven which at this day cannot enter the understanding except with
a few; yet this is what the Lord teaches in Matthew: The servants of the
householder coming said unto him, Didst thou not sow good seed in thy
field? Whence then are these tares? And they said, Wilt thou then that
we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the
tares ye root up at the same time the wheat with them. Let both,
therefore, grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest I
will say to the reapers, Gather ye first the tares, and bind them in
bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into the barn. He that hath
sowed the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the good
seed are the sons of the kingdom; the harvest is the consummation of the
age. As then the tares are gathered up and burned in the fire, so shall
it be in the consummation of this age (13:27-30, 37-43). "The
consummation of the age" signifies the last time of the church; that
until then the well-disposed are not to be separated from the
ill-disposed, because they are consociated by outward things, is
signified by "lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up at the same
time the wheat with them." (On this see the small work on The Last
Judgment, n. 70.) \[4\] "To prophesy" signifies to teach the Word,
because a "prophet" means in the highest sense the Lord in relation to
the Word, and in a relative sense one who teaches the Word, but in an
abstract sense the Word itself, and also doctrine from the Word. This a
"prophet" signifies, therefore "to prophesy" signifies to teach the Word
and doctrine from the Word. That such is the signification of "to
prophesy" and "prophet" can be seen from passages in the Word where
these are mentioned, understood in the spiritual sense, as in the
following. In Matthew: Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have
we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name cast out demons, and in
Thy name done many mighty works? But then will I profess unto them, I
know you not; depart from Me, ye that work iniquity (7:22, 23). This
treats of salvation, that one is saved not by knowing the Word and
teaching it, but by doing it; for just before, it is said that those
only will enter the kingdom of the heavens who do the will of God (verse
21); and just after, that he who hears the Lord's words and does them is
a prudent man, but he who hears and does not is a foolish man (verses
24-27). This makes clear what these words mean, namely, that worship of
the Lord by prayers and by words of the mouth only is meant by "Many
will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord;" and to teach the Word and
doctrinals from the Word is meant by "have we not prophesied by Thy
name?;" "name" signifying according to doctrine from the Word, and "to
prophesy" to teach; "to cast out demons" signifies to deliver from
falsities of religion, "demons" meaning the falsities of religion; "to
do many mighty works" signifies to convert many. But because these works
were done not for the Lord's sake, nor for the sake of truth and good
and the salvation of souls, but for the sake of self and the world, thus
only that they might appear in outward form, so in reference to
themselves it was not good but evil that was done; this is meant by the
Lord's saying "I know you not, ye that work iniquity." Doing such things
does not appear to be working iniquity, and yet everything that a man
does for the sake of self and of the world is iniquity, since there is
in it no love of the Lord and of the neighbor, but only the love of self
and the world; and his own love awaits everyone after death. \[5\] In
the same: In the consummation of the age many false prophets shall arise
and shall lead many astray. There shall arise false Christs and false
prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray,
if possible, even the elect (Matt. 24:11, 24; Mark 13:22). "False
prophets" and "false Christs and false prophets" do not mean prophets in
the common acceptation of the word, but mean all those who pervert the
Word and teach falsities; such are also "false Christs," since "Christ"
signifies the Lord in respect to Divine truths, so "false Christs"
signify Divine truths falsified. "To show great signs and wonders"
signifies the efficacy and power of falsities through confirmations from
the sense of the letter of the Word, and it is by this that signs and
wonders are produced in the spiritual world; for the sense of the letter
of the Word, however falsified, has power; respecting which wonderful
things might be related. "The elect" signify those who are in spiritual
good, that is, who are in the good of charity. \[6\] In the same: He
that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a
prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a
righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward. Yea, whosoever
shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water
only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you he shall not lose
his reward (Matt. 10:41, 42). This no one can understand unless he knows
what is signified by "prophet," "righteous man," "disciple," and "little
ones," also by "receiving them in their name." "Prophet" in an abstract
sense signifies the truth of doctrine, "disciple" the good of doctrine,
"a righteous man" the good of life, and "to receive them in their name"
signifies to receive these things from the love of them; thus, "to
receive a prophet in the name of a prophet" signifies to love the truth
of doctrine because it is truth, or to receive truth for its own sake;
"to receive a righteous man in the name of a righteous man" signifies to
love good and to do it because it is good, thus to receive it from the
Lord from love or the affection of the heart; for he who loves truth and
good for their own sakes loves them from themselves, thus from the Lord
from whom they proceed, and as he does not love them for the sake of
self and the world, he loves them spiritually, and all spiritual love
continues with man after death and gives eternal life. "To receive a
reward" signifies to carry with oneself that love, and thus to receive
the blessedness of heaven; "to give to drink to one of the little ones a
cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple" signifies to love
innocence from innocence, and from it to love good and truth from the
Word and to teach them; "to give to drink a cup of cold water,"
signifies to love and teach from a little innocence, "little ones"
signifying the innocent, and in an abstract sense innocence itself; "to
give to drink a cup of cold water" signifies to teach from a little
innocence, and "a disciple" the good of doctrine from the Lord; "to give
water to little ones to drink" signifies to teach truth from spiritual
innocence, and also to teach truths to the innocent. This is the
spiritual interpretation of these words, and unless this is known who
can know what is meant by "receiving a prophet and a righteous man in
the name of a prophet and righteous man" and that "they shall receive
the reward of a prophet and a righteous man"? "Reward" signifies love
with its delights enduring to eternity. \[7\] In the same: Many prophets
and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see but have
not seen them, and to hear the things which ye hear but have not heard
them (Matt. 13:17). "Prophets and righteous men" mean in the spiritual
sense all who are in the truths of doctrine and in the good of life
according to truths; and "to see and hear" signifies to understand and
perceive, here interior truths proceeding from the Lord, for when man
understands and perceives these and also does them, he is reformed.
Interior truths proceeding from the Lord are meant, because the Lord,
when He was in the world, disclosed such truths. In the sense of the
letter this means to see and hear the Lord, but as the Lord is the
Divine truth itself in heaven and in the church, and as in consequence
all Divine truths are from the Lord, and the Lord Himself taught them,
and continually teaches them by means of the Word, so "to see and hear
the Lord" signifies to understand and perceive these. \[8\] In Joel: I
will pour out My spirit upon all flesh; that your sons and your
daughters may prophesy, your old men dream dreams, and your young men
see visions (2:28). This is said of the Lord's coming, and of the
perception of Divine truth by those who receive the Lord and believe in
Him; the "spirit" that will be poured out upon all flesh signifies the
Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, for this is meant in the Word by
the Holy Spirit; "to prophesy" signifies to understand and teach the
truths of doctrine; "to dream dreams" signifies to receive revelation;
and "to see visions" signifies to perceive revelation; "sons and
daughters" signify those who are in the spiritual affection of truth and
good; "old men" signify those who are in wisdom, and "young men," those
who are in intelligence. \[9\] In Amos: The Lord Jehovih doeth not a
word without revealing His secret unto His servants the prophets. The
lion roareth, who will not fear? The Lord Jehovih hath spoken, who will
not prophesy? (3:7, 8). Here also "to prophesy" signifies to receive
Divine truth and to teach it (but this may be seen explained above, n.
601). "To prophesy" and "prophets" have a similar signification in the
following passages in Revelation: I will give unto My two prophets to
prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth
(11:3). Again: The time of judging the dead, and of giving the reward to
His <span id="fr_273"></span>[624-1](#fn_273.md) servants the prophets
(11:18). Again: The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy
(19:10). Again: Be glad, O heaven, ye holy apostles and prophets, for
God hath judged your judgment (18:20). That here "prophets" mean those
who are in the truths of doctrine, and in an abstract sense the truths
of doctrine, and "to prophesy" means to receive and teach these,
especially to teach about the Lord Himself, will be seen hereafter.
\[10\] In Amos: Amos said to Amaziah, Jehovah took me from following the
flock and said, Go, prophesy against My people Israel: and thou sayest,
Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not against the house of Isaac.
Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, thy sons and thy daughters shall
fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line (7:14-17). "To
prophesy against Israel, and to drop against the house of Isaac,"
signifies to refute those of the church who are in the falsities of
evil, "to prophesy" signifying to teach and refute, and "Israel" and
"the house of Isaac" signifying the church. Because the falsities of
evil are what must be refuted, this is said to Amaziah, who represented
the perverted church; "his wife shall be a harlot" signifies the
falsification and adulteration of the Word; "his sons and daughters
shall fall by the sword" signifies that the truths and goods of the
church will be destroyed by the falsities of evil; and "the land shall
be divided by line" signifies that the church and everything belonging
to it will be scattered. \[11\] In Hosea: By a prophet Jehovah caused
Israel to come up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he guarded. Ephraim
hath provoked to anger with bitterness; therefore he shall leave his
bloods upon him (12:13, 14). By the "prophet" here in the nearest sense
Moses is meant, by whom Israel was led out of Egypt and afterwards
guarded; but in the spiritual sense "prophet" means the Lord in relation
to the Word, and "Israel" all those of the church who are in truths from
good, and "Egypt" the natural man, which separated from the spiritual
man is damned. Therefore "By a prophet Jehovah caused Israel to come up
out of Egypt" signifies that the Lord leads out of damnation those who
are in truths from good by means of the Divine truth, which is the Word,
and guards them by means of it. "Ephraim hath provoked to anger with
bitterness" signifies that they perverted the Word as to the
understanding of it, "Ephraim" signifying the understanding of the Word,
and "bitterness" perversions and falsities therefrom, from which is what
is undelightful; "therefore he shall leave his bloods upon him"
signifies damnation on account of the adulteration of the truth that is
in the Word. \[12\] In the same: The days of visitation are come, the
days of retribution are come; Israel, the foolish prophet, and the man
insane of spirit, shall know it; this because of the multitude of
iniquity and great hatred. Ephraim is a watchman with my God; but the
prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house
of his God (Hos. 9:7, 8). The "days of visitation and retribution"
signify the days of the Last Judgment, when the evil suffer punishment,
and this is retribution, which is always preceded by visitation;
"Israel," "prophet," and "the man of spirit," do not mean Israel,
prophet, and the man of spirit, but all those of the church who are in
the falsities of evil and in the evils of falsity, and who teach these
and confirm them by the sense of the letter of the Word. The falsities
of evil are signified by "the multitude of iniquity," and the evils of
falsity by "great hatred;" "Ephraim who is a watchman with God"
signifies the understanding of the Word, and this is why he is called "a
watchman with God;" but as those who are in the falsities of evil and in
the evils of falsity pervert the understanding of the Word, and thus
craftily lead astray, it is said "the prophet is the snare of a fowler,
and hatred in the house of God." \[13\] In Ezekiel: Prophesy against the
prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou to the prophets out of
their own heart, Hear ye the word of Jehovah; Thus saith the Lord
Jehovih, Woe unto the foolish prophets that go away after their own
spirit, and after that which they have not seen! And My hand shall be
against the prophets that behold vanity, and that divine falsehood
(13:2, 3, 9). By "prophets" here and elsewhere in the Word are meant in
the nearest sense such prophets as those were in the Old Testament
through whom the Lord spoke; but in the spiritual sense those prophets
are not meant, but all whom the Lord leads; with these also the Lord
flows in and reveals to them the secrets of the Word, whether they teach
or not; such, therefore, are signified by "prophets" in the spiritual
sense. But "the prophets that prophesy out of their own heart, and go
away after their own spirit, and who behold vanity and divine
falsehood," mean all who are not taught and led by the Lord but by
themselves, consequently they have insanity in place of intelligence,
and folly in place of wisdom, for they have the love of self in place of
the love to God, and the love of the world in place of the love to the
neighbor, and from these loves falsities continually pour forth. From
this it can be seen what these words signify in series. \[14\] In Micah:
It shall be night unto you for vision, and darkness shall arise to you
for divination; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day
shall grow black over them (3:6). "It shall be night unto you for
vision" signifies that there shall be the understanding of falsity
instead of the understanding of truth; "darkness for divination"
signifies falsities instead of revealed truths; "the sun shall go down
over the prophets, and the day grow black over them," signifies that
light shall no more flow in from the Lord out of heaven and enlighten,
but thick darkness from the hells which shall darken the understanding.
\[15\] In many passages "prophets" are mentioned, and no one has had any
other idea respecting them than that the prophets of the Old Testament,
through whom the Lord spoke unto the people, and through whom He
dictated the Word, are meant; but as the Word has a spiritual sense in
each and every particular of it, therefore in that sense "prophets" mean
all whom the Lord teaches, thus all who are in the spiritual affection
of truth, that is, who love truth, because it is truth, for the Lord
teaches these, and flows into their understanding and enlightens; and
this is more true of these than of the prophets of the Old Testament,
for they did not have their understanding enlightened, but the words
they were to say or write they received merely by hearing, and did not
even understand their interior sense, still less their spiritual sense.
From this it can be seen that "prophets" mean in the spiritual sense all
who are wise from the Lord; and this whether they teach or do not teach.
And as every truly spiritual meaning is abstracted from the idea of
persons, places, and times, so the "prophet" also signifies in the
highest sense the Lord in relation to the Word, and as to doctrine from
the Word, and likewise the Word and doctrine; and in the contrary sense
"prophets" signify the perversions and falsifications of the Word and
the falsities of doctrine. As this is what "prophets" signify in both
senses, I will cite a few passages only in which prophets are mentioned,
and in which they mean all who receive and teach the Word and doctrine,
and in a sense separate from persons the Word and doctrine, and in the
contrary sense those who pervert the Word and teach falsities of
doctrine, and in an abstract sense the perversion of the Word and
falsities of doctrine. \[16\] In Isaiah: Jehovah will cut off from
Israel head and tail; the old man and the honored of face he is the
head; but the prophet, the teacher of a lie, he is the tail (9:14, 15).
In the same: Jehovah hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep,
and hath closed your eyes; your prophets and your heads, the seers, hath
He covered (29:10). In Jeremiah: They have denied Jehovah when they
said, It is not He, neither shall evil come upon us, neither shall we
see sword and famine. But the prophets shall become wind, and the word
is not in them (5:12, 13). In the same: I have sent unto them all My
servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them (7:25).
Thus said Jehovah of Hosts against the prophets, Behold I will feed them
with wormwood, and make them drink waters of gall; for from the prophets
of Jerusalem is hypocrisy gone forth into all the land. Hearken not unto
the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you; they make you vain;
they speak the vision of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of
Jehovah (23:15, 16). In the same: The prophets that have been before me
and before thee of an age prophesied over many lands and over great
kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. The prophet who
prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass
that prophet shall be known that God sent him (28:8, 9). In Matthew: Woe
unto you, hypocrites and Pharisees, because ye build the sepulchers of
the prophets, and adorn the tombs of the righteous, and say, If we had
been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with
them in the blood of the prophets. Wherefore ye witness against
yourselves that ye are the sons of them that slew the prophets. I send
unto you prophets and wise men and scribes; and some of them shall ye
kill and crucify; that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed
upon the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous even to the blood
of Zachariah, son of Barachiah, whom ye slew between the temple and the
altar. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest
them that are sent unto thee (23:29-37; Luke 11:47-51). In these
passages it seems as if "prophets" mean merely the prophets through whom
Jehovah, that is, the Lord, spoke, consequently that by "slaying the
prophets" the Lord simply meant their slaughter. But the Lord meant at
the same time the slaughter and extinction of Divine truth that comes
from the falsification and adulteration of the Word; for by a person and
his function the thing itself which the person did and said is meant in
the spiritual sense; thus a "prophet" means Divine truth or the Word and
doctrine therefrom; therefore as the function of a person and the person
are in effect one, so the thing itself that the prophet teaches is meant
by "prophet." "To shed blood" also means to adulterate the truths of the
Word; and as the Jewish nation was such it is said, "O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent
unto thee," these words meaning in the spiritual sense that such
extinguish all Divine truth which they have from the Word. \[17\]
Because a "prophet" means Divine truth, which is the Word, and which is
in the church from the Word, and this cannot be extinguished except by
those who have the Divine truth of the Word, therefore the Lord said:
That it was not fitting for a prophet to perish out of Jerusalem (Luke
13:33). "Jerusalem" meaning the church in respect to the doctrine of
truth. In the Word "priest and prophet" are also often mentioned, and
"priest" means there one who leads men to live according to Divine
truth, and "prophet" one who teaches it. In this sense "priest and
prophet" are mentioned in the following passages. In Jeremiah: The law
shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the
Word from the prophet (18:18). In that day the heart of the king shall
perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be
astonished, and the prophets shall be amazed (4:9). In Ezekiel: They
shall seek a vision from the prophet; but the law hath perished from the
priest, and counsel from the elders. The king shall mourn, and the
prince shall be clothed with astonishment (7:26, 27). "Vision from the
prophet" means the understanding of the Word; "law from the priest" the
precepts of life; "counsel from the elders" wisdom therefrom. "King" and
"princes" mean intelligence through truths from good; such is the
spiritual meaning of these words. \[18\] In Isaiah: The priest and the
prophet err through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they
are gone astray through strong drink; they err among the seeing, they
stumble in judgment (28:7). In Jeremiah: An astonishing and horrible
thing has come to pass in the land; the prophets have prophesied a lie,
and the priests bear rule by their hands; and my people love to have it
so (5:30, 31). From the prophet even unto the priest everyone doeth a
lie (8:10). When a prophet or a priest shall ask thee, saying, What is
the prophetic saying of Jehovah? say unto them, I have abandoned you,
and the prophet, and the priest (23:33, 34). In Zephaniah: Her prophets
are very light, men of treacheries; their priests profane what is holy;
they violently wrest the law (3:4). In Jeremiah: The priests said not,
Where is Jehovah? and they that handle the law have not acknowledged Me,
and the prophets have prophesied by Baal, and have walked after those
that do not profit. The houses of Israel are ashamed; they, their kings,
their princes, and their priests, and their prophets (2:8, 26); not to
mention many other passages where "prophets and priests" are mentioned
together, and thereby "priests" are meant those who teach life, and lead
to good, and by "prophets" those who teach truths which lead; but in an
abstract sense "priests" and "the priesthood" mean the good of love,
consequently the good of life, and "prophets" the truth of doctrine,
consequently the truth that leads to the good of life; in a word,
"prophets" must teach, and "priests" lead. \[19\] In Zechariah: In that
day I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, that they may
no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the
unclean spirit to pass out of the land; and it shall come to pass that
when any man shall prophesy anymore, his father and his mother that
begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; and his father and
his mother that begat him shall thrust him through. It shall come to
pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed every man of his
vision when they have prophesied, neither shall they wear a tunic of
hair to dissemble; and he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a man that
tilleth the ground, for a man sold me from boyhood (13:2-5). This is
said of the Lord's coming into the world, and of the abolition of
representative worship and of the falsities with which the doctrine of
the church then abounded; for the Jewish nation, with which the church
was, placed all worship in externals, and nothing in internals, that is,
nothing in charity and faith, which are internal, but in sacrifices, and
in such things as are external, consequently their worship and doctrine
consisted of mere falsities, and the nation itself, viewed in itself,
was idolatrous. The abolition of such things by the Lord is described by
these words of the prophet; therefore "I will cut off the names of the
idols out of the land, that they may no more be remembered," signifies
the abolition of idolatrous worship, that is, of worship merely external
without any internal; "I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit
to pass out of the land" signifies the abolition of the falsities of
doctrine; "when they have prophesied anymore, his father and his mother
that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live," signifies that
the church to be instituted by the Lord, which shall be an internal
church, shall completely extinguish the falsities of doctrine, if anyone
shall teach them; "to prophesy" signifying to teach the falsities of
doctrine, "father and mother," the church in respect to good and in
respect to truth, "father," the church in respect to good, and "mother,"
the church in respect to truth, and "thou shalt not live" signifying to
extinguish. The same is meant by "his father and his mother that begat
him shall thrust him through." The abolition of the falsities of
doctrine is meant also by "the prophets shall be ashamed, every man of
his vision, neither shall they wear a tunic of hair to dissemble,"
"prophets" and "their vision" here also meaning the falsities of
doctrine, and "to wear a tunic of hair to dissemble" signifying to
pervert the external things of the Word such as are in the sense of its
letter, for "tunic of hair" with the prophets represented the ultimate
sense of the Word, the same as "the raiment of camel's hair" of John the
Baptist. His saying "I am a man that tilleth the ground, for a man sold
me from boyhood," signifies that this is the case with those of the
Jewish Church, which was merely external, not internal, because of their
being born in it, and consequently devoted to it. \[20\] In Daniel:
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy city of
holiness, to finish the transgression, and to seal up sins, and to
expiate iniquity, and to bring in the righteousness of the ages, and to
seal up the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the holy of holies
(9:24). This is said of the Lord's coming, when iniquity is consummated,
or when there shall be no longer any good or truth remaining in the
church. "Upon the people and upon the city of holiness" signifies upon
the church and its doctrine, which are then wholly vastated and
extinguished. "To finish the transgression and to seal up sins"
signifies when all in the church are in the falsities of doctrine and in
evils in respect to life, for, as has been shown at the beginning of
this article, the Lord's coming and the Last Judgment therewith do not
take place until there is no longer any truth of doctrine or good of
life remaining in the church, and this for the reason there mentioned,
that the well-disposed may be separated from the ill-disposed. "To bring
in the righteousness of the ages" signifies the Last Judgment, when
everyone will be rewarded according to his deeds; "to seal up the vision
and the prophet" signifies the end of the former church and the
beginning of the new, or the end of the external church, which was
representative of things spiritual, and the beginning of the internal,
which is a spiritual church, "vision and the prophet" meaning the
falsities of doctrine; and these same words signify also that the Lord
will fulfill all things that are predicted of Him in the Word; "to
anoint the holy of holies" signifies the glorification of the Lord's
Human by union with the Divine Itself; it signifies also that all
worship afterwards must be from love to Him. \[21\] In Moses: Jehovah
said unto Moses, I have set thee a god to Pharaoh; and Aaron thy brother
shall be thy prophet (Exod. 7:1). The Lord said to Moses, "I have set
thee a god to Pharaoh," because Moses represented the Law, by which is
meant the Divine truth, and this too is signified by "God" in the
spiritual sense; for Moses received from the Lord's mouth the words that
he was to say to Pharaoh, and he who receives these is called a "god;"
this is why angels are called "gods," and thence also signify Divine
truths. That Aaron was "his prophet" signifies that he taught the truth
received by Moses and declared it to Pharaoh, for a "prophet," as has
been said above, signifies one that teaches truth, and in an abstract
sense the doctrine of truth. (But this may be seen more fully explained
in Arcana Coelestia, n. 7268, 7269.) \[22\] This is why the prophets of
the Old Testament represented the Lord in relation to the doctrine of
Divine truth, and the chief of them represented the Lord in relation to
the Word itself, from which comes the doctrine of Divine truth, as
Moses, Elijah, Elisha, and John the Baptist; and as the Lord is the
Word, that is Divine truth, He Himself in the highest sense is called a
"Prophet." As Moses, Elijah, and John the Baptist represented the Lord
as to the Word: Moses and Elijah appeared speaking with the Lord when He
was transfigured (Matt. 17:3, 4; Mark 9:4, 5; Luke 9:30). There "Moses
and Elijah" mean the Word both historical and prophetical, "Moses" the
historical Word, and "Elijah" the prophetical, and for the reason that
when the Lord was transfigured He presented Himself in the form in which
the Divine truth is in heaven. That Elijah represented the Lord as to
the Word is evident from the miracles done by Him, all of which
signified such things as belong to Divine truth or the Word; and as John
the Baptist in like manner represented the Lord as to the Word he was
called "Elijah," as can be seen in Malachi: Behold, I will send you
Elijah the prophet before the great and terrible day of Jehovah cometh;
and He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of
the sons to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse
(4:5, 6). And it is openly declared: That John was Elijah (Matt. 11:14;
17:10-12; Mark 9:11-13); not that he was Elijah, but he represented
something similar to that which Elijah represented, that is, the Word;
and as the Word teaches that the Lord was to come into the world, and
because, moreover, in each and all particulars in the inmost sense the
Word treats of Him, therefore: John was sent before Him to teach them
that the Lord was to come (as may be seen Matt. 11:9, 10; Luke 1:76;
7:26). \[23\] From this it can now be seen why the Lord is called a
"Prophet," namely, because He was the Word, that is, Divine truth itself
(as is evident from John 1:1, 2, 14). That the Lord is called a
"Prophet" because He was the Word can be seen also in Moses: Jehovah thy
God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy
brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken. I will put My words
in his mouth, that he may speak unto you all that I shall command him.
The man who will not hearken unto My words which he shall speak in My
name, of him I will require it (Deut. 18:15-19). It is said that
"Jehovah was to raise up a prophet like Moses," because Moses
represented the Lord in relation to the Law, that is, the Word, as has
been said above; therefore it is also said of Moses: That Jehovah spake
with him mouth to mouth, and not as with other prophets, by visions,
dreams, and dark sayings (Num. 12:1-8). By this also the representation
of the Lord by Moses is described; for the Lord from Jehovah, that is,
from the very Divine that was in Him from conception, spoke with
Himself; this is meant by "I will put My words in his mouth, that he may
speak unto you all that I shall command him;" and this, too, was
represented with Moses by "Jehovah spake with him mouth to mouth, and
not as with other prophets." Again this is why: The Lord is called a
Prophet (Matt. 21:11; Luke 7:16; John 7:40, 41; 9:17).

<span class="margnote"><span id="625.">625.</span></span>

Upon peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many kings, signifies with
all who are in truths and goods in respect to life, and at the same time
in goods and truths in respect to doctrine according to each one's
religion, consequently to teach the Word in respect to the goods of life
and the truths of doctrine. This is evident from the signification of
"peoples and nations," as being those who are of the spiritual church
and those who are of the celestial church; those who are of the
spiritual church are called in the Word "peoples," but those who are of
the celestial church are called "nations." Those who are of the
spiritual church, who are called "peoples," are they who are in truths
in respect to doctrine and life; and they who are of the celestial
church, who are called "nations," are they who are in the good of love
to the Lord, and thus in good in respect to life. (But on this
signification of "peoples and nations" in the Word, see above, n. 175,
331.) Also from the signification of "tongues and many kings," as being
those who are in goods and truths in respect to life and doctrine, but
according to each one's religion; for "tongues" signify the goods of
truth and confession of these according to each one's religion (see
above, n. 330, 455); and "kings" signify truths that are from good, and
"many kings" various truths from good, but according to each one's
religion. (That "kings" signify truths from good, see above, n. 31,
553.) \[2\] "Many kings" signify various truths that are from good,
because the peoples and nations outside of the church were for the most
part in falsities as to doctrine, and yet because they lived a life of
love to God and of charity towards the neighbor the falsities of their
religion were accepted by the Lord as truths, for the reason that there
was inwardly in their falsities the good of love, and the good of love
gives its quality to every truth, and in this case it gives its quality
to the falsity that such accept as truth; and moreover, the good that
lies concealed within causes such when they come into the other life to
perceive genuine truths and accept them. Again there are truths that are
only appearances of truth, like those truths that are in the sense of
the letter of the Word; these appearances of truth are accepted by the
Lord as genuine truths when there is in them the good of love to the
Lord and the good of charity towards the neighbor; and with such in the
other life the good that lies hidden within dissipates the appearances,
and makes bare the spiritual truths which are genuine truths. From this
it can be seen what is here meant by "many kings." (But respecting the
falsities in which there is good that exist among the Gentiles, see in
The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 21.) \[3\] From what has been said
and shown in this and the preceding article, it can be seen that "he
must again prophesy upon peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many
kings" signifies that the Word must still be taught to those who are in
goods and truths in respect to doctrine, and thence are in life; but as
it is said "upon peoples, nations, tongues, and kings," these words
signify also that the Word must be taught in respect to the goods of
life and the truths of doctrine, for these two are what the Word in its
whole complex contains. \[4\] This is the sense of these words
abstracted from persons, which is the truly spiritual sense. The sense
of the letter in most places has regard to persons, and mentions
persons, but the truly spiritual sense is without any regard whatever to
persons. For angels who are in the spiritual sense of the Word have no
idea of person or of place in any particular of what they think or
speak, for the idea of person or of place limits and confines the
thoughts, and thereby renders them natural; it is otherwise when the
idea is abstracted from persons and places. It is from this that angels
have intelligence and wisdom, and that thence angelic intelligence and
wisdom are ineffable. While man lives in the world he is in natural
thought, and natural thought derives its ideas from persons, places,
times, and material things, and if these should be taken away from man,
his thought which comes to perception would perish, for without these he
comprehends nothing; but angelic thought is apart from ideas drawn from
persons, places, times, and material things; and this is why angelic
thought and speech are ineffable, and to man also incomprehensible.
\[5\] And yet a man who has lived in the world a life of love to the
Lord and of charity towards the neighbor comes, after his departure from
the world, into that ineffable intelligence and wisdom; for his interior
mind, which is the very mind of his spirit, is then opened, and then the
man, when he becomes an angel, thinks and speaks from that mind, and
consequently thinks and speaks such things as he could not utter or
comprehend in the world. Such a spiritual mind, which is like the
angelic mind, every man has; but because man while in the world speaks,
sees, hears, and feels, by means of a material body, that mind lies
hidden within the natural mind, or lives above it; and what man thinks
in that mind he is wholly ignorant of; for the thought of that mind then
flows into the natural mind, and there limits, bounds, and so presents
itself as to be seen and perceived. So long as man is in the body in the
world, he does not know that he has within him this mind, and in it
possesses angelic intelligence and wisdom, because, as has been said,
all things that abide there flow into the natural mind, and thus become
natural according to correspondences. This has been said to make known
what the Word is in the spiritual sense, which sense is wholly
abstracted from persons and places, that is, from such things as derive
their quality from the material things of the body and the world.

APOCALYPSE. CHAPTER 11. 1. And there was given to me a reed like a
staff; and the angel stood near, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of
God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. 2. And the court
which is without the temple cast out, and measure it not, for it is
given to the nations, and the holy city shall they trample down
forty-two months. 3. And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they
shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in
sackcloth. 4. These are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands
standing before the God of the earth. 5. And if anyone will hurt them,
fire shall go forth out of their mouth and shall devour their enemies;
and if anyone will hurt them, thus must he be killed. 6. These have
power to shut heaven, that the rain rain not in the days of their
prophecy; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood,
and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they will. 7. And
when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up
out of the abyss shall make war with them and overcome them and kill
them. 8. And their bodies shall be upon the street of the great city
which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was
crucified. 9. And they of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations
shall see their bodies three days and a half, and shall not suffer their
bodies to be placed in sepulchers. 10. And they that dwell upon the
earth shall rejoice over them and shall be glad, and shall send gifts
one to another, because those two prophets tormented them that dwell
upon the earth. 11. And after the three days and a half the spirit of
life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet, and
great fear fell upon them that beheld them. 12. And they heard a great
voice out of heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they went up
into heaven in the cloud; and their enemies beheld them. 13. And in that
hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell,
and there were killed in the earthquake names of men seven thousand; and
the rest became afraid, and gave glory to the God of heaven. 14. The
second woe is past; behold, the third woe cometh quickly. 15. And the
seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying,
The kingdoms of the world are become our Lord's and His Christ's, and He
shall reign unto the ages of the ages. 16. And the twenty-four elders
who sit before God upon their thrones fell upon their faces and
worshiped God, 17. Saying, We give Thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who
is, and who was, and who is to come, because Thou hast taken Thy great
power and entered upon the kingdom. 18. And the nations were angered,
and Thy anger is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to
give the reward to Thy servants, the prophets and the saints, and to
them that fear Thy name, the small and the great, and to destroy them
that destroy the earth. 19. And the temple of God was opened in heaven,
and there was seen in His temple the ark of His covenant; and there were
lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and great hail.
EXPOSITION Verses 1, 2. And there was given to me a reed like a staff;
and the angel stood near saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God,
and the altar, and them that worship therein. And the court which is
without the temple cast out, and measure it not, for it is given to the
nations; and the holy city shall they trample down forty-two months. 1.
"And there was given to me a reed like a staff," signifies the mode of
visitation, that is, of exploring the quality of the church in respect
to truth and to good (n. 627); "and the angel stood near saying,"
signifies the Lord's will and command (n. 628); "Rise, measure the
temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein," signifies
that he should explore the church, what is its quality in respect to the
reception of Divine truth and Divine good, and thence in respect to the
worship of the Lord (n. 629). 2. "And the court which is without the
temple cast out, and measure it not," signifies that the external of the
Word, and thence of the church and of worship, is not to be explored (n.
630); "for it is given to the nations," signifies since it has been
perverted by evils of life and falsities of doctrine (n. 631); "and the
holy city shall they trample down," signifies that they will destroy all
the doctrine of truth and good from the Word (n. 632); "forty-two
months," signifies even to the end of the old church and the beginning
of the new (n. 633).

<span class="margnote"><span id="627.">627.</span></span>

Verse 1. And there was given to me a reed like a staff, signifies the
mode of visitation, that is, of exploring the quality of the church in
respect to truth and to good. This is evident from the signification of
a "reed," as being that by which the quality is explored, for "to
measure" signifies to explore, and a "measure" signifies the quality of
a thing; therefore, the "reed," by which he measured the temple and the
altar, as now follows, that is, the "measuring reed," signifies the mode
of exploring the quality. It means the mode of exploring what the
quality of the church is in respect to truth and good, because it says
afterwards that "he measured the temple and the altar, and them that
worship therein," which signifies the church in respect to truth and
good, and thus in respect to worship. \[2\] Moreover, a "reed" signifies
visitation, because visitation is an exploration of the quality of the
men of the church, and because a visitation precedes the Last Judgment,
which will be treated of hereafter. What is the nature of that
visitation or exploration can be seen from the visitation upon Sodom,
that in the first place angels were sent there, and through them
visitation or exploration was made of what quality they were in respect
to their reception, that is, what was their quality in respect to the
reception of Divine truth and Divine good, for these angels represented
the Lord in respect to the Divine proceeding; and when it was found that
all in Sodom except Lot were unwilling to receive them but wished to do
them harm, then their destruction came, which means their last judgment.
\[3\] The measuring was effected by a reed, because a "reed or cane"
signifies Divine truth in the ultimate of order, and a "staff," which
the reed was like, signifies power; and by means of truth in the
ultimate of order and its power all visitation or exploration is
effected; for in the ultimate all truths, even from their firsts, form
what is simultaneous, that is, coexist; therefore all things effected by
the Divine, are effected from firsts by means of ultimates, therefore
here visitation or exploration is so effected, and such truth is
signified by a "reed or cane." \[4\] So in the following passages. In
Revelation: One of the seven angels had a golden reed, with which he
measured the city Jerusalem and its gates and its wall; and he measured
the city with a reed unto twelve thousand stadia (Rev. 21:15, 16). And
in Ezekiel: In the hand of the angel there was a line of flax and a
measuring reed, and the reed was of six cubits, and with it he measured
the length, the breadth and the height of the building, of the gate, of
the porch, of the court, of the temple, and many other things (Ezek.
40:3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17, et seq.; 41:1-5, 13, 14, 22; 42:1 to the
end). Here, too, the "measuring reed" means the mode of exploring the
church in respect to truth and good, as can be seen from this, that the
angel measured every particular of the temple as to length, breadth, and
height; and "length" signifies good, "breadth" truth, and "height" the
degrees of good and truth from the highest or inmost to the lowest or
ultimate. (On this signification of "length and breadth," see the work
on Heaven and Hell, n. 197.) That a "reed" signifies truth in ultimates
whereby explorations are effected, is evident also from this, that there
was also a "line of flax" in the hand of the angel, "a line of flax"
signifying truth; also from this, that "the reed was of six cubits,"
"six" having a similar signification as "three," namely, truths in the
whole complex (see above, n. 384, 532). That "to measure" signifies to
explore the quality of a thing will be seen in the following article.
\[5\] By ultimate truth, or truth in the ultimate of order, is meant
sensual truth, such as the truth in the sense of the letter of the Word
is to those who are merely sensual. Divine truth in its descent proceeds
according to degrees, from the highest or inmost to the lowest or
ultimate. Divine truth in the highest degree is such as is the Divine
that proceeds most nearly from the Lord, thus such as is the Divine
truth above the heavens; and as this is infinite, it cannot come to the
perception of any angel. But Divine truth of the first degree is that
which comes to the perception of the angels of the inmost or third
heaven, and is called celestial Divine truth; from this is the wisdom of
those angels. Divine truth of the second degree is that which comes to
the perception of the angels of the middle or second heaven, and
constitutes their wisdom and intelligence, and is called spiritual
Divine truth. Divine truth of the third degree is that which comes to
the perception of angels of the lowest or first heaven, and constitutes
their intelligence and knowledge \[scientia\], and is called
celestial-natural and spiritual-natural Divine truth. But Divine truth
of the fourth degree is that which comes to the perception of the men of
the church who are living in the world, and constitutes their
intelligence and knowledge \[scientia\]; this is called natural Divine
truth, and its lowest is called sensual Divine truth. \[6\] These Divine
truths are in the Word in the order of their degrees, and Divine truth
in the lowest degree, or in the ultimate of order, is such as is the
Divine truth in the sense of the letter of the Word, for children and
for the very simple, who are sensual. This Divine truth is what is
signified by a "reed or cane." And as explorations with all are effected
by this lowest Divine truth, as was said above, so measurings and
weighings in the representative churches were made by means of reeds or
canes, which signify such Divine truth. It has just been shown that
measurings were made by reeds; that weighings were also thus made can be
seen in Isaiah: They weighed silver with a reed (Isa. 46:6). \[7\]
Because a "reed" signifies truth in ultimates, such as is for the simple
and children, who are not spiritual but natural-sensual, it is also said
in Isaiah: A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will
not quench, and He will bring forth truth into judgment (Isa. 42:3).
This treats of the Lord; and "a bruised reed He will not break"
signifies that He will not hurt sensual Divine truth with the simple and
with children; "smoking flax He will not quench" signifies that He will
not destroy the Divine truth that is beginning to live from a very
little good of love with the simple and with children, "flax" signifying
truth, and "smoking" signifies its being alive from some little love;
and because both, that is, the "reed and flax" signify truth, it is said
that the Lord "will bring forth truth into judgment," which means that
He will bring forth with them intelligence, "judgment" signifying
intelligence. \[8\] A "reed" signifies also sensual truth which is the
lowest, such as exists with natural men, even with the evil. In the
same: The dry place shall become a pool, and there shall be grass
instead of the reed and rush (Isa. 35:7). This refers to the
establishment of the church by the Lord; and that those will then have
intelligence through spiritual Divine truth who before had none is
signified by "the dry place shall become a pool;" and that those will
then have knowledge through natural Divine truth who before had only
sensual truth, is signified by "there shall be grass instead of the reed
and rush," "grass" signifying knowledge from a spiritual origin, or by
which spiritual truth is confirmed, while "reed and rush" signify
knowledge from a sensual origin, or by which the fallacies of the senses
are confirmed. This knowledge, regarded in itself, is only the lowest
natural knowledge, which may be called material and corporeal, in which
there is little or nothing of life. \[9\] In the same: The streams shall
recede, the rivers of Egypt shall be minished and dried up, the reed and
flag shall wither (Isa. 19:6). In the spiritual sense these words mean
that all the understanding of Divine truth will perish; "the streams
shall recede" signifies that all things of spiritual intelligence will
depart; "the rivers of Egypt shall be minished and dried up" signifies
that all things of natural intelligence will perish; "the reed and the
flag shall wither" signifies that lowest truth, which is called sensual
truth, and which is mere knowledge, will vanish; "streams and rivers"
signifying the things of intelligence; "Egypt" the natural; "reed and
flag" sensual truth or knowledge, and "to recede," "to be minished," "to
be dried up," and "to wither," signifying to perish and disappear.
\[10\] In the same: Thou hast trusted on the staff of this bruised reed,
on Egypt, upon which when a man leaneth it goeth into his hand and
pierceth it; so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him (Isa.
36:6). "Egypt" signifies the natural man separated from the spiritual,
and its knowledge; when this is separated from the intelligence of the
spiritual man it is fatuous, and is applied to confirm evils of every
kind, consequently it is a false knowledge. This is what is called "a
staff of a bruised reed," "reed," as was said, being truth in the
ultimate of order, which is sensual knowledge; "bruised" signifies what
is broken and not cohering with any interior truth to give it
consistency; "staff" means the resulting power to perceive and also to
reason about truths. This, therefore, is the meaning of "upon which when
a man leaneth it goeth into his hand and pierceth it;" "to lean upon
that staff" means to trust in one's own power to perceive truths and
reason about them from what is one's own \[proprium\]; "to enter into
the hand and pierce it" signifies to destroy all intellectual power, and
to see mere falsities instead of truths and to seize upon them; "so is
Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust on him" signifies that such is
the natural man when separated from the spiritual, in respect to its
knowledges and intelligence therefrom, and reasoning from that
intelligence. \[11\] In Job: Let my shoulder blade fall from the
shoulder, and mine arm be broken therefrom by a reed; for the dread of
the destruction of God is upon me, and by reason of His majesty I can do
nothing. Have I made gold my hope, and said to pure gold, Thou art my
confidence? (Job 31:22-24) This, too, treats of the confidence of
self-intelligence, and in the spiritual sense these words describe that
from this nothing of truth is seen, but only what is false, which does
not cohere with any truth; non-coherence is signified by "let my
shoulder blade fall from the shoulder, and mine arm be broken therefrom
by a reed," "shoulder blade," "shoulder," and "arm" signifying power,
here the power to understand and perceive truth; "to fall from the
shoulder," and "to be broken by a reed" signifies to be separated from
the spiritual power to perceive truth, and in consequence to be deceived
by the sensual-corporeal man, and to perish by falsity, "reed" meaning
truth in the ultimate of order, which is called sensual knowledge, which
becomes mere falsity when it is of the natural man alone separated from
the spiritual; "the dread of the destruction of God" signifies the loss
of all understanding of truth; "by reason of His majesty to be able to
do nothing" signifies that nothing of the understanding and perception
of truth is from what is man's own \[proprium\], but all from God; "to
make gold a hope, and to say to pure gold, Thou art my confidence,"
signifies that he confided not in himself, by believing anything of good
to be from himself. \[12\] In Ezekiel: That all the inhabitants of Egypt
may know that I am Jehovah, because they have been a staff of a reed to
the house of Israel; when they laid hold of thee with the hand thou wast
bruised, and thou didst pierce through every shoulder for them; and when
they leaned upon thee thou wast broken, and didst make all their loins
to stand (Ezek. 29:6, 7). Here similar things are said of Egypt as
above, and here, too, "Egypt" signifies the natural man separated from
the spiritual, and its knowledge, which when applied to evils is merely
false. This is said of those in the church who trust in
self-intelligence; "the sons of Israel" signify those who are of the
church; their trust is signified by "a staff of a reed;" that all their
ability to perceive truth thus perished is signified by "when they laid
hold of thee with the hand thou wast bruised, and didst pierce through
every shoulder for them," "shoulder" signifying the power or ability to
understand truth; the loss of this is signified by "when they leaned
upon thee thou wast broken." That thus every good of love and charity
was destroyed and dissipated is signified by "thou didst make all their
loins to stand," "loins" signifying the marriage of truth and good, so
here that truth was not conjoined to good; truth conjoined to good
constitutes the good of love and charity, since all the good of love and
charity is formed by truths. \[13\] In David: Rebuke the wild beast of
the reed or cane, the congregation of the mighty, among the calves of
the peoples; trampling upon the plates of silver, he hath scattered the
peoples, he desireth wars; those that are fat shall come out of Egypt,
Ethiopia shall hasten her gift <span id="fr_274"></span>[627-1](#fn_274.md)
unto God (Ps. 68:30, 31). This treats of the Lord's kingdom. To beware
of false knowledge \[scientificum\], that is, of falsely applied
knowledge from the natural man separated from the spiritual, is meant by
"Rebuke the wild beast of the reed, cane or rod;" inasmuch as such
knowledges, because they are from the fallacies of the senses, strongly
persuade, they are called "the congregation of the mighty;" "the calves
of the people" mean the goods of the church in the natural man; "plates
of silver" are the truths of the church; "to tread upon" and "to
scatter" mean to disperse and dissipate, which is done by those who are
natural and sensual, and who think naturally and sensually, and not at
the same time spiritually, thus who think from the natural and sensual
man separated from the spiritual; this man is meant by "the wild beast
of the reed" or "cane;" "to desire wars" signifies reasonings against
truths; "those that are fat out of Egypt and Ethiopia" are those who
have a knowledge \[scientia\] of spiritual things, and who are in the
cognitions of truth and good, who will draw near to the Lord's kingdom
because they are in light from the spiritual man. \[14\] In the first
book of Kings: Jehovah shall smite Israel as a reed noddeth in the
waters, and he shall pluck away Israel from off the good land (1 Kings
14:15). The vastation of the church among the sons of Israel is compared
to "the nodding of a reed or cane in the waters," because a "reed" or
cane signifies the truth of the sensual man, which is the lowest, and
when this truth is separated from the light of the spiritual man it
becomes falsity. For the sensual man derives all that it has from things
appearing in the world; consequently reasonings from these respecting
spiritual things are mere fallacies, and from fallacies come falsities.
(What the fallacies of the senses are in spiritual things, and that
falsities are from them, see in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n.
53; also above in the explanation of Revelation, n. 575; and that
sensual knowledges \[scientifica\] are mere fallacies when the sensual
man reasons from them, above, n. 569, 581; also what the sensual is, and
the quality of the sensual man, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem,
n. 50.) \[15\] In the Gospels: They placed a reed in the Lord's right
hand, and afterwards they took the reed and smote His head with it
(Matt. 27:29, 30; Mark 15:19); also: They put a sponge upon a reed and
gave Him vinegar to drink (Matt. 27:48; Mark 15:36). Those who do not
know the spiritual sense of the Word may believe that these and the many
other things related of the Lord's passion involve nothing more than
common modes of mockery; as that "they set a crown of thorns upon His
head;" that "they parted His garments among them, but not the tunic;"
that "they bent the knee before Him" for the sake of mocking Him; and
also here, that "they placed a reed in His right hand, and afterwards
smote His head with it;" and again, that "they filled a sponge with
vinegar, or myrrhed wine, and set it upon a reed, and gave Him to
drink." But let it be known that all things that are related of the
Lord's passion signify the mocking at Divine truth, and thus the
falsification and adulteration of the Word; since the Lord, when He was
in the world, was the Divine truth itself, which in the church is the
Word; and because the Lord was then the Divine truth, He permitted the
Jews to treat Him altogether as they were treating the Divine truth or
the Word by falsifying and adulterating it. For they applied all things
of the Word to their own loves, and derided every truth that disagreed
with their loves, as they did the Messiah Himself, because He did not,
according to their explanation and religion, become king over the whole
world, and exalt them into glory above all peoples and nations. (That
all things related of the Lord's passion signify such things, see above,
n. 64, 83, 195 at the end.) But that "they placed a reed in the Lord's
hand and afterwards smote His head with it" signifies that they
falsified Divine truth or the Word, and made an utter mockery of the
understanding of truth and of Divine wisdom, a "reed" signifying falsity
in what is most external (as above), and "to smite the head" signifying
to reject and mock at the understanding of truth and Divine wisdom,
which is what "the head of the Lord" signifies; and in "giving the Lord
vinegar to drink," which signifies what is falsified, they placed a
sponge filled with it on a "reed," which signifies falsity in what is
most external, which is falsity sustaining.

And the angel stood near, saying, signifies the Lord's will and command.
This is evident from the signification of "to stand near," as being here
will (of which presently); also from the signification of "angel," as
being the Lord in respect to the Word (see above, n. 593); also from the
signification of "saying," as being, when the Lord speaks, command; for
what the Lord says is to be done, or that anyone should do it, is a
command. "The angel stood near" means here the Lord's will, because in
the spiritual world the thought, with the purpose, and will to see
another, to speak with him, and to give him a command, causes the other
to be present, that is, to stand near; for in that world there are no
distances that are constant and thence measurable, as in the natural
world; but likeness of affection and of thought thence causes presence,
and unlikeness of these causes absence; this is the origin of all
distances in that world. This comes from the universal principle that
the Lord is present with all according to their love to Him and
according to their love towards the neighbor and thoughts from these.
From this universal principle all distances, that is, all presence and
absence among angels and spirits, exist; therefore when anyone desires
to speak with another, that is, thinks about him from a purpose or wish
to speak with him, that one immediately becomes present, or he is
present with that one. (That this is so can be seen in the work on
Heaven and Hell, n. 191-199, where Space in Heaven is treated of.) From
this it can now be seen why the Lord's will is signified by "the angel
stood near," for "to stand near" means to be present.

<span class="margnote"><span id="629.">629.</span></span>

Rise, measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship
therein, signifies that he should explore the church, what is its
quality in respect to the reception of Divine truth and Divine good, and
thence in respect to the worship of the Lord. This is evident from the
signification of "to measure," as being to explore what the quality of a
thing is (of which presently); from the signification of "temple," as
being in the highest sense the Lord's Divine Human in relation to Divine
truth, and in a relative sense heaven and the church in respect to
Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (of which above, n. 220); from the
signification of "altar," as being in the highest sense the Lord's
Divine Human in relation to divine good, and in a relative sense heaven
and the church in respect to Divine good proceeding from the Lord (of
which also above, n. 391, 490, 496); and from the signification of "them
that worship," as being worship. "They that worship" signifies the
worship of the Lord, because worship consists in the adoration of the
Lord, and because in the spiritual sense nothing of person is meant, but
only the thing abstracted from persons (of which see above, n. 99, 100,
270, 325, 625); this is why "they that worship" signifies adoration and
worship. From this it can be seen that "Rise, measure the temple of God,
and the altar, and them that worship therein," signifies to explore the
church, what is its quality in respect to the reception of Divine truth
and Divine good proceeding from the Lord, and thence in respect to
worship. \[2\] Evidently "to measure" in the spiritual sense does not
mean to measure, for it was commanded to measure not only the temple and
the altar, but also them that worship therein; therefore "to measure the
temple and the altar" must involve that which is signified by their
measures, thus that which is signified by the "length," the "breadth,"
and the "height," for the expression "to measure them that worship in
the temple," cannot be used unless "to measure" signifies to explore the
quality of the persons or of the thing. \[3\] That "to measure"
signifies to explore the quality of a thing, and to designate it, can be
seen from the passages in the Word where "to measure" and "measures" are
mentioned, as in the following in Ezekiel: The man that had the line of
flax and the measuring reed in his hand measured the building, likewise
the threshold of the gate, the porch of the gate in the house, the porch
of the gate from the house, the door of the gate, the gate from the roof
of the bedchamber, and many other things which he measured as to
breadth, length, and height (Ezek. 40:3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 17, et seq.);
and afterwards: He measured the temple, the lintel over the door, the
wall of the house, and the house itself, as to breadth and length (Ezek.
41:1-5, 13, 14, 22); again: He measured the inner court, and the things
of that court (Ezek. 42); finally: He measured the altar and the things
of the altar (Ezek 43:13, et seq.). Moreover, the measures were
designated in numbers, that is, how many reeds, how many cubits, and how
many palms; which shows that "to measure" these does not mean to measure
but to designate the quality of the thing, and this is designated by the
several things measured, namely, the "building," the "gate," the
"porch," the "temple," the "upper lintel," the "wall," the "court," and
the "altar." "The building, the house, and the temple," signify the
church; "the door and the gate" signify truth that introduces; and "the
porch and court" signify all things that are without the church and yet
look to it, and these are all things with the man of the church that are
in his natural man; for the church itself with man is in the internal or
spiritual man or mind, thus inwardly with him; while all things that are
in the external or natural man or mind, thus that reside without,
correspond to the things that are of the church itself, which, as was
said, are in the internal or spiritual man or mind. These external
things are what are signified by the "porch" without the house, and by
"the court." What the qualities of these things were to be is here
designated by measures and numbers; for these chapters treat of the
Lord's church that was to come, and that is called the internal church,
and this is thus described. Anyone can see that such measurements would
be of no account unless each measurement signified something; but what
each signifies can be seen from the signification of the thing measured,
and its quality from the signification of the measure as expressed in
number. \[4\] There are only three things that are measured, namely,
breadth, length, and height; and "breadth" signifies the truth of the
church, "length" the good of the church, and "height" both of these as
to degrees; the degrees of truth and good are the quality of truth and
good as interior or higher and as exterior or lower. Such is the
signification of these three dimensions, because breadth is predicated
of heaven from south to north, and length from east to west, and height
from the third heaven which is in things highest to the first heaven
which is in things lowest. And as those in heaven who dwell from south
to north are in the truths of doctrine, so "breadth" signifies the truth
of heaven or of the church; and as those who dwell in heaven from east
to west are in the good of love, so "length" signifies the good of
heaven or of the church; and as those who dwell in the third heaven, who
are the most wise, are in things highest, while those who dwell in the
first heaven, who are relatively simple, are in things lowest, so
"height" signifies wisdom and intelligence as to their degrees. These
things therefore are what are designated by measurements in general.
\[5\] In the same: Son of man, show the house to the house of Israel,
that they may be ashamed of their iniquities, and may measure the form
when they have been ashamed of all things that they have done; the form
of the house and the arrangement thereof, and the goings out thereof and
the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, also teach them all
the statutes thereof, and all the arrangements thereof, and all the laws
thereof, and write them before their eyes, that they may keep all the
form thereof and all the statutes thereof, and do them (Ezek. 43:10,
11). That "to measure the temple" or "house" signifies to investigate
and explore what is the quality of the church in respect to truth and
good, can be seen from its being said "that they may measure the form of
the house, the goings out and the comings in thereof;" also "that they
may keep all the form thereof;" which cannot mean the form of the temple
merely in respect to form, but in respect to those things that are
signified by the temple; for it is added "that they may be ashamed of
their iniquities that they have done," which signifies shame for
departing from the laws and statutes of the church; therefore it is
added, "that he may teach them all the statutes thereof, all the
descriptions, <span id="fr_275"></span>[629-1](#fn_275.md) and all the laws
thereof;" which shows that the "temple" signifies the church with its
truths and goods, for these are the things that are to be kept, and this
is signified by "keeping all the form of the house" or "temple." The
"temple" signifies in the Word the church in respect to truth, and "the
house of God" the church in respect to good; for the temple was of
stone, but the house of God in ancient times was of wood; and "stones"
signify truths, and "wood" signifies good. \[6\] In Zechariah: I lifted
up mine eyes and saw, and behold a man in whose hand was a measuring
line; and I said, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure
Jerusalem, to see how great is the breadth thereof, and how great is the
length thereof; and he said Jerusalem shall inhabit the suburbs by
reason of the multitude of men and beasts in the midst of it (Zech. 2:1,
2, 4). This is said of the Lord's coming and of the establishment of a
New Church by Him, as can be seen from verses 10 and 11 of the same
chapter. "Jerusalem" signifies that New Church, and "to measure" it
signifies to explore and thus to know what and how great it will be;
"breadth" signifies the truth of its doctrine, and "length" the good of
its love (as just above); therefore it is said "To measure Jerusalem, to
see how great is the breadth thereof, and how great is the length
thereof." Evidently "Jerusalem" here means the church, and not the city
Jerusalem, for about the time of the Lord's coming Jerusalem was not so
great and such as is here described, that is, that "Jerusalem should
inhabit the suburbs by reason of the multitude of men and beasts in the
midst of it;" but this means the multitude of the nations that will be
added to the church, "Jerusalem, in the midst of it," signifying the
church consisting of those who will receive interiorly the Divine
proceeding from the Lord, and "suburbs" the church consisting of those
who will receive it exteriorly. For the church of the Lord is internal
and external; in the internal church are those who are in intelligence
and wisdom, and thus in the higher heavens, but in the external church
are those who are in knowledges and cognitions of truth and good from
the Word, and in no interior intelligence and wisdom, and who are
therefore in the lower heavens; the former are called spiritual, the
latter spiritual-natural, and the spiritual are meant by those who are
"in the midst of Jerusalem," and the spiritual-natural by those who are
"in the suburbs." "Men and beasts" mean those who are in intelligence
and thence in the good of life, "men" those who are in intelligence, and
"beasts" those who are in the natural affection of good, and thus in the
good of life. \[7\] Like things are signified by these words in
Revelation: The angel who talked with me had a golden reed, to measure
the city the New Jerusalem, the gates thereof and the wall thereof; and
he measured the wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the
measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev. 21:15, 17). Here, too, "the
New Jerusalem" means a New Church, and the "city" its doctrine, "its
wall" signifies Divine truth defending, the number "one hundred and
forty-four" signifies all truths and goods in the complex; this number
is said to be "the measure of a man, that is, of an angel," which could
not be said unless "measure" signified quality. But this will be
explained in its proper place hereafter. \[8\] In Ezekiel: When the man
went out toward the east, in whose hand was the line, he measured a
thousand by the cubit, then he made me to pass through the waters, the
waters were to the ankles; again he measured a thousand and made me to
pass through the waters, waters to the knees; and he measured a thousand
and made me to pass through the waters, waters to the loins; again he
measured a thousand, it was a river that I could not pass through
because the waters were high, waters of swimming, a river that was not
passed through. And behold, on the bank of the river were many trees on
this side and on that side; and every living soul that creepeth, and
whithersoever the river cometh, shall live; whence there is much fish
(Ezek. 47:3-5, 7, 9). This describes how intelligence, which those have
who are of the church, increases by the reception of Divine truth
proceeding from the Lord. Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is
signified by "the waters issuing from under the threshold of the house
towards the east, and going down from the right side of the house from
the south of the altar," as is said in verse 1 of this chapter; the
"east" signifies love to the Lord, since the east in heaven is where the
Lord appears as a sun; and thence the "right side" is where Divine truth
is received in the greatest light, and that side is called the south;
therefore it is added "from the south of the altar." How intelligence
increases by the reception of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is
described by the "waters" which the prophet passed through, which first
reached "to the ankles," afterwards "to the knees," then "to the loins,"
and at length were so high that they "could not be passed through;" "the
waters to the ankles" signify such intelligence as the sensual and
natural man has, for "ankles" signify what is sensual and natural; "the
waters to the knees" signify such intelligence as the spiritual-natural
man has, for "knees" signify what is spiritual-natural; "the waters to
the loins" signify such intelligence as the spiritual man has, for the
"loins" signify the marriage of truth and good, which is spiritual; "the
waters that could not be passed through" signify celestial intelligence,
which is called wisdom, such as the celestial man or an angel of the
third heaven has; and because this is ineffable, it is said to be "a
river that could not be passed through," and because it is far above the
natural man, these waters are called "waters of swimming." The "river"
which is from these waters signifies intelligence and wisdom; the
cognitions of truth and good and also perceptions are signified by "many
trees on the bank of the river on this side and on that side," "trees"
signifying cognitions and perceptions; life therefrom to all things in
the natural man, both cognitions and knowledges, is signified by "every
living soul that creepeth shall live," and by "there shall be much
fish," "the soul that creepeth" and "the fish" signifying the things
that are in the natural man, which are called cognitions from the Word,
also natural knowledges \[scientiae\] whereby spiritual things are
confirmed, and "to live" signifying the influx of the Lord into these
cognitions and knowledges through the spiritual man and his
intelligence. (That "waters" signify the truths of doctrine from the
Word, through which comes intelligence, see above, n. 71, 483, 518.)
\[9\] In Habakkuk: He stood and measured the earth; He saw and drove
asunder the nations; for the mountains of eternity were scattered, the
hills of the age did bow, His goings are of an age (Hab. 3:6). This is
said of visitation and the Last Judgment by the Lord when He should come
into the world. "He stood and measured the earth" means exploring at
that time of what quality the church is, "to measure" signifying to
explore, and "the earth" the church; "He saw and drove asunder the
nations" signifies the casting down into hell of all who are in evils
and in falsities therefrom, "to drive asunder" signifying to cast into
hell, and "nations" those who are in evils and in falsities therefrom;
"the mountains of eternity were scattered" signifies that the celestial
church, such as was with the most ancient people, who were in love to
the Lord, had perished, "the mountains of eternity" signifying that
church and that love; "the hills of the age did bow" signifies that the
spiritual church perished, such as was with the ancient people after the
flood, who were in love towards the neighbor, "the hills of the age"
signifying that church and that love; "His goings are of an age"
signifies according to the state of the church at that time, which was a
perverted state. \[10\] In Isaiah: Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in
strength, and His arm shall rule for Him. Who hath measured the waters
in the hollow of His hand, and meted out the heavens with a span, and
embraced the dust of the earth in a measure \[trientali\], and weighed
the mountains in a scale, and the hills in a balance? (Isa. 40:10, 12)
This, too, is said of the Lord and of Divine truth, from which are
heaven and the church, and from which is wisdom. The Lord's coming, and
the arrangement of all things in the heavens by Him from His own power
at that time, is signified by "Behold the Lord Jehovih cometh in
strength, and His arm shall rule for Him," "His arm that shall rule"
signifying His own power. The arrangement of all things in the heavens
by His own power by means of Divine truth, is signified by "Who hath
measured the waters in the hollow of His hand, and meted out the heavens
with a span, and embraced the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed
the mountains in a scale, and the hills in a balance?" "To measure
waters" signifies to define Divine truths; "to mete out the heavens with
a span" signifies thence to arrange the heavens; "to embrace the dust of
the earth in a measure" signifies to arrange lower things; "the hollow
of the hand," "the span," and "the measure" have a similar signification
as "measures" and also the "hand," namely, the quality of a thing and
one's own power; "to weigh the mountains in a scale and the hills in a
balance" signifies to subordinate and equilibrate all things, "scale and
balance" signifying right equilibration, and "mountains and hills" the
higher heavens, "mountains" meaning those heavens which are in love to
the Lord, and "hills" those which are in charity towards the neighbor
(as above). \[11\] In Job: Where wast thou when I founded the earth?
Declare, if thou knowest understanding. Who determined the measures
thereof? if thou knowest; and who stretched out the line upon it? upon
what are its bases sunk? who laid the cornerstone thereof? (Job 38:4-6)
The "earth" here means the church; "to found it" and "to determine its
measures" signify to establish it and to define its quality, "measure"
meaning the quality of a thing; "to stretch out the line upon it"
signifies to maintain it in its quality; "upon what are its bases sunk?
and who laid the cornerstone thereof?" signifies to found it upon those
things that are in the natural man, the "cornerstone" meaning the truth
of the natural man, which is called true knowledge, upon which the truth
of the spiritual man or spiritual truth is founded. \[12\] In Jeremiah:
If these statutes shall depart from before Me, the seed of Israel also
shall cease from being a nation before Me all the days. If the heavens
shall be measured upwards, and the foundations be searched out
downwards, I also will reject all the seed of Israel because of all that
they have done (Jer. 31:36, 37). "Statutes" signify here all the things
of the church that were commanded to the sons of Israel, thus all things
of worship; if they do not keep these there will be no church among
them, is what is signified by "If these statutes shall depart from
before Me the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before
Me all the days," "Israel" signifying the church, and "the seed of
Israel" the truth of the church; and that although a new heaven and a
New Church will come into existence, yet there will be nothing of heaven
and the church with that nation, is signified by "If the heavens shall
be measured upwards, and the foundations shall be searched out
downwards, I also will reject all the seed of Israel because of all that
they have done." \[13\] "To mete" and "to measure" signifies to define
and determine what a thing is, also to explore it, because "measure"
signifies what a thing is, or quality. That this is the signification of
"measure" can be seen from the following passages. In Revelation: The
angel measured the wall of the city New Jerusalem, a hundred and
forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel
(Rev. 21:17). It is clearly evident that here "measure" signifies the
quality of the thing that is meant by "the wall of the city New
Jerusalem;" for what else could be meant by "the measure of the wall, a
hundred and forty-four cubits, being the measure of a man, that is, of
an angel"? In Matthew: Judge not that ye be not condemned <span
id="fr_276"></span>[629-2](#fn_276.md) for with what judgment ye judge ye
shall be judged, and with what measure ye measure it shall be measured
to you (Matt. 7:1, 2). In Luke: Judge not that ye be not judged; condemn
not that ye be not condemned; remit and it shall be remitted to you;
give and it shall be given to you, good measure, pressed down, shaken
together, and running over, shall they give into your bosom; for with
what measure ye measure they shall measure to you again (Luke 6:37, 38).
This may be seen explained in the work Heaven and Hell (n. 349). And in
Mark: With what measure ye measure it shall be measured to you again;
and to you that hear, more shall be added. Whosoever hath, to him shall
be given; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that
which he hath (Mark 4:24, 25). \[14\] Thus charity towards the neighbor,
or the spiritual affection of truth and good, is described, namely, that
in the measure and after the manner that anyone is in such charity or in
such affection in the world, so he comes into it after death. That we
should not think evil of good and truth is meant by the words, "Judge
not that ye be not judged, and condemn not that ye be not condemned;" to
think evil of what is evil and false is permitted to everyone, but not
of good and truth, for these in the spiritual sense are the neighbor.
Because it is charity toward the neighbor that is meant it is added,
"Remit and it shall be remitted to you, give and it shall be given unto
you." That the spiritual affection, which is called charity, will
continue after death according to its measure and quality, is meant by
"With what measure ye measure it shall be measured to you again;" and
that this measure and quality will be infilled to eternity is meant by
"to you that hear a measure shall be added," also by "good measure,
pressed down, shaken together, and running over, shall be given into
your bosom," "measure" here meaning the measure and quality of affection
or charity, which will be increased to eternity within or according to
its degree in the world (see as above in the work Heaven and Hell, n.
349). That this will come to pass with those who practice charity is
meant by "to you that hear more shall be added," "those that hear"
signifying those who obey and do. That "to love the neighbor" is to love
what is true and good, likewise what is sincere and just, may be seen in
the New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine (n. 84-106). That no other
thought or judgment is here meant than concerning the spiritual life of
another can be seen from this, that it is permissible to everyone to
think about the moral and civil life of another, and to judge of it;
without such thought and judgment concerning others no civil society
could subsist; therefore "not to judge and condemn" signifies not to
think evil of the neighbor spiritually understood, that is, of his faith
and love, which belong to man's spiritual life, for these lie concealed
in his interiors, and therefore are unknown to anyone except the Lord
alone. \[15\] In John: He whom the Father hath sent speaketh the words
of God, for not by measure hath God given the spirit unto Him (John
3:24). The "spirit" that God giveth signifies Divine truth, and
intelligence and wisdom therefrom; "not by measure" signifies above
every measure and quality of men, therefore infinitely, for the infinity
that belongs to the Lord is without measure or quality, for measure and
quality are properties of the finite, since measure and quality
determine what is finite and set limits to it, but what is without limit
is infinite. From this it follows that "measure" also here signifies
quality, since "not by measure" signifies not predicating what a thing
is, or its quality. \[16\] In David: Make known to me, Jehovah, my end,
and the measure of my days what it is, that I may know how transitory I
am; behold Thou hast given my days as handbreadths, and my time is as
nothing before Thee (Ps. 39:4, 5). It appears as if by these words times
of life only are meant, the limit of which he wishes to know, and that
these times pass away quickly; but in the spiritual sense times are not
meant, but states of life instead; so "Make known to me, Jehovah, my
end, the measure of my days what it is," signifies that he might know
the state of his life and its quality, thus what kind of life he would
continue in. "Behold Thou hast given my days as handbreadths" signifies
that it is of very little consequence what the state of one's life is;
"and my time is as nothing before Thee" signifies that the state of
one's life is of no value; for "time and day" signify states of life in
respect to truth and good, and thence in respect to intelligence and
wisdom; so it is here meant that all these, so far as they are from
oneself, are of no value. That there is such a meaning in these words
cannot be seen by those who think only naturally, because natural
thought cannot be separated from the idea of time. But spiritual
thought, like that of angels, has nothing in common with time or space
or with person. \[17\] As "measures" signify the quality of a thing, it
is clear what is signified: By the house of measures (Jer. 22:14); By
the portion of measures (Jer. 13:25); Also by men of measures (Isa.
45:14); where "measures" signify quality in the whole complex. In Moses:
Ye shall not act perversely in judgment, in measure, in weight, or in
dimension; balances of justice, stones of justice, an ephah of justice,
and a hin of justice, shall ye have (Lev. 19:35, 36). In the same: Thou
shalt not have in thy bag divers stones, great and small; thou shalt not
have in thy house divers ephahs, great and small; a perfect and a just
stone shalt thou have, a perfect and a just ephah shalt thou have (Deut.
25:13-15). And in Ezekiel: Ye shall have balances of justice, and an
ephah of justice, and a bath of justice (Ezek. 45:10). That these
measures and these weights signify the estimation of a thing according
to the quality of truth and good may be seen above (n. 373).

Verse 2. And the court which is without the temple cast out, and measure
it not, signifies that the external of the Word, and thence of the
church and worship, is not to be explored. This is evident from the
signification of the "court," as being the external of the Word, and
thence of the church and of worship. The "court" has this signification
because the "temple" signifies heaven and the church in respect to
Divine truth, as was said in the article above; therefore the "court"
which was "outside the temple or in front of the temple" signifies the
first or lowest heaven. For the "temple," regarded in itself, signifies
the higher heavens; that is, the "adytum," where the ark of the covenant
was, signified the inmost or third heaven, and "the temple outside of
the adytum" signified the middle or second heaven; therefore the "court"
signified the lowest or first heaven; and what signifies heaven
signifies also the church, for the church is the Lord's heaven on the
earth; and what signifies the church, signifies also the Word and
worship, for the Word is the Divine truth, from which are heaven and the
church, and worship is according to Divine truth, which is the Word.
From this it is that the "court" signifies the external or ultimate of
heaven and the church, and also the external or ultimate of the Word and
of worship. \[2\] The Word and worship are altogether as heaven and the
church are; for as there are three heavens, so in the Word there are
three distinct senses: the inmost sense, which is called the celestial
sense, is for the inmost or third heaven; the middle sense, which is
called the spiritual sense, is for the middle or second heaven; and the
ultimate sense, which is called the celestial-natural and
spiritual-natural sense, is for the lowest or first heaven. These three
senses, besides the natural which is for the world, are in the Word and
in all its particulars; and as the three heavens have the Word and each
heaven is in its own sense of the Word, and from this is their heaven
and also their worship, it follows that what signifies heaven signifies
also the Word and worship. This is why the "court" signifies the
external of the Word, and thence the external of the church and of
worship. \[3\] Moreover, it is to be known that the temple had two
courts, one without the temple, and the other within, and "the court
without the temple" signifies the entrance itself into heaven and into
the church, in which are those who are being introduced into heaven;
while "the court within the temple" represented the lowest heaven. It is
similar with the church, also with the Word and with worship; for "the
court without the temple" signifies the external of the Word, that is,
the Word such as it is in the natural sense, which is for the world, by
which man is introduced into its spiritual sense, in which the angels of
heaven are. But what is properly signified by each court, the inner and
the outer, will be told in what follows. Also, why it is here said that
"the court without the temple is to be cast out, and not measured," will
be told in the following article, where it is told what is signified by
"it is given to the nations." \[4\] From this it can now in some measure
be seen what is signified in the Word by "court" and by "courts" in the
following passages. In Moses: Thou shalt make the court of the
tabernacle at the corner of the south towards the south, hangings for
the courts; twenty pillars, twenty bases, the hooks of the pillars and
the fillets of silver, the gate of the court with the veil; its length a
hundred cubits from the south to the north, and its breadth fifty from
the east to the west (Exod. 27:9-18). This court was the court of the
Tent of meeting, which likewise represented and signified the lowest or
first heaven; for "the Tent of meeting" represented heaven; its inmost,
where the ark was, over which was the mercy seat, represented the inmost
or third heaven; the law in the ark, the Lord Himself as to Divine truth
or the Word; and the tent without the veil, where was the table for the
loaves, the altar of incense, and the lamp stand, represented the middle
or second heaven; and the court, the lowest or first heaven. (That the
three heavens were represented by that tent may be seen in Arcana
Coelestia, n. 3478, 9457, 9481, 9485; but what is signified in
particular by the court, and by all things pertaining to it, may be
seen, n. 9741-9775.) \[5\] As the court represented the lowest heaven,
and thence also the external of the church, of the Word, and of worship:
The residue of the meal offerings and of the sacrifices for sin were
eaten by Aaron and his sons in the court (Lev. 6:16, 26). "Eating in the
court" these sanctified things signified appropriating to oneself the
goods of the church that were signified by the meal offerings and these
sacrifices; and all appropriation of holy things is effected by
ultimates, for except through ultimates there can be no appropriation of
interior holy things. \[6\] But the courts of the temple are thus
described in the first book of Kings: Solomon made a court before the
front of the house of the temple. And afterwards he built the inner
court, three layers of hewn stones and a row of hewn cedar (1 Kings 6:3,
36). The temple in like manner represented heaven and the church; the
adytum, where the ark was, represented the inmost or third heaven, also
the church with those who are in inmosts, which is called the celestial
church; the temple outside the adytum represented the middle or second
heaven, also the church with those who are in the middle, which is
called the internal spiritual church; the inner court represented the
lowest or first heaven, also the church with those who are in ultimates,
which is called the internal-natural church; while the outer court
represented the entrance into heaven. \[7\] And as the temple in the
highest sense signified the Lord in relation to the Divine Human, so
also in relation to Divine truth, thence the temple also signifies
Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, consequently the Word, for that
is the Divine truth in the church. That the Lord's Divine Human is
signified by the temple is evident from the Lord's words where He says:
Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up; and He spake
of the temple of His body (John 2:18-23). That the "temple" signifies
the church is evident from these words of the Lord: That there shall not
be left of the temple stone upon stone that shall not be thrown down
(Matt. 24:1, 2; Luke 21:5-7). These words mean that every Divine truth,
consequently everything of the church, is to perish; for the end of the
church, which is called the consummation of the age, is here treated of.
\[8\] That there were two courts built, an inner and an outer, and there
little chambers, porticos, or piazzas, and many other things, can be
seen from the description of them in Ezekiel: The angel brought me to
the outer court, where, behold, there were chambers and a pavement made
for the court round about, thirty chambers upon the pavement, which he
measured as to the length and the breadth; and he also measured the
bedchambers, the portico, the gate, everything as to length and breadth
(Ezek. 40:17-22, 31, 34, et seq.; 42:1-14). And of the inner court it is
said in the same: That he measured the inner court, the gates thereof
towards the north, the east, and the south; the portico, the steps with
the ascents, the bedchambers, the chambers of the singers, the upper
lintels (Ezek. 40:23-31, 44, et seq.). And in Jeremiah: In the chamber
of Gemaliah <span id="fr_277"></span>[630-1](#fn_277.md) the scribe, in the
upper court, at the entrance of the gate of the new house (Jer. 36:10).
In the prophet Ezekiel, from chap. 40 to chap. 48, a new city, a new
temple, and a new earth, are treated of, which signify a New Church that
was to be established by the Lord; and the "chambers," the
"bedchambers," the "porticos," and the rest, signify such things as
belong to the church, its doctrine and worship; and their dimensions
signify their quality (as was said and shown in the article above). But
this is not the place to explain what is signified by the particulars;
only that "courts" signify the external things of heaven and of the
church, and thence the externals of the Word and of worship. That the
externals of these are signified by the "courts" is evident from this
alone, that the "temple" in general signifies heaven and the church,
therefore the three divisions of the temple, namely, the courts, the
temple itself, and the adytum, signify the three heavens according to
their degrees. (Of what nature the three heavens are according to their
degrees, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 29-40.) \[9\] That "the
temple and the courts" signify heaven and the church can be seen more
fully from these words in Ezekiel: The spirit raised me up and brought
me into the inner court of the temple, when behold, the glory of Jehovah
filled the house; and I heard one speaking unto me out of the house,
saying, Son of man, the place of My throne, and the place of the soles
of My feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel
forever (Ezek. 43:4-7). That these "courts" signify the lowest heaven,
or the external of the church, can be seen from its being said that "he
was brought into the court, and thence saw the house filled with the
glory of Jehovah," "the glory of Jehovah" signifying Divine truth, which
constitutes heaven and the church; also afterwards, that that house was
"the place of the throne of Jehovah, and the place of the soles of His
feet, where He will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel forever."
That "the throne of Jehovah" means heaven may be seen above (n. 253,
297, 343, 460, 462, 477, 482); and that "the place of the soles of the
feet of Jehovah" means the church, see also above (n. 606); the "sons of
Israel" mean all who are of the Lord's church, consequently "to dwell
with them forever" signifies the unceasing presence of the Lord with
them. \[10\] In the same: The glory of Jehovah lifted itself up from
above the cherub over the threshold of the house, and the house was
filled with the cloud. And the cloud filled the inner court. And the
court was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah; and the voice
of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court (Ezek.
10:3, 4, 5). The "cherubim" seen by the prophet represented the Lord in
relation to providence and guard that He be not approached except
through good of love; consequently the "cherubim" signify the higher
heavens, particularly the inmost heaven, for this guard is there (see
above n. 277, 313, 322, 362, 370, 462); therefore the "house that was
filled with the cloud" signifies heaven and the church; the "inner
court," which the cloud also filled, signifies the lowest heaven; and
the "outer court," as far as which the voice of the wings of the cherubs
was heard, signifies the entrance into heaven, which is specifically in
the natural world, and afterwards in the world of spirits. For through
the church in the world, and afterwards through the world of spirits,
man enters into heaven. (What the world of spirits is, see in the work
on Heaven and Hell, n. 421-431 seq.) But the "cloud" and "the brightness
of the glory of Jehovah" signify the Divine truth proceeding from the
Lord. \[11\] From this it can now be seen what is signified by "courts"
in the following passages. In David: Blessed is he whom thou choosest
and causest to approach, he shall dwell in Thy courts; we shall be
satisfied with the goodness of Thy house, with the holiness of Thy
temple (Ps. 65:4). This signifies that those who are in charity, or in
spiritual affection, will live in heaven, and there will be in
intelligence and wisdom from Divine truth and Divine good; "the chosen"
(or he whom thou choosest) signifies those who are in love towards the
neighbor or in charity; "causest to approach" signifies spiritual
affection or love, for so far as man is in that love or that affection,
so far he is with the Lord, for everyone approaches Him according to
that love; "to dwell in courts" signifies to live in heaven, "to dwell"
meaning to live, and "courts" meaning heaven; "to be satisfied with the
goodness of the house" signifies to be in wisdom from Divine good; and
"to be satisfied with the holiness of the temple" signifies to be in
intelligence from Divine truth, and from both to enjoy heavenly joy;
"the house of God" signifies heaven and the church in respect to Divine
good, and the "temple" heaven and the church in respect to Divine truth,
and "holiness" is predicated of spiritual good, which is truth. \[12\]
In the same: A day in Thy courts is better than thousands, I have chosen
to stand at the door in the house of my God (Ps. 84:10). "Courts" here
signify the first or lowest heaven, through which there is entrance into
the higher heavens; therefore it is added, "I have chosen to stand at
the door in the house of my God." In the same: Give to Jehovah the glory
of His name, bring an offering, and come into His courts (Ps. 96:8). In
the same: Praise ye the name of Jehovah, praise, O ye servants of
Jehovah, who stand in the house of Jehovah, in the courts of the house
of our God (Ps. 135:1, 2). In the same: How amiable are Thy dwellings, O
Jehovah of Hosts; my soul hath desired, yea is consumed for the courts
of Jehovah (Ps. 84:1, 2). In the same: Come into His gates with
confession, into His courts with praise, confess ye unto Him, bless His
name (Ps. 100:4). In the same: I will pay my vows unto Jehovah before
all His people, in the courts of the house of Jehovah, in the midst of
thee, O Jerusalem (Ps. 116:14, 18, 19). In the same: The righteous shall
flourish as the palm tree, he shall grow as a cedar in Lebanon. Planted
in the house of Jehovah they shall spring forth in the courts of our God
(Ps. 92:12, 13). That in these passages "courts" mean heaven, in
particular the lowest heaven and the church, can be seen without
explanation. \[13\] Likewise in the following passages. In Isaiah: They
shall gather the corn and the new wine, they shall eat and shall praise
Jehovah, and they that shall bring it together shall drink in the courts
of My holiness (Isa. 62:9). "They shall gather the corn and the new
wine" signifies instruction in the goods and truths of doctrine and of
the church; "they shall eat and shall praise Jehovah" signifies
appropriation and the worship of the Lord; "they that shall bring it
together shall drink in the courts of My holiness" signifies the
enjoyment of Divine truth, and the consequent happiness in the heavens.
\[14\] In Joel: Let the priests, the ministers of Jehovah, weep between
the court and the altar, and let them say, Spare Thy people, O Jehovah
(Joel 2:17); "weeping between the court and the altar" signifies
lamentation over the vastation of Divine truth and Divine good in the
church; for the "court" has a similar signification as the "temple,"
namely, the church in respect to Divine truth, and the "altar" signifies
the church in respect to Divine good; therefore "between the court and
the altar" signifies the marriage of good and truth, which constitutes
heaven and the church; and "to weep" signifies lamentation over its
vastation. "Courts" also elsewhere in the Word signify the ultimates of
heaven, also the externals of the church, of the Word, and of worship
(as in Isa. 1:12; Zech. 3:7).

<span class="margnote"><span id="631.">631.</span></span>

For it is given to the nations, signifies since it has been perverted by
evils of life and falsities of doctrine. This is evident from the
signification of "the nations," as being those who are in evils in
respect to life and thence in falsities in respect to doctrine, and in
the abstract sense evils of life and falsities of doctrine. (That evils
and falsities are signified by "nations" see above, n. 175, 331, 625.)
The external of the Word and thence of the church and of worship is
perverted by evils of life and falsities of doctrine, because the
external of the Word, which is called the sense of its letter, is
written according to appearances in the world, because it is for
children and the simple-minded, who have no perception of anything
contrary to appearances, therefore as these advance in age they are
introduced by the sense of the letter, in which are appearances of
truth, into interior truths, and thus appearances are put off by
degrees, and in their place interior truths are implanted. This may be
illustrated by numberless examples; as that we should pray to God not to
lead us into temptations; this is said because it appears as if God so
leads, and yet God leads no one into temptations; again, it is said that
God is angry, punishes, casts into hell, brings evil upon the wicked,
and many other like things, and yet God is never angry, never punishes
or casts into hell, nor does He at all do evil to anyone, but the
wrongdoer himself does this to himself by his evils, for in evils
themselves are the evils of punishment. These things are nevertheless
said in many passages in the Word, because it so appears. As another
example, it is said that: No one should call his father, Father; nor his
master, Master (Matt. 23:8-10). Yet they ought to be so called; but this
is said because the "Father" means the Lord, who creates and begets us
anew, and because He alone teaches and instructs; so when man is in a
spiritual idea he will think of the Lord alone as the Father and Master;
but it is otherwise when man is in a natural idea. Moreover, in the
spiritual world or in heaven, no one knows any other father, teacher, or
master than the Lord, because from Him is spiritual life. So in other
instances. \[2\] From this it can be seen that the external of the Word,
and thence the external of the church and of worship, consists of
apparent truths, therefore those who are in evils in respect to life
apply it to favor their own loves and the principles conceived
therefrom. This is why it is said that the "court," which signifies the
external of the Word, "is given to the nations," and afterwards that
"they shall trample down the holy city." This comes to pass in the end
of the church, when men are so far worldly, natural, and corporeal that
they are wholly unable to see interior truths, which are called
spiritual truths; and from this it follows that they then wholly pervert
the external of the Word, which is the sense of its letter. Such
perversion of the sense of the letter of the Word took place also with
the Jews at the end of the church with them, which is meant in the
spiritual sense by: The soldiers dividing the garments of the Lord, but
not the tunic (John 19:23, 24), which signifies that those who were of
the church perverted all things of the Word in respect to the sense of
its letter, but not the Word in respect to the spiritual sense, because
this they did not know. (That this is what these things mean in the
spiritual sense may be seen above, n. 64.) It is similar in the church
at this day, because this is its end; for at this day the Word is not
explained according to spiritual truths, but according to the
appearances of the sense of the letter, which are applied to confirm
both evils of life and falsities of doctrine; and because interior
truths, which are spiritual truths, are unknown and are not received, it
follows that the sense of the letter of the Word is perverted by evils
of the will and falsities of thought therefrom. This, therefore, is what
is meant by "the court is given to the nations."

<span class="margnote"><span id="632.">632.</span></span>

And the holy city shall they trample down, signifies that they will
destroy all the doctrine of good and truth from the Word. This is
evident from the signification of "the holy city," as being the doctrine
of truth and good from the Word; in the sense of the letter "the holy
city" means Jerusalem, which in the Word here and there is called "the
holy city;" but "Jerusalem" means the church, and a "city" the doctrine
of the church; that a "city" \[civitas or urbs\] signifies doctrine, see
above (n. 223); therefore "the holy city" signifies the doctrine of
Divine truth, for Divine truth is what is called "holy" in the Word (n.
204). This is evident also from the signification of "trampling down,"
as being to destroy altogether, in particular by means of things sensual
and natural, consequently by means of fallacies, which are called the
fallacies of the senses, from which when not explained mere falsities
spring; such things are signified by "trampling down," because trampling
is done by the soles of the feet, and "the soles of the feet" signify
the external sensual things of man, and "feet" his natural things. That
this signification of "soles" and of "feet" is from correspondence, see
above (n. 65, 606; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 96). \[2\] It
is said that "the nations shall trample down the holy city," because
this follows after the words, "The court which is without the temple
cast out, for it is given to the nations," and the "court" signifies the
external of the Word, of the church, and of worship, and the external of
the Word is what is perverted, and thus adulterated and falsified, by
the nations, that is, by those who are in evils and falsities. For, as
was said in the preceding article, the external of the Word, which is
called the sense of its letter, is for children and the simple-minded,
and is therefore written according to appearances, thus for those who
are sensual and natural; for infants are first sensual, afterwards
natural, and when they advance in age they become spiritual. But when a
man does not become spiritual, as is the case with all who live in evil,
he does not understand the Word spiritually, but only naturally and
sensually, and he who so understands the Word perverts it, and explains
it according to the falsities of his religion and according to the evils
of his life. This is why it is said that "they shall trample it down."
Moreover, those who deny and despise the truths of heaven and the church
appear in the spiritual world to trample them under the soles of the
feet, and this, as was said above, because the external sensual of man
corresponds to the soles of the feet, which are what trample down. It is
said that the external sensual of man does this, but it is the sensual
of those only who are merely sensual, who are such as deny the truths of
heaven and the church, and who also believe nothing except what they can
see with their eyes and touch with their hands. \[3\] "To trample down"
is predicated of such in the following passages also. In Luke: They
shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led captive among all
nations, and Jerusalem shall finally be trampled down by the nations,
until the times of the nations shall be fulfilled (Luke 21:24). This has
a similar signification as the passage in Revelation here explained,
that "the court is given to the nations, and the holy city shall they
trample down forty-two months;" for "they shall fall by the edge of the
sword" signifies that they shall perish by falsities; "they shall be led
captive among all nations" signifies that evils will make a prey of the
goods and truths of the church; "Jerusalem shall be trampled down"
signifies the destruction of the church in respect to doctrine; for
"Jerusalem" signifies the church in respect to doctrine; "its being
trampled down by the nations" signifies the total destruction of the
church by evils of life and falsities of doctrine; "until the time of
the nations shall be fulfilled" signifies until evil is consummated (see
above, n. 624); this consummation is also signified by the "forty-two
months." This, too, like what is said in Revelation, was said by the
Lord respecting the time just preceding the Last Judgment. \[4\] In
Ezekiel: Is this a small thing to you? Ye feed upon the good pasture,
and trample down with your feet the remainder of your pastures; ye drink
the sediment of the waters, ye stir up the remainder with your feet; and
thus my flock feeds upon what ye have trampled down with your feet, and
drink that which is stirred up by your feet (Ezek. 34:18, 19). "Good
pasture" signifies all that which spiritually nourishes, especially the
Word and the knowledges of truth and good therefrom; "to feed upon it
and to trample down the remainder with the feet" signifies to so do away
with it that it does not appear, and to so destroy it that it is not,
and this is done by reasonings from the corporeal-sensual, and from the
natural man separated from the spiritual. This therefore is what is
meant by "trampling down with the feet;" "the sediment of the waters"
signify truths defiled by falsities, for "waters" mean truths, and "to
drink thereof" signifies to learn and to receive; "to stir up the
remainder of the waters with the feet" signifies to bring nevertheless
into confusion by reasonings from the natural man the truths that are
not defiled by falsities, "feet" signifying the natural things in man.
From this what is signified by "my flock shall drink what is trampled
down by the feet, and what is stirred up by the feet," can be seen.
\[5\] In Daniel: The he-goat cast the ram to the earth and trampled him
down, nor was there anyone to deliver the ram out of his hand;
afterwards one horn waxed great from a little one; even to the host of
the heavens, and some of the host and of the stars it cast down to the
earth and trampled them down (Dan. 8:7, 9, 10). The "he-goat" here
signifies faith separated from charity, and the "ram" signifies faith
conjoined to charity, thus charity, the same as the "he-goats and sheep"
in Matthew 25:31-46; "the one horn that waxed great from a little one"
signifies justification by faith alone; "the host of the heavens"
signifies all truths and goods of heaven and the church, and the "stars"
signify the knowledges of good and truth; therefore "to trample down the
ram" and also "the host of the heavens" signifies to destroy charity
utterly, and with it all the truths and goods of heaven and the church,
and this by the corporeal-sensual; for they who are in faith separated
from charity, that is, who believe that they are saved by faith alone
whatever their life may be, become corporeal-sensual, and are
consequently in falsities in respect to all things of the Word and of
the church; for they have no perception of the Word otherwise than
according to the ultimate sense of its letter, seeing nothing interiorly
in it; and even if they speak truths from the Word they nevertheless
perceive them falsely; therefore this is what is signified by "the
he-goat cast down to the earth some of the host of the heavens and some
of the stars, and trampled them down." That charity towards the
neighbor, that is, the good of life, is in like manner destroyed, is
meant by "the he-goat cast the ram to the earth and trampled him down;"
for they who are in faith separated from charity, who are meant by the
"he-goat," make faith the essential and charity the nonessential,
therefore they live for the body and the world, and are solicitous about
themselves only, and not at all about the neighbor; and those who do
this cast charity (which is meant by the "ram,") to the earth and
trample it down. \[6\] In Luke: Some seed fell upon the way and was
trampled down, or the fowls of heaven devoured it (Luke 8:5). "Seed"
signifies Divine truth, or the truth of the Word; "to fall upon the way
and be trampled down" signifies to be received only by the
corporeal-sensual, and not interiorly; for that which is received in the
spirit and in the heart is meant by "the seed that fell into the good
earth." "The fowls of heaven that devoured it" signify falsities, for
all evils and falsities therefrom have their seat in the
corporeal-sensual, consequently unless a man becomes spiritual, and
thinks from what is spiritual, he thinks nothing but falsities from
evil. (What the corporeal-sensual is, and what sensual men are, see in
The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 50; also above, n. 342, 543, 550,
552, 554, 556, 559, 563, 569, 570, 580.) \[7\] In Isaiah: I will make
known to you what I will do to My vineyard; in taking away its hedge
that it may be eaten up, and in breaking down its wall that it may be
trampled down (Isa. 5:5). "Vineyard" here signifies the Lord's church,
which is called a spiritual church; "to take away its hedge, and break
down its wall," signifies to falsify and thus destroy the truths that
defend the church; "the hedge and the wall about the vineyard" have a
similar signification as "the wall and the bulwarks about Jerusalem;"
"to eat up and trample down the vineyard" signifies to lay waste the
church, so that no truth and good can spring up, and thus to destroy it.
\[8\] In Jeremiah: Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard, they have
trampled down My field, they have made the field of desire a wilderness
of solitude (Jer. 12:10). Here, too, the "vineyard," like "field,"
signifies the Lord's church; "to destroy," "to trample down," and "to
make a wilderness of solitude" signifies to so destroy that nothing of
the good and truth of the church remains. In Isaiah: Our enemies have
trampled down our <span id="fr_278"></span>[632-1](#fn_278.md) sanctuary
(Isa. 63:18). "Enemies" signify the evils of life; "to trample down the
sanctuary" signifies to destroy the truths of doctrine from the Word,
and this also by means of the corporeal-sensual, for all who are in
evils of life are corporeal-sensual. \[9\] In David: The enemy pursueth
my soul and overtaketh it, and trampleth down my life to the earth, and
maketh my glory to dwell in the dust (Ps. 7:5). Here, too, "enemy"
signifies evil, in general the devil, that is, hell, from which evil
comes; and "to trample down the life to the earth and make glory to
dwell in the dust" signifies to destroy by means of the
corporeal-sensual all truths of heaven and the church; for these
constitute spiritual life, and are signified by "glory;" "dust," too, is
predicated of the corporeal-sensual, and this is also meant by "walking
upon the belly and eating dust," as is here and there said of the
serpent. \[10\] "To trample down" has a similar signification in the
following passages. In Isaiah: I will make the hypocritical nation to be
trampled down like the clay of the streets (Isa. 10:6). In Micah: The
enemy of Jehovah shall be for a trampling down like the mire of the
streets (Mic. 7:10). In Zechariah: They shall be as the mighty ones
trampling down the mire of the streets in the war, and they shall fight
because Jehovah is with them, and they shall make ashamed them that ride
upon horses (Zech. 10:5). In Malachi: Then thou shalt <span
id="fr_279"></span>[632-2](#fn_279.md) trample down the wicked, and they
shall be ashes under the soles of your feet, in the day that I am making
(Mal. 4:3). In Isaiah: The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim,
they shall be trampled down under the feet (Isa. 28:3). In the same: I
have trampled down the peoples in My anger, and made them drunk in My
wrath, and I have made their victory to descend to the earth (Isa.
63:6). In David: Through Thee will we push down our adversaries; in Thy
name will we trample them down that rise up against us (Ps. 44:5). In
the same: God will trample down our adversaries (Ps. 60:12; 108:13). "To
trample down" in these passages also signifies to destroy, which is done
by those who are corporeal-sensual, for those who are such "trample
down" all things of heaven and the church, for they are in what is
lowest, and their thoughts cannot be elevated by the Lord, for they
themselves let them down to the earth, and there they lick the dust.
Such are all those that deny the Divine. For all the evils that a man
has from birth have their seat in his natural and in his
corporeal-sensual; consequently unless he suffers himself to be elevated
out of them by the Lord, which is effected by Divine means, which are
the truths and goods of faith and love, or by the truths and goods of
doctrine and life, he remains in his evils, which are implanted in his
natural and in his corporeal-sensual, and then he tramples down the
celestial and spiritual things belonging to heaven and the church.
\[11\] "To tread upon the lion, the adder, serpents, and scorpions,"
means not only to destroy the evils and falsities that are signified by
these, but also not to be hurt by them; this is meant in David: Thou
shalt tread upon the lion and adder, the young lion and the dragon shalt
thou trample down (Ps. 91:13). In Luke: Behold I give you authority to
tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy,
that nothing may by any means hurt you (Luke 10:19). This is so said in
the Word because those who are in the hells appear before the eyes of
good spirits and angels sometimes in the forms of various beasts and
serpents, according to the kind of evil and of falsity therefrom in
which they are; their thoughts themselves, when they go forth from the
intention of their will, present such appearances. Exhalations from
their evils and falsities continually breathe forth through the lands
that are over these hells, or by which these hells are covered; so that
to walk upon such places is dangerous to those who are only natural, and
still more to those who are corporeal-sensual; for an exhalation arises
therefrom, and a contagion affects those who walk there. But those who
are led by the Lord may safely tread upon that earth without infection
or infestation, because the interiors that are of their mind, or of
their thought and affection, are elevated by the Lord above their
corporeal-sensual, which corresponds to the soles of the feet. This
makes clear what is meant, in a strict sense, by "treading upon the
lion, the adder, the serpents, and the scorpions without being hurt by
them," also why it is so said in the Word. But what is signified by a
"lion" and by "serpents and scorpions" has been told and shown
elsewhere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="633.">633.</span></span>

Forty-two months, signifies even to the end of the old church and the
beginning of the new. This is evident from the signification of
"months," as being states, here the states of the church; for "times,"
whether hours or days or months or years or ages, signify states, and
such states are designated by the numbers by which such times are
determined, as here by the number "forty-two" (that this is so, see
above, n. 571, 610). This is evident also from the signification of
"forty-two" as being the end of the former church and the beginning of
the new; this is the signification of that number, because it means six
weeks, and "six weeks" has a similar signification as the "six days" of
one week, namely, a state of combat and labor, and thus the end when the
church is altogether vastated, or when evil is consummated; and "the
seventh week" which then follows signifies the beginning of a New
Church; for the number "forty-two" arises from the multiplication of six
into seven, six times seven making forty-two, therefore "forty-two" has
a similar signification as "six weeks," and "six weeks" something
similar to the "six days" of one week, namely, a state of combat and
labor, as was said, and also a full state, here the full consummation of
good and truth, that is, the full vastation of the church. \[2\] In the
Word mention is sometimes made of "forty," sometimes days, sometimes
months, sometimes years, and that number signifies either the full
vastation of the church, or a complete temptation. That this state is
signified by the numbers "forty" and "forty-two," can be seen from the
following passages. In Ezekiel: Egypt shall not be inhabited forty
years; I will make Egypt a solitude in the midst of the lands that are
desolate, and her cities in the midst of the cities that are laid waste,
they shall be a solitude forty years; and I will scatter Egypt among the
nations, and will disperse them into the lands. At the end of forty
years I will bring together Egypt from the peoples, whither they were
scattered, and will bring back the captivity of Egypt (Ezek. 29:11-14).
"Egypt" signifies the church in respect to true knowledges
\[scientifica\], upon which doctrine is based. True knowledges at that
time were the knowledges of correspondences and representations, upon
which the doctrine of their church was based. But because the Egyptians
turned these knowledges into magic, and thus perverted the church, its
vastation is described, which is meant by "forty years;" this,
therefore, is the signification of "Egypt shall not be inhabited forty
years, and her cities shall be a solitude forty years." That "Egypt must
be scattered among the nations and dispersed into the lands" signifies
that evils and falsities will altogether occupy that church and pervert
all its knowledges \[scientifica\]. This makes clear that "forty years"
signifies a state of full vastation of the church, or even to its end,
when there will be no more good or truth remaining. But the beginning of
a New Church, which is signified by "the end of forty years," is meant
by these words, "at the end of forty years I will bring together Egypt
from the peoples whither they were scattered, and will bring back the
captivity of Egypt." \[3\] In the same prophecy: That the prophet should
lie on his right side forty days, and lay siege to Jerusalem, which
shall want bread and water, and be desolated, a man and his brother, and
pine away for its iniquity (Ezek. 4:6, 7, 17); has a similar
signification. The full vastation of the church is also here signified
by that number; "Jerusalem" signifies the church; "to lay siege to it"
signifies to distress the church by evils and falsities; "to want bread
and water" signifies to be vastated in respect to the good of love and
the truth of doctrine; "to be desolated, a man and his brother, and to
pine away for iniquity," has a similar signification, for "man and his
brother" mean truth and charity, and "to pine away" means to die out.
\[4\] The "forty days" of the flood have a similar signification in
Genesis: For yet seven days I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty
days and forty nights, and I will destroy all substance that I have made
from upon the faces of the earth. And the rain was upon the earth forty
days and forty nights, then after seven days he sent forth a dove, which
did not return unto him (Gen. 7:4, 12; 8:6, 12). The "flood" signifies
the devastation of the old or most ancient church, likewise the last
judgment upon those who were of that church; "the rain of forty days"
signifies the ruin of that church by the falsities of evil; but the
beginning of a New Church is signified by the drying up of the earth
after those forty days, and by its sprouting up anew; the "dove" that he
sent out signifies the good of charity, which was the essential of that
church. (But respecting these things see Arcana Coelestia, where they
are explained.) \[5\] The law in Moses: That the wicked man might be
smitten with forty stripes, and no more lest thy brother seem vile in
thine eyes (Deut. 25:3); originated in this signification of the number
"forty." Full punishment as well as vastation is described by "forty,"
since punishment is equally the consummation of evil; and as reformation
follows after punishment, it is said that he should not be smitten with
more stripes, "lest thy brother seem vile in thine eyes;" for "forty"
signifies the end of evil, and also the beginning of good, therefore if
he were smitten with more than forty stripes the beginning of good, or
reformation, would not be signified. \[6\] The vastation of the church
with the sons of Jacob by a servitude of four hundred years in Egypt is
signified by the words of Jehovah to Abraham: Know that thy seed shall
be a sojourner in a land not theirs, where they shall subject them to
servitude four hundred years (Gen. 15:13). "Four hundred" has a similar
signification as "forty," just as one "thousand" has a similar
signification as one "hundred," and one "hundred" as "ten." \[7\] The
vastation of the church and also full temptation are signified by the
tarrying of the sons of Israel forty years in the wilderness, which is
thus spoken of in the following passages: Your sons shall be shepherds
in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms even till
your carcasses are consumed <span id="fr_280"></span>[633-1](#fn_280.md) in
the wilderness (Num. 14:33, 34). He made them to wander in the
wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in
the eyes of Jehovah was consumed (Num. 32:13). Jehovah hath known thy
walking through the great wilderness these forty years, Jehovah thy God
hath been with thee that thou lackedst nothing (Deut. 2:7). Thou shalt
remember all the way which Jehovah thy God led thee these forty years in
the wilderness, that He might afflict thee and tempt thee; He fed thee
with manna; to afflict thee, to tempt thee, and to do thee good at the
last (Deut. 8:2, 3, 15, 16). Your fathers tempted Me, they proved Me;
forty years I loathed this generation, and I said, It is a people that
do err in heart, and they have not known My ways (Ps. 95:9, 10). I have
made you to come up out of the land of Egypt, and I have led you in the
wilderness forty years to possess the land of the Amorites (Amos 2:10).
From what has been cited it is clear that "forty years" signifies not
only the vastation of the church with the sons of Israel, but also full
temptation; also "the end of those years" signifies the beginning of a
New Church. The vastation of the church is described by these words,
that "they should be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and should
bear whoredoms, even till their carcasses should be consumed; also by
these, "until all this generation that had done evil in the eyes of
Jehovah was consumed;" also by these, "I loathed this generation, and I
said, It is a people that do err in heart, and they have not known My
ways." But the temptation that is also signified by "forty years" is
described by these words, "Jehovah thy God hath been with thee these
forty years, that thou lackedst nothing;" also by these, "Jehovah led
thee forty years in the wilderness, that He might afflict thee and tempt
thee; and He fed thee with manna;" also by these, "He led thee in the
wilderness to tempt thee, and to do thee good at the last." The
beginning of a New Church, after the end of the forty years, is
described by their introduction into the land of Canaan, which took
place after these forty years; and this is also meant by these words,
"to do thee good at the last;" so also by these, "I have led you in the
wilderness forty years to possess the land of the Amorites." \[8\] Full
temptation is signified also by: Moses was upon Mount Sinai forty days
and forty nights, during which he ate no bread and drank no water (Exod.
24:18; 34:28; Deut. 9:9, 11, 18, 25). In like manner that Jesus was in
the wilderness, tempted by the devil, and fasted there forty days (Matt.
4:1, 2; Mark 1:13; Luke 4:1). From this it can be seen that the number
"forty" in the Word signifies full vastation and consummation, that is,
when all the good of the church is vastated and the evil is consummated;
also that the same number signifies full temptation, and also the
establishment of the church anew, or reformation. From this it can be
known what is signified by "the forty-two months during which the
nations trampled down the holy city," likewise by the following in
Revelation: That there was given to the beast coming up out of the sea a
mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and there was given to him
authority forty-two months (Rev. 13:1, 5). Let no one, therefore,
believe that "forty-two months" mean months, or that any time designated
by numbers is meant here and in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="634.">634.</span></span>

Verses 3, 4. And I will give unto my two witnesses, and they shall
prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the
God of the earth. 3. "And I will give unto my two witnesses," signifies
the good of love and charity, and the truth of doctrine and faith, both
from the Lord (n. 635); "and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred
and sixty days," signifies that they shall teach, and what shall be
taught, even to the end of the old church and the beginning of the new
(n. 636); "clothed in sackcloth," signifies in mourning because of the
non-reception of Divine good and Divine truth (n. 637). 4. "These are
the two olive trees and the two lampstands," signifies celestial good
and spiritual good, or the good of love and the truth of that good (n.
638); "standing before the God of the earth" signifies which are the
Divine things proceeding from the Lord, and are His in heaven and in the
church (n. 639).

<span class="margnote"><span id="635.">635.</span></span>

Verse 3. And I will give unto my two witnesses, signifies the good of
love and charity and the truth of doctrine and faith, both from the
Lord. This is evident from the signification of "witnesses," as being
those who in heart and faith acknowledge and confess the Lord, His
Divine in His Human, and His proceeding Divine; for this is what
essentially bears witness respecting the Lord, that is, acknowledges,
and from acknowledgment confesses Him. (Respecting the signification of
"witness" and "bearing witness," see above, n. 10, 27, 228, 392.) "The
two witnesses" here signify the good of love and charity, and the truth
of doctrine and faith, for it follows that "the two witnesses are the
two olive trees and the two lampstands;" "the two olive trees" signify
the good of love to God and the good of charity towards the neighbor;
and "the two lampstands" signify the truth of doctrine and the truth of
faith (on the signification of these more presently). \[2\] These goods
and truths are meant by the "witnesses," because they, that is, all who
are in them, acknowledge and confess the Lord, for it is the Divine
proceeding that is called the Divine good and the Divine truth, whence
is the good of love to God and the good of charity towards the neighbor,
and the truth of doctrine and the truth of faith thence, which bear
witness concerning Him; from which it follows that those who are in
these likewise bear witness concerning the Lord, that is, acknowledge
and confess Him. For it is the Divine that bears witness concerning the
Divine, and not man from himself; consequently the Lord is in the good
of love, and in the truth of doctrine therefrom, that are in man, and it
is these that bear witness. \[3\] As all acknowledgment and confession
of the Lord, and principally the acknowledgment and confession of the
Divine in His Human, is from the Lord Himself, and as "to bear witness"
signifies to acknowledge and confess this, therefore "to bear witness"
stands for acknowledgment and confession in the Lord's own words
respecting Himself in the following passages. In John: Search the
Scriptures, for they are they which bear witness of Me (John 5:39). The
Sacred Scriptures or the Word is the Divine truth proceeding from the
Lord, and the Divine proceeding is the Lord Himself in heaven and in the
church; so when it is said that "the Scriptures bear witness of Him" it
is meant that the Lord Himself bears witness respecting Himself. In the
same: I am He that beareth witness of Myself, and the Father that sent
Me beareth witness of Me (John 8:18). Here it is openly declared that
the Lord Himself, or the Divine in Him, bears witness of Him. \[4\] In
the same: Jesus said, When the Paraclete is come, the spirit of truth,
he shall bear witness of Me (John 15:26, 27). "The Paraclete, the spirit
of truth," means the Divine proceeding from the Lord, which is the
Divine truth. In the same: Jesus said to Pilate, Thou sayest it, because
I am King; for this have I come into the world, that I might give
testimony to the truth (John 18:37). "To give testimony to the truth"
signifies to cause the Divine truth proceeding from Him to bear witness
of Him; moreover, this Divine truth is signified in the Word by "king."
These passages are cited to make known that "to bear witness" means to
acknowledge and confess the Lord, and that this is from Him;
consequently "to bear witness" means the good of love and charity and
the truth of doctrine and faith, since these are from the Lord and are
His in man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="636.">636.</span></span>

And they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, signifies
that they shall teach, and what shall be taught, even to the end of the
old church and the beginning of the new. This is evident from the
signification of "to prophesy," as being to teach (see above, n. 624);
here both to teach and to be taught, for this is said of "the two
witnesses," which signify the good of love and charity and the truth of
doctrine and faith, for these with man are what teach and what also are
taught; for those who are in the goods of love and in the truths of
doctrine teach, and the goods of love and the truths of doctrine are
what are taught by them. It is evident also from the signification of "a
thousand two hundred and sixty days," as being even to the end of the
old church and the beginning of the new, for "a thousand two hundred and
sixty days" have a similar signification as "three and a half," since a
thousand two hundred and sixty days make three years and a half,
computing three hundred and sixty days to the year, and "three and a
half" signifies the end of a former state and the beginning of a new
one, here the end of the former church and the beginning of the new one,
for this refers here to the last time of the church. Because this is the
signification of this number, it is said in the ninth verse of this
chapter: They shall see their bodies three days and a half, and shall
not suffer them to be placed in sepulchers; and afterwards in the
eleventh verse: And after three days and a half the spirit of life from
God entered into them. In these passages "three days and a half" signify
the end of the old church, when no good of love or truth of doctrine
whatever will be received; and also the beginning of a New Church when
they will be received. The end of the former church is signified by "the
beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall kill these witnesses," and
the beginning of the New Church is signified by "the spirit of life from
God entered into them." The number "a thousand two hundred and sixty"
has a similar signification as "three and a half," because in the Word
"ages," "years," "months," "weeks," "days," and "hours," have a like
signification, for these mean merely times, and times in general and in
particular, or times greater or less, equally signify states, for a
greater or less time designated by numbers does not change the
signification of the thing (as shown above, n. 571, 633). The same
number of days has a like signification in the next chapter of
Revelation: And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a
place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her a thousand two
hundred and sixty days (Rev. 12:6). The "woman" here means the church;
the "wilderness," where she should be nourished, signifies where there
is no reception of good and truth; and "after the passing of those days"
signifies a new state of the church.

<span class="margnote"><span id="637.">637.</span></span>

Clothed in sackcloth, signifies in mourning because of the non-reception
of Divine good and Divine truth. This is evident from the signification
of "clothed in sackcloth," as being mourning because of the vastation
and desolation of Divine good and Divine truth, here because of their
non-reception; for the witnesses were seen clothed in sackcloth, and
they signify the Divine good, from which is every good of love and
charity, and the Divine truth, from which is every truth of doctrine and
faith; these appear to be in mourning when they are not received, but in
joy when they are received. \[2\] Likewise it is said of the sun and
moon, which also signify the good of love and the truth of faith, that:
The sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood
(Rev. 6:12), which signifies that every good of love was separated, and
every truth of faith falsified (see above, n. 401); not that the sun in
the angelic heaven, which is the Lord, ever becomes black, but that it
so appears to those who receive no light from it. \[3\] In ancient
times, when the externals of the church consisted of mere
correspondences and thence of representatives of things spiritual,
mourning was represented by many things that are significative; as by
sitting and lying on the ground, rolling themselves in the dust, by
putting ashes on the head, rending the garments, and putting on
sackcloth. "Rending the garments and putting on sackcloth" signified
mourning because of the desolation of truth and good in the church, and
because of the nonreception of them; for "garments" in general signified
the truths of the church (see above, n. 64, 65, 195, 271, 395, 475,
476); therefore "rending the garments" signified grief because the
truths of the church are hurt and as it were rent asunder by falsities;
and "to be clothed in sackcloth" signifies mourning because of the
deprivation of good and truth, and the consequent vastation of the
church. \[4\] For this reason: When Hezekiah the king heard the words of
Tartan the captain of the king of Assyria, he rent his clothes and
covered himself with sackcloth, and came to the house of Jehovah; and he
sent Eliakim who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and the
elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah (2 Kings 19:1,
2; Isa. 37:1, 2). This was done because the "king of Assyria" here
signifies the perverted rational, or the rational that perverts the
truths and goods of the church and destroys them by falsities; all the
words of Tartan the captain of the king of Assyria, involve such things;
and because the desolation and vastation of the church was seen to be
imminent, to exhibit mourning and grief on this account they rent their
garments and covered themselves with sackcloth. \[5\] Likewise: When
Benhadad the king of Syria besieged Samaria, and there came a great
famine, the king rent his clothes, and as he passed by upon the wall the
people saw that, behold, sackcloth was upon his flesh within (2 Kings
6:30). This has a similar signification as above, namely, the imminent
desolation and devastation of the church; for this reason the king rent
his garments and had sackcloth upon his flesh, which was a
representative sign of mourning and grief. \[6\] Mourning for like
reasons is signified also by the following: Jacob, when he believed that
Joseph was torn to pieces, rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his
loins, and mourned for his son many days (Gen. 37:34). So when Ahab, by
the advice of Jezebel his wife, had taken away the vineyard of Naboth,
and had heard the hard words of the prophet respecting that matter, he
rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, yea, he
lay in sackcloth, and went softly (1 Kings 21:27). The king of Nineveh
also, when he heard the words of Jonah, arose up from his throne, and
laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth, and sat upon
ashes, and proclaimed a fast, and that man and beast should be covered
with sackcloth (Jonah 3:5, 6, 8). So also Daniel set his face to the
Lord God, to seek by supplication and prayer in fasting, sackcloth, and
ashes (Dan. 9:3). When Abner was slain, David said to Joab and to all
the people that were with him, that they should rend their clothes and
gird them with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner; and David himself
walked behind the bier (2 Sam. 3:31). This makes clear that in the
Jewish and Israelitish church mourning was represented by "rending the
clothes and being clothed in sackcloth;" and this because grief of mind
and mourning of heart, which were interior things, were represented at
that time by external things, which because of their correspondences
with spiritual things were significative. \[7\] That the representation
of mourning by sackcloth signified especially mourning because of the
desolation of truth and vastation of good in the church, and also, in
particular, repentance, with mourning of heart on account of evils, can
be seen further from the following passages. In Isaiah: In that day will
the Lord Jehovih of hosts call to weeping and to lamenting, and to
baldness, and to girding on sackcloth (Isa. 22:12). This chapter treats
of the vastation of the church in respect to Divine truth; its mourning
is described by "baldness" and by "putting on sackcloth." \[8\] In
Jeremiah: The lion is gone up from the thicket, and the destroyer of
nations journeyeth; he hath gone forth out of his place to make the land
a waste; thy cities shall be destroyed, that there shall be no
inhabitant; for this gird ye with sackcloth, lament, howl (Jer. 4:7, 8).
"The lion from the thicket" signifies the falsity of evil destroying the
truths of the church; and "the destroyer of nations" signifies the evil
of falsity destroying the good of the church; the "land that they will
make a waste" signifies the church, and the "cities that shall be
destroyed" signify the truths of doctrine; "to gird with sackcloth"
signifies mourning on this account, therefore it is added "lament and
howl." \[9\] In the same: O daughter of My people, gird thee with
sackcloth and roll thee in ashes; make thee mourning for an only one, a
lamentation of bitterness, for the waster shall suddenly come upon us
(Jer. 6:26). "Daughter of the people" means the church; "to gird herself
with sackcloth and roll herself in ashes" signifies mourning because of
the destruction of the good and truth of the church; the destruction of
these or the vastation of the church is meant by "the waster shall
suddenly come." Evidently grievous mourning and grief because of the
destruction of good and truth is signified by "gird thee with sackcloth
and roll thee in ashes," for it is added "make thee mourning for an only
one, a lamentation of bitterness." \[10\] In the same: Howl, O Heshbon,
for Ai is devastated; cry out, ye daughters of Rabbah; gird ye with
sackcloth, lament, and wander among the walls; for their king is gone
into exile, his priests and princes together (Jer. 49:3). This is said
of the sons of Ammon, who signify such as are in natural good and
falsify the truths of the church; those who are such in the church are
meant by "the daughters of Rabbah;" mourning because of the destruction
of truth by falsifications is signified by "Gird ye with sackcloth,
lament, wander among the walls," "walls" signifying truths falsified;
that the truth of the church perished in consequence is signified by
"their king is gone into exile," "king" signifying the truth of the
church, and "to go into exile" signifying to be destroyed. That the
goods of the church and all truths therefrom likewise perished, is
signified by "priests and princes together," "priests" signifying the
goods of the church, and "princes" the truths therefrom. \[11\] In
Lamentations: The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the earth,
they keep silence, they have cast up dust upon their head, they have
girded themselves with sackcloth; the virgins of Jerusalem bend their
head down to the earth (Lam. 2:10). "To sit upon the earth," "to keep
silence," "to cast up dust upon the head," and "to make the head to bend
down to the earth," were all signs representative of mourning and grief
because of the vastation of the church by evils and falsities. "The
elders of the daughter of Zion" signify those that are wise and
intelligent in the church, and in an abstract sense wisdom and
intelligence; "daughters of Zion and the virgins of Jerusalem" signify
those in the church who are in the affection of good and truth, and in
an abstract sense these affections themselves. \[12\] In Ezekiel: The
shipmasters shall make themselves bald for thee, and gird them with
sackcloth, and they shall weep over thee in bitterness of soul, with
bitter lamentation (Ezek. 27:31). This is said of Tyre, which signifies
the church in respect to the knowledges of truth and good, and therefore
also the knowledges of truth and good which belong to the church; here
mourning on account of the destruction of these is described.
"Shipmasters" signify all who bring and communicate these knowledges;
"to make bald" signifies mourning on account of the destruction of all
things of intelligence; "to gird with sackcloth" signifies mourning
because the ability to know truth is also destroyed. Because mourning is
what is described, it is added, "they shall weep over thee in bitterness
of soul, with bitter lamentation." \[13\] In the Gospels: Woe unto thee
Chorazin, woe unto thee Bethsaida, for if the mighty works had been done
in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you, they would have repented
long ago in sackcloth and ashes (Matt. 11:21; Luke 10:13). "To repent in
sackcloth and ashes" means to grieve and mourn because of the
nonreception of Divine truth, and because of the falsities and evils
that obstruct. \[14\] In Joel: Howl as a virgin girded with sackcloth
for the bridegroom of her youth; gird ye and lament, ye priests; howl,
ye ministers of the altar; come, pass the night in sackcloth, ye
ministers of my God, for the meal offering and the drink offering are
withholden from the house of your God (Joel 1:8, 13). Here "to be girded
with sackcloth" and "to pass the night in sackcloth" signify mourning
because the good and truth of the church are destroyed, for the "meal
offering" signifies the good of the church, and the "drink offering" its
truth. \[15\] In Amos: I will bring up sackcloth upon all loins, and
baldness upon every head, and I will make it as a mourning for an only
one, and its latter end as a bitter day (Amos 8:10). "Sackcloth upon the
loins" signifies mourning because the good of love is destroyed, for
this is signified by the "loins;" and "baldness upon the head" signifies
mourning because the understanding of truth is destroyed. \[16\] In
Isaiah: Upon all the heads of Moab is baldness, every beard shaven; in
its streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; upon its roofs
and in its streets he shall howl, flowing down in weeping (Isa. 15:2,
3). In Jeremiah: Every head baldness, and every beard shaven; upon all
hands gashes, and upon the loins sackcloth; upon all the roofs of Moab
and in its streets mourning everywhere (Jer. 48:37, 38). "Moab"
signifies those who are in natural good and who adulterate the goods of
the church; that such have no understanding of truth or knowledge of
truth is signified by "upon all the heads of Moab baldness, and every
beard shaven," also by "upon its roofs and in its streets he shall howl"
and "there shall be mourning;" "upon all hands gashes" signifies things
falsified; mourning because of these things is signified by "to gird
with sackcloth," and "to howl," and "to flow down in weeping." \[17\] In
Isaiah: It shall come to pass in place of spices there shall be
rottenness, and in place of a girdle tatters, and in place of braided
work baldness, and in place of a robe a girding of sackcloth, in place
of beauty burning; thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy might in the
war (Isa. 3:24, 25). This is said of "the daughters of Zion," by whom
the church in respect to the affections of celestial good is signified,
therefore "the daughters of Zion" signify the affections of good that
belong to the celestial church. The loss and dissipation of these
through the pride of self-intelligence is here described by the various
things with which these daughters adorn themselves; the change of these
affections into opposite and unbeautiful affections is signified by "in
place of spices there shall be rottenness, in place of a girdle tatters,
in place of braided work baldness, in place of a robe a girding of
sackcloth, and in place of beauty burning;" "rottenness" signifies the
vital perishing; "in place of a girdle tatters" signifies the
dissipation of perceptions of truth instead of their union; "in place of
braided work baldness" signifies imbecility instead of knowledge
\[scientia\]; "in place of beauty burning" signifies foolishness instead
of intelligence, "burning" signifying insanity from the pride of
self-intelligence, which is foolishness, and "beauty" signifying
intelligence. That the truths of the understanding will perish by
falsities, even till there is no resistance against evils, is signified
by "thy men shall fall by the sword and thy might in the war," "sword"
meaning falsity destroying the truth. \[18\] "Sackcloth" has a similar
meaning in the following passages. In Ezekiel: All hands are relaxed,
all knees go into waters, whence they shall gird themselves with
sackcloth, and terror shall cover them, and upon all faces shall be
shame, and upon all heads baldness (Ezek. 7:17, 18). In David: I, when
they were sick, made sackcloth my vesture, I afflicted my soul with
hunger (Ps. 35:13). When I wept in the fast of my soul it became to me a
reproach; when I made sackcloth my garment I became a byword to them
(Ps. 69:10, 11). In Job: I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have
put my horn in the dust; my face has been soiled by weeping (Job 16:15,
16). In Isaiah: I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make
sackcloth their covering (Isa. 50:3). And in David: Thou hast turned for
me my mourning into dancing, thou hast loosed my sackcloth and hast
girded me with joy (Ps. 30:11). In these passages, too, "sackcloth"
signifies mourning; and "to gird sackcloth over the body instead of the
vesture" signifies mourning because of the destruction of the truth of
the church; and "to gird sackcloth upon the loins and upon the flesh"
signifies mourning because of the destruction of the good of the church;
for "the vesture" signifies the truth of the church, and "loins and
flesh" signify the good of the church. \[19\] That "girding with
sackcloth" was merely representative and thus significative of mourning
and repentance, but was not in itself mourning and repentance, is
evident in Isaiah: Is such the fast that I shall choose, the day for a
man to afflict his soul, to bow down his head as a rush, and to lie down
in sackcloth and ashes; wilt thou call this a fast, and the day of
Jehovah's good pleasure? Is not this the fast that I choose, to loose
the bonds of wickedness, to break thy bread to the hungry, and to bring
the afflicted exiles to the home, and when thou seest the naked that
thou cover him? (Isa. 58:5-7) And in Joel: Turn ye back unto me with
your whole heart, and in fasting and in weeping and in lamentation, and
rend your heart and not your garments (Joel 2:12, 13).

<span class="margnote"><span id="638.">638.</span></span>

Verse 4. These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, signifies
the good of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbor, and
the truth of doctrine and of faith from which are heaven and the church.
This is evident from the signification of an "olive yard," "olive tree,"
and "olive," as being, in a broad sense, the Lord's celestial kingdom
and thus the celestial church; which is distinguished from other
churches in this, that those from whom that church exists are in love to
the Lord and in love towards the neighbor. This is why "olive tree" and
"olive" signify each of these loves, that is, the good of each love.
(That "olive tree" and "olive" signify that church, or those goods of
the church, will be seen in what follows.) This is evident also from the
signification of a "lampstand," as being in a broad sense the Lord's
spiritual kingdom, and thus the spiritual church, and as the chief thing
of that church is truth of doctrine and truth of faith, so these also
are signified by the "lampstands." (That this is the meaning of a "lamp
stand" in the spiritual sense, see above, n. 62.) \[2\] It is said that
"the two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands"
(which yet are four), because "two" signifies conjunction and thence a
one. For there are two things that make a one, namely, good and truth;
good is not good except it be from truth, and truth is not truth except
it be from good; consequently it is only when these two make a one that
they have being and existence. This conjunction into one is called the
heavenly marriage, and heaven and the church are from that marriage. It
is similar with the celestial good, which is signified by "the two olive
trees," and with the spiritual good, which is signified by "the two
lampstands." For the good in the Lord's celestial kingdom is the good of
love to the Lord, and the truth of that good is called the good of love
towards a brother and companion; while the good in the Lord's spiritual
kingdom is the good of charity towards the neighbor, and the truth of
that good is called the good of faith. But a just idea of these things
can scarcely be had unless it is known what celestial good is, and what
spiritual good is, and what the difference between them is. This makes
clear why it is that "the two witnesses" are called "two olive trees and
two lampstands." (That "two" signifies conjunction into one, or the
heavenly marriage, see above, n. 532, at the end.) \[3\] An "olive tree"
signifies the celestial church, because "trees" in general signify
perceptions and knowledges, and every church is a church from the
knowledges of truth and good, and according to their perception; and
"oil" signifies the good of love (see above, n. 375); so an "olive yard"
and "olive tree" signify the church in which that good reigns. There are
three trees that especially signify the church, namely, the "olive
tree," the "vine," and the "fig tree," the "olive tree" signifying the
celestial church, "the vine" the spiritual church, and the "fig tree"
the external, celestial and spiritual church. \[4\] That such is the
signification of "the two olive trees and the two lampstands" anyone can
see and conclude from this, that they are called "witnesses," and thus
are what bear witness of the Lord, that is, acknowledge and confess Him;
also from what is said of them in what follows, that "the beast killed
them," and afterwards that "the spirit of life from God entered into
them," which could not be said of olive trees and lampstands, unless
these signified such things as are from the Lord with the angels of
heaven and with the men of the church, and bear witness of the Lord,
that is, cause angels and men to bear witness of Him. For angels and men
cannot from themselves bear witness of the Lord, but the good and truth
that are with them from the Lord do this, that is, the Lord Himself from
His good and truth with them. \[5\] In many passages in the Word gardens
and forests, also olive yards and vineyards and also trees of many
kinds, as the olive tree, the vine, the fig tree, the cedar, the poplar,
and the oak are mentioned; but no one has known heretofore that each of
these signifies something spiritual belonging to heaven and the church,
except that a "vineyard" signifies the church; but not only does a
"vineyard" signify the church but also an "olive yard," and a "forest of
cedar" or "Lebanon," and even trees, such as the "olive tree," the
"vine," the "fig tree," the "cedar;" and it is because these signify the
church and the spiritual things belonging thereto that they are so often
mentioned in the Word. \[6\] In respect to gardens and forests: "gardens
or paradises" signify in particular the intelligence and wisdom which
the men of the church have; and "forests or groves" signify the
intelligence of the natural man, which regarded in itself is knowledge
serviceable to the intelligence of the spiritual man; but an "olive
yard" and "vineyard" signify the church, "olive yard" the celestial
church, or the church that is in the good of love to the Lord, and
"vineyard" the spiritual church, or the church that is in the good of
charity towards the neighbor, and thence in the truths of faith. The
"olive" and "vine" have a like signification; and this because "oil"
signifies the good of love to the Lord, and "wine" the good of charity
towards the neighbor and the good of faith; while a "fig tree" signifies
the church both celestial and spiritual, but external. These things have
these significations from representatives in the spiritual world, and
thus from correspondence; for in the inmost heaven, where the Lord's
celestial kingdom is, and where love to the Lord reigns, the paradises
and forests consist of olive yards and fig trees; but in the second
heaven they consist of vineyards and many kinds of fruit bearing trees;
in like manner in the lowest heaven, but with the difference that in
this heaven the trees are not so noble. Such things exist in the
heavens, because they correspond to the wisdom, intelligence, love,
charity, and faith of the angels who are in those heavens. From this it
can now be seen why "the witnesses" are called "olive trees," namely,
because "olive trees" mean all who constitute the Lord's celestial
church, that is, who are in the good of love to the Lord, and in the
good of love towards a brother and companion. \[7\] That such is the
signification in the Word of "olive yards," "olive trees," and "olives,"
can be seen from the following passages. In Zechariah: Two olive trees
near the lampstand, one on the right side of the bowl and the other near
its left side; and two olive berries; these are the two sons of the
olive tree standing by the Lord of the whole earth (Zech. 4:3, 11, 12,
14). This treats of the foundation of the house or temple by Zerubbabel;
and the "house" or "temple" signifies the church, therefore a
"lampstand" was seen by the prophet, and "near it two olive trees,"
almost the same as what was seen by John here in Revelation; and the
"two olive trees" and "olive berries" signify celestial goods, which are
the goods of love to the Lord and of love towards a brother and
companion; the former good is signified by "the olive tree seen at the
right side of the bowl," and the latter by "the olive tree seen near the
left side." The truths of this good are meant by "the sons of the olive
tree standing by the Lord of the whole earth," "to stand by Him"
signifying to be and to exist from Him. \[8\] Because these goods are
signified by "olive trees": The cherubim in the midst of the house or
temple were made of olive wood, likewise the doors to the adytum, and
the door posts (1 Kings 6:23-33). For the "cherubim," as well as the
doors and posts to the adytum of the temple, signified the guard that
there be no approach to the Lord except through the good of love; the
"adytum" signified where the Lord is, and "olive wood" the good of love,
because "the olive yard," "the olive tree," and "the olive" signify the
celestial things that are of love. \[9\] Because "the olive yard" and
"the olive tree" signified a church that is in love to the Lord: The oil
of holiness with which all the holy things of the church were anointed
was made of olive oil and spices mixed with it (Exod. 30:23, 24). For
all things of the church are holy Divine things just so far as they are
derived from love to the Lord; therefore by means of that oil a
representation of the Lord and of heaven and the church was established.
(See an explanation of these things in Arcana Coelestia.) \[10\] For the
same reason: Pure olive oil was beaten for the light in the Tent of
meeting, which was lighted up every evening (Exod. 27:20; Lev. 24:2).
That "light" or the "lamp stand" there signified the Lord's spiritual
church, and the "fire" kindled in the lamps signified spiritual love,
which is love towards the neighbor; the "pure olive oil beaten" from
which was the fire has a similar signification (respecting which see
Arcana Coelestia on that passage). \[11\] That "olive tree" and "olive"
signify the good of love is evident also from the following passages. In
Hosea: I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily,
and he shall infix his roots as Lebanon; his branches shall spread; and
his honor shall be as that of the olive, and his odor as that of Lebanon
(Hos. 14:5, 6). This is said of the spiritual church, which is signified
by "Israel;" "to be to him as the dew" signifies the existence and
spiritual new birth of that church; the first state of its new birth or
regeneration is signified by "he shall blossom as the lily," "lily"
signifying the blossoming that precedes the fruit; the second state of
regeneration is signified by "he shall infix his roots," which state is
its existence in the natural, for there the roots are fixed; the third
state is signified by "his branches shall spread," which signifies the
multiplication of knowledges and of cognitions; the fifth <span
id="fr_281"></span>[638-1](#fn_281.md) state, which is the state of fruit
bearing, is signified by "his honor shall be as that of the olive," the
"olive" signifying the good of love, of which "honor" is predicated
(that "honor" is predicated of the good of love, see above, n. 288,
345); and the sixth <span id="fr_282"></span>[638-2](#fn_282.md) state,
which is the state of intelligence and wisdom, is signified by "his odor
as that of Lebanon," "odor" signifying perception, and "Lebanon"
rationality, from which are intelligence and wisdom. \[12\] In David: I
am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the mercy of
God for an age and forever (Ps. 52:8). It is said "like a green olive
tree in the house of God," because a "green olive tree" signifies the
good of love springing up by means of the truth of the Word; and the
"house of God" signifies the church. \[13\] In the same: Thy wife shall
be as the fruitful vine on the sides of thy house; thy sons like olive
plants around thy tables; thus shall the man be blessed that feareth
Jehovah (Ps. 128:3, 4). In the natural sense, which is the sense of the
letter, this refers to a wife and sons, and the enjoyments arising from
marriage and prolification, but in the internal sense, which is the
sense of the spirit of the Word, "wife" signifies the affection of
truth, and "sons" the truths themselves springing therefrom; for every
truth in which there is life is born from the affection of truth; and
because a "wife" signifies that affection she is compared to a fruitful
vine, since a "vine" signifies the church, and a "fruitful vine" the
church in respect to the affection of truth. A "house" signifies the
spiritual mind, and its "sides" signify all things in the natural man;
"sons" signify the truths that are born from that spiritual affection,
and these are compared to "olive plants," because through truths the
goods of love and charity, which are olive trees, are brought forth;
"around the tables" signifies the enjoyments arising from spiritual
appropriation and nourishment. \[14\] In Moses: It shall be when Jehovah
thy God hath brought thee into the land, He shall give thee great and
good cities which thou buildedst not, and houses full of every good
thing which thou filledst not, and cisterns hewn out which thou hewedst
not, vineyards and olive yards which thou plantedst not (Deut. 6:10,
11). The meaning of these words in the spiritual sense is altogether
different from their meaning in the historical sense; for in the
spiritual sense "the land of Canaan," into which they were to be
brought, signifies the church; therefore "cities," "houses," "cisterns,"
"vineyards," and "olive yards" signify such things as belong to the
church; "great and good cities" signify the doctrinals, which teach the
goods of love and charity; "houses full of every good thing" signify all
things of wisdom; "cisterns hewn out" signify all things of intelligence
in the natural man, which are cognitions and knowledges; "vineyards and
olive yards" signify all things of the church in respect to truths and
goods. \[15\] It is related of Noah: That he sent forth a dove out of
the ark, which returned to him about the time of evening, bearing in its
mouth the leaf of an olive plucked off, so that he knew that the waters
were abated (Gen. 8:10, 11). This describes in the spiritual sense the
regeneration of the man of the church, signified by "Noah and his sons;"
here the "dove" sent out a second time signifies the second successive
state, which is the state when, falsities having been removed, spiritual
good begins to spring forth through truths; for a "leaf" signifies
truth, and "olive" the good springing forth therefrom, and "waters"
signify falsities. (This may be seen more fully explained in Arcana
Coelestia, n. 870-892.) \[16\] In Zechariah: His feet shall stand in
that day upon the Mount of Olives, which is before the faces of
Jerusalem on the east; and the Mount of Olives shall be cloven asunder,
a part thereof toward the east and toward the sea with a valley
exceeding great, and a part of the mountain shall withdraw toward the
north, and a part of it toward the south (Zech. 14:4). What this
signifies has been explained above (n. 405), where it was shown that
"the Mount of Olives" signifies the Divine love. For the Mount of Olives
was on the east of Jerusalem, and "Jerusalem" signifies the church in
respect to doctrine; and every church and every truth of doctrine is
illuminated and receives light from the Lord in the east; and the east
in heaven is where the Lord appears as a sun; and as the "sun" signifies
the Divine love, so the "east" and "the Mount of Olives," which was on
the east of Jerusalem, have the same signification. Because that
mountain, as has been said, signified the Lord's Divine love, the Lord
was accustomed to stay on it, as in the Gospels: That Jesus every day
was teaching in the temple, and every night He went out and lodged in
the mount that is called the Mount of Olives (Luke 21:37; 22:39; John
8:1); That upon that mountain He spoke with His disciples about the Last
Judgment (Matt. 24:3, et seq.; Mark 13:3, et seq.); And that He went
therefrom to Jerusalem and suffered; besides many other things (Matt.
21:1; 26:30; Mark 11:1; 14:26; Luke 19:29, 37; 21:37; 22:39; John 8:1).
All these things took place because "the Mount of Olives" signified the
Divine love; and things significative, because they were representative
of heaven and the church, were what at that time conjoined the Lord with
heaven and the world. Moreover, the angels of the inmost or third heaven
dwell in the east upon mountains, where olive trees abound more than all
other trees. \[17\] In Jeremiah: Jehovah called thy name a green olive
tree, beautiful with fruit of form; at the voice of a great tumult He
hath kindled a fire upon it, and they have broken its branches; for
Jehovah of Hosts, who planted thee, hath spoken evil against thee,
because of the wickedness of the house of Israel and of the house of
Judah (Jer. 11:16, 17). Here the house of Judah and Israel is called "a
green olive tree, beautiful with fruit of form," because "the olive
tree" and its "fruit" signify the good of love, and "green" and
"beautiful in form" signify the truth of that good, from which comes
intelligence; for "the house of Judah" signifies the church in respect
to the good of love, and "the house of Israel" the church in respect to
the truth of that good; "to call its name" signifies its quality; the
destruction and vastation of that church by the love of evil is
described by "Jehovah hath kindled a fire upon it, and hath broken its
branches," "fire" signifying the love of evil, and "branches" truths,
which are said "to be broken" when they perish by reason of that love.
This is attributed to Jehovah because of the appearance that all evil of
punishment <span id="fr_283"></span>[638-3](#fn_283.md) seems to be from
God, because He is omnipotent and does not avert it; for it is not known
that to avert the evil of punishment would be contrary to order, for if
it were averted evil would increase until there would be no good
remaining. \[18\] In Isaiah: So shall it be in the midst of the land, in
the midst of the peoples, as the beating of an olive tree, as the
gleanings when the vintage is done (Isa. 24:13). This, too, is said of
the vastation of the church in respect to celestial good, and in respect
to spiritual good; celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and
spiritual good is in its essence truth from that good; celestial good is
signified by the "olive tree," and spiritual good which is the truth
from celestial good is signified by the "vintage;" vastation is
signified by the "beating" and "gleanings" after the consummation.
\[19\] In Moses: Thou shalt plant vineyards and cultivate them, but the
wine thou shalt not drink, for the worm shall devour it; thou shalt have
olive trees in all thy border, but thou shalt not anoint thee with the
oil, because thy olive shall be shaken off (Deut. 28:39, 40). A
"vineyard" signifies the spiritual church, and an "olive tree" the
celestial church, so a "vineyard" signifies also the truth of the
church, and an "olive tree" its good; therefore "to plant a vineyard and
cultivate it and not drink the wine" signifies that although the church
is established and truths of doctrine are taught, still truths will
neither affect nor perfect, "wine" signifying the truth of doctrine;
"for the worm shall devour it" signifies that falsities will destroy;
"thou shalt have olive trees in all thy border" signifies that there
will be the goods of love from the Lord through the Word and preachings
from the Word throughout the church; "not to anoint with oil" signifies
no enjoyment, nevertheless, of any good, or any joy therefrom; "thy
olive shall be shaken off" signifies that that good will perish. This
has reference to the curse if they should worship other gods, and should
not keep the statutes and judgments. \[20\] In Micah: Thou shalt tread
the olive but shalt not anoint thee with oil, and the new wine but thou
shalt not drink wine (Mic. 6:15). In Amos: I have smitten with blasting
and mildew your many gardens and your vineyards; and the palmerworm hath
devoured your fig trees and your olive trees; yet have ye not returned
unto Me (Amos 4:9). "Gardens" signify such things as belong to spiritual
intelligence; "blasting and mildew" signify evil and falsity in what is
most external, or from the corporeal-sensual; "vineyards" signify the
spiritual or interior truths of the church; "fig trees" exterior goods
and truths, which are also called moral; but "olive trees" the goods of
the church; and the "palmerworm" signifies falsity destroying good.
\[21\] In Habakkuk: The fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall there
be produce on the vines, the labor of the olive yard shall dissemble,
and the field shall yield no food (Hab. 3:17). Here, too, the "fig tree"
signifies the externals of the church, "vines" its internals; the "olive
yard" its goods; and the "field" the church itself with man. \[22\] In
the first book of Samuel: The king shall take your fields and your
vineyards and your olive yards, and shall give them to his servants (1
Sam. 8:14). Here, too, "fields," "vineyards," and "olive yards" have the
same signification. The right of the king is here treated of, by which
is meant and described the dominion of the natural man over the
spiritual, namely, that it will destroy all the truths and goods of the
church, and make them serve the natural man, and thus evils and
falsities. \[23\] In the book of Judges: Jotham said unto the citizens
of Shechem, who had made Abimelech king, The trees went forth to anoint
a king over them, and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
But the olive tree said unto them, Shall I make my fatness to cease,
which God and men honor in me, and go to move myself over the trees? And
the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, reign over us. But the fig
tree said unto them, Shall I make my sweetness to cease, and my good
produce; and go to move myself over the trees? And the trees said unto
the vine, Come thou, reign over us. But the vine said unto them, Shall I
cause my new wine to cease, that maketh glad God and men, and go to move
myself over the trees? And all the trees said unto the thorn bush, Come
thou, reign over us. And the thorn bush said unto the trees, If in truth
ye anoint me for a king over you, come and put your trust in my shadow,
but if not, let anger <span id="fr_284"></span>[638-4](#fn_284.md) go out
from the thorn bush and devour the cedars of Lebanon (Judg. 9:7-15).
These words of Jotham signify that the citizens of Shechem were not
willing to have celestial good, which is the "olive tree," nor the truth
of that good, which is the "vine," nor moral good, that is, external
celestial and spiritual good, which is the "fig tree," to reign over
them, but the evil of falsity, which appeared to them as good, which is
the "thorn bush;" the fire from this is the evil of lust; the "cedars of
Lebanon" are things rational which are from truths. From the passages
quoted above it can be seen that in most places the olive tree and the
vineyard are mentioned together, which is done because of the marriage
of good and truth in every particular of the Word; for "olive tree" and
"oil" signify the good of the church, and "vineyard" and "wine" the
truth of that good. (That "oil" signifies the good of love, and the
delight of heaven therefrom, may be seen above, n. 375; and that "wine"
signifies the good of charity and truth of faith, n. 376.)

Standing before the God of the earth, signifies which are the Divine
things proceeding from the Lord, and are His in heaven and in the
church. This is evident from the signification of "the God of the
earth," as being the Lord, who is the God of heaven and earth, and
particularly the God of the church in heaven and in the world; for in
the Word "the earth" signifies the church, and the church is both in
heaven and in the world. "The earth" means heaven and also the church
there, because there are lands in the spiritual world, like as in the
natural world, and in external appearance they are altogether similar in
that world as in this; this is why "the God of the earth" means the God
of heaven and earth, and particularly the God of the church in heaven
and in the world. That the Lord is the God of heaven and earth He
Himself teaches in Matthew: Jesus said, All power hath been given unto
Me in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). The above is evident also from
the signification of "standing before Him," as meaning the being
\[esse\] from Him, and thus what is His in heaven and in the church.
\[2\] In the Word it is here and there said of angels and of the men of
the church that "they stand before God," also that "they walk before
Him," and in the spiritual sense "to stand before God" signifies being
from Him, and "to walk before God" signifies to live according to being
\[esse\] from Him; for all the being \[esse\] of heaven and the world
proceeds from the Lord; for it is the Divine proceeding that has created
and formed all things of heaven and the world; this Divine proceeding is
called "the Word" in John 1:1-3; and "the Word" there is the Divine
proceeding, which is called Divine truth, from which all things were
made and created. Because this extends itself in every direction about
the Lord as a sun, it is properly said "to stand before Him," for it
looks to the Lord as its common center, from every quarter and from
every boundary. This is, in its essence, the Lord in heaven, for it is
the Divine proceeding, and that which proceeds is of Him from whom it
proceeds, and indeed is Himself; just as the heat and light that proceed
from the sun are of the sun. For this reason all angels, who are
recipients of this Divine proceeding, which is called Divine truth, turn
themselves to the Lord, and thus are continually in His presence; for,
as was said, the Divine proceeding looks to the Lord as its center from
which it is and to which it looks; so also do the angels, who are the
recipients of Divine truths, and are as it were Divine truths in form.
This is why angels are said "to stand before the Lord," for "to stand"
is properly predicated of Divine truth, because this stands about the
Lord as a sun. \[3\] "To stand before God" signifies to be in Divine
truth, and thus with the Lord, also in the following passages. In Luke:
The angel said, I am Gabriel, that standeth before God (Luke 1:19). In
the first book of Kings: I saw Jehovah sitting on His throne, and all
the hosts of the heavens standing beside Him on His right hand and on
His left (1 Kings 22:19). In Jeremiah: There shall not be cut off from
Jonadab a man to stand before Me all the days (Jer. 35:19). In David: On
my right hand standeth the queen in the best gold of Ophir (Ps. 45:9).
In Luke: Be ye wakeful at every season, that ye may be accounted worthy
to stand before the Son of man (Luke 21:36). In Revelation: The great
day of His anger is come, and who is able to stand? (Rev. 6:17) All the
angels stood around the throne, and the elders and the four animals
(Rev. 7:11). I saw the seven angels who stood before God (Rev. 8:2). In
Zechariah: The two olive trees and two berries of olives, which are the
two sons of the olive tree standing beside the Lord of the whole earth
(Zech. 4:11, 12, 14). And in other places. It is also said of the Lord
Himself that "He stood to judge," because it is said of the Divine
proceeding from the Lord, which is called the Divine truth, for judgment
is from it. Thus it is said in Isaiah: Jehovah hath stood up to plead,
and standeth to judge (Isa. 3:13). And in David: God stood in the
congregation of God, in the midst of the gods He will judge (Ps. 82:1.)
"The congregation of God," and the "gods" in the midst of whom Jehovah
stood, mean the angels, by whom in the spiritual sense Divine truths are
signified; and because the Lord in heaven is the Divine truth He is here
said "to stand." This makes clear that "to stand before the God of the
earth" signifies the Divine proceeding from the Lord, which is His in
heaven and in the church; that this, and those who are in this, are
meant can be seen also from this, "to stand before the God of the earth"
is predicated of "the two olive trees" and "the two lampstands," and
these signify good and truth, and thus the Divine proceeding. (See also
in the preceding article, n. 638.)

Verses 5, 6. And if anyone will hurt them, fire shall go forth out of
their mouth and shall devour their enemies; and if anyone will hurt
them, thus must he be killed. These have power to shut heaven that it
rain no rain in the days of their prophecy; and they have power over the
waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with every plague
as often as they will. 5. "And if anyone will hurt them," signifies
protection of these by the Lord that they be not hurt in any way (n.
641); "fire shall go forth out of their mouth and shall devour their
enemies," signifies that those who would do them harm fall into the
evils and falsities which are from hell, and these destroy them (n.
642); "and if anyone will hurt them, thus must he be killed," signifies
that according to their endeavor to inflict evil they perish (n. 643).
6. "These have power to shut heaven that it rain no rain in the days of
their prophecy," signifies that those who reject the goods and truths of
heaven and the church, that proceed from the Lord, receive no influx out
of heaven (n. 644); "and they have power over the waters to turn them
into blood," signifies that truths with such are turned into the
falsities of evil (n. 645); "and to smite the earth with every plague,"
signifies that the church with such is destroyed by the lusts of evil
(n. 646); "as often as they will," signifies as often as a man assaults
the goods of love and the truths of doctrine that bear witness of the
Lord and from which man acknowledges and confesses the Lord, that he may
inflict evil upon them (n. 647).

<span class="margnote"><span id="641.">641.</span></span>

Verse 5. And if anyone will hurt them, signifies protection of these by
the Lord, that they be not hurt in any way. This is evident from what
follows; for it is said, "if anyone will hurt them, fire, shall go forth
out of their mouth and shall devour their enemies;" also "if anyone will
hurt them, thus must he be killed." From these words and those that
further follow it is evident that "if anyone will hurt them" signifies
protection by the Lord that they be not hurt in any way. This is said of
"the two witnesses," which signify the doctrine of the good of love to
the Lord and of the good of charity towards the neighbor, which is the
doctrine of life, which the doctrine of faith is to serve; and these
doctrines will be preached at the time of the end of the church. \[2\]
What the words that follow in these two verses involve has been told
above, but since they are among things unknown it shall be told again.
When the end of a church is at hand, then the interior things of the
Word, of the church, and of worship, are revealed and taught. This is
done that the good may be separated from the evil; there is a separation
because the interior things of the Word, of the church, and of worship,
which are celestial and spiritual, are received by the good, but are
rejected by the evil. Moreover, the interior things of the Word, which
are revealed at the end of the church, are serviceable for doctrine and
life to the New Church that is also then established. That this is so is
evident from this, that when the end of the Jewish Church was at hand
the Lord Himself opened and taught the interior things of the Word, and
especially revealed those things in the Word that had been foretold of
Himself; and when these had been opened and revealed the externals of
the church were abrogated, which consisted chiefly of sacrifices and
rituals and statutes which shadowed forth the Lord, and represented and
thence signified the interior things of the church which He was
revealing. That this would be done was predicted in various passages in
the prophets. \[3\] The like has been done at the present time; for it
has now pleased the Lord to reveal many arcana of heaven, especially the
internal or spiritual sense of the Word, which has heretofore been
wholly unknown, and with that He has taught the genuine truths of
doctrine. This revelation is meant by "the coming of the Lord" in
Matthew 24:3, 30, 37. A revelation is necessary at the end of the church
in order, as has been said, that by means of it the good may become
separated from the evil, and a New Church established, and this not only
in the natural world where men are, but also in the spiritual world
where spirits and angels are; for in both worlds there is a church, and
revelation takes place in both, and thereby separation, as also the
establishment of a New Church. From this it can be seen that these words
signify protection by the Lord that they be not hurt. \[4\] As regards
the successive states of the churches on our globe, they have evidently
been similar to the successive states of a man who is being reformed and
regenerated, namely, that to become a spiritual man, he is first
conceived, next is born, then grows up, and is afterwards led on further
and further into intelligence and wisdom. The church, from the most
ancient times to the end of the Jewish Church, progressed like a man who
is conceived, born, and grows up, and is then instructed and taught; but
the successive states of the church after the end of the Jewish Church,
or from the time of the Lord even to the present day, have been like a
man increasing in intelligence and wisdom, or becoming regenerate. For
this end the interior things of the Word, of the church, and of worship,
were revealed by the Lord when He was in the world; and now again,
things still more interior are revealed; and in the measure that things
interior are revealed can man become wiser; for to become interior is to
become wiser, and to become wiser is to become interior.

<span class="margnote"><span id="642.">642.</span></span>

Fire shall go forth out of their mouth and shall devour their enemies,
signifies that those who would do them harm fall into evils and
falsities which are from hell, and these destroy them. This is evident
from the signification of "fire," as being love in both senses, here the
love of self and of the world, and thus the love of evil and falsity of
every kind (of which above, n. 68, 504, 539). From this it follows that
"fire shall go forth out of their mouth" signifies that those who desire
to hurt them or do them harm fall into evils and falsities of every
kind, which are from hell. Also from the signification of "devouring
their enemies," as being that such will be destroyed by the falsities of
evil; for "enemies" in the Word signify the falsities of evil, and
"adversaries" evils, and the love of evil and falsity is what destroys.
\[2\] It is said that "fire shall go forth out of their mouth;" but this
is said according to appearance, and it is according to this that it is
also said that "fire and a flame go forth out of the mouth of God," and
that "anger and wrath go forth from His nostril," and yet nothing of the
fire of anger and wrath goes forth from Him, for He is good itself, love
itself, and mercy itself, from which nothing of fire, of anger, or of
wrath, can go forth, yet it is so said, because it so appears. It so
appears, because when an evil and infernal spirit assails anything
Divine with intent of hurting it, as when he blasphemes the Lord or the
Word, or any good and truth of doctrine, or any good spirit or angel
whom the Lord protects, that evil spirit immediately deprives himself of
the Lord's protection; for every spirit, the evil as well as the good,
is under the Lord's protection, and when that is taken away, he falls
into evils and falsities of every kind which are from hell, and at the
same time he falls into the hands of those that are from hell, who are
called punishers, and these then punish and torment him according to the
evil that he has done or has attempted to do. From this it can be seen
that the Lord does no evil to such, but that the evil spirit himself
brings evil upon himself, that is, the evil itself which is in him does
it. \[3\] This makes clear the meaning of the words, "If anyone desires
to hurt the two witnesses, fire shall go forth out of their mouth and
shall devour them;" the two witnesses are the good of love and charity,
and the truth of doctrine and faith; and these are Divine, because they
are from the Lord with angel and man; the meaning is, not that fire will
go forth from these, but from the evil itself, which endeavors to do
them harm, as has just been said; and that this is to be understood in a
similar way as when it was said that fire, anger, and wrath go forth
from Jehovah. (But these things are more fully set forth in the work on
Heaven and Hell, n. 545-550, under the head, The Lord Casts no one down
into Hell, but the Spirit Casts himself down.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="643.">643.</span></span>

And if anyone will hurt them, thus must he be killed, signifies that
according to their endeavor to inflict evil they perish. This is evident
from the signification of "will hurt," as being the endeavor to inflict
evil, for to will is to endeavor; also from the signification of "to be
killed," as being to perish, here in respect to spiritual life, which is
destroyed solely by the evils and the falsities of evil, for such are
the cause of spiritual death (see above, n. 315, 589). It is here again
said "If any will hurt them," because it is meant that everyone perishes
according to his wish or endeavor to inflict evil, for it is the will
that makes the life of everyone. Everyone perishes according to his wish
to hurt "the two witnesses," who are the "two olive trees and the two
lampstands," that is, the good of love and charity, and the truth of
doctrine and faith, because he is in the opposite will, and the will
that is opposite to the good of love and the truth of doctrine is hell
in the measure of such opposition; consequently "thus must he be
killed," that is, perish, so far as he desires to hurt them. Moreover,
every man and spirit is under the Lord's protection, the evil as well as
the good; and to him who is under the Lord's protection no evil can
happen: for it is the Lord's will that no one should perish or be
punished. But so far as anyone is under the Lord's protection he
abstains from doing evil, but so far as he does not abstain he removes
himself from the Lord's protection, and so far as he so removes himself
he is hurt by the evil spirits who are from hell; for infernal spirits
have an unceasing desire to do evil to others; and so far as any are
outside of the Lord's Divine protection, that is, so far as they do
evil, they come into the power of those who do evil to them by
inflicting punishment and depriving them of such things as belong to
spiritual life. In a word, so far as anyone desires to hurt the goods of
love and the truths of doctrine he is "devoured by fire and is killed,"
that is, he is possessed by evils and the falsities of evil, and so far
he spiritually dies, and this comes to pass not from the Divine but from
the evil itself that he does.

<span class="margnote"><span id="644.">644.</span></span>

Verse 6. These have power to shut heaven that it rain no rain in the
days of their prophecy, signifies that those who reject the goods and
truths of heaven and the church that proceed from the Lord, receive no
influx out of heaven. This is evident from the signification of
"shutting heaven," as being lest any influx out of heaven be received
(of which presently); also from the signification of "rain," as being
truth fertilizing, which is truth from which there is good that flows
down out of heaven (of which also presently); also from the
signification of "their prophecy," as being prediction respecting the
Lord and His coming, and respecting the good of love to Him and the
truths of faith in Him. This revelation and the proclamation of this
revelation at the end of the church is what is chiefly meant by "the
days of the prophecy of the two witnesses." It is the Lord that is
chiefly proclaimed at the end of the church by "the two witnesses,"
because "the two witnesses," which are the good of love to the Lord and
the truth of faith in Him, are what chiefly bear witness of Him,
therefore it is afterwards said that: The testimony of Jesus is the
spirit of prophecy (Rev. 19:10). \[2\] "To shut heaven" means to prevent
the reception of any influx out of heaven, because it is added, "that it
rain no rain," which signifies influx of Divine truth out of heaven. For
it is well known that every good of love and every truth of faith flows
in out of heaven, that is, from the Lord through heaven, with man, and
that it flows in continually; from which it follows that neither the
good of love nor the truth of faith is in anywise man's, but is the
Lord's with him. These both flow insofar as evil and falsity do not
obstruct; it is these that shut heaven so that there is no influx; for
evil and good, and falsity and truth, are opposites, consequently where
the one is the other cannot be; for evil with man prevents the entrance
of good, and falsity the entrance of truth; while good causes evil to be
removed, and truth falsity; for these are opposites, as heaven and hell
are opposites; therefore the one acts against the other with an
unceasing endeavor to destroy, and the one that prevails destroys the
other. \[3\] Moreover, there are in every man two minds, an interior
which is called the spiritual mind, and another, the exterior which is
called the natural mind. The spiritual mind is created for the reception
of light from heaven, but the natural mind for the reception of light
from the world. The spiritual mind, therefore, which is man's interior
mind, is heaven with him, and the natural mind, which is man's exterior
mind, is the world with him. The interior mind, which is heaven with
man, is opened so far as man acknowledges the Divine of the Lord, and
man so far acknowledges this as he is in the good of love and charity
and in the truths of doctrine and faith. But this interior mind, which
is heaven with man, is unopened so far as man does not acknowledge the
Divine of the Lord, and does not live the life of love and faith; and
that mind is shut so far as man is in evils and in falsities therefrom;
and when it is shut then the natural mind with man becomes a hell; for
in the natural mind are evil and its falsity, consequently when the
spiritual mind which is heaven with man is shut, the natural mind which
is hell rules. From this it can be seen what is meant by "heaven is shut
that it rain no rain." \[4\] It is said that the two witnesses have
power "to shut heaven," but still these do not shut it, but the evil and
falsity shut it that rule with the men of the church at its end. This is
said of "the two witnesses," as was said above that "fire shall go forth
out of their mouth and shall devour their enemies," and yet no fire goes
forth from them and devours (as has been said in the two articles
above). "That it rain no rain" signifies no influx of Divine truth out
of heaven, because "water," which makes rain, signifies the truth of the
Word, and the truth of doctrine and faith therefrom (see above, n. 71,
483, 518, 537, 538); and as rain water descends out of the clouds in
heaven, so "to rain rain" signifies the influx of Divine truth from the
Lord in heaven, and as rain fertilizes the earth, so "rain" signifies
Divine truth fertilizing and making fruitful the church, for which
reason "rain" signifies also spiritual blessing. \[5\] That "rain" in
the Word does not mean rain, but the inflowing Divine, which causes
intelligence and wisdom, and also the good of love and the truth of
faith in man, to grow and become fruitful, and that "to rain" signifies
influx can be seen from the following passages. In Moses: My doctrine
shall flow down as the rain, My word shall distill as the dew, as the
drops on the grass, and as the showers on the herb (Deut. 32:2).
Doctrine is here compared to rain, because "rain" signifies the Divine
truth proceeding, from which is everything of doctrine; for all
comparisons in the Word are also from correspondences. Because "rain"
signifies the Divine truth flowing down it is said, "My doctrine shall
flow down as the rain." "Dew" signifies good, and since "word" has the
same signification, therefore it is said, "My word shall distill as the
dew." So intelligence and wisdom therefrom are signified by "the drops
on the grass," and by "the showers on the herbs," for as the grass and
herb of the field grow from the waters of the rain and dew, so do
intelligence and wisdom by the influx of Divine truth from the Lord.
This is first said by Moses, because in this chapter he is speaking of
the twelve tribes of Israel, which signify in the spiritual sense all
truths and goods of the church, and thus doctrine in the whole complex.
\[6\] In the same: The land which ye shall pass over to possess it is a
land of mountains and valleys, of the rain of heaven it drinketh waters.
And I will give the rain of your land in its time, the former rain and
the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy new wine,
and thine oil. But if ye shall serve other gods, and shall not walk in
my statutes, the anger of Jehovah shall glow against you; He will shut
heaven that there be no rain, and the land shall not yield her produce
(Deut. 11:11, 14, 16, 17). This describes the land of Canaan and its
fruitfulness; but as that land means in the spiritual sense the church,
it follows that all things of this description signify such things as
belong to the church, as "mountains," "valleys," "corn," "new wine,"
"oil," "produce," and "rain." "A land of mountains and valleys"
signifies the higher and lower, or internal and external things of the
church; the internal things of the church are with the internal man,
which is also called the spiritual man, and the external things of the
church are with the external man, which is called the natural man; that
both these are such as to receive the influx of Divine truth is
signified by "of the rain of heaven it drinketh waters." That Divine
truth inflows in both states, that is, when the man of the church is in
his spiritual state and when he is in his natural state, is signified by
"the rain given in its time, the former rain and the latter rain;" for
the man of the church is by turns in a spiritual state and in a natural
state, and the influx and reception of Divine truth in a spiritual state
is meant by "the former or morning rain," and in a natural state by "the
latter or evening rain;" spiritual and celestial good and truth which
the man of the church has therefrom is meant by the "corn," "new wine,"
and "oil," which they shall gather in; that the falsities of doctrine
and of worship will prevent the influx and reception of Divine truth,
and in consequence, the increase of spiritual life, is signified by "if
ye shall serve other gods there shall be no rain, and the land will not
yield her produce," "other gods" signifying the falsities of doctrine
and of worship. \[7\] In the same: If ye walk in My statutes and keep My
commandments and do them, the land shall yield its produce, and the tree
of the field shall yield its fruit (Lev. 26:3, 4). Here "the rain that
shall be given in its time, and the produce of the land," have a similar
signification as above; and as the church was at that time an external
church, representative of interior spiritual things, so when they walked
in the statutes, and kept the commandments and did them, it came about
that they had rain in its time, and the earth yielded its produce, and
the tree of the field its fruit; and yet the rain and the produce thence
were representative and significative, "rain" represented the Divine
flowing in, "the produce," the truth of doctrine and the understanding
of truth, and "the fruit of the tree," the good of love and the will of
good. \[8\] This can be seen from its being said: That the rain was
withheld, and consequently there was a famine in the land of Israel for
three years and a half, under Ahab, because they served other gods and
killed the prophets (1 Kings 17 and 18; Luke 4:25). This was a
representative, and thus a significative, that no Divine truth flowing
in out of heaven could be received because of the falsities of evil,
which were signified by "other gods" and by "Baal," whom they worshiped.
"Killing the prophets" signified also the destruction of the Divine, for
a "prophet" signifies in the Word the doctrine of truth from the Word.
\[9\] In Isaiah: I will lay waste My vineyard; it shall not be pruned
nor hoed, that the briar and the bramble may come up; and I will command
the clouds that they rain no rain upon it (Isa. 5:6). Here, too, it is
said of Jehovah that He layeth waste His vineyard, "and commandeth the
clouds that they rain no rain upon it;" and yet this is not done by
Jehovah, that is, the Lord, for He always flows in both with the evil
and with the good, which is meant by His "sending His rain upon the just
and upon the unjust" (Matt. 5:45); but the cause is with the man of the
church, that he does not receive any influx of Divine truth, for the man
who does not receive closes up with himself the interiors of his mind,
which receive; and when these are shut the inflowing Divine is rejected.
The "vineyard" which is laid waste signifies the church; "it is not
pruned nor hoed" signifies no ability to be cultivated and so prepared
to receive; "the briar and bramble" which shall come up signify the
falsities of evil; "to command the clouds that they rain no rain"
signifies that no influx of Divine truth from heaven is received. \[10\]
In Jeremiah: The showers have been withholden, and there hath been no
latter rain; and still the forehead of a harlot woman remained to thee,
thou didst refuse to be ashamed (Jer. 3:3). They said not in their
heart, Come, let us fear Jehovah our God; that giveth the rain, and the
former and the latter rain in its time. He keepeth unto us the weeks,
the stated times of harvest; your iniquities make these things to turn
away (Jer. 5:24, 25). In Amos: I have withholden the rain from you, when
there were yet three months to the harvest, so that I might cause it to
rain upon one city, and not cause it to rain upon another city; one
field received the rain, but the field upon which it did not rain dried
up; therefore two, three cities wandered unto one city to drink waters,
yet they were not satisfied; nevertheless ye have not returned unto Me
(Amos 4:7, 8). In Ezekiel: Son of man, say, thou art a land that is not
cleansed, that hath no rain in the day of anger; there is a conspiracy
of her prophets in the midst of her (Ezek. 22:24, 25). In Zechariah:
Whosoever of the families of the land shall not go up to Jerusalem to
worship Jehovah of Hosts, upon them there shall be no rain (Zech.
14:17). In these passages also "rain" signifies the reception of the
influx of Divine truth, which is the source of spiritual intelligence;
and that there is "no rain" signifies that no such intelligence is given
by any influx because of the evils and falsities that refuse to receive
and that reject it. \[11\] In Jeremiah: The nobles sent their little
ones for water; they came to the pits and found no waters, because the
land was broken, for there had been no rain upon the earth; the
husbandmen were ashamed, they covered up the head (Jer. 14:3, 4).
"Nobles" mean those who teach and lead, and "little ones" those who are
taught and led; "waters" signify the truths of doctrine; "pits in which
there are no waters" signify doctrinals in which there are no truths;
"there had been no rain upon the earth" signifies that no influx of
Divine truth is received by reason of the falsities in the church; "the
husbandmen were ashamed and covered up the head" signifies those who
teach, and their grief. \[12\] In Isaiah: Then Jehovah shall give rain
to thy seed with which thou sowest the land; and the bread of the
increase of the land, and it shall be fat and rich; thy cattle shall
feed in that day in a broad meadow (Isa. 30:23). This would be when the
Lord should come. The influx of Divine truth proceeding from Him is
signified by "the rain" which the Lord will then give to the seed,
"rain" meaning Divine influx, and "seed" the truth of the Word; "to sow
the land" signifies to plant and form the church in oneself; "the bread
of the increase which Jehovah will give" signifies the good of love and
charity, which is produced by the truths of the Word vivified by Divine
influx; "fat and rich" signifies full of the good of love and truths
therefrom, for "fat" is predicated of good, and "rich" of truths; "the
cattle shall feed in that day in a broad meadow" signifies the extension
and multiplication of good and truth by Divine influx, and consequent
spiritual nourishment, "cattle" meaning the goods and truths in man,
"that day" the Lord's coming, and "a broad meadow" the Word, through
which is Divine influx and spiritual nourishment; "breadth" is
predicated of the extension and multiplication of truth. \[13\] In the
same: As the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven, and returneth
not thither but irrigateth the earth, and maketh it to bring forth and
to bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so
shall My Word be that goeth forth out of My mouth; it shall not return
unto Me empty, but it shall do what I will, and it shall prosper in that
to which I sent it (Isa. 55:10, 11). Here "the Word" which goeth forth
out of the mouth of God is compared to the rain and snow from heaven,
because "the Word" means Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, which
with us flows in through the Word; "rain and snow coming down out of
heaven" have a similar meaning, "rain" signifying spiritual truth, which
has been appropriated to man, and "snow" natural truth, which is like
snow when it is in the memory only; but it is made spiritual by love, as
snow is made rain water by heat. "To irrigate the earth and to make it
to bring forth and to bud" signifies to vivify the church that it may
bring forth the truth of doctrine and of faith, and the good of love and
of charity; the truth of doctrine and of faith is signified by "the seed
that it gives to the sower," and the good of love and of charity by "the
bread that it gives to the eater;" "it shall not return to Me empty, but
it shall do what I will," signifies that it shall be received, and that
by it man shall be led to look to the Lord. \[14\] In Ezekiel: I will
give them and the circuits of My hill a blessing, and I will send down
the rain in its time, they shall be rains of blessing; then the tree of
the field shall give its fruit, and the land shall give its produce
(Ezek. 34:26, 27). "The circuits of the hill of Jehovah" mean all who
are in the truths of doctrine and thence in the good of charity; "to
send down the rain in its time" signifies the influx of Divine truth
adapted to the affection and will of the one receiving; and as the
fructification of good and the multiplication of truth are therefrom,
they are called "the rains of blessing," and it is said that "the tree
of the field shall give its fruit, and the land shall give its produce;"
"the tree of the field" and "the land" signifying the church and the man
of the church, and "the fruit of the tree of the field" the
fructification of good, and "the produce of the earth" the
multiplication of its truth. \[15\] In Joel: Rejoice, ye sons of Zion,
and be glad in Jehovah your God, for He shall give you the former rain
in righteousness, yea, He shall cause to come down for you the rain, the
former rain and the latter rain, in the first, that the floors may be
full of pure grain, and the vats overflow with new wine and oil (Joel
2:23, 24). "The sons of Zion" signify those who are in genuine truths
through which they have the good of love, for "Zion" signifies the
celestial church which is in the good of love to the Lord through
genuine truths. That the Lord with such flows in with the good of love,
and from that good into truths, is signified by "He shall give them the
former rain in righteousness;" "righteousness" is predicated in the Word
of the good of love, and "the righteous" mean those who are in that good
(see above, n. 204). That the Lord continually flows into truths with
the good of love is signified by "He shall cause to come down the former
rain and the latter rain, in the first;" that from this they have the
good of love towards a brother and companion is signified by "their
floors are full of pure grain;" and that from this they have the truth
and the good of love to the Lord is signified by "the vats overflow with
new wine and oil." Those who are of the Lord's celestial church have the
good of love towards a brother and companion; and this love, with those
who are of the Lord's spiritual church, is called charity towards the
neighbor. \[16\] In Zechariah: Ask of Jehovah the rain in its
time; <span id="fr_285"></span>[644-1](#fn_285.md) Jehovah will make mists
and will give to them the shower of rain, to a man the herb in the field
(Zech. 10:1). Here, too, "rain" signifies the influx of Divine truth
from the Lord, from which man has spiritual intelligence; "the shower of
rain" signifies Divine truth flowing in abundantly, and "to give the
herb in the field" signifies the knowledge of truth and good from the
Word and intelligence therefrom. \[17\] In David: Thou dost visit the
earth and gladden it, thou greatly enrichest it; the stream of God is
full of waters, thou preparest their grain, and so thou dost establish
it. Water its furrows; settle its ridges; dissolve it with showers;
bless its budding (Ps. 65:9, 10). The "earth" signifies here the church;
"the stream full of waters" signifies the doctrine full of truths; "to
water its furrows, to settle its ridges, and to dissolve it with
showers" signifies to fill with the knowledges of good and truth; "to
prepare grain" signifies everything that nourishes the soul; therefore
it is added, "so thou dost establish the earth," that is, the church;
"to bless the budding" signifies to produce continually anew and to
cause truths to spring forth. \[18\] In the same: O God, thou makest the
rain of good will to drop down (Ps. 68:9). In the same: He shall come
down like rain upon the herb of the meadow, like drops in the fissure of
the earth; in his days shall the righteous flourish (Ps. 72:6, 7). In
these passages "rain" does not mean rain, but the influx of Divine truth
with man, from which he has spiritual life. In Job: My word they will
not repeat, and my speech will drop upon them, and they will wait for me
as for the rain, and they will open their mouth for the latter rain (Job
29:22, 23). Evidently "rain" here means truth spoken by anyone, and
flowing into another, for "word," "speech," and "opening the mouth"
signify truth going forth from anyone by speech; this is why it is
called "rain," and "latter rain," and is said "to drop," which here
means to speak. \[19\] In Jeremiah: The Maker of the earth by His power
prepareth the world, by His wisdom and by His understanding He
stretcheth out the heavens; at the voice that He giveth forth there is a
multitude of waters in the heavens; and He maketh the vapors to go up
from the end of the earth; He maketh lightnings for the showers, and
bringeth forth the wind out of His treasuries (Jer. 10:12, 13; 51:16;
Ps. 135:7). "The world which the Maker of the earth prepares by His
power" signifies the church in the whole globe, "power" signifying the
potency of Divine truth; "the heavens which He stretcheth out by wisdom
and understanding" signify the church in the heavens corresponding to
the church on earth, "wisdom and understanding" signifying the Divine
proceeding, from which angels and men have the wisdom of good and the
understanding of truth, and "to stretch out" signifying the formation
and extension of the heavens in general, and the extension of
understanding and wisdom with everyone who receives; "at the voice that
He giveth forth there is a multitude of waters in the heavens" signifies
that from the Divine proceeding there are spiritual truths in
immeasurable abundance, "voice" signifying the Divine proceeding,
"waters" truths, and "multitude" abundance; "He maketh the vapors to go
up from the end of the earth" signifies truths in ultimates, such as the
truths of the Word are in the sense of the letter, in which are
spiritual truths, "the end of the earth" signifying the ultimates of the
church, "vapors" truths for those who are in ultimates, and "to make
them to go up" meaning to give spiritual truths from ultimates because
they are in ultimates, for spiritual truths are what especially make the
church fruitful; "He maketh lightning for the showers" signifies
enlightenment from influx of Divine truth with them; "and bringeth forth
the wind out of His treasuries" signifies spiritual things in the Word
from heaven. \[20\] In Luke: When ye see a cloud rising in the west
straightway it is said, There cometh a shower, and so it cometh to pass;
and when ye see the south wind blowing it is said, There will be a
scorching heat, and it cometh to pass. Ye hypocrites, ye know how to
discern the face of the earth and of heaven, how is it that ye do not
discern this time? (Luke 12:54-56) By this comparison the Lord teaches
that they see earthly things but not heavenly things; and the comparison
itself, like all other comparisons in the Word, is derived from
correspondences; for "a cloud rising in the west" signifies the Lord's
coming at the end of the church predicted in the Word, "cloud"
signifying the Word in the letter, "rising" the Lord's coming, and the
"west" the end of the church; "straightway it is said, There cometh a
shower" signifies that then there will be an influx of Divine truth;
"and when ye see the south wind blowing" signifies the proclamation of
His coming; "it is said, There will be a scorching heat" signifies that
then there will be an influx of Divine good. The same words signify also
contentions and combats of truth from good with falsities from evil,
"shower and scorching heat" signifying also such contentions and
combats; for this comparison follows the words of the Lord: That He came
not to give peace on the earth, but division, and that the father shall
be divided against the son, and the son against the father, the mother
against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother (Luke
12:51-53); and these words signify such contention and combat; that
"shower" also has this signification may be seen below. Because this
comparison, regarded in its spiritual sense, implies the coming of the
Lord, and because from blindness induced by falsities they did not
acknowledge Him, although they might have known Him from the Word, it
therefore follows: Ye hypocrites, ye know how to discern the face of the
earth and of heaven, but ye do not discern this time (verse 56); that
is, the time of His coming, and the conflict of the falsity of evil with
the truth of good that then took place. \[21\] In Hosea: Let us know,
and let us follow on to know Jehovah; His going forth is prepared as the
clouds; and He shall come to us as the rain, as the latter rain that
irrigateth the earth (Hos. 6:3). This is said of the Lord and His
coming; and as all Divine truth proceeds from Him, from which angels and
men have life and salvation, it is said "He shall come to us as the
rain, as the latter rain that irrigateth the earth," "to irrigate the
earth" signifying to render fertile the church, which is said to be
rendered fertile when truths are multiplied and thence intelligence
increases, and when goods are made fruitful, and thence celestial love
increases. \[22\] In the second book of Samuel: The rock of Israel spake
to me; as the light of morning the sun riseth, of a morning without
clouds; from the brightness after rain there is grass out of the earth
(2 Sam. 23:3, 4). This is said of the Lord, who from the Divine truth
that proceeds from Him is called "the Rock of Israel." That Divine truth
proceeds from His Divine good is meant by "as the light of the morning
the sun riseth." There is a comparison with light because "light"
signifies the Divine truth proceeding, and with the morning because
"morning" signifies the Divine good, and with the rising sun because
"rising" and the "sun" signify the Divine love; that these are without
obscurity is signified by "the light of a morning without clouds;" the
enlightenment of the man of the church by the reception and after the
reception of Divine truth from the Lord's Divine good is signified by
"from the brightness after rain," "brightness" signifying enlightenment,
and "rain" influx and consequent reception. That those who are of the
church have therefrom knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom, is signified
by "the grass out of the earth," "grass," like "pasture," signifying
spiritual nourishment, and thence knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom,
which are spiritual food, and the "earth" signifying the church and the
man of the church. \[23\] In Matthew: Love your enemies, bless <span
id="fr_286"></span>[644-2](#fn_286.md) them that curse you, bless them that
hate you, and pray for them that hurt and persecute you; that ye may be
sons of your Father who is in the heavens; who maketh His sun to rise on
the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust
(Matt. 5:44, 45). Here first charity towards the neighbor, which is to
wish good and do good even to enemies, is described by "loving them,
blessing them, and praying for them," for genuine charity regards only
the good of another. Here "to love" signifies charity, "to bless"
instruction, and "to pray" intercession, and for the reason that
inwardly in charity there is the end to do good. That this is the Divine
itself with man, such as it is with regenerate men, is signified by
"that ye may be sons of your Father in the heavens," "Father in the
heavens" means the Divine proceeding, for all who receive this are
called "sons of the Father," that is, of the Lord; "the sun that He
maketh to rise on the evil and on the good" signifies the Divine good
flowing in; and "the rain that He sendeth on the just and on the unjust"
signifies the Divine truth flowing in; for the Divine proceeding which
is "the Father in the heavens," flows in with the evil equally as with
the good, but the reception of it must be on man's part, yet not on
man's part as from man, but as if from man, for the ability to receive
is given to man continually, and it also flows in to the extent that man
removes the evils that oppose, and does this also from the ability that
is continually given, the ability itself appearing to be man's, although
it is of the Lord. \[24\] From this it can now be seen that "rain"
signifies in the Word the influx of the Divine truth from the Lord, from
which man has spiritual life, and this because "waters," of which rain
consists, signify the truth of doctrine and the truth of faith. But as
"waters," in the contrary sense, signify the falsities of doctrine and
of faith, so "showers of rain" or "a shower," as well as "inundations of
waters" and a "flood," signify not only falsities destroying truths, but
also temptations in which man either yields or conquers. This is the
signification of shower \[imber\] in Matthew: Everyone that heareth My
words and doeth them I will liken to a prudent man who built his house
upon a rock; and the shower descended, and the rivers came, and the
winds blew, and beat upon that house, yet it fell not. But everyone that
heareth My words and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man
who built his house upon the sand; and the shower descended, and the
rivers came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell,
and great was the fall of it (Matt. 7:24-27). Here "shower" and "rivers"
mean temptations, in which man conquers or in which he yields; "waters"
mean the falsities that usually inflow in temptations; and "rivers,"
which here are inundations of water from a shower, signify temptations;
"the winds that blow and beat" signify the thoughts that arise
therefrom, for temptations arise through the breaking in of falsities
injected by evil spirits into the thoughts. The "house" they beat upon
signifies man, strictly his mind, which consists of understanding or
thought and of will or affection; he that receives the words of the
Lord, that is, Divine truths, in one part of the mind only, which is
that of the thought or understanding, and not at the same time in the
other part, which is that of the affection or will, yields in
temptations, and falls into grievous falsities, which are the falsities
of evil; therefore it is said, "great was the fall of it;" but he who
receives Divine truths in both parts, that is, both in the understanding
and in the will, conquers in temptations. The "rock" upon which that
house is founded signifies the Lord as to Divine truth, or Divine truth
received by the soul and heart, that is, by faith and love, in other
words, by the understanding and will; while the "sand" signifies Divine
truth received only in the memory, and somewhat therefrom in the
thought, and thus in a scattered and disconnected way, because
intermixed with falsities, and falsified by notions. This makes clear
what is meant by "hearing the words and not doing them." That this is
the sense of these words can be seen more clearly from what precedes
them. \[25\] An "overflowing rain" or "shower" signifies an inundation
of falsities also in Ezekiel: Say unto them that daub on what is unfit
that it shall fall, because an overflowing rain, because <span
id="fr_287"></span>[644-3](#fn_287.md) ye, O hailstones, shall fall, and a
wind of tempests shall break through. Thus said the Lord Jehovih, I will
make a wind of tempest to break through in My wrath, and an overflowing
rain in Mine anger, and hailstones in wrath for a consummation, and I
will throw down the wall that ye have daubed with what is unfit (Ezek.
13:11, 13, 14). "Daubing with what is unfit" signifies the confirmation
of falsity by fallacies, whereby falsity appears as truth; "hailstones"
signify truths without good, thus without any spiritual life, which are
all inwardly falsities, for ideas that are dead cause them to be merely
shells, and like pictures in which there is nothing living; such truths
merely known belong to the natural man, into which nothing from the
spiritual flows. "The overflowing rain and the wind of tempests" signify
falsities rushing in copiously, and things imaginary, and disputes about
truths, which make it impossible for anything of truth to be seen, and
which thus destroy man. \[26\] In the same: I will plead with Gog with
pestilence and with blood, and I will rain an overflowing rain and
hailstones, fire and brimstone, upon him and upon his troops, and upon
the many people who are with him (Ezek. 38:22). "Gog" means such as are
in external worship without any internal worship; and as such worship
consists of what are like shells, the kernels of which are either rotten
or have been eaten out by worms, these things are called "overflowing
rain and hailstones," which signify falsities rushing in copiously and
things imaginary which destroy man. The evils of falsity and the
falsities of evil are signified by "fire and brimstone." \[27\] The
"flood of waters," of which it is said: That it overflowed the whole
earth and destroyed all except Noah and his sons (Gen. 7, 8), also
signifies the flood of falsities by which the Most Ancient Church was
finally destroyed; "Noah and his sons" signify a New Church, which is to
be called the Ancient Church, and the establishment of that church after
the Most Ancient Church had been devastated. (But the particulars of the
description in these chapters of the flood and of the salvation of the
family of Noah, may be seen explained in the Arcana Coelestia. That
"waters" signify truths, and in the contrary sense, falsities, may be
seen above, n. 71, 483, 518, 537, 538; and that "the overflowings of
waters" signify the overflowings of falsities and temptations, see also
above, n. 518.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="645.">645.</span></span>

And they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, signifies
that truths with such are turned into falsities from evil. This is
evident from the signification of "having power" when "the olive trees
and lampstands" are referred to, as signifying the goods of love and the
truths of doctrine; not that these themselves have such power, namely,
to turn truths into falsities, since this is contrary to their nature,
which is to turn falsities into truths, for good acts with them and not
evil, and yet they appear to have this power and appear to do this,
because this occurs when they are hurt; but it is the evil that is from
hell, or hell from which all evil comes, that "turns waters into blood,"
that is, truths into falsities from evil. The above is evident also from
the signification of "waters," as being truths (of which above, n. 71,
483, 518, 537, 538); also from the signification of "blood," as being
the truth of the Word, and thence of doctrine from the Word, and in the
contrary sense falsity, in particular the truth of the Word falsified,
for "to shed blood" signifies to do violence to charity, and also to
Divine truth which is in the Word. (But as to the signification of
"blood" in both senses, see above, n. 329.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="646.">646.</span></span>

And to smite the earth with every plague, signifies that the church with
such is destroyed by the lusts of evil. This is evident from the
signification of "earth," as being the church (of which often above);
also from the signification of "plague," as being such things as destroy
the spiritual life and thus the church, which in brief have reference to
the lusts of the love of self and the world, thus to the lusts of evil
(see also above, n. 584); therefore "to turn waters into blood"
signifies that goods are turned into evils, and thence truths into
falsities with those who wish to hurt and do harm to the "two
witnesses," that is, to the goods and truths of heaven and the church
which are what acknowledge and confess the Lord. \[2\] That this is done
anyone can see and conclude from this, that every good of love and truth
of faith is from the Lord, and that those who do not acknowledge and
confess the Lord are unable to receive any good of love or truth of
faith; for by non-acknowledgment and denial they shut heaven to
themselves, that is, they reject all the influx of good and truth from
heaven, or through heaven from the Lord; consequently they are in what
is their own \[suum proprium\], which regarded in itself is nothing but
evil and falsity therefrom; and for this reason, because they think and
will from what is their own \[proprium\], that is, from self, they are
unable to think or to will anything that does not flow forth from the
love of self and the love of the world, and from the lusts of those
loves, thus are unable to think or will anything whatever that is from
love to the Lord or from love towards the neighbor; and those who will
and think from the loves of self and of the world and their lusts only
are unable to will anything but evils or think anything but falsities.
That this is so can be seen and concluded by anyone who knows that all
good and truth is from the Lord, and all evil and falsity is from what
is man's own \[proprium\]. \[3\] It is to be known that, so far as man
acknowledges the Lord and lives according to His commandments, he is
elevated above what is his own \[proprium\]; which elevation is out of
the light of the world into the light of heaven. So long as man lives in
the world he does not know that he is raised up above what is his own
\[proprium\], because he does not feel it, and yet there is an elevation
or as it were a drawing of man's interior understanding and interior
will towards the Lord, and thus a turning of man's face in respect to
his spirit towards the Lord. After death this is made clear to the good
man, for then there is a constant turning of his face to the Lord, and
as it were a drawing towards Him as to a common center (of this turning
see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 17, 123, 142-145, 253, 272, 552,
561). \[4\] But since it is according to Divine order that where there
is a drawing there must be an impelling force, for without this there
can be no drawing, so it is according to Divine order that there be with
man an impelling force; and although this is from the Lord, yet it
appears as if it were from man, and the appearance causes it to be as if
it were man's. This impelling force as if from man, corresponding to the
drawing that is from the Lord, is acknowledgment, thus reception from
acknowledgment and confession of the Lord and from a life according to
His commandments. There must be this on man's part and from his life's
freedom, and yet man must acknowledge that even this is from the Lord,
although from the obscurity of perception in which man is he has no
other feeling than that it is as if from himself. These things are said
to make known that a man who denies the Lord cannot be in anything but
evils and in falsities therefrom, because he cannot be drawn away from
what is his own \[proprium\], that is, be elevated above it; neither can
he be influenced by any drawing from the Lord, and consequent turning of
the interiors of his mind towards the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="647.">647.</span></span>

As often as they will, signifies as often as a man assaults the goods of
love and the truths of doctrine that bear witness of the Lord, and from
which man acknowledges and confesses the Lord, that he may inflict evil
upon them. This is evident from the signification of "as often as they
will," when it is said of "the two witnesses" (by whom are meant those
who acknowledge and confess the Lord), for these do not will and do the
evils that have been mentioned heretofore, but the evil inflict these
evils upon themselves when they assault the goods and truths that
proceed from the Lord that they may inflict injury upon them. In the
sense of the letter of the Word it is indeed said of Jehovah God, that
is, the Lord, that He is angry, and wrathful, that He is furious against
the good, <span id="fr_288"></span>[647-1](#fn_288.md) and that He does
evil to them, yea, that He wills to do so; and yet the Lord is never
angry or wrathful, nor does He will or do evil to anyone; for into every
man the Lord flows in from good with good, and from truth with truths
from good; for He wills to bring all to Himself and to save them. This
makes clear that "as often as the witnesses will" does not mean as often
as they will, but as often as the evil will, that is, from willing do
evil, in other words, assault the goods and truths of heaven and the
church that are from the Lord that they may inflict injury upon them.
\[2\] That the Lord, and thus the good of love and the truth of faith
that are of the Lord with man and angel, will no evil to anyone can be
seen from this, that the Lord God is not the cause of evil with anyone,
and he who is not the cause of evil is not the cause of punishment, but
the evil itself that is with man is the cause. In the spiritual world
where heaven and hell are, all things are so arranged that the Lord
never casts anyone down into hell, but the evil spirit casts himself
down (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 545-550); and this because
the Lord is not the cause of evil, and he who is not the cause of evil
cannot be the cause of any effect that springs from evil. From this it
is clear that the contents of this verse, namely, that the two witnesses
"have power to shut heaven that it rain no rain," and that "they have
power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth
with every plague as often as they will," are not to be understood
according to the sense of the letter, but according to the spiritual
sense, which is, that those who do evil to the "two witnesses" bring
such things upon themselves; for so far as anyone does evil to them so
far he shuts heaven against himself, and turns truths with himself into
falsities, and destroys himself by the lusts of evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="648.">648.</span></span>

Verses 7, 8. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the
beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and
overcome them and kill them. And their bodies shall be upon the street
of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where
also our Lord was crucified. 7. "And when they shall have finished their
testimony," signifies in the end of the church, when the Divine of the
Lord is no longer acknowledged, and thence there is no longer any good
of love or truth of doctrine (n. 649); "the beast that cometh up out of
the abyss shall make war with them," signifies assault from infernal
love (n. 650); "and shall overcome them and kill them" signifies the
consequent destruction of every good and truth of the church (n. 651).
8. "And their bodies shall be upon the street of the great city,"
signifies their extinction by the evils and falsities of doctrine (n.
652); "which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt," signifies through
the evils of the love of self, and the falsities therefrom (n. 653,
654); "where also our Lord was crucified," signifies by which, namely,
by evils and falsities therefrom springing from infernal love, the Lord
was rejected and condemned (n. 655).

<span class="margnote"><span id="649.">649.</span></span>

Verse 7. And when they shall have finished their testimony, signifies in
the end of the church, when the Divine of the Lord is no longer
acknowledged, and thence there is no longer any good of love or truth of
doctrine. This is evident from the signification of "testimony," as
being the acknowledgment of the Divine in the Lord, and thence of the
good of love and truth of doctrine (of which presently), and from the
signification of "to finish it," as being to bring to an end; and as
this comes to an end at the end of the church; "to finish" here
signifies the end of the church; and as there is then no longer any
acknowledgment of the Divine in the Lord, there is therefore no good of
love or truth of doctrine. \[2\] That this is the signification of
"testimony," can be seen from what has been thus far said about "the two
witnesses," namely, that by them the good of love and charity and the
truth of doctrine and faith are meant, because these are what especially
testify concerning the Lord, for they are from the Lord, and are His
with man; therefore "their testimony" signifies preaching concerning
these. That "testimony" here signifies the acknowledgment of the Divine
in the Lord is evident from what follows in Revelation: That the
testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy (Rev. 19:10). For unless a
man acknowledges this from the heart, and believes it from spiritual
faith, he can have no ability to receive the good of love or the truth
of doctrine. \[3\] At the end of the church indeed the Lord is preached,
and from doctrine a Divine is also attributed to Him like the Divine of
the Father; yet scarcely anyone thinks of His Divine, for the reason
that they place it above or outside of His Human; therefore they do not
look to the Lord when they look to His Divine, but to the Father as to
another, and yet the Divine that is called the Father is in the Lord, as
He Himself teaches in John 10:30, 38; 14:7. For this reason men think of
the Lord in the same way as they think of a common man, and from that
thought their faith flows, however much they may say with the lips that
they believe in His Divine. Let anyone explore, if he can, the idea of
his thought about the Lord, whether it be not such. But when it is such
man cannot be conjoined to the Lord by faith and love, nor through
conjunction receive any good of love or truth of faith. This, then, is
why there is at the end of the church no acknowledgment of the Lord,
that is, of the Divine in the Lord and from the Lord. It is believed
that there is an acknowledgment of the Divine of the Lord, because such
is the doctrine of the church; but so long as His Divine is separated
from His Human, His Divine is yet not acknowledged interiorly but only
exteriorly, and to acknowledge exteriorly is to acknowledge with the
mouth only and not with the heart, or in speech only and not in faith.
\[4\] That this is so can be seen from Christians in the other life,
where the thoughts of the heart are manifested. When they are permitted
to speak from doctrine and from what they have heard from preaching they
attribute a Divine to the Lord, and call it their belief; but when their
interior thought and faith are explored they have no other idea of the
Lord than as of a common man who has no Divine. It is man's interior
thought that is the source of his faith; and as such is the thought and
consequent faith of man's spirit, there is plainly no acknowledgment of
the Divine in the Lord and from the Lord in the Christian world at the
end of the church. In other words, there is an external acknowledgment
of the Divine of the Lord, but no internal, and an external
acknowledgment is of the natural man alone, while internal
acknowledgment is of his very spirit; and after death the external
acknowledgment is put to sleep, while the internal is the acknowledgment
of his spirit. From this it can in some measure be seen how what follows
is to be understood, namely, "the beast that cometh up out of the abyss
shall overcome and kill the two witnesses," and their "bodies shall be
seen upon the street of the city that is called Sodom and Egypt," and
afterwards that "the spirit of life entered into them."

<span class="margnote"><span id="650.">650.</span></span>

The beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them,
signifies assault from infernal love. This is evident from the
signification of "beast," as being the affection of the natural man in
both senses (of which presently); also from the signification of "the
abyss," as being hell (of which above, n. 538); also from the
signification of "to make war," as being to assault, for by "wars," in
the Word, such wars as are in our world are not meant, but such as are
in the spiritual world, all of which are combats of falsities from evil
against truths from good; that such is the signification of "wars" in
the Word will appear in what follows, where wars are again mentioned.
From this it can be seen that "the beast that cometh up out of the abyss
shall make war with them," that is, the witnesses, signifies that
infernal love from the falsities of evil shall assault the truths of
good. \[2\] It has been shown before that a "beast" signifies a love or
affection of the natural man; let something now be said about assault.
Infernal love is especially the love of self, for the love of self is
the love of what is man's own \[proprium\], and what is man's own is
nothing but evil; consequently so far as a man is in that love he is
against the Lord, and thus against the good of love and charity, and
against the truth of doctrine and faith, thus against these "two
witnesses;" for this reason, the hells where the love of self reigns are
more direful and malignant than others, and are directly opposed to the
Lord, and thence unceasingly assault the goods of love and faith,
because these are from the Lord alone, and are the Lord with man and
angel. That these hells are more direful than the others can be seen
from this, that they continually breathe forth the destruction of those
who confess the Divine of the Lord, therefore of those who are in the
good of love and the good of faith in the Lord from the Lord. \[3\]
These hells are more malignant than the rest because so far as man is in
the love of self, and at the same time in the love of self-intelligence,
his natural lumen is in a kind of brightness, as it were, for the love
of self is like a fire that kindles that lumen; it is from this that men
can ingeniously think and reason against the Divine and against all
things of heaven and the church. I have sometimes been astonished when I
have listened to such, and have thought that they above all others were
capable of being led to receive faith, but I perceived that this was
impossible, for so far as they were enlightened in corporeal, worldly,
and natural things they were in thick darkness in respect to celestial
and spiritual things. This thick darkness was seen to be exceedingly
dusky, with something fiery intermixed. This I could confirm by much
experience, if this were the place for describing experiences. The love
of self is what is here meant in particular by "the beast coming up out
of the abyss," which made war with the two witnesses and killed them.
\[4\] That a "beast" signifies the love and affection of the natural man
in both senses can be seen from very many passages in the Word; and this
has heretofore been unknown, and as it may seem strange that "beasts"
should signify the love or affection of the natural man, it is necessary
to confirm this from the Word. Natural affections are signified by
"beasts" because these affections are altogether similar to the
affections of beasts, consequently a man who <span
id="fr_289"></span>[650-1](#fn_289.md) is not imbued with spiritual
affections through the goods and truths of heaven differs little from
beasts. For man has above the beasts the superadded faculty to think and
thence to will spiritually, which gives him the eminent faculty to see
and perceive abstract things; but if this spiritual faculty is not
vivified by the knowledges of truth and good, and afterwards by faith
and the life of faith, he is no better than the beasts, except merely
that by virtue of that higher faculty he is able to think and speak.
\[5\] Because the affections of the natural man are signified by
"beasts," when those affections are presented to be seen in the
spiritual world in forms like those animals, they appear altogether as
the forms of various beasts; as for instance, lambs, sheep, she-goats,
kids, he-goats, young cattle, oxen, cows; also as camels, horses, mules,
asses; and also as bears, tigers, leopards, lions; likewise as dogs and
serpents of various kinds. But such things are only appearances of the
affections that are with spirits; and when these are made apparent it is
also known there not only that the appearances are from these
affections, but also from whom they are; but as soon as the affections
with such cease, these appearances also cease. From this it can also be
seen why "beasts" are so often mentioned in the Word. \[6\] But let us
proceed to the confirmations from the Word. In David: Thou madest him to
have dominion over the works of Thy hands. Thou hast put all things
under His feet, the flock and herds, yea, the beasts of the fields, the
bird of heaven, and the fishes of the sea (Ps. 8:6-8). This whole psalm
treats of the Lord and His dominion over all things of heaven and the
church; the things of heaven and the church are meant here and elsewhere
in the Word by "the works of the hands of Jehovah;" and as it is over
these things that the Lord has dominion, and as spiritual things in the
Word are expressed by natural things, for the Word in its bosom is
spiritual, so by "flock," "herds," "the beasts of the field," "the birds
of heaven," and "the fishes of the sea," these are not meant, but the
spiritual things of heaven and the church. "Flock and herds" signify
spiritual things and natural things that are from a spiritual origin, a
"flock," that is, lambs, kids, she-goats, sheep, and rams, signifying
spiritual things, and "herds," which are bullocks, oxen, cows, and
camels, natural things from spiritual things; "beasts of the field"
signify the affections of the natural man, "birds of the heavens"
thoughts therefrom, and "fishes of the sea," the knowledges
\[scientifica\] of the sensual-natural man. Except for this meaning, why
should the Lord's dominion over these be described? \[7\] In the same: O
God, Thou makest the rain of good will to drop down; Thou shalt
strengthen Thine inheritance when it is weary; Thy wild beast (Thy
congregation) shall dwell in it (Ps. 68:9, 10). Here evidently "wild
beast" stands for a people that receives the influx of Divine truth from
the Lord, for of God's "inheritance," which signifies the church, it is
said, "Thy wild beast (Thy congregation) shall dwell in it;" "the rain
of good will" signifies the influx of Divine truth from Divine clemency.
\[8\] In the same: Jehovah, who sendeth forth springs into the brooks;
they run between the mountains, they give drink to every wild beast; the
wild asses quench their thirst, by them the bird of the heavens dwells,
from among the boughs they give forth their voice; who causeth the grass
to spring forth for the beast, and the herb for the service of man, that
he may bring forth bread out of the earth. Thou appointest the darkness
that there may be night, in which every wild beast of the forest goeth
forth. The sea great and wide in spaces, wherein is the creeping thing
without number, the wild beasts, the small with the great (Ps.
104:10-12, 14, 20, 25). This, too, is said of the Lord, and these words
describe the establishment of the church among the nations; therefore
"wild beasts," "beasts," and "birds" signify such things as are with the
man of the church. \[9\] It is to be known that in many passages
sometimes it is said "beast," and sometimes "wild beast," also that the
term "wild beast" is not to be understood as it is commonly understood,
for in the Hebrew "wild beast" \[fera\] is derived from a word that
means life, therefore in some passages "animal" would be a better
rendering than "wild beast," as can be seen from this, that the four
animals that were seen as cherubim and that signify Divine Providence
and protection in Ezekiel (chaps. 1, 10) are called "animals" \[ferae\];
likewise the cherubim are meant by "the four animals about the throne"
which are described by John in Revelation. Nevertheless, in the Word
"beast" and "wild beast" are carefully distinguished, "beasts"
signifying the affections of the natural man that belong to man's will,
and "wild beasts" the affections of the natural man that belong to man's
understanding. As in the Hebrew "wild beast" is derived from a word that
means life, Eve the wife of Adam had her name from the same word. This
is said that it may be known what "wild beast" and "beast" signify in
the proper sense. \[10\] What is signified by "Jehovah sendeth forth
springs into the brooks, to run between the mountains, and give drink to
every wild beast of the fields, the wild asses quench their thirst, and
by them the bird of the heavens dwells," has been explained above (n.
483). "Jehovah causeth the grass to spring forth for the beast, and the
herb for the service of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the
earth," signifies the instruction and nourishment of the natural and
spiritual man by truths from the Word, that he may have thereby the good
of love and charity; "grass" signifies the truth of the natural man,
which is true knowledge (see above, n. 507); "beast" signifies affection
for it which wishes to be instructed and spiritually nourished; "herb"
signifies the truth of the spiritual man; "man" signifies intelligence
therefrom and "bread" signifies the good of love and charity, which is
nourished by truths. As "darkness" and "night" signify the lumen of the
natural man, which compared to the light of the spiritual man is like
night, "the wild beast of the forest" signifies the affection of
knowledges, "the sea great and wide in spaces" the natural itself, "the
creeping thing without number" knowledge therein, and "the wild beasts
great and small" the various affections, it is evident what is signified
by "Thou appointest the darkness that there may be night, in which every
wild beast of the forest goeth forth; the sea great and wide in its
spaces, wherein is the creeping thing without number, wild beasts the
small with the great." \[11\] In the same: They shall sow fields and
plant vineyards, and make fruit of increase, and He shall bless them so
that they may be multiplied exceedingly; and He shall not diminish their
beast; yet are they diminished and bowed down because of the vehemence
of wickedness and grief (Ps. 107:37-39). This entire psalm treats of the
Lord's coming and of redemption by Him; that they will then have truths,
by which the church will be implanted in them, is signified by "They
shall sow fields and plant vineyards;" that in consequence they will
have the goods of the church, and thence truths will increase, is
signified by "shall make fruit of increase," and by "Jehovah shall bless
them so that they shall be multiplied exceedingly;" that then every good
affection of the natural man will remain with them is signified by "He
shall not diminish their beast;" that otherwise these affections would
not be destroyed by evils is signified by "they are diminished and bowed
down because of the vehemence of wickedness and grief." \[12\] In the
same: Praise Jehovah, ye whales and all deeps, wild beast and every
beast, creeping thing and every bird of wing (Ps. 148:7, 10). In this
psalm very many things in the world that have no life, but that shall
praise Jehovah, are enumerated, as "fire," "hail," "snow," "vapor," "the
wind of tempest," "mountains," "hills," "trees," "fruits," "cedars," as
also here, "wild beasts," "beasts," "creeping things," and "birds,"
which nevertheless cannot praise Jehovah. Who cannot see that the
enumeration of such things in the Divine Word would be wholly unmeaning
unless they signified something with man that can praise, that is,
worship Jehovah? From a knowledge of correspondences it is known that
"whales" signify the knowledges of the natural man in general, "deeps"
and "seas" the natural itself where the knowledges are, "wild beast" and
"beasts," the affections of the natural man as well those which belong
to his understanding as those of his will, "the creeping things" the
sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural man, and "birds of wing"
the thinking faculty therefrom. \[13\] In the same: Jehovah who
prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to spring forth upon the
mountains, who giveth to the beast his food, to the sons of the raven
which call (Ps. 147:8, 9). These particulars too, signify the spiritual
things belonging to heaven and the church. Why else should the Word
(which is given solely to teach man the way to heaven, by teaching him
the truths of faith and the goods of love), speak of Jehovah as
"preparing rain for the earth, making grass to spring forth upon the
mountains, giving to the beast his food, and to the sons of the raven
which call upon Him?" These things, however, are worthy of the Divine
Word, when by "rain" the influx of Divine truth is meant, by "mountains"
the good of love, by "making grass to spring forth" the instruction of
the natural man by the knowledges from the Word, by "beasts" the
affections of the natural man, which desire to be thus nourished. "To
give food" signifies nourishment; and since "the sons of the raven"
signify natural men who are in an obscure lumen from fallacies
respecting Divine truths, as were many of the nations, it is said "He
giveth to the sons of the raven which call," for such can call upon
Jehovah, but not the sons of a raven. \[14\] In the same: Every wild
beast of the forest is Mine, the beasts upon a thousand mountains. I
know every bird of the mountains, and the wild beast of My fields is
with Me (Ps. 50:10, 11). This is said of sacrifices, that the Lord does
not delight in them, but in the confession of heart and calling upon
Him; yet "the wild beast of the forest," "the beasts upon the
mountains," and "the bird of the mountains," and "the wild beast of the
fields," have a similar signification as above, namely, things
pertaining to the man of the church. \[15\] In the same: Thy
righteousness is like the mountains of God, Thy judgments are a great
deep; O Jehovah, Thou preservest man and beast (Ps. 36:6). "Man and
beast" signify interior affection, which is spiritual, from which is
intelligence, and exterior affection, which is natural, from which is
knowledge \[scientia\] corresponding to intelligence. \[16\] "Man and
beast" have a like signification in the following passages. In Jeremiah:
The God of Israel said, I have made the earth, the man and the beast
that are upon the faces of the earth, by My great power (Jer. 27:5;
36:29). In the same: Behold the days shall come in which I will sow the
house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast (Jer.
31:27). In the same: Yet again in this place, concerning which ye say,
It is devastated so that there is no man nor beast, and in the cities of
Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem that are devastated, so that there
is no man, and no inhabitant, and no beast, there shall be heard the
voice of joy and the voice of gladness (Jer. 33:10-12). In the same: The
whole land shall be a desolation, so that there shall not be man or
beast (Jer. 32:43). In the same: I will smite the inhabitants of this
city, both man and beast; they shall die of a great pestilence (Jer.
21:6). In the same: A nation from the north cometh up against Babylon;
this shall make her land a desolation, so that none shall dwell therein;
from man even to beast they are dispersed, they have gone away (Jer.
50:3). In the same: My anger and My wrath is poured out upon this place,
upon man and upon beast (Jer. 7:20). In Ezekiel: When the land shall sin
against Me, I will break its staff of bread and I will send into it
famine, and I will cut off from it man and beast (Ezek. 14:13, 17, 19).
In the same: I will stretch out My hand over Edom and will cut off from
it man and beast (Ezek. 25:13). In the same: I will destroy every beast
of Egypt over many waters, so that the foot of man shall trouble them no
more, nor shall the hoof of beast trouble them (Ezek. 32:13). In the
same: I will multiply upon you man and beast, that they may increase and
be fruitful (Ezek. 36:11). In Zephaniah: In consuming I will consume all
things from upon the faces of the land. I will consume man and beast, I
will consume the bird of the heavens and the fishes of the sea, and the
stumbling-blocks with the wicked, and I will cut off man from the faces
of the earth (Zeph. 1:2, 3). In Zechariah: The angel who came to measure
Jerusalem said, Run, speak, saying, Jerusalem shall inhabit the suburbs,
by reason of the multitude of man and of the beast in the midst of it
(Zech. 2:3, 4). Let your hands be strong, for the temple shall be built;
for before those days there was no price for man nor any price for
beast, for to him that went out and to him that came in there was no
peace from the enemy (Zech. 8:9, 10). \[17\] In these passages "man and
beast" <span id="fr_290"></span>[650-2](#fn_290.md) signifies what is
interior or spiritual, and "beast" what is exterior or natural; and
therefore "man" signifies the spiritual affection of truth, from which
is all intelligence, and "beast" the natural affection corresponding to
the spiritual. What is exterior or natural is signified by "beast,"
because man, in respect to his external or natural man is nothing but a
beast; for he enjoys like desires and also pleasures, appetites and
senses, so that in these respects man is entirely similar to the beast;
therefore the natural man may be called the animal man. But what is
internal or spiritual is signified by "man," because it is in respect to
his internal or spiritual that man is man; this enjoys the affections of
good and truth such as are with the angels of heaven, also because by
means of this with him man rules his natural or animal man, which is a
beast. \[18\] Because the spiritual man and the natural man are
signified by "man and beast" in the history of creation (Gen. 1), it is
related that the beasts and also man were created on the same day,
namely, the sixth; and afterwards, that to man was given dominion over
the beasts. Of the creation of the beasts and man on the same day, and
of man's dominion over the beasts, we thus read in Genesis: God said,
Let the earth bring forth the living soul according to its kind, and
what moveth itself, and the wild beast of the earth according to its
kind; and it was so. And God made the wild beast of the earth according
to its kind, and the beast according to its kind, and everything that
creepeth upon the ground according to its kind. And God said, Let us
make man in our image, after our likeness; and they shall have dominion
over the fishes of the sea, and over the bird of the heavens, and over
the beast, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth. And there was evening and there was morning,
the third <span id="fr_291"></span>[650-3](#fn_291) day (Gen. 1:24-31.md).
In the spiritual sense of this chapter, by "the creation of heaven and
earth" the new creation or regeneration of the man of the Most Ancient
Church is described; for this reason "beast" here signifies the external
or natural man, and "man" the internal spiritual, and "dominion over the
beasts" here means the dominion of the spiritual man over the natural.
\[19\] That it was granted to the man of that church to know all the
affections of the natural man, in order that he might have dominion over
them, is signified by these words in Genesis: Out of the ground Jehovah
God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens, and
brought unto the man, to see what he would call it; and whatsoever man
called it, the living soul, that was its name; and the man called the
names to every beast, and to the bird of the heavens, and to every wild
beast of the field (Gen. 2:19, 20). "To call the name" signifies in the
spiritual sense to know the quality of a thing, or what it is, so here
to know the qualities of all the affections, desires, pleasures,
appetites, also the thoughts and inclinations of the natural man, and
how they agree and correspond to the affections and perceptions of the
spiritual man. For it was granted to the spiritual man from creation to
see all things of the natural man, and at the same time to perceive its
agreement or disagreement with the spiritual, in order that he might
rule the natural and accept such things as agree and reject those that
disagree, and thus might become spiritual even as to effects, which are
wrought by means of the natural man. (But this may be seen more fully
explained in Arcana Coelestia, n. 142-146.) \[20\] Because "man" in the
Word signifies properly the internal or spiritual man, and "beast" the
external or natural man, by command of God all beasts and birds were
brought into the ark with Noah; of which it is thus written in Genesis:
Jehovah said to Noah, Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee seven
and seven, male and female; and of the beast that is not clean two, male
and female. And he took of the beast that was clean, and of the beast
not clean, and of the bird, and of everything that creepeth upon the
earth; two and two entered unto Noah into the ark, male and female (Gen.
7:1-9). "Noah's flood" describes in the spiritual sense the destruction
of the Most Ancient Church, and also the Last Judgment upon the men of
that church; and by "Noah and his sons" in the same sense, the church
that followed is meant and described, which is called the Ancient
Church. From this it follows that the "beasts" brought into the ark with
Noah mean the affections of the natural man, corresponding to spiritual
affection, which the men of that church had (but these things may be
seen explained in Arcana Coelestia). \[21\] Since "man" signifies the
internal spiritual man, and "beast" signifies the external or natural,
and "Egypt" signifies the natural man separated from the spiritual,
which has altogether perished and is no longer a man but a beast, so
where the destruction of Egypt is treated of it is related that: Jehovah
made hail to rain with which fire was mingled, and smote everything that
was in the fields, from man even to beast (Exod. 9:22-25). (See
respecting this also in Arcana Coelestia.) For the purpose of
representing and thus signifying the same thing it is also written that:
Jehovah smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man even to
beast (Exod. 12:12, 29). But on the other hand, the sons of Israel, by
whom the church was represented, were commanded: To sacrifice to Jehovah
all the firstborn of man and of beast (Num. 18:15). Because such things
were represented and thus signified by "man and beast," from a holy rite
received in the Ancient Church: The king of Nineveh proclaimed a fast,
and commanded that neither man nor beast should taste or drink anything,
and that man and beast should be covered with sackcloth (Jonah 3:7, 8).
\[22\] Because "beasts" signify the affections in both senses it was
forbidden to make the figure of any beast; of which it is thus written
in Moses: Ye shall not make to you the figure of any beast that is on
the earth, the figure of any winged bird that flieth under heaven, the
figure of anything that creepeth on the ground, the figure of any fish
that is in the waters under the earth (Deut. 4:17, 18). This was because
the posterity of Jacob, who were called, because of the representation
of the church with them, "the sons of Israel," were in externals without
an internal, that is, were for the most part merely natural; if,
therefore, they had made to themselves the figure of any beast or bird,
which signified the affections and the like, they would have made idols
for themselves, and would have worshiped them. This, too, was why the
Egyptians, who had more knowledge of representatives than any other
people, made for themselves figures of beasts, as of calves, serpents,
and many other kinds; yet at first not with reference to worship, but on
account of their signification; but their posterity, who from internal
became external, and thus merely natural, did not look upon these as
representative and significative, but as holy things of the church, and
thus they offered to them idolatrous worship. It was for this reason
that the posterity of Jacob, who were altogether external men, and
thence in heart idolatrous, were forbidden to make to themselves any
figure of these things. \[23\] As for example: they worshiped calves in
Egypt, and afterwards in the wilderness, because a "calf" signifies the
first affections of the natural man, together with its good of
innocence. The Gentiles here and there worshiped serpents because a
"serpent" signifies the sensual, which is the ultimate of the natural
man and its prudence, and so with the rest. \[24\] Because "beasts"
signified the various things of the natural man it was also sometimes
commanded when cities or regions were given to the curse that the beasts
also should be slaughtered, for the reason that "the beasts" represented
the evil and profane things with the men who were given to the curse.
Because all kinds of beasts signify the various things pertaining to the
men of the church, laws were enacted respecting beasts, which ones might
be eaten and which might not be eaten (Lev. 11). Those that might be
eaten signified goods, and those that might not be eaten signified
evils; for the church at that time was a representative church, and
therefore every particular prescribed for them was representative and
significative, especially the beasts; of this we thus read in Moses: Ye
shall distinguish between the clean beast and the unclean, and between
the unclean bird and the clean, that ye may not make your souls
abominable by beast or by bird; and ye shall be holy unto Me (Lev.
20:25, 26). \[25\] From this it can now be seen why sacrifices of beasts
of various kinds were permitted, as of lambs, sheep, kids, goats,
bullocks, oxen, also of pigeons and turtledoves; namely, because they
signified things spiritual, and things natural from a spiritual origin;
as "lambs" innocence, "sheep" charity, "bullocks and oxen" the
affections of the natural man corresponding to the affections of the
spiritual man. It was on this account that the beasts for the sacrifices
varied according to the reasons for which they were offered; this would
not have been unless each particular sacrifice of beasts had signified
something belonging to the church. \[26\] As the man of the church at
the present day can hardly be led to believe that "beasts" and "wild
beasts" signify in the Word the affections of good and truth which
belong to the man of the church, and this because it seems so strange
that anything belonging to beasts should signify anything belonging to
man, I will here cite more passages from the Word in the way of
confirmation. In Ezekiel: Speak unto the king of Egypt and to his
multitude, Whom art thou like in thy stature? Behold Asshur, a cedar in
Lebanon, beautiful in branch and with shady foliage; his stature was
higher than all the trees of the field, and his branches were multiplied
because of many waters; in his branches all the birds of the heavens
built their nests; and under his branches every wild beast of the field
has brought forth, and in his shade have dwelt all great nations; he was
beautiful in his greatness. But because thou art lifted up in height he
should be cut down; upon his ruin every bird of the heavens shall dwell,
and every wild beast of the field shall be upon his branches (Ezek.
31:2, 3, 5-7, 10, 12, 13). "The king of Egypt and his multitude" signify
the natural man with the knowledges therein; "Asshur, the cedar in
Lebanon," signifies the rational which is formed by knowledges on the
one part and by the influx of spiritual truth on the other; "beautiful
in branch and with shady foliage" signifies intelligence through
rational truths by means of knowledges. \[27\] "His stature was higher
than all the trees of the field" signifies elevation even to the
interior rational which is from the spiritual; "branches multiplied
because of many waters" signify abundance through spiritual truths which
are from the cognitions of truth from the Word; "the fowl of the heavens
that built their nests in his branches" signify spiritual thoughts in
things rational, for the rational is the medium between the internal
spiritual man and the external natural; "every wild beast of the field
that brought forth under his branches" signifies the affections of
knowledges rationally perceived. \[28\] "The great nations" that dwelt
in his shade signify the goods of the affections in the natural man;
"beautiful in greatness" signifies intelligence; while "the bird of the
heavens and the wild beast of the field that shall dwell upon his ruin
and in his branches" signify the falsities of thoughts, and the evils of
desires which one has because he is "lifted up in height," that is, has
become proud from the love of self-intelligence. Thoughts of truth and
affections for it are signified evidently by "birds of the heavens and
the wild beasts of the field," for it is said that "great nations dwelt
in his shade." \[29\] In Daniel: Behold a tree in the midst of the
earth, and the height thereof was great; it reached even to heaven, and
the sight thereof unto the end of the earth; the leaf thereof was fair,
and the flower thereof much, and in it was food for all; the beast of
the field had shadow under it, and the birds of heaven dwelt in its
branches; and all flesh was nourished from it. A watcher and holy one
came down from heaven, crying, Hew down the tree and cut off his
branches, shake off his leaf, scatter his flower; let the beast flee
from under him, and the birds from his branches; but leave the stump of
his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, with the
herbage of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of the heavens,
and let his portion be with the beast in the grass of the earth; they
shall change his heart from man's and the heart of a beast shall be
given to him (Dan. 4:10-16). This was the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, king
of Babylon, and it describes the establishment of the celestial church
and its increase even to its culmination, and afterwards its overthrow
because of its domination even over the holy things of the church, and
its claiming to itself a right over heaven. \[30\] "The tree in the
midst of the earth" signifies that church; its "height" signifies the
extension of perception and thus of wisdom; "its sight unto the end of
the earth" signifies its extension even to the ultimates of the church;
"the leaf thereof was fair, and the flower thereof much," signifies the
knowledges and affections of truth and good, and intelligence therefrom;
"in it was food for all" signifies heavenly nourishment which is from
good and from truths thence; "the beast of the field had shadow under
it, and the birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches," signifies the
affections of good and the consequent thoughts and perceptions of truth;
and as these pertain to spiritual food it is said that "all flesh was
nourished from it." \[31\] But because of its domination, from the love
of self, over the holy things of heaven and the church, which the
Babylonians at length claimed control of, a description of its overthrow
follows: "A watcher and holy one came down from heaven, crying, Hew down
the tree and cut off his branches, shake off the leaf, scatter the
flower; let the beast flee from under him and the birds from his
branches;" for the love of self and the consequent elation of mind
increases with such even to their claiming a right over the holy things
of the church, yea, over heaven itself; and when this is done everything
of the church perishes, even all perception and the knowledge of good
and truth; for the internal of the mind where the spiritual resides is
closed up, and the external where the natural resides has dominion, and
thus man becomes sensual, until he differs but little from the beasts.
\[32\] The "stump of the roots which should be left in the earth"
signifies the Word, only the letter of which is understood, and which is
merely something known, held in the memory and going forth therefrom
into speech; "bands of iron and brass" signify the interior truths and
goods closed up and held bound in ultimates, "iron" meaning truth in
ultimates, and "brass" good in ultimates, and these when separated from
the interiors are falsities and evils. And as the man of the church then
becomes almost like a beast in respect to the understanding and to the
will, since the evils of the affections and the falsities of the
thoughts have rule, it is said that "his portion shall be with the beast
in the grass of the earth, and his heart shall be changed from man's,
and the heart of a beast shall be given him." That this change and
inversion took place on account of their claiming the right over the
holy things of the church, and at length over heaven, is evident from
verses 30-32 of this chapter, where are these words: The king said, Is
not this the great Babylon which I have built for the house of the
kingdom by the might of my power and for the glory of mine honor? While
the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from the heavens,
saying, The kingdom shall pass away from thee, and they shall drive thee
from man, and thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the field; they
shall make thee to eat the herb as oxen, until thou dost know that the
Most High ruleth in the kingdom of man, and giveth it to whomsoever He
will. \[33\] That "Nebuchadnezzar," as king of Babylon, signifies in the
beginning a celestial church and its increase even to the pinnacle of
wisdom, is evident also from Daniel, where treating of the statue seen
by Nebuchadnezzar in a dream it is said: The God of the heavens hath
given into thine hand the sons of man, the beast of the field, and the
bird of the heavens, and hath made thee to rule over all; thou art the
head of the statue which is of gold (Dan. 2:37, 38). "The head of the
statue, which was of gold," signifies the celestial church, which is the
first of all. That church is signified by "the king of Babylon" at
first, because the church that finally becomes Babylon or Babylonia
begins with the worship of the Lord and from love to Him, and there then
prevails with it a zeal for extending and perfecting the church by means
of the holy goods and truths of heaven, but this from a motive as yet
hidden, namely, a love of exercising dominion, which however breaks
forth only by degrees. But more will be said about this when Babylon is
treated of. \[34\] In Hosea: In that day will I make a covenant for them
with the wild beast of the field and with the bird of the heavens and
with the creeping thing of the earth, and I will break the bow and the
sword and the war from the earth, and I will make them to lie down
securely; and I will betroth thee to Me forever (Hos. 2:18, 19). This is
said of the establishment of a New Church by the Lord, which is here
treated of. Evidently Jehovah, that is, the Lord, will then make a
covenant, not with the wild beast of the field, the bird of the heavens,
and the creeping thing of the earth, but with the men in whom the church
will be established. These things, therefore, signify such things as are
with man, namely, the "wild beast of the field" the affection of the
knowledges of truth, the "bird of the heavens" rational thought from
what is spiritual, the "creeping thing of the earth" the knowledge
\[scientificum\] of the natural man, in particular sensual knowledge.
That He will then "break the bow and the sword from the earth" signifies
that He will destroy the falsities that fight against the truths of
doctrine; and that there will be no longer any contention between truths
and falsities and goods and evils is signified by "I will betroth thee
to Me forever." \[35\] In Isaiah: The wild beast of the field shall
honor Me, the dragons and the daughters of the owl; because I will give
waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert, to give drink to My
people, My chosen (Isa. 43:20). Evidently "the wild beast of the field,"
"the dragons," and "the daughters of the owl," do not mean here a wild
beast of the field, dragons and owls, for these cannot honor Jehovah.
That the men of the church are meant is clear from what follows, since
it is said, "to give drink to My people, My chosen." "The wild beast of
the field" signifies therefore the affections of the knowledges of
truth, "dragons" natural ideas, and "daughters of the owl" sensual
affections; for the sensual is affected by truths and sees them in the
darkness as owls see objects at night. \[36\] This being the
signification, it is evident that the Gentiles with whom a New Church
was to be established are meant, for before they were reformed these
were in such obscure affection and natural thought. "To give waters in
the wilderness and rivers in the desert" signifies to imbue with truths
and thence with intelligence those who before were in ignorance,
"waters" meaning truths, "rivers" intelligence, and "wilderness and
desert" ignorance; "to give drink to the people of Jehovah and to His
chosen" signifies to instruct those who are in the truths of faith and
in the good of charity; those who are in the truths of faith are called
"people," and those who are in the good of charity are called "chosen."
\[37\] In Joel: Is not the food cut off before our eyes from the house
of our God, gladness and joy? The beast groaneth, the droves of cattle
are perplexed, because they have no pasture; also the droves of the
flock are made desolate. The beast of the field panteth after thee,
because the channels of waters are dried up, and fire hath devoured the
habitations of the wilderness (Joel 1:16, 18, 20). This describes the
state of the church when there are no longer in it any truths of
doctrine or good of life. "The food cut off from the house of God"
signifies spiritual nourishment, which is from truths that are from
good, "the house of God" signifying the church; "the beast groaneth, the
droves of cattle are perplexed" signifies the lack of the affections of
truth and thence of knowledges in the natural man, and grief on that
account, "droves of cattle" signifying the things of the natural man in
the whole complex. \[38\] That there is "no pasture" signifies no
instruction; "the droves of the flock are made desolate" signifies the
lack of spiritual truth and good which are of faith and charity; "the
beast of the field panteth after thee" signifies the grief of those who
are in natural affection, and consequently in a longing for the
knowledges of truth and good; "the channels of waters are dried up"
signifies the truths of doctrine dissipated by natural love; "fire hath
devoured the habitations of the wilderness" signifies that love and
thence the destruction of the knowledges of truth, "the habitations of
the wilderness" meaning the things of the understanding and the will in
such a man, which would otherwise receive the truths and goods of the
church. \[39\] In the same: Fear, <span
id="fr_292"></span>[650-4](#fn_292.md) O earth, rejoice and be glad, for
Jehovah hath done great things; fear not, ye beasts of My fields, for
the habitations of the wilderness are made full of herbs, for the tree
shall bear her fruit, the fig tree and the vine shall yield their
strength. Sons of Zion, rejoice and be glad in Jehovah (Joel 2:21-23).
This is said of the establishment of the church by the Lord; and the
"earth which will fear, but rejoice and be glad" signifies the church
and its delight; its establishment by the Lord is signified by "Jehovah
hath done great things;" therefore "the beasts of His fields" mean those
who are in the affections of good and long for instruction from the
Word, "beasts" meaning those who are in the affections of good belonging
to the natural man, and "fields" the doctrinals from the Word. \[40\]
"The habitations of the wilderness are made full of herbs" signifies
that there will be the knowledges of truth and good with those with whom
there were none before; "the tree shall bear her fruit" signifies the
bringing forth of the good of life through these knowledges, for a
"tree" signifies the man of the church, and in particular a mind imbued
with knowledges, and "fruit" signifies the good of life; "the fig tree
and the vine shall yield their strength" signifies the bringing forth of
the effect from natural good and spiritual good together. Because
"beasts of the fields," "tree," "fig tree," and "vine," signify such
things as are with the man of the church it is said, "Sons of Zion,
rejoice and be glad in Jehovah," "sons of Zion" meaning those who are of
the celestial church, while "to rejoice" is predicated of the delight of
good; and "to be glad" of the pleasantness of truth. \[41\] In Ezekiel:
In that day Gog shall come upon the land of Israel; and then shall be a
great earthquake upon the land of Israel; and the fishes of the sea, and
the bird of the heavens, and the wild beast of the field, and every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man who is upon
the faces of the earth, shall tremble before Me (Ezek. 38:18-20). "Gog"
signifies external holiness without internal holiness, thus those who
are in such holiness; an "earthquake" signifies a change of the state of
the church; "the fishes of the sea, and the bird of the heavens, the
wild beast of the field, the creeping thing of the earth, and every man,
shall tremble" signifies that all things of man, in respect to what
belongs to the church with him, shall be changed; "the fishes of the
sea" meaning the knowledges, "the birds of the heavens" thoughts
therefrom, "the wild beasts of the field" the affections therefrom, "the
creeping thing of the earth" the thoughts and affections in the
corporeal-sensual, and "man" all these from first to last. Why otherwise
should these be said to tremble before Jehovah? \[42\] In Zechariah:
There shall be in that day a great tumult, Judah shall fight against
Jerusalem and so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
camel, and of the ass, and of every beast that shall be in those camps;
afterwards everyone remaining shall go up to Jerusalem (Zech. 14:13-15).
This describes the last state of the old church, and the beginning of
the new. The last state of the old church is described by "a great
tumult, when Judah shall fight against Jerusalem," which means the
change at that time, and the fight of the love of evil against the
truths of the doctrine of the church; "the plague of the horse, of the
mule, of the camel, of the ass, and of every beast" signify such things
as hurt and destroy the church and the spiritual life of the men of the
church, "horses, mules, camels, and asses" signifying the things of
their understanding and of their will, thus the things of their
knowledges and affections. But what is signified in particular by
"horse, mule, camel, and ass," has been told elsewhere; here it is
stated merely that "beast" signifies the affection of the natural man,
and "the plague of beast" the hurting and destroying of that affection.
\[43\] In Jeremiah: How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every
field dry up? For the wickedness of them that rule <span
id="fr_293"></span>[650-5](#fn_293.md) therein the beasts and the bird
shall be consumed (Jer. 12:4). The "land" means the church; "the herb of
the field" signifies the truth of the church that has sprung up and that
is springing up; "to mourn and to dry up" signifies to perish and to be
dissipated by lusts; "the beasts and the bird that shall be consumed"
signify the affections of good and the thoughts of truth therefrom. The
result is that these will perish by reason of the evils in the church;
therefore it is said, "for the wickedness of them that dwell in the
land." \[44\] In Isaiah: The bird of the mountains and the beast of the
earth shall be left together; <span id="fr_294"></span>[650-6](#fn_294.md)
but the bird shall loathe it, and every beast of the earth shall despise
it (Isa. 18:6). This is said of "the land shadowed with wings," by which
the church is meant which, because of the obscurity it is in, catches at
imaginary things for spiritual truths, and thus from ignorance comes
into a denial of these truths. "Bird and beast" signify here the
thoughts of truth and the affections of good, both rational and natural,
which are said "to loathe and despise." Evidently it is not the bird and
every beast that will loathe and despise, but the affections of good and
the thoughts of truth, that is, those who are in these. \[45\] In Hosea:
They commit robbery, bloods touch bloods, and everyone that dwelleth
therein shall languish, even to the wild beast of the field and the bird
of the heavens, yea, the fishes of the sea shall be gathered up (Hos.
4:2, 3). Here again "the wild beast of the field," "the bird of the
heavens," and "the fishes of the sea," have a similar signification as
above. \[46\] In Ezekiel: Thou son of man, say to every bird of every
wing, and to every wild beast of the field, Gather yourselves together
and come, gather yourselves from every side to My sacrifice that I
sacrifice for you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that
ye may eat flesh and drink blood; ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty,
and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, rams, lambs, and
kids, <span id="fr_295"></span>[650-7](#fn_295.md) the bullocks, all of
them fatlings of Bashan; ye shall eat fat to satiety, and drink blood to
drunkenness, of My sacrifice which I sacrifice for you; and ye shall be
satiated at My table with horse and chariot, with the mighty, and with
every man of war; so will I give My glory among the nations (Ezek.
39:17-21). This is said of the calling together of the Gentiles to the
church, and the reception by them of the truth of doctrine in the good
of love, which is the good of life, and of their consequent intelligence
in spiritual things. Therefore "the bird of every wing and every wild
beast of the field" which shall be gathered from every side to the great
sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, mean all in whatever state they
may be in respect to the perception of truth and the affection of good,
"the bird of every wing" meaning all in whatever kind of perception of
truth they may be, and "every wild beast of the field" all in whatever
kind of affection of good they may be; "to gather together from every
side" signifies those outside the church from every quarter. \[47\] "The
great sacrifice" signifies the worship of the Lord from faith and love,
for that is what "sacrifices" in general represented; and "the mountains
of Israel" signify the goods of spiritual love. "To eat flesh and drink
blood" signifies to appropriate to oneself the good of love and the
truth of that good; "to eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood
of the princes of the earth" signifies such appropriation, "the mighty"
(or oxen) signifying the affections of the natural man, and "the princes
of the earth" the chief truths of the church; "rams, lambs, kids,
bullocks, fatlings of Bashan" signify all things of innocence, love,
charity, and good, "the fatlings of Bashan" meaning the goods of the
natural man from a spiritual origin. \[48\] From this it is clear what
is signified by "eating flesh to satiety, and drinking blood to
drunkenness," namely, to be filled with every good of love and truth of
faith; "to be satiated at the table of the Lord with horse and chariot,
with the mighty, and with every man of war" signifies to be fully
instructed from the Word, "horse" signifying the understanding of truth,
"chariot" the doctrine of truth, "the mighty and the man of war" the
truth of good fighting against the falsity of evil, and destroying it.
Because this is said of the calling together of the Gentiles to the
church of the Lord, it is added, "so will I give my glory among the
nations," "glory" signifying the Divine truth in light. \[49\] That such
is the signification of "bird of every wing and beast of the field" can
be seen from passages before explained, also from these words in Isaiah:
The saying of the Lord Jehovih, who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, I
will yet gather them to his gathered ones; every wild beast of My
fields, come ye to devour, every wild beast in the forest (Isa. 56:8,
9). "The outcasts of Israel," whom the Lord will gather, signify all in
the church who are in truths from good separated from those therein who
are in falsities from evil; these are meant also by "the wild beasts of
the fields of the Lord Jehovih," "fields" signifying the church in
reference to the implantation of the truth of doctrine; but the Gentiles
that are without the church are signified by "the wild beast in the
forest," the "forest" signifying the natural and sensual man, and "the
wild beast" its knowledge \[scientia\] and obscure intelligence
therefrom. This evidently is the signification of "the wild beast of the
field" and "the wild beast in the forest," for it is said, "Come ye to
devour, every wild beast of My fields and every wild beast in the
forest," "to devour" signifying instruction and appropriation. \[50\] As
most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so also have "beast"
and "wild beast," in which sense "beasts" signify evil affections, which
are the cupidities of adulterating and destroying the goods of the
church, and "wild beasts" the cupidities of falsifying and thus
destroying the truths of the church. \[51\] In this sense "beasts" and
"wild beasts" are mentioned in the following passages. In Ezekiel: I
will raise up over them one shepherd, who shall feed them, My servant
David; he shall be to them for a shepherd; then I will make with them a
covenant of peace, and will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of
the land, that they may dwell trustingly in the wilderness and sleep in
the forest; they shall be no more a prey to the nations, and the wild
beast of the earth shall not devour them, but they shall dwell
trustingly, and none shall make afraid (Ezek. 34:23, 25, 28). This is
said of the Lord's coming and of the blessed state of heaven and of
those of the church who will come into the new heaven. "The servant
David, the shepherd whom Jehovah will raise up," means the Lord, who is
called a "servant" from serving and ministering, that is, performing
uses (see above, n. 409); "to make with them a covenant of peace"
signifies conjunction with the Lord through the Divine things proceeding
from Him, which are the goods of love and the truths of doctrine from
the Word, thus through the Word; "to cause the evil wild beast to cease
out of the land" signifies that evil cupidities and lusts will no more
invade and destroy them. \[52\] "To dwell trustingly in the wilderness
and to sleep in the forests" signifies that they will be safe from
infestation by cupidities and lusts, although they are in them and among
them, "wilderness" and "forest" meaning where such things and such
persons are (these having a similar meaning as in Isa. 11:7-9). Because
the man of the church is destroyed by the cupidities of evil and falsity
it is said "they shall no more be a prey to the nations, and the evil
wild beast shall not devour them," "nations" signifying the cupidities
of evil, and "wild beasts of the earth" the cupidities of falsity.
\[53\] In Jeremiah: Mine heritage is become as a lion in the forest, she
hath given forth her voice against Me, therefore I have hated her; the
bird Zabuah is Mine heritage, about it is the bird; gather together
every wild beast of the field, come ye to devour; many shepherds have
destroyed My vineyard (Jer. 12:8-10). This is said of the vastation of
the church by the falsities of evil. "Heritage" signifies the church;
"the lion out of the forest which hath given forth his voice against
God" signifies the falsity of evil in the whole complex; "the bird
Zabuah" signifies reasonings from falsities; "the wild beast of the
field which shall be gathered to devour" signifies the cupidities of
destroying the truths of the church by falsities; and because the church
that is so destroyed is meant it is said, "many shepherds have destroyed
My vineyard," "vineyard" signifying the spiritual church, or the church
in reference to the affection of truth; and as a "vineyard" signifies
the church it follows that "a wild beast of the field" signifies the
cupidity of falsifying and thus destroying the truths of the church.
\[54\] In Isaiah: No lion shall be there, the ravenous of the wild beast
shall not go up thereon, it shall not be found there (Isa. 35:9). This
treats of the Lord's coming and of His kingdom in the heavens and on the
earths; and the "lion" and "the ravenous of the wild beasts" have a
similar signification as above. It must be clear to everyone that "wild
beast" here does not mean a wild beast. \[55\] In Hosea: I will
encounter them as a bear that is bereaved, and I will rend the caul of
their heart, and I will devour them like a huge lion; the wild beast of
the field shall tear them (Hos. 13:8). Here again, "lion" and "the wild
beast of the field" have a similar signification as above. \[56\] In
Zephaniah: Jehovah will stretch out His hand over the north and will
destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a waste, a dry place like the
wilderness; and the droves shall lie down in the midst of her, every
wild beast of the nation; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge
nightly in her chapiters; a voice shall sing in the window, a drought
shall be in the threshold, because the cedar thereof shall be made bare;
such is the rejoicing city that dwelleth securely, saying in her heart,
I and none other besides me. How is she become a waste, a place for the
wild beast to lie down in; everyone that passeth over her hisseth and
moveth his hand (Zeph. 2:13-15). This describes the vastation of the
church by the falsities of doctrine which are from self-intelligence.
The "north over which Jehovah will stretch out His hand" signifies the
church that is in falsities; "Assyria which Jehovah will destroy"
signifies the reasonings from falsities; "Nineveh which He shall make a
waste, a dry place like the wilderness" signifies the falsities of
doctrine; "droves," "the wild beast of the nation," the "pelican," and
the "bittern," signify the affections of falsities, and falsities
themselves interior and exterior. \[57\] The "chapiters in which these
shall rest" signify the knowledges of truth from the Word falsified;
"the voice in the window" signifies the proclamation of falsity; "the
drought in the threshold" signifies the total desolation of truth; the
"cedar which is made bare" signifies the rational destroyed; "the
rejoicing city dwelling securely" signifies the doctrine of falsity,
with which they are delighted and in which they rest; "saying in her
heart, I and none other besides me" signifies the pride of
self-intelligence; "the place for the wild beast to lie down in"
signifies the state of the church vastated in respect to truths;
"everyone that passeth over her hisseth and moveth his hand" signifies
contempt for such and rejection of them by those who are in truths and
goods of doctrine. \[58\] In Moses: I will give peace in the land, so
that ye may lie down securely and none make afraid, and I will cause the
evil wild beast to cease out of the land, and the sword shall not pass
through your land (Lev. 26:6). "Peace in the land, so that they may lie
down securely and none make afraid" signifies protection by trust in the
Lord from the breaking in of falsity into the church; "to cause the evil
wild beast to cease out of the land" signifies freedom from the
affection and cupidity of falsity; and "the sword shall not pass through
the land" signifies that falsity shall no longer destroy truth. \[59\]
In the same: I will send the hornet before thee, and it shall drive out
the Hivite, the Canaanite, the Hittite before thee; I will not drive him
out from before thee in one year, lest the land be a solitude, and the
wild beast of the field be multiplied upon thee; by little and little
will I drive him out from before thee, until thou be fruitful and
inherit the land (Exod. 23:28-30.) "I will send the hornet before thee"
signifies the dread of those who are in falsities from evil; "and it
shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite" signifies
the flight of falsities that are from evils; "I will not drive him out
from before thee in one year" signifies a hasty flight or removal of
these; "lest the land be desolate" signifies lest there be a lack of
spiritual life or but little of it; "and the wild beast of the field be
multiplied upon thee" signifies a flowing in of falsities from the
delights of the love of self and of the world; "by little and little
will I drive him out from before thee" signifies removal by degrees
according to order; "until thou be fruitful" signifies according to the
increase of good; "and inherit the land" signifies when one is in good
and is regenerated. (But these things may be seen further explained in
Arcana Coelestia, n. 9331-9338.) \[60\] There is a like signification in
these words in Moses: Jehovah God will drive out these nations from
before thee by little and little; thou canst not destroy them at once,
lest the wild beast of the field be multiplied against thee (Deut.
7:22). The "nations" driven out and to be driven out of the land of
Canaan by the sons of Israel signify evils and falsities of every kind,
"the land of Canaan" signifying the church, and "the sons of Israel" the
men of the church; therefore "the wild beast of the field" which would
be multiplied against them signify the cupidities of falsity from evil;
for a man who is reformed and regenerated to the extent that the church
may be in him is reformed and regenerated by little and little; for he
is conceived anew, is born, and is educated, and this is done so far as
the evils and their falsities that are in him from birth and
hereditarily are removed, which is not effected in a moment, but through
a considerable course of life. This makes clear what is signified in the
spiritual sense by "the nations shall not be driven out in one year, but
by little and little, lest the wild beast of the field be multiplied
against thee;" for if evils and the falsities thence were removed all at
once man would have scarcely any life, since the life into which he is
born is a life of evil and consequent falsity from cupidities, which are
removed only so far as goods and truths enter, for by these they are
removed. \[61\] Because "wild beast" signifies <span
id="fr_296"></span>[650-8](#fn_296.md) in the spiritual sense the
cupidities of falsity from evil, and "birds" signify thoughts and
reasonings from them, and because through these the man of the church
spiritually perishes, so here and there in the Word, where the vastation
of the church is treated of, it is said that "they were given to the
wild beasts and the birds to be devoured," as in the following passages.
In David: The boar in the forest treadeth under foot the vine, and the
wild beast of the fields doth feed on it (Ps. 80:13). In Hosea: I will
lay waste her vine and her fig tree, and I will make them a forest, and
the wild beast of the field shall devour them (Hos. 2:12). In Ezekiel: I
will send upon you famine and the evil wild beast, and they shall make
thee bereaved (Ezek. 5:17). This is said of Jerusalem, by which the
church is meant. In the same: I will give him to the wild beast to be
devoured (Ezek. 33:27). In the same: The sheep were scattered, without a
shepherd, and were for food for every wild beast of the field (Ezek.
34:5, 8). In the same: I have given thee for food to the wild beast of
the land and to the bird of the heavens (Ezek. 29:5). In the same: I
will cast thee forth upon the faces of the field, and I will cause every
bird of the heavens to dwell upon thee, and with thee I will satisfy the
wild beast of all the earth (Ezek. 32:4). In Jeremiah: Their carcass
shall be for food to the bird of the heavens and to the beast of the
earth (Jer. 16:4; 19:7; 34:20). In Ezekiel: I have given thee for food
to the swift bird of every wing, and to the wild beast of the field
(Ezek. 39:4). In David: The dead body of Thy servant have they given to
the bird of the heavens, the flesh of Thy saint to the wild beast of the
earth (Ps. 79:2). In Jeremiah: I will visit upon them with four kinds,
with the sword to kill, and with dogs to drag about, and with birds of
the heavens and with the beasts of the earth to devour and to destroy
(Jer. 15:3). \[62\] In these passages, "wild beasts and birds" signify
falsities from the cupidity of evil and from reasoning. And as the
"nations" in the land of Canaan signify the evils and falsities of
religion and of worship, the sons of Jacob did not bury the dead bodies
of the nations which they slew in war, but left them to be devoured by
birds and wild beasts; but this was not by Divine command, but from the
inborn cruelty of that people, thus by permission, in order that such
things might be represented. \[63\] In David: The enemy hath reproached
Jehovah, and a foolish people hath contemned Thy name. Give not the soul
of Thy turtledove unto the beast; forget not the life of Thine afflicted
ones perpetually (Ps. 74:18, 19). The "enemy" who reproached Jehovah
signifies hell and evil therefrom; the "foolish people" who contemned
His name signify the falsities which are opposed to the truths of
doctrine; those who are in truths are called a "people," and in the
contrary sense those who are in falsities, and these are a "foolish
people;" the "name of Jehovah" signifies every truth of doctrine and of
the church; "give not the soul of Thy turtledove to the beast" signifies
not to give spiritual good to those who are in the cupidities of evil;
"the life of Thine afflicted ones" signifies spiritual life oppressed by
evils and falsities. \[64\] In Habakkuk: The violence of Lebanon hath
covered thee, and the devastation of the beasts shall dismay them,
because of the blood of men and the violence of the land, of the city,
and of all that dwell therein (Hab. 2:17). The "violence of Lebanon"
signifies the violence done to the truths perceived by the rational man
from the Word, for "Lebanon" signifies the church in respect to the
perception of truth from the rational man; "the devastation of the
beasts" which shall dismay them signifies the destruction of truths by
the cupidities of evil; "bloods" signify the violence offered to the
truths of the Word by evils; and "violence of the land, of the city, and
of all that dwell therein" signifies violence done to the truths and
goods of the church and to its doctrine from the Word by falsities.
\[65\] In Moses: The tooth of beasts I will send upon them, with the
poison of the creeping things of the earth (Deut. 32:24). "The tooth of
beasts" signifies the sensual in respect to the cupidities of evil, for
"tooth" corresponds to the ultimate of man's life, which is the sensual;
"the poison of the creeping things of the earth" signifies the falsities
therefrom, which cunningly pervert truths by means of the fallacies of
the sensual man. \[66\] In Ezekiel: When I went in and I saw an
abomination, and behold every form of creeping thing and of beast, and
all the idols of the house of Israel painted upon the wall round about
(Ezek. 8:10). These and many other things that were shown to the prophet
signify the direful cupidities and falsities in which the Israelites
were, because they were in externals and not at all in internals; and
those who were such turned all representatives into things idolatrous;
this was the source of their idolatries and also of the idolatries of
many other nations; and then the "beasts and creeping things," images of
which they made for themselves because these signified the affections of
good and of prudence, became the representatives of the direful
cupidities of evil and falsity. This is what takes place when the
natural man separated from the spiritual looks upon things holy; this is
why these are called the "idols of the house of Israel." "The wall round
about" upon which they were seen painted signifies the interiors
everywhere in the natural man, for the "roof" signifies the inmost, the
"floor" or "pavement" the outmost, the "walls" the interiors, and the
"house" the man himself in respect to the things of his mind. The
natural man is interior and exterior, and the interior natural is where
the filthy things of man reside and these the exterior does not divulge
but puts on the semblance of things good, just, and sincere. \[67\] As
"wild beasts" and "beasts" signify the goods of the understanding and
the goods of the will which are of the affections, and as the ancients
who knew correspondences made representative and significative figures
of these, which at first they did not worship, but their posterity, who
from internal became merely external, worshiped them as divine in
themselves, so wild beasts and beasts became idols. This is evident in
Isaiah: Bel bowed down, Nebo stooped, their idols are to the wild beast
and to the beast (Isa. 46:1). In Isaiah there is a prophecy respecting:
The beasts of the south (Isa. 30:6, et seq.); which signify the
adulterations of good and the falsifications of truth, from which arise
evils and falsities of every kind with those of the church who are
merely in externals; they are called "the beasts of the south" because
they are with those who have the Word, from which they are able to be in
the light of truth from the Word, and this is the "south." \[68\] In
Daniel: He saw in vision, when it was night, four beasts coming up out
of the sea; the first was like a lion but had eagle's wings, the second
like a bear, the third like a leopard which had four wings, and the
fourth was dreadful and terrible (Dan. 7:2-7). "The beast out of the
sea" here signifies the love of dominion, which the holy things of the
Word and the church are made to serve as means; and "the four beasts"
signify the gradual increase of the love of dominion, therefore the last
beast is called "dreadful and terrible." (But this may be seen explained
in part above, n. 316, 556.) \[69\] Nearly the like things are signified
in Revelation by: The beast coming up out of the sea (Rev. 13:1-10); The
beast coming up out of the earth (Rev. 13:11-18); The scarlet beast
(Rev. 17:3); The beast out of the abyss (Rev. 17:8). (Respecting these
beasts more is said in Rev. 19:19, 20, and 20:10.) But what cupidities
of evil and falsity each beast signifies will be seen below, where these
beasts are treated of. \[70\] From this it will now appear what is meant
by these words in Mark: The spirit urging Jesus caused Him to go into
the wilderness, and He was in the wilderness forty days; and He was with
the beasts, and angels ministered unto Him (Mark 1:12, 13). The Lord's
being in the wilderness forty days represented the duration of all those
most direful temptations which He, above all others in the whole world,
endured and withstood; for "forty days" signify the entire period and
duration of temptations, thus not that He was tempted at that time only,
but from childhood even to the end of His life in the world; His last
temptation was in Gethsemane. For by temptations He subjugated all the
hells and also glorified His Human (but respecting the Lord's
temptations see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 302). Because
temptations arise through evil spirits and genii who are from hell, thus
through the hells, from which evils and falsities and their cupidities
and lusts arise, so the "beasts" here, with which the Lord was, do not
mean beasts, but the hells and the evils that rise out of them; and the
"angels" who ministered unto Him do not mean angels, but Divine truths,
through which from His own power He overcame and subjugated the hells.
(That "angels" signify in the Word Divine truth, see above, n. 130, 200,
302, 593.)
