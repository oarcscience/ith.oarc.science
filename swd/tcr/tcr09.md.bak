\(5\) The internal and external man. 1. Man was created so as to be at
the same time in the spiritual world and in the natural world. The
spiritual world is where angels are, and the natural world where men
are. And as man was so created, there was given him an internal and an
external-an internal whereby he is in the spiritual world, and an
external whereby he is in the natural world. His internal is what is
called the internal man, and his external the external man. \[2\] 2.
Every man has an internal and an external, but with a difference between
the good and the evil. With the good the internal is in heaven and its
light, and the external in the world and its light; and this light of
the world in them is illumined by the light of heaven, and therefore in
them the internal and external act as one, like cause and effect, or
like the prior and the posterior. But with the evil the internal is in
hell and its light, and this light, in comparison with the light of
heaven is thick darkness, although their external may be in a light like
that in which the good are; thus there is an inversion. On this account
the evil, just like the good, can talk and teach about faith, charity,
and God, but not from faith, charity, and God. \[3\] 3. The internal man
is what is called the spiritual man, because it is in the light of
heaven, which is a spiritual light; while the external man is called the
natural man, because it is in the light of the world, which is a natural
light. The man whose internal is in the light of heaven, and his
external in the light of the world, is a spiritual man in regard to
both, because spiritual light from the interior illumines the natural
light, and makes it as its own. But the reverse is true of the evil.
\[4\] 4. The internal spiritual man viewed in himself is an angel of
heaven, and while living in the body is in association with angels,
although he does not know it; and when released from the body he goes
among angels. But with the evil the internal man is a satan, and while
living in the body is in association with satans, and when released from
the body goes among them. \[5\] 5. With those who are spiritual men, the
interiors of the mind are actually elevated towards heaven, for they
look primarily to that; but with those who are merely natural, the
interiors of the mind are turned away from heaven and towards the world,
because they look primarily to the world. \[6\] 6. Those who cherish a
merely general idea of the internal and external man, believe that it is
the internal man that thinks and wills, and the external that speaks and
acts, because thinking and willing are internal, while speech and action
are external. But let it be understood that when a man thinks and wills
rightly respecting the Lord and the things pertaining to the Lord, and
respecting the neighbor and what pertains to the neighbor, he thinks and
wills from a spiritual internal, because from a belief in truth and a
love of good; but when his thought and will respecting these things are
evil, his thought and will are from an infernal internal, because from a
belief in falsity and a love of evil. In a word, so far as man is in
love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor, he is in a spiritual
internal, and from that internal thinks and wills and also speaks and
acts; while so far as he is in the love of self and the world, he thinks
and wills from hell, even when he speaks and acts otherwise. \[7\] 7. It
has been provided and arranged by the Lord, that so far as man thinks
and wills from heaven, the spiritual man is opened and formed, the
opening being into heaven even to the Lord, while the forming is in
conformity to the things of heaven. But on the contrary so far as man
thinks and wills, not from heaven but from the world, so far the
internal spiritual man is closed, and the external is opened and formed,
the opening being into the world, while the forming is in conformity to
the things of hell. \[8\] 8. Those in whom the internal spiritual man is
opened into heaven to the Lord are in the light of heaven, and in
enlightenment from the Lord, and thereby in intelligence and wisdom;
these see truth from the light of truth and perceive good from the love
of good. But those in whom the internal spiritual man is closed do not
know what the internal man is, neither do they believe in the Word or in
a life after death, or in the things pertaining to heaven and the
church; and because they are in merely natural light, they believe
nature to be from itself and not from God; they see falsity as truth,
and have a perception of evil as good. \[9\] 9. The internal and
external here treated are the internal and external of man's spirit; his
body is only an additional external within which the former exist; for
the body in no way acts from itself, but acts only from the spirit that
is in it. It must be understood that the spirit of man, after its
release from the body, thinks and wills and speaks and acts, just as
before. Thinking and willing are its internal, while speech and action
then constitute its external.

<span class="margnote"><span id="402.">402.</span></span>

\(6\) The merely natural and sensual man. As there are few that know who
are meant by sensual men, and what their nature is, and yet it is
important to know it, therefore they shall be described: 1. He is called
a sensual man who judges of all things by the bodily senses, and who
believes in nothing except what he can see with his eyes and touch with
his hands, calling this something real, and rejecting everything else;
consequently, the sensual man is the lowest natural man. \[2\] 2. The
interiors of his mind, which see from the light of heaven, are closed,
so that he there sees nothing of the truth that pertains to heaven and
the church, since he thinks in outermosts, and not interiorly from any
spiritual light. \[3\] 3. Because he is in gross natural light he is
inwardly opposed to the things of heaven and the church, although
outwardly he may advocate them with a zeal proportionate to the dominion
he may thereby secure. \[4\] 4. Sensual men reason keenly and
ingeniously, because their thought is so near to speech as to be almost
in it, and, as it were, on the lips, and because they place all
intelligence in speech from memory only. \[5\] 5. Some of them can
confirm whatever they wish, and can confirm falsities dexterously; and
after confirming them they believe them to be truths; but their
reasoning and confirming are from the fallacies of the senses, which
captivate and persuade the common people. \[6\] 6. Sensual men are more
shrewd and crafty than others. \[7\] 7. The interiors of their minds are
loathsome and foul, because through them they communicate with the
hells. \[8\] 8. Those who are in the hells are sensual, and the deeper
they are the more sensual. The sphere of infernal itself with the
sensual things of man from behind. \[9\] 9. Sensual men do not see any
genuine truth in light, but reason and dispute about everything, as to
whether it is so or not; and these disputes when heard at a distance
from them are like the gnashings of teeth, which viewed in themselves
are the collision of falsities with each other, and also of falsity and
truth. This therefore makes plain what is meant in the Word by the
"gnashing of teeth," because reasoning from the fallacies of the senses
corresponds to the teeth \[10\] 10. Accomplished and learned men who
have deeply confirmed themselves in falsities, and still more those who
have confirmed themselves against the truths of the Word, are more
sensual than others, although they do not appear so to the world.
Heretical doctrines have been introduced chiefly by such sensual men.
\[11\] 11. The hypocritical, the deceitful, the voluptuous, the
adulterous, and the avaricious, are for the most part sensual. \[12\]
12. Those who reason from sensual things only, and against the genuine
truths of the Word and consequently of the church, were called by the
ancients serpents of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. \[13\]
As sensual things mean the things presented to the bodily senses and
imbibed through those senses, it follows: 13. That by means of sensual
things man communicates with the world, and by means of things rational
above the sensual he communicates with heaven \[14\] 14. Things sensual
furnish such things from the natural world as are of service to the
interiors of the mind in the spiritual world. \[15\] 15. There are
sensual things that minister to the understanding, and these are the
various natural studies called physics; and there are sensual things
that minister to the will, and these are the delights of the senses and
the body. \[16\] 16. Unless the thought is elevated above natural things
man has but little wisdom. The wise man thinks above sensual things; and
when thought is elevated above what is sensual it enters into clearer
light, and finally into the light of heaven; from this man has
perception of truth which is properly intelligence. \[17\] 17. The
elevation of the mind above sensual things, and its withdrawal
therefrom, was known to the ancients. \[18\] 18. When sensual things are
in the last place, by means of them a way is opened for the
understanding, and truths are disengaged by a kind of extraction; but
when sensual things are in the first place they close the way, and man
sees truths only as in a mist, or as at night. \[19\] 19. In a wise man
sensual things are in the last place, and are subject to more interior
things; but in an unwise man they are in the first place and have
dominion. Such as these are they who are properly called sensual. \[20\]
20. In man there are sensual things that he has in common with beasts,
and others not so. To the extent that one thinks above sensual things,
he is a man; but no one can think above sensual things and see the
truths of the church, unless he acknowledges God and lives according to
His commandments; for it is God who elevates and enlightens.

II\. THESE THREE LOVES, WHEN RIGHTLY SUBORDINATED, PERFECT MAN, BUT WHEN
NOT RIGHTLY SUBORDINATED, THEY PERVERT AND INVERT HIM. Something shall
first be said of the subordination of these three universal loves, which
are the love of heaven, the love of the world, and the love of self, and
then of the influx and insertion of one into the other, and finally of
man's state according to that subordination. These three loves are
related to each other like the three regions of the body, the highest of
which is the head; the intermediate, the chest and abdomen, while the
knees and feet and soles of the feet form the third. When the love of
heaven constitutes the head, love of the world the chest and abdomen,
and love of self the feet and their soles, man is in a perfect state in
accordance with his creation, because the two lower loves then minister
to the highest, as the body and all its parts minister to the head. So
when the love of heaven constitutes the head, it flows into the love of
the world, which is chiefly a love of wealth, and by means of wealth it
performs uses; and through this latter love it flows mediately into the
love of self, which is chiefly the love of dignities, and by means of
these dignities it performs uses. Thus do these three loves, by the
influx of one into the other, breathe forth uses. \[2\] Who does not
comprehend, that when a man desires to perform uses from spiritual love,
which is from the Lord and is what is meant by the love of heaven, his
natural man performs them by means of his wealth and his other goods
(the sensual man cooperating in its function), and that it is to his
honor to produce them? Who does not also comprehend that all the works
that a man does with his body are done according to the state of his
mind in the head; and if the mind is in the love of uses, the body by
means of its members accomplishes them? And this is so, because the will
and the understanding in their principles are in the head, and in their
derivatives in the body, as the will is in deeds, and the thought in
speech, and comparatively as the prolific principle of the seed is in
the whole tree and in every part of it, and through these produces
fruit, which is its use. Or it is like fire and light within a
crystalline vase which thereby becomes warm and shows the light through
it. And again, the spiritual sight of the mind together with the natural
sight of the body, in one in whom these three loves are truly and
rightly subordinated, because of the light that flows in through heaven
from the Lord, may be likened to an African apple, which is transparent
to the very center, where there is the repository of the seeds.
Something like this is meant by these words of the Lord, The lamp of the
body is the eye; if the eye be single (that is, sound), the whole body
is full of light (Matt. 6:22; Luke 11:34). \[3\] No man of sound reason
can condemn wealth, for it is in the general body like the blood in a
man; nor can he condemn the honors attached to office, for they are the
hands of the king and the pillars of society, provided the natural and
sensual love of them is subordinated to spiritual love. Moreover, there
are administrative offices in heaven and honors attached to them; but
those who administer them love nothing better than to perform uses,
because they are spiritual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="404.">404.</span></span>

But when love of the world or of wealth forms the head, that is, when it
is the ruling love, man puts on a wholly different state; for then the
love of heaven is exiled from the head and betakes itself to the body.
The man who is in this state prefers the world to heaven; he worships
God indeed, but from merely natural love which places merit in all
worship; he also does good to the neighbor, but for the sake of
recompense. To such, heavenly things are like clothing, clad in which
they appear before the eyes of men to be walking in brightness, but
before the eyes of angels they appear indistinct, for when love of the
world possesses the internal man, and the love of heaven the external,
the former makes all things belonging to the church obscure and hides
them as under a veil. But this love is of great variety, worse in the
degree that it verges toward avarice, in which the love of heaven grows
black; so too if it verges toward pride and eminence over others from
love of self. It is different if it verges towards prodigality, and is
less hurtful if it has in view as an end the splendors of the world, as
palaces, ornaments, magnificent clothing, servants, horses and carriages
pompously arrayed, and other like things. The character of every love is
determined by the end which it regards and intends. This love may be
compared to blackish glass, which smothers the light and variegates it
only in dark and evanescent hues. It is also like mists and clouds which
take away the rays of the sun. It is also like new, unfermented wine,
which tastes sweet but disturbs the stomach. Such a man when viewed from
heaven looks like a hunchback, walking with his head down looking at the
ground, and when he raises his head towards heaven he strains the
muscles, and quickly drops it down again. The ancients in the church
called such men Mammons, and the Greeks called them Plutos.

<span class="margnote"><span id="405.">405.</span></span>

But when love of self or love of ruling constitutes the head, the love
of heaven passes down through the body to the feet; and as that love
increases, the love of heaven descends through the ankles to the soles,
and if it increases still further, it passes to the heels and is trodden
upon. There is a love of ruling arising from love of the neighbor, and a
love of ruling arising from love of self. Those who are in the love of
ruling from love of the neighbor seek dominion to the end that they may
perform uses to the public and to individuals; and to such, therefore,
dominion is entrusted in the heavens. \[2\] Emperors, kings, and
noblemen, who have been born and brought up to positions of authority,
if they humble themselves before God, are sometimes less in that love
than those who are of humble origin and who from pride are more eager
than others for places of pre-eminence. But to those who are in the love
of ruling from love of self, the love of heaven is like a bench on
which, to please the people, they place their feet, but which, when the
people are out of sight, they toss into a corner or out of doors. This
is because they love themselves alone, and consequently immerse their
wills and the thoughts of their minds in what is their own \[proprium\],
which viewed in itself is inherited evil, and this evil is diametrically
opposed to the love of heaven. \[3\] The evils of those who are in the
love of rule from love of self, are in general as follows: Contempt of
others, enmity against those who do not favor them; consequently
hostility, hatred, revenge, unmercifulness, ferocity, and cruelty; and
where such evils prevail, there is also contempt of God and of Divine
things, which are the truths and goods of the church; or if they honor
these it is with the lips only, lest they should be denounced by the
church authorities and censured by others. \[4\] But this love is one
thing with the clergy and another with the laity. With the clergy it
climbs upward, when the reins are given to it, even until they wish to
be gods; but with the laity until they wish to be kings; to such an
extent do the hallucinations of that love carry their minds away. \[5\]
Since in the perfect man the love of heaven holds the highest place, and
forms, as it were, the head of all that follows from it, the love of the
world being beneath it like the chest beneath the head, and the love of
self beneath this like the feet, it follows, that if love of self were
to form the head, the man would be completely inverted. He would then
appear to the angels like one lying bent over, with his head to the
ground and his back toward heaven; and when worshiping, he would appear
to be frolicking on his hands and feet like a panther's cub.
Furthermore, such men would appear under the forms of various beasts
with two heads, one head above having the face of a wild animal, and the
other below having a human face, which would be constantly thrust
forward by the upper one and compelled to kiss the earth. All these are
sensual men, and are such as were described above (n. 402).

<span class="margnote"><span id="406.">406.</span></span>

III\. EVERY MAN INDIVIDUALLY IS THE NEIGHBOR WHO IS TO BE LOVED, BUT
ACCORDING TO THE QUALITY OF HIS GOOD. Man is born not for the sake of
himself but for the sake of others; that is, he is born not to live for
himself alone but for others; otherwise there could be no cohesive
society, nor any good therein. It is a common saying that every man is a
neighbor to himself; but the doctrine of charity teaches how this is to
be understood, namely, that everyone should provide for himself the
necessaries of life, as food, clothing, a dwelling, and other things
which are necessarily required in the social life in which he is, and
this not only for himself, but also for his family, nor for the present
alone, but also for the future. For unless a man acquires for himself
the necessaries of life, he is not in a condition to exercise charity,
since he is in want of everything. But how every man ought to be a
neighbor to himself may be seen from the following comparison: Every man
ought to provide his body with food; this must be first, but the end
should be that he may have a sound mind in a sound body; and every man
ought to provide his mind with food, namely, with such things as pertain
to intelligence and judgment; but the end should be that he may thereby
be in a state to serve his fellow-citizens, society, his country, the
church, and thus the Lord. He who does this provides well for himself to
eternity. From this it is plain what is first in time, and what is first
in end, and that the first in end is that to which all things look. It
is also like building a house; first the foundation must be laid; but
the foundation must be for the house, and the house for a dwellingplace.
He who believes himself to be a neighbor to himself in the first place
or primarily, is like one who regards the foundation, not the dwelling,
as the end; and yet the dwelling is itself the first and the last end,
and the house with its foundation is only a means to the end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="407.">407.</span></span>

What it is to love the neighbor shall be explained. To love the neighbor
is not alone to wish well and do good to a relative, a friend, or a good
man, but also to a stranger, an enemy, or a bad man. But charity is to
be exercised toward the latter in one way and toward the former in
another; toward a relative or friend by direct benefits; toward an enemy
or a bad man by indirect benefits, which are rendered by exhortation,
discipline, punishment, and consequent amendment. This may be
illustrated thus: A judge who punishes an evil-doer in accordance with
law and justice, loves his neighbor; for so he makes him better, and
consults the welfare of the citizens that he may not do them harm.
Everyone knows that a father who chastises his children when they do
wrong, loves them, and that, on the other hand, he who does not chastise
them therefore, loves their evils, and this cannot be called charity.
Again, if a man repels an insulting enemy, and in self-defense strikes
him or delivers him to the judge in order to prevent injury to himself,
and yet with a disposition to be-friend the man, he acts from a
charitable spirit. Wars that have as an end the defense of the country
and the church, are not contrary to charity. The end in view declares
whether it is charity or not.

<span class="margnote"><span id="408.">408.</span></span>

Since, therefore, charity in its origin is good will, and good will has
its seat in the internal man, it is plain that when anyone who has
charity resists an enemy, punishes the guilty, and chastises the wicked,
he does this by means of the external man; and therefore, after he has
done it he returns to the charity that resides in his internal man, and
then, so far as he can, and so far as is useful, he wishes him well, and
from good will does good to him. Those who have genuine charity have a
zeal for what is good, and that zeal may appear in the external man like
anger and flaming fire; but its flame dies out and is quieted as soon as
his adversary returns to reason. It is different with those who have no
charity. Their zeal is anger and hatred; for by these their internal man
is heated and set on fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="409.">409.</span></span>

Before the Lord came into the world scarcely anyone knew what the
internal man is or what charity is, and this is why in so many places He
taught brotherly love, that is, charity; and this constitutes the
distinction between the Old Testament or Covenant and the New. That good
ought to be done from charity to the adversary and the enemy the Lord
taught in Matthew: Ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old
time, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. But I say unto
you, love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that
hate you, and pray for them that hurt you and persecute you; that ye may
be sons of your Father who is in the heavens (Matt. 5:43-45). And when
Peter asked Him how often he should forgive one sinning against him,
whether he should do so until seven times, He replied: I say not unto
thee, until seven times, but until seventy times seven (Matt. 18:21,
22). And I have heard from heaven that the Lord forgives to everyone his
sins, and never takes vengeance nor even imputes sin, because He is love
itself and good itself; nevertheless, sins are not thereby washed away,
for this can be done only by repentance. For when He told Peter to
forgive until seventy times seven, what will not the Lord do?

<span class="margnote"><span id="410.">410.</span></span>

Since charity itself has its seat in the internal man, wherein it is
willing well, and from that is in the external man, wherein it is
well-doing, it follows that the internal man is to be loved, and from
that the external; consequently that a man is to be loved according to
the quality of the good that is in him. Therefore good itself is
essentially the neighbor. This may be illustrated thus: When one selects
for himself from among three or four a steward for his house, or a
servant, does he not try to find out about his internal man, and choose
one who is sincere and faithful, and for that reason love him? In like
manner a king or magistrate from three or four persons would select one
competent for office, and would refuse the incompetent, whatever his
looks, or however favorable his speech and actions. \[2\] Since, then,
every man is the neighbor, and the variety of men is infinite, and
everyone is to be loved as a neighbor according to his good, it is plain
that there are genera and species and also degrees of love to the
neighbor. And because the Lord is to be loved above all things, it
follows that the degrees of love towards the neighbor are to be measured
by love to the Lord, that is, by how much of the Lord or of what is from
the Lord the other possesses in himself; for thus far he possesses good,
since all good is from the Lord. \[3\] But as these degrees are in the
internal man, and the internal man rarely manifests itself in the world,
it is sufficient that the neighbor be loved according to the degrees
that are known. But after death these degrees are clearly perceived; for
the affections of the will and the consequent thoughts of the
understanding form a spiritual sphere round about those in the spiritual
world, which is felt in various ways; while in this world this spiritual
sphere is absorbed by the material body, and encloses itself within a
natural sphere, which then flows forth from man. That there are degrees
of love towards the neighbor, is plain from the Lord's parable of the
Samaritan who showed mercy to the man wounded by thieves, whom the
priests and the Levite saw and passed by; and when the Lord asked which
of those three seemed to have been the neighbor, He was answered, He who
showed mercy (Luke 10:30-37).

<span class="margnote"><span id="411.">411.</span></span>

It is written, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God above all things, and
thy neighbor as thyself (Luke 10:27). To love the neighbor as oneself
is, not to hold him in light esteem in comparison with oneself, to deal
justly with him, and not to pass evil judgments upon him. The law of
charity set forth and given by the Lord is this: All things whatsoever
ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them; for this
is the law and the prophets (Matt. 7:12; Luke 6:31, 32). So do they love
the neighbor who are in the love of heaven; while those who are in the
love of the world love the neighbor from the world and for the sake of
the world; and those who are in the love of self love the neighbor from
self and for the sake of self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="412.">412.</span></span>

IV\. THE COLLECTIVE MAN, THAT IS, A COMMUNITY SMALLER OR GREATER, AND
THE COMPOSITE MAN FORMED OF COMMUNITIES, THAT IS, ONE'S COUNTRY, IS THE
NEIGHBOR THAT IS TO BE LOVED. Those who do not know what the term
neighbor means in its true sense, suppose that it means nothing else
than the individual man, and that loving the neighbor means conferring
benefits upon him. But the neighbor and love to him have a wider meaning
and a higher meaning as individuals are multiplied. Who cannot
understand that loving many men in a body is loving the neighbor more
than loving one individual of a body? Thus, a community smaller or
greater is the neighbor because it is a collective man; and from this it
follows that he who loves a community loves those of whom the community
consists; therefore he who wills and acts rightly towards a community
consults the good of each individual. A community is like a single man;
and those who enter into it form as it were one body, and are distinct
from each other like the members of one body. When the Lord and the
angels from Him look down upon the earth, they see an entire community
just like a single man, with a form according to the qualities of those
in it. It has been granted me to see a certain community in heaven
precisely as a single man, in stature like that of a man in the world.
\[2\] That love towards a community is a fuller love to the neighbor
than love towards a separate or individual man, is obvious from this,
that dignities are measured out according to the kind of administration
over communities, and honors are attached to offices according to the
uses they promote. For in the world there are higher and lower offices
subordinated according to their more or less universal government over
communities; and the king is he whose government is the most universal;
and each one has remuneration, glory, and the general love according to
the extent of his duties, and the goods of use which he promotes. \[3\]
Nevertheless, the rulers of this age can perform uses and consult the
good of society, and not love the neighbor; as those do who perform uses
and consult the good of others with reference to the world or to self,
or for the sake of appearances, or that they may be thought worthy to be
elevated to higher dignities. But although the character of such is not
discerned in the world, it is discerned in heaven; and in consequence
those who have promoted uses from love to the neighbor, are the ones
placed as rulers over heavenly communities, and there enjoy splendor and
honor; and yet such do not set their hearts upon these things, but upon
uses. But the others, who have performed uses from love of the world and
of self, are rejected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="413.">413.</span></span>

The difference between love to the neighbor and the exercise of it when
directed towards man as an individual and towards the collective man or
a community, is like that between the duty of a private citizen and the
duty of a civil officer or a military officer, or like that between the
one who traded with two talents and the one who traded with five (Matt.
25:14-30); or it is like the difference between the value of a shekel
and that of a talent, or between the product from a vine and that from a
vineyard, or between the product from an olive tree and that from an
olive yard, or the product from a tree and that from an orchard.
Moreover, love to the neighbor in man ascends more and more interiorly,
and as it ascends he loves a community more than an individual, and his
country more than a community. Since, then, charity consists in right
willing and right doing therefrom, it follows that it ought to be
exercised towards a community in much the same way as towards the
individual, but in one way towards a community of good men and in
another way towards a community of evil men. Towards the latter charity
is to be exercised according to natural equity; towards the former
according to spiritual equity. But on these two kinds of equity
something will appear elsewhere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="414.">414.</span></span>

One's country is more a neighbor than a single community, because it
consists of many communities, and consequently love towards the country
is a broader and higher love. Moreover, loving one's country is loving
the public welfare. One's country is the neighbor, because it is like a
parent; for one is born in it, and it has nourished him and continues to
nourish him, and has protected and continues to protect him from injury.
Men ought to do good to their country from a love for it, according to
its needs, some of which are natural and some spiritual. Natural needs
relate to civil life and order, and spiritual needs to spiritual life
and order. That one's country should be loved, not as one loves himself,
but more than himself, is a law inscribed on the human heart; from which
has come the well-known principle, which every true man endorses, that
if the country is threatened with ruin from an enemy or any other
source, it is noble to die for it, and glorious for a soldier to shed
his blood for it. This is said because so great should be one's love for
it. It should be known that those who love their country and render good
service to it from good will, after death love the Lord's kingdom, for
then that is their country; and those who love the Lord's kingdom love
the Lord Himself, because the Lord is the all in all things of His
kingdom.

V. THE CHURCH IS THE NEIGHBOR WHO IS TO BE LOVED IN A STILL HIGHER
DEGREE, AND THE LORD'S KINGDOM IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE. Since man was born
for eternal life, and is introduced into it by the church, the church is
to be loved as the neighbor in a higher degree, because it teaches the
means which lead to eternal life and introduces man into it, leading to
it by the truths of doctrine and introducing into it by goods of life.
This does not mean that the priesthood should be loved in a higher
degree, and the church because of the priesthood; but it means that the
good and truth of the church should be loved, and the priesthood for the
sake of these. The priesthood merely serves, and is to be honored so far
as it serves. The church is the neighbor that is to be loved in a higher
degree, thus even above one's country, for the reason also, that by his
country man is initiated into civil life, but by the church into
spiritual life, and by that life man is separated from a merely animal
life. Moreover, civil life is a temporary life, which has an end and
which is then as if it had not been; while the spiritual life is
eternal, having no end; therefore of the latter may be predicated being
\[esse\], but of the former non-being. The distinction is like that
between the finite and the infinite, between which there is no ratio;
for the eternal is the infinite as to time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="416.">416.</span></span>

The Lord's kingdom is the neighbor that is to be loved in the highest
degree, because the Lord's kingdom means the church throughout the
world, which is called the communion of saints; also heaven is meant by
it; consequently he who loves the Lord's kingdom loves all in the whole
world who acknowledge the Lord and have faith in Him and charity towards
the neighbor; and he loves also all in heaven. Those who love the Lord's
kingdom love the Lord above all things, and are consequently in love to
God more than others, because the church in the heavens and on earth is
the body of the Lord, for those who are in it are in the Lord and the
Lord in them. Therefore love towards the Lord's kingdom is love towards
the neighbor in its fullness; for those who love the Lord's kingdom, not
only love the Lord above all things, but also love the neighbor as
themselves; for love to the Lord is a universal love, and consequently
is in each thing and all things of spiritual life, and in each thing and
all things of natural life; for that love has its seat in the highest
things in man, and things highest flow into lower things and vivify
them, as the will flows into all things of intention and of action
therefrom, and the understanding into all things of thought and of
speech therefrom. Therefore the Lord says: Seek ye first the kingdom of
God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you
(Matt. 6:33). That the kingdom of the heavens is the Lord's kingdom is
evident from these words in Daniel: Behold, there was coming with the
clouds of heaven one like unto the Son of Man; and there was given Him
dominion, and glory, and a kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and
languages shall worship Him. His dominion is a dominion of ages, which
shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed
(Dan. 7:13-14).

<span class="margnote"><span id="417.">417.</span></span>

VI\. TO LOVE THE NEIGHBOR, VIEWED IN ITSELF, IS NOT TO LOVE THE PERSON,
BUT THE GOOD THAT IS IN THE PERSON. Who does not know that a man is not
a man because of his having a human face and a human body, but because
of the wisdom of his understanding and the goodness of his will? As the
quality of these ascends, he becomes the more a man. At birth man is
more a brute than any animal, but he becomes a man through instruction
of various kinds, by receiving which his mind is formed, and from his
mind and according to it man is a man. There are some beasts whose faces
resemble the human face, but these enjoy no faculty of understanding or
of doing anything from the understanding; but they act from the instinct
which their natural love excites. The difference is that a beast
expresses by sounds the affections of its love, while man speaks them as
they are formulated in thought; also, a beast with his face downward
looks upon the ground, while man with his face raised beholds heaven all
about him. From all this it may be inferred that man is a man so far as
he speaks from sound reason, and looks forward to his abode in heaven;
while so far as he speaks from perverted reason, and looks only to his
abode in the world, so far he is not a man. Yet even such are men
potentially, though not actually; for every man enjoys the ability to
understand truth and to will what is good; but so far as he has no wish
to do good or understand truth, he can only counterfeit man in externals
and play the ape.

<span class="margnote"><span id="418.">418.</span></span>

Good is the neighbor, because good belongs to the will, and the will is
the being \[esse\] of man's life. The truth of the understanding is also
the neighbor, but only so far as it proceeds from the good of the will;
for the good of the will take form in the understanding, and makes
itself visible there is the light of reason. That good is the neighbor
is evident from all experience. Who loves a person except from the
quality of his will and understanding, that is, from what is good and
just in him? For example, who loves a king, a prince, a general, a
governor, a consul, any magistrate or judge, except for the judgment
from which they act and speak? Who loves a primate, a minister of the
church, or a canon, except for his learning, his integrity of life, and
his zeal for the salvation of souls? Who loves the general of an army or
any officer over him, except for bravery combined with prudence? Who
loves a merchant except for his honesty? Who loves a workman or a
servant, except for his fidelity? Nay, who loves a tree except for its
fruit, the soil except for its fertility, a precious stone except for
its value? and so on. And what is remarkable, it is not only the upright
man who loves what is good and just in another, the man who is not
upright does so also, because with him he is in no fear of losing
reputation, honor, or wealth. But the love of good in one who is not
upright, is not love of the neighbor; for he loves another interiorly
only so far as he is of service to him. But loving what is good in
another from the good in oneself is genuine love to the neighbor; for
the goods then kiss and mutually unite with each other.

<span class="margnote"><span id="419.">419.</span></span>

The man who loves good because it is good, and truth because it is
truth, loves the neighbor eminently, because he loves the Lord who is
good itself and truth itself. There is no love of good and love of truth
from good, that is, love to the neighbor, from any other source. Love to
the neighbor is thus formed from a heavenly origin. It is the same thing
whether you say use or good; therefore performing uses is doing good;
and according to the quantity and quality of the use in the good so far
in quantity and quality the good is good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="420.">420.</span></span>

VII\. CHARITY AND GOOD WORKS ARE TWO DISTINCT THINGS, LIKE WILLING WELL
AND DOING WELL. In every man there is an internal and an external. His
internal is what is called the internal man, and his external what is
called the external man. But one who does not know what the internal man
and the external man are, may suppose that it is the internal man that
exercises thought and will, and the external that speaks and acts. These
latter belong, indeed, to the external man, and the former to the
internal; yet they are not what essentially constitute the external and
internal man. In common perception indeed man's mind is his internal
man, but the mind is itself divided into two regions; the one region
which is higher and more internal is spiritual; and the other which is
lower and more external is natural. The spiritual mind looks mainly to
the spiritual world, and has for its objects the things that are there,
either such as are in heaven or such as are in hell; for both are in the
spiritual world. But the natural mind looks mainly to the natural world,
and has for its objects the things that are there, whether good or evil.
All of man's action and speech proceeds from the lower region of the
mind directly, and indirectly from its higher region, since the lower
region of the mind is nearer to the bodily senses, and the higher region
more remote from them. There is this division of the mind in man,
because he was so created as to be both spiritual and natural, and thus
a man and not a beast. All this makes clear that the man who looks
primarily to himself and the world is an external man, because he is
natural, not only in body but also in mind; while the man who looks
primarily to the things of heaven and the church is an internal man,
because he is spiritual both in mind and body. He is spiritual even in
body, because his actions and words proceed from the higher mind, which
is spiritual, through the lower, which is natural. For it is known that
effects proceed from the body, and the causes that produce the effects
proceed from the mind; also that the cause is everything in the effect.
That the human mind is so divided is clearly evident from the fact that
a man can act the part of a dissembler, a flatterer, a hypocrite, or an
actor; and that he can assent to what another says and yet laugh at it;
doing one from the higher mind and the other from the lower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="421.">421.</span></span>

From all this it can be seen how it is to be understood that charity and
good works are distinct like willing well and doing well; that is to
say, formally they are distinct, as the mind, which thinks and wills, is
distinct from the body through which the mind speaks and acts; while
essentially they are distinct because of the distinction in the mind
itself which has an inner region that is spiritual, and an outer that is
natural, as said above; so that when works proceed from the spiritual
mind, they proceed from its good will, which is charity; but when they
proceed from the natural mind, they proceed from a good will that is not
charity. For even when it appears in the external form like charity, it
is not charity in the internal form. In fact, charity in external form
merely presents the show of charity, but does not possess its essence.
This may be illustrated by a comparison with seeds in the ground. Each
seed produces a plant, whether useful or useless, according to the
nature of the seed. So is it with spiritual seed, which is the truth of
the church derived from the Word; from this seed doctrine is formed,
useful if from genuine truths, useless if from truths falsified. It is
the same with charity that springs from good will, whether the good will
is for the sake of self and the world or for the sake of the neighbor in
a limited or in a broad sense; if for the sake of self and the world, it
is spurious charity, but if for the sake of the neighbor, it is genuine
charity. But of this more may be seen in the chapter on Faith,
especially in the section where it is shown that charity is willing
well, and good works are doing well from willing well (n. 374); and that
charity and faith are only mental and perishable things unless they are
determined to works and coexist in them when possible (n. 375-376).

<span class="margnote"><span id="422.">422.</span></span>

VIII\. CHARITY ITSELF IS ACTING JUSTLY AND FAITHFULLY IN THE OFFICE,
BUSINESS, AND EMPLOYMENT IN WHICH A MAN IS ENGAGED, AND WITH THOSE WITH
WHOM HE HAS ANY DEALINGS. Charity itself is acting justly and faithfully
in the office, business, and employment in which a man is engaged,
because all that such a man does is of use to society, and use is good;
and good in a sense abstracted from person is the neighbor. (That not a
single man only, but also a lesser community, and even a man's country,
is the neighbor, has been shown above.) Take, for example, a king who
sets his subjects an example of well-doing, who wishes them to live
according to the laws of justice, rewards those who so live, regards
everyone according to his merits, protects his subjects against injury
and invasion, acts the part of a father to his kingdom, and consults the
general prosperity of his people; in his heart there is charity, and his
deeds are good works. The priest who teaches truth from the Word, and
thereby leads to good of life, and so to heaven, because he consults the
good of the souls of those of his church, is eminently in the exercise
of charity. The judge who judges according to law and justice, and not
for reward, friendship and relationship, consults the good of society
and of each individual; of society because it is thereby kept in
obedience to law and in the fear of transgressing it; and of the
individual because justice thereby triumphs over injustice. The merchant
who acts from honesty and not from deceit, consults the good of his
neighbor with whom he has business. It is the same with a common or
skilled workman, if he does his work rightly and honestly, and not
fraudulently and deceitfully. It is the same with all others, as with
captains and sailors, with farmers and servants.

<span class="margnote"><span id="423.">423.</span></span>

This is charity itself, because charity may be defined as doing good to
the neighbor daily and continually, not only to the neighbor
individually, but also to the neighbor collectively; and this can be
done only through what is good and just in the office, business, and
employment in which a man is engaged, and with those with whom he has
any dealings; for this is one's daily work, and when he is not doing it
it still occupies his mind continually, and he has it in thought and
intention. The man who thus practises charity, becomes more and more
charity in form; for justice and fidelity form his mind, and the
practice of these forms his body; and because of his form he gradually
comes to will and think only such things as pertain to charity. Such at
length come to be like those of whom it is said in the Word, that they
have the law written on their hearts. Nor do they place merit in their
works, because they do not think of merit but of duty-that it becomes a
citizen so to act. But a man can by no means of himself act from
spiritual justice and fidelity; for every man inherits from his parents
a disposition to do what is good and just for the sake of himself and
the world; but no man inherits a disposition to do it for the sake of
what is good and just; consequently, only he who worships the Lord, and
acts from Him when acting from himself, attains to spiritual charity,
and becomes imbued with it by the practice of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="424.">424.</span></span>

There are many who act justly and faithfully in their occupation, and
thus promote works of charity, and yet do not possess any charity in
themselves. But in these the love of self and the world predominates,
and not the love of heaven; or if, perchance, the love of heaven is
present, it is beneath the former love, like a servant under his master,
a common soldier under his officer, or a doorkeeper standing at the
door.

<span class="margnote"><span id="425.">425.</span></span>

IX\. THE BENEFACTIONS OF CHARITY ARE GIVING TO THE POOR AND RELIEVING
THE NEEDY, BUT WITH PRUDENCE. We must distinguish between the
obligations of charity and its benefactions. By the obligations of
charity those exercises of it that proceed directly from charity itself
are meant. These, as has just been shown, relate primarily to one's
occupation. But benefactions mean such acts of assistance as are given
apart from these obligations. These are called benefactions because
doing them is a matter of free choice and pleasure; and when done they
are regarded by the recipient simply as benefactions, and are bestowed
according to the reasons and intentions that the benefactor has in mind.
In common belief charity is nothing else than giving to the poor,
relieving the needy, caring for widows and orphans, contributing to the
building of hospitals, infirmaries, asylums, orphans' homes, and
especially of churches, and to their decorations and income. But most of
these things are not properly matters of charity, but extraneous to it.
Those who make charity itself to consist in such benefactions must needs
claim merit for these works; and although they may profess with their
lips that they do not wish them to be considered meritorious, still a
belief in their merit lurks within. This is clearly evident from the
conduct of such after death, when they recount their works, and demand
salvation as a reward. But the origin of their works and the resulting
quality of them is then inquired into, and if it is found that they
proceeded from pride or a striving for reputation, or from bare
generosity, or friendship, or merely natural inclination, or hypocrisy,
from that origin the works are judged, for the quality of the origin is
within the works. But genuine charity proceeds from those who are imbued
with charity because of the justice and judgment in the works, and they
do the works apart from any remuneration as an end, according to the
Lord's words in Luke (14:12-14). They also call such things as are
mentioned above, benefactions as well as duties, although they pertain
to charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="426.">426.</span></span>

It is known that some who perform these benefactions which present to
the world an image of charity, entertain the opinion and belief that
they have practiced works of charity, and look upon them as many in
popedom regard indulgences, as means whereby they are purified from
sins, and that they are worthy, as if regenerated, to have heaven
bestowed upon them, and yet they do not regard adultery, hatred,
revenge, fraud, and in general the lusts of the flesh, in which they
indulge at pleasure, as sins. But in that case what are these good works
but painted pictures of angels in company with devils, or boxes made of
lapis lazuli containing hydras? It is wholly otherwise when these
benefactions are done by those who shun the evils above mentioned as
hateful to charity. Nevertheless, these benefactions are advantageous in
many ways, especially giving to the poor and to beggars; for thereby
boys and girls, servants and maids, and in general all simple-minded
persons, are initiated into charity, for these are its externals whereby
such are trained in the practice of charity, for these are its
rudiments, and are then like unripe fruit. But with those who are
afterwards perfected in right knowledges respecting charity and faith,
these acts become like ripe fruit, and then they look upon those former
works, which were done in simplicity of heart, merely as what they owed
to others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="427.">427.</span></span>

At this day these benefactions are believed to be those proper acts of
charity that are meant in the Word by good works, because charity is
often described in the Word as giving to the poor, helping the needy,
and caring for widows and orphans. But hitherto it has not been known
that the Word in its letter makes mention only of the outer things of
worship, even the outermost things, and that these signify spiritual
things, which are internal (as may be seen above, in the chapter on the
Sacred Scripture, n. 193-209). From all this it is plain, that by the
poor, the needy, the widows and orphans there mentioned, such persons
are not meant, but those who are spiritually such. That the "poor" mean
those who are without knowledges of truth and good, may be seen in the
Apocalypse Revealed (n. 209) and that "widows" mean those who are
without truths and yet desire them (n. 764); and so on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="428.">428.</span></span>

Those who are by nature compassionate, and do not make their natural
compassion spiritual by putting it in practice in accordance with
genuine charity, believe that charity consists in giving to every poor
person, and relieving everyone who is in want, without first inquiring
whether the poor or needy person is good or bad; for they say that this
is not necessary, since God regards only the aid and alms. But after
death these are clearly distinguished and set apart from those who have
done the beneficent works of charity from prudence; for those who have
done them from that blind idea of charity, then do good to bad and good
alike, and with the aid of what is done for them the wicked do evil and
thereby injure the good. Such benefactors are partly to blame for the
injury done to the good. For doing good to an evil-doer is like giving
bread to a devil, which he turns into poison; for in the hands of the
devil all bread is poison, or if it is not, he turns it into poison by
using good deeds as allurements to evil. It is also like handing to an
enemy a sword with which he may kill some one; or like giving the
shepherd's staff to a wolfish man to guide the sheep to pasture, who,
after he has obtained it, drives them away from the pasture to a desert,
and there slaughters them; or like giving public authority to a robber,
who studies and watches for plunder only, according to the richness and
abundance of which he dispenses the laws and executes judgments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="429.">429.</span></span>

X. THERE ARE DUTIES OF CHARITY, SOME PUBLIC, SOME DOMESTIC, AND SOME
PRIVATE. The benefactions of charity and the duties of charity are
distinct, like the things done from choice and the things done from
compulsion. But by the duties of charity official duties in a kingdom or
state are not meant, as the duties of a minister to minister, of a judge
to judge, and so on, but the duties of everyone whatever his employment
may be. Thus these duties are from a different origin, and flow forth
from a different will, and are therefore done from charity by those who
have charity, and on the other hand from no charity by those who have no
charity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="430.">430.</span></span>

The public duties of charity are especially the payment of tribute and
taxes, which ought not to be confounded with official duties. Those who
are spiritual pay these with one disposition of heart, and those who are
merely natural with another. The spiritual pay them from good will,
because they are collected for the preservation of their country, and
for its protection and the protection of the church, also for the
administration of government by officials and governors, to whom
salaries and stipends must be paid from the public treasury. Those,
therefore, to whom their country and also the church are the neighbor,
pay their taxes willingly and cheerfully, and regard it as iniquitous to
deceive or defraud. But those to whom their country and the church are
not the neighbor pay them unwillingly and with resistance; and at every
opportunity defraud and withhold; for to such their own household and
their own flesh are the neighbor.

<span class="margnote"><span id="431.">431.</span></span>

The domestic duties of charity are those of the husband toward the wife,
and of the wife toward the husband, of fathers and mothers toward their
children, and of children towards their fathers and mothers, also the
duties of masters and mistresses towards servants, male and female, and
of the latter towards the former. These duties, because they are the
duties of education and management at home, are so numerous that if
recounted they would fill a volume. To the discharge of these duties
everyone is moved by a love different from that which moves him to
discharge the duties of his employment; husbands and wives are moved to
their duties towards each other by marriage love and according to it;
parents towards their children by the love implanted in everyone, called
parental love; and children towards their parents by and according to
another love which is closely connected with obedience from a sense of
duty. But the duties of masters and mistresses towards their servants,
male and female, have their source in the love of governing, and this
love is according to the state of each one's mind. \[2\] But marriage
love and the love of children, with the duties of these loves and the
practice of these duties, do not produce love to the neighbor as the
practice of the duties in one's employment does; for the love called
parental love exists equally with the bad and the good, and is sometimes
stronger with the bad; moreover, it exists in beasts and birds, in which
no charity can be formed. It is known that it exists with bears, tigers,
and serpents, as much as with sheep and goats, and with owls as much as
with doves. \[3\] As to the duties of parents to children in particular,
they are inwardly different with those who are in charity and those who
are not, although externally they appear alike. With those who are in
charity, that love is conjoined with love towards the neighbor and love
to God; for by such children are loved according to their morals,
virtues, good will, and qualifications for serving the public. But with
those who are not in charity, there is no conjunction of charity with
the love called parental love; consequently, many such parents love even
wicked, immoral, and crafty children more than the good, moral, and
discreet; thus they love those who are useless to the public, more than
those who are useful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="432.">432.</span></span>

The private duties of charity are also numerous, such as the payment of
wages to workmen, the payment of interest, the fulfillment of contracts,
the guarding of securities, and so on, some of which are duties enforced
by statute law, some by common law, and some by moral law. These duties
also are discharged by those who are in charity from one state of mind,
and by those who are not in charity from another state of mind. Those
who are in charity perform them justly and faithfully; for it is a
precept of charity that everyone should act justly and faithfully toward
all with whom he has any business or dealing (on which above, n.
422-425). But those who are not in charity discharge these same duties
very differently.

<span class="margnote"><span id="433.">433.</span></span>

XI\. THE DIVERSIONS OF CHARITY ARE DINNERS, SUPPERS, AND SOCIAL
GATHERINGS. It is known that dinners and suppers are everywhere
customary, and are given for various purposes, and that with most they
are given for the sake of friendship, relationship, enjoyment, gain, and
remuneration; also that they are employed for corrupting men and drawing
them over to certain parties; and that among the great they are given
for the sake of honor, and in kings' palaces for splendor. But dinners
and suppers of charity are given only among those who are in mutual love
from similarity of faith. With the Christians of the primitive church
dinners and suppers had no other object; they were called Feasts, and
were given both in order that they might heartily enjoy themselves, and
at the same time be drawn together. In the first state of the
establishment of the church suppers signified consociation and
conjunction, because evening, when they took place, signified that
state. But in the second state, when the church had been established,
there were dinners, for morning and day signified that state. At table
they conversed on various subjects, both domestic and civil, but
especially on such as pertained to the church. And because they were
feasts of charity, whatever subject they talked about, charity with its
delights and joys was in their speech. The spiritual sphere that
prevailed at those feasts was a sphere of love to the Lord and love
towards the neighbor, which cheered the mind of everyone, softened the
tone of every voice, and from the heart communicated festivity to all
the senses. For there emanates from every man a spiritual sphere, which
is a sphere of his love's affection and its thought therefrom, and this
interiorly affects his associates, especially at feasts. This sphere
emanates both through the face and through the respiration. It is
because dinners and suppers, or feasts, signified such association of
minds that they are so frequently mentioned in the Word, and nothing
else is there meant by them in the spiritual sense; and the same is
meant in the highest sense by the paschal supper among the children of
Israel, also by their banquet at other festivities, and by their eating
together of the sacrifices near the tabernacle. Conjunction itself was
then represented by the breaking and distribution of bread, and by
drinking from the same cup and handing it to another.

<span class="margnote"><span id="434.">434.</span></span>

As to social gatherings, they were composed in the primitive church of
such as called themselves brethren in Christ; they were therefore
assemblies of charity, because there was spiritual brotherhood. They
were also a consolation in the adversities of the church, seasons of
rejoicing on account of its increase, recreations of mind after study
and labor, and at the same time opportunities for conversation on
various subjects; and as they flowed from spiritual love as from a
fountain, they were rational and moral from a spiritual origin. There
are at this day assemblies of friendship, which regard as an end the
delights of sociability, the exhilaration of the mind by conversation,
the consequent expansion of the feelings and the liberation of
imprisoned thoughts, and thus the rekindling of the sensual faculties
and the renewal of their state. But as yet there are no gatherings of
charity; for the Lord says, In the end of the age (that is, at the end
of the church), iniquity will be multiplied and charity will grow cold
(Matt. 24:12). This is because the church has not yet acknowledged the
Lord God the Savior as the God of heaven and earth, and gone to Him
directly, from whom alone genuine charity goes forth and flows in. But
social gatherings where friendship emulating charity does not bring
minds together, are nothing but pretenses of friendship, deceptive
attestations of mutual love, seductive insinuations into favor, and
sacrifices offered to the delights of the body, especially the sensual,
whereby people are carried away like ships by sails and favoring
currents, while sycophants and hypocrites stand in the stem and hold the
helm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="435.">435.</span></span>

XII\. THE FIRST THING OF CHARITY IS TO PUT AWAY EVILS; AND THE SECOND IS
TO DO GOODS THAT ARE OF USE TO THE NEIGHBOR. In the doctrine of charity
this holds the first place, that the first thing of charity is not to do
evil to the neighbor; and to do good to him holds the second place. This
tenet is like a door to the doctrine of charity. It is admitted that
evil is firmly seated in every man's will from his birth; and as all
evil has relation to man both nearly and remotely, and also to society
and one's country, it follows that inherited evil is evil against the
neighbor in every degree. A man may see from reason itself, that so far
as the evil resident in the will is not put away, the good that he does
is impregnated with that evil; for evil is then inside the good, like a
kernel in its shell or like marrow in a bone; therefore although the
good that is done by such a man appears to be good, still intrinsically
it is not good; for it is like a healthy-looking shell containing a
worm-eaten kernel, or like a white almond rotten within, with streaks of
rottenness extending even to the surface. \[2\] Willing evil and doing
right are two essentially opposite things; for evil belongs to hatred
towards the neighbor and good belongs to love towards the neighbor, or
evil is the neighbor's enemy and good is his friend. These two cannot
exist in the same mind, that is, evil in the internal man and good in
the external; if they do, the good in the external is like a wound
superficially healed, within which there is putrid matter. Man is then
like a tree with a decayed root, which still produces fruit that
outwardly looks like well-flavored and useful fruit, but is inwardly
offensive and useless. He is also like rejected scoria, which, being
bright on the surface and beautifully colored, may be sold for precious
stones; in a word, he is like an owl's egg, which men are made to
believe to be a dove's egg. \[3\] Man ought to know that the good that a
man does by means of his body proceeds from his spirit, or out of his
internal man, the internal man being the spirit which lives after death.
Therefore when the man \[above described\] casts off the body which
formed his external man, all there is of him is in evils and takes
delight in them, and is averse to good as something inimical to his
life. \[4\] That until evil has been put away man cannot do good that is
good in itself the Lord teaches in many places: Men do not gather the
grape from thorns or figs from thistles. A corrupt tree cannot bring
forth good fruit (Matt. 7:16-18). Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
for ye cleanse the outside of the cup and the platter, but within they
are full of extortion and excess. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the
inside of the cup and of the platter, that the outside of them may
become clean also (Matt. 23:25-26). And in Isaiah: Wash you, put away
the evil of your doings, cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek
judgment. Then although your sins have been as scarlet, they shall
become as white as snow; although they have been red like crimson, they
shall be as wool (Isa. 1:16-18).

<span class="margnote"><span id="436.">436.</span></span>

This may be further illustrated by the following comparisons: One cannot
visit another who keeps a leopard and a panther shut up in his chamber
(living safely with them himself because he feeds them), until these
wild beasts have been removed. Who, when invited to the table of a king
and queen, does not, before he goes, wash his hands and face? Who does
not purify ores by fire and separate the dross before he obtains pure
gold and silver? Who does not separate the tares from the wheat, before
putting the wheat into his granary? Who does not prepare raw food by
cooking it before it is made eatable and placed upon the table? Who does
not beat the worms from the foliage of the trees in his garden, so that
the leaves may not be devoured and the fruit thereby destroyed? Who
loves and seeks to marry a maiden who is full of disease, and covered
with pimples and blotches, however she may paint her face, dress finely,
and labor by the charms of her conversation to affect him with the
enticements of love? Man himself ought to purify himself from evils
\[and not wait for the Lord to do this without his cooperation, see n.
331\]. Otherwise he would be like a servant, going to his master, with
his face and clothes befouled with soot or dung, and saying, "Master,
wash me." Would not his master answer him, "You foolish servant, what
are you saying? See, here are water, soap, and a towel; have you not
hands of your own and the power to use them? Wash yourself." And so the
Lord God will say, "These means of purification are from Me; and your
ability to will and do are also from Me; therefore use these My gifts
and endowments as your own, and you will be purified."

<span class="margnote"><span id="437.">437.</span></span>

At the present day it is believed that charity is simply doing good, and
that then one does not do evil; consequently that the first thing of
charity is to do good, and the second not to do evil. But it is wholly
the reverse; the first thing of charity is to put away evil, and the
second to do good; for it is a universal law in the spiritual world and
from that in the natural world also, that so far as one does not will
evil he wills good; thus that so far as he turns away from hell from
which all evil ascends, so far he turns towards heaven from which all
good descends; consequently also, that so far as anyone rejects the
devil he is accepted by the Lord. One cannot stand with his head
vibrating between the two, and pray to both at once; for of such the
Lord says: I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; would
that thou wert cold or hot. So because thou art lukewarm, and neither
cold nor hot, I will spit thee out of My mouth (Apoc. 3:15-16). Who can
skirmish with his troop between two armies, favoring both? Who can be
evilly disposed towards the neighbor, and at the same time well disposed
towards him? Does not evil then lie hidden in the good? Although the
evil that so hides itself does not appear in the man's acts, it
manifests itself in many things when they are reflected upon rightly.
The Lord says: No servant can serve two masters. . . . Ye cannot serve
God and mammon (Luke 16:13).

<span class="margnote"><span id="438.">438.</span></span>

But no one is able to purify himself from evils by his own power and his
own abilities; yet neither can it be done without the power and
abilities of man as if these were his own. If these were not as if they
were his own, no man would be able to fight against the flesh and its
lusts, which everyone is commanded to do; he would not even be able to
think of any combat, thus his mind would be opened to evils of every
sort, and would be restrained from them as deeds only by the laws of
justice established in the world, and their penalties; and thus he would
be inwardly like a tiger, a leopard, or a serpent, which never reflect
at all upon the cruel delights of their loves. From this it is clear
that as man, in contrast with wild beasts, is rational, he ought to
resist evils by the power and abilities given him by the Lord, which in
every sense appear to him to be his own; and this appearance has been
granted by the Lord to every man for the sake of regeneration,
imputation, conjunction, and salvation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="439.">439.</span></span>

XIII\. IN THE EXERCISES OF CHARITY MAN DOES NOT PLACE MERIT IN WORKS SO
LONG AS HE BELIEVES THAT ALL GOOD IS FROM THE LORD. To ascribe merit to
works that are done for the sake of salvation is harmful because evils
lie concealed in so doing of which the doer is wholly ignorant. There
also lies hid in it a denial of God's influx and operation in man; also
a confidence in one's own power in matters of salvation; faith in
oneself and not in God; self-justification; salvation by one's own
abilities; a reducing of Divine grace and mercy to nought; a rejection
of reformation and regeneration by Divine means; especially a limitation
of the merit and righteousness of the Lord God the Savior, which such
claim for themselves; together with a continual looking for reward,
which they regard as the first and last end; a submersion and extinction
of love to the Lord and love towards the neighbor; a total ignorance and
lack of perception of the delight of heavenly love as being without
merit, and a sense only of self-love. For those who put rewards in the
first place and salvation in the second, and who value salvation for the
sake of the reward, invert order and immerse the interior desires of the
mind in what is their own \[proprium\], and defile them in the body with
the evils of the flesh. This is why the good that claims merit appears
to the angels as rust, and the good that does not claim merit as purple.
That good ought not to be done for the sake of reward, the Lord teaches
in Luke: If ye do good to them who do good to you, what thank have ye?
But rather love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for
nothing again; and then your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons
of the Most High for He is kind unto the unthankful and the evil (Luke
6:33-35). And that man cannot do good that in itself is good, except
from the Lord, He teaches in John: Abide in Me, and I in you. As the
branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, so
neither can ye except ye abide in Me; for apart from Me ye can do
nothing (15:4, 5). And again, A man can receive nothing, except it be
given him from heaven (John 3:27).

<span class="margnote"><span id="440.">440.</span></span>

But to think about getting into heaven, and that good ought to be done
for that reason, is not to regard reward as an end and to ascribe merit
to works; for thus do those also think who love the neighbor as
themselves and God above all things; so thinking from faith in the
Lord's words, That their reward should be great in the heavens (Matt.
5:11, 12; 6:1; 10:41, 42; Luke 6:23, 35; 14:12-14; John 4:36); That
those who have done good shall possess as an inheritance a kingdom
prepared from the foundation of the world (Matt. 25:34); That everyone
is rewarded according to his works (Matt. 16:27; John 5:29; Rev. 14:13;
20:12, 13; Jer. 25:14; 32:19; Hosea 4:9; Zech. 1:6 and elsewhere). Such
do not trust to reward on the ground of their merit, but have faith in
the promise from grace. With such the delight of doing good to the
neighbor is their reward. This is the delight of the angels in heaven,
and it is a spiritual delight which is eternal, and immeasurably exceeds
all natural delight. Those who are in this delight are unwilling to hear
of merit, for they love to do, and in doing they perceive blessedness.
They are sad when it is believed that they work for the sake of
recompense. They are like those who do good to friends for the sake of
friendship, to brethren for the sake of brotherhood, to wife and
children for the sake of wife and children, and to their country for
their country's sake; thus from friendship and love. Those who do acts
of kindness also say and give evidence that they are doing this not on
their own behalf, but on behalf of the others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="441.">441.</span></span>

It is wholly different with those who regard reward as the essential end
in their works. These are like such as form friendships for the sake of
gain, and who make presents, perform services, and profess love
seemingly from the heart, but when they fail to obtain what they hoped
for, they turn about, renounce their friendship, and devote themselves
to the enemies of their former friends and to those who hate them. They
are also like nurses who suckle infants merely for wages, and in
presence of their parents kiss and fondle them; but as soon as they
cease to be fed with delicacies and rewarded just as they wish, they
turn against the infants, treat them harshly, beat them, and laugh at
their cries. \[2\] They are also like those whose regard for their
country springs from love of self and the world, and who say that they
are willing to give their property and their lives for it; and yet, if
they do not acquire honors and riches as rewards, they speak ill of
their country, and connect themselves with its enemies. They are also
like shepherds who care for sheep merely for hire, and if the hire is
not given when they wish it, drive the sheep with their crook from the
pasture to the desert. Like these again are priests who discharge the
duties of their office solely for the sake of the emoluments attached to
them, and who, evidently, regard as of little account the salvation of
the souls over whom they have been placed as guides. \[3\] It is the
same with magistrates who look only to the dignity of their office and
its revenues; and when they do right, it is not for the sake of the
public good, but for the sake of the delight in the love of self and the
world, which delight they breathe in as the only good. It is the same
with all the rest; the end in view carries every point, and the mediate
causes pertaining to the function are renounced if they do not promote
the end. \[4\] And the same is true of those who demand reward on the
ground of merit in matters of salvation. Such after death confidently
demand heaven; but when it has been found that they have no love to God
or love towards the neighbor, they are sent back to those who can
instruct them concerning charity and faith; and if they repudiate their
instructions, they are sent away to their like, among whom are some who
are enraged against God because they do not obtain rewards, and who call
faith a mere figment of reason. Such are meant in the Word by
"hirelings," who were allotted service of the lowest kind in the outer
courts of the temple. At a distance they appear to be splitting wood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="442.">442.</span></span>

It must be well understood that charity and faith in the Lord are
closely conjoined, consequently, such as the faith is such is the
charity. That the Lord, charity, and faith make one, like life, will,
and understanding \[in man\], and if they are divided each perishes like
a pearl reduced to powder, may be seen above (n. 362-363); and that
charity and faith are together in good works (n. 373-377). From this it
follows that such as faith is, such is charity, and that such as charity
and faith are together, such are works. If then there is a faith that
all the good that a man does as if of himself is from the Lord, man is
the instrumental cause of that good, and the Lord the principal cause,
which two causes appear to man to be one, and yet the principal cause is
the all in all of the instrumental cause. From this it follows that when
a man believes that all good that is good in itself is from the Lord, he
does not ascribe merit to works; and in the degree in which this faith
is perfected in man, the fantasy about merit is taken away from him by
the Lord. In this state man enters fully into the exercise of charity
with no anxiety about merit, and at length perceives the spiritual
delight of charity, and then begins to be averse to merit as a something
harmful to his life. The sense of merit is easily washed away by the
Lord with those who become imbued with charity by acting justly and
faithfully in the work, business, or function in which they are engaged,
and towards all with whom they have any dealings (see above, n.
422-424). But the sense of merit is removed with difficulty from those
who believe that charity is acquired by giving alms and relieving the
needy; for when they do these things, in their minds they desire reward,
at first openly and then secretly, and draw to themselves merit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="443.">443.</span></span>

XIV\. WHEN MORAL LIFE IS AT THE SAME TIME SPIRITUAL, IT IS CHARITY.
Every man is taught by his parents and teachers to live morally, that
is, to act the part of a good citizen, to discharge the duties of an
honorable life (which relate to the various virtues that are the
essentials of an honorable life), and to bring them forth through the
formalities of an honorable life, which are called proprieties; and as
he advances in years he is taught to add to these what is rational, and
thereby to perfect what is moral in his life. For in children, even to
early youth, moral life is natural, and becomes afterwards more and more
rational. Anyone who reflects well upon it can see that a moral life is
the same as a life of charity, and that this is to act rightly towards
the neighbor, and to so regulate the life as to preserve it from
contamination by evils; this follows from what has been shown above (n.
435-438). And yet, in the first period of life, a moral life is a life
of charity in outermosts, that is, it is merely the outer and foremost
part of it, not the inner part. \[2\] For there are four periods of life
through which man passes from infancy to old age; the first is when he
acts from others according to instructions; the second, when he acts
from himself, under the guidance of the understanding; the third, when
the will acts upon the understanding, and the understanding regulates
the will; and the fourth, when he acts from confirmed principle and
deliberate purpose. But these periods of life are the periods of the
life of a man's spirit, not in like manner of his body; for the body can
act morally and speak rationally while its spirit is willing and
thinking opposite things. That this is the nature of the natural man is
obvious in the case of pretenders, flatterers, liars, and hypocrites.
These evidently enjoy a double mind, that is, their minds are divided
into two discordant minds. It is otherwise with those who will rightly
and think rationally, and consequently act rightly and talk rationally.
These are meant in the Word by the "simple in spirit;" they are called
simple, because they are not double-minded. \[3\] From all this it can
be seen what is meant specifically by the external man; also that, from
the morality of the external man, no one can form any conclusion as to
the morality of the internal, since this may be turned in an opposite
direction, and may hide itself as a tortoise hides its head within its
shell, or as a serpent hides its head in its coil. For such a so-called
moral man is like a robber in a city and in a forest, acting the part of
a moral person in the city, but of a plunderer in the forest. It is
wholly otherwise with those who are moral inwardly or in the spirit,
which they become through regeneration by the Lord. These are meant by
the spiritually-moral.

<span class="margnote"><span id="444.">444.</span></span>

Moral life, when it is also spiritual, is a life of charity, because the
practices of a moral life and of charity are the same; for charity is
willing rightly towards the neighbor, and consequently acting rightly
towards him; and this is also moral life. The spiritual law is this law
of the Lord: All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you,
do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets (Matt.
7:12). This same law is the universal law of moral life. But to recount
all the works of charity, and to compare them with the works of moral
life, would fill many pages; let the six commandments of the second
table of the Decalogue serve for illustration. It is evident to everyone
that these are precepts of moral life. That they include everything
relating to love to the neighbor, may be seen above (n. 329-331). That
charity is the fulfilling of all these precepts, is evident from the
following in Paul: Love one another; for he that loveth another hath
fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt
not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou
shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment it is summed up
in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. Charity
worketh no ill to his neighbor; charity is the fulfilling of the law
(Rom. 13:8-10). He who thinks from the external man only, cannot but
wonder that the seven commandments of the second table were promulgated
by Jehovah on Mount Sinai with so great a miracle; when yet these same
precepts, in all the kingdoms of the world, consequently also in Egypt
whence the children of Israel had lately come, were the precepts of the
law of civil justice, for without them no kingdom can continue to exist.
But they were promulgated by Jehovah, and were, moreover, written by His
finger on tables of stone, in order that they might be not only the
precepts of civil society, and therefore of natural-moral life, but also
the precepts of heavenly society, and therefore of spiritual-moral life;
so that acting contrary to them would be not only acting in opposition
to men, but also to God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="445.">445.</span></span>

Viewing moral life in its essence, it can be seen that it is a life that
is in accordance both with human laws and with Divine laws; therefore he
who lives in accordance with these two laws as one law is a truly moral
man, and his life is charity. Anyone, if he will, can understand from
external moral life the nature of charity. Only transfer external moral
life, such as prevails in civil communities, over into the internal man,
so that in its will and thought there may be a likeness and conformity
to the acts in the external, and you will see charity in its true image.

<span class="margnote"><span id="446.">446.</span></span>

XV\. A FRIENDSHIP OF LOVE, CONTRACTED WITH A MAN WITHOUT REGARD TO HIS
SPIRITUAL QUALITY, IS DETRIMENTAL AFTER DEATH. A friendship of love
means interior friendship, which is such that not only is the man's
external man loved but his internal also, and this without scrutiny into
the quality of his internal or spirit, that is, into his mind's
affections, as to whether these spring from love towards the neighbor
and love to God, and are thus adapted to association with angels of
heaven, or whether they spring from a love opposed to the neighbor and a
love opposed to God, and are thus adapted to association with devils.
Such friendship is contracted in many instances from various causes and
for various purposes. It is distinct from external friendship, which
relates only to the person and exists for the sake of various bodily and
sensual delights, and for the sake of mutual interaction in various
ways. This kind of friendship may be formed with anyone, even with the
clown who jokes at the table of a nobleman. This is called friendship
simply; but the former is called the friendship of love, because
friendship is natural conjunction, while love is spiritual conjunction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="447.">447.</span></span>

That the friendship of love is detrimental after death, can be seen from
the state of heaven, of hell, and of man's spirit in relation to them.
As to the state of heaven, it is divided into innumerable societies
according to all the varieties of affections of the love of good; while
hell, on the other hand, is divided according to all the varieties of
affections of the love of evil; and after death, man, who is then a
spirit, is at once adjudged, according to his life in the world, to the
society where his ruling love prevails - to some heavenly society, if
love to God and love towards the neighbor has formed the head of his
loves, and to some infernal society, if love of self and the world has
formed the head of his loves. Immediately after his entrance into the
spiritual world, which is effected through the death of the material
body and its rejection to the sepulchre, man for some time undergoes a
preparation for the society to which he has been adjudged, which
preparation is effected by the rejection of such loves as are not in
accord with his chief love. Thus one is then separated from another,
friend from friend, dependent from patron, also parent from children,
and brother from brother; and each one of these is connected with those
interiorly like himself, with whom he is to live to eternity a life in
common with them and yet properly his own. Nevertheless, during the
first period of the preparation they all come together, and converse in
a friendly way, as in the world. But little by little they are
separated, and in ways they are not sensible of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="448.">448.</span></span>

But those who in the world have contracted with each other friendships
of love cannot be separated like others in accordance with order, and
adjudged to societies correspondent to their lives; for they are bound
together interiorly as to the spirit, nor can they be torn apart,
because they are like scions ingrafted into branches; consequently, if
one as to his interiors is in heaven, and the other as to his interiors
in hell, they stick together much as a sheep tied to a wolf, or a goose
to a fox, or a dove to a hawk; and he whose interiors are in hell
breathes his infernalism into the other whose interiors are in heaven.
For among the things well known in heaven is this, that evils may be
breathed into the good, but not goods into the evil; and for this reason
that everyone is in evils by birth; and in consequence, the interiors of
the good, who are thus joined fast to the evil, are closed, and both are
thrust down to hell, where the good spirit suffers severely, but
finally, after a lapse of time, he is released, and only then begins his
preparation for heaven. It has been granted me to see spirits so bound
together, especially brothers and relatives, also patrons and their
dependents, and many with flatterers, the two having contrary affections
and diverse inclinations. I have seen some who were like kids with
leopards, who were kissing each other and swearing to maintain their
former friendship; and I then perceived that the good were absorbing the
delights of the evil, holding each other by the hand and entering caves
where crowds of the evil appeared in their hideous forms, although to
themselves, owing to the illusions of phantasy, they seemed lovely. But
after a while I heard from the good cries of fear, as if they were in
snares, and from the evil rejoicings, like those of enemies over spoils;
besides other sad scenes; and I was told that when the good had been
released they were prepared for heaven by means of reformation, but not
so easily as others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="449.">449.</span></span>

It is wholly different with those who love the good in another, that is,
who love justice, judgment, sincerity, and benevolence arising from
charity, and especially with those who love faith in the Lord and love
to Him. Because these love the things within man apart from the things
without, when they do not discover the same things in the person after
death, they at once withdraw from the friendship and are associated by
the Lord with those who are in like good. It should be said that no one
is able to explore the interiors of the mind of those with whom he
associates or deals; and this is not necessary; only let him guard
against a friendship of love with anyone. External friendship for the
sake of various uses does no harm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="450.">450.</span></span>

XVI\. THERE IS SPURIOUS CHARITY, HYPOCRITICAL CHARITY, AND DEAD CHARITY.
There is no genuine, that is, living charity, except that which makes
one with faith, and the two look conjointly to the Lord; for these
three, the Lord, charity, and faith, are the three essentials of
salvation, and when they make one, charity is charity, and faith is
faith; and the Lord is in them and they are in the Lord (see above, n.
363-367, and n. 368-372). On the other hand, when these three are not
conjoined, charity is either spurious, or hypocritical, or dead. In
Christianity since its establishment there have been various heresies,
even down to the present day, in each of which these three essentials,
God, charity, and faith, have been and still are acknowledged; for apart
from these three, there is no religion. As to charity in particular, it
may be joined to any heretical belief, as with that of the Socinians,
the Enthusiasts, the Jews, and even to the faith of idolaters; and they
may all believe it to be charity, since it appears like it in the
external form. Nevertheless, the quality of charity is changed in
accordance with the faith to which it is joined, as may be seen in the
chapter on Faith.
