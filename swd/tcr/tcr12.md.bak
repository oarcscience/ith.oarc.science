### True Christian Religion

To adore as God some vicar on earth, or to invoke as God some saint, has
no more weight in heaven than to make supplication to the sun, moon, and
stars, or to ask for a response from a diviner and believe what he puts
forth, which is idle. It would be also like worshiping a temple, and not
worshiping God in the temple; it would be like supplicating a king's
servant carrying the scepter and crown in his hand, for the honors of
glory, instead of the king himself; and this would be as useless as
trying to kiss the splendor of purple, renown, light, the golden rays of
the sun, or a mere name, apart from their subjects. For those who do
such things are these words in John: We abide in the truth in Jesus
Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, guard
yourselves from idols (1 John 20-21).

X. ACTUAL REPENTANCE IS EASY FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOW AND THEN PRACTISED
IT, BUT IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT TASK FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT. Actual
repentance is to examine oneself, to recognize one's sins, to confess
them before God, and thus to begin a new life; this is in accord with
the previous description of it. To the Reformed Christian world (meaning
by this all those who are separate from the church of Rome, and also to
those attached to that church who have not practiced actual repentance),
this repentance is a very difficult task. This is because some are
unwilling and some are afraid to practice it; and continued neglect
establishes a habit, induces unwillingness, and at length gains the
endorsement of the reasoning intellect, and this with some produces
sadness, dread, and terror at the thought of repentance. Actual
repentance is so extremely difficult in the Reformed Christian world
chiefly because of their belief that repentance and charity contribute
nothing to salvation, but faith alone, from the imputation of which
forgiveness of sins, justification, renovation, regeneration,
sanctification, and eternal salvation follow. Moreover, their dogmatic
writers say that man's cooperation of himself, or as if of himself, is
useless, is an obstacle to Christ's merit, and is repugnant and
injurious to it. And this idea is implanted in the minds of the common
people, although they are ignorant of the mysteries of that faith,
merely by the sayings, that "faith alone saves," and who can possibly do
good of himself?" For this reason: repentance among the Reformed is like
a nest of young birds deprived of the parent birds, which have been
captured and killed by the fowler. To this another reason may be added,
that a so-called Reformed Christian is associated in the spiritual world
as to his spirit, only with such as are like himself, who introduce such
things into the ideas of his thought, and lead him away from the very
first step toward self-inspection and self-examination.

<span class="margnote"><span id="562.">562.</span></span>

I have asked many of the Reformed in the spiritual world, why they did
not practice actual repentance, when it was enjoined upon them both in
the Word and at baptism, as also before the holy communion in all their
churches. They made various replies. Some said that contrition with a
lip-confession that they were sinners, is sufficient; some that such
repentance, because it takes place while man is acting from his own
will, is not consistent with the generally accepted faith. Others said,
"How can anyone examine himself, when he knows that he is nothing but
sin? This would be like casting a net into a lake filled from bottom to
top with mud containing noxious worms." Others said, "Who can look into
himself so deeply as to see in himself Adam's sin, from which all his
actual evils flow? Are not both kinds of evil washed away by the water
of baptism, and removed or covered up by the merit of Christ? What then
is repentance but a requirement, which sadly disturbs the conscientious?
By the Gospel are we not under grace, and not under the hard law of that
repentance?" and so on. Some said, that whenever they undertake to
examine themselves, dread and terror fill their minds as if they saw a
monster near their bed in the morning twilight. From all this the
reasons are made clear why actual repentance in the Reformed Christian
world has become rusty, as it were, and is discarded. \[2\] In the
presence of these persons I also asked some who adhered to the Roman
Catholic religion about their actual confession to their ministers,
whether it was difficult. They replied, that after they had been
initiated into it they were not afraid to recount their trespasses to a
confessor who was not severe, that they gathered them up with a kind of
pleasure, telling the lighter ones cheerfully, and the more serious
somewhat timidly; also from habit they freely returned annually to their
appointed confession, and, after receiving absolution, to festivity;
moreover, that they look upon all who are not willing to disclose the
defilements of their hearts, as impure. Hearing this, the Reformed who
were present hastened away, some deriding and laughing, some astounded
and yet commending. \[3\] Afterward some drew near who belonged to that
same church, but had lived in Protestant countries, who, according to
the usage there established, did not make a special confession, as their
brethren do elsewhere, but a general confession to one who held the keys
for them. These said that they were utterly unable to examine
themselves, to trace out and set forth their actual evils and the
secrets of their thoughts; and that they felt this to be as repugnant
and terrifying as an attempt to cross a ditch to a rampart where an
armed soldier stands and cries, "Keep back." From all this it is now
clear that actual repentance is easy to those who at times practice it,
but is extremely difficult to those who have not practiced it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="563.">563.</span></span>

It is known that habit is a second nature, and that therefore what is
easy for one is difficult for another; and this is true of
self-examination and a confession of what is thereby discovered. What is
easier for a hired laborer, a porter, or a farmer, than to work with his
hands from morning till evening, while a gentleman or a delicate person
could not do the same work for half an hour without fatigue and
sweating? It is easy for a footman with a staff and easy boots to pursue
his way for miles, while one accustomed to ride can hardly run slowly
from one street to another. Every mechanic who is attentive to his task
goes through it easily and willingly, and when he leaves it, longs to
return; while another, who understands the same trade, but is indolent,
can scarcely be driven to work. The same is true of everyone, whatever
may be his office or pursuit. To one diligent in piety, what is easier
than to pray to God? while to one who is a slave to impiety, what is
more difficult, and vice versa? What priest, preaching before a king for
the first time, does not feel timid? but after doing it frequently he
goes through boldly. What is easier for an angelic man than to raise his
eyes to heaven, or for a devilish man than to cast them down toward
hell? But if the latter becomes a hypocrite, he too can look up to
heaven, but his heart is turned away. Everyone becomes imbued with the
end he has in view and the habit arising therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="564.">564.</span></span>

XI\. ONE WHO HAS NEVER REPENTED OR HAS NEVER LOOKED INTO AND SEARCHED
HIMSELF, FINALLY CEASES TO KNOW WHAT DAMNING EVIL OR SAVING GOOD IS. As
few in the Reformed Christian world practice repentance, this is here
added, that he who has not looked into and searched himself, finally
ceases to know what damning evil or saving good is, because he has no
religion from which to know it; for the evil that a man does not see,
recognize, and acknowledge, remains; and whatever remains becomes more
and more enrooted, until it obstructs the interiors of the mind, whereby
man becomes first natural, then sensual, and finally corporeal, and in
such states he knows not any damning evil or saving good. He becomes
like a tree growing on a hard rock, which spreads its roots among the
crevices and finally withers away from lack of moisture. \[2\] Every man
rightly educated is rational and moral; but there are two ways to
rationality, one from the world and the other from heaven. He who has
become rational and moral from the world only, and not from heaven, is
rational and moral in word and gesture only, but is inwardly a beast,
and even a wild beast, because he acts as one with those who are in
hell, where all are wild beasts. But he who is rational and moral from
heaven also, is truly rational and moral, because he is so at once in
spirit, word, and body; the spiritual being within these two latter like
a soul actuating the natural, sensual, and corporeal; it also acts as
one with those who are in heaven. Therefore there can be a
spiritual-rational and moral man, and also a merely natural-rational and
moral man. These two are not distinguished from each other in the world,
especially if the man has by practice become imbued with hypocrisy; but
they are distinguished by the angels in heaven as easily as doves from
owls or sheep from tigers. \[3\] The merely natural man can see good and
evil in others, and also rebuke others; but not having looked into and
examined himself, he does not see any evil in himself, and if any is
discovered by another, he cloaks it by means of his rationality; as a
serpent hides his head in the dust, and immerses himself in it, as a
hornet buries himself in mud. This is done by the delight of evil, which
encompasses him as a fog does a marsh, absorbing and extinguishing the
rays of light. Infernal delight is no other. It is exhaled from hell,
and flows into every man, into the soles of his feet, his back, and his
occiput; and when it is received by the head in the forehead and by the
body in the breast, man is made a slave to hell; and for the reason that
the human cerebrum is devoted to the understanding and the wisdom it
contains, but the cerebellum to the will and its love. This is why there
are two brains. But that infernal delight can be corrected, reformed,
and inverted solely by the spiritual-rational and moral.

<span class="margnote"><span id="565.">565.</span></span>

There shall now be given a brief description of the merely
natural-rational and moral man, who viewed in himself is sensual, and if
he goes on, becomes corporeal or fleshly; but the description shall be
sketched in separate statements. The sensual is the outmost of the life
of man's mind, adherent to and coherent with his five bodily senses. He
is called a sensual man who judges of everything from the bodily senses,
and believes nothing but what he can see with his eyes and touch with
his hands, calling that something real, and rejecting everything else.
The interiors of his mind, which have their vision from the light of
heaven, are closed, so that he sees nothing of the truth that relates to
heaven and the church. Such a man thinks in outermosts, and not
interiorly from any spiritual light, because he is in gross natural
light; therefore he is interiorly opposed to the things that pertain to
heaven and the church, although outwardly he can speak in favor of them,
even zealously, in proportion to his hope of gaining power and wealth by
means of them. Men of learning and erudition, who have confirmed
themselves deeply in falsities, and still more those who have confirmed
themselves against the truths of the Word, are more sensual than others.
\[2\] Sensual men reason acutely and skillfully, because their thought
is so near to speech as to be almost in it, as it were, on the lips;
also because they ascribe all intelligence to the speech that is from
memory alone. Moreover, they can dexterously confirm falsities, and
after confirming them they believe them to be true; but their reasoning
and confirmation are from the fallacies of the senses, which captivate
and persuade the common people. Sensual men are more cunning and
malicious than others. The avaricious, adulterous, and crafty are
especially sensual, although to the world they seem talented. The
interiors of their minds are vile and filthy; by these they communicate
with the hells; in the Word they are called dead. Those who are in the
hells are sensual, and more so the more deeply they are in them; and the
sphere of infernal spirits conjoins itself from behind with man's
sensual. In the light of heaven their occiput seems hollow. Those who
reasoned from sensual things only, were called by the ancients serpents
of the tree of knowledge. \[3\] Sensual things ought to occupy the last
place, not the first; and in a wise and intelligent man they do occupy
the last place, and are subordinate to things interior; but in a foolish
man they occupy the first place, and are predominant. When things
sensual occupy the last place, a way is opened by means of them to the
understanding, and truths are perfected by the method of extraction.
Such sensual things stand most near to the world, and admit what flows
to them from the world, and, as it were, sift it. By means of sensual
things man communicates with the world, and by means of rational things
with heaven. Sensual things supply what is of service to the interiors
of the mind. There are sensual things that supply what is serviceable
both to the intellectual and to the voluntary part. Unless thought is
raised above sensual things man has but little wisdom. When man's
thought is raised above sensual things, he comes into a clearer light,
and at length into heavenly light, and then he has a perception of such
things as flow down from heaven. The outmost of the understanding is the
natural knowing faculty, and the outmost of the will is sensual delight.

<span class="margnote"><span id="566.">566.</span></span>

As to his natural man, man is like a beast; he acquires the image of a
beast by means of life. Consequently in the spiritual world there appear
about such a man beasts of all kinds, which are correspondences. For
man's natural, viewed in itself, is purely animal; but because there is
a spiritual superadded, he can become a man; and if he does not become a
man from the capacity to become so, he can counterfeit one, although he
is then only a talking beast; for he talks from the natural-rational,
but thinks from spiritual insanity, and he acts from natural morality,
but loves from a spiritual satyriasis. His actions, seen by a
spiritually rational man, are but little different from the dance of one
bitten by a tarantula, or that called St. Vitus' dance, or the dance of
St. Guy. Who does not know that a hypocrite can talk about God, a robber
about honesty, an adulterer about chastity, and so on. But unless man
had the ability to shut and open the door between his thoughts and his
words, and between his intentions and his actions, and unless prudence
or cunning were the doorkeeper, he would rush into crimes and cruelties
more fiercely than any wild beast. But in every man after death that
door is opened; and then what he has been is apparent; but he is kept
under restraint by punishments and confinements in hell. Therefore, kind
reader, look into yourself, and find out one or another evil that is in
you, and from religion dismiss it. If you dismiss evils from any other
purpose or end, you do so only that they may not appear before the
world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="567.">567.</span></span>

To all this the following Memorable Relations shall be added. First: I
was suddenly seized with a disease almost deadly; my whole head was
oppressed; a pestilential smoke was let into it from the Jerusalem which
is called: Sodom and Egypt (Rev. 11:8). I was half dead with the fierce
pain; I expected my end. In this state I lay in my bed for three days
and a half. My spirit was brought into that condition, and from it my
body. Then I heard about me the voices of some, who said, "Behold, he
who preached repentance for the forgiveness of sins and Christ as alone
man, lies dead in the street of our city." And they asked some of the
clergy whether that man was worthy of burial; and they answered, "No;
let him lie and be looked at." And they kept going, and coming, and
scoffing. Of a truth this so happened to me while explaining the
eleventh chapter of The Apocalypse. Then harsh remarks were heard from
the scoffers, especially these "How can man repent without faith? How
can the man Christ be adored as God? Since we are saved freely without
any merit of our own, what need is there of anything except the faith
only that God the Father sent the Son to take away the damnation of the
law, to impute to us His merit, and so justify us before Him, absolve us
from our sins by the declaration of a priest, and then give us the Holy
Spirit to work in us all good? Is this not in accordance with Scripture
and also in accordance with reason?" At this the crowd that stood by
applauded. \[2\] I heard this and was unable to reply, because I lay
almost dead. But after three days and a half my spirit recovered, and in
spirit I went out on the street into the city and said again, "Repent,
and believe in Christ, and your sins will be forgiven, and you will be
saved; otherwise, you will perish. Did not the Lord Himself preach
repentance for the forgiveness of sins, and that they should believe in
Him? Did He not command His disciples to preach the same? Does not
complete unconcern about life follow the dogma of your faith?" But they
said, "What nonsense! Has not the Son made satisfaction? Does not the
Father impute this to us? We who believe this He justifies; thus we are
led by the spirit of grace. What then is sin in us, and what is death
with us? Preacher of sin and repentance, do you understand this gospel?"
Then a voice came forth out of heaven, saying, "What is the faith of an
impenitent man but a dead faith? The end has come, the end has come upon
you, unconcerned, blameless in your own eyes, justified in your own
belief, satans." Then suddenly a chasm was opened in the midst of the
city; it widened; house after house fell into it, and they were
swallowed up; and straightway water welled up from the wide gulf and
overflowed the waste. \[3\] When they had thus sunk down and been
apparently overflowed, I was wishing to know their lot in the abyss, and
I was told from heaven, "You shall see and hear." And then the waters by
which they seemed to be overflowed disappeared before my eyes; for
waters in the spiritual world are correspondences, and therefore appear
about those who are in falsities - I then saw them in the sandy bottom,
where heaps of stones were piled, among which they were running about
and lamenting that they had been cast out of their great city. They
shouted and cried out, "Why has this come upon us? Are we not, by our
faith, clean, pure, just, and holy? Are we not, by our faith, cleansed,
purified, justified and sanctified?" And others cried out, "Are we not,
by our faith, made such that before God the Father we appear, are seen,
and are reputed, and before the angels are declared to be clean, pure,
just and holy? Have we not been reconciled, propitiated, expiated, and
therefore absolved, washed, and cleansed from sin? Has not the
condemnation of the law been taken away by Christ? Why, then, have we
been cast down into this place as if damned? We heard a bold preacher
against sin say in our great city, 'Believe in Christ, and repent.' Have
we not believed in Christ, since we have believed in His merit? Have we
not, repented, since we have confessed that we are sinners? Why then has
this befallen us?" \[4\] Then was heard a voice from one side saying to
them, "Do you know of anyone sin in which you are? Have you ever
examined yourselves, and consequently shunned any evil as a sin against
God? He who does not shun evil is in evil. Is not sin the devil?
Therefore you are those of whom the Lord says: Then shall ye begin to
say, We have eaten and drunk before Thee, and Thou hast taught in our
streets. But He will say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;
depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity (Luke 13:26, 27; as also
those of whom He speaks, Matt. 7:22, 23). Away, therefore, each to his
own place. You see openings in the caverns; enter, and to each one of
you will be given his own task to be done, and then food in proportion
to your work. If you do not, hunger will soon compel you to go in."
\[5\] Afterward there came a voice out of heaven to some on the earth
who were outside of that great city (who also are spoken of in Rev.
11:13), saying loudly, "Beware, beware of affiliation with such spirits.
Can you not understand that the evils which are called sins and
iniquities render man unclean and impure? How can man be cleansed and
purified from them except by actual repentance, and by faith in the Lord
Jesus Christ?" "Actual repentance is to examine oneself, to recognize
and acknowledge one's sins, to hold oneself guilty, to confess sins
before the Lord, to pray for help and power to resist them, and thus
refrain from them and begin a new life; and all this you must do as if
of yourselves. Do so once or twice a year, when you come to the holy
communion; and afterward, whenever the sins of which you have found
yourselves guilty recur, say to yourselves, 'We will not do this because
it is a sin against God.' This is actual repentance. \[6\] Who cannot
understand that he who does not examine and see his sins remains in
them? For every evil is delightful to a man from his birth; it is
delightful to him to take revenge, to commit whoredom, to defraud, to
blaspheme, and especially to exercise dominion from self-love; and does
not this delight prevent your seeing these sins? And if, perchance, you
are told that they are sins, do you not from their delight excuse them,
and even prove to yourselves by means of falsities that they are not
sins? And, therefore, you remain in them, and afterward commit them more
frequently than before, and this even until you do not know what sin is,
or indeed whether there is any such thing. With anyone who actually
repents it is different. His evils, such as he has recognized and
acknowledged, he calls sins, and therefore begins to shun them and turn
away from them; and finally to feel their delight to be undelightful.
And so far as this is done he sees and loves good, and at length feels
the delight of good, which is the delight of the angels of heaven. In a
word, so far as anyone puts the devil behind him, he is accepted by the
Lord, and is taught, led, withheld from evil, and kept in good by Him;
and this is the way, and the only way, from hell to heaven." \[7\] It is
wonderful that with the Reformed there is a certain enrooted objection,
repugnance, and aversion to actual repentance, which is so great as to
prevent their compelling themselves to examine themselves, to see their
sins, and to confess them before God; it is as if horror seized them
when this is proposed. In the spiritual world I have asked very many
about this, and they all have declared that it was beyond their power.
When they have heard that this is still done by the papists, that is,
that they examine themselves, and openly confess their sins to a monk,
they have been very much astonished, and especially that the Reformed
could not even do this in secret before God, although it is equally
enjoined upon them before they come to the holy supper. Some there
wished to know why this is so; and they found that such a state of
impenitence and such a heart are induced by faith alone. Then it was
granted them to see that those Roman Catholics who worship Christ and do
not invoke saints are saved. \[8\] After this, something like thunder
was heard, and a voice speaking from heaven, saying, "We are amazed. Say
to the assembly of the Reformed, 'Believe in Christ, repent, and you
will be saved. '" This I said, adding also, "Is not baptism a sacrament
of repentance, and therefore introduction into the church? What do the
sponsors promise for him who is about to be baptized, but that he will
renounce the devil and his works? Is not the holy supper a sacrament of
repentance, and thus introduction into heaven? Are not communicants told
by all means to repent before coming to it? Does not the catechism, the
doctrine of the entire Christian church, teach repentance? Is it not
there said, in the six commandments of the second table, Thou shalt not
do this or that evil, and not, Thou shalt do this or that good? From
this you may know that so far as anyone renounces evil and turns away
from it, so far he is moved by and loves good, and until then does not
know what good is, nor even what evil is."

<span class="margnote"><span id="568.">568.</span></span>

Second Memorable Relation: What pious and wise man does not wish to know
his life's lot after death? I will therefore set forth plainly some
general truths in order that it may be known. Every man, when, after
death, he feels that he is still alive, and that he is in another world,
and hears that heaven, where there are eternal joys, is above him, and
hell, where there are eternal sorrows, is beneath him, is at first
remitted into his externals, in which he was in the former world; and he
then believes that he is certainly going to heaven, and talks
intelligently and acts prudently. And some then say, "We have lived
morally, we have pursued honesty, we have not done evil purposely."
Others say, "We have frequented churches, heard masses, kissed sacred
images, and on our knees poured out prayers." Others again, "We have
given to the poor, helped the needy, read pious books, and also the
Word," with other like things. \[2\] But when they have said these
things, angels approach and say, "All that you have mentioned you have
done in externals, but you do not yet know what you are in your
internals. You are now spirits in a substantial body, and the spirit is
your internal man. It is this in you that thinks what it wills and wills
what it loves; and that is the delight of its life. Every man from
infancy begins life from externals, and learns to act morally and talk
intelligently; and when he begins to gain some idea of heaven and its
happiness, he begins to pray, to frequent churches, and to observe the
solemnities of worship; and yet when evils spring forth from their
native fountain, he hides them in his mind's bosom, and also ingeniously
covers them over with reasonings from fallacies to such an extent that
he does not even know that evil is evil. And then because the evils are
veiled over and covered up as it were with dust, he thinks no more about
them, except to guard against their appearing before the world. Thus he
endeavors merely to lead a moral life in externals, and thus he becomes
a double man, a sheep in externals, and a wolf in internals; and he is
like a golden box containing poison, or like a man with a foul breath
holding something aromatic in his mouth to prevent those near him from
perceiving it; or he is like a mouse's skin that smells of balsam. \[3\]
You said that you had lived morally, and had followed pious pursuits;
but tell me, have you ever examined your internal man and there
perceived any lusting after revenge even to murder, after libidinous
living even to adultery, after defrauding even to theft, after lying
even to false witness? In four of the commandments of the Decalogue it
is said, Thou shalt not do these things, and in the two last, Thou shalt
not lust after them. Do you believe that in these things your internal
man has been like your external? If you do you are perhaps deceived."
\[4\] To this they replied, "What is the internal man? Is not the
internal and the external one and the same? We have heard from our
ministers that the internal man is nothing but faith, and that oral
piety and a morality of life are the signs of it, because they are its
operation." To this the angels answered, "Saving faith is in the
internal man, and charity likewise; and from them come Christian
fidelity and morality in the external man. But if the above mentioned
lusts remain in the internal man, thus in the will and therefrom in the
thought, and if in consequence you love these things interiorly, and yet
act and speak otherwise in externals, evil is then with you above good,
and good below evil; consequently, however you may talk as if from the
understanding, and act from love, evil is within and thus is veiled
over; and then you are like cunning apes which perform actions like
those of men, but the human heart is wholly lacking. \[5\] But what your
internal man is, of which you know nothing, because you have not
examined yourselves and afterwards repented, you will see after a while,
when you put off your external man and are let into the internal. When
this takes place you will no longer be recognized by your companions,
nor even by yourselves. Wicked men, who were moral, I have then seen to
be like wild beasts, looking at the neighbor with savage eyes, burning
with deadly hatred, and blaspheming God, whom they adored while in the
external man." Hearing this they withdrew; and the angels then said,
"You will see your life's lot after a little; for your external man will
soon be taken away from you, and you will enter into the internal, which
is now your spirit."

<span class="margnote"><span id="569.">569.</span></span>

Third Memorable Relation: Every love in man breathes forth a delight by
which it makes itself felt. It is breathed forth first into the spirit
and from that into the body; and the delight of one's love, together
with the pleasantness of thought, constitutes his life. This delight and
pleasantness are felt by man only obscurely while he lives in the
natural body, because that body absorbs and blunts them; but after
death, when the material body is laid aside, and the covering or
clothing of the spirit thus removed, man has a full sense and perception
of these delights of love and pleasantnesses of thought, and, what is
wonderful, sometimes even as odors. Because of this, all in the
spiritual world are affiliated according to their loves, those in heaven
according to theirs, and those in hell according to theirs. \[2\] The
odors into which, in heaven, the delights of loves are turned, are all
perceived like the fragrances, sweet smells, pleasant exhalations, and
delicious sensations that arise from gardens, flower-beds, fields and
forests in the mornings in spring. But the odors into which the delights
of the loves of those in hell are turned, are perceived like the
pungent, fetid and putrid smells that arise from cesspools, dead bodies,
and ponds full of rubbish and ordure; and, what is wonderful, the devils
and satans there perceive these smells as balsams, aromatics and
frankincense, refreshing their nostrils and hearts. In the natural world
it is also given to beasts, birds, and worms to be associated according
to odors, but not to men until they have laid aside their bodies as
exuviae. \[3\] On this account heaven is most distinctly arranged in
accordance with all the varieties of the love of good, and hell, on the
contrary, in accordance with all the varieties of the love of evil. It
is owing to this opposition that there is a gulf between heaven and hell
which cannot be passed; for those who are in heaven cannot endure any
odor from hell, because it excites nausea and vomiting, and threatens
them with swooning if they inhale it. The effect is similar upon those
who are in hell, if they pass the middle line of that gulf. \[4\] I once
saw a certain devil, who at a distance had the appearance of a leopard
(a few days before he had been seen among the angels of the lowest
heaven, having the art to make himself an angel of light), who had
passed beyond the middle line and was standing between two olive trees,
yet did not perceive any odor offensive to his life, for the reason that
there were no angels present. But the moment they approached he was
seized with convulsions and fell down rigid in all his limbs; and then
he appeared like a great serpent drawing himself up in folds, and at
length gliding down through the opening, from which he was taken by his
companions and carried into a cavern, and there by the rank odor of his
own delight he was revived. \[5\] Again, I once saw a satan punished by
his companions. I asked why, and was told that with his nostrils stopped
up he had gone near to those who were in the odor of heaven, and had
returned and brought that odor with him on his clothing. It has often
happened that a putrid odor, like that of corpses, from some open cavern
in hell, has painfully touched my nostrils and brought on vomiting. From
all this it can be seen why in the Word the sense of smell signifies
perception, for it is often said that Jehovah smelled a sweet savor from
the burnt-offerings; also that the anointing oil and the incense were
made of fragrant substances; and on the other hand the children of
Israel were commanded to carry out of their camps what was unclean in
them, and to dig down and bury their excrements (Deut. 23:12, 13). This
was because the camps of Israel represented heaven, and the desert
without the camps represented hell.

Fourth Memorable Relation: I once talked with a novitiate spirit who,
when in the world, had meditated much upon heaven and hell. By novitiate
spirits are meant men who have recently died, and who are called spirits
because they are then spiritual men. As soon as this spirit entered the
spiritual world, he began to meditate in the same manner on heaven and
hell, and when thinking about heaven seemed to himself to be glad, and
when thinking about hell to be sad. As soon as he recognized that he was
in the spiritual world he asked where heaven and hell were, what they
were, and what was the nature of each. They answered, "Heaven is over
your head, and hell beneath your feet; for you are now in the world of
spirits, which is intermediate between heaven and hell; but what they
are, and what the nature of each is, we cannot describe in few words."
Then, as he ardently wished to know, he threw himself upon his knees and
devoutly prayed to God that he might be instructed. And lo, an angel
appeared at his right hand and raised him up, and said, "You have prayed
to be instructed about heaven and hell; inquire and learn what delight
is, and you will know." As soon as the angel had said this, he was taken
up. \[2\] The novitiate spirit then said to himself, "What does this
mean? 'Inquire and learn what delight is, and you will know what heaven
and hell are, and their nature.'" Leaving that place immediately, he
wandered around, and asked those he met, "Pray, tell me, if you please,
what delight is." And some said, "What sort of a question is that? Who
does not know what delight is? Is it not joy and gladness? Delight is
delight. One is the same as the other. We know no difference." Others
said, "Delight is the mind's laughter; for when the mind laughs the
countenance is merry, the speech is jocular, the gestures are playful,
and the whole man is in delight." Others said, "Delight is nothing but
feasting and eating rich things, drinking generous wine and getting
drunk, and then chatting about various things, especially the sports of
Venus and Cupid." \[3\] Hearing these remarks, the novitiate spirit
being indignant, said to himself, "These answers are boorish, not those
of well-bred persons. Such delights are neither heaven nor hell. Would
that I could find some wise men." And he went away from these persons
and asked, "Where are the wise men?" He was then seen by an angelic
spirit, who said, "I perceive that you have an ardent desire to know
what the universal of heaven is, and what the universal of hell is; and
as this is delight, I will conduct you to a hill where there is a daily
meeting of those who inquire into effects, of those who investigate
causes, and of those who search out ends. Those who inquire into effects
are there called spirits of knowledge, abstractly, knowledges; those who
investigate causes, are called spirits of intelligence, abstractly,
intelligences, and those who search out ends, are called spirits of
wisdom, abstractly, wisdoms. Directly above these in heaven are angels
who from ends see causes, and from causes see effects; from these angels
those three companies have enlightenment." \[4\] Then taking the
novitiate spirit by the hand, he led him to the top of the hill, and to
the assembly that was composed of those who search out ends and are
called wisdoms. The novitiate spirit said to them, "Pardon my coming up
to you; I did so, because from my childhood I have meditated about
heaven and hell. I have lately come to this world; and some who were
then associated with me said that heaven is here above my head, and hell
beneath my feet; but they did not say what either one or the other is or
the nature of it; therefore, becoming anxious from constantly thinking
about them, I prayed to God; and then an angel came to me and said,
'Inquire and learn what delight is, and you will know.' I have inquired,
but thus far in vain. I therefore beg that you will teach me, if it
please you, what delight is." \[5\] To this the wisdoms replied,
"Delight is the all of life, to all in heaven, and to all in hell. To
those in heaven, it is the delight of good and truth, but to those in
hell, it is the delight of evil and falsity; for all delight belongs to
love, and love is the being \[esse\] of man's life. Therefore, as man is
man in accord with what his love is, so is he man in accord with what
his delight is. The activity of love is what gives the sense delight; in
heaven its activity is with wisdom, and in hell with insanity, but in
both cases the activity produces the delight in its subjects. But the
heavens and hells are opposite delights; the heavens are in love of
good, and the consequent delight of doing good; but the hells are in the
love of evil, and in the consequent delight of doing evil. If,
therefore, you know what delight is, you know what heaven and hell are,
and their nature. \[6\] "But inquire and learn still further what
delight is from those who investigate causes, and are called
intelligences. They are off toward the right." And he left them and drew
near to that assembly, and told them the reason of his coming, and
begged them to teach him what delight is. And pleased with the question,
they said, "It is true that he who knows what delight is knows what
heaven and hell are and their nature. The will, from which man is man,
is not moved in the slightest degree except by delight; for the will,
viewed in itself, is nothing but the affection of some love, thus some
delight; for it is some pleasure and consequent satisfaction that causes
volition. And since the will moves the understanding to think, not the
least thought is possible except from an influent delight of the will.
This is so for the reason that the Lord by influx from Himself actuates
all things of the soul, and all things of the mind, in angels, spirits,
and men, and in these He actuates by an influx of love and wisdom; and
this influx is the activity itself from which comes all delight. In its
origin this is called bliss, happiness, and felicity, and in its
derivation, delight, pleasantness, and pleasure, and in a universal
sense, Good. But infernal spirits invert everything in themselves, thus
turning good into evil, and truth into falsehood, the delight remaining
without interruption; for without permanence of delight they would have
no will, no sensation, and thus no life. This makes clear what the
delight of hell is, and its nature and source; also what the delight of
heaven is, and its nature and source." \[7\] Having heard this, he was
conducted to the third assembly, where those were who inquire into
effects and are called knowledges; and they said, "Descend to the lower
earth, and ascend to the higher; you will there perceive and feel the
delights of both heaven and hell." And lo, at that moment the earth
opened at a distance, and through the chasm three devils came up, who
seemed to be on fire with their love's delight; and as the angels
accompanying the novitiate spirit perceived that these three had come up
out of hell providentially, they called out to the devils, "Do not come
nearer, but from where you are tell us something about your delights. "
They replied, "Know this, that everyone, whether he is called good or
evil, is in his own delight, the so-called good man in his, and the
so-called evil man in his." The angels asked, "What is your delight?"
They said that it was delight in whoredom, revenge, fraud, and
blasphemy. Again the angels asked, "What is the nature of those delights
with you?" They said that they were felt by others like the fetid smells
from dung, the putrid smells from dead bodies, and the pungent smells
from stagnant urine. The angels then asked, "Are these things delightful
to you?" They answered, "Most delightful." "Then," said the angels, "you
are like the unclean beasts that live in such things." They replied, "If
we are, we are; but such things are grateful to our nostrils." The
angels then asked, "What more?" They answered, "Everyone is allowed to
be in his own delight, even the most unclean, as they call it, provided
he does not infest good spirits and angels; but as on account of our
delight, we cannot help infesting them, we are cast into work-houses
where we suffer terribly. The prohibition and withdrawal of our delights
there is what is called the torment of hell; it is also interior pain."
The angels asked, "Why did you infest the good?" They answered, "We
could not help it; it is as if a fury seized us whenever we see an
angel, and feel the Lord's Divine sphere about him." To this we said,
"Then you also are like wild beasts." Then, as soon as they saw the
novitiate spirit with the angels, fury came upon them, which appeared
like the fire of hatred; so to prevent their doing harm they were cast
back to hell. After this the angels appeared who from ends saw causes,
and through causes effects, and who were in a heaven above those three
assemblies; these angels appeared in a shining white light, which
rolling down in spiral curves brought with it a circular wreath of
flowers, and placed it upon the head of the novitiate spirit. And then a
voice issued therefrom, saying to him, "This laurel wreath is given you
because you have from childhood meditated upon heaven and hell."

CHAPTER 10 REFORMATION AND REGENERATION. After treating of Repentance,
Reformation and Regeneration come next in order, because they follow
repentance, and by means of it advance step by step. There are two
states that man must enter upon and pass through, when from being
natural he is becoming spiritual. The first state is called Reformation,
and the second Regeneration. In the first man looks from his natural to
his spiritual state and longs for that state; in the second state he
becomes spiritual-natural. The first state is formed by means of truths,
which must be truths of faith, and through these he looks to charity;
the second state is formed by means of the goods of charity, and by
these he enters into the truths of faith. Or what is the same, the first
is a state of thought from the understanding, and the second a state of
love from the will. When this latter state begins and is progressing, a
change takes place in the mind; the mind undergoes a reversal, the love
of the will then flowing into the understanding, acting upon it and
leading it to think in accord and agreement with its love; and in
consequence so far as the good of love comes to act the first part and
the truths of faith the second, man is spiritual and is a new creature;
and he then acts from charity and speaks from faith; he feels the good
of charity and perceives the truth of faith; and he is then in the Lord,
and in peace, and thus regenerate. The man who while in the world has
entered upon the first state, after death can be introduced into the
second; but he who has not entered into the first state while in the
world, cannot after death be introduced into the second, thus cannot be
regenerated. These two states may be compared to the progression of
light and heat during the days of spring; the first to the dawn or
cock-crowing, the second to the morning or sunrise; and the progress of
this second state may be compared to the advance of the day to noon, and
thus into light and heat. There may also be a comparison with a field of
grain, which is at first in the blade, then grows into the ear or head,
in which the grain is afterward formed; also with a tree, which first
grows out of the ground from a seed, then it becomes a stem from which
branches go out, and these are adorned with leaves; at length it
blossoms, and from the inmost of the blossoms the fruit begins to form,
and this, as it matures, produces new seeds, like a new generation. The
first state, which is that of reformation, may also be compared to the
state of a silk-worm, when it draws out and evolves from itself
filaments of silk, and after finishing its industrious labor, flies
forth into the air, nourishing itself, not by leaves as before, but by
the juices of flowers.

I. UNLESS A MAN IS BORN AGAIN, AND, AS IT WERE, CREATED ANEW, HE CANNOT
ENTER INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD. That unless a man is born again he cannot
enter into the kingdom of God, is the Lord's doctrine in the following
passages from John: Jesus said to Nicodemus, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God; and
again, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except a man be born of water
and of spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God; That which is
born of flesh is flesh, and that which is born of spirit is spirit (3:3,
5, 6). "The kingdom of God" means both heaven and the church, for the
church is the kingdom of God on earth. So in other places, where the
kingdom of God is mentioned (as in Matt. 11:11; 12:25; 21:43; Luke 4:43;
6:20; 8:1, 10; 9:11, 60, 62; 17:21; and elsewhere). "To be born of water
and the spirit" signifies to be born by means of truths of faith and a
life in accordance with them. That "water" signifies truths, may be seen
in the Apocalypse Revealed (n. 50, 614, 615, 685, 632); that "spirit"
signifies a life in accordance with Divine truths is clear from the
Lord's Words in John (6:63). "Verily, verily" \[or "Amen, amen"\],
signifies that this is the truth; and the Lord used that expression so
frequently because He was the truth itself. He Himself is also called
"the Amen" (Apoc. 3:14). In the Word the regenerate are called "Sons of
God" and "born of God," and regeneration is described by "a new heart
and a new spirit."

<span class="margnote"><span id="573.">573.</span></span>

The expression "born again," which means, as it were, created anew, is
here used because "to be created" signifies to be regenerated. That this
is the signification of "to be created" in the Word can be seen from the
following passages: Create for me a clean heart, O God; and renew a firm
spirit in the midst of me (Ps. 51:10). Thou openest Thy hand, they are
satisfied with good; Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created
(Ps. 104:28, 30). A people that shall be created shall praise Jah (Ps.
102:18). Behold I will create Jerusalem a rejoicing (Isa. 65:18). Thus
hath said Jehovah, Thy Creator, O Jacob, and thy Former, O Israel, I
have redeemed thee. Everyone that is called by My name, into My glory
have I created him (Isa. 43:1, 7). That they may see, know, consider and
understand, that the Holy One of Israel hath created it (Isa. 41:20).
(And elsewhere. ) Also where the Lord is called Creator, Former and
Maker. This makes clear what is meant by these words of the Lord to His
disciples: Going into all the world, preach ye the gospel to every
creature (Mark 16:15); "creatures" meaning all who are capable of
regeneration. (So also in Apoc. 3:14; 2 Cor. 5:16, 17. )

<span class="margnote"><span id="574.">574.</span></span>

All reason shows that man must be regenerated, for he is born into evils
of every kind derived from his parents; and these evils have their seat
in his natural man, which of itself is diametrically opposed to the
spiritual man. Nevertheless man is born for heaven; although he does not
enter heaven unless he becomes spiritual, and he can become spiritual
only by means of regeneration. From this it follows of necessity that
the natural man with its lusts must be subdued, subjugated, and
inverted, and that otherwise man cannot approach a single step toward
heaven, but sinks deeper and deeper into hell. Who cannot see this, if
he believes that he has been born into evils of every kind and
acknowledges the existence and contrariety of good and evil, and
believes in a life after death, a hell and a heaven, and that evil is
what constitutes hell and good is what constitutes heaven? Viewed in
himself the natural man in no way differs in his nature from the nature
of beasts. Like them he is wild; but it is as to his will that he is
such; in understanding he differs from beasts, in that the understanding
can be elevated above the lusts of the will, and not only see but also
moderate them; and for this reason man is able to think from
understanding, and speak from thought, which beasts cannot do. What man
is by birth, and what he would be if not regenerated, can be seen from
fierce animals of every kind; that be would be a tiger, a panther, a
leopard, a wild hog, a scorpion, a tarantula, a viper, a crocodile, and
so on; consequently if he were not transformed by regeneration into a
sheep, what would he be but a devil among devils in hell? And in that
state, if not restrained by civil laws, would not men from innate
ferocity, rush upon one another and slaughter each other, and plunder
each other even of the last scrap of clothing? How many are there of the
human race who are not born satyrs and priapi or four-footed lizards;
and who among these, if not regenerated, does not become an ape?
External morality is required, for the sake of covering up their
internals; and it does that.

<span class="margnote"><span id="575.">575.</span></span>

What man is when not regenerated can be still further made clear by the
following comparisons and similitudes from Isaiah: The pelican and the
porcupine shall possess it, and the owl and the raven shall dwell in it;
and he shall stretch out over it the line of emptiness, and the plummet
of devastation. And thorns shall come up upon her altars, the thistle
and bramble in her fortresses; and she shall become a habitation of
dragons, and a court for the daughters of the owl; the Tziim shall meet
with the Ijim, and the satyr shall meet his fellow; the night monster
shall rest there. There shall the merula make her nest, and gather and
hatch under her shadow; there shall the vultures also be gathered,
everyone with her mate (Isa. 34:11-15).

<span class="margnote"><span id="576.">576.</span></span>

II\. THE NEW BIRTH OR CREATION IS EFFECTED BY THE LORD ALONE THROUGH
CHARITY AND FAITH AS THE TWO MEANS, MAN CO-OPERATING. That regeneration
is effected by the Lord through charity and faith, follows from what was
set forth in the chapters on Charity and Faith, especially from this,
That the Lord, Charity and Faith make one, like Life, Will and
Understanding in man, and if they are divided, each of them perishes
like a pearl reduced to powder. These two, charity and faith, are called
the means, because they are what conjoin man with the Lord, causing
charity to be charity, and faith to be faith; and this conjunction
cannot be effected unless man has part in his regeneration; and this is
why it is said, man co-operating. In the preceding chapters man's
co-operation with the Lord has been several times treated of; but as the
human mind is such as to be incapable of perceiving otherwise than that
man effects this by his own power, the subject shall be illustrated
again. In all motion, and consequently in all action, there is an active
and a passive; that is to say, the active acts, and the passive acts
from the active, so that from both one action arises; comparatively as a
mill is moved by its wheel, a carriage by its horse, as motion is from
effect, an effect from its cause, a dead force from a living force, and
in general, as the instrument is moved by the principal. Everyone knows
that these two together produce one action. As to charity and faith, the
Lord acts and man acts from the Lord, for the Lord's active is in man's
passive; therefore the power to act aright is from the Lord, and the
will to act therefrom is as if it were man's, because he has the freedom
of choice, whereby he is able to act as one with the Lord and thus
conjoin himself with Him, or to act from the power of hell which is an
extraneous power, and thus to separate himself from the Lord. It is
man's action in harmony with the Lord's action that is here meant by
co-operation. To give a clearer perception of this, it shall be still
further illustrated by comparisons which follow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="577.">577.</span></span>

From the foregoing it also follows, that the Lord is unceasingly in the
act of regenerating man, because He is unceasingly in the act of saving
him, and no one can be saved unless he is regenerated, according to the
Lord's own words in John: Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the
kingdom of God (John 3:5-6). Regeneration, therefore, is the means of
salvation, while charity and faith are the means of regeneration. To say
that regeneration follows the faith of the present church, which leaves
out man's co-operation, is vanity of vanities. \[2\] The action and
cooperation here described may be seen in everything that is in any
state of activity and mobility. Such is the action and cooperation of
the heart and of every artery thereof; the heart acts, and the arteries
by their sheaths or coats cooperate; hence circulation. It is the same
with the lungs. The air acts by its incumbent weight according to the
height of the atmosphere, and at first the ribs cooperate with the
lungs, and immediately after the lungs with the ribs; from which there
is respiration in every membrane of the body. Thus the meninges of the
brain, the pleura, the peritoneum, the diaphragm and the other parts
which cover the viscera and enter into their composition, act and are
acted upon, and thus they cooperate; for they are elastic; and from this
is their existence and subsistence. It is the same in every fiber and
nerve, and in every muscle, and even in every cartilage; in everyone of
these, as is known, there is action and cooperation. \[3\] There is such
a cooperation also in every sense; for the sensories of the body, like
the motor organs, consist of fibers, membranes, and muscles; but to
describe the co-operative action of each, is needless; for it is known
that light acts upon the eye, sound upon the ear, odor upon the
nostrils, and taste upon the tongue, and that the organs adapt
themselves thereto; from which there is sensation. Who cannot see from
all this, that unless there were such action and cooperation with the
influent life in the spiritual organism of the brain, will and thought
could not exist? For life from the Lord flows into that organism, and
because of this cooperation, man has a perception of what he thinks, and
in like manner of what is there considered, concluded upon, and defined
into act. If life were to act merely, and man were not to co-operate as
if of himself, he could no more think than a stock, or than a temple
while the minister is preaching in it. The temple may indeed, owing to
the reverberation of the sound from its doors, have a sense, as it were,
of the echo, but not of the discourse. So would man be, did he not
co-operate with the Lord in respect to charity and faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="578.">578.</span></span>

What man would be if he did not cooperate with the Lord, may also be
illustrated by comparisons: When he had a perception and sense of
anything spiritual pertaining to heaven and the church, it would be as
if something distasteful or discordant flowed in, like an offensive
smell entering the nose, a discordant sound the ear, a monstrous sight
the eye, or a foul taste affecting the tongue. If a delight of charity
or a pleasure of belief were to flow into the spiritual organism of the
mind of those whose delight is in evil and falsity, if such delight and
pleasure were thrust upon them, they would be in anguish and torture,
and finally would fall into a swoon. Because that organism consists of
perpetual helices, in such a case it would coil itself up in spirals,
and writhe like a serpent on an ant-hill. The truth of this has been
proved to me by much experience in the spiritual world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="579.">579.</span></span>

III\. SINCE ALL HAVE BEEN REDEEMED, ALL MAY BE REGENERATED EACH
ACCORDING TO HIS STATE. That this may be understood, something must be
premised respecting redemption. The Lord came into the world chiefly for
these two purposes, to remove hell from angel and from man, and to
glorify His Human. For before the Lord's coming hell had grown up so far
as even to infest the angels of heaven, and also, by interposing itself
between heaven and the world, to intercept the Lord's communication with
men on earth, so that no Divine truth and good could pass from the Lord
to men. Consequently a total damnation threatened the whole human race,
and the angels of heaven could not have long continued to exist in their
integrity. \[2\] And thus, in order that hell might be cleared away, and
this impending damnation be thereby removed, the Lord came into the
world, and dislodged hell, subjugated it, and thus opened heaven; so
that He could henceforth be present with men on earth, and save those
who live according to His commandments, and consequently could
regenerate and save them, for those who are regenerated are saved. This
is how it is to be understood, that, since all have been redeemed they
may be regenerated, and because regeneration and salvation make one, all
may be saved. So the teaching of the church, that without the Lord's
coming no man could have been saved, is to be understood in this way,
that without the Lord's coming no one could have been regenerated. \[3\]
In respect to the other purpose for which the Lord came into the world,
namely, to glorify His Human, this was because He thereby became the
Redeemer, Regenerator and Savior forever. For it is not to be believed
that by redemption once wrought in the world, all men had been thereby
redeemed, but that the Lord is perpetually redeeming those who believe
in Him and who obey His words. But on these points more may be seen in
the chapter on Redemption.

<span class="margnote"><span id="580.">580.</span></span>

Every man may be regenerated, each according to his state; for the
simple and the learned are regenerated differently; as are those engaged
in different pursuits, and those who fill different offices; those who
search into the external things of the Word, and those who search into
its internals; those who are principled in natural good from their
parents, and those who are in evil; those who from their infancy have
entered into the vanities of the world, and those who sooner or later
have withdrawn from them; in a word, those who constitute the Lord's
external church are regenerated differently from those who constitute
His internal church, and this variety, like that of men's features and
dispositions, is infinite; and yet everyone, according to his state, may
be regenerated and saved. \[2\] The truth of this can be seen in the
heavens, to which all the regenerate go, in that there are three
heavens, a highest, a middle, and a lowest; and those who by
regeneration acquire love to the Lord enter the highest heaven, those
who acquire love to the neighbor, enter the middle heaven, and those who
merely practice external charity, but at the same time acknowledge the
Lord as God the Redeemer and Savior, enter the lowest heaven. All these
are saved but in different ways. \[3\] All may be regenerated and thus
saved, because the Lord with His Divine good and truth is present with
every man; this is the source of everyone's life and his ability to
understand and will, together with freedom of choice in spiritual
things; in no man are these lacking. And the means to these are also
given, for Christians in the Word, and for Gentiles in their religions,
which teach that there is a God, and which furnish precepts respecting
good and evil. From all this it follows that everyone may be saved;
consequently that it is not the Lord's fault if man is not saved, but
man's, because he does not co-operate.

<span class="margnote"><span id="581.">581.</span></span>

That redemption and the passion of the cross are two distinct things and
by no means to be confounded, and that by means of both the Lord took to
Himself the power to regenerate and save men, has been shown in the
chapter on Redemption. From the accepted faith of the church of today
respecting the passion of the cross, as being redemption itself, have
sprung throngs of horrible falsities respecting God, faith, charity and
other things that in a continuous chain depends on these three; as,
respecting God, that He had determined upon the damnation of the human
race, and that He was willing to be brought back to mercy by the
imposition of that damnation upon His Son, or by the Son's taking it
upon Himself, and that only those were saved who by foreknowledge or
predestination have Christ's merit bestowed upon them. From this fallacy
another belonging to that faith has been hatched, namely, that those
upon whom that faith has been bestowed, are at the same time regenerated
without any cooperation on their part; and even that they have thus been
absolved from the condemnation of the law, and are no longer under the
law, but under grace, and this although the Lord has said, That He did
not take away one tittle of the law (Matt. 5:18, 19; Luke 16:17), and
also commanded His disciples: To preach repentance for the remission of
sins (Luke 24:47; Mark 6:12). He also said: The kingdom of God is at
hand; repent ye, and believe in the gospel (Mark 1:15); "the gospel"
meaning that they can be regenerated and thus saved, which they could
not have been unless the Lord had wrought redemption, that is, had
deprived hell of its power by combats against it and victories over it,
and unless He had glorified His Human, that is, had made it Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="582.">582.</span></span>

Think rationally and say what the entire human race would be if the
faith of the present church were to continue; this faith being that men
are redeemed by the passion of the cross alone, and that those upon whom
that merit of the Lord has been bestowed are not under the condemnation
of the law; and again, that this faith (whether or not it is in him man
not knowing at all), remits sins and regenerates, and that man's
co-operation in the act thereof, that is, when it is being given and
entering, would defile it, and at the same time deprive him of
salvation, since he would thereby commingle his own merit with that of
Christ. Think rationally, I say, and tell me whether the whole Word
would not be thus rejected, where regeneration by means of the spiritual
washing away of evils, and by the exercise of charity is especially
taught. What would the Decalogue, the starting point of reformation,
then be, more than the paper that is sold in small shops and used to
wrap up spices? What would religion then be, but a kind of lamentation
that one is a sinner, and supplication to God the Father to be merciful
on account of the passion of His Son, thus a matter of the mouth and
lungs only, and not of anything done from the heart? What would
redemption then be but a papal indulgence; or what more than a monk's
flagellation of himself for the sake of the whole assembly, as is
sometimes done? If faith alone regenerated man, repentance and charity
doing nothing, what would the internal man (which is the man's spirit
that lives after death), be like, but a burnt city, the ruins of which
form the external man; or a field or plain laid waste by caterpillars
and locusts? Such a man appears to the angels altogether like one who
cherishes a serpent in his bosom, and tries to conceal it under his
garments; or like one sleeping like a lamb with a wolf; or like one
sleeping under beautiful bed-clothing in a night-gown made of spider's
webs. Or seeing that all are arranged in heaven according to the
different degrees of their regeneration, and all in hell according to
the different degrees in which they have rejected it, what would the
life after death be but a life of the flesh, and so like that of a fish
or a crab?

IV\. REGENERATION IS EFFECTED IN A MANNER ANALOGOUS TO THAT IN WHICH MAN
IS CONCEIVED, CARRIED IN THE WOMB, BORN AND EDUCATED. In man there is a
perpetual correspondence between what takes place naturally and what
takes place spiritually, or between what takes place in his body and
what takes place in his spirit. This is because man as to his soul is
born spiritual, and is clothed with what is natural, which forms his
material body. Therefore when this body is laid aside, his soul, clothed
with a spiritual body, enters a world where all things are spiritual,
and is there affiliated with its like. Since then, the spiritual body
must be formed in a material body, and is formed by means of truths and
goods which flow in from the Lord through the spiritual world, and are
inwardly received by man in such things in him as are from the natural
world, which are called civil and moral, the way in which its formation
is effected is evident; and since, as before said, there is in man a
constant correspondence between what takes place naturally and what
takes place spiritually, it follows that this formation is like
conception, gestation, birth, and education. It is for this reason that
natural births in the Word mean spiritual births, which are births of
good and truth; for whatever is mentioned in the sense of the letter of
the Word, which is natural, involves and signifies what is spiritual.
That in each and all things of the sense of the letter of the Word there
is a spiritual sense is fully shown in the chapter on the Sacred
Scripture. That the natural births mentioned in the Word involve
spiritual births is very obvious from the following passages: We have
conceived, we have travailed, we have as it were brought forth; we have
not wrought salvation (Isa. 26:18). At the presence of the Lord the
earth bringeth forth (Ps. 114:7). Hath the earth travailed for one day?
Shall I break forth and not bring forth? Shall I cause to bring forth,
and shut up? (Isa. 66:7-10). Sin shall travail, and No shall be rent
asunder (Ezek. 30:16). The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon
Ephraim; he is a son not wise, because he doth not stay his time in the
womb of sons (Hos. 13:12, 13). (So also in many other places. ) As
natural generations in the Word signify spiritual generations, and these
are from the Lord, He is called the Maker and the former from the womb,
as appears from the following: Jehovah thy Maker and thy Former from the
womb (Isa. 44:2). Thou art He that took me out of the womb (Ps. 22:9).
Upon Thee have I been laid from the womb; Thou art He that took me out
of my mother's bowels (Ps. 71:6). Attend unto me, carried from the womb,
borne from the matrix (Isa. 46:3). (Besides other passages.) For this
reason the Lord is called, Father (as in Isa. 9:6; 63:16; John 10:30;
14:8, 9). And those who are in goods and truths from Him are called,
Sons, and born of God, and brethren to each other (Matt. 23:8, 9). And
again the church is called, Mother (Hos. 2:2, 5; Ezek. 16:45).

<span class="margnote"><span id="584.">584.</span></span>

From all this it is now clear that there is a correspondence between
natural generations and spiritual generations; and because of this
correspondence it follows that conception, gestation, birth, and
education may not only be predicated of the new birth, but that they
actually exist. In this chapter on Regeneration the nature of these are
being presented to view in their proper order; here let it be said
merely that man's semen is conceived interiorly in the understanding,
and is given form in the will; is transferred therefrom to the testicle
where it clothes itself with a natural covering, and is thus conducted
into the womb and enters the world. Moreover, there is a correspondence
of man's regeneration with all things in the vegetable kingdom;
therefore in the Word man is also pictured by a tree, his truth by its
seed and his good by its fruit. That an evil tree may be born anew, as
it were, and afterward bear good fruit and good seed, is evident from
grafting and budding, for although the same sap ascends from the root
through the trunk to the graft or bud, it is then changed into good sap
and makes the tree good. It is the same in the church with those who are
engrafted into the Lord, as He teaches in these words: I am the Vine, ye
are the branches; he that abideth in Me and I in him, the same beareth
much fruit. If a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch and
is withered; and is cast into the fire (John 15:5-6).

<span class="margnote"><span id="585.">585.</span></span>

It has been taught by many of the learned that the processes of plant
growth, not only of trees but also of all shrubs, correspond to human
prolification. I will, therefore, add something on this subject by way
of appendix. In trees and in all other subjects of the vegetable kingdom
there are not two sexes, a masculine and a feminine, but everything
there is masculine; the earth alone or the soil is the common mother,
and is thus as it were feminine; for it receives the seeds of all
fruits, opens them, carries them as it were in a womb, and then
nourishes them and brings them forth, that is, ushers them into the
light of day, and afterward clothes and sustains them. \[2\] When a seed
is first opened by the earth it begins with the root, which is a kind of
heart; from this it emits and transmits sap like blood, and so forms as
it were a body provided with limbs; its body is the trunk itself, while
the branches and their branchlets are its limbs. The leaves which it
puts forth immediately after its birth serve as lungs; for as the heart
without the lungs produces no motion or sensation, and it is by means of
these that man is made alive, so the root without leaves does not cause
a tree or shrub to vegetate. The blossoms which precede the fruit are
means for purifying the sap, the tree's blood, for separating its
grosser from its purer elements, for forming a new little trunk for the
influx of these purer elements contained in the bosom of this sap,
through which trunk the purified sap may flow in and thus initiate and
gradually form the fruit (which may be compared to the testicles), in
which the seed is perfected. The vegetative soul which inmostly governs
in every particle of sap, or which is its prolific essence, is from no
other source than the heat of the spiritual world; and as this heat is
from the spiritual sun there, it aspires to nothing but generation, and
a continuance of creation thereby; and because it essentially aspires to
the generation of man, it induces upon whatever it generates a certain
resemblance to man. \[3\] That no one may be astonished at the
statement, that the subjects of the vegetable kingdom are masculine
only, and that the earth alone or the soil is like a common mother, or
is like the feminine, let it be illustrated by something similar among
bees. According to the observation of Swammerdam, reported in his Book
of Nature, bees have only one common mother, from which the offspring of
the entire hive is produced. As there is but one common mother for these
little insects, why not the same for all plants? \[4\] That the earth is
a common mother may also be illustrated spiritually; and is so
illustrated by the fact that in the Word "the earth" signifies the
church, and the church is a common mother, and is so called in the Word.
As to the earth's signifying the church, consult the Apocalypse Revealed
(n. 285, 902), where it is shown. But the earth or the soil can enter
into the inmost of a seed even to its prolific principle, calling this
forth and giving it circulation, because every least particle of dust or
powder exhales from its essence a kind of subtle penetrating effluvium,
which is an effect of the active force of the heat from the spiritual
world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="586.">586.</span></span>

That man can only be regenerated gradually, may be illustrated by each
and all things that come into existence in the natural world. A tree
cannot reach its full growth in a day, but there is first growth from
the seed, then from the root, and then from the shoot, which becomes the
trunk, and from this go forth branches and leaves, and finally blossoms
and fruit. Wheat or barley does not ripen for the harvest in a day; a
house is not built in a day, nor does a man acquire his full stature in
a day, still less wisdom; a church is not established and perfected in a
day, nor is there any progression to an end except from a beginning.
Those who have a different conception of regeneration know nothing of
charity and faith, nor of the growth of either according to man's
cooperation with the Lord. From all this it is clear that regeneration
is effected in a manner analogous to that in which man is conceived,
carried in the womb, born and educated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="587.">587.</span></span>

V. THE FIRST ACT IN THE NEW BIRTH IS CALLED REFORMATION, WHICH PERTAINS
TO THE UNDERSTANDING, AND THE SECOND IS CALLED REGENERATION, WHICH
PERTAINS TO THE WILL AND THEREFROM TO THE UNDERSTANDING. As reformation
and regeneration are treated of here and in what follows, and
reformation is ascribed to the understanding and regeneration to the
will, it is necessary that the distinctions between the understanding
and will should be known, which distinctions are described above (n.
397); therefore it is advisable to read first what is there said, and
afterwards this section. It has also been shown there that the evils
into which man is born are generated in the will of the natural man, and
that the will causes the understanding to favor it by thinking in
agreement with it. For this reason, that man may be regenerated, it is
necessary that his regeneration be effected by means of the
understanding as the mediate cause; and this is done by means of the
various kinds of instruction that the understanding receives, first from
parents and teachers, afterward by reading the Word, by preaching,
books, and conversation. The things which the understanding receives
from these sources are called truths; it is the same, therefore, whether
reformation is said to be effected by means of the understanding, or by
means of the truths which the understanding receives; for truths teach
man in whom he ought to believe, and what he ought to believe, also what
he ought to do, thus how he ought to will; for whatever one does he does
from the will in accordance with his understanding. Since then, man's
will itself is evil by birth and the understanding teaches what good and
evil are, and man can will either good or evil, it follows that he must
be reformed by means of the understanding; and so long as anyone sees
and mentally acknowledges that evil is evil, and good is good, and
thinks that the good ought to be chosen, he is in what is called the
state of reformation; but when his will leads him to shun evil and do
good, the state of regeneration begins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="588.">588.</span></span>

For the sake of this end there has been given to man the ability to
elevate his understanding almost into the light in which the angels of
heaven are, that he may see what he must will and must do therefrom,
that he may be prosperous in the world for a time and blessed after
death to eternity. He becomes prosperous and blessed if he acquires for
himself wisdom, and keeps his will in obedience thereto; but he becomes
unprosperous and unhappy if he makes his understanding subservient to
his will. This is because the will by birth inclines to evils, even to
enormities; therefore unless it is held in check by means of the
understanding, man left to the freedom of his will would rush into great
wickedness, and from the ferine nature inherent in him would plunder and
slaughter for his own sake all who did not favor him and indulge his
cupidities. Moreover, if man were not able to perfect his understanding
separately, and to perfect his will by means of it, he would not be a
man, but a beast; for without that separation, and without the ascent of
the understanding above the will, he would not be able to think, and
from thought to speak, but would be able to express his affections by
sounds only; nor would he be able to act from reason, but only from
instinct; still less could he recognize what relates to God, and thereby
God Himself, and thus be conjoined with Him and live for ever. For man
exercises thought and will as if of himself; and this as if of himself,
is the reciprocal element in conjunction, for conjunction without
reciprocation is impossible, as there can be no conjunction of an active
with a passive without adaptation or application. God alone acts; man
permits himself to be acted upon, and cooperates to all appearance as if
of himself, although interiorly from God. But from a right perception of
these things, it can be seen what the love of man's will is when it is
elevated by means of the understanding; also what it is when not
elevated; thus what man is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="589.">589.</span></span>

It must be known that the ability to elevate the understanding even to
the intelligence in which the angels of heaven are, is by creation
inherent in every man, the wicked as well as the good, and even in every
devil in hell, for all who are in hell have been men. This has been
frequently shown to me by living experience. But such are not
intelligent but insane in spiritual things, because they do not will
good but evil, consequently they are averse to knowing and understanding
truths, for truths favor good and oppose evil. From all this it is clear
that the first step in the new birth is a reception of truths by the
understanding, and the second is the will to act in accordance with
truths, and finally to practice them. No one, however, can be said to be
reformed by mere knowledges of truth; for man is able to acquire these
and to talk about, teach, and preach them through his ability to elevate
his understanding, above the love of his will. But he is a reformed man
who has an affection for truth for the sake of truth; for this affection
conjoins itself with the will, and if it goes on it conjoins the will to
the understanding, and then regeneration begins. But how regeneration
afterward advances and is perfected, will be told in what follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="590.">590.</span></span>

But the nature of the man whose understanding has been elevated, but not
the will's love by means of it, shall be illustrated by comparisons. He
is like an eagle flying on high, but as soon as he sees food below, as
hens, young swans, or even young lambs, he darts down in a moment and
devours them. He is also like an adulterer who hides a harlot in a room
below, and in turn ascends to the highest story of his house, and there
in the presence of his wife talks wisely with visitors about chastity,
and again steals away from the company and satiates his lust with the
harlot below. He is also like marsh flies that fly in a body over the
head of a running horse, but when the horse stops settle down and
immerse themselves in their marsh. Such is the man who is elevated as to
the understanding, while the will's love remains down at the foot,
immersed in the uncleannesses of nature and the libidinous propensities
of the senses. But because such men shine as if with wisdom in the
understanding, while the will is in opposition to wisdom, they may also
be likened to serpents with shining skins, and to the Spanish flies that
glisten as if made of gold, or to the ignis fatuus in marshes, or to
shining rotten wood and phosphorescent substances. There are among them
some who can counterfeit angels of light, both among men in the world
and after death among the angels of heaven; but these, after a brief
examination, are deprived of their clothing, and cast down naked. This
cannot be done in the world, because there the spirit of such is not
open, but is covered over by a mask like that used by actors in
theaters. In countenance and with the lips they are able to counterfeit
angels of light, which is both an effect and a proof of their ability to
elevate the understanding, as has been said, above the love of the will
almost to angelic wisdom. Since then, man's internal and external can
run thus counter to each other, and since the body is cast aside while
the spirit remains, a dark spirit may evidently dwell behind a bright
face, and a fiery one behind a bland mouth. Therefore, my friend, form
your opinion of a man not from his mouth but from his heart, that is,
not from his words but from his deeds; for the Lord says: Beware of
false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they
are ravening wolves. By their fruits ye shall know them (Matt. 7:15-16).

<span class="margnote"><span id="591.">591.</span></span>

THE INTERNAL MAN MUST FIRST BE REFORMED, AND BY MEANS OF IT THE
EXTERNAL; AND THUS IS MAN REGENERATED. That the internal man must first
be regenerated, and by means of it the external, is generally conceded
in the church at the present day; but "internal man" suggests nothing to
the thought but faith, which faith is that God the Father imputes to men
the merit and righteousness of His Son, and sends the Holy Spirit. It is
believed that this faith constitutes the internal man, and that from the
internal the external flows forth, which is the moral natural man, this
being an appendage to the former, comparatively like the tail of a horse
or cow, or like the tail of a peacock or bird of paradise which extends
to the feet without being connected with them; for it is said that while
charity follows that faith, the faith perishes if charity from man's
will comes in. But this being the only internal man recognized in the
church at the present day, there is no internal man, for no one knows
whether such a faith has been bestowed upon him or not; moreover, as has
been shown above, it is an impossible thing and therefore purely
imaginary. From this it follows, that at the present day, among those
who are confirmed in that faith there is no other internal man than that
natural man which from birth overflows in evils of every kind. To this
it may be added, that regeneration and sanctification are said to follow
that faith of themselves, and that man's co-operation, which is the only
means by which regeneration is effected, must be excluded. Therefore it
is that no knowledge of regeneration in the present church is possible,
when yet the Lord says that he who is not regenerated cannot see the
kingdom of God.

<span class="margnote"><span id="592.">592.</span></span>

But the internal and external man of the New Church are wholly
different. The internal man pertains to the will, from which man thinks
when left to himself, as when he is at home; but the external man is his
actions and words, such as come forth from the internal when man is with
others, thus when abroad. Consequently, the internal man is both
charity, because this pertains to the will, and faith, which pertains to
thought. Before regeneration these two constitute the natural man, which
is thus divided into an internal and an external. This is shown in the
fact that it is not permissible for man to act and speak in company or
abroad as when alone or at home. The cause of this division is, that
civil laws prescribe punishments for those who act wickedly, and rewards
for those who act rightly, consequently men compel themselves to
separate the external from the internal man; for no one wishes to be
punished, and everyone wishes to be rewarded, which is done by riches
and honors; and man attains to neither of these unless he lives
according to those laws. It results from this that morality and
benevolence exist in externals even with those who have none internally.
And from the same source is all hypocrisy, flattery, and simulation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="593.">593.</span></span>

As to the division of the natural man into two forms, it is an actual
division both of will and of thought therein; for every action of man
goes forth from his will, and every word from his thought; consequently
another will is formed by man beneath the first, and likewise another
thought; but the two still constitute the natural man. This will which
is being formed by the man, may be called a bodily will, because it
impels the body to make a show of moral activities, and that thought may
be called pulmonary thought, because it impels the tongue and lips to
utter such things as belong to the understanding. This outer thought and
will taken together may be likened to the inner bark that adheres to the
outer bark of a tree, or to the membrane that adheres to the shell of an
egg. Within these is the internal natural man, who, if evil, may be
likened to a tree the wood of which is rotten, but about which the
aforesaid outer and inner barks seem sound; as also to a rotten egg in a
white shell. But something shall also be said about what the internal
natural man is by birth. Its will inclines to evils of every kind and
the thought therefrom is inclined to falsities of every kind. This then
is the internal man that is to be regenerated, for unless it is
regenerated it is nothing but hatred against everything that belongs to
charity, and consequent rage against all things belonging to faith. From
this it follows that this natural internal man must first be
regenerated, and by means of it the external; for this is according to
order; while to regenerate the internal by means of the external would
be contrary to order; for the internal is like a soul in the external,
not only in general but also in every particular, consequently it is in
every least word one speaks; it is present in these beyond what man
knows. Because of this the angels, from a single action of a man, can
perceive what his will is, and from a single word what his thought is,
whether infernal or heavenly. Thus they know the entire man; from the
tone of his voice they have a perception of his thought's affection, and
from the gesture or the form of his action they have a perception of his
will's love. And this they have, however he may simulate a Christian or
a moral citizen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="594.">594.</span></span>

Man's regeneration is described in Ezekiel by the "dry bones" which were
clothed with sinews, then with flesh and skin, and at last had spirit
breathed into them, whereby they lived again (37:1-14). That
regeneration was represented by those things, is evident from what is
there said: These bones are the whole house of Israel (Ezek. 37:11). A
comparison is also there made with graves, for it is written, That
Jehovah would open their graves, and cause the bones to come up out of
their graves, and put spirit in them, and bring them together into the
land of Israel (Ezek. 37:12-14). "The land of Israel" there and
elsewhere means the church. Regeneration was here represented by bones
and graves, because the unregenerate man is called dead, and the
regenerate alive; for in the latter there is spiritual life, but in the
former spiritual death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="595.">595.</span></span>

In every created thing in the world, whether living or dead, there is an
internal and an external; one never exists without the other, as there
is no effect without a cause; and every created thing is esteemed
according to its internal goodness, or is deemed base if internally
malignant, as external goodness is when within it there is internal
malignity. Every wise man in the world and every angel in heaven so
judges. But the nature of the unregenerate man and of the regenerate,
may be illustrated by comparisons. The unregenerate man who simulates a
moral citizen or a Christian, may be likened to a corpse wrapped in
aromatics, which nevertheless exhales a putrid odor that infects the
aromatics, insinuates itself into the nostrils, and injures the brain.
He may also be likened to a mummy, gilded or placed in a silver coffin,
upon looking beneath the covering of which a hideously black body comes
to view. \[2\] Again, he may be likened to bones or skeletons in a
sepulchre that is adorned with lapis lazuli and other gems; also to the
rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, but whose internal
was nevertheless infernal (Luke 16:19). Still again he may be likened to
sweet-tasting poison, to a poison hemlock in flower, to fruit with a
bright skin, but inwardly worm-eaten, and also to an ulcer covered first
with a plaster and then with a thin skin, but with nothing within but
foul matter. In the world only those who have no internal goodness, and
who therefore judge by the appearance, can estimate the internal by the
external; but in heaven it is otherwise. For when the body which is
moveable about the spirit and easily directed from evil to good, is
separated by death, the internal remains, for this constitutes the man's
spirit; and then at a distance he looks like a serpent that has shed his
skin, or like rotten wood stripped of its bark or covering in which it
looked so well. \[3\] But with the regenerate man it is different. His
internal is good, and his external resembles the external of the other.
And yet his external differs from that of the unregenerate as heaven
differs from hell, since the soul of good is in it, and it matters not
to him whether he is a great man, who dwells in a palace, and goes
surrounded by attendants, or lives in a cottage and is waited upon by a
boy; or even whether he is a primate clad in a purple robe and wearing
the cap of his rank, or the shepherd of a few sheep in a wood, clothed
in a loose rustic frock and wearing a little cap on his head. \[4\] Gold
is still gold, whether it flashes before the fire or has its surface
blackened by the smoke; whether it is melted into a beautiful form like
that of an infant, or into an ugly one like that of a mouse. Mice made
of gold and placed beside the ark, were acceptable and pleasing (1 Sam.
6:3-5); for gold signifies internal good. Diamonds and rubies obtained
from whatever matrix, lime or clay, are in like manner esteemed
according to their internal goodness, the same as those in the necklace
of a queen; and so on. From all this it is clear that the external is
estimated from the internal, and not the reverse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="596.">596.</span></span>

VII\. WHEN THIS TAKES PLACE A CONFLICT ARISES BETWEEN THE INTERNAL AND
THE EXTERNAL MAN, AND THEN THE ONE THAT CONQUERS RULES OVER THE OTHER. A
conflict then arises because the internal man is reformed by means of
truths; and from truths he sees what is evil and false, which evil and
falsity are still in the external or natural man; consequently
disagreement first springs up between the new will, which is above, and
the old will, which is below; and as the disagreement is between the two
wills, it is also between their delights; for the flesh, it is well
known, is opposed to the spirit and the spirit to the flesh, and the
flesh with its lusts must be subdued before the spirit can act and man
become new. After this disagreement of the two wills a conflict arises;
and this is called spiritual temptation. This temptation or conflict
does not take place between goods and evils, but between the truths of
good and the falsities of evil. For good cannot fight from itself but
fights by means of truths; nor can evil fight from itself but by means
of its falsities; just as the will cannot fight from itself but by means
of the understanding where its truths reside. \[2\] Man is not sensible
of that conflict except as in himself, and as remorse of conscience; and
yet it is the Lord and the devil (that is, hell) that are fighting in
man, and they are fighting for dominion over him, or to determine who
shall possess him. The devil or hell attacks man and calls out his
evils, while the Lord protects him and calls out his goods. Although
that conflict takes place in the spiritual world, still it takes place
in man between the truths of good and the falsities of evil that are in
him; therefore man must fight wholly as if of himself, for he has the
freedom of choice to act for the Lord, and also to act for the devil; he
is for the Lord, if he abides in truths from good, and for the devil, if
he abides in falsities from evil. From this it follows that whichever
conquers, the internal man or the external, that one rules over the
other; precisely like two hostile powers contending as to which shall be
master of the other's kingdom-the conqueror takes possession of the
kingdom, and places all in it under obedience to himself. In this case,
therefore, if the internal man conquers, he obtains dominion and
subjugates all the evils of the external man, and regeneration then goes
on; but if the external man conquers, he obtains the dominion, and
dissipates all the goods of the internal man, and regeneration perishes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="597.">597.</span></span>

While it is known at the present day, that there are temptations, hardly
anyone knows whence and what they are and what good they effect. Whence
and what they are has just been explained, also the good they effect,
which is, that when the internal man conquers, the external is
subjugated, and as this is subjugated lusts are dispersed, and
affections for good and truth are implanted in their place, and are so
arranged that the goods and truths which a man wills and thinks he may
also do, and may speak them from the heart; and furthermore that by
victory over the external man man becomes spiritual, and is then
affiliated by the Lord with the angels of heaven, who are all spiritual.
Heretofore temptations have not been understood, and scarcely anyone has
known whence and what they are and the good they effect, because
heretofore the church has not been in truths. No man is in truths unless
he approaches the Lord directly, rejects the former faith and accepts
the new. And this is why no one has been admitted into any spiritual
temptation during the centuries that have passed since the Nicene
Council introduced a belief in three Gods; for if anyone had been, he
would have succumbed immediately, and thus would have precipitated
himself more deeply into hell. The contrition which is said to precede
the present faith is not temptation. I have questioned very many about
it, and they have declared that it is nothing but a word, except perhaps
with the simple there might be some timorous thoughts about hell-fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="598.">598.</span></span>

When man has passed through temptations he is as to his internal man in
heaven, while by means of the external man he is in the world; thus by
means of temptations there is a conjunction of heaven and the world
effected in man; and then the Lord in him rules his world from heaven
according to order. The contrary takes place if man remains natural; he
is then eager to rule heaven from the world. Such does everyone become
who is in the love of ruling from the love of self. If interiorly
examined, such a man believes in himself only and not in God; and after
death he believes him to be God who can exercise dominion over others.
Such madness prevails in hell, and it even proceeds to such a length
that some call themselves God the Father, some God the Son, some God the
Holy Spirit, and among the Jews some call themselves the Messiah. This
shows clearly what man becomes after death if the natural man is not
regenerated, and therefore to what length his fantasies would carry him
if a New Church, in which genuine truths are taught, had not been
established by the Lord. This is what is meant by these words of the
Lord: In the consummation of the age \[that is, at the end of the
present church\], there shall be such affliction as hath not been from
the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be; and except
those days be shortened, no flesh would be saved (Matt. 24:21, 22).

In the conflicts or temptations of men the Lord works a particular
redemption; as He wrought a total redemption when in the world. By
conflicts and temptations in the world the Lord glorified His Human,
that is, made it Divine; in like manner now with man individually, when
he is in temptations, the Lord fights for him, conquers the evil spirits
who are infesting him, and after temptation glorifies him, that is,
renders him spiritual. After His universal redemption the Lord reduced
to order all things in heaven and in hell; with man after temptation He
does in like manner, that is, He reduces to order all the things of
heaven and the world that are in him. After redemption the Lord
established a new church; in like manner He also establishes what
pertains to the church in man, and makes him to be a church in
particular. After redemption the Lord bestowed peace upon those who
believed on Him, for He said: Peace I leave with you, My peace I give
unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you (John 14:27).
Likewise He gives to man after temptation a sense of peace, that is,
gladness of mind and consolation. From all this it is clear that the
Lord is the Redeemer forever.

A regenerated internal man without a regenerated external also, may be
likened to a bird flying in the air with no resting place on dry land
except in a marsh, where it is attacked by serpents and frogs, so that
it flies away and dies. It may be likened also to a swan swimming in
mid-ocean, which cannot reach the shore and make her nest, so that the
eggs she lays sink in the water, where they are eaten by fishes. It may
be likened also to a soldier on a wall which is pulled down under him,
so that he falls headlong and dies amid the ruins. Again it may be
likened to a beautiful tree transplanted into filthy soil where troops
of worms eat up its roots, so that it withers and dies. It may also be
likened to a house without a foundation, or to a column without a
pedestal. Such is the internal man when it alone is reformed and not the
external also; for it then has no means of determining itself to doing
good.
