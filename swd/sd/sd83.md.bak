HOW THEY ARE ADMONISHED IN THE HEAVENS AS TO WHETHER THEIR INTERIORS ARE
IN A GOOD STATE. Those who are there do not attend closely to the state
of their interiors. When they think and do anything they are admonished,
through the external appearances, both without the house and within the
house, and also upon their clothes and in the face - if they have not
thought rightly. If, for example, anything of evil, lasciviousness, or
insincerity, has crept in and they have not rejected it, then, outside
the house, when they go out, the garden-products and the like, appear to
have either vanished, or changed as regards varieties and as regards
beauty, or as regards brightness. If they have vanished, or appear dim,
they instantly know that they have thought something of evil; and they
also reflect whence this is, and what of evil, or of falsity, it is; and
it is given them, from themselves as it were to know themselves, and
they recollect; and, then, they shun it, or it causes them to repent of
those things; which being done, the former loveliness returns. And if
spots appear upon their clothes, or if they become less bright, then, in
like manner, they thence recollect \[wherein they fell away\]: they are
lustrous, white and roseate when they have thought truths from good. The
like happens in the beds, and on their ceilings; in which sometimes
appear beautiful variegations of many adornments, when they lead the
life of truth and of good: in any other case, they are changed. Thus in
a thousand other instances, all of which are admonitions. Maidens are
also admonished, through changes of beauty in their face.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5602.">5602.</span></span>

ABOUT BOOKS AND THE WORD IN THE OTHER LIFE, IN HEAVEN. They have books
there, written as in the world, and similar writing in them as in the
world, in the Latin, Hebrew and Eastern languages. I have seen the books
frequently; and, also, papers have been sent to me out of heaven,
written from top to bottom. I read them as in the world. But whence the
writings \[come\] shall be told elsewhere. Each thing that a man writes,
remains in the interior Book of his memory, and is read before him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5603.">5603.</span></span>

But they have the entire Word, from beginning to end, so written that
everyone can read it. The preachers there preach on it, and the rest
read it, as in the world. They also have songs, and sing from them,
precisely as in the world. The spiritual angels are exceedingly fond of
songs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5604.">5604.</span></span>

But they have the Word written in the spiritual language of which we
have spoken previously. They have the Word in twofold wisdom: the
spiritual angels have the sense intermediate between the internal and
the external; the interior spiritual have it altogether according to the
internal sense, and the celestial angels according to the inmost sense.
In their Word, there are not names, nor numbers, but, in their stead,
things. They who wish to be intelligent and wise, can be instructed from
the Word about the minutest details. Instead of the history of the
creation, there is, there, something about the new creation of man.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5605.">5605.</span></span>

They have the Word of the Ancient Church, the title of which they call,
in part, ENUNCIATIONS, in part, THE WARS OF JEHOVAH, and
PROPHETICALS <span id="fr_242"></span>[5605-1](#fn_242.md) - concerning
which. . . The ancients have this; but they said that that Word is so
written that they can be instructed in minutest things. It is also
inspired; but, inasmuch as it was no longer of service for the men who
succeeded them, another Word was written. Of what kind this \[Ancient\]
Word is, is manifest from the first chapters of Genesis, which were
taken thence. <span id="fr_243"></span>[5605-2](#fn_243.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5606.">5606.</span></span>

((There are four classes of men there, just as in the world. The first
attend to the uses in the Word; they also see, indeed, the other things,
but do not pay attention to them. They serve as a plane. Thus it is read
by the celestials. The second, are those who take the doctrinals of the
Word therefrom: thus the spiritual understand it. The third, are those
who are delighted only with its holy external, without intelligence:
these are they who are in the ultimate heaven. And the fourth, are they
who attend only to the literal sense, and they who attend only to the
words; as, for example, the critics and those who write various things
about it: the former \[of these\] are in the threshold of heaven, and
the latter are in the very extremes.))

<span class="margnote"><span id="5607.">5607.</span></span>

HOW THE ANGELS HAVE THEIR WISDOM FROM THE WORD, AND ABOUT INFLUX AT THE
TIME. I have been instructed from heaven, that the angels are in wisdom
from the Word, but that they pay no attention whatever to those things
which are in the sense of the letter, nor to those things which are in
the thought of a man at the time when he reads it, but to the interiors
of the Word from the man. Wherefore, I was instructed how this matter is
circumstanced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5608.">5608.</span></span>

The natural thought of man is a plane in which all things of angelic
wisdom close: it is a foundation like that of a house. Into that plane
all things which the angels think fall. Thence, afterwards, is a plane
which is also of such a quality as their wisdom becomes; in other words,
as are the ultimates so are the primaries.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5609.">5609.</span></span>

If the men who are reading the Word, or thinking, or preaching, from the
Word, are wise, the angels are unaware of it at the time, but, still,
the wisdom of their thought falls into them as into its plane, as was
said; and they are entirely ignorant that it so happens.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5610.">5610.</span></span>

Angels have told me that they are sometimes in great wisdom, sometimes
in less, sometimes in clearness, sometimes in obscurity; and that their
thoughts are variously directed to the quarters, now this, now that, and
that they are in greater clearness, or obscurity, according to the
direction - but they are not turned to themselves but to men; also, that
they thence know that \[they are turned\] to the human race, where such
things are to which they are determined. They said that they have this
from much experience; and, when \[they are turned\] to those things
which are in my thought from the heavenly doctrine, then they are in
greater clearness than in any other case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5611.">5611.</span></span>

Those things are circumstanced like all things in nature. In nature
everything is fixed and ultimated. So with such things. Moreover, that
all internals close in externals, see externals degrees - and many
things besides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5612.">5612.</span></span>

How interiors subsist may be illustrated from various things. Angels
have their paths and methods, from interiors.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5613.">5613.</span></span>

I read something in the Word, and they who are in heaven perceived all
things clearly according to the internal sense, - see what has been
written about the correspondence of heaven with the Word. <span
id="fr_244"></span>[5613-1](#fn_244.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5614.">5614.</span></span>

Such correspondence occurs as with the man who feels from ends and
speaks thence; and as with the man who attends to the ends and uses of a
speaker; and with him who attends only to the sense; and with him who
attends only to the eloquence, thus to the affection of speech; and with
him who attends only to the words: these last are stupid.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5615.">5615.</span></span>

It was also observed, from experience, that, like as ultimates are
directed by the Lord from priors, so also, in turn, priors from
ultimates; and the Lord is the First and the Ultimate, or in the first
and in the ultimate, in order that, so, all things of heaven might be
directed; and, therefore, He became a man, so that He might also be in
ultimates of Himself, and not by others - they being men. Owing to that,
He Himself directs all things from the First and the Ultimate:
ultimates, through priors, in heaven; and priors, through heaven, from
ultimates: hence is the nexus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5616.">5616.</span></span>

Natural truths are in the place of a foundation, hence thought is filled
with such ideas; and, then, when a man is reading the Word, he is in
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5617.">5617.</span></span>

The plane and ultimate is with an intelligent man, whether he is
thinking about such things, or is thinking about other things, or is
asleep; for it is with him constantly. This also I know from much
experience and also because the whole man is of such quality as the
truth and good with him. Many men can at the same time serve as a plane
for one angel. The Lord so arranges that what is absent in one may be in
another; He, also, composes one thing from many, so that it may still
serve at the same time for one plane.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5618.">5618.</span></span>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE WORD. There were certain maidens who read the
Word daily. One of them was of the celestial genius: two others
intermediate between the celestials and the spirituals. These three had
the Word. When two of them did not read it for ten days, then their copy
of the Word did not appear. But they pondered whence this arose; and it
was perceived that it was because they did not read it. Then, they took
a copy of the Word out of a rock, and, when they read it, the characters
of the words were similar, but they did not understand. They were in the
celestial style. They afterwards received the Word and read it daily.
Their Word was according to the interior sense, which is midway between
the natural and the spiritual. It was historic and prophetic; but,
instead of the names of persons and places, and instead of numbers,
there were things. In place, there, of Moses, of Aaron, of David, there
was the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5619.">5619.</span></span>

ABOUT THE JEWS IN THE OTHER LIFE, AND ABOUT THE HEBREW TONGUE AND ITS
CORRESPONDENCE. The Jews dwelt within the Christian world, because they
had the Word and have known about the Messiah. They dwelt a little to
the left, in a parallel with the sole of the foot and below; and there
was a vast multitude there. Those there venerated Moses and Abraham, and
others in the Word. Moses appears to them when they do anything of evil,
with a staff in his hand, and terrifies them and admonishes them: a
certain angel in heaven appears in such a form, and they persuade
themselves that it is Moses. I know, too, many things about Abraham; but
it is not yet time to disclose them all. They read the Word in the
original tongue; and, from their ideas derived from that very tongue,
the celestial angels take up the celestial things which are in the Word;
for the correspondence of that tongue, as regards the very syllables
even, is with celestial forms - of which in another place. <span
id="fr_245"></span>[5619-1](#fn_245.md) But, a little while before Babylon
was destroyed, those \[Jews\] from the Christian world, were also cast
out there, and even to the northern quarter in the direction of the
length there, where they wander alone, and, there, are in a wretched
state. They are still withheld from their internals (which are vile),
and in the externals - in which closed-up internals they are able to be
more than any other nation. These things the Lord predicts in Matthew,
that, \[namely\], they were tolerated thus far for the sake of the Word,
through which there might be some communication with heaven. - The evil
of them are in a certain desert, which is called the desert of robbers,
which is also in the northern quarter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5620.">5620.</span></span>

Celestial angels said to me, about the Hebrew tongue, that all the
letters, or syllables, therein, have correspondence, and that, according
to the inflections and curvatures, they have a significance in agreement
with the heavenly form. It was permitted them to examine the letters
from beginning to end, also certain words; and they said that there is
correspondence, except in the case of certain rough letters, as
\[daleth, cof, ?\], and several which are pronounced roughly. But they
said that, so far as there is roughness in them, so far they do not
correspond. They also said that, for this reason, in the earliest times,
they were not rough but smooth, and that, therefore, in everyone of such
\[letters\] there is a point in the middle; and this point signifies
that it is pronounced roughly, but that, without the points in the
middle, not roughly. All rough \[sounds\] pertain to spiritual things,
and, therefore, the points in the middle of these. They further said -
as, also, I have frequently perceived - that they \[i.e. the celestial
angels\] have not the vowels i and e, but a, o and especially u; and
that y is an intermediate between the celestial and the spiritual; also,
that, because they are such, and only serve the purpose of sound, there
are, likewise, no vowels in the Hebrew tongue as in other tongues, but
they are annexed by means of marks placed above and beneath. ++ <span
id="fr_246"></span>[5620-1](#fn_246.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5621.">5621.</span></span>

It is hence evident, that the Word is Divine in all its details, not
only in the words, but also in the syllables and letters; and hence may
be known what that signifies, that not the least apex or the least
little horn <span id="fr_247"></span>[5621-1](#fn_247.md) should perish,
and why the Jews have been impelled to number the separate letters,
++ <span id="fr_248"></span>[5621-2](#fn_248.md) and that they have
believed mysteries to be in even every least constituent of a letter, ++
although they have not been aware in what way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5622.">5622.</span></span>

I read something in the Hebrew tongue, without the rough \[accent\], and
rapidly skimming the vowels as only sounds; and, from the syllables
alone, they formed the celestial sense in the inmost heaven, and
declared that there was correspondence. They who were of the most
ancient times speak almost so with each other, from correspondence; but
not so the celestials of modern times: still, however, these understand.
I read in the Hebrew tongue, Psalm 32, verse 2, <span
id="fr_249"></span>[5622-1](#fn_249.md) without the rough accent, and
almost without even the vowels; and they then declared that they
understood what it is from the sound,\# namely, this, that the Lord
pities those men mentioned because they do evil. \# It is said "from the
sound," and it is meant, from the natural <span
id="fr_250"></span>[5622-2](#fn_250.md) speech of those who are there.
Instead of a, there, they say ao, diphthong; instead of i there is
nearly y; and instead of ae there is eu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5623.">5623.</span></span>

THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT TIME AND SPACE ARE IN THE OTHER LIFE. Those
who die while infants, and who come into the interior heavens, do not
know what time and space are. As regards time, the reason is this:
because the sun, there, does not perform a revolution like the one in
the world, consequently, neither does it produce the years and days. The
sun, there, which is the Lord, is always in the east; therefore, no
other variations exist there than of the states of life as to good and
truth, which make their periods. And, since the sun is not of such a
nature as the one in the world, they are, therefore, unable to have any
notion of time, but only of state - albeit, relatively to the duration
of state there is time, just as much as in the world; but they cannot
thence have the notion of time, because the states do not recur in
regular alternations. In the interior heaven, even the idea of time
perishes; because, with those who come thither, the natural, which is in
the notion of time, is put to sleep.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5623a.">5623a.</span></span>

Nor are they acquainted with spaces, because these are variously changed
according to the states of their life: hence they are the appearances of
states; neither are these fixed as are those in the world. Those spaces,
also, are varied as regards distances and magnitudes, likewise according
to the states of life; and, because their spaces are of such a nature,
neither do they have the notion of them, although they still exist.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5624.">5624.</span></span>

I spoke with some such ones, and I asked what space is, and what time;
but they were entirely unaware. They called spaces, after the variation
of appearance, either beautiful or not beautiful; but times differently,
saying that they were qualities of life. It must be known, however, that
they are still spaces and times; but it is owing to the reasons here
assigned that the angels have not any notion of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5625.">5625.</span></span>

It may appear from these things, that all their natural ideas pass away,
for these are based upon spaces and times; and, consequently, that
material ideas perish, and those which are in their stead relate to the
changes and variations of there state. From very many ideas closely
observed, it may be evident how it is that natural thought, and
especially sensual thought, cannot withdraw from the notion of space and
time; and that, if it withdraws, it is scarcely able to think; for the
natural cannot think abstractedly from times and spaces.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5626.">5626.</span></span>

Hence also it is, that spiritual wisdom grows in the proportion in which
it is removed from the material notion; and it on this account is that
the ancients used to say that men come into the light as far as they are
withdrawn from the sensual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5627.">5627.</span></span>

Neither do they know what spring, summer, autumn and winter are; nor
what morning, noon, evening and night are; still, they have notion of
heat and cold, also of light and shade - not, however, from time, but
from the state of their life. Besides, they see all things there as in
the world: still, however, they do not perceive them according to space,
but according to the states of their life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5629.">5629.</span></span>

 <span id="fr_251"></span>[5629-1](#fn_251.md) ABOUT BABYLON AND THE
EXCEEDINGLY CRAFTY THERE: AND ABOUT THE SEVEN MOUNTAINS. I spoke with
Englishmen, and inquired whence it was that they were such, namely, that
when they hear truths, they see them and follow them, and that, then,
they are apt at conforming themselves; for, with them, in the other
life, there appears a whiteness which is above their natural and which
is of heavenly light: from this also it is that they are intelligent.
Likewise, the Dutch; but, with these, the whiteness does not appear, but
a certain solidity in their natural; wherefore, also, they are more
tenacious. I spoke with the English, asking whence they have such
whiteness - also, such a life; which differs, as they perceived, from
the life of all other nations. It was then permitted me to set up a
comparison between the government which was among them and among the
present-day Italians; which governments are perfect opposites: thence,
also, it is that their geniuses differ. In England, there is liberty of
speech and of writing about both civil and ecclesiastical questions; but
no liberty whatever of cheating others, of employing deceits and craft,
nor of assassinating, nor of robbery, nor of slaughter; and this
\[restraint\] and that \[liberty\] are there general. But it is the
opposite among the Italians; there, there is almost entire liberty of
cheating, by cunning and deceit, and also of killing, on account of
there being so many places of sanctuary, but none whatever of speaking
and writing about ecclesiastical questions per contra; neither about
civil \[abuses\]; for they have inquisitions there. Hence it is, that
the Italian race keeps all things within; and those of them who are
evil, retain a fire inwardly in themselves, which is hatred, revenge,
ferocity; which fire also is like that which lies concealed under the
ashes after a conflagration, and smoulders. But the English race
differently. With them, such fire is not concealed but instantly flares
up and burns out, because it is conceded to them to speak and write
freely, and, because they are kept in sincerity and justice, by means of
its not being permitted them to cheat, to rob and to slay; for in such
cases there is no pardon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5630.">5630.</span></span>

After these things were said, I was conducted, along with certain
Englishmen, to Italians who have been exceedingly crafty, and such
inwardly, and who have burned with such crimes in their life. When I
came to a distance \[from them\], I immediately perceived \[in them\]
contempt for us who were coming and a great notion of themselves, as if
they would possess heaven and earth. We approached nearer; and, then, I
spoke with them. I asked, at first, something about the Lord: they said
that they have all His power, inasmuch as it was given them through
Peter. But I asked what they thought about God the Father; whether they
have His power, also. They said that they have not, but only that of the
Lord as regards the Human. We asked, in reply, how they understand this,
that the Lord yet declares Himself to be one with the Father; that the
Father is in Him and He in the Father; and that His Divine and Human is
one like the soul and body, and, that because this is so, they cannot be
divided; and \[pointed out\] that they do not so perceive the matter
unless they say that they have Divine power, and also that of the Father
Himself. At this, they, at first, held their peace, and consulted
together: afterwards, they said that they have not heard such a thing
before, and that they cannot reply to it until after they have consulted
among themselves. They still wished to say something; but we answered
that the speaking native to man is through the speech of ideas such as
belongs to the wise in the other life, and not through a speech of
terms; but, that, if they want to hunt up terms from the school-men and
from Aristotle, this is ridiculous, and is never admitted by any
intelligent man, because, in this way, the greatest falses may be
confirmed. Then, after they consulted further, they sent to me a certain
one who had been an Inquisitor among them; but, when he approached, he
said that he is not of that religion but of another, and, moreover, that
he did not dare \[to say anything\] there. Wherefore, they wished to
resort to their arts and deceits, and said that they would reply in
another way. But I said that this avails nothing, because we speak from
Divine Truth; and that they know that he who attacks Divine Truth
assails the Divine itself: also, that nobody ventured anything against
Divine Truth in the other life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5631.">5631.</span></span>

These dwelt in a mountain in the west, afar off behind a wood, where
were the most wicked; and there they hid themselves. It was said, that,
around them, appears a fieriness as it were of burning, from the loves
of self and the world; inasmuch as such burning lies inwardly concealed
in them, by reason of the fact that they believe themselves to possess
heaven and men's souls, and, also, desire to possess the universal
earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5632.">5632.</span></span>

When they saw us, they said among themselves, They are paltry men and
not in any eminence; on hearing which, I asked how they understand the
Lord's words, that he who is least should in heaven be greatest, and the
greatest least. They wanted to say that they declare themselves least;
but I replied that this word does not mean to be least according to the
mouth, but least in heart; when, nevertheless, although they style
themselves least, they are yet thoroughly well-known as wishing to be
greatest. It was then inquired where such ones were.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5633.">5633.</span></span>

To this interrogatory, they said that they have an inquisition, and that
they send thither everyone who is not willing to receive their religious
decrees; but that, when they seek \[for them\], they find them released,
nor do they know how they get off; also, that the inquisitor says that
he wishes to resign that post because it avails nothing. It was shown,
moreover, how cruelly they treat those who are not willing to profess
their religious notions and acknowledge them as gods. Those enormities
with which they maltreat these latter, must be kept secret, because they
are horrible. (They hang them up by hooks fixed under the ribs.)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5634.">5634.</span></span>

Afterwards, was exhibited how such ones are dispatched to hell. At a
bridge behind that mountain, more to the western parts, is a desert into
which they who are such are cast which is done in succession; as, also,
themselves confessed. They said, that, when those who descend from the
mountain at this part, where there is a narrow swampy space, come above
that, they utterly lose everything of understanding and become most
stupid. They appear like corpses; nor do they know that they are men.
They wander there in great multitudes. There is also a long opening
there, which leads under the ground. They who are worst enter thither,
and the more deeply they enter the stupider they become. They lie like
corpses. Some were let in thither; and they said that it is so. That
wide passage leads, in a curve, to a second bridge, and the farther they
come along it, the stupider they grow and the more corpse-like. The
reason is, because the interiors of all who have been deceitful, and
burned with revenge, up to the end of life, and perceived their delight
therein, are closed in spiritual death: with these, at length, no
soundness remains. Some went out from that passage. They were like
corpses, and the love of self exhaled from them. It was said, that, as
long as they are such, they lie like corpses, almost dead; also that
those with whom that love is broken, have yet something of life
afterwards, but that, still, they dwell in that desert.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5635.">5635.</span></span>

Then, also, I saw many descending from that mountain into the desert.
These, at first, began to be as it were insane: thus they lost their
ingenuity of wickedness; and, afterwards, they were let down; and it was
said that they who go across that swampy space can never return, and
that, if they try to return, they fall into a swoon from the anguish
produced: wherefore, they turn back. They were asked what they felt
about those there in the desert whether, or not, they fear them. They
said that they do not fear them. They believe that they were themselves
still more crafty and skillful; therefore, they cover up their heart.
Those were let down over the swampy space who were obdurate in heart,
and would not desist from their heinous cruelty against everyone who
does not acknowledge that they have power over heaven and on earth. A
certain one of them wanted, through crafty magical devices, to go
backwards: he was thrown into a swoon near that swamp, and fell, on
account of magical thought from the Word about God the Father, and
rolled himself over the swamp; and then he said that he wanted to cease
from his former cruelty. He was among the governors there. But, as soon
as he came thither, he returned into similar, and into yet greater,
cruelty; to such a degree that he wanted to be in place of the
executioner. Wherefore, he was dispatched thence among the former ones,
and perished like the others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5636.">5636.</span></span>

At length, those who were in this mountain underwent visitation, and
perished in almost the same manner. The whole mountain sunk down in the
midst, and they were cast altogether into the depth; and waters were
drawn off from the western sea \[K. Fig. 5\], which overwhelmed
\[them\]; so that these were also immersed in the waters of the sea,
though not where the rest were, of whom \[I have spoken\] above \[no.
5300\]. They afterwards struggled to emerge, and so get out; but there
then appeared a sulfurous smoke of fire, from the love of self and of
ruling, which was seen on all sides. This was a sign that they have been
still more deeply immersed in the cupidities of that filthy love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5637.">5637.</span></span>

Those of the surrounding crew who were of the same genius, but did not
rule because they were meaner, were taken down behind the mountain at
the southern side, and cast into gulfs according to their evils.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5638.">5638.</span></span>

DEVILS WHO FEIGN THEMSELVES ANGELS OF LIGHT. From the assiduity and
deceitfulness of men in the world, it comes to pass, when such ones
enter the other life, they are able to present themselves as angels,
when, nevertheless, they are devils: and also to enter the heavens where
the angels are. They who are skilful in this, are able so to dispose
their interiors that nothing else is observed and perceived than what is
angelic; some by one art, some by another; \[and\], although the angels
have a tolerably good notion of observing and perceiving, still they are
deceived.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5639.">5639.</span></span>

This, those especially know how to accomplish who had been in a sacred
function, as many Jesuits and others; for the reason that they have so
disposed their countenances in the world, and, at the same moment, have
shut up, or separated, the interiors and their evil affections, from the
gaze of men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5640.">5640.</span></span>

This takes place, either by means of affections, which are of the will,
or, by means of those things which are of faith, which belong to the
understanding. Few can feign themselves angels of light in the heavens
by means of affections, because the perception of such things there is
exquisite; but, in a lower sphere, and with all the simple at the
threshold of heaven, they are able to counterfeit angels of light by
means of affections; for, those do not have interior perception, nor
penetration from knowledges; and because, also, in the world, they have
esteemed as neighbor whoever was wretched, poor and a beggar, if only he
displayed his misery. But they can by means of the truths of faith, and
so through intellectual things. They are able to speak more admirably
and in a more Christian manner than others, from the understanding, and
from the light of heaven; and, then, they hide their affections by art,
nor do they dare to imitate goods. They know, also, through
communication with the simple-good, how to bring it to pass that good
affections may inflow into their truths, and thus to present themselves
before the angels, as angels, too. They are also received, but are not
able to disguise themselves long. I saw such ones, and heard how they
worm themselves in, and how they behave; also that they are received.
There are still more arts; as, for instance, how some are able to bring
themselves even into the celestial heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5641.">5641.</span></span>

It should be known that the intellectual of man is preserved entire by
the Lord, whatever may be the state of his voluntary; to the end that
everyone may be able to be reformed which takes place by the means of
the intellectual; and I have heard infernals both well understand the
truths of faith, and enter into arcana as ably as the good; and they are
likewise able to speak intellectually, although the heart is far away.
When they are speaking, also, the voluntary is separated, and they
scarcely know otherwise than that they are such in heart and mind -
although they are not; like many preachers are wont to do, who, when
they are in the act of preaching, believe that the thing is as they say,
and speak as from faith and love; when, nevertheless, by themselves at
home, they are quite the reverse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5642.">5642.</span></span>

They who act in this way and are in this purpose of ruling, and of
subjecting all to themselves, and likewise of turning all there away
from the Lord to themselves, consequently of destroying heaven - these
are principally of the Catholic religion. Their arts in the other life
are exceedingly many. Such are they who are meant by him who came into
the marriage and was not dressed in a wedding garment: the wedding
garment is truth from good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5643.">5643.</span></span>

THE SPIRITUAL SPEECH. HOW REGENERATION TAKES PLACE. HEAVEN. ((That
regeneration takes place by means of the truths of faith, is shown in
many places in the Arcana Coelestia; but through the speech and the
thought of ideas, in the other life, how the case is in this matter, can
be seen. Let there be, for example, principles of truth; also marriage;
and the love of self. The truth of faith is received in a man's memory,
and the good of love in his will; the will through the intellect, or the
will in the intellect, sees, in the memory, that this truth is in
agreement with its own good, whatever that may be. Then, it contemplates
it, loves it, thinks it, and also, when opportunity offers, speaks and
does it. Thus is good conjoined with truth in the natural memory, and,
then, at the same time, in the spiritual memory; and they unite
themselves in a marriage. For example, \[again\], when any man, or
woman, wishes, from the good of his (or her) will, that the marriage
should be genuine; and, from the truths of faith which are in the
memory, knows that married partners ought to be as one man, and that the
marriage will endure to eternity if a true marriage; also, that that
love is the fundamental of all loves - then, he (or she) loves those
truths because they agree with his (or her) will, or good, or love, and
places them under his (or her) view; and, as often as he (or she) thinks
about marriage, the internal sight falls upon such things, until they
are conjoined in the exterior and interior memory. But those with whom
is no good of the will, reject such things, and procure falses in their
stead. In like manner, the love of self: if, from the truths of faith,
it is known that that love is infernal, consequently that it is hell,
then good, through the internal sight, makes for itself, about that
love, an idea of hell, at which it is horrified; wherefore, as soon as
such a thing as is of that love recurs, and it perceives that it is such
then the good of the will, through its sight, examines into the idea of
hell and is then withheld by the Lord from those things which are of the
love of self; and the more completely he is withheld and the better the
good is, the more things he begins to know; for the desire of knowing
grows according to the good of love, and, also, is increased through the
increases of good; so that he is at length sensible of the genera and
species of the love of self, and this in himself. Hence he becomes more
and more wise. The speech of ideas, when genuine, is of such an nature.
Wherefore, the evil cannot endure it; because they have a different and
contrary speech of ideas, which is from the falses of evil.))

 <span id="fr_252"></span>[5645-1](#fn_252.md) THAT A MAN'S SPIRIT APPEARS
IN THE OTHER LIFE. Sometimes man appears as to his spirit among others
there. They said that they sometimes see them, and nevertheless know
that it is not a spirit as yet after decease from the world, from
certain signs. But it happens only with those who think inwardly in
themselves more deeply than the rest. At the time, with him, his thought
is withdrawn from the sensuals of the body, and he appears thus. They,
however, who think only in their sensual, and do not raise their
thoughts above it, never appear. Nor do spirits know anything about man,
where he is; inasmuch as the corporeal does not appear before their
eyes, as spirits do not appear before men's eyes. Some have searched
into this matter, at great pains, but have not found out. The wicked did
this, but they were foiled; for, if evil spirits knew where man is, and
that they were with man, they would destroy him utterly, and thus the
whole human race; for such is their interior ferocity. They also hold
men as of no value, and altogether despise them. But the Lord loves men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5646.">5646.</span></span>

ABOUT WALKING: THAT THEY ARE CHANGES OF STATE ABOUT THE FORMS OF
SPIRITS, AND THAT SPIRITS ARE APPEARANCES. Walkings, goings, and
departures, are nothing else but changes of the state of the interiors;
but, still, before the eyes of the spirits and angels, they appear
exactly like walkings, goings and departures; which is like the case is
with man's life, that he believes he lives from himself; and, by reason
of his understanding of truth and will of good, that he believes he
understands truth and wills good from himself; because it entirely
appears so. Those appearances are so real, that the spirits are
altogether unaware that they are from that origin; nor are they willing
to know that they are thence; and the angels of heaven know, indeed, but
do not talk about it. This is of the Lord's Divine Providence, in order
that everyone may seem to himself to live and act from himself. This
derives its origin from man's walkings and goings in the world.
Naturally, men walk from place to place, because space is there and time
is there; but, in the other life, there are neither spaces nor times
other than appearances according to states. But, when men actually walk
about, then it is indeed the body that does it, but it is from the will
in the plane of action; and, so far as the will is present, in that
degree the man himself walks. Wherefore, when they are in the other
life, instead of spaces and times, there are states and those things
which are appearances of state; and a spirit, also, is an appearing
man. <span id="fr_253"></span>[5646-1](#fn_253.md) (For a spirit, there, is
an appearing man before the eyes of others, owing to the fact that the
Lord's Divine in heaven is a man. Hence are so many varieties, as
regards forms, in the countenances of spirits, according to the changes
of state, their presence and absence.) Spirits and angels are, indeed,
actual forms; but they have nothing of life from themselves. They are
led by the Lord according to \[their\] life; for in God we live, move,
and are. These forms are recipients of the Divine: and, in whatever
manner they receive, just such they are. Because those forms are the
forms of interior nature, or are in the spiritual world, they are
adapted to all the changes and variations of state, and this to an
immense and incredible extent, and in greater extent according as they
are in interiors to what extent and of what kind, there, is incredible.
Hence is manifest how much \[fuller\] recipients they in the heavens who
are in the inmost \[heavens\], are, than those in the lower \[heavens\]
and in the world of spirits; consequently, recipients of the wisdom and
the bliss which belong to life from the Divine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5647.">5647.</span></span>

Walkings there, are either total changes or only partial. They are total
when interiors and exteriors act together. At such times, when they
walk, they walk with the whole being, and where they then come there
they wholly are; appearing there as respects place, but actually there
as respects the state of their life, which is the state of the affection
which is of love, consequently of the will. Walkings are partial
changes, however, when the interiors are stationary and the exterior
states change. <span id="fr_254"></span>[5647-1](#fn_254.md) Then, also,
they appear to themselves in like manner to walk, nor do they know any
difference; but, still, it is not the whole spirit, but only his
intellectual: they themselves remaining in their own place, or state.
Nor do they then know otherwise than that they are walking; and the
majority do not distinguish \[the one kind from the other\]. But the
evil are then in their phantasy, because in their interiors and in evil,
therefore in insanity: the good, however, are then in their wisdom; but,
yet, all fall back, in will, to their own state and place. A certain
book was exhibited, and was instantly taken away by another \[spirit\]
upon a mountain which happened in a moment. I inquired the reason how
this is. They said that it is only by placing one's self in the state of
another; likewise, that presence with the book \[occurs\] instantly; and
that, when this happens, they simply stretch out the hand - which is a
sign.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5648.">5648.</span></span>

CONTINUATION ABOUT BABYLON AND THE SEVEN MOUNTAINS. There are many
mountains there, which are in that part and northwards from it, as many
as twenty; but they are all called in the Apocalypse \[17:9\], the seven
mountains upon which dwells the beast; <span
id="fr_255"></span>[5648-1](#fn_255.md) because seven, in the opposite
sense, signifies a profane \[state\]. And the majority who are there,
are of the Italian nation. On that, about which something has been
previously related, the Romans dwell, because they are in the love of
governing more than all the rest; neither do they care so much for
knowledges. Behind them dwell the rest of the Italians who are of such a
character: as those who are higher up than Rome, for instance, those who
belong to Tuscany, Genoa, Venice, Milan, and the Trans-alpine provinces.
These dwell upon the middle mountains there. In the farthest
\[mountain\] towards the north, are those who were from Naples, and
farther on, from Sicily; for the worst dwell towards the north there.
They who were from Sicily, are those who have been in the subtlety of
falsity, and in falses, more than the rest; and not so much in the love
of governing, like the Romans.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5649.">5649.</span></span>

It must be known, also, that many of the Reformed religion betook
themselves thither, and that they have professed the Catholic religion,
but only those who have been in the evil of life; who, since they betook
themselves in vain to piety and to prayers, had recourse to their faith
- which in the world they held interiorly in themselves - and embraced
all things of religion which the others wished, inasmuch as, in their
heart, they regard religion as nothing. Hence there is, there, a very
numerous crew from various nations, who are all their servants. That
external Catholic religion is also \[there\]; and is for such ones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5650.">5650.</span></span>

When visitation was accomplished among those who were on the three
mountains, it was next made upon the Romans; and it was found that all
things there were diabolical, and that, yet, they came to that insanity
that they not only rejected the Divine, but also wanted to be themselves
acknowledged as gods, which, also, was done. At first, they there adored
God the Father, and passed by the Lord altogether, because they said
that they have all His power themselves, so that there was no longer
anything of power \[belonging to Him\], and that the reason they
worshipped Him so holily in the world, as in the churches and in the
sacrament of the Supper, was in order that they might be adored, as
being in His stead on the earths. When they became such, and thus not
only took away all power from the Lord and arrogated it to themselves,
but proclaimed themselves as gods, and also established the worship of
themselves (for such insanity seizes them in the other life when
exterior bonds are taken away and they are left to their internals) -
then, the last Judgment came upon them; all were taken away from two
mountains there in a moment, thus were let into their interiors, and so
cast into the gulfs, in an instant; some into the higher western one;
some into the lower western; some - but few - into the sea there; some
into the higher southern gulf. But the mountain which was in the midst,
that sank down in the middle; and those there were cast down deeply into
hell, and a black smoke mounted up.
