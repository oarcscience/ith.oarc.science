### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="5651.">5651.</span></span>

After this, visitation was made upon those who were more towards the
north, where those were who are from lower Italy; and it was found,
that, when left to their interiors, they betook themselves wholly to
idolatrous worship, and made themselves idols of various kinds from such
things as are in the sea, on earth and in heaven, and began to worship
them, saying that the ancients on earth did so, and gentiles also with
whom it is well and proved, by various kinds of worships, the idol the
worship of which was the more successful, and that which was successful,
chose. Thus the mixed multitude worshipped idols of such kinds, and made
entirely after the pattern of all things which are in the sea, earth and
heaven; and animals of various kinds; birds, fishes, serpents;
representations of the moon and of the sun; and so forth. They also
passed by the saints, whom they worshipped in the world, having proved
that they are of no use. Such worship is ingrained in them, from the
worship of images on earth. When, therefore, it was found that they were
complete idolaters - worse than the idolaters on earth, in respect to
the fact that they have denied the Divine and believe that such things
avail, because through correspondences, - then, the Last Judgment came
upon those mountains. Some, an earthquake first fell upon, which
appeared like vast billows of the sea; and then, the towns there were
shattered, and the palaces there, and fell to the ground; which being
done, the mountainous \[surrounding\] was rolled back, thus moving to
and fro over them; and so they were altogether carried off from the face
of the earth. It is not granted to know whither they have been deeply
cast down. (\# About their inquisition see another page; \[no. 5656,
which we here immediately subjoin\].)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5652.">5652.</span></span>

The mountains which are nearer to the north, where the Neapolitans are,
and at length those from Sicily, which are the most remote, - these,
also, were subjected to visitation; and it was found that they have
wholly rejected their religion, and, from usage and purpose, have
adopted contraries, which they said were falses, and also were falses;
so that, whatever was false, and was against faith, the Word and the
Divine, this they have adopted and worshipped, or have established
worship thence. They divided their mountain-region into two parts, at
one part were the worshippers of falsity, and at the other those who
were in external holiness - saying, that it is of advantage to worship a
devil on the one side and the Divine on the other, in order that thus
they might be protected on both sides, and that thus, however they turn
themselves, they may be in security. Where their treasures were, there
they placed those who were in external holiness, and the altar, and
those who were in continuous employment; and thus they preserved their
treasures: for this takes place through such permanent faith: otherwise,
the treasures of silver and gold and precious stones, with the evil,
vanish of themselves, in the other life - about which elsewhere. I saw a
female saint of such a quality, who came to me, and who was clothed in
linen as if belonging to a monastery. She, because by means of holiness
she had communication with good spirits who were in the threshold of
heaven, was in such perception that she could see the secret thoughts
and affections of others. She said that she could come into heaven
whenever she liked; but it was replied,

<span class="margnote"><span id="5653.">5653.</span></span>

that there was, still, the intention of doing evil (for she wished to do
evil in every manner, according to all the pleasure of the rulers
there); and that, therefore, she could not be in heaven, for the
intentions are there perceived. She said that she could not in an
interior heaven; also, that she went inside and stayed there for some
time, but, yet, when it was exhibited that she was of such a character,
she removed herself away. But she drew out of a deep hell such things as
belonged to her intention which were diabolical. Hence, she was driven
into insanity, and rejected along with those who are utterly mad. Those,
also, who are on the other side - where are their saints, so called
because in holy external worship are such that they do all things
according to the pleasure of the rulers who are on the other side, and
who have the devil-worship. Thus, the one side favors the other, and
holy things, profane; and thus profanation there prevails. Moreover,
through the holy things of the one side, they have communication with
those who are in the first threshold of heaven, who dwell above them.
There is a mountainous region that rises up thence, towards the
middle-space: there dwell whosoever are simple-good or upright. With
these they procured to themselves a quite powerful communication; and,
so far as they have communication with them, so far have they power.
They speak with them, and they perform mutual kindnesses to one another,
and, sometimes, they associate; but those who have been unrighteous and
favored them in evil-doing, are cast down from that wide
mountain-region; and thus power is, in part, taken away from them. They
who are in those mountains surpass others in malignity; especially those
who are in the remotest mountains near the north. They are in such
sharp-sightedness and interior acuteness, that they were able to see
though the thoughts of others,

<span class="margnote"><span id="5653a.">5653a.</span></span>

and to read all things out. This occurs by virtue of the communication
with those who are in the first threshold of heaven. In a word, they are
most keen, especially those who are from Sicily. There hence appears at
the tip of their nose, a certain bright light; and, from their ears, as
it were a shrub, glittering with crystals and suspended; but the part
below the nostrils, or the region of the mouth, was completely black,
like hell; so that it could not appear. I told them that they place
wisdom in wickedness, when nevertheless wickedness is not wisdom;
because wickedness brings them to hell, or to eternal unhappiness, but
true wisdom which is without wickedness to heaven, consequently to
eternal happiness. At these things they became silent; and, at length,
they said that they do not know that any other wisdom exists than such
as they possess; and that the wisdom of others is only simplicity, in
which they by no means wish to be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5654.">5654.</span></span>

That the exceedingly wicked are near the northern quarter, and also
remotely there, is because those become the stupidest of all, when
vastated; because wickedness, with these, penetrates all and every
single one of their interiors. Hence they have afterwards so little
intellectual life, that they are as it were logs - as was said. It is
known \[to me\], that, in the confine between the northern and the
western tract under the mountainous region, are the stupid.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5655.">5655.</span></span>

 <span id="fr_256"></span>[5655-1](#fn_256.md) That they were worshippers
of a devil was also discovered. They had books in which the doctrine of
their worship was, and books in agreement therewith; and one book and
another was taken away from them, and read before others. In it, was a
doctrinal of this kind: that they should beseech God the Father that He
would excuse them for having recourse to a devil, because He is not
willing to assist them, and they know that they obtain aid from the
devil; wherefore, they have recourse to him, and set up his worship,
calling him their patron. And the other book was opened, which was
written in mere characters after the manner which prevails in the
celestial kingdom, and this by means of curves and simple inflections;
and it was deciphered. It was, that nothing was from the Divine, but
everything from the devil such, also, had been their interior religion
when they lived in the world, although the exterior appeared different.
They were asked why they so behave; since they have whatever is
necessary, as houses, food and clothing, and likewise were able to live
among each other as in the world what more they want, that they should
betake themselves to the worship of a devil. They answered that it is in
order that they may rule over all others round about and possess all \#

<span class="margnote"><span id="5656.">5656.</span></span>

They are accustomed to treat all whomsoever they come across, in the
following manner: they are able, by their art, to lead to themselves
anyone they see, and to cause his presence with themselves, howsoever he
may resist; and, then, they disclose his evils (for evil spirits,
especially sirens, are able to do this); and, thus, they accuse and
condemn him. If he is not then driven to accepting their worship -
either their devil-worship, or the hypocritical acting of holiness on
the other side <span id="fr_257"></span>[5656-1](#fn_257.md) - they cast
such ones into dusky caverns around their mountain: but, still, they are
taken out by the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5657.">5657.</span></span>

\#  <span id="fr_258"></span>[5657-1](#fn_258.md) those things \[which
belong to them\], as respects souls and bodies; and that they do not
obtain this from the Divine. Wherefore, it was said, that, therefore,
they will avail nothing, nor rule over a single one, but that they will
be the slaves of all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5658.">5658.</span></span>

Then, the upright spirits from whom they had their acuteness, having
been removed, they became insane, and rushed from the southern part of
the mountain, where the devil worshippers were, downwards, out of the
mountain into the hell which they adored. And so \[did\] they all \[to a
place\] where were black caverns, into which they entered. And so it
happened to them as was said. Their town, also, fell together in a heap.
Those who were at the other side, where were the external sanctities of
which above were also nearly all cast out thence into the northern gulf,
where the stupid are. One of the Sicilians came to me; and he was dusky
and black like a devil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5659.">5659.</span></span>

ABOUT NATURALISTIC PERSONS IN THE OTHER LIFE. The majority of these are
such as have thought in the world, when they heard from preaching, or
came into any thought from the speech of another, and seem to be
vanquished by some reason which they cannot gainsay that, whether it is
or is not, true, they do not know; whether there is a God, whether there
is a heaven, whether there is faith, whether such things as belong to
the Church; \[saying to themselves\] "I might easily believe them if I
were to see them in another life - if I come thither;" supposing that
they will believe if they see for certain, or hear for certain. But this
by no means happens. They who have not faith when in the world do not
have faith in the other life. I have spoken with such ones; and they
were convicted of being in error. They seized upon the truth. And, when
they turned the face to me, they believe. But, immediately they turn
themselves to their own loves, or turn themselves away from me and to
themselves, then they are instantly in the like faith to that in which
they were in the world, and altogether against those things which they
have heard. Nor are they any longer able to be led to the truths of
faith; for the whole interior intellectual life is from their
principles: wherefore, \[to be so led\] would be to destroy that life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5660.">5660.</span></span>

HOW MAIDENS ARE EDUCATED IN THE OTHER LIFE AND IN HEAVEN. THREE, four,
or five, are kept together; and each one has her own room, and in it her
bed; near that, is a tiny little chamber for their clothes and for
necessaries. There is also given them a cupboard \[skap\], with cases,
or drawers \[lader\]; so that they may put away in them things which
they value. In these they take much delight, and store such things up in
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5661.">5661.</span></span>

They are always kept at their work, which is embroidery worked upon
white linen. They embroider flowers and such things; and the things they
produce by their labor are either for their own use, or they give them
to others: they do not sell them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5662.">5662.</span></span>

These groups \[i.e. of 3, 4, or 5\], unawares to themselves, receive
garments with which they clothe themselves every day; a better garment
for feast days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5663.">5663.</span></span>

And they have a little garden, also; and, as long as they are maidens,
there are only flowers in them; but no fruits until they become wives.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5664.">5664.</span></span>

When they see spots on their clothes, it is a sign that they have been
thinking ill, and that they have done something which ought not to be
done. The spots cannot be washed out, as from clothes in the world. When
they find out what they have thought and done - for, at such a time,
they always think about that - they, then, see their blemishes and their
evils. If they then get the better of them again, the spots disappear
from the clothes of their own accord. In like manner, when they see in
their chamber that any one of their clothes is missing, they then
immediately know that they have done amiss. Hence is their
self-examination; and, if they do not themselves know \[what is wrong\],
a wife comes, who tells them. If they see that there is a new garment in
their chamber, they then inwardly rejoice, because they know that they
have done well.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5665.">5665.</span></span>

When, also, they see that the flowers in their little gardens become
dim, or change into worse ones, their attention is arrested; if into
better and more beautiful ones, they rejoice, because it is a token that
they have thought well.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5666.">5666.</span></span>

Also, there are given them coins of silver or of gold. These they
carefully treasure up, because they are tokens of industry or of virtue.
They have the written Word and Psalters, and they take them with them to
the preachings. They likewise read in them; and if they do not read,
either some garment is taken away, or the little garden disappears.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5667.">5667.</span></span>

The preachers sometimes visit and examine them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5668.">5668.</span></span>

THE EDUCATION OF INFANTS. (1) They are with nurses whom they call their
mothers. (2) They read the Lord's Prayer, and learn prayers from the
nurses, by means of influx out of heaven. (3) There are preachers for
them. (4) Intelligence, and wisdom too, inflows, which excels the
intelligence of the learned in the world, although they have only a
childish idea about those things. (5) There are with them
representatives out of heaven. (6) They are dressed according to their
industry, principally with flowers and garlands. (7) They are led into
paradises. (8) They are tempted. (9) They grow in accordance with the
state of reception. (10) They are of diverse dispositions. (11) Nurses
are appointed them who have loved infants in the world who, also, are
like mothers and there is granted them a perception as though they were
their own babies: but this is not granted to others than those who are
in good, and are able to receive influx out of heaven. (12) Those
infants who have been brought up there, do not know otherwise than that
they were born in the other life. (13) They do not know what time is,
what space is, and such terrestrial matters. (14) Within a month, they
speak the angelic tongue.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5669.">5669.</span></span>

THE SPHERE OF VIOLATION, AND HELL The sphere of violation appears
horrible, like sexual intercourse obtained by violence. Those from whom
that sphere exhales, are such as in their heart deny the Divine and
those things which belong to the Church, but outwardly appear courteous,
affable and moral. They enter the heavens everywhere, and remain there
for some time, for they know how to conceal their inmosts. These are
such as, when the injury of the worshippers of the Lord is being
advocated, are silent, and abstain from taking part until they see that
the matter begins to hasten to some catastrophe, where they are
instantly present, and assist with all their power, stopping at nothing.
Many such ones were borne down through a sphere of violation, and cast
down out of the heavens, as I saw. This is meant in the internal sense
by the violation of virgins, and by the violent, in the Word. Inasmuch
as they are outwardly affable and courteous, there appears, when they
walk in the streets, as it were a luminous brightness on both sides of
their face, which quivers in unison with their movement; and there also
sometimes appears a burning flame flickering around them in the streets
where they are walking; but it is a consuming fire, which is a sign that
it is a violent one. A fire, on the contrary, which is not a consuming
one, is angelic. Moreover, the part in their face which is beneath the
nose is hideous, dark-colored and corpse-like. Such ones, when cast down
out of heaven, appeared in face and body black and as it were bony,
because they are inmostly evil. When they are cast down out of heaven,
the interiors burst forth into the whole body; for then it is not
permitted them to dissemble any longer, since the communication with the
upright, from whom their courteous demeanor is supplied, is taken away.
Their hell is very deep down under the buttocks they sit there, like
charred Egyptian mummies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5662a.">5662a.</span></span>

SYNCRETISTS: THE LAST JUDGMENT. High above the head there, on the
mountain, at a considerable height, dwelt those who have deliberated
together about the union of religions, or syncretism and they decided
that they would make one Church from many, or all; - to such an extent
that they wished Mohammedans to be included as well, on the ground that
they acknowledge the Lord as the Grand Prophet, and as the Son of God,
who was sent to teach the human race wisdom. Thus they wanted to make
one Church out of many; but they thought \[to do this\] only through the
doctrinals which belong to faith, and the Intellectual, and not through
life, which is of love and charity, thus, the Voluntary of man. These at
last proceeded to such a length that they had almost profaned goods; and
they sought out from the Word such things as they might accommodate to
everyone. They inflowed with me, and this was experienced as a likeness
of profanation; but they were discovered, and it was granted me to speak
with them, and, then, to say that this is evil, inasmuch as they thus
wish to make one Church from mere idols and graven images; for when only
those things which belong to intelligence are taken into account, and
not those which are of the will, man appears like ebony, or like a stony
thing without any life, and if they want to make their one Church out of
such things they may. But if, on the contrary, they want life in them,
consequently, to have not images but men to constitute the Church,
regard must be had to the good of love and of charity, thus to the
reception of life from the Lord. When this is adopted as the foundation,
the Church becomes one; for the Lord then arranges all according to
heaven and its form, and presents all as one man. Such is the Lord's
Church in the entire circle of earths; from which those who are only
images are cast forth, and most of them are in hell, save those who have
to some small extent lived according to doctrinals, which the have thus
made of the life, or have thus made alive, in themselves. Since they
were on high, and consequently inflowed into the lower places, and were
only in doctrinals, therefore they were cast down thence, lest they
should profane good with others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5663a.">5663a.</span></span>

THE MOHAMMEDANS AND MOHAMMED: THE LAST JUDGMENT. Mohammedans dwell in
the western side, outside the Christian world, in many mountains there,
even to a great number. The better ones among them were transferred
thence to the eastern side, namely, those of them who in the world
acknowledged the Lord as the Grand Prophet, and called Him the Son of
God, and believed Him sent by the Father to instruct the human race,
consequently \[that He was\] wiser than others. Such ones, who had at
the same time lived well according to their religious belief, and
practiced justice and equity and sincerity from religion, and
acknowledged the God of the universe, although they also declared
Mohammed to be a great prophet, were transferred towards the east. This
transfer has been previously treated of; also, that then he who at that
time was Mohammed, was cast down into the lower regions, where he was in
chains lest he should get out. <span
id="fr_259"></span>[5663a-1](#fn_259.md) The reason he was cast down, he
himself afterwards disclosed, when it was made known of what character
he was, because, namely, he knew that all those who did not worship him
looked towards the east, and as soon as any did this he became aware
that they did not worship himself; for which reason, when he saw that
the whole multitude was transported thither \[i.e. towards the east\],
he realized that he was being altogether deserted; therefore he burned
with anger and wanted to hinder them. This was the reason.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5664a.">5664a.</span></span>

Many - amounting even to hundreds of thousands - remained at the other
side, in the boundary where Christendom ends. There they worshipped that
Mohammed as God; neither did they think about the Lord, and but little
about the God of the universe. They all labored assiduously to release
Mohammed from his fetters and restore him again to his original station;
and, after attempting this in vain, they appointed for themselves
another Mohammed, at first from their own number; but, since this did
not answer, they elected a certain one in a lofty mountain, above
Christendom, with whom they took counsel, and whom they obeyed as they
previously did Mohammed. But that crew, which was of such a character,
was not content with this, but even, by the advice of their new
Mohammed, began to betake themselves into the Christian world, and, in
various ways, and by various devices, began there to claim power to
themselves. They inflowed with some, and injured the Christians; and
also they dispatched their most skillful one to me, and he put himself
in possession of the province of my left ear, and hid himself for some
time, and thereby so strengthened them, that, at length, they could
scarcely be resisted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5665a.">5665a.</span></span>

But when this was discovered, an investigation was made, and it was
found that it was from those Mohammedans who were in the boundaries on
the western side; and it was inquired what kind they were, and why they
did such a thing, since they had not intruded themselves into
Christendom before. It was then found that that crew was of such a
character that they worshipped Mohammed as a sort of God, and that they
did not think anything of the Lord according to their religious belief.
It was also inquired what sort of idea they had about God the Father;
and it was found that they had no other idea than as of a created
universe, and that the idea was devoid of a human idea, as with all
others - consequently, that they had not any idea of God the Father.
They said, that they could have thought about the Lord from their
religious faith, if they would, and approach Him rather than Mohammed,
who to them, according to their religious belief, was a lesser prophet.
But they said that they cannot do this, because they had rejected that
thought in the world, on account of the Christians, who were their
enemies. It was ascertained, afterwards, what an inconstant race they
were; they are neither willing to do anything, nor to take up any sort
of work, - just like those who are on the mountains there, who have
governments and forms of governments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5666a.">5666a.</span></span>

Inasmuch as that crew was of such a character that they worshipped
Mohammed to so great an extent, it was therefore shown how things were
with Mohammed. The very Mohammed who wrote the Koran and was buried in
Mecca, was taken away from his own place where he was. He was deep down
in a place a little behind the right foot, and was raised up above to
the left of my head, and there appeared to them. He appeared gross and
swarthy. Such are corporeal men, and they have little of life. Those who
are in that place are almost idiotic. I spoke to those \[Mohammedans\],
and said that he is such, and that he is among the corporeal there.
Afterwards, also, he retired to his place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5667a.">5667a.</span></span>

After this, the second Mohammed, who was in chains, and for whom they
sought, was led forth; and it was discovered who he had been in the
world, that, namely, he was born in Saxony, and afterwards became a
ship's captain and was made captive by Algerians and set at liberty by
them; and as he there adopted the Mohammedan religion, he was trusted as
a ship's captain there. Then he was taken prisoner by Genoese, and set
at liberty by them also; and was thus imbued with both the Christian and
the Mohanimedan religion. He also took up a position in the Christian
world of which we have before spoken; and, since he persuaded those in
the boundaries that he was Mohammed, and was possessed by the lust of
governing, he governed them for quite a remarkable time, acknowledging
the Lord from the Christian religion and thence was able to be led by
the Lord; -Respecting him, see many things before related. There was
also another Mohanamed, who was a Christian from Greece, who had a place
behind that one and he, because he sometimes undertook his duties and
worked diligently, was proclaimed \[Mohammed\] by the former one, and
acknowledged by some among them who have thought of many Mohammeds. And
so as regards another also.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5668a.">5668a.</span></span>

Respecting those who are in the mountains there, they indeed think of
Mohammed when first they come into the other life; but, afterwards, they
abandon him and think of God the Father, the Creator of the universe,
and of the Lord as the Grand Prophet, wisest of men and Son of God. They
were examined as to what sort of idea they had of the one God, the
Creator of the universe; and it was ascertained that it was as it were
something human, and not as with the former ones, as of a universe.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5669a.">5669a.</span></span>

Some of the Mohammedans, when they heard many things about the Lord,
wanted to accede to that Church; but they were told that they may remain
in their own religion, if only they think respecting the Lord -
according to their doctrine out of the Koran - that He was the Grand
Prophet, the Son of God and the wisest of men. For they cannot
acknowledge His Divine in heart, only some with the mouth and from the
Intellectual, inasmuch as they have from infancy imbued themselves with
a belief in such tenets; and spiritual good is formed by such things as
have belonged to their faith in the world, which cannot be thus suddenly
extinguished by a new article of faith. It is sufficient that they live
in their good, observe sincerity and justice, and acknowledge that all
justice is Divine; also, they can thus still live happily in their own
way, and be gradually led to the Lord. It was added, that those who live
in justice and in their own good, are able to be better than Christians,
because these take away all Divinity from the Lord the majority of
Christians, who are called Papists, arrogating to themselves the whole
power of the Lord in heaven and on earth, and consequently taking from
Him all Divinity, which they no longer acknowledge in Him but in
themselves. And all the other Christians, who are called Reformed, know,
indeed, and from doctrine confess, that the Divine belongs to the Lord,
and He is one with the Father; but, still, when they think of the Lord,
they do not think otherwise than as of an ordinary man who is like
themselves; and at such times they do not think of His Divinity at all;
wherefore, also, they supplicate the Father that He may do what they ask
for the sake of the Son, and do not go to the Lord. Such, also, is the
idea of those Christians. Hence they saw that good Mohammedans think
better about the Lord, in their heart, than Christians do. They also
acknowledge Moses as a great prophet, but inferior to the Lord; but of
Moses they think no longer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5670.">5670.</span></span>

ILLUSTRATION BY MEANS OF THE WORD, AND MAN'S INTELLECTUAL IN RELATION TO
THE WORD. It is man's Intellectual that is illustrated when he reads the
Word; as is plain from the fact that one who has not the
Intellectual <span id="fr_260"></span>[5670-1](#fn_260.md) is aware of
nothing beyond the sense of the letter when he reads the Word; nor can
he be led to the truths themselves which are there. Hence it is that
boys cannot, that the wholly simple cannot, and that those who are in
obscurity about things cannot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5671.">5671.</span></span>

The Intellectual cannot be illustrated except from heaven; nor can
anyone be illustrated out of heaven save he who is in heavenly love,
consequently, who is in a life of good: communication with heaven thus
takes place. Then, he can be kept in the light of heaven: and, moreover,
it is the light of heaven which illustrates the whole, according to his
understanding. Those who are in worldly affairs cannot be illustrated,
because they are in the light of the world and not in that of heaven;
and that light induces darkness, - as, also, is plain. In a word, the
Intellectual is illustrated according to everyone's affection; for the
affection of love is the life of the Intellectual, and the affection of
love must he from heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5672.">5672.</span></span>

Nor can man be illustrated by a living voice out of heaven. In this way,
the thing does not enter into his rational, but only into his memory;
and there it is as it were a matter of the memory only. Hence it is that
immediate revelations are not granted. Neither can those be illustrated
who have confirmed themselves in falsities of doctrine; because their
Intellectual, as regards spiritual things, is then formed by those. In a
word, illustration takes place according to man's quality as to good and
as to understanding, also as to desire from love, and as to the quality
of the Intellectual; hence, according to the quality of reception.

THE QUARTERS IN THE OTHER LIFE. In the south are those who are in
external light, in worldly things, and who are in riches.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5674.">5674.</span></span>

In the north are those who are not in light, in worldly things
therefore, or in riches; thus, who are relatively in darkness and
poverty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5675.">5675.</span></span>

At the east are those who are in love Divine, consequently in internal
light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5676.">5676.</span></span>

In the west are those who are in the love of self and in interior
darkness.

 <span id="fr_261"></span>[5678-1](#fn_261.md) MAN AT THIS DAY DOES NOT
BELIEVE HEAVENLY THINGS, IF HE THINKS ABOUT THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE
THERE, OR WHEN THEY ARE DIRECTLY UNDER HIS OBSERVATION. Of what quality
the man of the Church is at this day, may be manifestly known from the
fact that all the things which are in the heavens can only be described
and related, and also believed, if they are not placed under his
thought, or his observation, in the midst. The reason is, because, then,
he reflects upon them, whether the thing is so; and, at this day, in the
world, especially in the learned world, the state of the human
understanding is such, that they only think whether a thing is so or
\[not\] so. At such time, also, they reflect from worldly and bodily
things, in which they place everything, and believe that what is beyond
them is nothing - consequently, those things in general which they do
not see and hear; thus, that those which are extant to the senses of the
body and are felt \[are everything\]. They know nothing about interior
things, nor will they receive if they know; wherefore, as soon as they
are not observing in themselves, they are drawn into bodily and worldly
things and reflect from them; for which reason they arrive at apparent
paradoxes, and, among the learned, who attribute all things to nature,
at nothing. This is, perhaps, the reason why those things which are said
about heaven, about the dwellings there, about their clothing and food,
and about their human form, when placed in the midst under their
observation, do not sink deeply into their faith, when, nevertheless,
they are the veriest truth. Examples can prove this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5679.">5679.</span></span>

As, for instance: if anyone describes the site of the dying, or dead,
then, if the state of the angels is ascribed to him, as, that he is
raised up among the angels and beholds magnificent things there, many of
them such as are in the world - then, if he have lived well, all things
fall without delay into the intelligence, and also into faith. Should it
be plainly said, however, that the thing is so, it is not believed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5680.">5680.</span></span>

The case is similar with man's life after death, if the resurrection and
Last Judgment are thought of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5681.">5681.</span></span>

Likewise, if the human form of man's spirit, and also of spirits and
angels in general, is thought of, as to whether there is such a thing;
and still more when the soul is thought of from adopted principles. In
like manner, as regards the dwellings of angels and spirits. Likewise
concerning their clothes. So in all things else: wherefore, I know that
this characteristic is possessed by some.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5682.">5682.</span></span>

They believe that such things appeared to the prophets as, for example,
angels in the human form, dwellings, temples and many other things; but,
if they are placed immediately under their observation, the thought
comes up that they are visions in which is no reality. But the simple do
not place a material thing under the midst in this way, and investigate
whether it is so. Wherefore, those of them who are not altogether
corporeal and worldly, believe: the learned to a less extent, and the
more learned they are, the less do they believe such things. But, still,
it has been granted me to know from the living interaction of many years
that those things are really so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5683.">5683.</span></span>

The reason why men at this day are of such a character, is because they
think in the bodily Sensual; nor can those matters be elevated by them
into the light of heaven; and, therefore, they are altogether in a
worldly and corporeal state. This is a proof that they are of such a
character.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5684.">5684.</span></span>

Let whoever chooses, think, if I tell him that angels are human forms,
that they are dressed in splendid garments, that they live in
magnificent dwellings; and let him at the same time think from the
sensual, or from the body, or its senses; let him also think from his
ideas about the soul: will he think anything else than whether it is so
or not? Will he think beyond this? Will he not then stop there, and at
length deny \[it all\]? But let him who can be withdrawn from sensuals
and bodily things, and raised above them, think at that time, and then
he will not think whether the thing is or is not, but that it is so and
then, for the first time, is man able to come into wisdom. Otherwise, he
will long stand outside the palace of wisdom, and not see the threshold.
If he will enter, he will see numberless and ineffable things. I have
spoken with angels about these matters, and it was shown that it is so.
The ancients were not so sensual. They were able to be raised above the
sensuals of the body. They, therefore, were able to be in interior
wisdom, and also to converse with angels, because they were in a like
light with them. This cannot happen at the present day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5685.">5685.</span></span>

This I am able to declare: that those things which are in heaven are
more real than those which are in the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5686.">5686.</span></span>

Hence, also, such thought is entertained in the world, because they do
not apprehend anything else but that man's interiors are nothing, just
as \[it is supposed\] that thought and will are only as it were
atmospheric things which pass away. For they cannot apprehend interior
things from bodily, consequently neither spiritual things, for there is
no physical influx; still less can they apprehend that these are more
real than bodily things, nor, consequently, that those realities are the
essentially human things, and bodily things relatively subservient,
formed to correspondence; which, since they are lower and subsequent,
are less real than the interior or higher things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5687.">5687.</span></span>

Those who call the soul breath, and thought wind, think differently from
this; those who acknowledge nature and deny God, differently still;
differently, also, those who make nothing of faith; and differently
again those who are more and more in the loves of self and of the world.
Those also think otherwise who have confirmed themselves in falsities by
reason of a lifer evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5688.">5688.</span></span>

RECENT ARRIVALS IN THE OTHER LIFE ARE KEPT AT FIRST IN EXTERNALS - WHY?
Those who first come into the other life are kept in externals, for a
time, to such a degree that their life there is almost of such a kind as
it was in the world. Some of them scarcely know that they have departed
from the world: it is, therefore, a continuation of life. But,
afterwards, externals are taken away; and then is made evident of what
quality the interiors are.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5689.">5689.</span></span>

The reason they are at first kept in externals, is because their
interiors are then to be conjoined with their externals or to be
separated from them and the spirits are to be thus prepared for interior
life, which is the life itself of man after death. Those who then have a
heavenly interior life, owing to their having done and thought the
things they did and thought for the sake of God and the neighbor, when
they come into their interior are wise; those who have not, who are
those who thought only about self and the world in all things, are
afterwards comparatively insane, and desire nothing else but evils, and
think falsities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5690.">5690.</span></span>

The first external life serves the purpose of harmonizing internals with
externals for, in the other life, they act in unison, nor is anyone
allowed to feign in appearance what he does not will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5691.">5691.</span></span>

The majority, also, are let into their interiors and into their
externals alternately; and by this means the conjunction and the
separation take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5692.">5692.</span></span>

THE CUNNING AND DECEITFUL IN THE OTHER LIFE. THEIR HELLS. The cunning
and deceitful dwell, for the most part, in the western quarter; and,
there, partly upon high mountains, and partly in the plain, according to
the phantasies arising from their self-love. Those who practiced cunning
and deceit in secret are invisible to others, because they think in
themselves, and so remove the interiors from the body, thus from the
observation of others. There were such, in great number, upon the
mountains in the western quarter, in various places; they were also
invisible to me, but still they were discovered. They are discovered,
when, as to their ideas, they are let into the body, or the external
sensual; and then they are able to speak courteously and do whatsoever
they wish: even if it be falsity and evil itself, to confirm it so that
it may appear like truth and good. Such are against the Divine, and make
nothing of those things which are of the Church. In themselves they are
sensual; they are also serpents, but more poisonous than others, and
vipers: such, too, in the light of heaven, they appear. All and every
single one of them are congregated in their places and in their heights
there, according to the nature of their deceit and cunning; but their
lot is, that they become more stupid than any others, because their
interiors are filled with hidden and thus profound cunnings and deceits:
wherefore, also, the most cunning and the most deceitful are near the
north in that quarter, where the most stupid are. Such are their hells.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5693.">5693.</span></span>

WHAT, AND OF WHAT SORT, VASTATIONS, THERE, ARE. All those who led an
evil life in the world, are vastated as to truths, and at length to such
a degree that nothing remains except evil and its falsity; and thus the
vastated one gravitates to hell. This continues, uninterruptedly, from
the first moment when such a one comes into the other life; and thus
variously, according to everyone's evil and the nature thence acquired.
It lasts sometimes for years, even as many as fifty, <span
id="fr_262"></span>[5693-1](#fn_262.md) some more quickly, some more
slowly; and, meanwhile, they perform a use by being the means of
temptations with the good, and by being with men. They have
communication with the hells, and influx takes place thence. Some,
indeed, are called forth from the hells. When they are called forth, it
happens by permission, and for various reasons: but, still, they fall
back of their own accord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5694.">5694.</span></span>

Those, however, who are to be raised up into heaven, are continuously
vastated as to evils and falsities, so that at length they are in their
own goods and the truths thereof. They cannot be raised up into heaven
before; for their evils and falsities weigh them down. And they are also
vastated as to the gross externals, which are corporeal, and the grosser
worldly things, which are merely bodily pleasures, and thus are
reformed. They then become as it were light, so that they can he
elevated into heaven: it cannot take place before. This, too, lasts for
one to fifty <span id="fr_263"></span>[5694-1](#fn_263.md) years.
Meanwhile, they also undergo various temptations, which promote the
separation of their external evils for, then, the will of resisting
evils is interiorly borne in; and, as far as this is received, so far
heaven is within, and this drives away hell, which dwells in the
externals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5695.">5695.</span></span>

All vastations take place through the separation of evils from the good,
and through the separation of goods from the evil; for every evil in man
has its communication. It takes place in very many ways I could recount
the ways, but it would be prolix beyond measure. Arranging in order
takes place by the gathering together of evil or good spirits, and their
separation and dispersion; and when these are being dispersed, or
separated, the spirit is of his own good or of his own evil, and has
communication with his like.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5696.">5696.</span></span>

THE LAST JUDGMENT. At length were exposed all those from the Christian
world who were, indeed, in light as regards spiritual things, but not in
any charity as regards voluntary; so that they have understanding but
not will. Such ones are accepted in the beginning, and are delighted
with knowledges; not for the sake of other uses, but only on account of
the delight. With these, too, in the other life, such delight is
increased, and also the understanding, which is kept in light, and thus
in a pleasant state; but the Voluntary is then rendered torpid, nor does
it appear. Such ones in the other life appear on mountains, here and
there; and some of them on the lofty mountains - partly within the
middle portion, and partly in the western side. There they conjoin and
consociate themselves together, and this widely by means of thoughts, by
which, there, presence takes place; and they believe that, so
circumstanced, they can never be disturbed. They have no faith in the
Divine, save intellectually when things go smoothly with them and they
have happiness; afterwards, when these pass away, they recede. Such
ones, also, do not care how things are with a neighbor: they see him,
but render him no assistance. They cause themselves to appear as
innocences, or angels. They take up various principles from the
Intellectual, as to why they do not do it \[i.e. the truth\]; as, for
example: that they do not wish to reject evil from themselves and so to
infest others, - just as the Divine does; besides other reasonings by
which they excuse their disinclination. They likewise league themselves
with the evil everywhere, and defend them, believing that they
themselves are the stronger. In a word, because their Voluntary is of
such a kind, they tolerate and countenance evils anywhere and
everywhere, although they see \[that they are evils\]. Such are they who
interpose themselves between the Lord and the evil in the other life,
yea, between the Lord and man, and entirely deaden all effect. They as
it were block up the way, so that the Divine operation is not able to
make its way into the lower places. They desire to have rule over such
ones \[viz., the evil\]; when, nevertheless, they themselves are
inwardly evil, and in self-love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5697.">5697.</span></span>

There were such ones on a mountain in the middle region; such ones,
also, were on a somewhat high mountain in the western quarter towards
the north, and everywhere round about, on the slopes of the mountains
all round. Those on the high mountain did not appear. They were able to
make themselves invisible. They also conjoined themselves with all the
others round about; and they all believed that they were in heaven,
because, as has been said, they were in intellectual light without
heavenly heat. Hence, they are the most dangerous of all, because they
keep themselves out of sight and act with the evil. Against the good
they venture nothing, until they see that they are beginning to fall
away. Then they approach them; and these possess more power and render
more aid than the evil, because they are also allied with the
simple-good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5698.">5698.</span></span>

When it was ascertained that these were of such a character, they were
cast down from the mountains, also from the mountain that was in the
midst, and from the high mountain that was in the western quarter
towards the north, and afterwards all who were on the slopes of the
mountains round about, with whom they were leagued; and this until the
myriads who were on the high mountain were hurled down beneath their
mountain. The mountain opened itself and swallowed them up; and they
fell down, or were thrust down, deeply, and were let into great
darknesses. There inflowed darknesses which laid hold of them. The
darknesses are falsities, which to them are in place of light. The rest,
also, were cast down into the hells, according to the quality of their
will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5699.">5699.</span></span>

After those evil ones were cast down round about, those who openly
endeavoured to perpetrate evils under their auspices, or through
conjunction with them, had no more power of resisting: these were then,
consequently, cast down into various hells. Some were in plains; some in
mountains. This happened 30th March, 1757.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5700.">5700.</span></span>

THOSE WHO WERE CALLED LEARNED AND WERE BELIEVED BECAUSE THEY COULD
CONFIRM THEIR OWN DOGMA WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, IN THE OTHER LIFE. There
are many who can confirm anything whatever, and so dexterously that it
appears, at the time, entirely as if they were true, and by this means
also pass in the world as learned, and as more rational than others;
when, nevertheless, they have almost nothing of the understanding of
truth, but this is dark and closed with them. This was proved by many.
One was Rosenadler, who was able to confirm anything whatever so
skillfully that scarcely any could surpass it; and, when he had
confirmed it, he himself believed it to be true. He was believed by
others to be possessed of an interior understanding beyond other men;
and that his great faculty of confirmation was from that source. He was
sent to a place where there was interior thought; and then he became
blind, so as to be able to see nothing; and it happened so, as often as
he was let into thinking interiorly. He said, therefore, as he believed
in the world, that he could make out whatever he chose, to be true; but
it was shown him that this was a fallacy, and that he was not even able
to see that which is true in itself. One of the Siren kind was
exhibited, who was able to make herself more beautiful than others. She
appeared so beautiful that all who looked upon her from the Natural,
declared that she was the most beautiful of women: she was likewise able
to adorn herself with becoming and magnificent clothes. But when this
deceptive external was taken away, she appeared in a diabolical form.
