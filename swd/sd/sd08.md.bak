### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="1851.">1851.</span></span>

Another \[a male\] was represented lying in a bed, and deeming himself
innocent; wherefore he was supplicating with his body naked. - 1748,
April 8.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1852.">1852.</span></span>

THAT SPIRITS KNOW NO OTHERWISE THAN THAT THEY ARE MAN. Apart from
numerous other proofs, the truth of the above proposition may be evinced
beyond doubt from the fact that a spirit who spoke with me positively
affirmed that he did not know otherwise than that he was I myself,
especially when he did not reflect upon the subject; but my own
reflections were that spirits did know themselves to be spirits separate
from men. In a word, without reflection they know nothing else, nor is
reflection given except with those who converse with them and give
responses, and then converse with others also. Reflection is indeed
given without the speech of man with spirits, but this is effected by
the Lord. - 1748, April 6.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1853.">1853.</span></span>

THAT SPIRITS FROM EXTERNALS ARE PERSUADED CONCERNING INTERNALS. Whatever
there is in the phantasy of man comes also into the phantasy of spirits,
and, they are persuaded that the fact is so and so; as now I have
learned by experience, namely, when I only supposed that I had a fur cap
upon my head (:en luden mossa pa hufwudet:) <span
id="fr_10"></span>[1853-1](#fn_10.md) by which they were prevented from
seeing the interiors of the brain, or its thoughts. They immediately
said that there was nothing apparent, thus that their vision was
impeded. Presently after, however, good spirits, from thinking that they
were shut in between the fur hat and the head, and that they then grew
warm, said that they did, as it were, perceive \[what was within\], but
still saying that phantasy thus bore sway; so also in very many other
things; whence they were persuaded from external concerning internal
things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1854.">1854.</span></span>

(((((Similar is the case of certain spirits who were induced to believe
that Aaron and his sons, however really defiled, were holy when they
washed their feet and hands, and were clothed with the priestly robes.
The idea of sanctity in this case was a mere persuasion concerning
internals drawn from externals. Indeed, everything \[in that
dispensation\] was thus externally instituted that spirits might \[if
they would\] be persuaded by them. - 1748, April 6. There was in
everything which was done, whether in respect to the garments or other
things, a representation of the Lord.)))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1855.">1855.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE HEAT OF SPIRITS AND ANGELS. I have before spoken of the
chills of evil spirits, which I have often experienced to the life. It
was also given me, by a living sense, to experience the heat of good
spirits and angels.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1856.">1856.</span></span>

((((Spirits who in their lifetime took delight in the Word of the Lord,
and who had a somewhat vivid perception of that delight, enjoy in the
other life a certain celestial and pleasant heat, which it was given me
to perceive by the essential approximation of kindred spirits. The heat
of spirits is indeed external, but still radiating from internals not
very clearly perceived. It warmed me very much, after the manner of
summer heat, beginning from the region of the lips, and diffusing itself
round to the cheeks, even to the ears, and ascending thence to the eyes.
Below it spread itself downward over the breast, to the mid-region of
the body. The higher parts of the head, and the lower parts of the body,
had thence some degree of heat, but not so sensible; wherefore the true
province of the heat is from the mouth upwards to just below the eyes,
and downwards to the middle of the body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1857.">1857.</span></span>

As to those who are delighted with the interior things of the Word, it
was given to perceive their heat also, and it was interior, beginning
from the breast, and proceeding upwards towards the chin, and downwards
toward the loins; but it was still interior, and perceived as such.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1858.">1858.</span></span>

Those, again, who are delighted with the inmost things of the Word,
their heat is yet more interior, or inmost, which it was given me indeed
to perceive, but very slightly, inasmuch as my sense, in relation to
these things, is too obtuse to allow of their being perceived as they
are; for it was said that if I should perceive that heat, I could not
subsist in the body, as it takes possession of the inmosts of the
marrow, and because such is its quality I perceived rather a slight
degree of cold externally, but within I had at the same time some kind
of idea of heat. Its region is from the loins, or from the middle of the
body between the loins, and thence extending upwards towards the breast
and the left arm to the hand, and downwards into the left foot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1859.">1859.</span></span>

When it was given me to perceive these heats, which I did to the life,
angels meanwhile spoke with me through spirits, and they instructed me
as to the true state of the case, saying that it was their approach
which insinuated these heats, because they had it in them, though they
were no more conscious of it than is one who does not possess it.))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1860.">1860.</span></span>

Hence it may appear that man is an organ, for he is affected by heat as
to his interiors and inmosts while yet it flows from love, as here from
the love of the Divine Word, and this love which produces such heats in
organic substances is virtually a principle of life, and thus from the
Lord alone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1861.">1861.</span></span>

((((It was moreover given me to perceive also the heat of those who are
delighted in the Word of the Lord, but care little about understanding
it; it was perceived only in the left arm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1862.">1862.</span></span>

There were spirits also who would fain counterfeit such a heat, and
there was a certain degree of it above the eyes, but I could not
perceive it, for it was given me to know that they were able by their
art to feign or pretend something of the kind, as they had done in
former instances in regard to delights, but it was merely an external
sensation, having no origin in internals; and such a heat, because
simulated, is noxious, and is a mere tepid something which causes
vomiting. It was given me to say, that in such a heat, as in spurious
delight, worms are engendered, for it becomes putrid. - 1748, April
7.))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1863.">1863.</span></span>

CONCERNING THOSE WHO IN THEIR LIFETIME TREACHEROUSLY SLAY MEN.
(((((There are those who, living their earthly life without conscience,
are guilty during the life in the body of murdering their fellow-men, as
with daggers or ether deadly weapons, and that, too, by attacking them
from behind.)))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1864.">1864.</span></span>

((((((One of this class came to me, clothed like a nobleman, though I
could not see his face. At his first approach he insinuated, by
suggestions and simulated faces, that he had many things which he wished
to communicate to me, and inquiring whether I was a Christian. Upon my
reply that I was, which he said he knew, he asked if he could be alone
with me, for he had something to impart to me which he did not wish
others to hear. But when I answered him that in the other life there was
no such thing as one's being alone \[with another\], as one man may be
with another on earth, and that one could not speak without many spirits
being present to hear, he approached nearer, and entered under the
occiput behind, whence it could be perceived, as in fact it was said,
that he was an assassin. While he was there I perceived, as it were, a
stroke through the heart, and then afterwards in the brain also, such as
would cause speedy death to any man living. By what art he effected his
purpose I know not, as I only perceived something deadly. He supposed I
was dead; but as such was not the case, he said he had just come from a
man whom he had killed in that manner, that is, by a poignard from
behind, saying that he was skilled in the art \[of taking life in such a
way\] that a man should not know that anything had hurt him before he
fell down dead, and that he should be reputed no otherwise than as
innocent, nay, that not even a wound should appear. But inasmuch as I
was safe, being preserved by the Lord from all such assaults, I feared
nothing \[from his malice\].))))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1865.">1865.</span></span>

((((I afterwards inquired of those who spoke with me what kind of
punishments such persons underwent in the other life; for I am now able
to know that the individual in question had recently departed from life,
and soon after having perpetrated such a deed, which was indicated by
the fact of his saying that he had come from the man he had killed, in
consequence of which something of a murderous taint still adhered to
him, which it was proper should be divulged. Of this the other spirits
had a perception, wherefore there was some delay before they were
willing to admit him to me, they withholding him in the meantime. But as
to the punishments, it was said that such wandered about in deserts and
forests, like the homicides before mentioned, and that it was not
permitted them to be with others.))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1866.">1866.</span></span>

((((((What they eventually become was shown me, namely, that their faces
become loathsome, not having, in fact, the appearance of faces, but of
something emaciated, of hideous hue, resembling woody fiber, having
scarcely any sign of a face, and so exceedingly monstrous, that they
could never be recognized as having been the faces of a man. Around the
cheeks was a kind of woolly appendage (:mase hwit:). <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1866-1](#fn_11.md) They at length assume, it was said,
such a face that everyone is horror-struck who beholds them; for such as
they are in society, or towards their fellow-creatures, such they are in
themselves, so that they do deadly violence to themselves, or to their
own interiors.))))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1867.">1867.</span></span>

Indeed, it may be set down as a rule, that such as a man is in his life
among his associates, such he is in himself; whence vices and atrocities
carry their own punishments with them. - 1748, April 7.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1868.">1868.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE IMPUTATION OF JUSTICE \[OR RIGHTEOUSNESS\] BY FAITH.
Since such is the condition of all in the heavens and the earth that
they live in society, and there is no life without associates, that is
to say, everyone lives from the life of all in general and from that of
his associates in particular, it thence follows that the life of
everyone is by others, which in fact is so manifest in the heavens that
no one will deny it. Only spirits not yet made angels, especially evil
ones, deny it, attributing their life to themselves, a point concerning
which I have often disputed with them, and the truth has been shown them
to the life; for while they doubt and deny, their associates sometimes
confessed that it was they who spoke through them, and so in other
cases.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1869.">1869.</span></span>

Since such is the condition of life both with spirits and with men, it
follows that to those who are in faith towards the Lord evil is not
imputed, because such an one is held by the Lord in the faith that evil
is excited by evil spirits, which is most true, and thus he is in the
verity of faith. Whatever, therefore, enters, does not defile the man.
In like manner, though a particular act is sometimes excited by the
evil, yet it is not imputed for the same reason. But this is a case of
very rare occurrence, owing to causes which, by the Divine permission, I
shall treat of elsewhere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1870.">1870.</span></span>

Whatever of good is done by the man who is in faith, as he does not
believe it to be his own, inasmuch as everything true and good is of the
Lord, so neither does he believe that the genuine good which he thinks
and does is imputed to him simply from his doing the good, because he
does not recognize it as his own, but as of the Lord's mercy,
consequently that he is no otherwise saved than from pure mercy. For the
Lord has need of no one; He possesses all things; and if it should
please Him to create anew innumerable heavens and stock them anew with
countless hosts of angels, what should hinder Him, seeing He is
omnipotent? Wherefore all is of mercy alone. - 1748, April 7.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1871.">1871.</span></span>

There are three things which constitute the principal heads of faith, to
wit, that the Lord rules the universe; that the Lord is the life of the
universe; and that all salvation is of mercy.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1872.">1872.</span></span>

These three contain within themselves indefinite particulars; this is
the faith of the heavens.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1873.">1873.</span></span>

A fourth is, that it is acknowledged in the universal heaven that in
man, spirit, and angel the proprium - what is especially his own - is
nothing but evil, while whatever is good with all, that is, all of the
Lord alone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1874.">1874.</span></span>

Evil spirits deny all these things; some do not know the truth; and some
who do know it are unwilling to acknowledge it. Good spirits believe all
these things with an intellectual faith; angels perceive them, and with
a more manifest perception the more interior they themselves are.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1875.">1875.</span></span>

The principal intellectual point which it is given to the angels to
understand is, that the universal heaven forms a Grand Man, with all its
parts, to which angels, spirits, and men correspond, and of which the
Lord is the only life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1876.">1876.</span></span>

THAT SPIRITS CONVERSE AMONG THEMSELVES. Certain spirits confessed that
they conversed together as men do with each other, but with the
difference, that it is permitted to no one to speak in any other than
his true character, as otherwise he has to undergo a penalty. - 1748,
April 8.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1877.">1877.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE WORD OF THE LORD. ((((The Word of the Lord is in itself
dead, as it is bare letter, but in reading it becomes vivified by the
Lord according to the faculty of intelligence and perception granted to
each one by the Lord; thus it lives according to the life of the man who
reads, on which account it is marked by an endless variety. This is
written in the presence of angels. - 1748, April 9.))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1878.">1878.</span></span>

CONCERNING LIBERATION FROM EVIL. The Lord is never the cause of evil,
consequently He never expels evil by evil, but does away evil by good.
This law, which is acknowledged in heaven, is difficult of comprehension
to those who are not celestial. This was given to me while engaged this
day in praying the Lord's Prayer. - 1748, April 8.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1879.">1879.</span></span>

CONCERNING THOSE WHO LIVE ONLY IN EXTERNALS. It was vividly represented
to me in sleep that I was in some other place, to wit, in Sweden, when
yet I knew that I was at Amsterdam, which caused me much wonder that I
could be in both places at once, and could appear before the eyes of
others as being there when I was here. This fact, however, I detected in
sleep.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1880.">1880.</span></span>

There appeared as if at Upsal a theater formed consisting of statues of
brown color, which were placed around in the fashion of a theater having
a somewhat handsome appearance. While looking upon the scene, one or two
of them, as if they had been brown colored skeletons, moved themselves,
and made a beginning as if they would have instituted a theatrical play,
and I wondered whether all the statues would be made thus movable and
enter upon the play.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1881.">1881.</span></span>

While I was there in a somewhat elevated position, where the statues
stood in front, and being about to witness the performance, I seemed to
myself to be ordered to go out, which I did, and awoke.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1882.">1882.</span></span>

Being awakened, I spoke with the spirits respecting the dream then so
vividly impressed upon me that evening seemed as if it happened in a
waking state, nor could I believe otherwise. At this the spirits
marveled, because they in like manner supposed that they had been in a
wakeful state, and some of them acknowledged the parts which they had
acted. It was then said that such spirits appear \[thus\] at times to
the eyes of certain ones, both those who are of a pretty good life, and
those who have lived in external things as in theatricals. They supposed
also that those who are devoted to the theater, and love that kind of
life. and those who are of a kindred spirit with them, inasmuch as there
is very little in man's externals, and consequently the case is the same
with them after death. - 1748, April 9.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1883.">1883.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE PUNISHMENT OF CERTAIN ONES WHO ARE PLUNGED, AS IT WERE,
INTO DEEP CLOUDS. I beheld the punishment of one who said he was tempted
as to whether he could, by means of evils, obtain power for himself so
that by evil doing he might strike a terror into others, and thus rule,
as such is the opinion of many, to wit, that it is the best way to rule
among fellows and over subjects by fear, and not by love. Inasmuch as
this one was of such a quality, he began to perpetrate evil, which was
represented by an axe wherewith he would strike a beam, but his
intention was to strike men, the beam being substitute. While engaged in
this atrocity he was suddenly let down into a cloud, as a kind of cloudy
sea without a bottom. Such, it was said, was the punishment of this kind
of offenders when possessed of but a feeble degree of life. - 1748,
April 9.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1884.">1884.</span></span>

CONCERNING A CERTAIN SPECIES OF PERCEPTION BY WHICH IT IS KNOWN HOW MUCH
AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE PERTAINS TO ANY ONE. There is a certain kind of
sensation, or sensitive perception, which cannot be described - for it
is a something granted in a spiritual way by the Lord alone - by which
it is perceived how much of life is present \[to any one\]. There is
\[with some\] a certain non-vital principle, not unlike a mass of chalky
substance, from which it is inferred that a similar kind of life
inheres; thus when it seems good to the Lord He grants to the angels to
know how much of life pertains to a spirit or a soul, and that with much
variety. - 1748, April 10.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1885.">1885.</span></span>

CONCERNING PROVIDENCE. Conversing with spirits concerning Providence
some would have it that it was predestinated that they should live as
they did in the world, and that afterwards they should undergo such
punishments as they did, as also that some should be inferior to others.
But the case is this, that nothing occurs but what is provided to happen
just as it does, because man is of such a quality as he is, it being
foreseen that if the case were otherwise he would perish; wherefore it
is provided that that should be permitted, in order that the Lord might
bend \[everything\] to a universal end, or to the greatest good. This
also I have learned by lively experience. - 1748, April 10.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1886.">1886.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE SPHERE OF HEARING. Certain angels and spirits who were
within showed me experimentally the quality of the sphere of hearing:
for when I spoke with spirits on a former occasion, I was heard both by
those who were within and those who were without; it was evident to all
who were around me; but I then perceived a certain one to be attracted
in a more especial manner outwardly, which I was informed was done by a
spirit above and around me, in order that such might perceive everything
which I thought and spoke. Thus there was an open communication and a
sensible attraction, and indeed at times with a sensation of pain; but
on this occasion there was an attraction effected by angels and spirits
towards me, thus inwardly but not outwardly, there be in no such
relaxation as there was before, which it was given me distinctly to
perceive, whence there was no hearing or perception as to what I said or
what I thought on the part of the spirits above or without me. On this
account they complained and confessed that now for the first time they
perceived and heard nothing; they only knew that I spoke with those who
were within. Hence it may be concluded how the case is with the sphere
of hearing, as also that those who are without the Grand Man cannot
perceive the things which are perceived by those who are within.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1887.">1887.</span></span>

Their speech addressed to me was heard, but still as if absent, and not
as when the communication is open. - 1748, April 10.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1888.">1888.</span></span>

THE KINDS OF SPIRIT-SPEECH. There are very many species of the speech of
spirits. The particular kinds are indefinite, as numerous as the spirits
themselves. Every one, like men, may be recognized from his speech. The
distinctive peculiarities of each one are in like manner multifarious,
being changed according to spiritual states, and the states of the
affections.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1889.">1889.</span></span>

The kinds of spirit-speech in general, as well of the evil as of the
good, as now observed, are these: 1. There is a common speech pertaining
to spirits formed solely from ideas with little or no affection. 2.
There is a kind almost entirely devoid of spiritual ideas, and thus of
sonorous words, but tacit only, and of the affections; such is usually
the speech of evil spirits, or genii, who rule the affections or
cupidities of men, and pervert them in such a manner that a man is not
aware how he is led, as they latently reflect or bend his good
affections into evil ones. 3. The third kind is like a flowing stream,
but occasionally varying itself into a sort of pulse or stroke, which is
their interior, in which they can speak, and their speech exhibit itself
in that kind of stream. 4. The fourth kind is a speech of ideas without
the fluent quality, but which is yet perceived as something tacitly
creeping, which is their thought. This did not come to the perception of
my thought when they conversed with each other, neither did they wish me
to be present; when I was present, the course of their thought was
directed according to mine, otherwise according to their own. - 1748,
April 12.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1890.">1890.</span></span>

THAT SPIRITS PRESS ON TO OBTAIN DOMINION OVER MAN. There was a great
dispute among the spirits growing out of the fact that they wished to
rule me, for it is their aim to obtain the utmost stretch of power, and
this was manifested so many times that I could scarcely number them.
They burn to have man subjected to them, and that sometimes with such
pertinacious eagerness that they can scarcely bring themselves to
desist; yea, they had recourse to insidious wiles and were indignant
towards certain others who approached, for the reason that they supposed
they were designing to rob them of their dominion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1891.">1891.</span></span>

Such are their efforts in regard to men of all classes, but with this
difference, that when they are intent upon their object and yet cannot
effect it, they are driven away; but with me, inasmuch as they knew that
they were spirits and not me, they could reflect upon the matter,
wherefore there was a bursting forth into open indignations and hatreds;
with others this open outbreak could not take place. - 1748, April 12.
With good spirits this course of action is not allowed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1892.">1892.</span></span>

THAT NEITHER MAN NOR SPIRIT KNOW EVEN THE MOST GENERAL \[communissima\]
THINGS WHICH ARE IN THE HEAVENS. It was shown me today by spiritual
vision that we do not know even the most general of the things which are
in heaven; as, for instance, that one single point of thought, which man
esteems most subtle and complete, contains within itself, if I may so
say, the universal heaven, for something enters into it from singular
the things in heaven, which indeed appears wonderful, nevertheless it is
so, just as in every the minutest part of the body there is a
communication of singular the effects which are wrought in the \[whole\]
body. - 1748, April 23.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1893.">1893.</span></span>

In like manner that faith alone in the Lord saves, - that the Lord rules
the universe, and the most singular things of the universe, - that the
Lord is all in all, - besides other things which are most general and
comprehend indefinite particulars within them. Those most general things
in man are as nothing compared with the knowledge of their particulars;
so also that which is called hell and that which is called heaven is
most widely general, and as it were nothing compared with what they
severally comprehend.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1894.">1894.</span></span>

CONCERNING ANGELIC MODES OF SPEECH. It was given me today to examine
very closely how the case is with angelic modes of speech, which are
exceedingly difficult of comprehension to man in the body, so much so
indeed that I should scarcely suppose them capable of being generally
grasped by the human intellect, as they are virtually inexpressible.
There are many knowledges with which the human mind ought to be imbued
before it can perceive them even by a general idea. In order to convey
somewhat of them I would observe, that in one simple idea of the human
mind there are things indefinitely various which are apprehended by man
as a kind of most general one or unit, the interiors of this idea being
perceived by the interior angels, and the still more interior and inmost
things by the more interior and inmost angels. Thus while the general of
the idea appears to the interior angels, forming a scarcely appreciable
element of their thought, this unfolds itself into indefinite
particulars comprehensible by the still more interior angels, and so
also by the inmost.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1895.">1895.</span></span>

The case is similar in regard to spiritual and to celestial ideas, or
those which are merely the ideas of things, and those which have
relation to the affections, for they are distinct.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1896.">1896.</span></span>

Thus, for instance, while the Lord's Prayer was being uttered, there was
in each single idea, though understood simply by man and sometimes
according to the terms as they conveyed a merely human sense, a sense
perceived by the angels replete with interior, more interior, and inmost
things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1897.">1897.</span></span>

Things corporeal and worldly serve the spirits for a subject or
receptacle, as it were, of the idea; natural things, such as the
significations of ideas or words, to the angels of the interior heavens;
spiritual things to the angels of the more interior heaven; and
celestial things to the angels of the inmost heaven. There is,
therefore, an ascent through degrees, and through correspondences, such
as I believe no mortal understands, on which account a great many things
are to be previously learned before one can comprehend even a very
general idea of the modes of angelic speech. - 1748, April 25.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1898.">1898.</span></span>

Those most general or unitary things which are the least elements of
ideas or the simple perceptions of every man, spirit, and angel, are the
recipients or receptacles, as it were, in which indefinite varieties of
higher ideas are comprehended; and these, as was observed, are in men
and spirits corporeal or worldly things; in the angels of the interior
heaven natural or spiritual, or lower celestial things; and in the
angels of the inmost heaven, things spiritual, and so on.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1899.">1899.</span></span>

An idea \[on the subject\] may also be gained from the objects of sight,
whether of the animal or vegetable kingdom; in these it is only the very
outmost things that come within the reach of the eye, while yet
everything exterior originates from inmosts, and yet the eye has no
access to these inmosts, except through various degrees.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1900.">1900.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE SPHERES OF SPIRITS. I have formerly spoken, if I mistake
not; of spheres, but only of their extension and power of action; much
remains to be said of their nature and quality, but at present I remark
simply that they possess very wonderful properties, and may be compared
to other spheres \[or atmospheres\] which either agree or disagree, and,
as it were, coalesce or clash with each other. Those spirits which are
at variance with each other perceive in an instant what is opposed to
them, and by their sphere, as it were, convert it into such things as
agree; nay, this holds even in regard to the minuter things which enter
into the composition of the spheres of others. Spheres of this kind
appear in men, but of a somewhat gross quality. The spheres of malignant
spirits pervert so insensibly good thoughts into evil ones, according to
every variety of circumstance which is present to man's idea, that
neither man nor spirit can by any means know that such is the fact; and
unless it had been given to reflect upon the subject, and to array it
distinctly before the mind, and to know who the spirit was and where he
was, I could never have known that facts of this nature existed.
Provided a man knows what is good and true, and what is appropriate to
these principles, and they will turn all that according to their genius,
so that whatever is in the memory of a man they will bend it \[to suit
their purposes\]. - 1748, April 29.
