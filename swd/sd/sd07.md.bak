### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="1801.">1801.</span></span>

While some of those humours stagnate or are without an outlet through
which they may be discharged, they not only occasion inconveniences, but
diseases, even deadly ones, which is a common occurrence in the body,
when no opportunity is afforded for the discharge of excrementitious
humours, as a stagnation, putrescence, corruption then ensues which
destroys everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1802.">1802.</span></span>

Those who correspond to the first kind of humours are such as we have
already spoken of, namely, those who instigate others to dissensions,
hatreds, and strifes, and thus to various kinds of mischief, in order
that they may obtain dominion. They are, as was said, at a medium
altitude above the forehead. I spoke with them, \[and learned that\]
their punishment is, being tortured in a manner almost similar to that
of the humour between the meninges by somewhat large fluctuations, which
previously I had not observed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1803.">1803.</span></span>

Another kind, namely, that which is from within the fibers, is forced
into the mammillary processes, and there stagnates. Of this I think I
have spoken before. Their punishment is almost similar to that of those
who are tormented by rotations and resistances.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1804.">1804.</span></span>

The third class are those who cause the greatest injuries to man,
namely, those represented by the stagnant humours within the ventricle,
which are of a threefold kind, in regard to one of which it was shown me
that they occupy a very high position, and speak as gently as if they
were interior spirits, so that they can very easily deceive the unwary,
as they actually did deceive those \[interior ones\]. Their speech is
voluble and soft, and at the same time interior, for they think more
than they speak; and while they deceive good spirits, they act by means
of their thoughts. They were, in their lifetime, those who did not
openly strive to rule, because that was for them impossible, namely, to
be made princes or kings, or lords, but yet they plotted to render
themselves so intimate with, and so necessary to, kings, princes, and
lords, that they should do nothing without their counsel and dictation.
Indeed, they boast themselves of this in the presence of others, but
when they perceive that they are liable to be deprived of that power,
they speak modestly, attributing everything to their prince. The blame,
however, of misfortunes they cast upon this class of dignities, or they
excuse them, while they claim for themselves the credit of whatever good
is done.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1805.">1805.</span></span>

Those of this quality, because they study themselves alone, and are thus
powerfully impelled by self-love, persecute and hold in aversion others
who do not favor them. Such is the kind of humours which stagnate in the
ventricles, and from which flow deadly damages; for these spirits, being
collected together like humours, distend the hollow parts, and thus
impede the operation of the nerves, depriving the blood of its liquids
and spirits; and hence they are deadly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1806.">1806.</span></span>

The punishment of such is, that they are subjected to rotation, now in
this direction and now in that, towards the different quarters of the
circle \[of the horizon\], in the first place from the left to the
right, being thus forced into gyratory motions. But these rollings or
rotations are such as to be attended with resistance, being of a twofold
kind, and attended with great torture, which continues for a long time
sometimes for several hours. This is one of the infernal punishments,
for their thoughts and interior efforts labor and reluctate in this
manner, but still they are violently driven on, while at the same time
not only uneasiness, but anguish is experienced by them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1807.">1807.</span></span>

Those who execute such penalties, that is, the discerptors or punishers,
were near me, about my head, and took great delight in inflicting the
punishment, nor did they feel disposed, as they said, to desist, even
though they tried with all their might, and they remarked that even if
they were permitted thus to punish to eternity \[the case would be the
same\]; they call this their function. It was given me to perceive their
delight that I might know its quality, and it was evident that they
would never desist if it was permitted them to continue. These are they
who, like discerptors and severe castigators of the external plane,
constitute such functions of the infundibulum, into which, when such
things pour themselves, then they torture out such a humour. - 1748,
April 1.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1808.">1808.</span></span>

CONCERNING THOSE WHO CONSTITUTE \[A CLASS OF\] SPURIOUS SPIRITS, AND WHO
OBSTRUCT THE INTERIORS OF THE VESSELS AND FIBERS. There are many of
either sex who were such in their lifetime, that wherever they came they
sought by art and deceit to obtain rule, aiming to subject men in a kind
of secret manner to themselves, especially the rich and powerful, in
order that they alone might exercise dominion under their name. But they
act so clandestinely that the man of wealth or power is not aware of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1809.">1809.</span></span>

They begin by removing others out of the way, especially the upright,
whom they persecute in various ways, and yet not by vilifying them, as
integrity defends itself, but by manifold other methods and procedures,
as by taking advantage of \[a patron's\] simplicity to pervert his
counsels, calling them evil, and attributing to him unfortunate results,
and by many other means, as I learned by lively experience, since there
were those about me of this quality, to whom it was given to obtain a
certain degree of controlling influence over me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1810.">1810.</span></span>

Such is their subtlety that oftentimes I scarcely knew that they were
swaying me, for they act in a clandestine manner, so that while they
were speaking with each other it was not granted to me to hear or
perceive what they said. It was said bothers that their counsels were
most nefarious, and such as no one could ever believe, inasmuch as it is
through magical and diabolical arts and assistance that they manage to
compass their ends. The putting to death of good men they think nothing
of; and the Lord, under whom they would fain exercise dominion, they
despise so intensely as actually to vilify and put the grossest
indignity upon Him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1811.">1811.</span></span>

Concerning these I can say they brood over the mind, as if their thought
was the interior thought of the man, so that the man, without the
special mercy of the Lord, can by no means be aware that such spirits
are present and controlling him, so covertly do they act.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1812.">1812.</span></span>

These, therefore, are they who are to be called spurious spirits, or
such as have in them nothing of life except the harder conglutinated
portions or the material things of the interiors, which enter into the
purer blood, and that without order. They are thus rather \[to be
regarded\] as sublimated and subtle poisons, than as animal spirit or
the purer blood. Their effect is, that wherever they come they stiffen
other things, inducing cold upon them, as also a torpor upon the nerves
and upon all the other several parts, as the brains with their fibers,
cavities \[cavis\]; so also upon the organs of the body, whence arise
torpors, phthises, interior obstructions, occasioning the breaking forth
of very many and very severe diseases, of which they are the interior
causes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1819.">1819.</span></span>

 <span id="fr_9"></span>[1819-1](#fn_9.md) They act in a certain regular
quadrupedal manner, but marked by slowness and heaviness. They seat
themselves upon the back part of the head under the cerebellum to the
left; inasmuch as those who adhere, as it were, to the occiput act more
secretly than others; while those who occupy the hinder part would fain
bear rule. - 1748, April 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1820.">1820.</span></span>

They reasoned with me concerning the Lord, \[affirming\] that it was
strange that He did not hear the prayers which they offered, and succor
them in their supplications. I replied \[by asking\] how it was possible
they should be heard when they had for an end such things as were
contrary to the salutary state of the human race, inasmuch as they
prayed \[solely\] for themselves against all others, thus against the
whole human race, which, however, they were not willing to acknowledge,
for self-regard and the love of universal rule were all in all with
them, and hence they could make no reply, as they perceived that in this
state heaven was shut and not opened.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1821.">1821.</span></span>

I saw them in company with women, and they said that they could derive
many valuable suggestions from them, as they were of a quicker genius,
or discovered things quicker. They took great pleasure in the society of
harlots, and I was made sensible of their delight. A multitude of women
in company with them was represented in a long and spacious court
somehow pertaining to an obscure city.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1822.">1822.</span></span>

It is wonderful how intensely such spirits apply themselves to secret
and even to magical arts in order that they might fascinate, as it were,
those with whom they wish to stand high, and to rule under their
auspices; thus they shrink from nothing, however abominable, for they
are poisoned in their interiors, which is itself a most nefarious thing;
they are wherefore like interior poisons which penetrate the pores; the
same is to be said of such a spurious spirit or blood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1823.">1823.</span></span>

I spoke with them through a certain interior speech, when they wondered
that I gave to the poor, supposing that that would be meritorious, and
therefore not to be done. I replied that it was done solely for the sake
of conscience, for conscience dictated it, and if it were contrary to
conscience it would be sin, which would carry its punishment with it, as
there is \[always\] punishment in sin. But \[in the present case\] there
was no expectation of reward, and so nothing meritorious. Indeed I then
perceived by a spiritual idea that if even the least degree of the
meritorious was present in what was done, nothing of reward would
accrue, for all reward is of mercy, to which everything of self-merit is
repugnant. Wherefore certain spirits wonder much that they obtain
nothing, inasmuch as they performed good deeds in their lifetime, but
the reason is, that they did everything from a selfish motive, for the
purpose of obtaining a reward. The case, however, is different when one
acts from simplicity and innocence, not being aware but that the hope of
reward is a proper motive of action.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1824.">1824.</span></span>

Nor was there anything which they perceived in others which they did not
seize upon \[and draw\] within themselves and endeavor to pervert; and
so with whatever there was that was agreeable to me, but which they were
not inclined to favor. The case with spirits is such, that all their
endeavors come forth into the light, for they then act from their own
genius, which is manifested, and in virtue of which they are of such a
quality, and they act as spirits with so refined a subtlety, as to
stagger belief. The reason is that externals do not then stand in the
way. In a moment they see, perceive, pervert, favor; whatever has in it
nothing of life, whatever is deceitful, whatever is cunning, is so
manifestly open to good spirits, still more to angels, that almost
nothing can be hid; for spiritual vision involves that in it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1825.">1825.</span></span>

THAT ALL THE THINGS OF FAITH ARE FILLED FROM INMOSTS. It was said to
spirits that the nature of heaven, or of celestial and spiritual things,
which are of faith in the Lord, can by no means be otherwise than is the
case with everything which is in the animal, and everything which is in
the vegetable kingdom, to wit, that each particular proceeds from inmost
things, or from those which are most remote from the senses, and these
particulars in either kingdom are such that they can never be adequately
conceived. However deep the keenest eye may penetrate, it still detects
increasing wonders, and yet these are only in the lowest degree
advancing but little way into the interior. Without principles derived
from inmosts, which are all in all lower things in orderly arrangement,
nothing would ever exist or subsist, nor would there be anything such
that life from the inmosts could enter into it. The case is the same
with each one of the ideas of men, spirits, and angels who are led by
the Lord; the wonderful and incredible things begin first in the
interiors. - 1748, April 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1826.">1826.</span></span>

It is wonderful that ideas are more filled by the Lord while man does
not particularly attend to them or does not aim himself to fill them,
and so does not advert to them. Thus I think the ideas of little
children are much more filled than those of adults while praying the
Lord's Prayer; for the adult is liable to be disturbed in his ideas, so
that they are less easily filled, the things of his proprium
interfering; which will indeed sound like a paradox, while I have
learned it by lively experience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1827.">1827.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE INTERIORS OF MAN. I spoke with spirits concerning the
interiors of man, observing that the learned of this age know nothing
beyond the distinction of man into internal and external, and even that
is not a truly scientific distinction, but one founded simply upon \[the
letter of\] the Word of the Lord, as they distinguish only between the
body and the mind, and even concerning these they dispute as to what the
body is, and what and which the soul is, being ignorant that in respect
to every single thing in man the case is as in heaven. It is said, \[for
instance,\] that to the body only pertain the external senses, together
with the pleasures and appetites of the senses; that such is properly
the nature of the body. They are ignorant that a certain natural mind is
given, which is almost similar to the mind of brutes, for to it belong
cupidities, phantasies, and imagination - a mind to which philosophers
have attributed material ideas. This, however, is distinguished from the
corporeal principle. There is, moreover, a mind still more interior or
intimate, which is truly human, for it is not given in brute animals. To
it belongs the understanding and the will, and that this is interior and
superior appears from the fact that a man can think and thence will,
which a brute animal cannot, and also from the fact that that mind can
govern the concupiscences of the natural mind. Everyone knows that while
cupidities are bearing a man away, he can still reflect upon them, and
thus restrain them; that is, govern them, whence that mind is more
interior. There is, moreover, given a mind still more interior
\[intimior\] such as there is in heaven - the inmost heaven - which mind
cannot be described, for it is well known that those things which are of
thought are ruled from inmosts, the quality of which cannot be
expressed, and which give to thought itself its faculty. Thus man
corresponds with the heavens. But as these things are remote from the
ideas of the learned, who dispute only, as to these matters, whether
there be a soul, and what it is; and therefore, as long as they are
engrossed with these debates, they can have no idea of the principle in
question and its quality. - 1748, April 3.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1828.">1828.</span></span>

There are, therefore, three degrees of life within man, as there are
three degrees of life in heaven, which, for the better understanding,
may be distinguished into interior, or what is of the natural mind; more
interior \[intimior\], or what is of the intellectual mind; and inmost,
or what corresponds to the inmost or third heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1829.">1829.</span></span>

Those who are corporeal spirits, as well as men, namely, those with whom
the phantasies and cupidities of the natural mind cohere with corporeal
things, are not willing to know that an interior life is given, for they
do not perceive it, as lower principles cannot recognize such as are
interior or superior to themselves. Thus, also, some of those who are in
the interior heaven do not wish to know that there are things still more
interior. Some, however, wish to know them, and do know them, but they
do not perceive them, etc., for that which is inferior has not the
faculty of ascending to that which is superior, because the superior is
imperceptible to such persons, wherefore they do not suppose it to be
given. Accordingly, the things which are interior cannot be perceived by
those which are exterior, neither can they believe the things which are
to be believed unless they be gifted with faith, for they are
imperceptible to them. - 1748, April 3.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1830.">1830.</span></span>

THAT UNIVERSALS CORRESPOND WITH THE THINGS WHICH ARE IN MAN, AND THAT
OTHERWISE SINGULARS COULD NOT SUBSIST. It may be known that the organs
of the body correspond entirely to their atmospheres and their modes of
action, as the eye to the ether, the ear to the air, the tongue to the
things which swim in the water and excite \[the taste\], the nostrils to
the odors in the atmosphere; and thus the singulars are formed to the
modifications of their universe \[or whole\], and become in this way
their conforming organs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1831.">1831.</span></span>

Man, in like manner, could by no means subsist, unless he, as a part,
should correspond similarly with the Grand Man as to all his forms of
life; so unless this universal man existed, or the universal body with
its organs, particulars could not subsist or consist; which body, or
which man, as a universal, is in itself merely organic, having its life
from the Lord, and thus man is ruled by the Lord; otherwise no life
whatever, either of man, spirit, or angel, could be conceived. Whatever
is particular lives from what is common, because it is a part of the
common; and whatever is singular lives from its universal, for it is a
part of the universal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1832.">1832.</span></span>

These axioms are true; and if anyone receives them as principles, he
will see an indefinite chain of truths, otherwise he will see nothing
but falsities and phantasies. - 1748, April 5.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1833.">1833.</span></span>

In like manner \[it is to be observed\] that in all universals, and
between universals, and thus between their singulars, there reigns a
species of love, by reason of which they esteem themselves of no
account, but are for the sake of others, which is a sacred law in all
universals, as also in \[all\] kingdoms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1834.">1834.</span></span>

There is, moreover, one sun which gives light to all its universals,
from which they live, and all and singular things are its organs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1835.">1835.</span></span>

Then, again, nothing exists and subsists without the heat of that sun,
in the absence of which all things grow torpid.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1836.">1836.</span></span>

It is also to be remarked that posteriors recognize their priors as a
kind of parents from which they exist and subsist, besides other things;
which laws are most manifest in all kinds of created universals, from
which, if assumed as principles, an indefinite succession of truths will
open up; for in the fact now stated is the agreement of all things, and
the conservation of all things. - 1748, April 5.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1837.">1837.</span></span>

Once more, we observe that all true harmony in universals derives from
hence its beauty, to wit, that it is not beautiful in itself but from
others, and so from \[the contributions\] of all; thus all and each
\[singula\] conspire; wherefore if one thing does not regard another,
instead of regarding itself alone, there can never exist anything
harmonic.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1838.">1838.</span></span>

THAT THERE IS SUCH A THING GIVEN AS BEING RIGHTLY INDIGNANT. It is also
given to be properly indignant, or fortryta godt \[i.e. to have a good
grudge\], which is peculiar to love, as of certain infants or innocents
when they are indignant. This was shown to me through a certain class of
spirits who were good, but still indignant that they did not come in for
a share when something delectable was obtained by others. But whence
those spirits were I do not yet know. I spoke a little with them, and
they are good, whence I knew that there was such a thing as being
properly indignant; for I perceived their indignation, and they induced
it on my face. - 1748, April 5.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1839.">1839.</span></span>

CONCERNING A CIRCUMFUSED SPIRITUAL SPHERE, AND ITS OPERATION UPON
SPIRITS. That every spirit possesses a sphere of its own activity, may
be seen elsewhere; thus several spirits together, or societies of
spirits, form a common sphere. There were certain societies of good
spirits - angels, I think - that formed a sphere which I very plainly
perceived, because I was led into it by the Lord. I had no distinct
perception of their thoughts, though it was evident enough that they
were good; but how such spheres are perceived, inasmuch as it is by a
spiritual idea, cannot be described; nor, in fact, can it be understood,
except by those who have experienced it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1840.">1840.</span></span>

((((Into such a sphere, which was nothing else than as a sphere of purer
thoughts, surrounding my mind even to manifest perception, certain
classes of spirits were admitted who spoke with me, and they were
similarly affected by that sphere, so that they spoke in a manner that
was not usual with them, to wit, in accordance with the activity of that
sphere. Their discourse was more flowing \[fluidior\] than ordinary, and
there was a more full understanding of things by them, for such is the
operation \[affectio\] of spheres. Those \[who are in them\] are in a
more intelligent state, or, as I may say, in a more intelligent aura;
and that I might be more fully assured on this head, certain spirits of
a duller and harder discourse were admitted into the same sphere, and
they likewise spoke in an unwonted manner, being affected by the sphere,
not only as to the flow of the speech, but as to the understanding of
the subject.))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1841.">1841.</span></span>

((((((That such spheres act upon men appears at times from their speech,
as also from a better and keener understanding of the things which they
think and speak; the same fact appears also from the animus \[by which
they are promoted\], as the singulars of the sphere apply themselves
\[and produce effect\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="1842.">1842.</span></span>

Others were also admitted into that sphere that I might perceive the
result, as, for instance, those who would fain be innocent from
themselves; and as the sphere was angelic, their state was represented
to me by an infant, signifying innocence which vomited milk from its
mouth. Such is the state of those who, in that kind of sphere, simulate
innocence, or would fain be innocent from themselves - a character,
however, which they no more sustain than do the little stomachs of
infants bear to be gorged with milk, which they nauseate and reject, as
is the case with the stomachs of those who indulge too much in
intoxicating drink.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1843.">1843.</span></span>

Afterwards those were intromitted into the same sphere who would fain
make themselves intellectual from themselves, but the quality of their
state was represented by their faces. They appeared as having faces that
were sharp, though quite comely, and wore upon their heads
sharp-cornered hats, from which darts projected. These faces appeared,
however, not so much human as they did as sculptured faces, void of
life. Such is the state of those in a sphere of this kind, who would
voluntarily intrude themselves, and be spiritual from themselves.))))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1844.">1844.</span></span>

That the universal heaven and the earth, in general and in particular,
are ruled by a sphere emanating from the Lord, may hence be manifestly
apparent; and that thus iniquities and malignities may be driven away
and their force enfeebled, so as to be unable to effect anything, may be
abundantly evident. There were certain evil spirits, who, while they
came within such a sphere, were wholly unwilling to remain there, as it
was irksome to them, and put them into a kind of anguish, when they were
prompted to retire. From this it may be known how it is that evil
spirits are driven away, lest they should universally enter into man,
besides many other things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1845.">1845.</span></span>

While speaking, thinking, or, as now, writing in such a sphere, each
single thing acts in conformity with the action of the sphere, nor can
anything be said, thought, or written, not even the minutest iota, which
is not conformed to the sphere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1846.">1846.</span></span>

That the activities of spheres surround men may be inferred from a
multitude of things, yea, even from natural things, which are
encompassed by spheres, and which could neither exist nor subsist
without them; and it is wonderful that the learned have not directed
their thoughts to the subject of spheres, inasmuch as they are of such a
nature as to manifest themselves in a variety of ways, and that, too, in
every department of the threefold kingdom \[mineral, vegetable, and
animal\]. Indeed, not even the smallest particle exists, which has not
its own sphere around it, and conforming parts constitute a common
sphere, itself also conforming to the parts. There are given spheres of
all things, as well in respect to their activities as to their
torpidities; as, for instance, spheres of heat and of cold. In things
spiritual and celestial the matter is still more distinct, more
extensive, and more manifest to those who are themselves spiritual and
celestial.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1847.">1847.</span></span>

The sphere of the Lord, which is the Truth Itself and the Good Itself,
extends itself into the universe, embracing, cherishing, vivifying, and
thus arranging, all and singular things. But the subject is too
extensive to be treated in the most general manner, even in the compass
of innumerable pages. - 1748, April 6. ((((((From spheres arise
sympathies and antipathies, which are numerous. From spheres, too, are
the vegetations and growths of seeds and roots in the earth.))))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1848.">1848.</span></span>

There was represented to me an infant which vomited milk. It was under
the plane of the right eye. A face as it were sculptured, as intimated
above, appeared in the plane of the head in front, somewhat higher than
the forehead, at a moderate distance in front.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1849.">1849.</span></span>

(((((In the same sphere there was represented to me, or seen by me, an
infant, or an angel as an infant, clothed with a little crown of flowers
of splendid blue color, and having similar floral crowns of other colors
about the breast, by which was signified the quality of the sphere. -
1748, April 6.)))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="1850.">1850.</span></span>

HOW THOSE ARE REPRESENTED WHO THINK HEAVEN IS TO BE MERITED BY
HUMILIATIONS AND SUPPLICATIONS. There are those who think that heaven is
to be merited by supplications, yet they pray not for others, still less
for all, but only for themselves, and thus their prayers are not heard,
except, perhaps, in regard to earthly things. One of this character \[a
female spirit\] was represented standing erect above the plane of the
right eye, at a moderate distance and a little to the right, covered
from the head to the feet with a kind of dirty linen robe, so that the
face and head did not appear; from a standing position she threw herself
prostrate, and then crept upon the ground; but this was a humiliation
prompted by selfhood, and very similar was the humiliation by sackcloth
of certain ones in former times.
