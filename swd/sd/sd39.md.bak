### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="3401.">3401.</span></span>

I first observed that spirits who spoke from their places in other
spheres could not then have spoken; that he entered into their
phantasies, and \[the phantasies\] of those spirits of whom I could not
imagine such a thing: so that they said they could not speak as before,
which I also heard; thus also did he enter into their ideas, and
constrained \[them\] by means of phantasies, and also cast them into
other regions by means of phantasies; so that they would be on another
side; they were now in other regions, and spoke differently from what
they did before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3402.">3402.</span></span>

He did not wish to speak; but when I was thinking, and supposed that I
spoke with him, he then had such phantasies that he did not at all think
concerning those things of which I thought: besides, also, contrary to
my apperceived opinion; but when I thought and spoke, then he excited
all men or spirits with whom I am acquainted: for he was not in the idea
of my thought, but only in the idea of those who, as it were, were
adjoin to my ideas, not next, but remotely; in a word, he excited
persons or spirits who were far away or remote from my ideas: for every
idea whatever of man's is accompanied, not only by places, but also
persons, just as if persons were adjoined to them. Therefore, when I was
thinking, they perceived nothing at all from my idea, but the idea of
his phantasy was afar off, yea in persons, as I have said, whom he so
excited, that it \[seems\] wonderful and incredible to others that it
can so happen.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3403.">3403.</span></span>

Hence may be concluded that there are spirits who can excite such things
from the ideas of others, as the thinker is never aware of it, as was
previously confirmed to me from those who saw excrements when I was not
giving heed, and that there are other spirits who excite from every idea
whatever such things as are suitable to them and their nature, as has
been often observed previously. Wherefore spirits are given, who excite
all things, whatsoever that are in man's idea: some, proximate things;
some, the more remote things; some, even things that follow after
\[consequentia\]. This was such a one that he only excited men that I
knew, and thus that flowed from the idea and were remote, but not the
next ones, that is, those of whom I thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3404.">3404.</span></span>

He was shown to me, so far as his nature is concerned, to wit, that as
it were from his eyes, but it was from the ears, there appeared to go
forth, on both sides, rays, like bright stings, such as pertain to
certain insects who have stings on both sides; but his were bright which
it was granted me to force towards myself and dispose \[arrange\]
differently; he drew back these bright stings, and spread them out now
towards me, now to the sides, now towards the hinderparts of his head:
and it was said that when he thrust forth the rays towards the occiput,
and there united them, then he collected all; thus \[he was then\]
remote from the idea; for when he thrust forth the bright stings at the
back, and united them, then he excited persons remotely from the idea;
when he extended them towards the sides, left and right, that \[he was\]
thus in the idea, not so remotely; and when he applied them towards me,
that he then \[excited\] those who \[are\] nearer in the idea; when \[he
put them forth\] straight out and indeed crossed them, which I also
seemed to myself able to have done, then \[he excited\] those who were
nearest in the idea. It follows, and is insinuated, that the matter is
so. Except that he was shown \[to me\] nothing appeared of his face, as
I was told, save only the beard and ears, from which the stings \[came
out\] - but he could vary these things, so that spirits were ignorant of
what form was his face. Moreover he is invisible.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3405.">3405.</span></span>

Since he excited persons by means of his phantasies, for whatever was in
the idea concerning persons he collected and held the intuition therein,
thus enters the ideas of spirits which he penetrated, therefore persons,
to wit, that is spirits, could not resist: but he excited their ideas,
and so enter into their ideas, and as it appeared, attracted them to
himself as has been said. I also heard other persons who complained, and
then seemed not in their own place as before, but in a place between him
and me: yea, as it seemed to me, he also excited the whole of Gehenna,
which was heard near at hand under my left ear, so that Gehenna was near
the left ear, and I heard their shrilly sounding gyres; thus by his
phantasies he perverted spheres, so that they were no longer heard in
their place: wherefore if such begin to rule, the situation of the Grand
Man would be perverted, as to the world of spirits. When they acted into
my body their action was into the middle of the left arm, or into his
forearm \[cubitum\], as \[which\] was shown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3406.">3406.</span></span>

I slept at intervals \[passim\], and awoke three or four times, and when
I awoke he was present in his place, and continued: for he had no power
on sleepers. There were also some spirits with me, who were asleep, whom
he could not excite, but \[only those\] who were awake. In \[my\] sleep
I dreamed that dogs had those things which were mine: that I pursued
them because they carried off my things; but suddenly they ran along a
certain steep way, and hid themselves; and \[the way\] appeared still
steeper down. But the dogs hid themselves under a table, with some one,
thus not seen by me; when I awoke I thought concerning the dogs and
concerning the precipice that was before \[me\]; then the greatest
possible horror of the precipice \[hissna\] affected me: and thus twice
or thrice when I thought concerning the precipice, which horror
\[hissna\] inflowed from him, who has so great a horror for such a
thing, I was told that he never dared to think concerning the angels or
concerning heaven, and that such horror \[hissna\] now springs up; so
that he can by no means attract \[draw\] angels and angelic spirits by
phantasy; if so, he would surely perish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3407.">3407.</span></span>

When he awoke he continually called the devil, so that he cried out
nothing but diabolic things, while present with me \[apud me\], perhaps
because they \[are those\] who continually call the devil, and think
they can effect everything; these he attracts, for thus he calls forth
many, because such things inhere in the phantasy of many; thus cohorts
are excited into whose phantasies he enters, and so attracts them; thus
he can \[attract\] cohorts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3408.">3408.</span></span>

When he spoke, I then supposed that he was thinking those things what he
spoke; but they said that he does not think at all of these things, but
spoke them as if not thinking; and that then he revolved in his mind
very different matters, so that he did not know what he spoke. It was
granted me to perceive that much men are given in this world, who when
they speak pay no heed, and scarcely know what they speak, but that
words flow from the mouth, and they meantime think entirely different
things: as concerning men, whom they either destroy, mislead or persuade
\[inducant\], they do not even \[think\] of those with whom they speak,
but of others, entirely unknown, whom they remember from the idea of
their speech, or \[the idea\] of others when they speak. It is now
insinuated that there are many of such a character that they can speak
concerning matters, whereof they do not think, and \[can\] think
concerning other things, so that men never know what they think of
others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3409.">3409.</span></span>

When I thought concerning the dragon, the he is of such a character, to
wit: that he thinks one thing when he speaks another; he replied to me
that he knows \[those who are\] of such a character, but that he is not
apprehended \[capiatur\] by them; but when that abominable spirit began
to operate, then the dragon was let into the Ancient Jerusalem, and
there hid in a most obscure \[place\] with Jews; it was said that the
Jews are thus hidden when such spirits come and operate, to wit: are
wrapped up \[involved\] in a darksome \[principle\] and are thus covered
up \[from view\], that the phantasies of \[that\] abominable spirit may
not reach them. It was granted me to perceive that the Jews are thus
kept far from faith, so that they wholly deny the Lord, for the reason
that they can be hidden in \[that\] most darksome \[principle\], and
that otherwise they would be drawn forth and projected \[cast out\] by
such \[evil spirits\]. The dragon with the Jews, thus thinks that they
hide themselves in darksome \[places\] wherein they say they involve
themselves; but it is now shown to the dragon, and he also confessed it,
that he could draw him forth together with the Jews, and so cast him
into his own net. The dragon supposed that he could resist by involving
himself in darkness; wherefore it was granted him to contend against
\[the evil spirit\]; and he confessed that he could not resist, unless
the Lord should guard him, wherefore he is now suppliant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3410.">3410.</span></span>

It was afterwards shown me, in what light he was, -it was said, that he
was in a light \[lumine\]. There was in the light a fiery \[principle\]
but obscure, as when darkness and the light of a fire are mingled. I was
then instructed that there were many of such a character whose subject
he was, who are nocturnal igneous lights, thus are surrounded with such
a light, and these are they who when they see in the other life that
spirits can accomplish so much with their phantasies, then not only
believe that the diabolic crew can accomplish everything, yea by
phantasies, which, I think, \[I have treated\] of here and there, in
other places, and so persuade themselves, \[but\] also addict themselves
to such things, and learn to act by phantasies so that they may be able
to effect all things: they thus suppose that they are able to direct all
things; thus addict themselves thereto and wish to be of such a sort:
thus suppose that the universe is subject to them or their phantasies.
It was also shown me, that this is their character, and thus they
suppose they are rulers \[lords\] of the universe. They are nocturnal
lights, yea, waxen lights, rather, because there is in them more of
sulfur than tallow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3411.">3411.</span></span>

I wished to know whence such come; for I did not wish that they should
be from our earth. He said, that he was from the stars; others said that
he was a cannibal; concerning whom I spoke with spirits, and it was
shown that they were of such a character: moreover the nature of their
delight when they kill man and wish to eat him, which delight was great;
also that such have lived; wherefore they are so denominated; but I am
unawares whether such still live; thus whether the Calmucks are of such
a character. I was informed that such \[persons\] can hardly go forth
from any other world than this, wherein they hold each other in such
deadly hatred, that not only do they most cruelly treat others, but when
the actuality once comes into play, that easily does the cruelty there
let loose, extend itself as amongst the cannibals. I also spoke
concerning the Jews, that they hold Christians in such a deadly hatred;
whether true I know not, but it is reported that \[such is the case\] at
Prague - yea, that nothing is more pleasant to them than human blood;
also that some are possessed by such insane anger or fury, as even to
desire to feed on such things in \[their\] fury.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3412.">3412.</span></span>

Wherefore this world has now wandered so far into externals, as so far
into cruel thoughts, inwardly that externals are by themselves, and
speak well so that no one apperceives that \[ut, I think\] internals
think cruelties; wherefore the last times of this \[world\] are at hand,
unless they return to reason.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3413.">3413.</span></span>

Still because the sphere of that phantasy is dispersed, only around me
the regions are altered, so that they who appeared below are now above;
but it should be observed that only the regions are thus changed before
them who are not in faith; yet the regions of the Grand Man, still
remain to eternity before those who are in faith, for it is impossible
that phantasies can effect anything as regards the Grand Man; for the
sphere of those phantasies is dispelled whensoever it pleases the Lord -
only to me was it shown how the case stands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3414.">3414.</span></span>

There also came cohorts, who are wont to disperse illy - associated
\[things\] like the hilled \[spirits who are\] highway robbers; then
also the east wind which \[I have mentioned\] before. But they could not
shake off \[disperse\] the sphere of those phantasies. On the other hand
they \[those phantasies\] also carried them away, so penetrating was the
sphere of those phantasies; but another more subtle east wind was heard
and perceived around my head and ears; into it they could not operate by
phantasies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3415.">3415.</span></span>

It was asked what they wished to do with those whom they drew to
themselves, and collected by phantasies; they said that they would wrap
them in a net and cast them into a sea or abyss; wherefore some wished
that they should mean a flood: that by such \[phantasies\] they perished
as by a flood. Whether there was such a correspondence of a flood, then
in the antediluvian times appears probable; but that the flood took
place is evident from very many things whereof I spoke with them: but as
to Noah's Ark, there were many things which induce me to believe that it
signifies something else: for instance, that there must be place and
food \[pasana\] also water for so many animals, which \[were contained\]
therein, and that \[the ark\] must have been so capacious. But I drop
these matters, because there are spirits who desire to confuse thereby,
what facts have actually transpired: so that I think that each and
everything written by Moses in Genesis, is of such a character, for
example that \[there was\] such a paradise, and Adam and other things
besides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3416.">3416.</span></span>

It was shown me that all those whom he thus collected, he involved
\[wrapped\] in a great net: for \[by his\] phantasies he induced a great
net, so that they were involved \[therein\] and also lamented: but were
let out, aggregated in balls \[conglobatim\]. It seemed that only one
was involved: who \[it was\] I do not know; when I asked they induced
\[the appearance of\] various persons: for such is their custom, that
they substitute now this one, now that; who was enclosed in the net,
that execrable spirit complained; and then one who was enclosed in the
net, spread \[exspatiatus\] himself within the net, into various regions
under my feet by various flexures. It was insinuated in me, that it was
that spirit who induced phantasies. But concerning the various spreading
\[exspatiatione\] of the last part of the net where he was enclosed, it
would be prolix to write, for the flexures were numerous. - 1748,
September 30.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3417.">3417.</span></span>

THAT PHILOSOPHERS WHO HAVE TAKEN UP PHANTASIES CONCERNING SPIRITS CANNOT
BELIEVE THAT SPIRITS ENJOY FEELING \[SENSE\] \[sensu\]. (When I
extracted what is observed in Nos. 1719, 1720, concerning spirits and
their sense, then were present certain learned ones, and their
perception was communicated to me: from which I perceived that they can
never believe \[that\] spirits can be endowed \[pollere\] with any
sense, still less a sense of pains, horrors, \[and\] terrors: thus have
their philosophic phantasies induced \[brought\] darkness on them.
Wherefore the unlearned are they who can believe. - 1748, September 30.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3418.">3418.</span></span>

THAT EVIL SPIRITS, YEA THE WORST, ARE NOT ABLE TO EXCITE THOSE WHO
SLEEP. It was observed when evil spirits and genii were the worst, were
around me, so as to be able to excite even subtler spirits by their
ideas, that they were unable \[to do so to\] those who were asleep: for
when I was awake, I apperceived near me spirits who were asleep: and
though I was then surrounded by such \[evil spirits\] that still they
were not at all able to move or excite the sleepers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3419.">3419.</span></span>

THAT THE WHOLE OF THE GRAND MAN IS AN ORGANISM, AND REPRESENTS THE PURER
MEMBRANES \[PRINCIPLES\] AND GROSSER THINGS OF THE BODY, AND THE LORD
ALONE \[REPRESENTS\] INTERIORS, THUS THE BLOODS IN THE DERIVATIVES. From
what has been observed concerning the Grand Man, it is evident that he
is only an organism, consequently a membraneous \[principle\], to which
correspond the organic, or membraneous things of the body, which are
actuated by the life of the Lord, thus think and act from the Lord. The
Lord alone, inasmuch as he is life, vivifies and actuates these things,
therefore is represented also by the animal spirits, or bloods, in the
ultimate nature of the body: for his life is as well in ultimates, as in
firsts primaries. Wherefore, whoever wishes to live, or act his own
life, cannot be in the Grand Man, but so far as he desire this, so far
does he expel himself, is purged away and rejected \[therefrom\];
wherefore the whole of the Grand Man is a patient force, or passive
force, which is termed dead in itself; but the Lord alone is the active
force, the agent, or living force: hence \[comes\] marriage, and
\[hence\] heaven is compared to a spouse \[bride\], or wife, and the
Lord alone is the bridegroom. - 1748, October 1.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3420.">3420.</span></span>

THAT THERE EXISTS NO FIXED STAR, BUT WHAT HAS ITS OWN WORLDS \[PLANETS\]
AROUND ITSELF. I spoke with spirits concerning stars \[and\] of the
origin \[ortu\] of the worlds around them; \[saying\] that no star
exists, that does not have worlds around it, because it is like a sun
and center: for nothing is created but on account of the Grand Man, as
an end, thus on account of the Lord. - 1748, October 20.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3421.">3421.</span></span>

THAT THE LEARNED WHO HAVE TAKEN UP PHANTASIES ATTEND TO NOTHING ELSE,
BUT WHAT CONFIRMS \[THESE PHANTASIES\]. I spoke with spirits concerning
the learned, \[saying\] that spirits find \[in them\] more confirmations
of such \[views\] as they have taken up from self-love \[and\] love of
the world, and assumed as principles, than \[they do\] in others: for
whatever philosophic and scientific is in men, they turn into
confirmations: they do not see anything else, or if they are excited by
other things bend them thither. In like manner do preachers \[handle\]
the things that are in the Lord's Word: they do not see those things
which conflict \[with their views\], but only such things in the literal
sense as favor \[them\]. Wherefore the more learned in the sciences, and
the more learned in the Word, the insaner are they wont to be. Hence
perhaps it happens that priests immediately as it were change their mind
when they become priests, and become more unmerciful than others, and so
forth. It is with these things as with the ideas of spirits, who see
only filthy things that are far off, \[and\] who conclude only from such
things as they see. - 1748, October 20.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3422.">3422.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE IDEAS OR SPIRITS. By means of a single tacit idea, it
could be represented to spirits, what is the nature of the idea of
inferior spirits, the nature of \[the idea\] of angelic spirits, also
\[that\] of angels, merely by their perceiving in idea, that the
interiors of an \[the\] idea belong to angelic spirits and their
interiors belong to angels: and it was at the same time said that this,
which is done and perceived in a moment, cannot be explained to man in
many pages: and still would not be perceived, yea, because he has no
perception what is an idea, still less what is inward or written ideas,
for he supposes all things to be simple: for thus do corporal men
conclude their ideas \[to be\]. - 1748, October 24.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3423.">3423.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE METRICAL THOUGHT OF SPIRITS. ((((Spirits and angels speak
metrically \[in measures\], so that their speech \[sermo\] flows
spontaneously without hindrance. They use familiar words, and no word is
introduced which multiplies the sense \[meaning\], or diverts it in
other directions; they also \[take care\] that nothing of self-love
\[springing\] from artful elegance and arrangement of the words may
flow, for these things distract \[the mind\]. When alone, without the
close \[comitante\] attention of man, they act in a more flowing manner;
also when they do not inhere in any word, but in the sense. In my case
\[their measures\] terminated in concords \[unitates\] of the simplest
possible kind. When \[they exercise\] in other \[measures\] they are
brought into concord by means of accent. These things \[are so\] on
account of the simultaneous speaking of many spirits; otherwise, many
would not be able to speak together: wherefore there must be roundness
\[to their speech\]. The last concord becomes rounded by means of its
successor, into which the preceding \[one\] is thus rolled. Metrical
speech proceeds from interiors to exteriors, through mediate ends so
called, all of which are concords. But how the harmony of speaking,
pertaining to spirits, differs from the harmony of the speech of angels,
it is not permitted to observe. These things in the way.))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="3424.">3424.</span></span>

CONCERNING LICE. ((((They who secretly assail the things which belong to
faith, and secretly pervert in various modes those who cannot know
better, are lice, especially the domestic sort, which have a foul smell.
In the way.))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="3425.">3425.</span></span>

CONCERNING MICE. ((((They are mice, who, like mice, tread upon
\[terunt\] those things which pertain to truths; just as mice do to
corn. Those are in the highest degree, mountain mice, who are better
informed, and deceitfully tread upon those things which are more
interior. Such is the character of those spirits who are in the highest
degree mice, so that they constantly trample on, and deceitfully pervert
all that is growing up, be it the true or the good. In the way.))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="3426.">3426.</span></span>

THE CONSULTATIONS OF SPIRITS. Spirits seem to themselves to hold
consultations; but they exist in a moment, because \[they proceed\] from
\[their\] nature. It is similar with their thoughts and answers. In the
way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3427.">3427.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE DRUNKENNESS OF SPIRITS. It was also granted me to know,
through visual \[ocular\] experience, yea, even to feel it a little, the
drunkenness of spirits: which is one of the infernal punishments, but
was not a hard one \[acerba\]. The same \[spirits\] were long
\[affected\] with the annoyance and stupor of drunkenness, that
previously reasoned acutely, and often they had heard many truths; hence
they became intoxicated, yea, spiritually. In the way. APPEARANCES
ACCORDING TO WHICH IT IS PROPER TO SPEAK, BUT NOT TO THINK. (1.) That
God punishes the wicked; that he is angry; that he puts away from
himself: that he does not regard, **c.** <span
id="fr_29"></span>[3427-1](#fn_29) (2..md) That man does good and speaks
truth; that man is good and true; that man lives from himself, when yet
he can neither live from himself, nor think nor will good from himself.
WHAT GOOD IS, WHAT THE TRUTH OF GOOD, AND WHAT TRUTH. Let fruit be
\[taken as an example\]: -The use which fruit answers, is good. -The
manner in which the use is to be applied, is the truth of good. -The
quality of the fruit as to taste, smell, and beauty, is truth. The odor
of fruits or flowers: -The use which odor subserves relative to the
brain, the lungs, and the heart, is good. -The manner in which it is to
be applied, so as to answer its use, as to the nostrils, the temples, or
about the head like a wreath, is the truth of good. -The quality of the
odor, and the like, are truth. Charity: -The use it serves, is good.
-How charity is to be dispensed, is the truth of good. -The quality of
charity, is truth. THE GENERAL LAW OF HEAVEN. (1.) So far as the love of
ruling enters with man, so far love towards the neighbor departs. (2.)
Thus also so far as love towards the neighbor departs, so far love to
the Lord departs; for the good which is from Him is the neighbor, and
also the truth of good. (3.) Thence it follows, that so far as the love
of ruling enters, so far a saving faith, which is from the Lord,
departs; for faith is of truth which is of good. (4.) That this is so
appears from conjugial love, which departs just in proportion as the
love of ruling enters. -Conjugial love is the fundamental of all loves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3428.">3428.</span></span>

CONCERNING THOSE WHO REJECT ALL FAITH, AND BELIEVE ONLY IN LIFE. There
was a certain spirit, somewhat obscurely visible, who first spoke with
me by ideas, and afterwards applied himself to my left ear, but in an
inverted position, his head downwards and his feet upwards, <span
id="fr_30"></span>[3428-1](#fn_30.md) and thus spoke two or three times in
my ear, while I knew not who he was or of what character. It was
afterwards disclosed to me by living discourse and by perceptions, that
of such a quality are those who reject faith so decidedly that they are
unwilling to hear of faith or of knowledges, which they think to be the
tree of knowledge that deceived Eve and Adam; and while they insist much
upon life, speaking largely of it, and otherwise exalting it, the case
is the same \[i. e., they appear inverted\] with those also who believe
\[and maintain\] the contrary, viz., such as are called Lutherans, who
say that faith alone without works saves. The former maintain that
faith, which they so entirely reject as to be unwilling to have it named
or to hear of it, does not save; indeed they are rather in the
persuasion that it damns, \[as is to be inferred\] from their speaking
only of life, as if that alone were life which they call such, though
apart from knowledge; and insisting that if it is not such, it is
nothing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3429.">3429.</span></span>

The same person, who was a subject of this class of spirits, <span
id="fr_31"></span>[3429-1](#fn_31.md) and who spoke in my ear with his head
and heels inverted, although not conspicuous, yet he afterwards appeared
to me as lying for the most part \[or most of the time\], extended in a
supine posture, and then seemed of a white body, and yet not \[to be\] a
body, but something white like one, because life is represented in this
manner. When he was examined as to the quality of the life which he
perceived, \[in himself\] it was found to be abstracted from faith, thus
from knowledges, they thinking \[i. e., the spirits whose subject he
was\] that life being present, knowledges were of no account. It was
given to say to him, as his persuasion was communicated, and, as it
were, borne in upon me, that life is that which does, and that life is
of faith, and that faith is nothing but life; and when one lives the
life of faith, that then knowledge is not perceived, as is the case with
the angels; or as a man, in speaking, does not attend to the sounds or
words, but abides in the sense of the words, so also while he lives,
that those things which are of knowledges do, as it were, perish, as
also the things which are of scientific and intellectual faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3430.">3430.</span></span>

He who thus appeared, being exhibited naked, supine, and snowy, said
that he was nothing, thinking that life chiefly consisted in that, and
this \[he reiterated\] often, that he was nothing; for which reason, and
because he was so imperceptible, evil spirits were unable to harm him,
for it was his persuasion that he was nothing, and in that persuasion
lay his life; but in what manner or respect he was nothing, I was not
able to perceive, only \[that he said it\] not from humility towards the
Lord, nor from the consciousness that there was nothing but what was
evil and impure in himself, for this he did not admit, as \[all such\]
deem themselves pure, though they do not say holy. But his or their
persuasion was, that he was then pure, and that there was nothing of
evil, still less of defiled, pertaining to them, thus that all evil and
defilement were washed away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3431.">3431.</span></span>

But this subject-spirit was not, I think, in any other persuasion than
that life consisted in this, viz., that he was nothing; but what the
being nothing is he did not know. In other things he was, compared to
others, rather open to conviction; as, for instance, when it was said
that the Lord is life, he gave his assent to it, besides other things
which he could easily be drawn to admit; wherefore his whiteness
appeared like that of a body, naked and pliable, because he himself was
pliable, as was manifest. I thus judged that he was easily led to things
that were true and good; but I now perceive that the fact was otherwise,
and also that he had lived in ignorance, and thought that \[state\] to
be everything (:his preacher or instructor, who is now with me and
directs and has directed him, does not admit what I am now writing; he
does not admit that I shall say true and good, because this involves
faith, which he regards as knowledges \[or sciences\] that pervert:) and
thought all this was so, as his preacher or instructor has taught him,
thus \[remaining\] in ignorance, because he suffers himself to be simply
and passively led; wherefore there is yet hope of him, for ignorance
excuses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3432.">3432.</span></span>

It is consequently clear that his preacher or instructor, who appeared
to me before, was present \[to him by his influence\]; for whenever he
was with him, the spirit was in a similar opinion and persuasion, and he
had the power of leading him to do \[whatever he pleased\], since he
could persuade him into whatever he wished, \[and\] thus had persuaded
him that life was all in all. He does not even admit the utterance of
the term faith, nor that of truth and good, because they are of faith.
Whether he admits love and its vocal term I doubt, for I perceive that
he does not know what love is, consequently he does not know what life
is, because he does not admit the life of faith, and scarcely the life
of love. His life therefore is perceived as being cold; but yet while he
lived in the body he did not seem to himself to have acted badly; he
rejected whatever he deemed corporeal and worldly, and being of a
serious turn, shunned everything sportive and pleasant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3433.">3433.</span></span>

And because he thus spent life without a knowledge of life, he appears
but obscurely, accordingly as he regarded life as something spiritual
and abstracted from the body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3434.">3434.</span></span>

When therefore his preacher was in his own persuasion concerning such a
kind of life, and he appeared erect in his black garment, which was
dimly seen, then the good spirits of interior quality, who were above,
appeared inverted and of a grayish white, their heads being downwards
and their feet upwards, for so his persuasion, or the sphere of his
persuasion, inverted good spirits. Afterwards, when he himself was
inverted, in his black garment, obscurely seen, it was effected with
difficulty, and the good spirits there were then erect; yea, when his
subject, whom he had persuaded, lay supine, then the good spirits who
were at the right above, and who thus led him, said that they could
stand erect, but there was still somewhat of an opposing force, as they
inclined forward to compel themselves to stand upright. And now I
perceive something cold from the preacher, who applies himself upwardly
to my head, so that cold enough exhales from him. The good spirits wish
that I should write much cold, <span id="fr_32"></span>[3434-1](#fn_32.md)
for it especially affects my hands and my left knee, and passes towards
the sole of the foot. They say it is not permitted me to feel more cold;
whence it may be known that enough is much.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3435.">3435.</span></span>

This preceptor, as he wishes to be called, or preacher, was led into
several spheres, that the quality of his life might be explored, as for
instance into the sphere of those who believe there is nothing except
evil and pollution in man; but not being able to remain in that sphere,
he now insinuates that the Lord took away all evil and pollution, so
that with man there is nothing of it left. Whether the Lord alone is
\[now\] such, he does not dare to say, because he knows that he is in
the other life, and that spirits are present who hear. I perceive,
however, by a spiritual idea, that he thinks the fact to be, that the
Lord alone is polluted, because he took away all pollution from the
human race, and that thus he will remain till the last judgment, when he
comes into glory, when it will be different, and that he chose to assume
this pollution in order to save the human race; being thus persuaded
from the fact that the Lord bore all the evils and defilements of men.
He says that he knows no otherwise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3436.">3436.</span></span>

Hence it may appear why the good spirits were inverted, viz. from his
persuasion; when the truth is altogether the reverse, and the Lord alone
is life, and the Lord alone is pure and holy, and all beings, whether
angels, angelic spirits, spirits, or men, how many soever there may be
of them, are evil and unclean, and never can have anything of good or of
life, except from the Lord: and that evil is spiritual death, and good
celestial life, and truth from good life celestial-spiritual.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3436_1/2.">3436\_1/2.</span></span>

He was brought into another sphere, where they believe there is nothing
of life but from the Lord; but there he could not abide.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3437.">3437.</span></span>

Conversing with him largely concerning the knowledges of faith, that no
true life can ever be given except through such knowledges: that without
life by the knowledges of faith, or by the doctrine of faith, that is,
by faith, there would be no need of the revelation of the Word, either
the Word of the Old Testament or the New; in order that this might be
evinced, it was given to say that otherwise there would have been no
need of his preaching, in order to instruct as to the conduct of life,
and the rejection of faith; nor would there have been any need of his
disputing with me on the subject, as life might have been immediately
infused without the Word and without his preaching: to all which,
because he was unable to answer, he confessed once or twice that it was
so, but because he was in the persuasion \[before mentioned\] he returns
to it again, and wishes to retract the words, which I have written in
this paragraph. This also he wishes to insinuate, that man is
regenerated while ignorant of it, and thus obtains life; concerning
which it was also previously given to speak with him and to say, that
such is indeed the case with regeneration, but yet \[that it is
effected\] by the knowledges of faith, and that although man is ignorant
of it at the time, yet in a state of adversity and temptation, when
bodily things recede, the things that are of faith are recalled by the
Lord to his mind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3438.">3438.</span></span>

It was also previously given to speak concerning the angelic life, that
it is a life of love, and it was intimated, that a life of love is their
felicity, inasmuch as they perceive the felicity of life in doing good;
that the celestial life is such, and thence the spiritual. It is
otherwise with men, who when born are defiled and are nothing but evil,
and are educated in the love of self and the love of the world, and such
a life can by no means be amended and reformed, except by the knowledges
of truth and good, thus by the knowledges of faith. Wherefore it was
insinuated into him, that the internal man consists of understanding and
will, and that without understanding there was never a man, and \[yet\]
that man is not born into any understanding, still less into will, but
first into intellectuals, and so is inaugurated into the intellectuals
of truth and good, which are of faith, and thus by the Lord into life:
thus the life becomes \[the life\] of the Lord, which is the life of
love.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3439.">3439.</span></span>

He was then brought to him - \[or to them\] - whose subject he was, who
thought faith alone without the works of the law to be saving, thus to
those were in a contrary persuasion, that I might see how those spheres
upon concurrence would be affected. They each confessed themselves to
have been in life Lutherans, but he who supposed faith alone without
good works to be saving, began, from the sphere of the other's
persuasion, to be changed first about the head, which appeared obscurely
white; he then became almost invisible, and complained that he could not
resist (:perhaps seeming to himself to be only inverted:), then he
appeared to recede, and his \[vacated\] place seemed as a fiery lumen,
or as something peculiarly bright.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3440.">3440.</span></span>

Above the head a little to the left in the rear stood those who favor
promiscuous marriage, from the persuasion that every good ought to be
common, thus also marriages, and \[who hold\] that the reason why
matrimonies are contracted is solely with a view to cohabitation, and
that thus the offspring may be reared as belonging to one party, while
at the same time they really belong to others. Upon being asked what he
thought of that kind of life, in which the good was thus common, he
replied, as it was given to perceive, that he did not reject it, saying
indeed that he did not approve it, yet still did not condemn it because
every good is common. That both he and the other, who was his disciple,
or former subject, thought so, was owing to the fact, that they had
their own wives, with whom, on account of the scandal, they did not wish
to have the concession take effect, but that others should think and act
thus he had not the least objection. But it was told him that this was
abominable, and that conjugial love was unique, from which not only the
love of offspring, but (:as now:) all other loves were derived; that
when this is relaxed, the most enormous license grows strong against all
conjugial love, and nothing of life remains, which is \[spiritual\]
death because there is no life of love. - 1748, October 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3441.">3441.</span></span>

It was observed that when the persuasion of that preacher or preceptor
operated in me, the perception of truth and good which I formerly had,
was, as it were, taken away, so that I could only recur to scientifics,
or scientifically to the knowledges of faith, for I did not then
perceive that marriages were so holy, inviolate and strict. Hence it may
appear how powerfully the persuasions of certain men are able to work
upon those whom they instruct, thus of this preceptor upon his disciple,
who was, notwithstanding, a king. It appears also from this, that he
before whom he stood, and who believed that faith without good works was
saving, became himself, from the sphere of the persuasion,
\[transformed\] about the head into a white cloud: for the persuasion
penetrated so deeply that he was almost ready to affirm, wherefore he
was removed. Such is the power of the sphere of persuasion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3442.">3442.</span></span>

From the incidents above related it appeared that a single expression of
the Word, which \[one interprets\] for himself according to his
phantasies, is able to induce an entirely false doctrine or heresy, and
thus a life; as, for instance, from this alone, that all goods ought to
be common, thus also wives again from this, that man is regenerated
while in ignorance of it, and without the need of knowledges; from this
also, that the Lord has borne iniquities, \[implying\] that all the
human race is pure, and that consequently the Lord alone is burdened
with sin; moreover, that life is that which is regarded, but not faith,
because it is something scientific; besides other similar things; thus
myriads of heresies may exist from the literal sense of the Word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3443.">3443.</span></span>

The subject before mentioned being elevated to heaven in order that he
might perceive a certain pleasantness communicated to me, inquired, "For
what end is such pleasantness? for I supposed that one would place his
happiness only in use, like the angels." Being then, conveyed among
those who would have the whole heaven, without exception, to be as
nothing, I perceived that he had \[in that persuasion\] his own
felicity, thus not in any use; concerning which it was given to say,
that mutual love, and a preference of another over one's self were
angelic, and that then felicity was given by the Lord (:thus now or then
I said to him:) <span id="fr_33"></span>[3443-1](#fn_33.md) and that all
were dedicated to their uses, some that they might be delighted in
marriages, some in the love of infants, some in helping the distressed
in temptations, some in resuscitating and introducing the dead, and so
on. - 1748, October 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3444.">3444.</span></span>

What the quality of that life is it was given to perceive when I sifted
the truth respecting \[the things of\] love, that they are represented
by heat, viz. that as nothing of the vegetable kind can exist and
subsist without heat, as nothing \[of this kind can flourish\] in
winter, so neither can anything \[exist\] in man without love; if
destitute of love, his life is the life of winter, which \[kind of
life\] the preacher also appropriated, as if it were no other than a
wintry life, from which nothing of truth and good, still less of the
fruit of faith, could be produced; wherefore his presence was cold, as
it was given to say to him. - 1740, October 2. I thence perceived that
it was only with the utmost reluctance that he would admit the word
love; that he did admit it, notwithstanding his repugnance, seems to
have been on account solely of the well known sexual love towards a
wife, and other similar things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3445.">3445.</span></span>

CONTINUATION. This preacher or preceptor was afterwards examined, and
conversation was first had respecting conscience, that true conscience
is not given without the knowledges of faith; but he would have it that
the human race was born into the conscience of truth, that he might
thence know what truth and good is; but it was shown, that man is not
born into any knowledge, but is viler than the brute, and unless he
received the knowledges of truth and good from education, would be much
viler than the brutes, and scarce an animal; thus that he is altogether
destitute of conscience, which is the product of those things that the
man thinks true and good. Thus it happens that false and defiled
consciences are given, as for instance when one is troubled on account
of prevarications against those things that are not true and good, but
which he only thinks to be true, and good, but which he only thinks to
be true, like heretics, idolaters, and others acting from trifling
considerations, in which there is nothing of evil; whereas conscience is
true \[when there is trouble or anxiety on account of transgressions or
prevarications\] against the things that are of the truth of faith. This
kind of conscience is never born with man, but there are first
knowledges, by which it is to be procured, and then at length it is
\[fully\] given by the Lord, so that he may sometimes be ignorant of the
causes \[from which he acts\], like a man who, having learnt languages
and sciences from infancy, becomes at last as if he did not know them,
but they follow as though they had never been acquired.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3446.">3446.</span></span>

Thus (:now:) to live honestly, to live according to laws - laws of
subordination - to study the good of the commonwealth these things are
\[first\] learned, and afterwards remain fixed; and thus it is granted
by the Lord that one should not take cognizance of what he has learned,
but that conscience should dictate. Such things were said to him, but he
was unwilling to admit them, being confirmed, it would seem, by them
\[in the belief\] that as ideas are connate with man, as it is termed,
so also is the conscience of those foul adulteries, maintaining, beside
many other things, that it became defiled from \[fallacious\] reasoning.
That conscience was such \[as I had affirmed\] he would not acknowledge;
wherefore he was elevated on high, where they perceive interior things,
that he might better perceive the truth; but being of the quality of one
without conscience, he acknowledged and yet did not acknowledge, and so
much the less as he did not admit the knowledges of faith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3447.">3447.</span></span>

It was shown also that from the sacred Word he had acquired to himself
many confirming things, by means of foul representations and shameful
nakednesses, which it is not permitted to relate; thus he was without
conscience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3448.">3448.</span></span>

Being examined also as to whether he wished to rule over others, it was
detected that he had in his mind a desire to hold all others in
subjection, thus not only the king \[above-mentioned\], whom he
transferred under his feet, and into whom he wished to infuse
persuasions, but did not fully dare to do it, but he wished to exercise
the same dominion over everyone else; so supreme with him was the love
of self. This was evinced by the vile attempts, to this end, of similar
spirits, who for a long time have been well known to me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3449.">3449.</span></span>

He desired also to inveigle the innocent, as when anything was charged
upon him, he would fain substitute the innocent \[in his place\],
pretending that even those whom he knew to be innocent were liable to
the same charge; and this that he might not only exculpate himself, but
also persuade others that it was lawful thus to substitute whomsoever he
could find. In this manner those act who are without conscience and
without love towards others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3450.">3450.</span></span>

Afterwards the fact was detected and confessed by him, that he was
leagued with them \[the adulterers\], and he disclosed the manner in
which those abominable promiscuous marriages were conducted, both in
darkness and in light; for they court obscurity, but when those whom
they fear withdraw, they bring a light and kindle it, when their rites
are detected, which from their abominableness are not to be described;
and as they say that the intercourse is to be common, so they act
promiscuously, that a wife may not know by whom she is pregnant, and
thus the progeny may be common to all, and yet may be brought up by a
husband; thus everyone acknowledges the offspring as common, and in
order to this many have connection with one \[woman\], and indeed all,
in order that the particular person may not be known. Their quality was
represented in the light by filthy swine, which they resemble.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_29"></span>[3427-1](sd39.htm#fr_29.md) It is not of course
implied by this, that, in the righteous government of God, the wicked
are not punished, but simply that this punishment results from the
contrariety of nature between the Divine Being and the offender. This
appears as the exercise of wrath on the part of God, and the Scriptures
are in great measure constructed on the principle of apparent rather
than real truth. It is the sinner who punishes himself by his own evil.
To a man with diseased eyes who looks towards the sun, it appears as if
the sun, by his positive influence, caused the pain which he feels;
whereas the true cause is in the state of his eyes, and which he may
have procured to himself by his own act. If the eye were sound the light
would not harm him. This is Swedenborg's doctrine of punishment. It is
the necessary and inevitable result of transgression, by the law of its
own working. A nature alienated from God regards God as opposed to him
and fighting against him, whereas God is unchangeable love, goodness and
mercy. Still the transgressor is punished, not only by the natural
effects of this contrariety in its bearings towards himself, but by the
malignant passions of other wicked spirits, a part of whose evil is this
very infernal prompting to inflict misery upon others in ways that are
ineffable to men in the body. The doctrine delivered by Swedenborg on
this head may be seen in what follows: - "That Jehovah has not any anger
is evident from this, that He is love itself, good itself, and mercy
itself, and anger is the opposite, and is, also an infirm principle,
which cannot be imputed to God: wherefore when anger in the Word is
predicated of Jehovah, or the Lord, the angels do not perceive anger,
but either mercy, or the removal of the evil from heaven. That anger in
the Word is attributed to Jehovah or the Lord, is because it is a most
general truth, that all things come from God, thus both evils and goods
but this most general truth, which infants, young people, and the
simple, must receive, ought afterwards to be illustrated, namely, by
teaching that it is so said to the intent that they may learn to fear
God, lest they should perish by the evils which they themselves do. The
reason why by anger is meant mercy and clemency is, because all the
punishment of the evil exist from the Lord's mercy towards the good,
lest these latter should be hurt by the evil; but the Lord does not
inflict punishments upon them, but they upon themselves, for evils and
punishments in the other life are conjoined. The evil inflict punishment
upon themselves principally when the Lord does mercy to the good, for
then their evils increase, and thence punishments: it is from this
ground that instead of the anger of Jehovah, by which are signified the
punishments of the evil, mercy is understood by the angels. From these
considerations it may be manifest what the quality of the Word is in the
sense of the letter, also what the quality of truth divine is in its
most general sense or meaning, namely, that it is according to
appearances, by reason that man is of such a quality, that what he sees
and apprehends from his sensual, he believes, and what he does not see,
neither apprehend from his sensual, he does not believe, thus does not
receive. Hence it is, that the Word in the sense of the letter is
according to those things which appear; nevertheless in its interior
bosom it contains a store of genuine truths, and in its inmost bosom
truth divine itself." - AC 6997. -Tr.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[3428-1](sd39.htm#fr_30.md) The inversion here
spoken of is to be regarded as the effect of a strong contrary
persuasion. To a certain state of mind a spirit in a directly opposite
state appears in the manner here described. In the present life the
encasement of the spirit in a material body, prevents the effect from
being realized as it is in the other. But even here it is easy to
apprehend that to a rigid Papist, for instance, a Protestant must appear
as to his moral posture, the opposite of himself, like his own image
seen in the water; and so vice versa with the Protestant. They will of
course be antipodes to each other if their feet are in contact. Yet each
appears to himself normally erect. It seems, however, from what follows,
that in some cases, where the sphere of the contrary persuasion is
peculiarly strong, that its effect may enter the consciousness of the
inverted party, and he may be aware that the other regards him as
inverted, and on this ground he may not only be said to be inverted, but
may be in a measure sensible of the effect. -Tr.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[3429-1](sd39.htm#fr_31.md) For an account of the
spirits called subjects in the other world, see AC 5856.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[3434-1](sd39.htm#fr_32.md) From this it may
perhaps be inferred that Swedenborg ultimately designed the publication
of this Diary \[now called Spiritual Experiences\]. It is otherwise not
easy to understand why the phraseology in this instance should have been
deemed of any particular importance. -Tr.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[3443-1](sd39.htm#fr_33.md) Parenthetical clauses,
like the present, frequently occur in the pages of the Diary \[now
called Spiritual Experiences\], and seemed designed to indicate some
particular impression made, from the spiritual world, upon the writer's
mind at the very time he was penning the paragraph. What this was cannot
now be ascertained, any further than as the general scope of the context
may afford grounds, more or less definite, for an inference respecting
it. -Tr.
