### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="5301.">5301.</span></span>

Thus perished that great \[city\], which is Babylon, with all their
riches, which they have amassed for ages, believing that these would
save them and that no judgment would ever take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5302.">5302.</span></span>

In order that an idea may be had of the situation, which is somewhat
confused, on account of the turning to a quarter opposite from those who
are above me, (the accompanying diagram \[Fig. 5\] <span
id="fr_163"></span>[5302-1](#fn_163.md) and the following key thereto, are
furnished).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5303.">5303.</span></span>

Lastly was seen something black flying over the place where that city
had stood. It was a dragon-monster, appearing just like a Dragon. A
\[Fig. 5\] <span id="fr_164"></span>[5303-1](#fn_164.md) is that very great
city, concerning which see p. 362 \[nos. 5273-5275\]. B is the rich city
Babylon, now treated of \[no. 5285\]. His the sea \[no. 5296\]; S, the
district subject to the rich city, where the rich ones dwell \[nos.
5283, 5285\]; T, the tract subject to the other city, the very great
one; M, the hells of the northern part, which became a swamp \[no.
5274\]; and N, the hells of the southern part, the inhabitants of which
were cast into the hells of the Gentiles. These we are now treating of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5304.">5304.</span></span>

The sphere which exhaled from those who dwelt in that rich, or wealthy,
city, was of such a nature as to take away the whole perception and
sensation of good and delight from others. I was in the delight of good
and truth, and, when brought to the neighborhood of that city, while it
was still flourishing, all that delight died away, until none of it
remained. The reason was, that they were in the sphere of the delight of
the love of the world and of self; and, in this case, all heavenly
delight is taken away from those who are not of such a character. So
powerful was their sphere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5305.">5305.</span></span>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE GREAT CITY BETWEEN THE WEST AND THE NORTH,
TREATED OF ON P. 361 \[no. 5269f\]. In the western district subject to
that city, or to the Pope, were very many monasteries, chiefly under the
mountain-land. The monks, there, went out to seek for souls and
subjugate them; which was done at night-time. Then, all in whom such a
purpose was discovered, were cast, part into the northern swamp, part
into the murky cavern, part into a certain gulf. This happened with
everyone in a moment, just as with the rest who were in the city.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5306.">5306.</span></span>

After this, an earthquake began in that district; and the rest were
terrified by it and rushed out. It was a vast number, all of whom were
cast into their hells. The reason was also told them, namely, because,
with exceeding assiduity, and in every way they can, they keep the
people in darkness, and so hinder their being instructed by the Lord
through angels. Thus they entirely take away from them all means of
salvation, which is, solely, knowing the truths of the Church and
afterwards appropriating them; and, if they be prevented from doing this
no means of saving them can be given. Moreover, also, those here
described hunt after souls who enter the other life, of whatever
religion they may be, partly by allurement, partly by force and
violence, partly by magical art, and partly by damnable persuasion; so
that they completely shut souls out of heaven, and bewitch them into a
merely external sanctity that appears before the eyes but is devoid of
all internal quality, and also inveigle them into idolatrous practices
in every manner - and all this solely with the aim that they may get
possession of all things in the world, and rule not only over the souls
of men but also over their bodies; and, thus, that they may be lords of
the whole earth, and all others their slaves. Therefore, also, they
prevent them from reading the Word, and have masses in a foreign
language, and set up images everywhere, and trumpet forth miracles; and
yet they perform no use at all but to themselves - eating, drinking,
raving and sinning, denying God and arrogating to themselves all the
power of the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5307.">5307.</span></span>

The speech of those who were there, was outwardly sincere, but they
themselves were inwardly devils. By their speech they were able to
mislead whomsoever of the simple-minded they would.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5308.">5308.</span></span>

CONCERNING OLD WOMEN WHO HAVE LIVED IN ALMSHOUSES; <span
id="fr_165"></span>[5308-1](#fn_165.md) AND CONCERNING BEGGARS. There were
some women, many of whom, to the number of fifty or a hundred, appeared,
in turn, at the angle between the north and west, and, from that
mountain, continually infested all whom they saw, wishing to lead
everyone, and thereby to possess them. They so infested me, frequently,
from a desire of entering, by this means, into the world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5309.">5309.</span></span>

They were expelled thence several times, and cast out therefrom; but yet
they always returned. At length, I was brought to their dwelling, which
was some distance off, in the land between the north and west. I was led
thither for the space of nearly two hours, and conducted about by
roundabout ways; for they contrived the paths in this way, lest anyone
should come to them. All the other paths they so sedulously contrived by
magical arts, that nobody could come to them save by many roundabout
ways. I was led through them, and finally to their residence. They were
women who have lived in almshouses, and performed no use in the world
except eating, drinking, sleeping, talking together, and going to their
Church and feigning outward sanctity. They had no wish to be instructed
in the doctrinals of the Church: they cared nothing for them. In a word,
they have given themselves up to idleness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5310.">5310.</span></span>

They dwelt in little cells, which were continuous on both sides to a
considerable distance. Every little cell had a door; and, when they
entered, they also closed up the entrance by an art of phantasy, in
order that, if anyone came there, he should not be able to enter; so
that they might be in security. They knew how to go to places round
about by means of thoughts, and appear there as if present; thus, to go,
as it were, out of the body; and, after they had infested others, they
returned in a moment, and were thus in safety. These were the delights
of their life. They dwelt at Z, and appeared at A \[see Fig. 5, p.
373\]. <span id="fr_166"></span>[5310-1](#fn_166.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5311.">5311.</span></span>

Then all who were there, except some who had not been of such a
character but have lived well, were cast into a certain gulf, which is
the fifth, on the other side of their dwellings. There, also, all of
them were cast, and the region thus freed from the infestations of such
ones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5312.">5312.</span></span>

It was said, that those in that gulf are compelled to think according to
the sight, or according to the objects of sight and of the external
senses, and not to wander therefrom at all; and when this happens, they
experience the greatest torment, because they are not able to go out of
the body through space by means of thoughts, and appear elsewhere: for
all such persons learn to go through space as to the thoughts, and to
appear at other places than where they are; in which places they appear
exactly as if really present thus in many places \[at once\]; and the
more adroitly they can do this, the safer they regard themselves. This
phantastic art prevails to a great extent amongst spirits, and is
exceedingly pernicious.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5313.">5313.</span></span>

Afterwards, I saw beggars, who were in other places. They appear in a
higher situation, and all as if continuous, or, as it were, glued
together, by reason of their acting as one. They were cast into a gulf,
remote from the preceding one, towards the north.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5314.">5314.</span></span>

THE SITUATION OF CHRISTIANS AND OTHERS. The middle is occupied by those
Christians who are called Lutherans, and Reformed; each sect according
to its genius. These are on the rocks. Surrounding these on every side,
are such as are of the Catholic religion. Next around are the
Mohammedans: the Gentiles, however, are around these, on the west; and
those who are good are transferred to the east, and stationed around
them \[i.e. the Mohammedans\] there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5315.">5315.</span></span>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING BABEL. In the western region is a vast number of
monasteries for men, but not above that region, with the exception of a
few which are for the purpose of observing how things are circumstanced
round about. They are beneath the earth; and there are many dwellings
there, and as it were small cities full of monasteries. The number of
monasteries exceeds the number in the world even to twenty-fold. Now a
monastery which, for instance, contained fifty, at present also contains
just as many. The rest, who have lived in previous centuries,
established for themselves similar monasteries round about there, but
under the mountain. The whole western region is full of such

<span class="margnote"><span id="5316.">5316.</span></span>

The western region which is subject to the very great city, is full of
similar monasteries, namely, such as have not been very wealthy. But
those who were rich and wealthy dwelt in the western part and as far as
to the southern; consequently, in the region subject to the rich city,
already mentioned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5317.">5317.</span></span>

The former multitude has accumulated since the time of the Reformation;
and the latter are they that dwell under the mountain. Those, however,
who lived in the Dark Ages, dwell below, where there is a vast region
allotted to them and their retainers. The dwellings, there, are arranged
in a circuit of wide extent in all directions, so that that region is
full of them - but, under those who lived after the times of the
Reformation. Such as are from the Dark Ages dwell beneath them, as was
said, in a wide region; for, when the latter arrived, the former let
themselves down thither. Except at a point in the middle, they are not
able to ascend to those who are above; but this happens rarely, inasmuch
as that middle place is closed up. The point A \[Fig. 7\] <span
id="fr_167"></span>[5317-1](#fn_167.md) there, appears as if heaped up, and
thus, closed. They search for ways to get out, but find none. Sometimes,
certain of their number put in an appearance; some appear like gods
because they wished to be so worshipped, and some like robbers. They
are, in the greatest darkness, and are not acquainted with anything
belonging to doctrine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5318.">5318.</span></span>

Almost similarly dwell the rich who lived in the Dark Ages, and those
who lived after them, under the western region. The latter are above and
the former beneath - but these are only the rich. If they appear above,
as sometimes happens, by means of thoughts, then they are in various
ways cast back by those who dwell above, so that, at length, they dare
not emerge; for those above fear lest they, rather than themselves,
should bear away the gains from the people.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5319.">5319.</span></span>

They also have light there, but it is dim. It is an illusory light that
they have. They are allowed to go and dwell round about, and also to let
themselves down still deeper, but not to rise up. When they go about,
they always turn their back to the Lord as the sun - never their face.
They are wholly idolatrous; they pay sacred worship to images and not to
the Lord, because they say they have got all His power themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5320.">5320.</span></span>

They also possess concealed treasures; and they place their heart in
them, believing that they can never come to want while they have these.
Owing to their phantastic faith, which is also persuasive, these
treasures remain there; and, as often as they come there, they see them.
They always say that they are destitute.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5321.">5321.</span></span>

There are some in the western region, who are in the boundary between
the rich and those who are not very rich. On the side belonging to the
rich, the inner places were laid open; and there appeared there both
higher and lower dwellings, which were seen clustered together there
because the inhabitants were all rich. Their destruction was close at
hand. Wherefore, being terrified, they rose up, descended, and carried
forth their gold, silver, diamonds and precious things, believing that
thus they would be safe. They ascended by winding, or spiral stairs; and
the stairs appeared crowded with men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5322.">5322.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF BABYLON. Babylon was the name of
those two regions, subject to the two cities, that are in the two angles
- to wit, the western region at about the middle, or by the chasm, of
which also mention has been made above; and the western region, also
near the middle, which is subject to the rich city - these two regions
were properly named Babylon, because riches abounded there, and those
who were there placed their heart on those things only. The other two
regions - to wit, from the middle of the western region as far as to the
farthest boundary of the northern - which were subject to the very great
city, were also Babylon, but not so properly as the two former ones,
inasmuch as in these two there was not so much wealth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5323.">5323.</span></span>

After the confine between the southern and western quarters was
destroyed (concerning which destruction somewhat was stated just above
\[no. 5321\]), a total vastation began to come upon that great tract
which is Babylon; wherein, as above said, dwelt a great multitude, one
stratum above another - to wit, those who lived before the time of the
Reformation beneath, and those who lived afterwards, above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5324.">5324.</span></span>

The vastation commenced by an east wind, which was sent in the first
place through the southern tract, and proceeded to the western as far as
the boundary that is in the middle of the western tract; and it carried
away the mountain above, which covered \[that region\], to such an
extent that, first, the under-side of the mountain appeared uncovered,
and then was exhibited what was the character of that subterranean
region, that, namely, it was full of palaces and monasteries. Round
about the chasm above mentioned, appeared nothing but a certain gloom;
afterwards, in that southern tract, the rich who were outside the
monasteries, in so great number that it was as if that whole tract was
built beneath; and then the region as far as the western confine, and
from that spot to the middle boundary in the west, where were
magnificent monasteries in immense number.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5325.">5325.</span></span>

Next, all the heaps between the palaces and monasteries were carried
away by east and west winds, which proceeded, in order, one after
another, until that stratum was laid bare as far as the foundations, and
even to their treasures, which were under the monasteries.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5326.">5326.</span></span>

This being done, the rich, who occupied the forward tract, were cast
down thence into the hells of the Gentiles, previously described \[no.
5265\], at the west, around the Mohammedans; and the monks and priors,
and all the prelates, when they saw that all things were laid bare,
rushed forth from their monasteries, and were brought to the western
sea, at its northern parts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5327.">5327.</span></span>

Those of the rich who were at the front, had done nothing else than eat,
drink, and amuse themselves, consequently, give themselves up to
enjoyment, not even thinking about any God. They had a worship, but it
was destitute of any \[genuine\] worship - a mere matter of habit. In a
word, they had done nothing at all else than live for enjoyment. All
their utensils were of gold and silver, and of precious stones besides.
These are they who were cast into the hells of the Gentiles. They have
lived in luxury.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5328.">5328.</span></span>

After this was accomplished, then all the palaces and all the
monasteries were turned into smoke, which smoke proceeded to the western
sea; also, all the hidden riches, which all vanished into smoke and were
cast into the sea.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5329.">5329.</span></span>

After this was accomplished, then a stronger east wind arose and carried
away another mountain-roof in each tract; and this passed on to the two
other tracts, as far as the angle between the north and east, where it
stopped. That wind seemed to pass over the whole, going, and returning,
and continuing, till all things were completely laid bare, consequently,
those two strata; and, these being exposed, there appeared, everywhere,
nothing but monasteries, with a kind of rabble round about for slaves.
The monks lived there like gods; and the rabble worshipped them as their
gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5330.">5330.</span></span>

So deplorable was the darkness in another stratum, that they proclaimed
themselves gods, and said that the Lord has no power, and that they have
all, and have transferred all power from the Lord to themselves -
knowing, all the while, that it was not granted to them, since it was
only to Peter; and, when others inquired what heaven is, they then led
them to their treasures and gave them something of trifling value, and
brought them to their table and treated them to delicacies, saying that
this was heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5331.">5331.</span></span>

All of these - and their number was immense - were brought down to the
northern shore of the western sea, and cast into the sea; and all the
monasteries fell into dust; and \[everything that was in them\] vanished
into smoke, and was carried down into that sea.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5332.">5332.</span></span>

Afterwards, I saw a certain atmosphere fall down from heaven, which
completely devastated all those tracts so that they became a desert.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5333.">5333.</span></span>

Subsequently came merchants, of whom a great number were accustomed to
come to the southern quarter in particular; and they sought the rich who
had dwelt there, but did not find anything at all. Therefore they went
away sad. Certain ones flocked thither to drag out the gold and silver
from the bottom; but they sought for it in vain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5334.">5334.</span></span>

After this, there exhaled from that place a smoke as it were of sulfur,
which proceeded to the western sea.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5335.">5335.</span></span>

It was also observed, that some who dwelt nearer to the city of the
rich, in the southern tract, had, as it were, a millstone around the
left shoulder, the shoulder being inserted in the middle of it. This was
a representative that they had confirmed their execrable dogmas from the
Word. A millstone is such a doctrinal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5336.">5336.</span></span>

Thus was Babylon devastated and utterly destroyed on three sides, the
southern, the western, and the northern. This commenced at the end of
the year 1756 and the beginning of the year 1757. Yesterday and today
those three tracts \[were fully destroyed\]. Today is the 6th day of
January, 1757.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5337.">5337.</span></span>

CONCERNING BABYLON ON THE EASTERN QUARTER. There were also very many of
the same religion in the east, where mountains appear; and in that
region also there are monasteries, and common people in subjection; but
those were there who have been pious and upright, who have engaged
devoutly in holy exercises, and have been devoted to many uses. They
were taken out from those mentioned above, and transferred towards the
east, to the mountains there, where they kept up their religion. They
said that, from that part, they had influx into those who were in the
southern and the western tracts; but that they were able to do nothing
with them, inasmuch as all piety and devotion was changed into such
luxuriousness and corporeality, as characterized them, and that they
labored with them in vain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5338.">5338.</span></span>

Those who dwelt in the angle between the south and east, in monasteries,
were cast out of them, and passed through along the middle of the
southern plain as far as the west; and those who were near them more to
the east, crossed the northern plain along the middle and passed as far
as the western tract, which was laid waste, and thence proceeded to the
angle between the west and north, following an angular, or diagonal,
line, as far as those who had lived in almshouses, mentioned above,
\[nos. 5308-12\] and still farther to the remotest distance; and thence
they repaired towards the western quarter, at the other side of the
destroyed tract, and there were allotted their residence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5339.">5339.</span></span>

It was perceived that there was still with them something of hypocrisy;
for they affected the left side of my head with a dull pain. The reason
that they were of such a character, was that they have, indeed, been in
outward sanctity, and also, more than others, in inner sanctity, but yet
they have been in the desire of ruling over others; and, being led by
\[this\] blind love, as their devotion was so far hypocritical; and, as
they were in darkness as regards Divine things, only worshipping saints
more devoutly than others did, therefore, they were removed so far off;
and there was then given them another locality in the west to dwell in.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5340.">5340.</span></span>

After these were driven out, then were those driven out who were in the
eastern quarter, in the middle, and on both sides of the middle; and
they were led around, somewhat towards the corner, or diagonal line,
between the east and north, and removed as far as possible; and then
they were dispersed into the northern plain, beyond that tract which had
been destroyed and made a desert, or waste. The multitude of them was
vast, and occupied a great space around that tract, nearly as far as the
angular line between the north and west. It was a vast multitude. They
were the ones who made to themselves a sun by means of phantasy, and
placed therein a certain one whom they called Christ - of which ones I
have already treated. Such as were there were in darkness, and believed
that they were led by the Lord, but that the Lord does nothing save
through them - besides other notions that pertain to darkness; for those
who were in the east are of such a quality. Those there who are towards
the south, are more in natural lumen. In a word, they are, for the most
part, as it were foolish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5341.">5341.</span></span>

Lastly, the visitation came upon the angle between the north and east;
and, on both sides thereof, in a long stretch into the region there,
were monasteries for virgins and women, of which there was an immense
number, in triplicate strata, below and above. All those who were in the
monasteries were brought out; and such of them as led an evil life,
especially by adulteries and harlotry, and such as became profane
through an evil life at variance with their religious principles - these
were brought forth to the front, to the boundary of the angle; and, on
both sides thereof, at the north and east, extending over some space,
was made a great and deep chasm, into which all such ones were cast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5342.">5342.</span></span>

The remainder, who passed a life in accordance with their religious
principles, and at the same time were engaged in some work, and were not
idle, were brought out thence towards the east, somewhat distant from
the boundary, so that they might settle there, and form a society
without monasteries. But only a few stayed; they \[i.e. the bulk of
them\] returned, longing for the monasteries. Those who have lived in
idleness, caring for nothing else than outward piety, were shared
amongst the followers of their religion, so that they might there act as
attendants to them, and learn to work; for the heavenly life does not
consist in idleness, and in piety without work, but in piety with work.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5343.">5343.</span></span>

The rest - also women - who were diligent in serving others there, in
various modes, in reference to food, clothing, and the rest of the
employments there, and who did so out of affection and religion - these
were brought away outside of the region of the Church, so that they
should form a society there, in a place protected from infestations from
men, in order that they might there learn the truths of faith; for such
ones learn - not, however, those who have been idle. That society was
formed in the confine between the south and west at a remote distance,
in a region where they are safe; and, to them, in that place, are sent
those who teach.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5344.">5344.</span></span>

Afterwards came many travelers, merchants of various nations, and monks
who were travelling and absent while these things were happening; and,
when they saw all things there waste and deserted, they lamented
exceedingly. This continued for days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5345.">5345.</span></span>

Those who are in the sea, and those who are in the gulfs, dare not raise
their heads out of them. As soon as they do so, they are cruelly
tormented; for round about there prevails an altogether different
sphere, which is opposed to theirs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5346.">5346.</span></span>

Those in the west are those who have been in an extreme love of self and
had rule as their end; in the east are such as were in the delight of
the love of ruling; in the north, those who are in an obscure light
respecting everything; and in the south, such as have excelled in
genius.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5347.">5347.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT OF THOSE WHO ARE CALLED PROTESTANTS, AS,
FOR EXAMPLE, LUTHERANS, THE REFORMED, AND OTHERS. Those who were of the
Lutheran, Calvinistic, and the other religions in the Christian world,
with the exception of the papists, were in the middle; but below, upon a
hill, and somewhat round about, were those who were of a genuine faith,
and at the same time in the good of life. Above them, on an extensive
mountain and in a mountain region round about, were such as have been
external men and have not had any internal, who have known the Word and
doctrinals, and have frequented churches, but still have cared nothing
at all about their life; in a word, have been in externals alone and
loved themselves and the world above all things. These were on that
mountain, and in the middle; also in the mountain-region round about,
where there were various cities and a vast multitude. All of them were
brought down below the mountain-region as far as the boundary where the
Catholic religion is, and were there brought into a steep, or sloping,
chasm - dark, wide and large. Those who were in the southern part of
that mountain and mountain-region, were brought down into that wide and
dark chasm which is at the northern boundary; in like manner those who
were in the eastern quarter there - all in their order: those who were
in the eastern quarter into that chasm which is at the southern part
nearer towards the east; those who were in the southern, in their order,
towards the west thereof; but those who were in the western quarter of
the mountain, were brought \[into\] a mighty, steep, dark, yawning
chasm, at the boundary of the western tract, and there cast deep down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5348.">5348.</span></span>

First those of the southern quarter, afterwards those of the western,
and lastly those of the eastern, were brought down there. This happened
at the same time that the Papists of the eastern quarter were brought
down beyond the northern tract - of whom above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5349.">5349.</span></span>

Those who were brought into those chasms at the boundaries, were such as
have led an evil life and have thought very wickedly of God and religion
- in a word, the evil.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5350.">5350.</span></span>

When this was done, their dwellings were laid waste and dispersed. They
were mostly of those that were outside the cities.
