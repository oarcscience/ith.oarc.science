### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="3801.">3801.</span></span>

Suddenly a certain one appeared before me at a little distance, clad in
a beautiful snow-white inner garment, of a human aspect, with uncovered
head, the locks appearing as with men whose heads are naked. An obscure
cloud immediately appeared beneath him, into which he plunged and
disappeared. While I was wondering who he might be, and why he became
thus immersed in the cloud, his head was shortly afterwards obscurely
seen emerging a little, and he seemed to have a flask of red or dark
colored wine, which he drank off and disappeared.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3802.">3802.</span></span>

It was said he was one who could overcome all, and who could be himself
overcome by no one. He was then obscurely seen as being among his own in
the deep, and those that were there wondered to what it was owing that
he could effect nothing, when they had the persuasion concerning him, as
he had of himself that he could do all things, and thus perhaps that he
was omnipotent. I heard also that he named the Lord, thinking that he
proceeded from him, thus that he was the Holy Spirit proceeding from the
Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3803.">3803.</span></span>

It was afterwards said to me, both by himself and, as I think, by others
also, that such an one supposed himself holy-born, and thus without
blemish from his mother's womb, because born such in the world, though
in fact \[begotten\] by their spirit in vile adultery. As he supposed
himself conceived, so also that he was born of the Holy Spirit, but with
the aid of a man, and thus that he was from eternity - because born of
the Holy Spirit. From him it was said that others held that they might
perpetrate such nefarious adulteries and abominations. There was also
seen near me a face which was similar \[to that of\] a base and
detestable man; concerning whom it was said that he alone, or those like
him, might drink such dark red wine in heaven, because he thought the
wine to be celestial. This is perhaps their sacred supper - that such
should drink either on earth or in the other life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3804.">3804.</span></span>

But that flask was made to envelope him round about, just as is usual in
the other life, so that he received as it were, a new shell, with which
shell, corporeal as it was, being clothed, he retired to a distance in
front, and then being divested of the shell he emerged as a small
snow-white something, resembling a man, and thereupon betaking himself
nearer to me, but higher, he thence spoke with me, as before, \[saying\]
among other things, that he had thus put off the old man, and put on the
new, but saying, as before, that he was not thus among exterior spirits.
This took place from his phantasy that he should have presented himself
as such, thinking that he had in this laid off another body which he had
with him, and thus emerged a new man, and so that he was the Holy Spirit
from eternity, perhaps also that it was that which he supposed he had
derived from the Holy Spirit, and that that corporeal was laid aside
which was from the father.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3805.">3805.</span></span>

They are especially such that are the fruit of such a connection, who
boast themselves as being holy above others, and holy-born, and of such
a quality are they who prompt such connections, and who are with the
Quakers when they cohabit in that detestable abomination with the women;
for they are pre-eminently lascivious, and I perceived that they are in
the persuasion of such adultery above others, thus that they act from
the persuasion, which was felt by me; he also, from that persuasion,
prompted my pectoral respiration.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3806.">3806.</span></span>

But the issue in regard to him was shown, when from being small and
snow-white, thus the Holy Spirit above others, he became black and
indurated, like a mummy, so that, \[in fact\] he scarcely differed from
a mummy; being thus turned from snowy into black, or from holy to
eminently profane; for such, because they are such, are turned into the
contrary.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3807.">3807.</span></span>

Being afterwards made to revolve \[or to be rolled\] around an axis or
staff transversely placed, \[he was, as it were, flattened or thinned
out\] to a kind of lamina \[or plate\], and continuing to be thus rolled
he became a lamina more and more extended, and at the same time obscure
and dense, till finally its length precluded its being any further
rolled upon the same cylinder, for \[however much of it was rolled\]
till just so much always remained; which was the punishment for saying
that they were from eternity, viz., this being turned into something
without end, thus \[denoting\] a perpetual natural.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3808.">3808.</span></span>

Afterward when rolled towards my head there appeared in this long lamina
a snake or serpent within the lamina, corresponding to it in size, which
snake or serpent was erect, so that its tail was upwards, and its head
in my hair. There was then suggested something respecting the serpent,
which from the tree of knowledge deceived Eve.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3809.">3809.</span></span>

Others who were in the deep, by their aspiration \[upon me\] affected
the region of the left ear, then the left part of the head, and also
penetrated by their afflatus, so that they infused a kind of pain into
that region, which signifies their insane scientifics, that inspire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3810.">3810.</span></span>

When I awoke in the night I suddenly felt among the hair upon my head a
multitude of very small snakes or serpents, and it was perceived that
such had been plotting against me in the night, but in vain; it was only
by the phantasies that they were among the hairs of my head, where I
felt them. Thus I perceived that those who had conspired were very
numerous; it was heard also that they had called a great multitude
together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3811.">3811.</span></span>

The issue with such as boast with persuasion of being born without
blemish, and thus of being the Holy Spirit, when still they are, as
compared with others, horribly and abominably adulterous, inasmuch as
the bond of conscience is altogether loosed \[with them\], is, that they
became the foulest excretions, for such an issue awaits those to whom
the bond of conscience is especially relaxed in such things; and it was
perceived that when this is the case one cannot fail to be dissolved
into such things, according to the different degrees of relaxation, some
into the foul mucus of the nostrils. But this is the first result, as
they are afterwards separated from external associates, and sit at first
in torment, like the barks \[of trees\], dregs of oil, and such things,
and when severed from companions, they are horrid images of death, only
there is a certain society of interior life, of which \[however\] they
are ignorant; for if they should be withdrawn from all interior
consociation, they would be deprived of all life. When they have thus
sat for a long time, perhaps for many ages, then their externals become
dead, and, as it were, indurated, and they then can be formed \[or
molded\] into something, and come into connection with external
societies, but \[they act\] very little from themselves: and so with
those who are in persuasion like such, and with whom the bond of
conscience is entirely loosed, there is scarcely anything of their own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3812.">3812.</span></span>

I perceived that those of this quality who retain so little of their
own, can indeed belong to societies, but they are scarcely aware of the
fact; they are, as it were, subjects, and as to their propria inanimate,
and serving in societies for bonds of connection, or as mere insertions
in respect to such bonds, answering the same purpose as certain words in
discourse, which merely perform the office of connectives, without
contributing anything of account to the subject-matter, because there is
nothing essential in them. Whether they can also serve for subjects
through which others speak, without knowing whether it is themselves or
the others \[that really speak\], as is the case with some subjects, I
do not yet know; but so it appears, for of themselves they know almost
nothing. - 1748, November 1, 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3813.">3813.</span></span>

There appeared to me two days before, unless I mistake, a vessel in
which there was milk, butter, and a certain something representing
cheese or bread. What was signified by them I am yet ignorant; whether
it was something pertaining to infants when they are born, \[to be in
some way used\] in the place of baptism, or have otherwise some
reference to their infants, I do not know.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3814.">3814.</span></span>

A certain person spoke with me from a higher place in front, of whom it
was said that it was Penn, from whom Pennsylvania derives its name. He
spoke well, and because he perceived their quality, he strongly affirmed
that he was not such, and that it was abominable \[that any should be,
such\], and that for himself he would disclaim all part in it; saying
and asseverating many other things which I do not recollect.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3815.">3815.</span></span>

Certain Quakers spoke concerning those who at first became Quakers in
such abundance, \[saying\] that their spirits could not then have been
Quakers, thus that they were of another character; but it was answered
that almost all the spirits of the world of spirits were such as were
bent upon possessing, yea, obsessing, man, and I know that everyone of
them wishes to be called the Holy Spirit, provided only that there are
subjects who may acknowledge and worship them. Those who then possessed
them were from the world of spirits in general; they were also wrought
upon by mere enthusiastic influences, which happens moreover in respect
to all kinds of enthusiasts. But afterwards Quaker spirits succeeded,
when the Quaker sect began, for they are closely congruous to their
nature, nor do they admit others into society \[with them\], for their
nature is distinct from the nature of others. - 1748, November 1, 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3816.">3816.</span></span>

CONCERNING A CERTAIN ONE WHO ASPIRED TO SUPERIOR GREATNESS. A certain
spirit said to me "I am nothing," of whom it was asked whether it were
not well that everyone should be such as he is, or whether one should
desire to be greater than he is, for everyone is a mere diminutive
particle among myriads of myriads of myriads; such he is; and yet he
wishes to be greater, while at the same time if in the truth of faith,
he cannot be greater than he is, which is to be almost nothing at all,
and so on. When one wishes to be greater than he is, what then? - 1748,
November 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3817.">3817.</span></span>

CONCERNING SPHERES. In what manner spheres correspond and are effected
was made apparent when I walked about a stable of horses and smelt their
ordure, of which upright spirits immediately complained, \[saying\] that
they could not endure that smell, because the sphere of reasonings from
naturals forthwith occurred, and thus was felt the sphere to which it
corresponded. Thus it appears in regard to other things how it sometimes
is with the objects of smell and the other senses, as also with the
objects of various thoughts, as also phantasies, which form spheres, to
which correspond spiritual and celestial things, and thence their
spheres, that affect according to the quality of spirits, for spheres
are, as it were, the atmospheres of spirits in which they live. - 1748,
November 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3818.">3818.</span></span>

WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN BEASTS AND MAN. Whatever beasts do is
natural, because their ends terminate in natural things. It appears,
indeed, as if beasts derived it from a spiritual and celestial
\[source\] that, from the prompting of conjugial love, as \[for instance
in the case\] of doves and other birds which go in pairs, they should
thus associate themselves in pairs; so also in regard to their young,
whether chicks or whelps; then again as to their love towards their
mates, with which they live in harmony, and are conjoined, as is the
case with many animals, and especially birds, as also serpents, and
insects, for instance bees; thus they exhibit friendship towards each
other, besides other things \[by which they are distinguished\] in their
societies and economies, all which appear at first blush as if they were
spiritual and celestial, but \[still\] they are not so, because they
regard only worldly and terrestrial ends. From ends \[alone\] can it
appear whether anything is spiritual and celestial. It is one thing to
be prompted by an end spiritual and celestial, and another to receive
such ends, and regard them; \[for\] unless the recipient be as the
agent, then there is not given in the recipient any such thing as that
which pertains to the agent.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3819.">3819.</span></span>

Beasts also have no skill in arts or sciences, as the mechanical,
physical, philosophical, and others; still they are in them, and indeed,
like the body of man, in their most hidden arcana, and from nature they
know many more things than man by all his arts and sciences, as for
instance they know how to construct nests, as the birds; to form webs,
as the spider; to enwrap themselves in little silken houses, as the
silk-worm; to form beautiful cells and adjust them, as bees; besides
other things. These things are scientifics which beasts know; man by his
sciences does not reach so far. Wherefore sciences and things of art are
such things as man has in common with the beasts, on which account they
alike regard the natural life, for ends are terminated in nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3820.">3820.</span></span>

But it is the prerogative of man over the beasts to be able to think and
to have respect to the things which are superior or interior, namely,
spiritual and celestial things, which beasts cannot do, and thus have
for an end the societies of the other life. If the ends of man did not
regard the things which are of a spiritual and celestial life, that is,
spiritual and celestial things, or spiritual and celestial good and
truth, he would then be unable to have any other life than that which
beasts have; for ends show what and of what quality the life is. Thus
spiritual and celestial things are the appropriate things of human life,
so that \[men\] may be recipient of them. Wherefore those who come into
the other life wholly uninstructed concerning spiritual and celestial
things, are like sticks of wood, and scarce anything of life appears in
them, prior to their being instructed or initiated in the knowledges of
faith. Hence now it appears what is the quality of the life of those who
regard no other than corporeal, worldly, and terrestrial things.
Wherefore unless the Lord should have compassion, and grant them the
faculty of understanding, they would be dissipated like the brutes. -
1748, November 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3821.">3821.</span></span>

THAT EVIL SPIRITS ARE CONTINUALLY IN THE EFFORT OF EVIL. It was often
observed that when I was in the streets, \[evil spirits\] wished to cast
me under the wheels of a carriage, so that this was in fact familiar to
them. Today I particularly observed that they were in such a perpetual
endeavor, for it was given to perceive it when they thus made the
attempt, and indeed that the sphere of their endeavor is continually
such that it is their life; and I perceived that man is continually
preserved by the Lord, and their endeavors frustrated. Hence it appears
that unless the Lord in every, even the smallest moment, preserved man,
yea, even the least of his steps, he would immediately perish; such is
the effort of the world of spirits. - 1748, November 2.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3822.">3822.</span></span>

CONCERNING SPIRITS WHO SPEAK DISSIMILARILY, BUT THINK ALIKE. \[Certain\]
spirits came in front, a profane sphere being sent before them, which
led me to think that profane spirits were approaching. But they were the
opposites or enemies of such, who placed themselves above my head,
because they were enemies; it was thence ascertained that they would
breathe annoyance against them, and prompt other forms of enmities
towards them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3823.">3823.</span></span>

The spirits who came in front accosted me, saying that they were men;
when I said to them that they were not men, as the term is understood,
i. e. men possessed of a body, but (that they were spirits, and thus
also were men, because whatever there is in a spirit conspires to that
which is of man, and so finally to a form similar to the \[human\] body;
to this I apperceived no denial, but \[on the contrary\] they confirmed
it. They said moreover that men are dissimilar, or that there was no
society in which one was \[wholly\] like another; and as this seemed to
me impossible, viz. that there should be a society of dissimilars, I
spoke with them concerning it, \[saying\] that they might still be
consociated by the Lord to one end, which might act as a kind of common
\[general\] cause to bring them together into a certain unity. But they
said they were such that everyone speaks differently \[from the rest\],
and yet they still think alike.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3834.">3834.</span></span>

This was also illustrated by the example of one's saying that he who is
nothing is least in heaven, while another said that he was greatest, and
yet that each was true, and so on. Then again by its being said by some
concerning the evil spirits who were above the head, that they were
evil; by others that they were good and by others still that they were
intermediate, with wide difference; that the evil perceive that they are
evil; that the good perceive that they are useful; that the
intermediates \[exist\] with much variety, some of them being worse than
others, and others the instruments of greater utility; and thus in
regard to other things, so that all perception is one, but the
expressions of speech so differ that they appear to be altogether
dissimilar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3835.">3835.</span></span>

Evil spirits do not tolerate those \[above spoken of\] because they
cannot apply anything to themselves. They understand their interiors,
for which reason the evil spirits complained of them, especially when
they said that they \[the evil spirits\] were good, because they
understand that they may perform a use even to the good, \[whether\] by
averting evil, by chastising the insolent, or by tempting. Neither do
they tolerate that they should be said to be evil, and on this account
they are exceedingly hostile to them. They applied themselves to my left
ear and said that they were good spirits, and that it was their custom
to speak in this manner. It was said concerning them that they
\[usually\] come congregated in this manner together, though they know
not whence; and I perceive that evil spirits are infested by them, and
the evils spirits on the other hand infest them also in a variety of
ways, because they cannot bear anything of this kind. The sphere of evil
spirits I perceived to be extremely repugnant to them, and because they
thus act against the evil, they cannot but have them as it were for
companions, for the evil are subjects which they vex in this way, but
there is still perpetual enmity; wherefore the evil serve them for
objects of vexation. Their society, which is a wandering one, was
represented by a man or a woman in a chamber in front \[clad\] in a
vestment, which, being changed into a gown of a sky-blue color, \[the
representation\] became a gross kind of man. <span
id="fr_61"></span>[3835-1](#fn_61.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="3836.">3836.</span></span>

Thence it appears how the same and a similar idea, while it goes forth
into speech or into externals, begets dissimilar ideas of speech; so
that though there be but one idea flowing into many societies, even good
ones, yet many ideas of speech thence result, so that the variety
proceeding from one idea is actually indefinite, what happens in many
societies being presented in this one, from which a conclusion may be
drawn to associated societies, and even to the universal heaven and the
world of spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3837.">3837.</span></span>

It was perceived that such represent the isthmus in the brain which is
situated between the cerebrum and the cerebellum, from which and through
which the fibers are diffused, and whithersoever they extend, they act
diversely in the extremes, but yet in their \[first\] principle they act
in the same or a similar way; and also that they represent the ganglia
into which a \[single\] nerve flows, and out of which issues a multitude
that part asunder and spread, some this way and some that, and which act
indeed dissimilarly in their ultimates, but because issuing from one
ganglion, they act from one principle, and thus while in ultimates they
act dissimilarly according to appearance, yet in themselves they act
alike as to end, which is one; and so in many other things. - 1748,
November 2, 3.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3838.">3838.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE HOLY SPIRIT. There was with me a subtle spirit who was a
subject of those deceitful ones above the head, who found in him a
subject that believed himself to be actuated by the Holy Spirit, and
indeed that he is the Holy Spirit; for those who in their life, like the
Quakers, suppose themselves to be actuated by the Holy Spirit are easily
led in the other life, to fancy themselves to be the Holy Spirit,
because while in the life of the body they were persuaded that he was in
them, and such especially are adapted to be the subjects of those who
wish to be worshipped for the Holy Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3839.">3839.</span></span>

It was discovered, as to this spirit, that he was void of conscience;
and that he was an adulterer - for he held adulteries for nothing - was
discovered from various things which were insinuated for instance by his
insinuating adulteries, by his loosing every bond, by his delight in
variety - all without conscience. Whether he were in the conjugial
principle or not, whether he were a married man or a married woman, this
I perceived with sufficient distinctness from the things which were
inspired; and he inspired a certain other one \[prompting him\] to
disregard spiritual things, or confirmatory natural things, which he
totally despised and nauseated as vile and worthless.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3840.">3840.</span></span>

He was then suddenly inspected by angelic spirits, who have an exquisite
perception of the presence of such spirits, for they pervert the vessels
or ideas, so that they cannot flow in. Being thus inspected he was
suddenly extended into a long band \[or wrapper\] a little before the
eyes, and being rolled up was thus left, that they might wait to see
what he would do. He attempted to unroll himself and twisted the bandage
in every variety of way (:according to interior phantasies, which it was
not given to perceive, but only to infer from what he was seen to do
with the bandage:). Presently he rolled himself up in the extreme part
of the bandage \[and passed\] through the exteriors of the left eye into
the brain, and thence back almost to the \[point of\] conjunction of the
optic nerve; thence from the eye he was cast among the hairs of the
head, which signified that because he was the Holy Spirit, he wished to
possess everything spiritual and natural, thus to know all things as is
conceived respecting the Holy Spirit. Presently afterwards the bandage
or long veil like a bandage, disappeared, and made itself obscurely
seen, from his supposing and endeavoring to show that he was the Holy
Spirit, because thus scarcely visible, and that too before the left eye
where yet his obscure presence was amply perceived; in this manner
inducing the supposition that he was the Holy Spirit. He afterwards
presented to view an obscurely luminous something, as the light of the
Holy Spirit, respecting which they are accustomed to say much in their
preaching, \[and\] by which they merely understand an obscurely ominous
something, but not \[true\] intellectual light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3841.">3841.</span></span>

It was afterwards shown by a certain kind of speech with them and
others, that they were those above the head - the deceitful among the
more deceitful - who think themselves to be the Holy Spirit and who,
having obtained this one as a subject, actuated him and wished by him to
make it appear that they were the Holy Spirit. Hence the quality of
those who, in the other life, vaunt themselves of being the Holy Spirit,
may be known. - 1748, November 3.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3842.">3842.</span></span>

HOW INTERIOR EVIL SPIRITS FLOW IN. The deceitful \[spirits\] who are
above the head have flowed in for a considerable time and in some cases
with so much subtlety that I knew not that it proceeded from them. For
some time past a mere manifest reflection has been given me, and today a
clearer still, so that I could observe how they flow into the subtle
thought of man, which influx is such that man could never perceive the
source of it. From close observation granted me by the Lord, I perceived
this so manifestly as to notice each one of their common influxes, and
if that close observation had not been granted, I should by no means
have perceived whence the \[influx flowed\], still less that it was from
those above the head, but \[could have taken it to be\] in myself and
from myself, as other men think and even believe. But that it is from
spirits I am now able to know more distinctly than ever before. When
they apperceived that I was reflecting upon their influx they became
highly indignant and wished, as they said, to withdraw, but they knew
not whither.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3843.">3843.</span></span>

The things that flowed from them were contrary to the Lord and contrary
to whatever is of faith. They were exceedingly complaisant to every
cupidity that was given, and when they could hold men in any evil
cupidity, they were then in their life and delight, as was also said to
them. In such cases they suppose themselves to live as the man, for they
then appropriate his life as their own, because in a similar life,
consequently in society with the man. But where there is a repugnance,
as with one who does not suffer himself to be perverted by them, but
remains in faith, with him they cannot live, for he is not in the stream
of their life. They especially inspire adulteries and hatreds, and labor
with the greatest zeal to abolish every bond of conscience, as their
intense exertions with me testify; thus they are adulterers of the
highest grade, and void of conscience, and yet they are those who
pre-eminently boast themselves of being the Holy Spirit, of whom the
more deceitful are yet higher above the head. Such hold their place
above the head, and are distinguished according to altitude, because
they are of a lofty mind, supposing themselves to be the Holy Spirit,
and thus that they rule men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3844.">3844.</span></span>

These flow into inferior subjects, which are with man, and the subjects
know no otherwise than that they are themselves the man, but they who
are above the head flow into them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3845.">3845.</span></span>

They are ruled by the Lord through heaven, but not by interior influx,
because they have no conscience, and are wholly contrary to faith, but
by external bonds; for they were such in life as were fearful for their
lives, for the loss of honor and fame, which are bonds, and things of
this kind by which they are ruled. They are thus bent to such things as
the Lord grants and permits, so that there shall be nothing which comes
from them, that is not of pardon, if not evil, and of permission, if
evil; for they are borne to a certain good also through externals, but
not through their internals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3846.">3846.</span></span>

The angels, on the other hand, who are at the head, are ruled
immediately by the Lord and also through heaven, and indeed from
internals; nor have they any communication with those \[others\] above
the head, only they rule their subjects. - 1748, November 3.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3847.">3847.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE BONDS OF CONSCIENCE. Because the deceitful, who are above
the head, are void of conscience, the bond of conscience being so
entirely loosed with them they do not know what conscience is, therefore
they wished to induce upon me the persuasion that that which was
indifferent ought to be a matter of conscience. Thus whatever occurred
they would infuse a conscientiousness concerning it, without
discrimination, so also with those who had conscience whether true or
spurious, they would suggest that to do this or that was a matter of
conscience, as with me, that I should eat or buy in a certain place,
because the persons there were upright, and so on. Thence arise spurious
consciences, causing the possessors to be tormented with remorse by
doing this or that in which there is no sin. It was given to say to them
that they would be goaded by conscience if they could not perpetrate
evil, for the devil is of such a quality that he is led on by a kind of
conscience, inasmuch as he is affected by anxiety that he is not
\[always\] able to think, speak, or do evil, as is also the case with
some men.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3848.">3848.</span></span>

It was perceived - what is manifest in itself - that the bond of
conscience availed according to the dignity and eminence of good and
truth, so that the principal bond of conscience is that which respects
the Lord, and thus the things that proceed from Him, as conjugial love,
which ought to be held the most sacred of all loves; after this, love
for children, and then farther, loves according to their consanguinities
and affinities; wherefore the bonds of conscience open altogether as
loves. - 1748, November 3.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3849.">3849.</span></span>

THAT NATURES ARE INDUCED THROUGH EXTERNALS. From those above the head,
who would fain have opposed my writing this, I was instructed that by
means of external bonds man contracts a nature, so that he should appear
good, as for example through fear for his life, his honor, his fame, his
gain, and other things which he loves; and that these fears, which are
external bonds, induce such a nature, that they not only consult their
interest, and work secretly for it, but also that they appear as it
were, upright, when yet they are wolves at heart, like those that are
above the head. Hence it appears what punishments are in the other life,
which at length induce a kind of nature, that one should be able to be
restrained from evils. The spirit then is not wholly ignorant of
external bonds, but they are so abhorred that in the least things it is
led away by its evils, for they have, as it were, infected the nature.

With angelical spirits there are bonds of conscience, which conscience
is from the Lord.
