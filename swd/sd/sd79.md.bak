### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="5401.">5401.</span></span>

At the boundary in the west, there appeared women who infested
whomsoever they saw; and it was perceived, that, when they returned to
their residences, they made their way through many roundabout paths and
blocked up the rest, lest they should be tracked after they have been
infesting, and punished. I was brought to this boundary; and, behold,
there was a vast multitude of women who in the world have been harlots,
numbering many hundreds of thousands. All these were then cast thence
into a marshy pond, which is some distance off at the back of those in
the west, and into hells there; and their houses were destroyed. They
had been such as continued in those courses during the whole of their
life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5402.">5402.</span></span>

Afterwards, others were seen who, unknown to their associates, have
secretly practiced whoredom - who, also, have been such to the end of
life in the world. These were seen at no great distance from the former
ones, to the number of many thousands and myriads. They, in like manner,
were led down to the pond on the western side in that region, and cast
into a gloomy, yawning cavern there situated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5403.">5403.</span></span>

There is also a marshy pond in the southern region, into which are cast
those who have been harlots clandestinely. Very many of those there are
of noble condition (St.). Into this \[also\] are cast those who have
been external men, all of whom thought and spoke like men in the world,
and, for the most part, in such language as there is in the world. Such
ones are numerous; and they are in a natural sphere, not in a spiritual,
for the reason that they have not known the truths of faith. Those who
are of such a character, and the harlots, are cast into the southern
pond; the rest, also, who are such, are in the south.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5404.">5404.</span></span>

Those in heaven marveled that few who come into the other life from the
Christian world, know that the Lord rules heaven and earth, when,
nevertheless, they may know this from \[the statements of\] the Word
that all things of the Father's are His; also, that all power in the
heavens and the earths is given to Him, and that He shall judge all men.
Few, also, think any otherwise about the Lord than as they do about a
common man, or as about themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5405.">5405.</span></span>

ABOUT THE RESIDUE OF THE CATHOLIC COMMUNITY, AND A CONTINUATION ABOUT
BABEL. Of that community, there was a vast multitude who were not in the
monasteries, dwelling at the east and occupying that whole region - all
the way from the eastern quarter above the southern - which extended
itself towards the gentiles there, upon the mountains at that part, and
in the plains, beneath and above. And all this multitude was transferred
from the east, by a direct way right into the west, into another part of
the Babylonish region there; in which place residences were given them
upon hills and plains, through a great extent of country.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5406.">5406.</span></span>

Great part of this communion were such as have lived in good although
they have not been in truths: they have practiced good according to
their religious belief. They were of that disposition that they did not
injure others, nor devise schemes \[against them\]. That from their good
they were always in the affection of truth, was plain from the fact,
that, on their way, they time after time asked silver and garments from
others, like the children of Israel from the Egyptians - which signifies
\[obtaining\] knowledges from those who were in knowledges. The ones of
whom they asked these things were the Egyptians - they were Protestants
who were not in good although in truths. This was heard several times.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5407.">5407.</span></span>

These were taught in the residence to which they were carried. There
were given them priests to instruct them, inasmuch as they are only in
good and not in truth, altogether like the gentiles. The Christian
religion in that communion is altogether extinct, so that scarcely a
vestige of it remains; inasmuch as they have not the Word by which to be
instructed about the truths of religion. They \[i.e. the Catholics\]
acknowledge the Lord, but as without any power of saving; saying that
they themselves have His power. They make for themselves idols; they
remit sins; they introduce into heaven; they cast into hell; they save
whomsoever they will and give them wealth; they sell salvation; they
preach holy things for the sake of gain; they witness and tolerate the
worshipping of themselves and of idols, which, also, they exhibit
everywhere. They make missals in the Latin tongue in the place of
preachings, or in the place of instruction; they make a holy external
apart from say internal - the internal is a void, because there is not
the knowledge of truth; they hinder instructions from books; they teach
only spurious good, that is, that people should give to the monasteries
and sanctify themselves by rosary worship on behalf of souls,
continually: in a word, they know nothing of truth. Those, too, of their
prelates who are learned, are, for the most part, atheists, because only
in the lust of ruling and of possessing the whole world, living for
glory and in idleness. They also strive to make the universe serve them,
or all men to be their servants. Therefore, they have no truths, and
they therefore dwell not far from the gentiles; for their goods are like
the goods which are with the gentiles. In fact, they no longer have
anything of the Christian religion; for, as regards heaven and
salvation, they do not think of the Lord but of Pope, cardinals and
saints: all other things are hidden from them. They know only that the
Lord is, that there is a heaven and a hell, and that there is a life
after death; but of faith and charity, by which the Lord is worshipped,
and by which heaven and eternal life \[are secured\], they know nothing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5408.">5408.</span></span>

There remains a sufficient number of that communion, as of all others,
for the service of the men of that communion; or every communion is
served by its own \[spirits\], though sometimes by others: thus,
Catholics by theirs. I saw, there, the city of Rome, at the right
between the south and west but within the Babylonish region; and I saw
all the streets there, but not the Monte Cavallo, nor the Church of St.
Peter: these did not appear. The monasteries, also, remain there; but
how long was not said.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5409.">5409.</span></span>

Upon a lofty mountain almost above me, there appeared the sign of the
cross, as, amongst the Catholic people, in their roads and elsewhere;
and it was perceived that they were attempting something there. It was
given me to see, and know, that certain ones have begun to inaugurate
Babel there again; which they did in this way: they endeavored to
persuade those Christians who were in truths, that the sign of the Cross
was placed there to the end that it might be a sign, to all, that they
worshipped the Lord, to whom power over the heavens and earths belongs.
They also made themselves, there, a crypt under the cross, into which
they descended and concealed themselves, so that they might, thus, in
silence and in hiding, elaborate their villainies. They said, also, that
they accepted the true doctrine of the Lord, of love and faith towards
Him, and of charity towards the neighbor; but that to them was entrusted
the charge of seeing all things rightly observed. Nor did it appear to
the Christians that there was deceit in this, namely, that those things
are acknowledged to the end that they may serve them as a means to
dominion (as before said); for such ones were like the former, <span
id="fr_179"></span>[5409-1](#fn_179.md) in that they seized upon dominion
by means of holy things. Moreover, they conjoined themselves with
sorcerers, and with others, and also with the hells amongst which their
end was; for the love of ruling for the sake of self as the end, is in
hell. They also patronized holy things to the end that hell might rule
over heaven wherefore, also, the hells acted in unison with them. All
these, who reached the number of a thousand, were cast into the western
sea next its northern shore.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5410.">5410.</span></span>

There was still seen a monastery-region in the west, somewhat widely
extended, beyond the Babylonish territory, towards its northern angle;
which was, nevertheless, terminated in the northern angle in the latter
region at the west. Thither those transferred themselves who had no
place in the Babylonish region in that part; and, because they differed
in disposition from those, that territory was beyond where the destroyed
Babylonish territory in that part terminated. This was its situation.
That territory was crammed with monasteries also.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5411.">5411.</span></span>

Afterwards, I saw a vast number brought down from the mountains which
were beyond the destroyed western Babylonish territory, towards the
south, and also from the southern mountains there, and transferred by a
way to the west of that monastery-region of which I have just spoken;
and, when the vast multitude came thither, there appeared as it were an
inundation there, where the monasteries were, below; and, then, all who
were there came out of the monasteries, and the greatest part of them
fled away. A certain woman mingled with the people who were brought down
thither.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5411a.">5411a.</span></span>

At length, the vast multitude was examined as to who among them were in
the affection of truth from good, thus, have lived in the good of
charity and have desired to know truths. That investigation was seen
like a sudden bringing of them down from that region, through the north
and east, towards the south, and thence towards the middle and this
several times by turns: investigation by means of changes of state so
appears. Those of them who remained in the midst, upon the hills and
upon the plains there, were those who were in the affection of truth for
the sake of truth, and were consequently imbued with the truths of
faith. The rest - in order that they might stay there and be taught -
were sent to the monastery-region there, where it was granted them to
dwell apart from the monasteries. This was also granted to those from
the monasteries who were in the affection of truth for the sake of
truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5412.">5412.</span></span>

They were carried down into the midst, to be there instructed; because
the Protestants, who had, and knew, the truths of doctrine, are there.
And it was then seen that they wished to take away, as it were, their
silver vessels and garments, and the like; just as the children of
Israel did from the Egyptians. By that event, such things as are here
narrated were signified; for the Egyptians were in science.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5412a.">5412a.</span></span>

Treasures of gold and silver and of precious stones were left under the
ground in that new territory amongst the monasteries; and these were
given to the new inhabitants there, because they were in the affection
of truth from good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5413.">5413.</span></span>

RESPECTING THE MOUNTAIN WHERE THE JESUITS ARE, AND ABOUT MIRACLES BY
MEANS OF THE HEAVENLY DOCTRINE. There was a certain one near me who
infested others with diabolical art; and, because such arts exist by
influx from others of similar character, it was therefore inquired where
those were, and it was discovered that they were upon a certain mountain
in the western quarter, towards the northern angle. Wherefore, some were
sent thither out of heaven, who visited the place; and it was discovered
that those there were Jesuits, to the number of several thousands, who
assembled themselves thither and dwelt together in a city, so as to be
in the city but apart from the monasteries. It was discovered, also,
that they acted by observation round about, and thus ruled over many at
a distance; also, that they employed evil, and even magical, arts, to
accomplish this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5414.">5414.</span></span>

It was found that they had collected, and posted round about that city,
magicians more cunning than any others, whom they employed for
protecting themselves. Wherever they met any such one, they attached him
to themselves; and to these they gave dwellings in the environs. Thus
was the city girded about.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5415.">5415.</span></span>

In the midst of the city, however, was their treasury, which was
exceedingly great and valuable and collected during a long time. This
they called their holy place. That treasury was under the ground; and,
in the midst of it, was a miraculous lamp, always burning - concerning
which in the sequel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5416.">5416.</span></span>

When these things were found out, then were carried away, of the Divine
power of the Lord, firstly, the atrocious guards of diabolical magicians
which were round about; and these were scattered in every direction and
plunged into swamps: thus, cast into hells. When this was seen by the
Jesuits, then they discerned that their destruction was close at hand:
wherefore, they had recourse to their arts, which appeared like
miracles. They caused to appear in the air a resplendent, shining
banner, by means of which they summoned the neighbors to their defense;
for such a flag is unfurled upon mountains, when danger threatens. For
this reason, such a flag appeared in the very air, floating and
resplendent. Afterwards there appeared a man in the air, resplendent,
and floating in like manner; who appeared, at first, like an angel, and
the next moment as a monk. After that, many other things in succession,
all in the air. They appeared everywhere. One such shining \[banner\]
went into a mountain where were some of that religion who were devout,
to the number of twelve; and these immediately ran down from the
mountain, and stood in a certain place, and devoutly and piously prayed
for those others. This was done so that the simple good also might be
enticed to their protection; for such things inflow and are
communicated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5416a.">5416a.</span></span>

Besides, they had four devout women - who, from a religious habit
acquired in the world, were continually at prayers - constantly praying
for them: so that thus, also, the simple good might be won over. But
these women, since they were sincerely devout, descended from the
mountain when they noticed the visitation. Many miracles were afterwards
performed with that doctrine, <span
id="fr_180"></span>[5416a-1](#fn_180.md) in different places.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5417.">5417.</span></span>

Shortly afterwards, the ever-burning lamp in their treasury was snatched
away. It was lifted up and exhibited; and afterwards it was carried
around everywhere, that they might see it; inquiry being then made
whence such an art that it burned continually - which was magical -
originated. It has found that it was in a certain mountain where some
monks were who invented that art - some account of whom immediately
follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5418.">5418.</span></span>

After these things were found out, and there had been visitation of all
and every single one of those of that quality who were there, namely,
the Jesuits, then, to begin with, the treasure was whirled around,
completely mingled with the dust of the earth there, and thus passed
into dust; which having been done, the city, with all therein, together
with the treasure reduced to dust, sank down into the deep, thus into
hell and a smoke ascended therefrom, which was spread around.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5419.">5419.</span></span>

After this, there was visitation among the monks. Those who, by their
art, were able to produce that continuous burning \[of the lamp\], were
in a mountain, also in the western quarter, not far distant from the
middle; and they were found out there and examined. They said, first,
that they had done it by means of prayers, morning, noon and evening;
but they lied: they produced that burning from art, in that they cast
heavenly doctrine into a crucible, and so into fire; and, when the
crucible was let down, it \[i.e. the heavenly doctrine\] was taken away
from the fire and placed in that lamp. They also produced that shining,
floating flag by means of that doctrine, in a similar way; projecting it
on high, and thinking then of such things as appeared. Because these
employed such art - which was the foulest magic of all, because effected
with Divine truths - therefore, they, also, \[sank down\]; the earth
opened under the feet, and they were swallowed up and cast into hell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5420.">5420.</span></span>

After this, inquiry was instituted in various places, and it was found
that, by means of that doctrine, they produced shining appearances in
the air and in chambers - thus miracles - which were very numerous. With
a certain one, all his books, through that doctrine \[thus abused\],
fled away; and other things happened elsewhere. That that doctrine
shone, was from the Divine truths in it; for Divine truth is what gives
light in the other life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5421.">5421.</span></span>

ABOUT THE JEWS. The Jews dwelt within the middle-space at the left, in
the plane beneath the sole of the foot; and there they had their many
synagogues, and repaired to them and held their worship. I spoke with
them there, frequently; but they were all dispersed and the synagogues
destroyed; and, now, they wander round about without any worship
anywhere. They appear solitary. Below that plane are also Jews, who have
not yet been dispersed. That they should be dispersed is foretold by the
Lord in Matthew, chapter 24. The reason that they were within the
middle-space, was because they had the Word: for such are within that.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5422.">5422.</span></span>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE DRAGON. As was said above, those were dragons who
have not been in any doctrine, but only in the sense of the letter of
the Word, which they have applied to whatever they wished, for the
purpose of upholding their principles and their loves, and also those of
others, especially the powerful and rich, and for flattering the
delights of their own love and of theirs; consequently, who have in this
manner committed adultery with the Word - filthy and heinous adulteries;
who have been able therefore to be of any doctrine whatever, and thus to
be carried hither and thither like the wind; knowing, consequently,
nothing of truth, and thus being not at all in the affection of truth
for the sake of truth. Such men, also, are sensual; not thinking beyond
the senses; holding the interiors of the Word in hatred, and also the
doctrinals of the Church in aversion. For he who does not learn truth
from the doctrine of the Church, is not in any doctrine, nor can he be
in the affection of truth. They were questioned, from doctrine, about
some matters. They answered from some passages of the Word, thus from
whatever doctrine they chose; and, when it was inquired how the Word in
that place ought to be understood, and also in other parts where
dissimilar statements occur, they would not listen, much less answer.
Several times they propounded something heretical and false, from that
diabolical crew; and secured their favor at first, by honoring them;
then, immediately, they found passages from the Word for confirming
them, and thus for confirming evils and falses: as, for instance, that
there is fury with God; that there is anger and passion; that all evil
is from Him; that He might save and is not willing, and that when He
might be merciful He is hard; that (from the instance of David) robbery
and murder \[may be committed\] providing only the civil law does not
stand in the way; that the torments of hell are from Him, and, thus,
that He is merciless; \[that He\] promises and does not perform, as
\[with\] the sons of Jacob out of Egypt; that He repents Himself like a
man; that the Lord \[Jesus Christ\] is only like a common man. Thus they
waver and wander amongst all heresies. They can be Jews, Socinians,
papists. Since they are such, heaven cannot be allotted them, because
not anything of truth, and consequently not anything of wisdom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5423.">5423.</span></span>

They who were of such a character were gathered at the left, beneath the
heel of the feet; and others in the southern \[part\], towards the west
and likewise in the eastern \[part\] towards the south. The bulk of
these also were presbyters. When, moreover, they were seen
representatively, they appeared like black dragons with a long tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5424.">5424.</span></span>

There were gathered together in the heavens, from every quarter, those
who have, indeed, lived well in a moral point of view, and also have
frequented churches and the Holy Supper, and have then been in devotion,
but, nevertheless, have not had the least care to know the doctrinals of
the Church - only to listen to preachings without any inclination to
learn, but only from a certain outward sanctity, and who, also, have not
cared to know anything else but passages in the Word: in a word, who
have not been in any affection of truth for the sake of truth, but only
for the sake of outward sanctity. For they who do not love to learn the
doctrinals of the Church, however much they may listen to preachings and
read the Word still are not in any affection of truth; and they who are
not in any affection of truth, are not able to be in angelic wisdom.
They are admitted, indeed, \[into heaven\]; but they live separately,
nor do they associate with them \[i.e. the angels\]. Wherefore, they
dwell there in the outskirts; and, when they turn themselves towards the
angels, they take away their happiness and good-fortune, which they
enjoy by reason of \[their\] wisdom; they also blunt their minds and
make the light dim. They are indeed admitted: such have been admitted
into heaven within many centuries, till there is a vast multitude of
them. But, although in heaven, they have not possessed heaven, because
no one is able to possess heaven except he be in the intelligence of
truth and the wisdom of good. It is into good which is from truths that
the Lord inflows; and not into empty \[goods\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="5425.">5425.</span></span>

All such communicated with those below who have been dragons - of whom
before; for all who are in heaven communicate with those who are below;
thus they have connection and make one. This is according to order.
Hence it was, that, when the lower ones were removed, those also who
were above were drawn away likewise.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5426.">5426.</span></span>

The dragons, from influx from the higher ones, conspired against the
heavenly doctrine, which they wished utterly to destroy. That conspiracy
was discovered, and, then, the dragons, who were very numerous, were
cast a very great distance towards the south-eastern angle, until they
were scarcely visible. Consequently on this, it was then seen that a
vast multitude of such ones who were in heaven, fell down from the
heavens on every side for the entire distance; and the fallen multitude
appeared like a starry mass, as it were a Milky-way. This is described
by the dragon drawing down the third part of the stars of heaven upon
the earth. <span id="fr_181"></span>[5426-1](#fn_181.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5427.">5427.</span></span>

Their casting down was at first seen from south to north towards the
eastern quarter; afterwards, towards the northern; then, also, somewhat
towards the western; and it took place on to the surface of the earth in
that part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5427a.">5427a.</span></span>

In their place, ascended those who have been in the affection of truth
for the sake of truth, and were reserved by the Lord to this time; for
angelic wisdom can be given and communicated to those, but not to
others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5428.">5428.</span></span>

When the dragons looked upon those who were in heavenly doctrine, they
fell into fearful agonies, and were tortured and tormented; inasmuch as
they cannot endure Divine Truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5429.">5429.</span></span>

Michael, in the Apocalypse, <span id="fr_182"></span>[5429-1](#fn_182.md)
are those who are in heavenly doctrine: the blood of the Lamb, <span
id="fr_183"></span>[5429-2](#fn_183.md) by which they conquered, is the
Divine Truth of that doctrine.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5450.">5450.</span></span>

 <span id="fr_184"></span>[5450-1](#fn_184.md) Some hideous black horses
were seen like dusky clouds. They approached me, and I felt behind me
the sphere of adulteration. I wondered what that was. Certain ones at my
back were then heard to say: "What need of knowledges, thus, of truths;
it is sufficient that one is in holy worship." It was thence perceived
that those dusky clouds were from these. They were then told that
outward holiness, without knowledges of truth and good, is not holiness,
because there is nothing from heaven in it; for it is from an empty man
from whom nothing is perceived. They were also told that a man's love,
namely, of truth and good, is in all and everyone of the things of
\[his\] worship: hence, if there is nothing \[of this\] within, what
must the quality of the worship or the quality of the holiness be? Those
of this description think of self and from self. \[It was said\], also,
that a man is not able to have heaven in him without knowledges: for
instance, if he does not know of the Lord, that all good is from Him,
and of himself, that all evil \[is from him\], and that from this
knowledge comes the humiliation which belongs to worship. If these
\[knowledges\] are not in the humiliation it has not anything in it,
since only the mouth produces it and not the heart. Thus, too, it is in
many other instances, namely, that things must be known before they can
enter into the formation of the understanding and the will, or the faith
and the love. These who were of such a character were monks, <span
id="fr_185"></span>[5450-2](#fn_185.md) because they keep everybody in the
greatest obscurity and darkness: thence it is that papistical darkness
arises. Those, namely, who are of such a character, averse to
knowledges, by which, all the while, is the way to heaven, and who place
the whole of worship in outward things, are the Gog and Magog of the
Apocalypse. <span id="fr_186"></span>[5450-3](#fn_186.md)
