### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="3701.">3701.</span></span>

The magical arts by which they enticed these \[societies\] were
numerous; as, first, that they would persuade them by representation
that the Lord spoke with them, and promised that, after they had endured
certain punishments he would receive them to heaven. They were able
moreover, when present with me, to speak as if they were in another
place, where the good were, so that their voice was heard from a society
of the good, just as if they were there. In like manner they could be at
the same time present with others, and persuade them according to their
\[temper and\] genius and so likewise with still more at the same time,
thus inducing the belief that they had a kind of ubiquity, which was
magically effected by following the ideas infused into them, whereby
they could discover those who flowed in, which is easily done in the
other life; for when one of this class of spirits acts as a subject of
so many societies, she can easily find any particular one. She can thus
inspire anyone with affection according to their genius \[i. e. the
genius of the societies\], by simply applying herself to the ideas which
flowed in. Yet the particular manner in which she insinuated herself I
did not perceive, but she contracted the ability from her nature, in as
much as she had thus also insinuated herself while in the world. In like
manner they simulate innocence by representing an infant which they take
\[in their arms\] and kiss; which she also represented. One thing in
particular was shown me; namely, in what manner she affected persuasion,
which was by representing in full view before the eyes of the societies
a white flame encircling the head. This they supposed to be a sign of
the celestial or angelic intellectual. That she thus represented it in
the presence of multitudes is now perceived, as also that as soon as it
is beheld the persuasion is induced that they are angels, and thus
perhaps that they are with them. Beside these there are various familiar
arts of a magical kind, among which is this, that they suddenly vanish
from the sight of others, and render themselves invisible.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3702.">3702.</span></span>

She was, moreover, a subject of the evil genii, who inspired such
things; and from being thus a subject both of good and evil genii, she
was enabled to be in a persuasive life; for the more numerous the
societies which concur, the more fully are they in perceptive and active
life. Wherefore I remarked to those that were in good societies, that
this was outrageous, that they should have at the same time the same
subject as the evil genii, and those of the worst stamp, knowing too
that she had been several times seen in Gehenna, that she had spoken
through me while I was asleep, and that even now she was practicing
other magical arts. Wherefore if they conjoined themselves in such a
subject, it would be like conjoining Beelzebub with a saint, which were
abominable: for thus they would be more thoroughly deceived than ever,
as such delusion exceeds all other. Moreover should they respectively
conjoin their ideas in one subject, they would be as if conjoined in
themselves \[however much at variance\], which was to be abhorred and
rejected with utter aversion. Yet still the sphere of her persuasion
arising from the conjunction of different societies within herself was
such, that they could scarcely be persuaded, for by her persuasive ideas
and representations she was still with them, and thus seemed to confirm
them; and it was shown how great was the consent and the dissent, by
means of white clouds on a cerulean ground (:for they are interior
spirits:) which when they issued upwards, signified consent; when
sideways, that they were beginning to differ; when downwards, that
disagreement had actually taken place; besides that the clouds variously
complicated themselves, and exhibited multifarious forms, for thus the
idea of interior spirits are represented.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3703.">3703.</span></span>

There were some from the societies which, as was said, constituted the
skin, who were everywhere inclined to reason \[ratiocinari\], but it was
then perceived more manifestly than ever before, that this kind of
reasoning \[ratiocincatio\] was the greatest folly, and that those
addicted to it have no perception of what is true and good, and also
that the more anyone reasons the less he perceives, taking it for
granted that by reasoning only can he appear wise to others, and thence
seeming to himself to possess this character as compared with others. It
was also clearly perceived and said, that such persons perceive nothing,
when yet it is the property of intelligence and wisdom immediately, and
without a process of reasoning, to perceive whether anything is true and
good; for those who are intelligent and wise, and of course the angels,
perceive at once without reasoning, whether a thing be true or good, as
in fact it is well known that among men, though one may reason for whole
hours, or through a whole volume, yet those who are intelligent and wise
know in a moment as to what is true and good, nor do they pay the least
attention to the reasonings of such, which in truth they deride, and
regard with themselves as of no account. Nothing is more common than
this; wherefore being indignant towards these reasoners, it was given to
refute them as often \[as they attempted to ply their skill in
arguments\]. These are they who constitute the scaly skin. They are for
the most part those who were made such by a confounding of truth and
good by means of philosophical and scientific \[subtleties\], and are
those who have less common sense, if any at all, than the most
unlearned.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3704.">3704.</span></span>

Those that constitute the external skin are, in the world, such as
easily suffer themselves to be persuaded, and are destitute of that
expansion of mind which would enable them to judge whether a thing be
true or false, good or evil; wherefore the classes, general and
specific, are numerous; \[some of them, for instance\], being easily
deceived by a counterfeit love towards infants, and some by a
counterfeit conjugial love, \[judging solely\] from externals. These are
such as constitute the skin of the provinces of the genitalia. Those
that easily suffer themselves to be led by a feigned compassion, are
such as constitute the skin of the thorax, and so on. Such a kind of
skin is of similar quality, for it suffers itself to be deceived by
external soothing appliances.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3705.">3705.</span></span>

The quality of which such become was shown by representatives, namely,
that they appeared at length as mere skeletons, composed from head to
foot of bare skin and bones, so that apparently nothing vital remained.
1748, October 26.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3706.">3706.</span></span>

Those that are \[thus\] addicted to reasoning are of a two-fold class,
as was said, namely, one which does not know what the true and the good
is, and thus, though they reason concerning everything true and good,
yet the more they reason, the less they know. The other \[is composed
of\] those who reason against the true and the good, and thus endeavor
to destroy them. Those who defend truths by discoursing are not
reasoners, but confirmators; such are in the perception of truth and
good, and confirm them rationally. - 1748, October 26.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3707.">3707.</span></span>

Among the magical arts which she practiced was this, namely, that
whatever of true or good was uttered by me, she would take it away, so
that others should not hear it, and would substitute in place of it
something false or evil. As when, for instance, I spoke of adulteries
and of Gehenna, she immediately for Gehenna substituted a white light,
so that they might not know what I said. This also is magical, namely,
to take away the ideas of another, so as to prevent their coming to the
societies to which they are directed, and then to substitute things
\[entirely\] contrary.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3708.">3708.</span></span>

THAT IN THE OTHER LIFE \[SPIRITS\] ARE NOT REMITTED INTO ANY DIFFERENT
LIFE FROM THAT WHICH THEY HAVE BY ACTUALITY ACQUIRED TO THEMSELVES.
\[Certain spirits\] were moved with wonder that in the other life they
should learn and exercise new arts \[of wickedness\] supposing thence
that by actuality they contracted a worse life, so as to add evils to
evil. But it was perceived and said, that they were not remitted into
any other life than that which they had by actuality acquired to
themselves; while the are in that life, whether they exercise new arts
or former ones, it is the same thing, for it amounts to the same
whatever evil they do, whether new or old; thus it is not acquiring a
worse life, but exercising a life acquired by actuality; for it is
provided by the Lord that they should not go beyond \[their already
acquired life\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="3709.">3709.</span></span>

As to what pertains to infants, who are not remitted into a life
acquired by actuality, but one flowing from hereditary \[qualities\],
the case is this; that the cupidities are dominant which are connate,
and in order that these may be diminished, as it were, or that a horror
may be inspired in regard to them, and that thus they may be abstained
from, they are let into such a life, more especially with a view to
their being informed that with them there is nothing but evil; as
otherwise they would suppose that inasmuch as they had not actual evil,
they were therefore perfect. - 1748, October 26.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3710.">3710.</span></span>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING SIRENS. Among the magical arts was also this,
that they would inspire others with wrath and like passions, with a
power of persuasion prompting them to kill each other, for they know
that they cannot die, and when they have induced upon one such a
persuasion, they think that they have power over him as a homicide, so
as to accuse him and divulge \[his crime\]. Moreover nothing exists,
whether good or bad, true or false, as to which they do not aim to turn
it to their own advantage, thus to a magical \[use\], so that no others
have a more watchful regard \[to such ends\], upon which alone they are
\[continually\] intent; wherefore they seize the truths of faith, and
goods, but solely with the purpose of deceiving others. Thus they cannot
learn what is true, good, and holy, for they pervert and profane
\[everything\]. - 1748, October 26.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3711.">3711.</span></span>

THAT AT THIS DAY NOTHING REIGNS BUT THE LOVE OF SELF AND OF THE WORLD.
It was told me that nearly all who come from the world think of nothing
else than of becoming great, and of possessing all things, scarcely
anyone caring for the common good, or knowing \[that there is any such
thing\], although under the pretence of the common good they consult
their own peculiar loves. Inquiry was made concerning those who were
only traders, as in Holland, who contemn dignities, and it was said that
they also were such as would fain be esteemed above all others, and
especially on account of their superior opulence. The avaricious are
otherwise, as they are the most sordid \[of all\], caring neither for
honors nor pleasures. Everything pertaining to the love of self and the
world they present to themselves with an exclusive regard to wealth, and
thus show themselves to be worse than others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3712.">3712.</span></span>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING SIRENS. They especially simulate the mind of
another, or put on a likeness of the ideas of another, and thus attempt
to deceive those who are influenced by a love to the persons to whom
they thus resemble themselves. Such assimilations in the other life may
be exhibited and represented in various ways which cannot be described.
A subject of certain persons who were beloved effected assimilations of
this sort, and indeed to such a degree as to be able to deceive those
who were in the lower world of spirits, sometimes so fully to the life,
that the fact could scarcely be known to be otherwise \[than as it
appeared\]. Such, moreover, especially desire to come into the world
through others, because they are exceedingly deceitful, insinuating
themselves through good affections, and having no other end than regard
to self and the world. As to spiritual and celestial things they are
utterly ignorant of them, deeming them mere external matters, through
which insinuations can be effected. They have a highly persuasive kind
of life, but with difference according to their genera and species. -
1748, October 26.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3713.">3713.</span></span>

Women constitute the greatest portion of the sirens of this kind, even
those who had been distinguished in the life of the body, and who had
been held in pre-eminent esteem because they had lived in fair
externals, in which alone they delighted; for they do not manifest their
wiles, scarcely indeed their ends, but yet they may be detected. - 1748,
October 26.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3714.">3714.</span></span>

During still another day the sirens were with me, and caused me great
annoyance, but of what quality they were appeared from this, that when
left to themselves they were borne away into things so atrociously
obscene that nothing, as I heard, could be more so, and that too among
themselves. It may thence be known that there is \[with them\] no
internal bond which shall coerce \[their evils\], no conscience or
acknowledgment \[of right\], still less the persuasion of anything true
and good; but that their interiors are altogether loosed from restraint,
not bound except by merely external bonds, such as a regard to decorum
and apparent probity, which perhaps influences them more than others.
But their interiors are such, so dissolute and relaxed, that provided
external bonds were removed, as they are while acting licentiously among
themselves, they would rush without horror, without shame, without check
from any interior law, into the most abandoned, iniquitous, and obscene
acts. Such, at any rate, are their thoughts, for anyone can know from
this whether a law of conscience constrains one, viz., that he is
unwilling to think of this or that because it is evil, because it is
base, because it is obscene, so that when such a thought is suggested he
is struck with fear, with shame, with horror, or is in some other way
withheld from it. These are the internal bonds by which man is held, but
the sirens are restrained by no \[such\] bond.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3715.">3715.</span></span>

Neither can the sirens be instructed in the other life, for whatever of
true and whatever of good they see they do not lay hold of \[and
appropriate\], because they are only in externals, but they immediately
seize whatever \[of this nature\] they can, and regard it as a means of
deceiving, of perverting, of insinuating themselves, of ensnaring, and
of turning it into something magical; for whatever is pious or holy with
others, becomes with them an external means, and so on; because there is
nothing interior \[with them\] which constrains and obliges; of this
they are, as it were, ignorant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3716.">3716.</span></span>

Sirens desire above all things to obsess man; but still \[to do this
upon\] his interiors through the exteriors, which I experienced during
two or three days. They labored especially to come into the senses, yea,
into the taste, and those who have this desire in regard to the taste,
are evidently of this quality, for thus they aim to penetrate into man's
interiors. The adulterous and the cruel, concerning whom \[I have
spoken\] before, desire to obsess man's exteriors, but these the
interiors, which I learned from several days experience, by their
wishing to enter into the taste, and seizing for themselves whatever
\[articles of food\] I might eat, which are the correspondences of the
interiors The corporeal memory also, thus whatever is of science and of
knowledge, they wished to appropriate to themselves, \[and\] thus to
obsess, and to return into the world through another; which obsessions
are interior. Whether many persons are at this day thus obsessed may
hence, it seems, be inferred: let a man examine himself \[and see\]
whether he is in any internal bond, so that his thoughts shall abhor and
turn away with loathing \[from evil\]; let him prevail upon himself to
abstain in some way from the most wicked, abominable, and obscene
practices, inwardly or as to his thoughts, and let him then consider
whether they are merely external bonds that restrain him, which, if they
were removed, he would desire, without the fear of the law, to
perpetrate them, and would perpetrate them - if he is such a man, then
he is inwardly obsessed by such sirens, which obsession prevails at this
day, whereas with the Jews, and in the time of the Lord, obsession was
external.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3717.">3717.</span></span>

Let a man thoroughly consider whether he is of such a quality, for he is
now able to know. I speak from experience, for I conversed much with
them; I felt their influx in all my sensation, and it was given me to
know and perceive their endeavors, and the processes by which they act,
besides a multitude of other particulars which cannot \[here\] be
recited, for they act interiorly, and very many things were shown me
solely by representations, as \[for instance\] what the quality was of
their phantasies, which were not permitted to reach me, because so
direful and horrible. These were almost wholly shown by representations,
as when they wished to enter into my interiors, they would extend
themselves naked upon their backs above my head, would roll themselves
to the right and to the left, would curve themselves between their feet,
would invert themselves with their head downwards, and their feet
upwards, and so on, all which are their direful, magical, pythonic, and
detestable phantasies, which were not allowed to infest me that that
they might not cleave to my memory, and thus be seen by spirits. Besides
these there were many other things done among themselves, which were not
seen, but only heard, for the same reason.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3718.">3718.</span></span>

They were with me in phantasy during the whole night, so as to occupy my
memory, holding their ideas in such things, and thus thinking that they
would press on and obtain possession, just as with others they would
possess the interiors. I observed a \[persevering\] obstinacy which was
so great as to excite my wonder; but their obstinate phantasy cannot be
described. This occurred while I was asleep, for they are prompted to
act while man sleeps, as well as when he is awake. They do this
especially in order that they may loose all internal bonds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3718_1/2.">3718\_1/2.</span></span>

But that they would be driven away was represented by naked reddish
colored horses, on which sat small naked \[riders\] of the same hue, and
they were conveyed from the anterior towards the posterior parts. It was
afterwards shown whither they went; namely, when they think themselves
to be penetrating towards the interiors, and indeed to the things which
are of the brain, they are borne there through certain foul passages. I
supposed it was through the passage of the mucus into the nostrils, but
it was not through that passage, but through the pores of the skull-bone
to the external cuticle, and it seemed that such from the anterior part
were carried in a mass into a certain filthy sphere, as into a soft
slough, but consisting of dissolved garbage,

<span class="margnote"><span id="3719.">3719.</span></span>

but which was not seen on account of the softness induced, and the
sphere of sordid feculence, into which, when conveyed, they seemed to be
dissolved; and it was perceived that they are the things which are
called cavernulae, in the outer skin of the head, where is the abode of
lice, \[and the place\] where they are produced and grow; which
\[insects\] how filthy they are, may appear from the fact that they are
principally found upon those who are infested with a baleful itch, and
upon dead bodies. These are such as wish to enter in and obsess the
scientifics and intellectuals of man, and would fain thus insinuate
themselves through all kind of knowledges perverted to magic, with a
view to obsess man. They are also of a like quality \[in the present\]
life; they can allure men to themselves, and thus fascinate them with a
desire of being in their society, so that they are seduced, and made to
prefer \[such allurements\] to internal things. In this manner they are
drawn away by seducers of this kind from internal things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3720.">3720.</span></span>

Others who insinuate themselves by affections, when they thence supposed
that they were passing towards the region of the thorax, and thence into
the loins, were brought, as I felt, through the external skin, and it
was perceived that those of this quality took possession there of the
little pools of fetid sweat; and how foul these are may be clearly
perceived by means of microscopes; they are also the hiding places of
lice. In like manner they insert themselves about the loins, and the
issue is, that they dwell in the vilest filth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3721.">3721.</span></span>

Whoever is destitute of faith in the Lord is obsessed by such, and at
length comes among them, and in the other life is associated with them,
and spends his life in the midst of the most disgusting filth. - 1748,
October 27.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3722.">3722.</span></span>

It was observed that such were able to excite from memory whatever I had
thought respecting venereal things, even from infancy, and they would so
excite the recollection that it could not be resisted, and they even
declared the facts with a living voice. Such is their art above others,
that not only with man, but even with spirits, they could at the same
time excite the memory of their corporeal and venereal things, so that
they complained that they were laid open among them; for the efficacy of
their sphere is such that it pervades even to the corporeal memory of
spirits, which otherwise is never permitted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3723.">3723.</span></span>

They have contracted this from the life of the body, during which they
are continually intent upon subjecting to themselves the minds of
others, and thus of fascinating them, \[and that\] from various ends,
especially that when subjected they may rule over them, and have them
for slaves, thus reducing to bondage the souls of men. Thence their
sphere in the other life is that of incessantly obsessing the interiors
of man, which sphere had continually the effect with me of their wishing
to infuse themselves into the taste, and of doing this as often as I
ate, as if they would snatch with the hand \[and\] the lips \[my food\]
with a disposition to eat. Such \[a disposition\] exists from the sphere
of interior phantasies, that thus represents itself, for the taste and
the tongue correspond to the interiors. - 1748, October 27.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3724.">3724.</span></span>

THAT THE MATERIAL IDEAS OF MEN ARE VESSELS OF ANGELIC IDEAS. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[3724-1](#fn_56.md) I spoke openly with spirits
\[remarking\] that the Providence of the Lord in ultimates appeared so
confused and scattered, that \[it seemed\] like the materials collected
from different quarters for \[the erection of\] a vast palace, which
were calculated by the architect, and then brought together, and thus
thrown into different heaps, afterwards to be formed and fitted for the
palace; and yet no one but the architect would be able to perceive from
the accumulations \[that\] such a palace \[would be the result\], while
at the same time each single part was numbered, and was such as could be
fitted in.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3725.">3725.</span></span>

While occupied with these reflections, it was said that thoughts of this
kind flowed in from heaven, where there is no reference to the building
of palaces, but it might be \[understood\] of indefinitely various
things which yet in the thought of man are represented by the
construction of edifices and palaces; for innumerable interior things
may be compared to such constructions, as much on a universal scale,
like the Providence of the Lord, as in countless other particulars, as
anyone may know that even in the ideas of men this conformity takes
place, and the same of countless other things of like kind. Hence it
follows that the thoughts of man are vessels recipient of angelic ideas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3726.">3726.</span></span>

But the objection occurs, that evils are excited by evil spirits, and
are hindered by the angels, thus that the beginnings are with spirits,
and that they, as it were, flow-in into heaven, where they are
restrained. But it was answered - and that with perception - that every
good of the Lord flowing through heaven into the world of spirits is
turned into evil, and thus that it is evil which flows from angelic
ideas. This is evil with spirits \[to wit that\] by which they excite
evils with man, and thus that it should return to heaven. It does not
follow because the Lord flows through heaven, and thence evil
\[results\], that he also flows into heaven or into the angels, to
restrain the evil; for that that which is true in regard to the one is
true in regard to the other, appears from the angels with man, who
restrain and moderate the evils of spirits \[and\] who still confess
that the Lord restrains, although it seems to them that they do it
themselves; wherefore \[it is that\] such an equilibrium and such an
order is preserved by the Lord in the world of spirits, and to every
evil there is, as it were, its own counterpart, or impediment, and if
evil should preponderate and thus prevail, that the world of spirits
should be immediately so disposed that there may be an equilibration and
offset. - 1748, October 28.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3727.">3727.</span></span>

Their fallacy in supposing otherwise is again refuted by \[the case of\]
the antipodes, inasmuch as if they did not know that there were
antipodes, and that we come into that relation every twelfth hour, no
one would ever believe it, because he would suppose that they would thus
fall off. The cause was then stated, to wit, that there is a \[principle
of\] gravitation in each minutest particle of a man, which presses
\[him\] towards the earth, and since there is such a sphere of
gravitation in each single particle, therefore it is up or down to a man
according to gravitation; which is also confirmed by other well known
experiences in respect to the centripetal force. In these things, when
heard, the spirits acquiesced. - 1748, October 28. It was said that the
fluids in the human body had their up and down not according to the
sphere without the body; for they are then confirmed in their upward and
downward motion, and in their tendency to \[particular\] quarter,
according to endeavor \[nisus\], concerning which much might be said.
Thus the blood and other fluids do not recognize the same up and down in
the body, which \[holds\] without, which is also confirmed by
experience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3728.">3728.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE SIRENS. A certain person came to me of a sudden, and it
was perceived that it was Paul, who inquired whether I were speaking ill
of him. But it was replied that I was not then thinking of him. It was
thence perceived that the evil spirits above the head began to speak
through the sirens with others, while I was awake as if from me; they
spoke also with still others. There was a species of undulation
descending from the spirits above the head, and they likewise spoke with
others as from me. - 1748, October 28. They yet continue thus to speak,
and \[to utter\] foul things, but I hear nothing; it is to me as entire
silence, nor do I perceive anything. The spirits who hear say that the
things uttered are foul, but that the speech is as if from me, although
from the foulness \[they know\] it is not from me, and they hold me not
only in the state of not perceiving, but in a certain kind of
pleasurable frame. Such are the sirens.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3729.">3729.</span></span>

CONCERNING IDEAS. That man has ideas unknown to him, formed of
\[various\] composites, and which are peculiar to everyone, may appear
if one will call to mind cities, places, and other things \[which he has
witnessed\]. Something \[uniformly\] occurs by which he distinguishes,
by which he knows, whether it be taken from any particular place, or
from anything seen, and \[he will recollect\] that he there met with
something which impressed the idea somewhat deeply upon him. This fact
takes precedence, but not the name or word; as, for instance, when
thinking of Milan, the first thing that occurs, as being impressed upon
him, is, that there men are often assassinated at night; when of Prague,
that there are among the streets passage-ways through their houses for
nocturnal homicides; when of the Jews there, that they covertly put
Christians to death; and so of other places.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3730.">3730.</span></span>

It was further shown that men do not know what an idea is, for when they
are held in thought respecting an idea, \[all the ideas\] vanished, so
that there seemed to be nothing \[left\], but yet ideas are spoken of,
as it is still common in familiar discourse to say, that "such a thing
is according to my idea," and "\[my\] idea is so and so," by which
nothing more is signified than thought in general. Hence now it appears
that men know nothing concerning interior things, thus concerning the
interior man, since they neither know that thought is distinguished into
ideas, or composed of ideas, nor yet what thought is, nor can they
distinguish it from will; yea, they scarcely know that they have
thought, because they do not reflect upon the inner man. Hence they can
have no other conception than a most general one, scarcely indeed that
they think, although they think otherwise than they speak or than they
act, and thence they might know it. Wherefore it was said that an idea
is a less thought, that of which thought is composed; this perhaps may
be understood. Hence also it appears that interior things are altogether
conjoined with external, so that man lives only in the bodily senses and
in the body, in which things they are.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3731.">3731.</span></span>

But in the other life I have not yet known, for several years, one
spirit who does not perceive what an idea is, because it is perceived by
me; and they now wonder that men are such, when they also were such, and
are such, except so far as I have some distinctness of idea.

CONCERNING THE QUAKERS. In my sleep Abr. Schonst appeared, concerning
whom I had an idea of interior deceit and malice, concluding from
externals. Whether he were really such I pretend not to say. He then
appeared different, and as one concerning whom I had a somewhat better
conceit, but still \[thinking\] that he was inwardly malignant, and
especially that he had a contemptuous opinion of others compared with
himself. They \[the Quakers\] appeared in \[my\] sleep, and at length
\[they were seen\] clad in outer garments \[that shone\] splendidly with
a profusion of gold, adorned as the garments of the French are wont to
be, on whose persons the gilded flowers extend themselves from the
garments to the face, so their face is adorned, or, as it were, clothed
with an ample array of such small gilded cords \[or tassels\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="3733.">3733.</span></span>

When I awoke the spirits spoke with me, saying that they were Quakers,
concerning whom I had had barely the idea that they were, as to life,
honest and upright, for I had never heard anything else. When I spoke
with them concerning sanctity - as they deem themselves to be led by the
Holy Spirit - they said merchandize was sanctity; but it was given to
reply that merchandize was not sanctity, but merchandize conducted so
and so, especially with probity and compassion; that \[when that was the
case\] then there was sanctity, which they perceived and acknowledged to
be true.

There was moreover represented a lofty pointed turret, of a grayish
color, which when I surveyed, the turret began to vanish as to its upper
part, and only the middle part remained, which was grayish.

Spirits were desirous of exploring their interior quality, but they were
unable, for they were averse to any disclosure, deriving this from the
life of the body, that nothing should be laid open, which was also
communicated to me. They said, when \[the spirits\] wished to explore
their interiors, that they asked ill of no one, and did harm to no one,
and what more would they have? - 1748, October 27. It was discovered
also that they speak but little, and therefore that they divulge
scarcely anything of what they think. It was then said that they have no
particular fixed doctrinals of faith, except that they are inspired by
the Spirit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3736.">3736.</span></span>

If therefore they are interiorly such as represented, according to the
things which I know by thought respecting those two, then there are two
classes \[of them\], one exceedingly bad, because they have no
conscience, another \[also bad\], because they despise others in
comparison with themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3737.">3737.</span></span>

It was given to say to them, as to their assertion that they spoke evil
of no one and did evil to no one, that this was well in a society on
earth, but to think evil and to be intrinsically evil, this is not
tolerated in the other life - not in the societies of the other life -
because there there is not such a speech, nor such other things as in
the world, but there are the ideas of thought, which are communicated to
others; wherefore if they are intrinsically evil, they exceedingly
injure the societies of the other life, nor are they known there by any
other means than their ideas, which are their speech.

HOW EXTERNAL THINGS MAY HAVE REPRESENTED INTERNAL. I spoke with a spirit
when writing \[and saying\] that the external things of the Jewish
church represented internal, and that externals were to be compared to
an apple that was seen, in which were stored up innumerable things; and
because the interior things of the apple were exhibited by
representative ideas, the comparison was continued, \[showing\] that the
apple not only contained within itself the things of taste and of smell,
but fibers similar to those of the tree, the receptacles of the seeds,
the seeds, in which was the wonderful power of producing a new tree, and
not only a single tree, but an innumerable succession of them, so that
they could fill the whole earth, and that even to a kind of eternity.
This being its inward property, the infinite and eternal is in this way
represented by it, and thus the Lord: and thus also in the singulars
exclusive of the potencies of the seed, for all and each of the things
\[of the apple\] conspire to its eternity, and, as it were, to its
infinity. - 1748, October 27.

HOW TRUTHS AND GOODS FROM THE LORD ARE EXCITED. It was, manifestly
perceived that sirens and others, when they excite anything from the
memory of man, hold the ideas solely in such things, as for instance in
filthy or evil things, and then there immediately come forth from his
memory such things as he had thought or done during his life, one after
another; for these things which are in the memory of man correspond to
their ideas; as man - which anyone may know from himself - while he
holds his ideas on any subject, perceives that those things are excited
in order which pertain to the general idea; concerning these he
immediately thinks, and when he speaks all his speech is also from them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3740.">3740.</span></span>

Spirits wondered that when they spoke they immediately received a
response. It was then perceived that the response \[and\] thus the true
and the good, which was in the memory of man, was excited solely by the
common \[or general prompting\] which flows from the Lord through
heaven, so that unless there were influx from the Lord, no response of
true and good would issue from the memory, and when it was manifestly
perceived that it was an angelic idea which excited, it was given to
reply that it was thence, and then to interrogate the angels whether,
because it was through them, it was also from the Lord. They insinuated
that such was the case, and moreover that the general sphere of the Lord
\[penetrating\] through heaven, in like manner excited the true and the
good in the memory of man, which was a response to them. Hence it
appeared that all life is from the Lord. - 1748, October 27.

CONCERNING THOSE WHO DESPISE THE WORD AND DIVINE WORSHIP, AND THINK THEM
TO BE ADMITTED SOLELY IN ORDER THAT MEN MAY BE KEPT IN BONDS. There was
a phalanx of spirits in front, rising from the side of Gehenna, and
coming on high in front. It was perceived from their sphere that they
made light of the Lord, and extolled themselves. This was manifestly
perceived from the sphere of their phantasies, which was widely and
continuously diffused. They were in an elevated position in front, and
acted by an undulatory vibration, through which they also spoke, for to
speak by \[such an\] undulation was formerly often done. The undulation
fell towards the left knee, and extended itself to the sole, and under
the sole of the foot, by which is signified the grossness of their
phantasies, since the knee \[denotes\] that which is more subtle. The
knee in front and the foot being bony, they are consequently such that
the speech of those of this quality falls thither with a vibratory
undulation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3742.">3742.</span></span>

This was, manifested by a certain subject of theirs, who said that he
should act against the Lord; and because he thus spoke scandalously he
was manifestly thrust down and cast towards one side of Gehenna,
concerning which below.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3743.">3743.</span></span>

Being of this quality, they were borne in a direction from the anterior
region, where they were above the head, towards the left, and thus
towards the back parts on high, whither they wished to go in order to
call others to their aid, for they were desirous of domineering and
being supreme. They often also boasted that no one could know them, and
that they feared no one. When they went they seemed to be turned about
to the right and the left, with a motion like that of boring, which
signified, as I was informed, its being insinuated into their ideas that
they should desist, for this might be turned to their injury; wherefore
they stopped without proceeding further.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3744.">3744.</span></span>

It was observed that when there they spoke thence, and at the same time
as in the region of Gehenna, at which when I wondered it was said that
they there think themselves to be on high, when in fact they are in the
neighborhood of Gehenna, and that their thinking themselves to be on
high was a phantasy, which proceeds from their lofty-mindedness, that
elevates them thither, while yet they are near Gehenna, where their
\[proper\] abode is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3745.">3745.</span></span>

There then appeared to me a face which was black, and having a white
bandage wrapped about the head. When I inquired what this meant, I
perceived that it signified that they were such as regarded the Word of
the Lord as black, and as useful only to keep the common people in the
bond of conscience; this was \[the import of\] the white bandage round
the head. I perceived also that those of this quality made nothing of
divine worship, and still less of the Lord, and that they ascribed all
things to their own prudence. Thus they were in the spirit of
domineering through their own peculiar prudence, as multitudes are, both
those who are in dignity and those who are in offices of serving.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3746.">3746.</span></span>

It was farther said, that their abode is near Gehenna, where the dragons
are, so that the haunt of dragons is ever where such \[spirits\] are.
They are therefore of lofty aspirations, and ascribe everything, without
exception, to their own prudence and intelligence, which is properly
signified by dragons. They were therefore there, although they appeared
on high, and the subject before spoken of was cast thither.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3747.">3747.</span></span>

I was instructed that from the success of their affairs in the life of
the body, they had contracted the persuasion that they were to attribute
everything to their own prudence; wherefore it was said that they are
not punished on the instant of their coming into the other life, because
of their being in this persuasion, for thus they would be utterly broken
down, but that it is done by degrees, that they may thus be restored
from their persuasion, and instructed. It is a punishment sufficiently
severe \[to be obliged\] to dwell with dragons, which are flying
serpents. These, however, were not deceitful; with the deceitful it
fares worse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3748.">3748.</span></span>

As long as this continued there was nothing seen, for their idea of
spirits is such that they had formerly supposed that a spirit was merely
an aerial wavering something, as such have no true idea of spirits,
which idea, when diffused from others, is itself of the same quality;
for when those who think spirit to be nothing, when they are present in
the other life, nothing appears to them but a certain vacuity; they said
also that they saw nothing, being ignorant whether it were spirits or an
atmospherical inane. - 1748, October 27.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3749.">3749.</span></span>

Their common property, which I also perceived, was that they supposed
themselves competent to everything, and thus in the other life would
fain be worshipped as gods. But it was given to say to them, that
although they thought themselves all powerful, yet if they were myriads
in number, they could be driven by a single fly. At this they were
enraged, but the truth was shown them by their being driven into a
fright by a light whisper of wind, which they imagined to be a cohort
from hell that would carry them away, about which I spoke with them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3750.">3750.</span></span>

CONCERNING A CERTAIN DEALER IN ARTIFICES. A certain spirit was detected
in artifices devised for no use, but merely with a design of vaunting
himself of his cunning, who spoke with me, and that too in an artificial
manner, not previously observed. There was a broad sound of speech,
which vibrated like a wavering, aerial, imperceptible something, of a
general kind \[striking\], crosswise about the mouth in which the speech
is \[seated\]. He said that he could speak like a great many at the same
time; but it was said to him that this had been heard before. He could
then speak remotely in another place, where still he was not, as also in
many places at the same time, so that his presence should be supposed to
be there and elsewhere at once, which was in some measure perceived. But
it was said to him that such a thing was an artifice, and that such
appearances could be presented; that with him \[it was practiced\] for
no use but that of boasting; that with magicians it was for destroying;
that it would be better if there was a good use, namely, since he was so
cunning, that he should, on suitable occasions, instruct others, in
order to put them on their guard against the fallacies of magicians.
Otherwise his arts were of no use to him, unless perhaps it were that
good spirits through him might instruct the simple concerning the like
things, and convince them that magicians acted in the same manner. -
1748, October 28.

of the several articles under this head. If the reader should find, as
we have found, great difficulty in eliciting from them an intelligible
sense, we trust he will attribute it to the obscurity of the original,
as much as to any defect in the version. Tr.
