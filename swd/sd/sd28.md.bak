### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="2851.">2851.</span></span>

Hence may be known, how from the ideas of my memory, evil spirits, each
according to his state and nature have taken the things, whatever in the
composite idea was such as accorded with them \[suited\]. Some \[took\]
remote, some, more remote things, which were far to the side of the
idea; also from every object of thought, hearing, or sight, were brought
\[such things\] thither \[to them\]. For it is thus with the ideas of
memory, that very many things, and even dissimilars \[aliena\] may be
successively associated; and ideas, like a field of many things, are
compounded from objects of the senses and thought, thus are associated;
they are, as it were, companionships of very many things, and in
whatever manner the simpler ideas are consociated and associated, and
whatever their quality, such is man, as regards that idea, and when men
after the death of the body are amongst such spirits,

<span class="margnote"><span id="2852.">2852.</span></span>

then every \[spirit\] according to his nature, takes away what belongs
to his disposition; thus man is rended, suffers, is distressed, and
undergoes many kinds of pain, anguish, torment, trouble; in a word, the
evil spirits with me have taken out, from my composite ideas, the things
which were far separated from the center of the idea, and this very many
times, whereat I sometimes wondered greatly. Nevertheless, the case is
similar as to what is taken away from objects; that unclean spirits saw
what I did not see, and \[directed\] my eyes to filth, wherever it might
be, near \[my\] feet, at \[my\] side, at a distance thence, and of which
I could not have been but wholly ignorant, had not such \[spirits\]
known, felt, and thus seen it. - 1748, August 18. The reason is, because
they remove everything, so as not to see, and some abhor that which does
not accord with their unclean pleasantnesses. Wherefore they reject to
the sides whatever does not agree, so that to them \[such\] are not only
shades, but darkness \[caligo\] and cold, \[and\] as it were, death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2853.">2853.</span></span>

I have also observed that in those things which appeared obscure to the
eyes, so that I did not know what it was, \[these spirits\] could induce
phantasies of similar things, \[as\] that they were loathsome
intestines. Thus in each thing not seen by them, inasmuch as their
phantasies inhere in such \[filthy things\], therefore \[in things\]
which are obscure, \[these spirits\] make them out to be such \[filthy
things\] before they are discriminated by the sight, when they are
plainly seen. - 1748, August 16.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2854.">2854.</span></span>

THAT THE INTUITION OF ENDS AND PERCEPTIVE AFFECTION DISTINGUISHES MAN
FORM THE BRUTES. I spoke with spirits \[to this effect\] that ends in
man are what lead him, and what man aims at, to obtain; also that the
intuition of ends is what distinguishes man from the brutes. A brute
animal is ignorant of ends, because his soul is of such a nature. But
man ought to know ends and aspire to them, view them, and be affected by
them. Since therefore the first and last end of man, is eternal life,
and he is of such a nature that he can view ends, wherefore unless man
views the true end, or his eternal state, and so the Lord, he is not a
man. - 1748, August 17.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2855.">2855.</span></span>

THE HELL OF THOSE WHO ACT FROM PREMEDITATED DECEIT, AND HAD PUT ON SUCH
A NATURE. ((((There were also shown to me spirits who are accustomed to
deceive men by subtle \[acute\] deceit, by putting on an agreeable
\[suavem\] face and speech, and hiding within \[their\] poisonous
deceits: thus desiring to captivate, destroy and slay men, and placing
therein the pleasantness of their life. These were permitted to come
into view \[conspectum\] and to contrive \[nectere\] their deceitful
arts)))), which was done with such cunning \[subdole\], that the spirits
of the interior world could not have known it: When these cause to
actually affecting \[these arts\], suddenly the interior world was
closed, as I could perceive \[persentire\] by the sudden silence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2856.">2856.</span></span>

So that while I was walking the street, the noisy crowds \[uproar\]
suddenly were \[was\] not heard, which is a proof that thus the world of
interior spirits is closed. This is called a sudden silence. ((((Then
they were far from me towards the anterior \[regions\], and spoke with
me; and I was told, by others, and it was insinuated that such were
those who, with premeditation, contrive subtle deceits, and so deceive
under a friendly countenance, thinking of nothing but the ruin of the
neighbor.)))) It was also permitted them to see such things in me as
were base \[tetra\], whatever I have thought that was impure and the
like - which they collected and saw with considerable acuteness, \[but\]
not anything that was good, inasmuch as they reject such, and do not
receive it unless for the sake of deceiving under a friendly
countenance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2857.">2857.</span></span>

((((As respects their hell, it is more terrible \[atrocious\] than the
hell of others, and more terrible than the hell of those who kill from
hatred \[homicidarum ex odio\], and of such as act without premeditated
deceit. It is in front, near the boundaries \[fines\]. When they were
cast thither, perhaps they have been there before, and were hence
emitted, it was then said, that they live amongst serpents, and the more
subtle their deceitful poisons, the mere poisonous and subtle the
serpents, and the greater the number that surrounds and torments them,
so that it inspires horror, merely to relate it. Such a hell awaits
those of this character: into such \[a principle\] is their deceit
burned. - 1748, August 19.))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="2858.">2858.</span></span>

((((((Such \[spirits\] are not like those, who are deceitful by nature,
and place prudence therein: for when these are present it is immediately
known, as well from their wishing to speak \[whisper\] into the ear, and
tacitly, as that their speech is of such a sound, so that it is
forthwith perceived \[if they are present\]: also at the first sound of
\[their\] speech their thought comes forth, which thought is plainly
perceived in the other life. Such deceitful \[spirits\] do not meet with
such a hell \[as the one just described\] but another. But it has been
told concerning those who are such, that it cannot be perceived, but
that they are friendly from the sound, or the speech, and yet conceal a
mind to injure and destroy.))))))

<span class="margnote"><span id="2859.">2859.</span></span>

Such can also deceive interior spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2860.">2860.</span></span>

THAT SPIRITS WHO REPRESENT ANOTHER PERSON CAN BE INDUCED \[TO BELIEVE\]
(THAT THEY ARE THE SAME AS THOSE WHOM THEY REPRESENT) AND THAT A SPIRIT,
EVEN \[ONE\] WHO HAS BEEN KNOWN TO \[ANOTHER\] SPIRIT CANNOT KNOW OTHER
THAN THAT \[THE OTHER SPIRIT\] IS THE SAME \[AS THE ONE HE REPRESENTS\].
This was many times shown me, that spirits \[who\] spoke with me, did
not know other than that they were the same, of whom I thought
\[cogitatum\] nor did other spirits know otherwise: for instance
\[sicut\] a certain one whom I knew in life was so similar to him (who
yesterday and today spoke with me), in everything that was his, that as
far as I knew, nothing \[could be\] more similar. Wherefore let those
who speak with spirits be careful lest they be deceived, when
\[spirits\] tell them, that they are those who were known to them, and
that \[they\] are dead.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2861.">2861.</span></span>

For there are genera and species of spirits of similar faculty \[who\]
when similar are called up into man's memory, and thus are represented
to them, they suppose they are the same. Then from the memory are worked
all those things which represent them, also words, speech, sound,
gestures and many things. Moreover they are so induced to think, when
other spirits inspire them, for then they are in the phantasy of those
\[other spirits\] and suppose they are the same. - 1748 August 19.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2862.">2862.</span></span>

CONCERNING TRAVELLING \[viatoribus\] SPIRITS, WHOM OTHER SPIRITS FLY
FROM. I heard spirits sounding as if with little bells, where-with it is
customary in England to deck horses drawing carriages and burdens
\[loads\]. There was a similar sound of bells, and as it were, a similar
gait, so that for a long time I could not know other than that they were
such; but I perceived that it was spirits who thus sound, just like
belled horses before carriages, also stepping quite slowly, and
inspiring a perception that they are travelers. They came from the back
part of the head, and progressed slowly: it seemed as if they proceeded
towards the anterior \[parts\] of the head: but this was a feigned and
represented thing \[simulatum et effictum\] flowing from their phantasy,
which is also wont to simulate, as if they were elsewhere, when yet they
remain in the same place. Thus they cause that they are \[themselves to
be\] heard, as if present everywhere.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2863.">2863.</span></span>

When their sound was heard by other spirits, they fled. I supposed that
it was similar to the east wind: (of which \[I spoke\] above): for it
was something of this kind that dispersed the spirits. The spirits fled
thence, and said that \[these\] are of such a character that they carry
off their goods therefore that \[these steal\]: wherefore they fled: and
when I asked what goods they carried \[might carry\] off, in the other
life, they said that everyone had something, which he did not wish to
lose. Wherefore I can understand, that such spirits as are endured with
that phantasy of possessing goods, to wit somewhat of gold, silver,
garments and the like, were dispersed by those \[other spirits\]; and
when the phantasy of the others who may steal, inflows, then they flee
away and are dispersed. - 1748, August 19.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2864.">2864.</span></span>

CONCERNING THOSE WHO EMPLOY SORCERIES, OR TRULLDOM. In sleep, I was
harassed by those who employed \[practiced\] sorceries, or trulldom, but
I do not remember in what manner I was harassed. Having awaked in the
night, I perceived that such \[spirits\] were around me, yea also in the
skin of my head; for when I had awaked, many fled away, and indeed, as
if from the skin of the head, here and there, with a slight hissing
sound, like as when some little distended vesicle is perforated. Such
was the quick sound of that hissing \[hastigt hwasande som af wader som
utfar:\] or like the \[hissing\] of serpents many of these dwell in the
outermost province of the head, to wit in the skin thereof.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2865.">2865.</span></span>

When I awoke, they also breathed a wind quite stormy and perceptible
\[sensibilem\] into the part of the occiput over the forae \[cavity\],
yea supposed that they breathed trulldom therein, and this would kill or
hurt me in some way. Wherefore they also occupy that region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2866.">2866.</span></span>

((((((I next saw many serpents \[angues\] crawling in a sort of court
\[curia\], so that the court which was paved \[strata\] with
stones)))))) as it were of earthenware of light yellow color (brick of a
light yellow color), was crowded with such. It is said that \[those
spirits\] live among such \[serpents\] and love such things, but that
those serpents are not venomous. - 1748, August 20.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2867.">2867.</span></span>

CONCERNING THOSE WHO HOLD AS A PRINCIPLE COMMUNION OF ALL THINGS. There
are those who hold to the principle of communion of all things, thus
also of wives, therefore have miscellaneous intercourse, of whom, I
think, \[I have treated\] previously. These are at a great distance,
high up in front. They speak as if they were good, but they are wicked,
as also deceitful: wherefore their punishment is also that of serpents
\[serpentina\]: by which they are tied up as it were into a little
bundle, and so the serpent is stretched winding around them from side to
side \[in latum\], and draws over all, as it were, a ball, bundled up
\[confasciculatum\] and they are cast out. - 1748, August 20.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2868.">2868.</span></span>

THAT THOUGHT IS PERCEIVED BY SPIRITS, \[AS\] LIKE AN EXHALATION AND
\[THAT\] THEY ARE LED BY SUCH. I have carried on speaking with spirits
in different modes: There is a speech very similar to the human
\[speech\] and to language \[linguae\] with a manifest action on the
tongue and organs of speech - next a cogitative speech as it were,
thought speaking besides this purer \[speech\] which is of interior
thought, the thought whereof I did not perceive except by a sort of
exhalation as it were, or \[a sort\] of thought exhaling from the
interior. Therefore, there are many intermediate varieties of speech
\[loquela sunt intermediae plures\] \[by\] many of which I have
conversed

<span class="margnote"><span id="2869.">2869.</span></span>

As respects this speech, to wit, exhalative as it were, the spirits who
were at a great attitude above the head perceived it very distinctly,
and spoke the things whereof it was thus thought, at which I wondered,
and indeed for some time. They also perceived that there was with me, as
it were, an exhalative \[principle\] of speech: and I observed that
spirits are led to speak thereby, so that otherwise they could not have
spoken. When they observed this, and I told them that they did not speak
anything, but that which they were led to speak, therefore \[did not
speak\] from themselves, they were indignant. This also occurred, was
shown them, and observed many times. - 1748, August 21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2870.">2870.</span></span>

THAT THERE IS MUCH SWEETNESS IN THE PERCEPTION BY THE ANGELS THAT THEY
DO NOT THINK OF THEMSELVES. ((It was granted me to perceive suddenly
\[on a sudden\] the sweetness of the angels in perceiving this, that
they do not think of themselves, consequently do not speak and act \[of
themselves\], for hence is rest \[quiet\] and confidence, and very many
pleasantnessess. - 1748, August 21.))

<span class="margnote"><span id="2871.">2871.</span></span>

But the rest who are not angels and among the good, instead of sweetness
perceive tedium \[and\] annoyance; they are indignant \[and\] angry;
which also was often granted me to observe. - 1748, August 21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2872.">2872.</span></span>

THAT EVIL SPIRITS CANNOT DESIST FROM ASSAILING THE GOOD. Evil spirits
continually assail in various ways by deceits, cunning, malice \[and\]
rashness, the good and the things which belong to true faith. Good
spirits do not assail, except to defend themselves, as I have
continually observed. Evil spirits were asked, who threw shade and
contempt on those things which were written, whether they could desist
from assailing; they said, No. Wherefore they were told that if their
nature is allowed relaxing, they cannot desist; but if they were held in
bonds, they can. They were not willing to admit this, although they are
well aware that such is the case. In a word, as soon as their bond is
relaxed, they rush into all deceits, craftiness, malice, cruelties, and
abominable things, as was given me to know from much experience. - 1748,
August 21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2873.">2873.</span></span>

A DISCOURSE WITH ABRAHAM, WHY THE JEW WERE BORN AND LIVED, AND YET ON
ACCOUNT OF THEIR INFIDELITY ARE CONDEMNED. Abraham was present today and
breathed in many things to hinder \[oppose\] those things which were
written: with whom I spoke occasionally, as also concerning this, why he
blames the Lord, that \[because\] the Jews were born, multiplied and
condemned, when it would have been enough for them not to have been
born, and that he \[himself\] was also of such a nature and for so long
a time; he also blames \[the Lord\] that therefore he was \[of such a
nature\] in order that he might receive the Jews who believe in him, and
so they might be withdrawn from the phantasy. But he received the reply
that that they are the cause \[thereof\] and he is the cause \[but\]
never the Lord, who inspires all with every good, and wishes to save
all, as was very well known to him who has been there so long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2874.">2874.</span></span>

Wherefore that they are of such a character, and he is of such a
character is to be attributed to themselves; and that there were born
not only infidel Jews, but also the greatest part of Christians, who do
not believe as also the whole evil world, this is provided, and because
they are such one should be born so as to be a remedy for another, for
evil is cured by evil, like as is known in temptations and other similar
things, which because provided, it could not have happened differently
Since the world was born of such a character, and it was so only on
account of a last and best end, it follows, that he who speaks and feels
otherwise, speaks against \[what is\] Divine. These things were better
understood through spiritual ideas, which were then also inspired into
me, and have been confirmed from heaven. - 1748, August 21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2875.">2875.</span></span>

THAT ABRAHAM IS IGNORANT WHERE THE JEWS ARE WHO CAME TO HIM SO LONG A
TIME. Many times when Abraham has been with me unattended by Jews, I
asked him where were the Jews, many of whom came to him, from the time
when he lived. He replied that he does not know where they are, and
wondered that they have successively receded and disappeared; so that he
does not know, and still says that he could call together those who were
in that filthy Jerusalem: but this cannot be, save from the Lord's
permission. Those are there who still labor under phantasies, and pass
the time in filthiness. - 1748, August 21

<span class="margnote"><span id="2876.">2876.</span></span>

A DISCOURSE WITH A CERTAIN DECEITFUL SPIRIT, IN COMPANY WITH ABRAM. When
Abram departed, there succeeded a certain spirit sent by him, of whom he
said that he could deceive the devil, so artfully did he insinuate his
deceits - insisting inasmuch as all derive life from the Lord, how could
there be such a one; thus supposed that the Lord led him to deceits; but
it was given to reply that it was decreed from eternity that each one
should enjoy his own life, and not be deprived thereof; wherefore even
this \[deceitful spirit\] also had life from the Lord; but it is with
him as with pellucid objects illumined by the sun, wherein the light is
turned into colors, even into disagreeable ones, as into browns,
blackish \[hues\], and other sad \[colors\]: It is the sun's light which
is thus changed by the object so disagreeably. Thus also it is with him
inasmuch as he is an object of life: he is such a one, as has acquired
to himself such a form, that is nature, hence \[his\] life is thus made
by him and continues. - 1748, August 21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2877.">2877.</span></span>

A DISCOURSE WITH SPIRITS THAT INTERIORS WHICH DO NOT APPEAR TO THEM, ARE
EVERYTHING. Certain deceitful spirits when it was written concerning the
representative Church, that there were only externals whereby holy
internal things were represented; he said that he could not understand
these things, although he was able to understand; but it was given to
reply to him by ideas and spiritual and visual representations, that
what we see, are only envelopes and outermost coverings, when there are
interiors which are the all thereof. It was granted to represent to him
a tree whose leaves only appear, then an apple, of which we see only the
outside, when yet within it are fibers like trees, if they are unfolded:
there are juices purer and purer, there are envelopes of seeds, there
are seeds which inwardly store up the purest \[principles\] thereof:
these we do not see. Such is his thought, only a certain external
cuticle skin. - 1748, August 21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2878.">2878.</span></span>

A DISCOURSE WITH CERTAIN JEWS CONCERNING THE LAND OF CANAAN. I spoke
with certain quite learned Jews concerning God the Messiah, that he is
represented by the sacrifices, and that he is Jehovah God of Israel who
was to come: also concerning the land of Canaan, that he would introduce
the faithful into the land of Canaan, by which cannot be understood any
land but heaven, for what would it profit them to be introduced into
some land, where they would live only forty to fifty years, and die.
Wherefore by the land of Canaan is understood heaven, where is life
eternal. What is forty and fifty years but a little point, and scarcely
this, as respects eternity, in which life they \[now\] are. Then (I now
add \[this\]) what need have their dead of such a land, of whom there
are myriads in comparison with those who live. When they heard \[this\]
they said, whence do you have these things: they seemed as if they paid
attention thereto. It was granted to reply that this is everywhere in
the prophets, who if they are understood, these things are patent: for
example, that the prophets speak concerning such things, it was given to
say that Ezekiel (if I mistake not) describes the new Jerusalem and new
Temple. These things cannot be understood, unless it is understood of
what nature is the heaven, which is signified by these things. - 1748,
August 21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2879.">2879.</span></span>

WHAT ABRAHAM \[SAID\] CONCERNING THE LORD. When it was told certain
Jews, what Abram \[says\] who has been so long in the other life, and
who has previously said, that he was well aware that the Lord rules
heaven, then Abram said that he knew that the Lord rules heaven, and,
can effect all things in heaven, that he ought to know it better than
any other. - 1748, August 21.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2880.">2880.</span></span>

THAT EVIL SPIRITS COULD NOT HAVE LIVED, UNLESS THEY MIGHT SERVE FOR
TEMPTATIONS, PUNISHMENTS, AND THE LIKE, FROM WHICH GOOD ARISES. Inasmuch
as the life of evil spirits consists in thinking and doing evil, for in
these they place pleasantness of life, whatever belongs to their love
belongs to their life, therefore were they checked in those things, and
held forcibly to good, then not only could they not live, but also could
not be reformed, that is, bended to good. Wherefore it is permitted
them; that to serve for such \[things\] for the end that the evil may be
emended, for instance through punishments, vastations, temptations. That
they could not live apart from such \[things\], and that life would be
taken away from them, were their malicious practices taken away, it was
granted to tell them several times, and they could not deny, but affirm
\[it\]. In like manner this day also, that they also have their
consolation \[derived\] from hope, to wit when they intend any fraud,
and desire and have hope, of doing evil, then they have consolation and
are quiet; which was also shown me today. Wherefore they also possess a
quiet life, \[derived\] from hope. - 1748, August 22.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2881.">2881.</span></span>

CONCERNING JEWS OF VERY SOUND MIND \[perquam sanis\]. There were also
with me Jews, imbued with their opinion, who said of Christians, that
they speak so much of interiors, as of the heavenly Jerusalem, of David,
and the heavenly Solomon, and the like: thus, just as during life,
laughed (not with such derision as others) at Christians, therefore at
what interiors \[signify\], not admitting \[such a thing\]. These Jews
have been with me a day or two; but \[one of them\] was quite sensible
\[sanus\], for he suffered himself to be informed, and perhaps during
life had thought somewhat sensibly concerning the Messiah; and he seemed
to have thought concerning the life after death: also to have \[led\]
quite a good life, or to have possessed charity in the life of the body.
Such can easily be led to heaven in the other life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2882.">2882.</span></span>

EXTERNAL SPIRITS ARE IGNORANT, THAT PERSUASION PUTS ON NATURE, AND HENCE
(THOSE WHO HAVE A PERSUASION) CANNOT BE TAKEN THEREFROM. Evil spirits
continually wish to persuade the good of their falsities, but still are
ignorant that this is to fight against nature, and change it, which is
impossible. He who is once \[semel, I think\] imbued with the persuasion
of the true and good, and it is confirmed by the Lord, so that he can be
held in the persuasion, can never be plucked away from thence. Evil
spirits are ignorant thereof. They suppose that man can be perverted by
the least ratiocination, thus that the good Jews \[can be\]. This
nevertheless is impossible \[incassum.\] - 1748, August 22.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2883.">2883.</span></span>

THAT THE WORLD IS OF SUCH A NATURE AT THE PRESENT DAY, THAT THEY WISH TO
KILL INFANTS. Often when I passed through the streets, it was shown me
through the horrible cupidities of certain which were communicated \[to
me\], that they wished to kill infants wherever they were seen. This
often happened. Today, a certain one in the world of spirits, of whom no
such thing was suspected, possessed a similar \[characteristic\] in
himself, which was suddenly manifested by something infantile derived to
him, to wit, infantile innocence, as it were from an infant, and as it
were through me. At the presence, being startled \[perculsus\] he said
that he was interiorly distressed and tormented, therefore flowed close
\[alluit\] to me, where he is still at my back, and cannot speak,
because the spirit as it were, is taken from him: from which it may be
known of what quality is the world at this day \[and\] that there are
such in the world, of whom no such thing can be suspected: he said that
the spectacles of punishments by death have been pleasant to him in
life. - 1748, August 22.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2884.">2884.</span></span>

THAT THE GENERAL LIFE OF THE LORD INFLOWS INTO THE UNIVERSE. This is a
most general rule \[canon\] that the life of the Lord inflows into the
universe; hence \[is\] the life of all, hence the order of all, hence
the life of everyone, according to the form of each, acquired by
himself. I was instructed concerning this today, and it follows from
each and all things, because there is but one love, and one life. -
1748, August 22.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2885.">2885.</span></span>

THAT CORPOREAL SPIRITS CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE INTERIORS OF THE WORD. When
I was reading, hastily, something concerning the interiors of the Word,
to wit what is signified by names and expressions, then was communicated
the perception of such spirits; from which it could be apparent, that
they not only did not perceive, but despised, held in slight estimation,
and rejected it as an absurdity \[insanum\]. Concerning this matter they
afterwards spoke to me. It was granted to reply to them by a comparison:
whether they believe, when the birds hear the speech of man, that they
do not know there can be anything else perceived but the sound merely
without the spirit of speech, or thought concerning something. To which
they could answer nothing. - 1748, August 22. It was also given to add,
it is just like reading in the Lord's Word, the Psalms, or elsewhere.
Some see, therein, great light, \[and\] are delighted with each thing.
Some \[see\] nothing, so as not to understand even a word.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2886.">2886.</span></span>

CONCERNING CERTAIN SPIRITS OR ANGELS, WHO WHEN THEY COME, SEEM TO HAVE
THE LORD'S PRESENCE WITH THEM. I have sometimes perceived that spirits
or angels remitted into the state of spirits, when they spoke, alleged
\[praetulerint\] that it was, as it were, the Lord Himself who spoke, so
that they infused or insinuated in spirits, the persuasion, as it were,
that the Lord Himself was present; but still after they had spoken, I
could know from indications \[indiciis\] that they alleged \[this\] and
that it is permitted or conceded to them to allege this. Now, also,
about evening, a similar spirit or angel remitted into the spirit, was
with me, and indeed next \[very near\] above the head, as is wont to
happen; and then evil spirits around me could not infest me, nor
anything inflow from them, for by his presence, this was intercepted
from them; but he afterwards said, that he \[had\] become another. It
seems that through such \[spirits\] is the presence of angels, with whom
the Lord is perceived \[as\] present; hence, also \[his\] presence is
perceived. - 1748, August 22.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2887.">2887.</span></span>

CONCERNING A CERTAIN ONE WHO SUPPOSED IT TO BE ABSURD THAT SPIRITS ARE
ELSEWHERE THAN IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY APPEAR. A certain spirit wished
to infuse in others that it was absurd to say that a spirit was
elsewhere than near me, where he appears; but it was granted to reply to
him, how it can happen, to wit: that he who is buried a thousand miles
distance from me, and still is with me in the same place, is not
certainly then removed from his place, thence to where I am, when I
might be in one or other kingdom. Whereto he could reply nothing. -
1748, August 22.

CONCERNING EVIL SPIRITS OF THE INTERIOR WORLD OF SPIRITS. THAT POWER TO
RESIST EVILS, EVEN WITH VIOLENCE, IS GRANTED. Today, as often
previously, evil spirits and genii, with their eyes, as it were, the
points of thoughts, which no man can know, and therefore cannot believe
there are such things, or that such spirits are given, continually
harassed me, and, indeed, held me in my more pleasant \[states\]; thus
it was a class of those, who act from premeditation, but spirits, and
not genii, who are worse. These do nothing else, than do \[produce\] in
the interior thought those things that do not come into the manifest
thought of man, \[but\] merely into the idea of \[his) thought, as an
effect; so that man cannot know, that by such \[spirits\] \[these\]
things are carried within the ideas of their thought, for he cannot
conclude from the effect, so long as he is in the effect, unless he
knows. Such are the deceitful and evil in the interior world of spirits,
to wit, that the least ideas of thoughts with man, which he regards, and
calls simple ideas of thoughts, are their effects. This was given me to
know, from considerable and living experience. Man, while he is man,
although of such a nature, still is not aware that such interior,
natural thoughts are given; \[but\] when he becomes a spirit, in the
other life, he is aware, when he is such; for certain evil and deceitful
\[spirits\] are still in such, for then they come into the manifest
exercise of such thoughts, and know.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2889.">2889.</span></span>

When such infested me long, by keeping me in my more pleasant \[states\]
out of premeditated deceit, and this was granted me to perceive, then,
in whatever mode, I seemed to be able, I resisted, by fighting them
back, retorting evil upon them, although \[it was\] not of me, but I
seemed \[to act\] as it were, from myself. Certain spirits spoke with me
and said, that it is not permitted to act so, as to resist evil with
evil; they supposed that they ought to be wholly submissive, and expect
immediate help from the Lord, for they fall into such an opinion, from
the general law alone, that they must not resist evil, but suffer all
evils to be brought upon them, and so expect immediate liberation from
the Lord. But they were told, that it is not so to be understood, as
that if anyone in the life of man, if a thief, a robber, a malefactor,
wishes to take away any one's life, to steal deceitfully, or by open
force, what is most dear and quite necessary to him, to burn it, and he
\[the sufferer is\] alone, that then he would suffer this to happen, and
expect immediate help from the Lord,

<span class="margnote"><span id="2890.">2890.</span></span>

and when he does not receive \[it\] puts the blame on the Lord; such is
by no means the understanding of the general law, but it is lawful to
anyone to resist evil, when there is no other help at hand, but only
with the mind of resisting evil, not \[with the mind\] of hating him who
does \[it\], nor with the mind of exercising vengeance; for then the
Lord, by means suitable at that time, gives him the strength and mind to
resist; which resistance is regulated by the Lord. When they did not
understand, or wish to understand this; for they could not understand
what it is to resist, and retort evil on anyone, without hatred and
vengeance, they wished to draw me into some arguments; to whom it was
said, that this is the truth, and a general law, against which, if
arguments should be formed, nothing would be understood concerning the
law and that truth; but there would only be accumulations or arguments,
hence, darkness of mind. - 1748, August 23.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2891.">2891.</span></span>

It was added, that there is no hatred nor vengeance, for as soon as they
cease, no evil happens to them but they are well received, and can be
friends; which was then told them; that they might know that it is done
by the servants of the Lord, without hatred and vengeance; for such is
equilibrium, that when man, who is servant of the Lord, seems to himself
to resist from anger, there are spirits of such a nature, who operate it
into him as if \[it were\] in him, out of a certain pleasantness, hatred
or vengeance; thus, also, suppose \[it proceeds\] from themselves, so
that he does not know other than that \[it proceeds\] from himself, when
yet it is from them who suppose they can \[effect\] it from their own
power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2892.">2892.</span></span>

A certain one spoke with me, saying, that he has been \[of such a
nature\]; adding that he can operate through the interiors of thought,
and does not know how he could have been of such a nature, when
\[since\] in the life of the body he has never thought in such a manner,
but only had simple ideas of thoughts, and now perceives that he is in
an interior sphere, to wit, that from many of his \[ideas\] he produces
simple ideas with others, which he calls to fill up a single idea of
anyone, with many things, whereof man or spirit who has only such ideas,
is ignorant. - 1748, August 23.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2893.">2893.</span></span>

But upright spirits, also interior, are distinguished from these by
this: that they are also endowed with such interior thought, but not for
the sake of injuring anyone, but of instructing themselves, and doing
good, excusing, etc., etc.; concerning which matter \[I\] now also
\[speak\] with spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2894.">2894.</span></span>

It is to be held in general, that all things, which I have written in
this book, are written, wholly from living experience from conversation
with spirits and angels, from thought, like tacit speech, communicated
\[to me\], also, I wrote when of the things insinuated by them who were
then together, they experienced them to the fullest extent; and under
their direction as to thoughts, writings, hand, so that everything which
in these three books, and elsewhere is written, though occasionally
incoherent, still pertains to experience, and everything in its manner
\[proceed\] from spirits or angels; this is likewise directed by spirits
next my head, for I have as often perceived their presence. - 1748,
August 23.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2895.">2895.</span></span>

A GREAT HORSE AND A SHINING IMAGE ARE SEEN. When persecution by interior
spirits persisted, and I seemed to resist their attempts, then was seen
a horse, which proceeded to the left, where they were, and by
progressing, there was a continuation, as it were, of the horse, so that
it was progressively prolonged to such a degree that the \[whole\] space
was, as it were, a horse. Next was seen something which injected into
the thought that it was the Lord, though \[it was\] another shape
\[effigies\] which cannot be described, bright about the shoulders, as
it were, flamy about the shoulder. It was insinuated that such a horse
signifies that they who were amongst them from upright spirits,
therefore, from the intellectual, were separated from the evil, and the
bright shape; that those who were from the good genii, who had good
affections, were separated; for that crew should be scattered, and lest
the upright should be therein, they were separated thence; for such
interior spirits and genii can easily seduce the upright, so that these
cannot know other than that they are similar to them; for such is the
communication and insertion. They take from them, as it were, all power
of perceiving and feeling otherwise than they; for thus they operate, as
is evident to me from much experience. - 1748, August 23.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2896.">2896.</span></span>

CONCERNING SUBTLER THOUGHT \[AND\] THE IDEAS THEREOF. I spoke with him,
who said that he now knows that interior thought is given, whose ideas
filled up the simple ideas of others, since he supposed that simpler
ideas than his could not be given; for they suppose that there are not
given ideas more simple than those which are there most subtle
\[ideas\]. But it was given to represent to him, of what quality are his
ideas, which he considered to be most subtle, and that subtler \[ones\]
are not given, to wit, that if he should see anyone of them with a
microscope (this then pleased him greatly, because \[he was\] of such a
character), he would see one idea \[to be\] larger than the horse that
was seen, and afterwards, larger than the whole earth, with its woods
and varieties; and that his simplest idea was that crust \[shell\],
wherein were worms and serpents \[things\] not seen by him. He was
amazed thereat; and \[this\] because it was represented in spiritual
idea, by holding the idea on \[in\] the objects of the microscope,
whereby those things, which to sight are the simplest,

<span class="margnote"><span id="2897.">2897.</span></span>

\[and\] least, and not visible, are still laid open \[revealed\], and
the various things therein; for instance, the viscera, vessels, and
innumerable things in their insects; which man would not believe unless
he had seen. - 1748, August 23. When it was represented to him, by a
subtle representation, that his least was only a shell \[crustaeceum\]
wherein were worms and little snakes, that, as it were, crawled and ate,
and thus manifested \[causarentur\] titillation and pleasantness, as
usual; then he began to feel \[persentiscere\] his pleasant things, with
such pleasantness from titillation, that he said, he has never perceived
such pleasantness in his life, nor would have believed that it could be
given. - 1748, August 23. But he now confesses that he has also
perceived some uneasiness \[anxium\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="2898.">2898.</span></span>

When it was granted to represent experience by means of the microscope,
the spirits resisted, and did not wish to allow it, saying that they do
not wish to admit those things which convince, for they fear to be
convinced. - 1748, August 23.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2899.">2899.</span></span>

THAT FEAR DOES NOT EFFECT \[ANYTHING\]. It was shown by living
experience, that fear does not effect anything, but that after fear, men
and spirits return to their former nature. Quite a great fear was
inspired into them that they would cease to live if they went \[were\]
away from me; for with me, they live just as in the world, or in the
life of the body, not knowing anything different. When they were filled
with that fear \[timore\] they came to me, and with fear \[metu\]
manifested their fear; but shortly after, they consulted, as previously,
how to kill me, and quite take away my life, so that there was the same
mind after fear as before fear. - 1748, August 23.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2900.">2900.</span></span>

CONCERNING INTERIOR THOUGHT. See above, concerning interior thought. I
spoke with spirits concerning interior thought, and in order that I
might know of what quality it was, exterior thought was taken away from
me, so that I thought nothing \[that came\] from objects, nevertheless,
so as scarcely to think concerning anything \[existing\] in act: yet in
that state I heard what they said, but without reflection as to what
they said; which was immediately given to observe. There was recalled
into my remembrance that I have been long of such a character \[in such
a state\], to wit, in interior thought, when I have thought of those
things which I wrote, in the street, at the table, sometimes in
conversation, when I myself had not observed. Then was, plainly
\[manifest, I think\] perceived and shown to me, a double \[two- fold\]
thought, to wit, an interior thought concerning matters subject to the
understanding, and concerning matters that were the objects of the
senses: like as when I had read in the Lord's Word, then was observed a
double \[duplex\] thought, and for a long time. In like manner, in this
state while I write, and very often when I read, when I hear spirits
speaking with me, then the interior thought is plainly apperceived, and
observed by spirits. - 1748, August 23. They who have interior thought,
also have exterior \[thought\]; the same spirit afterwards spoke with
me, in the same manner, as those who are exterior.
