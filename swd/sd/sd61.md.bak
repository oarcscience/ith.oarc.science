### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="4501.">4501.</span></span>

Another man who appeared honest before all had killed two persons by
magical art. Such are they, at the present day, who before the world
appear as honest, and still are worse than devils.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4502.">4502.</span></span>

That subject of the sirens, or \[the one who had made herself\] the
infernal profane was cast into various hells in front, to the side
there, under the feet, where there lay open the entrance as of a great
furnace tending into the deep to the left hither and thither, but still
after some torments she escaped, eluding them for the most part by her
deceitful and magical incantations, to such an extent, that she thought
herself able to conquer the hells. Wherever they seemed the worst, she
afterwards plotted to allure them to herself, that she might have their
assistance. From her also there proceeded a corporeal sphere, whence her
speech was similar to what it had been in the world, which sphere filled
those in the vicinity, and they seemed to walk with a stately gait when
they departed, - a sign of their conjunction with me.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4503.">4503.</span></span>

It was at length seen what her end was; there was raised up from the
depth, a skeleton, which was not like a common skeleton, but one in
which not only the flesh but the bones also had wasted into threads, and
thus in a long series, so that it was nothing but an object of this
kind, mangled, filamentous, and foul. This was elevated before me, above
my head, and it was apperceived that she had been such in her time, and
had become such in hell; \[although it was apperceived also\] that there
was still something of life left. It was then shown that she was reduced
to this state by worms of various kinds, which worms were also seen in
vast numbers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4504.">4504.</span></span>

The hells themselves at length had a horror of her as being the infernal
profane; she was continually excogitating arts how she might bind other
spirits to me, and those too of the worst kind. It makes \[me\] shudder
also to say that she first killed her infant with two strokes of a knife
before she threw it into the furnace.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4505.">4505.</span></span>

This magical profane subject was at length conveyed down into a hell
under the nates, where there is an abyss directly downward, and there
was there a dense something from exhalations, and, at first, a fiery
\[something\] which, however, was invisible to those there. Here she was
received by woman who at first dealt moderately with her by pretended
decorums. She was there excogitating various arts, which, however, were
eluded.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4506.">4506.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE POWER OF THE ANGELS. I was put into a state, such that I
saw the magicians and the profane without me; when they all appeared to
me as being possessed of absolutely no power, and it seemed to me, that
I was able to move and drive them singly, by the slightest idea,
whithersoever I would. This it was actually given me to do, and it was
done with the slightest possible idea. I could conclude from thence
concerning angelic power, that one angel could see such to the number of
a hundred or a thousand without himself, together with all their
machinations, and direct them all whithersoever he pleased. What then
cannot the Lord do \[with them\]? They appeared then small, as almost of
no account, somewhat as a man from a high mountain or tower can see many
at the same time and see them small; but then it is to be supposed also
that he is possessed of power to control them at his will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4507.">4507.</span></span>

CONCERNING THINGS MAGICAL. There are female magicians or witches, some
of modern and some of ancient times, in front at the left, in a hell
under the earth. Some of them being called forth thence, they appeared
in front, above, to the left, and spoke. The speech of their residuum
was almost monotonous, like the deeper notes of a flute; they confessed
that they were of the character above mentioned, and that they have
little of life left.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4508.">4508.</span></span>

It was afterwards seen that they still trust in staves, which they make
for themselves by phantasies, in which they place power; but these
staves are utterly dissipated, and they then suppose that they have lost
all their power. They were also seen adhering by the pair, along the
length of a kind of staff, although it was not a staff in reality.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4509.">4509.</span></span>

CONCERNING IMPEDIMENTS TO COMMUNICATION; SUBJECTS. When any
communication is hindered, there then appears below a something like an
unknown animalcule; this was seen, and it was said that a thing of this
kind was a sign that communication is obstructed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4510.">4510.</span></span>

Witches turn this also into magic, by interposing a cloud, or certain
spirits of such a life as to receive everything, and discriminate almost
nothing. Thus they magically hinder communications \[with spirits\],
though they suppose that communication is thereby hindered with angels;
but this is impossible; all which it has been given me to know by
experience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4511.">4511.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE HELLS, THE INFERNALS, AND THE PROFANE. The infernals of
both sexes, who receive not anything of emendation by punishments, are
those who are borne towards hell. The most profane siren, with others,
are oftentimes severely punished, so severely, and by such manifold
tortures, that they can scarcely be described; but yet they are
afterwards similar to what they were before, and in the end worse. Such
are they who are borne towards hell, and when their evils have come to
the full, they lapse thither \[of course\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="4512.">4512.</span></span>

In the hells are those of such quality, that they suffer themselves to
be punished, and \[yet\] dread punishment, for they are often punished
there by their like. Such are they who are in hell, and \[these
punishments are effected\] by phantasies so atrocious, and by arts so
diverse, especially of the magical kind, that they could never be
enumerated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4513.">4513.</span></span>

Those who are punished in the world of spirits, and receive emendation
are those who become better in consequence of passing through this
process.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4514.">4514.</span></span>

That most profane subject \[before spoken of\] was repeatedly punished
with the utmost severity, and was as often made worse; till at length
she would elude all punishments, and care nothing for them. She was
conveyed into different hells, which she finally came to regard scarcely
at all, but was there continually intent upon new machinations prompted
by the desire to rule over them, and to adjoin them to herself which
indeed she did in regard to several.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4515.">4515.</span></span>

Being let down to a great depth at the left, she at first shuddered, but
afterwards cared not for it. It was said there that she was not yet
\[quite\] ripe \[for such a doom\], which they ascertained from her
hanging like something aerial, and wavering to and fro.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4516.">4516.</span></span>

CONCERNING IDEAS. There was called forth against a certain one, with
whom I had a childish quarrel, an idea so vivid that I, as it were,
actually saw the person to whom I allude, and then the idea was \[still
more clearly\] called forth. Hence it may appear of what quality are the
ideas taken up in childhood, and how completely they remain; for as
often as I saw him I recollected that circumstance, supposing that he
was disposed to persecute me, though in some covert manner, as he is in
the moral of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4517.">4517.</span></span>

THAT WITCHES BIND OR FASTEN THEMSELVES TO IDEAS, AND ALSO TO THINGS
SPONTANEOUS; WHAT THE HAIR IS. Witches are intent upon nothing more than
to captivate the minds of others, and bind themselves to them, in order
that they may, as they suppose, cohere with them, which in my own case
was effected by methods inexpressible and innumerable; were I to
undertake to recite them, they would be deemed incredible. They enter
into all parts of the cranium and the body, and thus inquire what
societies are excited, which they bind, and are themselves bound to, in
ineffable modes, especially by so entering into the affections that they
can afterwards scarcely be separated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4518.">4518.</span></span>

At length they proceeded so far as to invent arts of binding themselves
even to the spontaneous things of ideas; for every idea has also a
spontaneous \[element\], which man is not aware of, so that there is
both a voluntary and a spontaneous in the ideas of the memory or
thought. This they discover by means of their operating in the right
time, and feigning themselves to adhere to the locks of hair which are
upon the occiput under the cerebellum. In the night time they know that
man is in his spontaneous principles, and the cerebellum is that from
which the spontaneous flows, and thus that the locks of hair which are
there are such things as adhere, whence there is a combing the hair in
hell: hairs are the external natural. I was thus bound to a most profane
subject, and being then in a state almost \[entirely\] different, I was
less able than before to think as of myself, my ideas being led more
forcibly and against my will.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4519.">4519.</span></span>

In order to effect this, they remit subjects under the occiput, to the
region of the common sense, who cannot be seen or removed like those
things which are on other parts of the head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4520.">4520.</span></span>

Into this most profane subject there was an influx, not only from the
sirens which were above, and from others round about in the world of
spirits, but also from various hells. She thought almost as in the
world, and whenever she had thought anything, there flowed, in different
ways, from the hells such things as confirmed and new devices for
effecting \[her aims\], and thus she was confirmed from the hells, for
she was intent upon nothing else as in fact she had been in the life of
the body, where she had connection with the same spirits, and was wholly
absorbed in it than that she might be able to rule all the hells, on
which account there was a concentration of a plurality of hells \[in
her\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="4521.">4521.</span></span>

HOW SPONTANEOUS THINGS DRAW TOWARDS HELL. THE HEREDITARY. It was
perceived that the spontaneous \[principle\], which is the hereditary of
man, continually draws him downward to hell, and that the Lord by the
voluntary draws him back and elevates him. The spontaneous things are
those of the common sense, and are seated in the occiput, where the
witches fasten themselves. This fact was also perceived, that the
propria of man continually carrying him downwards, but because the
involuntary is perpetually conjoined with the voluntary, the man who is
regenerating is elevated, and thus withheld by a strong force, which was
also perceived.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4522.">4522.</span></span>

It was perceived also that those who are spiritual are such that the
involuntary draws them down every moment, but the Lord continually
elevates them. Wherever the power is the strongest, thither a spirit
lapses, that is to say, if he does not receive the good of charity and
conscience; in this case he cannot do otherwise than determine himself
downwards; and that more or less.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4523.">4523.</span></span>

That involuntary was perceived as being of a subtle nature, a certain
something aerial and insensible, occupying the entire posterior region.
Involuntary things are nothing else than hereditary; so far as a man
leads himself according to hereditary \[promptings\], so far he sinks
himself down towards hell; as far as he recedes from them, so far he is
elevated. The power of this principle, moreover is augmented by the
actualizing of a man's propria, and thus continually increases. The
hereditary from infancy appears subtle like a something aerial, but it
is continuous \[from its origin\], so as to be nothing but evil, but
when actuality accedes, it becomes more gross and ponderous.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4524.">4524.</span></span>

CONCERNING FRIENDSHIP AND THE LOVE OF FRIENDSHIP. I heard good spirits
conversing among themselves respecting friendship and the love of
friendship, \[and maintaining\] that there could be friendship indeed,
but never any love of friendship, inasmuch as the love of friendship
ties minds \[animos\] together, notwithstanding the minds \[mentes\] are
dissimilar, which causes much trouble in the other life. \[It was
said\], moreover, that the love of friendship regards nothing but the
delights of life, which draw away \[the thoughts\] from the delights and
blessednesses of the other life, and is such that when riches and their
consequent delights cease, it is then dissolved and becomes none, and is
followed by contempt, whatever the love may have been previously;
whereas if there was anything good and right in a particular friend, or
rather an associate or companion, that that was to be loved, and to be
loved the same whether the other party were a companion or not, thus for
the sake of the good itself, though he should know its genuine quality
and not suffer himself to be blinded by it. Friendship \[it was said\]
is of civil life, but not the love of friendship.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4525.">4525.</span></span>

CONCERNING MAGICAL ARTS WHICH ARE ABUSED. I was shown the quality of
\[certain\] magical arts which are most absurd. They were like those of
a harlequin. The performers move and twist their loins and feet in
various ways, then their bodies and arms; clasping their hands together
they put them upon their heads, and then turn themselves to all
quarters; they observe that certain things in the world of spirits
correspond to these gestures, so that other evil spirits are present,
each kind in their own quarters, and some with staves. These harlequins
act out the grossest absurdities; they throw themselves down, they roll
themselves over, they make themselves scarcely visible; while some
exercise magical arts by means of a breathing which they exhale, at the
same time fixing their thoughts upon some subject, as the blood, for
instance, or the animal spirits, or anything else, observing what effect
such things have upon the affections, and these affections, though
poisonous and magical, they inspire into others, whose capacity goes no
farther than to be affected by whatever they suppose to be good:
Adlerheim.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4526.">4526.</span></span>

Others are acted upon \[and act\] through ideas, and attach themselves
in various modes to ideas; these different modes were enumerated by a
certain one to the number of forty.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4527.">4527.</span></span>

Those who are in the hell of magicians, before they are conveyed
thither, and also while there, are instructed by experience that these
arts are perfectly powerless, and that they are in fact mere delusions;
for \[though\] they at first practice these arts upon each other, and by
them torment one another, yet it finally comes to that, that they lose
all power and prompting to do harm towards each other in this way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4528.">4528.</span></span>

There are very many of the magical class in the other life. They appear
in front to the left for a long distance, on a plane below, and it was
said, that their number was great, consisting as much of those who had
been skilled in magic arts in the world, as of those who had not; that
is, of those who had lived a life of evil, and were carried away with
the delight and study of knowing everything. This study or this cupidity
is turned into magic, so that \[those in whom it reigns\] desire nothing
more ardently than to addict themselves to magical things, as Adlerheim.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4529.">4529.</span></span>

It was shown them in many ways, that they could be moved by others like
puppets \[marionettes\]; they \[even\] appeared to themselves like
puppets, and were moved in like manner as to their bodies, arms, hands,
feet, \[as if\] by means of little hanging strings or threads, pulled by
the hand. The whole, the plane in front, was in fact turned into such
\[magical spirits\]. \[The beholders\] wondered and were indignant, and
proclaimed the power of the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4530.">4530.</span></span>

OF WHAT QUALITY THEY ARE WITH MAN WHO CHERISH HATRED TOWARDS ANYONE.
There was a certain female who inwardly cherished such a hatred towards
her parents at home that she thought of taking them off by poison; and
as she imagined that I was willing to marry her, and deceived herself
with the phantasy of being married to the man \[of her choice\], she was
at length \[upon finding herself disappointed\] seized with such a
hatred that she thought of murdering me, had it been possible (:Sara
Hesselia:). She having died not long after, and before the faculty of
speaking with spirits was opened with me, it happened that I was
impelled to put an end to my life with a knife, and this impulse so grew
upon me, that I was forced to hide the knife in my desk, and thus to
remove it out of my sight. I have now discovered that that woman was the
spirit who prompted the impulse, she having become excited as often as I
saw the knife, and, from the enmity which she had conceived against me,
having held the object fixedly in my mind. From this it may appear that
men may be unconsciously infested by the dead, who have cherished hatred
towards them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4531.">4531.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE UNIVERSAL GENIUS OF SPIRITS. Even the very worst internal
spirits have the faculty of understanding truth, so as to apprehend it
perfectly, and they know into what state they are everywhere remitted,
at which I wondered. They had the most clear perception when they were
conversed with respecting evil, amounting even to strong mental
confirmation \[ad confirmationem animi et mentis\]; but yet they were
the same after that state as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4532.">4532.</span></span>

There is with the evil solely the delight of cupidities, and with the
good the delight of affection, which bears them \[respectively\] away.
Nothing can be effected \[towards reformation\], with the evil, however
excellent may be their gift of intelligence, unless their delight be
broken; their delight is their life; as may hence be manifest. This \[I
have learned\] from much experience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4533.">4533.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE UNIVERSAL AFFIRMATIVE. It is solely a universal
affirmative with which man is imbued as to truths by the Lord, as that
the Word is the Word, that the Lord is the Lord, that Providence is in
the most singular things. When one is in this principle, although he is
but obscurely aware of its existence, innumerable affirmatives are
insinuated by the Lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4534.">4534.</span></span>

The contrary is the case with those who are in contrary affirmatives, or
those of the false, that is, in the principles and persuasions of the
false, or in a doubting negative, still more those who are positively in
the negative respecting truths. This \[I have learned\] from much
experience.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4535.">4535.</span></span>

True affirmatives may be confirmed even by many fallacies, but this is
of little account, for they are easily dispelled. Hence it is that
various forms of worship are of scarcely any importance provided there
be charity in all.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4536.">4536.</span></span>

The affirmatives of childhood are either confirmed by one thing after
another even to adult age, and the persons are regenerated, or they
decrease \[in strength of assurance\], and become by slow degrees
doubting affirmatives, and finally negatives.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4537.">4537.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE HOLY SPIRIT AND INTELLECTUAL GIFTS. It was often
perceived and said that the more anyone thinks himself to be the Holy
Spirit, the more he loses or destroys of his intellectual endowments,
for it is the love of self which destroys. This is still more the case
with those who think themselves to have been gods from eternity. The
same thing was evinced in the case of certain most deceitful \[spirits\]
in the highest elevation, who possess an intellectual gift beyond
others. They can see that they are unhappy, and say that they owe this
to their own life, and many other things which are true; but still they
remain of the same quality, as was shown by an intuition into the eye
where the intellectual endowment manifests itself. So far as the love of
self creeps in, so far is the let there obscured, and a dark cloud
succeeds, to the perishing of intellectual \[principles\].

<span class="margnote"><span id="4538.">4538.</span></span>

CONCERNING THINGS MAGICAL. There are also other magical arts in which
spirits are adapts in the other life that have been acquired by some in
the world; to wit, those which are effected by entering into the ideas
of others, and into the delights of others, holding the mind fixed in
them, and thus impelling to actuality. A certain one was such while be
lived on the earth (:Sverin:), and he showed by such things how
\[spirits of that class\] excite.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4539.">4539.</span></span>

Such \[spirits\] can also reason respecting the truths of faith, saying,
that they know that this and that is true, as also that what is true
\[in itself\] is false to the evil, and vice versa; but still they are
infernal, because they have contracted to themselves a delight in
magical things, and were enabled, from their practicing these arts, to
commit adultery, just as others by the same means, could take the lives
of their fellow-creatures. This delight remains and drags them \[down\]
to hell.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4540.">4540.</span></span>

From manifest experience it is given me to know that the infernals can
acknowledge truths and be convinced, and thus that they can understand;
and they then appear as if easily capable of being reformed, but because
the filthy delight of their life follows them, they are, when left to
themselves, the worst of the infernals, and like irrational beasts.
Hence it may appear manifest that such spirits can speak and reason
concerning the truths of faith as well as others, who are not in a life
of evil, and that they are the serpents spoken of in Genesis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4541.">4541.</span></span>

There were moreover around me during the whole night a great number of
magicians, some of them having been previously evoked from hell, and
they exercised their arts. Being occasionally awakened, I was surprised
to see them disposed round about, above, and in a long row in front, and
having their vile subjects disposed also according to their arts, as
also other subjects whom they multiplied by phantasies, in consequence
of which they could not really be found, although they appeared there.
They supposed themselves to be taking away communication with the
angels, besides a great many other things, but all in vain. There were
some who bound interiors of the body, some who bound the ideas, and the
like, but still abortively.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4542.">4542.</span></span>

CONCERNING SUDDEN JUSTIFICATION. Many \[spirits\] bring with them a
persuasion from the world that they may have remission of sins in a
moment, and that then nothing of the past is imputed to them. Some
attain to that pitch of infatuation as to suppose that they may sin
\[with impunity\], inasmuch as \[they presume that\] they may, after a
certain time, obtain momentaneous remission. There are many such in the
various kinds of religions. They retain with them the phantasy that if
they could by phantasies get rid of the foul things \[abiding\] with
them they would be free from all kinds of sins; but it was shown them
that this was a phantasy. A certain female spirit who was interiorly
filled with poisonous serpents of a representative nature (:her infernal
profane:) supposed that could she only void those knots of serpents like
ordinary stools, she should be entirely freed, which was \[in fact\]
done twice or three times. Such infatuation arises from not regarding
life, but saying that faith without works is saving, and that
justification may take place in the last hour of life, let one have
lived as he may.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4543.">4543.</span></span>

CONCERNING DOCT. NORDBERG. In a dream I seemed to myself to have a
keepsake of gold among several pieces of money. A certain person came,
it was Nordberg, who wished to see them; whereupon he changed the monies
into other gold, not into coin, however, and this repeatedly, till at
last he had taken away the whole, besides several other things. \[During
this time\] he was standing at the back of my head. When awoke I was
assured with asservation, that it was Nordberg, who in fact was seen by
me as having been the man, and also as being of such a quality, and
moreover that he would not have care had he wounded or killed a man for
the sake of getting at the gold, and indeed that he had actually
perpetrated something of the kind, consequently that he was in affinity
with spirits of such a quality in the other life, and thus devoid of
conscience. It was \[moreover\] suggested to me to reflect upon the
characters of such as were priests, and appeared of upright external
deportment. With this man I spoke for some time concerning the quality
of his state.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4544.">4544.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE WAKEFULNESS OF THE GOOD AND THE DREAMING OF THE EVIL;
CONSCIENCE. Nordberg complained that he was in such a dream, and thus
had done these things in a dream; but it was said to him that the evil,
or those without conscience, are in such a kind of sleep, because their
interiors cannot be any more awakened. When external things are taken
away, then their internal have no more light, thus no more wakefulness.
The case is otherwise with those who have had conscience, and have thus
been inwardly different: when externals are taken away from them, they
are then roused to full wakefulness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4545.">4545.</span></span>

CONCERNING THE HELLS. Sometimes evil spirits are let down into the hells
and led about, and thence are shown, as to their quality, to the angels.
At first, they are led according to their cupidities \[derived\] from
the natural life in the world. I saw this on two occasions: the two
\[spirits led about\] were known by me, in the life of the body, and
were then held in respect. Thence I was also instructed, what is the
situation of the hells. The hells are under the earth, <span
id="fr_75"></span>[4545-1](#fn_75.md) beneath the left foot: in front of
this foot are the adulterers; and the deeper you descend, the more
wicked and abominable the adulterers are. Under the right foot are cruel
adulterers. A little in front, are robbers and flagitious spirits; and
the deeper you go the more flagitious they are. They dwell there in
dusky and excrementitious caverns. This \[region\] extends for quite a
considerable distance. Still more in front, for a great distance, are
profane spirits, especially towards the right there, where there is a
dark cloud in which they are enveloped.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4546.">4546.</span></span>

On the left, for a considerable distance also, are the profane
antediluvians, in a dark cloud, something like a rock. No one can be let
in there; for they are in so dire a persuasion as almost to slay those
who approach. Several times it was granted me to observe how one there
endeavors to kill another. This occurs with those who strive to get
away. On the right, obliquely in front, are the crafty; yea, the deeper
you go the more crafty they are; and still farther, obliquely in front,
on the right, in an extensive region, are magicians; there, also, are
the magicians of Egypt, and others of that time. In nearly a straight
line to the left, and somewhat to the front, for a considerable
distance, are those who have not feared death, and yet, at the same
time, have feared neither God nor man - thus who have no religion, and
hardly any external bonds of shame and modesty. On that side, closer to
the feet, are similar characters, but more timid, by degrees.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4547.">4547.</span></span>

At the back, under the earth, are genii of every kind, concerning whom I
hear nothing; and when anyone is let in there, he does not see anyone:
but how they are distinguished, it is not granted to know. On the right,
a little in front, are the brothels of the lascivious; and \[there\] are
the voluptuous, who are in excrementitious \[hells\]. Under the
cauda <span id="fr_76"></span>[4547-1](#fn_76.md) are also excrementitious
hells. There, the hells of the genii commence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4548.">4548.</span></span>

CONCERNING THOSE WHO LIVE WITHOUT USE \[FOR AN OBJECT\] AND CONCERNING
THEIR HELL. DISEASES. ((There are some who live not for any use, but for
themselves; they have no regard for the public welfare, still less do
they find any pleasure in the discharge of public offices; but they act
under constraint, so that they may have the appearance \[of so doing\],
and that they may be in office. Moreover, all their enjoyment is in
company, in eating and drinking, and in being honored. When they enter
into the other life, they cannot be received into heaven, because heaven
is a kingdom of uses, and everyone receives enjoyment and happiness in
proportion to the quantity and quality of the use which he acquired for
himself during his life in the body. These are in a hell deep down under
the buttocks, and correspond to obstructions of the cerebrum, along the
union of the suture in the top of the cerebrum. I was obstructed for a
whole night by them, and perceived what came thence; and I was as if I
should die, unless liberated by the Lord. Of such a character are very
many at this day. In a word, everyone receives joy and happiness in the
other life according to use, its quality and quantity; for the kingdom
of the Lord is a kingdom of uses, since neither heaven nor the angels
can inflow into those who are averse to all use in behalf of civil
society, the country, the Church and the Lord. Since, in civil affairs
and the commonwealth, no one is tolerated unless he perform some use,
must not this be much more the case in the Lord's kingdom?))

THAT FROM THE LORD IS NOTHING BUT GOOD. Certain spirits infused \[the
notion\] that the Lord does evil to the evil, because when the evil are
excited, as it were from Providence, to the commission of evil, they are
punished, as has many times been observed. But I replied to them, that
this only occurs for the reason that they stand in an opposite state and
situation to those in heaven to whom the Lord does good; for the hells
are antagonistic to the societies in heaven, and when the Lord does good
to the latter, grants them better states and places them in a happier
situation, then those who are antagonistic to them are tormented and
aroused, because this to them is pain, although they do not know it;
and, so, when the Lord does good, they who will evil are punished. This
also it was granted to tell them, for I spoke with them: they were those
who were on the right hand in hell, whom I affirm to be of the Jesuits,
who are crafty, and also magical, and more subtle than others.

CONCERNING A BLASPHEMER OF THE WORD AND RELIGION, PERHAPS WOLF. A
certain one appeared at the left, and there was silence; then he spoke,
and it was perceived he was like Wolf. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[4550-1](#fn_77.md) After that, he was nearer, and then
was diffused from him round about, a sphere, as if he were the God of
the universe, which sphere lasted quite a long time. Meantime, he said
to certain spirits that he had been the greatest in the earth, and no
one so learned as he; but of this they could not be persuaded. He was
told that such things as he had been learned in, were only means to
wisdom, wherein there is no wisdom unless they be applied; and that to
him they had been a means of insanity and of extinguishing with himself
truths. Concerning these there was also discourse with him. He
approached nearer but lower down, after which that sphere ceased \[for
then were granted him other spirits\]. He then wished to know about
everything in the other life, and also the arcana of the internal sense
of the Word; and this, apparently, from an inclination in their favor.
He also learned some things; but, as soon as he repaired to his own
spirits, that is, to the life of his own principles, he ridiculed them.
It was said to him that he only wished to know these things for the
purpose of making himself great, and of getting gain. It was also shown
how the case is with this matter, that, namely, such as he, in the
world, appear to be under the influence of zeal, which zeal, however, is
spurious, etc. -1752, January 11.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_75"></span>[4545-1](sd61.htm#fr_75.md) The earth here
mentioned is not the natural earth, on which we live, but the earth of
the spiritual world, which constitutes the lower part of the world of
spirits - that is, the part of the world of spirits nearest to, and most
closely associated with, hell.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[4547-1](sd61.htm#fr_76.md) The allusion seems to
be to the bunch of nerve-roots called the cauda equina, which is
situated at the extremity of the spinal column.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[4550-1](sd61.htm#fr_77.md) The Wolf here spoken of
cannot well be Christian Wolf, the mathematician and Leibnitzian
philosophy mentioned in TCR 696, since he did not die till 1754 (see Dr.
Tafel's "Documents," vol. i., p. 617), and the present article is dated
11th January, 1752. This Wolf must be, Johan Christoph Wolf,
pastor-in-chief of St. Catharine's Church, Hamburg, on whom Swedenborg
called, in Hamburg, on the 2nd of August 1736 (see Dr. Tafel's
"Documents" vol. ii., p. 82), and who died in 1738, ("Documents," vol.
i., p. 690), consequently, thirteen years prior to the date of this
article.
