### Spiritual Diary

<span class="margnote"><span id="5701.">5701.</span></span>

Others, also, are similar. A certain one could likewise convey himself
into others so cleverly, and dispose his dexterity into such a form,
that he was able to penetrate to the soul's interiors. With this skill,
moreover, were mingled such things as belonged to erudition and inward
cleverness from memory. They also supposed him to have an understanding
of such a kind; but it was ascertained that he had not any from an
interior ground, not even in any single matter (Gustav Benzelstjerna).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5702.">5702.</span></span>

Many others, also, have been esteemed as learned in the world, and some
as more learned than the rest of mankind, because they knew how to speak
from the memory as if from the rational, when yet nothing was from
themselves but from others. Their interiors were fast shut; and in them
there was obscurity and gloom, in place of light (Lars Benzelstjerna and
Eric Benzelius).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5703.">5703.</span></span>

Of a like character are those who have by many means confirmed their own
doctrinals - which were nevertheless falsities - until they appeared to
them as true, according to the extent and kind of the confirmation.
These, howsoever it may be declared to them that the truth is true, do
not apprehend it in themselves but outside themselves; thus, in natural
or external light, not in internal. It is ascertained that such have not
an Intellectual: with them, this is obscure and closed. But the simple
good, who have not confirmed themselves, have the interior open, and not
only apprehend more readily than those learned ones, but, also, when
they hear the truth, believe - principally from good.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5704.">5704.</span></span>

Of such a character are those, especially, who have confirmed themselves
about faith alone, and have not lived the life of faith because they
have believed that the life counts for nothing, but that salvation is by
faith alone and not by any goods of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5705.">5705.</span></span>

Investigation was made as to whether such ones are able to be raised
into heavenly light; and it was proved that they are not able, because
\[their Intellectual\] is closed and cannot be opened. There were
present, at the time, certain Englishmen, who, because they have
interior light \[lux\], were elevated. In general, the case is thus:
That sensual lumen appears like spiritual lumen to the uninstructed, so
long as it is not known whether it is from the memory or from the
understanding; and, besides, sensual lumen is more brilliant than
interior lumen, because it is in the world. Especially are those in
sensual lumen who are evil; they are far more crafty than others:
wherefore, they were called by the Ancients, serpents for they are
better able to reason than others.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5708.">5708.</span></span>

 <span id="fr_264"></span>[5708-1](#fn_264.md) I remarked to spirits,
respecting the light arising from confirmation, that, when a thing has
been confirmed, it appears luminous. This was made manifest by
experiences but I said that they must remove confirming things, and
contemplate the principle itself which is confirmed, and examine whether
they are able to see anything of light, namely, whether the principle is
true or not true; because, whatever exists or comes to the mind from
another, even though most false, is yet able to receive light through
confirmation. When they were brought back to the principle itself, they
saw nothing at all; they were in darknesses, so that they did not see
anything. It was then granted me to say that they would be able to see,
if they could admit light from heaven into it; but light from heaven
enters through good, thus through the will: wherefore, if they were in
good, then light \[lux\] would be in the principle itself, so that they
would see it clearly, for heaven does not enter by any other way than by
way of good or of love, thus through the will; consequently, that if
they have lived the life of good, they would then see light in the
principle itself, but otherwise, nothing but darkness. Hence, they would
then see confirmatory things in the Word, and would likewise see
confirmatory things in their memory; those only which confirm would be
called forth, and thus there would be light there too. It was shown,
further, that even though it were truth itself which by confirmation had
received light, yet if there was not good of life, the truth itself
would in like manner be in darkness, also. Wherefore, they were told
that, even if they knew all things which were in the universal heaven,
and yet were not in the good of life, they would still not have heavenly
light, but an inferior light which is merely natural; which is such,
that if there were evil of life, it would still perish.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5709.">5709.</span></span>

Afterwards, I spoke about the foundations of truth, that they are two,
one from the Word, the other from nature or from the truths of nature;
and that the foundation from the Word is for the universal heaven, thus
for those who are in the light \[lux\] of heaven; but the foundation
from nature, for those who are natural and in natural light \[lumen\],
thus for those who have confirmed themselves from the letter of the Word
in things not true, yea, in falsities, so as to be convinced of them.
For these are no longer able to be convinced from the Word. But, still,
they \[i.e., these two foundations of truth\] agree the one with the
other; which is proved by a contemplation of certain things in the Word.
Since sciences have shut up the understanding, therefore, sciences may
also open it; and it is opened so far as men are in good. And it was
also proved that all things of heaven constantly have their foundation
in the laws of the order of nature, in the world and in man, so that the
foundation remains permanently fixed; just as are the body and the
things which are of the body and its sensation, compared with the
interior things which are of the will and understanding; but, still,
because falsities have shut up the Intellectual, and all ideas of
thought are based upon natural things, therefore, also, such things must
be as a foundation to the former, with those whose ideas are false.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5710.">5710.</span></span>

The Word, also, was spoken of, namely, that it is the foundation itself,
but only for those who live well and acknowledge the Word as holy and
Divine; but, with those who are in doubt respecting it, either by reason
of various things in the sense of the letter, and the style, and such
things as they think to be trifling, and for other reasons - that for
them, the Word, such as it is in the internal sense, or in its
interiors, must be laid open even by natural truths, by means of which
conflicting ideas are thrown off etc. How the foundation from the Word
accords with the foundation from the truths of nature, was shown by two
examples as, for instance, he who has confirmed himself against the
Divine because he sees the good in a mean condition and in poverty, but
the evil honored and rich, and that such things are obtained by craft, -
in such a case the natural truth is also founded on the Word, because
being promoted to honors and riches in the world are not real gains, or
real blessings, both for the reason that they seduce and lead away from
heaven, and that they are temporary and thus nothing to eternity,
therefore, comparatively, they have no Esse in themselves; when yet what
the Lord grants is that which is eternal, and through means which lead
thither, and riches and honors are not such means. The second is, that,
\[there are those\] who think that there is no life after death and that
man dies like the beasts; also think that there is no more of
intelligence in man than in beasts, save that man is able to speak; that
beasts think as much as men, and draw conclusions from various things,
and in many respects are more skillful and more intelligent than men,
and very many other things. But science teaches that with man there is
given an internal and an external; and that the internal can be elevated
to God, and consequently think about God, and about those things which
belong to heaven, which are innumerable; also, that it is able to be
affected by Divine things, and so be conjoined with the Divine, which is
Eternal; and that which can be conjoined with the Divine is also unable
to die. This scientific conjoins itself with the Word: that, namely,
there is a life after death, that man has an internal and an external,
that the internal can be elevated to God, can perceive those things
which belong to heaven, and can be thus led by the Divine according to
the laws of order in the heavens, which are the truths disclosed in the
Word. So in all other matters. In brief, nothing can be founded upon
scientifics except it be previously founded upon the Word. This must be
first: the other is only a confirmation from man's scientifics.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5711.">5711.</span></span>

THE LAST JUDGMENT, AND TOWN IN THE OTHER LIFE. My interior sight was
opened, and I looked into a street of Stockholm, the large new
street, <span id="fr_265"></span>[5711-1](#fn_265.md) and then saw many
people walking about there. I was afterwards led through into that
street; and there were angels with me who said that in the surrounding
houses in that street not any one was alive, but all were dead - that
is, spiritually - so that they shuddered, and were unwilling to go
farther. When those in the houses there are dead, no windows appear in
the houses, but holes, within which all is dark; but when they are
living, windows appear and men at them. I was next led through to the
little new street: <span id="fr_266"></span>[5711-2](#fn_266.md) it was
said that some few, there, were living. After this, I was conducted back
towards. . . . . . . , <span id="fr_267"></span>[5711-3](#fn_267.md) at the
marketplace. There, scarcely anyone was living. . . . . ., that, there,
some were. Likewise at the other side of the bridge, where. . . . ., In
the market-place there were not any who were living, except in one house
at the corner. . . . . ; none, moreover, in the large houses there.
Next, \[I was conducted\] to the long street out of the market-place, .
. . . . the chemists shop, <span id="fr_268"></span>[5711-4](#fn_268.md)
also, no one was alive; but I did not look far within. Nor was there
anything living from the market-place towards the sea: and so on. They
said that, nevertheless, all the houses were full, but those who are not
alive do not appear to the angels; but that when spirits, especially
evil ones, walk about in the streets there, windows appear, and the men
there in the light; for the evil see in their own light, and also see
those who are in a like light. Bergenstjerna was there, in the street,
the large new street; also others, who said that they \[the
inhabitants\] appear before their eyes, though not at that time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5712.">5712.</span></span>

Afterwards, I was led through the London which is referred to
above, <span id="fr_269"></span>[5712-1](#fn_269.md) and was there
conducted along the back part by the meaner \[thoroughfares\], almost as
far as the Exchange; <span id="fr_270"></span>[5712-2](#fn_270.md) and it
was said that neither were those there living, nor, also, those at the
other part. In Cheapside, some were; and also at the part by the
temple. <span id="fr_271"></span>[5712-3](#fn_271.md) I was not led any
farther. Hence it was plain that few at that part, there, were living.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5713.">5713.</span></span>

It was said, moreover, that, at the east side of London in the other
life, is a little city where upright and good men dwell, but the vile
appear, to those who are in the town, towards the west; also, that it is
not allowed those who are in the town to enter into that city. They are
prevented by watchmen; and, besides, they cannot endure the sphere of
their life. As soon as they come thither, they are seized with agony,
and retire: thus are those protected. They are at the east there,
because the east is the good of love and of charity. It was perceived,
moreover, that, as long as the large town is preserved, there is there
such a city at the east; but that there is not such a city in Stockholm.
I was also conducted through that little London-city; and some there
spoke with us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5714.">5714.</span></span>

It was said, moreover, that, outside every city whatever are out-and-out
robbers, in great number, fields full of them; and that nobody dares go
outside a city, for then he falls into the hands of the robbers and
incurs many perils as to life: wherefore, all remain in the cities, nor
do they go out. I was also conducted outside a city; and there was a
crew of robbers, who knew instantly what I was, and how they could
attack and destroy me. For such things are their study; so that, as soon
as they see any, they perceive their lives and attack them. Those
robbers do not dare to enter into the cities. If they enter, they are
not admitted into any house, but remain in the streets; and when they
make an appearance they are ordered to go out, which also they do; for,
when they stay in the streets they have not any power, because, in the
cities, law always reigns, and hence there is security, as in the cities
of the world. But \[it was said\] that if they are admitted in a house,
they destroy those who are there. Not one of them, however, is admitted
into any house, unless the house is such that those who are there are no
longer able to remain in it; for as soon as they enter and see the men
in a house, they know instantly of what character they are, and connect
themselves with their dispositions; and, as soon as they are connected,
they have communication with them. This is also the case when they are
outside the cities. They \[i.e. the dwellers\] are thus infested until
that house is rifled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5715.">5715.</span></span>

It was said, moreover, that, when a city is such that there are no
longer any good there, it is then destroyed, and that this is their last
judgment. It was also said that such cities are destroyed in a very
short time, and that the dwellers in them are scattered abroad, and
everyone driven away to his own place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5716.">5716.</span></span>

The reason there are such cities \[as in the world\], and similar
houses, is owing to men in the world who dwell in cities and houses
there; and because such ones are in them in the other life as in the
world, and in like houses; also, because the correspondence is close and
material, according to the ideas of the thoughts of men in the world.
But now, in this last time of the Church, another arrangement takes
place, and another correspondence: thus, through correspondences not so
direct and close, but more remote.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5718.">5718.</span></span>

The part of the city of London to the west was also destroyed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5719.">5719.</span></span>

It was said of those in the houses \[in\] the cities, who were not good,
that they pay no attention whatever to heavenly things, but turn
themselves from them; and that they do nothing else but talk to each
other about worldly and bodily matters, and eat and drink, and listen to
the things which happen round about, as with such people in the world:
that, in a word, the delights of the world and the body are their life,
and not at all the delights of heaven. They formerly attended churches;
but, now, there no longer appear churches for them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5720.">5720.</span></span>

 <span id="fr_272"></span>[5720-1](#fn_272.md) AFTER DEATH MAN BECOMES AS
HE HAS LIVED; ALSO, HE IS IN HUMAN FORM. That a man is his own good and
his own truth, was shown from the obedience and unanimous agreement of
the body with his spiritual world, or with his will and understanding.
This appears to the life; so that when the man wills the body acts, and
when the man thinks, he also speaks, with all the organs - the face also
speaks too - to such a degree that the very will appears as it were in
the body; so that, when the hand does anything, it is as if the will is
in the hand; when the mouth speaks, that it is not the thought but the
mouth with its organs; and so on with the rest: thus, that the man's
will is everywhere in the body, and not as it were enthroned in one
place, although its beginning is in the brain. Hence is plain what the
body is, that it is only the Voluntary and Intellectual in a form. Why
not \[also\] the spirit? - which is the man after death. This is more
than a man, or \[more than\] will and understanding; for a spirit is
nothing else in a form, which form also is the human, because the whole
heaven, and the whole Divine, is from such a form and in such a form;
and since such has been man's form in the world, still more must it be
when he becomes a spirit. Hence it is that a spirit appears altogether
according to his love, thus according to his will, or according to his
interiors. It is plain, from this, that a man's life determines the
quality of his spirit, and that he is such as his life is, thus as his
will and understanding for the whole of man's life refers itself to
those two, and proceeds from those two.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5721.">5721.</span></span>

 <span id="fr_273"></span>[5721-1](#fn_273.md) It was moreover stated
respecting those in Stockholm, that they care for nothing except to hear
what happens in the city and outside the city; as, for example, who was
with me, whether a thing is still so and so, but nothing at all about
doctrinals, \[even\] what they are. They allied themselves with those
who were merely natural and material, although they knew that they were
devils. They do this, walking about in the streets and markets, and
ridicule all things; thus, there is nothing of the Church and of heaven
with them. They are almost all of such a disposition that they want to
lead and rule others: this is fixed in them. I saw the vastation of a
part of Stockholm. The left side of the new street <span
id="fr_274"></span>[5721-2](#fn_274.md) was entirely destroyed, so that
there was no longer a single house, but only a waste; also a part in
Sodermalm, at the farther side there, right up to the houses nearer to
mine; and everyone was cast forth according to his nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5722.">5722.</span></span>

THE DRAGONISTS. There was a certain one who was only a material or
sensual man, who was yet an archbishop (Eric Benzelius). In the life of
the body, he cared nothing at all for the Word, and very little for the
doctrine of the Church, but only for worldly things, languages and
researches relating to his country. He possessed the Word; but it served
him only for preaching, and nothing at all for life or doctrine. He even
despised it, and did not believe anything - as another, to whom he
confided that it was so, stated. He believed a thing to be so, whether
it was in favor of doctrine, or against the doctrine of the Church. He
loved himself above all things, and esteemed justice and equity as of no
moment, save so far as they served for reputation. In a word, he was
utterly corporeal, or sensual in the extreme. I saw him in the light of
heaven: he was in a horrible form, no longer human. From his authority
in the world, and from his manner of speech thence acquired, also from
feigned affection, he was able to win others to himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5722a.">5722a.</span></span>

Those who believe the Word, but only as to the letter, constitute the
head of the dragon. They do not care for doctrine, and love themselves
and the world above all things. Those to whom the Word serves as a means
of honor, are the head of the dragon; those, however, constitute his
tail, to whom the Word serves only for preaching, but not at all for
life. When these think regarding it they despise it. Those, also, who
devise plots and schemes in the world, constitute his life, or poison.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5723.">5723.</span></span>

I saw a great number of robber-priests who adhered to him \[i.e., the
dragon\], cast out of heaven; who, being explored, were totally opposed
to the truths of faith, save for the sake of externals in the world. To
them the gate into heaven was closed; for they did all things on account
of self and the world, and nothing on account of the Divine. All these
never think about the Lord's Divine when they think of the Lord, but
only about the human, \[namely\] that it was entirely like another
man's, and nothing more: some that it was yet meaner. The bulk of these
were of the number of those who are in faith alone; wherefore, they are
also, from doctrine, of such a character that they care nothing about
life, but only faith; and all these are cast into the lakes of those who
are at the southern side, towards the east. Those who were there before,
are cast in still farther.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5724.">5724.</span></span>

These are of the dragon; but those who are from the Catholic religion
are the beast <span id="fr_275"></span>[5724-1](#fn_275.md) of the sea and
of the earth, which are mentioned in the Apocalypse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5729a.">5729a.</span></span>

 <span id="fr_276"></span>[5729a-1](#fn_276.md) THE MOGUL: ALSO THE LAST
JUDGMENT. The Mongols are at the southern side beyond the Christian
region. They are haughty, and desire to be distinguished above all
others. They are also hostile to Christians. I saw that they were
likewise cast down into hells. There were many mountains there, on which
they dwell; and they were cast down. The part sank. Those from some of
them were cast down into the hells: those on others, to certain places
in the desert. They are haughty on account of being rich. There is a
diamond mine with them; also, gold with them. All those underwent such
judgment who think only about Mohammed and little about God; as all
there do who are in the love of self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5730.">5730.</span></span>

HOW SOME ARE INSTRUCTED IN THE OTHER LIFE. There also occur instructions
of boys and girls, and also of the simple, in the following manner.
Where those are assembled who are of the celestial kingdom - who are
such that they see truths and thence know them, but are not able to give
expression to them; - these, when they hear those who are of the
spiritual kingdom talking to each other, say, when they utter truths,
that it is so, and applaud; but, when they utter things not true, they
say that it is thus, and should be said thus. Where also, they are
city-dwellers, and can be instructed by means of civic things, they say
that they can speak better if they will, if they reflect, and so forth.
Hence they think that what they speak, and what they are about to say,
is true; and then resume and say it differently. If it is then true,
they \[i.e. the celestials\] say that it is so, and applaud. They are
kept in a regard for the speaker; and, moreover, he is silent. He
himself, too, is thence instructed; for those things which he hears are
insinuated into his sight, and thus he knows things he previously did
not. The former are just as much perfected by the spiritual, as the
spiritual by the celestial; for, if the latter do not hear truths, and
thus see them, they are dull, for they cannot think.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5731.">5731.</span></span>

THE VASTATION OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT IN ANY CHARITY: THE LAST JUDGMENT. I
was at length let into a heavy state, which was one of charity grossly
natural, with which earthly delights mingled themselves. It commenced
from a certain one who infused profanation. He was such that he
perceived doctrinals better than others, and clearly perceived those
things which were stated about truths; but, on the other hand, he was
such that he held in hatred all who did not pay him homage as some one
superior to other people: in the world he persecuted these, so far as
they did not address him obsequiously. Such was his will; and, because
he was such, he could also inspire profanation in others; and when he
did this, he likewise so artfully simulated friendship that they did not
perceive \[his real purpose\]: from which infusion, many were miserably
tormented (\[He was\] the Provincial Governor of Ostrogothia, who was
the King's Secretary.) But this was turned, with me, into such an
external, mixed with delight, and at the same time with some good - in
such as most at this day in the world would be able to be in. This was
done in order that it might be known of what quality is the Christian
world at this day, and of what quality their charity; consequently, what
kind of heaven they have. And I was kept in this state for two days, so
that it might be known who were able to be in it; and those who were in
it were separated. <span id="fr_277"></span>[5731-1](#fn_277.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5731a.">5731a.</span></span>

Then, in the meanwhile, those who were in faith alone, or who were in
the doctrine which they call the doctrine of faith - who reject charity
as of saving efficacy, or \[deny\] that heaven is in it but only in
faith alone; - these then rose up, more than others, against genuine
doctrine, without anyone provoking them, and were gathered together, and
at length took counsel to call forth all, as many as they could, from
every quarter except the eastern. They were not able to come there,
because those there were protected by the Lord; and this right up to the
Mohammedans at the western side, and to the Mohammedans at the southern
quarter; besides also, in the northern quarter, those who were upon the
mountains and in the plains there. They sent out as many as fifty from
themselves, to a hundred places in all directions roundabout, in order
that they might call forth those \[there\] present, and employ them as
subjects; and those who remained there distributed by tens. These
powerfully aided them, and sustained them in that rebellion, with the
purpose of altogether destroying heavenly doctrine, because heaven was
stated to be in charity, and not in faith apart from charity; thus in
man's life, which makes the man, and not in knowledge and understanding
apart from life. On account of this, they promoted such rebellion, with
the fixed purpose of destroying doctrine itself, although it was
previously shown them that this comes from heaven and from the Lord - as
also they acknowledged; for the intellectual can be enlightened with
every person whatsoever, and thus what is true be acknowledged. But,
since they were without any charity, or without good of life, therefore,
they constantly acted as impious enemies against heaven and against the
Lord. They also said that they know that it is from the Lord, and that
they likewise know that all are left in peace, of whatever religion they
may be, if only they acknowledge the Divine, and, in the Christian
Church, the Lord's Divine, and do not do evil to others who do not do
evil to them. But it was in vain; for they were remitted into their
interiors, which were such that they were without any conscience; as
also was proved: indeed, they did not know what conscience is. Such,
then, were those who were in faith alone. Wherefore, all those,
amounting to many myriads, an immense number, who were not in any
charity, were discovered and hurled completely down from many mountains
and plains; and were cast into hells.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5732.">5732.</span></span>

Yea, they were of such a character that they conjoined themselves with
monks who have also been such; especially those who have believed that
they are Christ, and that they have all power and Christ none, and who
have performed holy things in externals because they personated Christ,
and in internals were such that they were in murderous hatred against
all those who did not adore them as Christ, consequently as God, to whom
belongs all power in the heavens: with these, also, the former ones
conjoined themselves and acted in unison.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5733.">5733.</span></span>

At length, when the great bulk were cast down, those leaders who were of
faith alone were reached: wherefore, certain of them became black like
devils, from within and also without; so that they could no longer be
recognized as men, but wholly as the blackest devils, and so were cast
into hells; everyone, nevertheless, according to his own evil of life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5734.">5734.</span></span>

This I am able to assert: that he who does not acknowledge the Divine,
and, in the Church, the Lord's Divine, and does not live a life of
faith, which is a life of charity according to doctrine, cannot be
otherwise than cast into hell, for he divests himself of everything
human. Man is such as his life, from head even to heel. He who is black
as to life, is black altogether. Let them think howsoever they will, and
let them persuade themselves against it in what manner they please, yet,
nevertheless, it is eternal verity. Yet, let them know that men of every
religion may be saved, even those who are in the doctrine of faith
alone, provided only they live the life of faith, which is that of
charity, and thus do not appropriate inwardly in themselves such things
as are diabolical. The external signifies nothing; because, if this is
separated, then it is their internal which constitutes the life, not the
external without the internal. It has been commanded me to openly
declare this to them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5735.">5735.</span></span>

It was also searched out, by turning them to their loves, that they did
not act on account of any zeal for doctrine, but from the delight of
evil-doing; likewise, that, since they commanded others in life, they
were now also such that they were able to lead to evil - doing others
who were like themselves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5736.">5736.</span></span>

These are they who are called "he-goats" by the Lord; of whom it is said
that they did not exercise any charity, and that, therefore, they would
go into eternal fire for they are in the dragon, and constitute some
part of it. They were in their mountains for a while; and there led an
external life, for they were detained in that; but, when their thoughts
penetrated roundabout, and infested all, so that they did not know what
doing good was, then their externals were taken away and it was shown of
what quality they were.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5737.">5737.</span></span>

THE LAST JUDGMENT OF THE RESIDUE OF THE CATHOLIC COMMUNION. Above the
head were many from the Christian world, who showed me that they were in
greater light, and also in greater heat than others; and, inasmuch as
there was there, and fell down thence, before my face, a flaming evil
light, it was perceived, that perhaps it was not well with them, and
that the light was false and the heat unclean. It was then discovered
whence their heat and light was.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5738.">5738.</span></span>

The heat was borne in by those who were in the western quarter, - by
monks who believed themselves to be Christ, and wanted to be worshipped
as gods on the ground that they possessed heaven and thus had power over
the souls of men, and on that account behaved themselves in external
form like saints, so that they might induce the simple to believe that
they were in a manner gods. But when they were at length explored, they
were inwardly profane; for every single one who was not willing to
acknowledge them as gods they held in deadly hatred, and with such
vindictiveness, that, in the last degree of their ferocity, they wished
to kill them. Thus, they were inwardly devils. In order to seduce all
others wherever they could, they devised arts so that they could let in
heats, and this in divers ways and from various places, both good and
evil. And this they effected by means of transfers, which can take place
in the other life; for such things can be transferred to others. They
wished, by this means, to induce a faith that they were gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5739.">5739.</span></span>

Those who infused the light, were also in the western quarter there,
from two places upon mountains: upon a double one towards the north, on
another towards the south. Those who were on the double mountain at the
north, were also of the Catholic communion, and were similarly expert in
the art of transferring the light from the place where the light was,
also from the genuine truths of faith, which they had among them - which
was permitted; but such ones were in the persuasion that there was a
Divine, but that all those things were from nature. Respecting that
matter, they infused a deadly persuasion, which it was granted me to
perceive; and they wished, by this means, to induce the faith that they
were gods, and that they were able to give heaven to anyone they
pleased. They thereby seduced many simple-minded ones who, being
nevertheless good, were preserved; for they had a powerful persuasive
faculty. Their intention was, as they were also forced to proclaim,
that, when they had induced that faith, they would afterwards rule over
the souls of all, and over heaven, because heaven is conferred by them.
Hence it came to pass that that mountain opened itself in the midst, and
swallowed them all; and those there were dispatched into the deepest
darkness, which was now and then changed into infernal fire. Also, the
mountain was immediately opened above; and from it, too, all of such a
character were cast into the same gulf; and this even to many hundred
thousands. The like happened with the other mountain, which was towards
the south, more in the western quarter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5740.">5740.</span></span>

MEN DO NOT KNOW WHAT REGENERATION IS. Many were explored, even those who
in the world were more learned than others, as to whether they knew what
regeneration is, since that is the essential of salvation; for the Lord
says, that he who is not born anew cannot enter into truths, and
elsewhere it is said, those who are born of God. But all said that it is
Baptism, because it is said by water and the Spirit, and that they do
not know any other regeneration. But I marveled that they did not know
what regeneration is, when, nevertheless, writers and preachers so often
state that the old man must be slain in order that the new may exist and
concupiscences in like manner, that man may have new life - and the
like; which involve regeneration. Hence, also, I believed that they
understood what regeneration is; but, inasmuch as they did not
understand what regeneration is, they therefore invented justification,
about which they say similar things, but with all kinds of differences;
for example: that evils are not imputed to him who is justified; thus,
that he lives sinlessly, though he live in evils like any other man. The
reason they did not know, is, because they insisted that man is
regenerated by the truths of faith, consequently by faith alone, and not
by the life of faith, which is charity; and, since they did not wish to
know what the life of faith, which is charity, is, and did not make it a
means of salvation; since, also, they did not know what spiritual love
and affection are, nor, therefore, what it is to be led by the Lord;
therefore, they were in such ignorance about the very essential of
salvation, and for this reason devised justification, and cherished such
an opinion about it, as, that, when a man is justified evils are not
imputed. From this the quality of the Church is manifest. What
regeneration is may be seen in the Heavenly Doctrine. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[5740-1](#fn_278.md)

<span class="margnote"><span id="5741.">5741.</span></span>

IT IS NOT KNOWN WHAT REGENERATION IS. Many of the learned theologians
were explored, in the other life, as to whether they knew what
regeneration is, but no one of them knew. Most of them said, To be born
anew through water and the Spirit, - by which they understood baptism;
some called it justification; and I was exceedingly surprised that the
more learned in the world did not understand this matter, which,
nevertheless, is such an essential of the Church that no one can enter
into heaven except he be born anew, according to the Lord's words in
John, chapter 3. I was exceedingly astonished that they were unaware of
this; when nevertheless, the majority know from the Word how to describe
regeneration, so that it appears that they know it thoroughly: as, for
example, that the old man with his concupiscences must be slain, and the
new must arise; and that in the new life he will walk before in white
garments, and will see evils, and other like things; by which he who
knows what regeneration is, if he is able to look no farther than to the
words, believes that they must know what regeneration is: but they did
not then say these things. It was asked whence it happens that they do
not know what regeneration is; and it was ascertained that they do not
know what charity towards the neighbor is, or, consequently, what the
good of life is; and, inasmuch as they believe the good of life, or
charity, not to be an essential of salvation, but only faith alone, even
though a man were destitute of good of life; and that through faith
alone, from mere mercy, heaven is given to those for whom the Lord
intercedes; - inasmuch as this is perpetually in their minds, therefore,
they can yet in no wise know what regeneration is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5742.">5742.</span></span>

THE LAST JUDGMENT AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD HEAVEN AND EARTH. The
vastation previously described lasted for many days; and at length there
appeared as it were a hand stretched out by the Lord over the heavens,
and then began that battle between Michael and the Dragon which is
described in the Apocalypse. <span id="fr_279"></span>[5742-1](#fn_279.md)
On the western side, towards the north, there appeared as it were a
combat, \[reaching\] from the elevation thence, towards the heavens
which were above the middle-which were very numerous, and where were
vast numbers of angels not known to me before. They could be counted by
myriads. In that entrance, were dragonists; and they spoke with those
\[in these old heavens\], and all then turned to them and listened to
what they said. The heavenly doctrine, especially concerning the Lord,
was then impugned by the Dragonists; and then everyone who heard was
reduced to the state of his thought about the Lord, in which he was in
the world; and it was then manifested, that most of them rejected the
Lord's Divinity, saying that they did not wish to know anything about a
visible God, but about the invisible. It was said to them that the Lord
is also the invisible God; for He is one with the Father, and is in the
sun \[of heaven\], and has been invisible in the world since His
ascension from the sepulchre, and many more things from the Word. But
they were all unwilling \[to accept\] this. Moreover, inquiry was made
as to whether they placed anything of salvation in the life of faith;
but they said, Nothing; only in faith: thus, in thinking alone, and
nothing in willing and doing, that is, living. In a word, they were
turned to all the quarters, and their quality searched out. And it was
also said to them that they were dragonist spirits who urged these
things, and to whom they give assent, and that the Lord teaches
otherwise; but all in vain. This proceeded through all the heavens which
had been gathered together since the Lord's advent, and all in them who
were of such a quality as has been stated, were, after a tremendous
battle, sentenced to be cast down; but, still, they insisted that they
would remain there, because they have been there so long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5743.">5743.</span></span>

Wherefore, the Lord was seen to descend out of the Sun, as it were in a
bright cloud, to the heights, and gave judgment that all of such a
character should be cast down. And when He withdrew into the Sun, they
were also driven out, and this for a great length of time, successively,
according to their connection with heaven; and, as to the larger part,
they were thrust down into the western quarter, where the number was so
great that it could not be reduced to computation except by taking
hundreds of thousands as one. But \[I am unable\] to describe all and
every one of the incidents of the battle, which was a temptation, and,
indeed, the most grievous of all temptations, continuing almost to
despair. The Lord held them in truth, but the devil in falsity:
consequently, they were as if in internal collision; by which,
also, <span id="fr_280"></span>[5743-1](#fn_280.md) it could be evident of
what kind the Lord's temptations were in the world, when He admitted the
hells to Himself; and of what kind the last, of the Cross - respecting
which it can only be said that they were unspeakable; nor could they be
comprehended, or imagined, by any man. It was said that the Lord
sustained them from earliest youth right up to the end of His life, and
that He thus subdued the hells, and reduced the heavens and all things
\[in them\] into order; also, that He, at the same time, glorified His
Human; - without which things, no mortal could be saved.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5744.">5744.</span></span>

The whole western quarter was full of such ones as had been cast down
from the heavens on every side; and the earth there opened itself, and
they were enveloped in a cloud so that they could not rise up any more.
They were all such as did indeed acknowledge a God, and live morally
well, but only thought of the Lord as of an ordinary man like
themselves; nor did they do good on account of God and because it is
enjoined in the Word, but for the sake of self and the world; neither
did they abstain from thinking and willing evil but only from doing
evil, for fear of the law, of their life, of reputation, of honor and
gain: who, in a word, whatever they did, did it for the sake of self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5745.">5745.</span></span>

In the beginning, in \[the "old"\] heaven, all were picked out who had
lived well, consequently, in the acknowledgment of the Lord, and were in
a good life for His sake and that of the Divine Commandments; but,
because these were few and the heavens immense, therefore many others
were admitted, and, at length, all who have lived morally well.
Happiness, also, was given them, and all things in abundance, so that
nothing was lacking; and, at length, they began to admit others on the
ground of mere piety, if only they simulated devotions, and likewise
such as in externals only appeared upright and devout, though in
internals they were most wicked. Angels, also, were sent to them by the
Lord, who exhibited such things to them, but in vain. Wherefore, in
proportion as the multitude of such a kind increased, so their interiors
were at first opened, and they yielded themselves to them; but all the
good were taken out thence and concealed in different places. These,
afterwards, composed the new heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5746.">5746.</span></span>

Thus perished the old heaven and the old earth; and all those were cast
into hell who did not live the life of faith, which is charity. These
are also called the he-goats, who were on the left hand; none of whom
bestowed anything from internal charity, but only on account of what is
external. These things lasted from the 31st of March to the 11th of
April, when it was the feast of Easter, 1757.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5747.">5747.</span></span>

Those are all called Michael, who fought for the Lord's Divinity, and
\[for the truth\] that He and the Father were one, and thus that God is
one, and who fought on behalf of the life which is called the life of
faith or charity. For those who do not acknowledge the Lord's Divinity,
all, in heart, make nothing of spiritual things, or those which belong
to heaven. They talk about God, but do not care for Him; they go over to
any opinion whatever of some evil \[spirit\]; principally, at the first
temptation. Those who were Michael were chiefly from the ancient
heavens, who all remained steadfast; also of those who were among them
from the gentiles, and from infants everywhere at that time grown up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5748.">5748.</span></span>

The western quarter, from the northern angle as far as to the fore-part
of the southern \[portion\], was filled with these who were cast down;
some, also, were elsewhere. The dragonists, however, proceeded out of a
line from the southern \[portion\], which we have before spoken - into
the rear of the western \[part\], as far as towards the north, in a
curved line resembling a tail; but in the darkness there beneath that
region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5749.">5749.</span></span>

In a word, the heavens which were collected from the Christian world
after the Advent of the Lord, successively declined, as is customary on
earth. At first, those in them procured heaven in themselves and
worshipped the Lord, and thus also had heaven without themselves; thus,
it was in its proper order. But, successively, the heaven in them began
to be overshadowed and at length to be dispersed; and then they wanted
to have the heaven which they knew, outside themselves; and they called
this heaven, and then there was no longer any internal. It was also
permitted them to have heaven outside themselves; and this consisted in
amazing magnificence which was indescribable, in palaces, in colonnades,
in galleries, in embellishments, in paradises, also in dignities and the
like; and also in grandeur from multitudes of servants; thus, in dignity
alone, and in external self-worship for the sake of these things. At
length, when they were not able to have such things from the Lord,
because they regarded themselves and not the Lord, from Whom those
things were, they provided them for themselves, through phantasies and
arts unknown in the world - which are innumerable. Thus they went on
incessantly; not that those who were of the first resurrection were
such, but those who \[came\] afterwards for as these came into heaven,
the Lord, of Divine Providence, removed the former ones, or secreted
them there, so that they should not be seen; wherefore, when they placed
all things in nothing else than external splendors and pleasures, then,
at last, this judgment came which has been spoken of.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5750.">5750.</span></span>

Meanwhile, purifications were occurring continually; for those who in
the world led an evil life, in adulteries and thefts - thus wicked
atheists - were not admitted, but were cast into hell. The purification
from such ones went on continuously; but yet the case is as with the
blood in the body although that is continually purified, still, it
tends, notwithstanding, to the death of the whole body. Hence there is
now a new heaven.
