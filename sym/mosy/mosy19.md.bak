### ADDENDA.

<span class="smallcaps">Chap.</span> II. § 1.—The slab found at Huy on
the Meuse representing a priest whose vestments are adorned with
*gammadions* has an equivalent in the Musée de Cluny, at Paris, where an
Abbot of Cluny, who died in 1394, is figured on his tombstone as wearing
sacerdotal robes ornamented with *gammadions* in the same manner.

<span class="smallcaps">Chap.</span> III.—In the *Correspondenzblatt der
Westdeutschen Zeitschrift*, 1892, p. 179 seq., Mr. Ohlenschläger speaks
of a bas-relief in the cathedral of Spires which recalls the group of
Sampson killing the lion in the cathedral of Nivelles, with the same
Mithraic affinities.

<span class="smallcaps">Chap.</span> IV. and *seq*.—I have received, too
late to take advantage of it, Dr. Bonavia's recent book, *The Flora of
the Assyrian Monuments and its Outcome* (1 vol., London, Archibald
Constable and Co., 1894), which deals with many questions treated in
this volume. Ingenious and suggestive as his views are, I see nothing in
them to alter my general conclusions.

For instance, he insists, still more than I do, on the importance of the
Horn symbol in Assyrian worship—going so far as to qualify their whole
religion by the picturesque term of *hornism!* He has made a strong
case, when he looked to this symbol as an antecedent to the Caduceus,
the *fleur-de-lys*, the anthemion or palmette, the Ionian

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

volutes, the Horseshoe, the Crescent, the Thunderbolt, the *trisula*,
certain Keys of Life and so forth. I am ready to admit that in shaping
the fork or Trident of their storm gods the Assyrians have been
influenced by their habitual way of representing conventionally the
Sacred Tree adorned with the symbolical Horns. But does not the learned
author go too far, when he infers that this weapon in the hands of the
god is meant for a pair of horns mounted on a stem and, therefore, that
the thunderbolt originally represented only a double pair of horns with
the sacred stem in the middle?

There would be nothing surprising if the Assyrians had symbolized
lightning by a pair of horns, although this remains a supposition so
long as not confirmed by some text. One could understand a description
or representation of the storm god as a mighty bull, or even as a horned
man striking his victims with the head. But when we see this
supernatural being, whether horned or not, holding in his hand a bident
or a trident, there is no need to go further and to take this weapon for
anything else than what it appears to be—a spear or javelin with several
points.

But Dr. Bonavia goes still further and contends that it may not be at
all a representation of lightning, simply a *hornstick*, a charm against
the evil eye in the hands of a protecting deity. To this, without
entering into details, I shall answer, firstly, that according to all
Assyriologists, this kind of Trident is essentially the attribute of
Rammanu, the god of the atmosphere and therefore of the storm; secondly,
that there is a text where lightning is described as a weapon with
several heads (W. A. I., ii., 19, trad. Sayce); thirdly, that there
exists on Assyrian monuments a gradual and unmistakable transition—as
shown in this book and by Dr. Bonavia's own illustrations—between his

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "horned stick" and
what became the Thunderbolt of the Greeks, without any apparent break of
continuity in the meaning of the symbol. If somebody alleges that such
break remains possible, with him lies the *onus probandi*.
