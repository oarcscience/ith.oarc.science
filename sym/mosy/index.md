This is a study of the migration and mutation of symbols by a late 19th
century Belgian lawyer and [Masonic](../../mas/index.md) scholar, Count
Goblet d'Alviella (*b*. 1846, *d*. 1925). Originally published in 1891
in French, this book covers a huge web of interchangeable symbols, which
are found over a wide range of cultures through the Near East, India,
Europe, and further abroad, notably in Mesoamerica. He attempts to
explain the widespread use of symbols such as the Swastika, the Tree of
Life, the Winged Globe, the Trident and the Caduceus. Despite the title,
d'Alviella does not adhere to one theory; instead he has a whole
toolkit, including diffusion, mutation, independent origins and
appropriation, as well as psychological, historical and sociological
explanations.

He demonstrates that the same symbol can have different interpretations
in different cultures and at different times. Such is the case with the
swastika, which today is obviously associated with absolute evil, but
which has been used historically as a symbol of the Sun's yearly path,
and regarded as a good-luck symbol, even to this day, in the far East.
With over 150 line illustrations, this book is an invaluable source book
for symbologists, and makes fascinating reading for readers interested
in the development of religion.
