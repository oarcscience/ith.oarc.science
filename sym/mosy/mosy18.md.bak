*The Migration of Symbols*, by Goblet d'Alviella, \[1894\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CONCLUSION.

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> most of the instances which I have
here quoted it is easy to discover through what ways the specified
symbol was transmitted from one nation to another. In this respect the
migration of symbols proceeds directly in conformity with what may be
called the history of commercial intercourse. Whatever the similarity of
form, and even of meaning, may be between two symbolic figures of
different origin, it is proper, ere we assert their relationship, to
show the probability, or at least the possibility, of international
relations which would have served as a vehicle of transport. This point
once set at rest, it remains to be seen who was the giver and who the
receiver.

It may be asked, for instance, why it is not the Greeks who communicated
the Thunderbolt to Mesopotamia, or the Hindus who transmitted the

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lotus to the
Egyptians? It is here especially that the advantages we possess over
preceding generations come into play. There was a time when the origin
of the gods, myths, and symbols spread over the whole surface of the Old
World could be vaguely located in India; and another, when it would have
been rash not to ascribe to Greece the honour of all intellectual and
religious creations possessing any moral or artistic value. But the
researches carried on for the last half century have henceforth placed
on a definite basis the ancient history of the East, and the latter, in
its turn, has enabled us to assign their relative distance to the
principal centres of artistic culture which have reacted upon one
another since the beginnings of civilization.

We may differ in opinion as to whether the Ionic column borrowed its
volutes from the horns of the ibex, or the half-closed petals of the
lotus. We may even argue whether Ionia received it directly from Golgos
by the ships of the Phœnicians, or from Pterium, by the caravans of Asia
Minor. But whoever has noted its presence on the monuments of Khorsabad,
or of Kouyunjik, will not refuse to locate in Mesopotamia its
starting-place on its journey to the Ægean Sea. This is only one example
of those types and motives whose development doubtlessly owed its
importance to the independent inspirations of Greek genius, but whose
origins must nevertheless be sought for in Phrygia, in Lycia, in
Phœnicia, and even beyond these countries, in the valleys of the Tigris,
the Euphrates, and the Nile. In India likewise the most ancient products
of sculpture and of carving, when they do not bear witness to the direct
influence of Greek art—as in the Buddhist bas-reliefs of Yusufzai, and
the Bacchanalian scenes of Mathura—are connected with the monuments of
Persia through the adoption of what

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

might be called classic motives in Persepolitan architecture: such are
those capitals formed by animals, sometimes face to face, sometimes back
to back, which are, as it were, a plastic signature, in the former case
of Assyria, in the latter of Egypt.

I am far from denying that there arose among some nations independent
and self-governing centres of artistic creation. In this respect it will
be. sufficient to make mention of China and pre-Columbian America. But
it must be admitted that art in the extreme East was profoundly modified
through the influence of the Buddhist types which proceeded directly
from India. We might even take into account a still older element which
would directly connect the art, as also the religion, of the Chinese
empire with the development of Mesopotamian civilization, if, as is
assumed by M. Terrien de la Couperie, who has brought together a
considerable amount of presumptive evidence in support of this theory,
the ancestors of the Chinese were descended from the nation which
occupied Chaldæa and Elam some three and twenty centuries before our
era. <span id="fr_506"></span>[1](#fn_506.md) At any rate, it would be
astonishing if, in the course of so many centuries, infiltrations had
not occurred between the civilizations which were developing in this
parallel manner on the Asiatic continent.

As for ancient America, Gustave d’Eichthal had already called attention
to the similarities which are met with on the monuments of Central
America and of Buddhist Asia. For myself, I am more and more inclined to
admit, not the Asiatic origin of the inhabitants of America, which is
quite another question, but the intervention of certain artistic
influences radiated from China,

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Japan, or the
Indian Archipelago, to the shores of the New World, long before the
Spanish conquest.

In short, whether we start from Japan, from Greece, from India, or even
from Libya, from Etruria, or from Gaul, we always arrive, after many
halting-places, at two great centres of artistic diffusion, partially
irreducible as regards one another, Egypt and Chaldæa—with this
difference, that, towards the eighth century before our era, Mesopotamia
took lessons from Egypt, whilst Egypt learnt little of any country. Now,
as we have noted more than once in the present volume, not only did
symbols follow the same paths as purely ornamental schemes, but they
were also transmitted in the same manner, at the same periods, and in
nearly the same proportion. Concerning symbols as well as artistic
products we everywhere find, by the side of aboriginal types, the
deposit of a powerful current which has its more or less distant origin
in the symbolism of the banks of the Euphrates, or the Nile. In a word,
the two classes of importations are joined together to such a degree,
that in writing the history of art we write to a great extent the
history of symbols, or at least, of their migrations.

 

The knowledge of these migrations, in its turn, throws quite a new light
not only upon the presence of the same emblems among nations who never
professed the same creed, but also upon the formation of certain complex
images which cannot be accounted for save as the result of a reciprocal
action between symbols often differing greatly in origin and in meaning.
Through thus always finding, often among nations far apart, either the
same symbolic combinations, or the same features in different
combinations, we might be tempted to believe that symbolism had at its
disposal only an

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

extremely limited number of signs and figures to provide for the plastic
requirements of the religious sentiment.

Need I add that this is not so? The variety of symbolic representations
has no more limits than the spirit of analogy. But certain figures, when
once formed, have so captivated the eye and the imagination that they
have become the commonplaces of figurative language, and the artist's
hand could not free itself from their influence when engaged in
producing new symbols. It is equally easy to understand that, having
forgotten, or having never known, the meaning to be attached to a
foreign pattern, the copyist should have attempted to connect his
productions with some other known and popular type. At other times,
again, the symbolic syncretism is intentional and premeditated; whether
it be in the desire to unite, for the sake of greater efficacy, the
attributes of several divinities in a single figure, as is shown in
certain pantheistic figures of Gnostic origin; or a wish to state, by
the fusion of symbols, the unity of the gods and the identity of creeds,
as in the mystic monogram wherein the Brahmaists of contemporary India
have testified to their religious eclecticism by interweaving the *Om*
of the Hindus with the Trident, the Crescent, and the Cross. <span
id="fr_507"></span>[1](#fn_507.md)

Sometimes, too, the sacerdotal interest must have tended towards
accentuating the analogies rather than the dissimilarities of symbols,
in order to assist the absorption or unification of the doctrines which
they represented. Finally, we must take into consideration the popular
tendency towards syncretism which, when not held in check by a rigorous
orthodoxy, acts upon symbols, as well as upon creeds, by introducing
into the new form of worship the images consecrated by a long

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

veneration. Or else it is the innovators themselves who take advantage
of symbolism in order to disguise, through borrowing from antique forms,
the newness of their doctrine and, if need be, to transform into allies
the emblems, or traditions, which they are unable to boldly extirpate.

Need I recall to mind Constantine choosing as a standard that *labarum*
which might be claimed both by the religion of Christ and the worship of
the sun? It is singular to find the same policy attributed to the first
Christian king of Norway. According to an old song of the Shetland
Islands, Hakon Adalsteinfostri, obliged to drink to Odin at an official
banquet, traced quickly upon the bowl the sign of the Cross; and when
his companions reproached him for doing so, he told them that it was the
sign of Thor's Hammer. <span id="fr_508"></span>[1](#fn_508.md) We know,
indeed, that in Germanic and Scandinavian countries the Cross of Christ
more than once drew near in appearance to the Two-headed Hammer of Thor,
as in Egypt it assumed, in more than one inscription, the aspect of the
Key of Life. <span id="fr_509"></span>[2](#fn_509.md)

Buddhism was even less scrupulous. In some of its sanctuaries it did not
hesitate to preserve the images of the worship paid by the natives of
India to the sun, to fire, or to serpents, whilst ascribing these rites
to its own traditions. The solar Wheel thus became easily the Wheel of
the Law; the Cosmic Tree represented the Tree of Knowledge, under which
Sakya Muni attained the perfect illumination; the Seven-headed Serpent

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Naga was
transformed into the guardian of the impression left by the Feet of
Vishnu, itself to be attributed henceforth to Buddha, and so on. Some
years ago there were discovered at Bharhut the remains of a Buddhist
sanctuary whose bas-reliefs exhibited emblems and religious scenes with
inscriptions which served as their legends, or rather as their labels.
Great was the joy of Anglo-Indian archæologists at the receipt of this
intelligence. We were to have at last an interpretation of Buddhist
rites and symbols, formulated by the Buddhists themselves one or two
centuries before our era. We had unfortunately to lower our expectations
when a minute investigation showed that it was merely an ancient temple
of the sun taken possession of by the Buddhists at a later date. They
had contented themselves with placing on the figured representations of
the solar worship inscriptions which connected them with their own
creed. <span id="fr_510"></span>[1](#fn_510.md)

 

Some have gone as far as to say that religions changed, but that the
form of worship remained always the same. Thus formulated the
proposition is too absolute. But it is certain that each religion
preserves, in its rites and symbols, survivals of the whole series of
former religions. And no complaint need be made of this. It is not the
vessel that is important, but the wine which we pour into it; not the
form, but the ideas which animate and transcend that form.

When the Christians and the Buddhists concentrated on the image of their
respective Masters the principal attributes of the sun—beginning with
that halo of glory whose prototype dates back to the Aureoles carved
upon the Chaldæan monuments—did they mean to do homage to the orb of
day?

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In reality, they
only claimed to refer to the venerated physiognomy of their founder the
symbol which has not only formed from time immemorial the most radiant
expression of celestial glory, but which also characterized, in an
especial manner, the highest personification of the Divinity in
contemporary creeds. We must call to mind the reply of a Father of the
Church to those who accused the Christians of celebrating the festival
of the sun:—"We solemnize this day, not, like the heathen, on account of
the sun, but on account of Him who made the sun." <span
id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_511.md) Constantine went further still when he
composed, to be recited on Sundays by his legions, a prayer which,
according to M. V. Duruy, could at once satisfy the worshippers of
Mithras, of Serapis, of the sun, and of Christ. <span
id="fr_512"></span>[2](#fn_512.md)

Symbolism may combine with the most mystical tendencies, but, like
mysticism itself, it is a powerful ally of the religious sentiment
against the immobility of dogma, and the tyranny of the written Word. M.
Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu has shown, in his valuable researches into
religion in Russia, how, thanks to the symbolic interpretation of texts
and ceremonies, the conservative ritualism of the Old Believers has
managed to arrive at the liberty of doctrines, and even, in some
instances, at a complete rationalism, without breaking with the
traditional symbols of Christianity, and even of the Eastern
Church. <span id="fr_513"></span>[3](#fn_513.md)

There comes a time when religions which deal largely with the
supernatural come into collision with the progress of the different
branches of knowledge, and above all with the growing belief

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

in a rational order of the universe. Symbolism then offers them a means
of safety, of which they have more than once taken advantage, in order
to keep abreast of the times. If we take nations in a lower stage of
development, we find among them fetiches—*i.e.*, beings and objects
invested at pleasure with superhuman faculties—then idols, which are
fetiches carved to resemble a human being or animal. But we do not find
any symbols as long as there is neither the desire to depict what is
abstract by what is concrete, nor the consciousness that there is no
identity between the symbol and the reality thus represented. When the
mind opens itself to the conception of abstract or invisible gods, it
may preserve its veneration for its ancient *fetiches*, but under the
condition of looking upon them henceforth as but representative signs of
the divinities. Lastly, when people can conceive of a supreme God of
whom the ancient divinities are simply the ministers, or the hypostases,
these antique representations may yet have a part to play, provided
however that they be referred to the perfections and attributes of the
superior Being in whom the Divine World is resolved.

 

Such is the evolution observable in the midst of all the ancient
worships, and which still continues, often unconsciously, in many a
contemporary religion. It implies, as a last conclusion, the belief in
the equivalence of symbols, that is to say, the conviction that symbolic
representations are all inadequate, inasmuch as they attempt to explain
the inexplicable, but that they are all justifiable, inasmuch as they
aim at bringing us closer to the Supreme Reality; and, moreover, that
they are all beneficial in so far as they contribute to awaken ideas of
the Good and of the Beautiful. In this respect the functions of
symbolism cannot but increase; for, in religion, as in art and
literature, it

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

corresponds with a necessity of the human mind, which, very fortunately
for our æsthetic development, has never been able to content itself with
pure abstractions, nor remain at the surface of things. Here, indeed, is
the secret of the impulse which increasingly moves the new generations
to break with the commonplace conventions of superannuated traditions,
as also with the superficial platitudes of a false realism.
