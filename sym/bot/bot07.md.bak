<span class="smallcaps">Illustration</span> No. 24, [Plate
II](bot06.htm#img_pl02.md) is a Talisman for Wisdom and Perseverance, and
is of great power amongst the Hindus; the circle is indicative of
infinity, the border of triangles signifies that all nature is subject
to the laws of the Trinity, Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva; the serpent is the
symbol of Wisdom and Perseverance, and indicates that without these
attributes the revelation of the higher truths cannot be attained. The
seven-knotted Bamboo represents the seven degrees of power of invocation
which Initiates must acquire.

<span class="smallcaps">Impressions of Buddha's Footprints</span>,
another very popular Talisman (see Illustration No. 25, [Plate
II](bot06.htm#img_pl02).md), are to be met with not only in the form of
personal ornaments, but in gigantic proportions of which an example may
be seen at the British Museum, beautifully carved and ornamented with

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

numerous sacred emblems. The most celebrated "footprint" is on Adam's
Peak, near Colombo, which attracts from all countries pilgrims who have
adopted the religion of Buddha, Mohammed, or the Hindu gods, each
claiming it as the Impression of their respective Deities.

Sir Gardiner Williamson says that the Mohammedans of Egypt show a
footprint of the Prophet which gives the name to a village on the banks
of the Nile—Attar a Nebbee. Herodotus mentions the impression of the
foot of Hercules, two cubits in length, on a rock near the bank of the
River Tyras, in Scythia. In Italy, tablets dedicated to Isis have been
found. From this we gather that this practice of carving footprints on
rocks and stone is one which dates from the remote Bronze Age, and that
the area over which they are found embraces the whole world.

In Thibet, the Lamaist Sceptre, or Dorje, the thunderbolt of Indra, is
greatly valued as a Talisman (see Illustration No. 26, [Plate
II](bot06.htm#img_pl02).md) . This symbol is prized as a Talisman against
Demons, and to bring fruitfulness. Indra, as the deity of the
atmosphere, governs the weather and dispenses the rain, sending forth
lightnings and thunder against Ahi the demon of drought, whom he
overcomes with his thunderbolt, compelling him to pour down the
fertilising showers.

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Knots</span> are used in India and Thibet as
Talismans for Longevity and to avert the Evil Eye (see Illustration No.
27, [Plate II](bot06.htm#img_pl02).md), the Knot being considered potent to
bind that which is good and precious, and to prove an obstacle or
hindrance to that which is evil; for instance, at the time of marriage
knots are lucky, and the ceremonies connected with a Chinese marriage
include knotted red and green ribbons, which are held by the newly
wedded pair, the bride holding the green ribbon whilst the bridegroom
seizes the red; and in our own country the true-lover's knot is
frequently used in the decoration of the wedding dress; but at
childbirth and death, there must be no knots about the person to hamper
the coming or going of the spirit.

<span class="smallcaps">Chinese Talismans</span>. The origin of the
ancient religion of China is unknown, and the faith has been handed down
from generation to generation from periods many centuries <span
class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> It is based on the belief that the
Universe was ruled by Divinities arranged in three groups, one ruling
the heavens, the second the earth, (having dominion over mountains,)
streams, and vegetation, and the third ruling the affairs of mankind.
Illustration No. 21, [Plate I](bot05.htm#img_pl01.md) is a Talisman that
had its origin at this period, and was given to the Emperor Fu-hsi, the
founder of the Chinese

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Empire, by a
mystical dragon horse which rose from the waters of the Yellow River
about 2800 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> These Trigrams, known as
Pa-kwa, formed the basis of the written characters introduced by this
wise Emperor. They are familiar to all Chinese, being worn as a Talisman
for long life and to ward off evil influences. The Talisman is made of
all sizes and shapes, from large ones on boards, one or two feet square,
down to tiny medals for personal wear, no larger than a sixpence. It is
also frequently used in circular form, as shown in the central part of
the Bat Talisman (No. 20, [Plate I](bot05.htm#img_pl01).md), and is known
as Tho, the symbol of longevity. The Pa-kwa Trigrams are based upon the
ancient theory of the Yang Yin, or two first causes, indicated by the
circular figure divided by a spiral line in the centre of the Talisman
into two equal gadroons, which represent the Creative principle in its
masculine and feminine manifestations; the active principle being Yang,
and the passive Yin. This symbol also represents Heaven and Earth, Sun
and Moon, Light and Darkness, and everything that is in contrast, or
positive and negative.

The whole lines in the figures are described as strong in contrast to
the short-divided lines, which are weak, the whole representing the two
forms of subtle matter which forms the composition

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

of all things. This Talisman is also a favourite in Japan and Thibet.

Confucianism, advocating the fulfilment of all duties to the utmost of
one's power, in accordance with the position in life, socially and
officially, ranging from the love of the child for his father to the
Emperor's responsibility for his people's welfare, is still firmly
believed in at the present time; and the Talisman of the five bats, the
Weefuh, is for the five great happinesses that all men desire, Luck,
Wealth, Longevity, Health, and Peace. The five bats are frequently used
alone, but sometimes, as in Illustration No. 20, [Plate
I](bot05.htm#img_pl01.md), the Trigrams, or some other symbol, is used in
conjunction.

Two Bats signify good wishes; a Goose is depicted as a Talisman for
domestic felicity, and a Deer for success and honour in study; a Stork,
or Pine Tree, and a fabulous Peach which takes a thousand years in
ripening, for longevity and good fortune. Another graceful way of
wishing a guest good luck is to depict one of these symbols, or a lucky
sentence, at the bottom of his tea-cup, such as "May your happiness know
no bounds," enclosed by a border of the five bats.

<span class="smallcaps">The Phœnix</span>, like the bird Feng, is a
mystical bird said to live 500 or 600 years and then to build for itself
in the desert a funeral pyre of dried grasses

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

and sweet spices. To this it sets fire by fluttering its wings whilst
hovering over it, is then consumed, but from the ashes it rises again
renewed in youth and in its gorgeous plumage; an idea appropriated by
old-established fire insurance offices, the symbol of which is familiar
to all.

The Phœnix is believed by the Chinese to uphold their Empire and preside
over its destiny; it is also worn as a Talisman for Longevity and
Conjugal Happiness; whilst in the mystic sense it typifies the- whole
world, its head the heavens, its eyes the Sun, its beak the Moon, its
wings the wind, its feet the earth, and its tail the trees and plants.

To the Japanese the Phœnix, or <span class="smallcaps">ho-wo</span>
bird, is a Talisman for Rectitude, Obedience, Fidelity, Justice, and
Benevolence, and they consider it a manifestation of the Sun, its
appearance on earth being considered a portent of great events. The
<span class="smallcaps">torii</span>, a kind of gate elaborately carved
and decorated at the entrances of Shinto temples, is erected for the
Phœnix to perch upon should it visit the earth (see Illustration No. 40,
[Plate III](#img_pl03).md). This fabled bird has also played a conspicuous
part in British and foreign heraldry.

<span class="smallcaps">The Dragon</span> is symbolical of everything
imposing and terrible, and forms the Imperial coat-of-arms;

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

the Emperor's throne being called the Dragon One.

There are three forms of Dragon—the "*Lung*," or sky dragon, the "*Li*,"
which lives in the sea, and the "*Kiao*," which inhabits the marshes.
The dragon is worn for Longevity and Domestic Felicity (see Illustration
No. 38, [Plate III](#img_pl03).md).

The type of the Dragon was thought to have been the boa-constrictor,
until the researches of geology brought to light in the iguanodon such a
near counterpart of the dragon that this is now regarded as more
probably its prototype. The Lung is represented as a dragon-headed horse
which carries on its back the book of the Law. It is very popular in
Thibet, where it is known as the Wind Horse; but the Lamas have
substituted for the book of the Law the emblems of the three gems (see
Illustration No. 31, "Plate II"}), which include the Buddhist Law, and
is thus worn by the Thibetans to bring material gain, wealth, and good
luck; in this form it is painted on luck-bringing flags, which are hung
from the ridges of the houses and in the vicinity of dwellings. The
all-potent horse-shoe is not used by the Chinese, but the hoof of a
horse has to them the same preservative virtue as the horse-shoe with
us. Another charm extensively used in China amongst women, is a small
gold or silver triangle bearing two swords

<span id="img_pl03"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![PLATE 3. CHINESE
AND JAPANESE TALISMANS](tn/pl03.jpg)

PLATE 3. CHINESE AND JAPANESE TALISMANS  
</span>

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

suspended from the outer angles, and a trident from the centre of the
base; on the triangles lucky characters frequently appear (see
Illustration No. 39, [Plate III](#img_pl03).md). This is undoubtedly an
imported Hindu Talisman of Siva, who is regarded as the Regenerator and
Controller of reproductive power; and in addition to the acquirement of
these qualities, this Talisman is worn for protection against Ghosts and
Goblins who are under the control of Siva, and written charms of
triangular shape are frequently made for this purpose.

<span class="smallcaps">The Money Sword</span> is regarded as
all-powerful against ill-luck to the house and against the machinations
of evil spirits, and it attracts cash to its fortunate possessor when
suspended from right to left above the head of his bed. This Cash Sword
is composed of two iron rods along which a quantity of coins, having
holes in the centre, are tied with red silk, making a potent charm which
is very popular (see Illustration No. 44, [Plate III](#img_pl03).md).

For talismanic purposes, Red is indispensable in China. It is interwoven
with the pig-tail, and must form a part of children's clothing. Written
charms must also be in red ink on yellow paper to be efficacious against
the multitudinous ill-omens and evil spirits which seem to surround the
Chinaman, and for this reason all Imperial decrees are written in
vermilion. One of the commonest

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

amulets worn by an only son is a small silver lock (see Illustration No.
45, [Plate III](#img_pl03).md). The father collects coins from about a
hundred different heads of families and has them exchanged for silver,
which is converted into a native padlock used to fasten a silver chain
round the boy's neck; this it is believed will preserve him from evil
spirits, lock him to life, and contribute to his health and longevity.

Bells are also worn by Chinese children to avert the Evil Eye and
preserve the teeth.

<span class="smallcaps">The Tortoise</span> is regarded as a symbol of
the Universe in China, Japan, and India, its dome-shaped back
representing the vault of the sky, its belly the earth which moves upon
the waters, whilst the great age to which it attains and the endurance
and strength of its shell make it a fitting emblem of the longevity for
which it is worn as a Talisman. It also repels black magic.

It represents the feminine principle in Nature and, as such, it
penetrated to the West, so that in Greek and Roman art Aphrodite and
Venus are frequently found associated with the Tortoise, whose virtues
or gifts were said by Pliny to number sixty-six (see Illustration No.
36, [Plate III](#img_pl03).md).

<span class="smallcaps">The Tiger</span> is the god of the gambler in
China, and a tiger's tooth is regarded as a Talisman for

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

good luck in speculation and in games of chance; whilst the claws and
whiskers are worn as love charms, and for success and good fortune
generally.

<span class="smallcaps">Pigs</span> are also considered lucky; and
luck-bringers in the shape of little pigs made of gold and silk are worn
to attract fortune's favours, but the black cat, which in our own
country is regarded as a mascot, is not favoured by the Chinese, who
believe it to be a harbinger of poverty, misfortune, and sickness.
