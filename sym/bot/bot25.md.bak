<span class="smallcaps">Capricorn</span>, the tenth sign of the Zodiac,
is situated in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, the constellation
being composed of fifty-one visible stars known to ancient Oriental
nations as the southern gate of the Sun, because its entry into this
sign on December 22nd marks the shortest day and the commencement of the
winter solstice, when the Sun is farthest south of the Equator, after
which its light slowly increases and correspondingly the days become
slightly longer.

The Sun occupies this House until January 19th approximately, and as its
Latin name, *Capricornus*, signifies, is symbolised by a Goat, as
illustrated in No. 10 of the coloured
[Frontispiece](bot00.htm#img_front.md). Saturn is the

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

ruling planet of this House, and as he is sometimes depicted as an old
man with a scythe (literally Old Father Time familiar to every one),
this may explain the ancient Akkadian name for this month, <span
class="smallcaps">Abba-uddu</span>, meaning Old Father; and as the Greek
words signifying both Time and Saturn differ only in one letter, in all
probability the two may have been regarded as synonymous.

The Cornucopia, or Horn of Plenty, was also used as a symbol of this
House, as in Ancient Mythology Saturn is believed to have introduced
civilisation and the arts of husbandry, so that, as described by Virgil—

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

<span class="small">"With his mild empire peace and plenty came;  
 And hence the golden Times derived their name,"</span>

</div>

the increasing length of the days promising a bountiful future.

Very frequently the Goat is shown with a fish's body joined to the
shoulders, which is explained in classical literature as the result of
an adventure of the god Pan. This deity, who was considered by the
Greeks to symbolise the House, whilst feasting with other gods on the
banks of the Nile was attacked by the monster Typhon. In order to escape
Pan and his friends plunged into the river, assuming different shapes,
Pan taking the form of a fish for the lower half of his body,

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

and the head, shoulders, and forelegs of a goat for the other half.

The symbol of the Goat climbing a rocky eminence (as shown in the
[illustration](bot00.htm#img_front).md), is very appropriate to
well-developed subjects born under the influence of Capricorn who seem
for ever persistently and patiently climbing upwards, and who are
capable of great resistance in overcoming obstacles in the way, their
dauntless energy and courage in facing difficulties reminding us of the
goats kept by the owners of the great cattle ranches in Mexico, on
account of their superior courage and intelligence to sheep, and who, if
the latter are in danger of an attack by wolves, will face the foes,
showing fight and fearlessness, collecting the sheep round them, and
thus preventing a stampede, making their protection easier by the
herdsmen.

Capricorn is an earthy sign, and its subjects are apt to exaggerate the
importance of earthly life, and in youth suffer much furtive and fearful
curiosity, regarding the mysteries of birth and death, and, as children,
feel deeply any snub or reproof, and should never be brought up by
coarse-minded people, as they readily take on the conditions of those
around them, and although appreciative of commendation lose heart when
indifferently treated.

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

This sign is typical of a remarkable continuity of purpose, and those
born under its influence are deep thinkers and insatiable in their
desire for knowledge, assiduous students, quick to seize and take
advantage of any opportunity for self-improvement or advancement,
indefatigable workers, and capable of planning out several schemes and
thoughts at the same time.

The desire to make money is a marked characteristic, not so much for its
own sake in the majority of cases as for the power and opportunities
which wealth brings; but although thrifty and discreet in financial
affairs generally it is difficult for them to economise in personal
matters, and although they work harder and know better than most how to
make both ends meet, yet the proverbial rainy day occasionally finds
them unprepared.

They are generous by fits and starts, giving ungrudgingly of time as
well as money where others bestow little, and nothing where others give
much, and, in contrast to the Sagittarian type who give mostly to large
institutions, the subjects of Capricorn prefer helping the individual.

The typical Capricornian takes life earnestly, and is much interested in
the occult side of nature, as well as a great upholder of old customs
and observances that bind the present with the past old-world traditions
and antiquities generally

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

having a great fascination for these subjects. When adversely aspected,
however, this type degenerates sadly, showing great despondency and
dread of failure in all they undertake, and without some outside
stimulus becoming more and more apprehensive and mistrustful, avaricious
and covetous until it is almost impossible to live with them. When the
ruling planet Saturn is badly aspected by Mars, revolutionary tendencies
and a cruel enjoyment of the sufferings of others is indicated; but so
great is the love of work even amongst the most primitive of these
subjects of Capricorn, that they are too much engaged to have time to be
vicious, and when the malefic side of the Saturnian's qualities are very
noticeable, it is often the result of too much solitude wherein the
subject has brooded over troubles and anxieties.

The temper is strong and forceful, but generally well under control,
although lasting when roused and bitterly resentful.

The constitution is remarkably strong, and these subjects frequently
live to a good old age, the ailments to which they are liable being
colds, deafness, affections of or accidents to the joints, especially
the knees, which are ruled by this sign (and are often weak), colic,
from flatulence, toothache, spleen, and liver trouble, also severe ear
and headaches caused by nervous prostration,

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

from mental and physical labour in excess. Endurance, Penetration,
Caution, and Prudence being very noticeable in this type, they excel in
all professions requiring shrewdness and acute discernment rising
through personal merit to be recognised authorities in the various
callings to which they are suited.

India, which comes under the rule of Capricorn, aptly illustrates the
qualities and failings, for amongst the Indians we find profound
learning, great power, rank, and a painstaking care of minute
particulars; whilst the lower caste fittingly illustrate the debasement
of the type. Subjects of this House are adapted for most professions and
employments of a public or a governmental character. Being natural
organisers, their concise methods are sought after by the weaker types
they so often serve. Priests, Monks, Occultists, Organists, Statesmen,
Editors, Authors, Designers, Architects, Builders, Mining Speculators,
Land Surveyors, Agriculturists, Gardeners, are all professions and
callings to which this type are attracted; also as Labourers, Miners,
Carpenters, and woodcutters, it being interesting to note that Mr.
Gladstone, who was born during this period, and who was an extremely
good example of the highly intellectual subjects of this House, had also
a fondness for tree-felling.

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

In marriage and friendship they are slow to form attachments, and are
frequently unmarried; but when once attracted the influence is deep and
lasting, although their love affairs are liable to great and fateful
changes, for living, as a rule, solitary and self-centred lives, they
create ideals beyond human attainment, and failing to realise their
anticipations are often disappointed. Saturn, their ruling planet, being
favourable to old rather than young people, they are advised not to
marry early, the most happy and prosperous times in their lives being
often between middle life and seventy, and they will harmonise best with
those born during the Taurus, Virgo, Pisces, and Scorpio periods.

The gems of this House are the Ruby, Spinel, Malachite, Black Onyx, and
Jet.

<span class="smallcaps">The Ruby</span>.—The Ruby is one of the most
precious of gems, when of a good size, free from flaws, and of the true
pigeons’-blood colour, being more valuable than a diamond of the same
size.

The finest rubies come from Burmah, and they are also found in Ceylon
and Siam; their colour varies from light pink to the richest carmine.
Until modern times the Spinel or Balas Ruby was included with the true
Ruby, but they are quite different in their composition, Spinels being
softer and not so brilliant, though more varied in colour,

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

ranging from red, orange, green, and blue to violet. Amongst Oriental
nations this stone has ever and still continues to be a great favourite
as a Talisman; and throughout India, Burmah, and Ceylon it is considered
to guard its wearers from the attacks of enemies, reveal the presence of
poison by changing colour, and to attract friends and good fortune.

In China and Japan it is also worn to confer long life, health, and
happiness. Pliny describes it as the Lychnis, and says the Star Rubies
were considered by the Chaldeans to be most powerful in protecting from
evil and attracting the favour of those in authority. Throughout the
whole of the Orient the Ruby was believed to possess the power of
foretelling danger by a loss of brilliancy and colour, a belief also
common throughout Europe as confirmed by Wolfgangus Gabelschoverus, who
writing in the year 1600, says, whilst travelling with his wife: "I
observed by the way that a very fine Ruby (which she had given me) lost
repeatedly and each time almost completely its splendid colour and
assumed a blackish hue." He goes on to tell that the threatened evil was
fulfilled by the loss of his wife, and that after her death the stone
regained its colour and brilliancy.

Catherine of Aragon is reported to have also possessed a ring set with a
ruby that indicated

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

in the same manner the approach of misfortune.

Camillus Leonardus says that the Ruby gave control of the passions,
drove out evil thoughts, secured possessions to their rightful owner,
reconciled quarrels, brought peace and concord, also preserved bodily
strength and health, and that the Balas Ruby (Spinel) possesses the
power of averting danger of hail and tempest.

It was worn by the subjects of this House whose horoscopes were free
from Saturn's afflictions to protect the body from plague, poison, and
fevers, and to secure love and friendship, preserve health, vitality,
and cheerfulness, against disorders of the liver and spleen, and to
drive away evil dreams and spirits. It was also believed to be a very
active and sensitive stone, and if the horoscope had Saturn badly
afflicted would afford a ready channel for disappointment, bereavement,
and other misfortunes incidental to the influence of this planet when
malefic.

<span class="smallcaps">The Malachite</span>.—Malachite is an opaque
stone, its principal composition being carbonate of copper, which gives
it a beautiful green colour.

The name is derived from the Greek *Malaku*, signifying the Mallow
plant, as its colouring was thought to resemble that of Mallow leaves.
The finest quality comes from Siberia, and it is also

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

found in Australia, Africa, and Germany, and it is believed to be the
Molochites of Pliny; it was also used extensively by the Egyptians, both
for talismanic and ornamental purposes.

It is very popular in the East and throughout Russia, where it is
regarded as a safeguard against colic and rheumatism, its benefits
acting through the copper in its composition; and in connection with
this, Dr. Alfred J. Pearce in his text-book of Astrology mentions "that
workers in copper mines have escaped cholera when their neighbours died
of it, also that copper is worn by the Hindus as a Charm against
cholera."

Marbodus recommends the Malachite as a Talisman for young people because
of its protective qualities and power in attracting sound sleep; it was
also worn for protection from lightning and contagious diseases and for
health, success, and constancy in the affections. During the Middle Ages
it was customary to wear it engraved with a figure or symbol of the Sun
as a preservative to the health and to avert despondency and depression
of spirits to which the Capricorn type are liable.

<span class="smallcaps">Black Onyx</span>.—The Onyx generally has been
treated in the chapter on Leo when writing of the Sardonyx; but the
stone peculiar to Capricorn is the black, or dark brown, which is
generally

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

marked with a decided white stripe across it, or the white stripe may
appear in the form of a circle round the centre, in which case it is
known as the Lynx-eye Onyx by the natives of India where the finest
stones are found.

From very remote ages, particularly in India, the Black Onyx has been
considered essentially the stone for rosaries, its attributes being to
restrain passion, to give spiritual strength and inspiration, and to be
beneficial in the cure of fits. It should not, however, be worn by any
one born with Saturn unfavourable in their horoscope, which fact was
known to mediæval astrologers who, in such cases, as mentioned by
Marbodus, assert that its wearer would be exposed to the assaults of
demons and bad visions by night, and plagued with quarrels, law-suits,
and melancholy by day; that it would nullify their labours, and even
cause its owners to feel the pinch of poverty (all recognised Saturnian
troubles and afflictions), only to be counteracted by the introduction
of the Sun's brightening influence in the form of the Sard.

<span class="smallcaps">Jet</span>.—Jet is of vegetable origin, being
fossil wood, a variety of, but very much harder than ordinary coal, and
capable of taking a very high polish. The finest is the well-known
Whitby jet which was first discovered by the monks of the historical
Abbey before the Reformation brought its

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

ruin. Jet is also found on the coasts of the Baltic, and in the Middle
Ages was known as Black Amber, being worn as a prophylactic against
epilepsy and fits, and to prevent strangulation of the womb; taken
internally, powdered in wine, it was considered good for the toothache,
and mixed with beeswax was used for tumours. It was also well known and
used by all ancient nations, the Greeks dedicating it to Cybele, the
goddess of all things necessary to life produced by the earth, wearing
it for her favours and especially for protection to travellers by sea
and land. Bœtius de Boot recommends it as a specific against nightmare,
witchcraft, and melancholy apprehension.

Neither the Ruby, Malachite, Black Onyx, nor Jet should be worn by the
Libra or Aries type, or indeed by any who have Saturn afflicted in their
birth map.
