<span class="smallcaps">Tetragrammaton</span>, or mystic name, had its
derivation in a Hebrew word, "Yod-he-vau-he," which signified the
unutterable name of Jehovah, its meaning being "He that is and shall
be." The sigil is composed of letters formed from the following four
texts: Exodus xiii. 2nd and 10th verses, also verses 11 and 16; and
Deuteronomy vi. 4th and 9th verses. It was very popular as a Talisman in
the Middle Ages for protection from enemies, also to bring peace,
harmony, and long life, and was usually made in the form of a pentacle
with the five syllables engraved in each corner (see Illustration No.
142, [Plate X](#img_pl10).md) with the Hebrew letter Yod, or Shin, in the
centre.

It was also worn by the Jews in the form of a <span
class="smallcaps">Phylactery</span>, which was a strip of cowhide
parchment inscribed with verses from the Talmud,

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

or with the Tetragrammaton and the sigil formed from the four passages
of Scripture already referred to. It was enclosed in a black calfskin
case which had thongs attached to it for binding on the forehead, or
round the left arm. Worn when attending worship in their synagogues, it
was considered to have great potency as a Talisman.

The illustration of the Tetragrammaton is taken from Barrett's *Magus*,
as are also Nos. 140 and 141, [Plate X](#img_pl10.md), which are described
as containing "the beginnings and ends of the first five verses of
Genesis, and representation of the creation of the world; and by this
ligature they say that a man shall be free from all mischiefs if that he
firmly believes in God, the Creator of all things."

No. 135, [Plate X](#img_pl10.md), is a Talisman of Venus which is in the
British Museum, and is also described in the *Magus* as worn for success
and good fortune in love, joyfulness, and to make travellers fortunate.
The written inscription is an addition probably made personally, and
reads:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"Accipe my petitione, O domine, keep me as apple of an eye, hide me
under the shadow of thy wings from all evel, up Lord and help us for
thou art my strong rock and my castle. Amen."

</div>

<span class="smallcaps">The Totaphoth</span> was another species of
Talisman

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

worn by the Hebrews as a frontlet, consisting of a plate slightly
curved, inscribed with passages from the Talmud, which covered the
forehead from ear to ear and was bound with a fillet of gold or silver
by those who could afford it, and with strips of coloured cloth by the
poor. Scapulars, or pieces of brown cloth, in which were stitched
certain verses from the Gospel of St. John written on paper, or
parchment, guarded against perils by flood or field, and a Dove with a
branch of Olive in its mouth engraved in pyrites, ensured for the
pilgrim the utmost hospitality wheresoever he journeyed.

The Gnostic god <span class="smallcaps">Abraxas</span> is frequently
depicted with the head of a Cock, this bird being considered a powerful
Talisman for vigilance, and also a symbol of the Sun, as well as of
Mercury. It is sometimes represented with an ear of corn in its beak,
denoting that "vigilance produces plenty."

<span class="smallcaps">The Eye of a Cock</span> was considered a potent
Talisman against witchcraft and the wiles of the Devil, even the lion
being afraid of its hypnotic glance; and as Christ was thought by the
early Christians to have arisen from the tomb at cockcrow, the Cock was
from an early period used as a symbol of the Resurrection, and its image
was engraved on many of the ancient tombs. Placed

PLATE 10. MEDIÆVAL TALISMANS.  
</span>

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

as it still is, on the highest point of the church tower or spire, it is
singularly appropriate as a church Talisman.

<span class="smallcaps">Bells</span> were another form of Talisman used
in olden days, the traditional idea being that any great noise would
terrify the Devil and all evil spirits, so that bells were attached to
the heads of. horses and to the playthings of children to protect them
from harm; and were also hung in church towers to scare the ears of
demons, whilst the Gargoyles struck terror to the eyes of the evil ones.

<span class="smallcaps">Cramp Rings</span> were another form of Talisman
worn for the prevention or cure of cramp. These rings were at one time
hallowed by the Kings and Queens of England, but the custom was
discontinued in the reign of Edward VI. An old MS., emblazoned with the
arms of Philip and Mary, gives the prayers used in the consecration of
these rings. The rings were placed in a dish and the ceremony commenced
with the reading of a Psalm and a prayer for the communication of the
divine gift of healing, after which the sovereign hallowed the rings by
saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"O God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, hear mercifully our prayers, Spare
those who feare thee, and be propitious to thy suppliants, and

</div>

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

graciously be pleased to send down from heaven, thy holy angel, that he
may sanctify and bless these rings to the end that they may prove a
healthy remedy to such as implore thy name with humilitie. Amen."

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> After the blessing
of the rings, the King rubbed them between the palms of his hands,
saying:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"Sanctify, O Lord, these rings and graciously bedew them with the dew of
thine benediction and consecration, and hallow them by the rubbing of
our hands which thou hast been pleased according to our ministry, to the
end that what the nature of the metal is not able to perform may be
wrought by the greatness of thy grace."

</div>

Then holy water was sprinkled on the rings:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost."

</div>

These rings were considered most efficacious if formed out of the screws
and nails taken from old coffins, and were frequently considered most
beneficial in the cure of epileptic fits if hallowed on Good Friday.
This custom, according to Hospinian, took its rise from a famous ring
long preserved in Westminster Abbey; this ring had been brought from
Jerusalem by Edward the

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Confessor, and was
believed to be efficacious against cramp and epilepsy when touched by
those afflicted. Another Talisman ring of the sixteenth century was of
Jewish origin, engraved with a Hebrew word "Musseltaub," meaning "We
wish you good luck," inscribed inside.

Within the hoop of the betrothal or wedding ring it was customary to
inscribe sentences, or poesies (posies), and this custom appears to have
lasted into the latter part of the eighteenth century, when it fell into
disuse. It has been revived of late years, devices, mottoes, and
hieroglyphics being once more inscribed in engagement rings, to express
the sentiment of the giver and to act as a mutual token of love and
friendship. Some of these ancient posies may be found interesting, such
as:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"The eye did find, the heart did chuse, the hand doth bind, till death
doth loose."

"Let Love Encrease."

"God did decree the Unitie."

"Where Hearts agree there love will be."

"Hearts united live contented."

"Keep fayth till deth."

"I seek to be, not thine, but thee."

"Let lyking laste."

"Hearts truly tied none can divide."

</div>

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"Joye sans cesse."

"Let us be one till we are none."

"Fear the Lord and rest content, so shall we live and not repent."

"This and the giver are thine for ever."

</div>

A very old ring (says the author of *Ring Lore*) is in the collection of
J. Evans, Esq.; it is of gold set with a small sapphire, inscribed:

JE, SVI, ICI, EN, LI’V, D’AMI.  
(I am here in place of a friend.)

Other devices express the sentiment of the giver in the setting of the
gems of the ring, as, for instance, the word "Regard" is represented by
a

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

<span class="smallcaps">Ruby  
Emerald  
Garnet  
Amethyst  
Ruby  
Diamond</span>

</div>

placed in sequence round the ring.

<span class="smallcaps">The Gemmel</span>, Or <span
class="smallcaps">Gemmow</span>, rings were frequently double or even
triply made, the word "Gemmel" denoting jointed hinges, or jimmers. At
the time of the betrothal the parties concerned broke away the upper and
lower rings over an

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

open Bible, each wearing the respective ring severed (the third ring
being held by the witness of their betrothal) until the marriage took
place, when the rings were reunited and became the Wedding Ring. It was
considered most unlucky for a ring to hurt its wearer, or fall to the
ground during the betrothal or marriage, and it is said to be a curious
fact that when this has happened the incident has been followed by
disappointment or misfortune to one or both of the persons concerned.

The Ancients had great faith in <span class="smallcaps">Zodiacal
Rings</span>, in the construction of which the aspects and positions of
the planets were of the utmost importance. They were worn for the gift
of eloquence and were in great favour with lawyers, poets, and orators,
being worn on the fourth finger (Mercury ruling speech and the tongue).

These Zodiacal rings, engraved with the representation of the twelve
signs of the Zodiac in their order, are aptly described in the following
rhyme, for which we are indebted to the Rev. C. W. King's book, *The
Natural History of Precious Stones and Gems*, although it is not from
that author's pen, but merely quoted by him:

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC IN RHYME

"Hear how each sign the body's portion sways,  
 How every part its proper lord obeys  
 And what the members of the human frame  
 Wherein to rule, their several forces claim.  
 First to the Ram, the Head hath been assigned;  
 Lord of the sinews, Neck, the Bull we find;  
 The arms and shoulders joined in union fair  
 Possess the Twins, each one an equal share.  
 The Crab, as sovereign o’er the Breast presides;  
 The Lion, the shoulder blades and sides.  
 Down to the flank, ‘the Virgin’s’ lot descends,  
 And with the buttock Libra's influence ends;  
 The fiery Scorpion in the groin delights,  
 The Centaur in the thighs exerts his rights,  
 While either knee doth Capricornus rule,  
 The legs the province of Aquarius cool;  
 Last, the twain Fishes as their region meet,  
 Hold jurisdiction on the pairs of feet."

</div>

#### <span class="smallcaps">General Talismans</span>

An historic Talisman of Oriental origin which was famous during the
fourteenth century, is the

<span class="smallcaps">Lee Penny</span>, which is described as a small
red stone of triangular or heart shape, and of unknown origin, set in a
groat of Edward IV.

According to tradition, it was brought from the Holy Land by Sir Simon
Locard of Lee, who accompanied Sir James Douglas to Palestine bearing
the heart of Robert Bruce enclosed in a golden casket, and, for his
services in connection

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

with this, was given the name of Lockhart, and for armorial bearings, a
lock and a heart. Fighting in the Holy Land, Sir Simon captured a
Saracen Emir whom he held to ransom. The Emir's lady willingly paid the
ransom; but while handing out a goodly supply of golden bezants, she
dropped a small jewel. So marked was her anxiety to recover it, that the
canny Sir Simon, with a true Caledonian instinct for a bargain,
conjectured the apparently valueless stone must be a potent Talisman.
Consequently he refused to set his prisoner at liberty unless the stone
was included in the ransom.

Amongst its many merits it cures hydrophobia, takes away disease from
horned cattle, and counteracts the poison of infectious complaints if it
is soaked in water and the water is used as a cordial.

For its use during an epidemic of the plague Newcastle is reputed to
have granted a bond of £6000 for its safe return.

Another Scottish Talisman is a <span class="smallcaps">Crystal</span>
set in silver, which is worn hung round the back for diseases of the
kidneys; it is also directed to be steeped in water seven times, the
water to be drunk by the patient.

<span class="smallcaps">The Moon</span> is another symbol of importance
in connection with the talismanic properties of

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

water, upon which it has a vitalising influence. In Oudh a silver basin
is filled with water by the people, who hold it so that the orb of the
full moon is reflected therein, their doctors recommending this as a
remedy for nervous hysteria and palpitation, patients being directed to
look steadfastly for a while at the reflection, then to shut their eyes
and drink the water at a gulp.

Many and various are the ways in which lunar sympathy and influence were
turned to account in olden days, warts being considered particularly
susceptible to its influence, and a charm repeated over them at the
junction of four cross roads as the moon waned in light was believed to
be most efficacious in removing the blemishes. The formula prescribed:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

<span class="small">"As the moon decreases  
 So may these warts disappear,"</span>

</div>

is still in vogue in certain remote country villages in England.
Christians and Moslems alike turn silver money in their pockets that
their goods and money may increase when the moon is new and gaining in
light, and their ills decrease as it wanes. The Moon's image in crescent
shape was also considered a fortunate Talisman for expectant mothers.

<span class="smallcaps">The Peacock</span> was regarded in very ancient

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

times a symbol of triumph over the grave; its flesh was believed to be
incorruptible, which probably accounts for its presence in church
decoration; and because it renews its plumage yearly it was taken as the
symbol of immortality.

It was the bird of Juno, the goddess and protectress of Malta; and on
one of the old gateways her statue is still in existence bearing her
symbolic bird. The supposition that the feathers of a Peacock are
unlucky is said to have had its origin in the anger of the goddess Juno,
having been aroused by the plucking of the feathers of her favourite
bird; in her wrath she decreed that no suitors should come for the
daughters of any house wherein should be found Peacocks' feathers, that
the children should never be well, nor the occupants of a house healthy
where these feathers were used as ornaments. It is believed the
Egyptians also considered the feathers a perpetual emblem of the Evil
Eye.

In many parts of the country old houses are still to be seen with one,
or even two pieces of iron in the shape of the letter S attached to the
outer walls. These are intended to protect the building from being
destroyed by fire, and are not, as is generally supposed, employed as a
support; sometimes the S will have a bar across its centre;

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

another form is shaped like two crescents, placed back to back, also
with a bar across the centre; but in each case they are only bolted at
one point, and their meaning is the same—a charm against destruction by
fire, and in all probability. it was intended as a form of the Swastika
Cross.

<span class="smallcaps">Gold Nuggets</span> are considered lucky charms
for speculators in mines, and miners; and Leap Year Pennies should
always be kept in the kitchen to bring unexpected windfalls to the
house.

To card players the Deuce of Clubs is said to be the Talisman of the
pack, and is generally the sign of four or five trumps in the dealer's
hand; whilst the Four of Clubs is the most unlucky card, the holder of
it seldom if ever winning the game; in old writings this card is known
as "the devil's bedstead."

<span class="smallcaps">A Badger's Tooth</span> sewn inside the
right-hand pocket of the waistcoat is also a well-known Talisman for
luck at cards.

<span class="smallcaps">The Four-Leaved Clover</span> is another
well-known charm for good luck, generally, for—

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

<span class="small">"One leaf is for fame,  
 And one leaf is for wealth  
 And one for a faithful lover,  
 And one to bring you glorious health  
 Are all in the four-leaved clover."</span>
