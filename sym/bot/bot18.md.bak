### CHAPTER III

#### GEMINI—THE HOUSE OF THE TWINS

<span class="small">Period—The Twins, Castor and Pollux—The
Argonauts—King Solomon's Pillars—Maia—Ovid and Wedding of Mary Queen of
Scots—Gemini Number—Characteristics—Agates and their
Virtues—Orpheus—Chrysoprase—Alexander the Great—Virtues of the
Stone.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Gemini</span>, the Zodiacal House of the Twins,
is occupied by the Sun from the 22nd of May until the 21st of June
approximately, and is ruled by the planet Mercury. In the earliest
Zodiacs this House was symbolised by two kids, for which the Greeks
substituted twin children, the sons of Jupiter, represented by two
bright stars, Castor and Pollux.

Gemini is also symbolised by two Pillars joined at the top and base (♊),
which is a diagrammatic representation of the Twins seated side by side
with embracing arms. Castor was killed in battle, and Pollux,
overwhelmed at his loss, entreated Jupiter to restore his brother to
life, or make them both immortal. As a reward for this great affection,
and in recognition of their noble deeds when

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

on earth, Jupiter translated the two brothers, thus forming the
Constellation *Gemini* in the heavens. It was believed that among other
achievements they cleared the neighbouring seas of pirates, and when the
Argonauts were in distress from a violent tempest, two lambent flames
descended from the clouds and settled upon the heads of Castor and
Pollux, a calm immediately ensuing.

From these circumstances they were regarded as protectors of navigation,
it being inferred that whenever both stars were visible it was a
harbinger of fine weather, the appearance of one star only signifying
storms and tempests.

It may be noted that as a rule the seas are calm when the Sun is in
Gemini, and it was at this period of the year that the forty days’ rain
of the Deluge ceased.

The symbol of the two Pillars joined at the top and base, already
referred to, were also believed to typify the two pillars set up by King
Solomon in the porch of the Temple, which were quite distinct and apart
from the building itself and were not for any structural purpose, their
use being entirely symbolical.

One was named "Jachin," meaning "He will establish," and the other
"Boaz," signifying "In Him is strength"; also they denoted the union of
Intellect and Intuition.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

The symbols of the Twins and Pillars are shown in No. 3 of the coloured
[Frontispiece](bot00.htm#img_front.md).

Amongst the Romans the month of May was sacred to Maia the goddess of
Sterility, and this month was, therefore, considered by them a most
unfavourable time for marriages. Ovid in his *Fasti* tells us that—

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"Neither are the times suitable for the marriage of the widow nor the
virgin. She who was married was not so for long. Also for this cause (if
proverbs affect you) they commonly say evil things for marrying in the
month of Mai."

</div>

This last sentence (in its original Latin) was affixed to the gates of
Holyrood Palace after the wedding of Mary Queen of Scots to Bothwell on
the 15th of May, 1567. Another old writer says that the day of the week
on which the 14th of May falls is not only unlucky for marriage in this
unfortunate month, but that throughout the remainder of the year that
particular day will bring ill-luck to those who marry on it; and another
old proverb runs: "May never was ye month of love." Even now it is
stated fewer marriages take place in this month than in any other.

The fortunate number of the Gemini type is 5, which was considered to
have peculiar virtues as a Talisman by the Ancient Egyptians and Greeks

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

because it unites the first even and odd numbers 2 and 3. It was often
inscribed over doors to keep out evil spirits. In connection with this,
it is interesting to note that in Roman ceremonies of marriage it was
usual to light five tapers and to admit the guests by five; Jewish
history records a frequent use of this number, five gifts to the
priests, five things only to be eaten in camp. Joseph gave five suits of
raiment to Benjamin, and presented only five of his brothers to Pharaoh.
David took five pebbles when he went to fight Goliath, and Joshua hanged
five kings on five trees; further, every important measurement of the
Tabernacle was five or a multiple of five; also there were five wise and
five foolish virgins. In the Mohammedan religion there are five articles
of belief, namely in Allah, in the Prophets, in Angels, the Day of
Judgment, and Predestination.

In Astrology there are five principal aspects of the planets which rule
the good, or bad fortunes of the subject; also in Masonry the grand
scheme is five points of fellowship, also five brethren can hold a
fellow-craft's lodge. The fifth son of Jacob, Issachar, represents
Gemini, and, in naming him, Leah expresses the leading qualities of the
symbol—that is, reward and recompense which its mental qualities bring.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

The subjects born during this period are invariably of an intellectual
disposition, and when well-educated their ideals and aspirations are
high, with an intense desire to do useful work. When inclined to
religion they favour the intellectual and idealistic. In family life
they are very loyal and faithful, helping their relations however
undeserving. Though generous to their families or when prompted by
personal influence, these subjects are not lavish in their expenditure.
Being fond of money and ingenious in their schemes and methods of making
it, they like to secure a good return for money spent and their natural
shrewdness enables them to get the better of their fellows. They have a
quick comprehension of human nature which assists them in their schemes,
enabling them to weigh up any one they may be dealing with, and
consequently to get the best of a bargain. Their success, or otherwise,
will depend to a great extent on the positions occupied and the aspects
in relation to each other of the Moon and planets at the time of their
birth.

Under harmonious circumstances they possess keen judgment, quick wit,
ability in artistic directions, and the faculty of acquiring knowledge
without much apparent effort, their capabilities carrying them to the
highest mental attainments

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

but, when ill-balanced, they sink to the extreme of clever trickery and
fraud.

Their characteristics are often contradictory. Being peculiarly
undecided in their dispositions and invariably of two minds, the
constant influx of new ideas causes much innate restlessness, the
realisation of their plans seldom coming up to anticipations. Owing to
the antagonism between their feelings and their reason, they are seldom
able to concentrate on any one thing for any length of time, thus they
start many schemes and enterprises which they abandon before completion.
In consequence, Intuition and its forces, (as opposed to Impulse and
individual inclination,) strain and perplex the versatile mind of this
type, making them capricious and irritable, although their anger is
easily appeased. They are highly strung, vivacious, restless, and fond
of change and variety in their friends and associates, having great
dislike to monotonous work and ever seeking fresh outlets for their
effervescence.

In argument, from their facility of expression and dual nature, they are
the most difficult of opponents to overcome. Many of our most clever
advocates and solicitors have been born during this period, and as
illustrative of the duality of this House, it produces, when favourably
aspected,

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

the best physicians, authors, orators, actors, schoolmasters,
journalists, merchants, accountants, secretaries, and linguists; also
our smartest detectives; but when the worst side of their character is
developed, the subjects of this House become the craftiest of
law-breakers. The cleverest of criminals come from this type, ranging
from fraudulent company promoters to thieves and pickpockets.

Gemini rules the arms, shoulders, and hands; and ailments such as
sprains and displacements attack Gemini subjects in their limbs. The
lungs, too, are sometimes afflicted, generally through defections in
breathing; also a tendency to rheumatic and gouty pains in those
portions of the body ruled by this sign, and when Mercury, the ruling
planet, is badly aspected, digestive trouble, nervous ailments, and
imperfect action of the liver are indicated.

In marriage and business relations those born during the Gemini period
will agree best with Aries, Leo, Libra, and Aquarius characters, and it
is a curious fact that in the lives of those born whilst the Sun
occupies the House of the Twins, nearly all important events, fortunate
or unfortunate, happen twice, and incidents in the career are repeated
in a similar way.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

The fortunate stones of this House are all varieties of Agates and the
Chrysoprase.

<span class="smallcaps">The Agate</span>.—The Agate is a variety of
quartz found in different colours, often with alternate layers of red
and white known as "ribbon" Agate, also of a milky white. The latter can
be artificially coloured and, in consequence, is obtainable in bright
greens and blues as well as in various tones of greyish purple.

The Moss or Tree Agate is a variety ornamented by Nature in a most
remarkable manner with lines, spots, and frequently with natural objects
taking the distinct forms of ferns, trees, clouds, and moss, giving a
very mysterious effect to the stone. In the days of the Romans this
variety was held in high repute as possessing both medicinal and
talismanic virtues, it being claimed that the wonderful markings formed
in this stone indicated that it had been specially singled out by the
Creator to receive wondrous occult power. According to Orpheus, "If thou
wear a piece of Tree Agate upon thine hand the Immortal Gods shall be
well pleased with thee; if the same be tied to the harness of thy oxen
when ploughing, or about the ploughman's sturdy arm, wheat-crowned Ceres
shall descend from heaven with full lap upon thy furrows."

The Moss Agate was also considered good for

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

the sight and was used by physicians for palettes on which they ground
down the ingredients used in making up lotions and ointments.

The vegetable representations in the Tree Agates are supposed to have
been produced by particles of metallic substances, such as iron and
magnesium; the name Mocha Stone, sometimes used to indicate this
variety, is derived from Mocha in Arabia, where it was found.

In the British Museum there is a striking specimen of Moss Agate
representing a likeness of the poet Chaucer; and the Strawberry Hill
Collection has another with a portrait of Voltaire, and a third showing
the profile of a woman. There are also numerous varieties of Agate
dependent upon the arrangement of the layers; sometimes the stone shows
parallel lines of light and dark tints, when it is called banded or
ribbon Agate. When the colours are very sharp and defined it becomes
Onyx Agate, and when the stripes converge towards the centre of the
stone it is known as Eye Agate; whilst another variety showing many
colours becomes Rainbow or Iris Agate.

According to Mr. Streeter, Agates in their natural state are formed in
the cavities of rocks, and it is conjectured that when the rocks were in
a fluid state the Agates were formed by the escape

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

of gas or steam. These cavities were afterwards filled with some mineral
substance, such as silica, held in solution and deposited on the
interior walls of these receptacles, forming a kind of geode.

In addition to the Moss or Tree Agate, the Greeks and Romans had great
faith in the talismanic and medicinal virtues of all other Agates,
wearing them to avert sickness, regarding them particularly as an
antidote to the bite of an Asp, if taken powdered in wine, or as an
infallible cure for the sting of a Scorpion if tied over the wound. They
also brought success in love and friendship, great gain, and the favours
of the great, if strung on a hair taken from a lion's mane.

Pliny was a great believer in the virtues of the Agate, and writes that
storms may be averted by burning these stones; whilst Camillo Leonardo,
in addition to their power to avert lightning and tempest, says they
bring strength, vigour, and great success to their wearers. Marbodus,
Bishop of Rennes, ascribes the escape of Æneas from all his perils to
the virtue of an Agate Talisman which he always carried with him.

Although these stones eventually ceased to be in much demand for signets
amongst the Romans, they never lost their popularity as Talismans, and
were in great request, not only amongst the

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Latin races, but
also among the Persians and peoples of the Orient, amongst whom it was
universally believed to confer eloquence, to enlighten the mind, to
allay fevers, also to bring luck in connection with wills and legacies,
to sharpen the sight, aid in the discovery of treasure, and make its
wearer amiable and agreeable.

Amongst Mohammedans it was believed to cure insanity if taken powdered
in apple juice. In Elizabethan days our forefathers had great faith in
its talismanic virtues, the Queen having amongst her jewels a large oval
Agate engraved with scenes representing Vulcan at his forge with Venus
looking on. This jewel was presented to her by Archbishop Parker, and
was accompanied by a parchment giving in Latin a long list of its
properties, concluding to the effect that as long as Her Majesty
possessed this jewel she would ever have a trusty friend.

Agates of all kinds were much esteemed by the Greeks, particularly those
specimens in which could be traced resemblances to natural objects. The
following verse poetically describes its many qualities:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

<span class="small">"Who comes with summer to this earth  
 And owes to June her day of birth,  
 With ring of Agate on her hand  
 Can Health, Wealth and long life command."</span>

</div>

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The Chrysoprase</span>.—The Chrysoprase, like
the Agate, is a variety of quartz and takes its name from two Greek
words meaning "golden leek," in reference to its colour, which varies
from an opaque yellowish green to a very light dirty white-green. The
colour has a tendency to fade from long exposure to the light and sun,
but can be restored if the stone is dipped in a solution of nitrate of
nickel.

The finest specimens come from Silesia, and when the stone was in demand
it used to be customary to close the mines for every two years out of
three.

According to Albertus Magnus, a Chrysoprase formed the Amulet of
Alexander the Great, and Chrysoprase was much used by the ancient Greeks
and Romans for signet rings and cameos; and also by the Egyptians, who
set it with lapis lazuli.

The virtues attributed to the Chrysoprase were that it imparted
cheerfulness, making the heart glad by removing uneasiness, protecting
its wearers from evil dreams and the assaults of demons.

It also bestowed all kinds of blessings on its owner, giving assiduity
in good works, and taking away all greedy and covetous desires, bringing
success in new enterprises, and true and faithful

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

friends: and it was also worn as an Amulet against rheumatism and gout.

The Agates and Chrysoprase stones will not, however, be fortunate for
those born during the time that the Sun occupies the Houses of Virgo and
Pisces.
