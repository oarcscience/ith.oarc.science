<span class="smallcaps">Aquarius</span>, the Water-bearer, is the
eleventh sign of the Zodiac, and is situated in the Southern Celestial
Hemisphere between the constellations of Capricornus the Goat and Pisces
the Fishes. This constellation has only a few bright stars and is not
easy to find, but with the aid of a good glass its shape as a pitcher or
vase may be traced showing two star streams which How from its mouth,
one towards the Goat and the other falling downwards. It can be seen
best during the months of September and October, between the hours of 9
and II p.m., and is occupied by the Sun from January 10th until February
19th approximately each year.

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

The Pitcher or Vase, as the symbol of the House, was universally used by
ancient nations, the Chinese describing it as the Vase full, the
Chaldeans as the Watering-pot, the Arabians as the Pitcher or Urn, and
the Greeks and Romans as the Water-pourer; it is illustrated in No. 11
of the [Frontispiece](bot00.htm#img_front.md).

In many old star maps the figure of a man is shown carrying the Pitcher;
but at the present time, at any rate, the figure cannot be traced in the
stars of the constellation and was doubtless entirely imaginary, being
probably added to illustrate the early religious teachings of the
Zodiac, the Arabic name for "a aquari," the principal star of this
group, being "sadal melik," meaning "fortunate star of the King," the
figure typifying the King, or Priest, who by his outpourings made his
country fortunate or blessed. An interpretation which, at least, is in
harmony with its qualities, is that Aquarius, being one of the airy
triplicities and the period of its occupation by the Sun being a moist
one (familiarly known to us as February Fill-dyke), the vapours and
clouds borne on its air are appropriately symbolised by the figure of a
water-bearer, and the two waved lines <span id="img_25800"></span>
![](img/25800.jpg) the most ancient pictorial illustration of water
which form the Glyph of this House equally well expressed its qualities.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

Ancient writers assign Saturn to be the ruler of this House as well as
of Capricorn, and he is doubtless very strong when in occupation, but
the consensus of opinion amongst modern astrologers is to replace Saturn
by the planet Uranus as the ruler of this sign, appearing as he does to
affect this House more than any other during his periodic stay of seven
years. Being akin to Saturn in its nature, but unknown to the ancient
authorities, they not unnaturally thought its qualities were of a
Saturnian character.

Those born under the influence of Aquarius possess extremely complex
minds and dispositions often unconsciously as well as consciously
absorbing impressions and information on all kinds of topics and
out-of-the-way subjects, their interests being widely spread and
far-reaching; and, as their symbol the Water-bearer suggests, their
diffusive natures give them an extraordinary facility in the passing on
of knowledge to others in a manner easy to understand, their
well-stocked minds full of reminiscence and anecdote making them most
interesting companions when they choose.

Unlike those born under the influence of Capricorn, they do not run in
any well-worn groove of thought nor use any established reason or
method, preferring ways and ideas of their own to those of others.
Despite their ability to succeed

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

in almost any direction, their fluctuating moods incline them often to
scatter their talents and energies, thus losing them many opportunities
of advancement in a definite profession or occupation. Although acting
from what seems to themselves well-defined motives, they frequently
annoy their friends and relations by what appears to be a capricious
restlessness. The perceptive faculty being stronger in the Aquarian type
than in others, they are remarkably good judges of human nature and
character, and, their analytical and reasoning powers being very
pronounced, they see through the motives and actions of others very
quickly and easily, often having a reply ready before the other has
finished speaking. Although careful to examine the facts or truths of
any matter before finally accepting it, they speak their minds freely or
express their opinions forcibly when necessary. They are intelligent,
independent, and progressive in their ideas, with a strong sense of
justice and forethought in all they undertake. Contrary to the
expectations of those about them, they often succeed where nothing but
failure seems possible; their will-power, being firm even to obstinacy,
continues to exert itself to the end of any achievement in spite of
obstacles and difficulties which others consider insurmountable. They
usually have more than one source of

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

income, but do not show to the best advantage when born rich, for in
their endeavour to get the best value for outlay and the best interest
on investments, and being subject to sudden gains and losses, their
dread of poverty makes money always more or less an anxiety, whether
inherited or earned, which makes them very careful in financial affairs,
giving outsiders the impression of meanness, although when wealthy they
frequently leave large sums for the benefit of the community.

Extremes frequently meet in this type, which includes some of the
strongest as well as some of the most erratic and indecisive characters
who, when adversely aspected, become cantankerous, abrupt in manners,
selfish, and obstinate, and through their eccentricity and peculiarity
of temperament are often the creators of their own enemies and
misfortunes.

The temper is quick and irritable, and they do not recover easily from
its effect, surrounding themselves as it were with a barrier of reserve
impossible to break through or approach.

The professions and occupations in which they are most successful are
frequently of an uncommon nature, or of an advanced kind, noteworthy
examples of subjects born during this period being Darwin, Dickens,
Edison, Ruskin, and Sir Henry

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Irving. Many
investors, metaphysicians, scientists, artists, authors, hypnotists,
electricians, elocutionists, actors, art and literary critics, analysts,
telegraphists are Aquarians, and having much resourceful and inventive
genius are often successful where others fail.

The health defects of those born under this sign are usually complicated
and sometimes incurable, including accidents from lightning and
electricity, giddiness, neuritis, rheumatism, derangements of the
digestive system, bad circulation, catarrh, eczema, bad chills, and
sprains and injuries to the ankles which are ruled by this sign and are
often weak in childhood.

In matters relating to marriage and friendship they arc difficult to
please, being apt to demand a reason even for their ideals which makes
them scrutinise the faults and failings of those with whom they come in
contact, thoughtlessness and its resultant mistakes being to them
incomprehensible. Although fond of living in towns and cities and mixing
with others are often the most lonely of all the types; but if once
deeply attracted are staunch and true, and will be most in sympathy with
the Gemini, Libra, Aries, and Sagittarian types, and least in harmony
with those of the Taurus and Scorpio signs.

The gems of this House are the Garnet and all

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

the Zircons, which include the Jargoon, Hyacinth, and Jacinth.

<span class="smallcaps">The Garnet</span>.—Garnets are found in many
varieties, each being described by a special name; the Bohemian Garnet
is a deep red, whilst the Cinnamon stone usually has its colour varied
by a tinge of orange; Almandines have a violet hue and take their name
from Alabanda, a town in Asia Minor, where, according to Pliny, this
stone (which he describes as the Alabandicus) was in his time cut and
polished. They are found in Brazil, Mexico, Bohemia, Australia, and
North America, an uncommon bright green variety being also found in the
Ural Mountains. The colour of the best stones approximates to that of
the Ruby, fur which it was sometimes mistaken by the Ancients, and
amongst modern jewellers it is frequently described as the Cape Ruby,
although the Ruby is a much harder stone, richer in colour, and
possesses much more fire.

Garnets have always been extensively used throughout the East and
amongst the Greeks and Romans, the latter frequently using them for
engraving, several fine specimens of Imperial portraits having come down
to us in this way.

In India and throughout Persia it was known as an Amulet against poison
and the plague, worn to attract health and cheerfulness, and as a
protection

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

against lightning. During the Middle Ages it was used as a remedy for
inflammatory diseases, and to confer constancy, fidelity, and
cheerfulness to its rightful wearers, but was said to cause discord
amongst those having no right to it by birth. Like the Ruby, it warned
its owner of approaching danger and trouble by changing its colour, and
was much in vogue at one time as a keepsake between friends at parting.

<span class="smallcaps">The Zircon</span>.—The Zircon includes Jacinth,
or Hyacinth, and Jargoons, which, though differing in colour, are
actually the same material species. As a rule amongst modern dealers in
Precious Stones the White Zircon is known as the Jargoon, which is often
found flawless and so bright as to closely resemble the diamond, being
in fact often offered for sale as the diamond in Indian Bazaars.

Jacinths, or Hyacinths, are Zircons of deep orange or rich bright red
colour, the Jacinth name being of Arabic origin, and the Hyacinth Greek,
because it resembled the Hyacinth flowers which Apollo caused to spring
from the blood of his favourite Hyacinthus whom he accidentally killed
with a quoit. The remaining varieties of this stone, which are found in
varying shades of yellow, grey, brown, and green, ranging from bright
lively colours to dull cloudy shades, are described generally as
Zircons, although

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

very bright, clear, slightly coloured stones are described as pink or
yellow Jargoons, according to the tint their colour may take. The best
specimens come from India, Ceylon, Bohemia, France, and from Australia.
Bœtius de Boot recommends the Oriental Jacinth, "that comes from Calicut
and Cambray," as a specific for promoting sleep; Marbodus says it makes
its wearer attractive and agreeable, which Barrett in his "Natural
Magic" confirms, adding that if set in gold and worn on the finger it is
a desirable jewel as a solace for a restless brain. Camillus Leonardus,
writing in 1750, says the Jacinth will strengthen weak hearts, dispel
imaginary suspicions, allay jealousy, secure travellers from injuries
and thieves, and protect them from pestilence, plague, and contagious
epidemics.

It was well known to the Ancients, and is considered to be the <span
class="smallcaps">Lyncurion</span> of Theophrastus. The popularity of
this stone in India is as great as ever, and at the present time it is
worn as an antidote against poison, to attract riches, honour, and
wisdom, and to drive away evil spirits.

The virtues attributed to it during the Middle Ages were that it
attracted success, brought welcome to its wearer wherever he went,
stimulated the appetite, and aided digestion, protected from fever,
dropsy, jaundice, and noxious fancies, and

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

restrained from excesses, its efficacy being greatly increased if set in
gold. But neither the Garnet nor Zircon should be worn by those whose
birthdays fall in the Taurus or Scorpio periods.
