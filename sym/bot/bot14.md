### CHAPTER XI

<span class="small">The Agnus Dei—The Coventry Ring—Ananizapta—Tau
Cross—Cross of St. Benedict—Byzantine Ring—Simsum
Ring—Abracadabra—Pentalpha, Pentacle, Pentagram, or Five-pointed
Star—The Kabala—The Table of Jupiter—The Ten Divine Names—The Planetary
Angels—The Agla—Dr. Dee.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Talisman known as the <span
class="smallcaps">Agnus Dei</span> came into use after the Christian
religion had become general; and it is in use at the present day. It
consists of a Lamb carrying a flag and cross, as in Illustration No.
129, [Plate IX](bot13.htm#img_pl09.md), with the motto "Ecce Agnus Dei"
(Behold the Lamb of God). It was made not only in various metals, but in
wax, and is believed to possess the virtue of preserving its wearers
from the danger of accidents, tempests, and pestilence.

<span class="smallcaps">The Coventry Ring</span> is another good example
of a religious Talisman of the fifteenth century, and is illustrated by
No. 128, [Plate IX](bot13.htm#img_pl09.md). The outside is engraved with a
scene representing Our Lord rising from the tomb, with the five wounds
arranged on either side, and the following inscriptions:

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"The Well of Everlastingh Life,"

"The Well of Pitty,"

"The Well of Merci,"

"The Well of Comfort,"

"The Well of Gracy."

</div>

The Five Wounds symbolise the five senses through which we have the
power of wounding Our Lord by yielding to the temptation of the Flesh
and the Devil, and in themselves alone were regarded as an efficacious
Talisman against all evil. Inside the ring is engraved the names of the
Three Kings of Cologne (so named because their relics are preserved at
Cologne), or the Magi—the Three Wise Kings—Caspar, signifying the White
One; Melchior, King of Light; Baltasar the Lord of Treasures; also in
Latin the verse Luke iv. 30, I.H.S.: "Autem transiens per medium illorum
ibat" (Jesus passing through their midst went His way.) This text was
worn as a charm against danger by sea and land, and especially against
dangers from robbers; and to commemorate his escape in the great naval
battle off Sluys in the year 1340 Edward III had this same verse struck
upon his gold nobles.

The sigil <span class="smallcaps">Ananizapta</span> is also engraved
inside the ring and has been translated as meaning, "Have mercy on us, O
Judge"; it was considered a powerful protection against disease,
epilepsy,

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

and intoxication, particularly when associated with the Tau Cross, as in
Illustration No. 133, [Plate X](bot15.htm#img_pl10.md).

<span class="smallcaps">The Cross of St. Benedict</span> was another
popular charm, worn as a protection against disease and dangers. Each
letter stands for a word, the four letters in the angles of the Cross,
making the first line, then the upright of the Cross, next the
horizontal bar, finally the lettering round the outside, as in
Illustration No. 130, [Plate IX](bot13.htm#img_pl09.md).

The following is the Latin text and its translation:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

1\. Crux Sancti Patris Benedicte.  
2. Crux Sancta sit mihi lux.  
3. Ne daemon sit mini dux.  
4. Vade retro Satana,  
   Ne suade mihi vana;  
   Sunt mala quae libas,  
   Ipse venena bibas.

1\. Cross of the Holy Father Benedict.  
2. Holy Cross be my light.  
3. Let no evil spirit be my guide.  
4. Get thee behind me Satan,  
   Suggest no vain delusions;  
   What thou offerest is evil,  
   Thou thyself drinkest poison.

</div>

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

The Ring illustrated on [Plate X](bot15.htm#img_pl10.md), No. 132, is
Byzantine, and was worn as an Amulet for protection against disease and
accident, the grotesque head being against the Evil Eye; the seven
radiating spirits symbolise the seven gifts of the Spirit—Power, Wisdom,
Honour, Glory, Blessing, Strength, and Riches. Round the hoop is
engraved the inscription, "Lord preserve the wearer."

A popular astrological Talisman for good fortune was the formula in
which the word <span class="smallcaps">Simsum</span> was emphasised as
containing the initial letters of each Planet and the Sun in their
relative order, *S*aturni, *J*ovis, *M*artius, *S*olis, *V*eneris,
*M*ercurii—the whole inscription reading:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"Post Simsvm sequitur septuna Luna subest,"

</div>

which has been translated as:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"After possibility follows certainty, the seventh moon is at hand."

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The seventh New
Moon of our Calendar would fall in Cancer, the Moon's own Zodiacal house
in which she is exalted, or at her strongest, and when there marks a
very auspicious time for pushing public affairs or undertaking new
business enterprises (see Illustration No. 137, [Plate
X](bot15.htm#img_pl10).md).

The most famous Talisman, however, of the Middle Ages is the

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Abracadabra</span>, which, says the Rev. C. W.
King, was first mentioned by Serenus Sammonicus, the most learned Roman
of his time, and physician to Caracalla. Serenus Alexander, a great
admirer of Serenus Sammonicus, ordered the word to be written in the
form of an inverted cone, and declares it to be of virtue against all
diseases.

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

<span class="small">"Thou shalt on paper write the spell divine  
 ABRACADABRA called in many a line,  
 Each under each in even order place,  
 But the last letter in each line efface,  
 As by degrees the elements grow few,  
 Still take away but fix the residue,  
 Till at the last one letter stands alone,  
 And the whole dwindles to a tapering cone.  
 Tie this about the neck with flaxen string,  
 Mighty the good 'twill to the patient bring,  
 Its wondrous potency shall guard his head  
 And drive disease and death far from his bed."</span>

</div>

The Illustration No. 136, [Plate X](bot15.htm#img_pl10.md), is from an
example in the British Museum, and the probable origin of this Talisman
is that it is a composition of the Hebrew words
*Ha*—*Brachab*—*Dabarah*—"Speak or pronounce the Blessing"; "Blessing"
standing for "The Blessed One," being equivalent to invoking the Holy
Name of Jehovah.

Defoe mentions this Talisman as being worn written as described, for a
safeguard against infection during the time of the Great Plague, the

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

prescription being that the word *Abracadabra* be written on parchment
and worn for nine days (nine being the number of the Planet Mars ruling
fevers and infectious illnesses generally). It was then to be thrown
backwards before sunrise into a stream running eastward (the East Wind
being also under the influence of the Planet Mars). Another
signification given to the word <span
class="smallcaps">Abracadabra</span> is said to be of Jewish origin, and
means "God sends forth His lightning to scatter His enemies," which
sentence occurs in a Psalm of David. It was also believed to have the
power of curing the toothache, as an extract from an old MS. in the
British Museum contains the following interesting information:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"Mr. Banester sayeth that he healed two hundred in one yer of an ague,
by hanging Abracadbra about their necks, it would stanch blood or heal
the toothache although the parties were ten miles off."

</div>

Other writers affirm that in order to cure mild attacks of ague it is
only necessary to repeat the word <span
class="smallcaps">Abracadabra</span>, dropping each time one letter, but
in severe cases the word was to be written as prescribed and eaten by
the patient!

<span class="smallcaps">The Pentalpha</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Pentacle</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Pentagram</span>, or Five-pointed Star, has always had
very mysterious

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

powers ascribed to it, and Rennet, Bishop of Peterborough, says: "When
it is delineated on the body of a man it points out the five places
wherein the Saviour was wounded, and, therefore, the devils are afraid
of it." No evil spirit could pass where it was displayed, and for this
reason it was always used in magic ceremonies to "bind with," as the
spirits of darkness can have no power over the magician who stands
within this Pentacle or is provided with this symbol. Audrey says: "It
was used by the Christian Greeks (as the sign of the Cross was later),
at the heading of MS. and at the beginning of books for 'good luck's
sake.'"

In the Middle Ages it was looked upon as a symbol of immense power, and
was worn for health and safety, both in the spiritual as well as in the
physical sense; and the magical Pentacle in the western window of the
southern aisle of Westminster Abbey is one of the emblems still existing
to prove that the worshippers of old were deeply read in Occult lore.
Eliphas Levi describes it "as the seal of the Microcosm through which
Man can command the powers and beings of the Elements and restrain
Elementals from evil." In Illustration No. 134, [Plate
X](bot15.htm#img_pl10.md), it is shown with the symbols of the Planets and
the Sacred Names of God which give it added power and efficacy.

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Scott, in
*Marmion*, describing a wizard, also alludes to this Talisman as
follows:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

<span class="small">"His shoon were marked with cross and spell,  
 Upon his breast a pentacle";</span>

</div>

and in Germany it is still considered a Talisman against the powers of
witchcraft.

<span class="smallcaps">The Kabala</span>, the source and inspiration of
numerous Talismans, came into being very soon after the establishment of
the Christian Religion, when the Jewish Rabbis developed a complete
science of Divine things, received, as the name implies, by direct
revelation, according to which all created things from the highest to
the lowest are ruled, through the ten principal names of God, acting
first through the nine orders of the Angelic Hosts and blessed souls,
and through them to the Celestial Spheres, Planets, and Mankind. Lower
degrees of Angels and celestial influences, known as Intelligences,
ruling each element, nation, language, animal and vegetable life,
atmospheric conditions, emotions and aspirations. The early Christians
had great faith and belief in the power of numbers, and their magical
formulas were largely composed of letters having numerical values,
usually expressed in Hebrew. Sometimes Greek letters were used, which,
combined with

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

astrological formulas, attracted the good influences of the Angels and
Intelligences ruling through the Planets, the houses of the Zodiac,
their triplicities and degrees.

One form described as the

<span class="smallcaps">Table of Jupiter</span>, which is illustrated on
[Plate X](bot15.htm#img_pl10.md), Illustration No. 139, contains sixteen
numbers which total up to thirty-four whichever way they are added.
This, with the Divine names around it, is to be made in a plate of
silver when Jupiter is strong, and was worn for riches, favour, peace,
and concord, to appease enemies, and to confer honours and dignities.

The Good Spirits were always working to preserve mankind from the
machinations of Evil Spirits; the Jupiterian Spirits working especially
to preserve Justice and Mercy on Earth. This Talisman may be seen
reproduced in Albrecht Dürer's picture of "Melancholy." The complete set
of the Planetary Tables with their Angels and Intelligences, together
with full instructions for their making, may be found in the Magus by
Francis Barrett.

<span class="smallcaps">The Ten Names</span> of God were used to attract
the virtues and powers they represent, or to accomplish some desire
signified.

The first is the name <span class="smallcaps">Eheia</span>, the essence
of Divinity, influencing the angelic order of Seraphim

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

through whom the gift of being is bestowed on all things.

The second is <span class="smallcaps">Jod</span>, signifying wisdom,
ruling through the order of Cherubim.

The third is <span class="smallcaps">Elohim</span>, signifying
providence and understanding, ruling through the order of Thrones.

The fourth is <span class="smallcaps">El</span>, signifying clemency and
goodness, grace, piety, and magnificence, ruling through the order of
Dominions.

The fifth name is <span class="smallcaps">Elohim Gibor</span>,
signifying power and judgment, ruling through the Seraphim.

The sixth name is <span class="smallcaps">Eloha</span>, meaning Beauty
and Glory, and has power through the order of Virtues.

The seventh name is <span class="smallcaps">Adonai Sabaoth</span>, the
God of Hosts, triumph and victory, justice and eternity, ruling through
the order of Principalities.

The eighth is <span class="smallcaps">Elohim Sabaoth</span>, signifying
Piety and Agreement, ruling through the Archangels.

The ninth is called <span class="smallcaps">Sadai</span>, that is,
Omnipotent, and has influence through the Cherubim, ruling the increase
and decrease of all things.

The tenth name is <span class="smallcaps">Adonai Melech</span>,
signifying Kingdom and Empire, and has rule through

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

the Blessed Souls giving knowledge and understanding.

Very powerful in Talismans were the names of the Angels ruling the
Planets, as follows:

<div align="center">

|         |       |     |          |
|---------|-------|-----|----------|
| Saturn  | ruled | by  | Zaphiel. |
| Jupiter | „     | „   | Zadkiel. |
| Mars    | „     | „   | Camael.  |
| Sun     | „     | „   | Raphael. |
| Venus   | „     | „   | Haniel.  |
| Mercury | „     | „   | Michael. |
| Moon    | „     | „   | Gabriel. |

</div>

Names of power were compounded from letters taken from verses of
Scripture: for example, the <span class="smallcaps">Agla</span> is
formed from the initial letters of the words <span class="smallcaps">Ate
Gebir Leilam Adonai</span>—"Thou art mighty for ever, O Lord"; a popular
charm during the fourteenth century against Fever, frequently found on
rings and brooches of this period. It was used by Dr. Dee, as
illustrated on [Plate X](bot15.htm#img_pl10.md), Illustration No. 138.
