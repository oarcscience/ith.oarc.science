### CHAPTER VII

<span class="small">The Buckle of the Girdle of Isis—The Scarab—The Eye
of Osiris—The Two Fingers—The Collar—The Hawk—The Sma—The Ladder and
Steps—The Snake's Head—The Serpent—The Sun's Disc—The Frog—The Fish—The
Vulture—The Sa, or Tie.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The Buckle of the Girdle of Isis</span> was worn
to obtain the Good Will and Protection of this goddess, and symbolised
"the blood of Isis" and her strength and power. Frequently made of
Carnelian it was believed to protect its wearer from every kind of evil;
also to secure the good will of Horus; and, when placed like the golden
Tat at the neck of the dead on the day of the funeral in the soul's
journey through the under-world it opened up all hidden places and
procured the favour of Isis and her son, Horus, for ever and ever (see
Illustrations Nos. 71, 72, 73, [Plate V](#img_pl05).md).

<span class="smallcaps">The Tie</span>, or <span
class="smallcaps">Sa</span> (Illustration No. 70, [Plate V](#img_pl05).md)
is the symbol of Ta-urt, the Hippopotamus-headed goddess, who was
associated with the god Thoth, the personification of Divine
Intelligence and Human Reason; it was worn for magical protection.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The Scarab</span> was the symbol of Khepera, a
form of the Sun god who transforms inert matter into action, creates
life, and typifies the glorified spiritual body that man shall possess
at the resurrection. From the enormous number of Scarabs that have been
found, this must have formed the most popular of the Talismans. The
symbol was derived from a Beetle, common in Egypt, which deposits its
eggs in a ball of clay, the action of the insect in rolling this ball
along the ground being compared with the Sun itself in its progress
across the sky; and as the ball contained the living germ which, (under
the heat of the Sun,) hatched out into a Beetle, so the Scarab became
the symbol of Creation. It is also frequently seen holding the disc of
the Sun between its claws, with wings extended, and it is thought by
some authorities that the Scarab was taken as an emblem of the Sun,
because the burial of its ball was symbolic of the setting sun from
which new life arises with each dawn.

Scarabs of green stones with rims of gold were buried in the heart of
the deceased, or laid upon the breast, with a written prayer for his
protection on the Day of Judgment, whilst words of power were frequently
recited over the Scarab which was placed under the coffin as an emblem
of immortality so that no fiend could harm the dead in his journey
through the under-world. It is said

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

the Scarab was associated with burial as far back as the IVth dynasty
(about 4600 <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span>); it represented matter
about to pass from a state of inertness into active life, so was
considered a fitting emblem of resurrection and immortality, typifying
not only the Sun's disc, but the evolutions of the Soul throughout
eternity. It was also worn by the Egyptian warriors in their signet
rings for Health, Strength, and Virility, it being thought that this
species of Beetle was all males, so that it would attract all manly
qualities, both of mind and body. For this reason it was very popular as
presents between friends, many scarabs being found with good wishes or
mottoes engraved on the under side, and some of the kings used the back
of scarabs to commemorate historical events; one in the British Museum
records the slaughter of 102 fierce lions by Amenhetep III, with his own
hand (see Illustrations Nos. 74, 75, [Plate VI](#img_pl06).md).

Next to the Scarab, the ancient Egyptians attached much importance to
the

<span class="smallcaps">Eye Amulet</span>, which, from the earliest
Astral Mythology, was first represented by the point within the circle
<span id="img_06800"></span> ![](img/06800.jpg) and was associated with
the god of the Pole Star, which, from its fixity, was taken as a type of
the Eternal, unchangeable as time rolled on, and thus a fitting emblem
of Fixity

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

of Purpose, Poise, and Stability. Later it was one of the hieroglyphic
signs of the Sun god Ra, and represented the One Supreme Power casting
his Eye over all the world, and instead of the point within the circle
is sometimes represented as a widely open Eye. This symbol was also
assigned to Osiris, Isis, Horus, and Ptah; the Amulet known as the Eye
of Osiris being placed upon the incision made in the side of the body
(for the purpose of embalming) to watch over and guard the soul of the
deceased during its passing through the darkness of the tomb to the life
beyond.

It was also worn by the living to ensure Health and Protection from the
blighting influence of workers in black magic, and for the stability,
strength, and courage of Horus, the wisdom and understanding of Ptah,
and the foresight of Isis.

It was also extensively used in necklaces on account of the idea that
representations of the Eye itself would watch over and guard its wearer
from the malignant glances of the envious, it being universally believed
that the fiery sparks of jealousy, hatred, and malice darting from the
eyes of angry persons, envious of the good looks, health, and success of
the fortunate ones, could so poison the surrounding atmosphere as even
to cause sickness, decay, and death; horses were thought particularly
liable to this injurious influence, and Talismans

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

to avert such a misfortune to them were hung on their foreheads, or over
the left eye.

Examples of Eye Amulets are illustrated on [Plate VI](#img_pl06.md), Nos.
79, 80, and 81.

'When two eyes are used together the right eye is symbolic of Ra, or
Osiris and the Sun; whilst the left eye represents Isis, or the Moon,
and is sometimes called the Amulet of the two Utchats: the word Utchat,
signifying "strength," being applied to the Sun when he enters the
summer solstice about June 22nd, his strength and power on earth being
greatest at that time.

The Talisman of the

<span class="smallcaps">Two Fingers</span> (Illustration No. 82, [Plate
VI](#img_pl06).md) was symbolical of Help, Assistance, and Benediction,
typified by the two fingers extended by Horus to assist his father in
mounting the ladder suspended between this world and the next. This
Amulet was frequently placed in the interior of the mummified body to
enable the departed to travel quickly to the regions of the blest.
Amongst the ancient Egyptians the fingers were ever considered an emblem
of Strength and Power, the raising of the first two fingers being
regarded as a sign of Peace and Good Faith; the first finger being the
indicator of divine will and justice and the only one that can stand
erect by itself alone; the second representing the Holy Spirit, the
Mediator, a

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

symbolism handed down to us in the extension of the index and medius in
the ecclesiastical benediction. It is also interesting to note that at
the marriage ceremony in olden days the ring was first placed on the
thumb, as typical of Man's allegiance to God, and lastly on the third
finger of his bride to show that next to God in the Trinity, a man's
life should be devoted to his wife.

<span class="smallcaps">The Collar Amulet</span> (Illustrations Nos. 83,
84, [Plate VI](#img_pl06).md) was a symbol of Isis, and was worn to procure
her protection and the strength of her son Horus. In both examples the
head of the Hawk appears, this bird being attributed to Horus as well as
to Ra. This collar, which was made of gold, was engraved with words of
power and seems to have been chiefly used as a funeral amulet.

<span class="smallcaps">The Sma</span> (Illustration No. 85, [Plate
VI](#img_pl06).md) was a favourite Amulet from the dawn of Egyptian
history, and is frequently used in various forms of decorated art. It
was symbolical of Union and Stability of Affection, and was worn to
strengthen love and friendship and ensure physical happiness and
faithfulness.

<span class="smallcaps">The Ladder</span> is a symbol of Horus, and was
worn to secure his assistance in overcoming and surmounting difficulties
in the material world, as well as to form a connection with the Heaven
world, or Land of Light. The earliest traditions

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

place this Heaven world above the earth, its floor being the sky, and to
reach this a ladder was deemed necessary. From the Pyramid texts it
seems there were two stages of ascent to the upper Paradise, represented
by two ladders, one being the ladder of Sut, forming the ladder of
ascent from the land of darkness, and the other the ladder of Horus
reaching the Land of Light (Illustration No. 86, [Plate VI](#img_pl06).md).

<span class="smallcaps">The Steps</span> (Illustrations Nos. 87, 88,
[Plate VI](#img_pl06).md) are a symbol of Osiris, who is described as the
god of the staircase, through whom it was hoped the deceased might reach
the Heaven world and attain everlasting bliss.

<span class="smallcaps">The Snake's Head</span> Talisman (Illustration
No. 89, [Plate VI](#img_pl06).md) was worn to protect its wearer from the
attacks of Rerek, or Apep, the servant of Set, who was typified as a
terrible serpent, which when killed had the power of rising in new forms
and who obstructed the passage to the Heaven world. The serpent,
although sometimes assumed to be a form of evil, was generally regarded
as a protecting influence, and for this reason was usually sculptured on
either side of the doorways to the tombs of kings, temples, and other
sacred buildings to guard the dead from enemies of every kind, and to
prevent the entrance of evil in any shape or form. It was also placed
round the heads

<span id="img_pl06"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![PLATE 6. EGYPTIAN
TALISMANS.](tn/pl06.jpg)

PLATE 6. EGYPTIAN TALISMANS.  
</span>

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

of Divinities and round the crowns of their kings as a symbol of royal
might and power, being one of the forms or types of Tern the son of
Ptah, who is thought by some authorities to have been the first living
man god of the Egyptians, and the god of the setting sun (in contrast to
Horus, who was the god of the rising sun) Tern was typified by a huge
snake, and it is curious to note in connection with this that amongst
country folk at the present day there is a popular belief that a serpent
will not die until the sun goes down.

<span class="smallcaps">The Sun's Disc</span> Talismans (Illustrations
No. 90, 92, [Plate VII](bot11.htm#img_pl07).md) are symbols of the god Ra,
No. 92 being appropriately placed upon the head of a Ram, the symbol of
the Zodiacal house Aries, in which sign the sun is exalted. It was worn
for Power and Renown, and to obtain the favours of the great ones, being
also an emblem of new birth and resurrection.

<span class="smallcaps">The Frog</span> Talisman (Illustration No. 91,
[Plate VII](bot11.htm#img_pl07).md) was highly esteemed, and is an
attribute of Isis, being worn to attract her favours and for
fruitfulness. Because of its fertility its hieroglyphic meaning was an
immense number. It was also used as a symbol of Ptah, as it represented
life in embryo, and by the growth of its feet after birth it typified
strength from weakness, and was worn for recovery from disease, also for
Health

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

and Long Life, taking the place sometimes of the Crux Ansata or Ankh, as
a symbol of Life.

<span class="smallcaps">The Pillow</span> (Illustration No. 93, [Plate
VII](bot11.htm#img_pl07).md) was used for preservation from sickness and
against pain and suffering; it was also worn for the favour of Horus,
and was placed with the dead as a protection and to prevent violation of
the Tomb.

<span class="smallcaps">The Lotus</span> (Illustrations No. 94, 95,
[Plate VII](bot11.htm#img_pl07).md) is a symbol with two meanings.
Emblematical of the Sun in the ancient days of Egypt and typifying
Light, Understanding, Fruitfulness, and Plenty, it was believed to bring
the favours of the god Ra. Later it is described as "the pure Lily of
the Celestial Ocean," the symbol of Isis, who is sometimes alluded to as
"the White Virgin." It became typical of Virginity and Purity, and
having the double virtue of chastity and fecundity it was alike prized
for Maiden- and Motherhood.

<span class="smallcaps">The Fish</span> Talisman (Illustrations Nos. 96,
97, [Plate VII](bot11.htm#img_pl07).md) is a symbol of Hathor (who
controlled the rising of the Nile), as well as an Amulet under the
influence of Isis and Horus. It typified the primeval Creative principle
and was worn for domestic felicity, Abundance, and general Prosperity.

<span class="smallcaps">The Vulture</span> Talisman (Illustration No.
98, [Plate VII](bot11.htm#img_pl07).md) was worn to protect from the bites
of

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Scorpions, and to
attract Motherly Love and Protection of Isis, who (it was believed)
assumed the form of a vulture when searching for her son Horus, who, in
her absence, had been stung to death by a Scorpion. Thoth, moved by her
lamentations, came to earth and gave her "the Words of Power," which
enabled her to restore Horus to life. For this reason, it was thought
that this Amulet would endow its wearer with power and wisdom so that he
might identify himself with Horus and partake of his good fortune in the
fields of eternal bliss.

<span class="smallcaps">The Sceptre</span> (Illustrations Nos. 76, 77,
78, [Plate VI](#img_pl06).md) is a symbol of Isis, typifying power over the
fruits of the earth, and was worn to preserve and renew youth and
vigour, and to attract physical strength and virility.

It is, of course, difficult and futile to speculate as to the extent of
the influence these Egyptian Amulets and Talismans exercised over this
ancient people, but in the light of our present knowledge we feel that
the religious symbolism they represented, the conditions under which
they were made, the faith in their efficacy, and the invocations and
"words of power" which in every case were a most essential part of their
mysterious composition makes them by far the most interesting of any yet
dealt with.
