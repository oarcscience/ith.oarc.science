<span class="smallcaps">A belief</span> in Talismans and Charms of every
kind is universal in the Orient; written prayers, verses from the Koran,
the name of the Prophet, and even miniature editions of the Koran itself
enclosed in leather or cloth cases, suspended from the neck or tied to
the arm, being the most favoured. The belief in the power of the Evil
Eye is also widespread, and charms of the kind above-recorded are
frequently written on pieces of wood which are fixed to door-posts or
trees in the gardens to prevent the harmful glance from resting on the
house or plants; should the wood crack it is believed that the injury
would have been done had not the glance been intercepted by the Talisman
on guard.

Another charm of great potency is the name

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Jochebed," being
the name of the Mother of Moses. By its constant repetition it is
believed to reveal hidden secrets, unfasten locked doors, and discover
treachery and evil doings.

Whilst necklaces and armlets made of the beads of Kerbela are worn upon
the person, or put into bales of goods to protect them from thieves,
Amulets enclosed in leather are hung on the necks of horses to prevent
them from stumbling. Other Talismans consist of discs of gold, or
silver, with the word "Mashallah" (God is Great) engraved upon them.
These are worn for protection from all calamities, whilst sentences such
as "There is no God but God and Mohammed is his prophet" are also
considered powerful charms. The names of the grandsons of Mohammed,
Hassan and Hussein, engraved on beautifully polished Agate stones, are
suspended from the neck or tied to the arms of children to protect them
from falling. Blue beads are often sewn on the caps of poor children,
and are frequently threaded on the hairs of the tails and manes of
horses, being considered very efficacious in averting ill-wishing. A
hand with one finger extended, not of coral as in the Levant, but of
metal or of blue glass, is worn for the same reason; and at the present
day small hands of blue glass made in this form are tied round the necks
of children or

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

attached to the part of the body to be protected from the Evil Eye. A
hand with thumb and fingers outstretched, known as the Hand of the Lady
Fatima (see Illustration No. 111, [Plate VIII](bot12.htm#img_pl08).md), is
still regarded as a powerful charm amongst all Moslems, and is made in
all metals, often very crude in execution, its material and detail
varying according to the wealth and position of its wearer. This Hand is
regarded as a sacred symbol representing Generosity, Hospitality, Power,
and Divine Providence; as a whole it represents the Holy Family, the
prophet Mohammed being typified by the thumb, the Lady Fatima by the
first finger, Ali, her husband, by the second, and the third and fourth
fingers respectively being allotted to Hassan and Hussein, the sons of
Fatima and Mi. It also serves to keep the faithful in constant
remembrance of the Five Principal Commandments, i.e. to keep the Fast of
Ramadan, to accomplish the Pilgrimage to Mecca, to Give Alms, to Perform
the necessary Ablutions, and to Oppose all Infidels.

Paintings of hands are to be met with throughout Italy, Syria, and
Turkey, Asia, and India as symbols of good luck and for protection from
witchcraft, showing how widespread and universal is the idea of the
efficacy of the human emblem to push away and combat trouble and evil.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

A form of Mussulman Talisman is

<span class="smallcaps">The Zufur Tukiah</span>, or sacred crutch,
single and double, which is formed of a combination of letters making
the name of a saint or holy man, of which three examples are shown on
[Plate VIII](bot12.htm#img_pl08.md). Illustration No. 114 is formed in the
shape of the letters that compose the name <span
class="smallcaps">Nasiree</span>, or the Preserver, one of the names of
God; No. 115 is a double crutch forming the letters that compose the
name <span class="smallcaps">Gadiri</span>, or the Powerful, also one of
the names of God and No. 116 is formed in the shape of the letters which
comprise the name of MOHAMMED. The Talismans of the Shah of Persia are
very numerous, and it is said exceed two hundred, the principal and most
important being the following:

One called <span class="smallcaps">Merzoum</span>, in the shape of a
gold star, is said to have the power of making traitors confess; some
years ago one of the Shah's brothers was suspected of treachery and this
Talisman shown him, when terrified and overcome by remorse, he is said
to have confessed his crime.

Another powerful Talisman is a diamond set in a scimitar which renders
him invincible. He also possesses a cube of Amber, said to have fallen
from Heaven in the time of Mohammed; the virtue of this is to render its
wearer invulnerable if worn round the neck.

Another marvellous charm is a golden box set

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

with emeralds and blessed by the prophet. This is said to render members
of the Royal Family invisible as long as they remain unmarried; the
Shah, however, had numerous wives before he became its possessor, so
that its powers remain untested.

Persians of high rank make use of Rubies, Emeralds, and other Gems, tied
round the arm with pieces of red and green silk, as charms against the
fascinations of the Devil whom they call "Deebs."

No journey is ever undertaken without first consulting a Book of Omens,
each chapter of which begins with a particular letter of the alphabet,
some fortunate and some inauspicious; should they unluckily pitch on one
of the latter the journey is immediately postponed.

Persians have also a curious custom of charming Scorpions, of which,
says Pinkerton, there are great numbers in that country, and they
believe that by making use of a prayer, a person gifted with power of
"binding" (as it is called) can deprive the Scorpion of its sting. To do
this the charmer turns his face towards the sign Scorpio in the heavens,
repeating a special prayer, and at the conclusion of each sentence claps
his hands. After the ceremony his hearers do not scruple to handle
scorpions, so great is their faith in the efficacy of the charm.

#### EARLY CHRISTIAN AND MEDIÆVAL TALISMANS.

At the time of the founding of the Christian religion and onwards
through the Middle Ages the symbols used during the services, certain
texts, mottoes, and prayers were very popular as Talismans. They are
often found in combination with symbols used in preceding religions, and
were worn for protection from temptation and all kinds of perils,
dangers, and diseases.

In the earliest days when open avowal of faith meant peril and
persecution, these Talismans were of great service in making
fellow-believers known to each other, and when Christianity was
established were extensively worn, with the approval of Clement of
Alexandria.

One of the oldest Talismans of this kind is

<span class="smallcaps">The Fish</span>, said to have been adopted
because its Greek name ΙΧΘΥΣ formed the initials of the sentence "Jesus
Christ, Son of God, Saviour." The form of the Fish is very similar to
that used by the Egyptians and is illustrated on [Plate IX](#img_pl09.md),
No. 120.

Another explanation of its use is that in the Talmud the Messiah is
often designated by the name "Dag," the Fish, and the sign of His second
coming, it is said, would be the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in
Pisces, which is the origin of the three fishes interlaced into a

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

triangle, a very popular ornament in mediæval architecture.

<span class="smallcaps">The Palm Branch</span> was another popular
Talisman used to symbolise triumph over sin and temptation; this
undoubtedly was adapted from the pagan mythology, in which the Palm
represented the Sun, and was also a token of victory and success. In
Illustration No. 122, [Plate IX](#img_pl09.md), it is shown surrounding the
Greek name for Fish.

Stones were also frequently used, and although valuable gems were in
use, semi-precious stones such as the Carnelian, Sardonyx, and Jasper
were the most general, the device illustrated on [Plate IX](#img_pl09.md),
No. 126, being cut *in* a Sapphire, the usual method of treatment in
those days being very seldom to cut *in relief*, as in more modern
times.

A favourite gift was a ring with the name of the recipient cut *in* the
stone with some appropriate motto, as in Illustration No. 124, [Plate
IX](#img_pl09): "Rogate, Vivas in Deo" (Rogatus, Live in God.md). Bronze
and silver rings were freely used for this purpose.

<span class="smallcaps">The Ship</span> (Illustration No. 127, [Plate
IX](#img_pl09).md) was a symbol universally used to represent the Church,
and signified the belief of its wearers in their salvation and safety
from temptations of the flesh. It was frequently used in combination
with other symbols, as shown in Illustration No. 127, [Plate
IX](#img_pl09.md),

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

where the Sacred Monogram appears above the deck of the Ship. It is
worthy of note, as the sign which encloses it is probably the Egyptian
symbol of Eternity, <span class="smallcaps">Shen</span>. This monogram
is reputed to have been revealed in a vision to Constantine the Great,
Emperor of Rome, on the evening of the battle in which he overcame <span
class="smallcaps">Manentius</span>. In consequence he adopted it as the
device for the Imperial Standard. It was also commonly used as an
abbreviation of the name of Christ. Nos. 126 and 131 are other examples
of this symbol, and No. 126 is interesting as being in combination with
the Tau Cross, which has been treated fully in a preceding chapter. This
Cross when placed upon the top of a heart signified goodness, and was at
the same time regarded as a Talisman for protection from evil. It was
the monogram of Thoth, the Egyptian god of Wisdom, and when used with a
circle at its base signified the eternal preserver of the world.

The Cross with four arms symbolises the four Cardinal Points, or
Universe, the dominion of the Spirit. Making the sign of the Cross has
always been considered efficacious in the treating of spells, the
exorcising of the Devil, and also as a protection from evil spirits. For
these reasons, in olden days kings and nobles used the sign of the Cross
whether they could write or riot, regarding it as a

<span id="img_pl09"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![PLATE 9. EARLY
CHRISTIAN AND MEDIÆVAL TALISMANS.](tn/pl09.jpg)

PLATE 9. EARLY CHRISTIAN AND MEDIÆVAL TALISMANS.  
</span>

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

symbol of good luck; even at the present time people ignorant of writing
when called upon to sign a document mark it with a cross to show that it
is their mark and deed. The primitive inhabitants of Yucatan prayed to
the Cross as the god of Rain, and in Martin's *Western Islands of
Scotland* we are told that "in the Island of Uist, one of the Outer
Hebrides, opposite St. Mary's Church, there is a stone cross which was
called by the natives the 'Water Cross,' and when they needed rain they
set the cross up, and when sufficient had fallen, they laid it flat upon
the ground."

Illustrated on [Plate IX](#img_pl09) (No. 121.md) is a Cross with Greek
inscription for Life and Health, which is made in the form of a mould,
or stamp; a household Talisman, in all probability used for making an
impression upon bread, or cakes, its size being three and a half inches
each way.

The combination of the Hand and the Cross as a Talisman is one of the
most remarkable of all the composition charms of ancient times against
the Evil Eye, and to break a Cross of this kind, or, in fact, any charm
of this nature, was thought to be most unfortunate.

On ornaments belonging to the later Bronze Age, the Wheel Cross was
symbolic of the Wheels of the Chariot which the Sun was supposed to
drive through the sky; whilst the Golden Wheel

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cross, so often
placed behind the figure of the Saviour, is symbolic of His title as the
"Sun of Righteousness." It was also used on the shields of ancient
warriors as a symbol of the Sun and its worshippers. This same Wheel
Cross, in the shape of a large Waggon Wheel, is said to be still used in
Denmark and Holland, and is placed on the roofs of houses and stables to
entice storks to build their nests thereon, the red legs of the bird
suggesting to the inhabitants that it is a fire bird and will prevent
the building from being destroyed by fire, whilst the wheel will bring
good luck. Even in England the Wheel Cross, in the shape of a brass
ornament, is still to be seen upon the foreheads of fine cart-horses; it
was intended in olden days to ward off witchcraft and the Evil Eye and
to attract Good Fortune.

The Irish Cross is also a type of the Wheel Cross.
