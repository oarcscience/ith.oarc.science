<span class="smallcaps">The</span> Sun enters the Zodiacal House of
Aries on March 21st of each year, and remains in occupation until April
10th, his entrance to this House marking the commencement of the
Zodiacal year, with days and nights of equal length, and also signifying
the advent of Spring.

The Zodiac is an imaginary belt in the heavens which extends for several
degrees on either side of the apparent path of the Sun, called the
Ecliptic, which is divided into twelve sections of thirty degrees each,
known as the Houses of the Zodiac; and it is in this belt that the
planets move and form aspects.

The Sun takes a year to travel through the twelve houses, remaining a
month in each; the months are not, however, the familiar ones of the

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Calendar, but are
for periods from the 21st of one Calendar month to the 10th of the next
approximately. The time of the Sun's entry into <span
class="smallcaps">Aries</span> marks the Zodiacal beginning of the year,
as from this time the days are longer than the nights, and are still
increasing in length; the fact remains, however, that the First of
January was fixed by Act of Parliament as the beginning of the New Year,
although our law-makers in 1752, when re-forming the Calendar, would
have been wiser and more accurate had they fixed the New Year at the
Vernal Equinox instead of adopting the System of the Romans which was
originally formed out of compliment to Julius Cæsar.

The Constellation of Aries is situated in the Northern Celestial
Hemisphere near the Pleiades, between the Constellations of Pisces and
Taurus. In its group it has three very bright stars visible to the naked
eye, the brightest of which is known as <span
class="smallcaps">Hamal</span>, or the Sheep, and was much more
poetically described in the Akkadian tongue as "Dilkur," the dawn
proclaimer. The Chinese have a tradition giving the greatest prominence
to Aries from the fact that it was believed to have occupied the centre
of the heavens at the Creation of the World, a belief that was also held
by the Babylonians.

The Symbol of this House is the Ram (see
[Frontispiece](bot00.htm#img_front), No. 1.md),

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

which in the early religions was considered symbolic of sacrifice, and
in connection with this may be noted the fact that the <span
class="smallcaps">Jewish Passover</span> was commenced in this sign when
Moses was commanded to sacrifice a young Ram, a sacrifice which was the
forecast of our Easter Services. Chemical evidence reveals the fact that
the human body is composed of separate elements, common to all physical
formations, and that the differences between individuals is caused by
different and varying combinations of these elements, portions of which
are vivified to a greater or lesser degree by the Planets of our Solar
System. The influence of this force should be taken into account when
the relative effect of one person's mind qualities, or magnetic
emanations, on any other person is under consideration. Aries rules the
Head and Face, and brain-workers are consequently typical of this sign,
Reason being their ruler, and this the most positive of the twelve
houses. Those born under the influence of Aries *must* be leaders, the
brain being the most active part of their bodies. Having unbounded
confidence in their own abilities when working out their plans,
difficulties are scorned, or even welcomed, for they have the true
Martian spirit—the love of conquest.

Pioneers in thought and action, ever exploring

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

and originating, they bring unflagging energy and fearlessness in
emergency to their pursuits, seeming specially gifted by Nature to tread
the thorny paths of life, making the ways smoother for their weaker
brethren. Their methods must, however, be their own. If required to work
on conventional lines they are never happy, and seldom successful;
understanding what they require, they must be left to accomplish it
according to their own ideas. Optimistic in regard to their enterprises,
difficulties are underrated; but where any matter requires to be dealt
with quickly and promptly, they are at their best.

Aries people are very enthusiastic, brave, venturesome, generous, and
impulsive, self-willed and opinionated, fond of change, romance, and
adventure, ever ready to champion the cause of the weak and suffering,
this tendency frequently leading them to acts of indiscriminate charity
often wasted on undeserving subjects. They have great ideality, are
highly strung, often hypersensitive, with remarkably keen perceptions in
which they are rarely deceived. They are naturally ambitious, and often
lacking in caution; but, as they are ruled by their reasoning powers, it
is in this direction they are open to control and should find their
Zodiacal and Planetary Stones of great benefit to them. In matters of
business, friend-

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

ship, and the affections this type will harmonise best with those
between April 21st and May 21st, July 22nd and August 21st, also
November 22nd and December 10th.

The gems of this House are the Bloodstone and Diamond, which, as a rule,
will not be good for people born between June 21st and July 21st, unless
Mars was very favourable at their birth.

<span class="smallcaps">The Bloodstone</span> is a variety of green
Jasper which derives its distinctive name from a number of blood-red
specks formed by iron oxide with which it is impregnated. It is an
opaque stone, but as its surface is capable of taking a very high
polish, and in consistency being very suitable to the graver, it has
from time immemorial been a great favourite for the cutting of seals and
cameos. It exists in large quantities and is, in consequence,
inexpensive, and is found in India, Bokhara, Siberia, Tartary, and in
the Hebrides.

There is much disagreement between ancient writers with regard to the
Heliotrope and Bloodstone, some asserting there is no difference, the
name Heliotrope having been conferred upon this variety from the idea
that when plunged in water it presents a red reflection of the image of
the Sun; others maintain that the Heliotrope is a translucent

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

green Chalcedony with crimson spots, and the Bloodstone a green Jasper
flecked with red.

An old tradition records that the Bloodstone had its origin at the
Crucifixion, being formed by drops of blood which, following the thrust
of the Roman soldier's spear, fell upon some green jasper on which the
cross was erected, the stains penetrating the stones and thus
originating this particular variety. From this time onwards the stone
seems to have been endowed with magical and divine powers in arresting
hemorrhage from wounds, and was worn by Roman soldiers for this reason;
among the natives of India it is customary to place the Bloodstone
itself upon wounds and injuries after dipping it in cold water. Its
curative properties in this respect have been explained in modern times
by the fact that the iron oxide in this stone is an active and effective
astringent even now used in surgery.

Rings of dark green Jasper flecked with red were favourite ornaments
amongst the Egyptians, who frequently wore them upon the thumb, probably
because the thumb is under Martian influence, Mars being the ruling
planet of the House of Aries.

One of these talismanic stones was worn by

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nechepsos, an
Egyptian king, to strengthen the digestive organs, and was engraved in
the form of a dragon surrounded by rays. The Gnostics wore the
Bloodstone as an Amulet to prolong life, and to make its wearer
courageous and wealthy, as well as to strengthen the stomach and dispel
melancholy; and in the Middle Ages it was considered good for those
engaged in. husbandry and the breeding of cattle.

Amongst the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Bloodstone was worn to bring
renown and the favour of the great; to inspire constancy and endurance,
and as a charm against the bites of scorpions and all venomous
creatures. It was also a great favourite with their athletes, who wore
it as a Talisman for success in the games.

In an essay written by a certain Thomas Boyle on "The Origine and
Virtues of Gems," dated 1675, we read that a gentleman of sanguine habit
having been long troubled with excessive bleeding from the nose, was
unable to find a cure until "an ancient gentleman presented him with a
Bloodstone the size of a pigeon's egg, to be worn round the neck, and
upon the use of this stone he not only cured himself, but stopped
hemorrhage in a neighbour."

Marbodeus Gallus, writing in verse on this stone,

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

after mentioning its virtue against the Ague and Dropsy, says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

<span class="small">"Againe it is believed to be a safeguard frank and
free  
 To such as ware and beare the same; and if it hallowed bee,  
 It makes the parties gratious and mightier too that have it  
 And noysome fancies as they write who ment not to deprave it  
 It doth dispel out of the mind. The force thereof is stronger  
 In silver, if this stone be set, it doth endure the longer."</span>

</div>

The Chinese advise its being set in gold to obtain the best results; and
the Rev. C. W. King tells us that a Bloodstone, engraved with the figure
of a scorpion when the Sun was entering the sign of Scorpio, was
believed by the Ancients to be a sure preservation against the formation
of stone in the bladder.

<span class="smallcaps">The Diamond</span>.—Amongst the many precious
crystallised stones the diamond stands pre-eminent for beauty,
brilliancy, and strength. It is the hardest stone known, hence the name
of *Adamas*, meaning "the Indomitable," given it by its ancient
discoverers, as with it every known substance can be cut, although it
cannot be cut, nor be scratched by other stones; nor have acids nor
solvents any effect upon it. It also resists the action of the file.

When found, the diamond is covered with a thick crust, so hard that
there is no substance

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

known that will remove it but that of itself, and it is only by grinding
and polishing with diamond dust and minute diamonds that it is shaped
and its wonderful brilliancy developed.

It was believed by the old writers to be the most powerful of all
precious stones in its influence and effect upon humanity both
spiritually and physically, and it is connected with marvellous records
of adventure and enterprise, as well as representing Purity, Innocence,
and protection from witchcraft and evil. To this day in India, amongst
natives sufficiently wealthy, tiny diamonds are sprinkled from a white
cloth over the heads of infants during the ceremony of naming the child,
to keep it pure and virtuous.

The Romans also regarded the diamond with much reverence, fastening it
upon the left arm so that the gem should touch the flesh, believing it
powerful in making its wearer brave and daring, giving him the victory
over his enemies; and when set in fine steel, was considered a charm
against insanity.

It was thought by the old astrologers to be particularly powerful when
worn by a subject born under a strong aspect of the planet Mars,
bestowing fortitude, strength of mind, and constancy in wedded love; it
repelled sorcery, poison, and nightmares, calmed anger, and strengthened
friendship.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is often
referred to as the Stone of Reconciliation; and was worn to promote love
and harmony between man and wife.

Sir John Mandeville writes the following:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"A diamond should be worn on the left side of the body for it is of
greater value there than on the right, for the strength of their growing
is towards the North, that is, the left side of the world, and the left
part of a man is when he turns his face to the East."

</div>

Another old writer says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px; margin-right: 32px;">

"He who carries a diamond on the left side shall be hardy and manly; it
will guard him from accidents to the limbs; but nevertheless a good
diamond will lose its power and virtue if worn by one who is
incontinent, or drunken."

</div>

In the Middle Ages the diamond was thought to protect its wearer from
the plague, and for this reason Queen Elizabeth was given a diamond to
guard her against infection, which she is said to have worn in her
bosom. It was a diamond worn in the girdle of Queen Donna Isabel II of
Spain that saved her on the day when the murderous attempt was made upon
her life. The point of the assassin's dagger struck the stone and
glanced off, so the wound, which might otherwise

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

have proved fatal, resulted in a flesh wound only. Napoleon, too,
attached great value to the qualities of the diamond, and wore the
famous <span class="smallcaps">Regent</span> diamond in the hilt of his
sword. The history of this remarkable stone is so curious that a brief
account of its discovery and subsequent owners may be interesting. It
was found at Parteal, south of Golconda, by a slave who concealed it by
making a gash in the calf of his leg and hiding the stone in the folds
of the bandage until he could escape to Madras. Deceived by the promises
made to him by a sailor in whom he had confided, he consented, when a
purchaser had been found for the stone, to share profits, but was thrown
overboard by the seaman, who disposed of the diamond to a dealer named
Jamchund for £1000, which he quickly spent, afterwards hanging himself.

The stone was next purchased by Thomas Pitt, grandfather to the Earl of
Chatham, who purchased it after much bargaining for £20,400; but the
jewel brought him no happiness. So fearful was he of losing it, it is
said that he never slept twice at the same house whilst it was in his
possession; also serious reflections were made on his character as to
when and under what conditions he had obtained it. About the year 1717,
having offered the gem to several sovereigns, the Regent

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

of France was persuaded that his country should possess the most
beautiful and perfect diamond known, so the purchase was effected for
£135,000.

In its natural state it weighed 410 carats, but after its cutting, which
took two years to complete, it was reduced to 137 carats, and was the
size of a large plum, perfectly white, without spot or flaw, and of
admirable water.

In the disorder attendant on the French Revolution the Regent diamond
was stolen from the public treasury. Twelve years afterwards it was
recovered, and subsequently was amongst the stones set in the Imperial
diadem of France.

Another celebrated diamond is the Koh-i-Noor, or "Mountain of Light."
Its history, according to Tavernier, the French traveller, can be traced
back to half a century <span class="smallcaps">B.C.</span> This stone is
reported by Baber, the founder of the Mogul Empire, to have come into
the treasury at Delhi from the conquest of Malwa in 1304, since when it
has passed through the hands of many Indian rulers, who believed that
the safety of their dynasty depended on the possession of this fateful
jewel.

After many vicissitudes it came into the possession of Runjeet Singh
King of Lahore, who wore it on his arm set between two smaller diamonds.
So convinced was he of its mystical

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

powers, that he bequeathed it to the Shrine of Juggernaut so that he
might obtain benefits for his soul after death. His successors, however,
would not allow the treasure to be disposed of in this manner, and it
was subsequently presented to the late Queen Victoria by Lord Dalhousie
on the annexation of the Punjaub, and was brought to London in 1850. The
Brahmins believe that the Crimean War and Sepoy Mutiny, which occurred
seven years afterwards, were due to its influence, and they say that
misfortune will follow the possessor until it is restored to the line of
Vikramaditya; but we are justified in the hope that as England is under
the influence of the Zodiacal House of Aries, the house of the diamond,
our Empire may still flourish and prosper.

Since the Koh-i-Noor came into our possession it has been recut, an
operation which has decreased its size but greatly improved its
brilliancy.

According to ancient lore, *very large* diamonds should never be worn as
ornaments, as they bring disaster and anxiety; nor should they be used
as sleeve-links or buttons or they will bring misfortune and sudden
death. The losing of a diamond was considered (and still is), apart from
its material value, an omen of mishaps. To be efficacious as a Talisman
the diamond should be given freely, never sold, never lent, never
coveted, and never

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

taken by fraud or force. It is a curious fact that large diamonds have
ever brought anxiety and often death to those who have taken them by
violence and sold them; and the strange fatality which, for so many
years, seems to have surrounded the famous HOPE diamond is an example.

The <span class="smallcaps">Hope Diamond</span> was originally owned by
Tavernier, the French traveller, already mentioned. Born in Paris in
1605, he spent some years in the East, traded extensively in precious
stones, and accumulated a vast fortune. In the year 1668 the gem,
subsequently known as "the Hope Diamond," was sold by Tavernier in a
parcel of fine diamonds to Louis XIV, the Grand Monarque. Tavernier was
soon after robbed by his son of an immense sum of money; left destitute,
at the age of eighty-one he died in exile. The King's haughty and
arrogant favourite, the Duchesse de Montespan, prevailed upon her Royal
lover to allow her to wear the dazzling gem at a Court Ball. From that
hour she lost her fascination for the fickle monarch, and the
circumstances of her fall confirmed the sinister superstition as to the
fateful nature of the blue diamond. Most beautiful and most unhappy of
all its wearers was Marie Antoinette. She not only wore it herself, but
lent it to her dearest friend the Princesse de Lamballe.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When Madame de
Lamballe's head was paraded on a pike by the revolutionary mob, and
shown to the King and Queen—then practically prisoners—and when
subsequently the ill-fated Louis XVI perished on the guillotine, and
finally was followed by his Queen, who was driven slowly to the scaffold
so that she should be made to "drink long of death," the superstitious
remembered the reputed curse which the blue diamond was said to bring
upon its possessors. For thirty years after this the ill-fated diamond
was lost to the public gaze, until it was found in the possession of a
lapidary of Amsterdam, whose son stole it from his father and
disappeared, Fals, the gem-cutter, dying in absolute want. The son gave
the jewel to a Frenchman named Beaulieu, and after disposing of it
committed suicide. François Beaulieu brought the gem to London and sold
it to a dealer named Daniel Eliason, Beaulieu himself dying the next day
mysteriously.

Mr. Henry Thomas Hope was the next purchaser, paying Eliason the sum of
£18,000 for it. The stone remained in the Hope family until 1901, when
Lord Francis Hope (who had married and divorced an actress) sold it to a
diamond merchant, who resold it to an American, who, becoming
financially embarrassed, disposed of it to M. Jacques Colot. He in his
turn disposed of it to a

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Russian Prince who
was stabbed; and the French dealer from whom he purchased it ended his
own life. Next a Greek merchant met with a violent death after selling
the diamond to Abdul Hamid, the ex-Sultan of Turkey, who narrowly
escaped with his life after losing his throne. A firm of New York
jewellers next bought the sinister gem, and although a story was
circulated that they had disposed of it to a gentleman who had gone down
in the ill-fated *Titanic*, it is believed to be, at present, in the
possession of Mr. McLean, an American millionaire, to whom so far
nothing untoward has happened.

The preceding paragraph was written in 1914, and in May, 1919, further
proof was given of the strange fatality that accompanies this stone in
the announcement in all European papers of the death of Vincent Walsh
McLean, aged eleven years, who was accidentally killed by a motor-car
whilst playing in the road (having escaped from his nurse) near his
father's estate.

Great importance was attached by the Hindus to the original shape of a
diamond, a triangular stone being thought to cause quarrels, a square
diamond terrors; but a six-cornered stone was thought to bring the best
of good fortune and to renew the strength in old age.
