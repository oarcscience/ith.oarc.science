### ANOTHER OBJECTION.

My objection to orthodox religion is that it destroys human love, and
tells us that the love of this world is not necessary to make a heaven
in the next.

No matter about your wife, your children, your brother, your sister--no
matter about all the affections of the human heart--when you get there,
you will be with the angels. I do not know whether I would like the
angels. I do not know whether the angels would like me. I would rather
stand by the ones who have loved me and whom I know; and I can conceive
of no heaven without the loved of this earth. That is the trouble with
this Christian religion. Leave your father, leave your mother, leave
your wife, leave your children, leave everything and follow Jesus
Christ. I will not. I will stay with my people. I will not sacrifice on
the altar of a selfish fear all the grandest and noblest promptings of
my heart.

Do away with human love and what are we? What would we be in another
world, and what would we be here? Can any one conceive of music without
human love? Of art, or joy? Human love builds every home. Human love is
the author of all beauty. Love paints every picture, and chisels every
statue. Love builds every fireside. What could heaven be without human
love? And yet that is what we are promised--a heaven with your wife
lost, your mother lost, some of your children gone. And you expect to be
made happy by falling in with some angel! Such a religion is infamous.
Christianity holds human love for naught; and yet--

Love is the only bow on Life's dark cloud. It is the morning and the
evening star. It shines upon the babe, and sheds its radiance on the
quiet tomb. It is the mother of art, inspirer of poet, patriot and
philosopher. It is the air and light of every heart--builder of every
home, kindler of every fire on every hearth. It was the first to dream
of immortality. It fills the world with melody--for music is the voice
of love. Love is the magician, the enchanter, that changes worthless
things to Joy, and makes royal kings and queens of common clay. It is
the perfume of that wondrous flower, the heart, and without that sacred
passion, that divine swoon, we are less than beasts; but with it, earth
is heaven, and we are gods.

And how are you to get to this heaven? On the efforts of another. You
are to be a perpetual heavenly pauper, and you will have to admit
through all eternity that you never would have been there if you had not
been frightened. "I am here," you will say, "I have these wings, I have
this musical instrument, because I was scared. That's why I am here. The
ones who loved me are among the damned; the ones I loved are also
there--but I am here, that is enough." What a glorious world heaven must
be! No reformation in that world--not the slightest. If you die in
Arkansas that is the end of you! Think of telling a boy in the next
world, who lived and died in Delaware, that he had been fairly treated!
Can anything be more infamous?

All on an equality--the rich and the poor, those with parents loving
them, those with every opportunity for education, on an equality with
the poor, the abject and the ignorant--and this little day called life,
this moment with a hope, a shadow and a tear, this little space between
your mother's arms and the grave, balances eternity.

God can do nothing for you when you get there. A Methodist preacher can
do more for the soul here than its creator can there. The soul goes to
heaven, where there is nothing but good society; no bad examples; and
they are all there, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, and yet they can do
nothing for that poor unfortunate except to damn him. Is there any sense
in that?

Why should this be a period of probation? It says in the Bible, I
believe, "Now is the accepted time." When does that mean? That means
whenever the passage is pronounced. "Now is the accepted time." It will
be the same to-morrow, will it not? And just as appropriate then as
to-day, and if appropriate at any time, appropriate through all
eternity.

What I say is this: There is no world--there can be no world--in which
every human being will not have the eternal opportunity of doing right.

That is my objection to this Christian religion; and if the love of
earth is not the love of heaven, if those we love here are to be
separated from us there, then I want eternal sleep. Give me a good cool
grave rather than the furnace of Jehovah's wrath. I pray the angel of
the resurrection to let me sleep. Gabriel, do not blow! Let me alone!
If, when the grave bursts, and I am not to meet the faces that have been
my sunshine in this life, let me sleep. Rather than that this doctrine
of endless punishment should be true, I would gladly see the fabric of
our civilization crumbling fall to unmeaning chaos and to formless dust,
where oblivion broods and even memory forgets. I would rather that the
blind Samson of some imprisoned force, released by chance, should so
wreck and strand the mighty world that man in stress and strain of want
and fear should shudderingly crawl back to savage and barbaric night. I
would rather that every planet should in its orbit wheel a barren star!
