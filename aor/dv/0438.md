*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 438.

### OF TREES THAT ARE LIGHTED BY THE SUN AND BY THE ATMOSPHERE.

In trees that are illuminated \[both\] by the sun and the atmosphere and
that have leaves of a dark colour, one side will be illuminated by the
atmosphere \[only\] and in consequence of this light will tend to
blueness, while on the other side they will be illuminated by the
atmosphere and the sun; and the side which the eye sees illuminated by
the sun will reflect light.
