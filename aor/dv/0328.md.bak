### 328.

<span class="margnote"> Proportions of the leg (328-331).</span>The
greatest thickness of the calf of the leg is at a third of its height *a
b*, and is a twentieth part thicker than the greatest thickness of the
foot.

*a c* is half of the head, and equal to *d b* and to the insertion of
the five toes *e f*. *d k* diminishes one sixth in the leg *g h*. *g h*
is 1/3 of the head; *m n* increases one sixth from *a e* and is 7/12 of
the head, *o p* is 1/10 less than *d k* and is 6/17 of the head. *a* is
at half the distance between *b q*, and is 1/4 of the man. *r* is half
way between *s* and *b* <span id="fr_146"></span>[144](#fn_146.md) . The
concavity of the knee outside *r* is higher than that inside *a*. The
half of the whole height of the leg from the foot *r*, is half way
between the prominence *s* and the ground *b*. *v* is half way between
*t* and *b*. The thickness of the thigh seen in front is equal to the
greatest width of the face, that is 2/3 of the length from the chin to
the top of the head; *z r* is 5/6 of 7 to *v*; *m n* is equal to 7 *v*
and is 1/4 of *r b*, *x y* goes 3 times into *r b*, and into *r s*.

 <span id="fr_147"></span>[145](#fn_147.md)

 <span id="fr_148"></span>[146](#fn_148.md) *a b* goes six times into *c f*
and six times into *c n* and is equal to *g h*; *i k l m* goes 4 times
into *d f*, and 4 times into *d n* and is 3/7 of the foot; *p q r s*
goes 3 times into *d f*, and 3 times into *b n*;  <span
id="fr_149"></span>[147](#fn_149.md) *x y* is 1/8 of *x f* and is equal to
*n q*. 3 7 is 1/9 of *n f*; 4 5 is 1/10 of *n f*  <span
id="fr_150"></span>[148](#fn_150.md) .

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

I want to know how much a man increases in height by standing on tip-toe
and how much *p g* diminishes by stooping; and how much it increases at
*n q* likewise in bending the foot.

 <span id="fr_151"></span>[149](#fn_151.md) *e f* is four times in the
distance between the genitals and the sole of the foot;  <span
id="fr_152"></span>[150](#fn_152.md) 3 7 is six times from 3 to 2 and is
equal to *g h* and *i k*.

 <span id="fr_153"></span>[151](#fn_153.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_146"></span>[177:144](0328.htm#fr_146.md) 11: *b* is here and
later on measured on the right side of the foot as seen by the
spectator.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[177:145](0328.htm#fr_147.md) 22-35: The sketch
illustrating these lines is on [Pl. XIII](pl013.htm#img_pl013.md), No. 2.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[177:146](0328.htm#fr_148.md) 22: a b *entra in* c
f 6 *e* 6 *in* c n. Accurate measurement however obliges us to read 7
for 6.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[177:147](0328.htm#fr_149.md) : 25. *y* is not to
be found on the diagram and *x* occurs twice; this makes the passage
very obscure.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[177:148](0328.htm#fr_150.md) : 22-27. Compare
with this lines 18-24 of No. 331, and the sketch of a leg in profile
[Pl. XV](pl015.htm#img_pl015.md).

<span id="fn_151"></span>[178:149](0328.htm#fr_151.md) 34: *e f* 4 *dal
cazo*. By reading *i* for *e* the sense of this passage is made clear.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[178:150](0328.htm#fr_152.md) 35: 2 is not to be
found in the sketch which renders the passage obscure. The two last
lines are plainly legible in the facsimile.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[178:151](0328.htm#fr_153.md) : The drawing of a
leg seen in front [Pl. XIII](pl013.htm#img_pl013.md), No. 1 belongs to the
text from lines 3-21. The measurements in this section should be
compared with the text No. 331, lines 1-13, and the sketch of a leg seen
in front on [Pl. XV](pl015.htm#img_pl015.md).
