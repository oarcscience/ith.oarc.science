<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">WHETHER THE STARS HAVE THEIR LIGHT FROM THE SUN OR IN THEMSELVES.</H3>
<P>
Some say that they shine of themselves, alledging that if Venus and
Mercury had not a light of their own, when they come between our
eye and the sun they would darken so much of the sun as they could
cover from our eye. But this is false, for it is proved that
a dark object against a luminous body is enveloped and entirely concealed by
the lateral rays of the rest of that luminous body and so remains invisible.

<P>when the sun is seen through the boughs of trees bare of their
leaves, at some distance the branches do not conceal any portion of
the sun from our eye. The same thing happens with the above
mentioned planets which, though they have no light of their own, do
not--as has been said--conceal any part of the sun from our eye
[18].

<P>
Some say that the stars appear most brilliant at night in proportion
as they are higher up; and that if they had no light of their own,
the shadow of the earth which comes between them and the sun, would
darken them, since they would not face nor be faced by the solar
body. But those persons have not considered that the conical shadow
of the earth cannot reach many of the stars; and even as to those it
does reach, the cone is so much diminished that it covers very
little of the star's mass, and all the rest is illuminated by the
sun.

it is clear that Leonardo was familiar with
the phenomena of Irradiation.</P>
