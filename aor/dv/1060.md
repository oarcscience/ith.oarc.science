### 1060.

And this may be seen, as I saw it, by any one going up Monbroso  <span
id="fr_244"></span>[578](#fn_244) , a peak of the Alps which divide
France from Italy. The base of this mountain gives birth to the 4 rivers
which flow in four different directions through the whole of Europe. And
no mountain has its base at so great a height as this, which lifts
itself above almost all the clouds; and snow seldom falls there, but
only hail in the summer, when the clouds are highest. And this hail lies
\[unmelted\] there, so that if it were not for the absorption of the
rising and falling clouds, which does not happen more than twice in an
age, an enormous mass of ice would be piled up there by the layers of
hail, and in the middle of July I found it very considerable; and I saw
the sky above me quite dark, and the sun as it fell on the mountain was
far brighter here than in the plains below, because a smaller extent of
atmosphere lay between the summit of the mountain and the sun.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_244"></span>[246:578](1060.htm#fr_244) : I have vainly
enquired of every available authority for a solution of the mystery as
to what mountain is intended by the name Monboso (Comp. Vol. I Nos. 300
and 301). It seems most obvious to refer it to Monte Rosa. ROSA derived
from the Keltic ROS which survives in Breton and in Gaelic, meaning, in
its first sense, a mountain spur, but which also--like HORN--means a
very high peak; thus Monte Rosa would mean literally the High Peak.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[246:579](1060.htm#fr_245) 6: *in una eta.*
This is perhaps a slip of the pen on Leonardo's part and should be read
*estate* (summer).
