*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 46.

The point, being indivisible, occupies no space. That which occupies no
space is nothing. The limiting surface of one thing is the beginning of
another. 2. That which is no part of any body is called nothing. 1. That
which has no limitations, has no form. The limitations of two
conterminous bodies are interchangeably the surface of each. All the
surfaces of a body are not parts of that body.
