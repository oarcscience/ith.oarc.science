*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 943.

### OF CERTAIN PERSONS WHO SAY THE WATERS WERE HIGHER THAN THE DRY LAND.

Certainly I wonder not a little at the common opinion which is contrary
to truth, but held by the universal consent of the judgment of men. And
this is that all are agreed that the surface of the sea is higher than
the highest peaks of the mountains; and they allege many vain and
childish reasons, against which I will allege only one simple and short
reason; We see plainly that if we could remove the shores of the sea, it
would invest the whole earth and make it a perfect sphere. Now, consider
how much earth would be carried away to enable the waves of the sea to
cover the world; therefore that which would be carried away must be
higher than the sea-shore.
