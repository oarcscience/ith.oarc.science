### OF THE SHADOW AND ITS MOTION.

<span class="margnote"> Appendix:--On shadows in movement (211.
212).</span>When two bodies casting shadows, and one in front of the
other, are between a window and the wall with some space between them,
the shadow of the body which is nearest to the plane of the wall will
move if the body nearest to the window is put in transverse motion
across the window. To prove this let *a* and *b* be two bodies placed
between the window *n m* and the plane surface *o p* with sufficient
space between them as shown by the space *a b*. I say that if the body
*a* is moved towards *s* the shadow of the body *b* which is at *c* will
move towards *d*.
