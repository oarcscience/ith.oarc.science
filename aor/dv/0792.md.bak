### OF THE SUPPORTS.

A pillar of which the thickness is increased will gain more than its due
strength, in direct proportion to what its loses in relative height.

### EXAMPLE.

If a pillar should be nine times as high as it is broad--that is to say,
if it is one braccio thick, according to rule it should be nine braccia
high--then, if you place 100 such pillars together in a mass this will
be ten braccia broad and 9 high; and if the first pillar could carry
10000 pounds the second being only about as high as it is wide, and thus
lacking 8 parts of its proper length, it, that is to say, each pillar
thus united, will bear eight times more than when disconnected; that is
to say, that if at first it would carry ten thousand pounds, it would
now carry 90 thousand.
