*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 402.

### WHY, VERY FREQUENTLY, TIMBER HAS VEINS THAT ARE NOT STRAIGHT.

When the branches which grow the second year above the branch of the
preceding year, are not of equal thickness above the antecedent
branches, but are on one side, then the vigour of the lower branch is
diverted to nourish the one above it, although it may be somewhat on one
side.

But if the ramifications are equal in their growth, the veins of the
main stem will be straight \[parallel\] and equidistant at every degree
of the height of the plant.

Wherefore, O Painter! you, who do not know these laws! in order to
escape the blame of those who understand them, it will be well that you
should represent every thing from nature, and not despise such study as
those do who work \[only\] for money.
