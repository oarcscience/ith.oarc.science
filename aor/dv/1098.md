### 1098.

It is not denied that the Nile is constantly muddy in entering the
Egyptian sea and that its turbidity is caused by soil that this river is
continually bringing from the places it passes; which soil never returns
in the sea which receives it, unless it throws it on its shores. You see
the sandy desert beyond Mount Atlas where formerly it was covered with
salt water.
