*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 581.

Of composing historical pictures. Of not considering the limbs in the
figures in historical pictures; as many do who, in the wish to represent
the whole of a figure, spoil their compositions. And when you place one
figure behind another take care to draw the whole of it so that the
limbs which come in front of the nearer figures may stand out in their
natural size and place.
