*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 809.

<span class="margnote"> On corpulency and leanness (809-811).</span>Make
the rule and give the measurement of each muscle, and give the reasons
of all their functions, and in which way they work and what makes them
work &c

\[4\] First draw the spine of the back; then clothe it by degrees, one
after the other, with each of its muscles and put in the nerves and
arteries and veins to each muscle by itself; and besides these note the
vertebrae to which they are attached; which of the intestines come in
contact with them; and which bones and other organs &c

The most prominent parts of lean people are most prominent in the
muscular, and equally so in fat persons. But concerning the difference
in the forms of the muscles in fat persons as compared with muscular
persons, it shall be described below.
