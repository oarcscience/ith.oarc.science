*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 30.

<span class="margnote"> The comparative size of the image depends on the
amount of light (30-39).</span>The eye will hold and retain in itself
the image of a luminous body better than that of a shaded object. The
reason is that the eye is in itself perfectly dark and since two things
that are alike cannot be distinguished, therefore the night, and other
dark objects cannot be seen or recognised by the eye. Light is totally
contrary and gives more distinctness, and counteracts and differs from
the usual darkness of the eye, hence it leaves the impression of its
image.
