*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 476.

When clouds come between the sun and the eye all the upper edges of
their round forms are light, and towards the middle they

are dark, and this happens because towards the top these edges have the
sun above them while you are below them; and the same thing happens with
the position of the branches of trees; and again the clouds, like the
trees, being somewhat transparent, are lighted up in part, and at the
edges they show thinner.

But, when the eye is between the cloud and the sun, the cloud has the
contrary effect to the former, for the edges of its mass are dark and it
is light towards the middle; and this happens because you see the same
side as faces the sun, and because the edges have some transparency and
reveal to the eye that portion which is hidden beyond them, and which,
as it does not catch the sunlight like that portion turned towards it,
is necessarily somewhat darker. Again, it may be that you see the
details of these rounded masses from the lower side, while the sun
shines on the upper side and as they are not so situated as to reflect
the light of the sun, as in the first instance they remain dark.

The black clouds which are often seen higher up than those which are
illuminated by the sun are shaded by other clouds, lying between them
and the sun.

Again, the rounded forms of the clouds that face the sun, show their
edges dark because they lie against the light background; and to see
that this is true, you may look at the top of any cloud that is wholly
light because it lies against the blue of the atmosphere, which is
darker than the cloud.
