*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1108.

<span class="margnote"> The Dardanelles.</span>In the Bosphorus the
Black Sea flows always into the Egean sea, and the Egean sea never flows
into it. And this is because the Caspian, which is 400 miles to the
East, with the rivers which pour into it, always flows through
subterranean caves into this sea of Pontus; and the Don does the same as
well as the Danube, so that the waters of Pontus are always higher than
those of the Egean; for the higher always fall towards the lower, and
never the lower towards the higher.
