*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1153.

Experience never errs; it is only your judgments that err by promising
themselves effects such as are not caused by your experiments.

Experience does not err; only your judgments err by expecting from her
what is not in her power. Men wrongly complain of Experience; with great
abuse they accuse her of leading them astray but they set

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Experience aside,
turning from it with complaints as to our ignorance causing us to be
carried away by vain and foolish desires to promise ourselves, in her
name, things that are not in her power; saying that she is fallacious.
Men are unjust in complaining of innocent Experience, constantly
accusing her of error and of false evidence.
