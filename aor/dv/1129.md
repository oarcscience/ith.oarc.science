<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

A square drum of which the parchment may be drawn tight or slackened by
the lever *a b* \[5\].

A drum for harmony \[6\].

parchments variously tightened on one and the same drum will make
various sounds \[16\].

*a* must enter in the place of the ordinary keys which have the ... in
the openings of a flute.
