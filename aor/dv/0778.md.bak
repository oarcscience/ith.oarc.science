### ON THE SHRINKING OF DAMP BODIES OF DIFFERENT THICKNESS AND WIDTH.

The window *a* is the cause of the crack at *b*; and this crack is
increased by the pressure of *n* and *m* which sink or penetrate into
the soil in which foundations are built more than the lighter portion at
*b*. Besides, the old foundation under *b* has already settled, and this
the piers *n* and *m* have not yet done. Hence the part *b* does not
settle down perpendicularly; on the contrary, it is thrown outwards
obliquely, and it cannot on the contrary be thrown inwards, because a
portion like this, separated from the main wall, is larger outside than
inside and the main wall, where it is broken, is of the same shape and
is also larger outside than inside; therefore, if this separate portion
were to fall inwards the larger would have to pass through the
smaller--which is impossible. Hence it is evident that the portion of
the semicircular wall when disunited from the main wall will be thrust
outwards, and not inwards as the adversary says.

When a dome or a half-dome is crushed from above by an excess of weight
the vault will give way, forming a crack which diminishes towards the
top and is wide below, narrow on the inner side and wide outside; as is
the case with the outer husk of a pomegranate, divided into many parts
lengthwise; for the more it is pressed in the direction of its length,
that part of the joints will open most, which is most distant from the
cause of the pressure; and for that reason the arches of the vaults of
any apse should never be more loaded than the arches of the principal
building. Because that which weighs most, presses most on the parts
below, and they sink into the foundations; but this cannot happen to
lighter structures like the said apses.

Which of these two cubes will shrink the more uniformly: the cube *A*
resting on the pavement, or the cube *b* suspended in the air, when both
cubes are equal in weight and bulk, and of clay mixed with equal
quantities of water?

The cube placed on the pavement diminishes more in height than in
breadth, which the cube above, hanging in the air, cannot do. Thus it is
proved. The cube shown above is better shown here below.

The final result of the two cylinders of damp clay that is *a* and *b*
will be the pyramidal figures below *c* and *d*. This is proved thus:
The cylinder *a* resting on block of stone being made of clay mixed with
a great deal of water will sink by its weight, which presses on its
base, and in proportion as it settles and spreads all the parts will be
somewhat nearer to the base because that is charged with the whole
weight.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_69"></span>[84:403](0778.htm#fr_69.md) : The figure on [Pl.
CV](pl105.htm#img_pl105.md), No. 4 belongs to the first paragraph of this
passage, lines 1-14; fig. 5 is sketched by the side of lines l5--and
following. The sketch below of a pomegranate refers to line 22. The
drawing fig. 6 is, in the original, over line 37 and fig. 7 over line
54.
