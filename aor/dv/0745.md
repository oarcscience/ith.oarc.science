*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 745.

The front *a m* will give light to the rooms; *a e* will be 6
braccia--*a b* 8 braccia --*b e* 30 braccia, in order that the rooms
under the porticoes may be lighted; *c d f* is the place where the boats
come to the houses to be unloaded. In order to render this arrangement
practicable, and in order that the inundation of the rivers may not
penetrate into the cellars, it is necessary to chose an appropriate
situation, such as a spot near a river which can be diverted into canals
in which the level of the water will not vary either by inundations or
drought. The construction is shown below; and make choice of a fine
river, which the rains do not render muddy, such as the Ticino, the Adda
and many others.  <span id="fr_22"></span>[356](#fn_22.md) The construction

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

to oblige the waters to keep constantly at the same level will be a sort
of dock, as shown below, situated at the entrance of the town; or better
still, some way within, in order that the enemy may not destroy it
\[14\].

left hand side and within the sketch given on [Pl.
LXXIX](pl079.htm#img_pl079.md), No. 1. Then follows after line 14, the
drawing of a sluicegate--*conca*--of which the use is explained in the
text below it. On the page 38a, which comes next in the original MS. is
the sketch of an oval plan of a town over which is written "*modo di
canali per la citta*" and through the longer axis of it "*canale
magior*" is written with "*Tesino*" on the prolongation of the canal. J.
