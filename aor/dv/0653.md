*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 653.

### THAT PAINTING SURPASSES ALL HUMAN WORKS BY THE SUBTLE CONSIDERATIONS BELONGING TO IT.

<span class="margnote"> Painting is superior to poetry (653.
654).</span>The eye, which is called the window of the soul, is the
principal means by which the central sense can most completely and
abundantly appreciate the infinite works of nature; and the ear is the
second, which acquires dignity by hearing of the things the eye has
seen. If you, historians, or poets, or mathematicians had not seen
things with your eyes you could not report of them in writing. And if
you, 0 poet, tell a story with your pen, the painter with his brush can
tell it more easily, with simpler completeness and less tedious to be
understood. And if you call painting dumb poetry, the painter may call
poetry blind painting. Now which is the worse defect? to be blind or
dumb? Though the poet is as free as the painter in the invention of his
fictions they are not so satisfactory to men as paintings; for, though
poetry is able to describe forms, actions and places in words, the
painter deals with the actual similitude of the forms, in order to
represent them. Now tell me which is the nearer to the actual man: the
name of man or the image of the man. The name of man differs in
different countries, but his form is never changed but by death.
