*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 826.

### OF THE WAY OF WALKING IN MAN.

The walking of man is always after the universal manner of walking in
animals with 4 legs, inasmuch as just as they move their feet crosswise
after the manner of a horse in trotting, so man moves his 4 limbs
crosswise; that is, if he puts forward his right foot in walking he puts
forward, with it, his left arm and vice versa, invariably.
