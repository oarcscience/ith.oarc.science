*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 978.

All the torrents of water flowing from the mountains to the sea carry
with them the stones from the hills to the sea, and by the influx of the
sea-water towards the mountains; these stones were thrown back towards
the mountains, and as the waters rose and retired, the stones were
tossed about by it and in rolling, their angles hit together; then as
the parts, which least resisted the blows, were worn off, the stones
ceased to be angular and became round in form, as may be seen on the
banks of the Elsa. And those remained larger which were less removed

from their native spot; and they became smaller, the farther they were
carried from that place, so that in the process they were converted into
small pebbles and then into sand and at last into mud. After the sea had
receded from the mountains the brine left by the sea with other humours
of the earth made a concretion of these pebbles and this sand, so that
the pebbles were converted into rock and the sand into tufa. And of this
we see an example in the Adda where it issues from the mountains of Como
and in the Ticino, the Adige and the Oglio coming from the German Alps,
and in the Arno at Monte Albano  <span id="fr_183"></span>[517](#fn_183)
, near Monte Lupo and Capraia where the rocks, which are very large, are
all of conglomerated pebbles of various kinds and colours.
