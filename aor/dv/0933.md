### 933.

<span class="margnote"> Of the surface of the water in relation to the
globe (933-936).</span>The centres of the sphere of water are two, one
universal and common to all water, the other particular. The universal
one is that which is common to all waters not in motion, which exist in
great quantities. As canals, ditches, ponds, fountains, wells, dead
rivers, lakes, stagnant pools and seas, which, although they are at
various levels, have each in itself the limits of their superficies
equally distant from the centre of the earth, such as lakes placed at
the tops of high mountains; as the lake near Pietra Pana and the lake of
the Sybil near Norcia; and all the lakes that give rise to great rivers,
as the Ticino from Lago Maggiore, the Adda from the lake of Como, the
Mincio from the lake of Garda, the Rhine from the lakes of Constance and
of Chur, and from the lake of Lucerne, like the Tigris which passes
through Asia Minor carrying with it the waters of three lakes, one above
the other at different heights of which the highest is Munace, the
middle one Pallas, and the lowest Triton; the Nile again flows from
three very high lakes in Ethiopia.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_162"></span>[181:496](0933.htm#fr_162.md) 5: *Pietra Pana*, a
mountain near Florence. If for Norcia, we may read Norchia, the remains
of the Etruscan city near Viterbo, there can be no doubt that by '*Lago
della Sibilla*'--a name not known elsewhere, so far as I can
learn--Leonardo meant *Lago di Vico* (Lacus Ciminus, Aen. 7).
