*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1325.

Flax is dedicated to death, and to the corruption of mortals. To death,
by being used for snares and nets for birds, animals and fish; to
corruption, by the flaxen sheets in which the dead are wrapped when they
are buried, and who become corrupt in these winding sheets.-- And again,
this flax does not separate its fibre till it has begun to steep and
putrefy, and this is the flower with which garlands and decorations for
funerals should be made.
