*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 224.

Every visible body, in so far as it affects the eye, includes three
attributes; that is to say: mass, form and colour; and the mass is
recognisable at a greater distance from the place of its actual
existence than either colour or form. Again, colour is discernible at a
greater distance than form, but this law does not apply to luminous
bodies.

<span class="margnote"> An illustration by experiment.</span>The above
proposition is plainly shown and proved by experiment; because: if you
see a man close to you, you discern the exact appearance of the mass and
of the form and also of the colouring; if he goes to some distance you
will not recognise who he is, because the character of the details will
disappear, if he goes still farther you will not be able to distinguish
his colouring, but he will appear as a dark object, and still farther he
will appear as a very small dark rounded object. It appears rounded
because distance so greatly diminishes the various details that nothing
remains visible but the larger mass. And the reason is this: We know
very well that all the images of objects reach the senses by a small
aperture in the eye; hence, if the whole horizon *a d* is admitted
through such an aperture, the object *b c* being but a very small
fraction of this horizon what space can it fill in that

minute image of so vast a hemisphere? And because luminous bodies have
more power in darkness than any others, it is evident that, as the
chamber of the eye is very dark, as is the nature of all colored
cavities, the images of distant objects are confused and lost in the
great light of the sky; and if they are visible at all, appear dark and
black, as every small body must when seen in the diffused light of the
atmosphere.
