### 214.

No small hole can so modify the convergence of rays of light as to
prevent, at a long distance, the transmission of the true form of the
luminous body causing them. It is impossible that rays of light passing
through a parallel \[slit\], should not display the form of the body
causing them, since all the effects produced by a luminous body are \[in
fact\] the reflection of that body: The moon, shaped like a boat, if
transmitted through a hole is figured in the surface \[it falls on\] as
a boatshaped object.  <span id="fr_104"></span>[102](#fn_104) Why the
eye sees bodies at a distance, larger than they measure on the vertical
plane?.

On gradation of shadows (215. 216).
