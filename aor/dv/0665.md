### 665.

<span class="margnote"> Notes on the Last Supper (665-668).</span>One
who was drinking and has left the glass in its position and turned his
head towards the speaker.

Another, twisting the fingers of his hands together turns with stern
brows to his companion \[6\]. Another with his hands spread open shows
the palms, and shrugs his shoulders up his ears making a mouth of
astonishment \[8\].

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

\[9\] Another speaks into his neighbour's ear and he, as he listens to
him, turns towards him to lend an ear \[10\], while he holds a knife in
one hand, and in the other the loaf half cut through by the knife.
\[13\] Another who has turned, holding a knife in his hand, upsets with
his hand a glass on the table \[14\].

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_303"></span>[347:301](0665.htm#fr_303.md) 665, 666: In the
original MS. there is no sketch to accompany these passages, and if we
compare them with those drawings made by Leonardo in preparation for the
composition of the picture--[Pl. XLV](pl045.htm#img_pl045.md),
[XLVI](pl046.htm#img_pl046.md)--, (compare also [Pl.
LII](pl052.htm#img_pl052), 1 and the drawings on p. 297.md) it is
impossible to recognise in them a faithful interpretation of the whole
of this text; but, if we compare these passages with the finished
picture (see p. 334) we shall see that in many places they coincide. For
instance, compare No. 665, 1. 6--8, with the fourth figure on the right
hand of Christ. The various actions described in lines 9--10, 13--14 are
to be seen in the group of Peter, John and Judas; in the finished
picture however it is not a glass but a salt cellar that Judas is
upsetting.
