### 595.

### OF THE DISPOSITION OF LIMBS.

As regards the disposition of limbs in movement you will have to
consider that when you wish to represent a man who, by some chance, has
to turn backwards or to one side, you must not make him move his feet
and all his limbs towards the side to which he turns his head. Rather
must you make the action proceed by degrees and through the different
joints; that is, those of the foot, the knee and the hip and the neck.
And if you set him on the right leg, you must make the left knee bend
inwards, and let his foot be slightly raised on the outside, and the
left shoulder be somewhat lower than the right, while the nape of the
neck is in a line directly over the outer ancle of the left foot. And
the left shoulder will be in a perpendicular line above the toes of the
right foot. And always set your figures so that the side to which the
head turns is not the side to which the breast faces, since nature for
our convenience has made us with a neck which bends with ease in many
directions, the eye wishing to turn to various points, the different
joints. And if at any time you make a man sitting with his arms at work
on something which is sideways to him, make the upper part of his body
turn upon the hips.
