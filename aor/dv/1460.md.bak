  1493. On the 1st day of November we settled accounts. Giulio had to
pay 4 months; and Maestro Tommaso 9 months; Maestro Tommaso afterwards
made 6 candlesticks, 10 days' work; Giulio some fire-tongs 15 days work.
Then he worked for himself till the 27th May, and worked for me at a
lever till the 18th July; then for himself till the 7th of August, and
for one day, on the fifteenth, for a lady. Then again for me at 2 locks
until the 20th of August.
