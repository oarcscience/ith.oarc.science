*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 802.

When you have finished building up the man, you will make the statue
with all its superficial measurements.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_84"></span>[112:418](0802.htm#fr_84.md) : *Cresciere l'omo*.
The meaning of this expression appears to be different here and in the
passage C.A. 157a, 468a (see No. 526, Note 1. 2). Here it can hardly
mean anything else than modelling, since the sculptor forms the figure
by degrees, by adding wet clay and the figure consequently increases or
grows. *Tu farai la statua* would then mean, you must work out the
figure in marble. If this interpretation is the correct one, this
passage would have no right to find a place in the series on anatomical
studies. I may say that it was originally inserted in this connection
under the impression that *di cresciere* should be read *descrivere*.
