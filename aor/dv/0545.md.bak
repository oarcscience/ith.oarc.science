*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 545.

If you cannot arrange that those who look at your work should stand at
one particular point, when constructing your work, stand back until your
eye is at least 20 times as far off as the greatest height and width of
your work. This will make so little difference when the eye of the
spectator moves, that it will be hardly appreciable, and it will look
very good.

If the point of sight is at *t* you would make the figures on the circle
*d b e* all

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

of one size, as each of them bears the same relation to the point *t*.
But consider the diagram given below and you will see that this is
wrong, and why I shall make *b* smaller than *d e*  <span
id="fr_260"></span>[258](#fn_260.md) .

It is easy to understand that if 2 objects equal to each other are
placed side by side the one at 3 braccia distance looks smaller than
that placed at 2 braccia. This however is rather theoretical than for
practice, because you stand close by  <span
id="fr_261"></span>[259](#fn_261.md) .

All the objects in the foreground, whether large or small, are to be
drawn of their proper size, and if you see them from a distance they
will appear just as they ought, and if you see them close they will
diminish of themselves.

 <span id="fr_262"></span>[260](#fn_262.md) Take care that the vertical
plan on which you work out the perspective of the objects seen is of the
same form as the wall on which the work is to be executed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_260"></span>[274:258](0545.htm#fr_260.md) 8: The second
diagram of this chapter stands in the original between lines 8 and 9.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[274:259](0545.htm#fr_261.md) 11: Instead of '*se
preso*' (=*sie presso*) M. RAVAISSON reads '*sempre se*' which gives
rise to the unmeaning rendering: '*parceque toujours* ...'

<span id="fn_262"></span>[274:260](0545.htm#fr_262.md) 15: Compare No. 526
line 18.
