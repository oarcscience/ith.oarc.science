### 728.

### OF TAKING CASTS OF MEDALS.

A paste of emery mixed with aqua vitae, or iron filings with vinegar, or
ashes of walnut leaves, or ashes of straw very finely powdered.

The diameter is given in the lead enclosed; it is beaten with a hammer
and several times extended; the lead is folded and kept wrapped up in
parchment so that the powder may not be spilt; then melt the lead, and
the powder will be on the top of the melted lead, which must then be
rubbed between two plates of steel till it is thoroughly pulverised;
then wash it with aqua fortis, and the blackness of the iron will be
dissolved leaving the powder clean.

Emery in large grains may be broken by putting it on a cloth many times
doubled, and hit it sideways with the hammer, when it will break up;
then mix it little by little and it can be founded with ease; but if you
hold it on the anvil you will never break it, when it is large.

Any one who grinds smalt should do it on plates of tempered steel with a
cone shaped grinder; then put it in aqua fortis, which melts away the
steel that may have been worked up and mixed with the smalt, and which
makes it black; it then remains purified and clean; and if you grind it
on porphyry the porphyry will work up and mix with the smalt and spoil
it, and aqua fortis will never remove it because it cannot dissolve the
porphyry.

If you want a fine blue colour dissolve the smalt made with tartar, and
then remove the salt.

Vitrified brass makes a fine red.
