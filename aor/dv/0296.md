The medium lying between the eye and the object seen, tinges that object
with its colour, as the blueness of the atmosphere makes the distant
mountains appear blue and red glass makes objects seen beyond it, look
red. The light shed round them by the stars is obscured by the darkness
of the night which lies between the eye and the radiant light of the
stars.
