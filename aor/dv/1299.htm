<P>
Blood will be seen issuing from the torn flesh of men, and trickling
down the surface.
<P>
Men will have such cruel maladies that they will tear their flesh
with their own nails. (The Itch.)
<P>
Plants will be seen left without leaves, and the rivers standing
still in their channels.
<P>
The waters of the sea will rise above the high peaks of the
mountains towards heaven and fall again on to the dwellings of men.
(That is, in Clouds.)
<P>
The largest trees of the forest will be seen carried by the fury of
the winds from East to West. (That is across the Sea.)
<P>
Men will cast away their own victuals. (That is, in Sowing.)
