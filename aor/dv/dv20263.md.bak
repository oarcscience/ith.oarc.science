### Physical Geography.

Leonardo's researches as to the structure of the earth and sea were made
at a time, when the extended voyages of the Spaniards and Portuguese had
also excited a special interest in geographical questions in Italy, and
particularly in Tuscany. Still, it need scarcely surprise us to find
that in deeper questions, as to the structure of the globe, the
primitive state of the earth's surface, and the like, he was far in
advance of his time.

The number of passages which treat of such matters is relatively
considerable; like almost all Leonardo's scientific notes they deal
partly with theoretical and partly with practical questions. Some of his
theoretical views of the motion of water were collected in a copied
manuscript volume by an early transcriber, but without any
acknowledgment of the source whence they were derived. This copy is now
in the Library of the Barberini palace at Rome and was published under
the title: "De moto e misura dell'acqua," by FRANCESCO CARDINALI,
Bologna 1828. *In this work the texts are arranged under the following
titles:* Libr. I. Della spera dell'acqua; Libr. II. Del moto dell'acqua;
Libr. III. Dell'onda dell'acqua; Libr. IV. Dei retrosi d'acqua; Libr. V.
Dell'acqua cadente; Libr. VI. Delle rotture fatte dall'acqua; Libr. VII
Delle cose portate dall'acqua; Libr. VIII. Dell'oncia dell'acqua e delle
canne; Libr. IX. De molini e d'altri ordigni d'acqua.

*The large number of isolated observations scattered through the
manuscripts, accounts for our so frequently finding notes of new schemes
for the arrangement of those relating to water and its motions,
particularly in the Codex Atlanticus: I have printed several of these
plans as an introduction to the Physical Geography, and I have actually
arranged the texts in accordance with the clue afforded by one of them
which is undoubtedly one of the latest notes referring to the subject
(No.* 920*). The text given as No.* 930 *which is also taken from a late
note-book of Leonardo's, served as a basis for the arrangement of the
first of the seven books--or sections--, bearing the title: Of the
Nature of Water* (Dell'acque in se).

*As I have not made it any part of this undertaking to print the
passages which refer to purely physical principles, it has also been
necessary to exclude those practical researches which, in accordance
with indications given in* 920, *ought to come in as Books* 13, 14 *and*
15. *I can only incidentally mention here that Leonardo--as it seems to
me, especially in his youth--devoted a great deal of attention to the
construction of mills. This is proved by a number of drawings of very
careful and minute execution, which are to be found in the Codex
Atlanticus. Nor was it possible to include his considerations on the
regulation of rivers, the making of canals and so forth (No.* 920,
*Books* 10, 11 *and* 12*); but those passages in which the structure of
a canal is directly connected with notices of particular places will be
found duly inserted under section XVII (Topographical notes). In Vol. I,
No.* 5 *the text refers to canal-making in general.*

*On one point only can the collection of passages included under the
general heading of Physical Geography claim to be complete. When
comparing and sorting the materials for this work I took particular care
not to exclude or omit any text in which a geographical name was
mentioned even incidentally, since in all such researches the chief
interest, as it appeared to me, attached to the question whether these
acute observations on the various local characteristics of mountains,
rivers or seas, had been made by Leonardo himself, and on the spot. It
is self-evident that the few general and somewhat superficial
observations on the Rhine and the Danube, on England and Flanders, must
have been obtained from maps or from some informants, and in the case of
Flanders Leonardo himself acknowledges this (see No.* 1008*). But that
most of the other and more exact observations were made, on the spot, by
Leonardo himself, may be safely assumed from their method and the style
in which he writes of them; and we should bear it in mind that in all
investigations, of whatever kind, experience is always spoken of as the
only basis on which he relies. Incidentally, as in No.* 984, *he thinks
it necessary to allude to the total absence of all recorded
observations.*
