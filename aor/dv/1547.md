*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1547.

Johannes Antonius di Johannes Ambro- sius de Bolate. He who lets time
pass and does not grow in virtue, the more I think of it the more I
grieve. No man has it in him to be virtuous who will give up honour for
gain. Good fortune is valueless to him who knows not toil. The man
becomes happy who follows Christ. There is no perfect gift without great
suffering. Our glories and our triumphs pass away. Foul lust, and
dreams, and luxury, and sloth have banished every virtue from the world;
so that our Nature, wandering and perplexed, has almost lost the old and
better track. Henceforth it were well to rouse thyself from sleep. The
master said that lying in down will not bring thee to Fame; nor staying
beneath the quilts. He who, without Fame, burns his life to waste,
leaves no more vestige of himself on earth than wind-blown smoke, or the
foam upon the sea.  <span id="fr_554"></span>[854](#fn_554) Section

<span id="fn_554"></span>[463:854](1547.htm#fr_554) : From the last
sentence we may infer that this text is by the hand of a pupil of
Leonardo's.-- On the same sheet are the notes Nos.1175 and 715 in
Leonardo's own handwriting.
