*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1218.

The watery element was left enclosed between the raised banks of the
rivers, and the sea was seen between the uplifted earth and the
surrounding air which has to envelope and enclose the complicated
machine of the earth, and whose mass, standing between the water and the
element of fire, remained much restricted and deprived of its
indispensable moisture; the rivers will be deprived of their waters, the
fruitful earth will put forth no more her light verdure; the fields will
no more be decked with waving corn; all the animals, finding no fresh
grass for pasture, will die and food will then be lacking to the lions
and wolves and other beasts of prey, and to men who after many efforts
will be compelled to abandon their life, and the human race will die
out. In this way the fertile and fruitful earth will remain deserted,
arid and sterile from the water being shut up in its interior, and from
the activity of nature it will continue a little time to increase until
the cold and subtle air being gone, it will be forced to end with the
element of fire; and then its surface will be left burnt up to cinder
and this will be the end of all terrestrial nature.
