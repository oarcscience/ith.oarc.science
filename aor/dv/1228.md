### 1228.

### FIDELITY, OR LOYALTY.

The cranes are so faithful and loyal to their king, that at night, when
he is sleeping, some of them go round the field to keep watch at a
distance; others remain near, each holding a stone in his foot, so that
if sleep should overcome them, this stone would fall and make so much
noise that they would wake up again. And there are others which sleep
together round the king; and this they do every night, changing in turn
so that their king may never find them wanting.

### FALSEHOOD.

The fox when it sees a flock of herons or magpies or birds of that kind,
suddenly flings himself on the ground with his mouth open to look as he
were dead; and these birds want to peck at his tongue, and he bites off
their heads.
