### 250.

<span class="margnote"> Propositions on perspective of disappearance
from MS. C. (250-262).</span>Of several bodies of equal size and equally
distant from the eye, those will look the smallest which are against the
lightest background.

Every visible object must be surrounded by light and shade. A perfectly
spherical body surrounded by light and shade will appear to have one
side larger than the other in proportion as one is more highly lighted
than the other.
