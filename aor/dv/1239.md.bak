*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1239.

### THE OYSTER.--FOR TREACHERY.

This creature, when the moon is full opens itself wide, and when the
crab looks in he throws in a piece of rock or seaweed and the oyster
cannot close again, whereby it serves for food to that crab. This is
what happens to him who opens his mouth to tell his secret. He becomes
the prey of the treacherous hearer.

### THE BASILISK.--CRUELTY.

All snakes flie from this creature; but the weasel attacks it by means
of rue and kills it.

### THE ASP.

This carries instantaneous death in its fangs; and, that it may not hear
the charmer it stops its ears with its tail.
