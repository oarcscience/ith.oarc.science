*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 658.

As soon as the poet ceases to represent in words what exists in nature,
he in fact ceases to resemble the painter; for if the poet, leaving such
representation, proceeds to describe the flowery and flattering speech
of the figure, which he wishes to make the speaker, he then is an orator
and no longer a poet nor a painter. And if he speaks of the heavens he
becomes an astrologer, and philosopher; and a theologian, if he
discourses of nature or God. But, if he restricts himself to the
description of objects, he would enter the lists against the painter, if
with words he could satisfy the eye as the painter does.
