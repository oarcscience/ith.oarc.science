*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 478.

<span class="margnote"> On images reflected in water.</span>Painters
often deceive themselves, by representing water in which they make the
water reflect the objects seen by the man. But the water reflects the
object from one side and the man sees it from the other; and it often
happens that the painter sees an object from below, and thus one and the
same object is seen from hind part before and upside down, because the
water shows the image of the object in one way, and the eye sees it in
another.
