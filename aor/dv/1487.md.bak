*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1487.

Demetrius was wont to say that there was no difference between the
speech and words of the foolish and ignorant, and the noises and
rumblings of the wind in an inflated stomach. Nor did he say so without
reason, for he saw no difference between the parts whence the noise
issued; whether their lower parts or their mouth, since one and the
other were of equal use and importance.  <span
