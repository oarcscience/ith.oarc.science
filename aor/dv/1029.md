<span class="margnote"> Notes on the North Italian lake.
(1029-1033)</span>In many places there are streams of water which swell
for six hours and ebb for six hours; and I, for my part, have seen one
above the lake of Como called Fonte Pliniana, which increases and ebbs,
as I have said, in such a way as to turn the stones of two mills; and
when it fails it falls so low that it is like looking at water in a deep
pit.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_218"></span>[237:552](1029.htm#fr_218.md) : The fountain is
known by this name to this day: it is near Torno, on the Eastern shore
of Como. The waters still rise and fall with the flow and ebb of the
tide as Pliny described it (Epist. IV, 30; Hist. Nat. II, 206).
