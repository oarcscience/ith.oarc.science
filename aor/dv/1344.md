*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1344.

I am greatly vexed to be in necessity, but I still more regret that this
should be the cause of the hindrance of my wish which is always disposed
to obey your Excellency.

Perhaps your Excellency did not give further orders to Messer Gualtieri,
believing that I had money enough.

I am greatly annoyed that you should have found me in necessity, and
that my having to earn my living should have hindered me ...

\[12\] It vexes me greatly that having to earn my living has forced me
to interrupt the work and to attend to small matters, instead of
following up the work which your Lordship entrusted to me. But I hope in
a short time to have earned so much that I may carry it out quietly to
the satisfaction of your Excellency, to whom I commend myself; and if
your Lordship thought that I had money, your Lordship was deceived. I
had to feed 6 men for 56 months, and have had 50 ducats.
