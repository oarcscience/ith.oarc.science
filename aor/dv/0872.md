*a*, the side of the body in light and shade *b*, faces the whole
portion of the hemisphere bed *e f*, and does not face any part of the
darkness of the earth. And the same occurs at the point *o*; therefore
the space a *o* is throughout of one and the same brightness, and s
faces only four degrees of the hemisphere *d e f g h*, and also the
whole of the earth *s h*, which will render it darker; and how much must
be demonstrated by calculation.  <span id="fr_116"></span>[450](#fn_116.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_116"></span>[143:450](0872.htm#fr_116.md) : This passage,
which has perhaps a doubtful right to its place in this connection,
stands in the Manuscript between those given in Vol. I as No. 117 and
No. 427.
