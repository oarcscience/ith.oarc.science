### I.

### OF THE NATURE OF WATER.

### THE ORDER OF THE FIRST BOOK ON WATER.

<span class="margnote"> The arrangement of Book I.</span>Define first
what is meant by height and depth; also how the elements are situated
one inside another. Then, what is meant by solid weight and by liquid
weight; but first what weight and lightness are in themselves. Then
describe why water moves, and why its motion ceases; then why it becomes
slower or more rapid; besides this, how it always falls, being in
contact with the air but lower than the air. And how water rises in the
air by means of the heat of the sun, and then falls again in rain;
again, why water springs forth from the tops of mountains; and if the
water of any spring higher than the ocean can pour forth water higher
than the surface of that ocean. And how all the water that returns to
the ocean is higher than the sphere of waters. And how the waters of the
equatorial seas are higher than the waters of the North, and higher
beneath the body of the sun than in any part of the equatorial circle;
for experiment shows that under the heat of a burning brand the water
near the brand boils, and the water surrounding this ebullition always
sinks

with a circular eddy. And how the waters of the North are lower than the
other seas, and more so as they become colder, until they are converted
into ice.
