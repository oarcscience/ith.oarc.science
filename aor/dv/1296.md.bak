*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1296.

(Of going in Ships.)

We shall see the trees of the great forests of Taurus and of Sinai and
of the Appenines and others, rush by means of the air, from East to West
and from North to South; and carry, by means of the air, great
multitudes of men. Oh! how many vows! Oh! how many deaths! Oh! how many
partings of friends and relations! Oh! how many will those be who will
never again see their own country nor their native land, and who will
die unburied, with their bones strewn in various parts of the world!

(Of moving on All Saints' Day.)

Many will forsake their own dwellings and carry with them all their
belongings and will go to live in other parts.

(Of All Souls' Day.)

How many will they be who will bewail their deceased forefathers,
carrying lights to them.

(Of Friars, who spending nothing but words, receive great gifts and
bestow Paradise.)

Invisible money will procure the triumph of many who will spend it.

(Of Bows made of the Horns of Oxen.)

Many will there be who will die a painful death by means of the horns of
cattle.

(Of writing Letters from one Country to another.)

Men will speak with each other from the most remote countries, and
reply.

(Of Hemispheres, which are infinite; and which are divided by an
infinite number of Lines, so that every Man always has one of these
Lines between his Feet.)

Men standing in opposite hemispheres will converse and deride each other
and embrace each other, and understand each other's language.

(Of Priests who say Mass.)

There will be many men who, when they go to their labour will put on the
richest clothes, and these will be made after the fashion of aprons
\[petticoats\].

(Of Friars who are Confessors.)

And unhappy women will, of their own free will, reveal to men all their
sins and shameful and most secret deeds.

(Of Churches and the Habitations of Friars.)

Many will there be who will give up work and labour and poverty of life
and goods, and will go to live among wealth in splendid buildings,
declaring that this is the way to make themselves acceptable to God.

(Of Selling Paradise.)

An infinite number of men will sell publicly and unhindered things of
the very highest price, without leave from the Master of it; while it
never was theirs nor in their power; and human justice will not prevent
it.

(Of the Dead which are carried to be buried.)

The simple folks will carry vast quantities of lights to light up the
road for those who have entirely lost the power of sight.

(Of Dowries for Maidens.)

And whereas, at first, maidens could not be protected against the
violence of Men, neither by the watchfulness of parents nor by strong
walls, the time will come when the fathers and parents of those girls
will pay a large price to a man who wants to marry them, even if they
are rich, noble and most handsome. Certainly this seems as though nature
wished to eradicate the human race as being useless to the world, and as
spoiling all created things.

(Of the Cruelty of Man.)

Animals will be seen on the earth who will always be fighting against
each other

with the greatest loss and frequent deaths on each side. And there will
be no end to their malignity; by their strong limbs we shall see a great
portion of the trees of the vast forests laid low throughout the
universe; and, when they are filled with food the satisfaction of their
desires will be to deal death and grief and labour and wars and fury to
every living thing; and from their immoderate pride they will desire to
rise towards heaven, but the too great weight of their limbs will keep
them down. Nothing will remain on earth, or under the earth or in the
waters which will not be persecuted, disturbed and spoiled, and those of
one country removed into another. And their bodies will become the
sepulture and means of transit of all they have killed.

O Earth! why dost thou not open and engulf them in the fissures of thy
vast abyss and caverns, and no longer display in the sight of heaven
such a cruel and horrible monster.
