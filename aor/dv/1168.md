*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1168.

To lie is so vile, that even if it were in speaking well of godly things
it would take off something from God's grace; and Truth is so excellent,
that if it praises but small things they become noble.

Beyond a doubt truth bears the same relation to falsehood as light to
darkness; and this truth is in itself so excellent that, even when it
dwells on humble and lowly matters, it is still infinitely above
uncertainty and lies, disguised in high and

lofty discourses; because in our minds, even if lying should be their
fifth element, this does not prevent that the truth of things is the
chief nutriment of superior intellects, though not of wandering wits.

But you who live in dreams are better pleased by the sophistical reasons
and frauds of wits in great and uncertain things, than by those reasons
which are certain and natural and not so far above us.
