*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1271.

<span class="margnote"> Fables on lifeless objects
(1271--1274).</span>The water finding that its element was the lordly
ocean, was seized with a desire to rise above the air, and being
encouraged by the element of fire and rising as a very subtle vapour, it
seemed as though it were really as thin as air. But having risen very
high, it reached the air that was still more rare and cold, where the
fire forsook it, and the minute particles, being brought together,
united and became heavy; whence its haughtiness deserting it, it betook
itself to flight and it fell from the sky, and was drunk up by the dry
earth, where, being imprisoned for a long time, it did penance for its
sin.
