### 1089.

<span class="margnote"> The Tyrrhene Sea.</span>Some at the Tyrrhene sea
employ this method; that is to say they fastened an anchor to one end of
the yard, and to the other a cord, of which the lower end was fastened
to an anchor; and in battle they flung this anchor on to the oars of the
opponent's boat and by the use of a capstan drew it to the side; and
threw soft soap and tow, daubed with pitch and set ablaze, on to that
side where the anchor hung; so that in order to escape that fire, the
defenders of that ship had to fly to the opposite side; and in doing
this they aided to the attack, because the galley was more easily drawn
to the side by reason of the counterpoise.  <span
