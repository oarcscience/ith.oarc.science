### 903.

### THE SPOTS ON THE MOON.

<span class="margnote"> On the spots in the moon (903-907).</span>Some
have said that vapours rise from the moon, after the manner of clouds
and are interposed between the moon and our eyes. But, if this were the
case, these spots would never be permanent, either as to position or
form; and, seeing the moon from various aspects, even if these spots did
not move they would change in form, as objects do which are seen from
different sides.
