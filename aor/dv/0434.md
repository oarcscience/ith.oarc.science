*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 434.

### OF THE LIGHTS ON DARK LEAVES.

The lights on such leaves which are darkest, will be most near to the
colour of the atmosphere that is reflected in them. And the cause of
this is that the light on the illuminated portion mingles with the dark
hue to compose a blue colour; and this light is produced by the blueness
of the atmosphere which is reflected in the smooth surface of these
leaves and adds to the blue hue which this light usually produces when
it falls on dark objects.

### OF THE LIGHTS ON LEAVES OF A YELLOWISH GREEN.

But leaves of a green verging on yellow when they reflect the atmosphere
do not produce a reflection verging on blue, inasmuch as every thing
which appears in a mirror takes some colour from that mirror, hence the
blue of the atmosphere being reflected in the yellow of the leaf appears
green, because blue and yellow mixed together make a very fine green
colour, therefore the lustre of light leaves verging on yellow will be
greenish yellow.
