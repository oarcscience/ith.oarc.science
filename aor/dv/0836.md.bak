<span class="margnote"> The seat of the common sense.</span>The Common
Sense, is that which judges of things offered to it by the other senses.
The ancient speculators have concluded that that part of man which
constitutes his judgment is caused by a central organ to which the other
five senses refer everything by means of impressibility; and to this
centre they have given the name Common Sense. And they say that this
Sense is situated in the centre of the head between Sensation and
Memory. And this name of Common Sense

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

is given to it solely because it is the common judge of all the other
five senses *i.e.* Seeing, Hearing, Touch, Taste and Smell. This Common
Sense is acted upon by means of Sensation which is placed as a medium
between it and the senses. Sensation is acted upon by means of the
images of things presented to it by the external instruments, that is to
say the senses which are the medium between external things and
Sensation. In the same way the senses are acted upon by objects.
Surrounding things transmit their images to the senses and the senses
transfer them to the Sensation. Sensation sends them to the Common
Sense, and by it they are stamped upon the memory and are there more or
less retained according to the importance or force of the impression.
That sense is most rapid in its function which is nearest to the
sensitive medium and the eye, being the highest is the chief of the
others. Of this then only we will speak, and the others we will leave in
order not to make our matter too long. Experience tells us that the eye
apprehends ten different natures of things, that is: Light and Darkness,
one being the cause of the perception of the nine others, and the other
its absence:-- Colour and substance, form and place, distance and
nearness, motion and stillness  <span id="fr_99"></span>[433](#fn_99.md) .
