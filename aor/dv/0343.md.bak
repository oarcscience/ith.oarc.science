<span class="margnote"> Vitruvius' scheme of
proportions.</span>Vitruvius, the architect, says in his work on
architecture that the measurements of the human body are distributed by
Nature as follows: that is that 4 fingers make 1 palm, and 4 palms make
1 foot, 6 palms make 1 cubit; 4 cubits make a man's height. And 4 cubits
make one pace and 24 palms make a man; and these measures he used in his
buildings. If you open your legs so much as to decrease your height 1/14
and spread and raise your arms till your middle fingers touch the level
of the top of your head you must know that the centre of the outspread
limbs will be in the navel and the space between the legs will be an
equilateral triangle.

The length of a man's outspread arms is equal to his height.

From the roots of the hair to the bottom of the chin is the tenth of a
man's height; from the bottom of the chin to the top of his head is one
eighth of his height; from the top of the breast to the top of his head
will be one sixth of a man. From the top of the breast to the roots of
the hair will be the seventh part of the whole man. From the nipples to
the top of the head will be the fourth part of a man. The greatest width
of the shoulders contains in itself the fourth part of the man. From the
elbow to the tip of the hand will be the fifth part of a man; and from
the elbow to the angle of the armpit will be the eighth part of the man.
The whole hand will be the tenth part of

the man; the beginning of the genitals marks the middle of the man. The
foot is the seventh part of the man. From the sole of the foot to below
the knee will be the fourth part of the man. From below the knee to the
beginning of the genitals will be the fourth part of the man. The
distance from the bottom of the chin to the nose and from the roots of
the hair to the eyebrows is, in each case the same, and like the ear, a
third of the face.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[183:163](0343.htm#fr_165.md) : See [Pl.

and 33 1/2 long. At the ends of the scale below the figure are written
the words *diti* (fingers) and *palmi* (palms). The passage quoted from
Vitruvius is Book III, Cap. 1, and Leonardo's drawing is given in the
editions of Vitruvius by FRA GIOCONDO (Venezia 1511, fol., Firenze 1513,
8vo.) and by CESARIANO (Como 1521).
