### 221.

A body illuminated by the solar rays passing between the thick branches
of trees will produce as many shadows as there are branches between the
sun and itself.

Where the shadow-rays from an opaque pyramidal body are intercepted they
will cast a shadow of bifurcate outline and various depth at the points.
A light which is broader than the apex but narrower than the base

of an opaque pyramidal body placed in front of it, will cause that
pyramid to cast a shadow of bifurcate form and various degrees of depth.

If an opaque body, smaller than the light, casts two shadows and if it
is the same size or larger, casts but one, it follows that a pyramidal
body, of which part is smaller, part equal to, and part larger than, the
luminous body, will cast a bifurcate shadow.
