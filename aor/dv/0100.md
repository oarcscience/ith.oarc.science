### OF THE DIMINUTION OF OBJECTS AT VARIOUS DISTANCES.

A second object as far distant from the first as the first is from the
eye will appear half the size of the first, though they be of the same
size really.

### OF THE DEGREES OF DIMINUTION.

If you place the vertical plane at one braccio from the eye, the first
object, being at a distance of 4 braccia from your eye will diminish to
3/4 of its height at that plane; and if it is 8 braccia from the eye, to
7/8; and if it is 16 braccia off, it will diminish to 15/16 of its
height and so on by degrees, as the space doubles the diminution will
double.
