*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 366.

### OF PAINTING.

Every part of the whole must be in proportion to the whole. Thus, if a
man is of a stout short figure he will be the same in all his parts:
that is with short and thick arms, wide thick hands, with short fingers
with their joints of the same character, and so on with the rest. I
would have the same thing understood as applying to all animals and
plants; in diminishing, \[the various parts\] do so in due proportion to
the size, as also in enlarging.
