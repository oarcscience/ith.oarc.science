### WHY WATER IS FOUND AT THE TOP OF MOUNTAINS.

From the straits of Gibraltar to the Don is 3500 miles, that is one mile
and 1/6, giving a fall of one braccio in a mile to any water that moves
gently. The Caspian sea is a great deal higher; and none of the
mountains of Europe rise a mile above the surface of our seas; therefore
it might be said that the water which is on the summits of our mountains
might come from the height of those seas, and of the rivers which flow
into them, and which are still higher.
