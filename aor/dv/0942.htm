<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> The relative height of the surface of the sea to that of the land (942-945).</FONT></span><I>b d</I> is a plain through which a river flows to the sea; this plain
ends at the sea, and since in fact the dry land that is uncovered is
not perfectly level--for, if it were, the river would have no
motion--as the river does move, this place is a slope rather than a
plain; hence this plain <I>d b</I> so ends where the sphere of water
begins that if it were extended in a continuous line to <I>b a</I> it
would go down beneath the sea, whence it follows that the sea <I>a c

<P>
Obviously no portions of dry land left uncovered by water can ever
be lower than the surface of the watery sphere.
