*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 544.

A diminished object should be seen from the same distance, height and
direction as the point of sight of your eye, or else your knowledge will
produce no good effect.

And if you will not, or cannot, act on this principle--because as the
plane on which you paint is to be seen by several persons you would need
several points of sight which would make it look discordant and
wrong--place yourself at a distance of at least 10 times the size of the
objects.

The lesser fault you can fall into then, will be that of representing
all the objects in the foreground of their proper size, and on whichever
side you are standing the objects thus seen will diminish themselves
while the spaces between them will have no definite ratio. For, if you
place yourself in the middle of a straight row \[of objects\], and look
at several columns arranged in a line you will see, beyond a few columns
separated by intervals, that the columns touch; and beyond where they
touch they cover each other, till the last column projects but very
little beyond the last but one. Thus the spaces between the

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

columns are by degrees entirely lost. So, if your method of perspective
is good, it will produce the same effect; this effect results from
standing near the line in which the columns are placed. This method is
not satisfactory unless the objects seen are viewed from a small hole,
in the middle of which is your point of sight; but if you proceed thus
your work will be perfect and will deceive the beholder, who will see
the columns as they are here figured.

Here the eye is in the middle, at the point *a* and near to the columns.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_259"></span>[273:257](0544.htm#fr_259.md) : The diagram which
stands above this chapter in the original with the note belonging to it:
"a b *e la ripruova*" (*a b* is the proof) has obviously no connection
with the text. The second sketch alone is reproduced and stands in the
original between lines 22 and 23.
