*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 285.

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

An object represented in white and black will display stronger relief
than in any other way; hence I would remind you O Painter! to dress your
figures in the lightest colours you can, since, if you put them in dark
colours, they will be in too slight relief and inconspicuous from a
distance. And the reason is that the shadows of all objects are dark.
And if you make a dress dark there is little variety in the lights and
shadows, while in light colours there are many grades.
