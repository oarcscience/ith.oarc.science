### HOW A CAST SHADOW CAN NEVER BE OF THE SAME SIZE AS THE BODY THAT CASTS IT.

If the rays of light proceed, as experience shows, from a single point
and are diffused in a sphere round this point, radiating and dispersed
through the air, the farther they spread the wider they must spread; and
an object placed between the light and a wall is always imaged larger in
its shadow, because the rays that strike it  <span

wall, have become larger.
