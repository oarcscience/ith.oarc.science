### Footnotes

<span id="fn_400"></span>[421:706](1379.htm#fr_400.md) 2: *Libro di
Vitolone* see No. 1506 note.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[421:707](1379.htm#fr_401.md) : 7 and fol. It
would seem from the text that Leonardo intended to have instructions in
painting on paper. It is hardly necessary to point out that the Art of
illuminating was quite separate from that of painting.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[421:708](1379.htm#fr_402.md) : The mysterious
looking words, quite distinctly written, in line 1: *ingol, amor a,
ilopan a* and on line 2: *enoiganod al* are obviously in cipher and the
solution is a simple one; by reading them backwards we find for *ingol*:
logni-probably *longi*, evidently the name of a person; for *amor a*: *a
Roma*, for *ilopan a*: *a Napoli*. Leonardo has done the same in two
passages treating on some secrets of his art Nos. 641 and 729, the only
other places in which we find this cipher employed; we may therefore
conclude that it was for the sake of secrecy that he used it.

There can be no doubt, from the tenor of this passage, that Leonardo
projected a secret excursion to Naples. Nothing has hitherto been known
of this journey, but the significance of the passage will be easily
understood by a reference to the following notes, from which we may
infer that Leonardo really had at the time plans for travelling further
than Naples. From lines 3, 4 and 7 it is evident that he purposed, after
selling every thing that was not easily portable, to leave a chest in
the care of his relations at Vinci. His luggage was to be packed into
two trunks especially adapted for transport by mules. The exact meaning
of many sentences in the following notes must necessarily remain
obscure. These brief remarks on small and irrelevant affairs and so
forth are however of no historical value. The notes referring to the
preparations for his journey are more intelligible.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[422:709](1379.htm#fr_403.md) 11. 'De Ponderibus'.
A large number of Leonardo's notes bear this superscription. Compare No.
1436, 3.
