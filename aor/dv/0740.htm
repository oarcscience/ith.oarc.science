<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF LUTING THE FURNACE WITHIN.</H3>
<P>
The furnace must be luted before you put the metal in it, with earth
from Valenza, and over that with ashes.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF RESTORING THE METAL WHEN IT IS BECOMING COOL.</H3>
<P>
When you see that the bronze is congealing take some willow-wood cut
in small chips and make up the fire with it.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE CAUSE OF ITS CURDLING.</H3>
<P>
I say that the cause of this congealing often proceeds from too much
fire, or from ill-dried wood.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">TO KNOW THE CONDITION OF THE FIRE.</H3>
<P>
You may know when the fire is good and fit for your purpose by a
clear flame,
<P><A NAME="page_24"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 24</FONT></A></P>
<P>and if you see the tips of the flames dull and ending
in much smoke do not trust it, and particularly when the flux metal
is almost fluid.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF ALLOYING THE METAL.</H3>
<P>
Metal for guns must invariably be made with 6 or even 8 per cent,
that is 6 of tin to one hundred of copper, for the less you put in,
the stronger will the gun be.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">WHEN THE TIN SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE COPPER.</H3>
<P>
The tin should be put in with the copper when the copper is reduced
to a fluid.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HOW TO HASTEN THE MELTING.</H3>
<P>
You can hasten the melting when 2/3ds of the copper is fluid; you
can then, with a stick of chestnut-wood, repeatedly stir what of
copper remains entire amidst what is melted.
