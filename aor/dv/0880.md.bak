of its size and power I shall reserve for Book 4. But I wonder greatly
that Socrates

 <span id="fr_124"></span>[458](#fn_124.md)

should have depreciated that solar body, saying that it was of the
nature of incandescent stone, and the one who opposed him as to that
error was not far wrong. But I only wish I had words to serve me to
blame those who are fain to extol the worship of men more than that of
the sun; for in the whole universe there is nowhere to be seen a body of
greater magnitude and power than the sun. Its light gives light to all
the celestial bodies which are distributed throughout the universe; and
from it descends all vital force, for the heat that is in living beings
comes from the soul \[vital spark\]; and there is no other centre of
heat and light in the universe as will be shown in Book 4; and certainly
those who have chosen to worship men as gods--as Jove, Saturn, Mars and
the like--have fallen into the gravest error, seeing that even if a man
were as large as our earth, he would look no bigger than a little star
which appears but as a speck in the universe; and seeing again that
these men are mortal, and putrid and corrupt in their sepulchres.

Marcellus  <span id="fr_125"></span>[459](#fn_125.md) and many others
praise the sun.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_124"></span>[149:458](0880.htm#fr_124.md) 2: *Socrates;* I
have little light to throw on this reference. Plato's Socrates himself
declares on more than one occasion that in his youth he had turned his
mind to the study of celestial phenomena (METEWPA) but not in his later
years (see G. C. LEWIS, *The Astronomy of the ancients*, page 109;
MADLER, *Geschichte der Himmelskunde*, page 41). Here and there in
Plato's writings we find incidental notes on the sun and other heavenly
bodies. Leonardo may very well have known of these, since the Latin
version by Ficinus was printed as early as 1491; indeed an undated
edition exists which may very likely have appeared between 1480--90.

There is but one passage in Plato, Epinomis (p. 983) where he speaks of
the physical properties of the sun and says that it is larger than the
earth.

Aristotle who goes very fully into the subject says the same. A complete
edition of Aristotele's works was first printed in Venice 1495-98, but a
Latin version of the Books *De Coelo et Mundo* and *De Physica* had been
printed in Venice as early as in 1483 (H. MULLER-STRUBING).

<span id="fn_125"></span>[149:459](0880.htm#fr_125.md) 23: I have no means
of identifying *Marcello* who is named in the margin. It may be Nonius
Marcellus, an obscure Roman Grammarian of uncertain date (between the
IInd and Vth centuries A. C.) the author of the treatise *De compendiosa
doctrina per litteras ad filium* in which he treats *de rebus omnibus et
quibusdam aliis*. This was much read in the middle ages. The *editto
princeps* is dated 1470 (H. MULLER-STRUBING).
