*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1095.

The Tigris passes through Asia Minor and brings with it the water of
three lakes, one after the other of various elevations; the first being
Munace and the middle Pallas and the lowest Triton. And the Nile again
springs from three very high lakes in Ethiopia, and runs northwards
towards the sea of Egypt with a course of 4000 miles, and by the
shortest and straightest line it is 3000 miles. It is said that it
issues from the Mountains of the Moon, and has various unknown sources.
The said lakes are about 4000 braccia above the surface of the sphere of
water, that is 1 mile and 1/3, giving to the Nile a fall of 1 braccia in
every mile.
