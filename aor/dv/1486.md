*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1486.

### CORNELIUS CELSUS.

The highest good is wisdom, the chief evil is suffering in the body.
Because, as we are composed of two things, that is soul and body, of
which the first is the better, the body is the inferior; wisdom belongs
to the better part, and the chief evil belongs to the worse part and is
the worst of all. As the best thing of all in the soul is wisdom, so the
worst in the body is suf- fering. Therefore just as bodily pain is the
chief evil, wisdom is the chief good of the soul, that is with the wise
man; and nothing else can be compared with it.  <span
