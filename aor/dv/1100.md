### 1100.

### SMALL BOATS.

The small boats used by the Assyrians were made of thin laths of willow
plaited over rods also of willow, and bent into the form of a boat. They
were daubed with fine mud soaked with oil or with turpentine, and
reduced to a kind of mud which resisted the water and because pine would
split; and always remained fresh; and they covered this sort of boats
with the skins of oxen in safely crossing the river Sicuris of Spain, as
is reported by Lucant;  <span id="fr_276"></span>[610](#fn_276)

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

The Spaniards, the Scythians and the Arabs, when they want to make a
bridge in haste, fix hurdlework made of willows on bags of ox-hide, and
so cross in safety.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[264:610](1100.htm#fr_276) 7: See Lucan's
Pharsalia IV, 130: *Utque habuit ripas Sicoris camposque reliquit,
Primum cana salix madefacto vimine parvam Texitur in puppim, calsoque
inducto juvenco Vectoris patiens tumidum supernatat amnem. Sic Venetus
stagnante Pado, fusoque Britannus Navigat oceano, sic cum tenet omnia
Nilus, Conseritur bibula Memphitis cymbo papyro. His ratibus transjecta
manus festinat utrimque Succisam cavare nemus*
