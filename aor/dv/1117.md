### 1117.

### A METHOD OF ESCAPING IN A TEMPEST AND SHIPWRECK AT SEA.

<span id="img_v227700"></span> ![](img/v227700.jpg)

<span class="margnote"> The use of swimming belts.</span>Have a coat
made of leather, which must be double across the breast, that is having
a hem on each side of about a finger breadth. Thus it will be double
from the waist to the knee; and the leather must be quite air-tight.
When you want to leap into the sea, blow out the skirt of your coat
through the double hems of the breast; and jump into the sea, and allow
yourself to be carried by the waves; when you see no shore near, give
your attention to the sea you are in, and always keep in your mouth the
air-tube which leads down into the coat; and if now and again you
require to take a breath of fresh air, and the foam prevents you, you
may draw a breath of the air within the coat.
