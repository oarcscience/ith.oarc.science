### FIFTH BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.

### OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE SHADOWS CAST BY OBJECTS OUGHT TO BE DEFINED.

<span class="margnote"> Principles of reflection (203. 204).</span>If
the object is the mountain here figured, and the light is at the point
*a*, I say that from *b d* and also from *c f* there will be no light
but from reflected rays. And this results from the fact that rays of
light can only act in straight lines; and the same is the case with the
secondary or reflected rays.
