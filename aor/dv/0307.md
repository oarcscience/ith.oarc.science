### OF PAINTING.

Of various colours which are none of them blue that which at a great
distance will look bluest is the nearest to black; and so, conversely,
the colour which is least like black will at a great distance best
preserve its own colour.

Hence the green of fields will assume a bluer hue than yellow or white
will, and conversely yellow or white will change less than green, and
red still less.
