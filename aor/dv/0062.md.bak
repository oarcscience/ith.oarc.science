*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 62.

Every point is the termination of an infinite number of lines, which
diverge to form a base, and immediately, from the base the same lines
converge to a pyramid \[imaging\] both the colour and form. No sooner is
a form created or compounded than suddenly infinite lines and angles are
produced from it; and these lines, distributing themselves and
intersecting each other in the air, give rise to an infinite number of
angles opposite to each other. Given a base, each opposite angle, will
form a triangle having a form and proportion equal to the larger angle;
and if the base goes twice into each of the 2 lines of the pyramid the
smaller triangle will do the same.
