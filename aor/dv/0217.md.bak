### 217.

### THAT PART OF THE REFLECTION WILL BE BRIGHTEST WHERE THE REFLECTED RAYS ARE SHORTEST.

\[2\] The darkness occasioned by the casting of combined shadows will be
in conformity with its cause, which will originate and terminate between
two plane surfaces near together, alike in tone and directly opposite
each other.

\[4\] In proportion as the source of light is larger, the luminous and
shadow rays will be more mixed together. This result is produced because
wherever there is a larger quantity of luminous rays, there is most
light, but where there are fewer there is least light, consequently the
shadow rays come in and mingle with them.
