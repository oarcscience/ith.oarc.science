*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 247.

### ON LIGHT BETWEEN SHADOWS

When you are drawing any object, remember, in comparing the grades of
light in the illuminated portions, that the eye is often deceived by
seeing things lighter than they are. And the reason lies in our
comparing those parts with the contiguous parts. Since if two
\[separate\] parts are in different grades of light and if the less
bright is conterminous with a dark portion and the brighter is
conterminous with a light background--as the sky or something equally
bright--, then that which is less light, or I should say less radiant,
will look the brighter and the brighter will seem the darker.
