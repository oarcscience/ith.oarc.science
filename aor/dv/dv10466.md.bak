### *VIII.*

### *Botany for Painters and Elements of Landscape Painting.*

*The chapters composing this portion of the work consist of observations
on Form, Light and Shade in Plants, and particularly in Trees summed up
in certain general rules by which the author intends to guide the artist
in the pictorial representation of landscape.*

*With these the first principles of a* Theory of Landscape painting *are
laid down--a theory as profoundly thought out in its main lines as it is
lucidly worked out in its details. In reading these chapters the
conviction is irresistible that such a* Botany for painters *is or ought
to be of similar importance in the practice of painting as the
principles of the Proportions and Movements of the human figure* i. e.
Anatomy for painters.

*There can be no doubt that Leonardo, in laying down these rules, did
not intend to write on Botany in the proper scientific sense--his own
researches on that subject have no place here; it need only be observed
that they are easily distinguished by their character and contents from
those which are here collected and arranged under the title 'Botany for
painters'. In some cases where this division might appear doubtful,--as
for instance in No.* 402--*the Painter is directly addressed and
enjoined to take the rule to heart as of special importance in his art.*

*The original materials are principally derived from MS.* G, *in which
we often find this subject treated on several pages in succession
without any of that intermixture of other matters, which is so frequent
in Leonardo's writings. This MS., too, is one of the latest; when it was
written, the great painter was already more than sixty years of age, so
we can scarcely doubt that he regarded all he wrote as his final views
on the subject. And the same remark applies to the chapters from MSS.* E
*and* M *which were also written between* 1513--15.

*For the sake of clearness, however, it has been desirable to
sacrifice--with few exceptions--the original order of the passages as
written, though it was with much reluctance and only after long
hesitation that I resigned myself to this necessity. Nor do I mean to
impugn the logical connection of the author's ideas in his MS.; but it*

*will be easily understood that the sequence of disconnected notes, as
they occurred to Leonardo and were written down from time to time, might
be hardly satisfactory as a systematic arrangement of his principles.
The reader will find in the Appendix an exact account of the order of
the chapters in the original MS. and from the data there given can
restore them at will. As the materials are here arranged, the structure
of the tree as regards the growth of the branches comes first* (394-411)
*and then the insertion of the leaves on the stems* (412-419). *Then
follow the laws of Light and Shade as applied, first, to the leaves
(420-434), and, secondly, to the whole tree and to groups of trees*
(435-457). *After the remarks on the Light and Shade in landscapes
generally* (458-464), *we find special observations on that of views of
towns and buildings* (465-469). *To the theory of Landscape Painting
belong also the passages on the effect of Wind on Trees* (470-473) *and
on the Light and Shade of Clouds* (474-477), *since we find in these
certain comparisons with the effect of Light and Shade on Trees* (e. g.:
*in No.* 476, 4. 5; *and No.* 477, 9. 12). *The chapters given in the
Appendix Nos.* 478 *and* 481 *have hardly any connection with the
subjects previously treated.*
