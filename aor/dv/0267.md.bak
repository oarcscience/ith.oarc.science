### 267.

### OF LIGHT AND SHADE.

Every portion of the surface of a body is varied \[in hue\] by the
\[reflected\] colour of the object that may be opposite to it.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

### EXAMPLE.

If you place a spherical body between various objects that is to say
with \[direct\] sunlight on one side of it, and on the other a wall
illuminated by the sun, which wall may be green or of any other colour,
while the surface on which it is placed may be red, and the two lateral
sides are in shadow, you will see that the natural colour of that body
will assume something of the hue reflected from those objects. The
strongest will be \[given by\] the luminous body; the second by the
illuminated wall, the third by the shadows. There will still be a
portion which will take a tint from the colour of the edges.
