### OF THE WAY TO LEARN TO COMPOSE FIGURES \[IN GROUPS\] IN HISTORICAL PICTURES.

<span class="margnote"> Of sketching figures and portraits
(571-572).</span>When you have well learnt perspective and have by heart
the parts and forms of objects, you must go about, and constantly, as
you go, observe, note and consider the circumstances and behaviour of
men in talking, quarrelling or laughing or fighting together: the action
of the men themselves and the actions of the bystanders, who separate
them or who look on. And take a note of them with slight strokes thus,
in a little book which you should always carry with you. And it should
be of tinted paper, that it may not be rubbed out, but change the old
\[when full\] for a new one; since these things should not be rubbed out
but preserved with great care; for the forms, and positions of objects
are so infinite that the memory is incapable of retaining them,
wherefore keep these \[sketches\] as your guides and masters.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_266"></span>[287:264](0571.htm#fr_266.md) : Among Leonardo's
numerous note books of pocket size not one has coloured paper, so no
sketches answering to this description can be pointed out. The fact that
most of the notes are written in ink, militates against the supposition
that they were made in the open air.
