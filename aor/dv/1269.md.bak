*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1269.

### A FABLE.

A rat was besieged in his little dwelling by a weasel, which with
unwearied vigilance awaited his surrender, while watching his imminent
peril through a little hole. Meanwhile the cat came by and suddenly
seized the weasel and forthwith devoured it. Then the rat offered up a
sacrifice to Jove of some of his store of nuts, humbly thanking His
providence, and came out of his hole to enjoy his lately lost liberty.
But he was instantly deprived of it, together with his life, by the
cruel claws and teeth of the lurking cat.
