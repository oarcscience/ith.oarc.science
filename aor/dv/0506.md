*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 506.

### PAINTING.

The mind of the painter must resemble a mirror, which always takes the
colour of the object it reflects and is completely occupied by the
images of as many objects as are in front of it. Therefore you must
know, Oh Painter! that you cannot be a good one if you are not the
universal master of representing by your art every kind of form produced
by nature. And this you will not know how to do if you do not see them,
and retain them in your mind. Hence as you go through the fields, turn
your attention to various objects, and, in turn look now at this thing
and now at that, collecting a store of divers facts selected and chosen
from those of less value. But do not do like some painters who, when
they are wearied with exercising their fancy dismiss their work from
their thoughts and take exercise in walking for relaxation, but still
keep fatigue in their mind which, though they see various objects
\[around them\], does not apprehend them; but, even when they meet
friends or relations and are saluted by them, although they see and hear
them, take no more cognisance of them than if they had met so much empty
air.
