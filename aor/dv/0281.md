*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 281.

### PERSPECTIVE.

<span class="margnote"> On the reflection of colours
(281-283).</span>Every object devoid of colour in itself is more or less
tinged by the colour \[of the object\] placed opposite. This may be seen
by experience, inasmuch as any object which mirrors another assumes the
colour of the object mirrored in it. And if the surface thus partially
coloured is white the portion which has a red reflection will appear
red, or any other colour, whether bright or dark.

### PERSPECTIVE.

Every opaque and colourless body assumes the hue of the colour reflected
on it; as happens with a white wall.
