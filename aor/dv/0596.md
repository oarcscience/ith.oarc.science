*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 596.

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

When you draw the nude always sketch the whole figure and then finish
those limbs which seem to you the best, but make them act with the other
limbs; otherwise you will get a habit of never putting the limbs well
together on the body.

Never make the head turn the same way as the torso, nor the arm and leg
move together on the same side. And if the face is turned to the right
shoulder, make all the parts lower on the left side than on the right;
and when you turn the body with the breast outwards, if the head turns
to the left side make the parts on the right side higher than those on
the left.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_278"></span>[299:276](0596.htm#fr_278) : In the original
MS. a much defaced sketch is to be seen by the side of the second part
of this chapter; its faded condition has rendered reproduction
impossible. In M. RAVAISSON'S facsimile the outlines of the head have
probably been touched up. This passage however is fitly illustrated by
the drawings on [Pl. XXI](pl021.htm#img_pl021).
