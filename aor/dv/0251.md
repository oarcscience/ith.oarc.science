### PERSPECTIVE.

No visible object can be well understood and comprehended by the human
eye excepting from the difference of the background against which the
edges of the object terminate and by which they are bounded, and no
object will appear \[to stand out\] separate from that background so far
as the outlines of its borders are concerned. The moon,

comes between our eyes and the sun, appears to the eyes of men to be
close to the sun and affixed to it, because the sun is then the
background to the moon.
