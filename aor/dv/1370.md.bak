*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

On the 2<sup>nd</sup> of April 1489, book entitled 'Of the human
figure'.  <span id="fr_391"></span>[697](#fn_391.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_391"></span>[415:697](1370.htm#fr_391.md) : While the letters
in the MS. notes of 1473 and 1478 are very ornate, this note and the
texts on anatomy on the same sheet (for instance No. 805) are in the
same simple hand as we see on [Pl. CXVI](pl116.htm#img_pl116.md) and CXIX.
No 1370 is the only dated note of the years between 1480 and 1489, and
the characters are in all essential points identical with those that we
see in the latest manuscripts written in France (compare the facsimiles
on [Pl. CXV](pl115.htm#img_pl115) and p. 254.md), so that it is hardly
possible to determine exactly the date of a manuscript from the style of
the handwriting, if it does not betray the peculiarities of style as
displayed in the few notes dated previous to l480.--Compare the
facsimile of the manuscripts 1479 on [Pl. LXII](dv20958.htm#img_pl062.md),
No. 2; No. 664, note, Vol. I p. 346. This shows already a marked
simplicity as compared with the calligraphy of 1478.

The text No. 720 belongs to the year 1490; No. 1510 to the year 1492;
No. 1459, No. 1384 and No. 1460 to the year 1493; No. 1463, No. 1517,
No. 1024, 1025 and 1461 to the year 1494; Nos. 1523 and 1524 to the year
1497.
