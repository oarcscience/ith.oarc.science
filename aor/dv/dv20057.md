B. The theory of Dome Architecture.

This subject has been more extensively treated by Leonardo in drawings
than in writing. Still we may fairly assume that it was his purpose,
ultimately to embody the results of his investigation in a "Trattato
delle Cupole." *The amount of materials is remarkably extensive. MS. B
is particularly rich in plans and elevations of churches with one or
more domes--from the simplest form to the most complicated that can be
imagined. Considering the evident connexion between a great number of
these sketches, as well as the impossibility of seeing in them designs
or preparatory sketches for any building intended to be erected, the
conclusion is obvious that they were not designed for any particular
monument, but were theoretical and ideal researches, made in order to
obtain a clear understanding of the laws which must govern the
construction of a great central dome, with smaller ones grouped round
it; and with or without the addition of spires, so that each of these
parts by itself and in its juxtaposition to the other parts should
produce the grandest possible effect.*

In these sketches Leonardo seems to have exhausted every imaginable
combination.  <span id="fr_33"></span>[367](#fn_33.md) The results of some
of these problems are perhaps not quite satisfactory; still they cannot
be considered to give evidence of a want of taste or of any other defect
in Leonardo s architectural capacity. They were no doubt intended
exclusively for his own instruction, and, before all, as it seems, to
illustrate the features or consequences resulting from a given
principle.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

*I have already, in another place,*  <span
id="fr_34"></span>[368](#fn_34.md) *pointed out the law of construction for
buildings crowned by a large dome: namely, that such a dome, to produce
the greatest effect possible, should rise either from the centre of a
Greek cross, or from the centre of a structure of which the plan has
some symmetrical affinity to a circle, this circle being at the same
time the centre of the whole plan of the building.*

Leonardo's sketches show that he was fully aware, as was to be expected,
of this truth. Few of them exhibit the form of a Latin cross, and when
this is met with, it generally gives evidence of the determination to
assign as prominent a part as possible to the dome in the general effect
of the building.

While it is evident, on the one hand, that the greater number of these
domes had no particular purpose, not being designed for execution, on
the other hand several reasons may be found for Leonardo's perseverance
in his studies of the subject.

Besides the theoretical interest of the question for Leonardo and his
Trattato *and besides the taste for domes prevailing at that time, it
seems likely that the intended erection of some building of the first
importance like the Duomos of Pavia and Como, the church of Sta. Maria
delle Grazie at Milan, and the construction of a Dome or central Tower*
(Tiburio) *on the cathedral of Milan, may have stimulated Leonardo to
undertake a general and thorough investigation of the subject; whilst
Leonardo's intercourse with Bramante for ten years or more, can hardly
have remained without influence in this matter. In fact now that some of
this great Architect's studies for S. Peter's at Rome have at last
become known, he must be considered henceforth as the greatest master of
Dome-Architecture that ever existed. His influence, direct or indirect
even on a genius like Leonardo seems the more likely, since Leonardo's
sketches reveal a style most similar to that of Bramante, whose name
indeed, occurs twice in Leonardo's manuscript notes. It must not be
forgotten that Leonardo was a Florentine; the characteristic form of the
two principal domes of Florence, Sta. Maria del Fiore and the
Battisterio, constantly appear as leading features in his sketches.*

The church of San Lorenzo at Milan, was at that time still intact. The
dome is to this day one of the most wonderful cupolas ever constructed,
and with its two smaller domes might well attract the attention and
study

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

*of a never resting genius such as Leonardo. A whole class of these
sketches betray in fact the direct influence of the church of S.
Lorenzo, and this also seems to have suggested the plan of Bramante's
dome of St. Peter's at Rome.*

In the following pages the various sketches for the construction of
domes have been classified and discussed from a general point of view.
On two sheets: [Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084) (C.A. 354b; 118a.md) and
[Pl. LXXXV](pl085.htm#img_pl085), Nos. 1-11 (Ash. II, 6b.md) we see various
dissimilar types, grouped together; thus these two sheets may be
regarded as a sort of nomenclature of the different types, on which we
shall now have to treat.

patterns, each drawn in a square; and in MS. C.A., fol. 87 to 98 form a
whole series of patterns done with the same intention.
