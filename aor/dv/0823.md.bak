*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 823.

A second demonstration inserted between anatomy and \[the treatise on\]
the living being.

You will represent here for a comparison, the legs of a frog, which have
a great resemblance to the legs of man, both in the bones and in the
muscles. Then, in continuation, the hind legs of the hare, which are
very muscular, with strong active muscles, because they are not
encumbered with fat.
