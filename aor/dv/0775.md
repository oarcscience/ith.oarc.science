*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 775.

### OF STONES WHICH DISJOIN THEMSELVES FROM THEIR MORTAR.

Stones laid in regular courses from bottom to top and built up with an
equal quantity of mortar settle equally throughout, when the moisture
that made the mortar soft evaporates.

By what is said above it is proved that the small extent of the new wall
between *A* and *n* will settle but little, in proportion to the extent
of the same wall between *c* and *d*. The proportion will in fact be
that of the thinness of the mortar in relation to the number of courses
or to the quantity of mortar laid between the stones above the different
levels of the old wall.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[81:402](0775.htm#fr_68) : See [Pl.
CV](pl105.htm#img_pl105), No. 1. The top of the tower is wanting in this
reproduction, and with it the letter *n* which, in the original, stands
above the letter *A* over the top of the tower, while *c* stands
perpendicularly over *d*.
