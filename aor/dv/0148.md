### SECOND BOOK ON LIGHT AND SHADE.

### THAT PORTION OF A BODY IN LIGHT AND SHADE WILL BE LEAST LUMINOUS WHICH IS SEEN UNDER THE LEAST AMOUNT OF LIGHT.

<span class="margnote"> Gradations of strength in the shadows (148.
149).</span>That part of the object which is marked *m* is in the
highest light because it faces the window *a d* by the line *a f*; *n*
is in the second grade because the light *b d* strikes it by the line *b
e*; *o* is in the third grade, as the light falls on it from *c d* by
the line *c h*; *p* is the lowest light but one as *c d* falls on it by
the line *d v*; *q* is the deepest shadow for no light falls on it from
any part of the window.

In proportion as *c d* goes into *a d* so will *n r s* be darker than
*m*, and all the rest is space without shadow.
