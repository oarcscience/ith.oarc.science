### 1336.

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

###  <span id="fr_335"></span>[1336](#fn_335)TO THE DEVATDAR <span id="fr_336"></span>[1](#fn_336) OF SYRIA, LIEUTENANT OF THE SACRED SULTAN <span id="fr_337"></span>[2](#fn_337.md) OF BABYLON.

<span class="margnote"> Drafts of Letters and Reports referring to
Armenia (1336. 1337).</span>\[ <span id="fr_338"></span>[3](#fn_338.md)\]
The recent disaster in our Northern parts which I am certain will
terrify not you alone but the whole world, which

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

shall be related to you in due order, showing first the effect and then
the cause \[ <span id="fr_339"></span>[4](#fn_339.md)\]...

Finding myself in this part of Armenia <span
id="fr_340"></span>[5](#fn_340.md) to carry into effect with due love and
care the task for which you sent me \[6\] and to make a beginning in a
place which seemed to me to be most to our purpose, I entered into

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

the city of Calindrafy\[ <span id="fr_341"></span>[7](#fn_341.md)\], near
to our frontiers. This city is situated at the base of that part of the
Taurus mountains which is divided from the Euphrates and looks towards
the peaks of the great Mount Taurus \[ <span
id="fr_342"></span>[8](#fn_342.md)\] to the West \[ <span
id="fr_343"></span>[9](#fn_343.md)\]. These peaks are of such a height that
they seem to touch the sky, and in all the world there is no part of the
earth, higher than its summit\[10\], and the rays of

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

the sun always fall upon it on its East side, four hours before
day-time, and being of the whitest stone \[ <span
id="fr_344"></span>[11](#fn_344.md)\] it shines resplendently and fulfils
the function to these Armenians which a bright moon-light would in the
midst of the darkness; and by its great height it outreaches the utmost
level of the clouds by a space of four miles in a straight line. This
peak is seen in many places towards the West, illuminated by the sun
after its setting the third part of the night. This it is, which with
you \[ <span id="fr_345"></span>[14](#fn_345.md)\] we formerly in calm
weather had supposed to be a comet, and appears to us in the darkness of
night, to change its form, being sometimes divided in two or three
parts, and sometimes long and sometimes short. And this is caused by the
clouds on the horizon of the sky which interpose between part of this
mountain and the sun, and by cutting off some of the solar rays the
light on the mountain is intercepted by various intervals of clouds, and
therefore varies in the form of its brightness.

### THE DIVISIONS OF THE BOOK \[ <span id="fr_346"></span>[19](#fn_346.md)\]

The praise and confession of the faith \[ <span
id="fr_347"></span>[20](#fn_347.md)\]

The sudden inundation, to its end.

\[23\] The destruction of the city.

\[24\] The death of the people and their despair.

The preacher's search, his release and benevolence \[ <span
id="fr_348"></span>[28](#fn_348.md)\].

Description of the cause of this fall of the mountain \[ <span
id="fr_349"></span>[30](#fn_349.md)\].

The mischief it did.

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

\[32\] Fall of snow.

The finding of the prophet \[33\].

His prophesy.

\[35\] The inundation of the lower portion of Eastern Armenia, the
draining of which was effected by the cutting through the Taurus
Mountains <span id="fr_350"></span>[36](#fn_350.md).

How the new prophet showed <span id="fr_351"></span>[40](#fn_351.md) that
this destruction would happen as he had foretold.

Description of the Taurus Mountains \[43\] and the river Euphrates.

Why the mountain shines at the top, from half to a third of the night,
and looks like a comet to the inhabitants of the West after the sunset,
and before day to those of the East.

Why this comet appears of variable forms, so that it is now round and
now long, and now again divided into two or three parts, and now in one
piece, and when it is to be seen again.

### OF THE SHAPE OF THE TAURUS MOUNTAINS \[ <span id="fr_352"></span>[53](#fn_352.md)\]

 <span id="fr_353"></span>[54](#fn_353.md)I am not to be accused, Oh
Devatdar, of idleness, as your chidings seem to hint; but your excessive
love for me, which gave rise to the benefits you have conferred on me
\[55\] is that which has also compelled me to the utmost painstaking in
seeking out and diligently investigating the cause of so great and
stupendous an effect. And this could not be done without time; now, in
order to satisfy you fully as to the cause of so great an effect, it is
requisite that I should explain to you the form of the place, and then I
will proceed to the effect, by which I believe you will be amply
satisfied.

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

\[ <span id="fr_354"></span>[59](#fn_354.md)\]Do not be aggrieved, O
Devatdar, by my delay in responding to your pressing request, for those
things which you require of me are of such a nature that they cannot be
well expressed without some lapse of time; particularly because, in
order to explain the cause of so great an effect, it is necessary to
describe with accuracy the nature of the place; and by this means I can
afterwards easily satisfy your above-mentioned request.\[ <span
id="fr_355"></span>[62](#fn_355.md)\]

I will pass over any description of the form of Asia Minor, or as to
what seas or lands form the limits of its outline and extent, because I
know that by your own diligence and carefulness in your studies you have
not remained in ignorance of these matters \[65\]; and I will go on to
describe the true form of the Taurus Mountain which is the cause of this
stupendous and harmful marvel, and which will serve to advance us in our
purpose \[66\]. This Taurus is that mountain which, with many others is
said to be the ridge of Mount Caucasus; but wishing to be very clear
about it, I desired to speak to some of the inhabitants of the shores of
the Caspian sea, who give evidence that this must be the true Caucasus,
and that though their mountains bear the same name, yet these are
higher; and to confirm this in the Scythian tongue Caucasus means a very
high <span id="fr_356"></span>[68](#fn_356.md) peak, and in fact we have no
information of there being, in the East or in the West, any mountain so
high. And the proof of this is that the inhabitants of the countries to
the West see the rays of the sun illuminating a great part of its summit
for as much as a quarter of the longest night. And in the same way, in
those countries which lie to the East.

### OF THE STRUCTURE AND SIZE OF MOUNT TAURUS.

\[ <span id="fr_357"></span>[73](#fn_357.md)\] The shadow of this ridge of
the Taurus is of such a height that when, in the middle of June, the Sun
is at its meridian, its

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

shadow extends as far as the borders of Sarmatia, twelve days off; and
in the middle of December it extends as far as the Hyperborean
mountains, which are at a month's journey to the North \[75\]. And the
side which faces the wind is always free from clouds and mists, because
the wind which is parted in beating on the rock, closes again on the
further side of that rock, and in its motion carries with it the clouds
from all quarters and leaves them where it strikes. And it is always
full of thunderbolts from the great quantity of clouds which accumulate
there, whence the rock is all riven and full of huge d´bris\[ <span
id="fr_358"></span>[77](#fn_358.md)\]. This mountain, at its base, is
inhabited by a very rich population and is full of most beautiful
springs and rivers, and is fertile and abounding in all good produce,
particularly in those parts which face to the South. But after mounting
about three miles we begin to find forests of great fir trees, and beech
and other similar trees; after this, for a space of three more miles,
there are meadows and vast pastures; and all the rest, as far as the
beginning of the Taurus, is eternal snow

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

which never disappear at any time, and extend to a height of about
fourteen miles in all. From this beginning of the Taurus up to the
height of a mile the clouds never pass away; thus we have fifteen miles,
that is, a height of about five miles in a straight line; and the summit
of the peaks of the Taurus are as much, or about that. There, half way
up, we begin to find a scorching air and never feel a breath of wind;
but nothing can live long there; there nothing is brought forth save a
few birds of prey which breed in the high fissures of Taurus and descend
below the clouds to seek their prey. Above the wooded hills all is bare
rock, that is, from the clouds upwards; and the rock is the purest
white. And it is impossible to walk to the high summit on account of the
rough and perilous ascent.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_335"></span>[385:1336](1336.htm#fr_335.md) Lines 1-52 are
reproduced in facsimile on [Pl. CXVI](pl116.htm#img_pl116.md).

<span id="fn_336"></span>[385:1](1336.htm#fr_336.md) *Diodario.* This word
is not to be found in any Italian dictionary, and for a long time I
vainly sought an explanation of it. The youthful reminiscences of my
wife afforded the desired clue. The chief town of each Turkish Villayet,
or province --such as Broussa, for instance, in Asia Minor, is the
residence of a Defterdar, who presides over the financial affairs of the
province. *Defterdar hane* was, in former times, the name given to the
Ministry of Finance at Constantinople; the Minister of Finance to the
Porte is now known as the *Mallie-Nazri* and the *Defterdars* are his
subordinates. A *Defterdar*, at the present day is merely the head of
the finance department in each Provincial district. With regard to my
suggestion that Leonardo's *Diodario* might be identical with the
Defterdar of former times, the late M. C. DEFREMERIE, Arabic Professor,
and Membre de l'Institut de France wrote to me as follows: *Votre
conjecture est parfaitement fondee; diodario est Vequivalent de devadar
ou plus exactement devatdar, titre d'une importante dignite en Egypt'e,
sous les Mamlouks.*

The word however is not of Turkish, but of Perso-Arabie derivation.
*Defter* (Arabic) means *folio*; for *dar* (Persian) Bookkeeper or
holder is the English equivalent; and the idea is that of a deputy in
command. During the Mamelook supremacy over Syria, which corresponded in
date with Leonardo's time, the office of Defterdar was the third in
importance in the State.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[385:2](1336.htm#fr_337.md) *Soltano di
Babilonia*. The name of Babylon was commonly applied to Cairo in the
middle ages. For instance BREIDENBACH, *Itinerarium Hierosolyma* p. 218
says: "At last we reached Babylon. But this is not that Babylon which
stood on the further shore of the river Chober, but that which is called
the Egyptian Babylon. It is close by Cairo and the twain are but one and
not two towns; one half is called Cairo and the other Babylon, whence
they are called together Cairo-Babylon; originally the town is said to
have been named Memphis and then Babylon, but now it is called Cairo."
Compare No. 1085, 6.

Egypt was governed from 1382 till 1517 by the Borgite or Tcherkessian
dynasty of the Mamelook Sultans. One of the most famous of these, Sultan
Kait Bey, ruled from 1468-1496 during whose reign the Gama (or Mosque)
of Kait Bey and tomb of Kait Bey near the Okella Kait Bey were erected
in Cairo, which preserve his name to this day. Under the rule of this
great and wise prince many foreigners, particularly Italians, found
occupation in Egypt, as may be seen in the 'Viaggio di Josaphat
Barbaro', among other travellers. "Next to Leonardo (so I learn from
Prof. Jac. Burckhardt of Bale) Kait Bey's most helpful engineer was a
German <span id="page_386">p. 386</span> who in about 1487,
superintended the construction of the Mole at Alexandria. Felix Fabri
knew him and mentions him in his *Historia Suevorum*, written in 1488."

<span id="fn_338"></span>[385:3](1336.htm#fr_338.md) *Il nuovo accidente
accaduto*, or as Leonardo first wrote and then erased, *e accaduto un
nuovo accidente*. From the sequel this must refer to an earthquake, and
indeed these were frequent at that period, particularly in Asia Minor,
where they caused immense mischief. See No. 1101 note.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[386:4](1336.htm#fr_339.md) The text here breaks
off. The following lines are a fresh beginning of a letter, evidently
addressed to the same person, but, as it would seem, written at a later
date than the previous text. The numerous corrections and amendments
amply prove that it is not a copy from any account of a journey by some
unknown person; but, on the contrary, that Leonardo was particularly
anxious to choose such words and phrases as might best express his own
ideas.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[386:5](1336.htm#fr_340.md) *Parti d'Erminia*. See
No. 945, note. The extent of Armenia in Leonardo's time is only
approximately known. In the XVth century the Persians governed the
Eastern, and the Arabs the Southern portions. Arabic authors--as, for
instance Abulfeda--include Cilicia and a part of Cappadocia in Armenia,
and Greater Armenia was the tract of that country known later as
Turcomania, while Armenia Minor was the territory between Cappadocia and
the Euphrates. It was not till 1522, or even 1574 that the whole country
came under the dominion of the Ottoman Turks, in the reign of Selim I.

The Mamelook Sultans of Egypt seem to have taken a particular interest
in this, the most Northern province of their empire, which was even then
in danger of being conquered by the Turks. In the autumn of 1477 Sultan
Kait Bey made a journey of inspection, visiting Antioch and the valleys
of the Tigris and Euphrates with a numerous and brilliant escort. This
tour is briefly alluded to by *Moodshireddin* p. 561; and by WEIL,
*Geschichte der Abbasiden* V, p. 358. An anonymous member of the suite
wrote a diary of the expedition in Arabic, which has been published by
R. V. LONZONE (*'Viaggio in Palestina e Soria di Kaid Ba XVIII sultano
della II dinastia mamelucca, fatto nel 1477. Testo arabo. Torino 1878'*,
without notes or commentary). Compare the critique on this edition, by
J. GILDEMEISTER in *Zeitschrift des Deutschen Palaestina Vereins* (Vol.
Ill p. 246--249). Lanzone's edition seems to be no more than an abridged
copy of the original. I owe to Professor Sche'fer, Membre de l'Institut,
the information that he is in possession of a manuscript in which the
text is fuller, and more correctly given. The Mamelook dynasty was, as
is well known, of Circassian origin, and a large proportion of the
Egyptian Army was recruited in Circassia even so late as in the XVth
century. That was a period of political storms in Syria and Asia Minor
and it is easy to suppose that the Sultan's minister, to whom Leonardo
addresses his report as his superior, had a special interest in the
welfare of those frontier provinces. Only to mention a few historical
events of Sultan Kait Bey's reign, we find that in 1488 he assisted the
Circassians to resist the encroachments of Alaeddoulet, an Asiatic
prince who had allied himself with the Osmanli to threaten the province;
the consequence was a war in Cilicia by sea and land, which broke out in
the following year between the contending powers. Only a few years
earlier the same province had been the scene of the so-called Caramenian
war in which the united Venetian, Neapolitan and Sclavonic fleets had
been engaged. (See CORIALANO CIPPICO, *Della guerra dei Veneziani nell'
Asia dal* 1469--1474. Venezia 1796, p. 54) and we learn incidentally
that a certain Leonardo Boldo, Governor of Scutari under Sultan
Mahmoud,--as his name would indicate, one of the numerous renegades of
Italian birth--played an important part in the negotiations for peace.

*Tu mi mandasti*. The address *tu* to a personage so high in office is
singular and suggests personal intimacy; Leonardo seems to have been a
favourite with the Diodario. Compare lines 54 and 55.

I have endeavoured to show, and I believe that I am also in a position
to prove with regard to these texts, that they are draughts of letters
actually written by Leonardo; at the same time I must not omit to
mention that shortly after I had discovered <span id="page_387">p.
387</span> these texts in the Codex Atlanticus and publi- shed a paper
on the subject in the *Zeit- schrift fur bildende Kunst (Vol. XVI)*,
Prof. Govi put forward this hypothesis to account for their origin:

*"Quanto alle notizie sul monte Tauro, sull'Armenia e sull' Asia minore
che si contengono negli altri frammenti, esse vennero prese da qualche
geografro o viaggiatore contemporaneo. Dall'indice imperfetto che
accompagna quei frammenti, si potrebbe dedurre che Leonardo volesse
farne un libro, che poi non venne compiuto. A ogni modo, non e possibile
di trovare in questi brani nessun indizio di un viaggio di Leonardo in
oriente, ne della sua conversione alla religione di Maometto, come
qualcuno pretenderebbe. Leonardo amava con passione gli studi
geografici, e nel suoi scritti s'incontran spesso itinerart,
indicazioni, o descrizioni di luoghi, schizzi di carte e abbozzi
topografici di varie regioni, non e quindi strano che egli, abile
narratore com'era, si fosse proposto di scrivere una specie di Romanzo
in forma epistolare svolgendone Pintreccio nell'Asia Minore, intorno
alla quale i libri d'allora, e forse qualche viaggiatore amico suo, gli
avevano somministrato alcuni elementi piu o meno* fantastici. (See
Transunti della Reale Accademia dei Lincei Voi. V Ser. 3).

It is hardly necessary to point out that Prof. Govi omits to name the
sources from which Leonardo could be supposed to have drawn his
information, and I may leave it to the reader to pronounce judgment on
the anomaly which is involved in the hypothesis that we have here a
fragment of a Romance, cast in the form of a correspondence. At the same
time, I cannot but admit that the solution of the difficulties proposed
by Prof. Govi is, under the circumstances, certainly the easiest way of
dealing with the question. But we should then be equally justified in
supposing some more of Leonardo's letters to be fragments of such
romances; particularly those of which the addresses can no longer be
named. Still, as regards these drafts of letters to the Diodario, if we
accept the Romance theory, as pro- posed by Prof. Govi, we are also
compelled to assume that Leonardo purposed from the first to illustrate
his tale; for it needs only a glance at the sketches on [Pl.
CXVI](pl116.htm#img_pl116.md) to CXIX to perceive that they are connected
with the texts; and of course the rest of Leonardo's numerous notes on
matters pertaining to the East, the greater part of which are here
published for the first time, may also be somehow connected with this
strange romance.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[387:7](1336.htm#fr_341.md) *Città de Calindra*
(*Chalindra*). The position of this city is so exactly determined,
between the valley of the Euphrates and the Taurus range that it ought
to be possible to identify it. But it can hardly be the same as the sea
port of Cilicia with a somewhat similar name Celenderis, Kelandria,
Celendria, Kilindria, now the Turkish Gulnar. In two Catalonian
Portulans in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris-one dating from the
XV<sup>th</sup> century, by Wilhelm von Soler, the other by Olivez de
Majorca, in l584--I find this place called Calandra. But Leonardo's
Calindra must certainly have lain more to the North West, probably
somewhere in Kurdistan. The fact that the geographical position is so
carefully determined by Leonardo seems to prove that it was a place of
no great importance and little known. It is singular that the words
first written in l. 8 were *divisa dal lago* (Lake Van?), altered
afterwards to *dall'Eufrates*.

*Nostri confini*, and in 1. 6 *proposito nostro*. These refer to the
frontier and to the affairs of the Mamelook Sultan, Lines 65 and 66
throw some light on the purpose of Leonardo's mission.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[387:8](1336.htm#fr_342.md) *I corni del gra mote
Tauro*. Compare the sketches [Pl. CXVI](pl116.htm#img_pl116.md)-CXVIII. So
long as it is impossible to identify the situation of Calindra it is
most difficult to decide with any certainty which peak of the Taurus is
here meant; and I greatly regret that I had no foreknowledge of this
puzzling topographical question when, in 1876, I was pursuing
archaeological enquiries in the Provinces of Aleppo and Cilicia, and had
to travel for some time in view of the imposing snow-peaks of Bulghar
Dagh and Ala Tepessi.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[387:9](1336.htm#fr_343.md)-10 The opinion here
expressed as to the height of the mountain would be unmeaning, unless it
had been written before Leonardo moved to Milan, where Monte Rosa is so
conspicuous an object in the landscape. 4 *ore inanzi* seems to mean,
four hours before the sun's rays penetrate to the bottom of the valleys.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[388:11](1336.htm#fr_344.md) *Pietra
bianchissima*. The Taurus Mountains consist in great part of limestone.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[388:14](1336.htm#fr_345.md) *Appresso di voi*.
Leonardo had at first written *noi* as though his meaning had,been: This
peak appeared to us to be a comet when you and I observed it in North
Syria (at Aleppo? at Aintas?). The description of the curious reflection
in the evening, resembling the "Alpine-glow" is certainly not an
invented fiction, for in the next lines an explanation of the phenomenon
is offered, or at least attempted.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[388:19](1336.htm#fr_346.md) The next 33 lines are
evidently the contents of a connected Report or Book, but not of one
which he had at hand; more probably, indeed, of one he purposed writing.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[388:20](1336.htm#fr_347.md) *Persuasione di
fede*, of the Christian or the Mohammedan faith? We must suppose the
latter, at the beginning of a document addressed to so high a Mohammedan
official. *Predica* probably stands as an abbreviation for
*predicazione* (lat. *praedicatio*) in the sense of praise or
glorification; very probably it may mean some such initial doxology as
we find in Mohammedan works. (Comp. 1. 40.)

<span id="fn_348"></span>[388:28](1336.htm#fr_348.md) The phraseology of
this is too general for any conjecture as to its meaning to be worth
hazarding.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[388:30](1336.htm#fr_349.md) *Ruina del monte*. Of
course by an earthquake. In a catalogue of earthquakes, entitled *kechf
aussalssalèb an auasf ezzel-zelèh*, and written by Djelal eddin <span
id="page_389">p. 389</span> Syouthy, the following statement occurs: "In
the year 889 (1484 A.D.) there were six shocks of earthquake at Aleppo.
They were excessively violent and threw the inhabitants into
consternation." I owe this communication to the kindness of Prof. Ch.
Schefer, Membre de l'Institut, to whom this unpublished Arabic MS.
belongs. The foregoing entries refer to two earthquakes in Cairo, in
1476 and 1481: the following ones indicate a time at which Leonardo was,
certainly, living in Milan.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[389:36](1336.htm#fr_350.md) *Tagliata di Monte
Tauro*. The Euphrates flows through the Taurus range near the influx of
the Kura Shai; it rushes through a rift in the wildest cliffs from 2000
to 3000 feet high and runs on for 90 miles in 300 falls or rapids till
it reaches Telek, near which at a spot called Gleikash, or the Hart's
leap, it measures only 35 paces across. Compare the map on [Pl.
CXIX](pl119.htm#img_pl119) and the explanation [for](errata.htm#2.md).

<span id="fn_351"></span>[389:40](1336.htm#fr_351.md) *Nova profeta*, 1.
33, *profeta*. Mohammed. Leonardo here refers to the Koran:

*In the name of the most merciful God.--When the earth shall be shaken
by an earthquake; and the earth shall cast forth her burdens; and a man
shall say, what aileth her? On that day the earth shall declare her
tidings, for that thy Lord will inspire her. On that day men shall go
forward in distinct classes, that they may behold their works. And
whoever shall have wrought good of the weight of an ant, shall behold
the same. And whoever shall have wrought evil of the weight of an ant,
shall behold the same.* (The Koran, translated by G. Sale, Chapter XCIX,
p. 452).

<span id="fn_352"></span>[389:53](1336.htm#fr_352.md)--94: The facsimile of
this passage is given on [Pl. CXVII](pl117.htm#img_pl117.md).

<span id="fn_353"></span>[389:54](1336.htm#fr_353.md) The foregoing sketch
of a letter, lines 5. 18, appears to have remained a fragment when
Leonardo received pressing orders which caused him to write immediately
and fully on the subject mentioned in line 43.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[390:59](1336.htm#fr_354.md) This passage was
evidently intended as an improvement on that immediately preceding it.
The purport of both is essentially the same, but the first is pitched in
a key of ill-disguised annoyance which is absent from the second. I do
not see how these two versions can be reconciled with the romance-theory
held by Prof. Govi.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[390:62](1336.htm#fr_355.md) This passage was

The purport of both is essentially the same, but the first is pitched in

<span id="fn_357"></span>[390:73](1336.htm#fr_357.md)--75: The statements
are of course founded on those of the 'inhabitants' spoken of in l. 67.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[391:77](1336.htm#fr_358.md) Sudden storms are
equally common on the heights of Ararat. It is hardly necessary to
observe that Ararat cannot be meant here. Its summit is formed like the
crater of Vesuvius. The peaks sketched on [Pl.
CXVI](pl116.htm#img_pl116.md)-CXVIII are probably views of the same
mountain, taken from different sides. Near the solitary peak, [Pl.
CXVIII](pl118.htm#img_pl118.md) these three names are written *goba,
arnigasar, caruda*, names most likely of different peaks. [Pl.

original on a single sheet folded down the middle, 30 centimetres high
and 43 1/2 wide. On the reverse of one half of the sheet are notes on
*peso* and *bilancia* (weight and balance), on the other are the
'prophecies' printed under Nos. 1293 and 1294. It is evident from the
arrangement that these were written subsequently, on the space which had
been left blank. These pages are facsimiled on [Pl.
CXVIII](pl118.htm#img_pl118). In [Pl. CXVI](pl116.htm#img_pl116.md)-CXVIII
the size is smaller than in the original; the map of Armenia, [Pl.
CXVIII](pl118.htm#img_pl118), is on [Pl. CXIX](pl119.htm#img_pl119.md)
slightly enlarged. On this map we find the following names, beginning
from the right hand at the top: *pariardes mo* (for Paryadres Mons, Arm.
Parchar, now Barchal or Kolai Dagh; Trebizond is on its slope).

*Aquilone* --North, *Antitaurus Antitaurus psis mo* ///// (probably
meant for Thospitis = Lake Van, Arm. Dgov Vanai, Tospoi, and the
Mountain range to the South); *Gordis mo* (Mountains of Gordyaea), the
birth place of the Tigris; *Oriente* --East; *Tigris*, and then, to the
left, *Eufrates*. Then, above to the left *Argeo mo* (now Erdshigas, an
extinct volcano, 12000 feet high); *Celeno mo* (no doubt Sultan Dagh in
Pisidia). Celeno is the Greek town of Κελαιναί-- see Arian I, 29,
I--(now the ruins of Dineir); *oriente* --East; *africo libezco* (for
libeccio--South West). In the middle of the Euphrates river on this
small map we see a shaded portion surrounded by mountains, perhaps to
indicate the inundation mentioned in l. 35. The affluent to the
Euphrates shown as coming with many windings from the high land of
'Argeo' on the West, is the Tochma Su, which joins the main river at
Malatie. I have not been able to discover any map of Armenia of the XVth
or XVIth century in which the course of the Euphrates is laid down with
any thing like the correctness displayed in this sketch. The best I have
seen is the Catalonian Portulan of Olivez de Majorca, executed in 1584,
and it is far behind Leonardo's.
