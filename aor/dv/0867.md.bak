### THE METHOD OF PROVING THAT THE EARTH IS A STAR.

<span id="img_v214000"></span> ![](img/v214000.jpg)

First describe the eye; then show how the twinkling of a star is really
in the eye and why one star should twinkle more than another, and how
the rays from the stars originate in the eye; and add, that if the
twinkling of the stars were really in the stars --as it seems to
be--that this twinkling appears to be an extension as great as the
diameter of the body of the star; therefore, the star being larger than
the earth, this motion effected in an instant would be a rapid doubling
of the size of the star. Then prove that the surface of the air where it
lies contiguous to fire, and the surface of the fire where it ends are
those into which the solar rays penetrate, and transmit the images of
the heavenly bodies, large when they rise, and small, when they are on
the meridian. Let *a* be the earth and *n d m* the surface of the air in
contact with the sphere of fire; *h f g* is the orbit of the moon or, if
you please, of the sun; then I say that when the sun appears on the
horizon *g*, its rays are seen passing through the surface of the air at
a slanting angle, that is *o m*; this is not the case at *d k*. And so
it passes through a greater mass of air; all of *e m* is a denser
atmosphere.
