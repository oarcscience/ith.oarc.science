*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1021.

I have already been to see a great variety (of atmospheric effects). And
lately over Milan towards Lago Maggiore I saw a

cloud in the form of an immense mountain full of rifts of glowing light,
because the rays of the sun, which was already close to the horizon and
red, tinged the cloud with its own hue. And this cloud attracted to it
all the little clouds that were near while the large one did not move
from its place; thus it retained on its summit the reflection of the
sunlight till an hour and a half after sunset, so immensely large was
it; and about two hours after sunset such a violent wind arose, that it
was really tremendous and unheard of.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_213"></span>[235:547](1021.htm#fr_213.md) : *di arie* is
wanting in the original but may safely be inserted in the context, as
the formation of clouds is under discussion before this text.
