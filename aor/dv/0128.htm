<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> General remarks (128. 129).</FONT></span>Light is the chaser away of darkness. Shade is the obstruction of
light. Primary light is that which falls on objects and causes light
and shade. And derived lights are those portions of a body which are
illuminated by the primary light. A primary shadow is that side of a
body on which the light cannot fall.

<P><P>
The general distribution of shadow and light is that sum total of
the rays thrown off by a shaded or illuminated body passing through
the air without any interference and the spot which intercepts and
cuts off the distribution of the dark and light rays.
<P>
And the eye can best distinguish the forms of objects when it is
placed between the shaded and the illuminated parts.
