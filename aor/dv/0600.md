*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 600.

### OF SETTING ON THE LIMBS.

The limbs which are used for labour must be muscular and those which are
not much used you must make without muscles and softly rounded.

### OF THE ACTION OF THE FIGURES.

Represent your figures in such action as may be fitted to express what
purpose is in the mind of each; otherwise your art will not be
admirable.
