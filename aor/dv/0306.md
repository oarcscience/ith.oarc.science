*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 306.

The surface of an object partakes of the colour of the light which
illuminates it; and of the colour of the atmosphere which lies between
the eye and that object, that is of the colour of the transparent medium
lying between the object and the eye; and among colours of a similar
character the second will be of the same tone as the first, and this is
caused by the increased thickness of the colour of the medium lying
between the object and the eye.
