### 542.

### WHY GROUPS OF FIGURES ONE ABOVE ANOTHER ARE TO BE AVOIDED.

The universal practice which painters adopt on the walls of chapels is
greatly and reasonably to be condemned. Inasmuch as they represent one
historical subject on one level with a landscape and buildings, and then
go up a step and paint another, varying the point \[of sight\], and then
a third and a fourth, in such a way as that on one wall there are 4
points of sight, which is supreme folly in such painters. We know that
the

point of sight is opposite the eye of the spectator of the scene; and if
you would \[have me\] tell you how to represent the life of a saint
divided into several pictures on one and the same wall, I answer that
you must set out the foreground with its point of sight on a level with
the eye of the spectator of the scene, and upon this plane represent the
more important part of the story large and then, diminishing by degrees
the figures, and the buildings on various hills and open spaces, you can
represent all the events of the history. And on the remainder of the
wall up to the top put trees, large as compared with the figures, or
angels if they are appropriate to the story, or birds or clouds or
similar objects; otherwise do not trouble yourself with it for your
whole work will be wrong.
