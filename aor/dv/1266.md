*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1266.

### A FABLE.

The thrushes rejoiced greatly at seeing a man take the owl and deprive
her of liberty, tying her feet with strong bonds. But this owl was
afterwards by means of bird-lime the cause of the thrushes losing not
only their liberty, but their life. This is said for those countries
which rejoice in seeing their governors lose their liberty, when by that
means they themselves lose all succour, and remain in bondage in the
power of their enemies, losing their liberty and often their life.
