### 977.

<span class="margnote"> The origin of the sand in rivers (977.
978).</span>A river that flows from mountains deposits a great quantity
of large stones in its bed, which still have some of their angles and
sides, and in the course of its flow it carries down smaller stones with
the angles more worn; that is to say the large stones become smaller.
And farther on it deposits coarse gravel and then smaller, and as it
proceeds this becomes coarse sand and then finer, and going on thus the
water, turbid with sand and gravel, joins the sea; and the sand settles
on the sea-shores, being cast up by the salt waves; and there results
the sand of so fine a nature as to seem almost like water, and it will
not stop on the shores of the sea but returns by reason of its
lightness, because it was originally formed of rotten leaves and other
very light things. Still, being almost--as was said--of the nature of
water itself, it afterwards, when the weather is calm, settles and
becomes solid at the bottom of the sea, where by its fineness it becomes
compact and by its smoothness resists the waves which glide over it; and
in this shells are found; and this is white earth, fit for pottery.
