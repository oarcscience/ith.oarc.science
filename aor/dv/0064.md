*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

produced by the objects existing in it. These intersect and cross each
other with independent convergence without interfering with each other
and pass through all the surrounding atmosphere; and

are of equal force and value--all being equal to each, each to all. And
by means of these, images of the body are transmitted everywhere and on
all sides, and each receives in itself every minutest portion of the
object that produces it.

Proof by experiment (65-66).
