### 592.

### OF GRACE IN THE LIMBS.

<span id="img_v129500"></span> ![](img/v129500.jpg)

<span class="margnote"> How to pose figures.</span>The limbs should be
adapted to the body with grace and with reference to the effect that you
wish the figure to produce. And if you wish to produce a figure that
shall of itself look light and graceful you must make the limbs elegant
and extended, and without too much display of the muscles; and those few
that are needed for your purpose you must indicate softly, that is, not
very prominent and without strong shadows; the limbs, and particularly
the arms easy; that is, none of the limbs should be in a straight line
with the adjoining parts. And if the hips, which are the pole of a man,
are by reason of his position, placed so, that the right is higher than
the left, make the point of the higher shoulder in a perpendicular line
above the highest prominence of the hip, and let this right shoulder be
lower than the left. Let the pit of the throat always be over the centre
of the joint of the foot on which the man is leaning. The leg which is
free should have the knee lower than the other, and near the other leg.
The positions of the head and arms are endless and I shall therefore not
enlarge on any rules for them. Still, let them be easy and pleasing,
with various turns and twists, and the joints gracefully bent, that they
may not look like pieces of wood.
