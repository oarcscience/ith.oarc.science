*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1306.

(Of Children who are suckled.)

Many Franciscans, Dominicans and Benedictines will eat that which at
other times was eaten by others, who for some months to come will not be
able to speak.

(Of Cockles and Sea Snails which are thrown up by the sea and which rot
inside their shells.)

How many will there be who, after they are dead, will putrefy inside
their own houses, filling all the surrounding air with a fetid smell.
