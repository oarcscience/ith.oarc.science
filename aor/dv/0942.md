### OF THE SEA, WHICH TO MANY FOOLS APPEARS TO BE HIGHER THAN THE EARTH WHICH FORMS ITS SHORE.

<span class="margnote"> The relative height of the surface of the sea to
that of the land (942-945).</span>*b d* is a plain through which a river
flows to the sea; this plain ends at the sea, and since in fact the dry
land that is uncovered is not perfectly level--for, if it were, the
river would have no motion--as the river does move, this place is a
slope rather than a plain; hence this plain *d b* so ends where the
sphere of water begins that if it were extended in a continuous line to
*b a* it would go down beneath the sea, whence it follows that the sea
*a c b* looks higher than the dry land.

Obviously no portions of dry land left uncovered by water can ever be
lower than the surface of the watery sphere.
