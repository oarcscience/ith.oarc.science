### OF TOWNS OR OTHER BUILDINGS SEEN IN THE EVENING OR THE MORNING THROUGH THE MIST.

Of buildings seen at a great distance in the evening or the morning, as
in mist or dense atmosphere, only those portions are seen in brightness
which are lighted up by the sun which is near the horizon; and those
portions which are not lighted up by the sun remain almost of the same
colour and medium tone as the mist.

### WHY OBJECTS WHICH ARE HIGH UP AND AT A DISTANCE ARE DARKER THAN THE LOWER ONES, EVEN IF THE MIST IS UNIFORMLY DENSE.

Of objects standing in a mist or other dense atmosphere, whether from
vapour or smoke or distance, those will be most visible which are the
highest. And among objects of equal height that will be the darkest
\[strongest\] which has for background the deepest mist. Thus the eye
*h* looking at *a b c*, towers of equal height, one with another, sees
*c* the top of the first tower at *r*, at two degrees of depth in the
mist; and sees the height of the middle tower *b* through one single
degree of mist. Therefore the top of the tower *c* appears stronger than
the top of the tower *b*, &c
