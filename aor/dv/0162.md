### 162.

### OF SHADOW.

Derived shadows are of three kinds of which one is spreading, the second
columnar, the third converging to the point where the two sides meet and
intersect, and beyond this intersection the sides are infinitely
prolonged or straight lines. And if you say, this shadow must terminate
at the angle where the sides meet and extend no farther, I deny this,
because above in the first on shadow I have proved: that a thing is
completely terminated when no portion of it goes beyond its terminating
lines. Now here, in this shadow, we see the converse of this, in as much
as where this derived shadow originates we obviously have the figures of
two pyramids of shadow which meet at their angles. Hence, if, as \[my\]
opponent says, the first pyramid of shadow terminates the derivative
shadow at the angle whence it starts, then the second pyramid of
shadow--so says the adversary--must be caused by the angle and not from
the body in shadow; and this is disproved with the help of the 2nd of
this which says: Shadow is a condition produced by a body casting a
shadow, and interposed between this shadow and the luminous body. By
this it is made clear that the shadow is not produced by the angle of
the derived shadow but only by the body casting the shadow; &c If a
spherical solid body is illuminated by a light of elongated form the
shadow produced by the longest portion of this light will have less
defined outlines than that which is produced by the breadth of the same
light. And this is proved by what was said before, which is: That a
shadow will have less defined outlines in proportion as the light which
causes it is larger, and conversely, the outlines are clearer in
proportion as it is smaller.
