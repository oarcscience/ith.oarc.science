It can be proved why the shadow *o p c h* is darker in proportion as it
is nearer to the line *p h* and is lighter in proportion as it is nearer
to the line *o c*. Let the light *a b*, be a window, and let the dark
wall in which this window is, be *b s*, that is, one of the sides of the
wall.

Then we may say that the line *p h* is darker than any other part of the
space *o p c h*, because this line faces the whole surface in shadow of

the wall *b s*. The line *o c* is lighter than the other part of this
space *o p c h*, because this line faces the luminous space *a b*.

Where the shadow is larger, or smaller, or equal the body which casts
it.

### OF THE COMPOUND SHADOW *F, R, C, H* CAUSED BY A SINGLE LIGHT.

<span id="img_v110000"></span> ![](img/v110000.jpg)

The shadow *f r c h* is under such conditions as that where it is
farthest from its inner side it loses depth in proportion. To prove
this:

Let *d a*, be the light and *f n* the solid body, and let *a e* be one
of the side walls of the window that is *d a*. Then I say--according to
the 2nd \[proposition\]: that the surface of any body is affected by the
tone of the objects surrounding it,--that the side *r c*, which faces
the dark wall *a e* must participate of its darkness and, in the same
way that the outer surface which faces the light *d a* participates of
the light; thus we get the outlines of the extremes on each side of the
centre included between them.\]

This is divided into four parts. The first the extremes, which include
the compound shadow, secondly the compound shadow between these
extremes.
