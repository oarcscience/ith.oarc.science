### 321.

The nose will make a double square; that is the width of the nose at the
nostrils goes twice into the length from the tip of the nose to the
eyebrows. And, in the same way, in profile the distance from the extreme
side of the nostril where it joins the cheek to the tip of the nose is
equal to the width of the nose in front from one nostril to the other.
If you divide the whole length of the nose--that is from the tip to the
insertion of the eyebrows, into 4 equal parts, you will find that one of
these parts extends from the tip of the nostrils to the base of the
nose, and the upper division lies between the inner corner of the eye
and the insertion of the eyebrows; and the two middle parts \[together\]
are equal to the length of the eye from the inner to the outer corner.
