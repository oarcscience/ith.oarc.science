*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1304.

And those who feed on grass will turn night into day (Tallow.)

And many creatures of land and water will go up among the stars ( that
is Planets.)

The dead will be seen carrying the living (in Carts and Ships in various
places.)

Food shall be taken out of the mouth of many (the oven's mouth.)

And those which will have their food in their mouth will be deprived of
it by the hands of others (the oven.)
