### 135.

### OF LIGHT AND LUSTRE.

What is the difference between light and the lustre which is seen on the
polished surface of opaque bodies?

The lights which are produced from the polished surface of opaque bodies
will be stationary on stationary objects even if the eye on which they
strike moves. But reflected lights will, on those same objects, appear
in as many different places on the surface as different positions are
taken by the eye.

### WHAT BODIES HAVE LIGHT UPON THEM WITHOUT LUSTRE?

Opaque bodies which have a hard and rough surface never display any
lustre in any portion of the side on which the light falls.

### WHAT BODIES WILL DISPLAY LUSTRE BUT NOT LOOK ILLUMINATED?

Those bodies which are opaque and hard with a hard surface reflect light
\[lustre\] from every spot on the illuminated side which is in a
position to receive light at the same angle of incidence as they occupy
with regard to the eye; but, as the surface mirrors all the surrounding
objects, the illuminated \[body\] is not recognisable in these portions
of the illuminated body.
