### THE REASON OF THE INCREASED SIZE OF THE SUN IN THE WEST.

Some mathematicians explain that the sun looks larger as it sets,
because the eye always sees it through a denser atmosphere, alleging
that objects seen through mist or through water appear larger. To these
I reply: No; because objects seen through a mist are

similar in colour to those at a distance; but not being similarly
diminished they appear larger. Again, nothing increases in size in
smooth water; and the proof of this may be seen by throwing a light on a
board placed half under water. But the reason why the sun looks larger
is that every luminous body appears larger in proportion as it is more
remote.  <span id="fr_117"></span>[451](#fn_117.md)

thus rendered by M. RAVAISSON in his edition of MS. A. "*De meme, aucune
chose ne croit dans l'eau plane, et tu en feras l'experience* en
calquant un ais sous l'eau."--Compare the diagrams in Vol. I, p. 114.
