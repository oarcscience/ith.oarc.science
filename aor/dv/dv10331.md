### *VI.*

### *and*

### *'Prospettiva aerea' (Aerial Perspective).*

*Leonardo distinctly separates these branches of his subject, as may be
seen in the beginning of No.* 295. *Attempts have been made to cast
doubts on the results which Leonardo arrived at by experiment on the
perspective of colour, but not with justice, as may be seen from the
original text of section* 294.

*The question as to the composition of the atmosphere, which is
inseparable from a discussion on Aerial Perspective, forms a separate
theory which is treated at considerable length. Indeed the author enters
into it so fully that we cannot escape the conviction that he must have
dwelt with particular pleasure on this part of his subject, and that he
attached great importance to giving it a character of general
applicability.*
