### 947.

For the third and last reason we will say that salt is in all created
things; and this we learn from water passed over the ashes and cinders
of burnt things; and the urine of every animal, and the superfluities
issuing from their bodies, and the earth into which all things are
converted by corruption.

But,--to put it better,--given that the world is everlasting, it must be
admitted that its population will also be eternal; hence the human
species has eternally been and would be consumers of salt; and if all
the mass of the earth were to be turned into salt,

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

it would not suffice for all human food  <span
id="fr_167"></span>[501](#fn_167.md) ; whence we are forced to admit,
either that the species of salt must be everlasting like the world, or
that it dies and is born again like the men who devour it. But as
experience teaches us that it does not die, as is evident by fire, which
does not consume it, and by water which becomes salt in proportion to
the quantity dissolved in it,--and when it is evaporated the salt always
remains in the original quantity--it must pass through the bodies of men
either in the urine or the sweat or other excretions where it is found
again; and as much salt is thus got rid of as is carried every year into
towns; therefore salt is dug in places where there is urine.-- Sea hogs
and sea winds are salt.

We will say that the rains which penetrate the earth are what is under
the foundations of cities with their inhabitants, and are what restore
through the internal passages of the earth the saltness taken from the
sea; and that the change in the place of the sea, which has been over
all the mountains, caused it to be left there in the mines found in
those mountains, &c

supposition that salt, once consumed, disappears for ever.
