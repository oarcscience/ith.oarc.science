*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 584.

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

### THAT A FIGURE IS NOT ADMIRABLE UNLESS IT EXPRESSES BY ITS ACTION THE PASSION OF ITS SENTIMENT.

<span class="margnote"> Of representing the emotions.</span>That figure
is most admirable which by its actions best expresses the passion that
animates it.

### HOW AN ANGRY MAN IS TO BE FIGURED.

You must make an angry person holding someone by the hair, wrenching his
head against the ground, and with one knee on his ribs; his right arm
and fist raised on high. His hair must be thrown up, his brow downcast
and knit, his teeth clenched and the two corners of his mouth grimly
set; his neck swelled and bent forward as he leans over his foe, and
full of furrows.

### HOW TO REPRESENT A MAN IN DESPAIR.

You must show a man in despair with a knife, having already torn open
his garments, and with one hand tearing open the wound. And make him
standing on his feet and his legs somewhat bent and his whole person
leaning towards the earth; his hair flying in disorder.
