*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 12.

Many will think they may reasonably blame me by alleging that my proofs
are opposed to the authority of certain men held in the highest
reverence by their inexperienced judgments; not considering that my
works are the issue of pure and simple experience, who is the one true
mistress. These rules are sufficient to enable you to know the true from
the false--and this aids men to look only for things that are possible
and with due moderation--and not to wrap yourself in ignorance, a thing
which can have no good result, so that in despair you would give
yourself up to melancholy.
