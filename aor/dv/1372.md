### Footnotes

<span id="fn_393"></span>[416:699](1372.htm#fr_393) : This statement of
Ser Piero's age contradicts that of the *Riassunto della portata di
Antonio da Vinci* (Leonardo's grandfather), who speaks of Ser Piero as
being thirty years old in 1457; and that of the *Riassunto della portata
di Ser Piero e Francesco*, sons of Antonia da Vinci, where Ser Piero is
mentioned as being forty in 1469. These documents were published by G.
UZIELLI, *Ricerche intorno a L. da Vinci, Firenze*, 1872, pp. 144 and
146. Leonardo was, as is well known, a natural son. His mother 'La
Catarina' was married in 1457 to Acchattabriga di Piero del Vaccha da
Vinci. She died in 1519. Leonardo never mentions her in the Manuscripts.
In the year of Leonardo's birth Ser Piero married Albiera di Giovanni
Amadoci, and after her death at the age of thirty eight he again
married, Francesca, daughter of Ser Giovanni Lanfredi, then only
fifteen. Their children were Leonardo's halfbrothers, Antonio (b. 1476),
Ser Giuliano (b. 1479), Lorenzo (b. 1484), a girl, Violante (b. 1485),
and another boy Domenico (b. 1486); Domenico's descendants still exist
as a family. Ser Piero married for the third time Lucrezia di Guglielmo
Cortigiani by whom he had six children: Margherita (b. 1491), Benedetto
(b. 1492), Pandolfo (b. 1494), Guglielmo (b. 1496), Bartolommeo (b.
1497), and Giovanni) date of birth unknown). Pierino da Vinci the
sculptor (about 1520-1554) was the son of Bartolommeo, the fifth of
these children. The dates of their deaths are not known, but we may
infer from the above passage that they were all still living in 1505.
