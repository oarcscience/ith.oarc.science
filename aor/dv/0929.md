### THE BEGINNING OF THE TREATISE ON WATER.

<span class="margnote"> General introduction.</span>By the ancients man
has been called the world in miniature; and certainly this name is well
bestowed, because, inasmuch as man is composed of earth, water, air and
fire, his body resembles that of the earth; and as man has in him bones
the supports and framework of his flesh, the world has its rocks the
supports of the earth; as man has in him a pool of blood in which the
lungs rise and fall in breathing, so the body of the earth has its ocean
tide which likewise rises and falls every six hours, as if the world
breathed; as in that pool of blood veins have their origin, which ramify
all over the human body, so likewise the ocean sea fills the body of the
earth with infinite springs of water. The body of the earth lacks sinews
and this is, because the sinews are made expressely for movements and,
the world being perpetually stable, no movement takes place, and no
movement taking place, muscles are not necessary. --But in all other
points they are much alike.
