<P>
The derived shadow of the dark walls on each side of the bright
light of the window are what mingle their various degrees of shade
with the light derived from the window; and these various depths of
shade modify every portion of the light, except where it is
strongest, at <I>c</I>. To prove this let <I>d a</I> be the primary shadow
which is turned towards the point <I>e</I>, and darkens it by its derived
shadow; as may be seen by the triangle &#9651; <I>a e d</I>, in which the
angle <I>e</I> faces the darkened base <I>d a e</I>; the point <I>v</I> faces the
dark shadow <I>a s</I> which is part of <I>a d</I>, and as the whole is
greater than a part, <I>e</I>
<P><A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A></P>
<P>which faces the whole base [of the
triangle], will be in deeper shadow than <I>v</I> which only faces part
of it. In consequence of the conclusion [shown] in the above
diagram, <I>t</I> will be less darkened than <I>v</I>, because the base of the
&#9651; <I>t</I> is part of the base of the &#9651; <I>v</I>; and in the same way it follows
that <I>p</I> is less in shadow than <I>t</I>, because the base of the &#9651; <I>p</I> is
part of the base of the &#9651; <I>t</I>. And <I>c</I> is the terminal point of the
derived shadow and the chief beginning of the highest light.
