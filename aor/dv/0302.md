*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 302.

When the smoke from dry wood is seen between the eye of the spectator
and some dark space \[or object\], it will look blue. Thus the sky looks
blue by reason of the darkness beyond it. And if you look towards the
horizon of the sky, you will see the atmosphere

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

is not blue, and this is caused by its density. And thus at each degree,
as you raise your eyes above the horizon up to the sky over your head,
you will see the atmosphere look darker \[blue\] and this is because a
smaller density of air lies between your eye and the \[outer\] darkness.
And if you go to the top of a high mountain the sky will look
proportionately darker above you as the atmosphere becomes rarer between
you and the \[outer\] darkness; and this will be more visible at each
degree of increasing height till at last we should find darkness.

That smoke will look bluest which rises from the driest wood and which
is nearest to the fire and is seen against the darkest background, and
with the sunlight upon it.
