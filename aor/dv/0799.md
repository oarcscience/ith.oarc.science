### THE ARRANGEMENT OF ANATOMY

First draw the bones, let us say, of the arm, and put in the motor
muscle from the shoulder to the elbow with all its lines. Then proceed
in the same way from the elbow to the wrist. Then from the wrist to the
hand and from the hand to the fingers.

And in the arm you will put the motors of the fingers which open, and
these you will show separately in their demonstration. In the second
demonstration you will clothe these muscles with the secondary motors of
the fingers and so proceed by degrees to avoid confusion. But first lay
on the bones those muscles which lie close to the said bones, without
confusion of other muscles; and with these you may put the nerves and
veins which supply their nourishment, after having first drawn the tree
of veins and nerves over the simple bones.
