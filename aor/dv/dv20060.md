2\. Churches formed on the plan of a Latin cross.

We find among Leonardo's studies several sketches for churches on the
plan of the Latin cross; we shall begin by describing them, and shall
add a few observations.

### A. Studies after existing Monuments.

[Pl. XCIV](pl094.htm#img_pl094) No. 2. (MS. B. 11b..md) Plan of Santo
Spirito at Florence, a basilica built after the designs of
Brunellesco.--Leonardo has added the indication of a portico in front,
either his own invention or the reproduction of a now lost design.

[Pl. XCV](pl095.htm#img_pl095.md) No. 2. Plan accompanied by the words: "A
e santo sepolcro di milano di sopra"(A *is the upper church of S.
Sepolcro at Milan); although since Leonardo's time considerably spoilt,
it is still the same in plan.*

The second plan with its note: "B e la sua parte socto tera" (B *is its
subterranean part \[the crypt\]) still corresponds with the present
state of this part of the church as I have ascertained by visiting the
crypt with this plan. Excepting the addition of a few insignificant
walls, the state of this interesting part of the church still conforms
to Leonardo's sketch; but in the Vestibolo the two columns near the
entrance of the winding stairs are absent.*

### B. Designs or Studies.

PL. XCV No. 1. Plan of a church evidently suggested by that of San
Sepolcro at Milan. The central part has been added to on the principle
of the second type of Group III. Leonardo has placed the "coro" *(choir)
in the centre.*

*[Pl. XCVI](pl096.htm#img_pl096.md) No. 2. In the plan the dome, as regards
its interior, belongs to the First Class of Group IV, and may be grouped
with the one in MS. B. 35a. The nave seems to be a development of the
type represented in [Pl. XCV](pl095.htm#img_pl095.md) No. 2, B. by adding
towers and two lateral porticos* <span id="fr_44"></span>[378](#fn_44.md) .

*On the left is a view of the exterior of the preceding plan. It is
accompanied by the following note:*
