*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 301.

Experience shows us that the air must have darkness beyond it and yet it
appears blue. If you produce a small quantity of smoke from dry wood and
the rays of the sun fall on this smoke, and if you then place behind the
smoke a piece of black velvet on which the sun does not shine, you will
see that all the smoke which is between the eye and the black stuff will
appear of a beautiful blue colour. And if instead of the velvet you
place a white cloth smoke, that is too thick smoke, hinders, and too
thin smoke does not produce, the perfection of this blue colour. Hence a
moderate amount of smoke produces the finest blue. Water violently
ejected in a fine spray and in a dark chamber where the sun beams are
admitted produces these blue rays and the more vividly if it is
distilled water, and thin smoke looks blue. This I mention in order to
show that the blueness of the atmosphere is caused by the darkness
beyond it, and these instances are given for those who cannot confirm my
experience on Monboso.
