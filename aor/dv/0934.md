### OF THE CENTRE OF THE OCEAN.

The centre of the sphere of waters is the true centre of the globe of
our world, which is composed of water and earth, having the shape of a
sphere. But, if you want to find the centre of the element of the earth,
this is placed at a point equidistant from the surface of the ocean, and
not equidistant from the surface of the earth; for it is evident that
this globe of earth has nowhere any perfect rotundity, excepting in
places where the sea is, or marshes or other still waters. And every
part of the earth that rises above the water is farther from the centre.
