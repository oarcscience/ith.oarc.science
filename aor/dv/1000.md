*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1000.

<span class="margnote"> The globe an organism.</span>Nothing originates
in a spot where there is no sentient, vegetable and rational life;
feathers grow upon birds and are changed every year; hairs grow upon
animals and are changed every year, excepting some parts, like the hairs
of the beard in lions, cats and their like. The grass grows in the
fields, and the leaves on the trees, and every year they are, in great
part, renewed. So that we might say that the earth has a spirit of
growth; that its flesh is the soil, its bones the arrangement and
connection of the rocks of which the mountains are composed, its
cartilage the tufa, and its blood the springs of water. The pool of
blood which lies round the heart is the ocean, and its breathing, and
the increase and decrease of the blood in the pulses, is represented in
the earth by the flow and ebb of the sea; and the heat of the spirit of
the world is the fire which pervades the earth, and the seat of the
vegetative soul is in the fires, which in many parts of the earth find
vent in baths and mines of sulphur, and in volcanoes, as at Mount Aetna
in Sicily, and in many other places.
