*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1203.

<span class="margnote"> Politics (1203. 1204).</span>There will be
eternal fame also for the inhabitants of that town, constructed and
enlarged by him.

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

All communities obey and are led by their magnates, and these magnates
ally themselves with the lords and subjugate them in two ways: either by
consanguinity, or by fortune; by consanguinity, when their children are,
as it were, hostages, and a security and pledge of their suspected
fidelity; by property, when you make each of these build a house or two
inside your city which may yield some revenue and he shall have...; 10
towns, five thousand houses with thirty thousand inhabitants, and you
will disperse this great congregation of people which stand like goats
one behind the other, filling every place with fetid smells and sowing
seeds of pestilence and death;

And the city will gain beauty worthy of its name and to you it will be
useful by its revenues, and the eternal fame of its aggrandizement.
