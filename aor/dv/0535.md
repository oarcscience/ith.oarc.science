### 535.

### WHY OF TWO OBJECTS OF EQUAL SIZE A PAINTED ONE WILL LOOK LARGER THAN A SOLID ONE.

The reason of this is not so easy to demonstrate as many others. Still I
will endeavour to accomplish it, if not wholly, at any rate in part. The
perspective of diminution demonstrates by reason, that objects diminish
in proportion as they are farther from the eye, and this reasoning is
confirmed by experience. Hence, the lines of sight that extend between
the object and the eye, when they are directed to the surface of a
painting are all intersected at uniform limits, while those lines which
are directed towards a piece of sculpture are intersected at various
limits and are of various lengths. The lines which are longest extend to
a more remote limb than the others and therefore that limb looks
smaller. As there are numerous lines each longer than the others--since
there are numerous parts, each more remote than the others and these,
being farther off, necessarily appear smaller, and by appearing smaller
it follows that their diminution makes the whole mass of the object look
smaller. But this does not occur in painting; since the lines of sight
all end at

the same distance there can be no diminution, hence the parts not being
diminished the whole object is undiminished, and for this reason
painting does not diminish, as a piece of sculpture does.
