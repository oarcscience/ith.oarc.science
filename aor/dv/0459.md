*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 459.

When the sun is covered by clouds, objects are less conspicuous, because
there is little difference between the light and shade of the trees and
of the buildings being illuminated by the brightness of the atmosphere
which surrounds the objects in such a way that the shadows are few, and
these few fade away so that their outline is lost in haze.
