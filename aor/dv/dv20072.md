### *VI. Studies of architectural details.*

*Several of Leonardo's drawings of architectural details prove that,
like other great masters of that period, he had devoted his attention to
the study of the proportion of such details. As every organic being in
nature has its law of construction and growth, these masters
endeavoured, each in his way, to discover and prove a law of proportion
in architecture. The following notes in Leonardo's manuscripts refer to
this subject.*

*MS. S. K. M. Ill, 47b (see Fig. 1). A diagram, indicating the rules as
given by Vitruvius and by Leon Battista Alberti for the proportions of
the Attic base of a column.*

*MS. S. K. M. Ill 55a (see Fig. 2). Diagram showing the same rules.*
