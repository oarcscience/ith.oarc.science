A body in light and shade placed between two equal lights side by side
will cast shadows in proportion to the \[amount of\] light. And the
shadows will be one darker than the other in proportion as one light is
nearer to the said body than the other on the opposite side.

A body placed at an equal distance between two lights will cast two
shadows, one deeper than the other in proportion, as the light which
causes it is brighter than the other.
