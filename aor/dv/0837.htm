<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> On the origin of the soul.</FONT></span>Though human ingenuity may make various inventions which, by the
help of various machines answering the same end, it will never
devise any inventions more beautiful, nor more simple, nor more to
the purpose than Nature does; because in her inventions nothing is
wanting, and nothing is superfluous, and she needs no counterpoise
when she makes limbs proper for motion in the bodies of animals. But
she puts into them the soul of the body, which forms them that is

child is attached to the mother. And these are the reason why a
wish, a strong craving or a fright or any other mental suffering in
the mother, has more influence on the child than on the mother; for
there are many cases when the child loses its life from them, &amp;c

definition of the soul I leave to the imaginations of friars, those
fathers of the people who know all secrets by inspiration.
