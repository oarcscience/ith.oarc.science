*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 369.

A sitting man cannot raise himself if that part of his body which is
front of his axis \[centre of gravity\] does not weigh more than that
which is behind that axis \[or centre\] without using his arms.

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

A man who is mounting any slope finds that he must involuntarily throw
the most weight forward, on the higher foot, rather than behind--that is
in front of the axis and not behind it. Hence a man will always,
involuntarily, throw the greater weight towards the point whither he
desires to move than in any other direction.

The faster a man runs, the more he leans forward towards the point he
runs to and throws more weight in front of his axis than behind. A man
who runs down hill throws the axis onto his heels, and one who runs up
hill throws it into the points of his feet; and a man running on level
ground throws it first on his heels and then on the points of his feet.

This man cannot carry his own weight unless, by drawing his body back he
balances the weight in front, in such a way as that the foot on which he
stands is the centre of gravity.
