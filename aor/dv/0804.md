*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 804.

Remember that to be certain of the point of origin of any muscle, you
must pull the sinew from which the muscle springs in such a way as to
see that muscle move, and where it is attached to the ligaments of the
bones.

### NOTE.

You will never get any thing but confusion in demonstrating the muscles
and their positions, origin, and termination, unless you first make a
demonstration of thin muscles after the manner of linen threads; and
thus you can represent them, one over another as nature has placed them;
and thus, too, you can name them according to the limb they serve; for
instance the motor of the point of the great toe, of its middle bone, of
its first bone, &c And when you have the knowledge you will draw, by the
side of this, the true form and size and position of each muscle. But
remember to give the threads which explain the situation of the muscles
in the position which corresponds to the central line of each muscle;
and so these threads will demonstrate the form of the leg and their
distance in a plain and clear manner.

I have removed the skin from a man who was so shrunk by illness that the
muscles were worn down and remained in a state like thin membrane, in
such a way that the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide
membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very
little over their natural size.
