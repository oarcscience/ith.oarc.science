### Footnotes

<span id="fn_6"></span>[13:4](0007.htm#fr_6.md) : 4. The numerous notes on
anatomy written on loose leaves and now in the Royal collection at
Windsor can best be classified in four Books, corresponding to the
different character and size of the paper. When Leonardo speaks of '*li
tua libri di notomia*', he probably means the MSS. which still exist; if
this hypothesis is correct the present condition of these leaves might
seem to prove that he only carried out his purpose with one of the Books
on anatomy. A borrowed book on Anatomy is mentioned in F.O.
