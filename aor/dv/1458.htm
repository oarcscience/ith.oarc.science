Magdalen's[1] day, 1490, aged 10 years. The
second day I had two shirts cut out for him,
a pair of hose, and a jerkin, and when I put
aside some money to pay for these things
he stole 4 <I>lire</I>
the money out of the purse; and I could never
make him confess, though I was quite certain
of the fact.--Thief, liar, obstinate, glutton.
<P>
The day after, I went to sup with Giacomo
Andrea, and the said Giacomo supped
for two and did mischief for four; for he
brake 3 cruets, spilled the wine, and after
this came to sup where I....
<P>
Item: on the 7th day of September he
stole a silver point of the value of 22 soldi
from Marco &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">787</FONT></A>
 who was living with me, 4 <I>lire</I>
this being of silver; and he took it from his
studio, and when the said Marco had searched
for it a long while he found it hidden
in the said Giacomo's box 4 <I>lire</I>.

<P>Item: on the 26th January following,
I, being in the house of Messer Galeazzo
da San Severino &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_483"></A><A HREF="#fn_483"><FONT SIZE="1">789</FONT></A>
, was arranging the festival for his jousting,
and certain footmen having undressed to try on some costumes of wild men for the said festival, Giacomo
went to the purse of one of them which lay
on the bed with other clothes, 2 <I>lire</I> 4 S,
and took out such money as was in it.
<P>
Item: when I was in the same house,
Maestro Agostino da Pavia gave to me a
Turkish hide to have 2 <I>lire</I>.
a pair of short boots made of it; this
Giacomo stole it of me within a month and
sold it to a cobbler for 20 soldi, with
which money, by his own confession, he
bought anise comfits.
<P>
Item: again, on the 2nd April, Giovan
Antonio &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_484"></A><A HREF="#fn_484"><FONT SIZE="1">790</FONT></A>
 having left a silver point on a
drawing of his, Giacomo stole it, and this
was of the value of 24 soldi 1 <I>lira</I> 4 S.

1470 is supposed to be the date of his

<I>Che stava con meco.</I> We may infer from this that
he left the master shortly after this, his term of
study having perhaps expired.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_485"></A><A HREF="1458.htm#fr_485">439:791</A> : Leonardo here gives a detailed account not only of the loss he and others incurred through Giacomo
but of the wild tricks of the youth, and we may
therefore assume that the note was not made merely
as a record for his own use, but as a report to be
forwarded to the lad's father or other responsible
guardian.</P>
