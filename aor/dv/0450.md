### OF THE SPACES \[SHOWING THE SKY\] IN TREES THEMSELVES.

<span class="margnote"> The appearance of trees in the distance (450.
451).</span>The spaces between the parts in the mass of trees, and the
spaces between the trees in the air, are, at great distances, invisible
to the eye; for, where it is an effort \[even\] to see the whole it is
most difficult to discern the parts.--But a confused mixture is the
result, partaking chiefly of the \[hue\] which predominates. The spaces
between the leaves consist of particles of illuminated air which are
very much smaller than the tree and are lost sight of sooner than the
tree; but it does not therefore follow that they are not there. Hence,
necessarily, a compounded \[effect\] is produced of the sky and of the
shadows of the tree in shade, which both together strike the eye which
sees them.

### OF TREES WHICH CONCEAL THESE SPACES IN ONE ANOTHER.

<span id="img_v122600"></span> ![](img/v122600.jpg)

That part of a tree will show the fewest spaces, behind which a large
number of trees are standing between the tree and the air \[sky\]; thus
in the tree *a* the spaces are not concealed nor in *b*, as there is no
tree behind. But in *c* only half shows the spaces filled up by the tree
*d*, and part of the tree *d* is filled up by the tree *e* and a little
farther on all the spaces in the mass of the trees are lost, and only
that at the side remains.
