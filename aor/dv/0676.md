*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 676.

Pleasure and Pain represent as twins, since there never is one without
the other; and as if they were united back to back, since they are
contrary to each other.

\[6\] Clay, gold.

If you take Pleasure know that he has behind him one who will deal you
Tribulation and Repentance.

\[9\] This represents Pleasure together with Pain, and show them as
twins because one is never apart from the other. They are back to back
because they are opposed to each other; and they exist as contraries in

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

the same body, because they have the same basis, inasmuch as the origin
of pleasure is labour and pain, and the various forms of evil pleasure
are the origin of pain. Therefore it is here represented with a reed in
his right hand which is useless and without strength, and the wounds it
inflicts are poisoned. In Tuscany they are put to support beds, to
signify that it is here that vain dreams come, and here a great part of
life is consumed. It is here that much precious time is wasted, that is,
in the morning, when the mind is composed and rested, and the body is
made fit to begin new labours; there again many vain pleasures are
enjoyed; both by the mind in imagining impossible things, and by the
body in taking those pleasures that are often the cause of the failing
of life. And for these reasons the reed is held as their support.

Evil-thinking is either Envy or Ingratitude.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_312"></span>[352:310](0676.htm#fr_312) : 7. *oro. fango*:
gold, clay. These words stand below the allegorical figure.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[353:311](0676.htm#fr_313) : 676. The pen and
ink drawing on [Pl. LIX](pl059.htm#img_pl059) belongs to this passage.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[353:312](0676.htm#fr_314) : 8. *tribolatione*.
In the drawing caltrops may be seen lying in the old man's right hand,
others are falling and others again are shewn on the ground. Similar
caltrops are drawn in MS. Tri. p. 98 and underneath them, as well as on
page 96 the words *triboli di ferro* are written. From the accompanying
text it appears that they were intended to be scattered on the ground at
the bottom of ditches to hinder the advance of the enemy. Count Giulio
Porro who published a short account of the Trivulzio MS. in the
"*Archivio Storico Lombardo*", Anno VIII part IV (Dec. 31, 1881) has
this note on the passages treating of "*triboli*": "*E qui aggiungerò
che anni sono quando venne fabbricata la nuova cavallerizza presso il
castello di Milano, ne furono trovati due che io ho veduto ed erano
precisamente quali si trovano descritti e disegnati da Leonardo in
questo codice*".

There can therefore be no doubt that this means of defence was in
general use, whether it were originally Leonardo's invention or not. The
play on the word "*tribolatione*", as it occurs in the drawing at
Oxford, must then have been quite intelligible.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[353:313](0676.htm#fr_315) : 9--22. These
lines, in the original, are written on the left side of the page and
refer to the figure shown on [Pl. LXI](pl061.htm#img_pl061). Next to it
is placed the group of three figures given in [Pl.
LX](pl060.htm#img_pl060) No. I. Lines 21 and 22, which are written under
it, are the only explanation given.
