### Footnotes

<span id="fn_470"></span>[436:776](1453.htm#fr_470) : In July 1506 Pope
Julius II gave Donna Lucrezia della Rovere, the daughter of his sister
Lucchina, in marriage to the youthful Marcantonio Colonna, who, like his
brothers Prospero and Fabrizio, became one of the most famous Captains
of his family. He gave to him Frascati and made him a present of the
palazzo he had built, when Cardinal, near the church of Santi Apostoli
which is now known as the Palazzo Colonna (see GREGOROVIUS, *Gesch. der
Stadt Rom.* Vol. VIII, book XIV I, 3. And COPPI, *Mem. Colonnesi* p.
251).
