*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 722.

Believe me, Leonardo the Florentine, who has to do the equestrian bronze
statue of the Duke Francesco that he does not need to care about it,
because he has work for all his life time, and, being so great a work, I
doubt whether he can ever finish it.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_9"></span>[15:343](0722.htm#fr_9) : This passage is quoted
from a letter to a committee at Piacenza for whom Leonardo seems to have
undertaken to execute some work. The letter is given entire in section
XXL; in it Leonardo remonstrates as to some unreasonable demands.
