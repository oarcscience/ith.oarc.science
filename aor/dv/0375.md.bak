### 375.

<span class="margnote"> Of walking up and down (375-379)</span>When a
man wants to stop running and check the impetus he is forced to hang
back and take short quick steps.  <span
id="fr_184"></span>[182](#fn_184.md) The centre of gravity of a man who
lifts one of his feet from the ground always rests on the centre of the
sole of the foot \[he stands on\].

A man, in going up stairs involuntarily throws so much weight forward
and on the side of the upper foot as to be a counterpoise to the lower
leg, so that the labour of this lower leg is limited to moving itself.

The first thing a man does in mounting steps is to relieve the leg he is
about to lift of the weight of the body which was resting on that leg;
and besides this, he gives to

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

the opposite leg all the rest of the bulk of the whole man, including
\[the weight of\] the other leg; he then raises the other leg and sets
the foot upon the step to which he wishes to raise himself. Having done
this he restores to the upper foot all the weight of the body and of the
leg itself, and places his hand on his thigh and throws his head forward
and repeats the movement towards the point of the upper foot, quickly
lifting the heel of the lower one; and with this impetus he lifts
himself up and at the same time extends the arm which rested on his
knee; and this extension of the arm carries up the body and the head,
and so straightens the spine which was curved.

\[32\] The higher the step is which a man has to mount, the farther
forward will he place his head in advance of his upper foot, so as to
weigh more on *a* than on *b*; this man will not be on the step *m*. As
is shown by the line *g f*.
