*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 491.

### WHAT RULES SHOULD BE GIVEN TO BOYS LEARNING TO PAINT.

<span class="margnote"> Industry and thoroughness the first conditions
(491-493.)</span>We know for certain that sight is one of the most rapid
actions we can perform. In an instant we see an infinite number of
forms, still we only take in thoroughly one object at a time. Supposing
that you, Reader, were to glance rapidly at the whole of this written
page, you would instantly perceive that it was covered with various
letters; but you could not, in the time, recognise what the letters
were, nor what they were meant to tell. Hence you would need to see them
word by word, line by line to be able to understand the letters. Again,
if you wish to go to the top of a building you must go up step by step;
otherwise it will be

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

impossible that you should reach the top. Thus I say to you, whom nature
prompts to pursue this art, if you wish to have a sound knowledge of the
forms of objects begin with the details of them, and do not go on to the
second \[step\] till you have the first well fixed in memory and in
practice. And if you do otherwise you will throw away your time, or
certainly greatly prolong your studies. And remember to acquire
diligence rather than rapidity.
