All bodies together, and each by itself, give off to the surrounding air
an infinite number of images which are all-pervading and each complete,
each conveying the nature, colour and form of the body which produces
it.

It can clearly be shown that all bodies are, by their images,
all-pervading in the surrounding atmosphere, and each complete in itself
as to substance form and colour; this is seen by the images of the
various bodies which are reproduced in one single perforation through
which they transmit the objects by lines which intersect and cause
reversed pyramids, from the objects, so that they are upside down on the
dark plane where they are first reflected. The reason of this is--

<span id="fn_35"></span>[38:33](0061.htm#fr_35.md) : The diagram intended
to illustrate the statement ([Pl. II](pl002.htm#img_pl002) No. i.md) occurs
in the original between lines 3 and 4. The three circles must be
understood to represent three luminous bodies which transmit their
images through perforations in a wall into a dark chamber, according to
a law which is more fully explained in 75--81. So far as concerns the
present passage the diagram is only intended to explain that the images
of the three bodies may be made to coalesce at any given spot. In the
circles are written, giallo--yellow, biàcho--white, rosso--red.

The text breaks off at line 8. The paragraph No.40 follows here in the
original MS.
