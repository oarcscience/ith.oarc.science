*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 122.

### OF THE NATURE OF SHADOW.

Shadow partakes of the nature of universal matter. All such matters are
more powerful in their beginning and grow weaker towards the end, I say
at the beginning, whatever their form or condition may be and whether
visible or invisible. And it is not from small beginnings that they grow
to a great size in time; as it might be a great oak which has a feeble
beginning from a small acorn. Yet I may say that the oak is most
powerful at its beginning, that is where it springs from the earth,
which is where it is largest (To return:) Darkness, then, is the
strongest degree of shadow and light is its least. Therefore, O Painter,
make your shadow darkest close to the object that casts it, and make the
end of it fading into light, seeming to have no end.
