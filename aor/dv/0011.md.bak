*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 11.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

Though I may not, like them, be able to quote other authors, I shall
rely on that which is much greater and more worthy:--on experience, the
mistress of their Masters. They go about puffed up and pompous, dressed
and decorated with \[the fruits\], not of their own labours, but of
those of others. And they will not allow me my own. They will scorn me
as an inventor; but how much more might they--who are not inventors but
vaunters and declaimers of the works of others--be blamed.

### INTRODUCTION.

And those men who are inventors and interpreters between Nature and Man,
as compared with boasters and declaimers of the works of others, must be
regarded and not otherwise esteemed than as the object in front of a
mirror, when compared with its image seen in the mirror. For the first
is something in itself, and the other nothingness.--Folks little
indebted to Nature, since it is only by chance that they wear the human
form and without it I might class them with the herds of beasts.
