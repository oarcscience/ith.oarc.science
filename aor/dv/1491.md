*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1491.

Hippocrates says that the origin of men's sperm derives from the brain,
and from the lungs and testicles of our parents, where the final
decocture is made, and all the other limbs transmit their substance to
this sperm by means of expiration, because there are no channels through
which they might come to the sperm.  <span
