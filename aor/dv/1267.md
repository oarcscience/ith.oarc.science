### A FABLE.

A dog, lying asleep on the fur of a sheep, one of his fleas, perceiving
the odour of the greasy wool, judged that this must be a land of better
living, and also more secure from the teeth and nails of the dog than
where he fed on the dog; and without farther reflection he left the dog
and went into the thick wool. There he began with great labour to try to
pass among the roots of the hairs; but after much sweating had to give
up the task as vain, because these hairs were so close that they almost
touched each other, and there was no space where fleas could taste the
skin. Hence, after much labour and fatigue, he began to wish to return
to his dog, who however had already departed; so he was constrained
after long repentance and bitter tears, to die of hunger.
