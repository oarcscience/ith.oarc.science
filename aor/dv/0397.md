*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 397.

There is no boss on branches which has not been produced by some branch
which has failed.

The lower shoots on the branches of trees grow more than the upper ones
and this occurs only because the sap that nourishes them, being heavy,
tends downwards more than upwards; and again, because those \[branches\]
which grow downwards turn away from the shade which exists towards the
centre of the plant. The older the branches are, the greater is the
difference between their upper and their lower shoots and in those
dating from the same year or epoch.
