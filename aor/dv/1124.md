### TO ESCAPE THE PERIL OF DESTRUCTION.

Destruction to such a machine may occur in two ways; of which the first
is the breaking of the machine. The second would be when the machine
should turn on its edge or nearly on its edge, because it ought always
to descend in a highly oblique direction, and almost exactly balanced on
its centre. As regards the first--the breaking of the machine--, that
may be prevented by making it as strong as possible; and in whichever
direction it may tend to turn over, one centre must be very far from the
other; that is, in a machine 30 braccia long the centres must be 4
braccia one from the other.
