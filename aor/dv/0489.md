*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 489.

### HOW IT IS NECESSARY TO A PAINTER THAT HE SHOULD KNOW THE INTRINSIC FORMS \[STRUCTURE\] OF MAN.

The painter who is familiar with the nature of the sinews, muscles, and
tendons, will know very well, in giving movement to a limb, how many and
which sinews cause it; and which muscle, by swelling, causes the
contraction of that sinew; and which sinews, expanded into the thinnest
cartilage, surround and support the said muscle. Thus he will variously
and constantly demonstrate the different muscles by means of the various
attitudes of his figures, and will not do, as many who, in a variety of
movements, still display the very same things \[modelling\] in the arms,
back, breast and legs. And these things are not to be regarded as minor
faults.
