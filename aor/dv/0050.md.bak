<span class="margnote"> Definition of Perspective.</span>\[Drawing is
based upon perspective, which is nothing else than a thorough knowledge
of the function of the eye. And this function simply

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

consists in receiving in a pyramid the forms and colours of all the
objects placed before it. I say in a pyramid, because there is no object
so small that it will not be larger than the spot where these pyramids
are received into the eye. Therefore, if you extend the lines from the
edges of each body as they converge you will bring them to a single
point, and necessarily the said lines must form a pyramid.\]

\[Perspective is nothing more than a rational demonstration applied to
the consideration of how objects in front of the eye transmit their
image to it, by means of a pyramid of lines. The *Pyramid* is the name I
apply to the lines which, starting from the surface and edges of each
object, converge from a distance and meet in a single point.\]

\[Perspective is a rational demonstration, by which we may practically
and clearly understand how objects transmit their own image, by lines
forming a Pyramid (centred) in the eye.\]

Perspective is a rational demonstration by which experience confirms
that every object sends its image to the eye by a pyramid of lines; and
bodies of equal size will result in a pyramid of larger or smaller size,
according to the difference in their distance, one from the other. By a
pyramid of lines I mean those which start from the surface and edges of
bodies, and, converging from a distance meet in a single point. A point
is said to be that which \[having no dimensions\] cannot be divided, and
this point placed in the eye receives all the points of the cone.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_29"></span>[30:27](0050.htm#fr_29.md) : 50. 1-5. Compare with
this the Proem. No. 21. The paragraphs placed in brackets: lines 1-9,
10-14, and 17--20, are evidently mere sketches and, as such, were
cancelled by the writer; but they serve as a commentary on the final
paragraph, lines 22-29.
