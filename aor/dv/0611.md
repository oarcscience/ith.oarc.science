*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 611.

People were to be seen eagerly embarking victuals on various kinds of
hastily made barks. But little of the waves were visible in those places
where the dark clouds and rain were reflected.

But where the flashes caused by the bolts of heaven were reflected,
there were seen as many bright spots, caused by the image of the
flashes, as there were waves to reflect them to the eye of the
spectator.

The number of the images produced by the flash of lightning on the waves
of the water were multiplied in proportion to the distance of the
spectator's eye.

were nearer the eye which saw them  <span

definition of the luminosity of the moon, and of our marine horizon when
the sun's rays are reflected in it and the eye which receives the
reflection is remote from the sea.
