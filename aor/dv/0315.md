### 315.

From the eyebrow to the junction of the lip with the chin, and the angle
of the jaw and the upper angle where the ear joins the temple will be a
perfect square. And each side by itself is half the head.

The hollow of the cheek bone occurs half way between the tip of the nose
and the top of the jaw bone, which is the lower angle of the setting on
of the ear, in the frame here represented.

From the angle of the eye-socket to the ear is as far as the length of
the ear, or the third of the face.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_138"></span>[172:136](0315.htm#fr_138.md) : See [Pl.
IX](pl009.htm#img_pl009.md). The text, in the original is written behind
the head. The handwriting would seem to indicate a date earlier than
1480. On the same leaf there is a drawing in red chalk of two horsemen
of which only a portion of the upper figure is here visible. The whole
leaf measures 22 1/2 centimetres wide by 29 long, and is numbered 127 in
the top right-hand corner.
