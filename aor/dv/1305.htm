(Of Crucifixes which are sold.)
<P>
I see Christ sold and crucified afresh, and his Saints suffering
Martyrdom.
<P>
(Of Physicians, who live by sickness.)
<P>

others will derive profit from their sufferings or from the loss of
their real wealth, that is health.

(Of the Religion of Friars, who live by the Saints who have been
dead a great while.)
<P>
Those who are dead will, after a thousand years be those who will
give a livelihood to many who are living.
<P>
(Of Stones converted into Lime, with which prison walls are made.)
<P>
Many things that have been before that time destroyed by fire will
deprive many men of liberty.
