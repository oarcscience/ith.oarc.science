*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 25.

### OF THE EYE.

<span class="margnote"> Focus of sight.</span>If the eye is required to
look at an object placed too near to it, it cannot judge of it well--as
happens to a man who tries to see the tip of his nose. Hence, as a
general rule, Nature teaches us that an object can never be seen
perfectly unless the space between it and the eye is equal, at least, to
the length of the face.
