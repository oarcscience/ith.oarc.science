*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 593.

<span class="margnote"> Of appropriate gestures (593-600).</span>A
picture or representation of human figures, ought to be done in such a
way as that the spectator may easily recognise, by means of their
attitudes, the purpose in their minds. Thus, if you have to represent a
man of noble character in the act of speaking, let his gestures be such
as naturally accompany good words; and, in the same way, if you wish to
depict a man of a brutal nature, give him fierce movements; as with his
arms flung out towards the listener, and his head and breast thrust
forward beyond his feet, as if following the speaker's hands. Thus it is
with a deaf and dumb person who, when he sees two men in
conversation--although he is deprived of hearing--can nevertheless
understand, from the attitudes and gestures of the speakers, the nature
of their discussion. I once saw in Florence a man who had become deaf
who, when you spoke very loud did not understand you, but if you spoke
gently and without making any sound, understood merely from the movement
of the lips. Now perhaps you will say that the lips of a man who speaks
loudly do not move like those of one speaking softly, and that if they
were to move them alike they would be alike understood. As to this
argument, I leave the decision to experiment; make a man speak to you
gently and note \[the motion of\] his lips.
