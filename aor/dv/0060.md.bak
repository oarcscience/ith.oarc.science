*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 60.

That the atmosphere attracts to itself, like a loadstone, all the images
of the objects that exist in it, and not their forms merely but their
nature may be clearly seen by the sun, which is a hot and luminous body.
All the atmosphere, which is the all-pervading matter, absorbs light and
heat, and reflects in itself the image of the source of that heat and
splendour and, in each minutest portion, does the same. The Northpole
does the same as the loadstone shows; and the moon and the other
planets, without suffering any diminution, do the same. Among
terrestrial things musk does the same and other perfumes.
