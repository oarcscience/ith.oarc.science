*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 441.

<span class="margnote"> The distribution of light and shade with
reference to the position of the spectator (441-443).</span>The shadows
of trees placed in a landscape do not display themselves in the same
position in the trees on the right hand and those on the left; still
more so if the sun is to the right or left. As is proved by the 4th
which says: Opaque bodies placed between the light and the eye display
themselves entirely in shadow; and by the 5th: The eye when placed
between the opaque body and the light sees the opaque body entirely
illuminated. And by the 6th: When the eye and the opaque body are placed
between darkness and light, it will be seen half in shadow and half in
light.
