*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 275.

### ANY SHADOW CAST BY AN OPAQUE BODY SMALLER THAN THE LIGHT CAUSING THE SHADOW WILL THROW A DERIVED SHADOW WHICH IS TINGED BY THE COLOUR OF THE LIGHT.

<span class="margnote"> On the colours of derived shadows (275.
276).</span>Let *n* be the source of the shadow *e f*; it will assume
its hue. Let *o* be the source of *h e* which will in the same way be
tinged by its hue and so also the colour of *v h* will be affected by
*p* which causes it; and the shadow of the triangle *z k y* will be
affected by the colour of *q*, because it is produced by it. \[7\] In
proportion as *c d* goes into *a d*, will *n r s* be darker than *m*;
and the rest of the space will be shadowless \[11\]. *f g* is the
highest light, because here the whole light of the window *a d* falls;
and thus on the opaque body *m e* is in equally high light; *z k y* is a
triangle which includes the

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

deepest shadow, because the light *a d* cannot reach any part of it. *x
h* is the 2nd grade of shadow, because it receives only 1/3 of the light
from the window, that is *c d*. The third grade of shadow is *h e*,
where two thirds of the light from the window is visible. The last grade
of shadow is *b d e f*, because the highest grade of light from the
window falls at *f*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_123"></span>[148:121](0275.htm#fr_123) : The diagram [Pl.
III](pl003.htm#img_pl003), No. 1 belongs to this chapter as well as the
text given in No. 148. Lines 7-11 (compare lines 8-12 of No. 148) which
are written within the diagram, evidently apply to both sections and
have therefore been inserted in both.
