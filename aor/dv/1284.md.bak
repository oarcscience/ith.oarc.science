*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1284.

Franciscan begging Friars are wont, at certain times, to keep fasts,
when they do not eat meat in their convents. But on journeys, as they
live on charity, they have license to eat whatever is set before them.
Now a couple of these friars on their travels, stopped at an inn, in
company with a certain merchant, and sat down with him at the same
table, where, from the poverty of the inn, nothing was served to them
but a small roast chicken. The merchant, seeing this to be but little
even for himself, turned to the friars and said: "If my memory serves
me, you do not eat any kind of flesh in your convents at this season."
At these words the friars were compelled by their rule to admit, without
cavil, that this was the truth; so the merchant had his wish, and eat
the chicken and the friars did the best they could. After dinner the
messmates departed, all three together, and after travelling some
distance they came to a river of some width and depth. All three being
on foot--the friars by reason of their poverty, and the other from
avarice--it was necessary by the custom of company that one of the
friars, being barefoot, should carry the merchant on his shoulders: so
having given his wooden shoes into his keeping, he took up his man. But
it so happened that when the friar had got to the middle of the river,
he again remembered a rule of his order, and stopping short, he looked
up, like Saint Christopher, to the burden on his back and said: "Tell
me, have you any money about you?"--"You know I have", answered the
other, "How do you suppose that a Merchant like me should go about
otherwise?" "Alack!" cried the friar, "our rules forbid as to carry any
money on our persons," and forthwith he dropped him into the water,
which the merchant perceived was a facetious way of being revenged on
the indignity he had done them; so, with a smiling face, and blushing
somewhat with shame, he peaceably endured the revenge.
