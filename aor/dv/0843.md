*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 843.

### HOW THE BODY OF ANIMALS IS CONSTANTLY DYING AND BEING RENEWED.

<span class="margnote"> The laws of nutrition and the support of life
(843-848).</span>The body of any thing whatever that takes nourishment
constantly dies and is constantly renewed; because nourishment

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

can only enter into places where the former nourishment has expired, and
if it has expired it no longer has life. And if you do not supply
nourishment equal to the nourishment which is gone, life will fail in
vigour, and if you take away this nourishment, the life is entirely
destroyed. But if you restore as much is destroyed day by day, then as
much of the life is renewed as is consumed, just as the flame of the
candle is fed by the nourishment afforded by the liquid of this candle,
which flame continually with a rapid supply restores to it from below as
much as is consumed in dying above: and from a brilliant light is
converted in dying into murky smoke; and this death is continuous, as
the smoke is continuous; and the continuance of the smoke is equal to
the continuance of the nourishment, and in the same instant all the
flame is dead and all regenerated, simultaneously with the movement of
its own nourishment.
