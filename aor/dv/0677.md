*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 677.

Envy must be represented with a contemptuous motion of the hand towards
heaven, because if she could she would use her strength against God;
make her with her face covered by a mask of fair seeming; show her as
wounded in the eye by a palm branch and by an olive-branch, and wounded
in the ear by laurel and myrtle, to signify that victory and truth are
odious to her. Many thunderbolts should proceed from her to signify her
evil speaking. Let her be lean and haggard because she is in perpetual
torment. Make her heart gnawed by a swelling serpent, and make her with
a quiver with tongues serving as arrows, because she often offends with
it. Give her a leopard's skin, because this creature kills the lion out
of envy and by deceit. Give her too a vase in her hand full of flowers
and scorpions and toads and other venomous creatures; make her ride upon
death, because Envy, never dying, never tires of ruling. Make her
bridle, and load her with divers kinds

of arms because all her weapons are deadly.

Toleration.

Intolerable.

No sooner is Virtue born than Envy comes into the world to attack it;
and sooner will there be a body without a shadow than Virtue without
Envy.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_316"></span>[354:314](0677.htm#fr_316) : The larger of the
two drawings on [Pl. LXI](pl061.htm#img_pl061) is explained by the first
21 lines of this passage. L. 22 and 23, which are written above the
space between the two drawings, do not seem to have any reference to
either. L. 24-27 are below the allegorical twin figure which they serve
to explain.
