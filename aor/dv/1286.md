*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1286.

A man saw a large sword which another one wore at his side. Said he
"Poor fellow, for a long time I have seen you tied to that weapon; why
do you not release yourself as your hands are untied, and set yourself
free?" To which the other replied: "This is none of yours, on the
contrary it is an old story." The former speaker, feeling stung,
replied: "I know that you are acquainted with so few things in this
world, that I thought anything I could tell you would be new to you."
