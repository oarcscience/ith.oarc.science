### HOW YOU SHOULD SET TO WORK TO DRAW A HEAD OF WHICH ALL THE PARTS SHALL AGREE WITH THE POSITION GIVEN TO IT.

To draw a head in which the features shall agree with the turn and bend
of the head, pursue this method. You know that the eyes, eyebrows,
nostrils, corners of the mouth, and sides of the chin, the jaws, cheeks,
ears and all the parts of a face are squarely and straightly set upon
the face.

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Therefore when you
have sketched the face draw lines passing from one corner of the eye to
the other; and so for the placing of each feature; and after having
drawn the ends of the lines beyond the two sides of the face, look if
the spaces inside the same parallel lines on the right and on the left
are equal \[12\]. But be sure to remember to make these lines tend to
the point of sight.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_267"></span>[288:265](0573.htm#fr_267.md) : Compare the
drawings and the text belonging to them on [Pl.
IX](pl009.htm#img_pl009). (No. 315), [Pl. X](pl010.htm#img_pl010.md) (No.
316), [Pl. XL](pl040.htm#img_pl040) (No. 318.md) and [Pl.
XII](pl012.htm#img_pl012). (No. 319.md).

<span id="fn_268"></span>[289:266](0573.htm#fr_268.md) : See [Pl.
XXXI](pl031.htm#img_pl031.md), No. 4, the slight sketch on the left hand
side. The text of this passage is written by the side of it. In this
sketch the lines seem intentionally incorrect and converging to the
right (compare I. 12) instead of parallel. Compare too with this text
the drawing in red chalk from Windsor Castle which is reproduced on [Pl.
XL](pl040.htm#img_pl040.md), No. 2.
