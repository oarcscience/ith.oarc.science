*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1476.

If any man could have discovered the utmost powers of the cannon, in all
its various forms and have given such a secret to the Romans, with what
rapidity would they have conquered every country and have vanquished
every army, and what reward could have been great enough for such a
service! Archimedes indeed, although he had greatly damaged the Romans
in the siege of Syra- cuse, nevertheless did not fail of being offered
great rewards from these very Romans; and when Syracuse was taken,
diligent search was made for Archimedes; and he being found dead greater
lamentation was made for him by the Senate and people of Rome than if
they had lost all their army; and they did not fail to honour him with
burial and with a statue. At their head was Marcus Marcellus. And after
the second destruction of Syracuse, the sepulchre of Archimedes was
found again by Cato\[25\], in the ruins of a temple. So Cato had the
temple restored and the sepulchre he so highly honoured.... Whence it is
written that Cato said that he was not so proud of any thing he had done
as of having paid such honour to Archimedes.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_519"></span>[446:819](1476.htm#fr_519.md) : 1476. Where
Leonardo found the statement that Cato had found and restored the tomb
of Archi- medes, I do not know. It is a merit that Cicero claims as his
own (Tusc. V, 23) and certainly with a full right to it. None of
Archimedes' biographers -not even the diligent Mazzucchelli, mentions
any version in which Cato is named. It is evidently a slip of the memory
on Leonardo's part. Besides, according to the passage in Cicero, the
grave was not found 'nelle mine ffun tempio'-which is highly improbable
as relating to a Greek-but in an open spot (H. MULLER-STROBING).--See
too, as to Archi- medes, No. 1417.

Leonardo says somewhere in MS. C.A.: Architronito e una macchina di fino
rame, invenzlon d' Archimede (see 'Saggiol, p. 20).
