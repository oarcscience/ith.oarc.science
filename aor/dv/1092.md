### 1092.

The surface of the Red Sea is on a level with the ocean.

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

A mountain may have fallen and closed the mouth of the Red Sea and
prevented the outlet of the Mediterranean, and the Mediterranean Sea
thus overfilled had for outlet the passage below the mountains of Gades;
for, in our own times a similar thing has been seen  <span
id="fr_272"></span>[606](#fn_272) ; a mountain fell seven miles across a
valley and closed it up and made a lake. And thus most lakes have been
made by mountains, as the lake of Garda, the lakes of Como and Lugano,
and the Lago Maggiore. The Mediterranean fell but little on the confines
of Syria, in consequence of the Gaditanean passage, but a great deal in
this passage, because before this cutting was made the Mediterranean sea
flowed to the South East, and then the fall had to be made by its run
through the Straits of Gades.

At *a* the water of the Mediterranean fell into the ocean.

All the plains which lie between the sea and mountains were formerly
covered with salt water.

Every valley has been made by its own river; and the proportion between
valleys is the same as that between river and river.

The greatest river in our world is the Mediterranean river, which moves
from the sources of the Nile to the Western ocean.

And its greatest height is in Outer Mauritania and it has a course of
ten thousand miles before it reunites with its ocean, the father of the
waters.

That is 3000 miles for the Mediterranean, 3000 for the Nile, as far as
discovered and 3000 for the Nile which flows to the East, &c

1336, ll. 30, 35 and 36.-- Paolo Giovio, the celebrated historian (born
at Como in 1483) reports that in 1513 at the foot of the Alps, above
Bellinzona, on the road to Switzerland, a mountain fell with a very
great noise, in consequence of an earthquake, and that the mass of
rocks, which fell on the left (Western) side blocked the river Breno (T.
I p. 218 and 345 of D. Sauvage's French edition, quoted in ALEXIS PERCY,
*Memoire des tremblements de terre de la peninsule italique; Academie
Royale de Belgique.* T. XXII).--

CXI](pl111.htm#img_pl111) 2, a sketch of the shores of the Mediterranean
Sea, where lines 11 to 16 may be seen. The large figures 158 are not in
Leonardo's writing. The character of the writing leads us to conclude
that this text was written later than the foregoing. A slight sketch of
the Mediterranean is also to be found in MS. I', 47a.
