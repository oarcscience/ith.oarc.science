### Footnotes

<span id="fn_543"></span>[456:843](1519.htm#fr_543.md) : This note, of
about the year 1494, is the earliest mention of Salai, and the last is
of the year 1513 (see No. 1465, 3). From the various notes in the MSS.
he seems to have been Leonardo's assistant and keeper only, and scarcely
himself a painter. At any rate no signed or otherwise authenticated
picture by him is known to exist. Vasari speaks somewhat doubtfully on
this point.
