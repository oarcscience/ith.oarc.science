*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1057.

<span class="margnote"> The Alps (1057-1062).</span>At Monbracco, above
Saluzzo,--a mile above the Certosa, at the foot of Monte Viso, there is
a quarry of flakey stone, which is as white as Carrara marble, without a
spot, and as hard as porphyry or even harder; of which my worthy gossip,
Master Benedetto the sculptor, has promised to give me a small slab, for
the colours, the second day of January 1511.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[245:575](1057.htm#fr_241) : Saluzzo at the
foot of the Alps South of Turin.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[245:576](1057.htm#fr_242) 9. 10.: *Maestro
Benedetto scultore*; probably some native of Northern Italy acquainted
with the place here described. Hardly the Florentine sculptor Benedetto
da Majano. Amoretti had published this passage, and M. Ravaisson who
gave a French translation of it in the *Gazette des Beaux Arts* (1881,
pag. 528), remarks as follows: *Le maitre sculpteur que Leonard appelle
son "compare" ne serait-il pas Benedetto da Majano, un de ceux qui
jugerent avec lui de la place a donner au David de Michel-Ange, et de
qui le Louvre a acquis recemment un buste d'apres Philippe Strozzi?* To
this it may be objected that Benedetto da Majano had already lain in his
grave fourteen years, in the year 1511, when he is supposed to have
given the promise to Leonardo. The colours may have been given to the
sculptor Benedetto and the stone may have been in payment for them.
&gt;From the description of the stone here given we may conclude that it
is repeated from hearsay of the sculptor's account of it. I do not
understand how, from this observation, it is possible to conclude that
Leonardo was on the spot.
