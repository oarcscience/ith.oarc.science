### OF PAINTING.

<span class="margnote"> The necessity of anatomical knowledge (488.
489).</span>It is indispensable to a Painter who would be thoroughly
familiar with the limbs in all the positions and actions of which they
are capable, in the nude, to know the anatomy of the sinews, bones,
muscles and tendons so that, in their various movements and exertions,
he may know which nerve or muscle is the cause of each movement and show
those only as prominent and thickened, and not the others all over \[the
limb\], as many do who, to seem great draughtsmen, draw their nude
figures looking like wood, devoid of grace; so that you would think you
were looking at a sack of walnuts rather than the human form, or a
bundle of radishes rather than the muscles of figures.
