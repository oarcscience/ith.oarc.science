*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 246.

An opaque body will appear smaller when it is surrounded by a highly
luminous background, and a light body will appear larger when it is seen
against a darker background. This may be seen in the height of buildings
at night, when lightning flashes behind them; it suddenly seems, when it
lightens, as though the height of the building were diminished. For the
same reason such buildings look larger in a mist, or by night than when
the atmosphere is clear and light.
