*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 849.

The waters return with constant motion from the lowest depths of the sea
to the utmost height of the mountains, not obeying the nature of heavier
bodies; and in this they resemble the blood of animated beings which
always moves from the sea of the heart and flows towards the top of the
head; and here it may burst a vein, as may be seen when a vein bursts in
the nose; all the blood rises from below to the level of the burst vein.
When the water rushes out from the burst vein in the earth, it obeys the
law of other bodies that are heavier than the air since it always seeks
low places.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_104"></span>[132:438](0849.htm#fr_104) : From this passage
it is quite plain that Leonardo had not merely a general suspicion of
the circulation of the blood but a very clear conception of it.
Leonardo's studies on the muscles of the heart are to be found in the
MS. W. An. III. but no information about them has hitherto been made
public. The limits of my plan in this work exclude all purely anatomical
writings, therefore only a very brief excerpt from this note book can be
given here. WILLIAM HARVEY (born 1578 and Professor of Anatomy at
Cambridge from 1615) is always considered to have been the discoverer of
the circulation of the blood. He studied medicine at Padua in 1598, and
in 1628 brought out his memorable and important work: *De motu cordis et
sanguinis*.
