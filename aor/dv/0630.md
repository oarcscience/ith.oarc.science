*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 630.

### TO REMOVE THE SMELL OF OIL.

Take the rank oil and put ten pints into a jar and make a mark on the
jar at the height of the oil; then add to it a pint of vinegar and make
it boil till the oil has sunk to the level of the mark and thus you will
be certain that the oil is returned to its original quantity and the
vinegar will have gone off in vapour, carrying with it the evil smell;
and I believe you may do the same with nut oil or any other oil that
smells badly.
