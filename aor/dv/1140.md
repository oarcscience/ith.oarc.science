*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1140.

<span class="margnote"> Psychology (1140-1147).</span>

And you, O Man, who will discern in this work of mine the wonderful
works of Nature, if you think it would be a criminal thing to destroy
it, reflect how much more criminal it is to take the life of a man; and
if this, his external form, appears to thee marvellously constructed,
remember that it is nothing as compared with the soul that dwells in
that structure; for that indeed, be it what it may, is a thing divine.
Leave it then to dwell in His work at His good will and pleasure, and
let not your rage or malice destroy a life--for indeed, he who does not
value it, does not himself deserve it  <span
