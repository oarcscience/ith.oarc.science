### 364.

### OF THE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS OF BOYS AND MEN.

There is a great difference in the length between the joints in men and
boys for, in man, from the top of the shoulder \[by the neck\] to the
elbow, and from the elbow to the tip of the thumb and from one shoulder
to the other, is in each instance two heads, while in a boy it is but
one because Nature constructs in us the mass which is the home of the
intellect, before forming that which contains the vital elements.
