### OF THE MOTIONS OF THE FINGERS.

The movements of the fingers principally consist in extending and
bending them. This extension and bending vary in manner; that is,
sometimes they bend altogether at the first joint; sometimes they bend,
or extend, half way, at the 2nd joint; and sometimes they bend in their
whole length and in all the three joints at once. If the 2 first joints
are hindered from bending, then the 3rd joint can be bent with greater
ease than before; it can never bend of itself, if the other joints are
free, unless all three joints are bent. Besides all these movements
there are 4 other principal motions of which 2 are up and down, the two
others from side to side; and each of these is effected by a single
tendon. From these there follow an infinite number of other movements
always effected by two tendons; one tendon ceasing to act, the other
takes up the movement. The tendons are made thick inside the fingers and
thin outside; and the tendons inside are attached to every joint but
outside they are not.
