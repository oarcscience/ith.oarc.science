*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1273.

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

Some flames had already lasted in the furnace of a glass-blower, when
they saw a candle approaching in a beautiful and glittering candlestick.
With ardent longing they strove to reach it; and one of them, quitting
its natural course, writhed up to an unburnt brand on which it fed and
passed at the opposite end out by a narrow chink to the candle which was
near. It flung itself upon it, and with fierce jealousy and greediness
it devoured it, having reduced it almost to death, and, wishing to
procure the prolongation of its life, it tried to return to the furnace
whence it had come. But in vain, for it was compelled to die, the wood
perishing together with the candle, being at last converted, with
lamentation and repentance, into foul smoke, while leaving all its
sisters in brilliant and enduring life and beauty.
