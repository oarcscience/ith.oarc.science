### I.

### STUDIES ON THE LIFE AND HABITS OF ANIMALS.

### THE LOVE OF VIRTUE.

The gold-finch is a bird of which it is related that, when it is carried
into the presence of a sick person, if the sick man is going to die, the
bird turns away its head and never looks at him; but if the sick man is
to be saved the bird never loses sight of him but is the cause of curing
him of all his sickness.

Like unto this is the love of virtue. It never looks at any vile or base
thing, but rather clings always to pure and virtuous things and takes up
its abode in a noble heart; as the birds do in green woods on flowery
branches. And this Love shows itself more in adversity than in
prosperity; as light does, which shines most where the place is darkest.
