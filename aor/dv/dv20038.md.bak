### *Introductory Observations on the Architectural Designs (XII), and Writings on Architecture (XIII).*

*Until now very little has been known regarding Leonardo's labours in
the domain of Architecture. No building is known to have been planned
and executed by him, though by some contemporary writers incidental
allusion is made to his occupying himself with architecture, and his
famous letter to Lodovico il Moro,--which has long been a well-known
document,--in which he offers his service as an architect to that
prince, tends to confirm the belief that he was something more than an
amateur of the art. This hypothesis has lately been confirmed by the
publication of certain documents, preserved at Milan, showing that
Leonardo was not only employed in preparing plans but that he took an
active part, with much credit, as member of a commission on public
buildings; his name remains linked with the history of the building of
the Cathedral at Pavia and that of the Cathedral at Milan.*

*Leonardo's writings on Architecture are dispersed among a large number
of MSS., and it would be scarcely possible to master their contents
without the opportunity of arranging, sorting and comparing the whole
mass of materials, so as to have some comprehensive idea of the whole.
The sketches, when isolated and considered by themselves, might appear
to be of but little value; it is not till we understand their general
purport, from comparing them with each other, that we can form any just
estimate of their true worth.*

*Leonardo seems to have had a project for writing a complete and
separate treatise on Architecture, such as his predecessors and
contemporaries had composed--Leon Battista Alberti, Filarete, Francesco
di Giorgio and perhaps also Bramante. But, on the other hand, it cannot
be denied that possibly no such scheme was connected with the isolated
notes and researches, treating on special questions, which are given in
this work; that he was merely working at problems in which, for some
reason or other he took a special interest.*

*A great number of important buildings were constructed in Lombardy
during the period between* 1472 *and* 1499*, and among them there are
several by unknown architects,*

*of so high an artistic merit, that it is certainly not improbable that
either Bramante or Leonardo da Vinci may have been, directly or
indirectly, concerned in their erection.*

*Having been engaged, for now nearly twenty years, in a thorough study
of Bramante's life and labours, I have taken a particular interest in
detecting the distinguishing marks of his style as compared with
Leonardo's. In 1869 I made researches about the architectural drawings
of the latter in the Codex Atlanticus at Milan, for the purpose of
finding out, if possible the original plans and sketches of the churches
of Santa Maria delle Grazie at Milan, and of the Cathedral at Pavia,
which buildings have been supposed to be the work both of Bramante and
of Leonardo. Since* 1876 *I have repeatedly examined Leonardo's
architectural studies in the collection of his manuscripts in the
Institut de France, and some of these I have already given to the public
in my work on* "Les Projets Primitifs pour la Basilique de St. Pierre de
Rome", *Pl.* 43*. In* 1879 *I had the opportunity of examining the
manuscript in the Palazzo Trivulzio at Milan, and in 1880 Dr Richter
showed me in London the manuscripts in the possession of Lord
Ashburnham, and those in the British Museum. I have thus had
opportunities of seeing most of Leonardo's architectural drawings in the
original, but of the manuscripts tliemselves I have deciphered only the
notes which accompany the sketches. It is to Dr Richter's exertions that
we owe the collected texts on Architecture which are now published, and
while he has undertaken to be responsible for the correct reading of the
original texts, he has also made it his task to extract the whole of the
materials from the various MSS. It has been my task to arrange and
elucidate the texts under the heads which have been adopted in this
work. MS. B. at Paris and the Codex Atlanticus at Milan are the chief
sources of our knowledge of Leonardo as an architect, and I have
recently subjected these to a thorough re-investigation expressly with a
view to this work.*

*A complete reproduction of all Leonardo's architectural sketches has
not, indeed, been possible, but as far as the necessarily restricted
limits of the work have allowed, the utmost completeness has been aimed
at, and no efforts have been spared to include every thing that can
contribute to a knowledge of Leonardo's style. It would have been very
interesting, if it had been possible, to give some general account at
least of Leonardo's work and studies in engineering, fortification,
canal-making and the like, and it is only on mature reflection that we
have reluctantly abandoned this idea. Leonardo's occupations in these
departments have by no means so close a relation to literary work, in
the strict sense of the word as we are fairly justified in attributing
to his numerous notes on Architecture.*

*Leonardo's architectural studies fall naturally under two heads:*

*I. Those drawings and sketches, often accompanied by short remarks and
explanations, which may be regarded as designs for buildings or
monuments intended to be built. With these there are occasionally
explanatory texts.*

*II. Theoretical investigations and treatises. A special interest
attaches to these because they discuss a variety of questions which are
of practical importance to this day. Leonardo's theory as to the origin
and progress of cracks in buildings is perhaps to be considered as
unique in its way in the literature of Architecture.*
