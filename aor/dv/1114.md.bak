<span class="margnote"> Methods of staying and moving in water</span>How
an army ought to cross rivers by swimming with air-bags ... How fishes
swim  <span id="fr_286"></span>[620](#fn_286.md) ; of the way in which they
jump out of the water, as may be seen with dolphins; and it seems a
wonderful thing to make a leap from a thing which does not resist but
slips away. Of the swimming of animals of a long form, such as eels and
the like. Of the mode of swimming against currents and in the rapid
falls of rivers. Of the mode of swimming of fishes of a round form. How
it is that animals which have not long hind quartres cannot swim. How it
is that all other animals which have feet with toes, know by nature how
to swim, excepting man. In what way man ought to learn to swim. Of the
way in which man may rest on the water. How man may protect himself
against whirlpools or eddies in the water, which drag him down. How a
man dragged to the bottom must seek the reflux which will throw him up
from the depths. How he ought to move his arms. How to swim on his back.
How he can and how he cannot stay under water unless he can hold his
breath \[13\]. How by means of a certain machine many people may stay
some time under water. How and why I do not describe my method of
remaining under water, or how long I can stay without eating; and I do
not publish nor divulge these by reason of the evil nature of men who
would use them as

means of destruction at the bottom of the sea, by sending ships to the
bottom, and sinking them together with the men in them. And although I
will impart others, there is no danger in them; because the mouth of the
tube, by which you breathe, is above the water supported on bags or
corks \[19\].
