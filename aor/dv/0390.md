*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 390.

### OF THE NATURE OF THE FOLDS IN DRAPERY.

<span class="margnote"> On draperies (390--392).</span>That part of a
fold which is farthest from the ends where it is confined will fall most
nearly in its natural form.

Every thing by nature tends to remain at rest. Drapery, being of equal
density and thickness on its wrong side and on its right, has a tendency
to lie flat; therefore when you give it a fold or plait forcing it out
of its flatness note well the result of the constraint in the part where
it is most confined; and the part which is farthest from this constraint
you will see relapses most into the natural state; that is to say lies
free and flowing.

### EXAMPLE.

 <span id="fr_198"></span>[196](#fn_198) Let *a b c* be the fold of the
drapery spoken of above, *a c* will be the places where this folded
drapery is held fast. I maintain that the part of the drapery which is
farthest from the plaited ends will revert most to its natural form.

Therefore, *b* being farthest from *a* and *c* in the fold *a b c* it
will be wider there than anywhere else.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_198"></span>[200:196](0390.htm#fr_198) 13: *a c sia*. In
the original text *b* is written instead of *c*--an evident slip of the
pen.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[200:197](0390.htm#fr_199) : See [Pl.
XXVIII](pl028.htm#img_pl028), No. 6, and compare the drawing from
Windsor [Pl. XXX](pl030.htm#img_pl030) for farther illustration of what
is here stated.
