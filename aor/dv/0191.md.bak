A shadow is never seen as of uniform depth on the surface which
intercepts it unless every portion of that surface is equidistant from
the luminous body. This is proved by the 7th which says:--The shadow
will appear lighter or stronger as it is surrounded by a darker or a
lighter background. And by the 8th of this:--The background will be in
parts darker or lighter, in proportion as it is farther from or nearer
to the luminous body. And:--Of various spots equally distant from the
luminous body those will always be in the highest light on which the
rays fall at the smallest angles: The outline of the shadow as it falls
on inequalities in the surface will be seen with all the contours
similar to those of the body that casts it, if the eye is placed just
where the centre of the light was.

The shadow will look darkest where it is farthest from the body that
casts it. The shadow *c d*, cast by the body in shadow *a b* which is
equally distant in all parts, is not of equal depth because it is seen
on a back ground of varying brightness.  <span
