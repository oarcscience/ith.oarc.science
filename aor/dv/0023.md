*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 23.

### OF THE 10 ATTRIBUTES OF THE EYE, ALL CONCERNED IN PAINTING.

Painting is concerned with all the 10 attributes of sight; which
are:--Darkness, Light, Solidity and Colour, Form and Position, Distance
and Propinquity, Motion and Rest. This little work of mine will be a
tissue \[of the studies\] of these attributes, reminding the painter of
the rules and methods by which he should use his art to imitate all the
works of Nature which adorn the world.
