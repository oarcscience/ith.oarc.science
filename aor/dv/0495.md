*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 495.

### OF WHETHER IT IS BETTER TO DRAW WITH COMPANIONS OR NOT.

<span class="margnote"> The distribution of time for studying
(495-497).</span>I say and insist that drawing in company is much better
than alone, for many reasons. The first is that you would be ashamed to
be seen behindhand among the students, and such shame will lead you to
careful study. Secondly, a wholesome emulation will stimulate you to be
among those who are more praised than yourself, and this praise of
others will spur you on. Another is that you can learn from the drawings
of others who do better than yourself; and if you are better than they,
you can profit by your contempt for their defects, while the praise of
others will incite you to farther merits.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_242"></span>[249:240](0495.htm#fr_242.md) : The contradiction
by this passage of the foregoing chapter is only apparent. It is quite
clear, from the nature of the reasoning which is here used to prove that
it is more improving to work with others than to work alone, that the
studies of pupils only are under consideration here.
