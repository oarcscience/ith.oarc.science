*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1058.

That there are springs which suddenly break forth in earthquakes or
other convulsions and suddenly fail; and this happened in a mountain in
Savoy where certain forests sank in and left a very deep gap, and about
four miles from here the earth opened itself like a gulf in the
mountain, and threw out a sudden and immense flood of water which
scoured the whole of a little valley of the tilled soil, vineyards and
houses, and did the greatest mischief, wherever it overflowed.
