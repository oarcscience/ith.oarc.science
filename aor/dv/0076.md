*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 76.

<span class="margnote"> The inversion of the images.</span>All the
images of objects which pass through a window \[glass pane\] from the
free outer air to the air confined within walls, are seen on the
opposite side; and an object which moves in the outer air from east to
west will seem in its shadow, on the wall which is lighted by this
confined air, to have an opposite motion.
