### THE ELEPHANT.

The huge elephant has by nature what is rarely found in man; that is
Honesty, Prudence, Justice, and the Observance of Religion; inasmuch as
when the moon is new, these beasts go down to the rivers, and there,
solemnly cleansing themselves, they bathe, and so, having saluted the
planet, return to the woods. And when they are ill, being laid down,
they fling up plants towards Heaven as though they would offer
sacrifice. --They bury their tusks when they fall out from old age.--Of
these two tusks they use one to dig up roots for food; but they save the
point of the other for fighting with; when they are taken by hunters and
when worn out by fatigue, they dig up these buried tusks and ransom
themselves.
