*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 473.

That portion of a tree which is farthest from the force which strikes it
is the most injured by the blow because it bears most strain; thus
nature has foreseen this case by thickening them in that part where they
can be most hurt; and most in such trees as grow to great heights, as
pines and the like.  <span id="fr_230"></span>[228](#fn_230)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_230"></span>[237:228](0473.htm#fr_230) : Compare the sketch
drawn with a pen and washed with Indian ink on [Pl.
XL](pl040.htm#img_pl040), No. 1. In the Vatican copy we find, under a
section entitled '*del fumo*', the following remark: *Era sotto di
questo capitulo un rompimento di montagna, per dentro delle quali roture
scherzaua fiame di fuoco, disegnate di penna et ombrate d'acquarella, da
uedere cosa mirabile et uiua* (Ed. MANZI, p. 235. Ed. LUDWIG, Vol. I,
460). This appears to refer to the left hand portion of the drawing here
given from the Windsor collection, and from this it must be inferred,
that the leaf as it now exists in the library of the Queen of England,
was already separated from the original MS. at the time when the Vatican
copy was made.
