*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 49.

<span class="margnote"> The nature of the outline.</span>The boundaries
of bodies are the least of all things. The proposition is proved to be
true, because the boundary of a thing is a surface, which is not part of
the body contained within that surface; nor is it part of the air
surrounding that body, but is the medium interposted between the air and
the body, as is proved in its place. But the lateral boundaries of these
bodies is the line forming the boundary of the surface, which line is of
invisible thickness. Wherefore O painter! do not surround your bodies
with lines, and above all when representing objects smaller than nature;
for not only will their external outlines become indistinct, but their
parts will be invisible from distance.
