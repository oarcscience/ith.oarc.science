### 885.

### OF THE PROOF THAT THE SUN IS HOT BY NATURE AND NOT BY VIRTUE.

<span class="margnote"> Of the nature of Sunlight.</span>That the heat
of the sun resides in its nature and not in its virtue \[or mode of

action\] is abundantly proved by the radiance of the solar body on which
the human eye cannot dwell and besides this no less manifestly by the
rays reflected from a concave mirror, which--when they strike the eye
with such splendour that the eye cannot bear them--have a brilliancy
equal to the sun in its own place. And that this is true I prove by the
fact that if the mirror has its concavity formed exactly as is requisite
for the collecting and reflecting of these rays, no created being could
endure the heat that strikes from the reflected rays of such a mirror.
And if you argue that the mirror itself is cold and yet send forth hot
rays, I should reply that those rays come really from the sun and that
it is the ray of the concave mirror after having passed through the
window.
