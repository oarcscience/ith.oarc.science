*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 503.

### OF VARIETY IN THE FIGURES.

<span class="margnote"> How to acquire universality (503-506).</span>The
painter should aim at universality, because there is a great want of
self-respect in doing one thing well and another badly, as many do who
study only the \[rules of\] measure and proportion in the nude figure
and do not seek after variety; for a man may be well proportioned, or he
may be fat and short, or tall and thin, or medium. And a painter who
takes no account of these varieties always makes his figures on one
pattern so that they might all be taken for brothers; and this is a
defect that demands stern reprehension.
