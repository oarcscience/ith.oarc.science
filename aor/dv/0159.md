*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 159.

Shadow is diminution of light.

Darkness is absence of light.

Shadow is divided into two kinds, of which the first is called primary
shadow, the second is derived shadow. The primary shadow is always the
basis of the derived shadow.

The edges of the derived shadow are straight lines.

The darkness of the derived shadow diminishes in proportion as it is
remote from the primary shadow.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_71"></span>[91:69](0159.htm#fr_71.md) : The theory of the
*ombra dirivativa*--a technical expression for which there is no precise
English equivalent is elaborately treated by Leonardo. But both text and
diagrams (as [Pl. IV](p1004.htm#img_pl004.md), 1-3 and [Pl.
V](pl005.htm#img_pl005).md) must at once convince the student that the
distinction he makes between *ombra primitiva* and *ombra dirivativa* is
not merely justifiable but scientific. *Ombra dirivativa* is by no means
a mere abstract idea. This is easily proved by repeating the experiment
made by Leonardo, and by filling with smoke the room in which the
existence of the *ombra dirivativa* is investigated, when the shadow
becomes visible. Nor is it difficult to perceive how much of Leonardo's
teaching depended on this theory. The recognised, but extremely
complicated science of cast shadows--*percussione dell' ombre
dirivative* as Leonardo calls them--is thus rendered more intelligible
if not actually simpler, and we must assume this theory as our chief
guide through the investigations which follow.
