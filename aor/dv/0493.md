*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 493.

### OF THE LIFE OF THE PAINTER IN THE COUNTRY.

<span class="margnote"> The artist's private life and choice of company
(493-494).</span>A painter needs such mathematics as belong to painting.
And the absence of all companions who are alienated from his studies;
his brain must be easily impressed by the variety of objects, which
successively come

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

before him, and also free from other cares  <span
id="fr_239"></span>[237](#fn_239.md) . And if, when considering and
defining one subject, a second subject intervenes--as happens when an
object occupies the mind, then he must decide which of these cases is
the more difficult to work out, and follow that up until it becomes
quite clear, and then work out the explanation of the other  <span
id="fr_240"></span>[238](#fn_240.md) . And above all he must keep his mind
as clear as the surface of a mirror, which assumes colours as various as
those of the different objects. And his companions should be like him as
to their studies, and if such cannot be found he should keep his
speculations to himself alone, so that at last he will find no more
useful company \[than his own\].

<span id="fn_239"></span>[248:237](0493.htm#fr_239.md) 6: Leonardo here

<span id="fn_240"></span>[248:238](0493.htm#fr_240.md) 11: Leonardo here
seems to be speaking of his own method of work as displayed in his MSS.
and this passage explains, at least in part, the peculiarities in their
arrangement.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[248:239](0493.htm#fr_241.md) : In the title line
Leonardo had originally written *del pictore filosofo* (the
philosophical painter), but he himself struck out*filosofo*. Compare in
No. 363 *pictora notomista* (anatomical painter). The original text is
partly reproduced on [Pl. CI](dv10784.htm#img_pl101.md).
