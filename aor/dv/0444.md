*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 444.

### OF TREES TO THE SOUTH.

<span class="margnote"> The effects of morning light
(444-448).</span>When the sun is in the east the trees to the South and
to the North have almost as much light as shadow. But a greater share of
light in proportion as they lie to the West and a greater share of
shadow in proportion as they lie to the East.

### OF MEADOWS.

If the sun is in the East the verdure of the meadows and of other small
plants is of a most beautiful green from being transparent to the sun;
this does not occur in the meadows to the West, and in those to the
South and North the grass is of a moderately brilliant green.
