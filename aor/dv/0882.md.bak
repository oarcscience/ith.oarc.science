*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 882.

Epicurus says the sun is the size it looks. Hence as it looks about a
foot across we must consider that to be its size; it would follow that
when the moon eclipses the sun, the sun ought not to appear the larger,
as it does. Then, the moon being smaller than the sun, the moon must be
less than a foot, and consequently when our world eclipses the moon, it
must be less than a foot by a finger's breadth; inasmuch as if the sun
is a foot across, and our earth casts a conical shadow on the moon, it
is inevitable that the luminous cause of the cone of shadow must be
larger than the opaque body which casts the cone of shadow.
