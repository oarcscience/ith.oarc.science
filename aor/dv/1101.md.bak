### 1101.

<span class="margnote"> Rhodes (1101. 1102).</span>In \[fourteen hundred
and\] eighty nine there was an earthquake in the sea of Atalia near
Rhodes, which opened the sea--that is its bottom--and into this opening
such a torrent of water poured that for more than three hours the bottom
of the sea was uncovered by reason of the water which was lost in it,
and then it closed to the former level.

It is scarcely likely that Leonardo should here mean 89 AD. Dr. H.
MULLER- STRUBING writes to me as follows on this subject: "With
reference to Rhodes Ross says (*Reise auf den Griechischen Inseln, III*
70 *ff*. 1840), that ancient history affords instances of severe
earthquakes at Rhodes, among others one in the second year of the 138th
Olympiad=270 B. C.; a remarkably violent one under Antoninus Pius (A. D.
138-161) and again under Constantine and later. But Leonardo expressly
speaks of an earthquake "*nel mar di Atalia presso a Rodi*", which is
singular. The town of Attalia, founded by Attalus, which is what he no
doubt means, was in Pamphylia and more than 150 English miles East of
Rhodes in a straight line. Leake and most other geographers identify it
with the present town of Adalia. Attalia is rarely mentioned by the
ancients, indeed only by Strabo and Pliny and no earthquake is spoken
of. I think therefore you are justified in assuming that Leonardo means
1489". In the elaborate catalogue of earthquakes in the East by Sciale
Dshelal eddin Sayouthy (an unpublished Arabic MS. in the possession of
Prof. SCHEFER, (Membre de l'Institut, Paris) mention is made of a
terrible earthquake in the year 867 of the Mohamedan Era corresponding
to the year 1489, and it is there stated that a hundred persons were
killed by it in the fortress of Kerak. There are three places of this
name. Kerak on the sea of Tiberias, Kerak near Tahle on the Libanon,
which I visited in the summer of l876--but neither of these is the place
alluded to. Possibly it may be the strongly fortified town of Kerak=Kir
Moab, to the West of the Dead Sea. There is no notice about this in
ALEXIS PERCY, *Memoire sur les tremblements de terres ressentis dans la
peninsule turco- hellenique et en Syrie (Memoires couronnes et memoires
des savants etrangers, Academie Royale de Belgique, Tome XXIII).*
