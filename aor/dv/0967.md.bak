### OF SPRINGS OF WATER ON THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS.

It is quite evident that the whole surface of the ocean--when there is
no storm--is at an equal distance from the centre of the earth, and that
the tops of the mountains are farther from this centre in proportion as
they rise above the surface of that sea; therefore if the body of the
earth were not like that of man, it would be impossible that the waters
of the sea--being so much lower than the mountains--could by their
nature rise up to the summits of these mountains. Hence it is to be
believed that the same cause which keeps the blood at the top of the
head in man keeps the water at the summits of the mountains.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_176"></span>[198:510](0967.htm#fr_176.md) : This conception of
the rising of the blood, which has given rise to the comparison, was
recognised as erroneous by Leonardo himself at a later period. It must
be remembered that the MS. A, from which these passages are taken, was
written about twenty years earlier than the MS. Leic. (Nos. 963 and 849)
and twenty-five years before the MS. W. An. IV.

There is, in the original a sketch with No. 968 which is not reproduced.
It represents a hill of the same shape as that shown at No. 982. There
are veins, or branched streams, on the side of the hill, like those on
the skull [Pl. CVIII](pl108.htm#img_pl108.md), No. 4
