### 507.

### OF GAMES TO BE PLAYED BY THOSE WHO DRAW.

<span class="margnote"> Useful games and exercises (507.
508).</span>When, Oh draughtsmen, you desire to find relaxation in games
you should always practise such things as may be of use in your
profession, by giving your eye good practice in judging accurately of
the breadth and length of objects. Thus, to accustom your mind to such
things, let one of

you draw a straight line at random on a wall, and each of you, taking a
blade of grass or of straw in his hand, try to cut it to the length that
the line drawn appears to him to be, standing at a distance of 10
braccia; then each one may go up to the line to measure the length he
has judged it to be. And he who has come nearest with his measure to the
length of the pattern is the best man, and the winner, and shall receive
the prize you have settled beforehand. Again you should take
forshortened measures: that is take a spear, or any other cane or reed,
and fix on a point at a certain distance; and let each one estimate how
many times he judges that its length will go into that distance. Again,
who will draw best a line one braccio long, which shall be tested by a
thread. And such games give occasion to good practice for the eye, which
is of the first importance in painting.
