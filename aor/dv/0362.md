### OF PAINTING.

<span class="margnote"> The proportions varyat different ages
(362-367).</span>Indicate which are the muscles, and which the tendons,
which become prominent or retreat in the different movements of each
limb; or which do neither \[but are passive\]. And remember that these
indications of action are of the first importance and necessity in any
painter or sculptor who professes to be a master &c

And indicate the same in a child, and from birth to decrepitude at every
stage of its life; as infancy, childhood, boyhood, youth &c

And in each express the alterations in the limbs and joints, which swell
and which grow thinner.
