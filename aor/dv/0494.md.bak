### 494.

### OF THE LIFE OF THE PAINTER IN HIS STUDIO.

To the end that well-being of the body may not injure that of the mind,
the painter or draughtsman must remain solitary, and particularly when
intent on those studies and reflections which will constantly rise up
before his eye, giving materials to be well stored in the memory. While
you are alone you are entirely your own \[master\] and if you have one
companion you are but half your own, and the less so in proportion to
the indiscretion of his behaviour. And if you have many companions you
will fall deeper into the same trouble. If you should say: "I will go my
own way and withdraw apart, the better to study the forms of natural
objects", I tell you, you will not be able to help often listening to
their chatter. And so, since one cannot serve two masters, you will
badly fill the part of a companion, and carry out your studies of art
even worse. And if you say: "I will withdraw so far that their words
cannot reach me and they cannot disturb me", I can tell you that you
will be thought mad. But, you see, you will at any rate be alone. And if
you must have companionship

find it in your studio. This may assist you to have the advantages which
arise from various speculations. All other company may be highly
mischievous.
