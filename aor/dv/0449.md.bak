*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 449.

### OBJECTS IN HIGH LIGHT SHOW BUT LITTLE, BUT BETWEEN LIGHT AND SHADOW

### THEY STAND OUT WELL.

<span class="margnote"> The effects of midday light.</span>To represent
a landscape choose that the sun shall be at noon and look towards the
West or East and then draw. And if you turn towards the North, every
object placed on that side will have no shadow, particularly those which
are nearest to the \[direction of the\] shadow of your head. And if you
turn towards the South every object on that side will be wholly in
shadow. All the trees which are towards the sun and have the atmosphere
for their background are dark, and the other trees which lie against
that darkness will be black \[very dark\] in the middle and lighter
towards the edges.
