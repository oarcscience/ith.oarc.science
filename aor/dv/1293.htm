<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE DIVISION OF THE PROPHECIES.</H3>
<P>
First, of things relating to animals; secondly, of irrational
creatures; thirdly of plants; fourthly, of ceremonies; fifthly, of
manners; sixthly, of cases or edicts or quarrels; seventhly, of
cases that are impossible in nature [paradoxes], as, for instance,
of those things which, the more is taken from them, the more they
grow. And reserve the great matters till the end, and the small
matters give at the beginning. And first show the evils and then the
punishment of philosophical things.
<P>
Of Ants.
<P>
These creatures will form many communities, which will hide
themselves and their young ones and victuals in dark caverns, and
they will feed themselves and their families in dark places for many
months without any light, artificial or natural.

<P><P>
(Of Bees.)
<P>
And many others will be deprived of their store and their food, and
will be cruelly submerged and drowned by folks devoid of reason. Oh
Justice of God! Why dost thou not wake and behold thy creatures thus
ill used?
<P>
(Of Sheep, Cows, Goats and the like.)
<P>
Endless multitudes of these will have their little children taken
from them ripped open and flayed and most barbarously quartered.
<P>
(Of Nuts, and Olives, and Acorns, and Chesnuts, and such like.)
<P>
Many offspring shall be snatched by cruel thrashing from the very
arms of their mothers, and flung on the ground, and crushed.
<P>
(Of Children bound in Bundles.)
<P>
O cities of the Sea! In you I see your citizens--both females and
males--tightly bound, arms and legs, with strong withes by folks who
will not understand your language. And you will only be able to
assuage your sorrows and lost liberty by means of tearful complaints
and sighing and lamentation among yourselves; for those who will
bind you will not understand you, nor will you understand them.
<P>
(Of Cats that eat Rats.)
<P>
In you, O cities of Africa your children will be seen quartered in
their own houses by most cruel and rapacious beasts of your own
country.
<P>
(Of Asses that are beaten.)
<P>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_323"></A><A HREF="#fn_323"><FONT SIZE="1">657</FONT></A>
 O Nature! Wherefore art thou so
partial; being to some of thy children a tender and benign mother,
and to others a most cruel and pitiless stepmother? I see children
of thine given up to slavery to others, without any sort of
advantage, and instead of remuneration for the good they do, they
are paid with the severest suffering, and spend their whole life in
benefitting those who ill treat them.
<P><A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A></P>
<P><P>
(Of Men who sleep on boards of Trees.)
<P>
Men shall sleep, and eat, and dwell among trees, in the forests and
open country.
<P>
(Of Dreaming.)
<P>
Men will seem to see new destructions in the sky. The flames that
fall from it will seem to rise in it and to fly from it with terror.
They will hear every kind of animals speak in human language. They
will instantaneously run in person in various parts of the world,
without motion. They will see the greatest splendour in the midst of
darkness. O! marvel of the human race! What madness has led you
thus! You will speak with animals of every species and they with you
in human speech. You will see yourself fall from great heights
without any harm and torrents will accompany you, and will mingle
with their rapid course.
<P>
(Of Christians.)
<P>
Many who hold the faith of the Son only build temples in the name of
the Mother.
<P>
(Of Food which has been alive.)
<P>
[84]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_324"></A><A HREF="#fn_324"><FONT SIZE="1">658</FONT></A>
 A great portion
of bodies that have been alive will pass into
the bodies of other animals; which is as much as to say, that the
deserted tenements will pass piecemeal into the inhabited ones,
furnishing them with good things, and carrying with them their
evils. That is to say the life of man is formed from things eaten,
and these carry with them that part of man which dies . . .

<P><A NAME="fn_322"></A><A HREF="1293.htm#fr_322">353:656</A> : Lines 1--51 are in the original written in one column,
beginning with the text of line 11. At the end of the column is the
programme for the arrangement of the prophecies, placed here at the
head: Lines 56--79 form a second column, lines 80--97 a third one
(see the reproduction of the text on the facsimile <A HREF="pl118.htm#img_pl118">Pl. CXVIII</A>).
<P>
Another suggestion for the arrangement of the prophecies is to be
found among the notes 55--57 on page 357.</P>
