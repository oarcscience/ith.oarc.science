### Footnotes

<span id="fn_21"></span>[29:355](0744.htm#fr_21.md) : On the same page we
find notes referring to Romolontino and Villafranca with a sketch-map of
the course of the "Sodro" and the "(Lo)cra" (both are given in the text
farther on). There can hardly be a doubt that the last sentence of the
passage given above, refers to the court of Francis I. King of
France.--L.9-13 are written inside the larger sketch, which, in the
original, is on the right hand side of the page by the side of lines
1-8. The three smaller sketches are below. J. P. R.
