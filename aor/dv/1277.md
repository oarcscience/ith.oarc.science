*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1277.

### A FABLE.

A nut, having been carried by a crow to the top of a tall campanile and
released by falling into a chink from the mortal grip of its beak, it
prayed the wall by the grace bestowed on it by God in allowing it to be
so high and thick, and to own such fine bells and of so noble a tone,
that it would succour it, and that, as it had not been able to fall
under the verdurous boughs of its venerable father and lie in the fat
earth covered up by his fallen leaves it would not abandon it; because,
finding itself in the beak of the cruel crow, it had there made a vow
that if it escaped from her it would end its life in a little hole. At
these words the wall, moved to compassion, was content to shelter it in
the spot where it had fallen; and after a short time the nut began to
split open and put forth roots between the rifts of the stones and push
them apart, and to throw out shoots from its hollow shell; and, to be
brief, these rose above the building and the twisted roots, growing
thicker, began to thrust the walls apart, and tear out the ancient
stones from their old places. Then the wall too late and in vain
bewailed the cause of its destruction and in a short time, it wrought
the ruin of a great part of it.
