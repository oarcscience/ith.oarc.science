It is impossible that an object mirrored on water should correspond in
form to the object mirrored, since the centre of the eye is above the
surface of the water.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

This is made plain in the figure here given, which demonstrates that the
eye sees the surface *a b*, and cannot see it at *l f*, and at *r t*; it
sees the surface of the image at *r t*, and does not see it in the real
object *c d*. Hence it is impossible to see it, as has been said above
unless the eye itself is situated on the surface of the water as is
shown below \[13\].

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_102"></span>[115:100](0207.htm#fr_102) : *A* stands for
*ochio* \[eye\], *B* for *aria* \[air\], *C* for *acqua* \[water\], *D*
for *cateto* \[cathetus\].--In the original MS. the second diagram is
placed below line 13.
