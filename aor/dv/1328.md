*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1328.

### A COMMON THING.

A wretched person will be flattered, and these flatterers are always the
deceivers, robbers and murderers of the wretched person.

The image of the sun where it falls appears as a thing which covers the
person who attempts to cover it.

(Money and Gold.)

Out of cavernous pits a thing shall come forth which will make all the
nations of the world toil and sweat with the greatest torments, anxiety
and labour, that they may gain its aid.

(Of the Dread of Poverty.)

The malicious and terrible \[monster\] will cause so much terror of
itself in men that they will rush together, with a rapid motion, like
madmen, thinking they are escaping her boundless force.

(Of Advice.)

The man who may be most necessary to him who needs him, will be repaid
with ingratitude, that is greatly contemned.
