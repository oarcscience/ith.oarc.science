### ALL BODIES, IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE NEARER TO, OR FARTHER FROM THE SOURCE OF LIGHT, WILL PRODUCE LONGER OR SHORTER DERIVED SHADOWS.

Among bodies of equal size, that one which is illuminated by the largest
light will have the shortest shadow. Experiment confirms this
proposition. Thus the body *m* *n* is surrounded by a larger amount of
light

than the body *p q*, as is shown above. Let us say that *v c a b d x* is
the sky, the source of light, and that *s t* is a window by which the
luminous rays enter, and so *m n* and *p q* are bodies in light and
shade as exposed to this light; *m n* will have a small derived shadow,
because its original shadow will be small; and the derivative light will
be large, again, because the original light *c d* will be large and *p
q* will have more derived shadow because its original shadow will be
larger, and its derived light will be smaller than that of the body *m
n* because that portion of the hemisphere *a b* which illuminates it is
smaller than the hemisphere *c d* which illuminates the body *m n*.
