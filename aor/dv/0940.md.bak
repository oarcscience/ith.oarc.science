flow into the Mediterranean by the shores of Egypt; and if we will give
to this a fall of ten braccia a mile, as is usually allowed to the
course of rivers in general, we shall find that the Nile must have its
mouth ten miles lower than its source. Again, we see the Rhine, the
Rhone and the Danube starting from the German parts, almost the centre
of Europe, and having a course one to the East, the other to the North,
and the last to Southern seas. And if you consider all this you will see

high peaks of the maritime mountains; think then how much their tops
must be above the sea shores.
