### ON PAINTING AND PERSPECTIVE.

The divisions of Perspective are 3, as used in drawing; of these, the
first includes the diminution in size of opaque objects; the second
treats of the diminution and loss of outline in such opaque objects; the
third, of the diminution and loss of colour at long distances.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_18"></span>[17:16](0015.htm#fr_18.md) : The division is here
the same as in the previous chapter No. 14, and this is worthy of note
when we connect it with the fact that a space of about 20 years must
have intervened between the writing of the two passages.
