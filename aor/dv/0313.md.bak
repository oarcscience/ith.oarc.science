### Footnotes

<span id="fn_137"></span>[171:135](0313.htm#fr_137.md) : See [Pl.
VII](pl007.htm#img_pl007.md), No. 3. Reference may also be made here to two
pen and ink drawings of heads in profile with figured measurements, of
which there is no description in the MS. These are given on [Pl.
XVII](pl017.htm#img_pl017.md), No. 2.--A head, to the left, with part of
the torso \[W. P. 5a\], No. 1 on the same plate is from MS. A 2b and in
the original occurs on a page with wholly irrelevant text on matters of
natural history. M. RAVAISSON in his edition of the Paris MS. A has
reproduced this head and discussed it fully \[note on page 12\]; he has
however somewhat altered the original measurements. The complicated
calculations which M. RAVAISSON has given appear to me in no way
justified. The sketch, as we see it, can hardly have been intended for
any thing more than an experimental attempt to ascertain relative
proportions. We do not find that Leonardo made use of circular lines in
any other study of the proportions of the human head. At the same time
we see that the proportions of this sketch are not in accordance with
the rules which he usually observed (see for instance No. 310).
