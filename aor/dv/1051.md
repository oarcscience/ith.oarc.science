West at a distance of 20 miles.

Castel San Pietro lies exactly North West of Imola, at a distance of 7

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_237"></span>[243:571](1051.htm#fr_237) : Leonardo inserted
this passage on the margin of the circular plan, in water colour, of
Imola--see [Pl. CXI](pl111.htm#img_pl111) No. 1.--In the original the
fields surrounding the town are light green; the moat, which surrounds
the fortifications and the windings of the river Santerno, are light
blue. The parts, which have come out blackish close to the river are
yellow ochre in the original. The dark groups of houses inside the town
are red. At the four points of the compass drawn in the middle of the
town Leonardo has written (from right to left): *Mezzodi* (South) at the
top; to the left *Scirocho* (South east), *levante* (East), *Greco*
(North East), *Septantrione* (North), *Maesstro* (North West), *ponente*
(West) *Libecco* (South West). The arch in which the plan is drawn is,
in the original, 42 centimetres across.

At the beginning of October 1502 Cesare Borgia was shut up in Imola by a
sudden revolt of the Condottieri, and it was some weeks before he could
release himself from this state of siege (see Gregorovius, *Geschichte
der Stadt Rom im Mittelalter*, Vol. VII, Book XIII, 5, 5).

Besides this incident Imola plays no important part in the history of
the time. I therefore think myself fully justified in connecting this
map, which is at Windsor, with the siege of 1502 and with Leonardo's
engagements in the service of Cesare Borgia, because a comparison of
these texts, Nos. 1050 and 1051, raise, I believe, the hypothesis to a
certainty.
