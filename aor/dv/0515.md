*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 515.

### THAT THE LIGHT FOR DRAWING FROM NATURE SHOULD BE HIGH UP.

The light for drawing from nature should come from the North in order
that it may not vary. And if you have it from the South, keep the window
screened with cloth, so that with the sun shining the whole day the
light may not vary. The height of the light should be so arranged as
that every object shall cast a shadow on the ground of the same length
as itself.
