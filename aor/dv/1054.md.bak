### OF PAINTING.

On the tops and sides of hills foreshorten the shape of the ground and
its divisions,

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_239"></span>[244:573](1054.htm#fr_239.md) : This passage
evidently refers to the making of maps, such as [Pl.
CXII](pl112.htm#img_pl112), [CXIII](pl093.htm#img_pl093.md), and
[CXIV](pl094.htm#img_pl094.md). There is no mention of such works, it is
true, excepting in this one passage of MS. L. But this can scarcely be
taken as evidence against my view that Leonardo busied himself very
extensively at that time in the construction of maps; and all the less
since the foregoing chapters clearly prove that at a time so full of
events Leonardo would only now and then commit his observations to
paper, in the MS. L.

By the side of this text we find, in the original, a very indistinct
sketch, perhaps a plan of a position. Instead of this drawing I have
here inserted a much clearer sketch of a position from the same MS., L.
82b and 83a. They are the only drawings of landscape, it may be noted,
which occur at all in that MS.
