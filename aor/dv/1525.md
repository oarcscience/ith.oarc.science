*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1525.

Memorandum. That on the 8th day of April 1503, I, Leonardo da Vinci,
lent to Vante, miniature painter 4 gold ducats, in gold. Salai carried
them to him and gave them into his own hand, and he said he would repay
within the space of 40 days.

Memorandum. That on the same day I paid to Salai 3 gold ducats which he
said he wanted for a pair of rose-coloured hose with their trimming; and
there remain 9 ducats due to him-excepting that he owes me 20 ducats,
that is 17 I lent him at Milan, and 3 at Venice.

Memorandum. That I gave Salai 21 braccia of cloth to make a shirt, at io
soldi the braccio, which I gave him on the 20th day of April 1503.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_546"></span>[457:846](1525.htm#fr_546) : With regard to
Vante or Attavante, the miniature painter (not Nanni as I formerly
deciphered this name, which is difficult to read; see Zeitschrift fur
Bild. Kunst*, 1879, p. 155), and Vasari, Lives of Frate Giovanni da
Fiesole, of Bartolommeo della Gatta, and of Gherardo,* miniatore. *He,
like Leonardo, was one of the committee of artists who, in 1503,
considered the erection and placing of Michel Angelo's David. The date
of his death is not known; he was of the same age as Leonardo. Further
details will be found in '*Notizie di Attavante miniatore, e di alcuni
suoi lavori

' (Milanese's ed. of Vasari, III, 231-235).
