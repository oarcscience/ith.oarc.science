### FOR MAKING A CLEAN STABLE.

<span class="margnote"> On the dispositions of a stable.</span>The
manner in which one must arrange a stable. You must first divide its
width in 3 parts, its depth matters not; and let these 3 divisions be
equal and 6 braccia broad for each part and 10 high, and the middle part
shall be for the use of the stablemasters; the 2 side ones for the
horses, each of which must be 6 braccia in width and 6 in length, and be
half a braccio higher at the head than behind. Let the manger be at 2
braccia from the ground, to the bottom of the rack, 3 braccia, and the
top of it 4 braccia. Now, in order to attain to what I promise, that is
to make this place, contrary to the general custom, clean and neat: as
to the upper part of the stable, i. e. where the hay is, that part must
have at its outer end a window 6 braccia high and 6 broad, through which
by simple means the hay is brought up to the loft, as is shown by the
machine *E*; and let this be erected in a place 6 braccia wide, and as
long as the stable, as seen at *k p*. The other two parts, which are on
either side of this, are again divided; those nearest to the hay-loft
are 4 braccia, *p s*, and only for the use and circulation of the
servants belonging to the stable; the other two which reach to the outer
walls are 2 braccia, as seen at *s k*, and these are made for the
purpose of giving hay to the mangers, by means of funnels, narrow at the
top and wide over the manger, in order that the hay should not choke
them. They must be well plastered and clean and are represented at 4 *f
s*. As to the giving the horses water, the troughs must be of stone and
above them \[cisterns of\] water. The mangers may be opened as boxes are
uncovered by raising the lids.  <span id="fr_56"></span>[390](#fn_56)
