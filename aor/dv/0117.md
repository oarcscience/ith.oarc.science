### 117.

### OF PAINTING.

### OF THE THREE KINDS OF LIGHT THAT ILLUMINATE OPAQUE BODIES.

<span class="margnote"> Different sorts of light (117,118).</span>The
first kind of Light which may illuminate opaque bodies is called Direct
light--as that of the sun or any other light from a window or flame. The
second is Diffused \[universal\] light, such as we see in cloudy weather
or in mist and the like. The 3rd is Subdued light, that is when the sun
is entirely below the horizon, either in the evening or morning.
