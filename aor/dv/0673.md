*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 673.

He was blacker than a hornet, his eyes were as red as a burning fire and
he rode on a tall horse six spans across and more than 20 long with six
giants tied up to his saddle-bow and one in his hand which he gnawed
with his teeth. And behind him came boars with tusks sticking out of
their mouths, perhaps ten spans.
