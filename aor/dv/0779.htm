<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ON THE NATURE OF THE ARCH.</H3>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">WHAT IS AN ARCH?</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_v208600"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/v208600.jpg"></P>
<P>
The arch is nothing else than a force originated by two weaknesses,
for the arch in buildings is composed of two segments of a circle,
each of which being very weak in itself tends to fall; but as each
opposes this tendency in the other, the two weaknesses combine to
form one strength.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF THE KIND OF PRESSURE IN ARCHES.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_v208601"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/v208601.jpg"></P>
<P>
As the arch is a composite force it remains in equilibrium because
the thrust is equal from both sides; and if one of the segments
weighs more than the other the stability is lost, because the
greater pressure will outweigh the lesser.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">OF DISTRIBUTING THE PRESSURE ABOVE AN ARCH.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_v208602"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/v208602.jpg"></P>
<P>
Next to giving the segments of the circle equal weight it is
necessary to load them equally, or you will fall into the same
defect as before.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">WHERE AN ARCH BREAKS.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_v208700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/v208700.jpg"></P>
<P>
An arch breaks at the part which lies below half way from the
centre.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">SECOND RUPTURE OF THE ARCH.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_v208701"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/v208701.jpg"></P>
<P>
If the excess of weight be placed in the middle of the arch at the
point <I>a</I>, that weight tends to fall towards <I>b</I>, and the arch
breaks at 2/3 of its height at <I>c e</I>; and <I>g e</I> is as many times
stronger than <I>e a</I>, as <I>m o</I> goes into <I>m n</I>.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ON ANOTHER CAUSE OF RUIN.</H3>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="img_v208702"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/v208702.jpg"></P>
<P>
The arch will likewise give way under a transversal thrust, for when
the charge is not thrown directly on the foot of the arch, the arch
lasts but a short time.
