### 971.

<span class="margnote"> The tide in estuaries.</span>Book 9, of the
meeting of rivers and of their ebb and flow. The cause is the same in
the sea, where it is caused by the straits of Gibraltar; and again it is
caused by whirlpools.

\[3\] If two rivers meet together to form a straight line, and then
below two right angles take their course together, the flow and ebb will
happen now in one river and now in the other above their confluence, and
principally if the outlet for their united volume is no swifter than
when they were separate. Here occur 4 instances.
