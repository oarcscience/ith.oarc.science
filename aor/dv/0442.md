*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 442.

### OF THE HERBS OF THE FIELD.

Of the plants which take a shadow from the plants which spring among
them, those

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

which are on this side \[in front\] of the shadow have the stems lighted
up on a background of shadow, and the plants on which the shadows fall
have their stems dark on a light background; that is on the background
beyond the shadow.

### OF TREES WHICH ARE BETWEEN THE EYE AND THE LIGHT.

Of the trees which are between the eye and the light the part in front
will be light; but this light will be broken by the ramifications of
transparent leaves--being seen from the under side--and lustrous
leaves--being seen from the upper side; and the background below and
behind will be dark green, being in shadow from the front portion of the
said tree. This occurs in trees placed above the eye.
