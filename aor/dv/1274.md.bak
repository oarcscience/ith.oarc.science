*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1274.

A small patch of snow finding itself clinging to the top of a rock which
was lying on the topmost height of a very high mountain and being left
to its own imaginings, it began to reflect in this way, saying to
itself: "Now, shall not I be thought vain and proud for having placed
myself--such a small patch of snow--in so lofty a spot, and for allowing
that so large a quantity of snow as I have seen here around me, should
take a place lower than mine? Certainly my small dimensions by no means
merit this elevation. How easily may I, in proof of my insignificance,
experience the same fate as that which the sun brought about yesterday
to my companions, who were all, in a few hours, destroyed by the sun.
And this happened from their having placed themselves higher than became
them. I will flee from the wrath of the sun, and humble myself and find
a place befitting my small importance." Thus, flinging itself down, it
began to descend, hurrying from its high home on to the other snow; but
the more it sought a low place

the more its bulk increased, so that when at last its course was ended
on a hill, it found itself no less in size than the hill which supported
it; and it was the last of the snow which was destroyed that summer by
the sun. This is said for those who, humbling themselves, become
exalted.
