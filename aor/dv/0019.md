*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 19.

### OF THE MISTAKES MADE BY THOSE WHO PRACTISE WITHOUT KNOWLEDGE.

<span class="margnote"> Necessity of theoretical knowledge (19.
20).</span>Those who are in love with practice without knowledge are
like the sailor who gets into a ship without rudder or compass and who
never can be certain whether he is going. Practice must always be
founded on sound theory, and to this Perspective is the guide and the
gateway; and without this nothing can be done well in the matter of
drawing.
