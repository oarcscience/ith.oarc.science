*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 492.

### HOW THAT DILIGENCE \[ACCURACY\] SHOULD FIRST BE LEARNT RATHER THAN RAPID EXECUTION.

If you, who draw, desire to study well and to good purpose, always go
slowly to work in your drawing; and discriminate in. the lights, which
have the highest degree of brightness, and to what extent and likewise
in the shadows, which are those that are darker than the others and in
what way they intermingle; then their masses and the relative
proportions of one to the other. And note in their outlines, which way
they tend; and which part of the lines is curved to one side or the
other, and where they are more or less conspicuous and consequently
broad or fine; and finally, that your light and shade blend without
strokes and borders \[but\] looking like smoke. And when you have thus
schooled your hand and your judgment by such diligence, you will acquire
rapidity before you are aware.
