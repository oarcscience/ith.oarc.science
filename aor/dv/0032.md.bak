*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 32.

The pupil which is largest will see objects the largest. This is evident
when we look at luminous bodies, and particularly at those in the sky.
When the eye comes out of darkness and suddenly looks up at these
bodies, they at first appear larger and then diminish; and if you were
to look at those bodies through a small opening, you would see them
smaller still, because a smaller part of the pupil would exercise its
function.
