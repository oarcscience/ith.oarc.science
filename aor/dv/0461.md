### 461.

### OF PAINTING.

In landscapes which represent \[a scene in\] winter. The mountains
should not be shown blue, as we see in the mountains in the summer. And
this is proved  <span id="fr_228"></span>[226](#fn_228.md) in the 4th of
this which says: Among mountains seen from a great distance those will
look of the bluest colour which are in themselves the darkest; hence,
when the trees are stripped of their leaves, they will show a bluer
tinge which will be in itself darker; therefore, when the trees have
lost their leaves they will look of a gray colour, while, with their
leaves, they are green, and in proportion as the green is darker than
the grey hue the green will be of a bluer tinge than the gray. Also by
the 2nd of this: The shadows of trees covered with leaves are darker
than the shadows of those trees which have lost their leaves in
proportion as the trees covered with leaves are denser than those
without leaves--and thus my meaning is proved.

The definition of the blue colour of the atmosphere explains why the
landscape is bluer in the summer than in the winter.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[232:226](0461.htm#fr_228.md) 5. 6.: *Per la* 4*a
di questo*. It is impossible to ascertain what this quotation refers to.
*Questo* certainly does not mean the MS. in hand, nor any other now
known to us. The same remark applies to the phrase in line 15: *per la*
2*a di questo*.
