<P><A NAME="fn_480"></A><A HREF="1457.htm#fr_480">438:786</A> : This note occurs on a pen and ink drawing
made by Leonardo as a sketch for the celebrated
large cartoon in the possession of the Royal Academy
of Arts, in London. This cartoon is commonly
supposed to be identical with that described
and lauded by Vasari, which was exhibited in Florence
at the time and which now seems to be lost.
Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, in his valuable
paper (read before the Royal Soc. of Literature,
June 28, 1882) "On the St. Anne of Leonardo da
Vinci", has adduced proof that the cartoon now in the
Royal Academy was executed earlier at Milan. The note
here given, which is written on the sheet containing
the study for the said cartoon, has evidently no
reference to the drawing on which it is written
but is obviously of the same date. Though I have
not any opening here for discussing this question of
the cartoon, it seemed to me important to point out
that the character of the writing in this note does
not confirm the opinion hitherto held that the Royal
Academy cartoon was the one described by Vasari,
but, on the contrary, supports the hypothesis put
forward by Mr. Marks.</P>
