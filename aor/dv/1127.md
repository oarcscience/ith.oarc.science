<span class="margnote"> Of mining.</span>If you want to know where a
mine runs, place a drum over all the places where you suspect that it is
being made, and upon this drum put a couple of dice, and when you are
over the spot where they are mining, the dice will jump a little on the
drum at every blow which is given underground in the mining.

There are persons who, having the convenience of a river or a lake in
their lands, have made, close to the place where they suspect that a
mine is being made, a great reservoir of water, and have countermined
the enemy, and having found them, have turned the water upon them and
destroyed a great number in the mine.
