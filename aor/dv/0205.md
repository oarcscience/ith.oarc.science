### 205.

### OF REVERBERATION.

<span class="margnote"> On reverberation.</span>

Reverberation is caused by bodies of a bright nature with a flat and
semi opaque surface which, when the light strikes upon them, throw it
back again, like the rebound of a ball, to the former object.

### WHERE THERE CAN BE NO REFLECTED LIGHTS.

All dense bodies have their surfaces occupied by various degrees of
light and shade. The lights are of two kinds, one called original, the
other borrowed. Original light is that which is inherent in the flame of
fire or the light of the sun or of the atmosphere. Borrowed light will
be reflected light; but to return to the promised definition: I say that
this luminous reverberation is not produced by those portions of a body
which are turned towards darkened objects, such as shaded spots, fields
with grass of various height, woods whether green or bare; in which,
though that side of each branch which is turned towards the original
light has a share of that light, nevertheless the shadows cast by each
branch separately are so numerous, as well as those cast by one branch
on the others, that finally so much shadow is the result that the light
counts for nothing. Hence objects of this kind cannot throw any
reflected light on opposite objects.
