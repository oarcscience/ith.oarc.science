*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1238.

### THE GRASSHOPPER.

This silences the cuckoo with its song. It dies in oil and revives in
vinegar. It sings in the greatest heats

### THE BAT.

The more light there is the blinder this creature becomes; as those who
gaze most at the sun become most dazzled.--For Vice, that cannot remain
where Virtue appears.

### THE PARTRIDGE.

This bird changes from the female into the male and forgets its former
sex; and out of envy it steals the eggs from others and hatches them,
but the young ones follow the true mother.

### THE SWALLOW.

This bird gives sight to its blind young ones by means of celandine.
