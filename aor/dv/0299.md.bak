### OF THE MODE OF TREATING REMOTE OBJECTS IN PAINTING.

It is easy to perceive that the atmosphere which lies closest to the
level ground is denser

than the rest, and that where it is higher up, it is rarer and more
transparent. The lower portions of large and lofty objects which are at
a distance are not much seen, because you see them along a line which
passes through a denser and thicker section of the atmosphere. The
summits of such heights are seen along a line which, though it starts
from your eye in a dense atmosphere, still, as it ends at the top of
those lofty objects, ceases in a much rarer atmosphere than exists at
their base; for this reason the farther this line extends from your eye,
from point to point the atmosphere becomes more and more rare. Hence, O
Painter! when you represent mountains, see that from hill to hill the
bases are paler than the summits, and in proportion as they recede
beyond each other make the bases paler than the summits; while, the
higher they are the more you must show of their true form and colour.
