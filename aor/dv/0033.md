*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 33.

When the eye, coming out of darkness suddenly sees a luminous body, it
will appear much larger at first sight than after long looking at it.
The illuminated object will look larger and more brilliant, when seen
with two eyes than with only one. A luminous object will appear smaller
in size, when the eye sees it through a smaller opening. A luminous body
of an oval form will appear rounder in proportion as it is farther from
the eye.
