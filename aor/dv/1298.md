*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1298.

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

The Lion tribe will be seen tearing open the earth with their clawed
paws and in the caves thus made, burying themselves together with the
other animals that are beneath them.

Animals will come forth from the earth in gloomy vesture, which will
attack the human species with astonishing assaults, and which by their
ferocious bites will make confusion of blood among those they devour.

Again the air will be filled with a mischievous winged race which will
assail men and beasts and feed upon them with much noise-- filling
themselves with scarlet blood.
