*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1031.

### AT BORMIO.

At Bormio are the baths;--About eight miles above Como is the Pliniana,
which increases and ebbs every six hours, and its swell supplies water
for two mills; and its ebbing makes the spring dry up; two miles higher
up there is Nesso, a place where a river falls with great violence into
a vast rift in the mountain. These excursions are to be made in the
month of May. And the largest bare rocks that are to be found in this
part of the country are the mountains of Mandello near to those of
Lecco, and

of Gravidona towards Bellinzona, 30 miles from Lecco, and those of the
valley of Chiavenna; but the greatest of all is that of Mandello, which
has at its base an opening towards the lake, which goes down 200 steps,
and there at all times is ice and wind.

### IN VAL SASINA.

In Val Sasina, between Vimognio and Introbbio, to the right hand, going
in by the road to Lecco, is the river Troggia which falls from a very
high rock, and as it falls it goes underground and the river ends there.
3 miles farther we find the buildings of the mines of copper and silver
near a place called Pra' Santo Pietro, and mines of iron and curious
things. La Grigna is the highest mountain there is in this part, and it
is quite bare.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_220"></span>[239:554](1031.htm#fr_220.md) : 1030 and 1031.
From the character of the handwriting we may conclude that these
observations were made in Leonardo's youth; and I should infer from
their contents, that they were notes made in anticipation of a visit to
the places here described, and derived from some person (unknown to us)
who had given him an account of them.
