*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 118.

### OF LIGHT.

The lights which may illuminate opaque bodies are of 4 kinds. These are:
diffused light as that of the atmosphere, within our horizon. And
Direct, as that of the sun, or of a window or door or other opening. The
third is Reflected light; and there is a 4th which is that which passes
through \[semi\] transparent bodies, as linen or paper or the like, but
not transparent like glass, or crystal, or other diaphanous bodies,
which produce the same effect as though nothing intervened between the
shaded object and the light that falls upon it; and this we will discuss
fully in our discourse.
