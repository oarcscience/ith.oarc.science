*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 634.

... outside the bowl 2 fingers lower than the level of the oil, and pass
it into the neck of a bottle and let it stand and thus all the oil will
separate from this milky liquid; it will enter the bottle and be as
clear as crystal; and grind your colours with this, and every coarse or
viscid part will remain in the liquid. You must know that all the oils
that have been created in seads or fruits are quite clear by nature, and
the yellow colour you see in them only comes of your not knowing how to
draw it out. Fire or heat by its nature has the power to make them
acquire colour. See for example the exudation or gums of trees which
partake of the nature of rosin; in a short time they harden because
there is more heat in them than in oil; and after some time they acquire
a certain yellow hue tending to black. But oil, not having so much heat
does not do so; although it hardens to some extent into sediment it
becomes finer. The change in oil which occurs in painting proceeds from
a certain fungus of the nature of a husk which exists in the skin which
covers the nut, and this being crushed along with the nuts and being of
a nature much resembling oil mixes with it; it is of so subtle a nature
that it combines with all colours and then comes to the surface, and
this it is which makes them change. And if you want the oil to be good
and not to thicken, put into it a little camphor melted over a slow fire
and mix it well with the oil and it will never harden.
