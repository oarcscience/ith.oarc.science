*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 417.

You will see in the lower branches of the elder, which puts forth leaves
two and two placed crosswise \[at right angles\] one above another, that
if the stem rises straight up towards the sky this order never fails;
and its largest leaves are on the thickest part of the stem and the
smallest on the slenderest part, that is towards the top. But, to return
to the lower branches, I say that the leaves on these are placed on them
crosswise like \[those on\] the upper branches; and as, by the law of
all leaves, they are compelled to turn their upper surface towards the
sky to catch the dew at night, it is necessary that those so placed
should twist round and no longer form a cross.
