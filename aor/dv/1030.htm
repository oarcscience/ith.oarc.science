<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">LAKE OF COMO. VALLEY OF CHIAVENNA.</H3>
<P>
Above the lake of Como towards Germany is the valley of Chiavenna
where the river Mera flows into this lake. Here are barren and very
high mountains, with huge rocks. Among these mountains are to be
found the water-birds called gulls. Here grow fir trees, larches and
pines. Deer, wildgoats, chamois, and terrible bears. It is
impossible to climb them without using hands and feet. The peasants
go there at the time of the snows with great snares to make the
bears fall down these rocks. These mountains which very closely
approach each other are parted by the river. They are to the right
and left for the distance of 20 miles throughout of the same nature.
From mile to mile there are good inns. Above on the said river there
are waterfalls of 400 braccia in height, which are fine to see; and
there is good living at 4 soldi the reckoning. This river brings
down a great deal of timber.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">VAL SASINA.</H3>
<P>
Val Sasina runs down towards Italy; this is almost the same form and
character. There grow here many <I>mappello</I> and there are great ruins
and falls of water &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">553</FONT></A>

<P><H3 ALIGN="CENTER">VALLEY OF INTROZZO.</H3>
<P>
This valley produces a great quantity of firs, pines and larches;
and from here Ambrogio Fereri has his timber brought down; at the
head of the Valtellina are the mountains of Bormio, terrible and
always covered with snow; marmots (?) are found there.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">BELLAGGIO.</H3>
<P>
Opposite the castle Bellaggio there is the river Latte, which falls
from a height of more than 100 braccia from the source whence it
springs, perpendicularly, into the lake with an inconceivable roar
and noise. This spring flows only in August and September.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">VALTELLINA.</H3>
<P>
Valtellina, as it is called, is a valley enclosed in high and
terrible mountains; it produces much strong wine, and there is so
much cattle that the natives conclude that more milk than wine grows
there. This is the valley through which the Adda passes, which first
runs more than 40 miles through Germany; this river breeds the fish
<I>temolo</I> which live on silver, of which much is to be found in its
sands. In this country every one can sell bread and wine, and the
wine is worth at most one soldo the bottle and a pound of veal one
soldo, and salt ten dinari and butter the same and their pound is 30
ounces, and eggs are one soldo the lot.
