### OF A METHOD OF LEARNING WELL BY HEART.

<span class="margnote"> On the management of works (531.
532).</span>When you want to know a thing you have studied in your
memory proceed in this way: When you have drawn the same thing so many
times that you think you know it by heart, test it by drawing it without
the model; but have the model traced on flat thin glass and lay this on
the drawing you have made without the model, and note carefully where
the tracing does not coincide with your drawing, and where you find you
have gone wrong; and bear in mind not to repeat the same mistakes. Then
return to the model, and draw the part in which you were wrong again and
again till you have it well in your mind. If you have no flat glass for
tracing on, take some very thin kidts-kin parchment, well oiled and
dried. And when you have used it for one drawing you can wash it clean
with a sponge and make a second.
