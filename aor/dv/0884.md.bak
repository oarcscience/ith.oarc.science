### Footnotes

<span id="fn_127"></span>[151:461](0884.htm#fr_127.md) : Poseidonius of
Apamea, commonly called the Rhodian, because he taught in Rhodes, was a
Stoic philosopher, a contemporary and friend of Cicero's, and the author
of numerous works on natural science, among them.

Strabo quotes no doubt from one of his works, when he says that
Poseidonius explained how it was that the sun looked larger when it was
rising or setting than during the rest of its course (III, p. 135).
Kleomedes, a later Greek Naturalist also mentions this observation of
Poseidonius' without naming the title of his work; however, as
Kleomedes' Cyclia Theorica was not printed till 1535, Leonardo must have
derived his quotation from Strabo. He probably wrote this note in 1508,
and as the original Greek was first printed in Venice in 1516, we must
suppose him to quote here from the translation by Guarinus Veronensis,
which was printed as early as 1471, also at Venice (H. MULLER-STRUBING).
