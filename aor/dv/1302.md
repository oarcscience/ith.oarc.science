*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1302.

Men will deal bitter blows to that which is the cause of their life. (In
thrashing Grain.)

The skins of animals will rouse men from their silence with great
outcries and curses. (Balls for playing Games.)

Very often a thing that is itself broken is the occasion of much union.
(That is the Comb made of split Cane which unites the threads of Silk.)

The wind passing through the skins of animals will make men dance. (That
is the Bag-pipe, which makes people dance.)
