### Footnotes

<span id="fn_306"></span>[347:304](0667.htm#fr_306.md) : As this note is in
the same small Manuscript as the passage here immediately preceding it,
I may be justified in assuming that Leonardo meant to use the features
of the person here named as a suitable model for the figure of Christ.
The celebrated drawing of the head of Christ, now hanging in the Brera
Gallery at Milan, has obviously been so much restored that it is now
impossible to say, whether it was ever genuine. We have only to compare
it with the undoubtedly genuine drawings of heads of the disciples in
[Pl. XLVII](pl047.htm#img_pl047.md), and , to admit that not a single line
of the Milan drawing in its present state can be by the same hand.
