### INTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE:--THAT IS OF THE FUNCTION OF THE EYE.

<span class="margnote"> The function of the eye (21-23).</span>Behold
here O reader! a thing concerning which we cannot trust our forefathers,
the ancients, who tried to define what the Soul and Life are--which are
beyond proof, whereas those things, which can at any time be clearly
known and proved by experience, remained for many ages unknown or
falsely understood. The eye, whose function we so certainly know by
experience, has, down to my own time, been defined by an infinite number
of authors as one thing; but I find, by experience, that it is quite
another.  <span id="fr_20"></span>[18](#fn_20.md)

No. 70.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[19:19](0021.htm#fr_21.md) : In section 13 we
already find it indicated that the study of Perspective and of Optics is
to be based on that of the functions of the eye. Leonardo also refers to
the science of the eye, in his astronomical researches, for instance in
MS. F 25b '*Ordine del provare la terra essere una stella: Imprima
difinisce l'occhio'*, &c. Compare also MS. E 15b and F 60b. The
principles of astronomical perspective.
