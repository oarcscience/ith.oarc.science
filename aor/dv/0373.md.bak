*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 373.

If a man, in taking a jump from firm ground, can leap 3 braccia, and
when he was taking his leap it were to recede 1/3 of a braccio, that
would be taken off his former leap; and so if it were thrust forward 1/3
of a braccio, by how much would his leap be increased?
