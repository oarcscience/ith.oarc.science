### IN CONFIRMATION OF WHY THE WATER GOES TO THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS.

I say that just as the natural heat of the blood in the veins keeps it
in the head of man,--for when the man is dead the cold blood sinks to
the lower parts--and when the sun is hot on the head of a man the blood
increases and rises so much, with other humours, that by pressure in the
veins pains in the head are often caused; in the same way veins ramify
through the body of the earth, and by the natural heat which is
distributed throughout the containing body, the water is raised through
the veins to the tops of mountains. And this water, which passes through
a closed conduit inside the body of the mountain like a dead thing,
cannot come forth from its low place unless it is warmed by the vital
heat of the spring time. Again, the heat of the element of fire and, by
day, the heat of the sun, have power to draw forth the moisture of the
low parts of the mountains and to draw them up, in the same way as it
draws the clouds and collects their moisture from the bed of the sea.
