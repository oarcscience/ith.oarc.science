### 219.

A luminous body will appear less brilliant when surrounded by a bright
background.

\[2\] I have found that the stars which are nearest to the horizon look
larger than the others because light falls upon them from a larger
proportion of the solar body than when they are above us; and having
more light from the sun they give more light, and the bodies

which are most luminous appear the largest. As may be seen by the sun
through a mist, and overhead; it appears larger where there is no mist
and diminished through mist. No portion of the luminous body is ever
visible from any spot within the pyramid of pure derived shadow.
