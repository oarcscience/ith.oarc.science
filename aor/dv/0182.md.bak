### OF THE SHADOW CAST BY A BODY PLACED BETWEEN 2 EQUAL LIGHTS.

<span class="margnote"> The effect of light at different
distances.</span>A body placed between 2 equal lights will cast 2
shadows of itself in the direction of the lines of the 2 lights; and if
you move this body placing it nearer to one of the lights the shadow
cast towards the nearer light will be less deep than that which falls
towards the more distant one.
