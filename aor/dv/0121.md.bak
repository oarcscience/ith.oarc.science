*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 121.

Shadow is the diminution alike of light and of darkness, and stands
between darkness and light.

A shadow may be infinitely dark, and also of infinite degrees of absence
of darkness.

The beginnings and ends of shadow lie between the light and darkness and
may be infinitely diminished and infinitely increased. Shadow is the
means by which bodies display their form.

The forms of bodies could not be understood in detail but for shadow.
