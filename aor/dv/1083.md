<span class="margnote"> The straits of Gibraltar (1083-1085).</span>A
river of equal depth runs with greater speed in a narrow space than in a
wide one, in proportion to the difference between the wider and the
narrower one.

This proposition is clearly proved by reason confirmed by experiment.
Supposing that through a channel one mile wide there flows one mile in
length of water; where the river is five miles wide each of the 5 square
miles will require 1/5 of itself to be equal to the square mile of water
required in the sea, and where the river is 3 miles wide each of these
square miles will require the third of its volume to make up the amount
of the square mile of the narrow part; as is demonstrated in *f g h* at
the mile marked *n*.
