*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1445.

<span id="page_434">p. 434</span>

In that at Pavia the movement is more to be admired than any thing else.

The imitation of antique work is better than that of the modern things.

Beauty and utility cannot exist together, as seen in fortresses and in
men.

The trot is almost the nature of the free horse.

Where natural vivacity is lacking it must be supplied by art.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_456"></span>[434:762](1445.htm#fr_456.md) : *Quel di Pavia*.
*Pavia* is possibly a clerical error for *Padua*, and if so the meaning
of the passage is easily arrived at: *Quel di Padua* would be the bronze
equestrian statue of Gattamelata, on the Piazza del Santo at Padua
executed by Donatelle in 1443 (see pp. 2 and 3).
