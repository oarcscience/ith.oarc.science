*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1219.

Why did nature not ordain that one animal should not live by the death
of another? Nature, being inconstant and

taking pleasure in creating and making constantly new lives and forms,
because she knows that her terrestrial materials become thereby
augmented, is more ready and more swift in her creating, than time in
his destruction; and so she has ordained that many animals shall be food
for others. Nay, this not satisfying her desire, to the same end she
frequently sends forth certain poisonous and pestilential vapours upon
the vast increase and congregation of animals; and most of all upon men,
who increase vastly because other animals do not feed upon them; and,
the causes being removed, the effects would not follow. This earth
therefore seeks to lose its life, desiring only continual reproduction;
and as, by the argument you bring forward and demonstrate, like effects
always follow like causes, animals are the image of the world.
