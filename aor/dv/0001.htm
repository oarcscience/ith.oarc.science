<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> The author's intention to publish his MSS.</FONT></span>How by a certain machine many may stay some time under water. And
how and wherefore I do not describe my method of remaining under
water and how long I can remain without eating. And I do not publish
nor divulge these, by reason of the evil nature of men, who would
use them for assassinations at the bottom of the sea by destroying
ships, and sinking them, together with the men in them. Nevertheless
I will impart others, which are not dangerous because the mouth of
the tube through which you breathe is above the water, supported on
air sacks or cork.

the words <I>Casi</I> 39, and most of these cases begin with the word

<I>Sughero</I>. In the Codex Antlanticus 377a; 1170a there is a sketch,
drawn with the pen, representing a man with a tube in his mouth, and
at the farther end of the tube a disk. By the tube the word
'<I>Channa</I>' is written, and by the disk the word '<I>sughero</I>'.</P>
