And if you choose to say that it was the deluge which carried these
shells away from the sea for hundreds of miles, this cannot have
happened, since that deluge was caused by rain; because rain naturally
forces the rivers to rush towards the sea with all the things they carry
with them, and not to bear the dead things of the sea shores to the
mountains. And if you choose to say that the deluge afterwards rose with
its waters above the mountains, the movement of the sea must have been
so sluggish in its rise against the currents of the rivers, that it
could not have carried, floating upon it, things heavier than itself;
and even if it had supported them, in its receding it would have left
them strewn about, in various spots. But how are we to account for the
corals which are found every day towards Monte Ferrato in Lombardy, with
the holes of the worms in them, sticking to rocks left uncovered by the
currents of rivers? These rocks are all covered with stocks and families
of oysters, which as we know, never move, but always remain with one of
their halves stuck to a rock, and the other they open to feed themselves
on the animalcules that swim in the water, which, hoping to find good
feeding ground, become the food of these shells. We do not find that the
sand mixed with seaweed has been petrified, because the weed which was
mingled with it has shrunk away, and this the Po shows us every day in
the debris of its banks.
