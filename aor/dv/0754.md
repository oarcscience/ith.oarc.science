*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 754.

Here there cannot and ought not to be any *campanile*; on the contrary
it must stand apart like that of the Cathedral and of San Giovanni at
Florence, and of the Cathedral at Pisa, where the campanile is quite
detached as well as the dome. Thus each can display its own perfection.
If however you wish to join it to the church, make the lantern serve for
the campanile as in the church at Chiaravalle.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_30"></span>[36:364](0754.htm#fr_30) : This text is written
by the side of the plan given on [Pl. XCI](pl091.htm#img_pl091). No. 2.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[36:365](0754.htm#fr_31) 12: The Abbey of
Chiaravalle, a few miles from Milan, has a central tower on the
intersection of the cross in the style of that of the Certosa of Pavia,
but the style is mediaeval (A. D. 1330). Leonardo seems here to mean,
that in a building, in which the circular form is strongly conspicuous,
the campanile must either be separated, or rise from the centre of the
building and therefore take the form of a lantern.
