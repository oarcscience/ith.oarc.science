each other. To prove this let *r* be one of the sides of the hole,
opposite to which let *s* be the eye which sees the lower end *o* of the
line *n o*. The other extremity cannot transmit its image to the eye *s*
as it has to strike the end *r* and it is the same with regard to *m* at
the middle of the line. The case is the same with the upper extremity
*n* and the eye *u*. And if the end *n* is red the eye *u* on that side
of the holes will not see the green colour of *o*, but only the red of
*n* according to the 7th of this where it is said: Every form projects
images from itself by the shortest line, which necessarily is a straight
line, &c
