*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1103.

### SITE FOR \[A TEMPLE OF\] VENUS.

<span class="margnote"> Cyprus (1103. 1104).</span>You must make steps
on four sides, by which to mount to a meadow formed by nature at the top
of a rock which may be hollowed out and supported in front by pilasters
and open underneath in a large portico,

 <span id="fr_278"></span>[612](#fn_278.md)

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

in which the water may fall into various vases of granite, porphyryand
serpentine, within semi-circular recesses; and the water may overflow
from these. And round this portico towards the North there should be a
lake with a little island in the midst of which should be a thick and
shady wood; the waters at the top of the pilasters should pour into
vases at their base, from whence they should flow in little channels.

Starting from the shore of Cilicia towards the South you discover the
beauties of the island of Cyprus.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_278"></span>[265:612](1103.htm#fr_278.md) : See [Pl.
LXXXIII](pl083.htm#img_pl083.md). Compare also p. 33 of this Vol. The
standing male figure at the side is evidently suggested by Michael
Angelo's David. On the same place a slight sketch of horses seems to
have been drawn first; there is no reason for assuming that the text and
this sketch, which have no connection with each other, are of the same
date.

*Sito di Venere.* By this heading Leonardo appears to mean Cyprus, which
was always considered by the ancients to be the home and birth place of
Aphrodite (Kirpic in Homer).
