### 196.

### THE BODY WHICH IS NEAREST TO THE LIGHT CASTS THE LARGEST SHADOW, AND WHY?

<span class="margnote"> On the relative size of shadows (196.
197).</span>If an object placed in front of a single light is very close
to it you will see that it casts a very large shadow on the opposite
wall, and the farther you remove the object from the light the smaller
will the image of the shadow become.

### WHY A SHADOW LARGER THAN THE BODY THAT PRODUCES IT BECOMES OUT OF PROPORTION.

The disproportion of a shadow which is larger than the body producing
it, results from the light being smaller than the body, so that it
cannot be at an equal distance from the edges of the body  <span
id="fr_96"></span>[94](#fn_96.md) ; and the portions which are most remote
are made larger than the nearer portions for this reason  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[95](#fn_97.md) .

### WHY A SHADOW WHICH IS LARGER THAN THE BODY CAUSING IT HAS ILL-DEFINED OUTLINES.

The atmosphere which surrounds a light is almost like light itself for
brightness and

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

colour; but the farther off it is the more it loses this resemblance. An
object which casts a large shadow and is near to the light, is
illuminated both by that light by the luminous atmosphere; hence this
diffused light gives the shadow ill-defined edges.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_96"></span>[109:94](0196.htm#fr_96.md) 11: H. LUDWIG in his
edition of the old copies, in the Vatican library--in which this chapter
is included under Nos. 612, 613 and 614 alters this passage as follows:
*quella parte ch'e piu propinqua piu cresce che le distanti*, although
the Vatican copy agrees with the original MS. in having *distante* in
the former and *propinque* in the latter place. This supposed amendment
seems to me to invert the facts. Supposing for instance, that on [Pl.
XXXI](pl031.htm#img_pl031.md) No. 3. *f* is the spot where the light is
that illuminates the figure there represented, and that the line behind
the figure represents a wall on which the shadow of the figure is
thrown. It is evident, that in that case the nearest portion, in this
case the under part of the thigh, is very little magnified in the
shadow, and the remoter parts, for instance the head, are more
magnified.
