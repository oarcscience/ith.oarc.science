### 1010.

### OF THE CANAL OF MARTESANA.

By making the canal of Martesana the water of the Adda is greatly
diminished by its distribution over many districts for the irrigation of
the fields. A remedy for this

would be to make several little channels, since the water drunk up by
the earth is of no more use to any one, nor mischief neither, because it
is taken from no one; and by making these channels the water which
before was lost returns again and is once more serviceable and useful to
men.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_206"></span>[231:540](1010.htm#fr_206) : *"el navilio di
Martagano"* is also mentioned in a note written in red chalk, MS. H2 17a
Leonardo has, as it seems, little to do with Lodovico il Moro's scheme
to render this canal navigable. The canal had been made in 1460 by
Bertonino da Novara. Il Moro issued his degree in 1493, but Leonardo's
notes about this canal were, with the exception of one (No. 1343),
written about sixteen years later.
