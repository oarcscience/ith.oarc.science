*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1337.

 <span id="fr_359"></span>[1337](#fn_359.md)Having often made you, by my
letters, acquainted with the things which have happened, I think I ought
not to be silent as to the events of the last few days, which--\[2\]...

Having several times--

Having many times rejoiced with you by letters over your prosperous
fortunes, I know now that, as a friend you will be sad with me over the
miserable state in which I find myself; and this is, that during the
last few days I have been in so much trouble, fear, peril and loss,
besides the miseries of the people here, that we have been envious of
the dead; and certainly I do not believe that since the elements by
their separation reduced the vast chaos to order, they have ever
combined their force and fury to do so much mischief to man. As far as
regards

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

us here, what we have seen and gone through is such that I could not
imagine that things could ever rise to such an amount of mischief, as we
experienced in the space of ten hours. In the first place we were
assailed and attacked by the violence and fury of the winds \[10\]; to
this was added the falling of great mountains of snow which filled up
all this valley, thus destroying a great part of our city \[ <span
id="fr_360"></span>[11](#fn_360.md)\]. And not content with this the
tempest sent a sudden flood of water to submerge all the low part of
this city \[12\]; added to which there came a sudden rain, or rather a
ruinous torrent and flood of water, sand, mud, and stones, entangled
with roots, and stems and fragments of various trees; and every kind of
thing flying through the air fell upon us; finally a great fire broke
out, not brought by the wind, but carried as it would seem, by ten
thousand devils, which completely burnt up all this neighbourhood and it
has not yet ceased. And those few who remain unhurt are in such
dejection and such terror that they hardly have courage to speak to each
other, as if they were stunned. Having abandoned all our business, we
stay here together in the ruins of some churches, men and women mingled
together, small and great\[ <span id="fr_361"></span>[17](#fn_361.md)\],
just like herds of goats.  <span id="fr_362"></span>[18](#fn_362.md)The
neighbours out of pity succoured us with victuals, and they had
previously been our enemies. And if

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

it had not been for certain people who succoured us with victuals, all
would have died of hunger. Now you see the state we are in. And all
these evils are as nothing compared with those which are promised to us
shortly.

I know that as a friend you will grieve for my misfortunes, as I, in
former letters have shown my joy at your prosperity ...

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_359"></span>[392:1337](1337.htm#fr_359.md) On comparing this
commencement of a letter l. 1-2 with that in l. 3 and 4 of No. 1336 it
is quite evident that both refer to the same event. (Compare also No.
1337 l. 10-l2 and 17 with No. 1336 l. 23, 24 and 32.) But the text No.
1336, including the fragment l. 3-4, was obviously written later than
the draft here reproduced. The *Diodario* is not directly addressed--the
person addressed indeed is not known--and it seems to me highly probable
that it was written to some other patron and friend whose name and
position are not mentioned.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[393:11](1337.htm#fr_360.md) *Della nostra citta*
(Leonardo first wrote *di questa citta*). From this we may infer that he
had at some time lived in the place in question wherever it might be.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[393:17](1337.htm#fr_361.md) *Certe ruine di
chiese*. Either of Armenian churches or of Mosques, which it was not
unusual to speak of as churches.

*Maschi e femmini insieme unite*, implies an infringement of the usually
strict rule of the separation of the sexes.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[393:18](1337.htm#fr_362.md) *I vicini, nostri
nimici*. The town must then have stood quite close to the frontier of
the country. Compare 1336. L. 7. *vicini ai nostri confini*. Dr. M.
JORDAN has already published lines 4-13 (see *Das Malerbuch, Leipzig*,
1873, p. 90:--his reading differs from mine) under the title of
"Description of a landscape near Lake Como". We do in fact find, among
other loose sheets in the Codex Atlanticus, certain texts referring to
valleys of the Alps (see Nos. 1030, 1031 and note p. 237) and in the
arrangement of the loose sheets, of which the Codex Atlanticus has been
formed, these happen to be placed close to this text. The compiler stuck
both on the same folio sheet; and if this is not the reason for Dr.
JORDAN'S choosing such a title (Description &c) I cannot imagine what it
can have been. It is, at any rate, a merely hypothetical statement. The
designation of the population of the country round a city as "the enemy"
(*nemici*) is hardly appropriate to Italy in the time of Leonardo.
