### OF STUDY AND THE ORDER OF STUDY.

<span class="margnote"> How to acquire practice.</span>I say that first

knowledge, their actions should come next, according to the
circumstances in which they occur in man. And thirdly to compose
subjects, the studies for which should be taken from natural actions and
made from time to time, as circumstances allow; and pay attention to
them in the streets and *piazze* and fields, and note them down with a
brief indication of the forms;  <span id="fr_236"></span>[234](#fn_236)
thus for a head make an o, and for an arm a straight or a bent line, and
the same for the legs and the body,  <span
id="fr_237"></span>[235](#fn_237) and when you return home work out
these notes in a complete form. The Adversary says that to acquire
practice and do a great deal of work it is better that the first period
of study should be employed in drawing various compositions done on
paper or on walls by divers masters, and that in this way practice is
rapidly gained, and good methods; to which I reply that the method will
be good, if it is based on works of good composition and by skilled
masters. But since such masters are so rare that there are but few of
them to be found, it is a surer way to go to natural objects, than to
those which are imitated from nature with great deterioration, and so
form bad methods; for he who can go to the fountain does not go to the
water-jar.
