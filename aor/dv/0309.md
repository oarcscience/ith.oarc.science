*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 309.

If a man 2 braccia high is too small, one of four is too tall, the
medium being what is admirable. Between 2 and 4 comes 3; therefore take
a man of 3 braccia in height and measure him by the rule I will give
you. If you tell me that I may be mistaken, and judge a man to be well
proportioned who does not conform to this division, I answer that you
must look at many men of 3 braccia, and out of the larger number who are
alike in their limbs choose one of those who are most graceful and take
your measurements. The length of the hand is 1/3 of a braccio \[8
inches\] and this is found 9 times in man. And the face  <span
id="fr_134"></span>[132](#fn_134) is the same, and from the pit of the
throat to the shoulder, and from the shoulder to the nipple, and from
one nipple to the other, and from each nipple to the pit of the throat.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_134"></span>[169:132](0309.htm#fr_134) 7: The account here
given of the *braccio* is of importance in understanding some of the
succeeding chapters. *Testa* must here be understood to mean the face.
The statements in this section are illustrated in part on [Pl.
XI](pl011.htm#img_pl011).
