### 145.

### OF THE DIFFERENT LIGHT AND SHADE IN VARIOUS ASPECTS AND OF OBJECTS PLACED IN THEM.

If the sun is in the East and you look towards the West you will see
every thing in full light and totally without shadow because you see
them from the same side as the sun: and if you look towards the South or
North you will see all objects in light and shade, because you see both
the side towards the sun and the side away from it; and if you look
towards the coming of the sun all objects will show you their shaded
side, because on that side the sun cannot fall upon them.
