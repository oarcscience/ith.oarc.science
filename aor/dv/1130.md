\[6\] Here there is to be a cylinder of cane after the manner of
clappers with a musical round called a Canon, which is sung in four
parts; each singer singing the whole round. Therefore I here make a
wheel with 4 teeth so that each tooth takes by itself the part of a
singer.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_296"></span>[282:630](1130.htm#fr_296.md) : In the original
there are some more sketches, to which the text, from line 6, refers.
They are studies for a contrivance exactly like the cylinder in our
musical boxes.
