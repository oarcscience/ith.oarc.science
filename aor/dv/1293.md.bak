### IV.

### PROPHECIES.

### THE DIVISION OF THE PROPHECIES.

First, of things relating to animals; secondly, of irrational creatures;
thirdly of plants; fourthly, of ceremonies; fifthly, of manners;
sixthly, of cases or edicts or quarrels; seventhly, of cases that are
impossible in nature \[paradoxes\], as, for instance, of those things
which, the more is taken from them, the more they grow. And reserve the
great matters till the end, and the small matters give at the beginning.
And first show the evils and then the punishment of philosophical
things.

Of Ants.

These creatures will form many communities, which will hide themselves
and their young ones and victuals in dark caverns, and they will feed
themselves and their families in dark places for many months without any
light, artificial or natural.

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

(Of Bees.)

And many others will be deprived of their store and their food, and will
be cruelly submerged and drowned by folks devoid of reason. Oh Justice
of God! Why dost thou not wake and behold thy creatures thus ill used?

(Of Sheep, Cows, Goats and the like.)

Endless multitudes of these will have their little children taken from
them ripped open and flayed and most barbarously quartered.

(Of Nuts, and Olives, and Acorns, and Chesnuts, and such like.)

Many offspring shall be snatched by cruel thrashing from the very arms
of their mothers, and flung on the ground, and crushed.

(Of Children bound in Bundles.)

O cities of the Sea! In you I see your citizens--both females and
males--tightly bound, arms and legs, with strong withes by folks who
will not understand your language. And you will only be able to assuage
your sorrows and lost liberty by means of tearful complaints and sighing
and lamentation among yourselves; for those who will bind you will not
understand you, nor will you understand them.

(Of Cats that eat Rats.)

In you, O cities of Africa your children will be seen quartered in their
own houses by most cruel and rapacious beasts of your own country.

(Of Asses that are beaten.)

 <span id="fr_323"></span>[657](#fn_323.md) O Nature! Wherefore art thou so
partial; being to some of thy children a tender and benign mother, and
to others a most cruel and pitiless stepmother? I see children of thine
given up to slavery to others, without any sort of advantage, and
instead of remuneration for the good they do, they are paid with the
severest suffering, and spend their whole life in benefitting those who
ill treat them.

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

(Of Men who sleep on boards of Trees.)

Men shall sleep, and eat, and dwell among trees, in the forests and open
country.

(Of Dreaming.)

Men will seem to see new destructions in the sky. The flames that fall
from it will seem to rise in it and to fly from it with terror. They
will hear every kind of animals speak in human language. They will
instantaneously run in person in various parts of the world, without
motion. They will see the greatest splendour in the midst of darkness.
O! marvel of the human race! What madness has led you thus! You will
speak with animals of every species and they with you in human speech.
You will see yourself fall from great heights without any harm and
torrents will accompany you, and will mingle with their rapid course.

(Of Christians.)

Many who hold the faith of the Son only build temples in the name of the
Mother.

(Of Food which has been alive.)

\[84\] <span id="fr_324"></span>[658](#fn_324.md) A great portion of bodies
that have been alive will pass into the bodies of other animals; which
is as much as to say, that the deserted tenements will pass piecemeal
into the inhabited ones, furnishing them with good things, and carrying
with them their evils. That is to say the life of man is formed from
things eaten, and these carry with them that part of man which dies . .

<span id="fn_322"></span>[353:656](1293.htm#fr_322.md) : Lines 1--51 are in
the original written in one column, beginning with the text of line 11.
At the end of the column is the programme for the arrangement of the
