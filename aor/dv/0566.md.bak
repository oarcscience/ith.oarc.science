### HOW WHITE BODIES SHOULD BE REPRESENTED.

<span class="margnote"> On the lighting of white objects.</span>

If you are representing a white body let it be surrounded by ample
space, because as white has no colour of its own, it is tinged and
altered in some degree by the colour of the objects surrounding it. If
you see

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

a woman dressed in white in the midst of a landscape, that side which is
towards the sun is bright in colour, so much so that in some portions it
will dazzle the eyes like the sun itself; and the side which is towards
the atmosphere,--luminous through being interwoven with the sun's rays
and penetrated by them--since the atmosphere itself is blue, that side
of the woman's figure will appear steeped in blue. If the surface of the
ground about her be meadows and if she be standing between a field
lighted up by the sun and the sun itself, you will see every portion of
those folds which are towards the meadow tinged by the reflected rays
with the colour of that meadow. Thus the white is transmuted into the
colours of the luminous and of the non-luminous objects near it.
