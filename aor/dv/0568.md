*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 568.

### THE REASON WHY SMALL FIGURES SHOULD NOT BE MADE FINISHED.

I say that the reason that objects appear diminished in size is because
they are remote from the eye; this being the case it is evident that
there must be a great extent of atmosphere between the eye and the
objects, and this air interferes with the distinctness of the forms of
the object. Hence the minute details of these objects will be
indistinguishable and unrecognisable. Therefore, O Painter, make your
smaller figures merely indicated and not highly finished, otherwise you
will produce effects the opposite to nature, your supreme guide. The
object is small by reason of the great distance between it and the eye,
this great distance is filled with air, that mass of air forms a dense
body which intervenes and prevents the eye seeing the minute details of
objects.
