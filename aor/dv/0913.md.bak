Why the planets appear larger in the East than they do overhead, whereas
the contrary should be the case, as they are 3500 miles nearer to us
when in mid sky than when on the horizon.

All the degrees of the elements, through which the images of the
celestial bodies pass to reach the eye, are equal curves and the angles
by which the central line of those images passes through them, are
unequal angles  <span id="fr_155"></span>[489](#fn_155.md) ; and the
distance is greater, as is shown by the excess of *a b* beyond *a d*;
and the enlargement of these celestial bodies on the horizon is shown by
the 9th of the 7th.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[170:489](0913.htm#fr_155.md) 13: *inequali*, here
and elsewhere does not mean unequal in the sense of not being equal to
each other, but angles which are not right angles.
