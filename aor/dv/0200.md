### 200.

<span class="margnote"> On the relative depth of cast shadows
(200-202).</span>A spot is most in the shade when a large number of
darkened rays fall upon it. The spot which receives the rays at the
widest angle and by darkened rays will be most in the dark; a will be
twice as dark as b, because it originates from twice as large a base at
an equal distance. A spot is most illuminated when a large number of
luminous rays fall upon it. d is the beginning of the shadow *d f*, and
tinges *c* but *a* little; *d e* is half of the shadow *d f* and gives a
deeper tone where it is cast at *b* than at *f*. And the whole shaded
space *e* gives its tone to the spot *a*.  <span
