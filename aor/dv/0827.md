### PHYSIOLOGY.

<span class="margnote"> Comparative study of the organs of sense in men
and animals.</span>I have found that in the composition of the human
body as compared with the bodies of animals the organs of sense are
duller and coarser. Thus it is composed of less ingenious instruments,
and of spaces less capacious for receiving the faculties of sense. I
have seen in the Lion tribe that the sense of smell is connected with
part of the substance of the brain which comes down the nostrils, which
form a spacious receptacle for the sense of smell, which enters by a
great number of cartilaginous vesicles with several passages leading up
to where the brain, as before said, comes down.

The eyes in the Lion tribe have a large part of the head for their
sockets and the optic nerves communicate at once with the brain; but the
contrary is to be seen in man, for the sockets of the eyes are but a
small part of the head, and the optic nerves are very fine and long and
weak, and by the weakness of their action we see by day but badly at
night, while these animals can see as well at night as by day. The proof
that they can see is that they prowl for prey at night and sleep by day,
as nocturnal birds do also.
