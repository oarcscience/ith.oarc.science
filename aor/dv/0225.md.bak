*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 225.

### OF THE ATMOSPHERE THAT INTERPOSES BETWEEN THE EYE AND VISIBLE OBJECTS.

<span class="margnote"> A guiding rule.</span>An object will appear more
or less distinct at the same distance, in proportion as the atmosphere
existing between the eye and that object is more or less clear. Hence,
as I know that the greater or less quantity of the air that lies between
the eye and the object makes the outlines of that object more or less
indistinct, you must diminish the definiteness of outline of those
objects in proportion to their increasing distance from the eye of the
spectator.
