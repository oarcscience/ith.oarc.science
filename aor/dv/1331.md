*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1331.

The circular plans of carrying earth are very useful, inasmuch as men
never stop in their work; and it is done in many ways. By one of these
ways men carry the earth on their shoulders, by another in chests and
others on wheelbarrows. The man who carries it on his shoulders first
fills the tub on the ground, and he loses time in hoisting it on to his
shoulders. He with the chests loses no time.  <span
