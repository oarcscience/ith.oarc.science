### OF SMALL FOLDS IN DRAPERIES.

How figures dressed in a cloak should not show the shape so much as that
the cloak looks as if it were next the flesh; since you surely cannot
wish the cloak to be next the flesh, for you must suppose that between
the flesh and the cloak there are other garments which prevent the forms
of the limbs appearing distinctly through the cloak. And those limbs
which you allow to be seen you must make thicker so that the other
garments may appear to be under the cloak. But only give something of
the true thickness of the limbs to a nymph  <span

thin draperies, pressed and clinging to the limbs of the figures by the
action of the wind.
