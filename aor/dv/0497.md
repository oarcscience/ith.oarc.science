*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 497.

### OF THE TIME FOR STUDYING SELECTION OF SUBJECTS.

Winter evenings ought to be employed by young students in looking over
the things prepared during the summer; that is, all the

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

drawings from the nude done in the summer should be brought together and
a choice made of the best \[studies of\] limbs and bodies among them, to
apply in practice and commit to memory.

### OF POSITIONS.

After this in the following summer you should select some one who is
well grown and who has not been brought up in doublets, and so may not
be of stiff carriage, and make him go through a number of agile and
graceful actions; and if his muscles do not show plainly within the
outlines of his limbs that does not matter at all. It is enough that you
can see good attitudes and you can correct \[the drawing of\] the limbs
by those you studied in the winter.
