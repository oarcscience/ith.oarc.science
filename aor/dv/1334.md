*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1334.

### TRICKS OF DIVIDING.

Take in each hand an equal number; put 4 from the right hand into the
left; cast away the remainder; cast away an equal number from the left
hand; add 5, and now you will find 13 in this \[left\] hand; that is--I
made you put 4 from the right hand into the left, and cast away the
remainder; now your right hand has 4 more; then I make you throw away as
many from the right as you threw away from the left; so, throwing from
each hand a quantity of which the remainder may be equal, you now have 4
and 4, which make 8, and that the trick may not be detected I made you
put 5 more, which made 13.

### TRICKS OF DIVIDING.

Take any number less than 12 that you please; then take of mine enough
to make up the number 12, and that which remains to me is the number
which you at first had; because when I said, take any number less than
12 as you please, I took 12 into my hand, and of that 12 you took such a
number as made up your number of 12; and what you added to your number,
you took from mine; that is, if you had 8 to go as far as to 12, you
took of my 12, 4; hence this

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 4 transferred from
me to you reduced my 12 to a remainder of 8, and your 8 became 12; so
that my 8 is equal to your 8, before it was made 12.

molti (?) ne descrisse, che si leggono poi riportati dal Paciolo nel suo

parte invenzioni del Vinci.*
