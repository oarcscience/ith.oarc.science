### 487.

It is better to imitate \[copy\] the antique than modern work.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_235"></span>[244:233](0487.htm#fr_235) 486, 487: These are
the only two passages in which Leonardo alludes to the importance of
antique art in the training of an artist. The question asked in No. 486
remains unanswered by him and it seems to me very doubtful whether the
opinion stated in No. 487 is to be regarded as a reply to it. This
opinion stands in the MS. in a connection--as will be explained later
on--which seems to require us to limit its application to a single
special case. At any rate we may suspect that when Leonardo put the
question, he felt some hesitation as to the answer. Among his very
numerous drawings I have not been able to find a single study from the
antique, though a drawing in black chalk, at Windsor, of a man on
horseback ([Pl. LXXIII](dv10783.htm#img_pl073)) may perhaps be a
reminiscence of the statue of Marcus Aurelius at Rome. It seems to me
that the drapery in a pen and ink drawing of a bust, also at Windsor,
has been borrowed from an antique model ([Pl.
XXX](pl030.htm#img_pl030)). G. G. Rossi has, I believe, correctly
interpreted Leonardo's feeling towards the antique in the following note
on this passage in manzi's edition, p. 501: "Sappiamo dalla storia, che
i valorosi artisti Toscani dell'età dell'oro dell'arte studiarono sugli
antichi marmi raccolti dal Magnifico LORENZO DE' MEDICI. Pare che il
Vinci a tali monumenti non si accostasse. Quest' uomo sempre riconosce
per maestra la natura, e questo principio lo stringeva alla sola
imitazione dì essa"--Compare No. 10, 26--28 footnote.
