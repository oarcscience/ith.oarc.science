### 834.

### OF THE NATURE OF SIGHT.

<span class="margnote"> On the conditions of sight (834. 835).</span>I
say that sight is exercised by all animals, by the medium of light; and
if any one adduces, as against this, the sight of nocturnal animals, I
must say that this in the same way is subject to the very same natural
laws. For it will easily be understood that the senses which receive the
images of things do not project from themselves any visual virtue  <span
id="fr_97"></span>[431](#fn_97.md) . On the contrary the atmospheric medium
which exists between the object and the sense incorporates in itself the
figure of things, and by its contact with the sense transmits the object
to it. If the object--whether by sound or by odour--presents its
spiritual force to the ear or the nose, then light is not required and
does not act. The forms of objects do not send their images into

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

the air if they are not illuminated \[8\]; and the eye being thus
constituted cannot receive that from the air, which the air does not
possess, although it touches its surface. If you choose to say that
there are many animals that prey at night, I answer that when the little
light which suffices the nature of their eyes is wanting, they direct
themselves by their strong sense of hearing and of smell, which are not
impeded by the darkness, and in which they are very far superior to man.
If you make a cat leap, by daylight, among a quantity of jars and crocks
you will see them remain unbroken, but if you do the same at night, many
will be broken. Night birds do not fly about unless the moon shines full
or in part; rather do they feed between sun-down and the total darkness
of the night.

 <span id="fr_98"></span>[432](#fn_98.md)

No body can be apprehended without light and shade, and light and shade
are caused by light.
