### 14.

### ON THE THREE BRANCHES OF PERSPECTIVE.

<span class="margnote"> The plan of the book on Painting
(14--17).</span>There are three branches of perspective; the first deals
with the reasons of the (apparent) diminution of objects as they recede
from the eye, and is known as Diminishing Perspective.--The second
contains the way in which colours vary as they recede from the eye. The
third and last is concerned with the explanation of how the objects \[in
a picture\] ought to be less finished in proportion as they are remote
(and the names are as follows):

Linear Perspective.  
The Perspective of Colour.  
The Perspective of Disappearance.

of the handwriting I infer that this passage was written before the year
1490.
