The shadow cast by an object on a plane will be smaller in proportion as
that object is lighted by feebler rays. Let *d e* be the object and *d
c* the plane surface; the number of times that *d e* will go into *f g*
gives the proportion of light at *f h* to *d c*. The ray of light will
be weaker in proportion to its distance from the hole through which it
falls.
