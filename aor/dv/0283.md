### WHAT PORTION OF A COLOURED SURFACE OUGHT IN REASON TO BE THE MOST

### INTENSE.

If *a* is the light, and *b* illuminated by it in a direct line, *c*, on
which the light cannot fall, is lighted only by reflection from *b*
which, let us say, is red. Hence the light reflected from it, will be
affected by the hue of the surface causing it and will tinge the surface
*c* with red. And if *c* is also red you will see it much more intense
than *b*; and if it were yellow you would see there a colour between
yellow and red.
