*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1223.

### GRATITUDE.

The virtue of gratitude is said to be more \[developed\] in the birds
called hoopoes which, knowing the benefits of life and food, they have
received from their father and their mother, when they see them grow
old, make a nest for them and brood over them and feed them, and with
their beaks pull out their old and shabby feathers; and then, with a
certain herb restore their sight so that they return to a prosperous
state.

### AVARICE.

The toad feeds on earth and always remains lean; because it never eats
enough:-- it is so afraid lest it should want for earth.
