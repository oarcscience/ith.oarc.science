*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 574.

### HOW TO KNOW WHICH SIDE OF AN OBJECT IS TO BE MORE OR LESS LUMINOUS THAN THE OTHER.

<span class="margnote"> Of the light on the face (574-576).</span>Let
*f* be the light, the head will be the object illuminated by it and that
side of the head on which the rays fall most directly will be the most
highly lighted, and those parts on which the rays fall most aslant will
be less lighted. The light falls as a blow might, since a blow which
falls perpendicularly falls with the greatest force, and when it falls
obliquely it is less forcible than the former in proportion to the width
of the angle. *Exempli gratia* if you throw a ball at a wall of which
the extremities are equally far from you the blow will fall straight,
and if you throw the ball at the wall when standing at one end of it the
ball will hit it obliquely and the blow will not tell.
