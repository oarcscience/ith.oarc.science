*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 901.

Answer to Maestro Andrea da Imola, who said that the solar rays
reflected from a convex mirror are mingled and lost at a short distance;
whereby it is altogether denied that the luminous side of the moon is of
the nature of a mirror, and that consequently the light is not produced
by the innumerable multitude of the waves of that sea, which I declared
to be the portion of the moon which is illuminated by the solar rays.

Let *o p* be the body of the sun, *c n s* the moon, and *b* the eye
which, above the base *c n* of the cathetus *c n m*, sees the body of
the sun reflected at equal angles *c n*; and the same again on moving
the eye from *b* to *a*.  <span id="fr_144"></span>[478](#fn_144)
