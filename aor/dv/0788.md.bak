*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 788.

An Experiment to show that a weight placed on an arch does not discharge
itself entirely on its columns; on the contrary the greater the weight
placed on the arches, the less the arch transmits the weight to the
columns. The experiment is the following. Let a man be placed on a steel
yard in the middle of the shaft of a well, then let him spread out his
hands and feet between the walls of the well, and you will see him weigh
much less on the steel yard; give him a weight on the shoulders, you
will see by experiment, that the greater the weight you give him the
greater effort he will make in spreading his arms and legs, and in
pressing against the wall and the less weight will be thrown on the
steel yard.
