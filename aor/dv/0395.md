*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 395.

Every year when the boughs of a plant \[or tree\] have made an end of
maturing their growth, they will have made, when put together, a
thickness equal to that of the main stem; and at every stage of its
ramification you will find the thickness of the said main stem; as: *i
k*, *g h*, *e f*, *c d*, *a b*, will always be equal to each other;
unless the tree is pollard--if so the rule does not hold good.

All the branches have a direction which tends to the centre of the tree
*m*.
