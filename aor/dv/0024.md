### ON PAINTING.

<span class="margnote"> Variability of the eye.</span>1st. The pupil of
the eye contracts, in proportion to the increase of light which is
reflected in it. 2nd. The pupil of the eye expands in proportion to the
diminution in the day light, or any other light, that is reflected in
it. 3rd.  <span id="fr_22"></span>[20](#fn_22) . The eye perceives and
recognises the objects of its vision with greater intensity in
proportion as the pupil is more widely dilated; and this can be proved
by the case of nocturnal animals, such as cats, and certain birds--as
the owl and others--in which the pupil varies in a high degree from
large to small, &c, when in the dark or in the light. 4th. The eye \[out
of doors\] in an illuminated atmosphere sees darkness behind the windows
of houses which \[nevertheless\] are light. 5th. All colours when placed
in the shade appear of an equal degree of darkness, among themselves.
6th. But all colours when placed in a full light, never vary from their
true and essential hue.
