*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 429.

Never paint leaves transparent to the sun, because they are confused;
and this is because on the transparency of one leaf will be seen the
shadow of another leaf which is above it. This shadow has a distinct
outline and a certain depth of shade and sometimes is \[as much as\]
half or a third of the leaf which is shaded; and consequently such an
arrangement is very confused and the imitation of it should be avoided.

The light shines least through a leaf when it falls upon it at an acute
angle.
