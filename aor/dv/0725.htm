the margin. This passage has been recently published by G. Govi in
Vol. V, Ser. 3a, of <I>Transunti, Reale Accademia dei Linea, sed. del
5 Giugno, 1881,</I> with the following introductory note: <I>"Desidero
intanto che siano stampati questi pochi frammenti perche so che sono
stati trascritti ultimamente, e verranno messi in luce tra poco
fuori d'Italia. Li ripubblichi pure chi vuole, ma si sappia almeno
che anche tra noi si conoscevano, e s'eran raccolti da anni per
comporne, quando che fosse, una edizione ordinata degli scritti di
Leonardo."</I>

The learned editor has left out line 22 and has written 3 <I>pie</I> for
8 <I>piedi</I> in line 25. There are other deviations of less importance
from the original.</P>
