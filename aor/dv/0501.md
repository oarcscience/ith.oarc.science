*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 501.

### OF THE MISERABLE PRETENCES MADE BY THOSE WHO FALSELY AND UNWORTHILY ACQUIRE THE NAME OF PAINTERS.

Now there is a certain race of painters who, having studied but little,
must need take as their standard of beauty mere gold and azure, and
these, with supreme conceit, declare that they will not give good work
for miserable payment, and that they could do as well as any other if
they were well paid. But, ye foolish folks! cannot such artists keep
some good work, and then say: this is a costly work and this more
moderate and this is average work and show that they can work at all
prices?
