*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 293.

### ALL COLOURS ARE AT A DISTANCE UNDISTINGUISHABLE AND UNDISCERNIBLE.

<span class="margnote"> An experiment.</span>All colours at a distance
are undistinguishable in shadow, because an object which is not in the
highest light is incapable of transmitting its image to the eye through
an atmosphere more luminous than itself; since the lesser brightness
must be absorbed by the greater. For instance: We, in a house, can see
that all the colours on the surface of the walls are clearly and
instantly visible when the windows of the house are open; but if we were
to go out of the house and look in at the windows from a little distance
to see the paintings on those walls, instead of the paintings we should
see an uniform deep and colourless shadow.
