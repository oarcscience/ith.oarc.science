*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 549.

### HOW THE PAINTER MUST PLACE HIMSELF WITH REFERENCE TO THE LIGHT, TO GIVE THE EFFECT OF RELIEF.

<span class="margnote"> On the choice of light for a picture
(549-554).</span>Let *a b* be the window, *m* the point of light. I say
that on whichever side the painter places himself he will be well placed

<span id="img_v127700"></span> ![](img/v127700.jpg)

if only his eye is between the shaded and the illuminated portions of
the object he is drawing; and this place you will find by putting
yourself between the point *m* and the division between the shadow and
the light on the object to be drawn.
