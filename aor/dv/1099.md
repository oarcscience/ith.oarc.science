*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1099.

<span class="margnote"> Customs of Asiatic Nations (1099.
1100).</span>The Assyrians and the people of Euboea accustom their
horses to carry sacks which they can at pleasure fill with air, and
which in case of need they carry instead of the girth of the saddle
above and at the side, and they are well covered with plates of cuir
bouilli, in order that they may not be perforated by flights of arrows.
Thus they have not on their minds their security in flight, when the
victory is uncertain; a horse thus equipped enables four or five men to
cross over at need.
