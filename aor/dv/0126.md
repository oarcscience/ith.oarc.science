### HOW THERE ARE 2 KINDS OF LIGHT, ONE SEPARABLE FROM, AND THE OTHER INSEPARABLE FROM BODIES.

<span class="margnote"> Of the various kinds of light (126,
127).</span>Separate light is that which falls upon the body.
Inseparable light is the side of the body that is illuminated by that
light. One is called primary, the other derived. And, in the same way
there are two kinds of shadow:--One primary and the other derived. The
primary is that which is inseparable from the body, the derived is that
which proceeds from the body conveying to the surface of the wall the
form of the body causing it.
