D. Design for a Mausoleum.

[Pl. XCVIII](pl098.htm#img_pl098) (P. V., 182. No. d'ordre 2386*.md). In
the midst of a hilly landscape rises an artificial mountain in the form
of a gigantic cone, crowned by an imposing temple. At two thirds of the
height a terrace is cut out with six doorways forming entrances to
galleries, each leading to three sepulchral halls, so constructed as to
contain about five hundred funeral urns, disposed in the customary
antique style. From two opposite sides steps ascend to the terrace in a
single flight and beyond it to the temple above. A large circular
opening, like that in the Pantheon, is in the dome above what may be the
altar, or perhaps the central monument on the level of the terrace
below.*

The section of a gallery given in the sketch to the right below shows
the roof to be constructed on the principle of superimposed horizontal
layers, projecting one beyond the other, and each furnished with a sort
of heel, which appears to be undercut, so as to give the appearance of a
beam from within. Granite alone would be adequate to the dimensions here
given to the key stone, as the thickness of the layers can hardly be
considered to be less than a foot. In taking this as the basis of our
calculation for the dimensions of the whole construction, the width of
the chamber would be about 25 feet but, judging from the number of urns
it contains--and there is no reason to suppose that these urns were
larger than usual--it would seem to be no more than about 8 or 10 feet.

The construction of the vaults resembles those in the galleries of some
etruscan tumuli, for instance the Regulini Galeassi tomb at Cervetri
(lately discovered) and also that of the chamber and passages of the
pyramid of Cheops and of the treasury of Atreus at Mycenae.

The upper cone displays not only analogies with the monuments mentioned
in the note, but also with Etruscan tumuli, such as the Cocumella

*tomb at Vulci, and the Regulini Galeassi tomb* <span

magnificent in the history of Architecture.*

It would be difficult to decide as to whether any monument he had seen
suggested this idea to Leonardo, but it is worth while to enquire, if
any monument, or group of monuments of an earlier date may be supposed
to have done so. <span id="fr_49"></span>[383](#fn_49.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_48"></span>[59:382](dv20063.htm#fr_48.md) 1: *See* FERSGUSON,
*Handbook of Architecture, I,* 291.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[59:383](dv20063.htm#fr_49.md) 2: *There are, in
Algiers, two Monuments, commonly called* "Le Madracen" *and* "Le tombeau
de la Chretienne," *which somewhat resemble Leonardo's design. They are
known to have served as the Mausolea of the Kings of Mauritania.
Pomponius Mela, the geographer of the time of the Emperor Claudius,
describes them as having been* "Monumentum commune regiae gentis." *See*
Le Madracen, Rapport fait par M. le Grand Rabbin AB. CAHEN, Constantine
1873--Memoire sur les fouilles executees au Madras'en .. par le Colonel
BRUNON, Constantine l873.--Deux Mausolees Africains, le Madracen et le
tombeau de la Chretienne par M. J. DE LAURIERE, Tours l874.--Le tombeau
de la Chretienne, Mausolee des rois Mauritaniens par M. BERBRUGGER,
Alger 1867.--*I am indebted to M. LE BLANC, of the Institut, and M. LUD,
LALANNE, Bibliothecaire of the Institut for having first pointed out to
me the resemblance between these monuments; while M. ANT. HERON DE
VlLLEFOSSE of the Louvre was kind enough to place the abovementioned
rare works at my disposal. Leonardo's observations on the coast of
Africa are given later in this work. The Herodium near Bethlehem in
Palestine* (Jebel el Fureidis, *the Frank Mountain) was, according to
the latest researches, constructed on a very similar plan. See* Der
Frankenberg, von Baurath C. SCHICK in Jerusalem, Zeitschrift des
Deutschen Palastina-Vereins, *Leipzag* 1880, *Vol. III, pages* 88-99
