### OF AERIAL PERSPECTIVE.

<span class="margnote"> The rules of aerial perspective
(295--297).</span>There is another kind of perspective which I call
Aerial Perspective, because by the atmosphere we are able to distinguish
the variations in distance of different buildings, which appear placed
on a single line; as, for instance, when we see several buildings beyond
a wall, all of which, as they appear above the top of the wall, look of
the same size, while you wish to represent them in a picture as more
remote one than another and to give the effect of a somewhat dense
atmosphere. You know that in an atmosphere of equal density the remotest
objects seen through it, as mountains, in consequence of the great
quantity of atmosphere between your eye and them--appear blue and almost
of the same hue as the atmosphere itself  <span
id="fr_130"></span>[128](#fn_130.md) when the sun is in the East  <span
id="fr_131"></span>[129](#fn_131.md) . Hence you must make the nearest
building above the wall of its real colour, but the more distant ones
make less defined and bluer. Those you wish should look farthest away
you must make proportionately bluer; thus, if one is to be five times as
distant, make it five times bluer. And by this rule the buildings which
above a \[given\] line appear of the same size, will plainly be
distinguished as to which are the more remote and which larger than the
others.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_130"></span>[159:128](0295.htm#fr_130.md) 10: *quado il sole e
per leuante* (when the sun is in the East). Apparently the author refers
here to morning light in general. H. LUDWIG however translates this
passage from the Vatican copy "*wenn namlich die Sonne (dahinter) im
Osten steht*".

<span id="fn_131"></span>[159:129](0295.htm#fr_131.md) 11: See Footnote 10
