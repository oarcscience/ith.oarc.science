If the light comes from *m* and the eye is at *n* the eye will see the
colour of the leaves *a b* all affected by the colour of *m* --that is
of the atmosphere; and *b c* will be seen from the under side as
transparent, with a beautiful green colour verging on yellow.

If *m* is the luminous body lighting up the leaf *s* all the eyes that
see the under side of this leaf will see it of a beautiful light green,
being transparent.

In very many cases the positions of the leaves will be without shadow
\[or in full light\], and their under side will be transparent and the
right side lustrous \[reflecting light\].
