### 984.

<span class="margnote"> The authorities for the study of the structure
of the earth.</span>Since things are much more ancient than letters, it
is no marvel if, in our day, no records exist of these seas having
covered so many countries; and if, moreover, some records had existed,
war and conflagrations, the deluge of waters, the changes of languages
and of laws have consumed every thing ancient. But sufficient for us is
the testimony of things created in the salt waters, and found again in
high mountains far from the seas.
