*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1234.

### CHASTITY.

The turtle-dove is never false to its mate; and if one dies the other
preserves perpetual chastity, and never again sits on a green bough, nor
ever again drinks of clear water.

### UNCHASTITY.

The bat, owing to unbridled lust, observes no universal rule in pairing,
but males with males and females with females pair promiscuously, as it
may happen.

### MODERATION.

The ermine out of moderation never eats but once in the day; it will
rather let itself be taken by the hunters than take refuge in a dirty
lair, in order not to stain its purity.
