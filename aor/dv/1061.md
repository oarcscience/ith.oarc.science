*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1061.

In the mountains of Verona the red marble is found all mixed with cockle
shells turned into stone; some of them have been filled at the mouth
with the cement which is the substance of the stone; and in some parts
they have remained separate from the mass of the rock which enclosed
them, because the outer covering of the shell had interposed and had not
allowed them to unite with it; while in other places this cement had
petrified those which were old and almost stripped the outer skin.
