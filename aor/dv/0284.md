### 284.

### WHY BEAUTIFUL COLOURS MUST BE IN THE \[HIGHEST\] LIGHT.

<span class="margnote"> On the use of dark and light colours in painting
(284--286).</span>Since we see that the quality of colour is known
\[only\] by means of light, it is to be supposed that where there is
most light the true character of a colour in light will be best seen;
and where there is most shadow the colour will be affected by the tone
of that. Hence, O Painter! remember to show the true quality of colours
in bright lights.
