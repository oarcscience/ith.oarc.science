### 35.

### ON PAINTING.

If the eye, when \[out of doors\] in the luminous atmosphere, sees a
place in shadow, this will look very much darker than it really is. This
happens only because the eye when out in the air contracts the pupil in
proportion

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

as the atmosphere reflected in it is more luminous. And the more the
pupil contracts, the less luminous do the objects appear that it sees.
But as soon as the eye enters into a shady place the darkness of the
shadow suddenly seems to diminish. This occurs because the greater the
darkness into which the pupil goes the more its size increases, and this
increase makes the darkness seem less.
