*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

### *XVIII.*

### *Naval Warfare.--Mechanical Appliances.--Music.*

*Such theoretical questions, as have been laid before the reader in
Sections XVI and XVII, though they were the chief subjects of Leonardo's
studies of the sea, did not exclusively claim his attention. A few
passages have been collected at the beginning of this section, which
prove that he had turned his mind to the practical problems of
navigation, and more especially of naval warfare. What we know for
certain of his life gives us no data, it is true, as to when or where
these matters came under his consideration; but the fact remains certain
both from these notes in his manuscripts, and from the well known letter
to Ludovico il Moro (No.* 1340*), in which he expressly states that he
is as capable as any man, in this very department.*

*The numerous notes as to the laws and rationale of the flight of birds,
are scattered through several note-books. An account of these is given
in the Bibliography of the manuscripts at the end of this work. It seems
probable that the idea which led him to these investigations was his
desire to construct a flying or aerial machine for man. At the same time
it must be admitted that the notes on the two subjects are quite
unconnected in the manuscripts, and that those on the flight of birds
are by far the most numerous and extensive. The two most important
passages that treat of the construction of a flying machine are those
already published as Tav. XVI, No.* 1 *and Tav. XVIII in the* "Saggio
delle opere di Leonardo da Vinci" *(Milan* 1872*). The passages--Nos.*
1120-1125--*here printed for the first time and hitherto unknown--refer
to the same subject and, with the exception of one already published in
the Saggio-- No.* 1126--*they are, so far as I know, the only notes,
among the numerous observations on the flight of birds, in which the
phenomena are incidentally and expressly connected with the idea of a
flying machine.*

*The notes on machines of war, the construction of fortifications, and
similar matters which fall within the department of the Engineer, have
not been included in this work, for the reasons given on page* 26 *of
this Vol. An exception has been made in favour of the passages Nos.*
1127 *and* 1128, *because they have a more general interest, as bearing
on*

*the important question: whence the Master derived his knowledge of
these matters. Though it would be rash to assert that Leonardo was the
first to introduce the science of mining into Italy, it may be
confidently said that he is one of the earliest writers who can be
proved to have known and understood it; while, on the other hand, it is
almost beyond doubt that in the East at that time, the whole science of
besieging towns and mining in particular, was far more advanced than in
Europe. This gives a peculiar value to the expressions used in No.*
1127.

*I have been unable to find in the manuscripts any passage whatever
which throws any light on Leonardo's great reputation as a musician.
Nothing therein illustrates VASARPS well-known statement:* Avvenne che
morto Giovan Galeazze duca di Milano, e creato Lodovico Sforza nel grado
medesimo anno 1494, fu condotto a Milano con gran riputazione Lionardo
al duca, il quale molto si dilettava del suono della lira, perche
sonasse; e Lionardo porto quello strumento ch'egli aveva di sua mano
fabbricato d'argento gran parte, in forma d'un teschio di cavallo, cosa
bizzarra e nuova, acciocche l'armonia fosse con maggior tuba e piu
sonora di voce; laonde supero tutti i musici che quivi erano concorsi a
sonare.

*The only notes on musical matters are those given as Nos.* 1129 *and*
1130, *which explain certain arrangements in instruments.*
