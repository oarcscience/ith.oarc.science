*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 563.

### OF THE BACKGROUND THAT THE PAINTER SHOULD ADOPT IN HIS WORKS.

Since experience shows us that all bodies are surrounded by light and
shade it is necessary that you, O Painter, should so arrange that the
side which is in light shall terminate against a dark body and likewise
that the shadow side shall terminate against a light body. And by
\[following\] this rule you will add greatly to the relief of your
figures.
