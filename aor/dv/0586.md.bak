*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 586.

### OF THE DELUSIONS WHICH ARISE IN JUDGING OF THE LIMBS.

<span class="margnote"> The selection of forms.</span>A painter who has
clumsy hands will paint similar hands in his works, and the same will
occur with any limb, unless long study has taught him to avoid it.
Therefore, O Painter, look carefully what part is most ill-favoured in
your own person and take particular pains to correct it in your studies.
For if you are coarse, your figures will seem the same and devoid of
charm; and it is the same with any part that may be good or poor in
yourself; it will be shown in some degree in your figures.
