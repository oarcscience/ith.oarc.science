Although the breadth and length of lights and shadow will be narrower
and shorter in foreshortening, the quality and quantity of the light and
shade is not increased nor diminished.

\[3\]The function of shade and light when diminished by foreshortening,
will be to give shadow and to illuminate an object opposite, according
to the quality and quantity in which they fall on the body.

\[5\]In proportion as a derived shadow is nearer to its penultimate
extremities the deeper it will appear, *g z* beyond the intersection
faces only the part of the shadow \[marked\] *y z*; this by intersection
takes the shadow from *m n* but by direct line it takes the shadow *a m*
hence it is twice as deep as *g z*. *Y x*, by intersection takes the
shadow *n o*, but by direct line the shadow *n m a*, therefore *x y* is
three times as dark as *z g*; *x f*, by intersection faces *o b* and by
direct line *o n m a*, therefore we must say that the shadow between *f
x* will be four times as dark as the shadow *z g*, because it faces four
times as much shadow.

Let *a b* be the side where the primary shadow is, and *b c* the primary
light, *d* will be the spot where it is intercepted,*f g* the derived
shadow and *f e* the derived light.

And this must be at the beginning of the explanation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_106"></span>[119:104](0215.htm#fr_106) : In the original
MS. the text of No. 252 precedes the one given here. In the text of No.
215 there is a blank space of about four lines between the lines 2 and
3. The diagram given on [Pl. VI](pl006.htm#img_pl006), No. 2 is placed
between lines 4 and 5. Between lines 5 and 6 there is another space of
about three lines and one line left blank between lines 8 and 9. The
reader will find the meaning of the whole passage much clearer if he
first reads the final lines 11--13. Compare also line 4 of No. 270.
