### 909.

<span class="margnote"> On instruments for observing the moon (909.
910).</span>If you want to prove why the moon appears larger than it is,
when it reaches the horizon; take a lens which is highly convex on one
surface and concave on the opposite, and place the concave side next the
eye, and look at the object beyond the convex surface; by this means you
will have produced an exact imitation of the atmosphere included beneath
the sphere of fire and outside that of water; for this atmosphere is
concave on the side next the earth, and convex towards the fire.
