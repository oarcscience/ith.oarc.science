From the eyebrow to the junction of the lip with the chin, and the
angle of the jaw and the upper angle where the ear joins the temple
will be a perfect square. And each side by itself is half the head.
<P>
The hollow of the cheek bone occurs half way between the tip of the
nose and the top of the jaw bone, which is the lower angle of the
setting on of the ear, in the frame here represented.
<P>
From the angle of the eye-socket to the ear is as far as the length
of the ear, or the third of the face.

<P><A NAME="fn_138"></A><A HREF="0315.htm#fr_138">172:136</A> : See <A HREF="pl009.htm#img_pl009">Pl. IX</A>. The text, in the original is written behind
the head. The handwriting would seem to indicate a date earlier than
1480. On the same leaf there is a drawing in red chalk of two
horsemen of which only a portion of the upper figure is here
visible. The whole leaf measures 22 1/2 centimetres wide by 29 long,
and is numbered 127 in the top right-hand corner.</P>
