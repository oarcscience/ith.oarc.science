### 860.

Why does not the weight *o* remain in its place? It does not remain
because it has no resistance. Where will it move to? It will move
towards the centre \[of gravity\]. And why by no other line? Because a
weight which has no support falls by the shortest road to the lowest
point which is the centre of the world. And why does the weight know how
to find it by so short a line? Because it is not independant and does
not move about in various directions.
