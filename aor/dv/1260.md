*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1260.

### THE HIPPOPOTAMUS.

This beast when it feels itself over-full goes about seeking thorns, or
where there may be the remains of canes that have been

split, and it rubs against them till a vein is opened; then when the
blood has flowed as much as he needs, he plasters himself with mud and
heals the wound. In form he is something like a horse with long
haunches, a twisted tail and the teeth of a wild boar, his neck has a
mane; the skin cannot be pierced, unless when he is bathing; he feeds on
plants in the fields and goes into them backwards so that it may seem,
as though he had come out.

### THE IBIS.

This bird resembles a crane, and when it feels itself ill it fills its
craw with water, and with its beak makes an injection of it.

### THE STAG.

These creatures when they feel themselves bitten by the spider called
father-long-legs, eat crabs and free themselves of the venom.
