*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1224.

### INGRATITUDE.

Pigeons are a symbol of ingratitude; for when they are old enough no
longer to need to be fed, they begin to fight with their father, and
this struggle does not end until the young one drives the father out and
takes the hen and makes her his own.

### CRUELTY.

The basilisk is so utterly cruel that when it cannot kill animals by its
baleful gaze, it turns upon herbs and plants, and fixing its gaze on
them withers them up.
