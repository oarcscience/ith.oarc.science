*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1338.

### BOOK 43. OF THE MOVEMENT OF AIR ENCLOSED IN WATER.

<span class="margnote"> Notes about events observed abroad
(1338-1339).</span>I have seen motions of the air so furious that they
have carried, mixed up in their course, the largest trees of the forest
and whole roofs of great palaces, and I have seen the same fury bore a
hole with a whirling movement digging out a gravel pit, and carrying
gravel, sand and water more than half a mile through the air.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_363"></span>[394:669](1338.htm#fr_363.md) : The first sixteen
lines of this passage which treat of the subject as indicated on the
title line have no place in this connexion and have been omitted.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[394:670](1338.htm#fr_364.md) 2: *Ho veduto
movimenti* &c Nothing of the kind happened in Italy during Leonardo's
lifetime, and it is therefore extremely probable that this refers to the
natural phenomena which are so fully described in the foregoing passage.
(Compare too, No. 1021.) There can be no doubt that the descriptions of
the Deluge in the Libro di Pittura (Vol. I, No. 607-611), and that of
the fall of a mountain No. 610, l. 17-30 were written from the vivid
impressions derived from personal experience. Compare also [Pl.
XXXIV](dv20952.htm#img_pl034.md)-XL.
