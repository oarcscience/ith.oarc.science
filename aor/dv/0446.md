*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 446.

### OF TREES IN THE EAST.

When the sun is in the East the trees seen towards the East will have
the light which surrounds them all round their shadows, excepting on the
side towards the earth; unless the tree has been pruned \[below\] in the
past year. And the trees to the South and North will be half in shade
and half in light, and more or less in shade or in light in proportion
as they are more or less to the East or to the West.

The \[position of\] the eye above or below varies the shadows and lights
in trees, inasmuch as the eye placed above sees the tree with the little
shadow, and the eye placed below with a great deal of shadow.

The colour of the green in plants varies as much as their species.
