### A JEST.

A sick man finding himself in *articulo mortis* heard a knock at the
door, and asking one of his servants who was knocking, the servant went
out, and answered that it was a woman calling herself Madonna Bona. Then
the sick man lifting his arms to Heaven thanked God with a loud voice,
and told the servants that they were to let her come in at once, so that
he might see one good woman before he died, since in all his life he had
never yet seen one.
