*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

### *III. Castles and Villas.*

### *A. Castles.*

*[Pl. LXXX](pl080.htm#img_pl080.md), No. 1 (P. V. fol. 39b; No. d'ordre
2282). The fortified place here represented is said by Vallardi to be
the* "castello" *at Milan, but without any satisfactory reason. The high
tower behind the* "rivellino" *ravelin--seems to be intended as a
watch-tower.*

*[Pl. LXXX](pl080.htm#img_pl080), No. 2 (MS. B, 23b.md). A similarly
constructed tower probably intended for the same use.*

*[Pl. LXXX](pl080.htm#img_pl080), No. 3 (MS. B.md). Sketches for corner
towers with steps for a citadel.*

*[Pl. LXXX](pl080.htm#img_pl080), No. 4 (W. XVI.md). A cupola crowning a
corner tower; an interesting example of decorative fortification. In
this reproduction of the original pen and ink drawing it appears
reversed.*

### *B. Projects for Palaces.*

*[Pl. LXXXI](pl081.htm#img_pl081.md), No. 2 (MS. C. A, 75b; 221a, see No.
748). Project for a royal residence at Amboise in France.*

*[Pl. LXXXII](pl082.htm#img_pl082), No. 1 (C. A 308a; 939a.md). A plan for
a somewhat extensive residence, and various details; but there is no
text to elucidate it; in courts are written the three names:*

### *C. Plans for small castles or Villas.*

*The three following sketches greatly resemble each other. [Pl.
LXXXII](pl082.htm#img_pl082), No. 2 (MS. K3 36b; see No. 749.md).*

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

*[Pl. LXXXII](pl082.htm#img_pl082), No. 3 (MS. B 60a; See No. 750.md).*

*[Pl. LXXXIII](pl083.htm#img_pl083) (W. XVII.md). The text on this sheet
refers to Cyprus (see Topographical Notes No. 1103), but seems to have
no direct connection with the sketches inserted between.*

*[Pl. LXXXVIII](pl088.htm#img_pl088.md), Nos. 6 and 7 (MS. B, 12a; see No.
751). A section of a circular pavilion with the plan of a similar
building by the side of it. These two drawings have a special historical
interest because the text written below mentions the Duke and Duchess of
Milan.*

*The sketch of a villa on a terrace at the end of a garden occurs in C.
A. 150; and in C. A. 77b; 225b is another sketch of a villa somewhat
resembling the* Belvedere *of Pope Innocent VIII, at Rome. In C. A. 62b;
193b there is a Loggia.*

*[Pl. LXXXII](pl082.htm#img_pl082), No. 4 (C. A. 387a; 1198a.md) is a
tower-shaped* Loggia *above a fountain. The machinery is very
ingeniously screened from view.*
