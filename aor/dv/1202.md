*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1202.

The lover is moved by the beloved object as the senses are by sensible
objects; and they unite and become one and the same thing. The work is
the first thing born of this union; if the thing loved is base the lover
becomes base.

When the thing taken into union is perfectly adapted to that which
receives it, the result is delight and pleasure and satisfaction.

When that which loves is united to the thing beloved it can rest there;
when the burden is laid down it finds rest there.
