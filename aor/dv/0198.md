### 198.

### OF MODIFIED SHADOWS.

<span class="margnote"> Effects on cast shadows by the tone of the back
ground.</span>Modified shadows are those which are cast on light walls
or other illuminated objects.

A shadow looks darkest against a light background. The outlines of a
derived shadow will be clearer as they are nearer to the primary shadow.
A derived shadow will be most defined in shape where it is intercepted,
where the plane intercepts it at the most equal angle.

Those parts of a shadow will appear darkest which have darker objects
opposite to them. And they will appear less dark when they face lighter
objects. And the larger the light object opposite, the more the shadow
will be lightened.

And the larger the surface of the dark object the more it will darken
the derived shadow where it is intercepted.
