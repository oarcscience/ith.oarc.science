### 980.

That the Northern bases of some Alps are not yet petrified. And this is
plainly to be seen where the rivers, which cut through them, flow
towards the North; where they cut through the strata in the living stone
in the higher parts of the mountains; and, where they join the plains,
these strata are all of potter's clay; as is to be seen in the valley of
Lamona where the river Lamona, as it issues from the Appenines, does
these things on its banks.

That the rivers have all cut and divided the mountains of the great Alps
one from the other. This is visible in the order of the stratified
rocks, because from the summits of the banks, down to the river the
correspondence of the strata in the rocks is visible on either side of
the river. That the stratified stones of the mountains are all layers of
clay, deposited one above the other by the various floods of the rivers.
That the

different size of the strata is caused by the difference in the
floods--that is to say greater or lesser floods.
