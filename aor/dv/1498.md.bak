*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1498.

I have found in a history of the Spaniards that in their wars with the
English Archimedes of Syracuse who at that time was living at the court
of Ecliderides, King of the Cirodastri. And in maritime warfare he
ordered that the ships should have tall masts, and that on their tops
there should be a spar fixed  <span id="fr_532"></span>[832](#fn_532.md) of
40 feet long and one third of a foot thick. At one end of this was a
small grappling iron and at the other a counterpoise; and there was also
attached 12 feet of chain; and, at the end of this chain, as much rope
as would reach from the chain to the base of the top, where it was fixed
with a small rope; from this base it ran down to the bottom of the mast
where a very strong spar was attached and to this was fastened the end
of the rope. But to go on to the use of his machine; I say that below
this grappling iron was a fire  <span id="fr_533"></span>[833](#fn_533.md)
which, with tremendous noise, threw down its rays and a shower of
burning pitch; which, pouring down on the \[enemy's\] top, compelled the
men who were in it to abandon the top to which the grappling-iron had
clung. This was hooked on to the edges of the top and then suddenly the
cord attached at the base of the top to support the cord which went from
the grappling iron, was cut, giving way and drawing in the enemy's ship;
and if the anchor--was cast ...  <span id="fr_534"></span>[834](#fn_534.md)

<span id="fn_534"></span>[451:834](1498.htm#fr_534.md) : Archimedes never
visited Spain, and the names here mentioned cannot be explained.
Leonardo seems to quote here from a book, perhaps by some questionable
mediaeval writer. Prof. C. Justi writes to me from Madrid, that Spanish
savants have no knowledge of the sources from which this story may have
been derived.
