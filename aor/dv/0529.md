### HOW THE MIRROR IS THE MASTER \[AND GUIDE\] OF PAINTERS.

When you want to see if your picture corresponds throughout with the
objects you have drawn from nature, take a mirror and look in that at
the reflection of the real things, and compare the reflected image with
your picture, and consider whether the subject of the two images duly
corresponds in both, particularly studying the mirror. You should take
the mirror for your guide--that is to say a flat mirror--because on its
surface the objects appear in many respects as in a painting. Thus you
see, in a painting done on a flat surface, objects which appear in
relief, and in the mirror--also a flat surface--they look the same. The
picture has one plane surface and the same with the mirror. The picture
is intangible, in so far as that which appears round and prominent

cannot be grasped in the hands; and it is the same with the mirror. And
since you can see that the mirror, by means of outlines, shadows and
lights, makes objects appear in relief, you, who have in your colours
far stronger lights and shades than those in the mirror, can certainly,
if you compose your picture well, make that also look like a natural
scene reflected in a large mirror.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_256"></span>[265:254](0529.htm#fr_256) : I understand the
concluding lines of this passage as follows: If you draw the upper half
a figure on a large sheet of paper laid out on the floor of a room
(*sala be piana*) to the same scale (*con le sue vere grosseze*) as the
lower half, already drawn upon the wall (lines 10, 11)you must then
reduce them on a '*pariete di rilievo*,' a curved vertical plane which
serves as a model to reproduce the form of the vault.
