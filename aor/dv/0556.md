*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 556.

### OF SHADOWS ON BODIES.

<span class="margnote"> The distribution of light and shade
(556-559)</span>When you represent the dark shadows in bodies in light
and shade, always show the cause of the shadow, and the same with
reflections; because the dark shadows are produced by dark objects and
the reflections by objects only moderately lighted, that is with
diminished light. And there is the same proportion between the highly
lighted part of a body and the part lighted by a reflection as between
the origin of the lights on the body and the origin of the reflections.
