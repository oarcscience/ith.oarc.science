The heaviest part of the foundations of buildings settles most, and
leaves the lighter part above it separated from it.
<P>
And the soil which is most pressed, if it be porous yields most.
<P>
You should always make the foundations project equally beyond the
weight of the walls and piers, as shown at <I>m a b</I>. If you do as
many do, that is to say if you make a foundation of equal width from
the bottom up to the surface of the ground, and charge

<P>it above with
unequal weights, as shown at <I>b e</I> and at <I>e o</I>, at the part of the
foundation at <I>b e</I>, the pier of the angle will weigh most and
thrust its foundation downwards, which the wall at <I>e o</I> will not
do; since it does not cover the whole of its foundation, and
therefore thrusts less heavily and settles less. Hence, the pier <I>b
e</I> in settling cracks and parts from the wall <I>e o</I>. This may be
seen in most buildings which are cracked round the piers.
