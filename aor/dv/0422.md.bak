*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 422.

### OF THE ACCIDENTS OF COLOURING IN TREES.

The accidents of colour in the foliage of trees are 4. That is: shadow,
light, lustre \[reflected light\] and transparency.

### OF THE VISIBILITY OF THESE ACCIDENTS.

These accidents of colour in the foliage of trees become confused at a
great distance and that which has most breadth \[whether light or shade,
&c\] will be most conspicuous.
