*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 298.

### WHY THE ATMOSPHERE MUST BE REPRESENTED AS PALER TOWARDS THE LOWER PORTION.

<span class="margnote"> On the relative density of the atmosphere
(298--290).</span>Because the atmosphere is dense near the earth, and
the higher it is the rarer it becomes. When the sun is in the East if
you look towards the West and a little way to the South and North, you
will see that this dense atmosphere receives more light from the sun
than the rarer; because the rays meet with greater resistance. And if
the sky, as you see it, ends on a low plain, that lowest portion of the
sky will be seen through a denser and whiter atmosphere, which will
weaken its true colour as seen through that medium, and there the sky
will look whiter than it is above you, where the line of sight travels
through a smaller space of air charged with heavy vapour. And if you
turn to the East, the atmosphere will appear darker as you look lower
down because the luminous rays pass less freely through the lower
atmosphere.
