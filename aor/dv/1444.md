### Footnotes

<span id="fn_452"></span>[433:758](1444.htm#fr_452) 1: *Pandolfino,
Agnolo*, of Florence. It is to this day doubtful whether he or L. B.
Alberti was the author of the famous work '*Del Governo della
Famiglia*'. It is the more probable that Leonardo should have meant this
work by the words *il libro*, because no other book is known to have
been written by Pandolfino. This being the case this allusion of
Leonardo's is an important evidence in favour of Pandolfino's authorship
(compare No. 1454, line 3).

<span id="fn_453"></span>[433:759](1444.htm#fr_453) 7: The works of
Lactantius were published very often in Italy during Leonardo's
lifetime. The first edition published in 1465 "*in monastero
sublacensi*" was also the first book printed in Italy.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[433:760](1444.htm#fr_454) 15: *Sansovino*,
Andrea--the *sculptor*; 1460-1529.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[433:761](1444.htm#fr_455) 25: Leonardo here
probably alludes to the map, not executed by him (See p. 224), which is
with the collection of his MSS. at Windsor, and was published in the
*Archaeologia* Vol. XI (see p. 224).
