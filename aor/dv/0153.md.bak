### 153.

<span class="margnote"> On the proportion of light and shade
(153-157).</span>That portion of an opaque body will be more in shade or
more in light, which is nearer to the dark body, by which it is shaded,
or to the light that illuminates it.

Objects seen in light and shade show in greater relief than those which
are wholly in light or in shadow.
