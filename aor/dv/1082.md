<span class="margnote"> The Danube.</span>That the valleys were formerly
in great part covered by lakes the soil of which always forms the banks
of rivers,--and by seas, which afterwards, by the persistent wearing of
the rivers, cut through the mountains and the wandering courses of the
rivers carried away the other plains enclosed by the mountains; and the
cutting away of the mountains is evident from the strata in the rocks,
which correspond in their sections as made by the courses of the rivers
 <span id="fr_264"></span>[598](#fn_264.md) , The Haemus mountains which go
along Thrace and Dardania and join the Sardonius mountains which, going
on to the westward change their name from Sardus to Rebi, as they come
near Dalmatia; then turning to the West cross Illyria, now called
Sclavonia, changing the name of Rebi to Albanus, and going on still to
the West, they change to Mount Ocra in the North; and to the South above
Istria they are named Caruancas; and to the West above Italy they join
the Adula, where the Danube rises \[8\], which stretches to the East and
has a

course of 1500 miles; its shortest line is about l000 miles, and the
same or about the same is that branch of the Adula mountains changed as
to their name, as before mentioned. To the North are the Carpathians,
closing in the breadth of the valley of the Danube, which, as I have
said extends eastward, a length of about 1000 miles, and is sometimes
200 and in some places 300 miles wide; and in the midst flows the
Danube, the principal river of Europe as to size. The said Danube runs
through the middle of Austria and Albania and northwards through
Bavaria, Poland, Hungary, Wallachia and Bosnia and then the Danube or
Donau flows into the Black Sea, which formerly extended almost to
Austria and occupied the plains through which the Danube now courses;
and the evidence of this is in the oysters and cockle shells and
scollops and bones of great fishes which are still to be found in many
places on the sides of those mountains; and this sea was formed by the
filling up of the spurs of the Adula mountains which then extended to
the East joining the spurs of the Taurus which extend to the West. And
near Bithynia the waters of this Black Sea poured into the Propontis
\[Marmora\] falling into the Aegean Sea, that is the Mediterranean,
where, after a long course, the spurs of the Adula mountains became
separated from those of the Taurus. The Black Sea sank lower and laid
bare the valley of the Danube with the above named countries, and the
whole of Asia Minor beyond the Taurus range to the North, and the plains
from mount Caucasus to the Black Sea to the West, and the plains of the
Don this side--that is to say, at the foot of the Ural mountains. And
thus the Black Sea must have sunk about 1000 braccia to uncover such
vast plains.
