### THE MOULD FOR THE HORSE.

Make the horse on legs of iron, strong and well set on a good
foundation; then grease it and cover it with a coating, leaving each
coat to dry thoroughly layer by layer; and this will thicken it by the
breadth of three fingers. Now fix and bind it with

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

iron as may be necessary. Moreover take off the mould and then make the
thickness. Then fill the mould by degrees and make it good throughout;
encircle and bind it with its irons and bake it inside where it has to
touch the bronze.

### OF MAKING THE MOULD IN PIECES.

Draw upon the horse, when finished, all the pieces of the mould with
which you wish to cover the horse, and in laying on the clay cut it in
every piece, so that when the mould is finished you can take it off, and
then recompose it in its former position with its joins, by the
countersigns.

The square blocks *a b* will be between the cover and the core, that is
in the hollow where the melted bronze is to be; and these square blocks
of bronze will support the intervals between the mould and the cover at
an equal distance, and for this reason these squares are of great
importance.

The clay should be mixed with sand.

Take wax, to return \[what is not used\] and to pay for what is used.

Dry it in layers.

Make the outside mould of plaster, to save time in drying and the
expense in wood; and with this plaster enclose the irons \[props\] both
outside and inside to a thickness of two fingers; make terra cotta. And
this mould can be made in one day; half a boat load of plaster will
serve you.

Good.

Dam it up again with glue and clay, or white of egg, and bricks and
rubbish.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[12:336](0711.htm#fr_2.md) : See [Pl.
LXXV](pl075.htm#img_pl075.md). The figure "40," close to the sketch in the
middle of the page between lines 16 and 17 has been added by a
collector's hand.

In the original, below line 21, a square piece of the page has been cut
out about 9 centimetres by 7 and a blank piece has been gummed into the
place.

Lines 22-24 are written on the margin. l. 27 and 28 are close to the
second marginal sketch. l. 42 is a note written above the third marginal
sketch and on the back of this sheet is the text given as No. 642.
Compare also No. 802.
