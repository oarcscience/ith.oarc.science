*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 996.

<span class="margnote"> On the motion of air (996--999).</span>That the
return eddies of wind at the mouth of certain valleys strike upon the
waters and scoop them out in a great hollow, whirl the water into the
air in the form of a column, and of the colour of a cloud. And I saw
this thing happen on a sand bank in the Arno, where the sand was
hollowed out to a greater depth than the stature of a man; and with it
the gravel was whirled round and flung about for a great space; it
appeared in the air in the form of a great bell-tower; and the top
spread like the branches of a pine tree, and then it bent at the contact
of the direct wind, which passed over from the mountains.
