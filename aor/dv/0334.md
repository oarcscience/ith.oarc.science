### 334.

<span class="margnote"> The relative proportions of the head and of the
torso.</span>From the roots of the hair to the top of the breast *a b*
is the sixth part of the height of a man and this measure is equal.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

From the outside part of one shoulder to the other is the same distance
as from the top of the breast to the navel and this measure goes four
times from the sole of the foot to the lower end of the nose.

The \[thickness of\] the arm where it springs from the shoulder in front
goes 6 times into the space between the two outside edges of the
shoulders and 3 times into the face, and four times into the length of
the foot and three into the hand, inside or outside.
