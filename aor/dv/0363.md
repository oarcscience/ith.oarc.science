### 363.

O Anatomical Painter! beware lest the too strong indication of the
bones, sinews and muscles, be the cause of your becoming wooden in your
painting by your wish to make your nude figures display all their
feeling. Therefore, in endeavouring to remedy this, look in what manner
the muscles clothe or cover their bones in old or lean persons; and
besides this, observe the rule as to how these same muscles fill up the
spaces of the surface that extend between them, which are the muscles
which never lose their prominence in any amount of fatness; and which
too are the muscles of which the attachments are lost to sight in the
very least plumpness. And in many cases several muscles look like one
single muscle in the increase of fat; and in many cases, in growing lean
or old, one single muscle divides into several muscles. And in this
treatise, each in its place, all their peculiarities will be
explained--and particularly as to the spaces between the joints of each
limb &c

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

Again, do not fail \[to observe\] the variations in the forms of the
above mentioned muscles, round and about the joints of the limbs of any
animal, as caused by the diversity of the motions of each limb; for on
some side of those joints the prominence of these muscles is wholly lost
in the increase or diminution of the flesh of which these muscles are
composed, &c

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_180"></span>[191:178](0363.htm#fr_180) : DE ROSSI remarks
on this chapter, in the Roman edition of the Trattato, p. 504: "*Non in
questo luogo solo, ma in altri ancora osserverà il lettore, che Lionardo
va fungendo quelli che fanno abuso della loro dottrina anatomica, e
sicuramente con ciò ha in mira il suo rivale Bonarroti, che di anatomia
facea tanta pompa*." Note, that Leonardo wrote this passage in Rome,
probably under the immediate impression of MICHAELANGELO'S paintings in
the Sistine Chapel and of RAPHAEL'S Isaiah in Sant' Agostino.
