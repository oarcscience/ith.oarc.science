### JESTS AND TALES.

### A JEST.

A priest, making the rounds of his parish on Easter Eve, and sprinkling
holy water in the houses as is customary, came to a painter's room,
where he sprinkled the water on some of his pictures. The painter turned
round, somewhat angered, and asked him why this sprinkling had been
bestowed on his pictures; then said the priest, that it was the custom
and his duty to do so, and that he was doing good; and that he who did
good might look for good in return, and, indeed, for better, since God
had promised that every good deed that was done on earth should be
rewarded a hundred-fold from above. Then the painter, waiting till he
went out, went to an upper window and flung a large pail of water on the
priest's back, saying: "Here is the reward a hundred-fold from above,
which you said would come from the good you had done me with your holy
water, by which you have damaged my pictures."
