*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 508.

### A WAY OF DEVELOPING AND AROUSING THE MIND TO VARIOUS INVENTIONS.

I cannot forbear to mention among these precepts a new device for study
which, although it may seem but trivial and almost ludicrous, is
nevertheless extremely useful in arousing the mind to various
inventions. And this is, when you look at a wall spotted with stains, or
with a mixture of stones, if you have to devise some scene, you may
discover a resemblance to various landscapes, beautified with mountains,
rivers, rocks, trees, plains, wide valleys and hills in varied
arrangement; or again you may see battles and figures in action; or
strange faces and costumes, and an endless variety of objects, which you
could reduce to complete and well drawn forms. And these appear on such
walls confusedly, like the sound of bells in whose jangle you may find
any name or word you choose to imagine.
