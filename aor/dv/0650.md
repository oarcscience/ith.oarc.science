*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 650.

### FIRE.

Take away that yellow surface which covers oranges and distill them in
an alembic, until the distillation may be said to be perfect.

### FIRE.

Close a room tightly and have a brasier of brass or iron with fire in it
and sprinkle on it two pints of aqua vitae, a little at a time, so that
it may be converted into smoke. Then make some one come in with a light
and suddenly you will see the room in a blaze like a flash of lightning,
and it will do no harm to any one.
