*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1288.

A man was arguing and boasting that he knew many and various tricks.
Another among the bystanders said: "I know how to play a trick which
will make whomsoever I like pull off his breeches." The first man-- the
boaster--said: "You won't make me pull off mine, and I bet you a pair of
hose on it." He who proposed the game, having accepted the offer,
produced breeches and drew them across the face of him who bet the pair
of hose and won the bet \[4\].

A man said to an acquaintance: "Your eyes are changed to a strange
colour." The other replied: "It often happens, but you have not noticed
it." "When does it happen?" said the former. "Every time that my eyes
see your ugly face, from the shock of so unpleasing a sight they
suddenly turn pale and change to a strange colour."

A man said to another: "Your eyes are changed to a strange colour." The
other replied: "It is because my eyes behold your strange ugly face."

A man said that in his country were the strangest things in the world.
Another answered: "You, who were born there, confirm this as true, by
the strangeness of your ugly face."

appears, on two meanings of trarre and is not easily translated.
