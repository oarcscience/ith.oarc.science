### MINT AT ROME.

<span class="margnote"> The mint of Rome.</span>It can also be made
without a spring. But the screw above must always be joined to the part
of the movable sheath: \[Margin note: The mint of Rome.\]  <span

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

All coins which do not have the rim complete, are not to be accepted as
good; and to secure the perfection of their rim it is requisite that, in
the first place, all the coins should be a perfect circle; and to do
this a coin must before all be made perfect in weight, and size, and
thickness. Therefore have several plates of metal made of the same size
and thickness, all drawn through the same gauge so as to come out in
strips. And out of \[24\] these strips you will stamp the coins, quite
round, as sieves are made for sorting chestnuts \[27\]; and these coins
can then be stamped in the way indicated above; &c

\[31\] The hollow of the die must be uniformly wider than the lower, but
imperceptibly \[35\].

This cuts the coins perfectly round and of the exact thickness, and
weight; and saves the man who cuts and weighs, and the man who makes the
coins round. Hence it passes only through the hands of the gauger and of
the stamper, and the coins are very superior.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_13"></span>[17:347](0726.htm#fr_13.md) : See [Pl.
LXXVI](pl076.htm#img_pl076.md). This passage is taken from a note book
which can be proved to have been used in Rome.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[18:348](0726.htm#fr_14.md) : See [Pl.
LXXVI](pl076.htm#img_pl076.md) No. 2. The text of lines 31-35 stands
parallel 1. 24-27.

Farther evidence of Leonardo's occupations and engagements at Rome under
Pope Leo X. may be gathered from some rough copies of letters which will
be found in this volume. Hitherto nothing has been known of his work in
Rome beyond some doubtful, and perhaps mythical, statements in Vasari.
