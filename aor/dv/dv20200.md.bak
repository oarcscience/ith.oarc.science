*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### *XV*.

### *Astronomy*.

*Ever since the publication by Venturi in* 1797 *and Libri in* 1840 *of
some few passages of Leonardo's astronomical notes, scientific
astronomers have frequently expressed the opinion, that they must have
been based on very important discoveries, and that the great painter
also deserved a conspicuous place in the history of this science. In the
passages here printed, a connected view is given of his astronomical
studies as they lie scattered through the manuscripts, which have come
down to us. Unlike his other purely scientific labours, Leonardo devotes
here a good deal of attention to the opinions of the ancients, though he
does not follow the practice universal in his day of relying on them as
authorities; he only quotes them, as we shall see, in order to refute
their arguments. His researches throughout have the stamp of independent
thought. There is nothing in these writings to lead us to suppose that
they were merely an epitome of the general learning common to the
astronomers of the period. As early as in the XIVth century there were
chairs of astronomy in the universities of Padua and Bologna, but so
late as during the entire XVIth century Astronomy and Astrology were
still closely allied.*

*It is impossible now to decide whether Leonardo, when living in
Florence, became acquainted in his youth with the doctrines of Paolo
Toscanelli the great astronomer and mathematician (died* 1482*), of
whose influence and teaching but little is now known, beyond the fact
that he advised and encouraged Columbus to carry out his project of
sailing round the world. His name is nowhere mentioned by Leonardo, and
from the dates of the manuscripts from which the texts on astronomy are
taken, it seems highly probable that Leonardo devoted his attention to
astronomical studies less in his youth than in his later years. It was
evidently his purpose to treat of Astronomy in a connected form and in a
separate work (see the beginning of Nos.* 866 *and* 892*; compare also
No.* 1167*). It is quite in accordance with his general scientific
thoroughness that he should propose to write a special treatise on
Optics as an introduction to Astronomy (see Nos.* 867 *and* 877*). Some
of the chapters belonging to this Section bear the title*

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Prospettiva"
*(see Nos.* 869 *and* 870*), this being the term universally applied at
the time to Optics as well as Perspective (see Vol. I, p.* 10, *note to
No.* 13, *l.* 10*)*.

*At the beginning of the XVIth century the Ptolemaic theory of the
universe was still universally accepted as the true one, and Leonardo
conceives of the earth as fixed, with the moon and sun revolving round
it, as they are represented in the diagram to No.* 897. *He does not go
into any theory of the motions of the planets; with regard to these and
the fixed stars he only investigates the phenomena of their luminosity.
The spherical form of the earth he takes for granted as an axiom from
the first, and he anticipates Newton by pointing out the universality of
Gravitation not merely in the earth, but even in the moon. Although his
acute research into the nature of the moon's light and the spots on the
moon did not bring to light many results of lasting importance beyond
making it evident that they were a refutation of the errors of his
contemporaries, they contain various explanations of facts which modern
science need not modify in any essential point, and discoveries which
history has hitherto assigned to a very much later date*.

*The ingenious theory by which he tries to explain the nature of what is
known as earth shine, the reflection of the sun's rays by the earth
towards the moon, saying that it is a peculiar refraction, originating
in the innumerable curved surfaces of the waves of the sea may be
regarded as absurd; but it must not be forgotten that he had no means of
detecting the fundamental error on which he based it, namely: the
assumption that the moon was at a relatively short distance from the
earth. So long as the motion of the earth round the sun remained
unknown, it was of course impossible to form any estimate of the moon's
distance from the earth by a calculation of its parallax*.

*Before the discovery of the telescope accurate astronomical
observations were only possible to a very limited extent. It would
appear however from certain passages in the notes here printed for the
first time, that Leonardo was in a position to study the spots in the
moon more closely than he could have done with the unaided eye. So far
as can be gathered from the mysterious language in which the description
of his instrument is wrapped, he made use of magnifying glasses; these
do not however seem to have been constructed like a
telescope--telescopes were first made about* 1600. *As LIBRI pointed
out* (Histoire des Sciences mathematiques III, 101) *Fracastoro of
Verona* (1473-1553) *succeeded in magnifying the moon's face by an
arrangement of lenses (compare No.* 910, *note), and this gives
probability to Leonardo's invention at a not much earlier date.*
