*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1263.

Moderation checks all the vices. The ermine will die rather than
besmirch itself.

### OF FORESIGHT.

The cock does not crow till it has thrice flapped its wings; the parrot
in moving among boughs never puts its feet excepting where it has first
put its beak. Vows are not made till Hope is dead.

Motion tends towards the centre of gravity.
