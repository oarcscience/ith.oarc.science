*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 906.

If you keep the details of the spots of the moon under observation you
will often find great variation in them, and this I myself have proved
by drawing them. And this is caused by the clouds that rise from the
waters in the moon, which come between the sun and those waters, and by
their shadow deprive these waters of the sun's rays. Thus those waters
remain dark, not being able to reflect the solar body.
