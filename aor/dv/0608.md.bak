### 608.

### OF THE DELUGE AND HOW TO REPRESENT IT IN A PICTURE.

Let the dark and gloomy air be seen buffeted by the rush of contrary
winds and

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

dense from the continued rain mingled with hail and bearing hither and
thither an infinite number of branches torn from the trees and mixed
with numberless leaves. All round may be seen venerable trees, uprooted
and stripped by the fury of the winds; and fragments of mountains,
already scoured bare by the torrents, falling into those torrents and
choking their valleys till the swollen rivers overflow and submerge the
wide lowlands and their inhabitants. Again, you might have seen on many
of the hill-tops terrified animals of different kinds, collected
together and subdued to tameness, in company with men and women who had
fled there with their children. The waters which covered the fields,
with their waves were in great part strewn with tables, bedsteads, boats
and various other contrivances made from necessity and the fear of
death, on which were men and women with their children amid sounds of
lamentation and weeping, terrified by the fury of the winds which with
their tempestuous violence rolled the waters under and over and about
the bodies of the drowned. Nor was there any object lighter than the
water which was not covered with a variety of animals which, having come
to a truce, stood together in a frightened crowd--among them wolves,
foxes, snakes and others--fleing from death. And all the waters dashing
on their shores seemed to be battling them with the blows of drowned
bodies, blows which killed those in whom any life remained \[19\]. You
might have

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

seen assemblages of men who, with weapons in their hands, defended the
small spots that remained to them against lions, wolves and beasts of
prey who sought safety there. Ah! what dreadful noises were heard in the
air rent by the fury of the thunder and the lightnings it flashed forth,
which darted from the clouds dealing ruin and striking all that opposed
its course. Ah! how many you might have seen closing their ears with
their hands to shut out the tremendous sounds made in the darkened air
by the raging of the winds mingling with the rain, the thunders of
heaven and the fury of the thunder-bolts. Others were not content with
shutting their eyes, but laid their hands one over the other to cover
them the closer that they might not see the cruel slaughter of the human
race by the wrath of God. Ah! how many laments! and how many in their
terror flung themselves from the rocks! Huge branches of great oaks
loaded with men were seen borne through the air by the impetuous fury of
the winds. How many were the boats upset, some entire, and some broken
in pieces, on the top of people labouring to escape with gestures and
actions of grief foretelling a fearful death. Others, with desperate
act, took their own lives, hopeless of being able to endure such
suffering; and of these, some flung themselves from lofty rocks, others
strangled themselves with their own hands, other seized their own
children and violently slew them at a blow; some wounded and killed
themselves with their own weapons; others, falling on their knees
recommended themselves to God. Ah! how many mothers wept over their
drowned sons, holding them upon their knees, with arms raised spread out
towards heaven and with words and various threatening gestures,
upbraiding the wrath of the gods. Others with clasped hands and fingers
clenched gnawed them and devoured them till they bled, crouching with
their breast down on their knees in their intense and unbearable
anguish. Herds of animals were to be seen, such as horses, oxen, goats
and swine already environed

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

by the waters and left isolated on the high peaks of the mountains,
huddled together, those in the middle climbing to the top and treading
on the others, and fighting fiercely themselves; and many would die for
lack of food. Already had the birds begun to settle on men and on other
animals, finding no land uncovered which was not occupied by living
beings, and already had famine, the minister of death, taken the lives
of the greater number of the animals, when the dead bodies, now
fermented, where leaving the depth of the waters and were rising to the
top. Among the buffeting waves, where they were beating one against the
other, and, like as balls full of air, rebounded from the point of
concussion, these found a resting place on the bodies of the dead. And
above these judgements, the air was seen covered with dark clouds, riven
by the forked flashes of the raging bolts of heaven, lighting up on all
sides the depth of the gloom.

The motion of the air is seen by the motion of the dust thrown up by the
horse's running and this motion is as swift in again filling up the
vacuum left in the air which enclosed the horse, as he is rapid in
passing away from the air.

Perhaps it will seem to you that you may reproach me with having
represented the currents made through the air by the motion of the wind
notwithstanding that the wind itself is not visible in the air. To this
I must answer that it is not the motion of the wind but only the motion
of the things carried along by it which is seen in the air.

### THE DIVISIONS.

 <span id="fr_284"></span>[282](#fn_284.md)

Darkness, wind, tempest at sea, floods of water, forests on fire, rain,
bolts from heaven, earthquakes and ruins of mountains, overthrow of
cities  <span id="fr_285"></span>[283](#fn_285.md) .

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

Whirlwinds which carry water \[spouts\] branches of trees, and men
through the air.

Boughs stripped off by the winds, mingling by the meeting of the winds,
with people upon them.

Broken trees loaded with people.

Ships broken to pieces, beaten on rocks.

Flocks of sheep. Hail stones, thunderbolts, whirlwinds.

People on trees which are unable to to support them; trees and rocks,
towers and hills covered with people, boats, tables, troughs, and other
means of floating. Hills covered with men, women and animals; and
lightning from the clouds illuminating every thing.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_284"></span>[309:282](0608.htm#fr_284.md) 76: These
observations, added at the bottom of the page containing the full
description of the doluge seem to indicate that it was Leonardo's
intention to elaborate the subject still farther in a separate treatise.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[309:283](0608.htm#fr_285.md) 81: *Spianamenti di
citta* (overthrow of cities). A considerable number of drawings in black
chalk, at Windsor, illustrate this catastrophe. Most of them are much
rubbed; one of the least injured is reproduced at [Pl.
XXXIX](pl039.htm#img_pl039.md). Compare also the pen and ink sketch [Pl.
XXXVI](pl036.htm#img_pl036.md).

<span id="fn_286"></span>[310:284](0608.htm#fr_286.md) : This chapter,
which, with the next one, is written on a loose sheet, seems to be the
passage to which one of the compilers of the Vatican copy alluded when
he wrote on the margin of fol. 36: "*Qua mi ricordo della mirabile
discritione del Diluuio dello autore.*" It is scarcely necessary to
point out that these chapters are among those which have never before
been published. The description in No. 607 may be regarded as a
preliminary sketch for this one. As the MS. G. (in which it is to be
found) must be attributed to the period of about 1515 we may deduce from
it the approximate date of the drawings on [Pl.
XXXIV](pl034.htm#img_pl034), [XXXV](pl035.htm#img_pl035.md), Nos. 2 and 3,
[XXXVI](pl036.htm#img_pl036) and [XXXVII](pl037.htm#img_pl037.md), since
they obviously belong to this text. The drawings No. 2 on [Pl.
XXXV](pl035.htm#img_pl035.md) are, in the original, side by side with the
text of No. 608; lines 57 to 76 are shown in the facsimile. In the
drawing in Indian ink given on [Pl. XXXIV](pl034.htm#img_pl034.md) we see
Wind-gods in the sky, corresponding to the allusion to Aeolus in No. 607
1. 15.-Plates XXXVI and [XXXVII](pl037.htm#img_pl037.md) form one sheet in
the original. The texts reproduced on these Plates have however no
connection with the sketches, excepting the sketches of clouds on the
right hand side. These texts are given as No. 477. The group of small
figures on [Pl. XXXVII](pl037.htm#img_pl037.md), to the left, seems to be
intended for a '*congregatione d'uomini.*' See No. 608, 1. 19.
