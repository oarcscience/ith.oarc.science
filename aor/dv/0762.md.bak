### THE WAY TO CONSTRUCT A FRAME-WORK FOR DECORATING BUILDINGS.

<span class="margnote"> Decorations for feasts.</span>The way in which
the poles ought to be placed for tying bunches of juniper on to them.
These poles must lie close to the framework of the vaulting and tie the
bunches on with osier withes, so as to clip them even afterwards with
shears.

Let the distance from one circle to another be half a braccia; and the
juniper \[sprigs\] must lie top downwards, beginning from below.

Round this column tie four poles to which willows about as thick as a
finger must be nailed and then begin from the bottom and work upwards
with bunches of juniper sprigs, the tops downwards, that is upside down.
