within--by the falling of the hills which served as roofs to these
caverns.

A stone flung through the air leaves on the eye which sees it the
impression of its motion, and the same effect is produced by the drops
of water which fall from the clouds when it \[16\] rains.

\[17\] A mountain falling on a town, will fling up dust in the form of
clouds; but the colour of this dust will differ from that of the clouds.
Where the rain is thickest let the colour of the dust be less
conspicuous and where the dust is thickest let the rain be less
conspicuous. And where the rain is mingled with the wind and with the
dust the clouds created by the rain must be more transparent than those
of dust \[alone\]. And when flames of fire are mingled with clouds of
smoke and water very opaque and dark clouds will be formed  <span

treated in detail in the book on painting.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_289"></span>[313:287](0610.htm#fr_289.md) 26-28: Compare [Pl.
XL](pl040.htm#img_pl040.md), 1--the drawing in Indian ink on the left hand
side, which seems to be a reminiscence of his observations of an
eruption (see his remarks on Mount Etna in Vol II).

<span id="fn_290"></span>[313:288](0610.htm#fr_290.md) : See the sketches
and text on [Pl. XXXVIII](pl038.htm#img_pl038.md), No. 1. Lines 1-16 are
there given on the left hand side, 17-30 on the right. The four lines at
the bottom on the right are given as No. 472. Above these texts, which
are written backwards, there are in the original sixteen lines in a
larger writing from left to right, but only half of this is here
visible. They treat of the physical laws of motion of air and water. It
does not seem to me that there is any reason for concluding that this
writing from left to right is spurious. Compare with it the facsimile of
the rough copy of Leonardo's letter to Ludovico il Moro in Vol. II.
