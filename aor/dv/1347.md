*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1347.

There is one whom his Lordship invited from Florence to do this work and
who is a worthy master, but with so very much business he will never

between a beautiful object and an ugly one. Quote Pliny.

Letter to the Cardinal Ippolito d' Este.
