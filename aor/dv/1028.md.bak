### 1028.

Stair of Vigevano below La Sforzesca, 130 steps, 1/4 braccio high and
1/2 braccio wide, down which the water falls, so as not to wear away
anything at the end of its fall; by these steps so much soil has come
down that it has dried up a pool; that is to say it has filled it up and
a pool of great depth has been turned into meadows.
