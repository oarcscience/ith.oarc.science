### WHY THE CURRENT OF GIBRALTAR IS ALWAYS GREATER TO THE WEST THAN TO THE EAST.

The reason is that if you put together the mouths of the rivers which
discharge into the Mediterranean sea, you would find the sum of water to
be larger than that which this sea pours through the straits into the
ocean. You see Africa discharging its rivers that run northwards into
this sea, and among them the Nile which runs through 3000 miles of
Africa; there is also the Bagrada river and the Schelif and others.
 <span id="fr_267"></span>[601](#fn_267.md) Likewise Europe pours into it
the Don and the Danube, the Po, the Rhone, the Arno, and the Tiber, so
that evidently these rivers, with an infinite number of others of less
fame, make its great breadth and depth and current; and the sea is not
wider than 18 miles at the most westerly point of land where it divides
Europe from Africa.
