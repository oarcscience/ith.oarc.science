Memorandum. That on the 8th day of
April 1503, I, Leonardo da Vinci, lent to
Vante, miniature painter 4 gold ducats, in
gold. Salai carried them to him and gave
them into his own hand, and he said he would
repay within the space of 40 days.
<P>
Memorandum. That on the same day I
paid to Salai 3 gold ducats which he said
he wanted for a pair of rose-coloured
hose with their trimming; and there remain
9 ducats due to him-excepting that he owes
me 20 ducats, that is 17 I lent him at Milan,
and 3 at Venice.
<P>
Memorandum. That I gave Salai 21 braccia
of cloth to make a shirt, at io soldi
the braccio, which I gave him on the
20th day of April 1503.

<P><A NAME="fn_546"></A><A HREF="1525.htm#fr_546">457:846</A> : With regard to Vante or Attavante, the miniature
painter (not Nanni as I formerly deciphered
this name, which is difficult to read; see </I>Zeitschrift
fur Bild. Kunst<I>, 1879, p. 155), and Vasari, Lives of Frate
Giovanni da Fiesole, of Bartolommeo della Gatta,
and of Gherardo, </I>miniatore.<I> He, like Leonardo, was
one of the committee of artists who, in 1503, considered
the erection and placing of Michel Angelo's David.
The date of his death is not known; he was of the
same age as Leonardo. Further details will be found
in '</I>Notizie di Attavante miniatore, e di alcuni suoi lavori<I>'
(Milanese's ed. of Vasari, III, 231-235).</P>
