Salt may be made from human excrements, burnt and calcined, made into
lees and dried slowly at a fire, and all the excrements produce salt in
a similar way and these salts when distilled, are very strong.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_4"></span>[13:338](0714.htm#fr_4) : VASARI repeatedly
states, in the fourth chapter of his *Introduzione della Scultura*, that
in preparing to cast bronze statues horse-dung was frequently used by
sculptors. If, notwithstanding this, it remains doubtful whether I am
justified in having introduced here this text of but little interest, no
such doubt can be attached to the sketch which accompanies it.
