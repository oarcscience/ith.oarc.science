*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 150.

<span class="margnote"> On the intensity of shadows as dependent on the
distance from the light (150-152).</span>The smaller the light that
falls upon an object the more shadow it will display. And the light will
illuminate a smaller portion of the object in proportion as it is nearer
to it; and conversely, a larger extent of it in proportion as it is
farther off.

A light which is smaller than the object on which it falls will light up
a smaller extent of it in proportion as it is nearer to it, and the
converse, as it is farther from it. But when the light is larger than
the object illuminated it will light a larger extent of the object in
proportion as it is nearer and the converse when they are farther apart.
