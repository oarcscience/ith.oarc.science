*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

### *XIX.*

### *Philosophical Maxims. Morals. Polemics and Speculations*.

*Vasari indulges in severe strictures on Leonardo's religious views. He
speaks, among other things, of his* "capricci nel filosofar delle cose
naturali" *and says on this point:* "Per il che fece nell'animo un
concetto si eretico che e' non si accostava a qualsi voglia religione,
stimando per avventura assai piu lo esser filosofo che cristiano" *(see
the first edition of* 'Le Vite'*). But this accusation on the part of a
writer in the days of the Inquisition is not a very serious one--and the
less so, since, throughout the manuscripts, we find nothing to support
it.*

*Under the heading of "Philosophical Maxims" I have collected all the
passages which can give us a clear comprehension of Leonardo's ideas of
the world at large. It is scarcely necessary to observe that there is
absolutely nothing in them to lead to the inference that he was an
atheist. His views of nature and its laws are no doubt very unlike those
of his contemporaries, and have a much closer affinity to those which
find general acceptance at the present day. On the other hand, it is
obvious from Leonardo's will (see No.* 1566*) that, in the year before
his death, he had professed to adhere to the fundamental doctrines of
the Roman Catholic faith, and this evidently from his own personal
desire and impulse.*

*The incredible and demonstrably fictitious legend of Leonardo's death
in the arms of Francis the First, is given, with others, by Vasari and
further embellished by this odious comment:* "Mostrava tuttavia quanto
avea offeso Dio e gli uomini del mondo, non avendo operato nell'arte
come si conveniva." *This last accusation, it may be remarked, is above
all evidence of the superficial character of the information which
Vasari was in a position to give about Leonardo. It seems to imply that
Leonardo was disdainful of diligent labour. With regard to the second,
referring to Leonardo's morality and dealings with his fellow men,
Vasari himself nullifies it by asserting the very contrary in several
passages. A further refutation may be found in the following sentence*

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

*from the letter in which Melsi, the young Milanese nobleman, announces
the Master's death to Leonardo's brothers:* Credo siate certificati
della morte di Maestro Lionardo fratello vostro, e mio quanto optimo
padre, per la cui morte sarebbe impossibile che io potesse esprimere il
dolore che io ho preso; e in mentre che queste mia membra si sosterranno
insieme, io possedero una perpetua infelicita, e meritamente perche
sviscerato et ardentissimo amore mi portava giornalmente. E dolto ad
ognuno la perdita di tal uomo, quale non e piu in podesta della natura,
ecc.

*It is true that, in April* 1476, *we find the names of Leonardo and
Verrocchio entered in the* "Libro degli Uffiziali di notte e de'
Monasteri" *as breaking the laws; but we immediately after find the
note* "Absoluti cum condizione ut retamburentur" (Tamburini *was the
name given to the warrant cases of the night police). The acquittal
therefore did not exclude the possibility of a repetition of the charge.
It was in fact repeated, two months later, and on this occasion the
Master and his pupil were again fully acquitted. Verrocchio was at this
time forty and Leonardo four-and-twenty. The documents referring to this
affair are in the State Archives of Florence; they have been withheld
from publication, but it seemed to me desirable to give the reader this
brief account of the leading facts of the story, as the vague hints of
it, which have recently been made public, may have given to the incident
an aspect which it had not in reality, and which it does not deserve.*

*The passages here classed under the head "Morals" reveal Leonardo to us
as a man whose life and conduct were unfailingly governed by lofty
principles and aims. He could scarcely have recorded his stern
reprobation and unmeasured contempt for men who do nothing useful and
strive only for riches, if his own life and ambitions had been such as
they have so often been misrepresented.*

*At a period like that, when superstition still exercised unlimited
dominion over the minds not merely of the illiterate crowd, but of the
cultivated and learned classes, it was very natural that Leonardo's
views as to Alchemy, Ghosts, Magicians, and the like should be met with
stern reprobation whenever and wherever he may have expressed them; this
accounts for the argumentative tone of all his utterances on such
subjects which I have collected in Subdivision III of this section. To
these I have added some passages which throw light on Leonardo's
personal views on the Universe. They are, without exception,
characterised by a broad spirit of naturalism of which the principles
are more strictly applied in his essays on Astronomy, and still more on
Physical Geography.*

*To avoid repetition, only such notes on Philosophy, Morals and
Polemics, have been included in this section as occur as independent
texts in the original MSS. Several moral reflections have already been
given in Vol. I, in section "Allegorical representations, Mottoes and
Emblems". Others will be found in the following section. Nos.* 9 *to*
12, *Vol. I, are also passages of an argumentative character. It did not
seem requisite to repeat here these and similar passages, since their
direct connection with the context is far closer in places where they
have appeared already, than it would be here.*
