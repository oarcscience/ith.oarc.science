### OF THE ORIGIN OF RIVERS.

<span class="margnote"> On the way in which the sources of rivers are
fed.</span>The body of the earth, like the bodies of animals, is
intersected with ramifications of waters which are all in connection and
are constituted to give nutriment and life to the earth and to its
creatures. These come from the depth of the sea and, after many
revolutions, have to return to it by the rivers created by the bursting
of these springs; and if you chose to say that the rains of the winter
or the melting of the snows in summer were the cause of the birth of
rivers, I could mention the rivers which originate in the torrid
countries of Africa, where it never rains--and still less snows--because
the intense heat always melts into air all the clouds which are borne
thither by the winds. And if you chose to say that such rivers, as
increase in July and August, come from the snows which melt in May and
June from the sun's approach to the snows on the mountains of Scythia
 <span id="fr_178"></span>[512](#fn_178.md) , and that such meltings come
down into certain valleys and form lakes, into which they enter by
springs and subterranean

caves to issue forth again at the sources of the Nile, this is false;
because Scythia is lower than the sources of the Nile, and, besides,
Scythia is only 400 miles from the Black sea and the sources of the Nile
are 3000 miles distant from the sea of Egypt into which its waters flow.

here, as in Ancient Geography, the whole of the Northern part of Asia as
far as India.
