### Footnotes

have to express my regret for having misread this word, written *cinato*
in the original, and having altered it to *"ciclo"* when I first
published this text, in 'The Academy' for Nov. 8, 1879 immediately after

actions which are given to the group of disciples on the left hand of
Christ.
