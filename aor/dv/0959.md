### 959.

That the flow and ebb are not general; for on the shore at Genoa there
is none, at Venice two braccia, between England and Flanders 18 braccia.
That in the straits of Sicily the current is very strong because all the
waters from the rivers that flow into the Adriatic pass there.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_171"></span>[194:505](0959.htm#fr_171.md) : A few more recent
data may be given here to facilitate comparison. In the Adriatic the
tide rises 2 and 1/2 feet, at Terracina 1 1/4. In the English channel
between Calais and Kent it rises from 18 to 20 feet. In the straits of
Messina it rises no more than 2 1/2 feet, and that only in stormy
weather, but the current is all the stronger. When Leonardo accounts for
this by the southward flow of all the Italian rivers along the coasts,
the explanation is at least based on a correct observation; namely that
a steady current flows southwards along the coast of Calabria and
another northwards, along the shores of Sicily; he seems to infer, from
the direction of the fust, that the tide in the Adriatic is caused by
it.
