### 374.

### OF DRAWING.

When a man who is running wants to neutralise the impetus that carries
him on he prepares a contrary impetus which is generated by his hanging
backwards. This can be proved, since, if the impetus carries a moving
body with a momentum equal to 4 and the moving body wants to turn and
fall back with a momentum of 4, then one momentum neutralises the other
contrary one, and the impetus is neutralised.
