Just so much as the part *d a* of the nude figure decreases in this
position so much does the opposite part increase; that is: in proportion
as the length of the part *d a* diminishes the normal size so does the
opposite upper part increase beyond its \[normal\] size. The navel does
not change its position to the male organ; and this shrinking arises
because when a figure stands on one foot, that foot becomes the centre
\[of gravity\] of the superimposed weight. This being so, the middle
between the shoulders is thrust above it out of it perpendicular line,
and this line, which forms the central line of the external parts of the
body, becomes bent at its upper extremity \[so as to be\] above the foot
which supports the body; and the transverse lines are forced into such
angles that their ends are lower on the side which is supported. As is
shown at *a b c*.
