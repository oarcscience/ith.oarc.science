<P>
<I>Linear Perspective cannot be immediately followed by either the</I>
"prospettiva de' perdimenti" <I>or the</I> "prospettiva de' colori" <I>or
the aerial perspective; since these branches of the subject
presuppose a knowledge of the principles of Light and Shade. No
apology, therefore, is here needed for placing these immediately
after Linear Perspective.</I>
<P>
<I>We have various plans suggested by Leonardo for the arrangement of
the mass of materials treating of this subject. Among these I have
given the preference to a scheme propounded in No.</I> III, <I>because,
in all probability, we have here a final and definite purpose
expressed. Several authors have expressed it as their opinion that
the Paris Manuscript</I> C <I>is a complete and finished treatise on
Light and Shade. Certainly, the Principles of Light and Shade form
by far the larger portion of this MS. which consists of two separate
parts; still, the materials are far from being finally arranged. It
is also evident that he here investigates the subject from the point
of view of the Physicist rather than from that of the Painter.</I>
<P>
<I>The plan of a scheme of arrangement suggested in No.</I> III <I>and
adopted by me has been strictly adhered to for the first four Books.
For the three last, however, few materials have come down to us; and
it must be admitted that these three Books would find a far more
appropriate place in a work on Physics than in a treatise on
Painting. For this reason I have collected in Book V all the
chapters on Reflections, and in Book VI I have put together and
arranged all the sections of MS.</I> C <I>that belong to the book on
Painting, so far as they relate to Light and Shade, while the
sections of the same MS. which treat of the</I> "Prospettiva de'
perdimenti" <I>have, of course, been excluded from the series on Light
and Shade.</I>

variations in Dozio's pamphlet <I>Degli scritti e disegni di Leonardo
da Vinci</I>, Milan 1871, pp. 30--31. Dozio did not transcribe it from
the original MS. which seems to have remained unknown to him, but
from an old copy (MS. H. 227 in the Ambrosian Library).</P>
