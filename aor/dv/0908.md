### 908.

### OF HALOS ROUND THE MOON.

<span class="margnote"> On the moon's halo.</span>I have found, that the
circles which at night seem to surround the moon, of various sizes, and
degrees of density are caused by various gradations in the densities of
the vapours which exist at different altitudes between the moon and our
eyes. And of these halos the largest and least red is caused by the
lowest of these vapours; the second, smaller one, is higher up, and
looks redder because it is

seen through two vapours. And so on, as they are higher they will appear
smaller and redder, because, between the eye and them, there is thicker
vapour. Whence it is proved that where they are seen to be reddest, the
vapours are most dense.
