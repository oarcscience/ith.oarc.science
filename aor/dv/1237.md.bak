*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1237.

### THE ALEPO, A FISH.

The fish *alepo* does not live out of water.

### THE OSTRICH.

This bird converts iron into nourishment, and hatches its eggs by its
gaze;--Armies under commanders.

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

### THE SWAN.

The swan is white without any spot, and it sings sweetly as it dies, its
life ending with that song.

### THE STORK.

This bird, by drinking saltwater purges itself of distempers. If the
male finds his mate unfaithful, he abandons her; and when it grows old
its young ones brood over it, and feed it till it dies.
