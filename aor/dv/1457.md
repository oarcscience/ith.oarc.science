### Footnotes

<span id="fn_480"></span>[438:786](1457.htm#fr_480.md) : This note occurs
on a pen and ink drawing made by Leonardo as a sketch for the celebrated
large cartoon in the possession of the Royal Academy of Arts, in London.
This cartoon is commonly supposed to be identical with that described
and lauded by Vasari, which was exhibited in Florence at the time and
which now seems to be lost. Mr. Alfred Marks, of Long Ditton, in his
valuable paper (read before the Royal Soc. of Literature, June 28, 1882)
"On the St. Anne of Leonardo da Vinci", has adduced proof that the
cartoon now in the Royal Academy was executed earlier at Milan. The note
here given, which is written on the sheet containing the study for the
said cartoon, has evidently no reference to the drawing on which it is
written but is obviously of the same date. Though I have not any opening
here for discussing this question of the cartoon, it seemed to me
important to point out that the character of the writing in this note
does not confirm the opinion hitherto held that the Royal Academy
cartoon was the one described by Vasari, but, on the contrary, supports
the hypothesis put forward by Mr. Marks.
