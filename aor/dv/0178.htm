It can be proved why the shadow <I>o p c h</I> is darker in proportion as
it is nearer to the line <I>p h</I> and is lighter in proportion as it is
nearer to the line <I>o c</I>. Let the light <I>a b</I>, be a window, and let
the dark wall in which this window is, be <I>b s</I>, that is, one of the
sides of the wall.
<P>
Then we may say that the line <I>p h</I> is darker than any other part of
the space <I>o p c h</I>, because this line faces the whole surface in
shadow of &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">81</FONT></A>

<P>the wall <I>b s</I>. The line <I>o c</I> is lighter than the
other part of this space <I>o p c h</I>, because this line faces the
luminous space <I>a b</I>.

Where the shadow is larger, or smaller, or equal the body which
casts it.

<P>
The shadow <I>f r c h</I> is under such conditions as that where it is
farthest from its inner side it loses depth in proportion. To prove
this:
<P>
Let <I>d a</I>, be the light and <I>f n</I> the solid body, and let <I>a e</I> be
one of the side walls of the window that is <I>d a</I>. Then I
say--according to the 2nd [proposition]: that the surface of any
body is affected by the tone of the objects surrounding it,--that
the side <I>r c</I>, which faces the dark wall <I>a e</I> must participate of
its darkness and, in the same way that the outer surface which faces
the light <I>d a</I> participates of the light; thus we get the outlines
of the extremes on each side of the centre included between them.]
<P>
This is divided into four parts. The first the extremes, which
include the compound shadow, secondly the compound shadow between
these extremes.
