*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1251.

### THE BISON WHICH DOES INJURY IN ITS FLIGHT.

This beast is a native of Paeonia and has a neck with a mane like a
horse. In all its other parts it is like a bull, excepting that its
horns are in a way bent inwards so that it cannot butt; hence it has no
safety but in flight, in which it flings out its excrement to a distance
of 400 braccia in its course, and this burns like fire wherever it
touches.

### LIONS, PARDS, PANTHERS, TIGERS.

These keep their claws in the sheath, and never put them out unless they
are on the back of their prey or their enemy.

### THE LIONESS.

When the lioness defends her young from the hand of the hunter, in order
not to be frightened by the spears she keeps her eyes on the ground, to
the end that she may not by her flight leave her young ones prisoners.
