Benedetto de' Pertarti. When the proud giant fell because of the bloody
and miry state of the ground it was as though a mountain had fallen so
that the country shook as with an earthquake, and terror fell on Pluto
in hell. From the violence of the shock he lay as stunned on the level
ground. Suddenly the people, seeing him as one killed by a thunderbolt,
turned back; like ants running wildly over the body of the fallen oak,
so these rushing over his ample limbs.......... them with

frequent wounds; by which, the giant being roused and feeling himself
almost covered by the multitude, he suddenly perceives the smarting of
the stabs, and sent forth a roar which sounded like a terrific clap of
thunder; and placing his hands on the ground he raised his terrible
face: and having lifted one hand to his head he found it full of men and
rabble sticking to it like the minute creatures which not unfrequently
are found there; wherefore with a shake of his head he sends the men
flying through the air just as hail does when driven by the fury of the
winds. Many of these men were found to be dead; stamping with his feet.

And clinging to his hair, and striving to hide in it, they behaved like
sailors in a storm, who run up the ropes to lessen the force of the wind
\[by taking in sail\].

News of things from the East.

Be it known to you that in the month of June there appeared a Giant, who
came from the Lybian desert... mad with rage like ants.... struck down
by the rude.

This great Giant was born in Mount Atlas and was a hero ... and had to
fight against the Egyptians and Arabs, Medes and Persians. He lived in
the sea on whales, grampuses and ships.

Mars fearing for his life took refuge under the... of Jove.

And at the great fall it seemed as though the whole province quaked.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_381"></span>[410:687](1354.htm#fr_381.md) : 1354. A puzzling
passage, meant, as it would seem, for a jest. Compare the description of
Giants in Dante, *Inf*. XXI and XXII. Perhaps Leonardo had the Giant
Antaeus in his mind. Of him the myth relates that he was a son of Ge,
that he fed on lions; that he hunted in Libya and killed the
inhabitants. He enjoyed the peculiarity of renewing his strength
whenever he fell and came in contact with his mother earth; but that
Hercules lifted him up and so conquered and strangled him. Lucan gives a
full account of the struggle. Pharsalia IV, 617. The reading of this
passage, which is very indistinctly written, is in many places doubtful.
