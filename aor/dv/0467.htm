<P>
Of buildings seen at a great distance in the evening or the morning,
as in mist or dense atmosphere, only those portions are seen in
brightness which are lighted up by the sun which is near the
horizon; and those portions which are not lighted up by the sun
remain almost of the same colour and medium tone as the mist.

<P>
Of objects standing in a mist or other dense atmosphere, whether
from vapour or smoke or distance, those will be most visible which
are the highest. And among objects of equal height that will be the
darkest [strongest] which has for background the deepest mist. Thus
the eye <I>h</I> looking at <I>a b c</I>, towers of equal height, one with
another, sees <I>c</I> the top of the first tower at <I>r</I>, at two degrees
of depth in the mist; and sees the height of the middle tower <I>b</I>
through one single degree of mist. Therefore the top of the tower
<I>c</I> appears stronger than the top of the tower <I>b</I>, &amp;c
