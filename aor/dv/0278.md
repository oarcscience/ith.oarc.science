### OF PAINTING.

 <span id="fr_126"></span>[124](#fn_126.md) Since white is not a colour but
the neutral recipient of every colour  <span
id="fr_127"></span>[125](#fn_127.md) , when it is seen in the open air and
high up, all its shadows are bluish; and this is caused, according to
the 4th \[prop.\], which says: the surface of every opaque body assumes
the hue of the surrounding objects. Now this white \[body\] being
deprived of the light of the sun by the interposition of some body
between the sun and itself, all that portion of it which is exposed to
the sun and atmosphere assumes the colour of the sun and atmosphere; the
side on which the sun does not fall remains in shadow and assumes the
hue of the atmosphere. And if this white object did not reflect the
green of the fields all the way to the horizon nor get the brightness of
the horizon itself, it would certainly appear simply of the same hue as
the atmosphere.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_126"></span>[149:124](0278.htm#fr_126.md) 2: See Footnote 3

<span id="fn_127"></span>[149:125](0278.htm#fr_127.md) 3: *il bianco non e
colore ma e inpotentia ricettiva d'ogni colore* (white is not a colour,
but the neutral recipient of every colour). LEON BATT. ALBERTI "*Della
pittura*" libro I, asserts on the contrary: "*Il bianco e'l nero non
sono veri colori, ma sono alteratione delli altri colori*" (ed.
JANITSCHEK, p. 67; Vienna 1877).
