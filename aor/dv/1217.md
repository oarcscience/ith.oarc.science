*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1217.

### EXAMPLE OF THE LIGHTNING IN CLOUDS.

<span class="margnote"> Reflections on Nature (1217-1219).</span>\[O
mighty and once living instrument of formative nature. Incapable of
availing thyself of thy vast strength thou hast to abandon a life of
stillness and to obey the law which God and time gave to procreative
nature.\]

Ah! how many a time the shoals of terrified dolphins and the huge
tunny-fish were seen to flee before thy cruel fury, to escape; whilst
thy fulminations raised in the sea a sudden tempest with buffeting and
submersion of ships in the great waves; and filling the uncovered shores
with the terrified and desperate fishes which fled from thee, and left
by the sea, remained in spots where they became the abundant prey of the
people in the neighbourhood.

O time, swift robber of all created things, how many kings, how many
nations hast thou undone, and how many changes of states and of various
events have happened since the wondrous forms of this fish perished here
in this cavernous and winding recess. Now destroyed by time thou liest
patiently in this confined space with bones stripped and bare; serving
as a support and prop for the superimposed mountain.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_314"></span>[309:648](1217.htm#fr_314.md) : The character of
the handwriting points to an early period of Leonardo's life. It has
become very indistinct, and is at present exceedingly difficult to
decipher. Some passages remain doubtful.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[310:649](1217.htm#fr_315.md) : Compare No. 1339,
written on the same sheet.
