Why an impetus is not spent at once [but diminishes] gradually in
some one direction? &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">193</FONT></A>
 The impetus acquired in the line <I>a b c d</I> is spent
in the line <I>d e</I> but not so completely but that some of its force
remains in it and to this force is added the momentum in the line <I>d
e</I> with the force of the motive power, and it must follow than the
impetus multiplied by the blow is greater that the simple impetus
produced by the momentum <I>d e</I>.
<P>
&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">194</FONT></A>
 A man
who has to deal a great blow with his weapon prepares himself with
all his force on the opposite side to that where the spot is which
he is to hit; and this is because a body as it gains in velocity
gains in force against the object which impedes its motion.
