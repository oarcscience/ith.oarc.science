<P>
Feathers will raise men, as they do birds, towards heaven (that is,
by the letters which are written with quills.)
<P>
The works of men's hands will occasion their death. (Swords and
Spears.)
<P>
Men out of fear will cling to the thing they most fear. (That is
they will be miserable lest they should fall into misery.)
<P>
Things that are separate shall be united and acquire such virtue
that they will restore to man his lost memory; that is papyrus
[sheets] which are made of separate strips and have preserved the
memory of the things and acts of men.
<P>
The bones of the Dead will be seen to govern the fortunes of him who
moves them. (By Dice.)
<P>
Cattle with their horns protect the Flame from its death. (In a
Lantern &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_329"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">663</FONT></A>
.)
<P>
The Forests will bring forth young which will be the cause of their
death. (The handle of the hatchet.)
