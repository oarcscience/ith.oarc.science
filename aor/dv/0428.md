*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 428.

When one green has another \[green\] behind it, the lustre on the leaves
and their transparent \[lights\] show more strongly than in those which
are \[seen\] against the brightness of the atmosphere.

And if the sun illuminates the leaves without their coming between it
and the eye and without the eye facing the sun, then the reflected
lights and the transparent lights are very strong.

It is very effective to show some branches which are low down and dark
and so set off the illuminated greens which are at some distance from
the dark greens seen below. That part is darkest which is nearest to the
eye or which is farthest from the luminous atmosphere.
