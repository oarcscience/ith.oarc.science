*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1352.

I was so greatly rejoiced, most Illustrious Lord, by the wished for
recovery of your health, that my own ills have almost left me; and I say
God be praised for it. But it vexes me greatly that I have not been able
completely to satisfy your Excellency's wishes by reason of the
wickedness of that German deceiver, for whom I left nothing undone by
which I could hope to please him; and secondly I invited him to lodge
and board with me, by which means I should see constantly the work he
was doing,

for which purpose I would have a table fixed at the foot of one of these
windows, where he could work with the file and finish the things made
below; and so I should constantly see the work he might do, and it could
be corrected with greater ease.
