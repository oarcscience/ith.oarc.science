*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 575.

### THE PROOF AND REASON WHY AMONG THE ILLUMINATED PARTS CERTAIN PORTIONS ARE IN HIGHER LIGHT THAN OTHERS.

Since it is proved that every definite light is, or seems to be, derived
from one single

point the side illuminated by it will have its highest light on the
portion where the line of radiance falls perpendicularly; as is shown
above in the lines *a g*, and also in *a h* and in *l a*; and that
portion of the illuminated side will be least luminous, where the line
of incidence strikes it between two more dissimilar angles, as is seen
at *b c d*. And by this means you may also know which parts are deprived
of light as is seen at *m k*.

Where the angles made by the lines of incidence are most equal there
will be the highest light, and where they are most unequal it will be
darkest.

I will make further mention of the reason of reflections.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_270"></span>[290:268](0575.htm#fr_270) : See [Pl.
XXXII](pl032.htm#img_pl032). The text, here given complete, is on the
right hand side. The small circles above the beginning of lines 5 and 11
as well as the circle above the text on [Pl. XXXI](pl031.htm#img_pl031),
are in a paler ink and evidently added by a later hand in order to
distinguish the text as belonging to the *Libro di Pittura* (see
Prolegomena. No. 12, p. 3). The text on the left hand side of this page
is given as Nos. 577 and 137.
