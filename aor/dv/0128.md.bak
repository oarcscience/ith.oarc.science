### 128.

<span class="margnote"> General remarks (128. 129).</span>Light is the
chaser away of darkness. Shade is the obstruction of light. Primary
light is that which falls on objects and causes light and shade. And
derived lights are those portions of a body which are illuminated by the
primary light. A primary shadow is that side of a body on which the
light cannot fall.

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

The general distribution of shadow and light is that sum total of the
rays thrown off by a shaded or illuminated body passing through the air
without any interference and the spot which intercepts and cuts off the
distribution of the dark and light rays.

And the eye can best distinguish the forms of objects when it is placed
between the shaded and the illuminated parts.
