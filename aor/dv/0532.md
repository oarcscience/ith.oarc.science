*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 532.

### THAT A PAINTER OUGHT TO BE CURIOUS TO HEAR THE OPINIONS OF EVERY ONE ON HIS WORK.

Certainly while a man is painting he ought not to shrink from hearing
every opinion. For we know very well that a man, though he may not be a
painter, is familiar with the forms of other men and very capable of
judging whether they are hump backed, or have one shoulder higher or
lower than the other, or too big a mouth or nose, and other defects;
and, as we know that men are competent to judge of the works of nature,
how much more ought we to admit that they can judge of our errors; since
you know how much a man may be deceived in his own work. And if you are
not conscious of this in yourself study it in others and profit by their
faults. Therefore be curious to hear with patience the opinions of
others, consider and weigh well whether those who find fault have ground
or not for blame, and, if so amend; but, if not make as though you had
not heard, or if he should be a man you esteem show him by argument the
cause of his mistake.
