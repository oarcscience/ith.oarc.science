*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 386.

When two men are at the opposite ends of a plank that is balanced, and
if they are of equal weight, and if one of them wants to make a leap
into the air, then his leap will be made down from his end of the plank
and the man will never go up again but must remain in his place till the
man at the other end dashes up the board.
