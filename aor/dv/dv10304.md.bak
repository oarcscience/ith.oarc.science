### *V.*

### *Theory of colours.*

*Leonardo's theory of colours is even more intimately connected with his
principles of light and shade than his Perspective of Disappearance and
is in fact merely an appendix or supplement to those principles, as we
gather from the titles to sections* 264, 267*, and* 276*, while others
again* (*Nos.* 281, 282*) are headed* Prospettiva.

*A very few of these chapters are to be found in the oldest copies and
editions of the Treatise on Painting, and although the material they
afford is but meager and the connection between them but slight, we must
still attribute to them a special theoretical value as well as practical
utility--all the more so because our knowledge of the theory and use of
colours at the time of the Renaissance is still extremely limited.*
