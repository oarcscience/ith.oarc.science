### Footnotes

<span id="fn_490"></span>[441:796](1466.htm#fr_490.md) : 4. *Lorenzo*. See
No. 1351, l. 10 (p. 408). Amoretti gives the following note in *Mem.
Stor. XXIII:* 1505. *Martedi-sera a di 14 d'aprile. Venne Lorenzo a
stare con mecho: disse essere d'eta d'anni 17 .. a di 15 del detto
aprile ebbi scudi 25 d'oro dal chamerlingo di Santa Maria nuova.* This,
he asserts is derived from a MS. marked S, in quarto. This MS. seems to
have vanished and left no trace behind; Amoretti himself had not seen
it, but copied from a selection of extracts made by Oltrocchi before the
Leonardo MSS. were conveyed to Paris on the responsibility of the first
French Republic. Lorenzo, by this, must have been born in 1487. The
sculptor Lorenzetto was born in 1490. Amoretti has been led by the above
passage to make the following absurd observations:

*Cotesto Lorenzo, che poi gli fu sempre compagno, almeno sin che stette
in Italia, sarebb' egli Lorenzo Lotto bergamasco? Sappiamo essere stato
questo valente dipintore uno de' bravi scolari del Vinci* (?).

*Il Fafoia*, perhaps a nickname. Cesare da Sesto, Leonardo's pupil,
seems to have been in Rome in these years, as we learn from a drawing by
him in the Louvre.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[441:797](1466.htm#fr_491.md) : 1466. This seems
to be an account for two assistants. The name of the second is scarcely
legible. The year is not given. The note is nevertheless of
chronological value. The first line tells us the date when the note was
registered, January 3d, and the observations that follow refer to events
of the previous month 'of last year' (dell' anno passato). Leonardo
cannot therefore have written thus in Florence where the year was, at
that period, calculated as beginning in the month of March (see Vol. I,
No. 4, note 2). He must then have been in Milan. What is more important
is that we thus learn how to date the beginning of the year in all the
notes written at Milan. This clears up Uzielli's doubts: A Milano
facevasi cominciar l'anno ab incarnatione, cioe il 25 Marzo e a
nativitate, cioe il 25 Decembre. Ci sembra probabile che Leonardo
dovesse prescegliere lo stile che era in uso a Firenze. (Ricerche, p.
84, note.)
