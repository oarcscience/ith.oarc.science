*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 29.

Let the object in relief *t* be seen by both eyes; if you will look at
the object with the right eye *m*, keeping the left eye *n* shut, the
object will appear, or fill up the space, at *a*; and if you shut the
right eye and open the left, the object (will occupy the) space *b*; and
if you open both eyes, the object will no longer appear at *a* or *b*,
but at *e*, *r*, *f*. Why will not a picture seen by both eyes produce
the effect of relief, as \[real\] relief does when seen by both eyes;
and why should a picture seen with one eye give the same effect of
relief as real relief would under the same conditions of light and
shade?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_23"></span>[21:21](0029.htm#fr_23) : In the sketch, *m* is
the left eye and *n* the right, while the text reverses this lettering.
We must therefore suppose that the face in which the eyes *m* and *n*
are placed is opposite to the spectator.
