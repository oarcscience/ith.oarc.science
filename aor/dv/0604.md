### OF THE WAY TO REPRESENT A NIGHT \[SCENE\].

<span class="margnote"> Of depicting night scenes.</span>That which is
entirely bereft of light is all darkness; given a night under these
conditions and that you want to represent a night scene,--arrange that
there shall be a great fire, then the objects which are nearest to this
fire will be most tinged with its colour; for those objects which are
nearest to a coloured light participate most in its nature; as therefore
you give the fire a red colour, you must make all the objects
illuminated by it ruddy; while those which are farther from the fire are
more tinted by the black hue of night. The figures which are seen
against the fire look dark in the glare of the firelight because that
side of the objects which you see is tinged by the darkness of the night
and not by the fire; and those who stand at the side are half dark and
half red; while those who are visible beyond the edges of the flame will
be fully lighted by the ruddy glow against a black background. As to
their gestures, make those which are near it screen themselves with
their hands and cloaks as a

defence against the intense heat, and with their faces turned away as if
about to retire. Of those farther off represent several as raising their
hands to screen their eyes, hurt by the intolerable glare.
