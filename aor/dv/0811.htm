Which is the part in man, which, as he grows fatter, never gains
flesh?
<P>
Or what part which as a man grows lean never falls away with a too
perceptible diminution? And among the parts which grow fat which is
that which grows fattest?
<P><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></P>
<P><P>
Among those which grow lean which is that which grows leanest?
<P>
In very strong men which are the muscles which are thickest and most
prominent?
<P>
In your anatomy you must represent all the stages of the limbs from
man's creation to his death, and then till the death of the bone;
and which part of him is first decayed and which is preserved the
longest.
<P>
And in the same way of extreme leanness and extreme fatness.
