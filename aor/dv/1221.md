*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1221.

### ENVY.

We read of the kite that, when it sees its young ones growing too big in
the nest, out of envy it pecks their sides, and keeps them without food.

### CHEERFULNESS.

Cheerfulness is proper to the cock, which rejoices over every little
thing, and crows with varied and lively movements.

### SADNESS.

Sadness resembles the raven, which, when it sees its young ones born
white, departs in great grief, and abandons them with doleful
lamentations, and does not feed them until it sees in them some few
black feathers.
