*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 332.

<span class="margnote"> On the central point of the whole body.</span>In
kneeling down a man will lose the fourth part of his height.

When a man kneels down with his hands folded on his breast the navel
will mark half his height and likewise the points of the elbows.

Half the height of a man who sits--that is from the seat to the top of
the head--will be where the arms fold below the breast, and below the
shoulders. The seated portion--that is from the seat to the top of the
head--will be more than half the man's \[whole height\] by the length of
the scrotum.
