*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 316.

From *a* to *b*--that is to say from the roots of the hair in front to
the top of the head--ought to be equal to *c* *d*;--that is from the
bottom of the nose to the meeting of the lips in the middle of the
mouth. From the inner corner of the eye *m* to the top of the head *a*
is as far as from *m* down to the chin *s*. *s* *c* *f* *b* are all at
equal distances from each other.
