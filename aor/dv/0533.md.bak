### HOW IN SMALL OBJECTS ERRORS ARE LESS EVIDENT THAN IN LARGE ONES.

<span class="margnote"> On the limitations of painting
(533-535)</span>In objects of minute size the extent of error is not so
perceptible as in large ones; and the reason is that if this small
object is a representation of a man or of some other animal, from the
immense diminution the details cannot be worked out by the artist with
the finish that is requisite. Hence it is not actually complete; and,
not being complete, its faults cannot be determined. For instance: Look
at a man at a distance of 300 braccia and judge attentively whether he
be handsome or ugly, or very remarkable or of ordinary appearance. You
will find that with the utmost effort you cannot persuade yourself to
decide. And the reason is that at such a distance the man is so much
diminished that the character of the details cannot be determined. And
if you wish to see how much this man is diminished \[by distance\] hold
one of your fingers at a span's distance from your eye, and raise or
lower it till the top joint touches the feet of the figure you are
looking at, and you will see an incredible reduction. For this reason we
often doubt as to the person of a friend at a distance.
