### 607.

### TO REPRESENT THE DELUGE.

<span class="margnote"> Of representing the deluge (607-609).</span>The
air was darkened by the heavy rain whose oblique descent driven aslant
by the rush of the winds, flew in drifts through the air not otherwise
than as we see dust, varied only by the straight lines of the heavy
drops of falling water. But it was tinged with the colour of the fire
kindled by the thunder-bolts by which the clouds were rent and
shattered; and whose flashes revealed the broad waters of the inundated
valleys, above which was seen the verdure of the bending tree tops.
Neptune will be seen in the midst of the water with his trident, and
\[15\] let AEolus with his winds be shown entangling the trees floating
uprooted, and whirling in the huge waves. The horizon and the whole
hemisphere were obscure, but lurid from the flashes of the incessant
lightning. Men and birds might be seen crowded on the tall trees which
remained uncovered by the swelling waters, originators of the mountains
which surround the great abysses  <span
