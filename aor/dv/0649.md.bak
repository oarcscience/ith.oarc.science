### FIRE.

If you want to make a fire which will set a hall in a blaze without
injury do this: first perfume the hall with a dense smoke of incense or
some other odoriferous substance: It is a good trick to play. Or boil
ten pounds of brandy to evaporate, but see that the hall is completely
closed and throw up some powdered varnish among the fumes and this
powder will be supported by the smoke; then go into the room suddenly
with a lighted torch and at once it will be in a blaze.
