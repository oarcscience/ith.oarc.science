*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 951.

### HERE THE REASON IS GIVEN OF THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE WATERS IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED PLACE.

All the lakes and all the gulfs of the sea and all inland seas are due
to rivers which distribute their waters into them, and from impediments
in their downfall into the Mediterranean --which divides Africa from
Europe and Europe from Asia by means of the Nile and the Don which pour
their waters into it. It is asked what impediment is great enough to
stop the course of the waters which do not reach the ocean.
