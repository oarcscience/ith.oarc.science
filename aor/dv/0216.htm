That part of the surface of a body on which the images [reflection]
from other bodies placed opposite fall at the largest angle will
assume their hue most strongly. In the diagram below, 8 is a larger
angle than 4, since its base <I>a n</I> is larger than <I>e n</I> the base of
4. This diagram below should end at <I>a n</I> 4 8. [4]That portion of the
<P><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></P>
<P>illuminated surface on which a shadow is cast will be brightest
which lies contiguous to the cast shadow. Just as an object which is
lighted up by a greater quantity of luminous rays becomes brighter,
so one on which a greater quantity of shadow falls, will be darker.
<P>
Let 4 be the side of an illuminated surface 4 8, surrounding the
cast shadow <I>g e</I> 4. And this spot 4 will be lighter than 8, because
less shadow falls on it than on 8. Since 4 faces only the shadow <I>i
n</I>; and 8 faces and receives the shadow <I>a e</I> as well as <I>i n</I> which
makes it twice as dark. And the same thing happens when you put the
atmosphere and the sun in the place of shade and light.

<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"> On relative proportion of light and shadows (216--221).</FONT></span>[12] The distribution of shadow, originating in, and limited by,
plane surfaces placed near to each other, equal in tone and directly
opposite, will be darker at the ends than at the beginning, which
will be determined by the incidence of the luminous rays. You will
find the same proportion in the depth of the derived shadows <I>a n</I>
as in the nearness of the luminous bodies <I>m b</I>, which cause them;
and if the luminous bodies were of equal size you would still
farther find the same proportion in the light cast by the luminous
circles and their shadows as in the distance of the said luminous
bodies.
