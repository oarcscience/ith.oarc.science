*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1232.

### INCONTINENCE.

The unicorn, through its intemperance and not knowing how to control
itself, for the love it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity and
wildness; and laying aside all fear it will go up to a seated damsel and
go to sleep in her lap, and thus the hunters take it.

### HUMILITY.

We see the most striking example of humility in the lamb which will
submit to any animal; and when they are given for food to imprisoned
lions they are as gentle to them as to their own mother, so that very
often it has been seen that the lions forbear to kill them.
