*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1064.

And of these I found some in the rocks of the high Appenines and mostly

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_247"></span>[247:581](1064.htm#fr_247.md) 6: *Sasso della
Vernia.* The frowning rock between the sources of the Arno and the
Tiber, as Dante describes this mountain, which is 1269 metres in height.

This note is written by the side of that given as No. 1020; but their
connection does not make it clear what Leonardo's purpose was in writing
it.
