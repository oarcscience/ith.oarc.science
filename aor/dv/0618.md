### 618.

<span class="margnote"> On the preparation and use of colours
(618-627).</span>To make a fine green take green and mix it with bitumen
and you will make the shadows darker. Then, for lighter \[shades\] green
with yellow ochre, and for still lighter green with yellow, and for the
high lights pure yellow; then mix green and turmeric together and glaze
every thing with it. To make a fine red take cinnabar or red chalk or
burnt ochre for the dark shadows and for the lighter ones red chalk and
vermilion and for the lights pure vermilion and then glaze with fine
lake. To make good oil for painting. One part of oil, one of the first
refining and one of the second.
