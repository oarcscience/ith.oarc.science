### OF UNDULATING MOVEMENTS AND EQUIPOISE IN FIGURES AND OTHER ANIMALS.

When representing a human figure or some graceful animal, be careful to
avoid a wooden stiffness; that is to say make them move with equipoise
and balance so as not to look like a piece of wood; but those you want
to represent as strong you must not make so, excepting in the turn of
the head.
