*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 771.

The cracks in walls will never be parallel unless the part of the wall
that separates from the remainder does not slip down.

### WHAT IS THE LAW BY WHICH BUILDINGS HAVE STABILITY.

The stability of buildings is the result of the contrary law to the two
former cases. That is to say that the walls must be all built up
equally, and by degrees, to equal heights all round the building, and
the whole thickness at once, whatever kind of walls they may be. And
although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one it will not
necessarily give way under the added weight day by day and thus, \[16\]
although a thin wall dries more quickly than a thick one, it will not
give way under the weight which the latter may acquire from day to day.
Because if double the amount of it dries in one day, one of double the
thickness will dry in two days or thereabouts; thus the small addition
of weight will be balanced by the smaller difference of time \[18\].

The adversary says that *a* which projects, slips down.

And here the adversary says that *r* slips and not *c*.

### HOW TO PROGNOSTICATE THE CAUSES OF CRACKS IN ANY SORT OF WALL.

The part of the wall which does not slip is that in which the obliquity
projects and overhangs the portion which has parted from it and slipped
down.

### ON THE SITUATION OF FOUNDATIONS AND IN WHAT PLACES THEY ARE A CAUSE OF RUIN.

When the crevice in the wall is wider at the top than at the bottom, it
is a manifest sign, that the cause of the fissure in the wall is remote
from the perpendicular line through the crevice.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[78:400](0771.htm#fr_66.md) : Lines 1-5 refer to
[Pl. CV](pl105.htm#img_pl105.md), No. 2. Line 9 *alle due anteciedete*, see
on the same page.

Lines 16-18. The translation of this is doubtful, and the meaning in any
case very obscure.

Lines 19-23 are on the right hand margin close to the two sketches on
