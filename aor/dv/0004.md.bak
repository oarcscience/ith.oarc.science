*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 4.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

<span class="margnote"> The disorder in the MSS.</span>Begun at
Florence, in the house of Piero di Braccio Martelli, on the 22nd day of
March 1508. And this is to be a collection without order, taken from
many papers which I have copied here, hoping to arrange them later each
in its place, according to the subjects of which they may treat. But I
believe that before I am at the end of this \[task\] I shall have to
repeat the same things several times; for which, O reader! do not blame
me, for the subjects are many and memory cannot retain them \[all\] and
say: 'I will not write this because I wrote it before.' And if I wished
to avoid falling into this fault, it would be necessary in every case
when I wanted to copy \[a passage\] that, not to repeat myself, I should
read over all that had gone before; and all the more since the intervals
are long between one time of writing and the next.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_5"></span>[12:3](0004.htm#fr_5.md) : 1. In the history of
Florence in the early part of the XVIth century *Piero di Braccio
Martelli* is frequently mentioned as *Commissario della Signoria*. He
was famous for his learning and at his death left four books on
Mathematics ready for the press; comp. LITTA, *Famiglie celebri
Italiane*, *Famiglia Martelli di Firenze*.--In the Official Catalogue of
MSS. in the Brit. Mus., New Series Vol. I., where this passage is
printed, *Barto* has been wrongly given for Braccio.

2\. *addi 22 di marzo 1508*. The Christian era was computed in Florence
at that time from the Incarnation (Lady day, March 25th). Hence this
should be 1509 by our reckoning.

3\. *racolto tratto di molte carte le quali io ho qui copiate*. We must
suppose that Leonardo means that he has copied out his own MSS. and not
those of others. The first thirteen leaves of the MS. in the Brit. Mus.
are a fair copy of some notes on physics.
