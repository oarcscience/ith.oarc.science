*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1270.

### A FABLE.

The ant found a grain of millet. The seed feeling itself taken prisoner
cried out to her: "If you will do me the kindness to allow me accomplish
my function of reproduction, I will give you a hundred such as I am."
And so it was.

A Spider found a bunch of grapes which for its sweetness was much
resorted to by bees and divers kinds of flies. It seemed to her that she
had found a most convenient spot to spread her snare, and having settled
herself on it with her delicate web, and entered into her new
habitation, there, every day placing herself in the openings made by the
spaces between the grapes, she fell like a thief on the wretched
creatures which were not aware of her. But, after a few days had passed,
the vintager came, and cut away the bunch of grapes and put it with
others, with which it was trodden; and thus the grapes were a snare and
pitfall both for the treacherous spider and the betrayed flies.

An ass having gone to sleep on the ice over a deep lake, his heat
dissolved the ice and the ass awoke under water to his great grief, and
was forthwith drowned.

A falcon, unable to endure with patience the disappearance of a duck,
which, flying before him had plunged under water, wished to follow it
under water, and having soaked his feathers had to remain in the water
while the duck rising to the air mocked at the falcon as he drowned.

The spider wishing to take flies in her treacherous net, was cruelly
killed in it by the hornet.

An eagle wanting to mock at the owl was caught by the wings in bird-lime
and was taken and killed by a man.
