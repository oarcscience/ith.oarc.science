*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 350.

<span class="margnote"> The movement of the arm (350-354).</span>In the
innermost bend of the joints of every limb the reliefs are converted
into a hollow, and likewise every hollow of the innermost bends becomes
a convexity when the limb is straightened to the utmost. And in this
very great mistakes are often made by those who have insufficient
knowledge and trust to their own invention and do not have recourse to
the imitation of nature; and these variations occur more in the middle
of the sides than in front, and more at the back than at the sides.
