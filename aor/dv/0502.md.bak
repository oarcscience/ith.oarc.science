*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 502.

### HOW, IN IMPORTANT WORKS, A MAN SHOULD NOT TRUST ENTIRELY TO HIS MEMORY WITHOUT CONDESCENDING TO DRAW FROM NATURE.

<span class="margnote"> A caution against one-sided study.</span>Any
master who should venture to boast that he could remember all the forms
and effects of nature would certainly appear to me to be graced with
extreme ignorance, inasmuch as these effects are infinite and our memory
is not extensive enough to retain them. Hence, O! painter, beware lest
the

lust of gain should supplant in you the dignity of art; for the
acquisition of glory is a much greater thing than the glory of riches.
Hence, for these and other reasons which might be given, first strive in
drawing to represent your intention to the eye by expressive forms, and
the idea originally formed in your imagination; then go on taking out or
putting in, until you have satisfied yourself. Then have living men,
draped or nude, as you may have purposed in your work, and take care
that in dimensions and size, as determined by perspective, nothing is
left in the work which is not in harmony with reason and the effects in
nature. And this will be the way to win honour in your art.
