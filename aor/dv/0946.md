### WHY WATER IS SALT.

<span class="margnote"> Refutation of Pliny's theory as to the saltness
of the sea (946. 947).</span>Pliny says in his second book, chapter 103,
that the water of the sea is salt because the heat of the sun dries up
the moisture and drinks it up; and this gives to the wide stretching sea
the savour of salt. But this cannot be admitted, because if the saltness
of the sea were caused by the heat of the sun, there can be no doubt
that lakes, pools and marshes would be so much the more salt, as their
waters have less motion and are of less depth; but experience shows us,
on the contrary, that these lakes have their waters quite free from
salt. Again it is stated by Pliny in the same chapter that this saltness
might originate,

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

because all the sweet and subtle portions which the heat attracts easily
being taken away, the more bitter and coarser part will remain, and thus
the water on the surface is fresher than at the bottom  <span
id="fr_165"></span>[499](#fn_165.md) ; but this is contradicted by the same
reason given above, which is, that the same thing would happen in
marshes and other waters, which are dried up by the heat. Again, it has
been said that the saltness of the sea is the sweat of the earth; to
this it may be answered that all the springs of water which penetrate
through the earth, would then be salt. But the conclusion is, that the
saltness of the sea must proceed from the many springs of water which,
as they penetrate into the earth, find mines of salt and these they
dissolve in part, and carry with them to the ocean and the other seas,
whence the clouds, the begetters of rivers, never carry it up. And the
sea would be salter in our times than ever it was at any time; and if
the adversary were to say that in infinite time the sea would dry up or
congeal into salt, to this I answer that this salt is restored to the
earth by the setting free of that part of the earth which rises out of
the sea with the salt it has acquired, and the rivers return it to the
earth under the sea.

 <span id="fr_166"></span>[500](#fn_166.md) . *Itaque Solis ardore siccatur
liquor: et hoc esse masculum sidus accepimus, torrens cuncta
sorbensque.* (cp. CIV.) *Sic mari late patenti saporem incoqui salis,
aut quia exhausto inde dulci tenuique, quod facillime trahat vis ignea,
omne asperius crassiusque linquatur: ideo summa aequorum aqua dulciorem
profundam; hanc esse veriorem causam, quam quod mare terrae sudor sit
aeternus: aut quia plurimum ex arido misceatur illi vapore: aut quia
terrae natura sicut medicatas aquas inficiat* ... (cp. CV): *altissimum
mare XV. stadiorum Fabianus tradit. Alii n Ponto coadverso Coraxorum
gentis (vocant B Ponti) trecentis fere a continenti stadiis immensam
altitudinem maris tradunt, vadis nunquam repertis.* (cp. CVI \[CIII\])
*Mirabilius id faciunt aquae dulces, juxta mare, ut fistulis emicantes.
Nam nec aquarum natura a miraculis cessat. Dulces mari invehuntur,
leviores haud dubie. Ideo et marinae, quarum natura gravior, magis
invecta sustinent. Quaedam vero et dulces inter se supermeant alias.*\]
