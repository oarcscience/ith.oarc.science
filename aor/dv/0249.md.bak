### TO PROVE HOW IT IS THAT LUMINOUS BODIES APPEAR LARGER, AT A DISTANCE, THAN THEY ARE.

If you place two lighted candles side by side half a braccio apart, and
go from them to a distance 200 braccia you will see that by the
increased size of each they will appear as a single luminous body with
the light of the two flames, one braccio wide.

### TO PROVE HOW YOU MAY SEE THE REAL SIZE OF LUMINOUS BODIES.

If you wish to see the real size of these luminous bodies, take a very
thin board and make in it a hole no bigger than the tag of a lace and
place it as close to your eye as possible, so that when you look through
this hole, at the said light, you can see a large space of air round it.
Then by rapidly moving this board backwards and forwards before your eye
you will see the light increase \[and diminish\].
