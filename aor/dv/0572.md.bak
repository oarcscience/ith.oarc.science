### OF A METHOD OF KEEPING IN MIND THE FORM OF A FACE.

If you want to acquire facility for bearing in mind the expression of a
face, first make yourself familiar with a variety of \[forms of\]
several heads, eyes, noses, mouths, chins and cheeks and necks and
shoulders: And to put a case: Noses are of 10 types: straight, bulbous,
hollow, prominent above or below the middle, aquiline, regular, flat,
round or pointed. These hold good as to profile. In full face they are
of 11 types; these are equal thick in the middle, thin in the middle,
with the tip thick and the root narrow, or narrow at the tip and wide at
the root; with the nostrils wide or narrow, high or low, and the
openings wide or hidden by the point; and you will find an equal variety
in the other details; which things you must draw from nature and fix
them in your mind. Or else, when you have to draw a face by heart, carry
with you a little book in which you have noted such features; and when
you have cast a glance at the face of the person you wish to draw, you
can look, in private, which nose or mouth is most like, or there make a
little mark to recognise it again at home. Of grotesque faces I need say
nothing, because they are kept in mind without difficulty.

The position of the head.
