*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 36.

### ON PERSPECTIVE.

The eye which turns from a white object in the light of the sun and goes
into a less fully lighted place will see everything as dark. And this
happens either because the pupils of the eyes which have rested on this
brilliantly lighted white object have contracted so much that, given at
first a certain extent of surface, they will have lost more than 3/4 of
their size; and, lacking in size, they are also deficient in \[seeing\]
power. Though you might say to me: A little bird (then) coming down
would see comparatively little, and from the smallness of his pupils the
white might seem black! To this I should reply that here we must have
regard to the proportion of the mass of that portion of the brain which
is given up to the sense of sight and to nothing else. Or--to
return--this pupil in Man dilates and contracts according to the
brightness or darkness of (surrounding) objects; and since it takes some
time to dilate and contract, it cannot see immediately on going out of
the light and into the shade, nor, in the same way, out of the shade
into the light, and this very thing has already deceived me in painting
an eye, and from that I learnt it.
