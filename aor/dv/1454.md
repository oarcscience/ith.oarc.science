### Footnotes

<span id="fn_471"></span>[436:777](1454.htm#fr_471.md) 2: Vasari states
that Leonardo invented mechanical birds which moved through the air.
Compare No. 703.

<span id="fn_472"></span>[436:778](1454.htm#fr_472.md) : 1454. Much of No.
1444 is repeated in this memorandum.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[437:779](1454.htm#fr_473.md) : 7. 36. *Meteora*.
See No. 1448, 25.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[437:780](1454.htm#fr_474.md) 16: *Pier di Cosimo*
the well known Florentine painter 1462-1521. See VASARI, *Vite* (Vol.
IV, p. 134 ed. Sansoni 1880) about Leonardo's influence on Piero di
Cosimo's style of painting.

<span id="fn_475"></span>[437:781](1454.htm#fr_475.md) 17: *Filippo e
Lorenzo*; probably the painters Filippino Lippi and Lorenzo di Credi. L.
di Credi's pictures and Vasari's history of that painter bear ample
evidence to his intimate relations with Leonardo.

<span id="fn_476"></span>[437:782](1454.htm#fr_476.md) 36: *Meteora*. See
No. 1448, 25.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[437:783](1454.htm#fr_477.md) 37: *Lorenzo di Pier
Francesco* and his brother *Giovanni* were a lateral branch of the
*Medici* family and changed their name for that of Popolani.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[437:784](1454.htm#fr_478.md) 41: Possibly this
refers to the clock on the tower of the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence. In
February 1512 it had been repaired, and so arranged as to indicate the
hours after the French manner (twelve hours a. m. and as many p. m.).
