### IN PRAISE OF THE SUN.

<span class="margnote"> The question of the true and of the apparent
size of the sun (879-884).</span>If you look at the stars, cutting off
the rays (as may be done by looking through a very small hole made with
the extreme point of a very fine needle, placed so as almost to touch
the eye), you will see those stars so minute that it would seem as
though nothing could be smaller; it is in fact their great distance
which is the reason of their diminution, for many of them are very many
times larger than the star which is the earth with water. Now reflect
what this our star must look like at such a distance, and then consider
how many stars might be added--both in longitude and latitude--between
those stars which are scattered over the darkened sky. But I cannot

larger than it appears; among these was Epicurus, and I believe that he

derived from Book X of Diogenes Laertius, whose *Vitae Philosophorum*
was not printed in Greek till 1533, but the Latin translation appeared
in 1475.
