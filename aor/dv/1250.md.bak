### THE MACLI.--CAUGHT WHEN ASLEEP.

This beast is born in Scandinavia. It has the shape of a great horse,
excepting that the great length of its neck and of its ears make a
difference. It feeds on grass, going backwards, for it has so long an
upper lip that if it went forwards it would cover up the grass. Its legs
are all in one piece; for this reason when it wants to sleep it leans
against a tree, and the hunters, spying out the place where it is wont
to sleep, saw the tree almost through, and then, when it leans against
it to sleep, in its sleep it falls, and thus the hunters take it. And
every other mode of taking it is in vain, because it is incredibly swift
in running.
