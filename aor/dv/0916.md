### 916.

<span class="margnote"> Of time and its divisions
(916-918).</span>Although time is included in the class of Continuous
Quantities, being indivisible and immaterial, it does not come entirely
under the head of Geometry, which represents its divisions by means of
figures and bodies of infinite variety, such as are seen to be
continuous in their visible and material properties. But only with its
first principles does it agree, that is with the Point and the Line; the
point may be compared to an instant of time, and the line may be likened
to the length of a certain quantity of time, and just as a line begins
and terminates in a point, so such a space of time. begins and
terminates in an instant. And whereas a line is infinitely divisible,
the divisibility of a space of time is of the same nature; and as the
divisions of the line may bear a certain proportion to each other, so
may the divisions of time.
