### OF PAINTING.

The conditions of shadow and light \[as seen\] by the eye are 3. Of
these the first is when the eye and the light are on the same side of
the object seen; the 2nd is when the eye is in front of the object and
the light is behind it. The 3rd is when the eye is in front of the
object and the light is on one side, in such a way as that a line drawn
from the object to the eye and one from the object to the light should
form a right angle where they meet.
