### ON FISSURES IN WALLS.

First write the treatise on the causes of the giving way of walls and
then, separately, treat of the remedies.

Parallel fissures constantly occur in buildings which are erected on a
hill side, when the hill is composed of stratified rocks with an oblique
stratification, because water and other moisture often penetrates these
oblique seams carrying in greasy and slippery soil; and as the strata
are not continuous down to the bottom of the valley, the rocks slide in
the direction of the slope, and the motion does not cease till they have
reached the bottom of the valley, carrying with them, as though in a
boat, that portion of the building which is separated by them from the
rest. The remedy for this is always to build thick piers under the wall
which is slipping, with arches from one to another, and with a good
scarp and let the piers have a firm foundation in the strata so that
they may not break away from them.

In order to find the solid part of these strata, it is necessary to make
a shaft at the foot of the wall of great depth through the strata; and
in this shaft, on the side from which the hill slopes, smooth and
flatten a

space one palm wide from the top to the bottom; and after some time this
smooth portion made on the side of the shaft, will show plainly which
part of the hill is moving.
