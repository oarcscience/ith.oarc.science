### THE LEVANT.

<span class="margnote"> The Levantine Sea.</span>On the shores of the
Mediterranean 300 rivers flow, and 40, 200 ports. And this sea is 3000
miles long. Many times has the increase of its waters, heaped up by
their backward flow and the blowing of the West winds, caused the
overflow of the Nile and of the rivers which flow out through the Black
Sea, and have so much raised the seas that they have spread with vast
floods over many countries. And these floods take place at the time when
the sun melts the snows on the high mountains of Ethiopia that rise up
into the cold regions of the air; and in the same way the approach of
the sun acts on the mountains of Sarmatia in Asia and on those in
Europe; so that the gathering together of these three things are, and
always have been, the cause of tremendous floods: that is, the return
flow of the sea with the West wind and the melting of the snows. So
every river will overflow in Syria, in Samaria, in Judea between Sinai
and the Lebanon, and in the rest of Syria between the Lebanon and the
Taurus mountains, and in Cilicia, in the Armenian mountains, and in
Pamphilia and in Lycia within the hills,

and in Egypt as far as the Atlas mountains. The gulf of Persia which was
formerly a vast lake of the Tigris and discharged into the Indian Sea,
has now worn away the mountains which formed its banks and laid them
even with the level of the Indian ocean. And if the Mediterranean had
continued its flow through the gulf of Arabia, it would have done the
same, that is to say, would have reduced the level of the Mediterranean
to that of the Indian Sea.
