*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 587.

### OF THE SELECTION OF BEAUTIFUL FACES.

It seems to me to be no small charm in a painter when he gives his
figures a

pleasing air, and this grace, if he have it not by nature, he may
acquire by incidental study in this way: Look about you and take the
best parts of many beautiful faces, of which the beauty is confirmed
rather by public fame than by your own judgment; for you might be
mistaken and choose faces which have some resemblance to your own. For
it would seem that such resemblances often please us; and if you should
be ugly, you would select faces that were not beautiful and you would
then make ugly faces, as many painters do. For often a master's work
resembles himself. So select beauties as I tell you, and fix them in
your mind.
