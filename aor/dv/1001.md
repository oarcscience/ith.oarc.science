### I.

### ITALY.

### CANAL OF FLORENCE.

<span class="margnote"> Canals in connection with the Arno
(1001-1008).</span>Sluices should be made in the valley of la Chiana at
Arezzo, so that when, in the summer, the Arno lacks water, the canal may
not remain dry: and let this canal be 20 braccia wide at the bottom, and
at the top 30, and 2 braccia deep, or 4, so that two of these braccia
may flow to the mills and the meadows, which will benefit the country;
and Prato, Pistoia and Pisa, as well as Florence, will gain two hundred
thousand ducats a year, and will lend a hand and money to this useful
work; and the Lucchese the same, for the lake of Sesto will be
navigable; I shall direct it to Prato and Pistoia, and cut through
Serravalle and make an issue into the lake; for there will be no need of
locks or supports, which are not lasting and so will always be giving
trouble in working at them and keeping them up.

And know that in digging this canal where it is 4 braccia

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

deep, it will cost 4 dinari the square braccio; for twice the depth 6
dinari, if you are making 4 braccia  <span
id="fr_199"></span>[533](#fn_199) and there are but 2 banks; that is to
say one from the bottom of the trench to the surface of the edges of it,
and the other from these edges to the top of the ridge of earth which
will be raised on the margin of the bank. And if this bank were of
double the depth only the first bank will be increased, that is 4
braccia increased by half the first cost; that is to say that if at
first 4 dinari were paid for 2 banks, for 3 it would come to 6, at 2
dinari the bank, if the trench measured 16 braccia at the bottom; again,
if the trench were 16 braccia wide and 4 deep, coming to 4 lire for the
work, 4 Milan dinari the square braccio; a trench which was 32 braccia
at the bottom would come to 8 dinari the square braccio.
