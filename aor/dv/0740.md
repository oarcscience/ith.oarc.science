*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 740.

### OF LUTING THE FURNACE WITHIN.

The furnace must be luted before you put the metal in it, with earth
from Valenza, and over that with ashes.

### OF RESTORING THE METAL WHEN IT IS BECOMING COOL.

When you see that the bronze is congealing take some willow-wood cut in
small chips and make up the fire with it.

### THE CAUSE OF ITS CURDLING.

I say that the cause of this congealing often proceeds from too much
fire, or from ill-dried wood.

### TO KNOW THE CONDITION OF THE FIRE.

You may know when the fire is good and fit for your purpose by a clear
flame,

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

and if you see the tips of the flames dull and ending in much smoke do
not trust it, and particularly when the flux metal is almost fluid.

### OF ALLOYING THE METAL.

Metal for guns must invariably be made with 6 or even 8 per cent, that
is 6 of tin to one hundred of copper, for the less you put in, the
stronger will the gun be.

### WHEN THE TIN SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE COPPER.

The tin should be put in with the copper when the copper is reduced to a
fluid.

### HOW TO HASTEN THE MELTING.

You can hasten the melting when 2/3ds of the copper is fluid; you can
then, with a stick of chestnut-wood, repeatedly stir what of copper
remains entire amidst what is melted.
