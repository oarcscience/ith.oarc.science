### 1349.

<span class="margnote"> Draft of Letter to the Governor of
Milan.</span>I am afraid lest the small return I have made for the great
benefits, I have received from your Excellency, have not made you

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

somewhat angry with me, and that this is why to so many letters which I
have written to your Lordship I have never had an answer. I now send
Salai to explain to your Lordship that I am almost at an end of the
litigation I had with my brother; that I hope to find myself with you
this Easter, and to carry with me two pictures of two Madonnas of
different sizes. These were done for our most Christian King, or for
whomsoever your Lordship may please. I should be very glad to know on my
return thence where I may have to reside, for I would not give any more
trouble to your Lordship. Also, as I have worked for the most Christian
King, whether my salary is to continue or not. I wrote to the President
as to that water which the king granted me, and which I was not put in
possession of because at that time there was a dearth in the canal by
reason of the great droughts and because  <span
id="fr_377"></span>[683](#fn_377.md) its outlets were not regulated; but he
certainly promised me that when this was done I should be put in
possession. Thus I pray your Lordship that you will take so much
trouble, now that these outlets are regulated, as to remind the
President of my matter; that is, to give me possession of this water,
because on my return I hope to make there instruments and other things
which will greatly please our most Christian King. Nothing else occurs
to me. I am always yours to command.  <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_377"></span>[404:683](1349.htm#fr_377.md) :Compare Nos. 1009
and 1010. Leonardo has noted the payment of the pension from the king in
1505.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[404:684](1349.htm#fr_378.md) :1349. Charles
d'Amboise, Marechal de Chaumont, was Governor of Milan under Louis XII.
Leonardo was in personal communication with him so early as in 1503. He
was absent from Milan in the autumn of 1506 and from October l5l0--when
he besieged Pope Julius II. in Bologna--till his death, which took place
at Correggio, February 11, 1511. Francesco Vinci, Leonardo's uncle,
died--as Amoretti tells us--in the winter of l5l0-11 (or according to
Uzielli in 1506?), and Leonardo remained in Florence for business
connected with his estate. The letter written with reference to this
affair, No. 1348, is undoubtedly earlier than the letters Nos. 1349 and
1350. Amoretti tells us, *Memorie Storiche*, ch. II, that the following
note existed on the same leaf in MS. C. A. I have not however succeeded
in finding it. The passage runs thus: *Jo sono quasi al fine del mio
letizio che io o con mie fratetgli ... Ancora ricordo a V. Excia la
facenda che o cum Ser Juliana mio Fratello capo delli altri fratelli
ricordandoli come se offerse di conciar le cose nostre fra noi fratelli
del comune della eredita de mio Zio, e quelli costringa alla
expeditione, quale conteneva la lettera che lui me mando.*
