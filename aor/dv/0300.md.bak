### 300.

### OF THE COLOUR OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

<span class="margnote"> On the colour of the atmosphere
(300-307).</span>I say that the blueness we see in the atmosphere is not
intrinsic colour, but is caused by warm vapour evaporated in minute and
insensible atoms on which the solar rays fall, rendering them luminous
against the infinite darkness of the fiery sphere which lies beyond and
includes it. And this may be seen, as I saw it by any one going up
 <span id="fr_132"></span>[130](#fn_132.md) Monboso, a peak of the Alps
which divide France from Italy. The base of this mountain gives birth to
the four rivers which flow in four different directions through the
whole of Europe. And no mountain has its base at so great a height as
this, which lifts itself almost above the clouds; and snow seldom falls
there, but only hail in the summer, when the clouds are highest. And
this hail lies \[unmelted\] there, so that if it were not for the
absorption of the rising and falling clouds, which does not happen twice
in an age, an enormous mass of ice would

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

be piled up there by the hail, and in the middle of July I found it very
considerable. There I saw above me the dark sky, and the sun as it fell
on the mountain was far brighter here than in the plains below, because
a smaller extent of atmosphere lay between the summit of the mountain
and the sun. Again as an illustration of the colour of the atmosphere I
will mention the smoke of old and dry wood, which, as it comes out of a
chimney, appears to turn very blue, when seen between the eye and the
dark distance. But as it rises, and comes between the eye and the bright
atmosphere, it at once shows of an ashy grey colour; and this happens
because it no longer has darkness beyond it, but this bright and
luminous space. If the smoke is from young, green wood, it will not
appear blue, because, not being transparent and being full of
superabundant moisture, it has the effect of condensed clouds which take
distinct lights and shadows like a solid body. The same occurs with the
atmosphere, which, when overcharged with moisture appears white, and the
small amount of heated moisture makes it dark, of a dark blue colour;
and this will suffice us so far as concerns the colour of the
atmosphere; though it might be added that, if this transparent blue were
the natural colour of the atmosphere, it would follow that wherever a
larger mass air intervened between the eye and the element of fire, the
azure colour would be more intense; as we see in blue glass and in
sapphires, which are darker in proportion as they are larger. But the
atmosphere in such circumstances behaves in an opposite manner, inasmuch
as where a greater quantity of it lies between the eye and the sphere of
fire, it is seen much whiter. This occurs towards the horizon. And the
less the extent of atmosphere between the eye and the sphere of fire,
the deeper is the blue colour, as may be seen even on low plains. Hence
it follows, as I say, that the atmosphere assumes this azure hue by
reason of the particles of moisture which catch the rays of the sun.
Again, we may note the difference in particles of dust, or particles of
smoke, in the sun beams admitted through holes into a dark chamber, when
the former will look ash grey

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

and the thin smoke will appear of a most beautiful blue; and it may be
seen again in in the dark shadows of distant mountains when the air
between the eye and those shadows will look very blue, though the
brightest parts of those mountains will not differ much from their true
colour. But if any one wishes for a final proof let him paint a board
with various colours, among them an intense black; and over all let him
lay a very thin and transparent \[coating of\] white. He will then see
that this transparent white will nowhere show a more beautiful blue than
over the black--but it must be very thin and finely ground.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[161:130](0300.htm#fr_132.md) 5: With regard to
the place spoken of as *M'oboso* (compare No. 301 line 20) its identity
will be discussed under Leonardo's Topographical notes in Vol. II.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[163:131](0300.htm#fr_133.md) 7: *reta* here has
the sense of *malanno*.
