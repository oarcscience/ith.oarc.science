### 1342.

You would like to see a model which will prove useful to you and to me,
also it will be of use to those who will be the cause of our usefulness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_369"></span>[398:675](1342.htm#fr_369.md) : 1342. 1343. These
two notes occur in the same not very voluminous MS. as the former one
and it is possible that they are fragments of the same letter. By the
*Modello*, the equestrian statue is probably meant, particularly as the
model of this statue was publicly exhibited in this very year, 1493, on
tne occasion of the marriage of the Emperor Maximilian with Bianca Maria
Sforza.
