*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1227.

### JUSTICE.

We may liken the virtue of Justice to the king of the bees which orders
and arranges every thing with judgment. For some bees are ordered to go
to the flowers, others are ordered to labour, others to fight with the
wasps, others to clear away all dirt, others to
[accompany](errata.htm#1.md) and escort the king; and when he is old and
has no wings they carry him. And if one of them fails in his duty, he is
punished without reprieve.

### TRUTH.

Although partridges steal each other's eggs, nevertheless the young born
of these eggs always return to their true mother.
