1\. Churches formed on the plan of a Greek cross.

### Group I.

### Domes rising from a circular base.

The simplest type of central building is a circular edifice.

[Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md), No. 9. Plan of a circular building
surrounded by a colonnade.

[Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md), No. 8. Elevation of the former, with
a conical roof.

[Pl. XC](pl090.htm#img_pl090.md). No. 5. A dodecagon, as most nearly
approaching the circle.

[Pl. LXXXVI](pl086.htm#img_pl086.md), No. 1, 2, 3. Four round chapels are
added at the extremities of the two principal axes;--compare this plan
with fig. 1 on p. 44 and fig. 3 on p. 47 (W. P. 5b) where the outer wall
is octagonal.

### Group II.

### Domes rising from a square base.

The plan is a square surrounded by a colonnade, and the dome seems to be
octagonal.

[Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md). The square plan below the circular
building No. 8, and its elevation to the left, above the plan: here the
ground-plan is square, the upper storey octagonal. A further development
of this type is shown in two sketches C. A. 3a (not reproduced here),
and in

[Pl. LXXXVI](pl086.htm#img_pl086.md), No. 5 (which possibly belongs to No.
7 on [Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084).md).

[Pl. LXXXV](pl085.htm#img_pl085.md), No. 4, and p. 45, Fig. 3, a Greek
cross, repeated p. 45, Fig. 3, is another development of the square
central plan.

The remainder of these studies show two different systems; in the first
the dome rises from a square plan,--in the second from an octagonal
base.

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

Group III.

Domes rising from a square base and four pillars.  <span
id="fr_35"></span>[369](#fn_35.md)

**a) First type**. *A Dome resting on four pillars in the centre of a
square edifice, with an apse in the middle, of each of the four sides.
We have eleven variations of this type.*

aa) [Pl. LXXXVIII](pl088.htm#img_pl088.md), No. 3.

bb) [Pl. LXXX](pl080.htm#img_pl080.md), No. 5.

cc\) [Pl. LXXXV](pl085.htm#img_pl085.md), Nos. 2, 3, 5.

dd) [Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md), No. 1 and 4 beneath.

ee) [Pl. LXXXV](pl085.htm#img_pl085.md), Nos. 1, 7, 10, 11.

**b) Second type**. *This consists in adding aisles to the whole plan of
the first type; columns are placed between the apses and the aisles; the
plan thus obtained is very nearly identical with that of S. Lorenzo at
Milan.*

Fig. 1 on p. 56. (MS. B, 75a) shows the result of this treatment adapted
to a peculiar purpose about which we shall have to say a few words later
on.

[Pl. XCV](pl095.htm#img_pl095.md), No. 1, shows the same plan but with the
addition of a short nave. This plan seems to have been suggested by the
general arrangement of S. Sepolcro at Milan.

MS. B. 57b (see the sketch reproduced on p.51). By adding towers in the
four outer angles to the last named plan, we obtain a plan which bears
the general features of Bramante's plans for S. Peter's at Rome.  <span
id="fr_36"></span>[370](#fn_36) *(See p. 51 Fig. 1..md)*

### Group IV.

Domes rising from an octagonal base.

This system, developed according to two different schemes, has given
rise to two classes with many varieties.

In a) On each side of the octagon chapels of equal form are added.

In b) The chapels are dissimilar; those which terminate the principal
axes being different in form from those which are added on the diagonal
sides of the octagon.

### a. First Class.

The Chapel "degli Angeli," *at Florence, built only to a height of about
20 feet by Brunellesco, may be considered as the prototype of this
group; and, indeed it probably suggested it. The fact that we see in MS.
B. 11b*

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *([Pl.
XCIV](pl094.htm#img_pl094), No. 3.md) by the side of Brunellesco's plan for
the Basilica of Sto. Spirito at Florence, a plan almost identical with
that of the* Capella degli Angeli, *confirms this supposition. Only two
small differences, or we may say improvements, have been introduced by
Leonardo. Firstly the back of the chapels contains a third niche, and
each angle of the Octagon a folded pilaster like those in Bramante's*
Sagrestia di S. M. presso San Satiro *at Milan, instead of an interval
between the two pilasters as seen in the Battistero at Florence and in
the Sacristy of Sto. Spirito in the same town and also in the above
named chapel by Brunellesco.*

The first set of sketches which come under consideration have at first
sight the appearance of mere geometrical studies. They seem to have been
suggested by the plan given on page 44 Fig. 2 (MS. B, 55a) in the centre
of which is written "Santa Maria in perticha da Pavia", *at the place
marked A on the reproduction.*

a\) (MS. B, 34b, page 44 Fig. 3). In the middle of each side a column is
added, and in the axes of the intercolumnar spaces a second row of
columns forms an aisle round the octagon. These are placed at the
intersection of a system of semicircles, of which the sixteen columns on
the sides of the octagon are the centres.

b\) The preceding diagram is completed and becomes more monumental in
style in the sketch next to it (MS. B, 35a, see p. 45 Fig. 1). An outer
aisle is added by circles, having for radius the distance between the
columns in the middle sides of the octagon.

c\) (MS. B. 96b, see p. 45 Fig. 2). Octagon with an aisle round it; the
angles of both are formed by columns. The outer sides are formed by 8
niches forming chapels. The exterior is likewise octagonal, with the
angles corresponding to the centre of each of the interior chapels.

[Pl. XCII](pl092.htm#img_pl092), No. 2 (MS. B. 96b.md). Detail and
modification of the preceding plan--half columns against piers--an
arrangement by which the chapels of the aisle have the same width of
opening as the inner arches between the half columns. Underneath this
sketch the following note occurs: questo vole - avere 12 facce - co 12
tabernaculi - come - *a* - *b*. *(This will have twelve sides with
twelve tabernacles as* a b.*) In the remaining sketches of this class
the octagon is not formed by columns at the angles.*

The simplest type shows a niche in the middle of each side and is
repeated on several sheets, viz: MS. B 3; MS. C.A. 354b (see [Pl.
LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084), No. 11.md) and MS. Ash II 6b; (see [Pl.
LXXXV](pl085.htm#img_pl085.md), No. 9 and the elevations No. 8; [Pl.
XCII](pl092.htm#img_pl092.md), No. 3; MS. B. 4b \[not reproduced here\] and
[Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084), No. 2.md).

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

*[Pl. XCII](pl092.htm#img_pl092), 3 (MS. B, 56b.md) corresponds to a plan
like the one in MS. B 35a, in which the niches would be visible outside
or, as in the following sketch, with the addition of a niche in the
middle of each chapel.*

[Pl. XC](pl090.htm#img_pl090.md), No. 6. The niches themselves are
surrounded by smaller niches (see also No. 1 on the same plate).

Octagon expanded on each side.

A. by a square chapel:

MS. B. 34b (not reproduced here).

B. by a square with 3 niches:

MS. B. 11b (see [Pl. XCIV](pl094.htm#img_pl094), No. 3.md).

C. by octagonal chapels:

a\) MS. B, 21a; [Pl. LXXXVIII](pl088.htm#img_pl088.md), No. 4.

b\) No. 2 on the same plate. Underneath there is the remark: "quest'e
come le 8 cappele ano a essere facte" *(this is how the eight chapels
are to be executed).*

c\) [Pl. LXXXVIII](pl088.htm#img_pl088.md), No. 5. Elevation to the plans
on the same sheet, it is accompanied by the note: "ciasscuno de' 9
tiburi no'uole - passare l'alteza - di - 2 - quadri" *(neither of the 9
domes must exceed the height of two squares).*

d\) [Pl. LXXXVIII](pl088.htm#img_pl088.md), No. 1. Inside of the same
octagon. MS. B, 30a, and 34b; these are three repetitions of parts of
the same plan with very slight variations.

D. by a circular chapel:

MS. B, 18a (see Fig. 1 on page 47) gives the plan of this arrangement in
which the exterior is square on the ground floor with only four of the
chapels projecting, as is explained in the next sketch.

[Pl. LXXXIX](pl089.htm#img_pl089.md), MS. B, 17b. Elevation to the
preceding plan sketched on the opposite side of the sheet, and also
marked A. It is accompanied by the following remark, indicating the
theoretical character of these studies: questo - edifitio - anchora -
starebbe - bene affarlo dalla linja - *a* - *b* - *c* - *d* - insu.
*("This edifice would also produce a good effect if only the part above
the lines* a b, c d, *were executed").*

[Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md), No. 11. The exterior has the form of
an octagon, but the chapels project partly beyond it. On the left side
of the sketch they appear larger than on the right side.

[Pl. XC](pl090.htm#img_pl090), No. 1, (MS. B, 25b.md); Repetition of [Pl.
LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md), No. 11.

[Pl. XC](pl090.htm#img_pl090.md), No. 2. Elevation to the plan No. 1, and
also to No. 6 of the same sheet.

[![](tn/v204700.jpg)

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

*E. By chapels formed by four niches:*

[Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md), No. 7 (the circular plan on the left
below) shows this arrangement in which the central dome has become
circular inside and might therefore be classed after this group.  <span
id="fr_37"></span>[371](#fn_37.md)

The sketch on the right hand side gives most likely the elevation for
the last named plan.

F. By chapels of still richer combinations, which necessitate an octagon
of larger dimensions:

[Pl. XCI](pl091.htm#img_pl091), No. 2 (MS. Ash. 11. 8b.md)  <span
id="fr_38"></span>[372](#fn_38.md) *; on this plan the chapels themselves
appear to be central buildings formed like the first type of the third
group. [Pl. LXXXVIII](pl088.htm#img_pl088.md), No. 3.*

[Pl. XCI](pl091.htm#img_pl091.md), No. 2 above; the exterior of the
preceding figure, particularly interesting on account of the alternation
of apses and niches, the latter containing statues of a gigantic size,
in proportion to the dimension of the niches.

### b. Second Class.

Composite plans of this class are generally obtained by combining two
types of the first class--the one worked out on the principal axes, the
other on the diagonal ones.

MS. B. 22 shows an elementary combination, without any additions on the
diagonal axes, but with the dimensions of the squares on the two
principal axes exceeding those of the sides of the octagon.

In the drawing W. P. 5b (see page 44 Fig. 1) the exterior only of the
edifice is octagonal, the interior being formed by a circular colonnade;
round chapels are placed against the four sides of the principal axes.

The elevation, drawn on the same sheet (see page 47 Fig. 3), shows the
whole arrangement which is closely related with the one on [Pl.
LXXXVI](pl086.htm#img_pl086.md) No. 1, 2.

MS. B. 21a shows:

a\) four sides with rectangular chapels crowned by pediments [Pl.
LXXXVII](pl087.htm#img_pl087) No. 3 (plan and elevation.md);

b\) four sides with square chapels crowned by octagonal domes. [Pl.
LXXXVII](pl087.htm#img_pl087.md) No. 4; the plan underneath.

MS. B. 18a shows a variation obtained by replacing the round chapels in
the principal axes of the sketch MS. B. l8a by square ones, with an

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

*apse. Leonardo repeated both ideas for better comparison side by side,
see page 47. Fig. 2.*

[Pl. LXXXIX](pl089.htm#img_pl089) (MS. B. 17b.md). Elevation for the
preceding figure. The comparison of the drawing marked M with the plan
on page 47 Fig. 2, bearing the same mark, and of the elevation on [Pl.
LXXXIX](pl089.htm#img_pl089) below (marked A.md) with the corresponding
plan on page 47 is highly instructive, as illustrating the spirit in
which Leonardo pursued these studies.

[Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md) No. 12 shows the design [Pl.
LXXXVII](pl087.htm#img_pl087.md) No. 3 combined with apses, with the
addition of round chapels on the diagonal sides.

[Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md) No. 13 is a variation of the preceding
sketch.

[Pl. XC](pl090.htm#img_pl090.md) No. 3. MS. B. 25b. The round chapels of
the preceding sketch are replaced by octagonal chapels, above which rise
campaniles.

[Pl. XC](pl090.htm#img_pl090.md) No. 4 is the elevation for the preceding
plan.

[Pl. XCII](pl092.htm#img_pl092) No. 1. (MS. B. 39b..md); the plan below. On
the principal as well as on the diagonal axes are diagonal chapels, but
the latter are separated from the dome by semicircular recesses. The
communication between these eight chapels forms a square aisle round the
central dome.

Above this figure is the elevation, showing four campaniles on the
angles.  <span id="fr_39"></span>[373](#fn_39.md)

*[Pl. LXXXIV](pl084.htm#img_pl084.md) No. 3. On the principal axes are
square chapels with three niches; on the diagonals octagonal chapels
with niches. Cod. Atl. 340b gives a somewhat similar arrangement.*

MS. B. 30. The principal development is thrown on the diagonal axes by
square chapels with three niches; on the principal axes are inner
recesses communicating with outer ones.

The plan [Pl. XCIII](pl093.htm#img_pl093) No. 2 (MS. B. 22.md) differs from
this only in so far as the outer semicircles have become circular
chapels, projecting from the external square as apses; one of them
serves as the entrance by a semicircular portico.

The elevation is drawn on the left side of the plan.

MS. B. 19. A further development of MS. B. 18, by employing for the four
principal chapels the type [Pl. LXXXVIII](pl088.htm#img_pl088.md) No. 3, as
we have already seen in [Pl. XCI](pl091.htm#img_pl091.md) No. 2; the
exterior presents two varieties.

a\) The outer contour follows the inner.  <span
id="fr_40"></span>[374](#fn_40.md)

b\) It is semicircular.

[Pl. LXXXVII](pl087.htm#img_pl087) No. 2 (MS. B. 18b.md) Elevation to the
first variation MS. B. 19. If we were not certain that this sketch was
by Leonardo, we might feel tempted to take it as a study by Bramante for
St. Peter's at Rome.  <span id="fr_41"></span>[375](#fn_41.md)

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

*MS. P. V. 39b. In the principal axes the chapels of MS. B. 19, and
semicircular niches on the diagonals. The exterior of the whole edifice
is also an octagon, concealing the form of the interior chapels, but
with its angles on their axes.*

### Group V.

### Suggested by San Lorenzo at Milan.

In MS. C. A. 266 IIb, 8l2b there is a plan almost identical with that of
San Lorenzo. The diagonal sides of the irregular octagon are not
indicated.

If it could be proved that the arches which, in the actual church, exist
on these sides in the first story, were added in 1574 by Martimo Bassi,
then this plan and the following section would be still nearer the
original state of San Lorenzo than at present. A reproduction of this
slightly sketched plan has not been possible. It may however be
understood from [Pl. LXXXVIII](pl088.htm#img_pl088.md) No. 3, by
suppressing the four pillars corresponding to the apses.

[Pl. LXXXVII](pl087.htm#img_pl087.md) No. 1 shows the section in elevation
corresponding with the above-named plan. The recessed chapels are
decorated with large shells in the halfdomes like the arrangement in San
Lorenzo, but with proportions like those of Bramante's Sacristy of Santa
Maria presso S. Satiro.

MS. C. A. 266; a sheet containing three views of exteriors of Domes. On
the same sheet there is a plan similar to the one above-named but with
uninterrupted aisles and with the addition of round chapels in the axes
(compare [Pl. XCVII](pl097.htm#img_pl097) No. 3 and page 44 Fig. 1.md),
perhaps a reminiscence of the two chapels annexed to San
Lorenzo.--Leonardo has here sketched the way of transforming this plan
into a Latin cross by means of a nave with side aisles.

[Pl. XCI](pl091.htm#img_pl091.md) No. 1. Plan showing a type deprived of
aisles and comprised in a square building which is surrounded by a
portico. It is accompanied by the following text:
