### 18.

<span class="margnote"> The use of the book on Painting.</span>These
rules are of use only in correcting the figures; since every man makes
some mistakes in his first compositions and he who knows them not,
cannot amend them. But you, knowing your errors, will correct your works
and where you find mistakes amend them, and remember never to fall into
them again. But if you try to apply these rules in composition you will
never make an end, and will produce confusion in your works.

These rules will enable you to have a free and sound judgment; since
good judgment is born of clear understanding, and a clear understanding
comes of reasons derived from sound rules, and sound rules are the issue
of sound experience--the common mother of all the sciences and arts.
Hence, bearing in mind the precepts of my rules, you will be able,
merely by your amended judgment, to criticise and recognise every thing
that is out of proportion in a work, whether in the perspective or in
the figures or any thing else.
