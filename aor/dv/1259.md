*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 1259.

trochilus, a very small bird, runs at once to its mouth and hops among
its teeth and goes pecking out the remains of the food, and so inciting
it with voluptuous delight tempts it to open the whole of its mouth, and
so it sleeps. This being observed by the ichneumon it flings itself into
its mouth and perforates its stomach and bowels, and finally kills it.

### THE DOLPHIN.

Nature has given such knowledge to animals, that besides the
consciousness of their own advantages they know the disadvantages of
their foes. Thus the dolphin understands what strength lies in a cut
from the fins placed on his chine, and how tender is the belly of the
crocodile; hence in fighting with him it thrusts at him from beneath and
rips up his belly and so kills him.

The crocodile is a terror to those that flee, and a base coward to those
that pursue him.
