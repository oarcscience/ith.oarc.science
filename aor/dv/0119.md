### 119.

### WHAT LIGHT AND SHADOW ARE.

<span class="margnote"> Definition of the nature of shadows
(119--122).</span>Shadow is the absence of light, merely the obstruction
of the luminous rays by an opaque body. Shadow is of the nature of
darkness. Light \[on an object\] is of the nature of a luminous body;
one conceals and the other reveals. They are always associated and
inseparable from all objects. But shadow

is a more powerful agent than light, for it can impede and entirely
deprive bodies of their light, while light can never entirely expel
shadow from a body, that is from an opaque body.
