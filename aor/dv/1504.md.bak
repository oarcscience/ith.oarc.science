### Footnotes

<span id="fn_547"></span>[458:847](1504.htm#fr_547.md) : In the original,
the passage given as No. 1463 is written between lines 2 and 3 of this
text, and it is possible that the entries in lines 3 and 4 refer to the
payments of Jacopo Tedesco, who is there mentioned. The first words of
these lines are very illegible.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[458:848](1504.htm#fr_548.md) : 7. Al fattore.

Il Fattore, was, as is well known, the nick-name of Giovanni Franceso
Penni, born in Florence in 1486, and subsequently a pupil of Raphael's.
According to Vasari he was known by it even as a boy. Whether he is
spoken of in this passage, or whether the word Fattore should be
translated literally, I will not undertake to decide. The latter seems
to me more probably right.
