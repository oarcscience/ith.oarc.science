*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 244.

That portion of a body of uniform breadth which is against a lighter
background will look narrower \[than the rest\].

\[4\] *e* is a given object, itself dark and of uniform breadth; *a b*
and *c d* are two backgrounds one darker than the other; *b c* is a
bright background, as it might be a spot lighted by the sun through an
aperture in a dark room. Then I say that the object *e g* will appear
larger at *e f* than at *g h*; because *e f* has a darker background
than *g h*; and again at *f g* it will look narrower from being seen by
the eye *o*, on the light background *b c*.  <span
id="fr_116"></span>[114](#fn_116.md) That part of a luminous body, of equal
breadth and brilliancy throughout, will look largest which is seen
against the darkest background; and the luminous body will seem on fire.
