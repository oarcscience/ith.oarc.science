*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 469.

### OF SMOKE AND DUST.

If the sun is in the East the smoke of cities will not be visible in the
West, because on that side it is not seen penetrated by the solar rays,
nor on a dark background; since the roofs of the houses turn the same
side to the eye as they turn towards the sun, and on this light
background the smoke is not very visible.

But dust, under the same aspect, will look darker than smoke being of
denser material than smoke which is moist.
