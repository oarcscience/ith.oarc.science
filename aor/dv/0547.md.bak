understand the picture well and particularly if it is done in oils, or
still more if it is varnished, because it will be lustrous and somewhat
of the nature of a mirror. And for this reason the nearer you go towards
the point *c*, the less you will see, because the rays of light falling
from the window on the picture are reflected to that point. But if you
place yourself between *e* and *d* you will get a good view of it, and
the more so as you approach the point *d*, because that spot is least
exposed to these reflected rays of light.
