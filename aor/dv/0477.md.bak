*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 477.

### OF CLOUDS, SMOKE AND DUST AND THE FLAMES OF A FURNACE OR OF A BURNING KILN.

The clouds do not show their rounded forms excepting on the sides which
face the sun; on the others the roundness is imperceptible because they
are in the shade.  <span id="fr_233"></span>[231](#fn_233.md)

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

If the sun is in the East and the clouds in the West, the eye placed
between the sun and the clouds sees the edges of the rounded forms
composing these clouds as dark, and the portions which are surrounded by
this dark \[edge\] are light. And this occurs because the edges of the
rounded forms of these clouds are turned towards the upper or lateral
sky, which is reflected in them.

Both the cloud and the tree display no roundness at all on their shaded
side.
