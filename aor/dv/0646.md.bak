*The Da Vinci Notebooks at Intangible Textual Heritage*

### 646.

### TO DILUTE WHITE WINE AND MAKE IT PURPLE.

Powder gall nuts and let this stand 8 days in the white wine; and in the
same way dissolve vitriol in water, and let the water stand and settle
very clear, and the wine likewise, each by itself, and strain them well;
and when you dilute the white wine with the water the wine will become
red.
