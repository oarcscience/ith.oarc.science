### 960.

In the West, near to Flanders, the sea rises and decreases every 6 hours
about 20 braccia, and 22 when the moon is in its favour; but 20 braccia
is the general rule, and this rule, as it is evident, cannot have the
moon for its cause. This variation in the increase and decrease of the
sea every 6 hours may arise from the damming up of the waters, which are
poured into the Mediterranean by the quantity of rivers from Africa,
Asia and Europe, which flow into that sea, and the waters which are
given to it by those rivers; it pours them to the ocean

through the straits of Gibraltar, between Abila and Calpe  <span
id="fr_172"></span>[506](#fn_172.md) . That ocean extends to the island of
England and others farther North, and it becomes dammed up and kept high
in various gulfs. These, being seas of which the surface is remote from
the centre of the earth, have acquired a weight, which as it is greater
than the force of the incoming waters which cause it, gives this water
an impetus in the contrary direction to that in which it came and it is
borne back to meet the waters coming out of the straits; and this it
does most against the straits of Gibraltar; these, so long as this goes
on, remain dammed up and all the water which is poured out meanwhile by
the aforementioned rivers, is pent up \[in the Mediterranean\]; and this
might be assigned as the cause of its flow and ebb, as is shown in the
21st of the 4th of my theory.
