##### THE

# HEROIC ENTHUSIASTS

##### (*GLI EROICI FURORI*)

## By GIORDANO BRUNO

### translated by L. WILLIAMS

##### \[1887 and 1889\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This heavily allegorical dialogue by Giordano Bruno is a philosophical
discussion of love. At a deeper layer it uses this topic as a mnemonic
device to encode a discussion of the nature of the universe, God and the
soul. The argument has echoes in Gnostic, Alchemical, Sufi and other
esoteric traditions, and some of the poetry is maddeningly similar to
Shakespeare (who was a contemporary of Bruno). This translation is one
of the few Bruno texts in English translation in the public domain, and
original copies of it are extremely rare. It has recently been
republished by Elibron in a print-on-demand edition. The transcription
of Part I was done in August 2002, and Part II in June 2004.
