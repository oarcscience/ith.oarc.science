# Second Dialogue

MARICONDO. Here you see a flaming yoke enveloped in knots round which is
written: Levius aura; which means that Divine love does not weigh down,
nor carry his servant captive and enslaved to the lowest depths, but
raises him, supports him and magnifies him above all liberty whatsoever.

CES. Prithee, let us read the sonnet, so that we may consider the sense
of it in due order with propriety and brevity.

MAR. It says thus:--

54\.

She who my mind to other love did move,  
To whom all others vile and vain appear,  
In whom alone is sovereign beauty seen,  
And excellence Divine is manifest.  
She from the forest coming, I beheld,  
Huntress of myself, beloved Artemis,  
'Midst beauteous nymphs, with air of nascent bells.  
Then said I unto Love: See, I am hers.  
And he to me: Oh, happy lover thou!  
Delectable companion of thy fate!  
That she alone of all the numberless,  
That hold within their bosom life and death,  
Who most with virtues high the world adorns, <span id="page_52">p.
52</span>  
Thou didst obtain, through will and destiny,  
Within the Court of Love.  
So happy thou in thy captivity  
Thou enviest not the liberty of man or God.

See how contented he is under that yoke, that marriage which has joined
him to her whom be saw issuing from the forest, from the desert, from
the woods, that is, from parts removed from the crowd, and from the
conversation of the vulgar who have but small enlightenment. Diana, the
splendour of the intelligible species, and huntress; because with her
beauty and grace she first wounded him, and then bound him and holds him
in her power, more contented than otherwise he could possibly have been.
He speaks of her "amidst beauteous nymphs," that is, the multitude of
other species, forms and ideas, and "air of bells," that is the genius
and the spirit which displayed itself at Nola, which lies on the plain
of the Campanian horizon. <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) He
acknowledges her, and she, more than any other, is praised by Love, who
considers him so fortunate, because amongst all those present or absent
to, mortal eyes, she does more highly adorn the world,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

and makes man glorious and beautiful. Hence he says that his mind is
raised towards the highest love, and that it learns to consider "every
other goddess," that is, the care or observation of every other kind, as
vile and vain. <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) Now, in saying that
she has roused his mind to high love, he takes occasion to magnify the
heart through the thoughts, desires and works, as much as possible, and
(to say) that we ought not to be entertained with low things which are
beneath our faculties, as happens to those who, through avarice or
through negligence, or indolence, become in this brief life attached to
unworthy things.

CES. There must be artisans, mechanics, agriculturists, servants,
trotters, ignoble, low, poor, pedants and such like, for otherwise there
could not be philosophers, meditators, cultivators of souls, masters,
captains, nobles, illustrious ones, rich, wise, and the rest who may be
heroes like to gods. Now why should we force ourselves to corrupt the
state of mature which has separated the universe into things major and
minor, superior and inferior, illustrious

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

and obscure, worthy and unworthy, not only outside ourselves but also
inside in the substance of us, even to that part of us which is said to
be immaterial?

So of the intelligences: some are low, others are pre-eminent, some
serve and some obey, some command and govern. I believe, however, that
this ought not to be brought forward as an example, so that subjects
wishing to be superiors, and the ignoble to equal the noble, the order
of things would become perverted and confounded, so that a sort of
neutrality would supervene, and a brutal equality, such as is found in
certain deserts and uncultured republics. Do you not see what damage has
been done to science through this: *i.e.* pedants wishing. to be
philosophers; to treat of natural things, and mix themselves with and
decide about things Divine r Who does not see how much evil has
happened, and does happen, through the mind having been moved through
similar facts to exalted affections? Who. is there, of good sense, who
cannot see what a fine. thing Aristotle made of it, when, being a master
of belles lettres at Alexandria, he set him self to oppose. and make war
against the Pythagorean doctrine, and that of natural philosophy;
seeking by means of his logical ratiocination to propose definitions

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

and notions, certain fifth entities and other abortive portions of
fantastical cogitations, as principles and substance of things, more
anxious about the esteem of the vulgar stupid crowd, which is influenced
and governed by sophisms and appearances which are found in the
superficies of things rather than by the Truth, which is occult and
hidden in the substance of them, and is the substance itself of them? He
roused his mind, not to make himself a mediator, but judge and censor of
things which he had never studied. nor well understood. Thus in our day,
that little which Aristotle can bring, is peculiar for its inventive
reasoning, its suggestiveness, its metaphysics, and is useful for other
pedants, who work with the same "Sursum corda." who institute new
dialectics and modes of forming the reason (judgment?) which are as much
viler than those of Aristotle, as may be the philosophy of Aristotle is
incomparably viler than that of the ancients. And it has been caused by
this, that certain grammarians having grown old in the birching of
children, and in anatomizing phrases and words, have sought to rouse the
mind to the formation of new logic and metaphysics, judging and
sentencing those which they had never studied nor understood: as also
these by the approbation of the ignorant multitude,

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

with whose mind they have most affinity, can easily demolish the
humanities and ratiocination of Aristotle, as the latter was the
executioner of the Divine philosophies of others. See, then, what it
comes to, if all should aspire to the sacred splendour, and yet are
occupied about things low and vain.

MAR.

Ride, si sapis, o puella, ride,  
Pelignus, puto, dixerat poeta;  
Sed non dixerat omnibus puellis;  
Et si dixerat omnibus puellis,  
Non dixit tibi. Ta puella, non es.

Thus the "Sursum corda" is not the measure for all; but for those that
have wings. We see that pedantry has never been held in such esteem for
the government of the world as in our times, and it offers as many paths
of the true intelligible species and objects of infallible and sole
truth as there are individual pedants. Therefore in this present time it
is proper that noble spirits equipped with truth and enlightened with
the Divine intelligence, should arm themselves against dense ignorance
by climbing up to the high rock and tower of contemplation. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md)

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

To them it is seemly that they hold every other object as vile and vain.
Nor should these spend their time in light and vain things; for time
flies with infinite velocity; the present rushes by with the same
swiftness with which the future draws near. That which we have lived is
nothing; that which we live is a point; that which we have to live is
not yet a point, but may be a point which, together, shall be and shall
have been. And with all this we crowd our memories with genealogies:
this one is intent upon the deciphering of writings, that other is
occupied in multiplying childish sophisms, and we shall see, for
example, a volume full of: Cor est fons vitae. Nix est alba, ergo cornix
est fons vitae alba, and one prattles about the noun; was it first, or
the verb; the other, whether the sea was first or the springs; again,
another tries to revive obsolete vocabularies which, because they were
once used and approved by some old writer, must now be exalted to the
stars. Yet another takes his stand upon the false or the true
orthography, and so on, with various similar nonsense only worthy of
contempt. They fast, they become thin and emaciated, they scourge the
skin, and lengthen the beard, they rot, and in these things they place
the anchor of their highest good. They despise fortune, and put

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

up these as shield and refuge against the strokes of fate. With
such-like most vile thoughts they think to mount to the stars, to be
equal to gods, and to understand the good and the beautiful which
philosophy promises.

CES. A grand thing, indeed, that time, which does not suffice for
necessary things, however carefully we use it, should come to be chiefly
consumed about superfluous things, and things vile and shameful.

Is it not rather a thing to laugh at than to praise in Archimedes, that
at the time when the city was in confusion, everything in ruins, fire
broken out in his room, enemies there at his back who had it in their
power to make him lose his brain, his life, his art; that he, meanwhile,
having abandoned all desire or intention of saving his life, lost it
while he was inquiring, perhaps, into the proportion of the curve to the
straight line, of the diameter to the circle, or other similar mathesis,
as suitable for youth, as it were unsuitable for one who, being old,
should. be intent upon things more worthy of being put as the end of
human desires?

MAR. In connection with this I like what you said just now, that there
must be all sorts of persons in the world, and that the number of the
imperfect,

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

the ugly, the poor, the unworthy and the villanous, should be the
greater, and, in short, it ought not to be otherwise than as it is. The
long life of Archimedes, of Euclid, of Priscian, of Donato, and others,
who were found up to their death occupied with numbers, lines, diction,
concordances, writings, dialectics, syllogisms, forms, methods, systems
of science, organs, and other preambles, is ordained for the service of
youth, so that they may learn to receive the fruits of the mature age of
those (sages) and be full of the same, even in their green age, so that
when they are older they may be fit and ready to arrive without
hindrance to higher things.

CES. I am not wrong in the proposition I moved just now when I spoke of
those who make it their study to appropriate to themselves the place and
the fame of the ancients with new works which are neither better nor
worse than those already existing, and spend their life in considering
how to turn wheat into tares, <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) and
find the work of their life in the elaboration of those studies which
are suited for children and are generally profitable to no one, not even
to themselves.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

MAR. But enough has been said about those who neither can nor dare to
have their mind roused to highest love. Let us now come to the
consideration of the voluntary captivity and of the pleasant yoke under
the dominion of the said Diana; that yoke, I say, without which, the
soul is impotent to rise to that height from which it fell, and which
renders it light and agile, while the noose renders it more active and
disengaged.

CES. Speak on then!

MAR. To begin, to continue, and to conclude in order; I consider that
all which lives must feed itself and nourish itself in a manner suitable
to the way in which it lives. Therefore, nothing squares with the
intellectual nature but the intellectual, as with the body nothing but
the corporeal; seeing that nourishment is taken for no other reason, but
that it should go to the substance of him who is to be nourished. As
then the body does not transmute into spirit, nor the spirit into
body,--for every transmutation takes place, when matter, which was in
one form, comes to be in another, <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md)--so the spirit and the body are not the
same matter; in that

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

that, which was subject to one should come to be subject to the other.

CES. Surely, if the soul should be nourished with body, it would carry
itself better there, where the fecundity of the material is, (as
Jamblichus argues); so that when a large fat body presents itself, we
should imagine that it were the habitation of a strong soul, firm, ready
and heroic, and we should say; Oh, fat soul, oh, fecund spirit, oh, fine
nature, oh, divine intelligence, ob, clear mind, oh, blessed repast, fit
to spread before lions, or verily for a banquet for dogs. On the other
hand, an old man shrivelled, weak, of failing strength, would be held to
be of little savour and of small account. But go on.

MAR. Now, it must be said that the outcome of the mind is that alone
which is always by it desired, sought for, and embraced, and that which
is more enjoyed than anything else, with which it is filled, comforted
and becomes better,--that is Truth, towards which, in all times, in
every state, and in whatsoever condition man finds himself, he always
aspires, and for the which he despises every fatigue, attempt, every
study, makes no account of the body, and hates this life. Therefore
Truth is an incorporeal thing, and neither physics, metaphysics, nor
mathematician be found in the body, because we see that the

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

eternal human essence is not in individuals, who are born and die. It
(Truth) is specific unity, said Plato, not the numerical multitude that
holds the substance of things. Therefore he called Idea one and many,
movable and immovable because as incorruptible species it is
intelligible and one, and as it communicates itself to matter and is
subject to movement and generation, it is sensible and many. In this
second mode it has more of non-entity than of entity; seeing that it is
one and another and is ever running but never diminishes. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) In the first mode it is an entity, and
true. See now, the mathematicians take it for granted, that the true
figures are not to be found in natural bodies, nor can they be there
through the power either of nature or of art. Yon know, besides, that
the truth (reality) of supernatural substances is above matter. We must
therefore conclude that he who seeks the truth must rise above the
reason of corporeal things. Besides which it must be considered, that he
who feeds bas a certain natural memory of his food, especially when it
is most required; it leaves in the mind the likeness and species of it,
in an elevated manner, according to

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

the elevation and glory of him who aims, and of that which is aimed at.
Hence it is that everything has, innate, the intelligence of those
things which belong to the conservation of the individual and species,
and furthermore its final perfection depends upon efforts to seek its
food through some kind of hunting or chase. Therefore it is necessary
that the human soul should have the light, the genius, and the
instruments suitable for its pursuit. And here contemplation comes to
aid, and logic, the fittest mode for the pursuit of truth, to find it,
to distinguish it, and to judge of it. So that one goes rambling amongst
the wild woods of natural things, where there are many objects under
shadow and mantle, for it is in a thick, dense, and deserted solitude
that Truth most often has its secret cavernous retreat, all entwined
with thorns and covered with bosky, rough and umbrageous plants; it is
hidden, for the most part, for the most excellent and worthy reasons,
buried and veiled with utmost diligence, just as we hide with the
greatest care the greatest treasures, so that, sought by a great variety
of hunters, of whom some are more able and expert, some less, it cannot
be discovered without great labour.

Pythagoras went seeking for it with his imprints and vestiges impressed
upon natural objects, which

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

are numbers, the which display its progress, reasons, modes and
operations in a certain manner, because in the number (of) multitude,
the number (of) measures, and the number (of) moment or weight, the
truth and Being are found in all things. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md)

Anaxagoras and Empedocles considered that the omnipotent and
all-producing divinity fills all things, and with them nothing was so
small that it did not contain within it the occult in every respect,
although they were always progressing onwards to where it was
predominant, and where it found a more magnificent and elevated
expression.

The Chaldeans sought for Truth by means of subtraction, not knowing how
to affirm anything about it; and proceeded without these dogs of
demonstrations and syllogisms, but solely forcing themselves to
penetrate by removing and digging and clearing away by means of
negations of every kind and discourses both open and secret.

Plato went twisting and turning and tearing to pieces and placing
embankments so that the volatile

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

and fugacious species should be as it were caught in a net and held
behind the hedges of definitions, and he considered that superior things
were, by participation, and according to similitude, reflected in those
inferior, and these in those according to their greater dignity and
excellence, and that the truth was in both the one and the other,
according to a certain analogy, order and scale, in which the lowest of
the superior order agrees with the highest of the inferior order. So
that progress was from the lowest of nature to the highest, as from evil
to good, from darkness to light, from the simple power to the simple
action.

Aristotle boasts of being able to arrive at the desired booty by means
of the imprints of tracks and vestiges, while he believes the effects
will lead to the cause, although he, above all others who have occupied
themselves with this sort of chase, has most deviated from the path, so
as to be able hardly to distinguish the footsteps. Theologians there
are, who, nourished in certain sects, seek the truth of nature in all
her specific natural forms in which they see the eternal essence, the
specific substantial perpetuator of the eternal generation and mutation
of things, which are called after their founders and

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

builders and above them all presides the form of forms, <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) the fountain of light, very truth of very
truth, God of gods, through whom all is full of divinity, truth, entity,
goodness. This truth is sought as a thing inaccessible, as an object not
to be objectized, incomprehensible. But yet, to no one does it seem
possible to see the sun, the universal Apollo, the absolute light
through supreme and most excellent species; but only its shadow, its
Diana, the world, the universe, nature, which is in things, light which
is in the opacity of matter, that is to say, so far as it shines in
darkness.

Many then wander amongst the aforesaid paths of this deserted wood, very
few are those who find the fountain of Diana. Many are content to hunt
for wild beasts and things less elevated, and the greater number do not
understand why, having spread their nets to the wind, they find their
hands full of flies. Rare, I say, are the Actæons to whom fate has
granted the power of contemplating the nude Diana and who, entranced
with the beautiful disposition of the body of nature, and led by those

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

two lights, the twin splendour of Divine goodness and beauty become
transformed into stags; for they are no longer hunters, but that which
is hunted. For the ultimate and final end of this sport, is to arrive at
the acquisition of that fugitive and wild. body, so that the thief
becomes the thing stolen, the hunter becomes the thing hunted; in all
other kinds of sport, for special things, the hunter possesses himself
of those things, absorbing them with the mouth of his own intelligence;
but in that Divine and universal one, he comes to understand to such an,
extent, that he becomes of necessity included, absorbed, united. Whence,
from common, ordinary, civil, and popular, he becomes wild, like a stag,
an inhabitant of the woods; he lives god-like under that grandeur of the
forest; he lives in the simple chambers of the cavernous mountains,
whence he beholds the great rivers; he vegetates intact and pure from
ordinary greed, where the speech of the Divine converses more freely, to
which so many men have aspired who longed to taste the Divine life while
upon earth, and who with one voice have said: Ecce, elongavi fugiens, et
mansi in solitudine. Thus the dogs--thoughts of Divine things---devour
Actæon, making him dead to the vulgar and the crowd, loosened from the
knots of perturbation of the

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

senses, free from the fleshly prison of matter, whence they no longer
see their Diana as thro <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) So that he
sees all as one; he sees no more by distinctions and numbers, which,
according to the different senses, as through various cracks, cause to
be seen and understood in confusion.

He sees Amphitrite, the source of all numbers, of all species, of all
reasons, which is the monad, the real essence of the being of all, and
if he does not see it in its essence, in absolute light, he sees it in
its seed, which is like unto it, which is its image; for from the monad,
which is the divinity, proceeds this monad which is nature, the
universe, the world, where it is beheld and reflected, as the sun is in
the moon by means of which it is illuminated; <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) he

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

finding himself in the hemisphere of intellectual substances. This is
that Diana, that one who is the same entity, that entity which is
comprehensible nature, in which burns the sun and the splendour of the
higher nature, according to which, unity is both the generated and the
generating, the producer and produced. Thus you can of yourself
determine the mode, the dignity, and the success, which are most worthy
of the hunter and the hunted. Therefore the enthusiast boasts of being
the prey of Diana, to whom he rendered himself, and of whom he considers
himself the accepted consort, and happy as a captive and a subject. Why,
he envies no man (for there is none that can have more) or any other god
that can have that species which is impossible to be obtained by an
inferior nature, and therefore is not worthy to be desired, nor can one
hunger after it.

CES. I have well understood all that you have said, and you have more
than satisfied me. Now it is time to return home.

MAR. Well.
