##### SECOND PART OF

###### THE

# HEROIC ENTHUSIASTS.

### First Dialogue.

*Interlocutors*: CESARINO. MARICONDO.

### I.

CES. It is said that the best and most excellent things are in the world
when the whole universe responds from every part, perfectly, to those
things; and this it is said takes place as the planets arrive at Aries,
being when that one of the eighth sphere again reaches the upper
invisible firmament, where is also the other Zodiac; <span
id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) and low and evil things

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

prevail when the opposite disposition and order supervene, and thus
through the power of change comes the continual mutation of like and
unlike, from one opposite to another. The revolution then of the great
year of the world is that space of time in which, through the most
diverse customs and, effects, and. by the most opposite and contrary
means, it returns to the same again. As we see in particular years such
as that of the sun, where the beginning of an opposite tendency is the
end. of one year, and the end of this is the beginning of that.
Therefore now that we have been in the dregs of the sciences, which have
brought forth the dregs of opinions, which are the cause of the dregs of
customs and, of works, we may certainly expect to return to the better
condition.

MARICONDO. Know, my brother, that this succession and order of things is
most true and most certain; but as regards ourselves in all ordinary
conditions whatever, the present afflicts more than the past, nor can
these two together console, but only the future, which is always in hope
and expectation as you may see designated in this figure which is taken
from the ancient Egyptians, who made a certain statue which is a bust,
upon which they placed three heads, one of a wolf which looks behind,
one

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

of a lion with the face turned half round, and the third of a dog who
looks straight before him; to signify that things of the past afflict by
means of thoughts, but not so much as things of the present which
actually torment, while the future ever promises something better;
therefore behold the wolf that howls, the lion that roars and the dog
that barks (applause).

CES. What means that legend that is written above?

MAR. See, that above the wolf is Lam, above the lion Modo, above the dog
Praeterea, which are words signifying the three parts of time.

CES. Now read the tablet.

MAR. I will do so.

41\.

A wolf, a lion, and a dog appear  
At dawn, at midday, and dark night.  
That which I spent, retain and for myself procure,  
So much was given, is given, and may be given;  
For that which I did, I do, and have to do.  
In the past, in the present and in the future,  
I do repent, torment myself and re-assure,  
For the loss, in suffering and in expectation.  
With sour, with bitter and with sweet  
Experience, the fruits, and hope,  
Threatens, afflict, and comforts me.  
The age I lived, do live and am to live,  
Affrights me, shakes me and upholds <span id="page_4">p. 4</span>  
In absence, presence and in prospect.  
Much, too much and sufficient  
Of the past, of now, and of to come,  
Pat me in fear, in anguish and in hope.

CES. This is precisely the humour of a furious lover, though the same
may be said of nearly all mortals who are seriously affected in any way.
We cannot say that this accords with all conditions in a general way,
but only with those mortals who were, and who are, wretched. So that to
him who sought a kingdom and obtained it, belongs the fear of losing the
same; and to one who has laboured to secure the fruits of love, such as
the special grace of the beloved, belongs the tooth of jealousy and
suspicion. Thus, too, with the states of the world; when we find
ourselves in darkness and in adversity we may surely prophecy light and
prosperity, and when we are in a state of happiness and discipline,
doubtless we have to expect the advent of ignorance and distress. As in
the case of Hermes Trismegistus, who, seeing Egypt in all the splendour
of the sciences and of occultism, so that he considered that men were
consorting with gods and spirits and were in consequence most pious, he
made that prophetic lament to Asclepios, saying that the darkness of new
religions and cults must follow, and that of the then present things
nothing would

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

remain but idle tales and matter for condemnation. So the Hebrews, when
they were slaves in Egypt, and banished to the deserts, were comforted
by their prophets with the hope of liberty and the reacquisition of
their country; when they were in authority and tranquillity they were
menaced with dispersion and captivity. And as in these days there is no
evil nor injury to which we are not subject, so there is no good nor
honour that we may not promise ourselves. Thus does it happen to all the
other generations and states, the which, if they endure and be not
destroyed entirely by the force of vicissitude, it is inevitable that
from evil they come to good, from good to evil, from low estate to high,
from high to low, out of obscurity into splendour, out of splendour into
obscurity, for this is the natural order of things; outside of which
order, if another should be found which destroys or corrects it, I
should believe it and not dispute it, for I reason with none other than
a natural spirit. <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

MAR. We know that you are not a theologian but a philosopher, and that
you treat of philosophy and not of theology.

CES. It is so. Bat let us see what follows.

### II.

CES. I see a smoking thurible, supported by an arm, and the legend which
says: "Illius aram," and then the following:--

42\.

Now who shall. say the breath of my desire  
Of high and holy worship is demeaned  
If decked in divers forms ornate she come  
Through vows I offer to the shrine of Fame?  
And if another work should call, and lead me on,  
Who would aver that more it might beseem  
If that, of Heaven so loved and eulogized,  
Should hold me not in its captivity.  
Leave, oh leave me, every other wish,  
Cease, fretting thoughts, and give me peace;  
Why draw me forth from looking at the sun,  
From looking at the sun that I so love.  
You ask in pity, wherefore lookest thou  
On that, on which to look is thy undoing?  
Wherefore so captivated by that light?  
And I will say, because to me this pain  
Is dearer than all other pleasures are.

MAR. In reference to this I told you that although one should be
attached to corporeal and

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

external beauty yet he may honourably and worthily be so attached;
provided that, through this material beauty, which is a glittering ray
of spiritual form and action, of which it is the trace and shadow, he
comes to raise himself to the consideration and worship of divine
beauty, light and majesty; so that, from these visible things his heart
becomes exalted towards those things which are more excellent in
themselves and grateful to the purified soul, in so far as they are
removed from matter and sense. Ah me! he will say, if beauty so shadowy,
so dim, so fugitive, painted on the surface of bodily matter pleases me
so much, and moves my affections so much, and stamps upon my spirit I
know not what of reverence for majesty, captivates me, softly binds me,
and draws me, so that I find nothing that comes within the senses that
satisfies me so much,--how will it be with the substantially,
originally, primitively beautiful? How will it be with my soul, the
divine intellect, and the law of nature? It is right, then, that the
contemplation of this vestige of light lead me, through the purification
of my soul, to the imitation, and to conformity and participation in
that which is more worthy, and higher, into which I am transformed and
unto which I unite myself: for I am certain

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

that nature, which has placed this beauty before my eyes and has gifted
me with an interior sense, through which I am able to infer a deeper and
incomparably greater beauty, wills that I be promoted to the altitude
and eminence of more excellent kinds. Nor do I believe that my true
divinity, as she shows herself to me in symbols and vestiges, will worn
me if in symbols and vestiges I honour her and sacrifice to her; as my
heart and affections are always so ordered as to look higher. For who
may he be, that can honour in essence and real substance, if in such
manner he cannot understand it?

It is in and through Symbols that man, consciously or unconsciously,
lives, works, and has his being. For is not a Symbol ever, to him who
has eyes for it, some dimmer or clearer revelation of the
Godlike?--("Sartor Resartus.")

CES. Right well do you demonstrate how, to men of heroic, spirit, all
things turn to good and how they are able to turn captivity into greater
liberty, and the being vanquished into an occasion for greater victory.
Well dost thou know that the love of corporeal beauty to those who are
well disposed, not only does not keep them back from higher enterprises,
but rather does it lend wings to arrive at these, when the necessity for
love is converted

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

into a study of the virtuous, through which the lover is forced into
those conditions in which he is worthy of the thing loved and perchance
of even a still higher, better and more beautiful thing; so that be
comes to be either contented to have gained that which he desires, or so
satisfied with its own beauty, that he can despise that of others, which
comes to be, by him, vanquished and overcome, so that he either remains
tranquil, or else he aspires to things more excellent and grand. And so
will the heroic spirit ever go on trying until it becomes raised to the
desire of divine beauty itself, without similitude, figure, symbol, or
kind, if it be possible, and what is more one knows that he will reach
that height.

MAR. You see, Cesarino, how this enthusiast is justified in his anger
against those who reproach him with being in captivity to a low beauty,
to which he dedicates his vows, and attributes these forms, so that he
is deaf to those voices which call him to nobler enterprises: for these
low things are derived from those, and are dependent upon them, so that
through these you may gain access to those, according to their own
degrees. These, if they be not God, are things divine, are living images
of Him, in the which, if He sees Himself

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

adored, He is not offended. For we have a charge from the supernal
spirit which says: Adorate sgabellum pedum eius. And in another place a
divine messenger says: Adorabimus ubi steterunt pedes eius.

CES. God, the divine beauty, and splendour shines and *is* in all
things; and therefore it does not appear to me an error to admire Him in
all things, according to the way in which we have communion with them.
Error it would surely be if we should give to another the honour due to
Him alone. But what means the enthusiast when he says, "Leave, leave me,
every other wish"?

MAR. That he banishes every thought presented to him by different
objects, which have not the power to move him and which would rob him of
the sight of the sun which comes to him through that window more than
through others.

CES. Why, importuned by thoughts, does he continually gaze at that
splendour which destroys him, and yet does not satisfy him, as it
torments him ever so fiercely?

MAR. Because all our consolations in this state of controversy are not
without their discouragements, however vast those consolations may be
just as the fear of a king for the loss of his kingdom,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

is greater than that of a mendicant who is in peril of losing ten
farthings; and more important is the care of a prince over a republic,
than that of a rustic over a herd of swine; as perchance the pleasures
and delights of the one are greater than the pleasures and delights of
the other. Therefore the loving and aspiring higher, brings with it
greater glory and majesty, with more care, thought, and pain: I mean in
this state, where the one opposite is always joined to the other,
finding the greatest contrariety always in the same genus, and
consequently about the same subject, although the opposites cannot be
together. And thus proportionally in the love of the supernal Eros, as
the Epicurean poet declares of vulgar and animal desire when he says:--

Fluctuat incertis erroribus ardor amantum,  
Nec constat, quid primum oculis, manibusque fruantur:  
Quod petiere, premunt arte, faciuntque dolorem  
Corporis, et dentes inlidunt saepe labellis,  
Osculaque adfigunt, quia non est pura voluptas,  
Et stimuli subsunt, qui instigant laedere id ipsum,  
Quodcunque est, rabies, unde illa haec germina surgant.  
Sed leviter poenas frangit Venus inter amorem,  
Blandaque refraenat morsus admixta voluptas;  
Namque in eo spes est, unde est ardoris origo,  
Restingui quoque posse ab eodem corpore flammam.

\[paragraph continues\] Behold, then, with what condiments the skill and

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

art of nature works, so that one is wasted with the pleasure of that
which destroys him, is happy in the midst of torment, and tormented in
the midst of all the satisfactions. For nothing is produced absolutely
from a homœogeneous (pacifico) principle, but all from opposite
principles, through the victory and dominion of one part of the
opposites, and there is no pleasure of generation on one side without
the pain of corruption on the other: and where these things which are
generated and corrupted are joined together and as it were compose the
same subject, the feeling of delight and of sadness are found together;
so that it comes to be called more easily delight than sadness, if it
happens that this predominates, and solicits the senses with greater
force.

### III.

CES. Now let us take into consideration the following image which is
that of a phœnix, which burns in the sun, and the smoke from which
almost obscures the brightness of that by which it is set on fire, and
here is the motto which says: Neque simile, nec par mar.

43\.

MAR.:

This phœnix set on fire by the bright sun,  
Which slowly, slowly to extinction goes, <span id="page_13">p.
13</span>  
The while she, girt with splendour burning lies;  
Yields to her star antagonistic fief  
Through that which towards the sky to Heaven ascends.  
Black smoke, and sombre fog of murky hue  
Concealing thus his radiance from our eyes,  
And veiling that which makes her burn and shine.  
And so my soul, illumined. and inflamed.  
By radiance divine, would fain display  
The brightness of her own effulgent thought;  
The lofty concept of her song sends forth.  
In words which do but hide the glorious light,  
 <span id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2.md) While I dissolve and melt and am
destroyed  
Ah me! this lowering cloud, this smoky fire of words  
Abases that which it would elevate.

CES. This fellow then says that as this phœnix act on fire by the sun
and accustomed to light and flame comes to send upwards that smoke which
obscures him who has rendered her so luminous, so he, the inflamed and
illuminated enthusiast, through that which he does in praise of such an
illustrious subject which has warmed his heart and which shines in his
thought, comes rather to conceal it than to render it light for light,
sending forth that

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

smoke the effect of the flame, in which the substance of himself is
resolved.

MAR. I, without weighing and comparing the studies of that fellow,
repeat what I said to you the other day, that praise is one of the
greatest oblations that human affection can offer to an object. And
leaving on one side the proposition of the Divine, tell me, who would
have known of Achilles, Ulysses, and all the other Greek and Trojan
chiefs? Who would have heard of all those great soldiers, the wise and
the heroes of the earth, if they had not been placed amongst the stars
and deified by the oblation of praise which has lighted the fire on the
altar of the heart of illustrious poets and other singers, so that
usually, the sacrificant, the victim and the sanctified deity, all
mounted to the skies, through the hand and the vow of a worthy and
lawful priest?

CES. Well sayest thou "of a worthy and lawful priest," for the world is
at present full of apostate ones, the which, as they are for the most
part unworthy themselves, sing the praises of other unworthy ones, so
that, asini asinos fricant. But Providence wills that these, instead of
rising to the sky should go together to the shades of Orcus, so that
naught is the glory of him who extols and of him

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

who is extolled; for the one has woven a statue of straw, or carved the
trunk of a tree, or cast a piece of chalk, and the other, the idol of
shame and infamy, knows not that there is no need to wait for the keen
tooth of the age and the scythe of Saturn in order to be put down, for
through those self-same praises he gets buried alive then and there,
while he is being praised, saluted, hailed, and presented. Just as it
happened in a contrary way, so that much-praised Mœcenatus, who, if he
had had no other glory than a soul inclined to protect and favour the
Muses, for this alone merited, that the genius of so many illustrious
poets should do him homage, and place him in the number of the most
famous heroes who have trod this earth. His own studies and his own
brightness made him prominent and grand, and not the being born of a
royal race, and not the being grand secretary and councillor of
Augustus. That, I say, which made him illustrious was the having made
himself worthy to fulfil the promise of that poet who says:--

Fortunati ambo, si quid mea carmina possunt,  
Nulla dies nunquam memori vos eximet sevo,  
Dum domus Aeneae Capitoli immobile saxum  
Accolet, imperiumque pater romanus habebit.

MAR. I remember what Seneca says in certain

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

letters where he refers to the words of Epicurus to a friend, which are
these: "If the love of glory is dear to thy breast, these letters of
mine will make thee more famous and known than all those other things
which thou honourest, by which thou art honoured, and of which thou
mayest boast. The same might Homer have said if Achilles or Ulysses had
presented themselves before him, or Eneas and his offspring before
Virgil; as that moral philosopher well said; Domenea is more known
through the letters of Epicurus, than all the magicians, satraps and
royalties upon whom depended his title of Domenea and the memory of whom
was lost in the depths of oblivion. Atticus does not survive because he
was the son-in-law of Agrippa and ancestor of Tiberius, but through the
epistles of Tully; Drusus, the ancestor of Cæsar, would not be found
amongst the number of great names if Cicero had not inserted it. Many,
many years may pass over our heads, and in all that time not many
geniuses will keep their heads raised.

Now to return to the question of this enthusiast, who, seeing a phœnix
set on fire by the sun, calls to mind his own cares, and laments that
like the phœnix he sends, in exchange for the light and heat received, a
sluggish smoke from the holocaust of

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

his melted substance. Wherefore not only can we never discourse about
things divine, but we cannot oven think of them without detracting from,
rather than adding to the glory of them; so that the best thing to be
done with regard to them is, that man, in the presence of other men,
should rather praise himself for his earnestness and courage, than give
praise to anything, as complete and perfected action; seeing that no
such thing can be expected where there is progress towards the infinite,
where unity and infinity are the same thing and cannot be followed by
the other number, because there is no unity from another unity, nor is
there number from another number and unity, because they are not the
same absolute and infinite. Therefore was it well said by a theologian
that as the fountain of light far exceeds not only our intellects, but
also the divine, it is decorous that one should not discourse with
words, but that with silence alone it should be magnified. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

CES. Not, verily, with such silence as that of the brutes who are in the
likeness and image of men, but of those whose silence is more exalted
than all. the cries and noise and screams of those who may be
heard. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

### IV.

MAR. Let us go on and see what the rest means.

CES. Say, if you have seen and considered it, what is the meaning of
this fire in the form of a heart with four wings, two of which have eyes
and the whole is girt with luminous rays and has round about it this
question: Nitimur incassum?

MAR. I remember well, that it signifies the state of the mind, heart and
spirit and eyes of the enthusiast, but read the sonnet!

44\.

 <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md) Splendour divine, to which this mind
aspires,  
The intellect alone cannot unveil.  
The heart, which those high thoughts would animate,  
Makes not itself their lord; nor spirit, which <span id="page_19">p.
19</span>  
Should cease from pleasure for a space,  
Can ever from those heights withdraw.  
The eyes which should be closed at night in sleep,  
Awake remain, open, and full of tears.  
Ah me, my lights! where are the zeal and art  
With which to tranquillize the afflicted sense?  
Tell me my soul; what time and in what place  
Shall I thy deep transcendent woo assuage?  
And thou my heart, what solace can I bring  
As compensation to thy heavy pain?  
When, oh unquiet and perturbed mind,  
Wilt thou the soul for debt and dole receive  
With heart, with spirit and the sorrowing eyes?

The mind which aspires to the divine splendour flees from the society of
the crowd and retires from the multitude of subjects, as much as from
the community of studies, opinions and sentences; seeing that the peril
of contracting vices and illusions is greater, according to the number
of persons with whom one is allied. In the public shows, said the moral
philosopher, by means of pleasure, vices are more easily engendered. If
one aspires to the supreme splendour, let him retire as much as he can,
from union and support, into himself (Di sorte che non sia simile a
molti, per che son molti; e non sia nemico di molti per che son
dissimili), so that he be not like unto many, because they are many; and
be not adverse to many, because they are dissimilar; if it be possible,
let him retain

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

the one and the other; otherwise he will incline to that which seems to
him best. Let him associate either with those whom he can make better or
with those through whom he may be made better, through brightness which
he may impart to those or that he may receive from them. Let him he
content with one ideal rather than with the inept multitude. Nor will he
hold that he has gained little, when he has become such an one who is
wise unto himself, remembering what Democritus says: "Unus mihi pro
populo est, et populus pro uno; and what Epicurus said to a companion of
his studies, writing to him: "Haec tibi, non multis! Satis enim magnum
alter alteri theatrum sumus."

The mind, then, which aspires high, leaves, for the first thing, caring
about the crowd, considering that that divine light despises striving
and is only to be found where there is intelligence, and yet not every
intelligence, but that which is amongst the few, the chief. the first
among the first, the principal one.

CES. How do you mean that the mind aspires high? For example, by looking
at the stars? At the empyreal heaven above the ether?

MAR. Certainly not! but by plunging into the depths of the mind, for
which there is no great need to open the eyes to the sky, to raise the
hands,

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

to direct the steps to the temple, nor sing to the ears of statues in
order to be the better heard, but to come into the inner self believing
that, God is near, present and within, more fully than man himself,
 <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) being soul of souls, life of lives,
essence of essences: for that which you see above or below, or round
about, or however you please to say it, of the stars, are bodies, are
created things, similar to this globe on which we are, and in which the
divinity is present neither more nor less than he is in this globe of
ours or in ourselves. This is how, then, one must begin to withdraw
oneself from the multitude into oneself. One ought to arrive at such a
point to despise and not to overestimate every labour, so that, the more
the desires and the vices contend with each other inwardly and the
vicious enemies dispute outwardly, so much the more should one breathe
and rise, and with spirit, if possible, surmount this steep hill. Here
there is no need for other arms and shield than the majesty of an
unconquered soul and a tolerant spirit, which maintains the quality and
meaning of that life which proceeds from science and is regulated by the
art of

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

considering attentively things low and high, divine and human, in the
which consists that highest good, and in reference to this, a moral
philosopher wrote to Lucillus that one must not linger between Scylla
and Charybdis, penetrate the wilds of Candavia and the Apennines or lose
oneself in the sandy plains, because the road is as sure and as blythe
as Nature herself could make it. "It is not," says he, "gold and silver
that makes one like God, because these are not treasure to Him; nor
vestments, for God is naked; nor ostentation and fame, for He shows
Himself to few, and perhaps not one knows Him, and certainly many, and
more than many, have a bad opinion of Him. Not all the various
conditions of things which we usually admire, for not those things of
which we desire to have copies, make one rich, but the contempt for
those things."

CES. Well. Bat tell me in what manner will this fellow tranquillize the
senses, assuage the woes of the spirit, compensate the heart and give
its just debts to the mind, so that with this aspiration of his he come
not to say: "Nitimur incassum"?

MAR. He will be present in the body in such wise that the best part of
himself will be absent from it, and will join himself by an indissoluble
sacrament to divine things, in such a way that he will not feel

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

either love or hatred of things mortal. Considering himself as master,
and that he ought not to be servant and slave to his body, which he
would regard only as the prison which holds his liberty in confinement,
the glue which smears his wings, chains which bind fast his hands,
stocks which fix his feet, veil which hides his view. Let him not be
servant, captive, ensnared, chained, idle, stolid and blind, for the
body which he himself abandons cannot tyrannize over him, so that thus,
the spirit in a certain degree comes before him as the corporeal world,
and matter is subject to the divinity and to nature. Thus will he become
strong against fortune, magnanimous towards injuries, intrepid towards
poverty, disease and persecution.

CES. Well is the heroic enthusiast instructed!

V.

CES. Close by is to be seen that which follows. See the wheel of time,
which moves round its own centre, and there is the legend. "Manens
moveor." What do you mean by that?

MAR. This means that movement is circular where motion concurs with
rest, seeing that in orbicular motion upon its own axis and about its
own centre is understood rest and stability according to right

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

movement, or, rest of the whole and movement of the parts; and from the
parts which move in a circle is understood two different kinds of
motion, inasmuch as some parts rise to the summit and others from the
summit descend to the base successively; others reach the medium
differences, and others the extremes of high and low. And all this seems
to me suitably expressed in the following:

45\.

That which keeps my heart both open and, concealed,  
Beauty imprints and honesty dispels;  
Zeal holds me fast; all other care comes to me  
By that same path whence all care to the soul doth come:  
Seek I myself from pain to disengage,  
Hope sustains me then whose scourges, tires;--(altrui rigor mi lassa)  
Love doth exalt and reverence abase me  
What time I yearn towards the highest good.  
High thoughts, holy desires, and mina intent  
Upon the labours and the cunning of the heart  
Towards the immense divine immortal object,  
So do, that I be joined, united, fed,  
That I lament no more; that reason, sense, attend,  
Discourse and penetrate to other things.

SO that the continual movement of one part supposes and carries with it
the movement of the whole, in such a way that the attraction of the
posterior parts is consequent upon the repulsion of the

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

anterior parts; thus the movement of the superior parts results of
necessity from that of the inferior, and from the raising of one
opposite power, follows the depression of the other opposite. Therefore
the heart, which signifies all the affections generally, comes to be
concealed and open, held by zeal, raised by magnificent thoughts,
sustained by hope, weakened by fear, and in this state and condition
will it ever be seen and found.

VI\.

CES. That is all well. Let us come to that which follows. I see a ship
floating on the waves; its ropes are attached to the shore and there is
the legend. Fluctuat in portu. Deliberate about the signification of
this, and when you are decided about it, explain.

MAR. Both the legend and the figure have a certain connexion with the
present legend and figure, m may be easily understood, if one considers
it a little. But let us read the sonnet.

46\.

If I by gods, by heroes and by men  
Be re-assured, so that I not despair,  
Nor fear, pain, nor the impediments  
Of death of body, joy and happiness, <span id="page_26">p. 26</span>  
Yet must I learn to suffer and to feel.  
And that I may my pathways clearly see,  
Let doubts arise, and dolour, and the woe  
Of vanished hopes, of joy and all delight.  
But if he should behold, should grant, and should attend  
My thoughts, my wishes, and my reasoning,  
Who makes them so uncertain, hot, and vague,  
Such dear conceits, such acts and speech,  
Will not be given nor done to him, who stays  
From birth, through life, to death in sheltered home.

Non dà, non fa, non ha qualunque stassi  
Do l'orto, vita e morte a le magioni.

From what we have considered and said in the preceding discourses one is
able to understand these sentiments, especially where it is shown that
the sense of low things is diminished and annulled whenever the superior
powers are strongly intent upon a more elevated and heroic object. The
power of contemplation is so great, as is noted by Jamblichus, that it
happens sometimes, not only that the soul ceases from inferior acts, but
that it leaves the body entirely. The which I will not understand
otherwise than in such various ways as are explained in the book of
thirty seals, wherein are produced so many methods of contraction, of
which some infamously, others heroically operate, that one learns not to
fear death, suffers not pain of body, feels not the hindrances of
pleasures:

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

wherefore the hope, the joy, and the delight of the superior spirit are
of so intense a kind that they extinguish all those passions which may
have their origin in doubt, in pain and all kinds of sadness.

CES. But what is that, of which he requests that it consider those
thoughts which it has rendered so uncertain, fulfil those desires which
it has made so ardent, and listen to those discourses which it has
rendered so vague?

MAR. He means the Object, which he beholds when it makes itself present;
for to see the Divine is to be seen by it, as to see the sun concurs,
with the being seen of the sun. Equally, to be heard by the Divine, is
precisely to listen to it, and to be favoured by it, is the same as to
offer to it; for from the one immoveable and the same, proceed thoughts
uncertain and certain, desires ardent and appeased, and reasonings valid
and vain, according as the man worthily or unworthily puts them before
himself, with the intellect, the affections and actions. As that same
pilot may be said to be the cause of the sinking or of the safety of the
ship, according as he is present in it or absent from it; with this
difference, that the pilot through his defectiveness or his efficiency
ruins or saves the ship; but the Divine potency which is all in all does
not proffer

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

or withhold except through assimilation or rejection by oneself. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7.md)

### VII.

MAR. It seems to me that the following figure is closely connected and
linked with the above; there are two stars in the form of two radiant
eyes, with the legend: Mors et vita.

CES. Read the sonnet!

MAR. I will do so:

47\.

Writ by the hand of Love may each behold  
Upon my face the story of my woes.  
But thou, so that thy pride no curb may know,  
And I, unhappy one, eternally might rest,  
Thou dost torment, by hiding from my view  
Those lovely lights beneath the beauteous lids.  
Therefore the troubled sky's no more serene,  
Nor hostile baleful shadows fall away.  
By thine own beauty, by this love of mine  
(So great that e'en with this it may compare),  
Render thyself, oh Goddess, unto pity!  
Prolong no more this all-unmeasured woe,  
Ill-timed reward for such a love as this.  
Let not such rigour with such splendour mate  
If it import thee that I live!  
Open, oh lady, the portals of thine eyes,  
And look on me if thou wouldst give me death!

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Here, the face upon which the story of his woes
appears is the soul, in so far as it is open to receive those superior
gifts, for the which it has a potential aptitude, without the fulness of
perfection and act which waits for the dew of heaven. Thus was it well
said. Anima mea sicut terra siue aqua tibi; and again: Os meum operui;
and again: Spiritum, quia mandata tua desiderabam. Then, "pride which
knows no curb" is said in metaphor and similitude, as God is sometimes
said to be jealous, angry, or that He sleeps, and that signifies the
difficulty with which He grants so much even as to show his shoulders,
which is the making himself known by means of posterior things and
effects. So the lights are covered with the eyelids, the troubled sky of
the human mind does not clear itself by the removal of the metaphors and
enigmas. Besides which, because he does not believe that all which is
not, could not be, he prays the divine light, that by its beauty, which
ought not to be entirely concealed, at least according to the capacity
of whoever beholds it, and by his love, which, perchance, is equal to so
much beauty (equal, he means, of the beauty, in so far as he can
comprehend it) that it surrender itself to pity, that is, that it should
do as those who are compassionate, and who from being capricious

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

and gloomy become gracious and affable and that it prolong not the evil
which results from that privation, and not allow that its splendour, for
which it is so much desired, should appear greater than that love by
means of which it communicates itself, seeing that in it all the
perfections are not only equal but are also the same. In fine, he begs
that it will no further sadden by privation, for it can kill with the
glance of its eyes and can also with those same give him life.

CES. Does he mean that death of lovers, which comes from intense joy,
called by the Kabalists, mors osculi, which same is eternal life, which
a man may anticipate in this life and enjoy in eternity?

MAR. He does.

### VIII.

MAR. It is time to proceed to the consideration of the following design,
similar to those previously brought forward, and with which it has a
certain affinity. There is an eagle, which with two wings cleaves the
sky; but I do not know how much and in what manner it comes to be
retarded by the weight of a stone which is tied to its leg. There is the
legend: Scinditur incertum. It is certain that it signifies the
multitude, number and character

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (volgo) of the powers of the soul, to exemplify
which, that verse is taken: Scinditur incertum studia in contraria
vulgus. The whole of which character (volgo) in general is divided into
two factions; although subordinate to these, others are not wanting, of
which some appeal to the high intelligence and splendour of rectitude,
while others incite and force in a certain manner to the low, to the
uncleanness of voluptuousness and compliance with natural desires.
Therefore says the sonnet:

48\.

I would do well--to me 'tis not allowed.  
With me my sun is not, although I be with him,  
For being with him, I'm no more with myself:  
The farther from myself-the nearer unto him;  
The nearer unto him, the farther from myself.  
Once to enjoy, doth cost me many tears,  
And seeking happiness, I meet with woo.  
For that I look aloft, so blind am I.  
That I may gain my love, I lose myself.  
Through bitter joy, and through sweet pain,  
Weighted with lead, I rise towards the sky.  
Necessity withholds, goodness conducts me on,  
Fate sinks me down, and counsel raises me,  
Desire spurs me, fear keeps me in cheek.  
Care kindles and the peril backward draws.  
Ten me, what power or what subterfuge  
Can give me peace and bring me from this strife,  
If one repels, the other draws me on.

The ascension goes on in the soul through the

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

power and appulsion in the wings, which are the intellect, or
intellectual will upon which she naturally depends and through which she
fixes her gaze toward God, as to the highest good, and primal truth, as
to absolute goodness and beauty. Thus everything has an impetus towards
its beginning retrogressively, and progressively towards its end and
perfection, as Empedocles well said, and from which sentence I think may
be inferred that which the Nolan said in this octave:

The sun must turn and reach his starting-point,  
Each wandering light must go towards its source,  
That which is earth to earth itself reverts,  
The rivers from the sea to sea return,  
And thither, whence desires have life and grow  
Must they aspire as to revered divinity,  
So every thought born of my lady fair  
Comes back perforce to her, my goddess dear.

\[paragraph continues\] The intellectual power is never at rest, it is
never satisfied with any comprehended truth, but ever proceeds on and on
towards that truth which is not comprehended. So also the will which
follows the apprehension, we see that it is never satisfied with
anything finite. In consequence of this, the essence of the soul is
always referred to the source of its substance and entity. Then as to
the natural powers, by means of which it is turned to the

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

protection and government of matter, to which it allies itself, and by
appulsion benefits and communicates of its perfection to inferior
things, through the likeness which it has to the Divine, which in its
benignity communicates itself or produces infinitely, *i.e.* imparts
existence to the universal infinite and to the innumerable worlds in it,
or, finitely, produces this universe alone, subject to our eyes and our
common reason. Thus then in the one sole essence of the soul are found
these two kinds of powers, and as they are used for one's own good and
for the good of others, it follows that they are depicted with a pair of
wings, by means of which it is potent towards the object of the primal
and immaterial potencies, and with a heavy stone, through which it is
active and efficacious towards the objects of the secondary and material
potencies. Whence it follows that the entire affection of the enthusiast
is bifold, divided, harassed, and placed in a position to incline itself
more easily downwards than to force itself upwards: seeing that the soul
finds itself in a low and hostile country, and reaches the far-off
region of its more natural home where its powers are the weakest.

CES. Do you think that this difficulty can be overcome?

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

MAR. Perfectly well; but the beginning is most difficult, and according
as we make more and more fruitful progress in contemplation we arrive at
a greater and greater facility. As happens to whoever flys up high, the
more he rises above the earth the more air he has beneath to uphold him,
and consequently the less he is affected by gravitation; he may even
rise so high that he cannot, without the labour of cleaving the air,
return downwards, although one might imagine it were more easy to cleave
the air downwards towards the earth than to rise on high towards the
stars.

CES. So that with progress of this kind a greater and greater facility
is acquired for mounting on high?

MAR. So it is; therefore well said Tansillo:--

"The more I feel the air beneath my feet  
So much the more towards the wind I bend  
My swiftest pinions  
And spurn the world and up towards Heaven I go."

\[paragraph continues\] As every part of bodies and of their elements,
the nearer they come to their natural place, the greater the impetus and
force with which they move, until at last, whether they will or not,
they must prevail. That which we see then in the parts of bodies and in
the bodies themselves we ought also to allow of

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

intellectual things towards their proper objects, as their proper
places, countries, and ends. Whence you may easily comprehend the entire
significance of the figure, the legend, and the verses.

CES. So much so that whatsoever you might add thereto would appear to me
superfluous.

### IX.

CES. Let us see what is here represented by those two radiating arrows
upon a target around, which is written: Vicit instans.

MAR. The continual struggle in the soul of the enthusiast, the which, in
consequence of the long familiarity which it had with matter was hard
and incapable of being penetrated by the rays of the splendour of the
Divine intelligence and the species of the Divine goodness; during which
time, he says that the heart was enamelled with diamond, that is, the
affection was hard and not capable of being heated and penetrated, and
it rejected the blows of love which assailed it on innumerable sides.
That is, it did not feel itself wounded by those wounds of eternal life
of which the Psalmist speaks when he says: Vulnerasti cor meum, o
dilecta, vulnerasti cor meum. The which wounds are not from iron or
other material through the vigour and strength of

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

nerves, but are darts of Diana, or of Phœbus, that is, either from the
goddess of the deserts--of contemplation of truth, that is, from Diana,
who is the order of the second intelligences, which transfer the
splendour received from the first and communicate, it to the others. who
are deprived of a more open vision; or else from the principal god
Apollo, who, with his own, and not a borrowed splendour, sends his
darts, that is, his rays, so many and from such innumerable points,
which are all the species of things, which are indications of Divine
goodness, intelligence, beauty, and wisdom. according to the, various
degrees, from the simple comprehension, to the becoming heroic
enthusiasts; because the adamantine subject does not reflect from its
surface, the impression of the light, but, destroyed and overcome by the
heat and light, it becomes in substance luminous--all light--so that it
is penetrated within the affection and conception. This is not
immediately, at the beginning of generation, when the soul comes forth
fresh from the intoxication of Lethe, and drenched with the waves of
forgetfulness and confusion, so that the spirit comes into captivity to
the body, and is put into the condition of growth; but little by little,
it goes on digesting, so as to become fitted for

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

the action of the sensitive faculty, until, through the rational and
discursive faculty, it comes to a purer intellectual one, so that it can
present itself to the mind, without feeling itself be. fogged by the
exhalations of that humour, which, through the exercise of
contemplation, has been saved from putrefaction in the stomach and is
duly digested. In this state, the present enthusiast shows himself to
have remained thirty years, during which time he had not reached that
purity of conception which would make him a suitable habitation for the
wandering species, which offering themselves to all, equally, knock,
ever at the door of the intelligence. At last, Love, who in various ways
and at different times had assaulted him as it were in vain--as the
light and heat of the sun are said to be useless to those who are in the
opaque depths and bowels of the earth--having located itself in those
sacred lights, that is having shown forth the Divine Beauty through two
intelligible species the which bound his intellect through the reasoning
of Truth and warmed his affections through the reasoning of Goodness;
while the material and sensitive desires became superseded, which
aforetime used, as it were, to triumph, remaining intact,
notwithstanding the excellence of the soul. Because those lights which

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

made present the illuminating, acting intellect and sun of intelligence
found easy ingress through his eyes; that of Truth (the intellect of
Truth?) through the door of the intellectual faculty; that of
Goodness(intellect of Goodness?) through the door of the appetitive
faculty, to the heart, that is, the substance of the general affection.
This was that double ray, which came as from the hand of an irate
warrior, who showed himself, now, as ready and as bold, as; aforetime he
had appeared weak and negligent. <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)

Then, when he first felt warmed and illuminated in his conception, was
that victorious point and moment of which it is said: Vicit instans.

Thus you can understand the sense of the following figure, legend and
sonnet, which says:--

49\.

I fought with all my strength 'gainst Love Divine  
When he assailed with blows from every side  
This cold, enamelled, adamantine heart,  
Whence my desires defeated his intent.  
At last, one day, 'twas as the heavens had willed.  
Encamped I found him in those holy lights  
Which, through mine own alone, of all the rest  
An easy entrance to my heart could find.  
'Twas then upon me fell that double bolt, <span id="page_39">p.
39</span>  
Flung as from hand of irate warrior  
Who had for thirty years besieged in vain.  
He marked that place and strongly there he held,  
Planted the trophy there, and evermore  
He holds my fleet wings in restrainment.  
Meanwhile since then with more solemnity of preparation  
The anger and the ire of my sweet enemy  
Cease not to wound my heart.

Rare moment was that; the end of the beginning and perfection of
victory; rare were those two species which amongst all others found easy
entrance, seeing that they contain in themselves the efficacy and the
virtue of all the others; for what higher and more excellent form can
present itself than that of the beauty, goodness and truth, which are
the source of every other truth, beauty, and goodness? "He marked that
place"--that is, took possession of the affections, noted them, and
impressed upon them his own character; "and strongly there he held;" he
confirmed and established them and sanctified them so that he can never
again lose them; for it is not possible that one should turn to love any
other thing when once he has conceived in his mind the Divine Beauty,
and it is as impossible that he can do other than love it, as it is
impossible that his desires should fall otherwise than towards good, or
species of good. Therefore his inclination

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

is in the highest degree towards the primal good. So again, the wings,
which used to be so fleet to go downwards with the weight of matter, are
kept in restrainment, and the sweet angers which are the efficacious
assaults of the gracious enemy, who has been for so long time kept back,
and excluded, a stranger and a pilgrim, never cease to wound, soliciting
the affections and awakening thought. Bat now, the sole and entire
possessor and disposer of the soul, for she neither wills nor wishes to
will other, nor is she pleased, nor will she that any other please her,
whence he often says:--

Dolci ire, guerra dolce, dolci dardi,  
Dolci mie piaghe, miei dolci dolori!

### X.

CES. It would seem that we have nothing more to consider upon this
proposition. Let us see now, how this quiver and bow of Bros display the
sparks around, and the knot of the string, which hangs, down with the
legend, which is: Subito, clam.

MAR. Well do I remember having seen it expressed in the sonnet. But let
us read it first.

50\.

Eager to find the much desired food,  
The eagle towards the sky spreads out his wings  
And wafts of his approach both bird and beast, <span id="page_41">p.
41</span>  
The third flight bringing him upon the prey.  
And the fierce lion roaring from his lair  
Spreads horror all around and mortal fear;  
And all wild beasts, admonished and forewarned,  
Fly to the caves and cheat his cruel jaw.  
The whale, ere he the dumb Protean herd  
Hungry pursues, sends forth his nuncio,  
From caves of Thetys spouts his water forth.  
Lions and eagles of the earth and sky,  
And whales, lords of the seas, come not with treachery,  
But the assaults of Love come stealing secretly.

The animal kingdom is divided into three, and is composed of various
elements: the earth, the water, the air, and there are three
species--beasts, fishes, and birds. Into three kinds are the principles
of nature settled and defined, in the air the eagle, on earth the lion,
in the water the whale; of the which, each one, as it displays more
strength and. command over the others, makes a show of magnanimous
action. or apparently magnanimous. Therefore it is observed, that the
lion, before he starts on the hunt trumpets forth his roar, which
resounds through the whole forest, like to the poetic
[description](errata.htm#1.md) of the fury-hunter.

At saeva e speculis tempus dea nacta, nocendi,  
Ardua tecta petit, stabuli et de culmine summo  
Pastorale canit signum, cornuque recurvo  
Tartaream intendit vocem, qua protinus omne  
Contremuit nemus, et silvae intonuere profandae.

 

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

The eagle again, before he proceeds to his venery, first rises straight
from the nest in a perpendicular line upwards, and generally speaking at
the third time he swoops from above with greater impetus and swiftness
than if he were flying in a direct line, so that at the time when be is
gaining the greatest velocity of flight, he is able also to speculate
upon his success with the prey, and after three inspections he knows
whether be will succeed or fail.

CES. Can one imagine why, if at the first his prey presents itself
before his eyes, he does not instantly pounce upon it?

MAR. No; unless it be to see whether anything better, or more easily
taken, comes to sight, At the, same time I do not believe that this is
always so, but most often. it is. But to return. Of the whale it is
manifest that, being such a huge animal, he cannot divide the waters
without making his presence known through the repulsion of the waves,
besides which there are several species of this fish, that when they
move or breathe, spout forth a windy tempest of water. Thus from these
three, principal species of animals, the inferior kinds have warning to
enable them to get away, so that they do not conduct themselves as
deceivers and traitors. But Love, who is stronger and greater and who
has

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

supreme dominion in heaven, on earth, and in the seas, and who in
comparison ought perhaps to show greater magnanimity, as he also has
more power, does nothing of the kind, but assaults and wounds suddenly
and swiftly.

Labitur totas furor in medullas,  
Igne furtivo populante venas,  
Nec habet latum data plaga frontem;  
Sed vorat tectas penitas medullas,  
Virginum ignoto ferit igne pectus.

\[paragraph continues\] As you perceive, the tragic poet calls him a
furtive fire, an unknown flame. Solomon calls it furtive waters. Samuel
named it the whisper of a gentle wind. The which three significations
show with what sweetness, gentleness, and astuteness, in seas, on earth,
in sky, does this fellow come and tyrannize over the whole universe.

CES. There is no vaster empire, no worse tyranny, no better dominion, no
more necessary magistracy, nothing more sweet and dear, no food to be
found more hard and bitter, no deity more violent, no god more pleasing,
no agent more treacherous and false, no author more regal and faithful,
and, in fine, it seems to me that Love is all and does all, of him all
may be said, and all may refer itself to him.

MAR. You say well. Love then, as he who works

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

chiefly through the sight, which is the most spiritual of all the
senses, and which reaches swiftly the known ends of the earth, and
without stretch of time takes in the whole horizon of the visible, comes
to be quick, furtive, sudden and instantaneous. Besides which, we must
remember what the ancients say, that Love precedes all the other gods,
and therefore it is no use to imagine that Saturn shows him the way
except by following him. Now must we find out, whether Love appears and
makes himself known externally, whether his home is the soul itself, his
bed the heart itself, and whether he consists of the same composition as
our own substance, the same impulse as our own powers. Finally
everything naturally desires the beautiful and the good, and therefore
it is useless to argue and discuss, because the affection informs and
confirms itself, and in one instant desire joins itself to the
desirable, as the sight to the visible.

### XI.

CES. Let us see here, what is the meaning of that burning arrow, around
which is the legend: Cui nova plaga loco? Explain what part does this
seek to wound?

MAR. Read the sonnet which says:--

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

That all the ears of corn that may be reaped  
In burning Apuleia, or sunbrowned Lybia,  
With all that they unto the winds entrust,  
Or that the rays from the great planet sent,  
Should number those sad pains of my glad soul,  
Which she from those two burning stars receives  
With mournful joy in sweetest agony,  
Forbid me Sense and Reason to believe.  
What would'st thou more, sweet foe?  
What wish is that which moves thee still to hurt,  
Since this my heart of but one wound is made?  
So that there lies no part that now may be  
By thee or others printed, stabbed, or pierced,  
Turn thee aside, turn otherwhere thy bow,  
For thou dost waste thy powers, oh beauteous god!  
In slaying him who lies already dead.

\[paragraph continues\] The meaning of all this is metaphorical, like
the rest, and may be understood in the same sense as that. Here the
number of darts which have wounded and do wound the heart, signify the
innumerable individuals and species of things, in which shine the
splendour of Divine Beauty, according to their degrees and whence the
affection for the good, well proposed and well apprehended warms us. The
which throng the causes of potentiality and actuality, of possibility
and of effect, crucify and console, give the sense of sweetness and also
make the bitter to be felt. But where the entire affection is all turned
toward God that is towards the Idea of Ideas, from the

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

light of intelligible things, the mind becomes exalted to the
super-essential unity, and.. all love, all one, it feels itself no
longer solicited by various objects, which distract it, but is one sole
wound, in the which the whole affection concurs and which comes to be
one and. the same affection. Then there is no love or desire of any
particular thing, that can urge, nor even present itself before the
will; for there is nothing more straight than the straight, nothing more
beautiful than beauty, nothing better than goodness, nothing can be
found larger than size, nor anything lighter than that light which with
its presence darkens and obliterates all lights.

CES. To the perfect, if it be perfect, there is nothing that can be
added; therefore the will is not capable of any other desire, when that
which is of the perfect is present with it, highest and best. Therefore
I understand the conclusion where be says to Love, "Turn otherwhere thy
bow," and wherefore should he try to kill him who is already dead, that
is, he, who has no more life nor sense about other things, so that he
cannot be stabbed or pierced or become exposed to other species. And
this lame proceeds from him, who having tasted of the highest unity,
desires to be in all things severed and withdrawn from the multitude.

MAR. You understand quite well.

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

### XII.

CES. Now here is a boy in a boat, which little by little is being
submerged in the tempestuous waves, and he, languid and tired, has
abandoned the oars; around it the legend "Fronti nulla fides." There is
no doubt that this signifies that he was induced, by the serene aspect
of the waters, to venture on the treacherous sea, which having suddenly
become troubled, the boy, in mortal fear, and in his impotence to still
the tempest, has lost his head, his hope, and the power of his arm. But
let us see the rest:--

52\.

Oh, gentle boy, that from the shore didst loose  
The baby bark, and to the slender oar  
Didst set thy unskilled hand; lured by the sea!  
Late hast thou seen the evil of thy plight.  
See there the traitor rolls his fatal waves,  
The prow of thy frail bark, now sinks, now mounts.  
The soul borne down with anxious cares  
Prevaileth not against the swollen floods.  
Thy oars thou yieldst to thy fierce enemy,  
Waiting for death with calm collected thought,  
With eyelids closed, lest thou shouldst see him come.  
If thee no friendly aid should quickly reach  
Thou surely must the full result soon feel,  
Of thy inquisitive temerity.  
My cruel fate is like unto thine own,  
For I too, lured, enticed by Love, must feel,  
The rigour keen of this most treacherous one.

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

In what manner and why Love is a traitor and deceiver we have just seen;
but as I see the following without figure or legend, I believe that it
must have connection with the above. Therefore let us go on and read it.

53\.

Methought to leave the shelter of my port,  
And from maturer studies rest awhile:  
When, looking round me to enjoy my ease,  
Sudden I saw those unrelenting fates.  
These have inflamed me with so ardent fires.  
Vainly I strive some safer shores to reach,  
Vainly from pitying hands invoke some aid,  
And swift deliverance from my enemies.  
Weary and hoarse I yield me, impotent,  
And seek no more to elude my destiny,  
Or make endeavour to escape my death:  
Let every other life to me be null,  
And let not the extremest torment fail,  
Which my hard fate for me prescribed.  
Type of my own deep ills,  
Is that which thou for pastime didst entrust  
To hostile breast. Oh, careless boy.

Here I would not pretend to understand or determine all that the
enthusiast means. Yet there is well expressed the strange condition of a
soul cast down by the knowledge of the difficulty of the operation, the
amount of the labour, the vastness of the work on one side, and on the
other the ignorance, want of knowledge of the way, weakness of nerves
and

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

peril of death. He has no knowledge suitable to the business, he does
not know where and how to turn, no place of flight or refuge presents
itself; and he sees that, from every side, the waves threaten, with
frightful, fatal impetus. Ignoranti portum, nullus suus ventas est.
Behold him, who has committed himself indeed to fortuitous things, and
has brought upon himself trouble, prison, rain, and drowning. See how
fortune deludes us, and that which we put carefully into her hands, she
either breaks or lets it fall from her hands, or causes it to be removed
by the violence of another, or suffocates and poisons, or taints with
suspicion, fear, and jealousy to the great hurt and ruin of the
possessor. Fortunae au ulla putatis dona carcere dolis? For strength
which cannot give proof of itself is dissipated; magnanimity, which
cannot prevail, is naught, and vain is study without results; he sees
the effects of the fear of evil, which is worse than evil itself. Peior
est morte timor ipse mortis. He already suffers, through fear, that
which he fears to suffer, terror in the limbs, imbecility in the nerves,
tremors in the body, anxiety of the spirit, and that which has not yet
appeared becomes present to him, and is certainly worse than whatsoever
may happen. What can be more stupid than to be in pain about future,

things and absent ones which at present are not felt?

Cu. These considerations are on the surface and belong to the external
of the figure. But the proposition of the heroic enthusiast, I think,
deals with the imbecility of human nature (ingegno) which, intent on the
Divine undertaking, finds itself all at once engulphed in the abyss of
incomprehensible excellence, and the sense and the imagination become
confused and absorbed, and not knowing how to pass on, nor to go back,
nor where to turn, vanishes and loses itself as a drop of water vanishes
in the sea, or as a small spirit, becomes attenuated, losing its own
substance in the space and immensity of the atmosphere.

MAR. Well. But let us go towards our chamber and. talk as we go, for it
is night.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[1:1](the202.htm#fr_0.md) Astronomers distinguish
between a fixed and intellectual zodiac; and the movable and visible
zodiac. According to the former, Aries still stands as the first of the
signs; that is to say, the first thirty degrees of the zodiacal circle,
reckoning from the equinoctial point in spring, are allotted to Aries in
the intellectual zodiac. . . . Astronomers generally choose to reckon by
the fixed and intellectual zodiac.--(Drummond's "Oedipus Judaicus.")

<span id="fn_1"></span>[5:1](the202.htm#fr_1.md) As in long-drawn systole
and long-drawn diastole, must the period of Faith alternate with the
period of Denial; must the vernal growth, the summer luxuriance of all
Opinions, Spiritual Representations and Creations, be followed by, and
again follow the autumnal decay, the winter dissolution.--("Sartor
Resartus.")

<span id="fn_2"></span>[13:1](the202.htm#fr_2.md) But not till the whole
personality of the man is dissolved and melted--not until it is hold by
the divine fragment which has created it, as a mere subject for the
grave experiment and experience--not until the whole nature has yielded
and become subject unto its higher self, can the bloom open.--("Light on
the Path.")

<span id="fn_3"></span>[17:1](the202.htm#fr_3.md) Now, it may be asked,
what is the state of a man who followeth the true Light to the utmost of
his power? I answer truly, it will never he declared aright, for he who
is not such a man, can neither understand nor know it, and he who is,
knoweth it indeed; but he cannot utter it, for it is
unspeakable.--("Theologia Germanica.")

<span id="fn_4"></span>[18:1](the202.htm#fr_4.md) Speech is of time,
silence is of eternity."--("Sartor Resartus.")

<span id="fn_5"></span>[18:2](the202.htm#fr_5.md) Let no one suppose that
we may attain to this true light and perfect knowledge by hearsay, or by
reading and study, nor yet by high skill and great
learning.--("Theologia Germanica.")

<span id="fn_6"></span>[21:1](the202.htm#fr_6) For, in this (degree.md),
God cannot be tasted, felt, seen, because he is more ourselves than
ourselves, is not distinct from us.--("Spiritual Torrents.")

<span id="fn_7"></span>[28:1](the202.htm#fr_7.md) Ask, and it shall be
given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto
you.--("St. Matthew.")

<span id="fn_8"></span>[38:1](the202.htm#fr_8.md) He takes it by assault,
without offering battle: the heart is unable to resist him.--("Spiritual
Torrents.")
