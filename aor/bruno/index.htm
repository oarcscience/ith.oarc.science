Giordano Bruno, 1548-1600, was persecuted by the Church
for his heretical views, most notably his belief
that there are countless inhabited worlds around distant stars. 
Bruno also advocated the Copernican system.
Unlike Galileo, who grudgingly recanted his views, Bruno ended up
being burned at the stake.</P>
