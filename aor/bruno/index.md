Giordano Bruno, 1548-1600, was persecuted by the Church for his
heretical views, most notably his belief that there are countless
inhabited worlds around distant stars. Bruno also advocated the
Copernican system. Unlike Galileo, who grudgingly recanted his views,
Bruno ended up being burned at the stake.

The introduction to this translation of one of Bruno's most celebrated
(and cryptic) works has a good biography of Bruno.
