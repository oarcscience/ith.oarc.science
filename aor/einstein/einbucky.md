**BUCKY:**

> It's ironic that your namc has been synonymous with science in the
> twentieth century, and yet there has always been a lot of controversy
> surrounding you in relation to religious questions. How do you account
> for this unusual circumstance, since science and religion are usually
> thought to be at odds?

**EINSTEIN:**

> Well, I do not think that it is necessarily the case that science and
> religion are natural opposites. In fact, I think that there is a very
> close connection between the two. Further, I think that science
> without religion is lame and, conversely, that religion without
> science is blind. Both are important and should work hand-in-hand. It
> seems to mc that whoever doesn't wonder about the truth in religion
> and in science might as well be dead.

**BUCKY:**

> So then, you consider yourself to be a religious man?

**EINSTEIN:**

> I believe in mystery and, frankly, I sometimes face this mystery with
> great fear. In other words, I think that there are many things in the
> universe that we cannot perceive or penetrate and that also we
> experience some of the most beautiful things in life in only a very
> primitive form. Only in relation to these mysteries do I consider
> myself to be a religious man. But I sense these things deeply. What I
> cannot understand is how there could possibly be a God who would
> reward or punish his subjects or who could induce us to develop our
> will in our daily life.

**BUCKY:**

> You don't believe in God, then?

**EINSTEIN:**

> Ah, this is what I mean about religion and science going hand-in-hand!
> Each has a place, but each must be relegated to its sphere. Let's
> assume that we are dealing with a theoretical physicist or scientist
> who is very well-acquaintcd with the different laws of the universe,
> such as how the planets orbit the sun and how the satellites in turn
> orbit around their respectivc planets. Now, this man who has studied
> and understands these different laws-how could he possibly believe in
> one God who would be capable of disturbing the paths of these great
> orbiting masses?
>
> No, the natural laws of science have not only been worked out
> theoretically but have been proven also in practice. I cannot then
> believe in this concept of an anthropomorphic God who has the powers
> of interfering with these natural laws. As I said before, the most
> beautiful and most profound religious emotion that we can experience
> is the sensation of the mystical. And this mysticality is the power of
> all true science. If there is any such concept as a God, it is a
> subtle spirit, not an image of a man that so many have fixed in their
> minds. In essence, my religion consists of a humble admiration for
> this illimitable superior spirit that reveals itself in the slight
> details that we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds .

**BUCKY:**

> Do you think perhaps that most people need religion to keep them in
> check, so to speak?

**EINSTEIN:**

> No, clearly not. I do not believe that a man should be restrained in
> his daily actions by being afraid of punishment after death or that he
> should do things only because in this way he will be rewarded after he
> dies. This does not make sense. The proper guidance during the life of
> a man should be the weight that he puts upon ethics and the amount of
> consid eration that he has for others. Education has a great role to
> play in this respect. Religion should have nothing to do with a fear
> of living or a fear of death, but should instead be a striving after
> rational knowledge.

**BUCKY:**

> And yet, with all of these thoughts, you are still identified strongly
> in the public mind as definitely Jewish and this cer tainly is a very
> traditional religion.

**EINSTEIN:**

> Actually, my first religious training of any kind was in the Catholic
> catechism. A fluke, of course, only because the primary school that I
> first went to was a Catholic one. I was, as a matter of fact, the only
> Jewish child in the school. This actually worked to my advantage,
> since it made it easier for me to isolate myself from the rest of the
> class and find that comfort in solitude that I so cherished.

**BUCKY:**

> But don't you find any discrepancy between your previous somewhat
> anti-religious statements and your willingness to be identified
> publicly as a Jew?

**EINSTEIN:**

> Not necessarily. Actually it is a very difficult thing to even define
> a Jew. The closest that I can come to describing it is to ask you to
> visualize a snail. A snail that you see at the ocean consists of the
> body that is snuggled inside of the house which it always carries
> around with it. But let's picture what would happen if we lifted the
> shell off of the snail. Would we not still describe the unprotected
> body as a snail? In just the same way, a Jew who sheds his faith along
> the way, or who even picks up a different one, is still a Jew.

**BUCKY:**

> You were the focus of much attack on the part of the Nazis in Germany
> because of your Jewishness. What explanation have you come up with for
> why the Jews have been hated so much throughout history?
