### PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.

During the successive reprints of the first edition of this work,
published in 1871, I was able to introduce several important
corrections; and now that more time has elapsed, I have endeavoured to
profit by the fiery ordeal through which the book has passed, and have
taken advantage of all the criticisms which seem to me sound. I am also
greatly indebted to a large number of correspondents for the
communication of a surprising number of new facts and remarks. These
have been so numerous, that I have been able to use only the more
important ones; and of these, as well as of the more important
corrections, I will append a list. Some new illustrations have been
introduced, and four of the old drawings have been replaced by better
ones, done from life by Mr. T.W. Wood. I must especially call attention
to some observations which I owe to the kindness of Prof. Huxley (given
as a supplement at the end of Part I.), on the nature of the differences
between the brains of man and the higher apes. I have been particularly
glad to give these observations, because during the last few years
several memoirs on the subject have appeared on the Continent, and their
importance has been, in some cases, greatly exaggerated by popular
writers.

I may take this opportunity of remarking that my critics frequently
assume that I attribute all changes of corporeal structure and mental
power exclusively to the natural selection of such variations as are
often called spontaneous; whereas, even in the first edition of the
'Origin of Species,' I distinctly stated that great weight must be
attributed to the inherited effects of use and disuse, with respect both
to the body and mind. I also attributed some amount of modification to
the direct and prolonged action of changed conditions of life. Some
allowance, too, must be made for occasional reversions of structure; nor
must we forget what I have called "correlated" growth, meaning, thereby,
that various parts of the organisation are in some unknown manner so
connected, that when one part varies, so do others; and if variations in
the one are accumulated by selection, other parts will be modified.
Again, it has been said by several critics, that when I found that many
details of structure in man could not be explained through natural
selection, I invented sexual selection; I gave, however, a tolerably
clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'Origin of
Species,' and I there stated that it was applicable to man. This subject
of sexual selection has been treated at full length in the present work,
simply because an opportunity was here first afforded me. I have been
struck with the likeness of many of the half-favourable criticisms on
sexual selection, with those which appeared at first on natural
selection; such as, that it would explain some few details, but
certainly was not applicable to the extent to which I have employed it.
My conviction of the power of sexual selection remains unshaken; but it
is probable, or almost certain, that several of my conclusions will
hereafter be found erroneous; this can hardly fail to be the case in the
first treatment of a subject. When naturalists have become familiar with
the idea of sexual selection, it will, as I believe, be much more
largely accepted; and it has already been fully and favourably received
by several capable judges.
