<H4>Glossary of the Principal Scientific Terms Used In the Present Volume</H4>

<P>I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. W. S. Dallas for this Glossary,
which has been given because several readers have complained to me
that some of the terms used were unintelligible to them. Mr. Dallas
has endeavoured to give the explanations of the terms in as popular
a form as possible.

<DL>
<DT>ABERRANT</DT>
<DD>
Forms or groups of animals or plants which deviate in
important characters from their nearest allies, so as not to be easily
included in the same group with them, are said to be aberrant.
</DD>
<DT>ABERRATION (in Optics)</DT>
<DD>In the refraction of light by a convex
lens the rays passing through different parts of the lens are
brought to a focus at slightly different distances,- this is called
spherical aberration; at the same time the coloured rays are separated
by the prismatic action of the lens and likewise brought to a focus at
different distances, this is chromatic aberration.
</DD>
<DT>ABNORMAL</DT>
<DD>Contrary to the general rule.</DD>
<DT>ABORTED</DT>
<DD>

<DD>Albinos are animals in which the usual colouring matters
characteristic of the species have not been produced in the skin and
its appendages. Albinism is the state of being an albino.

budding, or by the division of the substance of the first product of
the egg.

whelks, oysters, mussels, and cockles, may serve as examples of them.
  </DD><DT>MONOCOTYLEDONS, or MONOCOTYLEDONOUS PLANTS</DT>
<DD>Plants in which the seed
sends up only a single seed-leaf (or cotyledon); characterised by

young animals when they were supposed to constitute a peculiar genus.
  </DD><DT>ZOOIDS</DT>
<DD>In many of the lower animals (such as the corals, Medusae,

and by a process of budding with or without separation from the parent
of the product of the latter, which is often very different from
that of the egg. The individuality of the species is represented by
the whole of the form produced between two sexual reproductions; and
these forms, which are apparently individual animals, have been called
zooide.
