*The Voyage of the Beagle*, by Charles Darwin, 11th ed. \[1890\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**PREFATORY NOTICE TO THE ILLUSTRATED EDITION.**

This work was described, on its first appearance, by a writer in the
*Quarterly Review* as "One of the most interesting narratives of
voyaging that it has fallen to our lot to take up, and one which must
always occupy a distinguished place in the history of scientific
navigation.

This prophecy has been amply verified by experience; the extraordinary
minuteness and accuracy of Mr. Darwin's observations, combined with the
charm and simplicity of his descriptions, have ensured the popularity of
this book with all classes of readers—and that popularity has even
increased in recent years. No attempt, however, has hitherto been made
to produce an illustrated edition of this valuable work: numberless
places and objects are mentioned and described, but the difficulty of
obtaining authentic and original representations of them drawn for the
purpose has never been overcome until now.

Most of the views given in this work are from sketches made on the spot
by Mr. Pritchett, with Mr. Darwin's book by his side. Some few of the
others are taken from engravings which Mr. Darwin had himself selected
for their interest as illustrating his voyage, and which have been
kindly lent by his son.

Mr. Pritchett's name is well known in connection with the voyages of the
*Sunbeam* and *Wanderer*, and it is believed that the illustrations,
which have been chosen and verified with the utmost care and pains, will
greatly add to the value and interest of the "VOYAGE OF A NATURALIST."

JOHN MURRAY.

*December 1889.*
