This is the little book which provided the rationale for the American
colonists to struggle for independence from English rule. Relative to
the size of the population at the time, it is the US best seller of all
time; it sold half a million copies in the first year, going through
twenty-five editions. Paine wrote Common Sense like a sermon, using
Biblical references to make his point, despite his Deist views. However,
this style appealed to a broad audience, not just intellectuals. Paine
even put his money on the line: he donated all royalties from Common
Sense, which were substantial, to the Continental Army of George
Washington.--J.B. Hare
