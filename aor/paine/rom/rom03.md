George Washington

President Of The United States Of America

Sir,

I present you a small treatise in defence of those principles of freedom
which your exemplary virtue hath so eminently contributed to establish.
That the Rights of Man may become as universal as your benevolence can
wish, and that you may enjoy the happiness of seeing the New World
regenerate the Old, is the prayer of

Sir,

Your much obliged, and

  Obedient humble Servant,

    Thomas Paine
