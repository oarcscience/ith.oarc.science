<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roger Bacon<i> an </i>Englishman,<i> a founded Scholar
of </i>Merton-<i>Colledg in </i>Oxford,<i> a very quick Philosopher, and
withall a very famous Divine, he had an incredible knowledge in the Mathematicks,
but without Necromancy (as </i>John Balleus<i> doth report) although he
be defam'd for it by many: Now this man after he had sharply reproved the
times wherein he liv'd; these Errours, saith he, speak Antichrist present.
</i>Nicholas<i>
the Fourth Pope of </i>Rome<i> did condemn his Doctrine in many things,
and he was by him kept in prison for many years together; as </i>Antonine<i>
hath it in his Chronicle. He flourished in the year of our Lord, </i>1270.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; John Gerhard Vossius<i> in his Book of the four Popular
Arts, printed at </i>Amsterdam, 1650<i> is every where full of the praises
of </i>Bacon,<i> as in the year </i>1252.<i> About these mens time </i>Roger
Bacon <i>also flourished, an </i>Englishman, <i>and a Monk of the Order
of St. </i>Francis; <i>who as he had div'd into all Arts and Sciences:
so also he writ many things of them, he was a man both learned and subtil
unto a Miracle, and did such won-derfull things by the help of </i>Mathematicks,<i>
that by such as were envious and ignorant, he was accused of Diabolical
</i>Magick<i>,
before Pope </i>Clement <i>the 4</i>th,<i> and for that cause was detained
in prison by him for some time. </i>Jo. Pecus<i> Earl of </i>Mirandula,
<i>the Phenix of all the wits of his Age, cals him likewise, very ingenious.

Bacon<i> a </i>Franciscan<i> Monk, and a Divine of </i>Oxford,<i> was famous
amongst the </i>English
<i>in all sorts of</i> <i>Sciences; a man of so
vast learning, that neither
</i>England, <i>no nor the world beside, had
almost any thing like or equal to him. And either by envy or ignorance
of the Age, wherein he lived, was accused of </i>Magick. <i>He in the mean
time did write and recommend to the Memory of Posterity, a Book of Weights,
of the Centers of heavy things, of the Practicks of Natural Magick, &amp;c.
For he was a man well vers'd in all sorts of study, very learned in the
Latine, Greek and Hebrew Tongues, a Mathematician every way accomplisht,

I may carefully render you an answer to your desire, understand, <i>Nature
is potent and admirable in her working, </i>yet Art using the advantage
of
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>2 <i>Of the Invocation of Spirits.</i></b>
<p>nature as an instrument (experience tels us) is of greater efficacy
than any natural activity.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatsoever Acts otherwise than by natural or artificial
means, is not humane, but merely fictitious and deceitfull.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have many men that by the nimblenesse and activity
of body, diversification of sounds, exactness of instruments, darkness,
or consent, make things seem to be present, which never were really existent
in the course of Nature. The world, as any judicious eye may see, groans
under such bastard burdens. A Jugler by an handsome sleight of hand, will
put a compleat lie upon the very sight. The <i>Pythoniss&aelig;</i> sometimes
speaking from their bellies, otherwhile from the throat, than by the mouth,
do create what voices they please, either speaking at hand, or farre off,
in such a manner, as if a Spirit discoursed with a man, and sometimes as
though Beasts bellowed, which is all easily discovered by private laying
hollow Canes in the grasse, or secret places, for so the voices of men
will be known from other creatures.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When inanimate things are violently moved, either
in the Morning or Eve-
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Of the Invocation of Spirits.</i> 3</b>
<p>ning twilight, expect no truth therein, but down-right cheating and
cousenage.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for consent, men by it may undertake any thing
they please, if so be they have a mutual disposition.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These I mention, as practices wherein neither philosophical
Reasons, Art, or power of Nature is prevalent. Beyond these there is a
more damnable practice, when men despising the Rules of Philosophy, irrationally
call up wicked Spirits, supposing them of Energy to satisfie their desires.
In which there is a very vast errour, because such persons imagine they
have some authority over Spirits, and that Spirits may be compelled by
humane authority, which is altogether impossible, since humane Energy or
Authority is inferiour by much to that of Spirits. Besides, they admit
a more vast mistake, supposing such natural instruments, as they use, to
be able either to call up, or drive away any wicked Spirit. And they continue
their mistake in endeavouring by Invocations, Deprecations or Sacrifices
to please Spirits, making them propitious to their design. Without all
question, the way is incomparably more easie

<p>to obtain any thing, that is truly good for men, of God, or good Angels,
then of wicked Spirits. As for things which are incommodious for men, wicked
Spirits can no further yeeld assistance, then they have permission, for
the sins of the sonnes of men, from that God, who governs and directs all
humane affairs. Hence therefore I shall conclude (these things being beyond,
or rather against the Rules of Wisdome) No true Philosopher did ever regard
to work by any of these six wayes.

<p><b><i>Of Charms, Figures, and their Use.</i></b></center>

<p><b><font size=+3>W</font></b>Hat men ought to believe touching Figures,
Charmes, and such stuff, I shall deliver my opinion. Without doubt there
is nothing in these dayes of this kind, but what is either deceitfull,
dubious, or irrational, which Philosophers formerly invented to hide their
secret operations of Nature and Art from the eyes of an unworthy generation.
For instance, if the virtue of the Load-stone, whereby
<p><b><i>and their Use. 5</i></b>
<p>whereby it draws iron to it were not discovered, some one or other who
hath a mind hereby to cosen the people, so goes about his businesse, as
lest any by-stander should discover the work of attraction to be natural,
he calls Figures, and mutters forth some Charmes. Thus many things lie
dark in Philosophical writings; in which the wiser sort of Readers will
expresse so much discretion, as reject the Figures and Charmes, eying the
works of Nature and Art, that so they may see the mutual concurrence of
animate and inanimate creatures, occasioned by Natures conformity, not
any efficacy of Figures or Charmes. This is the cause why the unlearned
crew have judged such natural or artificial operations to be merely Magical.
And some fond Magicians beleeve, That their casting of Figures and Charmes
was the sole cause of such operations; hereupon leaving their natural and
artificial operations have stuck close to their erroneous casting of Figures
and Charmes. And thus they both have by their own folly deprived themselves
of the benefit of the others wisdome. In times past, godly and religious
men, or rather God himself, or his <font color="#FF0000">{Nnmb.6.27.}</font>

<p>good Angels composed several Prayers which yet may retain their primitive
virtue. As to this day, in several Countreys certain prayers are made over
hot irons, and water in the River, &amp;c. By which the innocent are cleared,
and guilty condemned; yet all this is done by the Authority of the Church,
and her Prelates. Our Priests exercise their holy water, <font color="#FF0000">{Numb.
5.} </font>as formerly the <i>Jews </i>did in the Old Testament, in making
the water of Tryal, whereby the wise was tryed, whether she were an adultresse,
or honest. Not to instance in others of the like nature. Concerning those
Secrets, which are revealed in Magicians writings, although they may contain
some truth, yet in regard those very truths are enveloped with such a number
of deceits, as it's not very easie to judge betwixt the truth and falshood,
they ought all worthily to be rejected. Neither must men be believed, who
would assure us, That <i>Solomon,</i> or some other of our sage Progenitors
were Authors of such Books, because those Books are not received either
by the Churches Authority, or by any prudent men, but only by a few cheating
Compa-
<p><b><i>and their Use. </i>7</b>
<p>nions to be the work of such men. Mine own experience assures me they
compose and set forth new works and inventions of their own, in lofty high
flown expressions, the more colourably to make their lies passe under the
shelter of the Text; prefixing some specious titles, the better to set
them off, impudently ascribe such bastard births to famous Authors.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Figures are either composed of words involved in
the formes of letters, invented to contain the sense of some * speech or
prayer <font color="#FF0000">{* Oraionis.}</font>; or they are made according
to the face of the Heavens in proper and select seasons. The Figures of
the former sort must have the same sentence that I gave of prayers formerly;
as for Figures and * <font color="#FF0000">{* Sigillis.}</font>Impressions
of the other kind, unlesse they be made in their peculiar seasons, they
are not of any efficacy. And hence it is that all wise men think they effect
nothing, who only go according to their prescribed Characters, not at all
regarding more than the bare external forme. The more knowing sonnes of
Art, dispose all their works of Nature and Art accord-
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>8 <i>Of Charms, Figures,</i></b>
<p>ing to the power of the Heavens, casting their work under a right Constellation,
no lesse than the casting it in a right Figure. Now in regard there is
much difficulty to discern the motion of Celestial Bodies, many are cousened,
and very few know, how to begin their work either profitably or truly.
Hence it comes to passe, that the croud of judicious Mathematicians and
Starre gazers effect little, and that unprofitable, while the more expert
Professours, who sufficiently understand their own Art, attain many conveniences
both by their Operations and Judgements in select and proper opportunities:
And yet let us take notice, how the Physician, or he that would re-erect
a drooping soul, effects his designe by the use of Figures or Charmes,
which in themselves are meerly fictitious (as <i>Constantine</i> the Physician
is of opinion.) <font color="#FF0000">{Thus some</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">think the Kings evil is cured, by creating&nbsp;
a belief the touch of the King can cure.} </font>Physicians use Figures
or Charmes, not for any prevalency in them, but that the raising of the
soul is of great efficacy in the curing of the body, and raising it from
infirmity to health, by oy and confidence is done by Charmes;
<p><b><i>and their Use. </i>9</b>
<p>for they make the Patient receive the Medicine with greater confidence
and desire, exciting courage, more liberal belief, hope and pleasure. The
Physician then who would magnifie his cure, may work some way of exciting
hope and confidence in his Patient; not that hereby he should cheat, but
stirre up the sick to believe he shall recover, which if we pin our faith
on <i>Constantines</i> sleeve, is very tolerable. <font color="#FF0000">{This
may be</font>
<br><font color="#FF0000">done lawfully, if the party that is the principal
agent doth nothing by way of compact with any Spirit, or sinistrously.}</font>
Upon this account he defends the hanging Charmes or Figures about the Neck.
The soul no question is of much prevalency by reason of its strong affections
over its proper body, as <i>Avicen</i> saith in <i>lib. de anima, &amp;</i>
8. <i>&amp; animal.</i> to which all wise men accord. Hereupon it was,
that they concluded sick persons should be delighted by the company of
children to play before them, and other pleasing objects. Yea they frequently
consent to such things as please the appetite, though they be obnoxious
to their disease; because affection, desire and hope of the soul conquers
many diseases.

as are in <i>tertia specie Qualitatis.</i>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Virtues which flows from the Creature,
some of them are sensible, some insensible. Man which is both the most
noble corporeity, and dignified rational soul, hath no lesse than other
things heat and spirits exhaling from him and so may no lesse than other
things emit and dispose of his Virtues and <i>Species</i> to external Objects.

<i>Hy&aelig;na</i> suffers not the dog which comes within his shadow to
bark (as <i>Solinus de mirabili bus mundi,
</i>and others) And <i>Aristotle
lib</i>.3.<i> de Vegetab. </i>saith, That Female Palm-trees bring forth
fruit to maturity by the smell of their Males. And Mares in some Kingdoms
impregnate by the smell of Horses (as <i>Solinus
</i>affirms.) <i>Aristotle</i>
in his Secrets assures us of several other contingencies which issue from
the <i>Species</i> and Virtues of Plants and Animals. Hence I argue, If
Plants and Animals, which are inferiour in dignity to our humane Nature,
can emit, then surely may man more abundantly emit <i>Species,</i> Virtues
and Colours to the alteration of external Bodies. To this purpose is that,
which <i>Aristotle</i> tels us (<i>Lib. de somno &amp; Vigilia</i>) a menstruous
woman looking in a glasse, doth infect it with spots, like clouds of blood.
<i>Solinus </i>further writes,
<font color="#FF0000">{Cap.6. vid. &amp;

<p>sights in one eye. (Hence <i>Ovid, Nos et pupilla duplex</i>) and that
these women by their glances kill men. <font color="#FF0000">{In the Norhern
Country some are said to have an evil eye, and to do harm by their looks,

know, That men of an evil complexion, full of contagious infirmities, as
Leprosie, the Falling-sickness, spotted Feaver, bleer-eyed, or the like,
infects those men in their company: While on the other side, men of a sound
and wholesome complexion, especially young men, do by their very presence
exhilerate and comfort others; which no question, as <i>Galen</i> in his
T<i>echne, </i>proceeds from their pure spirits wholsome and delightsome
vapours, their sweet natural colour, and from such <i>Species</i> and Virtues
as they emit. <font color="#FF0000">{He holds sight by emission.}</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That man whose soul <font color="#FF0000">{The soul
sinful or not, works morally, not physically to the hurt of others, but
the man who hath a body may do something <i>Medicante corpre.</i>}
</font>is defiledwithmany hainous
sins, his Body infirme, his Complexion evil, and hath a vehement fancy
and desire to hurt his neighbour, may bring more inconveniences,
<p><b><i>and a Check to Magick. </i>13</b>
<p>then another man. The Reason may be, the Nature of Complexion and infirmity
yeelds obedience to the thoughts of the Heart, and is more augmented by
the intervention of our desires. Hence it is that a leprous person, who
is solicitous, desirous and fancying to infect some one or other in the
room, may more easily and forceably effect it, than he which hath no such
intention, fancy or desire. For (as <i>Avicen </i>observes in the fore
cited place) the nature of the body is obedient to the thoughts, and more
intent fancies of the soul. And (as <i>Avicen</i> in the 3<sup>d</sup><i>Metaph.</i>
affirms) the thought is the first mover, after that the desire is made
conformable to the thought, then after that the natural virtue, which is
in the members, obeys the desire and thought; and thus it is both in good
and bad effects. Hence it is that a young man of a good Complexion, healthfull,
fair, well featured Body, having his soul not debauched with sinne, but
of a strong fancy and vehement desire to compasse the effecting of some
magnificent designe, withall adding the power of his Virtues, <i>Species

<p>fluences work both more powerfully and vehemently, than if he should
want any of these fore going qualifications, especially strong affections
and forceable imaginations. Hence I conclude, Men by the concurrence of
the foresaid Causes, Words and Works being the Instruments, bring great
undertakings to perfection.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for words, they are hatched within, by the thoughts
and desires of the mind, sent abroad by heat, <i>Vocale arteries</i>, and
motion of the Spirits. The places of their generation are in open passages,
by which there is a great efflux of such spirits, heat, vapours, virtues,
and <i>Species,</i> as are made by the soul and heart. And therefore words
may so farre cause alterations by these parts or passages, as their Nature
will extend. For it's evident, That breathings, yawnings, several resolutions
of Spirits and heat come thorow these open passages from the heart and
inward parts: Now if these words come from an infirm and evil complexionated
body, they are constantly obnoxious. But if from a pure sound and wholsome
constitution, they are very beneficial and comfortable. It's clear then,
That the
<p><b><i>and a Check to Magick. </i>15</b>
<p>bare generation and prolation of words joyned with desire and intention
are considerable in natural operations. Hereupon we do justly say, <i>Vox
viva magnum habet virtutem;</i> Living words are of great Virtue. Not that
they have any such Virtue of doing or undoing, as <i>Magicians</i> speak
of, but only they have the Virtue of Nature, which makes me put in this
Caution of being extream cautelous herein. For a man may, as many have
already done, erre on both hands: Some wholly denying any operation of
words: Others superfluously decline to a Magical use thereof. Our duties
should be to have a care of such Books, as are fraught with Charms, Figures,
Orizons, Conjurations, Sacrifices, or the like, because they are purely
Magical. For instance, the Book <i>De Officiis Spirituum,liber de morte
anim&aelig;, liber de arte notoria</i> with infinite others, containing
neither precepts of Nature or Art, having nothing save Magical Fopperies.
Yet herewithall we must remember, there are many Books commonly reputed
to be Magical, but have no other fault then discovering the dignity of
wisdome. What Books are suspicious, and what not; Every discreet Readers
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>16<i> Of the force of Speech, &amp;c.</i></b>
<p>experience will show him. The Book which discovers natural or artificial
operations imbrace; that which is void of either or leave both, as suspitious
and unworthy the consideration of any wise man. 'Tis usual with <i>Magicians,</i>
to treat of both unnecessary and superfluous subjects. 'Twas excellently
said of <i>Isaac (in lib. de Febribus,) The rational soul is not impeded
in its operations, unlesse by the Manicles of ignorance. </i>And <i>Aristotle</i>
is of opinion, <i>(in lib. secret.) That a clear and strong intellect,
being impregnated by the influences of divine Virtue, may attain to anything
which is necessary. </i>And in 3<sup>d </sup>Meteor, he saith, <i>There
is no influence or power, but from God.</i> In the Conclusion of his Ethics,
<i>There
is no Virtue, whether Moral or Natural without divine influence.
</i>Hence
it is, that when we discourse of particular agents, we exclude not the
Regiment of the universal Agent, and first Cause of all things. For every
first Cause hath more influence on the Effect, than any second Cause, as
he speaks in the first proposition of Causes.

discourse on such admirable operations of Art and Nature, as have not the

first of such Engines, as are purely artificial.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's possible to make Engines to sail withall, as
that either fresh or salt water vessels may be guided by the help of one
man, and made sail with a greater swiftness, than others will which are
full of men to help them.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's possible to make a Chariot move with an inestimable
swiftnesse (such as the <i>Currus falcati</i> were, wherein our fore fathers
of old fought,) and this motion to be without the help of any living creature.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's possible to make Engines for flying, a man sitting
in the midst whereof, by turning onely about

<br><b>18<i> Of Artificial Instruments.</i></b>
<p>an Instrument, which moves artificiall Wings made to beat the Aire,
much after the fashion of a Birds flight.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's possible to invent an Engine of a little bulk,
yet of great efficacy, either to the depressing or elevation of the very
greatest weight, which would be of much consequence in several Accidents:
For hereby a man may either ascend or descend any walls, delivering himself
or comrads from prison; and this Engine is only three fingers high, and
four broad.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man may easily make an Instrument, whereby one
man may in despight of all opposition, draw a thousand men to himself,
or any other thing, which is tractable.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man may make an Engine, whereby without any corporal
danger, he may walk in the bottome of the Sea, or other water. These <i>Alexander</i>
(as the Heathen Astronomer assures us) used to see the secrets of the deeps.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such Engines as these were of old, and are made even
in our dayes. These all of them (excepting only that instrument of flying,
which I never saw or know any,

Moons ; yea sometimes three Sunnes shine together in the Air. </i>And by

into an Enemies Camp or Garison, there being a multiplication of appearances
of Starres, or men assembled purposely to destroy them; Especially if the
following designe be conjoyned to the former (<i>viz.</i>) Glasses so cast,
that things at hand may appear at distance, and things at distance, as
hard at hand: yea so farre may the designe be driven, as the least letters
may be read, and things reckoned at an incredible distance, yea starres
shine in what place you please. A way, as is verily believed, <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i> took by great Glasses from the Coasts of <i>France,</i>
to view the site and disposition of stoth the Castles and SeaTowns in great
<i>Britain.</i>
By the framing of Glasses, bodies of the largest bulk, may in appearance
be contracted to a minute volumne, things little in themselves show great,
while others tall and lofty appear low and creeping, things creeping and
low, high and mighty, things private and hidden to be clear and manifest.
For as <i>Socrates</i> did discover a Dragon, whose prestiferous breathings
and influences corrupted both City and Countrey thereabouts, to have
<p><b><i>of Perspective. </i>21</b>
<p>his residence in the Caverns of the Mountains. So may any other thing
done in an Enemies Camp or Garison, be discovered. Glasses may be framed
to send forth <i>Species,</i> and poisonous infectious influences, whither
a man pleaseth. And this invention <i>Aristotle</i> shewed <i>Alexander,
</i>by
which he erecting the poison of a Basilisk upon the Wall of a City, which
held out against his Army, conveyed the very poison into the City it self.
Glasses may be so framed and placed, as that any man coming into a room,
shall undoubtedly imagine he sees heaps of gold, silver, precious stones,
or what you please, though upon his approach to the place he shall perceive
his mistake.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's then folly to seek the effecting that by Magical
Illusions, which the power of Philosophy can demonstrate.

is the description of Celestial Bodies, both according to their Longitude
and Latitude, in such Corporeal Figures, as they naturally move by their
diurnal motion. An Invention of more satisfaction to a discreet head, than
a Kings Crown.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But this will suffice as to Figurations, though we

of Saltpeter, and other ingredients; or of the oil of Red Petrolei, <font color="#FF0000">{Oleum

Maltha, Naphtha, with such like, which will burn at what distance we please,

he kept a City against the whole Roman Army: For by casting down <i>Maltha</i>
he could burn a Souldier, though he had on his Armour. In the next place,
to these we may place the <i>Grecian</i> fire, <font color="#FF0000">{Ignis
Gracus.}</font> and other combustibles. To proceed, Lamps may be made to
burn, and waters to keep hot perpetually. For I know many things which
are not consumed in the fire, as the Salamanders skin Talk, with others,
which by some adjunct both are inflamed and shine, yet are not consumed,
but rather purified. Besides these, we may speak of di-
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>24<i> Of strange Apparations.</i></b>
<p>vers admirable peeces of * Nature. <font color="#FF0000">{* Art it should
be, as I suppose.} </font>As the making Thunder and Lighting in the Air;
yea with a greater advantage of horrour, then those which are onely produced
by Nature. For a very competent quantity of matter rightly prepared (the
bignesse of ones thumb) will make a most hideous noise and corruscation,
this may be done several wayes; by which a City or Army may be overcome,
much after the fashion as <i>Gideon</i> overcame that vast Army of the
<i>Midianites
</i>with three hundred men, by the breaking of their Pitchers, and shining
of their Lamps, together with the sudden leaping forth of the fire, and
inestimable crackings. These would appear strange, if they were designed
to their just height both of proportion and matter. I might produce many
strange works of another kind, which though they bring no sensible profit,
yet contain an ineffible spectacle of wit, and may be applied to the probation
of all such secrets, as the ignorant crew will not imbrace. Such might
I name the attraction, of Iron to the Loadstone, a thing so in-
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Of strange Apparations. </i>25</b>
<p>credulous, as none save an eye-witnesse would believe. And in this attraction
of Iron, experience will show a diligent searcher, more wonders than any
vulgar capacity can entertain.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to proceed to greater, and more than these. There
is an at-traction of gold, silver, and all other metals, by a certain stone,
much after the same manner. <font color="#FF0000">{Silver and all other
metals. Plin.Hist.l.36. cap.20. Aliter Vinegar.} </font>Besides one stone
will runne to the heap. Plants may have their mutual concurrence, and the
parts of sensible creatures locally divided, will naturally move to a mutual
imbracement. The consideration whereof makes me think, that there is not
any thing, whether in divine or outward matters too difficult for my faith.
To proceed higher, The whole power of the Mathematicks may compose a spherical
Engine, according to <i>Ptolomies</i> frame in eight Almagest; which sincerely
describes both longitude and latitude of all Celestial Bodies; but to give
them a natural diurnal motion is not in the power of the Mathematicks.
However a discreet head-piece would do well to try the making hereof of
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>26<i> Of strange Apparations.</i></b>
<p>such materials and artifice, as it might have a natural diurnal motion.
Which seems to me possible; and because many things are moved with the
motion of the Heavens, as Comets, the Sea tides, with several other things,
which are turned about either in the whole or in part. Such a work might
be thought more miracu-lous, and of a vaster benefit than any thing hitherto
mentioned. For the perfecting of this would frustrate all other, whether
the more curious, or the more vulgar Astronomical Instruments, which surely
would be more valuable than a Kings Coffers; and yet there may matters
be brought to passe, which though they will not reach so near a miracle,
yet of farre greater publick and private profit. As the producing so much
gold or silver, as we please, not by the work of Nature yet accomplishment
of Art: seeing there may be ten and seven wayes of gold, eight by the mixture
of silver with gold; and the first way is made by sixteen parts of gold
with some parts of silver, which will attain the four and twentieth degree
of gold, al- <font color="#FF0000">{Quid sint decem &amp; septem modi auri,

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Of strange Apparations.</i> 27</b>
<p>wayes augmenting one degree of gold with one of silver, and so for the
mixture of brasse with gold. So the last way is * <font color="#FF0000">{*
Ex from.}</font> by the four and twenty degrees of pure gold without mixture
of other metal. And beyond this, Nature knows no further progresse, as
experience tels us. Though Art may augment gold in the degrees of purity,
even to infinitenesse, and compleat silver, without the least cheat: And
yet that which seems more rare than all this is, That though the rational
soul (hath so farre its free-will, as) it cannot be compelled, yet may
effectually be excited,induced and disposed freely to alter its affections,
desires and behaviours to the dictates of another man. And this may not
only be practiced upon one particular person, but upon a whole Army, City,
or Body of a Nation living under one Region, if we believe experience.
And this experience, <i>Aristotle </i>discloseth in his Book of Secrets,
both of an Army, Region and single person. And thus I have well nigh finished
my thoughts of Nature and Art.

That <i>Pollio</i>, a man of a strong body and mind, lived much longer
then men usually now: of whom <i>Octavius Augustus </i>enquiring, What
course he took to live so long? was answered &aelig;nigmatically, he used
Oyl without, and Mulsum within (now according to the opinion of some, it's
eight parts of water, and nine of honey) I might produce many examples
of the same quality: as that which fell out in the dayes of King <i>William</i>;
A Countreyman plowing in the field, found a golden vessel, containing a
certain liquor, which he supposing to be the Dew of Heaven, washed his
face withall, and
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i> 29</b>
<p>drunk of it, whereby he became renued in spirit, body and excellency,
<i>De
bubulio factus est Bajulus Regis Sicilie, </i>from a Plow-man he was made
Porter to the King of <i>Sicily.</i> And the Popes Letters assures us,
That <i>Almannus,</i> held Prisoner by the <i>Saracens,</i> through the
use of a Medicine lived five hundred years. For the King, whose Captive
he was, having received this Medicine from the Embassadours of the great
King, and being suspicious of them, made tryall hereof upon this Captive,
which was brought him for that purpose. And the Lady of the Woods in great
<i>Britanny</i>
searching for a white Hinde, found an Ointment, wherewith the Keeper of
the Woods anointed his whole body, except the soals of his feet, and he
lived three hundred years without any corruption, save in the soals of
his feet, which had some passions. We our selves know it frequent in these
dayes, That plain Country men, without the advantage so much as of a Physicians
advice, live very healthfully an hundred years, or little lesse. And these
are the rather confirmed by the operations of Animals, as Harts, Ea-
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>30<i> Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i></b>
<p>gles, Serpents, and many other, who by the efficacy of heart or stones,
have renewed their youth: And wise men seeing that even bruits could reach
so farre to their Prolongation, adjudging it no lesse feasable by reasonable
men, set themselves on the Spurre to find out this secret. Hereupon <i>Artefius</i>
from his own ingenuity, having found the Secrets, of Stones, Herbs, Sensibles,
&amp;c. both for the knowledge of Nature, and especially the Prolongation
of Life, did * rejoyce, <font color="#FF0000">{* Al. Glory. }</font> that
he had lived 1025 yeares. Further, to confirme this Assertion of the Prolongation
of Life, it's considerable, That man naturally is immortal, that is to
say, <i>Potens non mori</i>, hath a possibility of not dying. Yea, even
after his fall, he might live a thousand years, though by degrees the length
of life was abbreviated. Hence it follows, That this abbreviation is Accidental,
and consequentially may be repaired in whole or in part; and upon search
we shall find the accidental cause of this corruption, is not from the
Heavens, or any other than the defect of true Government of our health.
In that our Fathers are
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i> 31</b>
<p>corrupt and imbecil, they beget sonnes of a corrupt complexion and composition,
and their children upon the same score are corrupted. Thus the Pedigree
of corruption is deprived from Fathers to sonnes, until we settle upon
our heirs an assured abbreviation of our dayes. Yet this doth not conclude,
That to perpetuity there shall succeed an abreviation of our life, since
there is a positive period set to our life, men may live till they be eighty
years, though then their dayes be but labour and sorrow. <font color="#FF0000">{Psalm

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now if every man would from the brest exercise a
compleat Regiment of health (which consists in such things as have relation
to Meat, Drink, Sleep, Waking, Motion, Rest, Evacuation, Retention, Air,
and the Passions of the mind) He might find a remedy resisting his proper
malady. For upon the prosecution of such a Regiment, one might arrive at
the uttermost limit of that Nature he had from his Parents will permit,
<font color="#FF0000">{Deest

of Nature (I mean Nature fallen from its origi-
<p>

<p>nal uprightness) beyond which there is no further progresse; because
it doth little or nothing availe against the cor-ruption of our Ancestours:
and yet the great impossibility of any mans so ordering himself in a mean,
in all the fore-mentioned things, as the Regiment of health exacts, wherefore
abbreviation of our dayes does not only from our Progenitors, but hath
its advantages from the want of Regiment. However the Art of Physick sufficiently
determines this. Although nor rich, or poor, wise or ignorant, no nor the
most accurate Physicians themselves, do accomplish this Regiment in themselves
or others, as every eye can discern; Yet Nature is not deficient in Necessaries,
or Art any wayes incompleat, but rather is advantagious to make insurrections
and irruptions against, and so farre into these accidental passions, as
they are either wholly or in part rooted out. At first, and in the beginning
of our ages declining, the remedy was easie: But since we have five thousand
years or more disadvantage, the Cure is more craggy.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But waving the Inconveniences wise
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Of Old Age, and Long Life.</i> 33</b>
<p>men moved by the considerations forementioned, have endeavoured to find
out the means and wayes, which not only are forceable against the defects
of every mans proper Regiment, but also against the corruptions of our
Parents: Not that hereby they can attain to the yeares of <i>Adam</i> or
<i>Artesius,</i>
by reason of the growing corruption, but that our dayes may be augmented
an hundred yeares, or more, above the ordinary age of most men in these
dayes. And though it be impossible absolutely to retard the accidents of
old age, yet hereby they may mitigate them, so as life will happily be
prorogued beyond the common account, yet alwayes within the ultimate circuit
of Nature. There is a bounder of Nature, set in men since their Fall. There
is a bounder of every particulate man arising from the proper corruption
of his Parents. Beyond both these bounders it's impossible to passe; yet
happily one may arrive beyond the latter: nor yet so farre to go beyond
it, as that the wisest of men can never reach the former. Although there
be a pos-
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p>sibility and aptitude of Nature to proceed to that boundary our first
Parents set them. Let no man think this strange, since this aptitude extends
itself to immortality, as appears both before the fall,and shall be evident
after the Resurrection.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps you may object, That neither <i>Aristotle,
Plato, Hippocrates,</i> or <i>Galen </i>ever attained that prolongation.
I shall answer, They have not attained the knowledge of many ordinary truths,
which other ingenious heads have found out; and if so, they may easily
miscarry in a businesse of such weighty consequence, though they made it
their study: especially, if we consider, how they were burdened with other
impertinencies, and so were sooner brought to their gray haires, spending
the inch of their Candles in more debased and vulgar subjects, than in
finding out the wayes to so great Secrets. We are not ignorant <i>Aristotle

as a multitude, must be false ; I mean of that multitude, which is distinct
from knowing men. The multitude, it's true, agree with wise men in the

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reason then, why wise men have obscured their

<p>write their Secrets, which causeth a great obscurity amongst them, especially
amongst the <i>Hebrewes.</i> For as <i>Aristotle </i>sayes in his fore-recited
Book, <i>God gave them all manner of Wisdome long before they were Philosophers:
And all Nations had their Originals of Philosophy from the Hebrewes, as
Albumazar in lib. Introductorii Majoris;</i> and other Philoso phers, with
<i>Josephus
lib</i>.I. <i>&amp; lib.</i>8. <i>Antiquit.</i> makes it evident.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, This obscuring is occasioned by the mixture
of several sorts of Letters, for so the <i>Ethnick</i> Astronomer hid his
knowledge, writing it in <i>Hebrew, Greek </i>and <i>Latine</i> Letters
altogether. <font color="#FF0000">{Ethicus Astronomus fortasse. N. deest
ergo Anglice dedi Ethnick.}</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fifthly, This obscuring was by their inventing other
letters, then those which were in use in their own, or any other Nation,
being framed meerly by the pattern of their own fancy, which surely is
the greatest impediment; yet this was the practice of <i>Artesius in lib.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sixthly, They used not the Characters of Letters,
but other Geometrical Characters, which have the power of Letters according
to the several Position of Points, and Markes. And these he likewise made
use of.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seventhly, There is a greater Art of obscuring, which
is called <i>Ars Notoria, </i>which is the Art of Noting and Writing, with
what brevity, and in what manner we desire. This way the <i>Latines</i>
have delivered many things. I held it necessary to touche at these obscurings,
because it may fall out, I shall thorow the magnitude of our Secrets discourse
this way, that I may help you so farre as I may.

union, but one may be dissolved from another by the nature of water, which
is the subject of liquefaction in the spirit, which is the <i>Medium </i>betwixt
the dry parts and the Oyl. The dissolution being made there will remain
in the spirit, a pure humidity, vehemently mixed with dry parts, which
are moved in it, when the fire resolves it, which is sometimes called of
the Philosophers, <i>Sulphur fusibile,</i> sometimes Oyl, other while an
aery humour, sometime a conjunctive substance, which the fire separates
not, sometimes <i>Camphore:</i> and if you please, this is the Philosophers
Egge, or rather the <i>Terminus</i> and end of the Egge; and it came to
us from these Oyls, and may be esteemed amongst the subtilities, when it
is purged and separated from the water and oyl in which it is. Further,
the Oyl is corrupted by grinding it with deficeating things, as with salt
or <i>Atrimentum,</i> and by assation, because there is a passion arising
from the contrary; and afterwards it is to be sublimated, until it be deprived
of † its oleagineity, <font color="#FF0000">{† Al. Olio suo.}</font> and

purged and whitened. Which wholsom exaltation is made either in hot or
moist fire: The distilation must be re-iterated, that it may sufficiently
receive its goodnesse, until it be rectified, the signs of its last rectification
are candor and crystalline serenity: And when other things grow black,
by fire, this grows white, is cleansed, shines with clearnesse and admirable
splendour. From this water and its earth comes <i>Argentum vivum</i> in

of <i>Aristotle,</i> which is no Stone, it's set in a Pyramid a hot place,
or (if you please) in the belly of an Horse or Ox, and it imitateth an
acute Feavor. For from seven to fourteen, and from that it sometimes proceeds
to one and twenty, that the Fecis of the Elements may be dissolved in its
water, before it be separate: The dissolution and distillation is to be
iterated, until it be rectified. And here is the end of this intention.
Yet know that when you have consummated your work, you are then to begin.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another Secret I shall shew you, you must prepare
<i>Argentum

the vapour of Lead for the Stone <i>Iberus; </i>then let it be ground with
desiccating things, and <i>Attramentis,</i> and the like, as is said, and
let there be an assation: Then let there be a sublimation * if for Pearles
twelve times; <font color="#FF0000">{* Al. Septies.}</font>&nbsp; if for

corrupted. Nor is it possible, that its humidity be separated by vapour,
as the fore-said oyl; because its vehemently mixed with its dry parts;
nor doth it constitute,as in the foresaid metals. In this Chapter you may
be deceived, unlesse you distinguish of the signification of the words.
It's now high time I involve the third Chapter: that you acquire the Calx,
the * Calx of the body, <font color="#FF0000">{* Al. Clavem operis.} </font>which
you intend, the body is calcined, when it is appodiated,<i> i.e.</i> that

me for some Secrets. Take then the Stone, and calcine it with a light assation
and strong contrition, or with acute things. But in the end mingle it a
little with sweet water, and compound a Laxative Medicine of seven things
(if you will) or of six, or of five, or as many as you please; but my mind
rests in two things, whose proportion is better than the other fixt proportion,

tried it better; <font color="#FF0000">{Al. Mollius caleseant.} </font>but
if you will credit me, take one thing that is the Secret of Secrets of
Nature, able to do Miracles. Let it be mixed from two or more, or a Phoenix,
which is a singular creature † at the fire, <font color="#FF0000">{† Al.

four or five times be applied, you have the composition. Yet afterwards
the coelestial nature is deliberated, if you infuse hot water three or
four times. Divide therefore the week from the strong in several vessels,
if you believe me: Let that which is good be evacuated. Again, use the
pouder, and the water which remains, carefully expresse: For of a certain,
it will produce the parts of the pouder, not incorporated : therefore take
the water by it self; because the pouder exiccated from it hath power to
be incorporated into the Laxative Medicine. Work therefore as formerly,
until you distinguish the strong from the weak, and apply the pouder three,
four, five times or oftener, and

it with water of <i>Alkali,</i> and by such acute things you make the violence
of the Medicine. But if by reason of the acuity and softnesse of the Medicine
it be broken, the pouder, being applied, apply very carefully more of the
hard and soft. But if it be by reason of the abundance of the pouder apply
more of the Medicine; if it be by reason of the strength of the water,
water it with pistils; <font color="#FF0000">{Pistillo.}</font> and congregate
the matter, as you can, and separate the water by little and little, and
it will return to its state, which water you must exiccate: for it contains
both pouder and water of the Medicine, which are to be incorporated, as
the principle pouder. Here you may not sleep, because here is contained
a very great and profitable Secret. If you rightly order in a right series
of things, the parts of the Shrub or Willow, they will keep natural union
: and do not deliver this to oblivion, for it is profitable for many things.
You must mingle Pearls with the made union: <font color="#FF0000">{Unione

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><i>Philosophers Egge. </i>49</b>
<p>thing like the Stone <i>Iberus:</i> and without doubt it mortifies that
which is to be mortified by the vapour of Lead. You shall find Lead, if
you expresse the living from the dead; and the dead you must bury in <i>Olibanum</i>
and <i>Sarcocolla.</i> Keep this Secret, for it is of some profit, and
so must you do with the vapour of Pearls, and the Stone <i>Tagus,</i> and
you must (as I have said) bury the dead.

630. I return this Answer. You must have the Medicine which may be dissolved
in the thing liquified and steeped in it, and penetrate its interiour parts,
and may be mingled with it;and it may not be a fugitive servant,but transmute
it. Let it be mingled by reason of the spirit, and let it be fixed by the

Take then of the bones of <i>Adam,</i> and of the Calx the same weight;
let there be six to the Stone <i>Tagi, </i>and five to the stone of Pearl;
let them be ground with <i>Aqua vitae,</i> whose property it is to dissolve
all other things, so as in it they are dissolved and assated, until it
be incerate, <i>i.e.</i> let the parts be united, as the parts in wax.
The sign of inceration is, that the Medicine liquifies upon iron very hot.
Then let it be put in the same water in some hot and moist place, or let
it hang in the vapour of waters made very hot: after that dissolve and
congeal them against the Sunne, Afterwards take Saltpeter, and <i>argentum
vivum</i> shall be converted into lead : And again, wash the lead with
it, and mundifie it, that it may be the next to silver, and then work as
a pious man, and also the whole weight must be 30. But yet of Saltpeter

<p>first matter, of which you have <i>Aristotle </i>speaking in vulgar
and known places, which makes me silent herein. When you have this, you
have pure, simple and equal Elements. And this you may do by contrary thing
and various operations, which formerly I have called the Claves of the
Art. And <i>Aristotle</i> sayes, <i>That the equality of potencies excludes
action, and passion, and corruption.</i> And these things <i>Averrho's
</i>affirms,
reproving <i>Galen.</i> And this Medicine is esteemed the more pure and
simple which may be found, which is prevalent against Feavers, passions
of the mind and body. Farewell.<i> Whoever unlocks these,hath a key which
