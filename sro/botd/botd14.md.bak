### CHAPTER XIII.

#### THE WHITE BROTHERHOOD.

<span class="smallcaps">Time</span>, in itself, is an illusion; it
depends upon states of consciousness. When struggling in the black pool
each moment seemed an hour, each hour a day. The same holds good for the
man whose mind dwells on the things of earth alone and whose thoughts
are sensuous in their nature.

The secret of happiness lies in forgetting self, and any slight
diversion, business or amusement, which brings this end, brings a
proportioned happiness; but the happiness which comes from a willful and
conscious forgetfulness of self exceeds all others, and brings a state
of consciousness in which all sense of time is lost.

As the boat was drawn swiftly through the water we became lost in each
other's love. My heart, like hers, had now become responsive to the
divine vibrations in the celestial soul, and the happiness that comes
from this state cannot be told. Our thoughts were again brought back to
earth by our boat coming to a stop on the sandy shore. At

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

the same instant the clairvoyant vision and clairaudient hearing, which
had revealed to me the celestial presences in the æther, departed, and I
beheld the mysteries of the invisible world no longer. But Iole was
still with me, and looking up I beheld a white-robed assembly on the
strand around the boat.

"Arise, brother, your trials are over, and you have nobly won," said
Iole.

Hand in hand we stepped out upon the sand. The white-robed assembly
stood around with heads uncovered in reverence to the sacredness of our
love, when a beautiful woman advanced to meet me.

A cry of joy escaped my lips. "Triumph of love," I cried, "it is my
long-lost sister, Esmeralda!" Beautiful in youth, divinely beautiful
now! Like all those gathered around, her face revealed her spiritual
power and love.

"My noble brother," she said, as I embraced her fondly, "I told you we
would meet again, but neither you nor I ever dreamed of such a meeting."

"My darling sister," I answered, "this indeed is happiness beyond all
expectation; but may I ask concerning father and mother?"

"They live," she replied, with a glad smile, "but still farther on,
members of the Third Degree; and we shall meet them there. But, my
brother, we have met more recently than you think." "When and where?" I
asked in surprise.

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

"As the simple gipsy girl, known as Rahula, who met you at the ball."

"Ah, that explains your silence and timidity as you stood beside the
stately Turk; but why did you thus conceal your identity?"

"I was forbidden to make myself known; you had trials to meet, and the
occasion was also a test for me."

At this point a noble-looking old man with a long gray beard and large
golden girdle around his waist, advanced, and, bowing low, said in kind
and gentle voice:

"Brother, let your sisters lead you to the royal chamber."

As he spoke he made a motion to the assembly and all formed in lines to
make a triangle, he, as leader, forming the apex, while I, with Iole and
Esmeralda at my arms, marched in the center.

What a contrast since I had donned the robes of white! now all was
beautiful and my trials seemed all passed. We crossed the cavern and
entered a broad vaulted passage walled with marble and trimmed in gold
and silver. Everything was lighted by a diffused light from no apparent
source, and I could not help but marvel at the beauty of my brothers and
sisters as their faces shone under its radiance. Fully half of those who
formed my escort were women, and as we marched along the passage Iole
said:

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

"You now see man as the noblest work of God, where perfect form responds
to mind and spirit."

"Yes," said Esmeralda, "and you can now more fully realize the grandeur
of that philosophy which teaches that it is for the evolution of perfect
man that the universe came into being."

"Yes," answered Iole, "the chief end of God is to glorify man, and the
chief end of man should be to glorify God."

"And the latter can only be done through the former," said Esmeralda,
"for it is only through man that God can be glorified."

"Then," I replied, "if man but does his full duty to man, he performs
his full duty to God."

"That is the sum of all duties; man's duty is to man," they both replied
together.

We now reached a gilded gate which opened before us, and we entered a
large, white chamber, hexagonal in shape and with a pyramidal roof.
Around at the top of the walls was a golden finished frieze containing
the twelve signs of the zodiac in relief, while at the side of the
chamber, opposite the gate through which we had come, was a white
throne, in the center of which, in a golden chair, sat a man of
apparently middle age. His remarkably handsome face was beardless and
gave him a youthful appearance, while his features looked like those of
a man of age and thought. His uncovered head was [crowned](errata.htm#4.md)
with thick and

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

long golden curls, while his blue eyes shone with a luster even more
wonderful than that of my companions. Dressed in the loose and flowing
costume of the ancient Greeks, his manly form revealed the perfections
of human development.

At the left of the enthroned king sat a man who looked like an Apollo;
his form was also only partly clad by flowing garments, and his figure
thus revealed was indeed a symbol of strength and power. He evidently
represented or symbolized the sun, for his hands rested upon a disk-like
shield with a central dot and an encircling margin in gold. At the left
of the king sat a woman whose brunette beauty was marvelous to behold,
her black eyes and hair contrasting with wondrous effect with the pearly
form which showed all its lines of beauty through her light and flowing
drapery. Her white and shapely hands rested upon a large silver crescent
and she evidently symbolized the moon.

Dare any one brand this scene as immodest?

None but the pure were here. He who cannot view, without a blush of
shame, the human form when a perfect temple of divinity, stands
self-confessed; his mind is poisoned with impure thoughts; his
imagination corrupted by the taint of lust. Crossing the white floor of
polished marble, we approached a long white table in front of the
throne. I took the seat facing the king,

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

while Iole and Esmeralda took seats by me on each side. Then all the
sisters of the escort took seats upon the left, while the brothers took
those upon the right.

And now I noticed that the constellation Leo marked the zodiac above the
throne, and in it were the sun and moon in close conjunction.

All had thus far been silent, but now the gray-bearded leader arose,
and, with a bow to the king, commenced to speak:

"Most high and noble king, another star has risen, another child been
born into our kingdom; and we have brought him here to receive your
blessing and adoption."

The Master-king bowed with a smile, and in kind and gentle tones
addressed me:

"Dear brother, gladly do I welcome thee in the kingdom of true
brotherhood. It adds to our joy to see one more joined with the small
minority. All greet you as our brother."

As though in answer to his words, all the assembly around looked at me
and cried in chorus:

"Our brother, we greet you as our brother.'' How different this king
from the kings of earth, I thought; he greets me as a brother, and does
not deem a gentle smile and words of tenderness as inconsistent with
severity and power. And now, without noisy cry or spreading gesture,

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

he leaned forward in his chair, and in a calm, earnest, and
soul-stirring voice spoke:

"Brother, our special explanations and instructions will be given to you
by the proper teacher; but I will now lay out the square upon which we
build our temple.

"There is one God, one man, one Brotherhood, one truth; these are our
corner-stones, upon these we erect our structure.

"God is the Infinite and all-pervading Spirit, formless, immutable,
eternal and incomprehensible to all save itself.

"Man is an individualized manifestation of God in self-imposed
conditions; a center in the Infinite Essence around which the spirit
vibrates and through which it flows forth and reveals itself in the
world of forms and things.

"The one Brotherhood is humanity, the sum total of all the
individualized centers of the divine activity, which, while apparently
separate, are one in life and essence.

"Truth is the full, self-conscious realization of God within its
individualized manifestations and the illumination that comes to each
therewith.

"God comprehends all truth; and man, as God individualized, can
comprehend all truth through God in him."

He ceased speaking; but the wonderful magnetism

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

which accompanied his words remained, and for some moments a profound
stillness reigned. The meaning of words uttered with a spirit-impress
cannot be expressed in type; sound has a power unknown to writing.

Now the gray-bearded leader arose, and again bowing in respectful
reverence to the king, drew forth a white box from his robe. Shaking it
in his hand, he threw four dice upon the table. Three times he shook and
threw, then turned to the king and said:

"The throws sum fifty-one, and each time seventeen; the invisible powers
who rule these throws decree that our sister Iole shall deliver the
instructions." He turned to Iole with a bow. Pressing my hand upon the
table, she arose and, with a graceful and reverential bow to the king
and leader, addressed me:

"Is my brother's number forty-nine?"

I looked to the leader, and as he bowed I answered, "It is."

"Then," she said, addressing the leader and king with bold unflinching
eyes, "the meaning of this choice becomes revealed; fifty-one plus
forty-nine makes the square of ten, whose meaning you all know."

The gray-bearded leader gave an inquiring look at the king, who again
leaned forward and addressed me:

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

"Brother, the invisible powers say that you aspire to still higher
degrees; is this true?"

"I aspire to reach the highest summit, yea, even to God-hood does nay
soul aspire," I answered, with a wonderful lightness of heart and
consciousness of strength.

Without reply the king made a sign to the leader, and he and Iole took
their seats.

The lightly draped Apollo at the right of the king now spoke:

"I represent the sun, symbol of life, center of vitality and heart of
the solar essence that throbs through all within the boundaries of our
solar sphere. I am the spirit as it acts, and manifest in matter; but my
sign conceals a mystery and has two meanings; learn thou this secret and
thou shalt never die."

He ceased, and the woman on the left, in a clear, musical voice, spoke:

"I represent the moon, symbol of subtle matter, the essential substance
necessary to form and growth. I am the vehicle of spirit and the base
without which it could not act; my sign, too, conceals a mystery, and
has two meanings; learn thou its secret and thy form, made perfect, will
not dissolve."

She ceased, and the king again spoke:

Ever since the time when we met in the columned halls of Thebes and
Memphis, Osiris and Isis

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

have been with us; and their perfect and harmonious union in you will
make you Horus."

As he spoke all eyes turned toward the zodiac above the throne; doing
likewise, I saw a violet mist cover it. As the substance enveloped the
sign, it seemed alive with golden atoms which moved and vibrated rapidly
therein. The cloud continued but a moment, when it disappeared, and the
sign was visible once more; but instead of the sun and moon as before,
there was a golden disk with a white cross therein. As I wondered by
what strange mechanism this phenomena was accomplished, the leader arose
and gave the order: "To the hall of learning!"

The assembly immediately arose, and, with united bow to the king,
marched in double column from the hall.

We proceeded along a passage not unlike the one through which we had
entered, until we came to another vaulted chamber.

The frieze of this chamber was also a zodiac with movable planets in the
different signs, while the great stars also had their places. The walls
around were covered with mystic symbols, circles, triangles, crosses,
squares, lines, spots, letters, allegorical scenes and numbers. On the
four sides of the chamber were four remarkable pieces of statuary: a
golden lion, an ivory man, a gigantic eagle and a bull. In the center of
the hall was a

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

long, low table, made of a solid block of marble, and upon it were
cubes, miters, spheres, and like symbols. But there were two pieces of
art above all others the most remarkable. Near one end of the table was
a solid cube of the blackest marble, above this, supported by four
lotus-capital Egyptian columns, which rested upon the four corners of
the cube, was a pyramid with square base of transparent whiteness. In
the center of the space between the base of the pyramid and the top of
the cube were two marvelous figures close by a greenish-colored thread
which connected the pyramid with the cube. One was a demoniacal-looking
dwarf, made of some blood-red material, who with leering and malignant
features, was trying to cut the thread with a blood-smeared sword. The
other figure was a noble-looking man made of ivory. With features, every
line of which expressed an agonizing pain, he fought back the monstrous
dwarf with his bare and blood-stained hands and arms. This piece of art
held me with an irresistible fascination, until I was drawn by Iole to
an equally remarkable symbol at the other end of the table.

Here, in full life-size, was a man of pearl nailed upon a black cross,
while encircled around him and over the cross was a huge serpent which,
with its body emitting a red phosphorescent light, drank the blood which
actually dripped from the nail

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

wounds of the tortured man. The veins of the man were distended and
every line of his body expressed torture; but while his face showed
pain, it expressed wondrous fortitude.

A shiver ran through me, and turning my eyes away I saw across the table
a meditating Buddha sitting upon a gigantic lotus with petals made of
pearls. The calm look upon that meditating face was in marked contrast
with the tortured look of the figure upon the cross.

All these had been viewed in a few minutes. We now stopped on the vacant
side of the table, and, at a motion from our leader, a middle-aged man
with light curly whiskers and long brown hair stepped from the ranks
beside him and addressed me:

"Brother, the trials through which you have passed are not without their
meaning, and when explained they will, no doubt, be impressed indelibly
upon your mind."

As he spoke he pointed to a large vulture carved from black material,
which rested near him upon the table.

"Ever since the day when we left the now lost Atlantis for a new home in
the land of the Pyramids, the vulture, as a destroyer of all corruption
and things foul, has been the symbol of a sacred power. The initiated
hierophants of Egypt did not use the vulture symbol without reason; and,

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

like Prometheus among the Greeks, every one who enters here must let
this power consume his liver. But, unlike Prometheus, he must kill its
growth or, like him, be bound to the rocks in pain and misery."

He paused a moment, as though to let the words impress me, and then
continued:

"Next, no man can enter here who has not killed all thoughts of self,
and extinguished every selfish aspiration and all desires for life,
unless that life has an unselfish purpose. The tests to try your pride
and love of life, determined how you stood. When we asked you for your
wealth, you doubted; those were there who could read your colors, and
your thoughts were not concealed. Know that here no evil thought can be
concealed, your mind is an open book. Know also that doubt is a
canker-worm which ever breedeth fear and paralyzes strength; not doubt
of forms, and creeds, and dogmas, but doubt of the eternal excellence
and superiority of truth and justice. He who doubts not these eternal
principles ever adheres to the right, confident that, no matter what
appearances may indicate, he will in the end succeed and triumph over
all.

"Know, also, that we have no need of your money; what wealth we need,
our knowledge of nature's powers enables us to get. Now hear the
explanation and meaning of your further trials.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When you had
passed the tests of selfishness and cast aside the world's ambitions, we
considered you as man before the time of Adam.

"Man was then a celestial being, pure and innocent, but without
knowledge. Prompted by an inner intuition which dimly told him of his
inherent but latent possibilities, he aspired for wisdom and experience.
This aspiration brought a momentary light, and, gazing out into the
radiant depths of space, he beheld a vision of what he might be. Across
a black and murky pool, enveloped in dense clouds of smoke and noxious
odors, he saw a radiant sphere where men, once being like himself, had
evolved to the heights of perfection and become as gods, knowing good
and evil, and masters of all the powers of mind and will. The almost
latent light whispering to him said: 'Being, it is within thy power to
be like them, knowing all things, and conscious of the knowledge; but to
reach that height thou must cross that pool of black and murky matter,
descend into its depths and conquer all its horrid creatures. It is only
by passing through a world of evil that thou canst know what evil is;
and it is only by this knowledge that thou canst know and realize the
good.' 'I have no knowledge and know not the meaning of your words,'
answered the celestial being to the urging spirit within. 'but something
within tells me to listen to you

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

and if you prompt me on this journey I will trust your guidance.'

"Then did the inner light reply

"'O being! I would share myself with thee and make thee wise and
God-like; I not only urge thee to the journey, but give thee this my
promise: Through this awful pool of matter I will go with thee, and if
thou wilt but rely on me will ever guard and lead thee to the free upon
the other side. But before thou dost this journey undertake, listen to
my warning: Two paths lie through this awful whirlpool; one straight and
certain and not over-dangerous in its nature, the other devious and with
many pitfalls which make it most dangerous and productive of much pain.
The first is trod by those who take me for their guide and learn the
nature of suffering by sympathetic identification with those who suffer,
but who do not themselves bring suffering because they keep free from
the causes which produce it. Many who start with me lose sight of me
when the vapors gather around them; then, not hearing or listening to my
guiding voice, but deceived by the perfidious beauties which ever tempt
them, they take the second path. Great is their misery! long and painful
is their path! Thus deceived, they may descend so low and stray so far
that I can no longer reach them; then they die; absorbed in matter their
substance returns

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

into the All, and I return to help across another being. For know you,
celestial being, that it is my nature to seek to be a being with
individuality; but it is only by union with one like you that I can
realize my aspiration and reach the other side. You give yourself to me,
and I will give myself to thee; and together we will make the journey.
Separate, thou art devoid of mind, and I am formless essence; together,
you will bring to me individuality, and I will bring to thee a mind with
knowledge.'"

The speaker paused; his deep and earnest words had stirred my soul and
roused my intuition, and It told me the hidden meaning of his dialogue.

Iole, evidently anticipating what he next would say, now clasped my hand
and held it as the speaker continued:

"As in the universal evolution two paths lead to Nirvana, so here below
two paths lead to this chamber. Your loving sister sought to lead you
here through the path of love and light, but, like most, you wandered
and had to take the dark and downward path into the depths of earth. A
skeleton, which symbolized the death of spirit in the tomb of matter,
led you on until you reached the very slime of earth and fell into the
pool. But thou hadst not entirely lost sight of thy inner self, and
listening to its promptings thou hast won.

Hadst thou been blinded by thy fears and doubts

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

and not heard thy inner self, thy soul would have been lost. When the
king of matter tempted thee, thou gayest up thy life and all the world's
ambitions. This surrender was thy victory; for with this last
renunciation thou commenced the ascent, and the spirit brought thee
strength. Know, O aspirant, that ambition and the love of life are the
king passions which bind the soul to earth. Men laud ambition and in her
name try to justify their selfish fight for power and fame; but what is
selfish ambition compared to that more noble aspiration which,
forgetting self, labors for mankind? Your death brought life and
strength; you crossed the pool and met the witch. Most truly did she
tell you that you must kill a man; no one can enter here who has not
accomplished this, but that man is the lower self of him who seeks to
enter. When, listening to your inner spirit, you refused to take a human
life, you killed your lower self; into the grave you put it, and the
burial brought you peace. Peace brought you resurrection; you ascended
to a higher plane and your spirit was enthroned within the form which
was a tomb, but which now is a willing instrument of the higher self.

"As the path you entered led downward, the one by which you returned led
upward; the farther you descended, the darker things became; the higher
you ascended the brighter grew the light

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And now do we all
welcome the brother of the great degree."

He finished, and those around repeated in chorus:

"All hail our new-born brother! All hail our new-born brother!"

The orator took his position in the ranks, and the gray-bearded leader,
with a bow to Iole, made a motion, and the assembly immediately formed
into couples and departed.

"I will leave you to your other sister," said Esmeralda, as she took the
arm of a tall blonde brother.

"What is the course?" asked the leader, as he passed Iole.

"The law shall rule," answered Iole, as he departed, leaving us alone in
the room.

"Now, my dear brother, I will explain some of the symbols; but remember
that some symbols have more meaning than can be given in the largest
book, and these symbols have many keys and therefore many meanings."

As she spoke, she led me to the white pyramid connected with the black
cube by the slender thread of green.

"Recall the words of the orator, and the meaning of this symbol will be
plain," she said, as I gazed in silence at this truly marvelous work.
"The white pyramid symbolizes the higher self,

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

the spirit of the pilgrimage; the black cube symbolizes the lower man or
the celestial being after it is lost in matter. The being has sunk so
low that nothing but a thread connects it with the higher self, and the
passions and desires that arise from matter, and which are symbolized by
the red demon, would sever even this frail connection and destroy the
soul. The white figure symbolizes the spirit in the form which it takes
when in matter, and it is fighting and striving to preserve the
connection, although by so doing it perpetuates its pain. But rather
than again return and commence a new pilgrimage, the spirit hangs on to
its degraded vehicle until the last hour, hoping that by so doing it may
at last bring it back to the path from which it has wandered. For know
you, that the being once conjoined with spirit on this pilgrimage has a
will of its own, a will which the spirit cannot overcome unless the will
permits. The spirit is all-powerful on its own plane, but becomes
conditioned, as it were, when in matter. The contest seems unequal; the
white man has no weapons except the power of persuasion, to which
passion will not listen, and the cruel sword of the dwarf falls
relentlessly upon his bleeding arm, which would soon give way, but that
the pain heals it as fast as it is cut away. See the agony written on
his countenance! Many men thus allow passion and desire to torture their

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

higher natures until at last the demon conquers, the thread is severed,
and the soul is lost."

As she paused for a moment I questioned:

"But, Iole, can anything be destroyed?"

"Not in its essence," she answered, "both matter and spirit, as such,
are eternal and indestructible; but their individualized or special
combinations are not unless the will that rules them so wills. At this
separation of the lower from the higher, or spirit from matter, spirit
returns into the Universal Spirit and matter into the universal matter;
but the individuality that came from their union is lost. Know that the
occult teaching that man can lose his soul is most scientific when
correctly understood. All souls either attain to spiritual individuality
and pass on to God-like perfection, or are dissipated and dissolved.
Many men now live on the earth whose higher souls have left them; such
are the monsters who sometimes appear in the forms of men and startle
the world with their wickedness. But this is a vast and deep study—this
study of the soul; let us proceed to the other symbols."

Near by rested a large black cube, and as we came to it she said:

"This you no doubt understand, but it has many meanings; let me explain:

"This black cube symbolizes the four elements or principles which make
the lower man; that is,

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

earth, water, fire and air, or the essences which these words
symbolize."

She pressed a spring, and the ends and sides of the cube unfolded on the
floor and formed a cross, four squares high and three squares broad.

"You see," she said, "that by counting the center twice there are seven
squares, which symbolize the seven principles which make the complete
man. As a black body is an instrument of torture for the spirit which
inhabits it, so here we have the cross likewise an instrument of
torture; and as man with arms extended makes a cross, so also does the
cube gilded. Likewise man with arms extended makes a square of four
equal measures; the four which make his height being equal to the four
which make his width, and four times four equal sixteen, a perfect
square, and the fourth power of the duad, two. Such is mystic
mathematics."

We closed the cross into its cubic shape and approached the other
wondrous symbol. For a moment she stood by in silence; then in a deep,
solemn and soul-stirring voice, said:

"This explains the mystery of Christ, the meaning of the crucifixion and
the mystery of pain. The black cross, as just explained, represents
man's lower nature, this body, a tomb for the spirit and au instrument
for its torture. Nailed upon or fastened to this cross, or form of
flesh, is the Divine

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Man, Christos, the
Son of God. The serpent encircled around is the serpent of desire and
passion, lust, avarice and hate, and its life depends upon the blood
which issues from those bleeding wounds. How truly does this symbolize
the life of all men of earth; it is a universal symbol, and applicable
to all men, for every man who feeds his lusts and passions or yields to
the lower nature, crucifies the Christ within him. Every evil act we do,
every impure thought we think, every evil aspiration or desire, tortures
the divine man within ourselves, and feeds this horrid monster of desire
with fresh blood, which represents the life of Christ, drawn with
acutest pain."

She paused, and I thought—how beautiful, yet how pathetic, this
interpretation of the story of Christ; how much misunderstood this
wonderful allegory, teaching a universal truth.

"Iole," I said, "I see that you give an allegorical interpretation to
the story of Christ; do you believe that a historical Christ existed?"

"That a character existed around whose life the Christ-story was
builded, I have no doubt; but the Universal Christ, the divine in man,
has always existed and has never died. All ancient Scriptures have an
esoteric meaning, and under the forms of allegories and symbols the
great truths of the universe and man, the macrocosm and the microcosm,
are veiled; but veiled so

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

lightly that all who seek can find their meanings. Paradoxically, the
most deeply hidden is the most open; but the blind pass by and will not
see. The universe is built upon simplicity, but superficial and selfish
minds know not the meaning of this word. Men seeking for a mystery
overlook this truth; relying solely on the intellect, they scorn to see
philosophy in the simple parables of every-day events. But Jesus thus
taught, for parables were his constant method, and his philosophy of
human life, thus dimly veiled, was told to his disciples. St. Paul, his
eminent successor, taught in like manner, and, still later, Origen and
Clement of Alexandria. All the gnostics and Neoplatonic Christians
taught the same, and down to the time of Constantine the esoteric
meaning of the Scriptures was acknowledged."

Again she paused, and as I stood looking at this solemn symbol of the
mystic Christians a wonderful compassion arose within me.

"Come," she said, "these wondrous symbols must be explained at length
some other time; we will now pass to the others."

Then she explained the meanings of the man, the ox, the lion and the
eagle, dwelling with great care upon each; suffice it to say that the
mystic language of the Hebrew prophets was for the first time made
clear. Having thus received a brief synopsis of the many symbols in the
hall of

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

learning, we left the chamber of that name and proceeded along another
corridor. If I had ever doubted that knowledge came from the unfolding
of an inner faculty, I now doubted it no longer. I was beginning to
realize this inner light, but Iole seemed to already possess universal
knowledge. No question could I ask but what I got an answer; and thus
continuing our conversation, with active minds and hearts attuned to tn.
same key, we proceeded along the corridor on our wav to the hall of
choice.
