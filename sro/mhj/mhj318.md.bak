### CHAP. XVII.

#### Instructions for the Provincial.

<span class="smallcaps">By</span> far the greater part of the code of
laws which has just been laid before the reader as relating to the
*Regents* and *Prefects* of the Illuminées, was originally written by
Weishaupt for the instruction of his Provincials. This is evident from
the first digest of these laws, as they appear in the second part of the
second volume of the Original Writings of the Sect, from page 17 to 43.
It is even one of those parts which Knigge looked upon as a master-piece
of politics. <span id="fr_240"></span>[1](#fn_240.md) So replete with
artifice did he think it, that he deemed it a pity to circumscribe the
knowledge of it to the Provincials alone. The reader has seen what use
he has made of them, thoroughly persuaded that the Regents in general,
and particularly the Local Superiors, could greatly benefit the Order by
attending to them. The Areopagites and General consented to these new
dispositions; but the following part of this chapter remained
appropriated to the Provincials.

"I. The Provincial shall make himself perfect master of the whole
constitution of the Order. The system of it should be as familiar to him
as if he had invented it."

"II. As a guide for all his actions, he shall adopt the whole government
and the instructions already laid down for the Regents and Local
Superiors, not neglecting a single rule. "

"III. The Provincial shall be chosen by the Regents of his Province, and
be confirmed by the National Superior. . . . <span
id="fr_241"></span>[2](#fn_241.md) The high Superiors (the Areopage and
General) have the power of deposing him."

"IV. He shall be a native of, or at least be thoroughly acquainted with
the province under his inspection."

"V. He shall be [engaged](errata.htm#76.md) as little as possible in public
concerns, or in any other enterprize, that he may devote all his time to
the Order."

"VI. *He shall assume the character of a man retired from the world, and
who only seeks rest*."

"VII. He shall fix his residence as nearly as possible in the centre of
his province, the better to watch over the different districts."

"VIII. On his being named Provincial, he shall leave his former
characteristic, and assume that which the high Superiors shall give
him.—The

<span id="page_559">p. 559</span>

same Superiors will send him the impression of the seal he is to bear,
and he will wear it engraved on his ring."

"IX. The archives of the province, which the Regents will have taken
care to seal up and carry away on the demise of his predecessor, are to
be entrusted to him on his nomination."

"X. The Provincial will monthly transmit the general report of his
province to the National Inspector immediately over him. As he himself
only receives the reports of the Local Superiors a fortnight after the
month is up, he will necessarily be always a month behind-hand, making,
for example, the report of May about the end of June, and so on. This
report will be subdivided into as many parts as he has Prefects under
his inspection. He will carefully note every thing of consequence that
has happened in any of the schools or lodges: also the names, ages,
country, station in life, and the date of the *reversal* letters, of
each new adept; the high Superiors wishing to have no further
information concerning the new adepts until they come to the class of
Regent, unless on some particular occasion."

"XI. Beside this monthly report, he is to apply to the National Superior
in all extraordinary cases which are not left to his decision. He is
also to send in his personal tablets every three months; and he will
undertake no political enterprize without having first consulted."

"XII. He has nothing to do with the other Provincials. Let things go on
well or ill in a neighbouring province, it is no business of his. If he
wishes to ask any thing of the other Provincials, let him apply to the
National Inspector."

"XIII. If he has any complaint to make against the Inspector, he will
direct his letter *Soli* or *Primo*."

"XIV. All the Regents of the province are his counsellors; they are to
second and help him in all his enterprizes. If it be convenient to him,
he should have two of them near his person to serve him as secretaries."

"XV. He confirms the nominations of all the Superiors of the inferior
degrees. He also names the Prefects, but they must be approved by the
Director, who can refuse his sanction."

"XVI. He has a right to send the brethren *who are pensioned* by the
Order, and to employ them in those parts of the province where he may
think them most useful."

"XVII and XVIII. He transmits the characteristics of the brethren and
geographical names of the lodges to the Prefects, as he receives them
from the high Superiors."

"XIX. He is also to send the names of the excluded brethren, that an
exact list may be preserved in all the assemblies."

"XX. When he has any reprimand to make to a Brother, whom it may be
dangerous to offend, he will assume an unknown hand, and the signature
of *Basyle*. This name, which no member of the Order bears, is
peculiarly preserved for that object.

<span id="page_560">p. 560</span>

"XXI. He will sometimes write to the Inferior degrees; and on the
proposition of the Epopts he will decide what books are to be put into
the hands of the young adepts according to the degrees they are in.—He
is as much as possible to promote libraries, cabinets of natural
philosophy, *Musæums*, collections of manuscripts, &c. in the most
convenient parts of his Province; these, it may easily be conceived, are
only intended for the adepts.

"XXII. The Provincial opens the letters of the *Minor* and *Major*
Illuminees which are directed *Soli*. He also reads the *Quibus Licets*
of the Epopts and *Primos* of the Novices; but can neither open the
*Primo* of the Minerval, the *Soli* of the Knight, nor the *Quibus
Licet* of the Regent." <span id="fr_242"></span>[3](#fn_242.md) This
gradual power of opening the letters of the Brethren according to the
degree they belong to, plainly indicates that some mark peculiar to each
degree is made use of; but I have not been able to discover that mark.
The reader will have observed, that all the letters, even the *Quibus
Licets*, are opened by Brethren of a higher degree than that of the
adept who writes; and consequently he can never know who it is that
answers him, as the rules of this Hierarchy are only made known to the
Brethren in proportion as they rise in dignity. The Provincial himself
can only form a conjecture as to the persons who open his letters and
those of the other Brethren which he is not permitted to open himself.

"XXIII. He shall raise no Brother to the degree of Regent, without
having first obtained the consent of the National Inspector.

"XXIV. He is to inform the Dean of the branch of science which each new
adept has made choice of on his admission into the Minerval Academy.

"XXV. Lest any of the Archives should be mislaid, he will take care to
form but one bundle of all the tablets, reversal letters, and other
documents relating to the same adept.

"XXVI. He will apply himself to procure as many co-operators as possible
for the Order, in the scientific branches.

"XXVII. He will transmit to the Deans all remarkable treatises or
discourses, and every thing relative to the degree of Epopt; for
example, the lives historical or characteristic, dissertations, &c.

"XXVIII. If among the Epopts any men be found endowed with great
talents, but little fitted for the political government of the Order,
the Provincial must devise means of removing them from such functions.

"XXIX. When the Chapters of the Scotch Knights are composed of more than
twelve Knights, he will raise the ablest among them to the degree of
Epopt.

"XXX. In each Chapter he will have a confidential Epopt, who will be his
*secret censor* or spy.

"XXXI. The Provincial will receive his letters patent from the National
Superior—When he issues those for the Chapters of the Scotch Knights, he
will make use of the following formula: 'We of the Grand Lodge of the
*Germanic Orient*, constituted Provincial and Master of the district of
N N, make known that by these presents we give to the venerable Brother
(here is the characteristic and true name of the new Venerable or
Master) full powers to

<span id="page_561">p. 561</span>

erect a secret Chapter of the *most holy* <span class="smallcaps">Scotch
Masonry</span>, and to propagate this *Royal Art* conformably to his
instructions by the establishment of new Masonic Lodges of the three
symbolic degrees—Given at the Directory of the District—

"XXXII. To say every thing in a few words, the Provincial has the
special charge of putting his province in a proper situation for
attempting every thing for the general good, and for preventing all
evil.—*Happy the state where our Order shall have acquired such power!*
Nor will it prove a difficult task for the Provincial who shall
implicitly follow the instructions of his high Superiors.—Seconded by so
many able men *deeply versed in moral sciences*, submissive and secretly
labouring like himself, there can be no noble enterprize which he may
not undertake, nor evil design which he cannot avert—Therefore let there
be no connivance at faults; no *Nepotism*, no private piques; no views
but for the general good; no object, no motives but those of the Order.
And let the Brethren rely upon us, that we shall never create any
Provincials but such as are capable of fulfilling these duties; *but let
it be also remembered, that we reserve in our hands all the means
necessary for chastising the man who should presume to abuse the power
he has received from us*." <span id="fr_243"></span>[4](#fn_243.md)

"XXXIII. This power must never be employed but for the good of the
Brethren. We should indeed help all whom we can help; but when the
circumstances are similar, the members of our society are always to have
the preference.—Particularly as to those whose fidelity is proof against
all the powers of seduction. In their support let us be prodigal of our
toils, our money, *our honour*, our goods, even our blood; and *let the
least affront offered to any Illuminee be the general cause of the
Order*."

Thus terminate the instructions for the Provincial. They forewarn us of
the existence of a most tremendous power above him whence all the
authority of the Order emanates; a power which reserves to itself the
means of chastising whoever shall abuse that portion which it has
entrusted to any of its adepts; that is to say, who shall not have made
it subservient to the grand object and to all the plots of the
Sect.—There are, in fact, three offices in the hierarchal Orders of
Superiors above the Provincial. First, the *National Directors*, then
the *Supreme Council* called the *Areopagites* by the Sect, the
authority of which extends over the [Illuminees](errata.htm#77.md) of all
nations; and that is presided over by the *General of the Order*. The
following Chapter will give every light on these supreme Magistrates of
Illuminism which the known Archives of the Sect can reflect.
