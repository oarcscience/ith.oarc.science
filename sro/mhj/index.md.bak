This is the third part (of four) of Abbé Barreul's massive polemic
history of the French Revolution. This portion of this book is of
interest because it contains extensive quotes from the actual literature
of the Bavarian Illuminati. This is the most comprehensive work in
English on the historical theory, structure and practice of the Bavarian
Illuminati. It complements Robison's [Proofs of a
Conspiracy](../pc/index.md), the other major contemporary account.

Founded in 1776, shortly before the American Revolution, the Bavarian
Illuminati were a secret society with a revolutionary ideology, and a
centralized structure. According to Abbé Barreul, they subverted the
Masonic lodges of Europe, and were one of the key driving forces behind
the French Revolution. New members were gradually initiated into the
group's radical ideas, which, according to Barreul, were atheist and
anarchist in essence.

Barreul was very conservative, and his translator, Robert Edward
Clifford, likewise. However, Barreul was a serious historian, even
though he wrote from a decidedly non-neutral point of view. As a
contemporary, he was able to view the primary source documents and
interview participants. As such this book is today, in and of itself, a
primary source.

Today, civil society in Europe and America has enshrined the ideas of
'Liberty and Equality' that Barreul thought would lead to the complete
breakdown of civilization. The Bavarian Illuminati are considered by
some to be the forerunners of the Communist and Fascist movements.
However, as I have stated before, this is probably parallel evolution.
The more paranoid believe that the Illuminati (or some equivalent, such
as a cabal of reptilian shape-shifters) are still in business and
manipulating, *e.g.*, world leaders, the education system, and mass
movements. But this is for the individual reader to decide... *--J.B.
