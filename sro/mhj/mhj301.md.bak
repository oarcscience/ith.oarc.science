# THE

# ANTISOCIAL CONSPIRACY

### PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS

*On the Illuminees* <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) *and on the
different Works whereon these* <span class="smallcaps">Memoirs</span>
*are grounded*.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> third conspiracy, which I am now
about to investigate, is that of the *Atheistical Illuminees*, which at
my outset <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md) I denominated *the
conspiracy of the Sophisters of Impiety and Anarchy against every
religion natural or revealed; not only against kings, but against every
government, against all civil society, even against all property
whatsoever*.

The name of Illuminee which this Sect (the most disastrous in its
principles, the most extensive in its views, the most atrociously
cunning in its means) has chosen, is of ancient standing in the annals
of disorganizing Sophistry. It was the name which Manes and his
disciples first affected, *gloriantur Manichæi se de cælo
illuminatos*. <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md) The first Rosicrucians
also, who appeared in Germany, called themselves Illuminees. And later,
in our time, the *Martinists* (with many other sects) have pretended to
Illuminism. As an outline for history I distinguish them by their plots
and tenets, and will reduce them into two classes, the *Atheistical* and
the *Theosophical* Illuminees. These latter more particularly comprehend
the *Martinists*, whom I have already mentioned in my second volume, and
the *Swedenbourgians*, whom I shall mention in [their](errata.htm#0.md)
proper place, where also I shall give what information I have been able
to collect relating to them. The Atheistical Illuminees are the objects
of the present volume, and it is their conspiracy that I mean to
disclose.

The very numerous letters, books, and manuscripts, which I have received
since the publication of my proposals, has rendered it impossible for me
to comprise the proposed investigation in one volume. The baleful
projects of the Sect and the laws for their execution are so strangely
combined, that I thought it necessary to begin by making my reader
perfectly acquainted with its code; that is to say, with the regular
progression of its degrees, mysteries, and government.

This alone requiring an entire volume, I am reduced to the necessity of
giving a fourth, in which I shall develope the history of Illuminism,
and make

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

an application of the triple conspiracy to the French Revolution. I have
more particularly applied myself to the investigation of the legislative
part of this conspiring Sect, as no work has yet been published in which
the whole of their code is to be found. Detached parts only were to be
met with scattered throughout the papers which had been seized by the
public authority. These I have collected and digested; thus enabling the
reader more easily to judge what has been and what must have been the
result of such laws. In such an undertaking, I feel myself bound to lay
before the public an account of the documents on which I ground my
proofs. The following then is a list of the principal works, with a few
observations on each, that the reader may form his own judgment as to
their authenticity.

I. The first is a collection entitled "Some of the Original Writings of
the Sect of Illuminees, which were discovered on the 11th and 12th of
October, 1786, at Landshut, on a search made in the House of the Sieur
Zwack, heretofore Counsellor of the Regency; and printed by Order of His
Highness the Elector.—Munich, by Ant. Franz, Printer to the
Court." <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)

II\. The second is a supplement to the *Original Writings*, chiefly
containing those which were found on a search made at the castle of
Sandersdorf, *a famous haunt of the Illuminees*, by order of His
Highness the Elector. Munich, 1787. <span id="fr_4"></span>[5](#fn_4.md)

These two [volumes](errata.htm#1.md) contain irrefragable proofs of the
most detestable conspiracy. They disclose the principles, the object,
and the means of the Sect; the essential parts of their code, the
diligent correspondence of the adepts, particularly that of their chief,
and a statement of their progress and future hopes. The editors indeed
have carried their attention so far, as to mention by whose hand the
principal documents or letters were written. At the beginning of the
first volume, and on the frontispiece of the second, is seen the
following *remarkable advertisement* by order of the Elector:—"Those who
may harbour any doubt as to the authenticity of this collection, have
only to apply to the office where the secret archives are kept at
Munich, and where orders are left to show the originals." <span
id="fr_5"></span>[6](#fn_5.md)

I entreat that my readers will recollect this advertisement whenever
they shall see the *Original Writings* cited.

III\. "*The True Illuminee*, or the real and perfect *Ritual of the
Illuminee*; of the Illuminee; comprehending the *Preparation*, the
*Noviciate*, the *Minerval Degree*, that of the *Minor* and *Major
Illuminee*, all without addition or omission."—With respect to the
authenticity of this work, we need only quote the testimony of the Baron
Knigge, surnamed *Philo*, the most famous of the Illuminees after the
Founder of the Sect; and who was actually the chief compiler of its
Code, as he tells us himself: "All these degrees (says he), such as I
composed them, have been printed this year at *Edesse* (Frankfort on the
Mein) under the title of the *True Illuminee*. I am ignorant of the
author; but *they appear exactly as they flowed from my pen*; that is to
say, as I compiled them." <span id="fr_6"></span>[7](#fn_6.md) This
certainly is an authenticated document *on the Sect*, and recognized by
the compiler himself.

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

IV\. I now proceed to a work which was published by this same
Philo,—under the title of "*Last Observations*, or *Last Words of
Philo*, and Answers to divers Questions on my connections with the
Illuminees." In this work *Philo*-Knigge gives us an account of himself
and of his Illuminism, of his agreements with the chiefs of the Sect,
and of his labours for it. His vanity, however, makes this narrative
fulsome. The reader will observe in his writings one of those pretended
Philosophers who treat all religious objects with that contempt which
they themselves deserve. This is of no consequence; he attempts to
justify his own conduct; his avowals may therefore be received in
testimony against the Sect.

V. "The last Works of *Spartacus* and *Philo*," *Die neusten Arbeiten
des Spartacus und Philo*. Except the *Original Writings*, this is the
most intelligent and important work that has been published on the
Illuminees. It contains the two degrees of the greatest consideration
both on account of the mysteries revealed in them by the Sect, and of
the laws laid down for the adepts.—Not a shadow of doubt can be
maintained as to the authenticity of this work. These degrees and laws
are published with a certificate of *Philo* attesting their conformity
with the original, and under the seal of the Order. This certificate was
scarcely necessary. *Whoever can read* must easily perceive that these
degrees and these laws are no other than a compilation, and often (in
the most essential parts) but a copy of the discourses, precepts, and
principles, contained in the *Original Writings*. The publisher is a man
who has passed through all the degrees of Illuminism. More dexterous
than *Philo*, he makes himself master of his secret, and of that of the
whole Sect. The better to unmask Illuminism, he becomes an Illuminee;
and he has so well succeeded, that no member of the Order was better
acquainted with it than himself.

VI\. The same writer has published *A Critical History of the Degrees of
Illuminism*, a valuable work, in which every thing is proved from the
very letters of the grand adepts.

VII\. The *Directing Illuminee*, or the *Scotch Knight*. This may be
said to be the counterpart of the *Last Works of Philo and Spartacus*.
It is a description of the most important intermediary degree of
Illuminism. The Editor does not indeed publish it under the signet of
the Order; but when the reader has compared it with the *Original
Writings*, and even with the criticism on it by the chief, who was not
much pleased with the compiler, he will soon decide that the grand seal
of the Order is not necessary to authenticate it.

VIII\. *Remarkable Depositions respecting the Illuminees*. These are
three juridical depositions on oath, and signed 1st by Mr. *Cosandy*,
Canon and Professor at Munich; 2dly by Mr. *Renner*, Priest and
Professor of the same Academy; 3dly by Mr. *Utzschneider*, Counsellor of
the Electoral Chamber; 4thly by Mr. *George Grümberg*, a member of the
Academy of Sciences, and Professor of Mathematics. As every thing is
juridical in these depositions, it would be useless for me to insist on
the weight they must carry with them. These were four pupils, who did
not wait to be initiated in the grand mysteries of the Sect to form
their judgement on, and to quit the Sect. They

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

were cited at a tribunal to declare all they knew, and they answered
with moderation and truth. Their depositions will find a place in the
historical part of this work.

IX\. The *Apologies* published by some of the leaders of the Sect are
also to be classed among the incontrovertible evidence which we have
acquired. These gentlemen will not be expected to have aggravated their
own wickedness.

X. The list would be endless were I to subjoin all the works that have
been written against the Sect. But I must distinguish in this place the
works of Mr. *Hoffman*, Professor at the University of Vienna. I am but
little acquainted with those of Doctor *Zimmerman*, though I have been
informed by letter, that he furnished many valuable articles in a
journal published at Vienna, and chiefly directed against the Sect. I
often find Mr. *Stark*’s name mentioned as a strenuous opponent of the
Sect. I have seen no publication with his name to it, except an Apology
in Answer to the Calumnies of the Sect, which it continues to repeat,
notwithstanding the victorious manner in which he has answered them.

Among the anonymous writings I find an excellent work entitled the
*Ultimate fate of the Free-masons* (*Endliches schicksal des Frey-maurer
Ordens*). It is a discourse pronounced at the breaking-up of a
Freemason's Lodge. The writer of this discourse gives an excellent
statement of the reasons why the Lodges should suspend their labours
since Illuminism had intruded itself into Masonry.—I believe he would
have pronounced this discourse much sooner, had he known that all Lodges
were not so pure as his own.

I have also perused the *Biographical Fragments* of the Sieur *Bode*, a
famous Illuminee; these will be very useful in our Historical Volume. As
to numberless other works which I have read on the same subject, it will
suffice to give the titles of them when quoted. I have said more than
enough to show that I am not in the dark with respect to the subject on
which I am writing.

I could wish to express my gratitude to those virtuous men who, by their
correspondence, and the memorials which they have sent me, have greatly
advanced my undertaking. But open expressions of such a gratitude would
prove fatal to them. To have contributed to the public utility is a
sufficient reward for their virtue; and if my work is not so perfect as
it ought to be, it arises not from any want of energy in their
endeavours.

I find myself much against my will obliged to answer certain objections
which my Translator has made, and which will, doubtless, be repeated by
many other readers, grounded on the work of Mr. Robison, entitled *Proof
of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and Governments of Europe, &c.
&c.* That work was published just as this Third Volume was going to the
press. Its author had not then met with my two first Volumes; but in a
second Edition he is pleased to mention them in his Appendix. I am much
flattered by his approbation, heartily congratulate him on the zeal he
has himself shown in combating the public enemy, and am happy to see
that he has wrought on the best materials. Without knowing it, we have
fought for the same cause with

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

the same arms, and pursued the same course; but the public are on the
eve of seeing our respective quotations, and will observe a remarkable
difference between them. I fear lest we should be put in competition
with each other, and the cause of truth suffer in the conflict. I
entreat the reader to observe, that these differences arise from the
different methods followed by him and myself. Mr. Robison has adopted
the easiest, though the most hazardous method. He combines together in
one paragraph what his memory may have compiled from many, and sometimes
makes use of the expressions of the German author when he thinks it
necessary. Beside, he has seen much, and read much, and relates it all
together in the paragraphs marked by *inverted Commas*. The warning he
has given in his preface will not suffice to remove the objections of
some readers. In some passages he has even adopted as truth certain
assertions which the correspondence of the Illuminees evidently
demonstrate to have been invented by them against their adversaries, and
which in my Historical Volume I shall be obliged to treat in an opposite
sense. Nor will I pretend to say, that Illuminism drew its origin from
Masonry; for it is a fact demonstrated beyond all doubt, that the
founder of Illuminism only became a Mason in 1777, and that two years
later than that he was wholly unacquainted with the mysteries of
Masonry. <span id="fr_7"></span>[8](#fn_7.md)

I know perfectly well, that this will not make Illuminism less
disastrous; nevertheless I am obliged to differ from Mr. Robison when
treating on that subject, as well as on some other articles.—So much for
objections; here is my reply.

In the first place Mr. Robison and I always agree as to the essential
facts and the Conspiracy of the Illuminized Lodges; we also agree on
their maxims and degrees; and this must be sufficient to convince the
reader.

In the next place, in his general view of the Sect he has observed its
detestable and most dangerous principles. Like a traveller he has seen
the

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens . . .</span>

</div>

But he has not described its forms, its manners, and its habits. Nor
would it be very prudent to reject his narrative because some few
circumstances are not perfectly authenticated, or because here and there
some want of order may be observable.

In short, if we except one or two letters, which may be said to be
translations, all the other quotations (though in the form of letters)
cannot be called so, for they are not to be found in the letters of the
Illuminees. They are Extracts from different parts, all brought together
under one head; Mr. Robison has given them to the public in his own
stile, and sometimes makes the Illuminees speak in clearer terms than is
done in the Originals. His addition in the Translation of the famous
letter from Spartacus to Marius, page 165-6, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[9](#fn_8.md) has given rise to numberless questions, how
the—*even d*—was expressed in the German text. A parenthesis follows
(*can this mean death?*). I was obliged to answer that the *even d*—, as
well as the parenthesis, were additions; but at the same time that they
were not additions contrary to the

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

sense of the letter. I could willingly have attributed these deviations
to a difference in the editions of the Original Writings; but a new work
must be supposed, as well as new letters, to justify the quotations, and
all Germany must have noticed such changes. In the first place, the
Court of Bavaria would have protested against such a supposition; as the
Original Writings could not have coincided with an edition so
dissimilar; next, the Illuminees who have not spoken in such clear
language, though clear enough in their letters; in fine, the authors who
have combated Illuminism, and whose quotations all exactly agree with
the Edition of Munich. The Pages may change in different Editions; but
whole Letters and Discourses cannot, especially when the public may, as
we have seen above, have access to the Originals.

As for myself, whose name cannot be expected to have such authority as
Mr. Robison's, I have taken all the precautions of which I felt myself
to stand in need. <span id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) I never make a
quotation but with the Original before me; and when I translate any
passage which may stagger the reader, I subjoin the original, that each
may explain and verify the text. I follow the same line of conduct when
I compare the different testimonies. I never mention a single law in the
code without having the original before me, or the practice of it to
vouch for my assertion. Hence it will be perceived, that we are not to
be put in competition with each other; Mr. Robison taking a general view
while I have attempted to descend into particulars: as to the substance
we agree. I heartily congratulate him on his zeal in combating the
monster; and though we do not agree in certain particularities, we both
evince the monstrous nature of the Sect, and the certainty of its
horrible Conspiracies.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[398:1](mhj301.htm#fr_0.md) The Translator thinks it
proper to inform the Reader, that, considering how much the abuse of
terms, such as of *Philosophy*, *Reason*, &c. &c. has contributed to
diffuse the new-fangled doctrines, he has adopted in the present volume
(which may be said to be the first methodical work published on the
subject of which it treats) the words *Illumine*, *Illuminize*, and
*Illuminization*, though *Illuminate* and *Illumination* might perhaps
be more correct expressions. Every reader will feel, that the
illumination of the world, and to illuminate mankind, are objects worthy
of the true philosopher. But may the man be ever accurst who shall
attempt to *illuminize* his countrymen, or aim at the *illuminization*
of the world! T.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[399:10](mhj301.htm#fr_9.md) I am also afraid that
the difference that exists between the degrees of Rosicrucian, of which
Mr. Robison is in possession, and those which I have mentioned, may give
rise to argument. I answer, 1st. That I am acquainted with three degrees
of Rosicrucians, very different in themselves; 2dly. That the
Cathechisms, Questions, and Rituals for the same degree greatly differ
in different countries: 3dly. That I have followed the works of *Mr.
L’Abbe Le Franc*, which Mr. Robison has quoted: 4thly. That Mr. Robison
allows the degree of *Knights of the Sun* as described by me to be
similar to that which he is in possession of. Since the publication of
my Second Volume, I have received an account of the same degree which
coincides with what I had said, and this degree is a sufficient ground
for all that Mr. Robison or myself have asserted on the attack carried
on by Masonry against Religion and Governments.
