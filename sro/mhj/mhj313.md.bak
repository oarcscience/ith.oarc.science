### CHAP. XII.

#### Ninth Part of the Code of the Illuminees.—Class of Grand Mysteries; the Mage or the Philosopher, and the Man King.

<span class="smallcaps">By</span> the great importance which the Sect
places in the last mysteries of Illuminism, and the many precautions it
has taken to conceal them from the public view, I am compelled to begin
this chapter with candidly declaring, that every attempt to discover the
original text of this part of the Code has been fruitless. Such an
avowal, however, should not disconcert the reader. Though the real text
may be wanting, we have abundant matter to supply its place. We have
Weishaupt's familiar correspondence; we are in possession of the letters
of many of the adepts who enthusiastically admired them; and the avowals
are still extant of other adepts, who indignantly beheld such
abominations. Our judgement will be guided by laws laid down by
Weishaupt himself; and the famous apology of this monstrous legislator
will teach us how to appreciate them. Such materials are more than
sufficient to supply the deficiency of the literal text. It is true,
that the crafty cant and affected enthusiasm of the Hierophant will be
wanting; but the substance of his declamation, the extent and
monstrosity of his ultimate plots will lose nothing of their evidence.
Let us begin then by attending to their author, and from him receive our
first impressions.

Weishaupt, when writing to *Zwack*, his *incomparable* man, and speaking
of the degree of *Epopt*, wherein impiety and rebellion seem to have
strained every nerve to disseminate their venemous principles against
church and state, says, "One might be tempted to think that this degree
was the last and the most sublime: I have, nevertheless, <span
class="smallcaps">three more</span> *of infinitely greater importance,
which I reserve for our Grand Mysteries*. But these I keep at home, and
only show them to the Areopagites, or to a few other brethren the most
distinguished for their merit and their services.—Were you here, I would
admit you to my degree, for you are worthy of it—But I never suffer it
to go out of my hands. *It is of too serious an import*; it is the key
of the ancient and modern, the religious and political history of the
universe."

"That I may keep our provinces in due subordination, I will take care to
have only three copies of this degree in all Germany; that is to say,
one in each Inspection." He soon after writes again to the same adept:
"I have

<span id="page_503">p. 503</span>

composed four more degrees above that of *Regent*; and with respect to
these four, even the lowest of them, our degree of Priest will be but
child's play"—*Wogegen den schlechesten der priester grad kinder spiel
seyn soll*. <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169.md)

Before we draw any conclusion toward forming our judgment, let me recall
to the mind of the reader those letters wherein Weishaupt declares, that
every degree shall be an apprenticeship for the next, *a sort of
Noviciate for the higher degrees*. That these degrees were always to be
*in crescendo*; in fine, that in the last class of the mysteries a
perfect statement of the maxims and polity of Illuminism was to be
given. *Und am ende folgt die totale einsicht in die politic and maximen
des ordens*. <span id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_170.md) After such letters,
the text of these mysteries is scarcely necessary. I know that these
degrees were reduced to two for the last class of the mysteries; I know,
from the agreement made by the founder and his intimate adepts, that the
first was the *Mage*, or [*Philosopher*](errata.htm#47.md); the other, the
*Man King*. <span id="fr_171"></span>[3](#fn_171.md) I will start from
these data, and shall not hesitate to say, that this monster of impiety
and of wickedness imposes on himself when he speaks of *degrees
infinitely more important* for the higher mysteries, or when he pretends
that those of *Epopt* and *Regent* are but *puerile* in comparison with
those which he reserves for his intimate adepts. His execrable pride may
flatter him with surpassing even the devils themselves, in his wicked
inventions for sending forth the pestiferous blast; but their combined
efforts could not suggest more hideous plots than those in which
Weishaupt glories when calling them his *lesser mysteries*.—What! the
vow of annihilating every idea of religion, even to the very name of a
God; the plan for overthrowing every government, even to the
obliteration of every vestige of laws, authority, or civil society; the
wish of destroying our arts and sciences, our towns, and even villages,
that they may realize their systems of Equality and Liberty; the desire
of exterminating the greater part of human nature, to work the triumph
of their vagabond clans, over the remaining part of mankind. These vows
and wishes, these plots and plans, have already appeared in the lesser
mysteries, and his adepts must have been as stupid as he wishes them to
be impious and wicked, if they have not seen through the web that veils
from their sight the baleful abyss. And, after all, it is not the
*object* or the *substance* of their plots which is thus slightly
veiled; the *terms* alone are concealed. There only remains to say, that
all religion shall be destroyed for the adoption of Atheism; every
constitution, whether Monarchical or Republican, shall be overthrown in
favour of absolute Independence; property shall be annihilated; science
and arts shall be suppressed; towns, houses, and fixed habitations,
reduced to ashes, for the reestablishment of the roaming and savage
life, which the hypocrite, in his cant, calls *the patriarchal life*.
Such are the terms; and the scroll of this hideous pantomime needed only
to be unrolled, to tell the names of those who were to appear on the
gloomy stage of the last mysteries. The adept had long since inhaled the
deleterious air with which Weishaupt had spared no pains to surround
him; and could he nauseate this, or turn away from these disastrous
machinations, the gates of the mysterious pit were shut against him. At
such a sight nature shudders—The reader will cry out, None but monsters
could

<span id="page_504">p. 504</span>

have conceived or abetted such plots. Be it so; I will not contradict
him; I only wish to name these monsters.—Behold Weishaupt and his
profound adepts! The reader will find the proofs of this exclamation in
their own writings.

Weishaupt, who divided his mysteries into two classes, also distributed
his last secrets under two heads. First, Religion; which was the object
of the *Mages*: The other comprehended what he called his Polity; and he
reserved it for the *Man King*. Let us separately investigate each of
these degrees, commencing with that principle which he himself lays
down, and from which he never deviates, that each degree shall be a
preparatory concatenation of principles and doctrines, the ultimate
tendency of which was to form the object of the last mysteries. Such a
principle is more than sufficient to demonstrate that the secret to be
imparted to his *Mages* can be no other than the most absolute Atheism,
and the total subversion of every Religion. The adept, however, has
already imbibed such horrid principles; and the secret consists in
telling him, in plain terms, that it was toward that point the Sect had
long since been leading him, and that in future all his thoughts, words,
and actions, must tend to second the views of the Sect in their
monstrous undertaking; that in the preceding degrees the name of
*Religion* had only been preserved the better to destroy the thing; but
that in future the very name would only be the expression of chimeras,
of superstition, of fanaticism, supported by despotism and ambition, as
a tool for enslaving mankind.

This explication is no vain fancy of mine. See Weishaupt confidentially
writing to his intimate and incomparable *Cato*-Zwack:

"I firmly believe, that the secret doctrine of Christ had no other
object in view than the re-establishment of Jewish Liberty, which is the
explanation I give of it. I even believe, that Freemasonry is nothing
but a Christianity of this sort; at least, my explanation of their
Hieroglyphics perfectly coincides with such an explanation. In this
sense, nobody could blush at being a Christian; *for I preserve the
name, and substitute reason,—denn ich lasse den namen, and substituiere
ihm die vernunft*."—He continues: "It is no trivial matter to have
discovered a new Religion and a new Polity in these tenebrous
[Hieroglyphics](errata.htm#48.md);" and he goes on to say, "One might be
induced to think that this was my highest degree; I have, nevertheless,
three of infinitely more importance, for our grand mysteries." <span
id="fr_172"></span>[4](#fn_172.md) Here then is Weishaupt's decision on the
degree of *Epopt* or *Illuminized Priest*.—It is Christianity preserving
*the name of Religion*, with the Gospel converted into a Code by means
of which Christ taught the Jacobinical *Equality* and *Liberty*. <span
id="fr_173"></span>[5](#fn_173.md) Here Weishaupt is
[transcendent](errata.htm#49.md) in his wickedness and his impiety; it is
under the sacred name of Religion that he teaches his disorganizing
principles of *Equality* and *Liberty*. After having led his Epopts to
the pinnacle of Impiety, to what farther lengths can he possibly lead
his *Mage*?—He may erase the *names* of *Religion* and *God*? And this
he will do in his higher mysteries; for who can expect to find them when
he says, "You know that the *Unity of God* was one of the secrets
revealed in the mysteries of Eleusis; *as for that, there is no fear of
any such thing being found in mine*." <span
id="fr_174"></span>[6](#fn_174.md)

<span id="page_505">p. 505</span>

After this, can the name of God be expected ever to be found in the
mysteries of the *Illuminized Mage* for any other purpose than to be
blasphemed? We see this same Weishaupt reserving all the Atheistical
productions for this degree; he writes again to his incomparable man:
"With our beginners let us act prudently with respect to books on
Religion and Polity. *In my plan, I reserve them for the grand
mysteries*. At first we must put only books of history or of metaphysics
into their hands. Let Morality be our pursuit. *Robinet*, *Mirabeau*
(that is to say, the System of Nature written by Diderot, though
attributed to Mirabeau), *the Social System*, *Natural Polity*, *the
Philosophy of Nature*, and such works, are reserved for my higher
degrees.—At present they must not even be mentioned to our adepts, and
particularly *Helvetius on Man*." <span id="fr_175"></span>[7](#fn_175.md)
The reader here sees a list of the most Anti-religious and the most
Atheistical works, <span id="fr_176"></span>[8](#fn_176.md) and that they
are reserved for these last mysteries. As a preparation for them
(*horribile dictu!*) the very idea of a God must be eradicated from the
mind of the adept. Can we doubt this, when we see Weishaupt thus write:
"Do put Brother *Numenius* in correspondence with me; I must try to cure
him of his Theosophical ideas, and properly prepare him for our
views.—*Ich will ihn suchen von der Theosophie zu curieren, and zu
unseren absichten zu bestimmen*." <span id="fr_177"></span>[9](#fn_177.md)
The Theosopher, or the man still believing in a God, is not fit for
these mysteries; Religion then must, of course, be
[irreconcilable](errata.htm#50.md) with them. Were the consequences less
evident, and should we reject these secret correspondences, or condemn
the last oracles of the Hierophant to remain *within the hundred bolts*
which keeps them hidden from the adepts; I say, even then, to ascertain
what the tenets of the Sect are as to any worship or religion, we should
not be necessitated to enter that den of mysteries. Though Weishaupt had
not mentioned Religion in his intimate correspondence, the Atheistical
Conspiracy of his mysteries would be evident, and why seek private
documents when he has given us irrefragable proofs of guilt in that
which he publishes as his apology?

Two years after his flight, Weishaupt most daringly asserts, that the
Systems of his Illuminism (as published by the civil powers) are but a
mere sketch, a plan as yet too ill-digested for the public to form any
judgment either on him or his adepts, from the Original Writings or his
Confidential Correspondence. He publishes a new Code, and calls it *The
corrected System of Illuminism, with its Degrees and Constitutions, by
Adam Weishaupt, Counsellor to the Duke of Saxe Gotha*. Here at least we
have a right to judge him and his mysteries, both in his apology and his
corrected degrees. But the reader will now view him in a new light. He
is not only the conspiring infidel, but the insolent Sophister,
insulting the Public with all the haughtiness of the most daring
Atheist, shrugging his shoulders in disdain at the rest of mankind, and
with impertinent pity saying to us all, as he did of the adepts whom he
had duped, *poor creatures! what could one not make you believe!*

I deign to cast my eyes on this apology, or the Illuminism corrected. He
begins by telling us, that to have supposed him capable of composing so
extensive a work in two years *was doing him the honour of supposing him
gifted* 

<span id="page_506">p. 506</span>

*with most extraordinary talents*; and it is in such terms that the
Sophister informs the public that he takes them for great fools. Let the
contempt with which he treats his readers be retorted upon himself; let
neither him nor his accomplices expect to descend to posterity with any
other distinction than as the phenomena of vice and infamy. Are we to
crouch in token of homage before the men who insolently scoff at their
God and at the public weal? I know not whether Weishaupt needed
extraordinary talents or not, though I grant him all the art and cunning
of the Sophister; but most certainly he must have presumed much on the
force of impudence when he flattered himself that the public would
inevitably find that his corrected Code contained no principles but such
as would elevate the mind and tend to form great men. <span
id="fr_178"></span>[10](#fn_178.md) What I find is, that it is nothing more
than a medley of all the arts of his original Code for the education or
rather depravation of his Adepts. Did I wish to form a stupid atheist,
this would be the work I should chuse to put into his hands. As early as
the third degree, in place of a God reigning as freely as he does
powerfully over this universe, I find the universe transformed into a
vast machine, in which every thing is held together or put in motion by
I know not what fatality, decorated sometimes by the appellation of God,
at other of nature. Again: did I wish to decorate with the name of
providence a destiny *which cannot annihilate a single atom without
depriving the stars of their support and involving the whole universe in
ruin*, this would be the work I should recommend: I would give it to the
narrow-minded adept, who, in a world where every thing is said to be
necessary, should still pretend to talk of virtue or vices, or who could
comfort himself for all the harm which the wicked could do him, by
learning that the wicked like the virtuous man only followed the course
which nature had traced for him; and that they would both arrive at the
same point as himself In fine, I would put it into the hands of the
imbecile, who would call *the art of making merry the art of being
always happy* (*ars semper gaudendi*); the art of persuading oneself
that one's misfortunes are incurable, or that they are all
necessary. <span id="fr_179"></span>[11](#fn_179.md) But what reader will
brook the impudence of that conspiring infidel, who, dedicating his
mysteries as an apology to the whole world and all mankind—*der welt and
den menschlichen geschlecht*—and pretending to prove that his original
mysteries are not a conspiracy against Religion, puts a discourse in the
mouth of his new Hierophants, whose very title characterizes the most
determined one both against God and Religion; he calls it, *An
Instruction for the adepts who are inclined to the fancy of believing in
or of adoring a God!* I know it may be also translated, *An instruction
for the Brethren inclining toward* [*Theosophical*](errata.htm#51.md) *or
Religious enthusiasm*. <span id="fr_180"></span>[12](#fn_180.md) But if
both these translations be not [synonymous](errata.htm#52.md) in the
language of the Sophisters, let the reader judge, from the exordium of
the discourse, which is the most accurate.

"He who wishes to labour for the happiness of mankind, to add to the
content and rest of the human species, to decrease their dissatisfaction
(these are literally the words of our Antitheosophical Sophister), must
scrutinize and weaken *those principles* which trouble their rest,
contentment, and happiness. Of this species are all those systems which
are hostile to the ennobling and

<span id="page_507">p. 507</span>

perfecting of human nature; which unnecessarily multiply evil in the
world, or represent it as greater than it really is: all those systems
which depreciate the merit and the dignity of man, which diminish his
confidence in his own natural powers, and thereby render him lazy,
pusillanimous, mean, and cringing: all those also which beget
enthusiasm, which bring human reason into discredit, and thus open a
free course for imposture: *All the Theosophical and Mystical Systems;
all those which have a direct or indirect tendency to such Systems; in
short, all the principles derived from Theosophy, which, concealed in
our hearts, often finish by leading men back to it, belong to this
class*."

In the course of his instructions, the reader is not to expect that
Weishaupt will make any exception in favour of the revealed Religion,
not even a hint at such an exception is to be seen.—The Religion of
Christ is represented as a medley of the reveries of Pythagoras, of
Plato, and of Judaism. It is in vain for the Israelites to believe in
the Unity of God, in the coming of a Messiah; it is in vain to assert
that such was the faith of their forefathers, of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, long before they entered Egypt or Babylon; it is in vain to
prove, that the adoration of the golden Calf, or of the god Apis, was
punished by the Almighty as a prevarication of their Religion: Nothing
will serve the Sophister; he will declare in his *corrected Code*, that
the Religion of the Jews was but a modification of the reveries of the
Egyptians, of Zoroaster, or of the Babylonians. To *correct* his adepts,
he teaches them to cast aside the Creation as a chimera unknown to
antiquity, and to reduce all Religion to two Systems—The one, that of
matter co-eternal with God, a part of God, proceeding from God, cast
forth and separated from God, in order to become the world—The other,
matter co-eternal with God, without being God, but worked by God, for
the formation of the universe. On these foundations he builds a general
history of all Religions, and makes all appear equally absurd. The
reader might be tempted to think that these lessons had been composed
before the hegira or rather proscription of the author of Illuminism.
They may have been compiled for one of those discourses which he
declares to be of more importance than that of the Hierophant in the
degree of Epopt.—He precisely follows the course which Knigge represents
as the grand object of the last mysteries. He makes, after his fashion,
a general compilation of all the schools of Philosophism and of its
Systems; and hence he deduces Christianity and all Religions. The result
of the whole is, that all Religions are founded on imposture and
chimera, all end in rendering man *cowardly*, *lazy*, *cringing*, and
*superstitious*; all degrade him, and trouble his repose. <span
id="fr_181"></span>[13](#fn_181.md) And it is thus that this Sophister,
under pretence of his justification, daringly acts that part in public
which before he had only ventured to act under the cover of his
mysteries. He sallies forth from his baleful abyss but to proclaim to
the world what heretofore he had only hinted to his adepts in
private,—that the time was at length come for the overthrow of every
Altar, and the annihilation of every Religion.

Are any further proofs necessary to demonstrate the object of the grand
mysteries? The testimony of Knigge cannot be objected to, nor can Knigge
pretend or wish to mislead Zwack when confidentially corresponding with

<span id="page_508">p. 508</span>

him. Both had signed the agreement of the Areopagites respecting the
compilation of the degrees of Illuminism. <span
id="fr_182"></span>[14](#fn_182.md) Let us then attend to these two
adepts—Philo-Knigge has been exhibiting all that he has done, according
to Weishaupt's instructions, in the degree of *Epopt*, to demonstrate
that Christ had no other view than the establishment of natural
Religion, or, in the language of Illuminism, the rights of Equality and
Liberty. Knigge then continues: "After having thus shown to our people
that we are the real Christians, we have only a *word to add* against
Priests and Princes. I have made use of such precaution in the degrees
of Epopt and of Regent, that I should not be afraid of conferring them
on Kings or Popes, provided they had undergone the proper previous
trials. In our last mysteries we have to acknowledge this *pious fraud*;
to prove, upon the testimony of authors, the origin of all the religious
impostures, and to expose the whole with their connections and
dependencies." <span id="fr_183"></span>[15](#fn_183.md)

Such, reader, is *that word to add*, which was to be spoken only in the
last mysteries of Illuminism! That *word* against Priests and the
Ministers of every worship! That *word* on the *pious fraud*, or rather
labyrinth of impiety, in which the Sect had involved the Candidate on
his first entrance into the Order, only to extricate him when he was
judged worthy of their last mysteries! The adept must certainly be of
weak intellects, and his credulity must border on stupidity, if he has
not in the degree of Epopt, and long before, observed whither they were
leading him. But should he really be still in the dark, or could he view
with indignation the artifices which had been used with him; if all
reflection have not abandoned him; what will not the very term of *pious
fraud* discover to him? Will it not recall to his mind, "that on the
first invitations of the Sect, to entice him into their Order, they
began by telling him, that nothing contrary to Religion would ever enter
the projects of the Order? Does he not remember, that this declaration
was repeated on his admission into the noviciate, and reiterated when he
was received into the minerval academy? Has he forgotten how strongly
the sect enforced the study of morality and of virtue in the first
degrees, and how carefully it isolated both from religion? When pouring
forth its encomium on religion, did not the Sect insinuate, that true
Religion widely differed from those mysteries and worship which had
degenerated in the hands of the priesthood? Does he remember with what
art and affected respect it spoke of Christ and his Gospel in the
degrees of *Major Illuminee*, of *Scotch Knight*, and of *Epopt*; how
the Gospel was insensibly metamorphosed into illuminized reason, its
morality into that of Nature; and from a moral, reasonable, and natural
religion, how a religion and a morality of the rights of man, of
*Equality* and *Liberty*, were deduced? Does he reflect how all the
different parts of this system and opinions of the Sect were insinuated
to him, how naturally they occurred and appeared to have been fostered
in his own breast? Could not the Sect say to him, ’tis true, we put you
on the way, but you were much more earnest in solving our questions than
we in answering yours. When, for example, we asked whether the religions
which nations had adopted fulfilled the objects for which they were

<span id="page_509">p. 509</span>

intended; whether the pure and simple religion of Christ was really that
which different Sects professed at this present day, we knew what to
believe, but we wished to know how far you had inhaled our principles.
We had a multitude of prejudices to conquer in you, before we could
succeed in persuading you that the pretended Religion of Christ was but
an invention of Priestcraft, imposture, and tyranny. If such be the case
with the much-admired and loudly proclaimed Gospel, what are we to think
of all other religions? Learn, then, that they are all founded on
fiction, all originate in imposition, error, imposture, and chimera.
Such is our secret. All the windings we made; the hypotheses we assumed;
the promises set forth; the panegyric pronounced on Christ and his
secret schools; the fable, of Masonry being for a long time in
possession of his true doctrines, and our Order being at present sole
depositary of his mysteries, can no longer be subjects of surprise. If,
to overturn Christianity and every Religion, we pretended solely to
possess true Christianity, the true Religion, remember that the *end
sanctifies the means*, that the sage *must make use of all those means
for good purposes, which the wicked do for evil*. The means we have
employed to rid you, and which we continue in order to rid mankind of
all Religion, are but a *pious fraud*, which we always meant to reveal
to you when admitted to the degree of *Mage*, or of *Illuminized
Philosopher*!!!"

To these reflections *on the word to be added* in the last mysteries
(sufficiently demonstrated by the ascension of the degrees, by
Weishaupt's apology, by his intimate correspondence, and that of his
most perfect adepts) let us subjoin the avowal of a man little
calculated indeed for a Member of such an abominable tribe, but who has
better than any person known how to tear the mask from their hideous
countenances, and expose their wickedness. I am acquainted with his real
name; I am aware that it would greatly add to the confidence of the
public; but I also know that could Illuminism discover his asylum, it
would follow him to drink his blood, though it were to the southern
pole. He is then entitled to secrecy; till now it has been observed, nor
will I be the first to infringe his right. The Germans have paid him
homage, and, ignorant of his name, they have surnamed him *Biederman*,
or Man of Honour; at least, it is under that denomination that his works
are generally cited. All that I can say in addition to what the public
is already in possession of respecting this gentleman is that nothing
could have induced him to continue so disgusting a course, but a zeal
for the public welfare, and a just opinion, that the only means of
preventing the effects of the conspiracy of the Sect was to make their
machinations public.—Having passed through all the degrees, he was at
length admitted to the last mysteries. He published those of *Epopt or
Priest*, *and of Regent*, under the title of *Last Works of Philo and
Spartacus*. He subjoined the instructions belonging to those degrees,
with *a Critical History of all the Degrees of Illuminism*. Had I no
other guarantee of the veracity of his assertions, than their glaring
coincidence with the original writings, which is beyond all doubt with
the attentive investigator, I should not hesitate in declaring him to be
the man that has given the truest account, and was best

<span id="page_510">p. 510</span>

acquainted with the Sect. The certificate at the head of the degree of
*Epopt and Regent*, for a more perfect knowledge of which the public is
indebted to him, I look upon as undoubtedly genuine. I know a person who
has seen and read this certificate in the original, in *Philo*-Knigge's
own hand-writing, and who has seen the seal of the Order attached to
this certificate. I thus particularize because the public is entitled,
in discussions of this importance, to know how far I have extended my
researches, and how far the grounds I work upon deserve to be
credited.—The passage I am about to quote is looked upon as fundamental
by all German authors; it is from Biederman, and occurs near the end of
his *Critical History*:

"With respect to the two degrees of *Mage* and of *Man King*, there is
no reception, that is to say, there are no ceremonies of initiation.
Even the Elect are not permitted to transcribe these degrees, they only
hear them read; and that is the reason why I do not publish them with
this work."

"The first is that of *Mage*, also called Philosopher. It contains the
fundamental principles of Spinosism. Here every thing is *material*; God
and the world are but one and the same thing; all religions are
*inconsistent*, chimerical, and the invention of ambitious men." <span
id="fr_184"></span>[16](#fn_184.md)

"Divers principles," continues the author, "thrown out in the preceding
degrees might in some measure point out the object the Sect had in
view." Certainly nothing could be better grounded than such a
surmise—Nature, so often united with God, represented active like God,
following with the same immensity of power, the same wisdom as God, the
course which it had traced; a hundred such expressions in the mouth of
the Hierophant evidently indicated, that the God of Weishaupt was that
of Spinosa or Lucretius, no other than matter and the universe; in fine,
the God of Atheism. Let the Sieur D’Alembert assert, that nothing can be
more opposite to Atheism than Spinosism; <span
id="fr_185"></span>[17](#fn_185.md) or let Spinosa say, that, so far from
being an Atheist, he converts every thing into God; will such an excuse
raise pity or indignation in the reader? To deny that there is any other
God than the world, is evidently denying the only being that can justly
be called God. It is laughing at men, to wish to make them believe, that
the person is preserved because they do not dare destroy the name, at
the very time that the name of God is only used as an agent for the
[annihilation](errata.htm#53.md) of every idea of a Deity.

I think I have sufficiently demonstrated, that the first object of these
grand mysteries of Illuminism, prepared with so much art and cunning, is
no other than to plunge the adepts into a monstrous Atheism, to persuade
all nations that religion is but an invention of ambitious impostors,
and that to deliver nations from this despotism of imposture, and
recover the famous rights of man, Equality and Liberty, they must begin
by annihilating every religion, every worship, every altar, and cease to
believe in a God.

Let us continue the declaration of *Biederman*, and the object of the
last part of the mysteries (or the degree of the Man king) will be
equally clear.

"The second degree of the grand mysteries," he says, "called the *Man
King*, teaches that every inhabitant of the country or town, every
father of a

<span id="page_511">p. 511</span>

family, is sovereign, as men formerly were in the times of the
patriarchal life, to which mankind is once more to be carried back;
that, in consequence, all authority and all magistracy must be
destroyed.—I have read these two degrees, and have passed through all
those of the Order." <span id="fr_186"></span>[18](#fn_186.md)

How well authenticated soever this testimony may be, still one is loth
to think that there could have existed men at once so absurd and so
wicked as to take such exquisite pains to educate their adepts merely to
address them in the end to the following purpose: "All that we have done
for you hitherto was only to prepare you to co-operate with us in the
annihilation of all Magistracy, all Governments, all Laws, and all Civil
Society; of every Republic and even Democracy, as well as of every
Aristocracy or Monarchy It all tended to infuse into you and make you
insensibly imbibe that which we plainly tell you at present—All men are
equal and free, this is their imprescriptible right; but it is not only
under the dominion of Kings that you are deprived of the exercise of
these rights. They are annulled wherever man recognises any other law
than his own will. We have frequently spoken of Despotism and of
Tyranny; but they are not confined to an Aristocracy or a Monarchy:
Despotism and Tyranny as essentially reside in the Democratic
sovereignty of the people, or in the legislative people, as in the
legislative King. What right has that people to subject me and the
minority to the decrees of its majority? Are such the rights of nature?
Did the sovereign or legislative people exist any more than Kings or
Aristocratic Legislators at that period when man enjoyed his natural
Equality and Liberty?—Here then are our Mysteries—All that we have said
to you of Tyrants and Despots, was only designed insensibly to lead you
to what we had to impart concerning the despotism and tyranny of the
people themselves. Democratic governments are not more consonant with
nature than any others. If you ask, How it will be possible for men
assembled in towns to live in future without laws, magistrates, or
constituted authorities,—the answer is clear, Desert your towns and
villages, and fire your houses. Did men build houses, villages, or towns
in the days of the Patriarchs? They were all equal and free; the earth
belonged to them all, each had an equal right, and lived where he chose.
Their country was the world, and they were not confined to England or
Spain, to France or Germany; their country was the whole earth, and not
a Monarchy or petty Republic in some corner of it. Be equal and free,
and you will be cosmopolites or citizens of the world. Could you but
appreciate Equality and Liberty as you ought, you would view with
indifference Rome, Vienna, Paris, London, or Constantinople in flames,
or any of those towns, boroughs, or villages which you call your
country. Friend and Brother, such is the grand secret which we reserved
for our Mysteries!!!"

It is painful indeed to believe, that stupidity, pride, and wickedness,
should have thus combined to prepare adepts, who, attending Weishaupt's
Mysteries, could mistake them for the Oracles of true wisdom and
[transcendent](errata.htm#54.md) Philosophy. How many Jacobins and those
pretended patriots of Democracy blush, when they learn the real object
of the Sect which directs their

<span id="page_512">p. 512</span>

actions; when they learn that they have only been the tools of a Sect
whose ultimate object is to overturn even their Democratic
Constitutions!—But in attributing such language to the Hierophant of the
last Mysteries, what more have I said than the Illuminizing Legislator
has already declared? What other can be the meaning of his *Patriarchal*
or of his *Nomade* or *roaming life*, of those vagabond clans, or of man
still in the savage state? <span id="fr_187"></span>[19](#fn_187.md) What
Democracy even could consist with the Patriarchal life or the vagabond
clan? Where is the necessity for attending the last Mysteries, to learn
from the Sect itself the extent of their conspiracies? We have seen
Weishaupt cursing that day as one of the most disastrous for mankind,
when, uniting themselves in civil society, they instituted Laws and
Governments, and first formed *nations and people*. We have seen him
depreciate nations and the national spirit as the grand source of
Egoism; call down vengeance on the laws and the rights of nations as
incompatible with the *laws and rights of nature*. What else can the
Sect mean by saying, that *nations shall disappear from the face of the
earth*, but the annihilation of all civil or national society? Why those
blasphemies against the *love of one's country*, if not to persuade the
adepts to [acknowledge](errata.htm#55.md) none?—Have we not heard the
Hierophant teaching that true morality consisted *in the art of casting
Princes and Governors aside and of governing oneself*, that the *real
original sin* in mankind was their uniting under the laws of civil
society; that their *redemption* could be accomplished only by the
abolition of this civil state? And when his frantic hatred against all
government exalts his imagination, does he not enthusiastically exclaim,
*Let the laughers laugh, the scoffers scoff; still the day will come,
when Princes and Nations shall disappear from the face of the earth*; a
time *when each man shall recognize no other law but that of his
reason*? Nor does he hesitate to say, that *this shall be the grand work
of* <span class="smallcaps">Secret Societies</span>. They are to
reinstate man in his rights of Equality and Liberty, in an independence
of every law but that of his reason. Such he formally declares to be one
of the grand mysteries of his Illuminism; <span
id="fr_188"></span>[20](#fn_188.md) and can the reader quietly sit down and
think that all these declarations of the author of Illuminism, who must
be superior to his Mysteries, have not the absolute ruin of every law,
government, and civil society, in view? Has he not seen the Sect
anticipating those objections which evidence might have suggested
against systems still more wicked than stupid; forewarning the adepts,
that independence once more restored among men, it was not to meet the
same fate it formerly had, and was never to be lost again;—teaching that
mankind, having acquired wisdom by its disasters, will resemble a man
corrected of his errors by long experience, and who carefully avoids
those faults which were the cause of his past misfortunes? Has not the
reader heard him proclaim to his elect, that this independence once
recovered, the empire of the laws and all civil society would cease; and
will he still continue to disbelieve the existence of the most
deliberate and most dangerous Conspiracy that ever was formed
[against](errata.htm#56.md) society!

Should any of my readers be weak enough to be seduced by the imaginary
sweets of a patriarchal life, so artfully promised by Weishaupt, let

<span id="page_513">p. 513</span>

them receive the explanation of that life from these pretended Apostles
of Nature.

At my outset I did not only declare, that the destruction of civil
society was the object of their views; I did not confine myself to
saying, that should Jacobinism triumph every Religion and every
Government would be overthrown; but I added, *that to whatever rank in
society you may belong, your riches and your fields, your houses and
your cottages, even your very wives and children would be torn from
you*. <span id="fr_189"></span>[21](#fn_189.md) I also rejected fanaticism
and enthusiasm in my own and my reader's name. I have said it, and
adopting the simplest construction, do not proofs of the most extensive
plots croud upon us from the very lessons of the Sect? Can common sense,
nay can the strongest prejudice, refuse to admit such powerful evidence?

Let him who may wish to preserve his field, his house, or the smallest
part of his property, under this patriarchal life, go back to the
*lesser Mysteries*; there let him hear the Hierophant teaching the
adept, that it would have been happy for man, "Had he know how to
preserve himself in the primitive state in which nature had placed
him!—But soon the unhappy germ developed itself in his heart, and rest
and happiness disappeared. As families multiplied, the necessary means
of subsistence began to fail. *The Nomade or roaming life ceased;
Property began; Men chose fixed habitations; Agriculture brought them
together*." What were in the eyes of the Sect the dreadful consequences
of this deviation from the Nomade or Patriarchal life?—Why the
Hierophant hastens to tell us, *Liberty was ruined in its foundations,
and Equality disappeared*. This *Patriarchal or Nomade* life is then no
other than that which preceded *property*, the building of *fixed
habitations*, of houses, cottages, or *the cultivation of your fields*.
It was this beginning of property therefore, the building of
habitations, the cultivation of lands, which struck the first mortal
blow at Equality and Liberty. Should any one wish to return to the
*Patriarchal* or *Nomade* life with such wretches as these apostles of
Equality and Liberty, let him begin by renouncing his property; let him
abandon his house and his field; let him, in unison with the Sect,
declare, that the first blasphemy which was uttered against *Equality*
and *Liberty* was by the man who first said *my* field, *my* house, *my*
property.

It must be voluntary blindness, indeed, in the man who will not see the
hatred conceived and the Conspiracies entered into by the Sect against
titles or pretensions to, nay against the very existence of property. It
will acknowledge none, nor can it in any shape be compatible with their
explanations of Equality and Liberty, or with that primitive state of
nature which no more entitles you or me to the possession of this gold
or silver, or that field, than it does a third person.

Here it is not simply the question of establishing the *Agrarian Laws*,
where lands, riches, and other properties are to be equally distributed
among all; it is not simply to abolish the distinction of *rich* and
*poor*; no, every property is to be destroyed, that of the poor like
that of the rich. The first man who was weary of the *Nomade*, roaming,
vagabond, and savage life, built a cot and not a palace. The first who
furrowed the earth was in quest of bread and not of

<span id="page_514">p. 514</span>

gold; but he nevertheless, according to the principles of the Sect, was
the man who struck the first deadly blow at Equality and Liberty. Poor
or rich man then, according to the doctrine of the Sect, the field you
have recovered from the waste, and that you have cultivated, belongs to
me equally as to you, or else to nobody; I, though idle, and inactive,
am entitled to the fruit of your labours; I have a right to share those
fruits which you have raised on the land which I left uncultured. Does
not *Equality* disappear, whether it be a poor or rich man who shall
pretend to be entitled to or say this field is mind, I have that
property? If the poor man has a title to his property, has not the rich
man also one? Treasures and palaces are no more property than the cot or
cottage. Here an Illuminee spies want, there abundance; Equality and
Liberty are every where banished; Despotism or Slavery is universal.
Nevertheless, Equality and Liberty in his eyes are the rights of Nature,
and he beholds them mortally wounded on the first appearance of
property, when man became stationary. Poor or rich, you all imbrued your
hands in this foul assassination of Equality and Liberty when you
pretended to property; from that instant you are both involved in the
curse pronounced in the mysteries; you are both objects of the
Conspiracies of the Sect from the first instant that you dared assert
your right to your habitations whether cots or palaces, to your
properties whether fields or domains. But these cannot be the whole of
the secrets; they are only those of the lesser mysteries. Weishaupt has
revealed them to his Epopts; he reserves the grander secrets for his
*Mage* and *Man-King*; then let any man rich or poor harbour, if he can,
a hope of seeing the Sect respect his property. Or rather, let him
behold the Sect at present pillaging the rich in favour of the poor. The
last mysteries or ultimate conspiracy will take place; and then the poor
man will learn, that if Illuminism begins by pillaging the rich, it is
only to teach him that he is no better entitled to his property than the
rich man was, and that the time is near when he will also be pillaged
and fall a victim to the curse which has been pronounced against every
proprietor.

The progress of this Sophism is worthy of remark. If we judge by its
present growth, what a gigantic form will it assume for posterity! The
Genevese Sophister of Equality and Liberty, anticipating the modern
*Spartacus*, had already dogmatically asserted, "That the man who,
having enclosed a piece of ground, first took upon himself to say *this
is mine*, and found beings *simple enough to believe him*, was the true
founder of civil society." He then continues:—"What crimes, what wars,
what murders, what miseries, what horrors would that man have spared
mankind, who, tearing down the fences or filling up the ditches of this
new enclosure, had called out to his equals, beware of hearkening to
this impostor, you are ruined if ever you forget that *the fruits belong
to all, though the land belongs to none*." <span
id="fr_190"></span>[22](#fn_190.md) How many crimes and spoliations would
Rousseau have spared the French Revolution, if, contemning so disastrous
a paradox, he had said with more judgement and veracity, "The first man
who enclosed a piece of land and took upon himself to say, *this belongs
to nobody*, I will cultivate it, and from sterile it shall become
fertile; I will follow the course which nature shall point out to me, to
raise sustenance for

<span id="page_515">p. 515</span>

me, my wife and children, and this *land will become my property*. The
God of nature, who as yet has given it to nobody, offers and will give
it to him who shall first cultivate it in reward for his labour.—The
first man who held such language, seconding the views of nature, and
meeting with beings wise enough to imitate him, was *the true benefactor
of mankind*. He taught his children and his equals, that they were not
made to dispute the wild fruits of the earth one with another, nor with
the savage beasts of the forest; no, he taught them, that there existed
social and domestic virtues far preferable to the roaming and often
ferocious life of the *Nomades*. His posterity was blessed, his
generations were multiplied. If it was not in his power to avert all the
evils, he at least destroyed the first of them, that sterility which
stinted the very growth of life and drove the scanty population of the
earth into the forests like wild beasts, and too often assimilated them
to the lion or the tyger, to whom they frequently fell a prey.

Had the Sophister of Geneva held this language, he would not have
exposed himself to the ignominy of being the precursor of Weishaupt.—But
human imbecility has lavished its praises on this paradox, and have
decorated it with the name of Philosophy! The Bavarian Sophister adopts
the doctrine of Rousseau, and the delirium of pride has only refined on
the phrenzy of wickedness. That which in the mouth of the master had
been but a paradox in support of the wildest independence, becomes in
the scholar (without divesting itself of its folly) the blackest of
conspiracies.

It is now too late to say, that those were the wild chimeras of the
Sophisters; at present we are compelled to say, such are the plots
contriving against all and each one's property, plots which have been
awfully illustrated by the spoliation of the Church, of the Nobility, of
the Merchants, and of all rich proprietors Let them be called chimeras
if you are so determined; but remember, that they are the chimeras of
Weishaupt, of the genius of conspiring brigands, of a genius the most
fertile in sophisms and artifice for the execution of those plans
supposed to be chimerical. What Jean [Jacques](errata.htm#57.md) teaches
his Sophisters, the modern Spartacus infuses into his Illuminized
legions, *The fruits belong to all, the land to none*. He farther states
in his dark recesses, When property *began, Equality and Liberty
disappeared*; and it is in the name of this Equality and of this Liberty
that he conspires, that he invites his conspirators to restore mankind
to the Patriarchal or wandering life.

Let not the reader be imposed upon by the term *Patriarchal life*. The
illuminizing Hierophant speaks of Abraham and of the Patriarchs, of the
father *priest and king*, sole *sovereign* over his family. He is not to
expect to see the father surrounded by his children, exercising the
sweetest of all dominions, and each child, docile to the dictates of
nature, revering the orders and anticipating the will of a beloved
father. No; this empire is as imaginary as his priesthood. We have seen
in the degree of *Mage*, that the [illuminized](errata.htm#58.md) Patriarch
can no more pretend to the acknowledgement of a God than can an Atheist.
We must then begin by withdrawing from the Patriarchal life that
interesting sight of the father offering up to heaven the prayers of his
children, sacrificing in their

<span id="page_516">p. 516</span>

name, and exercising in the midst of them the functions of the priest of
the living God. In the next degree of the mysteries all his dominion
over his children is to disappear, as his priesthood has already done.
Nor was I afraid to assert in the beginning of this work, *If Jacobinism
triumphs—your very children shall be torn from you*. I now repeat it;
all this pretended sovereignty of the father is but a conspiracy against
the paternal authority. The proofs are extant in the codes of the Sect.

Here again is Weishaupt deprived of the glory of the invention. Rousseau
and the Encyclopedists had long since told us, that *the authority of
the father ceased with the wants of the son*; this was one of their
principles of rebellion. The man who invented his Illuminism only to
convert it into the common sewer of every antichristian and antisocial
error, could not leave your children in the dark as to these lessons of
independence, though under the sanctuary of the paternal roof; nor with
respect to the pretended right of governing themselves, and of
acknowledging no other law than that of their reason, as soon as they
were strong enough to disobey, or no longer needed your assistance. Tell
the illuminizing Hierophant, that your children belong to you; it will
be useless, for he has already answered, "*The paternal authority ceases
with the wants of the children; the father would wrong his children,
should he pretend to any authority over them after that period*." This
is but a principle laid down in the lesser mysteries. Follow up the
consequences, or rather leave it to the revolution to develope such a
principle. The reader will soon see to what this authority of the father
is reduced. Scarcely can the child lisp the words Equality and Liberty,
or that of Reason, when the commands of his parents become the most
horrid despotism, oppression, and tyranny.—Nor is the Patriarchal
sovereign to expect any more affection than obedience from his subjects
or his children. In imparting the doctrines of Equality and Liberty, the
Hierophant had taught them to blaspheme the *love of one's family* even
still more than *the national love*, *or the love of one's country*, as
being the more direct and immediate principle of the most disastrous
*Egoism*. Let the father then enquire by what bonds his children still
remain united to him, or how they are subjected to him, when, without
fear, they may openly resist his Patriarchal power as soon as their
feeble arms have acquired sufficient strength to gather the fruits which
were to serve them as food. No, this hellish Sect acknowledges no ties.
All those of nature, as well as those of government or religion, were to
be dissolved in Weishaupt's last mysteries. The child, like the savage
tyger of the forest, was to abandon his parents when strong enough to go
alone in quest of his prey. And this is what the Sect calls restoring
man to his primitive state of nature, to the Patriarchal life, to those
days when filial piety compensated for all the necessary laws of civil
society. Yes, it is by the most abandoned depravation of all morals, by
the extinction of the purest and justest sentiments of nature, that
these conspirators consummate their last mysteries. In the name of
Equality and Liberty, they abjure the love and authority of their
country; in that name they curse the authority and love of their own
family.

<span id="page_517">p. 517</span>

As I proceed in revealing these plots, I know not whether the reader
does not frequently ask himself, What then can these men want? Have they
not fortunes to preserve in our state of society? Have they not children
in their families? Can they be conspiring against themselves? or, are
they ignorant that their conspiracies will fall back upon
themselves?—Those who can propose such questions are little acquainted
with the enthusiasm of error when inflated by the spirit of independence
and pride, of impiety and jealousy. They have not, like us, heard the
cant of the heroes, demi-heroes, and *sans-culottes* of the
revolution—They will be equal and free; they will it above all
things.—It must cost them many sacrifices, but they are ready to make
them—They will lose their fortunes in the pursuit, but you will not
preserve yours—He that served will become the equal, nor will he
recognize either God or man above him.—Have we not seen the prince of
the fallen angels exclaiming in his pride,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">             —Here at least  
We shall be free;—  
Here we may reign secure, and in my choice  
To reign is worth ambition, tho’ in hell:  
Better to reign in hell, than *serve* in heaven.</span>

</div>

It is not to one of [Weishaupt's](errata.htm#59.md) adepts that the ties of
nature are to be objects. He must be as heedless of the duty he owes to
his parents as of the affection due to his children, or the baleful
consequences of the mysteries cannot affect him. Can the reader have
forgotten the precept laid down for the *Insinuators* or
*Recruiters?*—*The principles; look always to the principles, never to
the consequences*. Or, in other words, strenuously support and insist
upon these great principles of Equality and Liberty; never be frightened
or stopped by [their](errata.htm#60.md) consequences, however disastrous
they may appear. These wretches, blinded by their pride, do not know,
then, that one single consequence proved to be false, contrary to
nature, or hurtful to mankind, is a sufficient demonstration that both
nature and truth hold the principle in detestation as the prime mover of
these disasters. These madmen, with all the confidence of an atheistical
Condorcet, when once become the adepts of Weishaupt, will exclaim even
in the very tribune of the National Assembly, *Perish the universe, but
may the principle remain!* They will not see, that this principle of
Equality and Liberty, devastating human nature, cannot be an Equality
and Liberty congenial to mankind. These unhappy men fall victims,
perishing under the axe of these disorganizing principles, and spend
their last breath in crying, *Equality and liberty* for ever. No; they
are all ignorant of the power of error stimulated by pride, who could
think of counteracting the plots of the Sect by the cries of nature, or
even by the self-interest of the illuminized adept.—They have not
sufficiently comprehended the artifice with which the Hierophant
insinuates, vivifies, and inflames the enthusiastic zeal of his adepts.

The reader may rest assured, that villany never slumbers; it watches
incessantly the opportunity for the completion of its views. It will
persuade the imbecile adept, that all his wants are to disappear on the
establishment of the

<span id="page_518">p. 518</span>

reign of Equality and Liberty; that he will be as free from wants as the
savage; that Nature shall provide for them; and this heedless adept
thirsts after such an Equality. If the adept ruffian be taught that *the
fruits belong to all, though the land to none*, he will easily find
means of obtaining his share.

But am I really thinking of reconciling the adepts with their plots?
What is it to them whether you see any agreement between them or not?
Villany, we all know, is replete with contradictions; but is it the less
wicked on that account, or are its crimes less real? In vain would the
reader object and say, What can these men want with their monstrous
Equality, with their plots against our civil laws, our title to even the
very name of property? Must we then, to please them, abandon our
habitations; must we renounce all arts and sciences, and end with
burning our cities, towns, and villages, to follow them in herds like
the savage and Nomade clans?—Are half the inhabitants of the globe to be
slaughtered, the better to scatter these roaming herds? What can be the
object of those arts and sciences, and particularly of those *Minerval*
academies of Illuminism? Can it be for the propagation of science, or
the involving mankind again in the disasters of barbarism, that all this
parade of science is made? Can these Illuminees resemble the Goths,
Huns, or Vandals? And is Europe once more threatened with an inundation
of barbarians like those which formerly sallied from the North? In
answering such questions, the reader may expect that I would put certain
restrictions on the views of the Sect. Nothing like a restriction or
qualification. No; you must renounce all the arts, all the sciences; you
must begin by firing your habitations, not only your cities, towns, and
villages, in short all your fixed habitations, unless you stop the
disorganizing career of the Sect. Yes, wherever its legions shall be at
liberty to act and accomplish the grand object of the Sect, there you
may expect to see those scenes of plunder, rapine, and devastation,
which heretofore traced the awful progress of the Huns, Goths, or
Vandals; and this inference is fairly drawn from the very Code of the
Sect.

Has not the reader heard the Hierophant insinuating the designs of the
Sect upon the arts and sciences? Has he not taught the adept to answer,
when asked what misfortunes reduced human nature to slavery, that it
*was civil society, the state, governments, and sciences*? Has he not
heard him exclaim, When shall the day come when, the clod of useless
sciences banished form the earth, man shall recognize no other but the
savage or nomade state, and which the Sect styles patriarchal,
primitive, natural? Has he not declared, that the happiness and glory of
the Sect would be at its zenith when, beholding those happy days, it
could say, *This is our work? (Wenn die beschleünigung dieser periode,
unser werk ist?)* <span id="fr_191"></span>[23](#fn_191.md) Are we to be
duped by the name of *Minerval Academies*, with which the Sect decorates
its schools? Can we observe there any other study than that of applying
the sciences to the subversion of science, as well as to the total
annihilation of all religion or society, when we remark the anxiety with
which the Sect puts the following questions to the adept on his coming
out of these academies, wishing to know what progress he has made in its
principles before he is admitted to the illuminized priesthood:

<span id="page_519">p. 519</span>

"Do the *general* and *common* sciences to which men apply infuse real
light? Do they lead to true happiness? Are they not rather the offspring
of variegated wants, or of the anti-natural state in which men exist?
Are they not the invention of crazy brains laboriously subtle?" <span
id="fr_192"></span>[24](#fn_192.md) The reader has heard these questions,
he has heard the Sect blaspheme science, and will he still believe that
Illuminism recognizes any other sciences but those of the man-savage
equal and free, roaming in the forests? Have not the revolutionary
devastations, the multitude of monuments fallen beneath the hatchet of
the Jacobin brigand, already demonstrated the frantic hatred of the
modern Vandals? But the mysteries elucidate this enigma in a clearer
manner.

Reader, give vent to your indignation. Ask again, What can this
Weishaupt be? What are these adepts of Illuminism? Treat them as
barbarians, as Huns, as Ostrogoths; but see him smiling at your
contempt, and teaching his adepts to honour themselves by imitating, and
glory in the hope of hereafter surpassing, the disastrous devastations
of those barbarians.—Do you know in what light the illuminizing
legislator views these northern clans sallying from their forests and
desolating the most flourishing countries of Europe, firing its towns,
beating down its empires, and strewing the earth with ruins? He
complacently beholds the precious remains of the patriarchal race, the
true offspring of Nature; it is with their hatchets that he means to
regenerate mankind, and shape them out to the views of the Sect. I did
not note the lessons of the Hierophant on this subject, when lecturing
the future Epopt.—Hear the account which Weishaupt gives of these clans,
when he pretends to historify human nature, at that epoch marked in the
annals of Europe as a scourge, and called the inundation of the
barbarians. Here is his description:

At that period when all Europe had fallen prey to corruption, "Nature,
which had preserved the true race of men in its original vigour and
purity, came to the assistance of mankind. From distant, but poor and
sterile countries, she calls those *savage nations* and sends them into
the regions of luxury and voluptuousness to infuse new life into the
enervated species of the south; and with new laws and morals to restore
that vigour to human nature which flourished until an ill-extinguished
germ of corruption infected even that portion of mankind which
originally arrived in so pure a state," or those barbarians the
pretended regenerators of Europe sent by Nature.

Such are the encomiums lavished by the Sect on the Goths and Vandals.
You thought it would be offending this illuminized tribe to compare them
to barbarians; whereas they glory in the comparison. History has
described these northern clans as carrying every where fire and sword,
as ravaging countries, firing towns, destroying the monuments of the
arts, depopulating empires; their course is to be traced by ruins and
wastes, and in their train appear ignorance and the iron age. But in the
eyes of the adept this is not the exceptionable part of their conduct;
on the contrary, it was by such means that they were to regenerate
mankind, and second the grand object of nature. These barbarians leave
the regeneration in an imperfect state; in time they

<span id="page_520">p. 520</span>

adopt our usages and manners; they are civilized; the plains rise once
more in fertile crops; society is re-established; science returns; the
arts flourish under the protection of the laws; towns are re-peopled;
the *savage and primitive* race, confounded among the citizens, is
subjected to the same laws, and governments acquire their pristine
lustre.

Here, in the eyes of the adept, is the grand crime of these barbarians;
the Hierophant, deploring their fall, exclaims, "Oh had there remained
any sages among them, happy enough to have preserved themselves from the
contagion, how would they sigh after, and ardently wish to return to the
former abodes of their ancestors, there again to enjoy their former
pleasures on the banks of a rivulet, under the shade of a tree laden
with fruit, by the side of the object of their affections! It was then
that they conceived the high value of Liberty, and the greatness of the
fault they had committed in placing too much power in the hands
[of](errata.htm#61.md) one man—It was then that the want of Liberty made
them sensible of their fall, and seek means of softening the rigour of
Slavery;—but even then their [efforts](errata.htm#62.md) were only aimed
against the tyrant, and not against tyranny."

It is thus that the insidious and declaiming Sophister, but able
Conspirator, leads the adept through the labyrinth of his lesser
mysteries, not barely to imitate these barbarians, but to surpass their
devouring rage, by constancy, perseverance, and the perpetuation of
their devastations. Thus are to be explained all those questions on the
danger of reconquering *Equality and Liberty* only to lose them again.
Hence those exhortations "to unite and support each other; to increase
their numbers; and to begin by becoming powerful and terrible—You have
already done it, for the multitude sides with you—The wicked, who fear
you, seek protection beneath your banners—Henceforward your strength
will be sufficient to bind the remainder of mankind, subjugate them, and
stifle vice in its origin." <span id="fr_193"></span>[25](#fn_193.md)

Such will be the explanation of the revolutionary rage and madness which
has levelled beneath its blows such a multitude of majestic and
invaluable monuments of the arts and sciences—The cry of indignation
rising from every class suspends for a moment the sanguinary crimes of
the Jacobin Vandal, and he even pretends to weep.—Wait, and the last
mysteries shall be accomplished; wait, and you shall see the awful
bodings of the Hierophant fulfilled, and with fire and sword shall he
annihilate your laws, your sciences and arts, and erase your towns and
habitations.

Here in particular is to be found the origin of that revolutionary
ferocity, that thirst of blood, those insatiable proscriptions, those
incessant executions, and finally those banishments more artfully cruel
than the relentless guillotine. Yes, the time draws near when they shall
*bind the hands, subjugate, and crush* in their origin, what the Sect
calls the *wicked*, or, in other words, all who are proof against their
vile efforts; the time for *subjugating* and *destroying* every citizen
zealous in the cause of Religion, or wishing to support the laws, civil
society, or property. Like Huns and Vandals, the Sect has begun its
career; but it will carefully avoid terminating it like them; the
devastations of its followers

<span id="page_521">p. 521</span>

shall be perpetuated, and they will be Vandals to the last, until
Religion, property, and the laws shall be irrecoverably lost. Such
atrocious plots are only the consequences of the lesser mysteries; but
trust the author of the Sect, the modern Spartacus, for the farther
developement of them. Has he not told you, that his last mysteries were
but the consequences, a clearer and more absolute exposition of the
foregoing secrets of the Order? He informed you, that nations, together
with their laws and social institutions, shall vanish, and that they
shall disappear before the all-powerful arm of his adepts, or his modern
Vandals. What new secret then remains to be discovered, unless it be
that no time shall blunt the sword or slack the unrelenting fury of his
proselytes; that they shall persevere until the end of time in their
Vandalism, lest Religion, society, science, arts, the love of their
country, and respect for property, should shoot forth again, and
overshadow the venemous growth of his Illuminized Equality and Liberty?

But Spartacus is not to be contented with these last secrets of the
Conspiracy; his pride cannot endure that others [should](errata.htm#63.md)
usurp the glory of the invention. Hitherto we have seen him play upon
the credulity of his adepts, inflame their zeal, and acquire their
respect by the pretended antiquity of his Order; and successively
attribute the honour of instituting his mysteries to the children of the
Patriarchs, the Sages, even to the god of Christianity, and to the
founders of the Masonic Lodges. But now the time is come when the adept,
initiated in the higher mysteries, is supposed to be sufficiently
enthusiastic in his admiration of the Order for the chiefs no longer to
fear *to disclose the real history of Illuminism*. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[26](#fn_194.md) Here they inform him, that this secret
society, which so artfully led him from mystery to mystery, which has
with such persevering industry rooted from his heart every principle of
Religion, all false ideas of love of the country or affection for his
family, all pretensions to property, to the exclusive right to riches,
or to the fruits of the earth; this society, which took such pains to
demonstrate the tyranny and despotism of all that he calls the laws of
empires; this society, which has declared him free, and teaches him that
he has no sovereign but himself, no rights to respect in others, but
those of perfect Equality, of absolute Liberty, and of the most entire
independence; this society is not the offspring of an ignorant and
superstitious antiquity, it is that of modem philosophy; in a word, it
is of our own invention. *The true father of Illuminism is no other
than* <span class="smallcaps">Spartacus Weishaupt</span>.

We must also perceive by many of Weishaupt's letters, that this latter
part of the secret, which attributed to him the whole honour of the
invention, always remained a mystery to the greater part of his *Mages*
and *Men-Kings*. Those alone who, under the title of Areopagites, formed
the grand council of the Order, were to be made acquainted with the real
chief and founder, except in certain cases where an adept was judged
worthy of so distinguished a mark of confidence. <span
id="fr_195"></span>[27](#fn_195.md) Whatever merit the adept might boast,
Weishaupt knew no higher recompence than to tell them in the end, "This
general

<span id="page_522">p. 522</span>

overthrow of the Altar, of the Throne, and of all Society, is a
conception of my own; to me and to me alone is due the whole glory."

I have revealed the disastrous secrets of Illuminism; I have laid open
the gradation and progressive degrees, the long chain of artifice, by
which the Sect prepares its adepts for the last mysteries, to behold
them stript of their veil without shuddering, and to embrace them with
enthusiastic ardour.—We must either commit the Code of the Sect to the
flames, and deny the truth of its annals; even refuse the evidence of
the familiar correspondence of *Spartacus* Weishaupt the founder, and of
*Philo*-Knigge the principal compiler; we must dispute all the
agreements of its most arduous co-operators, or else must we wait, as
the only possible demonstration, the entire and fatal execution of these
disastrous plots, before we positively pronounce, that the sole object
of their infernal plans and of their frantic wishes is no other than the
total overthrow of every Altar, of every Throne or Magistracy; the
annihilation of all authority and of all civil or religious society; the
destruction of property whether in the hands of the rich or of the poor;
and the very arts and sciences which can only be cultivated in civil
society are to be banished from the face of the earth. *Equality and
Liberty*, together with the most absolute independence, are to be the
substitutes for all rights and all property: Our morals and social
intercourse are to make place for the savage, vagabond, roaming life,
which the Sect alternately decorates with the name of *Nomade* and of
*Patriarchal*. The means to be employed in operating this change will be
found in the artifice, deceit, illusion and wickedness which the
Sophisters are masters of, until the force of numbers shall have
declared for the Sect; but when at length, powerful in numbers, the Sect
shall have acquired strength, it shall not only *bind hands*,
*subjugate*, murder, ravage, and renew all the horrors and atrocities of
the barbarians of the North, but also surpass those Vandals in the arts
of destruction, and without pity or distinction butcher all that part of
mankind that shall dare to oppose the progress of the Sect, presume to
heave a sigh over the ruins of religion, society, or property, or
attempt to raise them from their ashes.—If I have not proved that such
are the wishes, the secret machinations of the Sect and of its
flagitious principles, let me be informed what is to be understood by
proof, or what is to be the operation of evidence on the human
mind.—Were it possible that any of my readers still consoled themselves
with the idea that the frantic extravagance of these plots surpassed
their wickedness, let them remember that I have still something more to
say.—I have still to investigate the laws and interior government of the
Sect, laws adopted for the destruction of every other law or government,
and that it might hereafter prove, that however monstrous the object of
the plots of the Sect may be, it was far from being chimerical.

I might have quoted the testimony of another adept, who writes as
follows to the authors of the Eu-demonia: (Vol. III. No. 2, Art. 4.) "I
can also declare that I have been present at the grand mysteries;
particularly, that in 1785 I was entrusted with the instructions of the
degree of *Mage* or *Philosopher*, and that the short description given
in the <span class="smallcaps">Endliches Schicksal</span> (or the last
object of Freemasonry) is perfectly exact and well grounded." The author
of the *Endliches Schicksal* has only, like myself, copied the text from
*Biederman*. I have no knowledge of this new adept. I see he has signed
his letter, desiring the authors of the Eudemonia not to make use of his
name without an absolute necessity. "Besides," he adds, "I am a Roman
Catholic; and in the country in which I live might find disagreeable
consequences from not having asked to be absolved from my oath, *before
I published what I had promised to keep secret*." Sir, I am a Catholic
as well as yourself, and should wish to know where you have learned,
that the oath you had taken to the Illuminees was superior to that you
had taken to the state. How then could you reconcile with your
conscience the keeping back from the magistrate or the prince such
proofs as you had acquired of a conspiracy against the state? Yes, do
penance, and ask absolution for having taken such an oath, and for not
having been true to the oath of allegiance which you had sworn to the
state, and from which you could not be absolved by *any power on
earth*.—What singular ideas are sometimes formed of probity! To persuade
oneself that one is bound by an oath to a band of conspirators, while
the oath of allegiance is overlooked!—Sir, you had said, that it was
necessary to take proper precautions for your security, that *wretches
pretending to the power of life and death* might not assassinate you,
nothing could be more natural; take your precautions while informing the
public magistrate, but do not come and give us as an excuse your
fidelity to an oath, which in itself is nothing less than a perjury to
the state.

<span id="page_524">p. 524</span>

Notwithstanding, however, the reproach justly merited by this adept, his
testimony is not to be neglected, since he has sent his name to the
editors of the Eudemonia, a journal printed at Franckfort on the Mein,
and highly deserving of encouragement for the vigour with which the
editors combat the Illuminees. Their writings have frequently
corroborated materials that I had received from Austria and Bavaria,
which give me great confidence in the researches I have made.
