### PART II

#### SOME CRITICAL WORKS

It should be understood that the editors of the various texts mentioned
in Part I. have prefixed or appended thereto introductory matter of a
less or more elaborate kind, and that they are

<span id="page_701">p. 701</span>

therefore, within their measure, to be regarded as critical editions. To
these introductions I do not propose to refer in the present section,
nor do I lay any claim either to analysis of contents or exhaustive
bibliographical enumeration. The list will be useful for those who
desire to carry their studies further, more especially along textual
lines, and it has no higher pretension. As it follows, within certain
limits, a chronological arrangement, it will help to indicate the growth
of the criticism.

Joseph Görres: *Lohengrin, ein alt Deutsche Gedicht*, &c., 1813. The
introduction is sympathetic and interesting as an early study of the
Graal literature. The text is a Vatican MS. It may be mentioned that,
according to Görres, Mont Salvatch stands in Salvatierra, in Arragonia,
at the entrance into Spain, close to the Valley of Ronceval.

Le Roux de Lincy: *Analyse critique et littéraire du Roman de Garin*,
&c., 1835. And *Essai historique et littéraire sur l’abbaye de Fécamp*,
1840.  
This author also was a student of the subject, and his later work is
still our authority for the Fécamp legend.

Paulin Paris: *Les Manuscrits françois de la Bibliothèque du Roi*, 7
vols., 1836-48, and *Les Romans de la Table Ronde*, 5 vols.,
1868-1877.  
In the first work is contained what I believe to be the earliest account
of certain unprinted Graal texts. The second has modernised versions of
*The Metrical Joseph*, The *Book of the Holy Graal*, *The Early Prose
Merlin*, The *Vulgate Merlin* and the romance of *Lancelot of the Lake*.
The long introduction is still interesting and valuable reading. Paulin
Paris considered that *The Metrical Joseph* was founded on a Breton
Gospel-legend, and that the original Graal text was a Latin Gradual.

Francisque Michel and Thomas Wright: *Vie de Merlin, attribuèe à
Geoffroy de Monmouth*, 1837.  
The elaborate introduction is useful for Merlin literature and for
allusions to the prophet in other poems and romances.

San Marte, i.e. A. Schulz, *Der Mythus van Heiligen Graal*, 1837,
regarded at one time as the best survey of the subject; the Parzival of
Wolfram von Eschenbach, in modern German, 1836-1842; *Die Arthur-Sage
und die Mährchen des rothen Buchs von Hergest*, 1841; *Die Sagen von
Merlin*, 1853; with other works and numerous contributions to periodical
literature.  
San Marte considered: (*a*) that the *Lapis Exilis* was the

<span id="page_702">p. 702</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Stone of the Lord,
which at the beginning of all things was with God; (*b*) that the
passage of the Graal to the Kingdom of Prester John was itself a
suggestion of heresy, interior Asia being filled with numerous Christian
sects; (*c*) that Wolfram depicted a Christian Brotherhood, or Kingdom
of the Faithful, apart from pope and priesthood; (*d*) that the Graal
was not a Christian relic; and (*e*) that Wolfram's Provençal Kyot may
have been Guiot de Provins, that monk of Clairvaux who wrote the *Bible
Guiot* and had himself visited Jerusalem.

Karl Simrock: The *Parzival* of Wolfram von Eschenbach translated into
modern German, 1842, immediately after the completion of San Marte's
enterprise and traversing his most important [views](errata.htm#4.md);
Parzival und Titurel, 1857.  
This writer maintained: (*a*) That the original Graal Legend was
connected with St. John Baptist, whose head was enshrined at
Constantinople and was used to maintain the life of a dying emperor in
the eleventh century; (*b*) that the Templar connections of the
*Parsifal* were a mere reflection; (*c*) that the *Templeisen* were the
Knights of San Salvador de Mont Réal--founded in 1120; and (*d*) that
the Graal and its veneration suggest the Gnostic body called Christians
of St. John.

T. H. de la Villemarqué: *Les Romans de la Table Ronde et les contes des
anciens Bretons*, 1842; *Contes Populaires de la Bretagne*, 2 vols.,
1846 (fourth edition); *Myrdhinn ou l’Enchanteur Merlin* (new edition),
1861.  
In the last work Merlin is treated as a mythological, historical,
legendary and romantic character. It is entertaining, but largely
fantastic, and at the present day it is difficult to accept anything
advanced by this writer without careful verification. He considered that
a pagan tradition was received from the bards and, in combination with a
particular presentation of the Eucharistic mystery, was passed on to the
romancers of northern France. The Graal is Celtic, and the word
signifies a basin.

Reichel: *Studien zu Parzival*, 1856.  
This work was written in opposition to San Marte, and it denied that the
theology of the twelfth century should be applied to the interpretation
of the poem.

Louis Moland: *Origines littéraires de la France*, 1862.  
(*a*) The old history, the high history, was contained in a Latin book;
(*b*) it embodied that chivalrous ideal which it was sought to realise
in the Temple; (*c*) this was connected

<span id="page_703">p. 703</span>

with another idea, namely, that of communion apart; (*d*) the vast cycle
formed a systematic allegory; (*e*) but folk-lore intervened and a
strange admixture followed; (*f*) it is doubtful whether the books of
the Holy Graal can rank as orthodox; (*g*) beneath the allegory there
are *tendances suspectes;* (*h*) the errors diffused among the Templars
may have been reflected into works which evidently embody their
principles.

S. Baring-Gould: *Curious Myths of the Middle Ages*, 1867.  
At the period of its publication the essay on the *Sangreal*, contained
herein, provided a certain knowledge in a popular form, but at this day
it is without office or appeal.

F. G. Bergmann: *The San Grëal*, 1870.  
I think that this account was the first to offer in English an outline
of the *Later Titurel*, by A. von Scharfenberg. The two sources of all
Graal romances are the Quest-poem of Guyot and a Graal-history written
in Latin by Walter Map. The tract is translated from the French, but the
fact is not specified.

Gustav Oppert: *Der Presbyter Johannes in Sage and Geschichte*, 1870. An
interesting summary of the known facts concerning this mythical
personage.

Zarncke: *Zur Geschichte der Gralsage*, 1876.  
So far from being Provençal or Celtic, Graal literature has its source
in the legends concerning Joseph of Arimathæa. The metrical romance of
De Borron is the earliest in point of time and Chrétien drew therefrom,
but also from the *Quest of Galahad*, which itself was preceded by some
form of The *Book of the Holy Graal*. Guiot was an invention of Wolfram.

A. Birch-Hirschfeld: *Die Sage, vom Gral*, 1877; *Ueber die den
provenzalischen Troubadours des xii. and xiii. Jahrunderts*, 1878.  
The first work created a strong impression, and exercised great
influence at its period. The history of Robert de Borron preceded
Chrétien, who drew from De Borron's *Perceval-Quest*, on which Gautier
also depended. The *Longer Prose Perceval* drew from the *Quest of
Galahad* and The *Book of the Holy Graal*. The Graal is not Celtic, and
Robert de Borron followed the *Vindicta Salvatoris* and the *Gesta
Pilati*. His Sacred Vessel is one of sacramental grace. There is a
powerful defence of the *Didot Perceval*, in which De Borron ingarnered
Breton legends. The source of Wolfram was Chrétien, and him only.

E. Martin: The decisive findings of Birch-Hirschfeld were opposed by
this writer in a German *Journal of Archæology*, 1878,

<span id="page_704">p. 704</span>

and in *Zur Gralsage, Unterschungen*, 1880. He maintained the Celtic
origin of the legend, the possibility of a Latin version, the
unlikelihood that the *Didot Perceval* belongs to the De Borron trilogy,
and that the derivation of Wolfram was from a source other than
Chrétien.

C. Domanig: *Parzival-Studien* (Two Parts), 1878-80.  
A defence of Wolfram as an adherent of the Catholic faith.

G. Bötticher: *Die Wolfram Literatur seit Lachmann*, 1880.  
A consideration of the argument for and against the indebtedness of
Wolfram to no source but that of Chrétien and tending to the conclusion
that another source is probable.

J. Van Santen: *Zur Beurtheilung Wolfram von Eschenbach*, 1882. A
hostiles criticism of the poet's ethical position, founded, however, not
on the limitations of the *Parsifal*, but on Wolfram's general
concessions to the morality of his time.

W. Hertz: *Sage vom Parzival und dem Gral*, 1882.  
The motive of the legends must be sought in the anti-Papal spirit of the
British Church, within which it was, for this and other reasons,
developed.

Paul Steinbach: *Vber dem Einfluss des Crestien de Troies auf die
altenglische Literatur*, 1885.  
An exhaustive study of the debt due to Chrétien and Breton tradition by
the Thornton Syr Percyvelle.

M. Gaster: *Jewish Sources of and Parallels to the Early English
Metrical Legends of King Arthur and Merlin*, 1887.  
The contention is that the commerce between women and demons has its
authority in the Talmud, to which I might add that the legendary orgies
of the mediæval Black Sabbath have some of their roots therein. I do not
think that comparisons of this kind serve much purpose.

Gaston Paris: *La Littèrature française au moyen-age*, 1888; *Histoire
Littéraire de la France*, vol. xxx., 1888.  
I cite two instances only from the long literary record of this
excellent and charming scholar. It is impossible in a brief note to
speak of his whole achievement. I will specify only one point with which
I have just made acquaintance, and this is that, in his opinion, as
independently in my own, the beginning and the end of Gerbert's
alternative sequel to the *Conte del Graal* may have suffered
alteration.

Alfred Nutt: *Studies on the Legend of the Holy Graal*, 1888.  
The sub-title adds--"with special reference to the hypothesis of its
Celtic origin." It was this work which paved a way for the criticism of
the Graal literature in England, and I am certain that no more welcome
offering could be made to

<span id="page_705">p. 705</span>

scholars everywhere than the issue of a new edition, with such extension
and revision as would be warranted by the present state of our
knowledge. Mr. Nutt has done more than any one in this country to
promote the acceptance of the Celtic source in legend, but he has the
gift of treating all the competitive hypotheses on every side of the
subject with moderation and fairness. He regards the De Borron story as
the starting-point of Christian transformation, and of late years he has
shown some disposition to accept the possibility of Templar influence on
the development of the literature. In 1902 Mr. Nutt published a pamphlet
on the *Legends of the Holy Graal* which offers a serviceable summary.

Professor Rhys: *Studies in the Arthurian Legend*, 1891.  
A development of Welsh analogies, a theory of Celtic origins, tinctured
with the old dream of solar myths at the root of many of the stories.

Richard Heinzel: *Ueber die franzoezischen Gralromane*, 1891.  
An elaborate and careful examination. The *Longer Prose Perceval* is
said to depend from Gerbert, and the priority of the Quest is rejected.

G. M. Harper: *The Legend of the Holy Graal*, 1893.  
Though it can be scarcely regarded as a work of original research there
is here an useful resumption of results obtained by scholarship, showing
an acquaintance with the original documents of the literature. The
Graal, as typifying the Eucharist, was the beginning, middle and end of
all the cycles. "It is as if a Divine hand had been holding the hands of
all the writers of these books."

Miss Jessie L. Weston: I have mentioned already the English translation
of the *Parsifal*, which has only one disadvantage, being its
unfortunate metrical form. Since the period of its publication, Miss
Weston has written: (1) *The Legend of Gawain*, 1897; (2) *The Legend of
Sir Lancelot du Lac*, 1900; (3) *The Three Days' Tournament*, 1902; (4)
*The Legend of Perceval*, vol. i., 1906. These are individual
monographs, and the two last are of particular and high importance. Miss
Weston has also translated several Arthurian texts not included in the
great collection of Malory, and among these I will mention (5) the
episode of *Morien*, 1901, derived from the *Dutch Lancelot*, and (6)
*Sir Gawain at the Grail Castle*, 1903, being extracts from the *Conte
del Graal*, *Diu Crône*, by Heinrich, and the prose *Lancelot*. The
others are not of our concern exactly.  
Among English writers, Miss Weston is our foremost textual

<span id="page_706">p. 706</span>

scholar in respect of the literature of the Holy Graal. In the *Legend
of Sir Lancelot* she has dwelt upon the necessity of collating the
numerous manuscripts of this vast romance with a view to the production
of a sound text. Whether she herself projects this undertaking there is
no means of knowing; perhaps it would be possible only to a concerted
effort, but there is no single student who is better fitted for the
task. In the *Legend of Perceval* she has made an important first-hand
study of texts now extant of the *Conte del Graal*, and the results are
with us. It is to her that we owe the discovery of the Fécamp reference
in Manessier. The place of that abbey in the reliquary-history of the
Precious Blood has been known, of course, to students since the
collection of documents included by Leroux de Lincy in his account of
the ancient religious foundation.

Dr. Sebastian Evans: *In Quest of the Holy Graal*, 1898.  
An amazing dream, which identifies Innocent III. with the Rich
Fisherman, the Emperor with the King of Castle Mortal, St. Dominic with
Perceval, the Interdict of 1208 with the languishment and enchantments
of Britain, and the question which should have been asked, but was not,
with an omission of St. Dominic to secure the exemption of the
Cistercians from certain effects of the Interdict. Lancelot is the elder
Simon de Montfort; Gawain is Fulke of Marseilles; Alain le Gros is
Alanus de Insulis, the universal Doctor; Yglais, the mother of Perceval,
is Holy Church. The Graal is, of course, the Eucharist, which is denied
to Logres. The speculation is founded on the *Longer Prose Perceval*, so
that no distraction is caused by the presence of Blanchefleur, but as
all French texts of quest speak of the removal or internment of the
Sacred Vessel, it is a pity that the ingenuity which has woven this
wonderful web should have passed such a point in silence. I fear that in
all truth Dr. Evans has not succeeded in creating more conviction than,
I suppose, has Dr. Vercoutre; but he has gifts in literature, gifts of
entertainment and gifts of subtlety which are wanting to his French
*confrère*.

Dr. Wendelin Foerster--who projected a complete edition of the works of
Chrétien de Troyes--has published several texts, including (1) *Erec und
Enid*, 5896; (2) *Cligès*, 1901; (3) *Yvain*, 1902.  
As regards the *Conte del Graal*, he considered that its confessed
prototype, the book belonging to Count Philip of Flanders, was not a
quest of the Sacred Vessel but a prose account of the Palladium.

<span id="page_707">p. 707</span>

Paul Hagan: *Der Graal*, 1900.  
This study has been welcomed warmly by scholars; it is valuable in many
respects, but more particularly for the. German cycle, Guiot de Provence
and his eastern elements Dr. Hagan suggests a Persian origin for the
name Flegitanis = Felek thâni = *sphæra altera*.

Dr. A. T. Vercoutre: *Origine et Genèse de la Légende du Saint Graal*,
1901.  
This tract claims to offer the solution of a literary problem. The
legend of the Graal is based upon an error of translation. The supposed
Vessel, or *Vas*, is the Celtic *Vasso*, and the romances really
commemorate the Gaulish Temple of Puy de Dôme, mentioned by Gregory of
Tours. It was originally Gaulish and dedicated to Lug, but it was Roman
subsequently, and was then sacred to Mercury. It was a place of
initiation and as such hidden from the world, like the Graal. The Temple
was unearthed in 1873. This appears to be a frantic hypothesis.

W. A. Nitze: *The Old French Graal Romance*, 1902.  
Here is an attempt to determine more fully the relation of the *Longer
Prose Perceval* to Chrétien and his continuators. Mr. Nitze agrees that
we have no certain knowledge as to the original form of Gerbert's poem.

C. Macdonald: *Origin of the Legend of the Holy Graal*, 1903.  
This is, unfortunately, an introduction only to a large projected work,
but the death of the author intervened. There is an interesting account
of early apocryphal and later traditions concerning Joseph, Nicodemus,
Pilate, Veronica, &c. The intention was--at the term of a full inquiry
into the documentary sources--to consider whether the Graal tradition at
its core was known under another form before it was adapted to Christian
symbolism, "having been borrowed from a system of which it was a
legitimate and undoubted growth and which presented many points in
common with the hagiology and ritual of both eastern and western
churches."

Dorothy Kempe: *Legend of the Holy Graal*, 1905.  
This pamphlet was written to accompany the *History of the Holy Graal*
of Lovelich or Lonelich. The prospectus of the *Early English Text
Society* describes it as a capital summary. It is a reflection of
previous English authorities.
