### II

#### NEW CONSIDERATION CONCERNING THE BRANCHES OF THE CHRONICLE

Not the least difficulty in the *Book of the Holy Graal*, regarded as a
work of "truth in the art" of its particular mystery, is the divergence
exhibited by the extant manuscripts. These differences meet us, perhaps
chiefly, at the inception of the story, though they are with us even at
the end. In respect of the latter there are texts which incorporate a
distinct romance which is impertinent to the design of the story. In
respect of the former, it should be understood that it is of the essence
of the whole design to make a beginning from the same point of departure
at which Robert de Borron started his metrical romance, and all
recensions present therefore some kind of prose version reflecting his
narrative. One of them--and it is the most available of the printed
texts--has only moderately grave variations from the *Lesser Holy Graal*
up to that epoch of the story when the company of Joseph of Arimathæa
set out on their journey westward; but another presents a brief summary
which scarcely stands for the original. It is not part of my province to
express opinions belonging to the domain of textual criticism, but I
think that the design of the *Book of the Holy Graal* is represented
better and more typically by a manuscript like that which was made use
of by Dr. Furnivall for the Early English Text Society, and this is the
summarised form, than it is by a manuscript like that which Hucher
selected for the first printed edition, and this is the extended
version.

The incorporation of De Borron elements serves one purpose which is
material from my own point of view, as it sets in relief the distinction
*ab origine symboli* between the actuating motives of the two cycles of
literature. It will be remembered that in the metrical romance and its

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

later reflections the narrative is broken rudely at that moment when the
horizon has begun to expand by an inspired resolution of the company to
part into several groups and proceed westward separately. Three
subsequent divisions were involved hereby, and these Robert de Borron
promised to expound in their proper order when he received true reports
concerning them. The author of the *Book of the Holy Graal* undertook to
supply these missing branches, but as the results differ, and in no
light manner, from the manifest intent of De Borron, it may be deduced
that they are not the real history, as this might have been set forth by
the pious minstrel. On his part there was probably no design to bring
Joseph of Arimathæa either to the *Vaux d’Avaron* or another part of
Britain. The doubtful meaning of some of his lines must be taken in
connection with the general scheme of his narrative. That scheme was to
establish the mystery of sanctity in great seclusion under the
government of a single keeper, with a life protracted through the
centuries, until the time of its possible manifestation came. The
*Lesser Holy Graal* is a reasonably faithful version of his nearly
complete poem, though it is doubtful regarding Joseph's final
destination. The *Early History of Merlin* is also faithful to what
remains of De Borron's second metrical romance. Of the *Didot Perceval*
we cannot speak so certainly, but in several points about which we have
materials for judgment--and more especially regarding Moses--it does not
correspond properly. It is even possible that the *Didot Perceval* is a
speculative completion of the trilogy, characterised by remarkable
insight, and yet without any accurate notion of De Borron's design, this
being manifested imperfectly by his extant literary remains.

It will be understood, therefore, that the *Book of the Holy Graal*, or
the great romance which follows the parable of the prologue, begins, in
the codex here followed, with a short account of the chief incidents in
the life of our Saviour and the condition of Palestine at the period.

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It repeats the
familiar story of the *Lesser Holy Graal*, but sometimes, as we have
seen, only by way of summary, and always with many variations. The fact
that Joseph is married and has a son in his infancy at the time of the
Passion of Christ may be taken as the first important point of
difference; he is named after his father, and to distinguish between
them the orthography adopted by the romance to designate the son is
Josephes, for which in the present account I shall substitute Joseph II.
The next point of difference, with which we are also acquainted already,
concerns the identification of the Holy Graal with the dish of the
Paschal Supper--*en quoi li flex dieu avoit mangie*--instead of with the
Eucharistic vessel of sacrifice; but it should be said that there is
another text which follows the description in the *Lesser Holy Graal*.
The circumstances under which the Great Hallow was discovered, after the
apprehension of Christ, also vary, and in place of its abstraction by a
Jew, who carries the Hallow to Pilate, it is found by Joseph himself in
the house where the Pasch was eaten, and is removed by him to be kept
for a memorial of the Master. As in the other romances, it is used to
collect the blood, which, however, is done no longer on Calvary, but in
the sepulchre itself. The general lines established by Robert de Borron
are followed as regards the imprisonment of Joseph, the circumstances
under which he was released by Vespasian after a term of forty-two
years, and the vengeance wreaked upon the Jews. All lapse of years
notwithstanding, Joseph is reunited to his wife and son, is baptized,
with a great number of his relatives, and he is directed by Christ to go
with those who will follow him into distant countries, carrying neither
gold, silver, nor any material possession except the Holy Graal. It is
after this point that the prototype of Robert de Borron is abandoned
once and for all. The first destination--reached by way of Bethany and
the Wood of Ambush--is the city of Sarras, situated in a country of the
same name on the confines of Egypt. From this land it is

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

stated that the Saracens originated; the people are described as
worshippers of the sun, moon and planets. It is also this place which is
termed in later romances the spiritual city, though it is not on account
of the faith found in its citizens--who appear to have been a perverse
nation at the beginning and end--but because, according to the story, it
contained the *palais esperiteus*, which name was given it by the
prophet Daniel, who emblazoned it on the door thereof. The story is
apocryphal, but the design is to show that even the seers of Israel were
aware of the coming of the Graal, for it was in this palace that the
Eucharist was first consecrated. It was the witness on the dry land, as
the ship of Solomon was the witness on the open sea.

At Sarras Joseph found Evalach, its aged king, in great trouble through
an invasion of his country by the Egyptians under Ptolemy. Joseph
commended his conversion as a certain guarantee of his victory, but the
king, though not disinclined, was not baptized actually until his
enemies were dispersed with final slaughter. The power operating in his
favour rested chiefly in a cross painted on his shield by Joseph. The
story of the war and its wonders occupies a substantial part of the
narrative, and before Joseph departed on his further journey westward
the whole population of the country appears to have embraced
Christianity. Several churches were built in the city or its vicinity,
bishops and priests were ordained, and masses were celebrated therein.

England is the Promised Land which the special providence of the story
has allocated to the spiritual and material lineage of Joseph of
Arimathæa; and after the departure from Sarras the sole concern of all
the involved adventures is, separately or collectively, to bring the
various characters to this country and to reunite them therein, the
evangelisation of the existing inhabitants being the palmary term of
all. Speaking of the rank and file, apart from several of the more
important personages, the good Christians are transported hither
miraculously

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

on a garment belonging to the second Joseph, but those who are imperfect
come by ship. Some of the great heroes arrive independently under
circumstances which I shall describe in the considerations to each
allotted. Joseph of Arimathæa reaches the general bourne, and though the
superior importance of his son causes him to be almost effaced, we hear
of him from time to time during long years of continued existence. At
length he left this world to be united with Christ, to whom all his love
was dedicated. He was buried at the Abbey of the Cross in Scotland, for
which one codex substitutes Glastonbury.

There is a general sense in which the *Book of the Holy Graal*--like the
metrical romance of De Borron--is the Book of the Divine Voice which
speaks from the Sacred Vessel, though this is not used to pronounce
oracles or to separate the good from the evil as it does in the earlier
text. The difficulties which are raised by the story regarding that
Mystery of Faith which it exists to show forth are so grave and so
numerous that I must be satisfied with the registration of the fact and
its illustration by one instance. The whole notion of the Eucharist is
changed by the supposition that, on occasion, it is administered to
angels, for by no hypothesis can Christ be regarded as their Saviour.

Seeing that there is no clear division of episodes in the story, so that
one section can be separated definitely from another, I shall attempt
only a general grouping. The master-branch of the whole prodigal romance
is that which embraces the mission of Joseph II.--this is of the
essence, and all else is, in comparison, of the accidental order. About
this central figure the wonder of the Graal converges and the confused
cloud of marvellous incidents; from the first even to the last, he is
thus steeped in a light of mystery that "never was on land or sea."
Prior to the arrival at Sarras a command was received from the Son of
God to build an ark, similar to that of the Old Covenant, for the
reception of the Holy

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Graal. Public
devotions were to take place before it, but only Joseph and his son had
a right to open the Shrine, to look into the Reliquary and to take it in
their hands. Two chosen men were deputed to carry the Ark on their
shoulders when the company was on the march. The intention was evidently
to invest the new symbol with the same authority as that palladium which
once belonged to Israel. To provide sustenance for the band during the
journey, each disciple--after the daily service of prayer--found in his
lodging the food which he desired in abundance, but it is not said that
it was provided by the Holy Graal.

While the conversion of the King and the issue of the war were still
pending at Sarras, things of far other importance were taking place in
respect of the Sacramental Mystery under the charge of Joseph and his
son. The pilgrims on their advent had been lodged in that building which
was named the Spiritual Palace. The inhabitants of Sarras did not know
why it had received this designation, but the arrival of the Christian
cohort was to reveal the prophetic mystery--firstly, by the presence of
the Ark and the Graal therein, and, secondly, by the sacred wonders
which accompanied the ordination of Joseph II., with Christ manifested
visibly as the Celebrant-in-chief. In that Palace, on the day following
their arrival, the Holy Spirit advised Joseph the father that his son
had been chosen to guard the Graal, as the Aaron of the new Rite, that
he was to be ordained by the highest consecration, and was to transmit
the priesthood to those whom he deemed worthy thereof. Joseph II.
received also the power to hand on the Sacred Vessel to whomsoever he
would, and it is to be inferred that he committed everything in the
plenary sense--as if Christ said to His successor: "My peace I leave
with you; My peace I give unto you."

When the company were worshipping before the Ark in the Spiritual
Palace, the Holy Spirit descended in still fire, as at another
Pentecost, and entered into the mouth of each

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

one of them, like the Eucharist of some final dispensation which has not
been declared on earth. It communicated, however, the gift of silence
instead of the gift of tongues. A Voice also spoke and though apparently
it was that of the Spirit, it was also the voice of Christ. The
discourse was memorable enough, but I can speak only of its end, when
the younger Joseph was directed to approach and receive the most great
honours which could be conferred on earthly creature. He opened the door
of the Ark and beheld a man clothed in a terrible vestment of scarlet
flame. There were also five angels apparelled after the same manner,
each having six wings of fire, like the vision of Ezekiel. In their
right hands they held various symbols of the Passion--about which we
have heard already--and each in his left carried an ensanguined sword.
The human figure was that of Christ, with the five wounds upon Him. It
is said by the text that the Ark had been magnified strangely, so that
it would hold the Divine Personalities of the vision: but I conclude
rather that when the door was opened, those who were empowered to behold
looked as into a seering-glass, which contains at need the earths of the
universe and the earths of the starry heavens, with all that dwell
thereon. The state of the second Joseph is shown by the words addressed
to his father, praying that he should touch him in nowise, lest the
speaker be drawn from the joy of his entrancement. That which he next
beheld was the crucifixion itself, presented in ritual form, with the
angels for the actors therein. It seemed even as in one of the Greater
Mysteries which I have seen with my own eyes, when the Adept Master is
set on a cross of dedication and the officers of the high ceremonial are
those who combine to immolate him. But the design in the case under
notice was rather to certify concerning the Vessel of the Graal, for the
side of Christ was pierced and the *sang réal* poured therein. The scene
closed and a new scene was opened, this time more especially before the
eyes of Joseph the father. What

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

he beheld was an altar within the Ark draped in white over red, bearing
the Sacred Dish, the nails of transfixion and the ensanguined head of
the Lance. These objects were arranged on the epistle and gospel sides,
but in the centre--or place of consecration--covered with a white
corporal--there was a rich golden vessel with a covercle, also of gold,
and it is recorded that all precautions were taken that the contents
should remain hidden. A procession of angels entered with lights,
aspergillus, thurible, incense-boat, and then--out of all knowledge--one
carrying a head, as I suppose, on a salver, and another with a drawn
sword. This pageant went about the house, as if for a Rite of
Consecration, the Graal being also carried, and Christ entered, even as
the Priest of the Rite, clad in sacramental robes for the celebration of
Mass. The circumambulation being finished for the cleansing of the whole
place--which, in spite of its name, had been the abode of evil and the
spirit thereof--Christ told Joseph II. that he was to receive the
Eucharist, and, as if constituted a secret pope, he was made and
ordained sovereign bishop reigning over the world of Christendom. He was
clothed with rich episcopal vestments and set in an episcopal chair,
which the text says was still preserved at Sarras, where it proved to be
another Siege Perilous and whosoever sat therein was maimed or destroyed
utterly. Joseph was anointed by Christ, and with the oil which was used
for this purpose the Kings of England were consecrated in later years up
to the time of Uther Pendragon; but it was missing at his coronation.
The ring of investiture, given to the prelate thus hallowed strangely,
could be counterfeited by no human skill, nor could words express the
virtues contained in its jewel.

When the ceremony was at length over and the divine discourse had
explained one by one the spiritual significance of each part of his
clothing, Joseph II. was instructed by Christ to consecrate the sacred
elements, and it thus came about that the people of the new

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

exodus communicated for the first time: but the Host which was elevated
by Joseph was the body of a child and that which was received by the
faithful, in the mouth of each one among them, was living and undivided
flesh. The administration to the cohort of worshippers was, however,
performed by angels, one of whom took the paten together with the
chalice and placed both of them in the Holy Vessel of the Graal. Whether
the Precious Blood adhered to the Eucharistic Vessel and the content of
the Reliquary thus suffered diminution we do not know, nor the purpose
otherwise of the ceremony, which, fortunately for the spiritual side of
*la haute convenance*, is not repeated either in the romance itself or
anywhere in the literature.

Thus was the second Joseph consecrated in the super-apostolical degree,
and thus did he see--at least in the sense of the story--all Christ's
mysteries openly. The issues which are raised by the narrative are much
more complicated than will be gathered from the preceding summary.
Scholarship has paid little heed to the importance of the sacramental
question and all connected therewith, but it has not overlooked the
pontifical supremacy which is ascribed to the reputed founder of
Christianity in Britain. While the ecclesiastical consequence to these
islands is perhaps the only thing which can be said to stand forth
clearly, it must be added that if the intention was to make void one
claim of the Papacy, there was never a design so clouded and veiled so
sedulously. The brief for any secret pontificate is proclaimed much less
openly than the general brief for the official Church, with all its ways
and laws, as we are acquainted with its body--politic and spiritual--at
the period. Still it is said expressly, in words ascribed to the Master:
(*a*) that Joseph has been chosen as the first pastor of a new flock;
(*b*) that his eminence is comparable explicitly in the New Law with
that of Moses, the Leader of Israel, in the Law which had been now
superseded; (*c*) that wherever he went, converting people and places,
he was there to consecrate bishops and ordain priests, who

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

would have power to bind and loose, even as the apostles; and that, in
fine (*d*), to the younger Joseph was committed the government of souls,
but to the elder that of bodies--the spiritual and temporal powers. It
does not appear especially that the latter ever exercised his
prerogative; but it may be recalled that whereas the first issue of the
temporal power was after the spiritual kind, the second was after the
material--on the one hand, Joseph II., who never married, whose office
was devised by election; on the other, Galahad le Fort, who became an
earthly King, who was anointed with the mystic oils by his brother
Joseph, and who reigned gloriously. We may speculate, but it will be all
in vain, as to what was in the mind of the author when he substituted a
son for the father, and, as if further to confuse the issues, gave both
of them the same name. Whatever the explanation may be, from that moment
when the younger man assumed the reins of government in the spiritual
degree, the older ceased to retain even the shadow of power. As regards
Galahad le Fort, his birth took place in Britain, and it was foretold to
his brother in a vision that he would be the ancestor of a holy lineage
of many men of religion, who should maintain the name of our Saviour in
all honour and all power throughout these islands.

His great election and his association in the highest notwithstanding,
the second Joseph was not intended to escape without the purgation of
suffering. When he and his company were at Orcauz, in the district of
Sarras, he was punished for attempting to bind a devil who was hovering
over the dead bodies of certain Saracens; for this indiscretion, a great
vindicating angel, with a marvellous countenance, drove a spear into his
thighs and left the weapon therein. Subsequently, he was healed by
another angel, who drew out the head of the spear. That which Joseph II.
should have contrived was apparently the conversion of the heathen, and
in this having failed he was not to intervene between the destroyer and

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

the victims. I mention these matters, firstly, because the office of
wounding in the thighs recurs so continually in the romances, and,
secondly, to note that for some obscure reason the injury in question
never befalls the questing knights. The Lance used on this occasion is
also important because of its after-history, for it was destined to
prove the beginning of those great marvels which would occur in the land
of Britain. At that time it is said that the Lance will drop blood and
will strike--also in both thighs--another personage of the mystery, a
knight full of charity and chastity, who will suffer for as many years
as Joseph had carried the weapon in his own wound for days. These, on
the computation of the victim, proved to be twenty-two. The reference is
here to King Pellehan, whose wounding is narrated, as we know, in the
*Huth Merlin*, and who is healed in the *Quest of Galahad;* the wounding
in question is the Dolorous Stroke inflicted by the poor knight Balyn;
and it follows that the *Book of the Holy Graal* gives an origin of the
Lance-Hallow which either differs from that of all other texts or it has
omitted to mention that the angel of the judgment used the Spear of the
Passion.

When the company of pilgrims at length reached the sea-shore, from which
they must cross over to Britain, those who bore the Ark of the Graal on
their shoulders walked over the intervening waters as if upon the dry
land; of the others, those, who were in a state of grace crossed on the
shirt of the second Joseph, as if on a raft; but the evil livers were
left to fare as they could till ships could be found to carry them. I am
not concerned with the events which followed the arrival of all and
sundry in the promised land of their inheritance, but as regards Joseph
II., his evangelical journeys through England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland
and, as it is, said, other strange countries, continue through the rest
of the narrative, till at last he visits King Evalach in an abbey which
had been founded by the latter and informs him of his own immediate
death on the following day. This occurs

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

accordingly at the hour of prime next morning, and he was buried in the
abbey. So was Joseph II. gathered into the Kingdom of the Father, and I
pass now to the history of one who was designed as a witness through the
centuries to that mystery which was from the beginning of the Christian
times, who, in fine, could enter into his rest only through the arms of
Galahad.

King Evalach received the name of Mordrains in baptism, and he remained
in his kingdom after Joseph and his company continued their journey
westward. The design of the story, as we have seen, is, however, to
bring all its characters into la bloie Bretagne, and with this object it
puts the most complicated machinery in motion for some of the palmary
heroes. I must speak only concerning the term in its attainment,
omitting in the present case the visions and the bodily transportations
which befell Mordrains for his further instruction and purgation. He
left Sarras ultimately and for ever, taking his wife with him and three
hundred barons, and proceeding to the rescue of Joseph, whom a
revelation had told him was imprisoned by the King of North Wales. His
own realm was committed to the charge of the good knight Aganore, who
was to be King in his place and so to remain if he did not return
himself. He carried with him the white shield by the help of which he
overcame the powers of Egypt, so that this also passed into the West and
was kept in perpetuity as one of the Lesser Hallows. The journey took
place by ship in the ordinary way; Joseph and his people were rescued in
due course, and of all their enemies not one was left alive. For this
providence public thanksgivings took place in the presence of the Graal,
the Ark of the New Covenant being set open for the purpose. Evalach, who
had experienced already the delicious effects which followed an
exposition of the Sacred Vessel, desired to see with his I own eyes the
interior of that Sanctuary from which the grace appeared to emanate.
Though incapacitated by wounds received in the recent combats, he went
to the

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

door of the Ark and looked in. He saw the Holy Dish and the Chalice used
for Eucharistic purposes. He saw also Bishop Joseph clothed in the
beautiful vestments in which he had been consecrated by Christ. The
romance says that no mind could conceive and much less the tongue
express all that which was discovered to him. So far he had been
kneeling with head and shoulders bent forward, but he now arose and
pressed nearer. In vain a voice issued from a burning cloud and warned
him to desist; he advanced his head further, when paralysis and
blindness overtook him. Of all his members he preserved only the use of
his tongue, and the first words which he pronounced were those of
adoration, even for the misfortune which had befallen him and which he
also recognised that he deserved for surprising Divine Secrets. Even at
the price of his health, and of age-long suffering thereafter, he would
not have renounced the knowledge which he had attained in the Ark. One
of the spectators asked what he had seen, and he answered: "The end of
the world, the Marvel of all marvels, the Wisdom which is above wisdom,
the King of every king." The last wish recorded on the part of Evalach,
who henceforth was to be termed Mehaigné--that is to say, the Maimed
King--was that he should be carried to a hermitage far from other
habitation, as the world and he had no further need for one another. The
second Joseph approved, because the day of Evalach's death would not be
witnessed even by his children's children. He was carried on a litter to
the hermitage and placed before the altar, where he would be in the
presence of the Body of the Lord whenever Mass was celebrated thereat.
Upon the site of the hermitage a fair abbey was built subsequently, and
there Mehaigné remained till the coming of the younger Galahad--or, as
the chronology of the story states, for 200 years. On the day which
preceded the death of Joseph II. that First Bishop of Christendom
anointed the King's White Shield with his own blood, thus making a
second cross upon it. It was reserved for

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

the Knight Galahad, and should any one attempt to use it in the meantime
he would repent it quickly. Mehaigné regained his sight so that he could
behold this shield and the ceremony of the Unspotted Sacrifice.

With the story of Evalach there is connected that of his wife, Queen
Sarracinte. While her husband was in warfare with the hosts descended
from Egypt, she sent for Joseph to ask news concerning him, praying the
apostle to intercede with God and to turn him to her own belief. Her
mother had been converted through the offices of a certain hermit, and
this, assisted by a vision, led to her own christening. Thereafter she
was permitted to see a white box which was kept by the elder lady among
treasures of jewels, and on being opened it proved to contain our
Saviour under the element of bread. The mother received the Host, for it
proved that she was departing this life, and she charged her daughter to
keep the box secretly, and so have Christ every day in her company, as
by a high dispensation had been permitted in her own case. When she was
dead Queen Sarracinte went to the hermit, obtained Christ from him, as a
sacred treasure, received the Host in the secret tabernacle and
performed her devotions in Its presence. Outside this amazing
reservation, the point of importance is that although Joseph II. was, by
the hypothesis of the story, the first priest to consecrate the elements
of the Eucharist, this was being done already--apparently long
before--by a hermit in Sarras, who must have derived from the ordinary
apostles. There is a suggestion of strange implicits in the names of the
next character which I have placed on my list for inclusion in these
major branches. He was Seraphe in his days as a paynim, carrying an axe
keen as a serpent of fire and evoking in his need out of the invisible
the vision of a white Knight mounted on a white horse, from which he
dealt arch-natural destruction. In baptism, with the others who elected
to be redeemed out of Sarras, he assumed the name of Nasciens, as if in
a new generation he had been

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

received into the *militia crucifera evangelica*, with a mission to
enter the West and preach the Gospel with his sword. Seraphe was the
son-in-law of Evalach the king--a large man, strong-boned and
broad-shouldered. Great and many were the miracles which brought him by
slow stages to the Isles of Britain, but I will speak only of his
sojourn on the Turning Island, from which he was rescued by that Mystic
Ship of Solomon which fills so important an office in the *Quest of
Galahad*.

Nasciens watched the vessel coming to him fast over the sea; it was
richer than any other in the world, but no one was visible therein. He
prepared to go on board, when he saw golden letters in the Chaldaic
tongue giving warning that those who entered must be full of faith and
clean in every respect. He was deterred at first, but after fervent
prayer he entered, believing that it had been sent by God. He found
therein a mysterious couch, having at its head a crown of gold and at
the foot a marvellous sword, which was drawn ten inches out of the
scabbard. Connected with the bed there were three spindles of strange
colourings, though not as the result of artificial tincture; one was
red, another white, and the third green. The story of the Ship is
recounted at great length, and to express it as shortly as possible, the
royal prophet of Israel had learned by a message from heaven that the
last knight of his lineage would exceed all other chivalry as the sun
outshines the moon. By the sage counsel of his wife, he built this ship
to last for 4000 years, with the double object of making known to
Galahad not only the royalty of his descent, but the fact that the wise
king was aware of his birth in due time. The building was accomplished
in six months, and then the Queen told him to provide King David's sword
as an arm of might for his descendant. It was adorned with a new handle,
pommel and sheath--all of great virtues--and a writing about it said
that no man should draw it with impunity, save one who passed all others
in prowess and perfection of virtue.

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Solomon would have
also provided rich hangings, but was deterred by his wife, who testified
that they must be foul and of her own making, till another woman should,
in the coming time, provide draperies that were glorious. The high
office was reserved therefore for the most fair, faithful and unearthly
sister of Perceval. In this connection, I may say that one of the
side-problems of the whole narrative is that in spite of the wonderful
counsel which Solomon receives from his wife, and in spite of the
sacred, exalted meaning attached to the ship which was built by her
directions, she is described as a woman who had deceived him and had
embittered him regarding her sex.

The wooden bed seen by Nasciens was also placed in the Ship, and the
sword was laid thereon as well as the crown, which was also that of
David. By the same unaccountable directions the three spindles were of
wood derived from the Tree of Knowledge in the manner here following.
Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit; the apple which she gathered
brought with it a branch; the fruit was separated by Adam and the branch
remained with Eve, who preserved it in their exile as a memorial of her
misfortune. It was planted by her and became a great tree, which--both
within and without--was white as snow. One day, when they were seated
beneath it lamenting their unfortunate condition, Eve called it the Tree
of Death, but .a voice bade them comfort one another, for life was much
nearer than death--whereupon they termed it by substitution the Tree of
Life. They planted cuttings thereof, which grew and flourished; these
were white like the parent tree, but after the conception of Abel they
all turned green, bearing flowers and fruit. It was under the first tree
that Abel was murdered--when it changed from green to red and no longer
bore flowers or fruit; in later times it was called the Tree of Counsel
and of Comfort.

When the Ship was fully garnished, Solomon placed a letter beneath the
crown, giving warning to his descendant

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

against the wiles of women and asking to be held in his remembrance; he
recounted also the building. The Ship was launched; the king saw in a
vision how a great company of angels descended and entered therein, as
it sailed far out of sight.

Nasciens learned further that the Ship typified the Holy Church of
Christ, and as the latter has only faith and truth therein, so in its
symbol no faithless men could have part; confession and repentance were
necessary qualifications to enter Church or Ship. The inscriptions in
the Vessel were Holy Scripture; in a word, as the text suggested, it was
a symbol rather than a ship. The sea over which it sailed signified the
world; the bed was the Holy Altar, on which the Divine Son is
consecrated and offered daily; in another sense, it was also the Cross
of Christ. The white spindle meant Christ's virginity, the red one His
humility and love, while the green one signified His patience.

So far as regards the Ship of Solomon, and in respect of Nasciens
himself, before closing his story, I must speak of two visitations which
befell him. Soon after his conversion he was filled with the same desire
to know the Mysteries of the Graal for which Mordrains paid afterwards
so heavily and yet was so well recompensed; he raised up the paten which
covered the Sacred Vessel and by his own account he beheld the
foundations of knowledge and religion, the beginning of all bounty and
all gentility. We may remember here the old poet who said that Christ
was "The first true gentleman that ever breathed"; and doubtless the
sacramental mystery is also a mystery of courtesy. Nasciens was blinded
for his presumption and remained in this affliction till the healing of
Joseph II. from the wounding of the angel. His second visitation
occurred on board the Ship of Solomon, wherein he had been united with
his son and subsequently with King Mordrains. To the latter he showed
the Sword of David, but when the King took it in his hands the weapon
broke in two pieces and rejoined

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

as suddenly. At this moment they were warned to leave the Ship, and in
the act of obeying Nasciens was wounded grievously between the shoulders
by the Sword. He regarded this as a chastisement in loving-kindness for
his sins, but the episode is made more intelligible by another codex,
which shows how he was tempted to draw the Sword from its sheath and use
it as his defence against a giant when no other weapon was available. It
broke in the mere brandishing and so remained, but it was rejoined,
unaccountably enough, by the handling of Mordrains. Towards the close of
the story, a certain King Varlans too finds the Sword of David in the
Ship of Solomon and uses it to slay Lambor, who was one of the twelve
sons of Brons and at that time Keeper of the Graal. There followed great
sorrow and suffering in the lands of both rulers; both were ruined by
the stroke; and Varlans, on restoring the weapon to the Ship and therein
sheathing it, fell down dead. It will be seen that a kind of enchantment
thus befalls these parts of Britain, though the *Book of the Holy Graal*
is rather the cycle of adventures than that of enchantments. The Sword
was to remain sheathed until drawn by a maiden--that is to say, by the
sister of Perceval.

There is another story of a sword which belongs properly to a different
branch of the romance, but it may be mentioned in this place. Joseph of
Arimathæa is wounded, as usual, in the thigh by a false steward, leaving
half of the sword in the wound. With the upper half Joseph heals a
Saracen Knight, whom he has converted newly, and then uses it to
withdraw the point from his own flesh; it comes out unstained by blood,
and Joseph foretells that the two parts shall not be joined together
till he arrives who shall end the adventures of the Graal. This is the
Hallow which is resoldered by Galahad at Corbenic when the Holy Quest
has ended.

So far as Nasciens is concerned the remainder of the story deals more
especially with his deeds of valour in connection with the conversion of
Britain, which he

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

reached at length by ship and was instrumental in bringing over those
who had been left on the further shore by reason of their departure from
grace. His death took place prior to that of the second Joseph, and he
was buried in the abbey of white monks where Mordrains awaited his end.

Celidoine, the son of Nasciens, is in one sense a lesser character, but
in the symbolism of the story he seems to stand for something that is
important. He is said to have been born under the happiest of starry
influences and was himself a reader of the stars, from which he drew
presages and on one occasion ensured a Christian victory in consequence.
The meaning of his name itself is explained to be the Gift of Heaven.
One day Mordrains had a vision concerning him, and therein he was
represented by a lake, into which Christ came and washed His hands and
feet. This signified that God visited Celidoine daily because of his
good thoughts and actions. Nine streams issued from the lake, typifying
the boy's descendants. Into eight of them Christ also passed and made a
similar lustration. Now the ninth was troubled at the beginning--foul
even and turbulent--but in the middle it was translucent as a jewel and
at the mouth more sweet and pleasant than thought can picture. Before
entering this stream Christ laid aside all His vestments and was
immersed wholly--that is to say, in the good works of Galahad. The
troubled source signified the stain on that knight by reason of his
conception, and the removal of the vestments meant that Christ would
discover to the *haut prince* all his mysteries, permitting him in fine
to penetrate the entire secrets of the Graal.

The external life of Celidoine, who reached Britain by himself in a
boat, does not concern us except in broadest outline. As his father
wrought with the sword of earthly knighthood in the cause of Christ, so
did the son fight with the sword of the spirit--that is to say, with the
tongue of eloquence, and paynim clerks and sages could not withstand
him. Among many others he

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

converted the Persian King Label and was married to his daughter. As he
was a prodigy from the beginning and was knighted in his eighth year, he
is comparable to a sanctified Merlin.

One section of the romance which certainly calls to be included among
the major branches, and may even be considered by some as important of
all, has been reserved here till the last, and this is the permanent
House of the Holy Graal. During the keepership of Joseph II. the Vessel,
and the Ark which contained it, shared in the travels of the apostolate,
but it found a place of rest during the reign of his successor--who was
Alain, as we shall learn later. With a hundred companions he had
proceeded to the realm of Forayne, where the King was a knight of worth,
but a paynim and also a leper. He inquired whence his visitors came, and
was told from Jerusalem; he asked further whether his disease could be
cured, and was assured that it was more than possible if he forsook the
evil law and became a Christian. To this the King consented, and after
his conversion and baptism he was healed by the sight of the Graal, this
being the only occasion on which the Vessel was shown to a stranger. It
is important also to note that though Alain was the Keeper of the
Hallows, he was not an ordained priest and he employed one for the
purpose of baptizing. It follows, therefore, that the episcopal
functions of Joseph II. did not devolve on his successor, and it is
certain also that there was no sacerdotal character attributed to the
still later wardens--or, among others, to King Pelles, who was the
Keeper in the days of Galahad. The new convert was christened Alphasan,
and he proposed to build a castle for the reception of the Graal, to
marry his daughter to Joshua, the brother of Alain, and to make him the
heir of his kingdom, if the Graal remained therein. Hereto Alain
consented; the castle was built; and at its completion they found an
instruction emblazoned in red letters on one of the gates, saying that
it should be called Corbenic, the meaning of which, as we

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

know, is the Treasury of the Holy Vessel. This is on the authority of
the text and it is not an unreasonable persuasion to believe that the
author knew what he intended to convey by the word which he seems to
have compounded; but as it has not given universal satisfaction we have
variants, of which some are as follows: Carbonek = Caer Banawc--the
Castle of the Corners, or the Square Castle, but this has nothing to
commend it; Corbenic = *De Corpore Benedicto*, which is high phantasy,
but is charming in that sense; Cor-arbenig = the Sovereign Chair, which
is perfect past all desiring if the House of the Graal was the seat of a
secret doctrine.

The Holy Vessel was placed in a fair chamber, as if on an Altar of
Repose, and on the next Sunday Joshua was married to the King's
daughter. His coronation also took place, and in the feast which
followed the company was replenished by the grace of the Graal with all
manner of delicacies. That same night the King made the fatal mistake of
sleeping in the palace which he had built, and he awakened to witness a
Mass of the Graal, celebrated in his room apparently. It was, I suppose,
at the term of the service that the Vessel is said to have been removed
suddenly, and there appeared one wearing the likeness of humanity but
composed as if it were of flame. He upbraided the King for reposing in a
House so holy as that where the Vessel was worshipped, and as a warning
to all who should come after he smote him through both thighs with a
sword. The sword was withdrawn, the figure vanished, and Alphasan died
ten days afterwards. It was in this way, and at first by the voice of
the victim, that Corbenic came to be called the Palace of Adventure;
many knights attempted to sleep therein subsequently, but they were
always found dead in the morning, one strong hero of Arthur's chivalry
excepted, and he suffered for it otherwise.
