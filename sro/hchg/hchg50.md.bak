### IX

#### THE WELSH QUEST OF GALAHAD

It is considered that this translation, which is referable to the early
part of the fifteenth century, was made from another codex than that
which was used by Malory for the *Morte d’Arthur*, but it embodied
material from the *Book of the Holy Graal*, which may mean that the
anonymous author of the rendering was either the compiler

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

of a harmony or the simple translator of a manuscript corresponding to
the texts followed by Dr. Furnivall in his edition of the *Quest*. At
the same time, outside all evidences of mistranslation, the Welsh
version of the Quest itself differs unquestionably in several
particulars from all codices which are known to scholarship, and it
seems quite certain that the variations are not those of invention. On
the one hand, there is a certain slight attenuation of the mystic
atmosphere, though the general features remain; for example, that
enhanced knowledge of one another which is attributed to the knights who
saw the Holy Vessel, under the veils thereof, at the King's table, is
unmentioned in the Welsh text. Alternatively, there are other respects
in which there is an added disposition to lean on the spiritual side of
things, and this is manifested plainly in a few crucial cases. The Table
of the Lord's Supper is described as that which fed the body and the
soul with heavenly food, while the Graal itself is said to provide a
spiritual nourishment, which is sent by the Holy Ghost to him who seeks
in grace to sit at the table thereof. The close connection between the
Sacred Vessel and the office of the Divine Spirit--which is so evident
in the metrical romance of De Borron--is also apparent, and one who is
on the quest is told that by falling into sin he will fail to see that
Spirit, even as Lancelot failed. Outside those wanderings of the Holy
Graal which are recorded in the French texts, there are references to
its manifestation at sundry places in Logres--or there more especially,
but not there to the exclusion of all other countries. Finally as to
this part, I recognise a note of undeclared mystery as regards the House
of the Hallows. There was the permanent shrine of the Holy Vessel, but
whether it was visible always to those who dwelt within or at certain
times and seasons is not apparent, and remains indeed doubtful on the
evidence of all the literature. It is therefore open to question whether
it was the daily nourishment of the House, or whether its varied
ministry

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

was contingent on the arrival of a stranger who was prepared so far
sufficiently that he was admitted within the gates. It was the latter
probably, because Lancelot rested there for four days; but it was not
until the fifth day, and then in the midst of the supper, that the Graal
appeared and filled all with the meats most loved by them.

The Welsh Quest, like its prototype of Northern France, draws then from
the *Book of the Holy Graal*, but not from one of those codices with
which we have been made acquainted so far by the pains of scholarship.
For example, the account of the Second Table is given with specific
variations, though there is nothing to justify their enumeration in this
place, except that the son of Joseph is said to have occupied the seat
which corresponded to that of Christ, and no one ventured to take it
after him. It was not so occupied in the parent historical text, and we
know, of course, that the Siege Perilous in other presentations of the
legend is that of Judas Iscariot.

What appears to be the Dolorous Stroke in the Welsh Quest is exceedingly
involved, but the account is as follows: (*a*) King Lambor was father of
the Lame King, and was at war with King Urlain, formerly a Saracen.
(*b*) Lambor was forced to flight, and in doing so reached the seashore,
where he found the Ship of Solomon. (*c*) He took up the Sword therein
and smote Urlain, so that he and his horse were cut in two pieces. This
occurred in England, and was the first blow that was ever given with the
weapon. (*d*) The King who was slain is said to have been so holy that
great vengeance was taken by God for that blow. (*e*) In neither kingdom
for a long time was there found any fruit, everything being dried up, so
that the land is called to this day the Decayed Kingdom. It will be seen
that this is in direct contradiction to the particulars in the *Book of
the Holy Graal* concerning the death of Lambor, the keeper at that time
of the Sacred Vessel. It follows also that the story of Balyn and Balan
was unknown to the Welsh translator.

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

The Lame King was the Uncle of Perceval, and so good was his manner of
living that his like could not be found in the world. One day he was
hunting, and came to the seashore, where he also found the ship. In
spite of the warning written therein, he entered without fear, and drew
the Sword partly from the scabbard. He was struck by a spear in the
thigh, and was maimed from that time forward. In the French *Quest of
Galahad* this episode is attributed to King Pelles.

As an illustration of general intention prevailing through the Welsh
Quest, a hermit reminds Gawain that the dignity of knighthood was
conferred upon him--among other things--for the defence of the Church,
and as this specific statement is part only of the general atmosphere
through which the romance moves, it is itself an eloquent comment on the
alleged underlying hostility to official ecclesiasticism which is
sometimes traced in the literature. The condition of Wales at the time
of the Quest, as it is depicted in the Welsh text, is not an encouraging
report regarding the last stronghold of the Celtic Church, but it is
possible that the worst particulars are things which the translator has
interpolated.

Whether in their agreement or variation, the details of the story do not
call to be scheduled here, but there are a few points which may be noted
with all brevity. Galahad is described as the foster-child of the abbey
where Lancelot finds him, and he is commanded to watch his arms prior to
receiving knighthood. He is introduced at the Court of King Arthur as
the desired Knight descended from the line of the prophet David and
Joseph of Arimathæa: on him rest all the adventures and wonders of Great
Britain and all countries. He is called the son of the daughter of King
Pelles, but the later story speaks invariably of the Graal Castle as
that of King Pelour, whom I should identify as the maimed and abdicated
Keeper who was healed by Galahad in the French version, of which,
however, there is no mention in. the Welsh Quest. The manifested
festival of the

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Graal in the hall
of Arthur is heralded by an unknown messenger--a lady vested in white on
a white palfrey, who gives warning concerning its advent, and this is
found also in Malory's version, but he follows a defective text, for in
him the prophecy is uttered after the event itself. So great are the
delicacies at the table, by the provision of the Sacred Vessel, so much
are they dwelt on in the Welsh version, that the resolution of the
knights in respect of the coming Quest has the aspect of material
appetite, and they resolve not to rest till they can eat at another
table where they will be fed as rarely. According to Gawain, there is no
such place on earth except the Court of King Peleur. When the Quest is
thus undertaken Galahad says nothing. All this is an accident of aspect,
for elsewhere it is stated (*a*) that no one shall see the Holy Graal
except through the gate which is called Confession, and this is
obviously the gate of the Eucharist; (*b*) that the final return of Bors
was designed to exhibit the spirituality of that good which at the last
end of things was lost by so many on account of their sins.

The time comes when Galahad swears upon the relics with the others to
maintain the Quest, and, apart from this position--which has not been
understood by scholarship--there are episodes and intimations which seem
intended to show that the natural child of the sanctuary was not
permitted to know all--though he had that which was implied in his
heirship--until, in common with the others, he undertook the great
enterprise. The Knights proceeded on their journey weeping and in great
sorrow--that is to say, with failing hearts, foreboding the
discounselling of so many and all the disaster coming after: *Euntes
ibant et flebant*.

There is one reference to Eleazar, the son of King Pelles, and one to a
Knight named Argus, who, by an unthinkable confusion, is said to be the
son of Helayne, as if this daughter of the House had married or begotten
subsequently. The hermit Nasciens, whose identity is so important for
the *Book of the Holy Graal*, is described

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

as the son-in-law of Evalach, instead of his brother by marriage, as he
appears in the extant text. He is found; on one occasion by Gawain in a
very poor cell or hermitage, with a small chapel attached.

When the questing Knights arrive at the Graal Castle, it is not said
that they see either Pelles or Peleur, nor are these or Eleazar present
at the manifestation of the Holy Graal. The maiden who remains in the
text of Malory is also bidden to depart, following in this respect the
chief French manuscripts. He who comes down from Heaven as the first
Bishop of Christendom is distinguished rightly from Joseph of Arimathæa,
and is therefore the second Joseph. When he celebrates the secret mass
of the Graal, he takes out a wafer from the Vessel, which shows that it
was used as a ciborium. In the divine discourse thereafter, it is said
by Christ that many a good man has come to the Castle through the grace
of the Holy Ghost. As regards the nine mysterious Knights who are not to
accompany the three on their journey to Sarras, the parting of those
with these takes place amidst great brotherhood, and each of them says
who he is, but the nine are not named in the text. Galahad asks them to
salute Arthur if they go to his Court, and they reply that they shall do
so gladly, but they do not say that they will go. Probably they went
back by another way into their own countries.

Now, these are the chief points which I promised to set forth; and there
is one thing more only--that the Spear was not taken to Sarras, nor was
it removed to Heaven with the Sacred Vessel. In conclusion as to the
*Quest of Galahad*, the presence of that maiden who was niece of King
Pelles at the great vision of the Graal seems without authority in
extant French texts; it is therefore peculiar to Malory and the version
which he followed. If it were possible to trace the variations of the
Quest through developments of the Tristram cycle, we should meet with
very curious details, but they are not necessary to our subject.
