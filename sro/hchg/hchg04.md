#### SOME ASPECTS OF THE GRAAL LEGEND

THE study of a great literature should begin like the preparation for a
royal banquet, not without some solicitude for right conduct in the
King's palace--which is the consecration of motive--and not without
recollection of that source from which the most excellent gifts derive
in their season to us all. We may, therefore, in approaching it say:
*Benedic, Domine, nos et hæc tua dona, quæ de tua largitate sumus
sumpturi*.

But in respect of the subject which concerns us we may demand even more
appropriately: *Mensæ cœlestis participes faciat nos, Rex æternæ
gloriæ*. In this way we shall understand not only the higher meaning of
the Feeding-Dish, but the gift of the discernment of spirits, the place
and office of the supersubstantial bread, and other curious things of
the worlds within and without of which we shall hear in their order.
Surely the things of earth are profitable to us only in so far as they
assist us towards the things which are eternal. In this respect there
are many helpers, even as the sands of the sea. The old books help us,
perhaps above all things, and among them the old chronicles and the
great antique legends. If the hand of God is in history, it is also in
folk-lore. We can scarcely fail of our term, since lights, both close at
hand and in the unlooked-for places, kindle everywhere about us. It is
difficult to say any longer that we walk in the shadow of death when the
darkness is sown with stars.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Now there are a few legends which may be said to stand forth among the
innumerable traditions of humanity, wearing the external signs and
characters of some inward secret or mystery which belongs rather to
eternity than to time. They are in no sense connected one with
another--unless, indeed, by certain roots which are scarcely in time and
place--and yet by a suggestion which is deeper than any message of the
senses each seems appealing to each, one bearing testimony to another,
and all recalling all. They kindle strange lights, they awaken dim
memories, in the antecedence of an immemorial past. They might be the
broken fragments of some primitive revelation which, except in these
memorials, has passed out of written records and from even the horizon
of the mind. There are also other legends--strange, melancholy and long
haunting--which seem to have issued from the depths of aboriginal
humanity, below all horizons of history, pointing, as we' might think,
to terrible periods of a past which is of the body only, not of the soul
of man, and hinting that once upon a time there was a soulless age of
our race, when minds were formless as the mammoths of geological epochs.
To the latter class belongs part of what remains to us from the
folk-lore of the cave-dwellers, the traditions of the pre-Aryan races of
Europe. To the former, among many others, belongs the Graal legend,
which in all its higher aspects is to be classed among the legends of
the soul. Perhaps I should more worthily say that when it is properly
understood, and when it is regarded at the highest, the Graal is not a
legend, but an episode in the æonian life of that which "cometh from
afar"; it is a personal history.

The mystery of the Graal is a word which came forth out of Galilee. The
literature which enshrines this mystery, setting forth the circumstances
of its origin, the several quests which were instituted on account of
it, the circumstances under which it was

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

from time to time discovered, and, in fine, its imputed removal, with
all involved thereby, is one of such considerable dimensions that it may
be properly described as large. This notwithstanding, there is no
difficulty in presenting its broad outlines, as they are found in the
texts which remain, so briefly that if there be any one who is new to
the subject, he can be instructed sufficiently for my purpose even from
the beginning. It is to be understood, therefore, that the Holy Graal,
considered in its Christian aspects and apart from those of folk-lore,
is represented invariably, excepting in one German version of the
legend, as that vessel in which Christ celebrated the Last Supper or
consecrated for the first time the elements of the Eucharist. It is,
therefore, a sacramental vessel, and, according to the legend, its next
use was to receive the blood from the wounds of Christ when His body was
taken down from the Cross, or, alternatively, from the side which was
pierced by the spear of Longinus. Under circumstances which are
variously recounted, this vessel, its content included, was carried
westward in safe guardianship--coming, in fine, to Britain and there
remaining in the hands of successive keepers, or, this failing, in the
hands of a single keeper, whose life was prolonged through the
centuries. In the days of King Arthur, the prophet and magician Merlin
assumed the responsibility of carrying the legend to its term, with
which object he brought about the institution of the Round Table, and
the flower of Arthurian chivalry set out to find the Sacred Vessel. In
some of the quests which followed, the knighthood depicted in the
greater romances has become a mystery of ideality, and nothing save its
feeble reflection could have been found on earth. The quests were to
some extent preconceived in the mind of the legend, and, although a few
of them were successful, that which followed was the removal of the Holy
Graal. The Companions of the Quest asked, as one may say, for

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

bread, and to those who were unworthy there was given the stone of their
proper offence, but to others the spiritual meat which passes all
understanding. That this account instructs the uninitiated person most
imperfectly will be obvious to any one who is acquainted with the great
body of the literature, but, within the limits to which I have
restricted it intentionally, I do not know that if it were put
differently it would be put better or more in harmony with the general
sense of the romances.

It might appear at first sight almost a superfluous precaution, even in
an introductory part, to reply so fully as I have now done to the
assumed question: What, then, was the Holy Graal? Those who are
unacquainted with its literature in the old books of chivalry, through
which it first entered into the romance of Europe, will know it by the
*Idylls of the King*. But it is not so superfluous as it seems, more
especially with the class which I am addressing, since nominally this
has other concerns, like folk-lore scholarship, and many answers to the
question made from distinct points of view would differ from that which
is given by the Knight Perceval to his fellow-monk in the poem of
Tennyson:--

                            "What is it?  
The phantom of a cup which comes and goes?--  
Nay, monk! What phantom? answered Perceval.  
The cup, the cup itself, from which our Lord  
Drank at the last sad supper with his own.  
This, from the blessed land of Aromat . . .  
Arimathæan Joseph, journeying brought  
To Glastonbury. . . .  
And there awhile it bode; and if a man  
Could touch or see it, he was heal’d at once,  
By faith, of all his ills. But then the times  
Grew to such evil that the holy cup  
Was caught away to Heaven and disappear’d."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This is the answer
with which, in one or another of its forms, poetic or chivalrous, every
one is expected

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

to be familiar, or he must be classed as too unlettered for
consideration, even in such a slight sketch as these introductory words.
But it is so little the only answer, and it is so little full or
exhaustive, that no person acquainted with the archaic literature would
accept it otherwise than as one of its aspects, and even the enchanting
gift of Tennyson's poetic faculty leaves--and that of
necessity--something to be desired in the summary of the Knight's reply
to the direct question of Ambrosius. Those even who at the present day
discourse of chivalry are not infrequently like those who say "Lord,
Lord!"--but for all that they do not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven or
the more secret realms of literature. And this obtains still more
respecting the chivalry of the Graal. In the present case something of
the quintessential spirit has in an obscure manner evaporated. There is
an allusiveness, a pregnancy, a suggestion about the old legend in its
highest forms: it is met with in the old romances, and among others in
the longer prose chronicle of Perceval le Gallois, but more fully in the
great prose Quest, which is of Galahad, the *haut prince*. A touch of it
is found later in Tennyson's own poem, when Perceval's sister, the nun
of " utter whiteness," describes her vision:--

                    "I heard a sound  
As of a silver horn from o'er the hills. . . .  
                      The slender sound  
As from a distance beyond distance grew  
Coming upon me. . . .  
                                     And then  
Stream’d thro’ my cell a cold and silver beam,  
And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail,  
Rose-red with beatings in it."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And again:--

I saw the spiritual city and all her spires  
And gateways in a glory like one pearl. . . .  
Strike from the sea; and from the star there shot  
A rose-red sparkle to the city, and there  
Dwelt, and I knew it was the Holy Grail."

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> So also in the
chivalry books the legend is treated with an aloofness, and yet with a
directness of circumstance and a manifoldness of detail, awakening a
sense of reality amidst enchantment which is scarcely heightened when
the makers of the chronicles testify to the truth of their story. The
explanation is, according to one version of the legend, that it was
written by Christ Himself after the Resurrection, and that there is no
clerk, however hardy, who will dare to suggest that any later scripture
is referable to the same hand. Sir Thomas Malory, the last and greatest
compiler of the Arthurian legend, suppresses this hazardous ascription,
and in the colophon of his seventeenth book is contented with adding
that it is "a story chronicled for one of the truest and the holyest
that is in thys world."

But there is ample evidence no further afield than Sir Thomas Malory's
own book, the *Morte d’Arthur*, that the Graal legend was derived into
his glorious codification from various sources, and that some elements
entered into it which are quite excluded by the description of Sir
Perceval in the *Idylls* or by the colophon of Malory's own twelfth
book, which reads: "And here foloweth the noble tale of the Sancgreal,
that called is the hooly vessel, and the sygnefycacyon of the blessid
blood of our Lord Jhesu Cryste, blessid mote it be, the whiche was
brought in to this land by Joseph of Armathye, therefor, on al synful
souls blessid Lord haue thou mercy."

As an equipoise to the religious or sentimental side of the legend, it
is known, and we shall see in its place, that the Graal cycle took over
something from Irish and Welsh folk-lore of the pagan period concerning
a mysterious magical vessel full of miraculous food. This is illustrated
by the *Morte d’Arthur*, in the memorable episode of the high festival
held by King Arthur at Pentecost: in the midst of the supper "there
entred in to the halle the Holy Graal couered with whyte samyte, but
ther was none mighte see hit nor who bare hit. And

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

there was al the halle fulfylled with good odoures, and euery knyzt had
suche metes and drynkes as he loved best in this world." That is a state
of the legend which has at first sight little connection with the mystic
vessel carried out of Palestine, whether by Joseph or another, but
either the simple-minded chroniclers of the past did not observe the
anachronism when they married a Christian mystery to a cycle of
antecedent fable, or there is an explanation of a deeper kind, in which
case we shall meet with it at a later stage of our studies. For the
moment, and as an intimation only, let me say that the study of
folk-lore may itself become a reverence of high research when it is
actuated by a condign motive.

We shall make acquaintance successively with the various entanglements
which render the Graal legend perhaps the most embedded of all cycles. I
have said that the Sacred Vessel is sacramental in a high degree; it
connects intimately with the Eucharist; it is the most precious of all
relics for all Christendom indifferently, for, supposing that it were
manifested at this day, I doubt whether the most rigid of the Protestant
sects could do otherwise than bow down before it. And yet, at the same
time, the roots of it lie deep in folklore of the pre-Christian period,
and in this sense it is a dish of plenty, with abundance for an eternal
festival. So also, from another point of view, it is not a cup but a
stone, and it would have come never to this earth if it had not been for
the fall of the angels. It is brought to the West; it is carried to the
East again; it is assumed into heaven; it is given to a company of
hermits; for all that we know to the contrary, it is at this day in
Northumbria; it is in the secret temple of a knightly company among the
high Pyrenees; and it is in the land of Presbyter Johannes. It is like
the cup of the elixir and the stone of transmutation in
alchemy--described in numberless ways and seldom after the same manner;
but it seems to be one thing under its

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

various ways, and blessed are those who find it. We shall learn, in
fine, that the Graal was either a monastic legend or at least that it
was super-monastic--and this certainly.
