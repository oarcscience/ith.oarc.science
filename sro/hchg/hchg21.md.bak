### IX

#### THE ENCHANTMENTS OF BRITAIN, THE TIMES CALLED ADVENTUROUS AND THE WOUNDING OF THE KING

The *Longer Prose Perceval* says that the great and secret sanctuary
gives upon the Earthly Paradise, even as the visible world may be said
to give upon the world unseen--a comparison which would signify for
us--or at least by a suggestion to the mind--that the Temple of the
Hallows and all its external splendour are the adornment of the soul
which is within. Even apart from such a reading, we can understand that
the manner of doctrine put forward evasively in story-books by the Graal
literature, was sufficient to make the orthodox church stand aloof, but
vigilant and dubious. We have

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

now to consider how a horror fell upon the Secret House of God and a
subtle work of sorcery on the world which encompassed it. All texts
indifferently of the Northern French cycles say that, as a consequence
of certain events connected with the Castle of the Graal, there fell an
interdiction upon Logres. In the Lesser Chronicles it is termed an
Enchantment, while in the Greater Chronicles it is characterised as
Adventurous Times, but the distinctions dissolve into one another; there
is not less adventure, nor is it less hazardous, in the texts of
enchantment, while in the adventurous texts the graces and terrors of
sorcery abound on every side. We can therefore consider them together,
as aspects of the same subject which are scarcely so much as
alternative, and, in fact, on the study of the documents it will be
found that the adventurous times are almost too vague by themselves to
admit of being specified separately. As regards the enchantments, they
are a consequence which works outward from within--that is to say,
directly or indirectly, something which has transpired within is
responsible for the inhibition without. The enchantments are the result
of an evil which has fallen on the keeper for the time being of the Holy
Graal. They are the exteriorised sorrow of the king. The action is,
however, reciprocal, for in some instances that sorrow has reached him
by an intrusion of the external order, though in certain other cases it
has arisen in his own house or in his own person. It remains that as
enchantment fell upon Merlin, so also it has fallen about the Secret
House and has entered into the Holy of Holies. Now, the places of
enchantment are also places of sadness, and the nature of the horror
within, abiding as a certain cloud upon the sanctuary, is described
after several manners. In one story, the flesh, which at no time profits
anything, has smitten deeply into the life of the Keeper, who has been a
victim of earthly passion. In another, he is unable to die till he has
seen the last scion of his

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

house, and because of the protraction of the centuries, he is suffering,
in the meantime, the heavy burden of his great age. He has alternatively
received a dolorous stroke, reacting on him from the person of one of
his relatives; and as a final explanation he is afflicted by the failure
of a knight to ask the conventional question, which is at once vital and
mystic. These things are reflected upon the order without, sometimes, as
it would seem, only in the immediate neighbourhood of the Castle; more
generally through the whole of Logres; while in rare instances the world
itself is involved, at least by imputation.

The Perceval Quests turn entirely on the asking of that question which I
have specified in the previous enumeration, and the pivot of the
question itself is the failure to perform what is expected in this
respect--namely, to ask and to receive. In the Chrétien section of the
*Conte del Graal* the explanation of the king's sickness is that he was
wounded by a spear in battle and hence is carried by four sergeants
because he has no strength. in his bones. In the *Didot Perceval* Brons,
the Rich Fisherman, is said to be in great infirmity, an old man and
full of maladies, nor will his health be restored until the office of
the question has been fulfilled in all perfection. But this is not
ordinary old age; rather--as I have just intimated--it is the oppression
of many centuries. It is clear, however, that Brons was not suffering
from any curse or enchantment; he cannot depart from this life until he
has communicated to Perceval the secret words pronounced at the
sacrament of the Graal, which he himself learned from Joseph. This and
the instruction which will follow the question asked by the hero shall
put a period to the enchantments of Britain. There is a failure in the
first instance, as in the poem of Chrétien, and the Quest in the *Conte
del Graal* is to some extent assumed by Gawain, who visits the Graal
Castle in the continuation of Gautier; he does ask, and thereupon the
king promises

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

him that, subject to one other condition, he shall hear the great story
of the Broken  Sword and of the woe which it brought upon the kingdom of
Logres--but Gawain fails and falls asleep. The failure of Perceval has
worked the destruction of kingdoms, which may mean certain petty
principalities of Britain passing under this name--otherwise they cannot
have been of this world, as the prophecy does not come to pass here. On
the occasion of Perceval's second visit, the king is seated on a couch
as before, and the discourse is not closed in the section of Gautier.
The conclusion of Manessier recounts how the Broken Sword dealt that
stroke which, prior to the voided question, has destroyed the realm of
Logres and all the surrounding country. The unfinished inquiry of
Gawain, before he fell into slumber, restored verdure to the land about
the Graal Castle and the waters found their course. It was not, however,
the keeper but his brother who received the Dolorous Stroke, being slain
treacherously in a battle. The sword, which broke in the act, was placed
upon the bier when the body was brought to the Castle; it was taken up
incautiously by the king and in some undeclared manner it wounded him in
both thighs; this wound could not be healed till the death of his
brother was avenged. For these events the late prologue to the *Conte
del Graal* substitutes a desolation which fell upon Logres prior to the
coming of King Arthur. There were certain maidens who kept the wells and
ministered refreshment to travellers out of golden cups. So admirable as
was this custom, an evil king despoiled the maidens and scattered them,
after which the service ceased. The elements of the prologue stand apart
from the rest of the literature, like an allegory in another tongue; and
though it is very curious in itself, it connects with nothing which
follows in the texts that it is supposed to introduce.

The *Book of the Holy Graal*, like the metrical romance of De Borron,
antecedes the period alike of enchantments

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

and quests; but as, in its present form, it is later in fact than the
chronicles which it is supposed to precede, so, as a part of its
warrants, it forestalls many of their characteristics by a kind of
spurious prophecy. It tells how the younger Joseph, the second keeper of
the Graal, was smitten in the thighs by an angel for aiding certain
people who did not embrace Christianity, and it testifies that the
avenging spear with which the wounds were inflicted will be heard of
again at the beginning of those marvels that shall occur in the land of
Britain. In this manner it foreshadows the particular Dolorous Stroke of
which we have a full account in the *Huth Merlin* and all the sorrowful
adventures which follow therein. These are destined to continue for
twenty-two years, corresponding to the twenty-two days during which the
head of the Lance was embedded in the flesh of Joseph.

The *Vulgate Merlin* has nothing to say concerning the enchantments of
Britain, except that the prophet's skill and discretion were gifts
vouchsafed by God so that he might accomplish the adventures of the
Seynt Graal. That it was the rumour of the Sacred Vessel which
inaugurated the time of adventure is clear from this passage, as it is
also from the *Huth Merlin*, which speaks of a prophecy written by the
enchanter on parchment and concerned with those marvels which would
characterise the Quest, encompassing in fine the destruction of the
marvellous lion--that is to say, the overthrow of King Arthur. The
implicits of this statement are one *crux* of the Merlin cycle. It is
also, as I have intimated, to the *Huth Merlin* that we owe our
acquaintance with the beautiful story of Balyn and Balan, the two
brethren born in Northumberland, who were good knights, according to
Malory. Balyn was destined to inflict the Dolorous Stroke, which during
the allotted period of twenty-two years would cause dire distress
throughout three kingdoms, for by this stroke he would pierce the most
holy man in the world, and inaugurate the marvels of the Graal in Great
Britain.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> There can be no
doubt that the Warden of the Sacred Vessel is here the intended victim,
and that the stroke is actually given in the Graal Castle, with the
hallowed spear of the legend. Balyn himself nearly loses his life in the
cataclysm which follows, and is informed by Merlin that he has deserved
the hatred of the whole world, the obvious reason being that he has
desecrated the sanctuary. The recipient of the wound is, however, said
to be King Pellehan, who is the brother of King Pelles the Keeper. In
any chronological tabulation this event would most likely precede the
visit of Gawain to the Graal Castle and indubitably the first arrival of
Lancelot therein. These occurrences are related in the prose *Lancelot*,
but in this romance the Keeper of the Sacred Vessel is, as I have said,
King Pelles, and he is not wounded. Pellehan reappears in the *Quest of
Galahad* not only as the Maimed King, but as he who bears the title of
the Rich Fisher, which is reserved to the royalty of the Graal wardens.
It will be seen, therefore, that a certain confusion has arisen, owing
to continuous editing, and it may follow that there was originally but
one King in the Castle, that his name was Pelles, that he was wounded by
the Dolorous Stroke, and was destined to be healed by Galahad at the
term of the Quest. As it is, there is actually a dual healing--that of
the King Pellehan and that of another personage whose sin dates back to
the first times of the legend, being one of unprepared intrusion into
the most secret mysteries of the Graal. In the *Quest of Galahad* the
confusion which I have noticed is made greater by the story of Sir
Perceval's sister concerning the maiming of King Pelles, who found the
ship of Solomon towards the coast of Ireland. He entered therein and
drew the sword of David about half-way from its scabbard. In punishment
of this rashness a spear smote him through both thighs, and never since
might he be healed, says she, "to fore we come to hym." None of this
takes place actually, but it goes to show that the original

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

intention of the story was the intention of the Perceval quests--namely,
to wound the keeper of the Graal. Speaking otherwise of this great
romance, the whole process of the Quest is lifted into a high spiritual
region, the implicits of which will provide us at a later stage with one
key of the mystery.

In the *Longer Prose Perceval* it is said that there shall be no rest in
the land till the Graal has been achieved. But here the horror of the
house was the failure of Perceval to ask that question the simplicity of
which is the seal of the whole enigma. As a consequence, the shepherd
has been smitten and the sheep have been scattered. Those who ministered
in the Castle were sent out by the general fatality beyond the sacred
precincts, for no other reason apparently than to act as witnesses of
the woe abroad before the face of the world; and so, therefore, in place
of ceremonial pageants within, there are strange processions without.

In the German cycle, the adequate consideration of which must be
referred as before to a later stage, the *Parsifal* of Wolfram sets a
blot on the scutcheon by showing that sin entered the sanctuary, and in
this, as in other respects, the story is set apart from all else in the
general pageant of the literature. On the other hand, the poem of
Heinrich, though its root-matter is almost out of knowledge, conforms,
as it does usually, to the more normal tradition in points of detail,
saying that the doom of the king was the outcome of war between
brothers. With this, in other connections and a far other sense, we have
some analogy in the *Longer Prose Perceval*.

I believe that the implicits of the Graal keepers must rank among the
most important of those which remain for consideration in their place.
While they are connected more especially with the headship in the
persons of the successive Wardens, there are also subsidiary matters
which will arise in their proper order. Woe has fallen on the Wardens,
though, speaking symbolically, they abide in the place of life. Not only
is the hereditary

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

custodian of the secrets that person in most of the romances on whom
comes the symbolic grief, but he is dependent peculiarly on help
expected from without, and although his sustenance is within his healing
is beyond the sanctuary. Even such a sinner as Gawain can bring him a
partial consolation. He receives a nondescript savage like Perceval, as
he is depicted in the more primitive stories, within the fold of
election, for doing something after a clownish failure which any child
might have been expected to perform at once. All this is so out of
reason on the surface that a meaning in concealment seems inevitable.
Its investigation is reserved of necessity, but as something consistent
with the subject down the first vistas of which we are looking only, it
may be said, as the characteristic of every initiation, that the
candidate does not ask questions; it is he who is catechised and must
answer. One key from one point of view might again be the counsel: Ask,
and ye shall receive. But the Graal quester is to bestow before he
receives. The suggestion seems that if we are dealing with a rite which
follows a certain procedure, it is one which works rather the reverse
way, so far as other mysteries are concerned. That rite has been going
on for generations, inviting and accepting no candidate, for it is
perpetuated by hereditary transmission, though its treasury has been a
heritage of woe. There is no symbolical object in all the literature of
romance to compare with the secret guardianship, whether the keeper is
wounded for his own, or another's, and even for our transgressions;
whether also the consideration of his mystery arises from the texts
themselves or from suggestions belonging thereto and admitted from a
very high standpoint. No one could find the Castle, or come into the
presence of the king, except by a special warrant and sometimes by a
congenital election. The Castle was hidden from the world, like the
analogous House of the Holy Ghost in the Rosicrucian Mystery, and he who
entered therein had somehow to awaken the oracle. The

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

hidden life of the keepers passed in the Castle, but not in the
visionary rapture of those who go into Avalon and other isles of the
blessed. Now, there are two palmary mysteries connected with two
divisions of the Chronicles of Quest--one is the silence of Perceval and
the other is the conception of Galahad. By the way of anticipation
something more will be said of the first in the next section.
