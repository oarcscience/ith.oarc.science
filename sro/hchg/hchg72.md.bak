## SECRET TRADITION IN CHRISTIAN TIMES

### I

#### PRELIMINARY TO THE WHOLE SUBJECT

THOUGHT in the Middle Ages moved, like external science, through a world
of mystery, and the Christ-light moved through the mist-light filling
the bounds of sense with the shapes and symbols of vision. It follows,
and this naturally, that most things seemed possible at a period when
all things were dubious in respect of knowledge and apart from the power
of religion, which tinged life itself with the lesser elements of
ecstasy, there was the kind of enchantment which dwells always about the
precincts of unknown vistas. Apart also from the shapes of imagination,
there were the extravagances of minds seeking emancipation from law and
authority, more especially in the matters of faith. The Books of the
Holy Graal do not belong to the last category, but after their own
manner they are like echoes from far away, because even as the secrets
of the Greater Mysteries have not been written, and the Holy Assemblies
do not issue proceedings, so the higher life of sanctity and the
experiment towards that term, whether manifested in books of mystical
theology or in books of romance, reach only a partial expression. The
value of the Graal legends is like the value of other legends--I mean,
in the mind of the mystic at this day: it is resident in the suggestions
and the lights

which it can afford us for the maintenance of the great, implied
concordat which constitutes the Divine Alliance. Having found that we
are dealing with a body of writing which puts forth the rumour of
strange claims and suggests concealed meanings, having found also that
it is a literature which was acquired as if almost with a conscious
intention to develop these particular interests, and being desirous of
knowing the kind of intervention and the particular motives which were
at work, if this indeed be possible, we are naturally disposed to ask
whether there were other concealed literatures at the same period, and
what light--if any--they cast upon these questions. The great school of
Christian mystic thought within the official church was concerned wholly
with a mystery of sanctity, the term of which was identical with the
object that I have sought to put forward as the term of the Graal quest;
but it had no secret claim and no concealed motive. We cannot,
therefore, explain the one in a complete simplicity by the other, though
we know in a general sense that it was from the other that the one
issued. There were, however, independent schools of literature belonging
to the same period which do give us certain lights, because, in the last
resource, they did come, one and all, out of the same sanctuary; and it
is obviously reasonable to suppose that so far as there are difficulties
in the one path we may receive help from the collateral paths and thus
attain some better understanding of the whole. If a particular spirit or
secret mind, school or sodality, took over the old folk-lore legends,
infusing a new motive therein, which motive is akin to the purpose
discernible in coincident literatures, that which intervened in the one
case was probably in relation with the others. I propose, therefore, to
consider these extrinsic schools shortly, and to show that throughout a
number of centuries we can trace successively the same implicits, it
being understood that they are always put forward in a different way. In
this manner we shall come to

<span id="page_523">p. 523</span>

see that there have been several interventions, but taking place under
such circumstances that those who intervened may have been always the
same secret school, on the understanding that this school does not
correspond to a corporate institution and never spoke officially. It is
necessary, however, to deal in the first place with one attempt to
account for the Graal literature which has been already put forward,
because there are certain directions in which it is idle to look and it
is well to know concerning them. Prior to the settlement of this
preliminary question in the section that next follows, there is a
specific point that demands our attention at the moment, and it can be
stated in a few words. On the assumption that there has been a Secret
Tradition perpetuated through Christian times, the place of which is in
the West, it seems desirable to understand what part of it matters
vitally in respect of our own subject. There are several schools of
secret literature, and each of them, under its proper veil, has
perpetuated something belonging to its particular order. There are, for
example, the schools of magic, and it is these precisely that embody
nothing to our purpose; they constitute heresies of occult practice
which find their strict correlation in the external heresies of
doctrine, wherein also there is no light, as we shall see immediately.
If the resolution has not been made already, and that definitely, it is
time--and it is high time--that the whole domain of phenomenal occultism
should be transferred to the care of psychological science, with the
hope that it will pursue that path of research into the nature of man
and his environment which less accredited investigations of the past
have proved productive. They are no part of the mystic work and, having
regard to the extent of our preoccupations, it is fortunate that neither
approximately nor remotely do they enter into the subject of those
schools of thought, the remains of which may cast a certain light upon
the greater implicits of the Graal literature.
