##### § *F*.--IN WHICH SIR GAWAIN IS CONSIDERED BRIEFLY AS A COMPANION OF THE HOLY QUEST

There are three that give testimony on earth concerning the Mystery of
the Graal--Perceval, Bors and Galahad--and the greatest of these is
Galahad. This notwithstanding,

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

as there are persons who, through a certain mental deviation, turn aside
from the highways of Christendom and look for better paths, out of the
beaten track, in the issues of obscure heresy, so it has happened that
scholarship, without setting aside the great heroes of research, has
discovered some vague predilection for the adventurous and courtly Sir
Gawain. They have been led even to think that he was the first popular
hero of the Great Quest. If the evidence can be held as sufficient--and
it is tolerable in certain directions--I suppose that I should waste my
time by saying that it does not signify, any more than the preference of
Jewry for Barabbas rather than Christ could accredit the Jewish robber
with a valid or possible title. In order to strengthen the view,
scholarship has supposed certain speculative versions, now more lost
than regrettable, which present Gawain more fully as the quest-hero than
any document which is extant. In such event these versions were like the
poem of Chrétien de Troyes, as it was judged by Wolfram--that is to say,
they told the wrong story. At the same time there are several accessory
considerations which call for mention. Gawain was exactly the kind of
character who would be disposed to initiate and undertake all kinds of
quests, high and low. That he was a popular Graal hero might mean that
some of his chroniclers did not see exactly why his methods and mode of
life should create a barrier. It must be admitted also that for many
purposes of the Greater Mysteries it is possible that the merely
continent man requires a more express preparation than one of the
opposite tendency in certain cases. I think further that the old
romancists had in their minds a distinction between the continuity of
the sin in Lancelot and the sporadic misdemeanours of Gawain, as also
between the essential gravity of the particular offence in the two
contrasted instances. There is the fullest evidence of this in respect
of Guinevere, when considered side by side with other heroines of the
cycles. Moreover, the romances

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

reflected the unquestioned concensus of opinion at the period regarding
the barren woman, and it seems clear that the unfailing fidelity with
which plenary favours were granted by maidens in the matter of a
covenant fulfilled, and the frankness which permitted such favours to
rank as the term of reward, had its root in the sentiment that, except
in houses of religion, the womb which bore no fruit was under a greater
interdict than that which conceived without consecration by the sacred
offices of the Church. This must be remembered when the literature
suggests, as it will, that the chivalry of King Arthur's court
translated in an inverted manner the institutes of heaven; that it was
not very particular about marrying and giving in marriage; and that it
seemed to have assumed to itself an indulgence, both general and
particular, to follow the untinctured office of Nature without much
consciousness of a stigma attaching thereto. Finally, it is. just to add
that the later romances manifest a set purpose to depict Gawain in
blacker colours exceedingly than the earlier texts warrant.

For the rest, and from the mystic standpoint, it seems pertinent to say
that while there is no period at which it was customary on the part of
the Church to impose celibacy as an ideal on those who lived in the
world, and while from most of the higher standpoints the grace of
chastity is less in its simple possession than in its impassioned
recovery, we have to remember that the great masters do not marry
because of the Divine Union. The connection in Chrétien between Gawain
and the Graal Quest arises out of a challenge which he had accepted to
clear himself of a charge of murder, as to which it was a matter of
agreement that if he could find and bring back the Lance which bleeds he
should be excused from returning to withstand the ordeal by battle. Out
of this condition certain codices present the visit of Gawain to the
Graal Castle very early in the version of Gautier. He beheld, firstly, a
bier and, secondly, all the Hallows, asked the required question, and
was told by the Royal Warden

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

that if he could resolder the Broken Sword he should know (*a*) why the
beautiful maiden who carried the Sacred Vessel was dissolved in tears;
(*b*) why a bier formed part of the pageant; and (*c*) whose body was
laid thereon. These points are peculiar to Gautier and his connections.
The experiment with the Sword proved, however, a failure; Gawain learned
nothing; he fell asleep after hearing the discourse of the King, who
explained what was wanting in him; and on awaking next morning he
discovered himself in the open country, with his horse and his arms
close by him. It is obvious that he had found the Lance, but he had not
carried it away, and for this reason he set out to take up the
challenge. King Arthur, however, intervened, and the matter was settled
in peace.

The codices which embody this account give much more extended
particulars of another visit which was paid by Gawain to the Castle; but
it is obvious that they are exclusive mutually, and the alternative
texts which omit the first visit, and determine in a different sense the
question of the accusation and the ordeal, are for the quest of Gawain
the logical and preferable texts. Second or first, on this occasion,
nothing was further from the mind of the character in chief than to go
on the Quest of the Graal, nor was he concerned with the covenant of any
challenge. He assumed the responsibility of a knight who was slain by a
hand invisible when riding under his safe conduct. The identity of this
knight is never disclosed, but Gawain wore his armour and was carried by
his steed, who had mysterious foreknowledge of the way, to a destination
of which he himself could dream nothing. He arrived at his term in due
course, but what took place was the reception of a masquerading
neophyte, who was unintroduced, unwarranted and unqualified. In place of
being he that was to come, they had still to look for another; but his
harness for a moment deceived the company about him.

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

Chrétien knew nothing of a bier and a dead body, in that place where the
sign of arch-natural life abode in perpetuity; those who took up the
story in the footsteps of Gautier knew nothing also, and agreed to
ignore his intimations of unexplained disaster. But Gautier or another,
the bier was again seen at this visit of him who was unexpected, and a
procession of canons and clerks recited thereover the Holy Office for
the Dead, with a great ceremony of solemn voices intoning. The King also
visited the bier and lamented over it. The pageant of the Graal was
manifested, after the manner which I have described elsewhere, and
Gawain saw it openly. At the conventional feast it was the Sacred Vessel
which served so far as the food was concerned, but the sacramental
communication was in one kind only, since the wine, as we have seen, was
brought round by the butlers. Gawain, as in the previous case, asked all
the necessary and saving questions, and was invited to solder the Sword,
but he failed, as before, in this ordeal and learned only concerning its
history. A stroke which was dealt therewith destroyed the realm of
Logres and all the surrounding country. In the midst of this narrative
Gawain fell asleep at the table, and was left to repose. When he awoke
there was neither hall nor castle, neither King nor chivalry about him,
but a fairly garnished land lying on the brink of the sea and restored
by so much of the belated question as he had asked the King. The common
folk blessed him, and the common folk accused him, because he had not
finished his work or insured their full felicity.

Of such is the Quest of Gawain as it appears in the *Conte del Graal*,
even as the pillars of a temple which was never finished. It intervenes
between the first and second visit of Perceval to the High House of the
Hallows, but on Perceval's own Quest it has no effect whatever, and the
narrative of the one ignores that of the other. It is said in some old
fable--which is not, I think, of the Graal,--that Arthur and Gawain at
last reposed

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

in Fairyland. There are two classes of Knighthood--that which goes in
and returns, and thereof is Ogier; that which enters but does not come
back evermore, and thereof is Launfal. Now, Arthur returns in the
fulness of the times that are to come, and, however these dreams may be,
it is certain that the Peace of the King is not the peace of Gawain. In
conclusion as to the *Conte del Graal*, after every allowance has been
made for one statement in Chrétien, from which it follows that the
father of the Fisher King was, as we have seen, sustained by a Sacred
Host taken from the Holy Graal, the keynote of the whole cycle is that
it has no sacramental connections such as we find elsewhere in the
literature. On this account, if indeed on no other, the *Conte del
Graal* has nothing to tell us which signifies in respect of our true
affair, except by way of its echoes and reflections from sources which
do concern us nearly, and are better and fuller witnesses. It has every
title to possess in perpetuity the kind of Perceval which it has helped
materially to create--in whom the Parsifal of Wolfram has little and the
transfigured Knight of the *High History* has next to nothing at all.
