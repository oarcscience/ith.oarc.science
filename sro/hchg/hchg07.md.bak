### IV

#### THE LITERATURE OF THE CYCLE

The cycle of the Holy Graal is put into our hands like counters which
can be arranged after more than one manner, but that which will obtain
reasonably for a specific purpose may not of necessity conform to the
chronological order which by other considerations would be

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

recommended to archeological research. It will be pertinent, therefore,
to say a few words about the classification which I have adopted for
these studies, and this is the more important because at first sight it
may seem calculated to incur those strictures on the part of recognised
learning which, on the whole, I rather think that I should prefer to
disarm. I must in any case justify myself, and towards this, in the
first place, it should be indicated that my arrangement depends solely
from the indubitable sequence of the texts, as they now stand, and
secondly, by an exercise of implicit faith, from several palmary
findings of scholarship itself. It follows that the disposition of the
literature which has been adopted for my own purpose is, on the evidence
of the texts, a legitimate way in which to treat that literature. There
are certain texts which arise out of one another, and it is a matter of
logic to group them under their proper sections. Comparatively few
documents of the whole cycle have reached us in their original form,
even subsequently to that period at which the legends were taken over in
a Christian interest, while many of them have been unified and
harmonised so that they can stand together in a series. It is the
relation which has been thus instituted that I have sought to preserve,
because among the questions which are posed for our consideration there
is that of the motive which actuated successive writers to create texts
in succession which, although in many cases of distinct authorship, are
designed to follow from one another; as also to re-edit old texts; and
to adjust works to one another with the object of presenting in a long
series of narratives the Mystery of the Holy Graal manifested in
Britain. The bulk of the texts as they stand represents the acquisition
completed and certain intentions exhibited to their highest degree.
Hence a disposition which shows this the most plainly is for my object
the reasonable grouping of all, that object depending from almost the
last state of the literature and differing to this extent from ordinary

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

textual criticism, to which the first state is not only important but
vital.

The Graal cycle, as it is understood and as it will be set forth in
these pages, belongs chiefly to France and Germany. Within these limits
in respect of place and language, there is also a limit of time, for
textual criticism has assigned, under specific reserves, the production
of the chief works to the fifty years intervening between the year 1170
and the year 1220. As regards the reserves, I need only mention here
that the romantic histories of Merlin subsequent to the coronation of
Arthur have not so far been regarded by scholarship as an integral part
of the Graal literature, while one later German text has been ignored
practically in England. Seeing that within the stated period and perhaps
later, many of the texts were subjected, as I have just indicated, to
editing and even to re-editing, it seems to follow that approximate
dates of composition would be the most precarious of all arrangements
for my special design. As regards that course which I have chosen, I
have found that the French romances fall into three divisions and that
they cannot be classified otherwise. The elaborate analysis of contents
which I have prefixed to each division will of itself convey the general
scheme, but I must speak of it more expressly in the present case
because of the implicits with which we shall be concerned presently.

We may assume, and this is correct probably, that the earliest extant
romances of the Holy Graal--the speculative versions which have been
supposed in the interests of folk-lore being, of course, set apart--are
the first part of the *Conte del Graal* written by Chrétien de Troyes,
and the metrical *Joseph of Arimathæa* by Robert de Borron--in the
original draft thereof. In the earlier records of criticism the
preference was given to the latter, but it is exercised now in respect
of the former text.

Besides the folk-lore and non-Christian legends of Peredur and the Bowl
of Plenty--which shall be considered

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

in their proper place--there was another class of traditions taken over
in the interests of the Holy Graal. That the Arthurian legend had
pre-existed in another form is not only shown by the early metrical
literature of northern and southern France but by isolated English
texts, such as the fifteenth-century *Morte d’Arthur*, which suggest
older prototypes that are not now extant. It is shown otherwise by the
Welsh *Mabinogion*, which, much or little as they have borrowed in their
subsisting form from French sources, point clearly to indigenous
traditions. The North-French romances were refounded in the
interest--whatever that was--of the Graal sub-surface design. The most
notable example in another sense was perhaps the Merlin cycle, which
took over the floating traditions concerning the prophet and enchanter
and created two divergent romances, each having the object of connecting
Merlin with the Graal. The general process was something after the
manner following: (1) Lays innumerable, originally oral but drifting
into the written form; (2) the same lays reedited in the Arthurian
interest; (3) the Graal mystery at first independent of Arthurian
legend, or such at least is the strong inference concerning it; (4) the
Graal legend married to Arthurian romance, the connection being at first
incidental; (5) the Arthurian tradition after it had been assumed
entirely in the interests of the Holy Graal.

I recur, therefore, to my original thesis, that there is one aspect at
least in which for my purpose the superior importance resides not in the
primordial elements of the literature but in their final and unified
form. As a typical example, it is customary to recognise that there was
an early state of the *Book of the Holy Graal* which is not now extant.
The text, as we have it, is later than most of the cycle to which it
belongs properly, yet it poses as the introduction thereto. Now the
early draft may or may not have preceded, chronologically speaking, the
corresponding first versions of some of the connecting texts, and in
either case when the time came for the

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

whole literature to be harmonised it was and remains entitled to the
priority which it claimed, but that priority is in respect of its place
in the series and not in respect of time. The re-editing of the romances
in the Graal interest must be, however, distinguished carefully from the
innumerable alterations which have been made otherwise but to which no
ulterior motive can be attributed. There is further no difficulty in
assuming (1) that the passage of folk-lore into Christian symbolical
literature may have followed a fixed plan; (2) that when late editing
exhibits throughout a number of texts some defined scheme of instituted
correlation, there may have been again a design in view, and it is this
design which is the concern of my whole research.

The places of the Graal legend, its reflections and its rumours, are
France, Germany, Holland, Italy, Spain, Portugal, England and Wales.

In matters of literature France and England were united during the
Anglo-Norman period, and when this period was over England produced
nothing except renderings of French texts and one compilation therefrom.
Germany had an independent version of the legend derived by its own
evidence from a French source which is now unknown. The German cycle
therefore differs in important respects from the French cycle; the
central figure is a characteristic hero in each, but the central sacred
object is different, the subsidiary persons are different in certain
cases--or have at least undergone transformation--and, within limits,
the purpose is apparently diverse. The Dutch version is comparatively an
old compilation from French sources, some of which either cannot be
identified or in the hands of the poet who translated them they have
passed out of recognition. Italy is represented only by translations
from the French and one of these was the work of Rusticien de Pise, who
has been idly accredited with the production of sources rather than
derivatives of the legend, and this in the Latin tongue. There is also
another compilation, the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Tavola Ritonda*,
but in both instances more than the names of the MSS. seems unknown to
scholars. The Italian cycle is not of importance to any issue of the
literature, either directly or otherwise, and so far as familiarity is
concerned it is almost ignored by modern students. The inclusion of
Spain in the present schedule of places might seem merely a question of
liberality, for the Spanish version of the Graal legend exists only in
(1) the inferred allusions of a certain romance of Merlin, printed at
Burgos in 1498, and (2) in a romance of Merlin and the *Quest of the
Holy Graal*, printed at Seville in the year 1500. Of the first work only
a single copy is known to exist, and no French or English scholar seems
to have seen it; the second has so far escaped the attention of
scholarship, outside the bare record of its existence. This
notwithstanding, according to the German cycle, the source of the legend
and its true presentation in at least one department thereof, are to be
looked for in Spain, and the first account concerning it was received by
a Spanish Jew. Portugal, so far as I am aware, is responsible only for a
single printed text, but it represents a French original which is
otherwise lost; it is therefore important and it should receive full
consideration at a later stage. As regards Wales, it is very difficult i
and fortunately unnecessary to speak at this initial stage. Of the
Graal, as we find it in France, there is no indigenous Welsh literature,
but there are certain primeval traditions and bardic remanents which are
held to be fundamental elements of the cycle, and more than one of the
questing knights are found among the *Mabinogion* heroes. In the
thirteenth century and later, the legend, as we now have it, was carried
across the marches, but it is represented only by translations.

For the purpose of the classification which follows, we must set aside
for the moment all whatsoever that has come down to us concerning
quests, missions and heroes in which the central object known as the
Holy Graal does not appear. We shall deal with these fully when

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

we come to the study of the texts severally; we are now dealing
generally, and there is nothing to our purpose in the Welsh *Peredur* or
in the English *Syr Percyvelle*. Whatever its importance to folk-lore,
the Welsh *Peredur*, in respect of its literary history, is a tangled
skein which it will not repay us to unravel more than is necessary
absolutely. It has been compared, and no doubt rightly enough, to the
*Lay of the Great Fool*, but, whether we have regard to his foolishness
or to the nature of his mission, Peredur never interests and also never
signifies. His mission is confined to the extermination of sorceresses,
and among these of such sorceresses as those of Gloucester. On the other
hand, the English metrical romance is entitled to less consideration
except for its claims as literature, and it is only in its speculative
attribution to a lost prototype that it has concerned scholarship. It
must be understood at the same time that both texts are essential to the
literary history of the whole subject from the standpoint of folk-lore.
The remaining works may be classified into cycles, according either to
affinities of intention or to the seat of their origin, and among these
the Northern French texts fall into three divisions, the distribution of
two being, within their own lines, a chronological arrangement strictly.

The *Conte del Graal* is allocated properly after the cycle of
folk-lore--as it is reflected at a far distance in the non-Graal texts
that survive. The fact that the Lesser Chronicles are given a priority
of place in respect of the Greater Chronicles does not for that reason
mean that all their parts are assumed to be older than all the documents
contained in the third division. In the third division itself the
chronological arrangement has been abandoned, as it is more important
for my purpose to show the codification of the documents by which they
have been harmonised into a series rather than to place them in an order
of dates which would at best be approximate only and would represent the
first drafts rather than the texts as they remain. The divisions are
therefore as follows:--

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

*A*. *The Conte del Graal*. Let me say, in the first place, that our
problems are not the authorship of an individual prose or metrical
romance, not even the comparative dates of certain documents as they now
stand actually, but whether we, who as mystics have come to know the
significance and value of the hidden life of doctrine, can determine by
research the extent to which the intimations of such doctrine found in
the Graal literature are true or false lights. Now, I suppose that there
is no very serious question as to the literary greatness of Chrétien de
Troyes, while some of the sequels and alternatives added to his
unfinished poem are not perhaps unworthy to rank with his own work; the
collection, however, as a whole, offers very little to our purpose. So
far as Chrétien himself carried the story, we are not only unable to
gather clearly what he intended by the Graal, but why he had adventured
so far from his proper path as to plan and even to begin such a story.
If he had gone further, as I believe personally, we should have found
that the Sacred Vessel, Telesma, or Wonder-Working Palladium carried
with it the same legend as it carried for most other writers; but we do
not know and it matters less than little, for the *Conte del Graal* at
its best is Nature in the pronaos of the temple testifying that she is
properly prepared. If we grant this claim, we know that in Chrétien at
least, however she may have been prepared conventionally, she has not
been sanctified. The alternative termination of Gerbert carries the
story up to a higher level, moving it in the direction of Wolfram's
*Parsifal*, yet not attaining its height. So far as any mystic term is
concerned, the great *Conte* is rather after the manner of a hindrance
which calls to be taken out of the way; it is useless for the higher
issues, and even for the business of scholarship it seems of late days
to have lapsed from its first importance.

The chief *additamentum* of this cycle is the unprinted metrical
*Perceval*, which is preserved in the library at Berne. The desire of
the eyes of students is a certain

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

lost Provençal poem, connected by the hypothesis with Perceval, as to
which we shall hear more fully in connection with the German cycle of
the Holy Graal.

The Chrétien portion of the *Conte del Graal* was written not later than
1189, and the most recent views assign it somewhere between that year
and 1175. Manessier and Gerbert are believed to have produced their
rival conclusions between 1216 and 1225. As regards the Chrétien
portion, it has been recognised, and may be called obvious, that it
"presupposes an early history." This being so, it does not seem
unreasonable to infer that the first form of the early history was
either (*a*) the first draft of De Borron's poem, or (*b*) it
corresponded to the book from which De Borron drew and of which,
Chrétien notwithstanding, he is probably the most faithful, perhaps even
the only representative. On the other hand, if the particular quest does
not draw directly or indirectly from the particular history, then my own
view is that in the question of date but little can be held to depend
from the priority of Chrétien's poem--which is a quest--or that of De
Borron--which is a history. I have therefore no call to indicate a
special persuasion. For what it is worth, the inferences from admitted
opinion seem to leave the priority of De Borron still tenable in the
first form of his poem, and for the rest I hold it as certain that my
classification, although a novelty, is justified and even necessary; but
exact chronological arrangement, in so tinkered a cycle of literature as
that of the Holy Graal, is perhaps scarcely possible, nor is it my
concern exactly.

*B*. The cycle of Robert de Borron, being that which is connected more
especially and accurately with his name, and herein is comprised:--

1\. The metrical romance of Joseph of Arimathæa, in which we learn the
origin, early history and migration of the Graal westward, though it
does not show that the Sacred Vessel came actually into Britain.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

2\. The *Lesser Holy Graal*, called usually *Le Petit St. Graal*. We
have here a prose version of the poem by Robert de Borron, which
accounts for its missing portions, but the two documents are not
entirely coincident.

3\. The *Early History of Merlin*, and, this represents in full another
metrical romance of the same authorship but of which the first 500 lines
are alone extant.

4\. The *Didot Perceval*, but this text is regarded as a later
composition, though it seems to contain some primitive elements of the
quest. Its designation is explained by the fact that it was at one time
in the possession of M. Firmin Didot, the well-known Parisian
bookseller. Its analogies with the poem of Chrétien de Troyes are
thought to indicate a common source of knowledge rather than a
reflection or derivation from one to another. This romance has been also
somewhat generally regarded as the prose version of another lost poem by
Robert de Borron. The *additamentum* of this cycle is the fuller
unprinted codex of the *Didot Perceval* preserved in the library at
Modena.

These documents constitute what may be termed the Lesser Histories or
Chronicles of the Holy Graal. Their characteristics in common, by which
they are grouped into a cycle, are (1) the idea that certain secret and
sacramental words were transmitted from apostolic times and were taken
from East to West; (2) the succession of Brons as Keeper of the Holy
Graal immediately after Joseph of Arimathæa.

The metrical *Joseph* may have been written soon after 1170, but the
balance of opinion favours the last years of the twelfth century.
Criticism supposes that there were two drafts, of which only the second
is extant. It was succeeded by the early *Merlin*. As regards the *Didot
Perceval*, this is known chiefly by a manuscript ascribed to the end of
the thirteenth century.

*C*. The Cycle of the Greater Holy Graal and the Great Quest,
comprising:--

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

1\. *The Saint Graal*, that is, *The Book of the Holy Graal*, or *Joseph
of Arimathæa*, called also the *First Branch of the Romances of the
Round Table* and the *Grand Saint Graal*. The last designation is due
perhaps to its dimensions; but it may be held to deserve the title on
higher considerations, as the most important development of the legend
in its so-called historical aspects, by which I mean apart from the
heroes of the various quests. The work has been widely attributed to
Walter Map, sometime archdeacon of Oxford and Chaplain to Henry II. of
England. While the trend of present opinion is to regard it as of
unknown authorship, I think that the ascription is not untenderly
regarded by scholarship, and recognising, as we must, that evidence is
wanting to support the traditional view, no personage of the period is
perhaps antecedently more likely. Unfortunately more than one other
romance, which seems distinct generically in respect of its style, has
received the same attribution. The Greater Holy Graal was intended to
create a complete sequence and harmony between those parts of the cycle
with which it was more especially concerned, and the Galahad Quest, as
we have it, may represent the form of one document which it intended to
harmonise. The alternative is that there was another version of the
Quest which arose out of the later Merlin, or that such a version was
intended. I believe in fine that my order is true and right.

2\. The later Merlin romances, and because the *Vulgate Merlin* is in
certain respects, though not perhaps expressly, a harmony of De Borron's
cycle and that of the *Book of the Holy Graal*, drawing something from
both sources, I refer here more especially to the *Huth Merlin* and the
secret archives of the Graal from which it claims to derive. The history
of Merlin is taken by the first text up to his final enchantment in the
forest of Broceliande, and in particular to that point when the knight
Gawain hears the last utterance of the prophet. An analogous term is
reached by the *Huth Merlin* in

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

respect of Bademagus, through a long series of entirely distinct
episodes; it should be stated that the references to the Holy Graal are
few in both romances, but they are pregnant with meaning.

As an addendum to these branches, there is the late text called *The
Prophecies of Merlin*, which I know only by the printed edition of
Rouen. It has wide variations from the texts mentioned previously in so
far as it covers their ground, but it has also its Graal references. It
has been regarded as a continuation of the early prose *Merlin*, and in
this sense it is alternative to the Vulgate and the Huth texts.

3\. The great prose *Lancelot*, which in spite of its subject-matter is,
properly understood, a book of high sanctity, or it lies at least on the
fringe of this description, and towards the close passes therein.

4\. The *Longer Prose Perceval le Gallois*, or *High History of the Holy
Graal*, which offers a term and conclusion of the Graal mystery by way
of alternative to or substitute for that of the Galahad quest. It is
like a rite which has narrowly escaped perfection; it holds certain
keys, but the doors which they open are not doors which give entrance to
the greatest mysteries. Herein the king is dead, and with all the claims
of Perceval it is a little difficult to say of him: Long live the king!
The romance does not harmonise with the other histories of Perceval; it
has elements which are particular to itself and the air of an
independent creation. It should be added that it draws also from sources
to us unknown and has haunting suggestions of familiarity with the
source of Wolfram. So far as there has been any critical opinion
expressed concerning it in England, it must be said that it has missed
the mark.

5\. *The Quest of the Holy Graal*, called also *The Last Book of the
Round Table*, containing the term of the mystery as given in the
Chronicle concerning Galahad the haut prince, and this is the quest *par
excellence*, the head and crown of the Graal legend. I know that this

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

statement will be challenged in certain high quarters of special
research, but before any one speaks of human interest he should say, or
at least in his heart: The Life Everlasting; and this stated, it must be
added that all which is commonly understood by human interest, all which
has been sometimes regarded as characterising the chief quests and one
of them in particular, is excluded by the Great Prose Quest. We have in
place thereof a spiritual romance, setting forth under this guise a
mystery of the soul in its progress. It is only the books of perfection
which make at once for high rites and gorgeous pageants of literature.
Hereof is the Galahad Quest.

These five romances constitute what I have termed the Greater Chronicles
of the Holy Graal. It will have been understood that the *Longer Prose
Perceval* and the Great Prose Quest exclude one another; they stand as
alternatives in the tabulation. The characteristics of this cycle are
(1) the succession of Joseph II. as keeper of the Holy Graal immediately
after his father and during the latter's lifetime, this dignity not
being conferred upon Brons, either then or later; (2) the substitution
of a claim in respect of apostolical succession--which placed the Graal
keepers in a superior position to any priesthood holding from the
apostles--for that of a secret verbal formula applied in respect of the
Eucharist.

The dates of the texts which are included in the Greater Chronicles
differ widely so far as the extant manuscripts are concerned. The canon
of the Graal literature was not in reality closed till the end of the
thirteenth century if these manuscripts are to be regarded as the final
drafts. The lost antecedent documents cannot, of course, be assigned. It
is suggested, for example, that the prototype of the *Book of the Holy
Graal* and the *Quest of Galahad* preceded the continuations of
Chrétien. The unique text comprised in the *Huth Merlin* has been dated
about 1225 or 1230, the MS. itself belonging to the last quarter of the
thirteenth

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

century. There was a fourth part which is now wanting; it contained a
version of the Galahad quest, and though it has been concluded that it
corresponds to the extant text, the *Huth Merlin* embodies allusions to
episodes in the lost part which are not to be met with in the Galahad
romance as it now stands.

The *additamenta* of this cycle are the quests of the Holy Graal in the
Spanish and Portuguese versions, and one rendering into Welsh. There is
also material of importance in the draft of the Great Quest printed at
Rouen in 1488 together with the *Lancelot* and the *Morte d’Arthur*, as
also in the Paris edition of 1533. Finally, the English metrical
chronicle of Hardyng contains a version of the Galahad legend which
differs in some express particulars from anything with which we are
acquainted in the original romance texts.

*D*. The German Cycle. The *Parsifal* of Wolfram is the high moral sense
saying that it has received the light, and I know not how we could
accept the testimony even if that which uttered it had risen from the
dead. I am speaking, however, of the German legend only in one of its
phases, and at a later stage I shall exhibit every material which will
enable us to judge of its importance. The *Conte del Graal*, except in
its latest portions, and then by chance allusions or derivations at a
far distance, has nothing to tell us of secret words, Eucharistic or
otherwise; it has also no hint of any super-apostolical succession. It
is the same with Wolfram's *Parsifal*; the legend, as it stands therein,
is in fact revolutionised, or rather it is distinct generically, and the
quest, though it follows the broad lines of the other Percevals, has
gone under I know not what greatness of alteration. If the Northern
French stories concerning the widow's son could be likened to a high
grade in Masonry, then assuredly the German version would be that rite
rectified. The *Titurel* of Albrecht von Scharfenberg, which deserves a
notice which it has never received in England, seems to suggest that
there

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

is a greater light in the East than has been found as an abiding
presence in the West, and except in a very high mystic sense, a sense
much higher than is to be found in any of the romances, this suggestion
offers the token of illusion. In fine, to dispose of this cycle, let me
say that the metrical romance of *Diu Crône* by Heinrich von dem Turlin
has no secret message, even in the order of phantasy. At this day we
rest assured, or those at least whose opinion matters anything, that the
most hopeless of all worlds to enter in search of wisdom is the world of
ghosts. It happens, however, that in Heinrich's poem ghosts, or the dead
alive, are the custodians of the mysteries. At the same time they may
hold the kind of office which it is possible to confer on Sir Gawain,
who is the hero of this voided quest. I speak, of course, in comparison
with the palmary texts by which the Quest itself has entered into the
holy places of literature.

It will follow from the above tabulation that while the Graal literature
is divisible into several cycles there are three only which belong to
our particular concern. The classification which I have made is
serviceable therefore in yet another way, since it enables us, firstly,
to set apart that which is *nihil ad rem nostram catholicam et sanctam*,
and, secondly, to come into our own.
