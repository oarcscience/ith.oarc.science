### III

#### THE INSTITUTION OF THE HALLOWS, AND, SECONDLY, THE VARIATIONS OF THE CUP LEGEND

We have seen that the secret of the Graal, signifying the
super-substantial nourishment of man, was communicated by Christ to His
chosen disciple Joseph of Arimathæa, who, by preserving the body of his
Master after the Crucifixion, became an instrument of the Resurrection.
He laid it in the sepulchre, and thus sowed the seed whence issued the
arch-natural body. On Ascension Day this was removed from the world, but
there remained the Holy Vessel, into which the blood of the natural body
had been received by Joseph. Strangely endued with the virtues of the
risen Christ and the power of the Holy Ghost, it sustained him
spiritually, and by a kind of reflection physically, during forty years
of imprisonment, through which period he was in that condition of
ecstasy which is said by the Christian masters of contemplation to last
for half-an-hour--being that time when there is silence in heaven. We
find accordingly that Joseph had no sense of duration in respect of the
years; he was already in that mystery of God into which the ages pass.
After his release the Holy Vessel became a sign of saving grace,
instruction and all wonder to that great company which he was elected to
take westward. He committed it in fine to another keeper, by whom it was
brought into Britain, and there, or otherwhere, certain lesser Hallows
were added to the Hallow-in-chief, and were held with it in the places
of concealment. Those which are met with most frequently, as we have

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

seen, are four in number, but the mystery is really one, since it is all
assumed into that vessel which is known for the most part as the Cup of
legend. It is understood that for us at least this Cup is a symbol,
seeing that the most precious of all vessels are not made with hands. It
is in such sense that the true soul of philosophy is a cup which
contains the universe. We shall understand also the ministry of material
sustenance, frequently attributed to the Holy Graal, after another
manner than that which can be presumed within the offices of folk-lore.
It is in this sense that the old fable concerning the Bowl of Plenty,
when incorporated by the Graal Mystery, may prove to have a profound
meaning. Some things are taken externally; some are received within; but
the food of the body has analogies with that of the soul. So much may be
said at the moment concerning certain aspects which encompass the
literature of the Graal, as the hills stand round Jerusalem.

The four Hallows are therefore the Cup, the Lance, the Sword and the
Dish, Paten or Patella--these four, and the greatest of these is the
Cup. As regards this Hallow-in-chief, of two things one: either the
Graal Vessel contained the most sacred of all relics in Christendom, or
it contained the Secret Mystery of the Eucharist. Now, the first
question which arises is whether the general description which obtains
concerning it--as I was almost about to say, in the popular
mind--reposes on the authority of the texts. Here also will be found our
first difficulty. I may not be pardoned such flippancy, but the Psalmist
said: *Calix meus quam inebrians est*, and this has rather a bearing on
the Graal chalice; for the variety of the accounts concerning it may
produce in the mind a sense of having visited some inn of strange
description where those who come to ask questions are served with strong
measures, and full at that.

There are three available sources of information concerning the Sacred
Vessel, including those which are purely of the Eucharistic office. (1)
The apocryphal

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

legends concerning Joseph of Arimathæa which are distinct from those
that have been incorporated with the romances of chivalry and with the
histories leading up to these. (2) The romances themselves and their
prolegomena, which are the chief bases of our knowledge, but on the
understanding that there is no criterion for the distinction between
that which is traditional and that which is pure invention. (3) Some
archæological aspects of sacramental practice.

The apocryphal legends which connect Joseph with the cultus of the
Precious Blood are late, and they lie under the suspicion of having been
devised in the interests of Glastonbury, or through Glastonbury of
ecclesiastical pretensions on the part of the British Church at or about
the period of Henry II. Above these as a substratum of solid fact--I
refer to the fact of the inventions--there has been of late years
superposed an alleged dream of a pan-Britannic Church, which belongs,
however, more particularly to the romance of history. The chivalrous
romances themselves have so overlaid the Graal object with decorations
and wonder-elements that the object itself has been obscured and its
nature can, in some cases, be extricated scarcely. Eucharistic
archæology remains as a source of information on which it is possible to
rely implicitly, but while this can satisfy us as to the variations in
the form and matter of the Sacred Vessel used in the Sacrifice of the
Mass, it does not offer us, except indirectly, much or perhaps any
assistance to determine the relic of legend.

The *Evangelium Nicodemi*, *Acta* \[*vel* *Gesta*\] *Pilati*, and some
other oriental apocryphal documents are the authorities for the
imprisonment of Joseph by the Jews because he had laid the body of
Christ in the sepulchre. William of Malmesbury, John of Glastonbury and
similar makers of chronicles are responsible for referring the first
evangelisation of Britain to Joseph of Arimathæa. From these, however,
we must except Geoffrey of Monmouth, and William of Malmesbury has
nothing

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

to tell us of the Graal, though he has the story of two phials
containing the Precious Blood. The reference to relics of any kind is
also late in the chronicles. An English metrical life of Joseph,
belonging to the first years of the sixteenth century, but drawing from
previous sources, shows how the precious blood was collected by that
saint and received into two cruets, which we find figuring at a later
period in the arms of Glastonbury Abbey. One of these sources, though
perhaps at a far distance, may have been the lost book attributed to
Melkin or Mewyn, which gives an account of these cruets. The tradition
supposes (1) that they were buried at Glastonbury, (2) that they will be
discovered concurrently with the coffin of Joseph, and (3) that
thereafter there will be no more drought in Britain. John of Glastonbury
is one of the authorities for the existence of a book of
Melkin--sometimes identified with the *Chronicle* of Nennius. The more
immediate antecedent of the metrical story is, however, the *Nova
Legenda Angliæ* of Capgrave, and it represents Joseph as living with
twelve hermits at Glastonbury, where he also died and was buried. The
Oxford Vernon MS., written in verse about 1350, shows that there was a
sacred vessel containing blood. The *Chronicle of Helinandus* describes
the Graal as a wide and shallow vessel, wherein meats in their juice are
served to wealthy persons. The *Historia Aurea*, written by John of
Tynemouth, connects Joseph with the Holy Vessel, which it describes as
that large dish or platter in which the Lord supped with His disciples,
with which concurs one entire cycle of the legend. It may be added, for
what it is worth, that the Armorican Gauls seem to have had a sacred
vessel used in certain rites from a very early period. An object of this
kind is thought to be depicted on Armorican coins, being semicircular in
shape, held by means of thongs and devoid of stem or base. Under Roman
domination the vessel was figured with a pedestal.

We come now to the putative historical romances and

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

the poems and tales of chivalry which contain the developed legend of
the Graal. The *Conte del Graal*, which is the first text for our
consideration, has many decorative descriptions of the Sacred Vessel,
but they present certain difficulties, as will be exhibited by their
simple recitation in summary. (1) It was covered with the most precious
stones that are found in the world, and it gave forth so great a light
that the candles at the table were eclipsed, even as are the stars of
heaven in the glory of the sun and moon (Chrétien de Troyes). (2) It
passed to and fro quickly amidst the lights, but no hand appeared to
hold it (Gautier de Doulens, or, as he is now termed, Wauchier de
Denain). (3) It was borne uplifted by a beautiful maiden, who was
discounselled and weeping (Montpellier MS.). (4) It was carried to and
fro before the table by a maiden more beautiful than flowers in April
(second account of Gautier, with which compare the similar recital of
Gerbert). (5) It was carried amidst a great light by an angel, to heal
Perceval (Manessier). (6) It was carried in the pageant by a maiden
through the castle chamber (*ibid*.). (7) It was carried openly at the
coronation of Perceval, also by a maiden (*ibid*.). (8) It was, in fine,
ravished with the soul of Perceval, and has never since been seen so
openly:--

"Ne jà mais nus hommes qui soit nés  
Nel vera si apiertement."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> What follows from
these citations will have occurred to the reader--that in all these
several sections of the *Conte del Graal* there is no intelligible
description of the sacred object; that the writers knew of it at a far
distance only; that some of their references seem to indicate a
brilliant lamp rather than a chalice; and, when they allocated it to
Christian symbolism, that they may have wavered in their meaning between
the idea of the Paschal Dish and the Cup in which Christ consecrated the
wine of the first Eucharist; but we cannot tell. I should

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

add that the prologue, which is certainly the work of a later or at
least of another hand, and embodies some curious material, mentions, but
very briefly, the pageant of the Graal procession, saying that the
Vessel appears at the Castle without sergeant or seneschal, but again
there is no description of the Vessel. In conclusion of this account,
the alternative ending of Gerbert retells with variations part of the
story of Joseph, and although there is once again no intimation as to
the form of the Graal, an account of the service performed at an altar
over "the holy, spiritual thing"--the Vessel more beautiful than eye of
man has seen--is there recounted, while it leaves no doubt in the mind
that this service was a Mass of the Graal. It is the only suggestion of
the kind which is afforded by the vast poem, though the origin and early
history of the sacred object is in accordance with the received
tradition.

The fuller memorials of this tradition are embodied, as we have seen, in
two cycles of literature, but the text which is first in time and chief
in importance is the metrical *Romance of the Graal, or Joseph of
Arimathæa*, by Robert de Borron. A French and a German critic have said
that this is the earliest text of the Graal literature proper, and an
English writer has concluded, on the contrary, that it is not: *mais que
m’importe?* I will not even ask for the benefit of the doubt, so far as
enumeration is concerned. The metrical *Joseph* says that the Graal was
a passing fair vessel, wherein did Christ make His sacrament. This is
vague admittedly, and assuming a certain confusion in the mind of the
writer, it might have been that Dish mentioned by John of Tynemouth in
which the Paschal Lamb was eaten by Christ and His disciples. In place
of the words *mout gent*, which are given by the original French editor
of the only text, Paulin Paris, following I know not what authority, or
imagining a variant reading, substituted the words *mout grant*, which
might well apply to the Paschal Dish. But Robert de Borron certifies to
his own meaning when he

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

recites an utterance of Christ in His discourse to Joseph, for it is
there said that the vessel which has served as the reliquary shall be
called henceforth a chalice:--

"Cist vaisseau où men sanc méis,  
Quant de men cors le requeillis,  
Calices apelez sera."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is impossible
to read the later verses in which the Eucharistic chalice is compared
with the sepulchre of Christ, the mass corporal with the grave-clothes,
and the paten with the stone at the mouth of the tomb, without
concluding that by the Graal was intended the first Eucharistic chalice,
and the presence of this symbolism in the mind of Robert de Borron
suggests a symbolical intention on his part in the whole legend which he
presented. If it is said that his idea of a chalice does not correspond
to a vessel the content of which is sacramental wine, it should be
remembered that the *ciborium* which contains consecrated Hosts is still
at this day replaced on occasion by a chalice of the ordinary form.

The idea of the devotional poet, supposing it to have been as purely
mystical as he was himself deeply religious, might have embodied an
attempt to shadow forth in the perpetuation of the most precious of all
reliquaries the sacramental mystery of the Real Presence.

It seems certain, in any case, that when Robert de Borron speaks of the
Graal as that vessel in which Christ made his sacrament, this must not
be understood as referring to the Paschal Dish, though one probable
derivation of the word Graal would support the latter view. In the
dialect of Languedoc, *Grazal* signified a large vessel, usually of
clay; in the dialect of Provence, *Grasal* was a bowl or platter; in
Anglo-Norman, or its connections, *Graal* was a dish made of some costly
material for the purpose of great feasts, which, as we have seen, is the
description of Helinandus. With all this some of the later romancers
were dissatisfied, and, following Robert de Borron, they exalted the
vessel into a chalice, so

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

that they might bring it into line with the Eucharistic side of the
legend, with which side a paschal dish--whether that of Christ or
another--offered little analogy. The material of such a chalice would
have been probably glass. It follows from Tertullian that in Rome at the
beginning of the third century they used glass chalices; so did the
Bishop of Toulouse at the end of the fourth century; and about A.D. 550
the same custom prevailed, as appears by the life of Cesarius, Bishop of
Arles. A council of Rheims in the days of Charlemagne is said to have
forbidden glass chalices because they were brittle.

The *Lesser Holy Graal* does not depart from the rendering which I have
here given in respect of the metrical romance, but it seems to make the
assurance of the poet more certain by elucidating further the
application of the secret words to the consecration and administering of
the Eucharist. Where the poem says that there is a great book in which
has been written the great secret called the Graal, the *Lesser Holy
Graal* says: This is the secret uttered at the great sacrament performed
over the Graal--that is to say, over the chalice. The vessel is
otherwise described as the one in which Christ sacrificed, as if He
actually celebrated the first Mass, and from the Eucharistic standpoint
this seems much stronger than the corresponding *feisoit son sacrement*,
which are the words of Robert de Borron. The repetition of the
experience of the sacred table which is enjoined by Joseph in both texts
is in both termed the service of the Graal, but in the prose version
alone is it adjudged to the hour of tierce, as if the Mass of the day
were celebrated, and as if certain persons, evidently in a state of
grace, were sustained in the body by the sacramental nutriment of the
soul. The *Early Merlin* and the *Didot Perceval* neither reduce nor
increase the evidence; but it may be hazarded, for what it is worth,
that the original disclosure of the secret words may have had some
office in preserving the content of the great relic.

In the *Early Merlin* there is no allusion to the office

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

of secret words, and no Graal Hallows are mentioned excepting the Cup,
as it is obvious that we cannot include the sword of Merlin, through
which Arthur was chosen to be king. It does not appear that this weapon
had any antecedent history. In the *Didot Perceval* the rumour and the
wonder of the Graal moves pageant-like through all the pages, but it is
more shorn of descriptive allusions than anything that has preceded it
in the quests. When the predestined Knight visits the castle, tower, or
hold in which the Hallow has been preserved through so many centuries,
he sees it plainly enough at the supper-table, along which it passes,
carried with no ostentation by a mere page of the chamber; but he is
said only to hold a vessel wherein the blood of our Saviour reposed.
This is at the first visit, and at the second, when Perceval is
initiated into the whole mystery and becomes the Lord of the Graal, the
description is repeated merely, as if it were a counsel of perfection to
maintain and even to increase in the third text of the trilogy
whatsoever could be called vague and dubious in the first.

The *Book of the Holy Graal*, even when it reproduces with several
variations the prose version of Robert de Borron's poem, gives, in some
of its codices, an explanation of the Sacred Vessel which is the
antithesis of his own. It is described as that Dish in which the Son of
God partook of the Last Supper before He gave to the disciples His own
flesh and blood. It was, therefore, the Paschal Dish. Certain
manuscripts, however, differ so widely that it is difficult to determine
the original state of the text. Another codex follows the account of the
*Lesser Holy Graal*. According to a third codex, it was the content and
not the Vessel which was called the Holy Graal; but, speaking generally,
most versions concur in describing it as the Holy Dish. The connection
with the Eucharist is, however, sufficiently close, for he who is
elected to say the first Mass and to consecrate the unspotted elements
is he also to whom by Divine instruction

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Joseph surrenders
the vessel. But the Blessed Reliquary would seem to have been rather the
outward witness to the presence within those elements. For example, in
the first unveiled vision of the Holy Graal which is granted to any one
outside Joseph himself, we hear of an altar, on one side of which were
the nails used for the Crucifixion, together with the hallowed Lance; on
the other side was the Dish; and in the centre there was an exceeding
rich vessel of gold in the semblance of a goblet--obviously the chalice
of consecration: it had a lid after the manner of a *ciborium*. More
astonishing still, the cup of the Eucharist is placed within the Graal
during a ceremony which corresponds to the Mass. In a romance so
overcharged with decoration and so lavish in episodes of wonder, we
should expect, and shall not be disappointed, that many pageants and
ornaments would collect about the Holy Vessel, and that it should work
many marvels. The Sacrament consecrated within it reveals the mysteries
of Christ openly to chosen eyes, but thereon can no man look until he is
cleansed from sin. It gives also on occasion the vision of an Eternal
Eucharist and a great company sitting at the high table in the Paradise
which is above. So far as concerns the authority of the text itself, it
would appear that the Mass of the Graal is not like that of the Church
without--an office which recurs daily; it is rather an arch-natural
sacrifice, at which the incarnate Christ figures as the sensible
oblation and subsequently as the Melchisedech of the rite, communicating
Himself to the witnesses, while a thousand voices about him give thanks
to God amidst a great beating of birds' wings, and

"Young men whom no one knew went in and out  
With a far look in their eternal eyes."

The texts of the later *Merlin* have several references to the Graal,
and it is the chief purpose which moves through the dual romance,
leading up, as it does obviously, to a Quest of the Sacred Vessel; but
what is

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

understood thereby must be gathered chiefly from its reflections of the
Joseph legend. We shall see that in certain codices the account differs
from that of Robert de Borron. The *Vulgate Merlin* has one very
remarkable passage, which tells how the tidings of the Holy Graal spread
through the realm of King Arthur, and how the Graal was that Vessel in
which Joseph of Arimathæa received the blood from the side of Jesus
Christ when He hung upon the Cross. It represents, therefore, a
tradition which is familiar enough not only in the literature of
romance, but in that of religious legend, though it is the antithesis of
the account given in the Lesser Chronicles, wherein we are told that the
blood was drawn into the Vessel after Joseph and Nicodemus had taken
down the Body of the Lord. Secondly, the Graal was that Holy Vessel
which came from Heaven above into the city of Sarras. We have here a
reflection only, and that at a far distance, of the *Book of the Holy
Graal* in the form which is now extant. Thirdly, and to us most
important, the Graal was that Vessel in which Christ first sacrificed
His Blessed Body and His Flesh by the mediation of His bishop, the
Second Joseph, whom He ordained with His own hands. According to the
*Huth Merlin* the Graal was that Vessel in which Jesus and His Apostles
ate the Last Supper. It was again, therefore, the Paschal Dish.

The *Longer Prose Perceval* has many descriptions of the vessel, all of
which are designed to connect it with the chalice, but they are highly
mystical in their nature. As one of the most express attempts to relate
the Graal with the Eucharist, it must be regarded as important for the
subject of the Hallow-in-chief. This romance and the great *Quest of
Galahad* are both texts of transubstantiation, and they must rank also
among the latest documents of the literature. The Lesser Chronicles,
even in the prose version of De Borron's poem, offer no suggestion
concerning this doctrine, the Graal Vessel being simply a Hallow
containing a precious relic. About

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

the period of the *Quest* and the *High History*, the tide of
ecclesiastical feeling, which long previously had set towards the
definition of the dogma, must have permeated the mind of the laity,
prepared as it also was by the desire of things sensible and tangible in
matters of religion. It was, this notwithstanding, still long to the
establishment of the high, symbolical festival of Corpus Christi, which
provided an external epilogue to the closed canon of the Graal, as if by
a final substitution that which was taken away, or at least *ex
hypothesi*, was to be in perpetuity memorialised about the precincts of
the gate by the wardens thereof. In connection with transubstantiation,
it may be remarked that the religious office of Knighthood was above all
things to hear mass, and, next, to confess sins. There are few records
in the Graal romances that the chivalry of Logres communicated, except
in the *Quest of Galahad*, and then only in the case of the elect
knights. All high festivals were observed, all penances fulfilled; but
to participate in the Eucharistic mystery seemed apart from the life of
the world and withdrawn into the sphere of sanctity. However this may
be, the *Longer Prose Perceval* has two cryptic descriptions of the
Graal Vessel, which, on account of their complexity, but for the moment
only, I must present as they stand actually in the story. (1) It is said
concerning Gawain, when he looked at the Graal in his wonder, that it
seemed to him a chalice was therein, "albeit there was none at this
time." It was, therefore, an ark or a tabernacle which was designed to
contain a cup, but when the latter was removed it still held the shadow
or semblance thereof. (2) In the course of the same episode a change was
performed in the aspect of the external object, and it appeared to be
"all in flesh," meaning that it was transformed into a vision of Christ
crucified. Towards the close of the story, when a certain Queen Jandree
relates her visions to Perceval, she sees, in one of these, an image of
the crucifixion from which people collect the Blood into a most Holy
Vessel, elevated

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

for that object by one of them. There are no names mentioned, but for
purposes of simplicity we may assume that they were Joseph and
Nicodemus. In the castle of King Fisherman the office of the Cup was to
receive the Blood which fell from the point of the Sacred Lance. The
priest who officiated at the Graal service is said to begin his
sacrament, with which expression we may compare the words *feisoit son
sacrement*, which are those of Robert de Borron. There is indubitably
reference to the Eucharist in both cases, and perhaps the Graal Mass
Book was a traditional version of the Mass, supposed, *ex hypothesi*, to
follow the Last Supper. Speaking generally, the historical account of
the Cup follows the *Book of the Holy Graal* rather than De Borron's
poem, for the blood which flowed from the wounds of Christ when He was
set upon the Cross is said to have been received into the Sacred Vessel.
There is no ministry in respect of material sustenance attributed to the
Graal in this spiritual romance.

It is, therefore, in one sense the antithesis of the *Quest of Galahad*,
which dwells with equal fulness on the food giving properties of the
Vessel and on its connection with the mystery of such a mass and such an
office of the Eucharist as never before or after was said in the wide
world, apart from this sacred object. When the Holy Graal enters the
court of King Arthur and into the banqueting-hall it is clothed in white
samite, but neither the Vessel nor the bearer are visible to human eyes.
On a later occasion it manifests as a Holy Vessel on a table of silver
in an old chapel. Elsewhere it is observed that the Flesh and Blood of
God are present in the Graal. When it appears to Lancelot in the Castle
of Corbenic, it is still upon a table of silver, but this time the
object is covered with red in place of white samite, and it is
surrounded by angels. In the course of the ceremony Lancelot sees three
men, who represent the Trinity, exalted above the head of the
officiating priest. Two of them place the youngest between the hands of

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

the priest, who again exalts him. On another occasion a child enters
visibly into the substance of the Mass-bread. A man is also elevated,
bearing the signs of the Passion of Christ, and this Personage issues
out of the Vessel, coming subsequently among the knights present, and
causing them to communicate sacramentally. It is after this episode that
the Graal is removed to the spiritual city of Sarras. There Christ
appears to Galahad and his companions, and this is the last
manifestation in connection with the Sacred Vessel. It is the *viaticum*
of the *haut prince*, who thereafter exercises the high option which has
been granted previously and demands that he should be taken away.

As the chief Hallow in the *Parsifal* of Wolfram differs from all the
other romances, it will be left for more full consideration in dealing
with the German cycle; but seeing that in this cycle there are
correspondences outside this great poem with the Northern French
accounts, one of these may be placed here so as to illustrate the
Germanic allusions to the Sacred Vessel in the general understanding
thereof. *Diu Crône*, the poem of Heinrich, says that it was borne on a
cloth of samite and had a base of red gold, on which a reliquary of gold
and gems was superposed. It was carried by a crowned maiden. There is
here, however, a fresh departure from the Graal in Christian symbolism,
for as, on the one hand, it is the quest of a feigned and impossible
hero, so, on the other, the content ascribed to the reliquary is not the
true content. It holds the semblance of bread, as if that of the Divine
Body, but the wine or royal blood, which corresponds to the second
element of the Eucharist, is distilled from the Lance of the legend.

We are now approaching the term of the inquiry allocated to this
section, and it will be seen on reflection that we have three possible
hypotheses regarding the precious vessel: (1) that it was a cruet or
phial, wherein the blood of Christ was reserved permanently--in which
case we can understand the legend on the score of comparative

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

possibility; (2) that it was an open platter or bowl, which, it is
obvious, could have had no permanent content, much less the precious or
indeed any other blood; (3) that it corresponded to the notion of a
chalice, but probably with a cover, after the manner of a ciborium. It
is in late texts that the vessel appears most indubitably in connection
with the sacrifice of the Mass; it was and could be only that which was
recognised by *Diu Crône* of Heinrich and by John of Tynemouth--namely,
a reliquary; but the mystic side of the legend, reflecting in the minds
of the romancers many conflicting issues, took it over to the Eucharist,
influenced by the irresistible connection between the sacramental blood
and the *sang réal* poured out at the Crucifixion. There is evidence
that this view is almost coincident with the marriage of the legend to
romance. The mind of romance connected the vessel and its office with
secret words of consecration and a wonderful grade of priesthood, the
root-matter of which must have been drawn from some source wherein
relics could have counted for little in the presence of the higher
secrets of sanctity.

In conclusion as to this matter, the Holy Graal, according to the
Greater Chronicles, was not the only Hallow which was brought into
Britain by those whose mission was to preach first the gospel therein,
but it was more especially the exotic of the legend, as this was
developed in Northern France. In several cases the other Hallows, as we
shall see, were either present in Britain or arrived some centuries
later. As regards the Lesser Chronicles, it is warrantable to decide
that, in the mind of Robert de Borron, the Sacred Vessel was a
*ciborium* or covered chalice, and that in some manner which is not
clearly declared it was connected with a sacramental service performed
in great seclusion. As regards the Greater Chronicles, it was originally
a Dish, and that Dish in which the Paschal Lamb was eaten at the Last
Supper; but from the very beginning of this ascription the notion of a
cup was essential to the Eucharistic office

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

which also resided in the Vessel; in the *Book of the Holy Graal* a cup
is inserted therein, but in later texts of the cycle the Dish sometimes
undergoes transmutation and reappears as a chalice.
