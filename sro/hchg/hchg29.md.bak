### IV

#### THE CONTE DEL GRAAL.

##### § *A*.--PRELIMINARY TO THE WHOLE SUBJECT

The elements of Robert de Borron's poem are those of the apocryphal
gospel rather than of the romance, as we now understand that term. I do
not wish to be construed too expressly, as I am simply creating a
comparison or instituting a tolerable approximation. In the *Conte del
Graal* of Chrétien de Troyes and the group of poets who continued what
his zeal had begun, we enter into a different atmosphere from that of
the two texts with which we have been concerned previously, and yet it
has analogies therewith. As a whole, it is the sharpest possible
contradistinction to the hypothetical non-Graal quest; but in its first
part, being that which was furnished by Chrétien, it represents more
especially the transition from the folk-tale to the true Graal romance,
and it offers in itself a certain typical specimen of the developing
process. There is therefore little which distinguishes especially and
signally this branch from the old tale of Peredur, as we can conceive it
in its original form; there is a great deal by which several parts of
Manessier's conclusion are distinguished from both, and still more the
alternative rendering of Gerbert. Between all of them and the *Quest of
Galahad* it is understood, this notwithstanding, that the deep abyss
intervenes. The elements of Chrétien's poem are perhaps the most natural
born that it has entered into the heart to conceive. The narrative is
beautiful, or perhaps I should say that it is charming, after the manner
of Nature; it is like a morning in spring. It has something more than
the touch of Nature which takes us at once into its kinship; it seems
actually Nature speaking; and so much of the Graal Mystery as can be
said to enter within its dimensions is that Mystery expressed in the
terms of the outside world, though still

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

bearing a suggestion of translation direct from a strange and almost
unknown tongue. The poem, taken as a whole, has few symbolic elements,
and they are so entirely of the natural sacraments that it is difficult
to recognise one touch of grace therein. Again, I except from this
description what is termed the interpolation of Gerbert, which in
comparison with the rest is like a Masonic tracing-board lecture
compared with an essay of Goldsmith. This analogy is instituted
expressly to show that in the widest construction Gerbert is also far
from the goal.

Well, the *Conte* is a product of successive generations, but this
granted it is the work of a single epoch. If it be approached simply
from the poetic standpoint, there is no doubt much to repay the reader,
if he be not deterred by the difficulties of extremely archaic French
verse. But of the *odor suavitatis* of the sanctuary, of that which
criticism has agreed to describe as the ascetic and mystic element, of
that element which I and those whom I represent desire and look for,
there is so little that it can barely be said to exist. Many who know
and appreciate the sacramental mystery which attaches in certain parts
to the Graal Quest in Malory and to the *Longer Prose Perceval*, which
has been termed *The High History of the Holy Graal*, by Dr. Evans, its
translator, will appreciate exactly this contrast, and will understand
that in Chrétien de Troyes there is little of the secret once delivered
to the saints of any sanctuary, though he made use of materials which
may have carried this suggestion with them. He is described by his one
editor as the poet of love, and as the poet who created the poetry of
sentiment. He is fresh, natural, singularly direct, and he carried his
intention very plainly on the surface in respect of his presentation of
the story, so far as he is known to have taken it. To put it briefly,
anything that is recondite in its significance is that which is typical
of the entire cycle, while that which is obvious is of the poet.

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

The *Conte del Graal* was begun, approximately speaking, about the third
quarter of the twelfth century, and this metrical romance is the longest
of the whole cycle, unless we elect to include the compilation which
passes under the name of the Dutch *Lancelot*. It is the work of several
hands, first among whom, both as to time and merit, is Chrétien de
Troyes. He derived his materials from a source which is no longer
extant, and is responsible for something less than one-eighth of the
entire medley, unless, indeed, his editor, M. C. Potvin, is correct in
his opinion that certain preliminary and certain subsequent matter, now
regarded as later, should be included in his work. But this, I believe,
is rejected with no uncertain voice by all later criticism.

Speaking generally of those quests of the Holy Graal into which we are
here entering by a kind of anticipation, in order to dispose of one
which offers too little to our purpose, it is not very difficult to
follow the mind of romance in its choice one after another of several
heroes, though these are exclusive of each other. In a subject of this
kind, I care little for antecedents in folk-lore as such, and many
speculative constructions of scholarship may also be set aside
reverently. It does not appear, for example, by the texts themselves
that Sir Gawain was at any time the typical hero of the quest, not even
in the mind of Chrétien, though I have said that he was after the manner
born of Nature in his general treatment of the theme. There are two
heroes only, whether typical or otherwise, and these are Perceval and
Galahad, but among these Perceval is neither the ideal questing Knight
nor one who can be called possible until he has undergone the
transmuting process of the later texts. Perhaps at the highest he
represents the spirit of romance when it was tinctured only in part by
sacramental mystery; Galahad represents that spirit when it has
undergone the complete change. From this point of view, we may say that
there are three epochs of the Quest in Northern France:--

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

(*a*) The epoch of Chrétien, all continuations included, and of the
*Didot Perceval* considered as a derivative of Robert de Borron, one of
growth and development after its own manner.

(*b*) The epoch of the *Longer Prose Perceval*, deriving from the
putative Walter Map and the later Merlin romances.

(*c*) The epoch of the *Great Prose Lancelot* and the *Quest of
Galahad*.

It is understood that I am using the term epoch to characterise a
condition of mind rather than one of time, and, secondly, that the
German cycle of the Holy Graal remains over for consideration. It should
be observed in the first epoch that Chrétien and Gautier are the only
French writers who tolerate the notion of an alternative Graal hero in
the person of Gawain. In the second epoch there is Perceval shining in
the kind of light which is native only to Galahad, for the visit which
is paid by Gawain to the Graal Castle is not a part of the Quest but a
pure matter of chance, and he is reflected in a high mirror of idealism.
In the third epoch we have the Quest in its final exaltation, and there
are many heroes, each of whom is dealt with according to his merits,
with Galahad as the Morning Star among all the lesser lights. Gawain
"died as he had lived, in arms" and spiritual inhibition. It is in the
*Conte del Graal*, the *Longer Prose Perceval* and in more than one
dubious text of the German cycle that he is represented as an
intentional Graal quester. It is true that he proposes the experiment in
the prose *Galahad*, but he takes none of the instituted precautions,
and he abandons it easily and early. Those who imputed a certain
righteousness to Nature allowed him some qualified success within the
measure of their capacity, but it came about that the mystic mood
intervened and, having found that Nature was of no effect, the Quest was
transferred thenceforward into the world of mystery.
