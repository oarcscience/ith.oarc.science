<p>"Through all one comes in touch with a fine spirit, alive to the glory of the world and all that charms the heart and sense of man, yet seeing past these with something of the soul of Galahad. . . .

<p>"Mr. Waite has presented his philosophy of life in a series of aphorisms. The author of this volume is well known as one of the best living authorities on the history of mysticism, and the point of view here maintained is that of an initiate. Man's highest destiny lies--as St. Augustine taught many centuries ago--in his ultimate union with the Divine Nature. There are several hundreds of aphorisms in this slender volume, all of them terse and pregnant."--<em>The Tribune</em>.</p></td>
