#### SOME LATER MERLIN LEGENDS

##### § *A*.--THE VULGATE MERLIN

There are many questions, and some of them may be insoluble, which are
concerned with or arise out of the legend of Merlin, but there is
perhaps one only which enters at all deeply into the collateral legend
of the Graal; it is why the British prophet, partly magician and
enchanter, but in part also God's messenger, with his consequent strange
mixture of motives, should have been selected in the mind of romance, or
in any more withdrawn mind, as the promulgator of the Graal Mystery in
Great Britain--perhaps more correctly--as the semi-supernatural power
which was at work in connection therewith; why also it was he who
brought about the institution of the Third Symbolical Table, and set up
that Siege Perilous which was, in the first place, to terminate the
enchantments of Britain, and, in the second, by the alternative
intervention of the adventurous times, to make void--but this is long
after he has himself passed away--the high mystery of chivalry so far as
the Round Table was concerned. The *Didot Perceval* intervened in
respect of the latter vocation, with results which we have seen already,
but in this respect it is scarcely the voice of the literature.

There are those who maintain that the late prophecies

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries attributed to Merlin were
produced with a political object; but the object of the Graal was,
speaking broadly, mystical, and as regards the literature which embodies
it, this is either the reflection at a distance of secret sanctuary
doctrine, or it stands in some dubious manner for the aspirations of the
Celtic Church, and admits therefore a political object to the extent
that such aspirations responded to particular ambitions which we know to
have been cherished by English kings at or about the period during which
the literature was developed. There are those who look to Armorica for
the original book of the legend, and say that this was latinised by
Geoffrey of Monmouth; but the question as to the origin of the romance
elements is too complicated for so simple a settlement, and if it had
ever a single source in writing, it was at a period when it was apart
from romance, and personally I do not question that it was in the Latin
tongue. There are those who consider that Scotland was the home of the
Arthurian myth, but the land of second sight is not really that of the
Mysteries, and though the old Cumbrian kingdom may have contributed to
the story of Merlin, the latter must have been enriched from other
sources. It was transported, we have been told, into Brittany, and there
it may have undergone an express transformation; but, in common with so
much of the Arthurian cycle, it was codified, extended and enriched by
the process of late editing in some particular, though unexplained,
interest, the method adopted by which was the collection of all the
great texts of Arthurian literature about the Holy Graal. The
hypothetical book of that legend was the central sacred point, and all
the extant texts stand about it like subsidiary Hallows.

The break between the *Early History of Merlin*, which ends by saying
that King Arthur held his land and kingdom long in peace, and the
*Vulgate Merlin*, which begins by reciting how the nobles who had
acknowledged him unwillingly went against him into prolonged rebellion,

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

is sufficient in itself to open a new branch of the literature. My
classification, however, does not make it impossible that the later text
should reflect something from the Lesser Chronicles, two of the texts in
which are by necessity the root-matter of all the Greater Chronicles;
but its more important derivations are from the *Book of the Holy Graal*
and the appurtenances thereof, including the prose *Lancelot*. We are
only concerned with the text in respect of its Graal references, and of
its content otherwise it will be sufficient, therefore, to say that it
embodies an exhaustive account of King Arthur's wars with the Saxons, a
certain group of adventures of the less indubitably romantic kind, and
thereafter the various circumstances which led up to the internment of
Merlin. In this manner it is the close of the prophet's chronicle,
though it is still only the early history of Arthur.

Here, as elsewhere, the re-editing of romances in the Graal interest is
to be distinguished from the innumerable alterations made otherwise by
intelligent and pother transcribers, but to which no ulterior motive
need be attributed. Perhaps the most signal instance of all the major
editing is the production of two, if not three, sequels, executed
independently, to the Merlin of Robert de Borron, both of which were
less or more exclusively made in the interest which I have mentioned,
while both are also ascribed falsely to Robert de Borron. We could
better understand the *Vulgate Merlin* and the *Huth Merlin* could one
of them be accepted as carrying further forward the De Borron tradition,
and thus leading up to a Perceval Quest, A whether that of the Didot
manuscript or another; but the derivatives of both texts make
insuperable difficulties in respect of this course. At the same time the
process of codification is nowhere complete in the literature. We must
assume, for example, on the basis of textual criticism, that the prose
*Lancelot* had in some form already enriched the cycle when the *Vulgate
Merlin* came into existence, but in several particulars the Merlin
allusions

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

in the *Lancelot* do not correspond with anything in those later Merlin
stories with which we are here concerned. These, on the other hand, when
they reflect elements which are particular to the Lancelot, may be
reproducing in summary merely, or they may offer new materials by way of
variation over details.

The *Vulgate Merlin* says that God has given to the prophet that skill
and discretion which he possesses so to assist him that he shall in fine
accomplish the adventures of the Holy Graal, which adventures are
predestined to take place in the time of King Arthur, and Blaise, the
hermit and scribe, shall live to behold the end. This is true in respect
of the *Didot Perceval*, but not of the other quests, in which this
personage is forgotten, or is lost, at least, among many recording
clerks. But as it follows from the reference, by implication, that
Merlin will not himself survive, the Vulgate text cannot be said to lead
up to that document. In the interminable account of the wars with the
King Rion, there is some stress laid on the achievements of Nasciens,
who is the second of that name, and was a young knight at the time in
question. He was a cousin of Perceval le Gallois, and was of near
kinship to Joseph of Arimathæa, as also a cousin of Celidoine. Here the
derivation is from the *Book of the Holy Graal*, but the genealogy is a
little distracted. Subsequently Nasciens had Galahad in his keeping,
which statement is reflected into the Welsh Quest. When he left
chivalry, Nasciens became a hermit and was taken by the Holy Ghost into
the Third Heaven, where he beheld unveiled the Divine Persons of the
Trinity. He had subsequently the story in his charge, and by the
ordinance of the Great Master he announced that which he had read
therein--that is to say, in the Record of Blaise. It follows that the
secret chronicle which, according to the *Book of the Holy Graal*, had
been written by Christ Himself, was in reality the work of the hermit
performed under the dictation of Merlin, and that the anonymous author
of the *Book of the Holy* 

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Graal* is here
identified by the device of another author, who is himself also
anonymous.

There is one reference to Helayn, the daughter of King Pelles, of the
Castle Corbenic, the niece of King Fisher and of Alain who was wounded
through both thighs by the avenging spear. She was the fairest lady in
the land, and had the Blessed Vessel in her keeping till the time of
Galahad's conception. After what manner Helayn was dispossessed of her
high office the text covenants to declare at a later time, but seeing
that it fails herein, it is reserved on my own part for the branch which
belongs to Galahad. We learn also concerning a son of King Pelles,
who--as in the romance of Lancelot--is named Eleazar. At the age of
fifteen years he told his father that he would never be made a knight
till the best knight of the world should give him his arms and the
accolade after three years of service. In return for the dignity of
chivalry, he believes that he shall take the knight to the country of
King Pelles and the place of the Graal. At this time the king's
daughter, though the bearer of the Sacred Vessel, is only seven years
old. Seeing that Galahad during his brief career of knighthood does not
confer the high degree on any squire of his service, save only Melyas de
Lyle, the son of the King of Denmark, and much less on one who would be
his uncle according to the flesh, whom also he was destined to meet in
the Graal Castle at the term of all, we have here the source of a legend
which differs in certain respects from any extant chronicle of the
perfect knight. But it should be understood that, in the end, Eleazar
serves Gawain and receives the accolade from him.

I do not know what construction is to be placed upon the position of
King Pelles; to all intents and purposes he is the Warden-in-chief of
the Graal in the *Quest of Galahad*, but neither there nor in the
*Vulgate Merlin* is he called the Rich Fisher, which is the
characteristic title of the Warden. The romance with which we are here
and now concerned tells us, this notwithstanding, that he

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

is spoken of as the Rich King, which seems by way of alternative; he is
also a full noble king and a true one. But there is under his charge
King Pellenore of the Welsh Lands, that is to say, Pellehan, who is sick
and will never be healed till he is manifested who shall bring to an end
the adventures of the Holy Graal. This comes to pass at the close of the
times of Galahad. But there is another brother, who is Alain of the
Forayn Lands; he is in sickness also, and will never be cured till the
best knight of all Britain shall ask him why he is stricken by that
malady and what it is that will help him. It follows that there is here
the analogy of Perceval's question, but it is never asked in the sequel,
nor do we hear further of Alain.

In the *Vulgate Merlin* the place of the Graal is Corbenic; it is
situated in the realm of Lytenoys, which might signify Lyonesse; and
just as we know that the Castle is one of perilous and even fatal
adventure, so the kingdom to which it belongs is in nowise a region of
peace, and I have said already that its ruler is a king in warfare. The
great romance contains few other references to the Sacred Vessel and the
history or the quest thereof. The tidings of the Graal in Britain are
still tidings only; the Quest is still not a search after the place of
the Hallows, but of knights who are proper to undertake it. On matters
of so-called early history we hear that Joseph of Arimathæa received the
blood from the side of Christ into the Sacred Vessel when the body was
still hanging on the Cross--representing a tradition that differs from
the Lesser Chronicles, though it is reflected from one of the visions in
the *Book of the Holy Graal*. We hear further that the Graal came from
heaven above into the city of Sarras, which may be a description by
inadvertence, or it may represent a reflection from some source which
corresponds to the antecedents of Wolfram. The spear which opened the
side of Christ was brought to Logres, presumably--for it is not
stated--by him who was the first to consecrate

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

and offer the Eucharist, that is to say, by the second Joseph.

So far in fine as the *Vulgate Merlin* can be said to end at all--seeing
that it stops or breaks off without redeeming its pledges--the close is
taken soon after the enchantment of Merlin by arts of his own
instruction given to the Lady of the Lake; the record of Blaise ceases
for want of materials; but in the meantime the clerks of the court of
King Arthur have taken up the story in a sense, though their task is
confined to the registration of the prowess exhibited by those who are
admitted newly to the fellowship of the Round Table, and are therefore
at once postulants of earthly chivalry spiritualised and possible
seekers for the Graal.
