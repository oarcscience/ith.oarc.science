##### § *D*.--THE DISH

The Sacred Dish being also, as we have seen, rather an unmeaning
mystery, and as although it recurs frequently the descriptions are brief
and the office which it holds is doubtful, it will be only desirable to
distinguish those texts in which it is found. Subject to one
possibility, and this is of the speculative order, it is, as we have
seen, an unmodified survival from folk-lore; we should therefore

expect it to appear in the Chrétien portion of the *Conte del Graal*,
and this is the case actually, but it serves therein a very practical
and mundane purpose, being used by the King and his guest to wash their
hands. It is a silver plate and is carried by a damsel. It reappears in
one codex of the continuation by Gautier. The conclusion by Manessier
describes it after a similar manner, but its purpose is not delineated;
Perceval asks all the necessary questions regarding the Graal and Lance;
he asks also concerning the Dish, but there is apparently nothing to
ask, or at least he hears nothing. At the same time it may have had a
higher significance for this poet than for all the others, since he
causes the Holy Dish to follow Perceval with the other Hallows when he
goes with a hermit into the wilderness, where he serves the Lord for ten
years. Finally, he states in his last words that the Dish was doubtless
assumed into heaven with the other sacred objects, namely, the Lance and
the Sword. According to Gerbert, a lady named Philosophine, who here, as
in another romance, figures as the mother of Perceval, came over with
Joseph of Arimathæa bearing a certain plate; another lady carried an
ever-bleeding lance, while Joseph himself bore a fairer vessel than eye
had ever beheld. In the Lesser Chronicles there is only a single
reference, which occurs in the *Didot Perceval;* when the Graal and the
other Hallows are first manifested to Perceval, it is said that a damsel
bears two silver plates, together with draperies. In the *Book of the
Holy Graal*, and on the occasion that the Second Joseph is raised to the
high pontificate, the Paschal Dish is seen on the altar, and in the
middle place thereof is an exceedingly rich vessel of gold and precious
stones. Here the reference is probably to the Sacramental Cup, but the
account is confused; and elsewhere the complex romance presents a new
aspect of folk-lore, for there is another Dish or Charger, bearing a
great and glorious head, about which we have no explanation and of which
we hear nothing subsequently, either in the text itself or in the later
documents of the cycle.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Dish also
passes out of the horizon, not only in the prose *Lancelot* but also in
the *Quest of Galahad*. The German cycle speaks of a Golden Salver
jewelled with precious stones and carried upon a silken cloth. It is
used in Heinrich's poem to receive the blood which issues from the
Lance.

It seems possible that there was an early tendency on the part of
Christian romancers to distinguish between the chalice--being the Cup in
which Christ made His sacrament--and the Dish--being the vessel in which
He and His disciples ate the Paschal Lamb. They are to some extent
confused in the *Book of the Holy Graal*, and the prose *Lancelot* knows
of a single vessel only, which is the Eucharistic Cup. If such an
implicit was present to the mind of Manessier, we can understand why he
says that the Dish was assumed into heaven.

I wonder that it has not occurred to some of those who have preceded me
in the tortuous paths and among the pitfalls of interpretation, to
understand the four Hallows after another and more highly symbolical
manner, as follows: (1) The Chalice is the Cup of the Sacrament; (2) The
Dish is the Paten; (3) The Sword symbolises the Body of Christ; its
fracture is the bruising for our sins and the breaking for our
trespasses, while at some far distance the resoldering signifies the
Resurrection; (4) In another sense, the Spear is also the wounding for
our iniquities, by which the life flowed from the body, and the issue of
blood therefrom is the outgoing of the divine life for our salvation.
Yet it is not after this manner that we shall come into the truth of the
Graal, while it is likely enough that hereabouts is one of those pits
which bring the unwary to destruction.

We shall meet with all the Hallows under a very slight modification in
the most unexpected of all places, but this will be at a later stage. We
shall then see that the people preserved something besides folk-lore, or
that folk-lore had other meanings behind it than the recognised schools
would be disposed to attribute thereto.
