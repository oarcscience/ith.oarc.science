#### THE LESSER HALLOWS OF THE LEGEND

##### § *A*.--THE SUMMARY OF THESE MATTERS

The Hallows of the Graal legend are the beginning of its wonders and of
its meanings only; but, as I have intimated already, the greater
includes the lesser, and that which is of all the highest has assumed
from the beginning in its symbolism the things by which it is
surrounded. As it is in the light of man's higher part that we are able
to interpret the lower, as the body is explained by the soul, so even
the Castle of the Graal and the great Temple, with all their allusions
and all their sacred things, are resolved into the mystery of the Cup,
because there is a cloud of witnesses but one true voice which is the
spokesman of all. There is obviously no need in this place--as we are
concerned with the greater subjects--to lay stress upon the subsidiary
Hallows as if they were an integral portion of the Holy Graal regarded
symbolically. They are of the accidents only, and as such they are not
vital. The Lance is important to the legends, but not otherwise than
from the legendary standpoint; the Sword is also important, but not in a
sacramental sense; the Dish signifies nothing, or next to nothing. The
explanation is that the French literature of the Holy Graal, in its form
as now extant, has on the external side its roots in traditions and
memorials connected with the Passion of Christ. The different cycles of
the literature develop their account of these memorials with motives
that vary, but they combine therewith certain sacred objects derived
from other sources and not belonging logically to the scheme. They
worked, for example, upon pre-existent materials which were not
assimilated wholly into the matter of the romances, and

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

it is largely these portions for which, in any scheme of interpretation,
we shall be scarcely able to account unless upon divergent lines.

Speaking generally of the Lesser Hallows, the following points are
clear. The German cycle, as represented by Wolfram, derived its idea of
the Lance from a source in folk-lore apart from the Graal legend as we
know it in Northern French. The Northern French literature is clear as
to those Hallows connecting with the Passion of Christ; these are the
Cup, otherwise the Paschal Dish, and the Lance. It is dubious and
variable about the Sword and Dish or Platter, for which there are no
antecedents in the Passion. Several texts have carried over some of the
Hallows without modification from folk-lore, even when great Christian
relics were ready to their hands. For example, the sword used by Peter
at Gethsemane did not occur to them, though it would have been more to
their purpose, the reason being that there was no official tradition
concerning it in the external life of the Church. The Dish is in the
same position of unmodified folk-lore; the platter on which the head of
St. John the Baptist was served to Herodias is a chance missed even by
the *Longer Prose Perceval*, despite its allocation of the Sword to the
instrument of the Precursor's martyrdom. Other subsidiary Hallows,
mentioned therein, which are by way of after-thought, increase without
exhausting the possible relics of the Passion--one of them tells of the
Crown of Thorns; another of the cloth with which Christ was covered when
He was laid on the sepulchre; and yet another of the sacred nails used
at the Crucifixion. I do not remember that the scourge has occurred to
any maker of texts. The Crown of Thorns was called the Golden Circle,
having been set in precious metal and jewels by the Queen of the Castle
where it was preserved. We have also the pincers wherewith the nails
were drawn from the limbs of Christ when He was taken down from the
Cross. Finally, the shield of Judas Maccabæus is met with in one
romance, where it is won

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

in battle by Gawain. The Sword has been also referred. to the same
prince in Israel.

I suppose that the legend of the face-cloth, which is part of the
Veronica legend, is the earliest of the Passion relics, and among the
evangelisation traditions, that of Lazarus and his companions coming to
the South of France, carrying the face-cloth with them, has the palm of
antiquity in the West. But this relic, though it occupies an important
position in the early history of the Graal, is not included among the
Hallows of the Graal Castle.

The metrical romance of De Borron has one Hallow only, and this is the
first extant Graal history. The first extant Quest is that portion of
the *Conte del Graal* which we owe to Chrétien; so far as his work is
concerned there are four Hallows--the Vessel called Graal, the Lance,
the Sword and the Dish. The Lance has been called his particular
introduction. The *Didot Perceval*, which is thought to owe something to
Chrétien, introduces the Lance without any explanation concerning it.
The Chrétien sequels, the *Longer Prose Perceval* and the Galahad
*Quest*, lay stress upon the Sacred Sword, which is usually broken, and
the task of the elect hero is to re-solder the weapon. In all texts the
Lance ranks next to the Cup in importance, and when the one is removed
to heaven at the close of the Galahad *Quest*, it is accompanied by the
other. The *Longer Prose Perceval* is a very late Quest, and it has
Hallows innumerable. The *Book of the Holy Graal*, at least in its
present form, is a very late history, and it introduces the Nails of the
Passion; it gives also an invented and artificial allegory to account
for the Sword.

It being obvious, as I have said, that the Sword and the Dish are but
little to the purpose of the Graal, it will not be difficult to
understand that those who took over these objects from antecedent
legends were not of one mind concerning them, more especially in respect

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

of the Dish, which remains a superfluity in the pageant and a hindrance
in the symbolism as it stands. The Sword in several instances is
important especially, as I have said, to the plot of the story, but it
has no reason in the symbolism.
