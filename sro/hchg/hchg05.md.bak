### II

#### EPOCHS OF THE LEGEND

A minute inquiry into the materials, and their sources, of a moving and
stately legend is opposed to the purposes and interests of the general
reader, though to him I speak accidentally, and apart from any sense of
election I must in honesty commend him to abstain, resting satisfied
that for him and his consanguinities the Graal has two epochs only in
literature--those of Sir Thomas Malory and the *Idylls of the King*. As
Tennyson was indebted to Malory, except for things of his own invention,
so it is through his gracious poems that many people have been sent back
to the old book of chivalry from which he reproduced his motives and
sometimes derived his words. But without entering into the domain of
archæology, even some ordinary persons, and certainly the literate
reader, will know well enough that there are branches of the legend,
both old and new, outside these two palmary names, and that some of them
are close enough to their hands. They will be familiar with the Cornish
poet Robert Stephen Hawker, whose "Quest of the San Graal" has, as
Madame de Staël once said of Saint-Martin, "some sublime gleams." They
will have realised that the old French romance of Perceval le Gallois,
as translated into English of an archaic kind, ever beautiful and
stately, by Dr. Sebastian Evans, is a gorgeous chronicle, full of richly
painted pictures and endless pageants. They will know also more dimly
that there is a German cycle of the Graal traditions--that Titurel,
Parsifal, Lohengrin, to whom a strange and wonderful life beyond all
common teachings of Nature, all common conventions

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

of art, has been given by Wagner, are also legendary heroes of the Holy
Graal. In their transmuted presence something may have hinted to the
heart that the Quest is not pursued with horses or clothed in outward
armour, but in the spirit along the *via mystica*.

There are therefore, broadly speaking, three points of view, outside all
expert evidence, as regards the whole subject, and these are:--

\(1\) The Romantic, and the reversion of literary sentiment at the
present day towards romanticism will make it unnecessary to mention that
this is now a very strong point. It is exemplified by the editions of
the *Morte d’Arthur* produced for students, nor less indeed by those
which have been modified in the interests of children, and in which a
large space is given always to the Graal legend. Andrew Lang's *Book of
Romance* and Mary McLeod's *Book of King Arthur and his Noble Knights*
are instances which will occur to several people, but there are yet
others, and they follow one another, even to this moment, a shadowy
masque, not excepting, at a far distance, certain obscure and truly
illiterate versions in dim byways of periodical literature.

\(2\) The Poetic, and having regard to what has been said already, I
need only for my present purpose affirm that it has done much to exalt
and spiritualise the legend without removing the romantic element; but I
speak here of modern invention. In the case of Tennyson it has certainly
added the elevated emotion which belongs essentially to the spirit of
romance, and this saved English literature during the second half of the
nineteenth century. But taking the work at its highest, it may still be
that the Graal legend must wait to receive its treatment more fully by
some poet who is to come. The literary form assumed by the Graal *Idyll
of the King*--a tale within a tale twice-told--leaves something to be
desired. Many stars rise over many horizons, including those of
literature, but there is one star of the morning,

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

and this in most cycles of books is rather an expected glory than a dawn
now visible

\(3\) The Archæological, and this includes naturally many branches, each
of which has the character of a learned inquiry calling for special
knowledge, and, in several instances, it is only of limited interest
beyond the field of scholarship.

Outside these admitted branches of presentation and research, which lie,
so to speak, upon the surface of current literature, there is perhaps a
fourth point of view which is now in course of emerging, though scarcely
into public view, as it is only in an accidental and a sporadic fashion
that it has entered as yet into the written word. For want of a better
term it must be called spiritual. It cares little for the archæology of
the subject, little for its romantic aspects, and possibly something
less than little for the poetic side. It would scarcely know of Hawker's
*Quest*--not that it signifies vitally--and would probably regard the
Graal symbol as I have otherwise characterised it--as one of the legends
of the soul--I should have said again, sacramental legends, but this
point of view is not usual, nor is it indeed found to any important
extent, among those who hold extreme or any Eucharistic views. In other
words, it is not specially a high Anglican or a Latin interest; it
characterises rather those who regard religious doctrine, institute and
ritual, as things typical or analogical, without realising that as such
they are to be ranked among channels of grace. So far as their
conception has been put clearly to themselves, for them the Graal is an
early recognition of the fact that doctrinal teachings are symbols and
are no more meant for literal acceptance than any express fables. It is
also a hazardous inquiry into obscure migrations of doctrine from East
to 'West, outside the Christian aspects of Graal literature. This view
appreciates, perhaps, only in an ordinary degree the evidence of
history, nor can history be said to endorse it in its existing forms of
presentation. At the same time it is much too loose

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

and indeterminate to be classed as a philosophical construction of
certain facts manifested in the life of a literature. It is a
consideration of several serious but not fully equipped minds, and in
some cases it has been impeded by its sentimental aspects; but the
reference which I have made to it enables me to add that it should have
reached a better term in stronger and surer hands. No one, however
indifferent--or, indeed, of all unobservant--can read the available
romances without seeing that the legend has its spiritual side, but it
has also, at the fact's value, that side which connects it with
folk-lore. No further afield than the *Morte d’Arthur*, which here
follows the great French Quest among many antecedents, it is treated
openly as an allegory, and the chivalry of King Arthur's Court passes
explicitly during the Graal adventures into a region of similitude,
where every episode has a supernatural meaning, which is explained
sometimes in rather a tiresome manner. I say this under the proper
reserves, because that which appears conventional and to some extent
even trivial in these non-metaphrastic portions might prove, under the
light of interpretation, of all truth and the grace thereto belonging.

Superfluities and interpretations notwithstanding, it is directly, or
indirectly, out of the recent view, thus tentatively designated, that
the consideration of the present thesis emerges as its final term,
though out of all knowledge thereof.

It has been my object to remove a great possibility from hands which are
worthy, and that certainly, but unconsecrated by special knowledge, and
it is my intention to return it thereto by a gift of grace after
changing the substance thereof.

In searching out mysteries of this order, it must be confessed that we
are like Manfred in the course of an evocation, for, in truth, many
things answer us; amidst the confusion of tongues it is therefore no
light task to distinguish that which, for my part, I recognise as

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

the true voice. The literature does, however, carry on its surface the
proof rather than the suggestion of a hidden motive as well as a hidden
meaning, and three sources of evidence can be cited on the authority of
the texts: (*a*) Confessed allegory, but this would be excluded, except
for one strong consideration. The mind which confesses to allegory
confesses also to mysticism, this being the mode of allegory carried to
the *ne plus ultra* degree. (*b*) Ideological metathesis, the presence
of which is not to be confused with allegory. (*c*) Certain traces and
almost inferential claims which tend to set the custodians of the Holy
Graal in a position superior to that of the orthodox church, though the
cycle is not otherwise hostile to the orthodox church.

It must be understood that the critical difficulties of the Graal
literature are grave within their own lines, and the authorities thereon
are in conflict over issues which from their own standpoint may be
occasionally not less than vital. This notwithstanding, the elements of
the Graal problem really lie within a comparatively small compass,
though they are scattered through a literature which is in no sense
readily accessible, while it is, for the most part, in a language that
is not exactly familiar to the reader of modern French. It has so far
been in the hands of those who, whatever their claims, have no horizon
outside the issues of folk-lore, and who, like other specialists, have
been a little disposed to create, on the basis of their common
agreement, a certain orthodoxy among themselves, recognising nothing
beyond their particular canons of criticism and the circle of their
actual interests. To these canons there is no reason that we should
ourselves take exception; they are more than excellent in their way,
only they do not happen to signify, except antecedently and
provisionally, for the higher consequence with which we are here
concerned. The sincerity of scholarship imputes to it a certain
sanctity, but in respect of this consequence most scholarship has its
eyes bandaged.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

The interpretation of books is often an essay in enchantment, a rite of
evocation which calls, and the souls of the dead speak in response in
strange voices. To those who are acquainted with the mysteries, perhaps
there are no books which respond in the same manner as these old
sacraments of mystic chivalry. They speak at the very least our own
language. I conclude, therefore, that the most decorative of quests in
literature is that of the things that are eternal; God is the proper
quest of the romantic spirit, and of God moveth not only the *High
History of the Holy Graal*, but the book of enchantment which I have
proposed to myself thereon.

And even now, as if amidst bells and Hosannahs, a clear voice utters the
*Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus*--because by this undertaking we have
declared ourselves on God's side.
