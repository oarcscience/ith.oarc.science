### II

#### THE GOOD HUSBANDMAN

At the risk of some repetition on a subject of all so vital, I will put
the position thus from another standpoint. The value of the Graal
legends resides in their suggestions and lights towards a concordat of
Divine Alliance, while the Graal Castle is the House of Alliance and of
the doctrine thereto belonging. The same description applies to the
Sanctuaries of the other schools, on the understanding that in the last
resource all the Sanctuaries are one. They do not differ from the
external Houses of Doctrine into which we were born and wherein we were
first nourished by the food of souls. Here also--if we set apart
innumerable temples of the fantastic spirit--the House of Doctrine is
one, and the official does not differ from the mystical; but in the one
House there are many chambers, being those of the soul's advancement,
and the soul in response to its election proceeds by stage and by stage
on the ascent upward--or beyond and further beyond into that more secret
place which lies behind the sanctuary of the Visible Church. The
correspondence in identity hereto is the oratory of the spiritual
alchemist, who testifies by first-hand experience at the Fountain of
Nature and Grace that nothing has been lost, that he has himself
recovered the working process in which the Trinity is manifested and the
plan of redemption is exhibited.

The Graal literature was the spiritual emotion of the Church expressed
in romance. The texts which do not correspond to this description are of
no importance as mystic texts of the legend. I set apart, however, the
lost poem of Guiot, which will be considered in another section. The
high texts of all are products of monasticism, and--as they are extant
among us--the vision

<span id="page_621">p. 621</span>

which is the true Graal came out of cells and scriptoria. We must not go
further for that which is ready to our hand in the nearest places. The
monks conceived the high miracle of sanctity and connected it with a
wonderful and pious legend. They knew so much that they knew also the
void in the heart of the age and the maiming of the outer Church. The
efficacious Graal--that which alone profits us--came out of their fasts,
watches and prayers. They did not invent the Secret Words and the
super-apostolical priesthood, but they knew of these rumours; they knew
that many strange quests were pursued about them; they dreamed of
mysteries of sanctity which they had not fathomed, and we can well
understand that the story of Prester John re-expressed the dream after a
manner of parable in their yearning minds. When they left the House of
Doctrine void in respect of its chief Hallow, they meant only that the
Church shared on its manifest side the inhibition of the age; they felt
all that was wanting thereto. But the first makers of texts had heard of
those things more plainly--that is, of a priesthood within the
priesthood, of a Mass behind the Mass, or rather the equivalents of
these by the pursuit of an experiment which was identical with that of
the Church carried--as I have said--to an advanced degree. The putative
letter of Prester John was perhaps invented expressly to put this claim
forward in a singularly evasive manner, but one certain to attract
universal interest and attention.

The experiment had been pursued everywhere, the aphorism which ruled it
being *omnia exeunt in mysterium*, the pursuit of that Mystery to which
St. Augustine alluded when he said that Christianity had been always in
the world--to which the New Testament itself alluded when speaking of
the Lamb slain from the foundation of the cosmic order. It follows that
any one who suggests that the experiment or the school became Christian
at a certain epoch is in error over the elements of that subject to
which must be attributed

<span id="page_622">p. 622</span>

in a superlative sense the *locus communis* of the ecclesiastical test:
*Quod semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus*. We should remember that
things which concur with one another do of necessity find one another at
a certain point of their extension; the one Quest adopts many veils, but
without diminution of identity. It has been disguised very often under
the old formula concerning words of power, but though this is a
necessary illustration, it carries a suggestion of fatality, because in
no instance did the sign survive the idea--and so lapse into
superstition--more frequently or with greater facility. In its proper
understanding it corresponds to the idea of an union between the
expressed consciousness of the soul and the Word of God--the *verbum
caro factum*, declaring itself in the world and in the heart of man.
Robert de Borron heard or read of the rumour in some such form and he
combined it with secret words of Christ. He knew so little of its
horizon that he left it an open question whether the words were
Eucharistic or not. Those who converted his work into prose concluded
that they could have no other office, and so allocated them accordingly.
The author of the *Book of the Holy Graal*, having certain materials,
including those which were incorporated in his prologue, put forward the
rumour in the guise of a sacerdotal mystery and followed those who had
preceded him in developing the conversion legend. Guiot de Provence
represented the secret custodians as an autonomous chivalry after the
model of the Knights Templars, bringing into it materials from oriental
sources. Other traditions had already presented Joseph of Arimathæa as
the Grand Master of an instituted knighthood. The authors of the *Longer
Prose Perceval* and the *Quest of Galahad* saw that the whole subject
belonged to the Church, and they connected it with Eucharistic
transubstantiation as the most approximate gate through which
supernatural faith could follow those things which issue in mystery.
They were glad enough when their

<span id="page_623">p. 623</span>

symbolism had served its purpose to allow its dissolution, as I have
shown, and it has been in no sense my design to suggest that they had
overcome all burdens of their period by an excess of wisdom; the glass
through which they looked was clouded and scoriated enough, and in
manifesting the doctrine as they did I suppose that its intolerable
sense had never occurred to them. It is sufficient for our purpose that
they discerned something of the secrets which lay beyond, to do which
they must have travelled far. I am sure also that in common with the
independent schools of concealment they distinguished between the Church
as the custodian of Rite, Symbol and Doctrine and the seat of government
at Rome. In this connection it is wholesome to remember, among many
other points that might be enumerated: (1) That before 1000 A.D.
Claudius, Archbishop of Turin, characterised the censure pronounced on
his anti-papal writings as the voice of the members of Satan; (2) that
Arnulph, the Bishop of Orleans, at the Council of Rheims pointed to the
Roman Pontiff, saying: "Who is that seated upon a high throne and
radiant with purple and gold? . . . If he thus follow uncharitableness,
. . . he must be Antichrist sitting in the Temple of God; (3) that
Everard, Bishop of Salzburg, said much later: "He who is the *servus
servorum Dei* desires to be lord of lords; he profanes, he pillages, he
defrauds, he robs, he murders, and he is the lost man who is called
Antichrist; (4) that Cardinal Benno, speaking of Sylvester II., said
that by God's permission he rose from the abyss; (5) that the same pope
was described at the Council of Brixen as the false monk and the prince
of abomination. These were the accusations of prelates and with them may
be compared the opinion of Figueiras the troubadour, who described Rome
as an immoral and faithless city, having its seat fixed in the depths of
hell; that of Petrarch, who called Avignon the western Babylon, and--as
a comparison by way of antithesis with the Rich Fisherman--exclaimed:

<span id="page_624">p. 624</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Here reigns a
proud race of fishermen who are poor no longer;" and that of the same
poet who described the papal court as a people who follow the example of
Judas Iscariot--in other words, selling God for money, like the King of
Castle Mortal. So also St. Bridget termed Rome the whirlpool of hell and
the house of mammon, wherein the devil barters the patrimony of Christ.

I think it has been indicated abundantly in the course of this work, but
more especially in the present sections, that the high truth is in all
Church doctrine, and therefore in citing these instances I also am far
from expressing the spirit of impeachment; but on the side of policy,
apart from that of teaching, there is evidence enough that the yoke was
no longer easy nor the burden light. It is conceivable that the symbol
of the voided House of Doctrine was an appeal against the Church in so
far as it had been unfaithful to itself, a protest against the spirit of
the world which had invaded the sanctuary. The admission of these facts
does not derogate from the claim that the Church had all the means. Even
in new definitions and altered practice there may have been a guiding
hand. It will be suggested, I know, that at the period of the Graal
literature two unhappy ferments were working in the Western branch: (1)
The denial of the chalice; (2) the various doctrinal tendencies which
resulted in the definition of transubstantiation. From this point of
view the wound of the Latin Church would be that it misconstrued the
*Mysterium Fidei;* that it had, in fact, five wounds corresponding to
the five changes of the Graal. Of these changes the last only seemed to
be a chalice, for at that time it is said that there was no chalice, and
the mystic reason of this is that the *Dominus qui non pars est sed
totum* is not contained in a chalice though the Lord is *Pars
hereditatis meæ et calicis mei*. The Latin Church cannot be accused of
having failed to discern the Body of the Lord, but it may be advanced
that its discernment, like that of the Greek orthodoxy, was apart from
the life which their

<span id="page_625">p. 625</span>

own scriptures tell them is resident in the blood--that is to say, it is
the symbolical seat thereof. And yet on the basis of transubstantiation
it is difficult to reject the Roman plea, that he who receives the Body
receives also the Blood, because that which is communicated in the
Eucharist is the living Christ made Flesh. To this it may be rejoined
that the implicit of the symbolism is really in the contrary sense, that
the elements are dual to show how the flesh of itself profits nothing,
while the spirit and the truth are in the communication of Divine Life.
By those who regard transubstantiation as the burden of the Church which
defined it, there is a disposition to consider the Latin Eucharist as
only a dismembered sacrament; by those who look upon it simply as a
memorial, all subtleties notwithstanding, there is a feeling that the
memory is broken and that the isolated sign does not signify fully. On
the other hand, that view which belongs more especially to the Mystics,
namely, that the covenant of Christ to his followers concerns what I
have called so frequently the communication of Divine Substance, will, I
think, be aware that the accidents of such a communication are not of
vital consequence; that perhaps the official Church was even more subtle
than it knew, because it is certain that transposition or substitution
in the external signs cannot occasion even the shadow of vicissitude in
the mystery which is imparted. In fine, to extinguish these questions,
those who speak of Christ's spiritual presence say well, but the mystery
of abiding redemption is the perpetuity of the incarnation in that
Church to which Christ came in flesh.

In conclusion, I do not confess that it would be putting the case truly
if it were said that at the period of the Graal literature the highest
minds of the Church had grown weary of the Vatican and all its ways. I
think that for long, and for very long indeed, there had existed an
uncompetitive stream of tendency which raised no voice, but pursued its
path unobtrusively

<span id="page_626">p. 626</span>

towards a very high term. It had no remedies to offer on the practical
side of things and it was too wise to denounce abuses which it was
powerless to remedy--even as I who write, supposing that I had attained
the term of the Great Experiment, should not for that reason be
qualified to purify the commercial houses of exchange. That term belongs
to a region about which it is idle to speak in connection with schemes
of amelioration or the raising of the masses. So far as those who have
pursued or do now follow it have led or to-day lead the life of the
world, it is implied in their calling that they should do what to do is
given them, but in respect of the Experiment itself, those who attain
can lead others on the way, but they do not bring back helping hands for
the furtherance and welfare of the body politic. So much for the stream
of tendency in the earlier times. At a later period I do think that the
unknown mystics who wrote upon spiritual alchemy had got to see not only
where the path of sanctity led, but that the Church as a whole had lost
the power of leading.

They were made circumspect by the anxiety of their position, and they
spoke only in parables.
