##### § *B*.--THE POEM OF CHRÉTIEN DE TROYES

By our previous considerations we have ascertained that after certain
preliminary matters which are curious, but late in comparison and
dubious, the *Conte del Graal* was opened in ample form by a
master-singer of his period--that is to say, by Chrétien de Troyes. Now,
if it be agreed that the *Peredur* and *Syr Percyvelle* are reflections
of a lost primordial quest, it is desirable to note that they offer
nothing concerning the feast of good things and the Bowl of Plenty. How,
therefore, from the standpoint of scholarship, did this element,
confessedly foreign thereto, in the beginning of things, come to be
imported therein? There is no trace of it, as we have seen, in the long
section of that great poem which is now set for our consideration,
though it is supposed to have heralded and inaugurated everything which
belongs to the seeking part of the Graal literature. It was not
evidently from this source in folk-lore that Chrétien derived his
knowledge of that mysterious object which he calls a Graal and from
which was diffused so great a light, though nowhere in his long
contribution does he term it the Holy Graal. It was carried by the maid
who had charge of it in her two hands, from which it may follow either
that it was a heavy object, as might be a large dish, or something
exceedingly sacred--to be exalted with reverence--as it might be, an
Eucharistic Chalice or a most holy Reliquary. That it was not certainly
the first of these objects is made evident by the fact that a Dish was
carried separately in the pageant at the Graal Castle. We know further
from the brief description that it was a jewelled vessel:--

"Pières pressieuses avoit  
El graal, de maintes manières,  
Des plus rices et des plus cières  
Qui el mont u en tière soient;  
Tote autre pières pasoient  
Celes dou grèal, sans dotance."

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That it connects
with the second or the third in my enumeration of possible objects is
shown at a much later stage to Perceval in the narrative of his uncle
the hermit, who tells how some hidden King of the Graal is sustained and
comforted by a Sacred Host therein. Whencesoever the German poet
Heinrich drew his materials, it is obvious that he and Chrétien speak of
the same vessel and, as I have shown otherwise, rather of a *ciborium*
than a Reliquary. The essence of a Reliquary is that it should contain
an invariable sacred deposit, as, for example, the Precious Blood of our
Saviour or the liquefying blood of St. Januarius. We are therefore at
once in the region of great sacramental wonders. The legends of sanctity
had already in far other texts borne witness to those cases in which the
supersensual Bread of Life had served for the saints as their only daily
nourishment. This is therefore the manner in which Chrétien de Troyes
understood--had he indeed heard of them--the feeding properties of the
Graal. It follows--and we shall see duly--that three poets--Wolfram,
Heinrich and Chrétien--who are at the poles sometimes in variance over
matters of symbolism, do yet, in the most important of all their
concerns, tell the same story. And we who know better than they could
have ever known all that is involved in the root-matter of their
testimony, can say in our hearts, even when we hear these dim echoes
which are far from the term of the Quest:--

"Tu qui cuncta scis et vales,  
Qui nos pascis hic mortales,  
Tuos ibi commensales,  
Cohæredes et sodales  
Fac sanctorum civium."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We have no doubt
as to the service or the table, and can bear witness on our own part
that " many men, both of high and low condition in these last years
past," have to our knowledge seen the mystery of all sacredness and
sweetness unveiled before their spiritual eyes. It follows that if there
were many antecedents, the Graal is still one,

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

and that even at the epoch of Chrétien the true nature of the Sacred
Vessel was known, and that clearly. Of himself the poet knew nothing,
but in some book which he followed there must have been strange
materials. One of the keynotes may be--among many others--that Hugh,
Bishop of Lincoln, investigated about 1140 a case of miraculous
sustenance by the Eucharist.

As regards the source of his story the poet himself gives us an
exceedingly simple explanation. He says that he wrote by command of a
certain Count--that is to say, Count Philip of Flanders. The order
was:--

"À rimoir le mellor conte  
Qui soit contés en court roial."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The materials were
written materials, namely, *li contes del Gréal*, as to which *li Quens
li bailla le livre*. Such was the source of the earliest Quest-matter;
and the earliest extant History-matter depends also from a great book,
wherein great clerks wrote "the great secrets which are called the
Graal":--

"Ge n’ose conter ne retreire,  
Ne ge ne le pourroie feire,  
Neis, se je feire le voloie,  
Se je le grant livre n’avoie  
Où les estoires sunt escrites,  
Par les granz clers feites et dites:  
La sunt li grant secré escrit  
Qu’en nvmme le Graal et dit."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Whereas therefore
his patron communicated to Chrétien, it was Robert de Borron who
communicated to Walter Montbéliard, in whose service he was. We see in
this manner that the first poet of the *Conte del Graal* depended on
antecedent authority which was not of the oral kind; by one stage the
question of source raised here has been moved back, and there must be
left for the present.

We saw in the Welsh Perceval that there was a sword which broke and was
rejoined, but in the stress of the last trial it was shattered beyond
recovery. The episode in Chrétien which corresponds hereto is
represented

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

sufficiently for my purpose by the details already given when
considering the Hallows of the Legend. I may add only that while certain
codices make no attempt to account for the return of the Broken Sword to
the Graal Castle, there are others which illustrate the foreknowledge of
the king by his despatch of a messenger to follow Perceval in his
travels till the mischance of the promised peril overtakes him. In yet
others the fragments of the mystic weapon seem to have been spirited
away. It will be seen that in the Welsh Perceval there is nothing to
connect the maiming of the Lord of the Castle with the gigantic Lance
which is carried about therein. The connection remains naturally a
reasonable inference, but we cannot tell. The Sword certainly serves no
purpose but that of a trial of strength. In Chrétien it appears, on the
other hand, almost as a part of the plot, and the scheme is carried out
by the sequels in accordance with so much as may be called manifest in
the intention of the first poet.

Turning from the Hallows of the story, it so happens that it is after
the manner of Chrétien to furnish his most important elucidations with
the least suggestion of intention. I have spoken of the mystery of that
Chamber wherein the Graal enters or re-enters after its manifestation in
the pageant, or into which alternatively the dove flies in one Quest of
the Greater Chronicles, before the Sacred Vessel is displayed. It is
Chrétien only who discloses the secret of the hidden place, or at least
manifests up to what point he understands it himself, when he says of
the king, whom I interpret as sometime king of the Graal:--

". xx . ans i a estet ensi.  
Que fors de la cambre n’issi  
Ù le Gréal véis entrer."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It was the
bedchamber of that Warden of the Hallows who was far more concealed than
he who is called or miscalled the Rich Fisher in the same text. The
further question which arises for our consideration

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

concerns, therefore, this nameless being who is the father of the king
in evidence. The allusions to him are so brief and so vague that those
who continued the story thought it best to ignore them, though I hold it
as certain that Gautier had the elements of an explanation in his hands.
Without forestalling what there is to say on this point in the next
sub-section, I will refer back to an earlier part of our inquiry, when
it was noted that the quest in Chrétien presupposes an early history
and--notwithstanding certain 1 confusions, as, for example, regarding
the origin of the title King Fisherman--that this history may have
corresponded, in respect of its essence, to the first draft of the
metrical romance by Robert de Borron, or alternatively to the source
from which the latter drew, and in which it may be hazarded that there
seem to have been several histories. It is too early to speculate
whether the texts which had come into the possession of the pious
minstrel included the single story which the Count of Flanders placed in
the hands of Chrétien, but there must have been a general prototype.
Apart from the *Longer Prose Perceval*, which is extra-lineal in most
details of its tradition, there are three persons connected immediately
with the Graal in the various quests. In the *Parsifal of Wolfram* there
are (*a*) Titurel--precisely in the position of the mysterious king in
Chrétien, and like him abdicated; (*b*) the reigning king Amfortas, who
is fed by the Graal; and (*c*) Parsifal, the king who is to come. In the
quest of Galahad there are (*a*) the maimed king, Pellehan; (*b*) the
reigning king, Pelles; and (*c*) Galahad, the king who is to come. In
the *Didot Perceval* there are (*a*) Brons, who is sick of the
centuries, but still the Graal king; (*b*) his i son Alain, but in this
case he dies, without it being possible for us to assign his special
place in the mystery; and (*c*) Perceval, as a coming king who is in the
warfare of his training. Now, this notion of a triple guardianship was
first put forward in the romance

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

of De Borron, and is evidently one of the root-ideas of the historical
branches; and if in a certain sense it is broken in the *Book of the
Holy Graal* to establish some phantom of a chronological succession, the
Quest which follows therefrom recurs, as we see, thereto. I should add
that the Royal Family of the Holy Graal--in the story of Chrétien and
its sequels--has no names in the canonical texts till Perceval comes
into his own, but there is a variant or interpolation in a Berne
manuscript which follows the keepership in De Borron.

Separating from the poem of Chrétien not merely the prologue, which is
by another hand, but an introductory part which is also of uncertain
authorship, while it has elements in rather close correspondence with
the Welsh *Mabinogi* of Peredur, and adhering to the more authentic poem
itself, there is a diversity of the circumstances under which Perceval
was born whereby it is set apart from the Welsh story and from the
English poem. In the introduction there are variants from these, but
they are matters of detail. According to Chrétien, it is the maiming of
Perceval's father which takes the family into the woods. Perceval is the
youngest of three sons, and the time comes for the others to be sent
into the world. They are commissioned to the courts of two kings, where
they are both knighted on the same day, and, though widely separated,
both are also slain. It is this misfortune which causes the death of the
father and the desire on the mother's part to isolate her remaining boy
from all knowledge of chivalry. While the result is a certain
inexperience, he does not seem so savage or untrained as in the texts
which we have considered previously, and the surroundings of his
father's house are those of a knight who has retired to a country estate
on account of his health. Seeing that there is nothing so little to my
purpose as to be at any unnecessary pains regarding the conventional
story part of successive texts, I shall deal very shortly with points of
minor variation in the life and adventures of the hero, and as regards
the major episodes, they may

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

be thus recited in summary:--The adventure of the Pavilion; the initial
visit to the Court of King Arthur; the struggle with the Red Knight; the
sojourn with an instructor in chivalry; the liberation of that Lady of
the Castle who is here named Blanchefleur; the first visit to the House
of the Graal; the meeting with Perceval's kinswoman afterwards; the
exoneration of the Lady of the Pavilion; the search of the King and his
knights after the hero whom they had once rejected almost; the
love-trance; the denunciation of Perceval by the laidly damosel; his
godless wanderings; the episode of Good Friday; the renewal of grace
which he receives at the hands of a hermit, who--in this case--is his
uncle: all these follow in due order, and though it is not throughout
the exact order which we find in the Welsh *Mabinogi*, that text remains
the artificial prototype representing the early narrative portion, and
to this Chrétien has added the Holy Graal as his ostensible motive in
chief. The first sojourn of Perceval at the Graal Castle takes place in
the absence of any design on the part of the hero; he is not, in other
words, on the Quest of the Sacred Vessel and he knew nothing about it.
When he has liberated Blanchefleur from her thraldom in the castle of
Beaurepaire, his avowed quest is that which will bring him to his
mother, but when he has found her he will return to the maiden, will
marry her and share her rule. The other maiden who reproaches him for
his failure immediately after his departure from the Graal Castle is his
cousin-german instead of his foster-sister, and in addition to his
responsibility in respect of his mother's death, she denounces him for
not asking the redeeming questions concerning the Vessel and the Lance.
In this manner the subsequent reproaches of the laidly damosel at the
Court of King Arthur--which is in camp on the quest of Perceval, and not
at Caerleon--concern a twice-told tale. The adventures of Perceval are
carried by Chrétien as far as his visit to that uncle who has embraced
the life of a hermit.
