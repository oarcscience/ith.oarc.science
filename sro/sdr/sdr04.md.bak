### PART III

### THE SOUL OF THE WORLD

In the Secret Doctrine of the Rosicrucians we find the following Second
Aphorism:

#### The Second Aphorism

**II. The Germ within the Cosmic Egg takes unto itself Form. The Flame
is re-kindled. Time begins. A Thing exists. Action begins. The Pairs of
Opposites spring into being. The World Soul is born, and awakens into
manifestation. The first rays of the new Cosmic Day break over the
horizon**.

In this Second Aphorism of Creation the Rosicrucian is directed to apply
his attention to the concept of the World Soul—the First Manifestation
of the Eternal Parent. This World Soul—the First Manifestation—is
represented by the Rosicrucians by the symbol of a circle containing at
its centre a black dot or point. The circle, of course, represents the
Infinite Unmanifest, and the black dot or point represents the Focal
Point of the new Manifestation—the "Germ within the Cosmic Egg," as the
old occultists poetically expressed the idea.

The Rosicrucian concept of the World Soul—the First
Manifestation—corresponds to similar conceptions found, in various
forms, in most of the ancient occult teachings of the several great
esoteric schools of philosophy. In some philosophies it is known as the
"Anima Mundi," or Life of the World, Soul of

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

the World, or World Spirit. In others it is known as the Logos, or Word.
In others, as the Demiurge. The spirit of the concept is this: that from
the unconditioned essence of Infinite Unmanifestation there arose an
Elemental and Universal Soul, clothed in the garments of the most
tenuous, elemental form of Matter, which contained within itself the
potency

and latent possibility of all the future universes of the new Cosmic
Circle, or Cosmic Day. This World Soul is spoken of in the Second
Aphorism as "The Germ within the Cosmic Egg," inasmuch as it is regarded
as the tiny germ within the egg which gradually increases in size and
complexity, and takes upon itself Form and Activity.

The symbol of the Cosmic Egg, of which the World Soul is the Animating
Germ, is a very old one, and

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

one widely spread in usage in the ancient world. As a prominent
occultist has said: "Whence this universal symbol? The Egg was
incorporated as a sacred sign in the cosmogony of every people on the
earth, and was revered both on account of its form and its inner
mystery. From the earliest mental conceptions of man, it was known as
that which represented most successfully the Origin and Secret of Being.
The gradual development of the imperceptible Germ within the closed
shell; the inward working, without any apparent outward interference of
force, which from a latent nothing produced an active something, needing
nought save heat; and which, having gradually evolved into a concrete,
living creature, broke its shell, appearing to the outward senses of all
a self-generated, and self-created being—must have been a standing
miracle from the beginning.

"The secret teaching explains the reason for this reference by the
[symbolism](errata.htm#1.md) of the prehistoric races. The 'First Cause'
had no name in the beginnings. Later, it was pictured in the fancy of
the thinkers as an ever invisible Bird that dropped an Egg into Chaos,
which Egg became the Universe. Hence, Brahm was called 'Kalahansa,' the
Swan of Eternity which laid at the beginning of each Mahamanvantara a
'Golden Egg.' It typifies the great Circle, or O, itself a symbol for
the universe and its spherical bodies. \* \* \* The first manifestation
of the Kosmos in the form of an egg was the most widely diffused belief
of antiquity. It was a symbol adopted among the Greeks, the Syrians,
Persians, and Egyptians. In the Egyptian Ritual, Seb, the god of Time
and of the Earth, is spoken of as having laid an egg, or the Universe.
Ra is shown like Brahma gestating

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

in the Egg of the Universe. With the Greeks the Orphic Egg was a part of
the Dionysiac and other mysteries, during which the Mundane Egg was
consecrated and its significance explained. The Christians—especially
the Greek and Latin Churches—have fully adopted this symbol, and see in
it a commemoration of life eternal, or salvation and resurrection. This
is found in and corroborated by the custom of 'Easter Eggs.' From the
'Egg' of the pagan Druids, to the red Easter Egg of the Slav, a cycle
has passed. And, yet, whether in civilized Europe, or among the abject
savages of Central America, we find the same archaic, primitive thought;
if we only search for it and do not disfigure—in the haughtiness of our
fancied mental and physical superiority—the original idea of the
symbol."

The concept of the World Soul, in some form of interpretation and under
some one of many names, may be said to be practically universal. Among
many of the ancient schools of philosophy it was taught that there was
an Anima Mundi, or World Soul, of which all the individual souls were
but apparently separated (though not actually separated) units. The
conviction that Life was One is expressed through nearly all of the best
of ancient philosophies; and, in fact, in subtly disguised forms, may be
said to rest at the base of the best of modern philosophies.

In the philosophical concept of the Logos, we find another, and more
advanced, form of this same fundamental concept. The term, Logos, first
became prominent in the philosophy of Heraclitus of Ephesus, where it
appears as the Law of Nature, objective in the world, giving order and
regularity to the

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

movement of things. The Logos formed an important part of the Stoic
System of Philosophy. The Active Principle, abiding in the world, they
called the Logos, the term being likewise applied to the Universal
Productive Cause. An authority on the history of philosophy has said of
the concept of the Logos: "The Logos, a being intermediate between God
and the World, is diffused through the world of the senses. The Logos
does not exist from Eternity like God, and yet its genesis is not like
our own and that of all other created beings. It is the First-Begotten
of God, and is for us imperfect beings almost as a God. Through the
agency of the Logos, God created the World."

In the philosophical concept of the Demiurge, we find another form of
the same fundamental concept. The Demiurge was the name given by the
Platonian philosophers to an exalted and mysterious agent by whom God
was supposed to have created the universe. He was akin to the Nature-God
of the Pantheists, and to the "Living Nature" of other schools of
philosophy. The Demiurge was the Life of the World, or Universal Life,
of which all the innumerable lives of finite creatures are but sparks in
the flame or drops of water in the ocean. And, yet, in its true sense,
the concept of the Demiurge was not identified with that of God, but was
rather a concept of the First Great Manifestation of God, by means of
which He creates and sustains the World.

The idea of a Universal Will, a primal manifestation of God, existing at
the Heart of Nature, and operating to build up and sustain the Universe,
is found in many modern philosophies. Cudsworth, the English philosopher
has sought to indicate this conception in his idea of "Plastic Nature,"
of which

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

he says: "It seems not so agreeable that Nature, as a distinct thing
from the Deity, should be quite superseded or made to signifying
nothing, God Himself doing all things immediately and miraculously; from
whence it would follow also that they are all done either forcibly and
violently, or else artificially only, and none of them by any inward
principle of their own. This opinion is further confuted by that slow
and gradual process that in the generation of things, which would seem
to be but a vain and idle pomp or a trifling formality if the moving
power were omnipotent; as also by those errors and bungles which are
committed where the matter is inept and contumacious; which argue that
the moving power be not irresistible, and that Nature is such a thing as
is not altogether incapable (as well as human art) of being sometimes
frustrated and disappointed by the indisposition of matter. Whereas an
omnipotent moving power, as it could dispatch its work in a moment, so
would it always do it infallibly and irresistibly, no ineptitude and
[stubbornness](errata.htm#2.md) of matter being ever able to hinder such a
one, or make him bungle or fumble in anything.

"Therefore, since neither all things are produced fortuitously, or by
the unguided mechanism of matter, nor God himself may be reasonably
thought to do all things immediately and miraculously, it may well be
concluded that there is a Plastic Nature under him, which, as an
inferior end subordinate instrument, doth drudgingly execute that part
of his providence which consists in the regular and orderly motion of
matter; yet so as there is also besides this a higher providence to be
acknowledged, which, presiding over it, doth often supply the defects of
it, and sometimes overrules it, forasmuch as the Plastic

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nature cannot act
electively nor with discretion."

Other schools of philosophy, notably that founded by Schopenhauer, have
postulated the presence of a Universal Spirit (whose chief attribute is
Desire-Will) from whom the universe of creatures has proceeded. This
Universal Spirit is held to be filled with a longing, craving, seeking,
striving desire to express itself in phenomenal existence. Schopenhauer
calls it "The Will to Live." It is described as **instinctive** rather
than intellectual, and as creating intellect with which to better serve
its purposes of self-expression. Other philosophers have proceeded along
the main lines of the concept of Schopenhauer, with various
modifications. The same idea is expressed by some of the old Buddhistic
philosophers, the very term "The Will-to-Live" being used to express the
essential nature of the Universal Spirit. But, it must be noted, in such
philosophies the Universal Spirit is considered rather as the Eternal
Parent than as its First Manifestation. In the same way a certain school
of thinkers postulate the existence of a "Living Nature," which
expresses itself in innumerable living creatures and things—all Things
in the universe being held to possess Life in some form and degree, as,
indeed, the Rosicrucian creatures also hold.

But it must be always noted that in the Secret Doctrine of the
Rosicrucians the World Soul is not regarded as the Infinite Reality, but
merely as the First Manifestation thereof, from which all subsequent
manifestations proceed and into which they are finally resolved. The
World Soul is not Eternal, but, on the contrary, appears and disappears
according to the rhythm of the Cosmic Nights and Days.

The Second Aphorism states: **"The Flame is rekindled."**

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Dark Light
once more bursts into Flame throughout the form of the World Soul, and
the new Universe begins.

It also states: **"Time begins."** This is seen to be true because
Change has begun, and Change is the essence of Time, and Time the
measure of Change.

Again: **"A Thing exists."** This because the World Soul is truly a
Thing, with all the characteristics of Thingness. It can be defined and
described in positive terms; it can be thought of logically and in terms
of intellect, though perhaps not capable of being pictured in the
imagination.

Again: **"Action begins."** This because from the very inception of the
Germ in the Cosmic Egg there is the manifestation of Activity, Motion,
and Change. The World Soul is in constant and uninterrupted activity
from the moment of its faintest dawn until the moment of its expiring
quiver.

Again: **"The Pairs of Opposites spring into being."** As all Thingness
is accompanied by the presence of the Pairs of Opposites—the contrasting
sets of qualities, it follows that from the first faint breath of the
World Spirit differentiation begins, and the polarity of qualities
exhibit themselves.

Again: **"The World Soul is born, and awakens into manifestation."** The
World Soul awakens into active manifestation from the very moment of its
birth. Finding within itself the impelling urge of the Will-to-Live and
of Expression, it proceeds at once, along the lines of elementary
Instinct to prepare for manifestation of higher and more complex forms
of life and action.

Again: **"The first rays of the new Cosmic Day break over the
horizon."** With the coming of the World Soul the new Cosmic Day is
indeed begun,

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

and proceeds without interruption until the shades of the Cosmic Night
once more overtake it in cyclic sequence.

The Rosicrucian Teaching is that the World Soul is not a soul lacking a
body, but that, on the contrary, it is clothed in the garments of the
most tenuous and ethereal substance—a substance as much finer and more
ethereal than the Ether of Space, of the material scientists, as the
latter is much finer and more ethereal than the hardest steel or
granite. From this ethereal substance the World Soul weaves bodies for
its manifestations, even the densest forms of matter—and even the
tenuous bodily form of the highest forms of life, far removed from our
comparatively gross earth-plane.

The Rosicrucians further hold that it is not correct to think of the
World Soul as having been created "out of nothing" by the Eternal
Parent, and still less so think of it having been created from the
substantial essence of the Eternal Parent by division, separation, or
partition (such ideas being held to be logically impossible and
fallacious). On the contrary, it is held that the World Soul exists as
an IDEA of the Eternal Parent—just as, in a day dream, or a reverie, or
a full dream, we may picture a Thing as in being. Or in other terms,
even the World Soul exists merely as a PICTURE in the Infinite
Imagination of the Eternal Parent, and at the last is but a SHADOW of
Reality, and not Reality itself.

The World Soul, at the Dawn of the Cosmic Day, may be said to be like a
dreamer freshly awakened from a deep sleep, and striving to regain
consciousness of himself. It does not know what it is, nor does it know
that it is but an Idea of the Eternal Parent. If it could express its
thought in words it

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

would say that it has always been, but had been asleep before that
moment. It feels within itself the urge toward expression and
manifestation, along unconscious and instinctive lines—this urge being a
part of its nature and character and implanted into it by the content of
the Idea of the Eternal Parent which brought it into being. Like the
newborn babe, it struggles for breath and begins to move its limbs. And
as it struggles and moves, there comes to it a response from all of its
nature, and its active life begins. And here we leave the World Soul,
for the moment, struggling for breath and striving to move its limbs
(figuratively speaking, of course). Its future is related in the
succeeding Aphorisms.
