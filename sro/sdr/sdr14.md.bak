### PART XIII

### THE SEVEN COSMIC PRINCIPLES

The Rosicrucians teach that there are Seven Cosmic Principles present
and operating throughout the Cosmos, and extending even to its smallest
activities. These Seven Cosmic Principles are as follows:

<div align="center">

|          |                                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| **I.**   | **The Principle of Correspondence.** |
| **II.**  | **The Principle of Law and Order.**  |
| **III.** | **The Principle of Vibration.**      |
| **IV.**  | **The Principle of Rhythm.**         |
| **V.**   | **The Principle of Cycles.**         |
| **VI.**  | **The Principle of Polarity.**       |
| **VII.** | **The Principle of Sex.**            |

</div>

The student is now asked to consider each of the above stated Cosmic
Principles in detail.

#### I. The Principle of Correspondence

The Principle of Correspondence manifests in a certain correspondence or
analogy or agreement between manifestations of the various planes of
activity in the Cosmos. It is indicated by the old Hermetic aphorism:
"As above, so below; as below, so above," and by the Arcane axiom: "Ex
Uno disce Omnes," or "From One know All." The Rosicrucians, and other
ancient occultists, hold that the laws governing the nature and activity
of the amoeba, likewise govern the nature and activity of man and

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

beings higher than man. What is true of matter is true of energy and of
mind. The occultists make a practical application of this universal
principle, in the direction of studying the unknown by means of the
known, with the knowledge that the same laws govern each. Thus, just as
the solar system may be known by means of studying the atoms and
molecules, so may the higher planes of being be studied by an
examination of the lower planes in manifestation before us.

After discovering the operation of certain principles in one thing we
may safely reason by analogy based upon the assumption that these
principles exist in other things on a higher plane, and thus discover
the nature of the unknown "<span class="smallcaps">x</span>." Thus the
occultist reasons that there is Law and Order manifest on every plane of
being; that there is a Principle of Vibration manifest on every plane of
being; that there is a Principle of Rhythm manifest on every plane of
being; that there is a Principle of Cycles manifest on every plane of
being; that there is a Principle of Polarity manifest on every plane of
being; that there is a Principle of Sex manifest on every plane of
being. And the further that human investigation is pushed into the
Unknown, the greater is the proof of the existence of these Cosmic
Principles reasoned out by the ancient occultists upon the fundamental
basis of the Principle of Correspondence.

A writer has said of this Cosmic Principle: "There is always a
correspondence between the laws and phenomena of the various planes of
life and being. The grasping of this truth gives one the means of
solving many a dark paradox, many a hidden secret of Nature. There are
planes beyond our knowing,

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

but when we apply the Principle of Correspondence to them we are able to
understand much that otherwise would be unknowable to us. This principle
is of universal application and manifestation, on the various planes of
the material, mental and spiritual universe—it is an universal law. The
ancient Hermetists considered this principle as one of the most
important mental instruments by which man was able to pry aside the
obstructions which hid from view the Unknown. Its use even tore aside
the Veil of Isis to the extent that a glimpse of the face of the goddess
might be caught. Just as a knowledge of the principles of Geometry
enables a man to measure distant suns and their movements, while seated
in an observatory, so a knowledge of the Principle of Correspondence
enables man to reason intelligently from the Known to the Unknown.
Studying the moneron, he understands the archangel.

Without going deeply into the matter of the application of this
particular Cosmic Principle, we may say that one of the fundamental
facts of being discovered by the ancient occultists by the application
of the said principle is this: That in every thing there is to be found
(1) Substance, or Body; (2) Motion or Active Energy; and (3)
Consciousness or Awareness. Therefore, when dealing with planes of being
of which, at the time, they had but little knowledge, the ancient
occultists always assumed the existence in everything on the unknown
plane of these three great forms of manifestation. And all future
esoteric investigation and discovery tended to disclose facts
corroborating and sustaining the original assumption derived by analogy,
and the discoveries of modern science have invariably tended in the same
direction.

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It may be
interesting to take a hasty glance at the presence of these three forms
of manifestation, as follows:

**Substance**. The ancient occult teaching that "Everything has body"
seems to be fully corroborated by all subsequent investigation. But it
must be noted that by " substance" or "body" is not necessarily meant
what modern science calls "matter," for the latter is merely one form or
phase of " substance" or "body." Matter, as we know it, has a great
range of manifestation, within the limits of which are found the hardest
granite or steel or diamond, as well as the finest and most subtle and
tenuous gases. The discovery by science of what it calls "radiant
matter" opens out a field to science previously tilled only by the
occultists and metaphysicians. Such matter is really not "matter" at
all, but "super-matter," and a higher form of "substance" or "body,"
But, known to the occultists, there are forms of "substance" or "body"
as much finer and rarer than radiant matter as the latter is rarer and
finer than the granite, steel, or diamond. Even the hypothetical Ether
of science is gross by comparison with some of the forms and phases of
"substance" or "body" known to the occultists and alchemists. As a
writer has said: 'The field of matter, as known to science, as compared
with the real extent of the Principle of Substance, is as no more than a
hair-line drawn across a yard-stick." The occult teachings inform us
that there are living beings in existence on other planes whose bodies
are composed of substance so fine and subtle that the term "ethereal" is
the only one to be even fairly adequate to be employed in connection
with them. Remember, the occult teaching is that **"Everything** 

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

**has substance or body."** And "everything" includes
All-that-is-Manifest.

**Motion or Active Energy**. The ancient occult teaching that
"Everything moves" seems to be fully corroborated by all subsequent
investigation. Motion, of course, results from the presence and power of
Active Energy. And Active Energy is found everywhere present and in
manifestation. Both the occult teaching and modern science teach that
everything is undergoing constant change, and change is impossible
without active energy and motion. Active Energy manifests through
gravitation, cohesion, chemical affinity, electronic attraction,
expansion, contraction, centrifugal and centripetal force, light, heat,
magnetism, electricity, etc., etc. And there are much finer forces than
these known to the occultists, though not as yet discovered by science.
Wherever there is Substance there is Motion. Nothing is at absolute
Rest. Everything Moves. From the tiniest electron or atom, up to the
greatest sun, all is in constant motion. Remember, the occult teaching
is that **"Everything moves."** And "everything" includes
All-that-is-Manifest.

**Consciousness**. The ancient occult teaching that "Everything is
aware" seems to be fully corroborated by all subsequent investigations.
As we have seen in the study of the chapters concerning the Planes of
Consciousness, there is manifested consciousness of some form, phase, or
degree on all planes of life and being. Wherever there is Substance
there is also Motion, and also Consciousness. Substance, Consciousness,
and Motion are always found together—never apart or divorced one from
another. There can be no Substance without Consciousness and Motion; no
Motion without Substance

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

and Consciousness; and no Consciousness without Substance and Motion.

In the above we have but one of the many applications of the Principle
of Correspondence, which teaches that "As above, so below; as below, so
above;" and that "From One know All."

#### II. The Principle of Law and Order

The Principle of Law and Order manifests in the presence and
manifestation of a regular sequence, and orderly procession of phenomena
in the universe of things. It is voiced by the celebrated axiom of a
leading scientist that "The Universe is governed by laws." The spirit of
this principle of truth is embodied in the very term "The Cosmos," which
term is derived from the Greek term "Kosmos," meaning: "The world or
universe considered in connection with perfect order and arrangement, as
opposed to Chaos."

In the occult teachings of the Rosicrucians it is impressed upon the
student that "there is no such thing as Chance," in so far as Chance is
used in the sense of "uncaused happening." The student is taught that
even in the instances in which Blind Chance seems to rule, there is
still the manifestation of Law and Order and Causation, though the
Causes may lie outside of human knowledge. The term "Chance" is now
employed by careful thinkers only in the sense of "The unknown, or
unforeseen cause or causes of an event."

In the Cosmos the same Causes, manifesting under the same circumstances
always produce the same Effects. All of our science and thought is based
upon this universal fact, and intelligent reasoning would be impossible
without the tacit assumption of

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

the truth of this principle. There is no room for Chance or haphazard,
lawless happenings in the Cosmos. Everything, every happening, and every
event, must have its "causes" and its "becauses." Everything happens
"because" of so-and-so. Given certain causes, there must ensue certain
results and effects. "Nothing ever happens" says the old proverb—and
nothing ever does "happen" except for definite causes, and in pursuance
with universal laws. As someone has said: "There is no room in the
universe for anything outside of and independent of Law and Order. The
existence of such an outside Something would render all Cosmic Law
ineffective, and would plunge the universe into chaotic disorder and
lawlessness."

A writer has said regarding this: "A careful examination will show that
what we call 'Chance' is merely the idea of obscure causes, causes that
we cannot understand. The word 'Chance' is derived from a word meaning
"to fall" (as the falling of dice from the box onto the board), the
essence of the idea being that the fall of the dice are merely
'happenings' unrelated to any cause. And this is the sense in which the
term is generally employed. But when the matter is closely examined it
is seen that there is no chance whatsoever about the fall of the dice.
Each time a die falls, and displays a certain number, it obeys a law as
infallible as that which governs the revolution of the planets around
the sun, and the movement of the sun itself. Back of the fall of the die
are causes, or chains of causes, running back further than the mind can
follow. The position of the die in the box; the amount of muscular
energy expended in the throw; the condition of the table; etc., etc.,
all are causes, the effect of the

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

combination of which may be seen in the fall and position of rest of the
die. But back of these perceived causes there are chains of unseen
preceding causes, all of which have had a bearing upon the position of
the die as it comes to rest on the table. If the die be cast a great
number of times, it will be. found that the numbers shown will be about
equal, that is, there will be an equal number of one-spot, two-spots,
etc., coming uppermost. Toss a penny in the air, and it may come down
either heads' or tails.' But make a sufficient number of tosses, and the
heads and tails will even up. This is the operation of the Law of
Average. But bath the average and the single toss come under the Law of
Cause and Effect."

The same writer says: "There is no original happening; and every
happening is merely a link in a great chain of happenings. There is a
continuity between precedent happenings, the present happenings, and
future happenings. There is always the relation between what has gone
before, and what is happening now, and what will happen in the future.
For instance: A stone is dislodged from the mountain-side and crashes
through the roof of a cottage in the valley below. At first sight this
seems to be a chance effect, but when we examine the matter we find a
great chain of causes behind it. In the first place, there was the rain
which softened the earth supporting the stone and which allowed or
caused' it to fall. Then back of that there was the influence of the
sun, other rains, etc., which gradually disintegrated the rock from a
larger piece. Then there were the causes which led to the formation of
the mountain, and its upheaval by convulsions of nature, and so on ad
infinitum. We might follow up the

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

causes behind the rain. Then we might consider the existence of the
cottage just at that place at that particular moment. In short we would
soon find ourselves involved in a mesh of cause and effect from which we
would soon strive vainly to extricate ourselves."

But the Rosicrucians do not believe in Fatalism in the ordinary sense of
that term. Fatalism denies that preceding events have any causal
relation to preceding events, and holds that the fated event would have
happened in spite of any precedent event. Fatalism makes the fated event
stand apart from the Law of Cause and Effect, and implies that the event
arose from the operation of some arbitrary degree or will. The following
quotation from an authoritative source will serve to point out the
essential distinction between Fatalism and the Determination of Cosmic
Law:

"Fatalism is the doctrine that the course of events is so determined
that what an individual wills can have no effect on that course.
Fatalism must be carefully distinguished from Determinism, as the
confusion of these two conceptions has been responsible for much of the
popular prejudice existing against Determinism. Fatalism, as has been
said, denies that Will has efficacy in shaping events. Determinism
maintains that this causally efficient Will is itself to be causally
accounted for; this is entirely different for the fatalistic assertion
that Will counts for nothing. In fact Determinism and Fatalism are
fundamental antagonistic. Determinism **asserts** that events are
determined by some of the events that immediately precede them; that if
the latter were different the former would be different. **Fatalism
denies** that immediately preceding

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

events have anything to do with the origination of events immediately
following: it asserts that the latter would occur even if the former
were changed. To say that one's death is fixed by Fate is to deny that
it takes place by natural law. Or, more accurately, it is to say that
however much one varies the cause, one cannot vary the effect. The
fatalist's position is that the **end** is predetermined, but not the
**means;** the determinist's position is that the events now occurring
lead by causality to other events, which are thus fixed because their
causes are actually existent. Or, to put it still another way, for the
fatalist what actually determines the event is not another event
immediately preceding, but some mysterious decree issued by some
mysterious agent ages before the event. This enables us to see that
Fatalism gives no scope to the Will. But Determinism, which merely
asserts that every event has its determining conditions in its immediate
antecedents, includes among those antecedents the human Will. Thus
Determinism is consistent with a belief in the efficacy of Will, and
Fatalism is not."

In the above we have illustrations of some of the many applications of
the Principle of Law and Order, which teaches that "Nothing happens by
Chance, but everything happening is in accordance with Law, Order, and
Causation."

#### III. The Principle of Vibration

The Principle of Vibration manifests in the manifestation of a state of
vibration in everything in the Manifested Cosmos. It is voiced by the
old occult axiom: "Everything vibrates."

Modern science has advanced to the position of the ancient occultists
who asserted that everything in

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

the Cosmos was in a state or condition of continuous vibration. Science
now tells us that not only is every particle of matter, or every mass of
matter, in a state of continual vibration, but also that light, heat,
magnetism, electricity and every other form of natural force results
from a state of vibration.

The occultists go further than this, and assert that even on the mental
and spiritual planes there is ever manifest a condition of vibration. In
fact, the occultists teach that the distinction between the several
planes of being is almost entirely due to the difference in the rate and
character on the vibrations manifested. The difference between steel and
gold, or diamond and clay is entirely a matter of difference in
vibrations. All forms of energy are accompanied by distinctive degrees
of vibrations. The conditions of material substances are created by the
respective degree of vibrations manifested by each.

A writer has said: "Science offers the illustration of a rapidly moving
wheel, top, or cylinder, to show the effects of increasing rates of
vibration. The illustration supposes a wheel, top, or revolving
cylinder, running at a high rate of speed—we will call this revolving
thing 'the object' in following out the illustration. Let us suppose the
object to be moving slowly. It may be seen readily, but no sound of its
movement reaches the ear. Then the speed is gradually increased. In a
few moments the movement becomes so rapid that a deep growl or low note
may be heard. Then as the rate of motion is increased the note rises
higher in the musical scale. Then, the motion being still further
increased, the next highest note is distinguished. Then, one after
another, all the notes of the musical scale appear, rising higher and
higher as the motion is increased.

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Finally, when the
motions have reached a certain rate, the final note perceptible to human
ears is reached, and the shrill, piercing shriek dies away, and silence
follows. No sound is then heard from the revolving object, for its rate
of motion is so high that the human ear cannot register the vibrations.
Then comes the perception of rising degrees of Heat. After quite a time
in which degrees of heat are being manifested without any sign of
distinguishable color (though certain colors are there, but
imperceptible to human vision) there gradually is manifested a dull dark
reddish color in the revolving object. As the rate of speed increases,
the red becomes brighter. Then, as the speed is still further increased,
the red changes into an orange color. Then follow, successively, the
shades of green, blue, indigo, and finally violet, as the rate of
vibrations increase. Then the violet fades away, and all color
disappears, the human eye not being able to register them. But there are
invisible rays emanating from the revolving object, the rays that are
used in photographing, and other subtle rays of light. Then begin to be
manifested the peculiar rays known as the 'X Rays,' etc., as the
constitution of the object changes. Electricity and Magnetism are
emitted when the appropriate rate of vibration is attained.

"When the revolving object reaches a certain degree or rate of
vibration, its molecules disintegrate, and resolve themselves into the
original elements or atoms. Then the atoms, in turn disintegrate, and
are resolved into the countless corpuscles which constitute the atom.
And finally even the corpuscles disintegrate, and a condition of
ethereal substance is produced. Science does not dare to follow the
illustration further, but the occultists teach that if the vibrations

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

were continuously increased the revolving object would mount up the
successive states of manifestation, and would display the various higher
stages of consciousness."

The occultists teach that each and every mental or emotional state has
its own distinctive rate of vibration, and that the secret of "emotional
contagion" is due to the fact that similar vibrations are set up in the
emotional nature of persons subjected to the influence of strong emotion
in another person. All manifestations of thought, emotion, will, desire,
or feeling, or any other mental state, are accompanied and caused by
vibrations of a certain high rate, and that these vibrations tend to
influence others in their field of "induction," and tend to set up in
the others similar vibrations. In this fact lies the secret of Mental
Influence, Personal Magnetism, etc. A knowledge and mastery of the
science of mental vibrations enables the skilled Rosicrucian to change
the rate of his mental vibrations at will, and to thus maintain a state
of mental calm and power, unaffected by the thought vibrations of those
around him.

So truly does advanced modern scientific thought recognize the nature of
vibrations, that the axiom is announced that "The difference in things
consists entirely of difference in vibrations." This axiom is akin to
the ancient occult aphorism that "Things manifest differences according
to their rate of vibrations."

So, it is seen, all human investigation tends to prove the truth of the
old occult axiom that "Everything vibrates."

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

#### IV. The Principle of Rhythm

The Principle of Rhythm manifests that universal regular swing or
time-beat which is apparent in all the manifested world, from its
highest to its lowest manifestation. The ancient occult axiom
"Everything beats time" expresses this fundamental fact of the Cosmos.

Rhythm means: "Regularly recurring motion, change or impulse proceeding
in time-measured, alternating sequence." The term "alternating" means
"succeeding, acting or happening in turn." The term "recurring" means
"returning repeatedly; occurring at stated intervals, or according to
some regular rule."

Rhythm manifests in regular recurrence, succession in turn, repeated
occurrence at stated intervals, etc. The simplest and most typical
example or illustration of Rhythm is found in the swinging of the
pendulum; the revolution of the earth on its axis., and around the sun,
in regular measured time; the "beating time" of the metronome or the
baton of the musical director; or the measured time in poetry or music.
Rhythm means "beating time" in regular motion.

In all Rhythm there is recurring motion, change, and activity; action or
motion in opposite directions; alternations between the opposite poles
of action or motion; and a regular interval of time between the
alternating actions or motions. In all phenomenal change or motion there
is to be always found the existence of two opposite extremes between
which the rhythmic change or motion is manifested. Rhythmic change and
motion proceed by alternating swings between these two extremes, with a
regular period of time elapsing between each beat, swing,

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

or impulse in either direction. The period of "time" between the two
alternating impulses constitutes the rhythmic rate, degree, or beat—its
rhythmic measure of periodicity.

The term "periodicity" so often employed in connection with the subject
of Rhythm, means "state of occurring or recurring at fixed intervals of
time." Every phenomenal thing manifests periodicity, by reason of the
presence and activity of the Principle of Rhythm. Every phenomenal thing
has its own rhythmic beat, or [measure](errata.htm#25.md) of periodicity.
All scientific investigation tends to corroborate the ancient occult
axiom: "Everything beats time." A leading scientist has said: "Rhythm is
a necessary characteristic of all motion. Given the co-existence
everywhere of antagonistic forces—a postulate which is necessitated by
our experience—and Rhythm is a necessary corollary. All motion
alternates—be it the motion of planets in their orbits, or ethereal
corpuscles in their undulations—be it the cadence of speech, or the rise
and fall of prices—it became manifest that this perpetual reversal of
motion between limits is inevitable."

The atoms in their vibrations manifest Rhythm. The swing of the planets
and the whirling of the earth manifest Rhythm. The rise and fall of the
tides manifest Rhythm. The swing of the pendulum is interrupted Rhythm.
Completed Rhythm is represented only by a completed revolution or
circular movement—uninterrupted Rhythm always manifests as a complete
movement in an orbit. But inasmuch as the centre between the two
extremes is, itself, moving in response to a higher order of Rhythm, we
see at last that all completed Rhythm manifests as a

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

spiral—a circular movement which at the same time is moving forward.

By the Principle of Rhythm day is followed by night, and night by day.
Summer and winter alternate in their appearance. Sleeping and waking
alternate. Work and rest exchange places. Involution is followed by
evolution, and evolution by involution. All changes proceed according to
rhythmic order and sequence. The conduct of mankind is regulated by
Rhythm. Fashions in dress, in taste, and in feeling, all come and go,
and come again. Everything "comes back" in time. Races rise and fall,
and then rise again, again to fall. The course of empire wends its way
in cyclic procession around the earth. History repeats itself. Even our
emotions have their tidal movements.

A writer has said of an important fact concerning Rhythm in our
emotional states: "Nothing swings beyond the limit of its
extremes—nothing can pass beyond its rhythmic limits. Consequently, if a
thing swings far in one direction, it swings back equally far in the
other. Its reaction is in the measure of its action, though in an
opposite direction. If its swing is great, its extremes are widely
apart—if the swing is small, then the extremes are close together. The
pendulum illustration may be applied to the phenomena on all planes. A
short beat of the metronome allows the rod to move only a short distance
each way—the long beat admits of a wide swing. And, in the same way,
those who suffer keenly also enjoy keenly, while those whose natures
admit of but little suffering are also incapable of more than a limited
capacity for enjoyment. A pig suffers little, and enjoys but little;
while a highly organized, sensitive individual suffers the torments of
emotional and

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

mental hell at times, while at others he mounts to the heavenly
emotional and mental realms. The pendulum swings as far in one direction
as in the other."

In some of the higher teachings of the Rosicrucians the student is
instructed in the application of the Principle of Rhythm to the mastery
of his emotional states and feelings. The essence of this secret
teaching is that the wise, perceiving the inevitable reaction following
action, the ebb tide following the high tide, manage to escape the
consequences of the reaction by rising to their higher realms or planes
of consciousness just before the time of the backward swing of the
emotional pendulum, thus allowing the reactionary movement to be
manifested only on their lower planes of consciousness while the Ego
dwells serenely on the upper plane.

A writer, speaking along the lines just mentioned, has said: "The
masters taught that by an understanding of the Principle of Rhythm man
could escape many bewildering and perplexing changes in his emotional
states and feelings. \* \* \* They called this the Process of
Neutralization, the operations of which consisted of raising the Ego
above the vibrations of the ordinary conscious plane, and on to the
higher. This was akin to rising above a thing and allowing the thing to
pass beneath one. The occult masters, and their advanced students,
polarized themselves at the positive pole of a particular emotional
state, and by a process of "refusing" or "denial" they managed to escape
the effects of the swing of the emotional pendulum to the negative pole
of that emotion. All individuals who have attained any degree of
self-mastery really proceed in this same manner, though usually
unconsciously and

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

without a true understanding of the law they are operating. By refusing
to allow their negative mental and emotional states to manifest in them,
they really 'neutralize' them, and cause them to pass under them on a
lower plane of consciousness. The advanced occultist, however, proceeds
consciously and deliberately to this end, and acquires a degree of
balance, poise, and power almost incredible."

The further the student penetrates in his investigations, along the
lines of the physical, the mental, or the spiritual, the more will he
become convinced of the truth of the ancient occult axiom: "Everything
beats time."

#### V. The Principles of Cycles

The Principle of Cycles manifests that universal circular direction of
process or progress which is apparent in all the manifested world, from
its highest to its lowest manifestation. The spirit of this principle
was expressed in the ancient occult axiom: "Everything proceeds in
circles."

It is apparent to all careful thinkers and investigators that all
progress or procession of things or events follows the path of the
circle. All things, physical, mental, and spiritual manifest the cyclic
or circular trend. World and atoms, the Cosmos and man, all are under
this law. This principle is understood more clearly when we understand
that a completed and uninterrupted manifestation of Rhythm results in
the completion of a circular movement—therefore the circular or cyclic
trend of things is really closely allied to the Principle of Rhythm, and
both Rhythm and Cyclicity are closely allied to the Principle of
Vibration.

The following interesting quotation from a writer

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

on the subject serves to bring out some of the main points concerned in
the consideration of the activities of this particular principle:

"Cyclicity is akin to Rhythm, and arise by reason of it. All events tend
to move in cyclic trend—in constant circular movement. The Law of
Cyclicity manifests in the universal tendency of things to swing in
circles. Cyclicity is the outgrowth, or more complex form, of Rhythm.
The primal manifestation of Rhythm is action to-and-fro in. a straight
line or path—a movement backward and forward between two extremes or
poles of action. This would be the invariable movement if the particular
force manifested were the only manifestation of force or energy in that
particular field of the Cosmos. But when the swinging pendulum (free to
move in any direction) is subjected to the conflicting attractions and
repulsions of other manifestations of force and energy, then there is
manifested the universal tendency toward the circular trend—the tendency
to convert the straight path of the swing into a circular path or cycle.
The action and reaction, the attraction and repulsion, arising from the
conflict between the force of the rhythmic swing in a straight line on
the one hand, and the attractive and repellant forces from without, on
the other hand, tend to swing the moving thing in a perfect circle
around a central point, axis, or pivotal centre. And these conflicting
forces are in operation through the Cosmos, and the manifestation of
Cyclicity may be noticed on all planes. There is ever the evidence of
the cyclic trend of things and events—the tendency to move in circles.
The electrons in the atoms move in circles, just as do the planets
around the sun, and just as does the sun move around some other centre
in space.

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The highest occult
teachings, as well as the highest speculations of science, inform us
that there is always a movement in. circles around some given point, and
the movement of the said point, or centre of motion, around some other
centre, and so on, and on, to infinity."

The same writer continues: "All events tend to move in cyclic trend—in
constant circular movement of continuous recurrence. The experience of
man, aided by the reports of history, bears out this statement. The
student of human history is struck by the continuous cyclic trend
manifested throughout the ages of history. The student of philosophy is
attracted by the same evidence in. his own field. And so it is with
every field of human thought—the cyclic trend is noticeable everywhere.
Races and nations rise, flourish, decline, and fall; only to be
succeeded by others travelling over the same lines. 'Westward the star
of Empire takes its flight '—the centre of political power is constantly
changing. The civilizations of Lemuria, Atlantis, Egypt, Chaldea, Rome
and Greece arose and passed away. Our own civilization is but travelling
over the same general lines. All forms of political government,
monarchic, autocratic, democratic, in all their variations, were known
in the past as in the present. The same law is observable in the history
of philosophical thought. Philosophical theories popular in Greece over
two thousand years ago fell into disrepute, but are now again forcing
their way to the front. The scientific theories of Causation,
Continuity, Determinism, and Evolution were popular in Ancient Greece
over two thousand years ago. And they were likewise popular in Ancient
Egypt and India centuries before that time. Fashions in literature,
dress, and manner constantly

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

recur—travelling 'round and 'round their little circles. Laugh as we may
at the absurdity of fashion in dress, nevertheless it is proceeding
according to Cyclic Law. Religious ideas are as old as the
world—pantheism, polytheism, monotheism, and atheism—all have played
their parts of fashion in religious thought, over and over again, and
will play them again. The present-day revival of interest in the occult
teachings arise from the operations of the same law. And the life of
individuals manifest the same trend and tendency. A little thought will
convince you that the majority of people travel in circles throughout
their entire life. The same old thing, over and over again, recurring at
intervals of greater or lesser duration, according to the nature and
character of the person. Many people are like the squirrel who travels
all day on his whirling wheel—always going but getting nowhere, ever
ending just where he began."

The thoughtful student, considering what has just been called to his
attention, will naturally ask us how it is, if this be so, that there is
any real progress at all. If, says he, there is nothing but a continuous
running around in circles—a constant travelling around without getting
anywhere—how is it that there is evident a real progress, a real
evolution, a real advancement in the scale of life and being? The answer
is simple: given a circular movement around a given point, axis, or
centre of attraction, and further given an advancing movement of that
centre, point, or axis, it follows that the first circular movement will
also be a spiral movement. If the Central Point is advanced, then the
circular movement is converted into a spiral movement—and while there
persists a "going 'round and 'round" as before,

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

each "going 'round" process travels on a little higher plane, or a more
advanced position. And this is just what exists in the Cosmos—a Cosmic
Spiral Process, onward and upward, in advancing and rising circles.

An old aphorism of an ancient school of occultism is: "The only escape
from Cyclicity is by means of transmutation into Spirality, i.e., by
advancing the Central Point of Motion. The conversion of the Circle into
the Spiral is one of the highest forms of Alchemy." And in this aphorism
is found one of the secrets of Rosicrucianism. The rule operates on each
and every plane of being, physical, mental, and spiritual.

A writer has said of this: "The Ego may convert the circle of its
life-motion into an advancing and rising spiral, which while carrying
him around the life circle will at the same time raise him a stage
higher at each turn. The Mountain of Attainment, around which winds the
Spiral Path, is travelled only in this way. Around and around the
Pilgrims travel, seemingly retracing their steps but in reality
constantly mounting upward. **By advancing the Central Point, by means
of the Will**, the wise and the strong convert the Circles into Spirals,
and thus advance and attain. This, indeed, as the old aphorism states,
'is one of the highest forms of Mental Alchemy.'"

The further the student penetrates in his investigations, along the
lines of the physical, the mental, or the spiritual, the more will he
become convinced of the truth of the ancient occult axiom that
"Everything proceeds in circles."

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

#### VI. The Principle of Polarity

The Principle of Polarity manifests that universal fact of "the pairs of
opposites," or "the antinomies," which is apparent in all the manifested
world, from its highest to its lowest manifestation. The spirit of this
principle was expressed in the ancient occult axiom: "Everything has its
Opposite, which is the other pole of its manifestation."

The Principle of Polarity may be stated as follows: "All phenomena
manifest polarity, or opposite and contrasted sets of qualities,
properties, or powers, operating in opposite and contrasted directions."
The ancient philosophers made this one of the chief features of their
teachings, under the name of "The Opposites," "The Pairs of Opposites,"
or "The Antinomies," according to the usage of the respective schools.
They held that every phenomenal thing possesses and manifests these
pairs of opposite qualities, properties, and powers. They also held that
each and every set of polarized opposites constitutes a unity consisting
of a reconciliation and balancing of the opposing poles. They also held
that every phenomenal thing, itself, is one of a pair of polarized
opposites which, together, constitute a greater unity; and so on, either
to infinity or until the opposites find final reconciliation and harmony
in an Infinite Reality.

The simplest and yet the most characteristic of the many examples and
illustrations of Polarity is seen in the presence and activity of the
two opposite and contrasting poles of the magnet—the positive and
negative poles. The magnet is one—a unity consisting of a balance and a
reconciliation of the two opposing poles and their respective activities

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

and powers. The illustration is typical, and fully illustrates the
general principle.

We may see evidences of Polarity in any direction toward which we may
turn in our search. There is always an up and a down; a top and a
bottom; a. high and a low; a right and a left; a forward and a backward.
There is always a past and a future; a now and a then; a before and an
after; a day and a night; a time and an eternity. There is always a fast
and a slow; a motion and a rest; a hot and a cold; a good and a bad; a
light and a dark; a conscious and an unconscious; an active and an
inactive; an involution and an evolution; an analysis and a synthesis; a
thesis and an antithesis; a male and a female; a positive and a
negative; a youth and an age; a health and a disease; a building-up and
a tearing-down; a birth and a death; a coming and a going; a life and a
death; material and an immaterial; a heavy and a light; an abstract and
a concrete; a long and a short; a broad and a narrow; a large and a
small; a north and a south; an east and a west; a love and a hate; a
courage and a fear; a faith and a doubt; a belief and a disbelief; a
truth and an error; and so on, ad infinitum.

Whenever we see a phenomenal quality, property or characteristic, a
state or a condition, we are fully justified in assuming the existence
of an opposite to it, which opposite thing will be found to act in the
opposite and contrasted direction to it. This is an infallible and
invariable rule of phenomenal existence.

In case the opposite of a thing is not known to us, because it has not
as yet been discovered by or made known to us, nevertheless in such case
we are fully justified in ascribing to the unknown opposite

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

the qualities and characteristics diametrically opposed to the known
opposite. The rule is this: "Whatever is affirmed of one of a pair of
opposites must be denied to the other"; and "whatever is denied to the
one, must be affirmed of the other." So true and infallible is this rule
that it may be applied and employed as the basis of logical reasoning
from the known to the unknown, for the purpose of discovering the
latter.

One of the most surprising features of this discovery is that we finally
perceive that the two contrasting sets of qualities are really but two
aspects or phases of the whole thing—the real thing, or thing in
itself—the unity of the two, instead of being two separated and distinct
things. Or, stating it in other words, we discover that the two opposing
sets of characteristics are merely relative to each other, and together
form a correlated unity and balanced whole.

As an illustration of the fact just stated, we may consider the two
opposites known as Hot and Cold, respectively; surely there can be no
two qualities apparently more distinct and separate from each other—more
diametrically different from each other. But careful examination shows
us that the two contrasting things are really but degrees, conditions,
and states of the same thing. There is no such thing as an "absolute
hot," or an "absolute cold." There are merely different degrees of this
Hot-Cold pair of opposites, which for convenience we call "Heat." We
cannot point out a place on the thermometer where Hot ceases and Cold
begins, or vice versa. The two states or conditions blend into each
other, and any statement regarding them is found to be merely
comparative. If we place one hand in a

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

bowl of very hot water, and the other in a bowl of ice-cold water, and
then suddenly withdraw both hands and plunge them into a bowl of
lukewarm water, what happens d Simply this, that we find that the
hot-water hand feels a sensation of coolness, while the cold-water hand
feels a sensation of heat—each experience resulting from the comparison
with the previous experience.

We may consider the emotional states of Love and Hate as another
illustration of the same principle; surely these two emotions seem
irreconcilable and impossible to harmonize. But let us see! At the one
end of the emotional scale of Love-Hate we find intense love, then
descending on the scale we find varying and gradually lessening degrees
of love. Then we find the balanced point of indifference, which seems to
be neither love nor hate, but which in reality is the subtle balancing
of the two emotions. Then descending the scale we find a faint degree of
aversion or dislike; then a series of gradually increasing degrees of
dislike, until finally real hate is met with, and so on until we reach
the degree of intense and extreme hate. Yet all are seen to be but
degrees on the same emotional scale of Love-Hate.

Sometimes there is a rapid change and shift on the scale of the
opposites. Love is quickly transmuted to hate; the best friends and most
ardent lovers become the bitterest enemies. And, on the other hand,
persons who originally detest each other frequently become ardent lovers
after a time; and old enemies, when reconciled, frequently become the
closest friends. The swing is often as far in one direction as was its
former swing in the opposite direction. Up changes to down, as the earth
revolves; and hot becomes cold when the vibrations

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

are changed. This also applies to hard and soft, tenuous and solid,
etc., the conditions depending entirely upon the rate of vibrations and
relative positions of the particles of the matter of which the things
are composed. Moreover, constant emphasis or activity of one opposite
frequently leads to a manifestation of the other opposite. We often fly
to the other extreme of feeling and action, when we have over-emphasized
the former emotional states. We get tired and disgusted with one set or
condition of things, and feel a desire to fly to the opposite condition
or set. Too much of a good thing often causes us to dislike it.
Likewise, if we travel far enough west, we finally reach the extreme
east, and vice versa. If we travel far enough north, we pass the pole
and find ourselves proceeding south. At the North Pole, no matter in
what direction we may travel, we always find ourselves travelling south;
while at the South Pole, we can travel north only, no matter which way
we may step out.

The discovery that "opposites are identical," in the sense of being but
the two contrasting poles of the same thing, opens up a wonderful field
of mastery to the occultist who has acquainted himself with the law of
Polarization, in its phases of Transmutation and Balance.

The understanding of the Principle of Polarity enables the occultist to
transmute one mental state into another, along the lines of
Polarization. Things belonging to different classes cannot be transmuted
into each other, but the opposing poles of the same thing may be so
changed—that is, may have a change in their polarity effected and thus
be transmuted one into the other. Thus, love can never become east or
west, or red or violet; but love may be changed into

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

hate, or hate into love, by a shifting of polarity. Courage may be
transmuted into fear, or fear into courage; hard may be changed into
soft, dull into sharp, hot into cold, and so on, the transmutation
always being between things of the same kind. The fearful man may shift
his polarity and by thus changing his emotional vibrations may become
filled with courage. Likewise, the slothful man may shift his polarity
into activity and energetic action. The key lies in the fact that in
this process of transmutation there is not an actual change of one thing
into another distinct thing, but rather a shifting of the centre of
polar force from one extreme of the scale to the other, just as one
would shift the carriage of his typewriter from 1 to 70, or change the
focus of an opera glass.

A writer on the subject has said of this particular point: "In addition
to the changing of one's own mental states by the operation of the art
of Polarization, the principle may be extended so as to embrace the
phenomena of the influence of one mind over that of another, of which so
much has been written and taught of late years. When it is understood
that Mental Induction is possible, that is that mental states may be
produced by 'induction' from those of other persons, then we can see how
readily a certain rate of mental vibrations, or polarization of a
certain mental state, may be communicated from one person to another,
and the polarity of the second person be changed accordingly. It is
along these lines that many excellent results of 'mental treatment' are
obtained, though the practitioner may not understand the nature of the
principle he is using. For instance, a person is 'blue,' melancholy,
depressed in spirits, and full of fear. A mental

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

scientist bringing his own mind up to the desired vibration, by means of
his own will which thus produces the desired polarization in his own
case, then by induction communicates these polarized vibrations to the
mind of the patient, the result being that the patient's emotional
states are converted from the negative polarization to the positive. A
knowledge of the existence of this great occult principle will enable
the occultist to better understand his own mental states, and those of
other people. He will see that these states are all matters of degree,
and seeing thus he will be able to raise or lower his mental and
emotional vibrations at will—to change his mental poles, and thus be a
master of his emotions instead of being a slave to them. And by his
knowledge he will be able to aid his fellow men intelligently, and by
appropriate methods change their mental and emotional polarization when
the same is desirable."

In concluding our consideration of the Principle of Polarity, we ask the
student to study carefully the following words written by one who has a
knowledge of the great subject of Balance, the art of which consists in
finding the Centre between the Two Extremes, and thus maintaining a
Poise and Balance which is undisturbed by any mental or emotional storm.
This writer says:

"Poise is Power. Poise results from Balance. Balance is secured by
adjusting and maintaining the Centre between the Poles of the Pairs of
Opposites. By Balanced Poise the Master neutralizes Polarity and Rhythm,
by resolving them into Unity. In the Heart of the Storm is Peace. In the
Centre of Life there is Poise and Power. Seek it ever, O Neophyte—for in
it thou shalt find thyself. The foregoing

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

sentences compose the substance of an ancient arcane aphorism, in which
is contained the seed thought generated in the centuries of thought and
experience of the arcane teachers. Do not pass it by because of its
simplicity. Poised balance is the aim and goal of the arcane initiates.
It is the secret of mastery. There is always a centre of everything. But
the centre exists only because of the existence of the circumference.
There is always a point or poise between the poles of every pair of
opposites. But that point exists only because the extremes exist. And in
the central point is always found the power of the whole event or thing.
In the centre of gravity of the earth one would be able to remain in a
position of perfect poise, unsupported except by the concentrated
gravity of the whole earth. So nicely poised that a mere effort of the
will would exert sufficient energy to propel him in any desired
direction. The power of the opposites are concentrated at the central
point. There all power is to be found, and there only. The axiom 'Action
and Reaction are equal' indicates a central point in which lies the true
lever which will move the whole. At the centre one is able to use action
and reaction without being subject to either. The initiate strives to
attain the state of equilibrium and absolute poise. He yearns to master
the art of traversing the razor-edge of Life, balancing himself
perfectly, like the trained mental athlete that he is, by means of the
balancing-pole of the Opposites which he has firmly grasped. Pitting the
Opposites one against the other—balancing law by law—the Master
traverses the slender tightrope thread which separates the world of
desire from the world of will. O Neophyte, in the Centre

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

of Life shalt thou indeed find Poise and Power. In the Heart of the
Storm shalt thou find Peace. In the Centre of the Cosmos shalt thou find
THYSELF. He who finds the Centre of Himself, finds the Centre of the
Cosmos. For, at the last, they are ONE!"

The student when confronted with questions and problems in which a
choice is difficult by reason of the strong activity of both extremes of
polarization—of both of the Pair of Opposites, is advised to seek out
the Centre between the two opposing poles, and to stand firmly there,
feeling assured that there, and there only is the place of peace, poise
and power. In the one word "BALANCE" there is to be found the Secret of
many, or most of the perplexing questions of Life. Seek ever, Poise and
Balance, and you will have Power and Peace!

The further the student penetrates in his investigations along the lines
of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual, the more will he become
convinced of the truth of the ancient occult axiom that "Everything has
its Opposite, which is the other pole of its manifestation."

#### VII. The Principle of Sex

The Principle of Sex manifests in the universal presence of sex
distinction and activity which is apparent in all the manifested world,
from its highest to its lowest manifestations. The spirit of this
principle was expressed in the ancient occult axiom: "Sex is omnipresent
and all-pervasive in the universe. All creation is generation, and all
generation proceeds from Sex."

All deep students of occultism, and many students of modern science,
perceive the truth of the Rosicrucian

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

ancient doctrine that Sex is all-pervasive, all-present, and is the
cause of all creation, for creation always results from generation, and
generation proceeds from sex-activity. There is Sex manifested in
everything—the masculine and feminine principles are ever at work in the
universe. This not only on the physical plane of being, but also on the
mental and spiritual planes of being. On the physical plane Sex
manifests physical generation; on the mental plane it manifests mental
generation; and on the spiritual plane it manifests spiritual
generation. An understanding of the Cosmic Principle of Sex will give
one a clear insight into many subjects which have proved perplexing to
the majority of thinkers.

In a preceding chapter of this book we have called your attention to the
fact that the activities of the electrons, the atoms, and the corpuscles
of which matter is composed, are purely sexual activities—that all
attraction is sex-attraction, and that as all Cosmic activity results
from Attraction, therefore Sex is the Motive Power behind the activities
of the Cosmos. A careful examination of the discoveries of modern
science which are being announced from year to year will convince the
student that all are explainable under the Rosicrucian theory of the
Principle of Sex, and are explainable under no other hypothesis.

Passing on to the Plane of Mind, we find that many of the discoveries of
modern psychology tend to verify the Rosicrucian theory also. Modern
psychologists are devoting much time and space to their presentations of
the various theories and discussions of that "other mind" which they
variously call the "subjective mind," the "subconscious mind," the

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "subliminal mind,"
etc., etc. In all of their theories, however, one point stands out
prominently, i.e., the point that this "other mind" is subject to
stimulating influences from the "conscious" or "objective" mind, and
after being so subjected to the influence of stimulus of the latter the
"other mind" becomes fertile and produces a wealth of ideas, thoughts,
and actions. But so far none of the psychologists have even attempted to
explain the nature of the influence or stimulus of the one mind upon the
other. And here is where the Rosicrucian teachings are much needed, for
the Rosicrucian recognizes and realizes at once the fact that the "other
mind" is feminine, and the stimulating mind is masculine, and that the
process is clearly one of fertilization followed by mental conception
and generation.

So clear is the analogy that one has but to have his attention directed
toward it to realize its truth and its proper application to the case
before us. It is so clear that one, on learning it, cannot see why the
promulgators of the "dual-mind" theories, and their commentators, can
have failed to perceive the secret underlying the phenomena discovered
by them and embodied in their various theories. Thompson J. Hudson, in
his book "The Law of Psychic Phenomena," in which in 1893 he announced
his celebrated theory of "the dual mind," came near to perceiving the
secret hidden in the teaching of the ancient occultists, but his
prejudices caused him to pass it by. In his statement, at the beginning
of his second chapter of said book, he says: "The mystic jargon of the
Hermetic philosophers discloses the same general idea," i.e., the
general idea of the duality of mind, but he failed to follow up the
promising lead, and thus lost the opportunity to complete

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

his discovery—or rediscovery, for the duality of the mind's activities
has been known to occultists for ages.

The "other mind" of the human individual may be regarded as a mental
womb-in fact the ancients so styled it—in which is generated a wealth of
mental offspring. It is a mine of latent possibilities of generation—the
generation of mental progeny of all sorts and kinds. Its powers of
mental generative energy are enormous. But it does not generate except
under the stimulus of the "conscious mind" of its owner, or some other
individual. The phenomena of Suggestion and Hypnotism are explainable
under the Rosicrucian Theory of Mental Sex. A writer on this subject has
said:

"Suggestion and Hypnotism operate in the same way, viz., by the
Masculine Principle projecting its vibrations toward the Feminine
Principle in the mind of the other person, the latter taking the
seed-thought and allowing it to develop into maturity when it is born on
the plane of consciousness. The Masculine Principle in the mind of the
person giving the suggestion directs a vibratory current toward the
Feminine Principle in the mind of the person who is the object of the
suggestions, and the latter accepts it according to natural laws, unless
the will interposes an objection. The seed-thought thus lodged in the
mind of the other person grows and develops and in time is regarded as
the rightful mental offspring of the person, whereas it is really like
the cuckoo's egg placed in the nest of the sparrow; and like the
offspring of the cuckoo, it destroys the rightful offspring of the owner
of the nest. The proper method is for the Masculine and Feminine
Principles in the mind of a person to co-ordinate

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

and to act harmoniously in conjunction with each other. But
unfortunately the Masculine Principle in the mind of the average person
is too lazy to act—the activities of the Will too slight—the consequence
being that such persons are ruled almost entirely by the minds and wills
of other persons, whom they allow to do their thinking and willing for
them. The majority of persons are but mere shadows and echoes of other
persons having stronger wills and minds than themselves. The strong men
and women of the world invariably manifest the Masculine Principle of
Will, and their strength depends materially upon this fact. Instead of
living by the impressions made upon their minds by others, they dominate
their own minds by means of their own will, obtaining the kind of
thoughts desired; and moreover they dominate the minds of others,
likewise, in the same manner. Look at the strong people, see how they
manage to implant their seed-thoughts in the minds of the masses of the
people, thus causing the latter to think thoughts in accordance with the
desires and wills of the strong individuals. This is why the masses of
the people are such sheeplike creatures, never originating an idea of
their own, nor using their own powers of mental activity. The
manifestation of Mental Sex may be noticed all around us in our daily
life. The magnetic persons are those who are able to use the Masculine
Mental Principle in the direction of impressing their ideas upon others.
The actor who makes people weep or cry as he wills is employing this
principle, more or less unconsciously. So is the successful orator,
statesman, preacher, writer, or other person who is before the public.
The peculiar influence exerted by Mme persons over others is explainable
in this way—

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

the operation of Mental Sex activity in the form of vibratory mental
currents. Here we may find the secret of personal magnetism, personal
influence, fascination, etc."

The Principle of Sex manifests and operates also on the Spiritual Plane
of being, according to its characteristic principles, and its results
are spiritual generation and regeneration. We regret that we are not
permitted to go deeply into this phase of the subject in this book, but
a detailed consideration of the operation of Sex on this high plane
would be contrary to the interests of the best in occultism, and would
invite a misuse of power on the part of unprincipled persons who fail to
understand the evil consequences to themselves coming as a reaction
following actions of this kind. The true student, however, by using his
power of reasoning by analogy, doubtless will be able to work out some
of the problems concerned with the phase of the question thus mentioned.
Such will find the secret in the old axiom: "As above, so below; as
below, so above."

The further the student penetrates in his investigations along the lines
of the physical, the mental, and the spiritual, the more will he become
convinced of the truth of the ancient occult axiom that "Sex is
omnipresent and all-pervasive in the universe. All creation is
generation, and all generation proceeds from Sex."
