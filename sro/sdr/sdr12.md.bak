### PART XI

### THE SOUL'S PROGRESS

A very important point in the Rosicrucian teaching is that in which we
are informed that the evolution of man is not confined to this planet,
the earth, but rather is extended to a chain of seven planets. The
Rosicrucians teach that the evolutionary processes of this planet are
linked with and blended into the evolutionary processes of six other
planets; and that life on this planet is likewise linked with and
blended into the life on the six other planets of our planetary chain.

The Rosicrucians teach that these seven planets of our planetary chain
are closely linked and connected by subtle etheric forces, and that
there is a constant etheric current passing from one to the others and
flowing ever through the entire circuit. These connected planets
constitute the chain of worlds which is the series of homes of the
individual soul, and the circuit of which is travelled by all individual
souls. Not only does each individual soul now on earth reincarnate a
number of times on this planet, but in the course of the ages it
progresses to the next highest planet, just as in ages past it has
progressed from the next lowest one. And this round of the chain of
planets has been made several times by the human race in some form of
existence, and will be made again several times.

The planets of this chain of worlds are not identical

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

in composition and nature with the earth; on the contrary there is a
wide difference between the several planets in this respect. The earth
is not the highest in development in this chain, but on the contrary is
far down on the scale, although there are others still lower. The
progress of the souls around this chain of worlds, however, is not
merely like a circle in which the soul travels from the lowest to the
highest, but is rather according to the plan of the spiral, in which the
journey always returns to the starting point, but on a higher plane of
activity.

This journey of the life forms from world to world has been in progress
since the beginning of the present world period, and was made by the
lower forms of life as they [climbed](errata.htm#22.md) the spiral stairway
of evolution. A writer on the subject has said of this point: "It is the
spiral character of the progress accomplished by the life impulses that
develop the various kingdoms of Nature which accounts for the gaps now
observed in the animated forms which people the earth. The thread of a
screw, which is a uniform inclined plane in reality, looks like a
succession of steps when examined only along one line parallel to its
axis. The spiritual monads, which are coming round the system on the
animal level, pass on to other worlds when they have performed their
turn of animal incarnation here. By the time they come again, they are
ready for human incarnation, and there is no necessity now for the
upward development of animal forms into human forms—these are already
waiting for their spiritual tenants. But if we go back far enough, we
come to a period at which there were no human forms ready developed on
the earth. When spiritual monads, travelling on the earliest or lowest
human level, were thus beginning

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

to come round, their onward pressure in a world at that time containing
none but animal forms provoked the improvement of the highest of these
into the required form—the much talked of missing link. \* \* \* The
impulse to the new evolution of higher forms is really given by rushes
of spiritual monads coming round the cycle in a state fit for the
inhabitation of new forms. These superior life impulses burst the
[chrysalis](errata.htm#23.md) of the older form on the planet they invade,
and throw off an efflorescence of something higher. The forms which have
gone on merely repeating themselves for millenniums start afresh into
growth; with relative rapidity they rise through the intermediate into
the higher forms, and then, as these in turn are multiplied with the
vigor and rapidity of all new growths, they supply tenements of flesh
for the spiritual entities coming round on that stage or plane of
existence, and for the intermediate forms there are no longer any
tenants offering. Inevitably they become extinct."

The writer above quoted from also points out a very important point in
the progress of the life forms from world to world, as follows: "The
tide of life—the wave of existence, the spiritual impulse, call it by
what name we please—passes on from planet to planet by rushes, or
gushes, not by an even continuous flow. For the momentary purpose of
illustrating the idea in hand, the process may be compared to the
filling of a series of holes or tubs sunk in the ground, such as may
sometimes be seen at the mouths of feeble springs, and connected with
each other by little surface channels. The stream from the spring, as it
flows, is gathered up entirely in the beginning by the first hole, or
tub A, and it is only when this is quite full that the continued
inpouring of water

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

from the spring causes that which it already contains to overflow into
tub B. This in turn fills and overflows along the channel which leads to
tub C, and so on. \* \* \* It is manifest from what we have already
said, and in order that the progress of organisms on globe A shall be
accounted for, that the mineral kingdom will mi more develop the
vegetable kingdom on globe A until it receives an impulse from without,
than the earth was able to develop man from the ape till it received an
impulse from without. \* \* \* The full development of the mineral epoch
on globe A prepares the way for the vegetable development, and as soon
as this begins the mineral life impulse overflows into globe B. Then
when the vegetable development on globe A is complete, and the animal
development begins, the vegetable life impulse overflows to globe B, and
the mineral impulse passes on to globe C. Then finally, comes the human
impulse on globe A. It is necessary at this point to guard against one
misconception that might arise. There is a fact to be stated which has
such an influence on the course of events, that, when it is realized, it
will be seen that the life impulse has passed several times around the
whole chain of worlds before the commencement of the human impulse on
globe A. This fact is as follows: Each kingdom of evolution, vegetable,
animal, and so on, is divided into several spiral layers. The spiritual
monads—the individual atoms of that immense life impulse of which so
much has been said—do not fully complete their mineral existence on
globe A, then complete it on globe B, and so on. They pass several times
round the whole circle as minerals, and then again several times round
as vegetables, and several times as animals."

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

Now, leaving behind us the consideration of the details of the progress
of the lower live forms, let us consider the details of the progress of
the human race. It has been seen that the great wave of human life forms
flows around the planetary chain in great waves—in successive waves of
progress. The successive waves are known by occultists under the name of
"rounds." But, according to the rule "As in the great so in the small,"
we find a corresponding series of spirals in the progress of the human
race during each of its several sojourns on the earth. That is to say,
an individual soul arriving on earth in one of the rounds does not
merely live out its life here, and then pass on to the next planet. On
the contrary, it lives a number of lives on this planet, and among
several races. There exists a spiral of races in earth life, through
which the individual soul must live and work its way. The number of
these races is of course seven, for seven is the number manifested in
all of the great occult processes of the Cosmos. There are seven great
rounds of human progress around the chain of worlds, and in each round
there are seven races in which the individual soul must manifest. The
present round of the human race is the fourth.

Each of the seven races of the present (fourth) round of the race
occupies the earth for a great period of time. The majority of the human
race now on earth belong to the fifth race, though there are some
stragglers from the fourth race still dwelling on earth. Each of these
seven great races of humanity are sub-divided into seven sub-races and
each sub-race is divided into seven branches.

The period during which each great root race of the human race
flourishes on earth is sharply marked

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

off from that of the one succeeding it by great convulsions of Nature
which destroy practically all traces of the preceding civilization, and
which leave but few survivors thereof. A writer has said of this point
of the occult teaching: "The periods of the great root races are divided
from each other by great convulsions of Nature and by great geological
changes. Europe was not in existence as a continent at the time the
fourth race flourished. The continent on which the fourth race lived was
not in existence at the time the third race flourished, and neither of
the continents which were the great vortices of the civilizations of
those two races are in existence now. Seven great continental cataclysms
occur during the occupation of the earth by the human life-wave for one
round period. Each race is cut off in this way at its appointed time,
some survivors remaining in parts of the world, not the proper home of
their race; but these, invariably in such cases, exhibiting a tendency
to decay, and relapsing into barbarism with more or less rapidity."

The individuals of the First Race of the present (fourth) round of the
human race on earth ranged from a gross type scarcely above the brutes
up to a very barbarous type. These higher types reincarnated later as
the higher individuals of the Second Race, the lower types of the First
Race constituting the lower subdivisions of the Second Race; the rule
being that the less advanced souls of any race incarnate as the lowest
types of the next and higher race.

The Rosicrucian teachings have but comparatively little to say
concerning the history of the peoples of the First Race and the Second
Race, but from what is taught it may be gathered that these peoples were
of a very low order of humanity—the types which we

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

know as the Cave Dwellers, the Stone-age people, and the Fire-people,
give us the nearest possible idea of what these First Race and Second
Race people must have been like. There was apparently little or nothing
of what we call "civilization" among these people, and they were
apparently about on a level with the very lowest types known among
mankind on earth today. The teachings, however, state that there were a
few comparatively highly advanced souls in the latter days of the Second
Race, who acted as the leaven for the great improvement which came with
the Third Race.

The era of the Second Race terminated, as usual, with a cataclysm which
destroyed the majority of the race, and which scattered its survivors
among far distant lands. Then dawned the period of the Third Race, the
seat of its greatest activity being laid in the continent of Lemuria,
which was situated on that portion of the globe which now lies at the
bottom of the Pacific Ocean, and parts of the Indian Ocean. The
continent of Lemuria also included Australia, Australasia, and other
Pacific Islands—these surviving portions being really the highest points
of the continent of Lemuria, the lower portions of which were sunk
beneath the waves ages ago.

A writer says of the character of the civilization of Lemuria: "Life in
Lemuria is described as being principally concerned with the physical
senses and sensual enjoyment, only a few developed souls having broken
through the fetters of materiality and reached the beginnings of the
mental and spiritual planes of life. Some few indeed made great progress
and were saved from the general wreck in order to become the leaven
which would lighten the mass of mankind during the next great cycle.
These developed

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

souls were the teachers of the new races, and were looked upon by the
latter as gods and supernatural beings, and legends and traditions
concerning them are still existent among the ancient peoples of our
present day. Many of the myths of the ancient peoples arose in this way.
The traditions are that just prior to the great cataclysm which
destroyed the people of the Third Race, there was a body of the Chosen
Ones which migrated from Lemuria to certain islands of the sea which are
now part of the main land of India. These people formed the nucleus of
the Occult Teachers of Lemuria, and they kept alight the Flame of Truth
with which was lighted the torches of the Fourth Race—the Race of the
Atlanteans."

With the passing away of Lemuria—the home of the Third Race—there arose
from the depths of the Atlantic Ocean the future home of the people of
the Fourth Race—the continent of Atlantis. Atlantis was situated in the
space now occupied by a portion of the Atlantic Ocean, beginning at what
is now known as the [Caribbean](errata.htm#24.md) Sea, and extending over
to the region now known as Africa. What we now know as Cuba and the West
Indies were the highest points of the continent of Atlantis, the lower
portions being now buried beneath the waves of the Atlantic Ocean.

The writer above quoted from, says of the civilization of Atlantis: "The
civilization of Atlantis was remarkable, and its people attained heights
which seem almost incredible to even those familiar with the highest
achievements of man of our own times. The Chosen Ones preserved from the
cataclysm which destroyed Lemuria, and who lived to a remarkably old
age, had stored up within their minds the wisdom and learning of the
civilization which

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

had been destroyed, and they thus gave the Atlanteans an enormous
advantage at the start. They soon attained great advancement along all
the lines of human endeavor. They perfected mechanical inventions and
appliances, reaching far ahead of even our present attainments. In the
field of electricity especially they reached the stages that our present
race will reach not sooner than two or three hundred years from now.
Along the line of occult attainment their progress was far beyond the
dreams of the average man of our own race, and in fact from this arose
one of the causes of their downfall, for they prostituted the power to
base and selfish uses, and practiced black magic. And so the decline of
Atlantis began. But the end did not come at once, or suddenly—it was
gradual. The continent, and the surrounding islands gradually sunk
beneath the waves of the Atlantic Ocean, the process occupying 10,000
years. The Greeks and the Romans of our own cycle had traditions
regarding the sinking of the continent, but their knowledge referred
only to the disappearance of the small remainder—certain islands—the
continent itself having disappeared thousands of years before their
time. It is recorded that the Egyptian priests had traditions that the
continent itself had disappeared nine thousand years before their time."

As in the case of the Chosen Ones of Lemuria, so was it with the Elect
Ones of Atlantis who were taken away from the doomed land some time
prior to its destruction. These advanced individuals of the race left
their Atlantean homes and "led by the spirit" migrated to portions of
what are now known as South America and Central America, then but
islands of the sea. These people left the traces of

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

their civilization in these lands, and our scientists discovering these
wonders greatly at the evidences of the high culture shown in them. When
the Fifth Race appeared, these brave and advanced souls became the
teachers of the new race, and were afterwards remembered as "gods," and
the heroes of mythology. The Fifth Race evolved rapidly, owing to the
urge of the souls of the Atlanteans pressing forward for reembodiment,
and human forms were born to supply the demand, the fertility of the new
race being marked.

The writer previously referred to says of the survival of members of a
disappearing race, and their influence on the life of the new race: "By
means of the cataclysms the races of each cycle were wiped out when
their time came, but the few elect or chosen ones, that is those who had
manifested the right to become torch-bearers, were carried away to some
favorable environment, where they became as leaven to the mass—as gods'
to the new races that quickly appeared. It must be noted, however, that
the chosen or elect ones were not the only ones saved from the
destruction that overtook the majority of the race in these cataclysms.
On the contrary, a few survivors were preserved, although driven away
from their former homes, and reduced to 'first principles of living' in
order to become the parents of the new race. The new races springing
from the fittest of the survivors quickly formed sub-races, being
composed of the better adapted souls seeking reincarnation, while the
less fit sank into barbarism and showed evidences of decay. A remnant of
these degraded human creatures, however, persist in incarnation for
thousands of years, being composed of those souls not sufficiently
advanced to take part in the life of the new

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

races. These 'left overs' are in evidence in our own times in the cases
of the Australian savages, the African Bushmen, and the Digger Indians,
and others of a similar low order of development. In order to understand
the advance of each race it must be remembered that the more advanced
souls, after passing out of the body, have a much longer period of rest
in the higher planes, and consequently do not present themselves for
reincarnation until a period quite late as compared with the hasty
reincarnation of the less advanced souls who are hurried back to rebirth
by reason of the strong earthly attachment and desires. In this way it
happens that the earlier races of each cycle are more primitive folk
than those who follow them as the years roll by. The soul of an
earth-bound person reincarnates in a few years, and sometimes in a few
days, while the soul of an advanced man may repose and rest on the
higher planes for centuries—nay, even for thousands of years, until the
earth has reached a stage in which the appropriate environment may be
afforded it."

At the beginning of the period of the Fifth Race (the present race of
man) there were born not only the beginning of the new sub-races which
always spring into existence at the beginning of a new cycle, but there
were also born the descendants of the Elect, saved from the destruction
of Atlantis by having been led away from the scene of danger. The new
races were the descendants of the scattered survivors of the Atlantean
peoples—that is, of the common run of those peoples. But the Elect few
were superior individuals of their race, and imparted to their
descendants their knowledge and wisdom. By an understanding of this
distinction, we are able to comprehend the fact that at the same time
there existed

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

hordes of people of the new races—more or less primitive and
ignorant—and at other places certain advanced peoples like the ancient
Egyptians, Persians, Chaldeans, Hindus, etc. These advanced peoples
represented the advanced souls—the old souls, of the advanced
individuals of the Lemurian and Atlantean civilizations.

The descendants of some of the higher individuals were afterward known
as the Assyrians and the Babylonians. In due time there appeared the
beginnings of the great Roman, Grecian, and Carthaginian peoples. Then
came the fall of the ancient peoples, and the rise of new subdivisions
of the race. The history of the race shows the existence and
manifestation of the law of the rise and fall of nations. Regarding this
phenomenon, Dr. Draper, in his "History of the Intellectual Development
of Europe" well says:

"We are, as we often say, the creatures of. circumstances. In that
expression there is a higher philosophy than might at first appear. From
this more accurate point of view we should therefore consider the course
of these events, recognizing the principle that the affairs of men pass
forward in a determinate way, expanding and unfolding themselves. And
hence we see that the things of which we have spoken as if they were
matters of choice, were in reality forced upon their apparent authors by
the necessity of the times. But in truth they should be considered as
the presentation of a certain phase of life which nations in their
onward course sooner or later assume. To the individual, how well we
know that a sober moderation of action, an appropriate gravity of
demeanor, belonging to the mature period of life, change from the wanton
willfulness of youth, which

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

may be ushered in, or its beginnings marked by many accidental
incidents; in one, perhaps, by domestic bereavements, in another by the
loss of fortune, in a third by ill-health. We are correct enough in
imputing to such trials the change of character; but we never deceive
ourselves by supposing that it would have failed to take place had these
incidents not occurred. There runs an irresistible destiny in the midst
of these vicissitudes. There are analogies between the life of a nation,
and that of an individual, who, though lie may be in one respect the
maker of his own fortunes, for happiness or for misery, for good or for
evil, though he remains here or goes there as his inclinations prompt,
though he does this or abstains from that as he chooses, is nevertheless
held fast by an inexorable fate—a fate which brought him into the world
involuntarily, so far as he was concerned, which presses him forward
through a definite career, the stages of which are invariable,—infancy,
childhood, youth, maturity, old age, with all their characteristic
actions and passions,—and which removes him from the scene at the
appointed time, in most cases against his will. So also is it with
nations; the voluntary is only the outward semblance, covering but
scarcely hiding the predetermined. Over the events of life we may have
control, but none whatever over the law of progress. There is a geometry
that applies to nations an equation of their curve of advance. That no
mortal man can touch."

Thus have risen and fallen the great nations of the past, and thus will
rise and fall the great nations of the future—and the law holds equally
true in the case of the great nations of the present. Even at the time
of thin writing great things are under way in

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

the history of the nations of the present. Cosmic forces are at work
under the thin disguise of the petty plans and ambitions of rulers and
statesmen. Looking backward over any period of past history the careful
historian is able to see clearly the rise and progress of mighty
movements which swept along in their current the affairs of great
nations; and the historians of the future will be able to discern
precisely such great movements and forces when they look back to the
history of today, our present time. And in each case it will become
evident that the majority of the peoples involved in the struggles have
had no clear perception of the great forces at work, or of the actual
goal to which the great movements have tended.

Thus have risen and fallen the great empires of the past, the Egyptian,
the Persian, the Chaldean, the Grecian, the Roman, and the rest, Caesar,
Alexander, Charlemagne, Napoleon, and the rest have been but the puppets
of Fate through and by means of which she has worked out the dictates of
Destiny. Races and peoples now regarded as but little more than
half-civilized will be the successors of the proud nations of today just
as the half-civilized Gauls, Angles, and Germanics succeeded the proud
civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome.

When a nation begins to decline it is because its more advanced souls
have passed on, leaving only the less progressive souls behind to carry
on the work of the sub-race. The advanced souls pass on to new scenes of
activity, and even the backward ones are not permitted to lag very far
behind for the continual change and the creation of new environments
tend to reawaken sleeping energies and to stimulate the lagging ones to
fresh endeavor and activity.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

The following quotations from a celebrated occultist may prove of
interest to the student in connection with the particular subjects
considered in the present chapter:

"At the half-way point of the fourth round here the polar point of the
whole seven-world period is passed. From this point outwards the
spiritual ego begins its real struggle with body and mind to manifest
its transcendental powers. In the fifth round the struggle continues,
but the transcendental faculties are largely developed, though the
struggle between these on the one hand with physical intellect and
propensity is fiercer than ever, for the intellect of the fifth round as
well as its spirituality is an advance on that of the fourth. In the
sixth round humanity attains a degree of perfection both of body and
soul, of intellect and spirituality, which ordinary mortals of the
present epoch will not readily realize in their imaginations. The most
supreme combinations of wisdom, goodness, and transcendental
enlightenment which the world has ever seen or thought of will represent
the ordinary type of manhood. Those faculties which now, in the rare
efflorescence of a generation, enable some extraordinarily gifted
persons to explore the mysteries of Nature and gather the knowledge of
which some crumbs are now being offered to the ordinary world, will then
be the common appanage of all. As to what the seventh round will be
like, the most communicative occult teachers are solemnly silent.
Mankind in the seventh round will be something altogether too Godlike
for mankind in the fourth round to forecast its attributes."

"The earth, while at present inhabited by fourth-round humanity—by the
wave of human life on its

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

fourth journey round the circle of the worlds—nevertheless contains some
few persons, few in relation to the total number, who properly speaking
belong to the fifth round. Now, in the sense of the term at present
employed, it must not be supposed that by any miraculous process any
individual unit has actually travelled round the whole chain of worlds
once more often than his compeers. Under the law by which the tide-wave
of humanity progresses, it will be seen that this is impossible.
Humanity has not yet paid its fifth visit even to the planet next in
advance of our own. But individual monads may outstrip their companions
as regards their individual development, and so become exactly as
mankind generally will be when the fifth round has been fully evolved. A
man born as an ordinary fourth round man may, by processes of occult
training, convert himself into a man having all the attributes of a
fifth-round man, and so become what we may call an artificial fifth
rounder."
