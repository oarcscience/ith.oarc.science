# THE COMTE DE ST. GERMAIN

### CHAPTER I

#### MYSTIC AND PHILOSOPHER

HE was, perhaps, one of the greatest philosophers who ever lived. The
friend of humanity, wishing for money only that he might give to the
poor, a friend to animals, his heart was concerned only with the
happiness of others.--*Mémoires de Mon Temps*, p. 135. S. A. LE
LANDGRAVE CHARLES, PRINCE DE HESSE. (Copenhagen, 1861.)

DURING the last quarter of every hundred years an attempt is made by
those Masters, of whom I have spoken, to help on the spiritual progress
of Humanity. Towards the close of each century you will invariably find
that an outpouring or upheaval of spirituality--or call it mysticism if
you prefer--has taken place. Some one or more persons have appeared in
the world as their agents, and a greater or less amount of occult
knowledge or teaching has been given out.--*The Key to Theosophy* (p.
194). H. P. BLAVATSKY

THE Comte de St. Germain was certainly the greatest Oriental Adept
Europe has seen during the last centuries.--*Theosophical Glossary*, H.
P. BLAVATSKY.

AMONG the strange mysterious beings, with which the eighteenth century
was so richly dowered, no one has commanded more universal comment and
attention than the mystic who was known by the name of the Comte de St.
Germain. A hero of romance; a charlatan; a swindler and an adventurer;
rich and varied were the names

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

that showered freely upon him. Hated by the many, loved and reverenced
by the few, time has not yet lifted the veil which screened his true
mission from the vulgar speculators of the period. Then, as now, the
occultist was dubbed charlatan by the ignorant; only some men and women
here and there realised the power of which he stood possessed. The
friend and councillor of kings and princes, an enemy to ministers who
were skilled in deception, he brought his great knowledge to help the
West, to stave off in some small measure the storm clouds that were
gathering so thickly around some nations. Alas! his words of warning
fell on deafened ears, and his advice went all unheeded.

Looking back from this distance of time it will be of interest to many
students of mysticism to trace the life, so far as it may yet be told,
of this great occultist. Sketches are to be found here and there from
various writers, mostly antagonistic, but no coherent detailed account
of his life has yet appeared. This is very largely owing to the fact
that the most interesting and important work, done by M. de St. Germain,
lies buried in the secret archives of many princely and noble families.
With this fact we have become acquainted during the careful
investigations which we have been making on the subject. Where the
archives are situated we have also learned,

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

but we have not yet in all cases received permission to make the
necessary researches.

It must be borne in mind that the Comte de St. Germain, alchemist and
mystic, does not belong to the French family of St. Germain, from which
descended Count Robert de St. Germain; the latter was born in the year
1708, at Lons-le-Saulnier, was first a Jesuit, and entered later in turn
the French, Palatine, and Russian military services; he became Danish
Minister of War under Count Struensee, then re-entered the French
service, and at the beginning of the reign of Louis XVI., he tried, as
Minister of War, to introduce various changes into the French army;
these raised a violent storm of indignation; he was disgraced by the
king and finally died in 1778. He is so often confounded with his mystic
and philosophic namesake, that for the sake of clearing up the ignorance
that prevails on the matter it is well to give these brief details,
showing the difference between the two men; unfortunately the disgrace
into which the soldier fell is but too often attributed to the mystic,
to whom we will now turn our entire attention.

That M. de St. Germain had intimate relations with many high persons in
various countries is quite undeniable, the testimony on this point being
overwhelming. That such relations should

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

cause jealousy and unkindly speculation is unfortunately not rare in any
century. Let us, however, see what some of these princely friends say.
When questioned by the Herzog Karl August as to the supernatural age of
this mystic, the Landgraf von Hessen-Phillips-Barchfeld replied: "We
cannot speak with certainty on that point; the fact is the Count is
acquainted with details about which only contemporaries of that period
could give us information; it is now the fashion in Cassel to listen
respectfully to his statements and not to be astonished at anything. The
Count is known not to be an importunate sycophant; he is a man of good
society to whom all are pleased to attach themselves. . . . He at all
events stands in close relation with many men of considerable
importance, and exercises an incomprehensible influence on others. My
cousin the Landgraf Karl von Hessen is much attached to him; they are
eager Freemasons, and work together at all sorts of hidden arts. . . .
He  is supposed to have intercourse with ghosts and supernatural beings,
who appear at his call." <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md)

Herr Mauvillon, in spite of his personal prejudice against M. de St.
Germain, is obliged to acknowledge the feeling of the Duke towards

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

the great alchemist. For on his supposed death being mentioned in the
Brunswick newspaper of the period, wherein M. de St. Germain was spoken
of as "a man of learning," "a lover of truth," "devoted to the good" and
"a hater of baseness and deception," the Duke himself wrote to the
editor, expressing his approbation of the announcement. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md)

In France M. de St. Germain appears to have been under the personal
care, and enjoying the affection of Louis XV., who repeatedly declared
that he would not tolerate any mockery of the Count, who was of high
birth. It was this affection and protection that caused the Prime
Minister, the Duc de Choiseul, to become a bitter enemy of the mystic,
although he was at one time friendly to him, since the Baron de Gleichen
in his memoirs says: "M. de St. Germain frequented the house of M. de
Choiseul, and was well received there." <span
id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md)

The same writer, who later became one of his devoted students, testifies
to the fact that M. de St. Germain ate no meat, drank no wine, and lived
according to a strict *régime*. Louis XV. gave him a suite of rooms in
the royal Château de Chambord, and he constantly spent

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

whole evenings at Versailles with the King and the royal family.

One of the chief difficulties we find in tracing his history consists in
the constant changes of name and title, a proceeding which seems to have
aroused much antagonism and no little doubt. This fact should not,
however, have made the public (of the period) dislike him, for it
appears to have been the practice of persons of position, who did not
wish to attract vulgar curiosity; thus, for instance, we have the Duc de
Medici travelling in the years 1698 and 1700 under the name of the Conte
di Siena. The Graf Marcolini, when he went from Dresden to Leipzig to
meet M. de St. Germain, adopted another name. The Kur-Prinz
Friedrich-Christian von Sachsen travelled in Italy from 1738 to 1740,
under the name Comte Lausitz. Nearly all the members of the royal
families in every country, during the last century, and even in this,
adopted the same practice; but when M. de St. Germain did so, we have
all the small writers of that period and later calling him an adventurer
and a charlatan for what appears to have been, practically, a custom of
the time.

Let us now make a list of these names and titles, bearing in mind that
they cover a period of time dating from 1710 to 1822. The first date is
mentioned by Baron de Gleichen, who says:

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

"I have heard Rameau and an old relative of a French ambassador at
Venice testify to having known M. de St. Germain in 1710, when he had
the appearance of a man of fifty years of age." <span
id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md) The second date is mentioned by Mme.
d’Adhémar in her most interesting *Souvenirs sur Marie
Antoinette*. <span id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md) During this time we have
M. de St. Germain as the Marquis de Montferrat, Comte Bellamarre or
Aymar at Venice, Chevalier Schoening at Pisa, Chevalier Weldon at Milan
and Leipzig, Comte Soltikoff at Genoa and Leghorn, Graf Tzarogy at
Schwalbach and Triesdorf, Prinz Ragoczy at Dresden, and Comte de St.
Germain at Paris, the Hague, London, and St. Petersburg. No doubt all
these varied changes gave ample scope and much material for curious
speculations.

A few words may fitly here be said about his personal appearance and
education. From one contemporary writer we get the following sketch:--

"He looked about fifty, is neither stout nor thin, has a fine
intellectual countenance, dresses very simply, but with taste; he wears
the finest diamonds on snuff-box, watch and buckles. Much of the mystery
with which he is surrounded is

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

owing to his princely [liberality](errata.htm#0.md)." Another writer, who
knew him when at Anspach, says: "He always dined alone and very simply;
his wants were extremely few; it was impossible while at Anspach to
persuade him to dine at the Prince's table."

M. de St. Germain appears to have been very highly educated. According
to Karl von Weber, <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md) "he spoke German,
English, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish very well, and French with a
Piedmontese accent."

It was almost universally accorded that he had a charming grace and
courtliness of manner. He displayed, moreover, in society, a great
variety of gifts, played several musical instruments excellently, and
sometimes showed facilities and powers which bordered on the mysterious
and incomprehensible. For example, one day he had dictated to him the
first twenty verses of a poem, and wrote them simultaneously with both
hands on two separate sheets of paper--no one present could distinguish
one sheet from the other.

In order to arrive at some orderly sequence, it will be well to divide
our material into three parts:--

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

i\. Theories about his birth and character, with personal details, some
of which we have briefly noticed.

ii\. His travels and knowledge.

iii\. His political and mystical work.

Beginning, then, with our first division, the theories about his birth
and nationality are many and various; and different authors, according
to their prejudices, trace his descent from prince or tax-gatherer,
apparently as fancy dictates. Thus, among other parentages, we find him
supposed to be descended from:--

1\. The widow of Charles II. (King of Spain)--the father a Madrid
banker.

2\. A Portuguese Jew.

3\. An Alsatian Jew.

4\. A tax-gatherer in Rotondo.

5\. King of Portugal (natural son).

6\. Franz-Leopold, Prince Ragoczy, of Transylvania.

This last seems to have been the correct view, according to the most
reliable sources that have been found, and other information to which we
have had access on this point.

This theory is also held by Georg Hezekiel in his *Abenteuerliche
Gesellen*, i., 35, Berlin, 1862. Karl von Weber (*op. cit.*, i:, 318)
also says that M. de St. Germain openly appeared in Leipzig in 1777 as
Prince Ragoczy, and that he was

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

often known as the Graf Tzarogy, which latter is merely an anagram for
Ragotzy (Ragoczy). This last fact we have verified in another
interesting set of articles, to which we shall refer later, written by a
person who knew him at Anspach under the name Tzarogy. Another writer
remarks: "His real origin would, perhaps, if revealed, have compromised
important persons." And this is the conclusion to which, after careful
investigation, we have also come. Prince Karl of Hesse, <span
id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md) writing of M. de St. Germain, says:--

"Some curiosity may be felt as to his history; I will trace it with the
utmost truthfulness, according to his own words, adding any necessary
explanations. He told me that he was eighty-eight years of age when he
came here, and that he was the son of Prince Ragoczy <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) of Transylvania by his first wife, a Tékéli.
He was placed, when quite young, under the care of the last Duc de
Medici (Gian Gastone), who made him sleep while still a child in his own
room. When M. de St. Germain learned that his two brothers, sons of the
Princess of Hesse-Wahnfried (Rheinfels), had become subject to the
Emperor Charles

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> VI., and had
received the titles and names of St. Karl and St. Elizabeth, he said to
himself: 'Very well, I will call myself Sanctus Germano, the Holy
Brother.' I cannot in truth guarantee his birth, but that he was
tremendously protected by the Duc de Medici I have learnt from another
source."

Another well-known writer speaks on the same point, an author, moreover,
who had access to the valuable Milan archives; we refer to the late
Cæsare Cantù, librarian of the great library in Milan, who in his
historical work, *Illustri Italiani*, ii., 18, says: "The Marquis of San
Germano appears to have been the son of Prince Ragotzy (Ragoczy) of
Transylvania; he was also much in Italy; much is recounted of his
travels in Italy and in Spain; he was greatly protected by the last
Grand Duke of Tuscany, who had educated him." It has been said that M.
de St. Germain was educated at the University of Siena; Mme. de Genlis
in her *Mémoires* mentions having heard of him in Siena during a visit
that she paid to that town.

The whole life of M. de St. Germain seems to have been more or less
shadowed by the political troubles and struggles of his father.

In order to understand this we must take a brief survey of his family
history, a survey which will moreover give us some clues, helping

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

us to unravel the tangled web of mysterious elements which surrounded
the life and work of the great occultist.

Few pages of history are more deeply scored with sorrow, suffering and
impotent struggle than those which tell the life story of the efforts of
one Ragoczy after another to preserve the freedom of their principality,
and to save it from being swallowed up by the rapidly growing Austrian
Empire under the influence of the Roman Church. In an old German book,
*Genealogische Archivarius aus dem Jahr* 1734, pp. 409, 410, 438,
Leipzig, a sketch is given, on the death of Prince Ragoczy, of his
family, his antecedents and descendants, from which we will quote some
leading facts: Francis Leopold Racozi, or Rakoczy, according to the
later spelling--the father of the famous mystic--made ineffectual
efforts to regain his throne, the principality of Siebenbürgen. The
Ragoczy property was wealthy and valuable, and Prince Francis,
grandfather of the mystic of whom we are writing, had lost his life in a
hopeless struggle to retain his freedom; on his death, his widow and
children were seized by the Austrian Emperor, and hence the son, Francis
Leopold, was brought up at the Court of Vienna. As our informant says:
"The widowed Princess (who had remarried Graf Tékéli) was forced to hand
over her children

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

with their properties to the Emperor, who said he would become their
guardian and be responsible for their education." This arrangement was
made in March, 1688. When, however, Prince Francis came of age, his
properties, with many restrictions and limitations, were given back to
him by the Emperor of Austria. In 1694 this Prince Ragoczy married at
Köln-am-Rhein, Charlotte Amalia, daughter of the Landgraf Karl von
Hesse-Wahnfried (of the line of Rhein-fels). Of this marriage there were
three children, Joseph, George and Charlotte. Almost immediately after
this period Prince Ragoczy began to lead the conspiracies of his
noblemen against the Austrian Empire, with the object of regaining his
independent power. The history of the struggle is most interesting in
every way, and singularly pathetic. The Prince was defeated and all his
properties were confiscated. The sons had to give up the name of
Ragoczy, and to take the titles of St. Carlo and St. Elizabeth.

Let us notice what Hezekiel <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md) has to say
on this point, for he has made some very careful investigations on the
subject: "We are, in fact, inclined to think the Comte de St. Germain
was the younger son of the Prince Franz-Leopold Ragoczy and the Princess
Charlotte Amalia of Hesse-Wahnfried. Franz-Leopold was married

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

in 1694, and by this marriage he had two sons, who were taken prisoners
by the Austrians and brought up as Roman Catholics; they were also
forced to give up the dreaded name of Ragoczy. The eldest son, calling
himself the Marquis of San Carlo, escaped from Vienna in 1734. In this
year, after fruitless struggles, his father died at Rodosto in Turkey,
and was buried in Smyrna. The eldest son then received his father's
Turkish pension, and was acknowledged Prince of Siebenbürgen
(Transylvania). He carried on the same warfare as his father, fought
against and was driven away by Prince Ferdinand of Lobkowitz, and
finally died forgotten in Turkey. The younger brother took no part in
the enterprises of his elder brother, and appears, therefore, to have
been always on good terms with the Austrian Government."

Adverse writers have made much mystery over the fact that the Comte de
St. Germain was rich and always had money at his disposal; indeed, those
writers who enjoyed calling him a "charlatan and a swindler" did not
refrain also from hinting that his money must have been ill-gotten; many
even go so far as to say that he made it by deceiving people and
exercising an undue influence over them. If we turn to the old
*Archivarius* already mentioned, we find some very definite information
that not only shows

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

us whence the large fortune possessed by this mystic was derived, but
also why he was so warmly welcomed by the King of France, and was so
well known at all the courts of Europe. No obscure adventurer is this
with whom we are dealing, but a man of princely blood, and of almost
royal descent.

Turning back to the old chronicle we find in the volume for 1736 the
will of the late Prince Franz-Leopold Ragoczy, in which both his sons
are mentioned who have been already named, and also a third son. <span
id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) It also states that Louis XIV. had bought
landed property for this Prince Ragoczy from the Polish Queen Maria, the
rents of which property were invested by the order of the King of France
in the Hôtel de Ville in Paris. We also find that considerable legacies
were left which were to be demanded from the Crown of France. The
executors of this will were the Duc de Bourbon, the Duc de Maine and the
Comte de Charleroi and Toulouse. To their care Prince Ragoczy committed
his third son, to whom also he left a large legacy and other rights on
this valuable property. Hence we must cast aside the theories that M. de
St. Germain was a homeless and penniless adventurer, seeking to make
money out of any kindly

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

disposed person. These were the views and ideas of the newspaper and
review writers of that day, put forward in the leading periodicals.
Unfortunately the law of heredity prevails in this class of people, and
there is a remarkable similarity between the epithets hurled by the
press of the nineteenth century at the venturesome occultist of to-day
and those flung at M. de St. Germain and other mystics of lesser
importance and minor merit.

We will now pass from this portion of our subject to some of the
personal incidents related of M. de St. Germain; perhaps the most
interesting are those given by one who knew him personally in Anspach
during the period that he was in close connection with the Markgraf. It
appears that the mystic made two visits at different times to
Schwalbach, and thence he went to Triesdorf. We will let the writer
speak for himself on this point:--

"On hearing that a stranger, both remarkable and interesting, was at
Schwalbach, the Markgraf of Brandenburg-Anspach invited him to come to
Triesdorf in the spring, and the Graf Tzarogy (for this was the name
under which he appeared) accepted this invitation, on the condition that
they would allow him to live in his own way quite unnoticed and at
peace.

He was lodged in the lower rooms of the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Castle, below
those occupied by Mademoiselle Clairon. The Markgraf and his wife lived
in the Falkenhaus. The Graf Tzarogy had no servant of his own; he dined
as simply as possible in his own room, which he seldom left. His wants
were extremely few, and he avoided all general society, spending the
evenings in the company of only the Markgraf, Mademoiselle Clairon, and
those persons whom the former was pleased to have around him. It was
impossible to persuade the Graf Tzarogy to dine at the Prince's table,
and he only saw the Markgräfin a few times, although she was very
curious to make the acquaintance of this strange individual. In
conversation the Graf was most entertaining, and showed much knowledge
of the world and of men. He was always specially glad to speak of his
childhood and of his mother, to whom he never referred without emotion,
and often with tears in his eyes. If one could believe him, he had been
brought up like a Prince. One day Tzarogy showed the Markgraf an
invitation which he had received, sent by a courier, from the Graf
Alexis Orloff, who was just returning from Italy; the letter pressed
Graf Tzarogy to pay him a visit, as Graf Orloff was passing through
Nuremberg. . . . The Markgraf went with Graf Tzarogy to Nuremberg, where
the Graf Alexis Orloff had already arrived. On

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

their arrival Orloff, with open arms, came forward to meet and embrace
the Graf Tzarogy, who now appeared for the first time in the uniform of
a Russian General; and Orloff called him several times, 'Caro padre,'
'Caro amico.' The Graf Alexis received the Markgraf of
Brandenburg-Anspach with the most marked politeness, and thanked him
several times for the protection which the Markgraf had accorded to his
worthy friend; they dined together at midday. The conversation was most
interesting; they spoke a good deal of the campaign in the Archipelago,
and . still more about useful and scientific discoveries. Orloff showed
the Markgraf a piece of unignitable wood, which when tested produced
neither flames nor cinders, but simply fell to pieces in light ashes,
after it had swollen up like a sponge. After dinner Graf Orloff took the
Graf Tzarogy into the next room, where they remained for some
considerable time together. The writer, who was standing at the window
under which the carriages of Graf Orloff were drawn up, remarked that
one of the Graf's servants came, opened one of the carriage doors and
took out from the box under the seat a large red leather bag, and
carried it upstairs to the other room. After their return to Anspach the
Graf Tzarogy showed them, for the first time, his credentials as a
Russian

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> General with the
Imperial seal attached; he afterwards informed the Markgraf that the
name Tzarogy was an assumed name, and that his real name was Ragotzy,
and that he was the sole representative and descendant of the late
exiled Prince Ragotzy of Siebenbürgen of the time of the Emperor
Leopold". <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)

So far this narrative is tolerably accurate, but after this point the
author proceeds with the history of what he considers the "unveiling" of
the "notorious Comte de St. Germain," in which all the various theories
about his birth, to which we have already referred, are retold with
embellishments. Amongst other wild reports, it was stated that M. de St.
Germain had only become acquainted with the Orloffs in Leghorn in 1770,
whereas there are various historical proofs showing, without doubt, that
he was in 1762 in St. Petersburg, where he knew the Orloffs well. We
have moreover heard in Russia that he was staying with the Princess
Marie Galitzin at Archangelskoi on March 3rd, 1762.

The following details were found in Russia, and sent by a Russian
friend:--

"The Comte de St. Germain was here in the time of Peter III. and left
when Catherine II.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

came to the throne. M. Pyliaeff <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md)
thinks even before Catherine's time.

"At St. Petersburg St. Germain lived with Count Rotari, the famous
Italian painter, who was the painter of the beautiful portraits which
are in the Peterhof palace.

"The street where they lived is supposed to be the Grafsky péréoulok
('péréoulok' means small street, and 'Grafsky' comes from Graf-Count)
near the Anitchkoff bridge where the palace is, on the Newsky. St.
Germain was a splendid violinist, he 'played like an orchestra.' In the
'Story of the Razoamovsky family' Alexis R. was reported to have spoken
of a beautiful moonstone St. Germain had in his possession.

"M. Pyliaeff has seen (he cannot remember where now) a piece of music,
some air for the harp, dedicated to Countess Ostermann by St. Germain's
own hand *signed*. It is bound beautifully in red maroquin. The date is
about 1760.

"M. Pyliaeff thinks that St. Germain was not in Moscow. He says the
Youssoupoff family have many MSS. in old chests and that St. Germain was
in relations with a Prince Youssoupoff to whom he gave the elixir for
long life. He says, too, that St. Germain did not bear

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

the name of Saltykoff (Soltikow) in Russia but that in Vienna he did
take this name.

"About the music signed by St. Germain, M. Pyliaeff now recollects that
it belonged to him himself. He bought it at some sale and had it for
some time. Then he gave it to the famous composer Peter *Chaikowsky* as
a present. It must now be in Chaikowsky's papers, but as the great
musician had very little order, M. Pyliaeff thinks it very unlikely that
it could be found, especially as at Chaikowsky's sudden death all was
left without any directions being given about the property."

We have said that the political events in his family had to some extent
shadowed the life of M. de St. Germain; one remarkable instance of this
we will now cite: it is, as far as we know, the only one in which he
himself makes any direct reference to it, and it occurs some time later
than the events which we have just been relating. After the return of
the Markgraf from Italy, whither he had gone in 1776, and where he had
heard some of the legends and fabrications above referred to, he appears
to have sent the writer whom we have quoted to Schwalbach to see the
Graf Tzarogy, and to test his *bona fides*. We will continue the history
as he gives it. "On his arrival, he found M. de St. Germain ill in bed.
When the matter was explained to

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

him, he admitted with perfect coolness that he had assumed from time to
time all the names mentioned, even down to that of Soltikow; but he said
he was known on all sides, and to many people, under these names, as a
man of honour, and that if any calumniator were venturing to accuse him
of nefarious transactions, he was ready to exculpate himself in the most
satisfactory manner, as soon as he knew of what he was accused, and who
the accuser was who dared to attack him. He steadily asserted that he
had not told the Markgraf any lies with reference to his name and his
family. The proofs of his origin, however, were in the hands of a person
on whom he was dependent (*i.e.*, the Emperor of Austria), a dependence
which had brought on him, in the course of his life, the greatest
*espionage*. . . . When he was asked why he had not informed the
Markgraf about the different names under which he had appeared in so
many different places, the Graf Tzarogy answered that he was under no
obligations to the Markgraf, and that since he offended no one and did
no person any harm, he would only give such personal information after
and not before he had dealings with them. The Graf said he had never
abused the confidence of the Markgraf; he had given his real name. . . .
after this he still remained at Schwalbach." A little later the author
of the

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

paragraph just quoted remarks: "What resources M. de St. Germain had, to
defray the necessary expenses of his existence, is hard to guess." <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md)

It appears curious to us that the writer knew so little of contemporary
history. As we have seen, all the sons of Prince Ragoczy were amply
provided for, and the proofs were even more accessible than they are in
our day. He goes on to say in conclusion: "It would be an ungrateful
task to declare that this man was a swindler; for this proofs are
required and they are not to be had." This is truly an ingenious
statement, but borders somewhat on libel; to speak of any one as a
swindler without any proof is beyond the bounds of ordinary fairness,
and it is especially incongruous in view of the final paragraph, which
is as follows: "As long as the Graf had dealings with the Markgraf, he
never asked for anything, and never received anything of the slightest
value, and never mixed himself up in anything which did not concern him.
On account of his extremely simple life, his wants were very limited;
when he had money he shared it with the poor."

If we compare these words with those spoken of M. de St. Germain by his
friend Prince Charles of Hesse, we shall find they are in perfect
accord. The only wonder is that a writer

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>
