### CHAPTER VIII

#### MASONIC WORK AND AUSTRIAN TRADITIONS

Passing now from France to Austria, let us see what Gräffer says in his
interesting, though curiously written, sketches. To give, then, a few
extracts out of many:

ST. GERMAIN AND MESMER

"An unknown man had come on a short visit to Vienna.

"But his sojourn there extended itself.

"His affairs had reference to a far-off time, namely, the twentieth
century.

"He had really come to Vienna to see one person only.

"This person was Mesmer, still a very young man.

"Mesmer was struck by the appearance of the stranger. 'You must be the
man,' said he, 'whose anonymous letter I received yesterday from the
Hague?'

"'I am he.'

"'You wish to speak with me to-day, at this hour, on my ideas concerning
magnetism?'

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

"'I wish to do so.'

"'It was the man who has just left me, who in a fatherly way has guided
my ideas in this channel. He is the celebrated astronomer Hell." <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md)

"'I know it.'

"'My fundamental ideas, however, are still chaotic; who can give me
light?'

"'I can do so.'

"'You would make me happy, sir.'

"'I have to do so.'

"The stranger motioned Mesmer to lock the door.

"They sat down.

"The kernel of their conversation centred round the theory of obtaining
the elements of the elixir of life by the employment of magnetism in a
series of permutations.

"The conference lasted three hours. . . .

"They arranged a further meeting in Paris. Then they parted." <span
id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_73.md)

That St. Germain and Mesmer were connected in the mystical work of the
last century we know from other sources, <span
id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_74.md) and that they again met and worked
together in Paris, is verified by

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

research among the records of the Lodge meetings already mentioned. This
meeting in Vienna must have taken place before Mesmer began his work in
Paris judging by the context. Vienna was the great centre for the
Rosicrucians and other allied Societies, such as the "Asiatische
Brüder," the "Ritter des Lichts," etc. The former were the largest body
who really occupied themselves deeply with alchemical researches and had
their laboratory in the Landstrasse, behind the Hospital. Among them we
find a group of St. Ger-main's followers.

To quote Franz Gräffer again:--

"One day the report was spread that the Comte de St. Germain, the most
enigmatical of all incomprehensibles, was in Vienna. An electric shock
passed through all who knew his name. Our Adept circle was thrilled
through and through: St. Germain was in Vienna! . . .

"Barely had Gräffer \[his brother Rudolph\] recovered from the
surprising news, than he flies to Hiniberg, his country seat, where he
has his papers. Among these is to be found a letter of recommendation
from Casanova, the genial adventurer whom he got to know in Amsterdam,
addressed to St. Germain.

"He hurries back to his house of business; there he is informed by the
clerk: 'An hour ago a gentleman has been here whose appearance

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

has astonished us all. This gentleman was neither tall nor short, his
build was strikingly proportionate, everything about him had the stamp
of nobility. . . . . . . . . . . . . He said in French, as it were to
himself, not troubling about anyone's presence, the words: "I live in
Fedalhofe, the room in which Leibnitz lodged in 1713." We were about to
speak, when he was already gone. This last hour we have been, as you
see, sir, petrified.' . . . . . . . . . . . . .

"In five minutes Fedalhofe is reached. Leibnitz's room is empty. Nobody
knows when 'the American gentleman' will return home. As to luggage,
nothing is to be seen but a small iron chest. It is almost dinner time.
But who would think of dining! Gräffer is mechanically urged to go and
find Baron Linden; he finds him at the 'Ente.' They drive to the
Landstrasse, whither a certain something, an obscure presentiment,
impels them to drive post haste.

"The laboratory is unlocked; a simultaneous cry of astonishment escapes
both; at a table is seated St. Germain, calmly reading a folio, which is
a work of Paracelsus. They stand dumb at the threshold; the mysterious
intruder slowly closes the book, and slowly rises. Well know the two
perplexed men that this apparition can be no other in the world than the
man of wonders. The description of the clerk was as a shadow

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

against a reality. It was as if a bright splendour enveloped his whole
form. Dignity and sovereignty declared themselves. The men were
speechless. The Count steps forward to meet them; they enter. In
measured tones, without formality, but in an indescribably ringing
tenor, charming the innermost soul, he says in French to Gräffer: 'You
have a letter of introduction from Herr von Seingalt; but it is not
needed. This gentleman is Baron Linden. I knew that you would both be
here at this moment. You have another letter for me from Brühl. But the
painter is not to be saved; his lung is gone, he will die July 8th,
1805. A man who is still a child called Buonaparte will be indirectly to
blame. And now, gentlemen, I know of your doings; can I be of any
service to you? Speak.' But speech was not possible.

"Linden laid a small table, took confectionery from a cupboard in the
wall, placed it before him and went into the cellar.

"The Count signs to Gräffer to sit down, seats himself and says: 'I knew
your friend Linden would retire, he was compelled. I will serve you
alone. I know you through Angelo Soliman, to whom I was able to render
service in Africa. If Linden comes I will send him away again.' Gräffer
recovered himself; he was, however, too overwhelmed to respond more than
with the

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

words: 'I understand you: I have a presentiment.'

"Meanwhile Linden returns and places two bottles on the table. St.
Germain smiles thereat with an indescribable dignity. Linden offers him
refreshment. The Count's smile increases to a laugh. 'I ask you,' said
he, 'is there any soul on this earth who has ever seen me eat or drink?'
He points to the bottles and remarks: 'This Tokay is not direct from
Hungary. It comes from my friend Katherine of Russia. She was so well
pleased with the sick man's paintings of the engagement at Mödling, that
she sent a cask of the same.' Gräffer and Linden were astounded; the
wine had been bought from Casanova.

"The Count asked for writing materials; Linden brought them. The
'Wundermann' cuts from a sheet of paper two quarters of the sheet,
places them quite close to each other, and seizes a pen with either hand
simultaneously. He writes with both, half a page, signs alike, and says:
'\[You collect autographs, sir; choose one of these sheets, it is a
matter of indifference which; the content is the same.' 'No, it is
magic,' exclaim both friends, 'stroke for stroke, both handwritings
agree, no trace of difference, unheard of!'

"The writer smiles; places both sheets on one another; holds them up
against the window-pane; it seems as if there were only one writing to
be

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

seen, so exactly is one the facsimile of the other; they appear as if
they were impressions from the same copper-plate. The witnesses were
struck dumb.

"The Count then said: 'One of these sheets I wish delivered to Angelo as
quickly as possible. In a quarter of an hour he is going out with Prince
Lichtenstein; the bearer will receive a little box. . . .'

"St. Germain then gradually passed Into a solemn mood. For a few seconds
he became rigid as a statue, his eyes, which were always expressive
beyond words, became dull and colourless. Presently, however, his whole
being became reanimated. He made a movement with his hand as if in
signal of his departure, then said: 'I am leaving (*ich scheide*); do
not visit me. Once again will you see me. To-morrow night I am off; I am
much needed in Constantinople; then in England, there to prepare two
inventions which you will have in the next century--trains and
steamboats. These will be needed in Germany. The seasons will gradually
change--first the spring, then the summer. It is the gradual cessation
of time itself, as the announcement of the end of the cycle. I see it
all; astrologers and meteorologists know nothing, believe me; one needs
to have studied in the Pyramids as I have studied. Towards the end of
this century I shall

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

disappear out of Europe, and betake myself to the region of the
Himalayas. I will rest; I must rest. Exactly in eighty-five years will
people again set eyes on me. Farewell, I love you.' After these solemnly
uttered words, the Count repeated the sign with his hand. The two
adepts, overpowered by the force of such unprecedented impressions, left
the room in a condition of complete stupefaction. In the same moment
there fell a sudden heavy shower, accompanied by a peal of thunder.
Instinctively they return to the laboratory for shelter. They open the
door. St. Germain is no more there. . . .

"Here," continues Gräffer, "my story ends. It is from memory throughout.
A peculiar irresistible feeling has compelled me to set down these
transactions in writing once more, after so long a time, just to-day,
June 15th, 1843.

"Further, I make this remark, that these events have not been hitherto
reported. So herewith do I take my leave." <span
id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md)

The curious character of Franz Gräffer's sketches is striking. From
other sources it can be learned that both of these Gräffers were
personal

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

friends of St. Germain, both were also Rosicrucians. And though no date
is given of the interview here recorded, we can deduce it approximately
from another article in the same volume, where it is said: "St. Germain
was in the year ’88, or ’89, or ’90, in Vienna, where we had the
never-to-be-forgotten honour of meeting him." <span
id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md)

That the Comte de St. Germain was also a Rosicrucian there is no doubt.
Constantly, in the Masonic and Mystic literature of the last century the
evidences are found of his intimacy with the prominent Rosicrucians in
Hungary and Austria. This mystic body originally sprang up in the
central European States; it has, at various times and through different
organisations, spread the Sacred Science and Knowledge with which some
of its Heads were entrusted--the same message from the one Great Lodge
which guides the spiritual evolution of the human race. Traces of this
teaching, as given by our mystic, are clearly found, and are quoted by
Madame Blavatsky, who mentions a "Cypher Rosicrucian Manuscript" <span
id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77.md) as being in his possession. She emphasises
also the entirely Eastern tone of the views held by M. de St. Germain.

The fact that M. de St. Germain possessed this rare work shows the
position held by him. Turning

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

again to *The Secret Doctrine*, <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md) we
find his teaching on "Numbers" and their values, and this important
passage links him again with the Pythagorean School, whose tenets were
purely Eastern. Such passages are of deep interest to the student, for
they prove the unity which underlies all the outward diversity of the
many societies working under different names, yet with so much in
common. On the surface it would appear that better results might have
been attained had all these small bodies been welded into one large
Society. But in studying the history of the eighteenth century, the
reason is evident. In Austria, Italy and France, the Jesuits were
all-powerful and crushed out any body of people who showed signs of
occult knowledge. Germany was at war, England also at war; any large
masses of students would certainly have been suspected of political
designs. The various small organizations were safer, and it is evident
that M. de St. Germain went from one society to another, guiding and
teaching; of his constant connection with the Masonic circles we have
other proofs; M. Björnstahl writes in his book of travels:--

"We were guests at the court of the Prince-Hereditary Wilhelm von
Hessen-Cassel (brother of Karl von Hessen) at Hanau, near Frankfort.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

"As we returned on the 21st of May 1774 to the Castle of Hanau, we found
there Lord Cavendish and the Comte de St. Germain; they had come from
Lausanne, and were travelling to Cassel and Berlin.

We had made the acquaintance of these gentlemen in Lausanne at the house
of Broglio." <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)

This is a most interesting statement, for it shows also the continued
intercourse of M. de St. Germain with the Bentinck family, with whom he
had so much intercourse in 1760 at the Hague.

A Masonic friend <span id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_80.md) sends me the
following information and extracts of letters, drawn from Masonic
sources in the Royal Library in Wolfenbüttel. He says:--

"With this post I send you a photo of the letter from Count de Welldone
to the Duke Friedrich August of Braunschweig, nephew of Ferdinand of
Braunschweig, and also from Frederick II. of Prussia, his uncle.

"Dr. K. Weber in 'From four Centuries' writes, vol. I., p. 317:--

"'In October 1776 he came to Leipzig as v. Welldone, where he offered
many secrets for the use of the Town Council, that he had

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

gathered together during his travels in Egypt and Asia.'

"The letter from Welldone is in the Wolfenbüttel Library (not in the
Archives). There I found various other remarkable letters. All are from
and to Freemasons. Among others one from Dubosc, Chamberlain in Leipzig,
who on the 15th of March 1777 wrote to Fr. August of Braunschweig:--

"'After a mysterious stay, the actual St. Germain, known at the time
under the name of Comte Wethlone (Welldone), who took great care to give
us to understand that he hid under this name his true quality of Prince
Rákoczy, took a fancy to associate with me.'

"From the minister v. Wurmb (Dresden) on the 19th of May 1777 from
Dresden:--

"'I employed the fortnight I spent in Leipzig to feel the pulse of the
famous St. Germain who at the present time has taken the name of Comte
de Woeldone and besides, at my request he came here to stay some time. I
found him between 60 and 70 years old.'"

The original letter of M. de St. Germain has been photographed and the
translation is as follows written from Leipzig: it has already been
shown that by the Church Records he had a right to this name and was
known and acknowledged as Comte de Welldone.

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

"Monseigneur,

"Will your Highness kindly permit me that I open my heart to you; I am
hurt that the Councillor, Mr. du Bosc, used means which could not be
agreeable to me, to make me known the Orders You have entrusted him
with, according to what he says in his letter, and which surely could by
no means concern me; the Baron de Wurmb, as well as the Baron de
Bishopswerder will always be honourable witnesses of the rectitude and
uprightness of the step I have taken, which was rendered necessary by
the respect and the zealous and faithful attachment which I have
dedicated to you for my whole life, Monseigneur; the delicacy enjoined
me at first to say nothing about my motive.

"I will hasten as much as possible to carry out the affairs both
important and indispensable for the locality I am in, in order that I
may immediately afterwards have the inexpressible joy of paying my court
to you, the best of Princes; when I shall have the honour of being well
known to you, Monseigneur, I expect with full certitude from your fine
discernment all that justice which is due to me and which will be
extremely appreciated by me, coming from your part.

"I am, in duty bound,

"Your respectful, faithful and humble servant

"LE C. DE WELLDONE.

"*Leipzig, May* 8*th*, 1777."

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

More evidence of this visit is found in a letter from the Saxon Minister
von Wurmb, who was himself an earnest Mason and a Rosicrucian.

"Correspondence of the Prior El, with the Minister Wurmb, o.d. Fr. a
Sepulcro,

"*Gimmern, June* 3*rd*, 1777.

"The 'a Cygne tr' (Gugomos) has most certainly not gone to Cyprus, but
to England. . . . M. de St. Germain chiefly on my account has come to
Dresden. If he does not disguise himself in an extraordinary manner,
then he will not suit us, altho’ he is a very wise man." <span
id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md)

Evidently a visit was expected which had to be disguised; this gives a
clue to the reason why M. de St. Germain was travelling in Leipzig and
Dresden under that name of Comte Weldon. According to Cadet de
Gassicourt, he was travelling member for the "Templars," going from
Lodge to Lodge to establish communication between them. M. de St.
Germain is said <span id="fr_82"></span>[2](#fn_82.md) to have done this
work for the Paris Chapter of the "Knights Templar." Investigation
proves him to have been connected with the "Asiatische Brüder," or the
"Knights of St. John the Evangelist from the East in Europe," also with
the

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Ritter des
Lichts," or "Knights of Light," and with various other Rosicrucian
bodies in Austria and Hungary; and also with the "Martinists" in Paris.

He founded, according to Éliphas Lévi, the Order of St. Joachim, but
this statement is not supported by any historical evidence at present
forthcoming, though many of his students and friends were members of
this body. Everywhere, in every Order where real mystic teaching is to
be found, can we trace the influence of this mysterious teacher. A
letter of his to the Graf Görtz at Weimar is quoted, saying that he had
"promised a visit to Hanau to meet the Landgraf Karl at his brother's
house in order to work out with him the system of 'Strict
Observance'--the regeneration of the Order of Freemasons in the
aristocratic mind--for which you also so earnestly interest yourself."

A summarised account from the "Gartenlaube " <span
id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md) fits in here; the letters are said to be
authentic; and from internal evidence there is little doubt about it;
for the information has to do with the Masonic work on which the Comte
de St. Germain was engaged:--

"Karl-August went to the Landgrave Adolf von
Hessen-Philippsthal-Barchfeld. St. Germain was there and was duly
presented to the Duke,

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

was charming in conversation and the latter asked, after supper, his
host about the count.

"'How old is he?'"

"'We do not know, anything sure about it. It is a fact that the count
knows details which only contemporains could tell in the same way. It is
fashion now in Cassel to listen respectfully to his stories and to be
astonished about nothing. The count does not praise himself, neither is
he an importune talk-teller, he is a man of good society, whom every one
is glad to have. He is not much liked by the head of our house, Landgraf
Frederick II., who calls him a tiresome moralist. But he is in
connection with many remarkable men and has an extraordinary influence
upon others. My cousin, Landgrave Karl of Hesse, is much attached to
him, they work together in Freemasonry and other dark sciences. Lavater
sends him chosen men. He can speak in different voices and from
different distances, can copy any hand he sees once, perfectly--he is
said to be in connection with spirits who obey him, he is physician and
geognost and is reported to have means to lengthen life.'

.      .      .      .      .      .

"The Duke went to Görtz, whom he knew well to be an enemy and opponent
of Goethe. Therefore in this moment of excitement he took the part of
the marshal.

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

"Görtz received the rare visit in a submissive way; when from slight
hints he could notice that the duke was not desirous to speak about
Goethe, his countenance was still more brightened.

"'At the beginning of May, dear Marshal, I made a highly interesting
acquaintance at the Landgraves in Barchfeld,' said finally the duke, not
without embarrassment. 'An acquaintance which I wish to keep up. It was
a certain Comte Saint Germain, who is staying at Cassel; please write to
this gentleman and invite him courteously to come over here.'

"Görtz promised to meet this request within the shortest time and to the
best of his ability.

"When the duke had gone away, he sat down to his writing table and wrote
as follows:

"Letter of Count Görtz:--

"'Triumph, dear count. Your knowledge of men, your addresses conquer.
You have foretold well: our gracious master is enchanted with you and
asks you hereby, in due form through me to come to his court.

"'You are really a wonder-worker, for his detested, plebeian favourite
now totters . . . a little help, one stroke of your genius and the
advocate of Frankfurt, who intrudes upon us, is checkmated. Will you
fight him openly now, or do you prefer to make first an incognito
personal survey of the territory? put down one or two

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

mines for him and show yourself only when he is totally beaten out of
the field? and then take his place with far more right and power?

I leave all this to your sagacity. Rely upon me as before, entirely, and
a small *élite* of faithful aristocrats, one or two of which you may
wish to bind closer to you if you think it good.

"'Always yours truly'

"'Count Görtz, marshal of court.'"

St. Germain's answer:

"'Dear Count!

"'I am quite ready to associate further with you and your companions in
opinion, very grateful for the complaisant invitation. I will follow it
later on.

"'In the present moment I have promised to visit Hanau, to meet the
Landgrave Karl at his brother's and work out with him the system of the
"Strict Observance"--the regeneration of the order of freemasons in an
[aristocratic](errata.htm#2.md) sense--which interests you too so much.

"'The Landgrave is to me a dear and sympathetic protector, and if not a
prince regnant, his position in Schleswig attached to Danish service, is
very princely. I will, by all means, before I decide quite for the
Landgrave, come to Weimar, liberate you from the hated intruder, and
recognise

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

the field there. Maybe I will prefer to do incognito at first.

"'Recommend me faithfully to your master, and promise my visit for some
time to come.

"'In the name of prudence, silence and wisdom I salute you

"'Yours

"St. Germain.'"

From internal evidence this is an authentic letter, for the Comte de St.
Germain would certainly have been helping in this body, based as it was
on the old "Order of the Temple" which will be treated at length later
on. It was, moreover, to save themselves from persecution that these
members called themselves "Free and Adopted Masons," and adopted the
signs and words of Masonry. Undoubtedly the "Strict Observance" sprang
from the most secret "Order of the Temple," a truly occult organisation
in the olden time.

At the suggestion of the Comte de St. Martin and M. Willermoz the name
was changed because of the suspicions of the police; the new one chosen
was "The Beneficent Knights of the Holy City."

Baron von Hund was the first Grand-Master; on his death the general
leadership was vested in the Grand Duke of Brunswick, an intimate

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

friend of M. de St. Germain. All these various organisations will be
dealt with in order; at present they are merely mentioned to show the
connecting link formed by M. de St. Germain between the separate bodies,
with whom M. de St. Germain had work to do; an Austrian writer in a
recent article says:--

"In the Masonic and Rosicrucian literature one often finds hints as to
the relations of St. Germain to the secret societies of Austria. One of
St. Germain's adherents in Vienna was Count J. F. von Kufstein, in whose
Lodge (in the house of Prince Auersberg) magical meetings were held
which generally lasted from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. St. Germain was present at
one such meeting and expressed his satisfaction with the workings.

. . . St. Germain collected old pictures and portraits; he was addicted
to alchemy, believed in universal medicine and made studies as to animal
magnetism. He impressed people, especially the higher classes, by his
French manners, his wide knowledge and his talkativeness. This
'Bohemian' so much attacked by historians, played the part of a
political agent during the peace negotiations between France and
Austria. Again, he is said to have distinguished himself in the year
1792 in the revolution.

"He was the 'Obermohr' of many mystic brotherhoods, where he was
worshipped as a

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

superior being and where every one believed in his 'sudden' appearances
and equally 'sudden' disappearances. He belongs to the picture of 'Old
Vienna' with its social mysteriousness; where it was swarming with
Rosicrucians, Asiatics, Illuminates, Alchemists, Magnetopaths,
Thaumaturgs, Templars, who all of them had many and willing adherents.

"Dr. Mesmer who knew the Comte St. Germain well from his stay in Paris,
requested him to come to Vienna in order that he might pursue his study
of animal magnetism with him. St. Germain stayed secretly here and was
then known as the 'American of the Felderhof' which latter became later
on 'Laszia House' in the Lugeck N. 3. Dr. Mesmer was much helped by the
Count and here in Vienna his (Mesmer's) teaching was written down. Soon
Mesmer gained followers but he was obliged to leave the town. He went to
Paris where his 'Harmonious Society'--a secret society of
savants--continued to exist. In Vienna St. Germain came in touch with
many mystagogues. He visited the famous laboratory of the Rosicrucians
in the Landstrasse behind the hospital where he instructed for some time
his brethren in the sciences of Solomon. The Landstrasse, situated on
the outskirts of Vienna, was for many centuries a region of spooks.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

"Below in the Erdberg the Templars and the estates of their order and
outside town in the Simmering there was in the times of Rudolf II. the
gold kitchen where the eccentric fraternity endeavoured to make gold. It
is certain that the Comte de St. Germain has been in Vienna in the year
1735, and also later. The arrival of the Count (who enjoyed at that time
a great prestige) at once created a great sensation in the initiated
circles." <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md)

The following is a list of some of the societies, more or less connected
with Masonry, which had "Unknown Heads." Translated they are as follows:

The Canons of the Holy Sepulchre.

The Canons of the Holy Temple of Jerusalem.

The Beneficent Knights of the Holy City.

The Clergy of Nicosia in the Island of Cyprus. <span
id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85.md)

The Clergy of Auvergne.

The Knights of Providence.

The Asiatic Brothers; Knights of St. John the Evangelist.

The Knights of Light.

The African Brothers.

Then there are groups of various Rosicrucian bodies widely spread in
Hungary and Bohemia.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> In all of these
bodies enumerated can be traced clearly the guiding hand of that
"messenger" of the eighteenth century, or of some of his immediate
friends and followers. Again in all of these groups can be found, more
or less clearly, those fundamental principles which all the true
messengers of the Great Lodge are bound to teach: such, for instance, as
the evolution of the spiritual nature of man; reincarnation; the hidden
powers of nature; purity of life; nobleness of ideal; the Divine power
that is behind all and guides all. These are the clues which show
without possibility of doubt to those who search for truth, that Lodge
whence came the Comte de St. Germain, the messenger whose life is here
but roughly sketched.

His work was to lead a portion of the eighteenth century humanity to
that same goal which now, at the end of the nineteenth century, again
stands clear before the eyes of some Theosophists. From his message many
turned away in scorn, and from the present leaders the blind ones will
to-day turn away also in scorn. But the few whose eyes are opening to
the glad light of a spiritual knowledge, look back to him who bore the
burden in the last century with gratitude profound.
