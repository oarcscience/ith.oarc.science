# ADDITIONAL NOTES.

### <span id="an_n01">NUMBER I</span>. ([p. 17](rhr03.htm#page_17)).

ACCORDING to the "Kabbala Denudata" of the Baron Knorr de Rosenroth, the
Rose signifies the Shecinah. The reason is given in the Zohar, sect.
Æmor., "*Quod sicut Rosa crescit ad aquas, et emiitit odorem bonum, sic
Malchuth hoc gaudet nomine, cum influxum assugit a Binah, quæ bonum
elevat odorem*."

The definition of John Heydon concerning the letters R. C. comes too
late to be of much value on historical grounds. But some may ask what I
mean by R. C. The ceremony is an Ebony Cross, flourisht and decked with
Roses of Gold. The Cross typifies Christ's sufferings upon the Cross for
our sins; the Roses of Gold shew the glory and beauty of his
resurrection from death to life. This is carried to Mesque, Cascle,
Apamia, Chaulatean, Virissa Caumich, Mount Calvery, Haran, and Mount
Sinai, where they meet when they please and make resolution of all their
actions, then disperse themselves abroad, taking their pleasure alwayes
in one of these places, where they resolve also all questions of
whatsoever hath been done, is done, or shall be done in the world, from
the beginning to the end thereof. And these are the men called
Rosicrucians."

### <span id="an_n02">NUMBER II</span>. ([p. 18](rhr03.htm#page_18)).

It is the sign of Mercury, but its position in the twelfth clavis of
Basil Valentine indicates a further and more arcane importance. "The
vivific gold, the vivific sulphur, or the true fire of the philosophers,
is to be sought in the house of Mercury," says Eliphas Lévi ("Mysteries
of Magic," p. 202). The "sulphur, mercury, and salt of the
philosophers," says the same adept, "condensed and volatilized by turns,
compose the azoth of the philosophers." The alchemical "balm of
sulphur," according to the Baron Tschoudy's "Catechism for the Grade of
Adept, or Sublime and Unknown apprentice Philosopher" (see "L’Etoile
Flamboyante"), is identical with the "radical moisture," which is also
the mercury of the philosophers, the base of every species in the three
kingdoms of Nature, but more particularly the seed and base of metals
when it is prepared philosophically by the extraction of what is
superfluous and the addition of what is wanting for the performance of
the Hermetic opus. On this point, see Pernetz, "Dictionnaire
Mytho-Hermétique."

### <span id="an_n03">NUMBER III</span>. ([p. 57](rhr05.htm#page_57)).

This is a common and significant superstition. Perhaps it originated in
the Phœnix legend; it is dear to mystical writers, at any rate, and has
prompted some curious and abstruse reasoning. The bee is especially a
subject of folklore, and is a symbol of the ungenerating and sexless
spirit of man, which yet presents itself to the mind under a male
aspect.

<span id="page_436">p. 436</span>

### <span id="an_n04">NUMBER IV</span>. ([p. 169](rhr13.htm#page_169)).

The symbolical representation of the tetrad under the figure of a
four-square garden, enclosure, house, or city is very common among
mystical writers. A familiar instance is found in the Apocalypse, where
the New Jerusalem is represented as a perfect square descending out of
heaven. Compare the "Roman de la Rose"--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Haut fut li mur et *tous quarrés*  
Si en fu bien clos et barrés,  
En leu de haies, uns vergiers,  
Où onc n’avoit entré bergiers."</span>

</div>

This passage is rendered by Chaucer in the following manner:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Square was the wall, and high somedele  
Enclosed, and ybarred wele,  
In stead of hedge, was that gardin,  
Come never shepherde therein."</span>

### <span id="an_n06">NUMBER VI</span>. ([p. 388](rhr29.htm#page_388)).

In the first volume of his "Philosophical Dictionary" Voltaire, however,
recounts what he considered to be the best exploit ever performed in
alchemy, and which was that of a Rosicrucian, who, as early as the year
1620, paid a visit to Henri I., duc de Bouillon, of the house of
Turenne, and the sovereign prince of Sédan, with the object of informing
him that his power and dominion were in no way proportioned to his
valour, and that he, the stranger in question, was fired with the
disinterested design of making him as wealthy as an Emperor. "I can
remain no longer

<span id="page_439">p. 439</span>

than two days on your estate," said the impostor; I must then proceed to
Venice and be present at the grand assembly of my brethren. In the first
place, you must keep my secret inviolable; in the second, send to the
first apothecary in the town and purchase a quantity of litharge; cast
but one grain of this red powder therein, and in less than a quarter of
an hour it will be transformed into gold."

The prince performed the operation, and repeated it three times in the
presence of the virtuoso. This personage had previously purchased all
the litharge which was to be found at the apothecaries in Sédan, and had
resold it to them, tinctured with several ounces of gold. The adept on
departing presented all his powder of projection to the duc de Bouillon,
who did not doubt for a moment that, having manufactured three ounces of
gold with three grains, he would make one hundred thousand ounces with a
proportionate quantity of this priceless and mysterious powder. The
philosopher was in haste to quit the town; he declared that he had given
all his powder to the prince, and that he needed some coin of the realm
to repair to Venice for the inauguration of the assembly of Hermetics. A
man of moderate tastes, he asked simply for twenty thousand crowns, but
was forced by his princely disciple to accept twice that sum; but when
the unfortunate duke had exhausted all the litharge in Sédan he could no
longer manufacture gold, nor could he anywhere discover his philosopher.
