*The Fourth Day*.

I still lay in my bed, and leisurely surveighed the noble<span
class="margnote">Autor longiuscule dormiens expergesit.</span> images
and figures about my chamber, during which, on a sudden, I heard the
musick of coronets, as if already they had been in procession. My Page
skipped out of the bed as if he had been at his wits’ end, and looked
more like one dead than living. "The rest are already presented to the
King," said he. I knew not what else to do but weep outright, and curse
my own sloathfulness. I dressed myself, but my Page was ready long
before me, and ran out of the chamber to see how affairs might yet
stand. He soon returned with the joyful news that the time was not past,
only I had over-slept my breakfast, they being unwilling to waken
me<span class="rmargnote">Jentaculo privatur.</span> because of my age,
but that now it was time for me to go with him to the Fountain, where
most were assembled. With this consolation my spirit returned, wherefore
I was soon ready with my habit, and went after the Page to the Fountain
in the Garden, where I found that the Lyon, instead of his sword, had a
pretty large tablet by him. <span class="margnote">Leonis Tabula.</span>
Having well viewed it, I found that it was taken out of the ancient
monuments, and placed here for some especial honour. The inscription was
worn with age, and, therefore,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I am minded to set
it down here, as it is, and give every one leave to consider it.

<span class="small">BIBITE FRATRES, ET VIVITE.</span>

<span id="img_14600"></span> ![](img/14600.jpg)

<span class="margnote">Scriptura facilis.</span>This writing might well
be read and understood, being easier than any of the rest. After we had
washed ourselves out of the Fountain, and every man had taken a <span
class="rmargnote">Potus.</span>draught out of an intirely golden cup, we
once more followed the Virgin into the hall, and there put on new <span
class="margnote">Vestitus.</span>apparel, all of cloth of gold
gloriously set out with flowers. There was also given to everyone
another Golden Fleece, set about with pretious stones, and various
workmanship according to the utmost skill of each artificer. On it hung
a weighty medal of gold, whereupon were figured the sun and moon in
opposition, but on the other side stood this poesie:--"The light of the
moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be
seven times <span class="rmargnote">Clinodiæ.</span>brighter than at
present." Our former jewels were laid in a little casket, and committed
to one of the waiters. After this the Virgin led us out in our order,
where the <span class="margnote">Musici.</span>musitians waited ready at
the door, all apparelled in red velvet with white guards. After which a
door, that I

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

never before saw open, was unlocked; it opened on the Royal
winding-stairs. There the Virgin led us, together<span
class="margnote">Accessus ad regis aulam.</span> with the musick, up
three hundred sixty-five stairs; we saw nothing but what was of extream
costly and artificial workmanship; the further we went, the more
glorious still was the furniture, until at the top we came under a
painted arch, where the sixty virgins attended us, all richly<span
class="rmargnote">Laboratorium aronatum 60 Virgines.</span> apparelled.
As soon as they had bowed to us, and we as well as we could had returned
our reverence, the musitians were dispatched away down the
winding-stairs, the Door being shut after them. Then a little Bell was
told, when in came a beautiful Virgin, who brought every one a wreath of
lawrel, but our Virgins had branches given them.<span
class="margnote">Virg. Lucif.</span> Meanwhile, a curtain was drawn up,
where I saw the King and Queen as they sate in their majesty, and had
not the yesterday queen warned me I should have equalled this
unspeakable glory to Heaven; for besides that the room<span
class="rmargnote">Regis et Reginæ gloria.</span> glittered of meer gold
and pretious stones, the Queen's robes were so made that I was not able
to behold them. In the meantime the Virgin stept in, and then each of
the other virgins, taking one of us by the hand, with most profound<span
class="margnote">Virgo lucifera præsentat hospites Regi.</span>
reverence presented us to the King. Whereupon the Virgin began thus to
speak:--"That to honour your most gratious, royal Majesties, these Lords
have adventured hither with peril of body and life, your Majesties have
reason to rejoyce, especially since the greatest part are qualified for
inlarging your Majesties’ dominions, as you will find by a most gratious
particular examination of each. Herewith I was desirous thus to have
them in humility presented to your Majesties, with most humble suit to
discharge me of this my commission, and to take information from each of
them concerning my actions and omissions."

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

Hereupon she laid her branch on the ground. It would have been fitting
for one of us to have spoken somewhat on this occasion, but, seeing we
were all troubled with the <span class="margnote">Hospites nesciunt
respondere. Atlas respondet.</span>falling of the uvula, old Atlas stept
forward and spoke on the King's behalf--"Their Royal Majesties most
gratiously rejoyce at your arrival, and will that their grace be assured
to all. With thy administration, gentle Virgin, they are most gratiously
satisfied, and a Royal Reward shall be provided for thee; yet it is
their intention that thou shalt this day also continue with them,
inasmuch as they have no reason to mistrust thee."

Here the Virgin humbly took up the branch, and we for <span
class="rmargnote">Descriptio labatorii.</span>this first time were to
step aside with her. This room was square on the front, five times
broader than it was long, but towards the West it had a great arch like
a porch, where <span class="margnote">Subscellia.</span>stood in circle
three glorious thrones, the middlemost being somewhat higher than the
rest. In each throne sate two <span class="rmargnote">1. Rex senex
Conjux Juven.</span>persons--in the first sate a very antient King with
a gray beard, yet his consort was extraordinarily fair and young. <span
class="margnote">2. Rex and conjux senes.</span>In the third throne sate
a black King of middle age, and by him a dainty old matron, not crowned,
but covered with a vail. But in the middle sate the two young persons,
who though they had likewise wreaths of lawrel upon their heads, yet
over them hung a large and costly crown. Now albeit they were not at
this time so fair as I had before imagined to my self, yet so it was to
be. <span class="rmargnote">Scomna. assessores.</span>Behind them on a
round form sat for the most part antient men, yet none had any sword or
other weapon about him. Neither saw I any life-guard but certain Virgins
which were with us the day before, and who sate on the sides of <span
class="margnote">Cupide.</span>the arch. I cannot pass in silence how
the little Cupid flew to and again there, but for the most part he
hovered

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

about the great crown. Sometimes he seated himself in between the two
lovers, somewhat smiling upon them with his bow. Sometimes he made as if
he would shoot one of us; in brief, this knave was so full of his
waggery, that he would not spare even the little birds, which in <span
class="margnote">Aves.</span>multitudes flew up and down the room, but
tormented them all he could. The virgins also had their pastimes with
him, <span class="rmargnote">Virgines.</span> and when they could catch
him it was no easie matter for him to get from them again. Thus this
little knave made all the sport and mirth. Before the Queen stood a
small<span class="margnote">Supellex in aula altare.</span> but
inexpressibly curious altar, wherein lay a book<span
class="rmargnote">1. Book.</span> covered with black velvet, only a
little overlaid with gold. By this stood a taper in an ivory
candlestick, which, although very<span class="margnote">2. Taper.</span>
small, burnt continually, and stood in that manner, that had not Cupid,
in sport, now and then puffed upon it, we could not have conceived it to
be fire. By this stood a sphere or celestial globe, which of itself
turned about.<span class="rmargnote">3. Sphære.</span> Next this was a
small striking-watch, by that a little<span class="margnote">4.
Watch.</span> christal pipe or syphon-fountain, out of which
perpetually<span class="rmargnote">5. Little Fountain.</span> ran a
clear blood-red liquor, and last of all there was a scull or death's
head, in which was a white serpent, of such a<span class="margnote">6.
Scull. serpent.</span> length, that though she crept circle-wise about
the rest of it, yet her taile still remained in one of the eye-holes
until her head again entered at the other; so she never stirred from her
scull, unless Cupid twitched a little at her, when she slipt in so
suddenly that we could not choose but marvel at it. There were hung up
and down the room wonderful images, which moved as if alive. Likewise,
as we were<span class="rmargnote">Imagines.</span> passing out, there
began such marvellous vocal musick that<span
class="margnote">Musicæ.</span> I could not tell whether it were
performed by the virgins who yet stayed behind, or by the images
themselves. We,<span class="rmargnote">Disceditur ex laboratorio</span>
being for this time satisfied, went thence with our virgins

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

who, the musitians, being already present, led us down the winding
stairs, the door being diligently locked and bolted. As soon as we were
come again into the hall, one of the virgins began:--"I wonder, Sister,
that you durst adventure<span class="margnote">Virgines jocantur de
senio autoris.</span> yourself amongst so many persons." "My Sister,"
replyed our president, "I am fearful of none so much as of this man,"
pointing at me. This speech went to my heart, for I understood that she
mocked at my age, and indeed I was the oldest of all; yet she comforted
me by promising, that in case I behaved myself well towards her, she
would easily rid me of this burden.

<span class="rmargnote">Convivium cum virginibus.</span>Meantime a
collation was again brought in, and every one's Virgin seated by him,
who well knew how to shorten the time with handsom discourses, but what
these and <span class="margnote">Sermones conviviales.</span>their
sports were I dare not blab out of school. Most of the questions were
about the arts, whereby I could lightly gather that both young and old
were conversant in the sciences. Still it run in my thoughts how I might
become <span class="rmargnote">Autor mæstus ob senium.</span>young
again, whereupon I was somewhat the sadder. This the Virgin perceived,
and, therefore, began:--"I dare lay anything, if I lye with him
to-night, he shall be pleasanter in the morning." Hereupon they began to
laugh, and albeit I blushed all over, I was fain to laugh too at my
<span class="margnote">Jocosum solatium accipit à Virgine.</span>own
ill-luck. Now there was one there that had a mind to return my disgrace
upon the Virgin, whereupon he said:--"I hope not only we but the virgins
themselves will bear witness, that our Lady President hath promised
herself to <span class="margnote">Socio.</span>be his bed-fellow
to-night." "I should be well content with it," replyed the Virgin, "if I
had not reason to be afraid of these my sisters; there would be no hold
with them should I choose the best and handsomest for myself." <span
class="margnote">Virg. lucif.</span>"My Sister," presently began
another, "we find hereby

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

that thy high office makes thee not proud, wherefore if by thy
permission we might by lot part the Lords here present, thou shouldst,
with our goodwill, have such a prerogative." We let this pass for a
jest, and began again to discourse together, but our Virgin could not
leave tormenting us, and continued:--"My lords, how if we should permit
fourtune to decide which of us must be together to-night?" <span
class="margnote">Ludicra electio una dormientium.</span> "Well," said I,
"if it may be no otherwise, we cannot refuse such a proffer." Now
because it was concluded to make this trial after meat, we resolved to
sit no longer at table, so we arose and each walked up and down with his
Virgin. "Nay," said the president, "it shall not be so yet, but let us
see how fortune will couple us," upon which we were separated. Now first
arose a dispute how the business should be carried out, but this was
only a premeditated device, for the Virgin instantly proposed that we
should mix ourselves in a ring, and that she beginning to count from
herself, the seventh was to be content with the following seventh, were
it a virgin or man. We were not aware of any craft, and therefore
permitted it so to be; but when we thought we had very well mingled
ourselves, the Virgins were so subtil that each knew her station
before-hand. The president began to reckon, the seventh next her was a
Virgin, the third seventh a Virgin likewise, and this continued till, to
our amazement, all the Virgins came forth and none of us was hit. Thus
we poor wretches remained standing alone, and were forced to confess
that we had been handsomely couzened, albeit, whoever had seen us in our
order might sooner have expected the sky to fall then that it should
never have come to our turn. Herewith our sport was abandoned. In the
interim the little wanton Cupid came also in unto us, but because he

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

presented himself on behalf of their Royal Majesties, and deliverd us a
health from them out of a golden cup, and was to call our Virgin to the
King, withal declaring he could not at this time tarry, we could not
sport ourselves with him, so, with a due return of our most humble
thanks we let him flye forth again. Now because the mirth began to fall
into my consort's feet, and the Virgins were nothing <span
class="margnote">A merry dance.</span>sorry to see it, they lead up a
civil dance which I rather beheld with pleasure then assisted, for my
mercurialists were so ready with their postures, as if they had been
long <span class="rmargnote">Hospites invitantur a virgine Luscif. ad
comediam.</span>of the trade. After some few dances, our president came
in again, and told us how the artists and students had offered
themselves to their Royal Majesties before their departure to act a
merry comedy; and if we thought good to be present thereat, and to waite
upon their Royal Majesties to the House of the Sun, it would be
acceptable to them. Hereupon we returned our humble thanks for the
honour vouchsafed us, and most submissively tendered our small service,
which the Virgin related, and presently brought word to attend their
Royal Majesties in the gallery, whither we were soon led, and staid not
long there, for the <span class="margnote">Processus Regis ad spectandum
comediam.</span>Royal Procession was just ready, yet without musick. The
unknown Queen who was yesterday with us went foremost with a small and
costly coronet, apparelled in white satin, and carrying nothing but a
small crucifix made of a pearl, and this very day wrought between the
young King and his Bride. After her went the six fore-mentioned Virgins
in two ranks, carrying the King's jewels belonging to the little altar.
Next to these came the three Kings. The Bridegroom was in the midst of
them with a plain dress of black sattin, after the Italian mode. He had
on a small round black hat, with a little black pointed feather, which

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

he courteously put off to us, thereby to signify his favour towards us.
To him we bowed, as we had been before instructed. After the Kings came
the three Queens, two whereof were richly habited; she in the middle
went likewise all in black, and Cupid held up her train. Intimation was
given us to follow, and after us the Virgins, old Atlas bringing up the
rear. Through many stately walks we came to the House of the Sun, there
next to the King and Queen, upon a richly furnished scaffold, to behold
the foreordained comedy. We, though separated, stood on the<span
class="margnote">Statio spectatorum</span> right hand of the Kings, but
the Virgins on the left, except those to whom the Royal Ensignes were
committed. To them was allotted a peculiar standing at top of all, but
the rest of the attendants were content to stand below between the
columns. Now because there are many remarkable passages in this Comedy,
I will in brief run it over. <span class="rmargnote">A Precipuâ quæ
agebantur.</span>

First of all came forth a very antient King with some<span
class="margnote">Actus 1.</span> servants; before his throne was brought
a little chest, with mention that it was found upon the water. Being
opened, there appeared in it a lovely babe, together with certain
jewels, and a small parchment sealed, and superscribed to the King. This
the King presently opened, and having read it, he wept and declared to
his servants how injuriously the King of the <span
id="img_15300"></span> ![Moores](img/15300.jpg.md) had deprived his aunt of
her country, and had extinguished all the royal seed even to this
infant, with the Daughter of which country he had purposed to match his
Son. Hereupon he swore to maintain perpetual enmity with the Moore and
his allies, and to revenge this on him. He commanded that the Child
should be tenderly nursed, and to make preparations against the Moore.
This provision, and the discipline of the young lady (who after she was
a little grown up was committed

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

to an ancient tutor), continued all the first act, with <span
class="margnote">Interludium.</span>many laudable sports beside. In the
interlude a Lyon and Griffon were set at one another, and the Lyon got
the victory; this was also a pretty sight.

<span class="rmargnote">Actus 2.</span>In the second act, the Moore, a
black, treacherous fellow, came forth, who having with vexation
understood that his murder was discovered, and that a little lady was
craftily stollen from him, began to consult how by stratagem he might
encounter so powerful an adversary, whereof he was at length advised by
certain fugitives who fled to him through famine. So the young lady,
contrary to all expectation, fell again into his hands, whom had he not
been wonderfully deceived by his own servants, he had like to have
slain. Thus this act was concluded with a mervelous triumph of the
Moore.

<span class="margnote">Actus 3.</span>In the third act a great army on
the King's part was raised against the Moore, and put under the conduct
of an ancient, valiant knight, who fell into the Moore's country, till
he forceably rescued the young Lady from a tower, and apparelled her
anew. After this they erected a glorious scaffold and placed her upon
it; presently came twelve royal embassadors, amongst whom the Knight
made a speech, alledging that the King, his most gracious Lord, had not
only heretofore delivered her from death, and caused her to be royally
brought up, though she had not behaved herself altogether as became her,
but, moreover, had, before others, elected her as a spouse for the young
Lord, his Son, most gratiously desiring that the espousals might be
really executed in case they would be sworn to his Majesty upon the
following articles. Hereupon out of a patent he caused certain glorious
conditions to be read; the young Lady took an oath inviolably to observe
the

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

same, returning thanks in most seemly sort for so high a grace.
Whereupon they began to sing to the praise of God, of the King, and the
young Lady, and for this time so departed. In sport, meanwhile, the four
beasts of <span id="img_15500"></span> ![Daniel](img/15500.jpg.md), <span
class="margnote">Interludium.</span> as he saw them in the vision, were
brought ilk, all which had its certain signification.

In the fourth act the young Lady was restored to her<span
class="rmargnote">Actus 4.</span> lost kingdom and crowned, being in
this array conducted about the place with extraordinary joy. After
various embassadors presented themselves not only to wish her prosperity
but also to behold her glory. Yet it was not long that she preserved her
integrity, but began to look wantonly about her, and to wink at the
embassadors and lords. These her manners were soon known to the Moore,
who would by no means neglect such an opportunity; and because her
steward had not sufficient regard to her, she was easily blinded with
great promises, so that she had no good confidence in her King, but
privily submitted herself to the intire disposal of the Moore, who
having by her consent gotten her into his hands, he gave her words so
long till all her kingdom had subjected itself to him; after which, in
the third scene of this act, he caused her to be led forth, stript
naked, and then upon a scurvy wooden scaffold bound to a post, well
scourged, and at last sentenced to death. This woful spectacle made the
eyes of many to run over. Naked as she was, she was cast into prison,
there to expect death by poyson, which, however, killed her not, but
made her leprous all over. Thus this act was for the most part
lamentable. Between they brought forth <span id="img_15501"></span>
![Nebuchadnezzar's](img/15501.jpg.md) image, which was adorned with all
manner of arms on the head, breast, legs, and feet, of which more shall
be spoken in the future explication.

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="margnote">Actus 5.</span>In the fifth act the young King
was acquainted with all that had passed between the Moore and his future
spouse, who interceded with his father for her, intreating that she
might not be left in that condition, and embassadors were dispatched to
comfort her, but withal to give her notice of her inconsiderateness.
She, nevertheless, would not receive them, but consented to be the
Moore's concubine, and the young King was acquainted with it. <span
class="rmargnote">Interludium.</span>After this comes a band of fools,
each of which brought a cudgel, wherewith they made a great globe of the
world, and undid it again, the which was a fine sportive phantsie.

<span class="margnote">Actus 6.</span>In the sixth act, the young King
resolved to bid battle to the Moore, which was done, and albeit the
Moore was discomfited, yet all held the young King for dead, but he came
again to himself, released his spouse, and committed her to his steward
and chaplain, the first whereof tormented her mightily, while the priest
was so insolently wicked that he would needs be above all, till the same
was reported to the young King, who dispatched one to break the neck of
the priest's mightiness, and adorn the bride in <span
class="rmargnote">Interludium.</span>some measure for the nuptials.
After this act a vast artificial elephant was brought in, carrying a
great tower with musitians, which was well pleasing to all.

<span class="margnote">Actus 7.</span>In the last act the bride-groom
appeared in such pomp as is not well to be believed. The bride met him
in the like solemnity, whereupon all the people cried out--VIVAT <span
class="rmargnote">Comædorum applansus erga Regem et
Reginam.</span>SPONSUM, VIVAT SPONSA, so that by this comedy they did
withal congratulate our King and Queen in the most stately manner, which
pleased them most extraordinary well. At length they made some pastes
about the stage, till at last they altogether began thus to sing.

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

I

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

</div>

After this thanks were returned, and the comedy was<span
class="rmargnote">Epilogus.</span> finished with joy to the particular
liking of the Royal Persons, who, the evening being already hard by,
departed in their fore-mentioned order, we attending them up the<span
class="margnote">Hospites invitantur ad cœnam Regis et Reginæ.</span>
winding stairs into the previous hall, where the tables were already
richly furnished. This was the first time that we were invited to the
King's table. The little altar was placed in the midst of the hall, and
the six royal ensignes were laid upon it. The young King behaved himself
very<span class="rmargnote">Rex Adolesc.</span> gratiously towards us,
yet he could not be heartily merry; he discoursed a little with us, yet
often sighed, at which the little Cupid only mocked, and played his
waggish tricks. The old King and Queen were very serious, but the
wife<span class="margnote">Reges adulti.</span> of one of the ancient
Kings was gay enough, the cause

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

<span class="margnote">Ordo discumbarium.</span>whereof I understood
not. The Royal Persons took up the first table, at the second we only
sate; at the third some of the principal Virgins placed themselves. The
rest were fain to wait. This was performed with such state and solemn
stillness that I am afraid to make many words of it. <span
class="rmargnote">Ornatus vestium.</span>All the Royal Persons, before
meat, attired themselves in snow-white glittering garments. Over the
table hung the great golden crown, the pretious stones whereof, without
<span class="margnote">Corona super mensam.</span>other light, would
have sufficiently illuminated the hall. All the lights were kindled at
the small taper upon the altar. The young king frequently sent meat to
the white serpent, which caused me to muse. Almost all the prattle <span
class="rmargnote">Cupido was the merriest.</span>at this banquet was
made by Cupid, who could not leave us, and me especially, untormented,
and was perpetually producing some strange matter. However, there was no
considerable mirth, from whence I could imagine some great imminent
peril. There was no musick heard, and if we were demanded anything, we
were fain to give short <span class="margnote">Sermones
breves.</span>answers, and so let it rest. In short, all things had so
strange a face that the sweat began to trickle down over my body, and I
believe that the stoutest-hearted man would have lost courage. Supper
being almost ended, the young King commanded the book to be reached him
from <span class="rmargnote">Oratio Regis adolescentis.</span>the altar.
This he opened and caused it again to be propounded to us by an old man
whether we resolved to abide with him in prosperity and adversity, which
we having with trembling consented to, he further caused us sadly to be
demanded whether we would give him our hands on it, which, when we could
fain no reason, was fain so to be. One after another rose and with his
own hand writ himself down in this book, after which the little christal
fountain was brought near, together with a very small christal glass,

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

out of which all the Royal Persons drank; afterwards it was reached to
us, and so forward to all, and this was called the Draught of Silence.
Hereupon all the Royal<span class="margnote">Haustus de silentio.</span>
Persons presented us their hands, declaring that in case we did not now
stick to them we should never hereafter see them, which verily made our
eyes run over. But our president engaged herself and promised largely on
our<span class="rmargnote">Fide jubetur virg. lucif.</span> behalf,
which gave them satisfaction. Mean time a little bell was tolled, at
which all the Royal Persons waxed so mighty bleak that we were ready
utterly to despair. They quickly put off their white garments and
assumed intirely<span class="margnote">Mors Regulorum.</span> black
ones; the whole hall was hung with black velvet, the floor covered with
the same, with which also the ceiling was overspread. The tables were
also removed, all seated themselves upon the form, and we also had put
on black habits. Our president, who was before gone out, comes in again,
bearing six black taffeta scarffs, with which she bound the six Royal
Persons’ eyes, and there were immediately brought in by the servants six
covered coffins, which were set down, a low black seat being placed in
their midst. Finally, there stept in a cole-black, tall man, who bare in
his hand a sharp ax. Now after that the old King<span
class="rmargnote">Decollatio Regum.</span> had been brought to the seat,
his head was instantly whipt off and wrapped in a black cloth, the blood
being received in a great golden goblet, and placed with him in the
coffin that stood by, which, being covered, was set aside. Thus it went
with the rest, so that I thought it would have come to me too, but as
soon as the six Royal Persons were beheaded, the black man retired,
another following who just before the door beheaded him also, and
brought back<span class="margnote">Carnificis.</span> his head, which,
with the ax, was laid in a little chest. This indeed seemed to me a
bloody Wedding, but, because

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I could not tell
what the event would be, I was fain to captivate my understanding until
I were further resolved. <span class="margnote">Hospites mærent.
Solatium.</span>The Virgin, seeing that some of us were faint-hearted
and wept, bid us be content, saying:--"The life of these standeth now in
your hands, and in case you follow me, this death shall make many
alive."

Herewith she intimated we should go sleep and trouble ourselves no
further, for they should have their due right. She bade us all good
night, saying that she must watch the <span class="rmargnote">Cura
nocturna mortuorum.</span>dead corps. We then were conducted by our
Pages into our lodgings. My Page talked with me of sundry matters, and
gave me cause enough to admire his understanding, but his intention was
to lull me asleep, which at last I observed, whereupon I made as though
I was fast asleep, but no sleep came to my eyes, and I could not put the
beheaded out of my mind. Now my lodging was directly <span
class="margnote">Cubiculum.</span>over against the great lake, so that I
could look upon <span class="rmargnote">Visio nocturna.</span>it, the
windows being nigh the bed. About midnight I espied on the lake a great
fire, wherefore I quickly opened the window to see what would become of
it. Then from far I saw seven ships making forward all full of lights.
Above each of them hovered a flame that passed to and fro, and sometimes
descended, so that I could lightly judge that it must needs be the
spirits of the beheaded. The ships gently approached to land, and each
had no more than one mariner. When they were gotten to shore, I espied
our Virgin with a torch going towards them, after <span
class="margnote">Cadavera avehuntur trans Lacum.</span>whom the six
covered coffins, together with the little m. chest, were carried, and
each was privily laid in a ship. Wherefore I awaked my Page, who hugely
thanked me, for having run much up and down all day, he might quite have
over-slept this, though he well knew it. As

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

soon as the coffins were laid in the ships, all the lights were
extinguished, and the six flames passed back together over the lake, so
that there was but one light for a watch in each ship. There were also
some hundreds of watchmen encamped on the shore, who sent the Virgin
back again into the Castle, she carefully bolting all up again; so that
I could judge that there was nothing more to be done this night. We
again betook ourselves to rest. I only of all<span
class="margnote">Autor solus hæc vidit.</span> my company had a chamber
towards the lake and saw this. Then being extream weary I fell asleep in
my manifold speculations.
