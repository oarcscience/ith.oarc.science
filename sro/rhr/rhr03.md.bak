### INTRODUCTION.

"In cruce sub sphera venit sapientia vera."--*Hermetic Axiom*.

"La rose qui a été de tout temps l’emblême de la beauté, de la vie, de
l’amour et du plaisir, exprimait mystiquement toutes les protestations
manifestées à la renaissance. . . . Rénuir la rose, à la croix, tel
était le problème posé par la Haute Initiation."--*Éliphas Lévi*.

THREE derivations are offered of the name Rosicrucian. The first, which
is certainly the most obvious, deduces it from the ostensible founder of
the order, Christian Rosenkreuze. I shall show, however, that the
history of this personage is evidently mythical or allegorical, and
therefore this explanation merely cakes the inquiry a step backward to
the question, What is the etymology of Rosenkreuze? The second
derivation proposed is from the Latin words *Ros*, dew, and *Crux*,
cross. This has been countenanced by Mosheim, who is followed by Ree's
Encyclopædia; and other publications. The argument in its favour may be
fairly represented by the following quotation:--"Of all natural bodies,
dew was deemed the most powerful dissolvent of gold; and the cross, in
chemical language, was equivalent to light; because the figure of a
cross exhibits at the same time the three letters of which the word lux,
or light, is compounded. Now, lux is called . . . the seed or menstruum
of the red dragon, or, in other words, that gross and corporeal light,
which, when properly

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

digested and modified, produces gold. Hence it follows, if this
etymology be admitted, that a Rosycrucian philosopher is one who by the
intervention and assistance of the dew, seeks for light, or, in other
words, the substance called the Philosopher's Stone." <span
id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)

This opinion exaggerates the importance attributed to the dew of the
alchemists. The universal dissolvent has figured under various names, of
which *ros* is by no means most general; the comprehensive "Lexicon
Alchymiæ" does not mention it. According to Gaston le Doux, in his
"Dictionnaire Hermétique," Dew, simply so called, signifies Mercury; Dew
of the Philosophers is the matter of the stone when under the
manipulation of the artist, and chiefly during its circulations in the
philosophical egg. The White and Celestial Dew of the Wise is the
philosophical stone perfected to the White. Mosheim derived his opinion
from Peter Gassendi, <span id="fr_6"></span>[2](#fn_6.md) and from a writer
in Eusebius Renandot's "Conferences Publiques," <span
id="fr_7"></span>[3](#fn_7.md) who confesses that he knew nothing
whatsoever of the Rosicrucians till the task of speaking on the subject
was imposed on him by the *Bureau d’Addresse*. He says:--"Dew, the most
powerful dissolvent of gold which is to be found among natural and
non-corrosive substances, is nothing else but light coagulated and
rendered corporeal; when it is artistically concocted and digested in
its own vessel during a suitable period it is the true menstruum of the
Red Dragon, *i.e.*, of gold, the true matter of the Philosophers. The
society desiring to bequeath to posterity the ineffaceable sign of this
secret, caused them to adopt the name *Frères de la Rozée Cuite*." The
mystic triad

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

of the Society, F. R. C., has been accordingly interpreted *Fratres
Roris Cocti*, the Brotherhood of the Concocted or Exalted Dew, but the
explanation has little probability in itself.

"Several chemists," says Pernetz, in his "Dictionnaire
Mytho-Hermétique," "have regarded the dew of May and September as the
matter of the *Magnum Opus*, influenced doubtless by the opinion of
various authors that dew was the reservoir of the universal spirit of
Nature. . . . But when we seriously study the texts of the true
philosophers, wherein they snake reference to dew, we are soon convinced
that they only speak of it by a similitude, and that theirs is metallic,
that is, it is the mercurial water sublimated into vapour within the
vase, and precipitated at the bottom in the form of fine rain. Thus when
they write of the dew of the month of May, they are referring to that of
their philosophic Spring, which is governed by the gemini of the
alchemical Zodiack, which differs from the ordinary astronomical
Zodiack. Philalethes has positively said that their dew is their
mercurial water rising from putrefaction."

The third derivation is that which was generally adopted, even from the
beginning, by writers directly or indirectly connected with the
Rosicrucians. It deduces the term in question from the words *rosa*,
rose, and *crux*. This is sanctioned by various editions of the
society's authoritative documents, which characterise it as the
Broederschafft des Roosen Creutzes, that is, the Rose-Crucians, or
*Fratres Rosatæ Crucis*, according to the "Confessio Recepta," terms
quite excluding the conception of dew, which in German is Thau, while in
Latin the Brothers of the Dewy Cross would be *Fratres Roratæ Crucis*.
This derivation is also supported by the supposed symbol of the Order,
whose "emblem,

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

monogram, or jewel," says Godfrey Higgins, "is a Red Rose on a Cross,
thus:--

<span id="img_00800"></span> ![](img/00800.jpg)

When it can be done it is surmounted with a glory and placed on a
calvary. When it is worn appended and made of cornelian, garnet, ruby,
or red glass, the calvary and glory are generally omitted." <span
id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8.md)

Mr Hargrave Jennings, who borrows the whole of this passage <span
id="fr_9"></span>[2](#fn_9.md) without acknowledgment of any kind, also
tells us that "the jewel of the Rosicrucians is formed of a transparent
red stone with a red cross on one side and a red rose on the other--thus
it is a crucified rose."

All derivations, however, are to some extent doubtful and tentative. The
official proclamations of the Society are contained in the "Fama
Fraternitatis," and in the "Confessio Fraternitatis," which, in their
original editions, appear to describe it simply as the *Fraternitas de
R. C.*, while the initials of its founder are given as C. R. "The
Chemical Nuptials of Christian Rosen Kreuze," published anonymously at
Strasbourg in 1616, and undeniably connected with the order, seem to
identify it as the Brotherhood of the Rose-Cross, and its founder as
Father Rosycross. These designations at any rate were immediately
adopted in Germany, and they appear in the subsequent editions of both
manifestos,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

though as early as 1618 I find Michael Maier, the alchemist, expressing
a different opinion on this point in his "Themis Aurea, hoc est, De
Legibus Fraternitatis R. C. Tractatus." "No long time elapsed, when the
Society first became known by that which was written, before an
interpreter came forward who conjectured those letters to signify the
Rose Cross, in which opinion the matter remains till this present,
notwithstanding that the Brothers in subsequent writings do affirm it to
be erroneously so denominated, and testify that the letters R. C. denote
the name of their first inaugurator. <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)
If the mind of one man could search that of another and behold formed
therein the idea or sensible and intelligible form, there would be no
necessity for speech or writing among men. But this being denied to us
while we subsist in this corporeal nature, though doubtless granted to
pure intelligences, we explain our rational conceptions one to another
by the symbols of language and writing. Therefore letters are of high
efficacy when they embrace a whole society and maintain order therein,
nor is an opportunity afforded to the curious to draw omens from
integral names, nor from families situations, nor from places persons,
nor from persons the secrets of affairs."

Proposing his own definitions, he says:--"I am no augur nor prophet,
notwithstanding that once I partook of the laurel, and reposed a few
brief hours in the shadow of Parnassus; nevertheless, if I err not, I
have unfolded the significance of the characters R. C. in the enigmas of
the sixth book of the Symbols of the Golden Table. R signifies Pegasus,
and C, if the sense not the sound be considered,

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

*lilium*. Let the KNOWLEDGE OF THE ARCANA be the key to thee. Lo, I give
thee the Arcanum! d. wmml. zii. w. sgqqhka. x. Open if thou canst. . . .
Is not this the hoof of the Red Lion or the drops of the Hippocrene
fountain?" Beneath this barbarous jargon we discern, however, an analogy
with the Rose symbolism. Classical tradition informs us that the Red
Rose sprang from the blood of Adonis, but Pegasus was a winged horse
which sprang from the blood of Medusa, and the fountain of Hippocrene
was produced by a stroke of the hoof of Pegasus.

In England the pseudonymous author of the "Summum Bonum," who is
supposed to be Robert Fludd, gives a purely religious explanation of the
Rose Cross symbol, asserting it to mean "the Cross sprinkled with the
rosy blood of Christ." <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11.md) The general
concensus of opinion is preferable to fanciful interpretations, and we
may therefore safely take the words *Rosa* and *Crux* as explanatory of
the name Rosicrucian, and by *Fratres R. C.* we may understand *Fratres
Roseæ Crucis*, despite the silence of the manifestos and the protests of
individual alchemists.

The next question which occurs is the significance of this curious
emblem--a Red Rose affixed to a red, or, according to some authors, a
golden cross. This question cannot be definitely answered.
The-characteristic sign of a secret society will be naturally as
mysterious as itself in the special meaning which the society may attach
to it, but some intelligence concerning it can perhaps be gleaned from
its analysis with universal symbolism. Now, the Rose and the Cross, in
their separate significance, are emblems of the most palmary importance
and the highest antiquity.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

There is a Silver Rose, called Tamara Pua, in the Paradise of the
Brahmans. "This Paradise is a garden in heaven, to which celestial
spirits are first admitted on their ascent from the terrestrial sphere.
The Rose contains the images of two women, as bright and fair as a
pearl; but these two are only one, though appearing as if distinct
according to the medium, celestial or terrestrial, through which they
are viewed. In the first aspect she is called the Lady of the Mouth, in
the other, the Lady of the Tongue, or the Spirit of Tongues. In the
centre of this Silver Rose, God has his permanent residence."

A correspondence will be readily recognised between this divine woman or
virgin--two and yet one, who seems to typify the Logos, the Spirit of
Wisdom, and the Spirit of Truth--and the two-edged sword of the Spirit
in the Apocalypse, the *Sapientia quæ ex ore Altissimii prodiit*, as it
is called in the sublime Advent antiphon of the Latin Church. The
mystical Rose in the centre of the allegorical garden is continually met
with in legend. Buddha is said to have been crucified for robbing a
garden of a flower, <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) and after a
common fashion of mythology, the divine Avatar of the Indians is
henceforth identified with the object for which he suffered, and he
becomes himself "a flower, a Rose, a Padma, Lotus, or Lily." Thus he is
the Rose crucified, and we must look to the far East for the origin of
the Rosicrucian emblem. According to Godfrey Higgins, this is "the Rose
of Isuren, of Tamul, and of Sharon, crucified for the salvation of
men--crucified," he continues, "in the heavens at the vernal equinox."
In this connection we may remember the

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gnostic legend
that Christ was crucified in the Empyrean; and as Nazareth, according to
St Jerome, signified the flower, and was situated in Carmel, "the
vineyard or garden of God," Jesus of Nazareth, by a common extension of
the symbolism, is sometimes identified as this crucified flower. <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md)

In classical fable, the garden of Midas, the King of the Phrygians, was
situated at the foot of Mount Bermion, and was glorified by the presence
of roses with sixty petals, which exhaled an extraordinary fragrance.
Now, the rose was sacred to Dionysius, or Bacchus, and Bacchus endowed
Midas with the power of transmuting everything into gold; so here is a
direct connection between the Rose and Alchemy.

In the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, Lucius is restored to his human shape
by devouring a chaplet of roses. Everywhere the same typology meets us.
The Peruvian Eve sinned by plucking roses, which are also called *Frute
del Arbor*. <span id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14.md) A messenger from heaven
announces to the Mexican Eve that she will bear a Son who shall bruise
the serpent's head; he presents her with a Rose, and this gift was
followed by an Age of Roses, as in India there was the Age of the Lotus.

There are occasional allusions to the Rose in the Hebrew Scriptures, but
it is used as a poetic image rather than an arcane symbol, and as such
it has been always in high favour with poets. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[3](#fn_15.md)

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

In the west it appears for the first time in allegorical literature as
the central figure in the "four-square garden" of the ancient "Romance
of the Rose." The first part of this poem was written by Guillaume de
Lorris before the year 1260, and it was completed by Jean de Meung,
whose death occurred in the year 1316, according to the general opinion.
This extraordinary work, once of universal popularity, is supposed by
some of its commentators to admit of an alchemical interpretation, and
openly professes the principles of the *Magnum Opus*. <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) The garden, or *vergier*, which contains
the Rose, is richly sculptured on its outer walls with symbolical
figures of Hatred, Treason, Meanness, Covetousness, Avarice, Envy,
Sadness, Age, Hypocrisy, Poverty--all the vices and miseries of
mortality. Idleness opens the gate to him, Merriment greets him and
draws him into the dance, and then he beholds the God of Love,
accompanied by *Dous-Regars*, a youth who carries his bows and arrows,
by Beauty, Wealth, Bounty, Frankness, Courtesy, &c. The lover, while he
is contemplating the loveliness of the Rose,

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It will require no
acquaintance with the methods of the symbolists to discern the
significance of this allegory:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

*La Rose c’est d’Amour le guerdon gracieux*. <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md)

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But a little later
the same emblem reappears in the sublime poem of Dante. The Paradise of
the *Divina Commedia* 

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

consists, says Eliphas Lévi, of "a series of Kabbalistic circles divided
by a Cross, like Ezekiel's pantacle; a Rose blossoms in the centre of
this Cross, and it is for the first time that we find the symbol of the
Rosicrucians publicly and almost categorically revealed."

The passage referred to, so far as regards the Rose, is as follows:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"There is in heaven a light, whose goodly shine  
Makes the Creator visible to all  
Created, that in seeing him alone  
Have peace; and in a circle spreads so far,  
That the circumference were too loose a zone  
To girdle in the sun. All is one beam,  
Reflected from the summit of the first,  
That moves, which being hence and vigour takes.  
And as some cliff; that from the bottom eyes  
His image mirror’d in the crystal flood,  
As if to admire his brave apparelling  
Of verdure and of flowers; so, round about,  
Eyeing the light, on more than million thrones,  
Stood, eminent, whatever from our earth  
Has to the skies return’d. How wide the leaves  
Extended to their utmost, of this ROSE,  
Whose lowest step embosoms such a space  
Of ample radiance! Yet, nor amplitude  
Nor height impeded, but my view with ease  
Took in the full dimension of that joy.  
Near or remote, what then avails, *where God  
Immediate rules*, <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) and Nature, awed,
suspends  
Her sway? Into the yellow of the Rose  
Perennial, which, in bright expansiveness,  
Lays forth its gradual blooming, redolent  
Of praises to the never-wintering sun. . . .  
Beatrice led me. . . .</span>

</div>

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">In fashion as a snow-white Rose lay then  
Before my view the saintly multitude,  
Which in his own blood Christ espoused. Meanwhile  
That other host that soar aloft to gaze  
And celebrate His glory whom they love,  
Hovered around, and like a troop of bees  
Amid the vernal sweets alighting now,  
Now clustering where their fragrant labour glows,  
Flew downward to the mighty flower; a rose  
From the redundant petals streaming back  
Unto the steadfast dwelling of their joy.  
Faces had they of flame, and wings of gold:  
The rest was whiter than the driven snow.  
And as they flitted down into the flower,  
From range to range fanning their plumy loins,  
Whispered the peace and ardour which they won  
From that soft winnowing. Shadow none, the vast  
Interposition of such numerous flights  
Cast from above, upon the flower, or view  
Obstructed aught. For through the Universe  
Wherever merited, Celestial Light  
Glides freely, and no obstacle prevents.  
               CARY'S DANTE, "The Paradise," xxx., xxxi.</span>

</div>

"Not without astonishment will it be discovered," continues Lévi, that
the *Roman de la Rose* and the Divine Comedy are two opposite forms of
the same work--initiation into intellectual independence, satire on all
contemporary institutions and allegorical formulations of the great
secrets of the Rosicrucian Society. These important manifestations of
occultism coincide with the epoch of the downfall of the Templars, since
Jean de Meung or Clopinel, contemporary of Dante's old age, flourished
during his most brilliant years at the Court of Philippe le Bel. The
'Romance of the Rose' is the epic of ancient France. It is a profound
work in a trivial guise, as learned an exposition of the mysteries of
occultism as that of Apuleius. The Rose of Flamel, of Jean de Meung, and
of Dante, blossomed on the same rose-tree."

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

This is ingenious and interesting, but it assumes the point in question,
namely, the antiquity of the Rosicrucian Fraternity, which, it is
needless to say, cannot be proved by the mere existence of their symbols
in the mystical poetry of a remote period. In the Paradise of Dante we
find, however, the emblem whose history we are tracing, placed, and
assuredly not without reason, in the supreme, central heaven amidst the
intolerable manifestation of the Untreated Light, the Shecinah of
Rabbinical theosophy, <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) the chosen
habitation of God--"a sacred Rose and Flower of Light, brighter than a
million suns, immaculate, inaccessible, vast, fiery with magnificence,
and surrounding God as if with a million veils. This symbolic Rose is as
common a hierogram throughout the vast temples and palaces of the
Ancient East as it is in the immense ruins of Central America." <span
id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md)

From the time of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines a common device in
heraldry is the Rose-Emblem. It figures on our English coins; it is used
as a royal badge in the Civil War between the houses of York and
Lancaster, it is associated above all with the great mediæval cultus of
the Mother of God, being our Lady's flower *par excellence*, as the lily
is characteristic of St Joseph. "As an emblem of the Virgin, the Rose,
both white and red, appears at a very early period; it was especially so
recognised by St Dominic, when he instituted the devotion of the rosary,
with direct reference to St Mary. The prayers appear to have been
symbolised as roses." <span id="fr_22"></span>[3](#fn_22.md) In Scandinavia
the same flower was sacred to the goddess Holda, who is called "Frau

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rosa," and "it was
partly transferred, as were other emblems of Holda, Freyja, and Venus,
to the Madonna, who is frequently called by the Germans, Mariën-Röschen
. . . But there has been a tendency to associate the White Rose with the
Virgin Mary, that being chiefly chosen for her feast-days, while the
more earthly feelings associated with the 'Frau Rosa,' are still
represented in the superstitions connected with the Red Rose."

In Germany it appears as the symbol of silence. It was sculptured on the
ceiling of the banquet hall to warn the guests against the repetition of
what was heard beneath it. "The White Rose was especially sacred to
silence. It was carved in the centre of the Refectory of the ancients
for the same reason," and the expression *Sub Rosa*, which was
equivalent among the Romans to an inviolable pledge, originated in the
ancient dedication of the flower to Aphrodite, and its reconsecration by
Cupid to Harpocrates, the tutelary deity of Silence, to induce him to
conceal the amours of the goddess of love.

In mediæval alchemy Rosa signifies Tartarum, and in the twelfth Clavis
of Basil Valentine there is a vase or yoni with a pointed lingam rising
from its centre, and having on each side a sprig surmounted by a Rose.
Above is the well-known emblem

<span id="img_01800"></span> ![](img/01800.jpg)

which symbolises the accomplishment of the *Magnum Opus*, while through
an open window the sun and moon shed down their benign influence and
concur in the consummation of the ineffable act. <span
id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md)

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

The same Rose-symbol is to be found in the hieroglyphics of Nicholas
Flamel--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                           The mystic Rose  
Of Hermic lore, which issues bright and fair,  
Strange virtues circling with the sap therein,  
Beneath the Universal Spirit's breath,  
From the Mercurial Stone.</span>

</div>

Finally, in 1598, Henry Khunrath, a supreme alchemical adept, published
his "Amphitheatrum Sapientiæ Æternæ," containing nine singular
pantacles, of which the fifth is a Rose of Light, in whose centre there
is a human form extending its arms in the form of a cross, and thus
reversing the order.

The Cross is a hierogram of, if possible, still higher antiquity than
the floral emblem. It is at any rate more universal and contains a
loftier and more arcane significance. Its earliest form is the *Crux
Ansata*,

<span id="img_01900"></span> ![](img/01900.jpg)

which, according to some authorities, signified hidden wisdom, and the
life of the world to come; according to others, it is the lingam; as the
hieroglyphic sign of Venus it is an ancient allegorical figure, and
represents the metal copper in alchemical typology. The *Crux Ansat*a
and the Tau

<span id="img_01901"></span> ![](img/01901.jpg)

are met with on most Egyptian monuments. In the latter form it was an
emblem of the creative and generative energy, and, according to Payne
Knight, was, even in pre-Christian times, a sign of salvation.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

The Cross, "the symbol of symbols," was used also by the Chaldæans; by
the Phoenicians, who placed it on their coins; by the Mexicans, who paid
honour to it and represented their God of the Air, nailed and immolated
thereon; by the Peruvians, who, in a sacred chamber of their palace,
kept and venerated a splendid specimen carved from a single piece of
fine jasper or marble; and by the British Druids. It was emblazoned on
the banners of Egypt, and in that country, as in China, was used to
indicate "a land of corn and plenty." When divided into four equal
segments it symbolised the primeval abode of man, the traditional
Paradise of Eden. It entered into the monograms of Osiris, of Jupiter
Ammon, and of Saturn; the Christians subsequently adopted it, and the
Labarum of Constantine is identical with the device of Osiris. It is
equally common in India, and, according to Colonel Wilford, is exactly
the Cross of the Manichees, with leaves, flowers, and fruits springing
from it. It is called the divine tree, the tree of the gods, the tree of
life and knowledge, and is productive of all things good and
desirable. <span id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md)

According to Godfrey Higgins we must go to the Buddhists for the origin
of the Cross, "and to the Lama of Thibet, who takes his name from the
Cross, called in his language Lamh." The Jamba, or cosmic tree, which
Wilford calls, the tree of life and knowledge, figures in their maps of
the "world as a cross 84 joganas (answering to the 84 years of the life
of Him who was exalted upon the Cross), or 423 miles high, including the
three steps of the Calvary, with which, after the orthodox Catholic

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

fashion, it was invariably represented. The neophyte of the Indian
Initiations was sanctified by the sign of a Cross, which was marked on
every part of his body. After his perfect regeneration it was again set
upon his forehead <span id="img_02100"></span> ![](img/02100.jpg) and
inverted <span id="img_02101"></span> ![](img/02101.jpg) upon his
breast. <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md)

The paschal lamb of the Jewish passover was roasted on a cross-shaped
wooden spit, and with this sign Ezekiel ordered the people to be marked
who were to be spared by the destroyer. Thus it figures as a symbol of
salvation, but classical mythology attributes its invention to Ixion,
who was its first victim. As an instrument of suffering and death, it is
not, however, to be found on ancient monuments. It had no orthodox shape
among the Romans when applied to this purpose, and the victims were
either tied or nailed, "being usually left to perish by thirst and
hunger." <span id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md)

In the Christendom of both the East and West this divine symbol has a
history too generally known to need recapitulation here. On this point
the student may consult the "Dictionary of Christian Antiquities," where
a mass of information is collected.

The following interesting passage will show the connection which exists
between the Cross and alchemy. "In common chemistry," says Pernetz,
crosses form characters which indicate the crucible, vinegar, and
distilled vinegar. But as regards hermetic science, the Cross is . . .
the symbol of the four elements. And as the philosophical stone is
composed of the most pure substance of the grosser elements . . ., they
have said, In *cruce salus*, salvation is in the Cross; by comparison
with the salvation of our souls purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ
who hung on the

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

tree of the Cross. Some of them have even pushed their audacity further,
and fear not to employ the terms of the New Testament to form their
allegories and enigmas. Jean de Roquetaillade, known under the name of
*Jean de Rupe Scissa*, and Arnaud de Villeneuve, say in their works on
the composition of the Stone of the Philosophers:--It is needful that
the Son of Man be lifted up on the Cross before being glorified; to
signify the volatilisation of the fixed and igneous part of the
matter." <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md)

I have briefly traced the typological history of the Rose and Cross. It
is obvious, as I have already remarked, that the antiquity of these
emblems is no proof of the antiquity of a society which we find to be
using them at a period subsequent to the Renaissance. It does not even
suppose that society's initiation into the hieratic secrets which the
elder world may have summarised in those particular symbols. In the case
which is in question, such a knowledge would [involve](errata.htm#0.md) the
antiquity of the Rosicrucians, because it is only at a time long
subsequent to their first public appearance that the past has been
sufficiently disentombed to uncover the significance of its symbols to
uninitiated students. Can a correspondence be established between the
meaning of the Rose and the Cross as they are used by the ancient
hierogrammatists, and that of the Rose-Cross as it is used by the
Rosicrucian Fraternity? This is the point to be ascertained. If a
connection there be, then in some way, we may not know what, the secret
has been handed down from generation to generation, and the mysterious
brotherhood which manifested its existence spontaneously at the
beginning of the seventeenth century, is affiliated with the hierophants
of Egypt and India, who,

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

almost in the night of time, devised their allegories and emblems for
the blind veneration of the vulgar and as lights to those who knew.

In the fifth book of the "Histoire de la Magie," Eliphas Lévi provides
the following commentary on the Rosicrucian symbol:--

"The Rose, which from time immemorial has been the symbol of beauty and
life, of love and pleasure, expressed in a mystical manner all the
protestations of the Renaissance. It was the flesh revolting against the
oppression of the spirit, it was Nature declaring herself to be, like
grace, the daughter of God, it was love refusing to be stifled by the
celibate, it was life desiring to be no longer barren, it was humanity
aspiring to a natural religion, full of love and reason, founded on the
revelation of the harmonies of existence of which the Rose was for
initiates the living and blooming symbol. The Rose, in fact, is a
pantacle; its form is circular, the leaves of the corolla are
heart-shaped, and are supported harmoniously by one another; its colour
presents the most delicate shades of primitive hues; its calyx is purple
and gold. . . . The conquest of the Rose was the problem offered by
initiation to science, while religion toiled to prepare and establish
the universal, exclusive, and definitive triumph of the Cross.

"The reunion of the Rose and the Cross, such was the problem proposed by
supreme initiation, and, in effect, occult philosophy, being the
universal synthesis, should take into account all the phenomena of
Being."

This extremely suggestive explanation has the characteristic ingenuity
of the hierophants of theosophical science, but it has no application
whatsoever to the ostensible or

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

ascertainable aims of the Rosicrucian adepts. It is the product of
intellectual subtlety and the poetic gift of discerning curious
analogies; it is quite beside the purpose of serious historical inquiry,
and my object in quoting it here is to show by the mere fact of its
existence that the whole question of the significance of the Crucified
Rose, in its connection with the society, is one of pure conjecture,
that no Rosicrucian manifestos and no acknowledged Brother have ever
given any explanation concerning it, and that no presumption is afforded
by the fact of its adoption for the antiquity of the society or for its
connection with universal symbolism.

The researches of various writers, all more or less competent, have
definitely established the *Crux Ansata* as typical of the male and
female generative organs in the act of union, the Egyptian Tau, with its
variants as typical of the masculine potency, and the Rose as the
feminine emblem. Then by a natural typological evolution the Cross came
to signify the divine creative energy which fecundated the obscure
matrix of the primeval substance and caused it to bring forth the
universe. The simple union of the Rose and the Cross suggests the same
meaning as the *Crux Ansata*, but the crucified Buddhistic Rose may be a
symbol of the asceticism which destroys natural desire. There is little
correspondence, in either case, with known Rosicrucian tenets, and,
therefore, the device of the Rose-Cross is separated from ancient
symbolism, and is either a purely arbitrary and thus unexplainable sign,
or its significance is to be sought elsewhere.

Now, I purpose to show that the Rosicrucians were united with a
movement, which, originating in Germany, was destined to revolutionise
the world of thought and to

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

transform the face of Europe; that the symbols of the Rose and the Cross
were prominently and curiously connected with this movement, and that
the subsequent choice of these emblems by the secret society in
question, followed naturally from the fact of this connection, and is
easily explainable thereby. To accomplish this task satisfactorily, I
must first lay before my readers the facts and documents which I have
collected concerning the Fraternity.
