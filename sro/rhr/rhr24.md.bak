*The Real History of the Rosicrucians*, by Arthur Edward Waite,
\[1887\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Apologue for an Epilogue*.

I shall here tell you what Rosie Crucians are, and that Moses was their
Father, and he was Θεοῦ παῖς; some say they were of the order of Elias,
some say the Disciples of Ezekiel; others define them to be the Officers
of the Generalissimo of the World, that are as the eyes and ears of the
Great King, <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md) seeing and hearing all
things; they are seraphically illuminated, as Moses was, according to
this order of the Elements, Earth refined to Water, Water to Air, Air to
Fire, so of a man to be one of the Heroes, of a Hero a Daemon, or good
Genius, of a Genius a partaker of Divine things, and a companion of the
holy company of unbodied Soules and immortal Angels, and according to
their vehicles, a versatile, life, turning themselves, Proteus-like,
into any shape.

But there are yet arguments to procure Mr Walfoord, and T. Williams,
Rosie Crucians by election, and that is the miracles that were done by
them in my sight; for it should seem Rosie Crucians were not only
initiated into the Mosaical Theory, but have arrived also to the power
of working miracles, as Moses, Elias, Ezekiel, and the succeeding
Prophets did, being transported where they please, and one of these went
from me to a friend of mine in Devonshire, and came and brought me an
answer to

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

London the same day, which is four dayes journey; they taught me
excellent predictions of Astrology and Earthquakes; they slack the
Plague in Cities; they silence the violent Winds and Tempests; they calm
the rage of the Sea and Rivers; they walk in the Air; they frustrate the
malicious aspect of Witches; they cure all Diseases. I desired one of
these to tell me whether my Complexion were capable of the society of my
good Genius? When I see you again, said he, I will tell you, which is
when he pleases to come to me, for I know not where to go to him. When I
saw him again, then he said, Ye should pray to God; for a good and holy
man can offer no more acceptable sacrifice to God than the oblation of
himself, his soul. <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md)

He said also, that the good Genii are as the benigne eyes of God,
running to and fro in the world, with love and pity beholding the
innocent endeavours of harmless and single-hearted men, ever ready to do
them good, and to help them; at his going away he bid me beware of my
seeming friends, who would do me all the hurt they could, and cause the
Governours of the Nations to be angry with me, and set bounds to my
liberty: which truly happened to me. Many things more he told me before
we parted, hut I shall not name them here.

This Rosie Crucian Physick or Medecines, I happily and unexpectedly
light upon in Arabia, which will prove a restauration of health to all
that are afflicted with sickness which we ordinarily call natural, and
all other diseases. These men have no small insight into the body;
Walfoord, Williams, and others of the Fraternity now living, may bear up
in the same likely equipage with those noble Divine

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Spirits their
Predecessors; though the unskilfulness in men commonly acknowledges more
of supernatural assistance in hot, unsettled fancies, and perplexed
melancholy, than in the calm and distinct use of reason; yet for mine
own part, I look upon these Rosie Crucians above all men truly inspired,
and more than any that professed themselves so this sixteen hundred
years, and I am ravished with admiration of their miracles and
transcendant mechanical inventions, for the salving the Phænomena of the
world; I may without offence, therefore, compare them with Bezaliel and
Aholiab, those skilful workers of the Tabernacle, who, as Moses
testifies, were filled with the Spirit of God, and therefore were of an
excellent understanding to find out all manner of curious work.

Nor is it any more argument that those Rosie Crucians were not inspired,
because they do not say they are, then that others are inspired, because
they say they are; the suppression of what so happened would argue
sobriety and modesty, when as the profession of it with sober men would
be suspected of some piece of melancholy and distraction, especially in
these things, where the grand pleasure is the evidence and exercise of
reason, not a bare belief, or an ineffable sense of life, in respect
whereof there is no true Christian but he is inspired. If any more
zealous pretender to prudence and righteousness, wanting either leisure
or ability to examine these Rosie Crucian Medecines to the bottome,
shall notwithstanding either condemn them or admire them, he hath
unbecoming ventured out of his sphere, and I cannot acquit him of
injustice or folly. Nor am I a Rosie Crucian, nor do I speak of spite,
or hope of gain, or for any such matter; there is no cause, God knows; I
envie no man, be he what he will be; I am no Physitian

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

never was, nor never mean to be: what I am it makes no matter as to my
profession.

Lastly, these holy and good. men would have me know that the greatest
sweet and perfection of a vertuous soul is the kindly accomplishment of
her own nature, in true wisdome and divine love; and these miraculous
things that are done by them are performed in order that the worth and
knowledge within them may be taken notice of, and that God thereby may
be glorified, whose witnesses they are; but no other happiness accrues
to them, but that hereby they may be in a better capacity of making
others happy.

This "Apologue" forms a sort of preface to the sixth book of "The Holy
Guide," which is thus entitled--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The Rosie Cross Uncovered, and the Places,  
       Temples, Holy Houses, Castles, and  
       Invisible Mountains of the Brethren  
       discovered and communicated to the  
       World, for the full satisfaction of  
       Philosophers, Alchymists, Astromancers,  
       Geomancers, Physitians, and Astronomers.  
By John Heydon, Gent, φιλόνομος, a Servant of God, and  
                a Secretary of Nature.</span>

</div>

This publication is a sort of perverted version of the "Fama
Fraternitatis." It represents the Rosicrucians as acknowledging the
renewed church in England, and its Christian head Carolus Magnus
Secundus, and warning "all learned men to take heed of the 'Aurum
Chymicum Britannicum,' published by Elias Ashmole, Esquire." <span
id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106.md) It contains some information on English
Rosicrucians, which can hardly be taken seriously even by an
enthusiastic

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

believer, but which is worth reprinting on account of the curiosity of
its details.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_104"></span>[333:1](rhr24.htm#fr_104.md) This is stolen from a
treatise on the Immortality of the Soul by Henry More, the Platonist,
who applies it to the beneficent genii.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[334:1](rhr24.htm#fr_105.md) This remark is also
pirated from the same treatise by Henry More.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[336:1](rhr24.htm#fr_106.md) A reason for this
animosity will be found in the preface of Ashmole's "Way to Bliss,"
which states that work to have been published to prevent the issue of an
imperfect copy by Heydon, which Heydon, however, denies.
