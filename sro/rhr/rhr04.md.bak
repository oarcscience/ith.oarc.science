# HISTORY OF THE ROSICRUCIANS.

### CHAPTER I.

#### ON THE STATE OF MYSTICAL PHILOSOPHY IN GERMANY AT THE CLOSE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.

THE traditions of the Neo-Platonic philosophy, with its elaborate
theurgical system, were to some extent perpetuated through the whole
period of the Middle Ages, for beside the orthodox theology of the great
Latin Church, and amidst the clamour of scholastic philosophy, we find
the secret theosophy of the magician, the Kabbalist, and the alchemical
adept borrowing, directly or indirectly, from this prolific fountain of
exalted mysticism. The traces of its influence are discoverable in
Augustine, in Albertus Magnus, in St Thomas, the angel of the schools,
and in other shining lights of western Christendom, while the
metaphysical principles of Johannes Scotus Erigena, even so early as the
close of the ninth century, were an actual revival of this philosophy.
He translated the extraordinary works of Pseudo-Dionysius on the
celestial hierarchies, the divine names, &c., which were an application
of Platonism to Christianity, <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) "and
proved a rich mine to the mystics."

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This translation
was largely circulated and held in the highest repute, more especially
in Germany, where the Areopagite was appealed to as an authority by
Eckhart at the beginning of the fourteenth century. At this time Germany
was a stronghold of mysticism, which, according to Ueberweg, <span
id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) was at first chiefly developed in sermons
by monks of the Dominican Order; its aim was to advance Christianity by
edifying speculation, and to render it comprehensible by the
transcendent use of the reason. "The author and perfecter of this entire
development was Master Eckhart," who taught that the creature apart from
the Absolute, that is, from God, was nothing, that "time, space, and the
plurality which depends on them," are also nothing in themselves, and
that "the duty of man as a moral being is to rise beyond this
nothingness of the creature, and by direct intuition to place himself in
immediate union with the Absolute." <span id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30.md)

Eckhart was followed by Tauler, a great light of German mysticism, and
one profoundly versed in the mysteries of the spiritual and interior
life. A century later, with the revival of Platonism, came the Cardinal
Nicolas Cusanus, "a man of rare sagacity, and an able mathematician, who
arranged and republished the Pythagorean ideas, to which he was much
inclined, in a very original manner, by the aid of his mathematical
knowledge." <span id="fr_31"></span>[3](#fn_31.md) This representative of
the mysticism of Eckhart provided Giordano Bruno with the fundamental
principles of his sublime and poetical conceptions. Bruno "renewed the
theory of numbers, and gave a detailed explanation of the decadal
system. With him, God is the great unity which is developed in the

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

world and in humanity, as unity is developed in the indefinite series of
numbers." <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32.md)

The death of Giordano Bruno in the year 1600 brings us to a period of
palmary importance and interest in the history of religion, science, and
philosophy. The revival of learning had for some two centuries been
illuminating and enlarging the intellectual horizon of Europe; the
Reformation was slowly removing in several countries those checks which
had hindered freedom of inquiry on most speculative subjects; that which
had been practised in the privacy of the study might be displayed almost
on the house top, that which had been whispered at the Sabbath of the
Sorcerers could be canvassed with impunity in the market place. The
spirit of the age which had dethroned the crucifix, burnt candles before
the busts of Plato and Plotinus. The revolution in theology was followed
by a general revolt against the old philosophical authorities, the seeds
of which revolt must be looked for at the time when Aristotle and the
Peripatetic successors were enthroned upon the ashes of the scholiasts,
who pretending to follow Aristotle, had. perverted and disfigured his
doctrines. As the birthplace of the Reformation, Germany enjoyed a
greater share of intellectual unrestraint than any other country of
Europe, and it was a chaos of conflicting opinions on all debateable
topics. The old lines were loosened, the old tests failing, the chain of
tradition was breaking at every point, a spirit of restless feverish
inquiry was abroad, and daily new facts were exploding old methods.
Copernicus had revolutionised astronomy by his discovery of the true
solar system, Galileo already had invented the thermometer, and was on
the threshold of a glorious future; a century

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

previously Columbus had opened the still illimitable vistas of the
western world; great minds were appearing in every country; amidst a
thousand blunders, the independent study of the Bible was pursued with
delight and enthusiasm, and in every city the hearts of an emancipated
people were glowing with hope and expectation at the promise of the
future.

Now, in an age of progress, of doubt, and of great intellectual
activity, it is singular to remark the almost invariable prevalence of
mysticism in one or other of its manifold phases, and the close of the
sixteenth century beheld spreading over the whole of Germany and passing
thence into Denmark, France, England, and Italy, a mighty school of
mysticism in the great multitude of magicians, alchemists, &c., who
directly or indirectly were followers of the renowned Paracelsus.

The sublime drunkard of Hohenheim, the contemporary of Agrippa, but
grander in his aspirations, vaster in his capacities, and, if possible,
still more unfortunate than the brilliant pupil of Trithemius, was the
intellectual product of the great school of Kabbalism represented by
Reuchlin and Picus de Mirandola. He united to his theoretical knowledge
of theosophical mysteries an unrivalled practical acquaintance with
every form of magic, and was as much an innovator in occult science as a
reformer in medicine. For all orthodox alchemists, magicians, and
professors of hidden knowledge, Paracelsus is a grand hierophant second
only to the traditional Hermes. His brief and turbulent career closed
tragically in the year 1541, but the works which he left secured him a
vast posthumous audience, and the audacity of his speculations were
undoubtedly instrumental in the emancipation of the German mind from the
influence of traditional authority.

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

At the close of the sixteenth century, then, we find the disciples of
Parcelsus seeking, after the principles of their master and by the light
of experimental research; 1. The secret of the transmutation of metals,
or of the *magnum opus*, and applying to chemistry the usages of
Kabbalism and ancient astrology. <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) 2.
The universal medicine, which included the Catholicon, or Elixir of Life
and the Panacea, the first insuring to its possessor the prolongation or
perpetuity of existence, the second restoring strength and health to
debilitated or diseased organisms. 3. The Philosophic Stone, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md) the great and universal synthesis which
conferred upon the adept a sublimer knowledge than that of transmutation
or of the Great Elixir, but on which both of these were dependent. <span
id="fr_35"></span>[3](#fn_35.md) "This stone," says a modern writer, who
fairly interprets the more exalted and spiritual side of Hermetic
traditions, "is the foundation of absolute philosophy; it is the supreme
and immoveable reason. . . . To find the Philosophic Stone is to have
discovered the Absolute," <span id="fr_36"></span>[4](#fn_36.md)

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

that is, the true *raison d’être* of all existences. Thus the initiate
aspired to that infallible knowledge and wisdom which is afforded by
divine illumination, his search for which is sometimes spoken of as the
search for the quadrature of the circle, that is, for the extent or area
of all sciences human and divine.

Among the concourse of inquirers, and the clamour of supposed and
pretended discoverers, there rose gradually into deserved prominence an
advanced school of illuminati, who, employing the terminology of the
*turba philosophorum*, under the pretence of alchemical pursuits appear
to have concealed a more exalted aim. The chief representative of this
sect at the end of the sixteenth century was Henry Khunrath, and the
work in which its principles are most adequately expressed is the
"Amphitheatrum Sapientiæ Æternæ." The student is directed by these
writers from the pursuit of material gold to the discovery of
incorruptible and purely spiritual treasures, and they pretend to
provide a mystical key or *Introitus apertus* to the "closed Palace of
the King," in which these treasures are contained. Physical
transmutation, the one and supreme end of the practical alchemist, sinks
into complete insignificance; nevertheless, it is performed by the adept
and is a landmark in his sublime progress. Rejecting the material theory
even for this inferior process, they declare its attainment impossible
for the unspiritual man, and just as the alchemical nomenclature is made
use of in a transfigured sense, so the terminology of metaphysics
appears to be pressed into the service of a conception far transcending
the notions commonly conveyed by the words wisdom, spirituality, &c.

The result of this singular division in the camp of the alchemists was
the inevitable mental confusion of that great

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

crowd of inquirers into the secrets of nature who formed the audience of
professional adepts. Every year books and pamphlets were issued from the
German press, and purported to contain the secret of the *Magnum Opus*,
expressed for the first time in plain, unmistakeable terms, but no
writer proved more intelligible than his predecessors; the student,
surrounded by authors whose search had been crowned with complete and
unexampled success, could himself make no progress, new methods, though
warranted infallible, were as barren as the old in their operation, and
the universal interest in the subject was an incentive to innumerable
impostors, who reaped large profits from the publication of worthless
speculations and lying recipes. At such a juncture the isolated
investigator naturally sought the assistance which is afforded by
association; meetings of men like-minded took place for the discussion
of different questions concerning the secret sciences; doctrines and
practices were compared; men travelled far and wide to exchange opinions
with distant workers in the same fields of experimental research, and
the spirit of the time seemed ripe for the establishment of a society
for the advancement of esoteric science and the study of natural laws.
It was at this interesting period that the Rosicrucian Fraternity made
public for the first time the fact of its existence, and attracted
universal attention by its extraordinary history, and by the nature of
its claims.
