### CHAPTER V.

#### THE CHYMICAL MARRIAGE OF CHRISTIAN ROSENCREUTZ.

THE whole Rosicrucian controversy centres in this publication, which
Buhle describes as "a comic romance of extraordinary talent." It was
first published at Strasbourg in the year 1616, but, as will be seen in
the seventh chapter, it is supposed to have existed in manuscript as
early as 1601-2, thus antedating by a long period the other Rosicrucian
books. Two editions of the German original are preserved in the Library
of the British Museum, both bearing the date 1616. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51) It was translated into English for the
first time in 1690, under the title of "The Hermetic Romance: or The
Chymical Wedding. Written in High Dutch by Christian Rosencreutz.
Translated by E. Foxcroft, late Fellow of King's Colledge in Cambridge.
Licensed and entered according to Order. Printed by A. Sowie, at the
Crooked Billet in Holloway-Lane, Shoreditch; and Sold at the Three-Keys
in Nags-Head-Court, Grace-church-street." It is this translation in
substance, that is, compressed by the omission of all irrelevant matter
and dispensable prolixities, which I now offer to the reader.
