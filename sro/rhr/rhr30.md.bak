### CHAPTER XV.

#### CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ROSICRUCIANS AND FREEMASONS.

PROFESSOR BUHLE affirms as the "main thesis" of his concluding chapter
that "Freemasonry is neither more nor less than Rosicrucianism as
modified by those who transplanted it into England." His elegant and
interesting hypothesis rests on a microscopical foundation of actual
fact. A passage in Fludd's rejoinder to the "Exercitatio Epistolæ" of
Gassendi states that the [*Fratres*](errata.htm#5.md) *R. C.* are
thenceforth to be called *sapientes* or *sophos*. The German critic's
discriminating commentary on this statement is that the old name was
abolished, but as yet a new one had not been conferred, and that the
immediate hint for the name Masons was derived from the Rosicrucian
legend concerning the "House of the Holy Ghost," an allegorical building
which typified the secret purpose of the Society. Having fathered
Freemasonry on the renowned Kentish Rosicrucian, Professor Buhle enters
on a Quixotic quest through the folios of his victim in search of
corroborating passages, and discovers in the "Summum Bonum," which Fludd
disowned, as we have seen, that Jesus was the *lapis angularis* of the
human temple in which men are stones, and that the author calls upon his
students to be transformed from dead into living philosophical
stones. <span id="fr_112"></span>[1](#fn_112.md) "Transmutemini,
transmutemini,

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

de lapidibus mortuis in lapides vivos philosophicos." On this foundation
rests his whole hypothesis concerning the transfiguration of the
Rosicrucian Fraternity and its reappearance as the Masonic Brotherhood.
It is needless to say that it is slender and unsatisfactory in the
extreme.

I do not propose to discuss the origin of Freemasonry. That vexatious
question has been perpetually debated with singularly unprofitable
results. All I am concerned with proving is that there is no traceable
connection between Masonry and Rosicrucianism. The former is defined by
its initiates to be "a science of morality, veiled in allegory, and
illustrated by symbols," and again as "a system of doctrines taught, in
a manner peculiar to itself, by allegories and symbols. . . . Its
ceremonies are external additions, which affect not its substance." The
two doctrines of the unity of God and the immortality of the soul
constitute "the philosophy of Freemasonry." It has never been at any
period of its history an association for scientific researches and the
experimental investigation of Nature, which was a primary object with
the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. It has not only never laid claim to the
possession of any transcendental secrets of alchemy and magic, or to any
skill in medicine, but has never manifested any interest in these or
kindred subjects. Originally an association for the diffusion of natural
morality, it is now simply a benefit society. The improvement of mankind
and the encouragement of philanthropy were and are its ostensible
objects, and these also were the dream of the Rosicrucian, but, on the
other hand, it has never aimed at a reformation in the arts and
sciences, for it was never at any period a learned society, and a large
proportion of its members have been chosen from illiterate

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

classes. It is free alike from the enthusiasm and the errors of the
elder Order, for though at one time it appears to have excluded
Catholics from its ranks, as at this day the Catholic Church
excommunicates and denounces its members, it has been singularly devoid
of prejudices and singularly unaffected by the crazes of the time. It
has not committed itself to second Advent theories; it does not call the
Pope Antichrist; it does not expect a universal cataclysm. It preaches a
natural morality, and has so little interest in mysticism that it daily
misinterprets and practically despises its own mystical symbols.

Those who believe in the hypothesis of Professor Buhle cannot shew that
Fludd was either a Rosicrucian or a Freemason. There is some reason to
believe that the former Brotherhood did split up subsequently into
different sections, but there is no tittle of evidence to prove that
they developed into Freemasons. Mackey says that they protracted their
existence till the middle of the eighteenth century, and then ceased to
meet on account of the death of one of their chiefs named Burn, but he
does not state his authority. He also tells us that out of the
Rosicrucian Fraternity there was established in 1777 that association
called "The Brothers of the Golden Cross," whose alchemical processes
are described by Sigmund Richter. "This Society was very numerous in
Germany, and even extended into other countries, especially into Sweden.
A second schism from the Rosicrucians was the society of 'The Initiated
Brothers of Asia,' which was organised in 1780, and whose pursuits, like
those of the parent institution, were connected with alchemy and the
natural sciences. In 1785, it attracted the attention of the police,
and, two years later, received a fatal blow, in the revelation of all
its

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

secrets by one, Rolling, a treacherous member of the association."

These statements must be taken at their value, but even doubtful facts
are of equal weight with hypotheses founded on assumptions of the most
gratuitous kind, and supported by tortured quotations. It is, however,
on the universal concensus of competent Masonic opinion that I should
found the rejection of the Buhlean view. Mackey, in the "Synoptical
Index" to his "Symbolism of Freemasonry," says that the Rosicrucian
Society resembled the Masonic in its organization and in some of the
subjects of its investigation, "but it was in no other way connected
with Free Masonry." In the "Lexicon" he again tells us that "the
Rosicrucians had no connection whatever with the Masonic fraternity,"
and that it is only malignant revilers, like Baruel in his "Memoirs of
Jacobinism," who attempt to identify the two institutions. Other
authorities are not less pronounced in their opinions.

It is to the institution of the Rose-Cross degree in Freemasonry that
the confusion of opinion on this point is to be mainly traced. When
ill-informed persons happen to hear that there are "Sovereign Princes of
Rose-Croix," "Princes of Rose-Croix de Heroden," &c., among the Masonic
Brethren, they naturally identify these splendid inanities of occult
nomenclature with the mysterious and awe-inspiring Rosicrucians. The
origin of the Rose-Cross degree is involved in the most profound
mystery. Its foundation has been attributed to Johann Valentin Andreas,
but this is an ignorant confusion, arising from the alleged connection
of the theologian of Wirtemberg with the society of Christian
Rosencreutz. There is no trace of its existence before the middle of the
eighteenth century, though the

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Dictionnaire
Maçonnique" <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) declares that it was
created in Palestine by Godfrey de Bouillon in the year 1100, and that
the Rose was emblematic of secrecy and the Cross of immortality. It
professes to deal with the spiritual side of alchemy, and to seek that
same mysterious Stone which was the object of Basil Valentin,
Paracelsus, Khunrath, and the true *turba philosophorum* of
psycho-chemical transmutations. But the shallow pretence has deceived no
one, for the sublime tradition of the veritable *magnum opus*
exclusively points to transcendent spiritual secrets, and not to the
eternal commonplace of moral and masonic platitudinarians--that is to
say, the illiterate initiations of Masonry, ignorantly adopting a
garbled alchemical terminology, have fallen into the gross and porcine
error of interpreting alchemical symbolism morally instead of
pneumatically. Sovereign chapters and sovereign princes of Rose-Croix,
Knight Princes of the Eagle and the Pelican, and Prince Perfect Masters,
should continue to dine sumptuously; no one will dispute their
proficiency as initiates of the gastronomical mystery, but, in the name
of the Grand Architect, let them leave the morally unsearchable mystery
of the philosophick gold to the true Sons of the Doctrine.

The Rose-Cross degree is represented by Carlile as the *ne plus ultra*
of Masonry. It has three points, of which the two first are called
Sovereign Chapters, and the third the Mystic Supper, which is held four
times a year. The presiding officer is dignified with the sublime title
of "Ever Most Perfect Sovereign;" the two Wardens are "Most Excellent
and Perfect Brothers." There is also a Master of

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

the Ceremonies, and the brethren are "Most Respectful Knights." The
annual festival of the order is celebrated on Shrove Tuesday. The jewel
is "a golden compass, extended on an arc to the sixteenth part of a
circle, or twenty-two and a-half degrees," according to Mackey. Carlile
describes it as a triangle formed by a compass and a quarter of a
circle. "Between the legs of the compass is a cross resting on the arc
of the circle; its centre is occupied by a full-blown rose, whose stem
twines around the lower limb of the cross; at the foot of this cross, on
the same side on which the rose is exhibited, is the figure of a pelican
wounding its breast to feed its young, which are in a nest surrounding
it; while on the other side of the jewel is the figure of an eagle, with
wings displayed. On the arc of the circle the P.·. W.·. of the degree is
engraved in the cipher of the Order." <span
id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md) A triple crown surmounts the head of the
Order. This symbolism is undoubtedly borrowed from the Rosicrucians,
which is the whole extent of the connection supposed to subsist between
the two Orders. The Rose-Cross degree in Freemasonry is admitted to be
"a modern invention." The ritual of the receptions in the three points
of this degree will be found in Carlile's "Ritual of Freemasonry," and
in the first volume of Heckethorn's "Secret Societies of all Ages and
Countries."
