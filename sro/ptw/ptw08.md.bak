### Chapter Six.

#### PSEUDO-ROSICRUCIANS—IMPOSTORS AND FOOLS.

The fool's paradise is the world of self-created illusions, without the
recognition of the underlying eternal truth.

THE Devil is God inverted. Falsehood is truth perverted. The spirit
produces the form to be its true image; but, for all that the form does
not always represent the true qualities of the spirit. Thus the sun
shines upon the earth, and his rays produce wholesome and poisonous
growths, and the spirit of Christ for ever remains in His glory, even if
a thousand of so-called "Christian" sects misrepresent Him, so that His
image can no more be recognised in them. Likewise the true Brothers of
the Golden and Rosy Cross still exist, even if the name of their order
has been misused by impostors and fools.

The age at which the idea of Rosicrucian societies became popular was a
time when orders of all kinds were flourishing. Monasteries, convents,
and religious orders were the plagues of the country; in some places the
Catholic clergy, in others the Protestant clergy, were, so to say,
omnipotent. The work of the great Reformation had only begun its work,
and free thought and free speech were little known. The Protestant
clergy were not less intolerant than the Catholics who preceded them;
and in some places the latter were still in possession of all the
authority they possessed at the time of the Inquisition. In consequence
of the power of the Church over the citizens of the country—a power
which the former abused very freely—it became necessary to have secret
societies and places where the members could secretly meet and exchange
[their](errata.htm#12.md) opinions without being overheard by spies and
traitors. Secret orders of all kinds were, therefore,

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

existing in great numbers, and foremost of all were the *Freemasons*, an
order which, on account of the strength of its principles, has continued
to exist. At that time Masonry was not what it is now. A writer of those
times, in a work published in 1666, informs us that it was neither a
political nor a Christian institution, but a truly secret organization,
which admitted such men as members who were anxious to obtain the
priceless boon of liberty of conscience, and to avoid clerical
prosecution.

But the air of mystery which hung about the masonic lodges was also very
attractive to all who were mystically inclined. Then, as now, strange
rumours circulated about the doings of the Masons, wild stories were
whispered about among the ignorant, which the clergy of those times,
like their brothers of the present day, helped to start, circulate, and
exaggerate. They were accused of practising black magic and sorcery, and
some even accused them of being in league with devils.

All these things served to attract to the masonic lodges not merely
those who were desirous of freedom of speech, but also those who desired
to learn forbidden secrets; and, moreover, adventurers of all kinds
sought to gain admittance and sometimes succeeded. Many of the masonic
brothers attempted to study and practise alchemy; and there are some
accounts proving that sometimes successful alchemical experiments were
made in the lodges. But, generally speaking, then, as now, those who
joined a lodge for the purpose of having some very important secrets
revealed to them, were sadly disappointed, for besides the external
ceremonies and forms, which they were sworn not to reveal, and which
were of no further importance, they were informed of nothing which would
have been worth revealing. They went from one degree to another, paying
large sums for being admitted into higher degrees, and still no
revelations were made, and all they learned on such occasions was some
other form of ceremony, a knowledge of which was hardly worth the price
they paid for it.

It is, therefore, not surprising that when the Rosicrucian mania broke
out, and when the more exaggerated accounts about the great powers of
that order were fully believed, that the Masons opened their ranks to
anyone who was supposed to be a Rosicrucian, and that if the latter
succeeded in making the brothers believe that he was actually such a
favoured person, he would at once gain a great deal of influence in the
lodge. These circumstances opened the doors of the masonic lodges to a
great many strolling adventurers, vagabonds, charlatans, and
mountebanks; and especially the Catholic as well as the Protestant
"Jesuits" were not slow to see their advantage, and to gain admission to
the lodges under the disguise of Rosicrucians.

They pretended to be in communication with [certain](errata.htm#13.md)
unknown superiors, some grand patriarch of Jerusalem, or some invisible
somebody, whose orders had to be obeyed without asking any questions,
but whose names must not be revealed; and to make such supposed orders
more effective, they produced letters and documents apparently

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

coming from such superiors, but which they had written and sealed
themselves. On some occasions they performed sleight-of-hand tricks,
produced sham apparitions of ghosts and deceased persons, for the
purpose of deluding the members of the lodge, and to make them believe
in their supernatural powers. Thus they made Freemasonry their tool and
used the power which they gained for the advancement of their own
interests.

Volumes might be filled with amusing accounts of the doings of the
pseudo-Rosicrucians; but we have only room for a few examples, and
shall, for that purpose, select those whose influence in history was of
considerable importance.

One of the adventurers, of whom it is still doubtful whether or not he
possessed any occult powers, was the reputed *Schroepfer*, a bankrupt
inn-keeper of Leipzig. His only object seemed to be to make as much
money as he could, and to spend it as fast he made it. He assumed the
name "von Steinbach," and pretended to be a French Colonel, and to have
been appointed by the Duke of Orleans as secret ambassador, sent to
reform masonry, and to establish a connection with the Jesuits, who were
at that time driven away. These Jesuits, he said, were in possession of
an enormous amount of treasure, which they had entrusted to his care;
but his intention was to use that money for the benefit of the country,
and whoever wanted to obtain a share of it would have to come to
confession and to better his life.

It is almost incredible that any sane person should have believed such
nonsense; nevertheless, when a prospect of obtaining money is held out,
most people are ready to believe almost anything. Moreover, Schroepfer
had a wonderful power of gaining the confidence of those who came near
him, and he had some knowledge of chemistry, which gave him a scientific
air, and so it happened that even some people of high social position
believed in his assertions.

To gain full power over his dupes, he deposited in a bank at Frankfurt a
sealed package, to be returned to him whenever he desired it; this
package was said to contain several millions in bank-notes, but which,
as might have been supposed, contained nothing but brown paper. On the
strength of that supposed deposit, which "could not then be touched," he
borrowed large sums of money. He even gained the confidence of the Duke
of *Cairland*, in whose presence he caused the apparition of the
*Chevalier de Saxe* to appear in the palace. This scene is described by
an eye-witness as follows:—"The large room wherein the ghost was to
appear had the form of a theatre, and had formerly been used for the
purpose of giving private plays and operas. The spectators were sitting
in a half-circle, and they received strict orders not to leave their
seats under any circumstances, nor to touch nor examine any of the
apparatus for the conjuring process, else the most dread consequences
would follow. They had, furthermore, to swear that they would not reveal
afterwards what they had seen.

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The Duke and his
Minister, von Wurmb, and other dignitaries were present. Schroepfer
appeared, nodded to the assembly, and walked in a haughty manner up to
the platform. The Duke had desired to see the apparition of the
Chevalier de Saxe, and Schroepfer consented. Suddenly all the candles in
the room went out at once, and every one present felt a feeling of
horror creeping over him. At the same time a stupefying smoke of some
incense which Schroepfer was burning filled the room. Gradually the
platform grew more light, while the place for the spectators remained in
darkness. A kind of bluish light shone upon the faces of the latter,
which gave to every one of them a ghostly appearance. Gradually a cloud
became visible in the background of the stage. At first it was only like
a thin mist, but slowly it grew more solid. Gradually it assumed the
outlines of a human form. The details of the figure became clearer, the
face could be seen and recognised; there was the living image of the
Chevalier de Saxe.

"The Duke, seeing his dead relative standing before him, broke out in an
exclamation of horror. The apparition lifted its arm. Every one was
terrified; none dared to speak. There were deep sighs.

''Then the ghost began to speak in a hollow voice, complaining that he
had been disturbed in his sleep in the grave.

"The Duke appeared to be near fainting; but being a courageous man, he
rose with an effort, and it seemed for a moment that his reason was to
be victorious over superstition.

Laying his hand on his sword, he exclaimed, 'Illusion of hell! Go back
to the place from whence you came!'

"At that moment the sword dropped from his hand, as if he had been
suddenly paralyzed. The apparition was gone and the room was dark.
Suddenly, as quickly as they had been extinguished, the candles began to
burn again, and we all saw the conjuror in his long habit of black
velvet, looking still paler than usual, the sweat standing upon his
forehead, resembling a man who has just escaped some great danger.
Having recovered, he turned to the Duke and reproached him.

"'Your Excellency,' said Schroepfer, 'may congratulate yourself that we
have not all been killed. Only the most powerful conjurations on my part
could prevent the apparition from murdering us. It was the most terrible
hour of my life.'

"The Duke excused himself, and finally begged pardon, promising to be
more obedient at some future occasion."

"There were a great many people of whom Schroepfer had borrowed money,
sometimes even large sums, and they all grew impatient, and wanted to be
paid. Schroepfer was forced to produce the package from the bank, and it
was found to be worthless. But even that was not sufficient to destroy
the confidence of his dupes. They persuaded themselves that he was a
high Rosicrucian Adept, who was only testing their faith. "Can we, in
our ignorance," they said, "head the Master's heart and know his
intentions? Perhaps he is going to take away our

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

earthly Mammon, and give us for it the imperishable philosopher's
stone."

"At last, however, the measure was full; the creditors refused to be fed
any longer on idle promises; they wanted their money. So they selected a
deputation from their midst, and sent them to Leipzig, where Schroepfer
had gone to escape their importunity. When they entered his room he bade
them welcome in à kind manner and full of assurance.

"I have already been informed of your coming," he said, "and have been
waiting for you."

"Then," they answered, "you will also know that we have come for the
purpose of obtaining a settlement of our financial affairs."

"What!" exclaimed Schroepfer, appearing to be astonished, "do you doubt
me?'

"Not I," answered the one addressed; "but some of my friends do."

"And you, sir?" asked Schroepfer, turning to another one and fixing his
eyes upon him.

The person addressed trembled, and began to stammer an excuse; but
Schroepfer, whose face assumed a triumphant smile, continued:—

"Oh, you of little faith! ye are worse than the doubting Thomas, more
obstinate than Peter, who thrice denied his Master. I have opened before
you the portals of the spirit world and made you see its inhabitants,
and you still doubt my power. I wanted to lead you into the innermost
sanctuary, and to make you richer than all the kings of this earth; but
you have not stood the test imposed upon you. Shame upon you! Without
faith and confidence no miracle can be performed. Doubt is the great sin
of the world."

"Mercy, great master!" exclaimed one; "do not punish the innocent with
the guilty. I did not doubt."

"I know it," answered Schroepfer; "and for the sake of one just man, I
will forgive the sins of all. The mammon after which your sinful heart
hankers, you shall receive; what I promised will be done; but it would
have been better for you if you had chosen the hidden wisdom instead of
possessions which perish."

They then begged his pardon, and at last he became less stern and
forgave them their doubts. He promised not only to unveil to them all
the secrets of the true Rosicrucians, but he also appointed a certain
day for the payment of his debt.

The revelations about the secrets never came; but the day appointed for
the payment of the debt arrived. In the evening preceding that eventful
day, Schroepfer invited all his creditors to his house. The supper which
was served was excellent; the wine of the first quality. Schroepfer was
in high spirits, more talkative than usual, and amused his guests by
some clever sleight-of-hand tricks, attributing it, of course, all to
the spirits. Midnight passed, and the guests prepared themselves to
depart for their residences, but the host objected.

"I shall not let you go," he said, "you may all sleep here, and in the

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

morning, even before sunrise, I will show you something entirely new.
Heretofore I have shown you dead people whom I have called back into
life; but this morning I will show you a living man whom you will
believe to be dead." He then took up his glass filled with wine, and
caused it to jingle by bringing it in contact with the glasses held by
the others, with each one successively. As he approached the last one,
his glass broke into pieces.

"What does this mean?" asked one.

"The fate of mankind," answered Schroepfer. "The wine of life has
escaped, the vessel broke to pieces; I am fatigued enough to die."

He feel asleep, and the guests followed his example, sleeping in
armchairs and on lounges as well as they could manage it. Early in the
morning Schroepfer called to them to awake; telling them that it was
time to go. They all went together out of the town to an almost solitary
place called the "Rosenthal." Schroepfer was silent, and appeared to be
very serious. Having arrived at the place of destination, he ordered his
companions to remain where he posted them.

"Do not move," he said, "until I call you to help me to raise the buried
treasure. I am now going into that grove, where you will soon see a
wonderful apparition."

With a satirical smile on his pale face he turned away and disappeared
in the bushes. Soon a sound as of a pistol-shot sounded from there. They
thought that it was perhaps fired by some hunter, and paid no further
attention to it. They waited. One quarter of an hour after another
passed away, and nothing happened. They did not dare to leave their
places, fearing to rouse the anger of the magician by their
disobedience. The mist of the morning had turned into a fine rain, which
made their position very uncomfortable. They grew impatient, and
consulted with each other what was to be done. While they were
discussing the subject, some proposing to follow
[Schroepfer](errata.htm#14.md) into the bushes, and others objecting,
saying that by doing so they might interrupt his incantations, or at
least give him a welcome excuse for not obtaining the treasure, a
stranger approached. His appearance was so sudden that it almost
appeared miraculous.

"I know," said the stranger, "for whom you are waiting. Schroepfer will
not come; he is dead."

"You lie!" exclaimed one of the company, being very indignant about this
intrusion.

Instead of answering, the stranger gave a certain secret sign which
proved him to be one of the superiors of a high masonic order. All
present bowed respectfully.

"Follow me," he said, "and you will see that I told you the truth."

They followed him into the ticket, and there they found the magician
dead upon the sod. He held a pistol in his hand; the ball had penetrated
his heart.

Thus perished a man who, although he was an impostor, may nevertheless
have been in possession of some occult knowledge, but who

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

had not strength enough to resist the temptations of the senses, and who
misused his powers for the gratification of his personal self.

*Johann Christoph Woellner* was the son of a Protestant clergyman, who
resided near Spandau, and became preacher of the Evangelical community
at Grossbehnitz, near Berlin. While in this position he succeeded in
seducing the daughter of his patron, the General Itzenplitz, and the
family at last consented to a marriage which they could not prevent. The
affair was still more scandalous on account of the publicly known fact
that Woellner made love to the mother of the girl before he married the
latter. By this marriage he acquired a considerable fortune. He was very
much inclined to mysticism, and soon became one of the most active and
prominent members of the Rosicrucians. His name in the lodge was
*Chrysophron*, and by the influence of his friends he obtained an
influential position, which he used for the advancement of his own
selfish interests, and finally he obtained a position at the Prussian
Court.

He appeared externally very modest and meek; while at the same time his
conceit and ambition were without limits, and no means were too vile to
him, if by them he could accomplish his purpose. His low forehead
indicated a person of very little intelligence, but a great deal of
cunning. His little eyes were continually looking downwards; his manners
were those of a pious coxcomb. Sympathetic souls find each other, and he
therefore became very intimate with *Bischofswerder*, another
pseudo-Rosicrucian, who was Minister of State and favourite of King
Frederic William II. of Prussia, and he in company with his friend
worked together for the destruction of the religious liberty of the
people, as shall be described further on.

Another of the same class was the pastor *Johann August Stark*, an
Evangelical preacher, but secretly a Catholic, and in league with the
Jesuits. He was an extraordinary hypocrite. Still worse, but more
ridiculous, was his disciple, the pseudo-Rosicrucian *Mayr*, a very
eccentric character and a great fanatic. He was limping, bald-headed,
squinted, and of most unprepossessing appearance. A broad trunk, with an
immense hydrocephalic head rested upon thin, weak legs. He usually wore
black pantaloons and vest, and an orange-coloured coat. While preaching,
he shot with a pistol from the pulpit at a man who slept during the
sermon, and wounded him, exclaiming, "I will wake you up!" He had all
kinds of religions. In the morning he went to the Catholic mass, next he
preached in the Protestant church, then spent his afternoons in the
Jewish synagogue or with the Mennonites, and in the evening he went to
the masonic lodge.

These were some of the types of the "Rosicrucians" which infested the
masonic lodges of those times, and it is a marvel that they did not
destroy masonry. Some of them were impostors, others were dupes, and not
a few imposed upon their dupes, while at the same time they were the
dupes of others. This confusion of incompatible elements, such as
freethinkers, pietists, reasonable men, and superstitious

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

fools, could not fail to bring on a separation within the lodges, and
they naturally became divided into two parts, of which one represented
progression and tolerance, the other one bigotry and superstition. Among
the latter class was the "Society of the Cross," who at their initiation
had to take the following oath: "In the name of the crucified I swear to
break all ties which bind me to my father, mother, brothers, sisters,
wife, relatives, friends, sweethearts, king, benefactors, or to any
other human being, whom I may have' sworn to obey, so that I may belong
entirely to Christ."

The Crown Prince, afterwards King Frederic William II. of Prussia, was
himself a member of a masonic lodge and a great admirer of Woellner and
Bischofswerder, who exerted their nefarious influence over him, and
whenever the unfortunate prince appeared to become subject to doubts
regarding the supernatural powers of his friends, they quieted him again
by causing the spectre of some dead friend to appear before him, which
was not at all difficult to do, as they were in possession of all the
paraphernalia necessary to perform sleight-of-hand tricks, such as magic
lanterns, electric batteries, etc.; and there was no danger of being
detected in these tricks, as the spectators had to remain within a
certain "magic" circle, which they were not permitted to leave; and it
was always said that a disobedience to the orders of the magician would
be followed by the direst consequences, or perhaps be fatal to all.

The greatest enemies of the so-called "*Rosicrucians*" were the
*Illuminati*, a secret organization, radiating throughout the whole of
Germany. At their head stood the councillor *Weishaupt*, formerly
professor at the University of Ingolstadt, in Bavaria. He had been
educated in his youth in a Jesuit convent, but afterwards became a
bitter enemy of that order. He wanted to liberate the people from the
bonds of bigotry by spreading his cosmopolitan ideas, and he founded the
order of the *Illuminati*, using the already existing masonic symbols
and formulæ. He proclaimed that the object of his order was not to
interfere with the Church or State, but that it intended to work for the
moral improvement of humanity, to do good, to prevent evil, and to
spread useful knowledge to all parts of the world. The necessary
requirements to become a member of his order are described by him as
follows:—

"He who is not deaf to the voice of suffering, whose heart is open to
charity, and who is the brother and friend of the unfortunate, is our
brother. He should love all creatures, and not cause pain even to a
worm. He ought to be constant in adversity, indefatigable in doing good,
courageous in overcoming difficulties. He should not look with contempt
upon the weak; he should be above all selfish and personal
considerations, and be anxious to benefit mankind. He should avoid
idleness, and not consider any kind of knowledge to be below his dignity
to investigate. But the main object of his life should be the attainment
of self-knowledge. He who cares for virtue and truth for its own sake
will not care for the applause of the vulgar. He who

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

dares to do that which his own heart commands him to do is fit to become
a member of our order."

His order, like all secret orders, possessed the charm which always
surrounds that which is mysterious. It had three degrees; the first one
consisted of the *novices* and the *minervales*. After passing an
examination, the candidate was accepted into a higher degree, consisting
of the *lesser* and the *higher* degree of *Illuminati*, and finally
followed the highest degree, the *Priests*. According to Weishaupt's
ideas, the main object of true religion was to lift man up to a higher
conception of his true nature and destiny, and thereby bring him up to a
realization of this higher state of human dignity. This could not be
accomplished by force, but merely by the spreading of knowledge,
displacing error and superstition. He thought that if men could once
realize the necessity of virtue and be all united by brotherly love,
immorality, vice, degradation, and poverty would cease to exist, and men
would become their own rulers and guides.

He furthermore attempted to prove that true (esoteric) Christianity was
not a popular religion, or a religion for the vulgar, but that it was a
system of philosophy, given in symbols, comprehensible only to those who
were far enough advanced to be instructed in it, and it was the duty of
the Illuminati to study the esoteric side of the religious systems, and
to try to comprehend their meaning.

The highest rank in the highest degree was that of *Regent*. The Regents
were the superiors of the order, and only the most useful and virtuous
members were admitted to that rank, after having passed through long and
severe probations. <span id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md)

Soon the *Illuminati* became objects of fear and suspicion for the
Governments, especially in Bavaria. A Protestant clergyman, *Lange*, was
accidentally killed by a stroke of lightning. When his body was examined
by the authorities, they found some papers regarding the order, and a
list of some of its prominent members. This was the signal for a
universal inquisition and persecution. Many of the noblest and most
eminent persons were imprisoned or banished, others fled, and a price
was set upon Weishapt's head, who, however, escaped to *Gotha*, where he
found an asylum. <span id="fr_12"></span>[†](#fn_12.md)

Still the order of the *Illuminati* continued to exist, and between them
and the *Rosicrucians* there existed the same animosity as now between
the *Liberals* and the *Ultramontanes*, or between Progressionists and
Conservatives. Each party denounced the other one, and each party had
some just cause; for the Rosicrucians attempted to push the people still
lower into darkness and superstition, while the Illuminati

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

gave them a light which the people did not understand, and by
undermining the authority of the priesthood, which governed the people
by fear, they also undermined the authority of the law, by which the
people must be ruled, as long as they cannot rule themselves.

King Frederic the Great cared nothing about these religious quarrels. In
his dominions everyone was at liberty to follow the religion which
suited him best; and all the efforts of the Rosicrucians were therefore
directed to maintain their power over the Crown Prince, and in this they
succeeded. The Crown Prince was a good-hearted but weak-minded man,
whose strength had been to a certain extent exhausted by too much
sensual enjoyment. Fie often had spells of great moral depression and
brooded over his regrets for the past. He needed some comfort and
consolation, and this he attempted to find sometimes in the arms of the
Countess of Lichtenau; at other times in those of the pietists and
"Rosicrucians," *Bischofswerder* and *Woellner*.

These "Rosicrucians" used all the means they could to obtain power. They
calumniated Frederic the Great, and saw in him their greatest enemy,
because his liberal measures hindered them from forcing their
narrow-minded ideas and bigotry upon the people. They frightened the
credulous Crown Prince by painting and exaggerating to him the dire
consequences of the spreading of "irreligious" doctrines. They proposed
to restore the Inquisition in a Protestant shape.

Frederic the Great died; *Frederic William II.* became King; but he was
ruled by Bischofswerder and Woellner, and by his mistresses. One of the
first successful attempts of the former was to restore to a great extent
the power of *Rome* in Protestant Germany. Woellner became Minister of
the religious department, and soon followed the issue of the infamous
"*religious edict*" of July 9, 1788. In this edict everybody was warned
by order of the King to subordinate his own reason to the dogmas of the
Church; and those who should contravene this order were
[threatened](errata.htm#15.md) with the loss of the offices they held and
with imprisonment. They generously permitted everybody to believe what
he pleased, but they strongly prohibited any expression of opinion in
regard to religious matters, if such opinions were not sanctioned by the
Church. But those who should dare to ridicule a clergyman were
threatened with the heaviest punishment. At the same time *censure* was
established, so that nothing could be printed and published without
having first been submitted to the clerical authorities for approval.

The excitement caused by this shameful edict was terrible. The
Illuminati led by the bookseller *Nicolay*, at Berlin, protested against
it; but their writings were confiscated. Woellner surrounded himself
with "Rosicrucians" and [pietists](errata.htm#16.md) and a "spiritual
examination board" was instituted, which examined every candidate for an
office in regard to his creed before he could be appointed. They
examined all clergymen and school teachers and ejected everyone who was
not a hypocrite and who dared to say what he thought. They published a
miserable catechism written in bad Latin, in which was prescribed what a

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

person would have to believe before he could pass the examination.
Pietistic schools and hymn-books were introduced and everything possible
was attempted to make the people more stupid than they already were.

The disgrace which was brought upon the name "Rosicrucians" by these
*pseudo-Rosicrucians* was so great that even to this day everything
connected with Rosicrucianism is believed by the public in Germany to be
identical with bigotry, pietism, hypocrisy, knavery, animalism, and
absurdity.
