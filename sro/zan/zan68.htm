<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zukunft hast du mir gegeben,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doch du nehmst den Augenblick.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kassandra."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Futurity hast thou given to me,&#8212;yet takest from me the Moment.)</p>  
<p>"Mejnour, behold thy work! Out, out upon our little vanities of wisdom!&#8212;out upon our ages of lore and life! To save her from Peril I left her presence, and the Peril has seized her in its grasp!"</p>  
<p>"Chide not thy wisdom but thy passions! Abandon thine idle hope of the love of woman. See, for those who would unite the lofty with the lowly, the inevitable curse; thy very nature uncomprehended,&#8212;thy sacrifices unguessed. The lowly one views but in the lofty a necromancer or a fiend. Titan, canst thou weep?"</p>  
<p>"I know it now, I see it all! It WAS her spirit that stood beside our own, and escaped my airy clasp! O strong desire of motherhood and nature! unveiling all our secrets, piercing space and traversing worlds!&#8212;Mejnour, what awful learning lies hid in the ignorance of the heart that loves!"</p>  
<p>"The heart," answered the mystic, coldly; "ay, for five thousand years I have ransacked the mysteries of creation, but I have not yet discovered all the wonders in the heart of the simplest boor!"</p>  
<p>"Yet our solemn rites deceived us not; the prophet-shadows, dark with terror and red with blood, still foretold that, even in the dungeon, and before the deathsman, I,&#8212;I had the power to save them both!"</p>  
<p>"But at some unconjectured and most fatal sacrifice to thyself."</p>  
<p>"To myself! Icy sage, there is no self in love! I go. Nay, alone: I want thee not. I want now no other guide but the human instincts of affection. No cave so dark, no solitude so vast, as to conceal her. Though mine art fail me; though the stars heed me not; though space, with its shining myriads, is again to me but the azure void,&#8212;I return but to love and youth and hope! When have they ever failed to triumph and to save!"</p>
