<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1310.</span>IN France, on the other hand, the proceedings against
the order had assumed a most sanguinary character. Many Templars, both
in the capital and the provinces, had made confessions of guilt whilst
suffering upon the rack, but they had no sooner been released from the
hands of their tormentors, and had recovered their health, than they
disavowed their confessions,

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1310.</span>maintained the innocence of their order, and appealed
to all their gallant actions, in ancient and modern times, in refutation
of the calumnies of their enemies. The enraged Philip caused these
Templars to be brought before an ecclesiastical tribunal convoked at
Paris, and sentence of death was passed upon them by the archbishop of
Sens, in the following terms:--

"You have avowed," said be, "that the brethren who are received into the
order of the Temple are compelled to renounce Christ and spit upon the
cross, and that you yourselves have participated in that crime: you have
thus acknowledged that you have fallen into the sin of *heresy*. By your
confession and repentance you had merited absolution, and had once more
become reconciled to the church. As you have revoked your confession,
the church no longer regards you as reconciled, but as having fallen
back to your first errors. You are, therefore, *relapsed heretics (!)*
and as such, we condemn you to the fire." <span
id="fr_379"></span>[\*](#fn_379.md)

The following morning, (Tuesday, May 12,) in pursuance of this absurd
and atrocious sentence, fifty-four Templars were handed over to the
secular arm, and were led out to execution by the king's officers. They
were conducted into the open country, in the environs of the Porte St.
Antoine des Champs at Paris, and were burnt to death in a most cruel
manner before a slow fire. All historians speak with admiration of the
heroism and intrepidity with which they met their fate. <span
id="fr_380"></span>[†](#fn_380.md)

Many hundred other Templars were dragged from the dungeons of Paris
before the archbishop of Sens and his council. Those whom neither the
agony of the torture nor the fear of

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1310.</span>death could overcome, but who remained stedfast amid
all their trials in the maintenance of the innocence of their order,
were condemned to perpetual imprisonment as *unreconciled heretics;*
whilst those who, having made the required confessions of guilt,
continued to persevere in them, received absolution, were declared
reconciled to the church, and were set at liberty. Notwithstanding the
terror inspired by these executions, many of the Templars still
persisted in the revocation of their confessions, which they stigmatized
as the result of insufferable torture, and boldly maintained the
innocence of their order.

On the 18th of August, four other Templars were condemned as relapsed
heretics by the council of Sens, and were likewise burned by the Porte
St. Antoine; and it is stated that a hundred and thirteen Templars were
from first to last burnt at the stake in Paris. Many others were burned
in Lorraine; in Normandy; at Carcassone, and nine, or, according to some
writers, twenty-nine, were burnt by the archbishop of Rheims at Senlis!
King Philip's officers, indeed, not content with their inhuman cruelty
towards the living, invaded the sanctity of the tomb; they dragged a
dead Templar, who had been Treasurer of the Temple at Paris, from his
grave, and burnt the mouldering corpse as a heretic. <span
id="fr_381"></span>[\*](#fn_381.md) In the midst of all these sanguinary
atrocities, the examinations continued before the ecclesiastical
tribunals. Many aged and illustrious warriors, who merited a better
fate, appeared before their judges pale and trembling. At first they
revoked their confessions, declared their innocence, and were remanded
to prison; and then, panic-stricken, they demanded to be led back before
the papal commissioners, when they abandoned their retractations,
persisted in their previous avowals of *guilt*, humbly expressed their
sorrow and repentance, and were then pardoned,

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1310.</span>absolved, and reconciled to the church! The torture
still continued to be applied, and out of thirty-three Templars confined
in the chateau d’Alaix, four died in prison, and the remaining twenty
confessed, amongst other things, the following absurdities:--that in the
provincial chapter of the order held at Montpelier, the Templars set up
a head and worshipped it; that the devil often appeared there in the
shape of a cat, and conversed with the assembled brethren, and promised
them a good harvest, with the possession of riches, and all kinds of
temporal property. Some asserted that the head worshipped by the
fraternity possessed a long beard; others that it was a woman's head;
and one of the prisoners declared that as often as this wonderful head
was adored, a great number of devils made their appearance in the shape
of beautiful women . . . . . .!! <span id="fr_382"></span>[\*](#fn_382.md)

We must now unfold the dark page in the history of the order in England.
All the Templars in custody in this country had been examined separately
and apart, and had, notwithstanding, deposed in substance to the same
effect, and given the same account of their reception into the order,
and of the oaths that they took. Any reasonable and impartial mind would
consequently have been satisfied of the truth of their statements; but
it was not the object of the inquisitors to obtain evidence of the
*innocence*; but proof of the *guilt*, of the order. At first, king
Edward the Second, to his honour, forbade the infliction of torture upon
the illustrious members of the Temple in his dominions--men who had
fought and bled for Christendom, and of whose piety and morals he had a
short time before given such ample testimony to the principal sovereigns
of Europe. But the virtuous resolution of the weak king was speedily
overcome by the ill-powerful influence of the Roman pontiff, who wrote
to him in the month of June, upbraiding him for preventing the
inquisitors

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1310.</span>from submitting the Templars to the discipline of the
rack. <span id="fr_383"></span>[\*](#fn_383.md) Influenced by the
admonitions of the pope, and the solicitations of the clergy, king
Edward, on the 26th of August, sent orders to John de Crumbewell,
constable of the Tower, to deliver up all the Templars in his custody,
at the request of the inquisitors, to the sheriffs of London, in order
that the inquisitors might be able to proceed more conveniently and
effectually with their inquisition. <span
id="fr_384"></span>[†](#fn_384.md) And on the same day he directed the
sheriffs to receive the prisoners from the constable of the Tower, and
cause them to be placed in the custody of gaolers appointed by the
inquisitors, to be confined in prisons or such other convenient places
in the city of London as the inquisitors and bishops should think
expedient, and generally to permit them to do with the bodies of the
Templars whatever should seem fitting, in accordance with ecclesiastical
law. He directs, also, that from thenceforth the Templars should receive
their sustenance at the hands of such newly-appointed gaolers. <span
id="fr_385"></span>[‡](#fn_385.md)

On the Tuesday after the feast of St. Matthew, (Sept. 21st,) the
ecclesiastical council again assembled at London, and caused the
inquisitions and depositions taken against the Templars to be read,
which being done, great disputes arose touching various alterations
observable in them. It was at length ordered that the Templars should be
again confined in separate cells in the prisons of London; that fresh
interrogatories should be prepared, to see if by such means the *truth*
could be extracted, and

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1310.</span>if by straitenings and confinement they would *confess
nothing further*, then the torture was to be applied; but it was
provided that the examination by torture should be conducted without the
PERPETUAL MUTILATION OR DISABLING OF ANY LIMB, AND WITHOUT A VIOLENT
EFFUSION OF BLOOD! and the inquisitors and the bishops of London and
Chichester were to notify the result to the archbishop of Canterbury,
that he might again convene the assembly for the purpose of passing
sentence, either of absolution or of condemnation. These resolutions
having been adopted, the council was prorogued, on the following
Saturday, *de die in diem*, until the feast of the Exaltation of the
Holy Cross, A.D. 1311. <span id="fr_386"></span>[\*](#fn_386.md)

On the 6th of October, a fortnight after the above resolution had been
formed by the council, the king sent fresh instructions to the constable
of the Tower, and the sheriffs of London, directing them to deliver up
the Templars, one at a time, or altogether, and receive them back in the
same way, at the will of the inquisitors. <span
id="fr_387"></span>[†](#fn_387.md) The gaolers of these unhappy gentlemen
seem to have been more merciful and considerate than their judges, and
to have manifested the greatest reluctance to act upon the orders sent
from the king. On the 23rd of October, further and more preremptory
commands were forwarded to the constable of the Tower, distinctly
informing him that the king, on account of his respect for the holy
apostolic see, had lately conceded to the prelates and inquisitors
deputed to take inquisition against the order of the Temple, and the
Grand Preceptor of that order in England, the power of ordering and
disposing of the Templars

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1310.</span>and their bodies, of examining them by TORTURE or
otherwise, and of doing to them whatever they should deem expedient,
according to the ecclesiastical law; and he again strictly enjoins the
constable to deliver up all the Templars in his custody, either together
or separately, or in any way that the inquisitors or one bishop and one
inquisitor may direct, and to receive them back when required so to
do. <span id="fr_388"></span>[\*](#fn_388.md) Corresponding orders were
again sent to the sheriffs, commanding them, at the requisition of the
inquisitors, to get the Templars out of the hands of the constable of
the Tower, to guard them in convenient prisons, and to permit certain
persons deputed by the inquisitors to see that the imprisonment was
properly carried into effect, to do with the bodies of the Templars
whatever they should think fit according to ecclesiastical law. When the
inquisitors, or the persons appointed by them, had done with the
Templars what they pleased, they were to deliver them back to the
constable of the Tower, or his lieutenant, there to be kept in custody
as before. <span id="fr_389"></span>[†](#fn_389.md) Orders were likewise
sent to the constable of the castle of Lincoln, and to the mayor and
bailiffs of the city of Lincoln, to the same effect. The king also
directed Roger de Wyngefeld, clerk, guardian of the lands of the
Templars, and William Plummer, sub-guardian of the manor of Creasing, to
furnish to the king's officers the sums required for the keep, and for
the expenses of the detention of the brethren of the order. <span
id="fr_390"></span>[‡](#fn_390.md)

On the 22nd of November the king condescended to acquaint

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1310.</span>the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of his faithful
city of London, that out of reverence to the pope he had authorised the
inquisitors, sent over by his holiness, to question the Templars by
TORTURE; he puts them in possession of the orders he had sent to the
constable of the Tower, and to the sheriffs; and he commands them, in
case it should be notified to them by the inquisitors that the prisons
provided by the sheriffs were insufficient for their purposes, to
procure without fail fit and convenient houses in the city, or near
thereto, for carrying into effect the contemplated measures; and he
graciously informs them that he will reimburse them all the expenses
that may be incurred by them or their officers in fulfilling his
commands. <span id="fr_391"></span>[\*](#fn_391.md) Shortly afterwards the
king again wrote to the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty of London,
acquainting them that the sheriffs had made a return to his writ, to the
effect that the four gates (prisons) of the city were not under their
charge, and that they could not therefore obtain them for the purposes
required; and he commands the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, to place
those four gates at the disposal of the sheriffs. <span
id="fr_392"></span>[†](#fn_392.md)

On the 12th of December, all the Templars in custody at Lincoln were, by
command of the king, brought up to London, and placed in solitary
confinement in different prisons and private houses provided by the
mayor and sheriffs. Shortly afterwards orders were given for all the
Templars in custody in London to be loaded with chains and fetters; the
myrmidons of the inquisitors were to be allowed to make periodical
visits to see that the imprisonment was properly carried into effect,
and were to be allowed to TORTURE the bodies of the Templars in any way
that they might think fit. <span id="fr_393"></span>[‡](#fn_393.md)

On the 30th of March, A.D. 1311, after some months’ trial of

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>the above severe measures, the examination was resumed
before the inquisitors, and the bishops of London and Chichester, at the
several churches of St. Martin's, Ludgate, and St. Botolph's,
Bishopsgate. The Templars had now been in prison in England for the
space of three years and some months. During the whole of the previous
winter they had been confined in chains in the dungeons of the city of
London, compelled to receive their scanty supply of food from the
officers of the inquisition, and to suffer from cold, from hunger, and
from torture. They had been made to endure all the horrors of solitary
confinement, and had none to solace or to cheer them during the long
hours of their melancholy captivity. They had been already condemned
collectively by the pope, as members of an heretical and idolatrous
society, and as long as they continued to persist in the truth of their
first confessions, and in the avowal of their innocence, they were
treated as obstinate, unreconciled heretics, living in a state of
excommunication, and doomed, when dead, to everlasting punishment in
hell. They had heard of the miserable fate of their brethren in France,
and they knew that those who had confessed crimes of which they had
never been guilty, had been immediately declared reconciled to the
church, had been absolved and set at liberty, and they knew that
freedom, pardon, and peace could be immediately purchased by a
confession of guilt; notwithstanding all which, every Templar, at this
last examination, persisted in the maintenance of his innocence, and in
the denial of all knowledge of, or participation in, the crimes and
heresies imputed to the order. They declare that everything that was
done in their chapters, in respect of absolution, the reception of
brethren, and other matters, was honourable and honest, and might well
and lawfully be done; that it was in no wise heretical or vicious; and
that whatever was done was from

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>the appointment, approbation, and regulation of all the
brethren. <span id="fr_394"></span>[\*](#fn_394.md) From their statements,
it appears that the Master of the Temple in England was in the habit of
summoning a general chapter of the order once a year, at which the
preceptors of Ireland and of Scotland were present. These were always
called together to take into consideration the affairs of the Holy Land,
and to determine on sending succour to their brethren in the East. At
the close of their examination the Templars were again sent back to
their dungeons, and loaded with chains; and the inquisitors,
disappointed of the desired confessions, addressed themselves to the
enemies of the order for the necessary proofs of guilt.

During the month of April, seventy-two witnesses were examined in the
chapter-house of the Holy Trinity. They were nearly all monks,
Carmelites, Augustinians, Dominicans, and Minorites; their evidence is
all hearsay, and the nature of it will be seen from the following choice
specimens.

Henry Thanet, an Irishman, had *heard* that Brother Hugh de Nipurias, a
Templar, deserted from the castle of Tortosa in Palestine, and went over
to the Saracens, abjuring the christian faith; and that a certain
preceptor of the Pilgrim's Castle was in the habit of making all the
brethren he received into the order deny Christ; but the witness was
unable to give either the name of the preceptor or of the persons so
received. He had also heard that a certain Templar had in his custody a
brazen head with two faces, which would answer all questions put to it!

Master John de Nassington declared that Milo de Stapelton and Adam de
Everington, knights, told him that they had once been invited to a great
feast at the preceptory of Templehurst, and were there informed that the
Templars celebrated a solemn festival once a year, at which they
worshipped a *calf!* 

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>John de Eure, knight, sheriff of the county of York,
deposed that he had once invited Brother William de la Fenne, Preceptor
of Wesdall, to dine with him, and that after dinner the preceptor drew a
book out of his bosom, and delivered it to the knight's lady to read,
who found a piece of paper fastened into the book, on which were written
abominable, heretical doctrines, to the effect that Christ was not the
Son of God, nor born of a virgin, but conceived of the seed of Joseph,
the husband of Mary, after the manner of other men, and that Christ was
not a true but a false prophet, and was not crucified for the redemption
of mankind, but for his own sins, and many other things contrary to the
christian faith. On the production of this important evidence, Brother
William de la Fenne was called in and interrogated; he admitted that he
had dined with the sheriff of York, and had lent his lady a book to
read, but he swore that he was ignorant of the piece of paper fastened
into the book, and of its contents. It appears that the sheriff of York
had kept this dangerous secret to himself for the space of six years!

William de la Forde, a priest, rector of the church of Crofton in the
diocese of York, had *heard* William de Reynbur, priest of the order of
St. Augustine, who was then dead, say, that the Templar, Brother Patrick
of Rippon, son of William of Gloucester, had confessed to him, that at
his entrance into the order, he was led, clothed only in his shirt and
trousers, through a long passage to a secret chamber, and was there made
to deny his God and his Saviour; that he was then shown a representation
of the crucifixion, and was told that since he had previously honoured
that emblem he must now dishonour it and spit upon it, and that he did
so. "Item dictum fuit ei quod, depositis brachia, dorsum verteret ad
crucifixum," and this he did bitterly weeping. After this they brought
an image, as it were, of a calf, placed upon au altar, and they told him
he must kiss that image, and worship it,

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>and he did so, and after all this they covered up his
eyes and led him about, kissing and being kissed by all the brethren,
but he could not recollect in what part. The worthy priest was asked
when he had first heard all these things, and he replied *after* the
arrest of the brethren by the king's orders!

Robert of Oteringham, senior of the order of Minorites, stated that on
one occasion he was partaking of the hospitality of the Templars at the
preceptory of Ribstane in Yorkshire, and that when grace had been said
after supper, the chaplain of the order reprimanded the brethren of the
Temple, saying to them, "The devil will burn you," or some such words;
and hearing a bustle amongst them, he got up to see what was the matter,
and, as far as he recollects, he saw one of the brothers of the Temple,
"brachia depositis, tenentem faciem versus occidentem et posteriora
versus altare!" Being asked who it was that did this, he says he does
not exactly remember. He then goes on to state, that about twenty years
before that time! he was again the guest of the Templars, at the
preceptory of Wetherby (query Feriby) in Yorkshire, and when evening
came he heard that the preceptor was not coming to supper, as he was
arranging some relics that he had brought with him from the Holy Land,
and afterwards at midnight he heard a confused noise in the chapel, and
getting up he looked through the keyhole, and saw a great light therein,
either from a fire or from candles, and on the morrow he asked one of
the brethren of the Temple the name of the saint in whose honour they
had celebrated so grand a festival during the night, and that brother,
aghast and turning pale, thinking he had seen what had been done amongst
them, said to him, "Go thy way, and if you love me, or have any regard
for your own life, never speak of this matter." This same "Senior of the
Minorites" declares also that he had seen, in the chapel of the
preceptory of Ribstane, a cross, with the image of our Saviour

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>nailed upon it, thrown carelessly upon the altar, and
he observed to a certain brother of the Temple, that the cross was in a
most indecent and improper position, and he was about to lift it up and
stand it erect, when that same brother called out to him, "Lay down the
cross and depart in peace!"

Brother John de Wederal, another Minorite, sent to the inquisitors a
written paper, wherein he stated that he had lately *heard* in the
country, that a Templar, named Robert de Baysat, was once seen running
about a meadow uttering, "Alas! alas! that ever I was born, seeing that
I have denied God and sold myself to the devil!" Brother N. de Chinon,
another Minorite, had heard that a certain Templar had a son who peeped
through a chink in the wall of the chapter-room, and saw a person who
was about to be professed, slain because he would not deny Christ, and
afterwards the boy was asked by his father to become a Templar, but
refused, and he immediately shared the same fate. Twenty witnesses, who
were examined in each other's presence, merely repeated the above
absurdities, or related similar ones. <span
id="fr_395"></span>[\*](#fn_395.md)

At this stage of the proceedings, the papal inquisitor, Sicard de Vaur,
exhibited two rack-extorted confessions of Templars which had been
obtained in France. The first was from Robert de St. Just, who had been
received into the order by brother Himbert, Grand Preceptor of England,
but had been arrested in France, and there tortured by the myrmidons of
Philip. In this confession, Robert de St. Just states that, on his
admission to the vows of the Temple, he denied Christ, and spat *beside*
the cross. The second confession had been extorted from Geoffrey de
Gonville, Knight of the Order of the Temple, Preceptor of Aquitaine and
Poitou, and had been given on the 15th of November,

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
A.D. 1307, before the grand inquisitor of France. In this confession,
(which had been afterwards revoked, but of which revocation no notice
was taken by the inquisitors,) Sir Geoffrey de Gonville states that he
was received into the order in England in the house of the Temple at
London, by Brother Robert de Torvibe, knight, the Master of all England,
about twenty-eight years before that time; that the master showed him on
a missal the image of Jesus Christ on the cross, and commanded him to
deny him who was crucified; that, terribly alarmed, he exclaimed, "
Alas! my lord, why should I do this? I will on no account do it." But
the master said to him, Do it boldly; I swear to thee that the act shall
never harm either thy soul or thy conscience;" and then proceeded to
inform him that the custom had been introduced into the order by a
certain bad Grand Master, who was imprisoned by a certain sultan, and
could escape from prison only on condition that he would establish that
form of reception in his order, and compel all who were received to deny
Christ Jesus! but the deponent remained inflexible; he refused to deny
his Saviour, and asked where were his uncle and the other good people
who had brought him there, and was told that they were all gone; and at
last a compromise took place between him and the Master, who made him
take his oath that he would tell all his brethren that he had gone
through the customary form, and never reveal that it had been dispensed
with! He states also that the ceremony was instituted in memory of St.
Peter, who three times denied Christ! <span
id="fr_396"></span>[\*](#fn_396.md)

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>Ferinsius le Mareschal, a secular knight, being
examined, declared that his grandfather entered into the order of the
Temples active, healthy, and blithesome as the birds and the dogs, but
on the third day from his taking the vows he was dead, and, as he *now
suspects*, was killed because he refused to participate in the
iniquities practised by the brethren. An Augustine monk declared that he
had heard a Templar say that a man after death had no more soul than a
dog. Roger, rector of the church of Godmersham, swore that about fifteen
years before he had an intention of entering into the order of the
Temple himself, and consulted Stephen Queynterel, one of the brothers,
on the subject, who advised him not to do so, and stated that they had
*three* articles amongst themselves in their order, known only to God,
the devil, and the brethren of the Temple, and the said Stephen would
not reveal to the deponent what those articles were.

The vicar of the church of Saint Clement at Sandwich had *heard* that a
boy had secreted himself in the large hall where the Templars held their
chapter, and beard the Master preach to the brethren, and explain to
them in what mode they might enrich themselves; and after the chapter
was concluded, one of the brothers, in going out of the hall, dropped
his girdle, which the boy found and carried to the brother who had so
dropped it, when the latter drew his sword and instantly slew him! But
to crown all, Brother John de Gertia, a Minorite, had *heard* from a
certain woman called Cacocaca! who had it from Exvalettus, Preceptor of
London, that one of the servants of the Templars entered the hall where
the chapter was held, and secreted himself, and after the door had been
shut and locked by the last Templar who entered, and the key had been
brought by him to the superior, the assembled Templars jumped up and
went into another room, and opened a closet, and drew therefrom a
certain

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>black figure with shining eyes, and a cross, and they
placed the cross before the Master, and the "culum idoli vel figuræ"
they placed upon the cross, and carried it to the Master, who kissed the
said image, (in ano,) and all the others did the same after him; and
when they had finished kissing, they all spat three times upon the
cross, except one, who refused, saying, "I was a bad man in the world,
and placed myself in this order for the salvation of my soul; what could
I do worse? I will not do it;" and then the brethren said to him, "Take
heed, and do as you see the order do;" but he answered that he would not
do so, and then they placed him in a well which stood in the midst of
their house, and covered the well up, and left him to perish. Being
asked as to the time when the woman heard this, the deponent stated that
she told it to him about fourteen years back at London, where she kept a
shop for her husband, Robert Cotacota! This witness also knew a certain
Walter Salvagyo of the family of Earl Warrenne, grandfather of the then
earl, who, having entered into the order of the Temple, was about two
years afterwards entirely lost sight of by his family, and neither the
earl nor any of his friends could ever learn what had become of him.

John Walby de Bust, another Minorite, had *heard* John de Dingeston say
that *he had heard* that there was in a secret place of the house of the
Templars at London a gilded head, and that when one of the Masters was
on his deathbed, he summoned to his presence several preceptors, and
told them that if they wished for power, and dominion, and honour, they
must worship that head.

Brother Richard de Koefeld, a monk, had *heard* from John de Borna, who
had it from the Knight Templar Walter le Bacheler, that every man who
entered into the order of the Temple had to sell himself to the devil;
he had also *heard* from the priest

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Walter, rector of the church of Hodlee, who had it from a certain vicar,
who was a priest of the said Walter le Bacheler, that there was one
article in the profession of the Templars which might not be revealed to
any living man.

Gasper de Nafferton, chaplain of the parish of Ryde, deposed that three
years back he was in the employ of the Templars for about six months,
during which period William de Pokelington was received into the order;
that he well recollected that the said William made his appearance at
the Temple on Sunday evening, with the equipage and habit of a member of
the order, accompanied by Brother William de la More, the Master of the
Temple, Brother William de Grafton, Preceptor of Ribbestane and
Fontebriggs; and other brethren: that the same night, during the first
watch, they assembled in the church, and caused the deponent to be
awakened to say mass; that, after the celebration of the mass, they made
the deponent with his clerk go out into the hall beyond the cloister,
and then sent for the person who was to be received; and on his entry
into the church one of the brethren immediately closed all the doors
opening into the cloister, so that no one within the chambers could get
out, and thus they remained till daylight; but what was done in the
church the deponent knew not; the next day, however, he saw the said
William clothed in the habit of a Templar, looking very sorrowful. The
deponent also declared that he had threatened to peep through a secret
door to see what was going on, but was warned that it was inevitable
death so to do. He states that the next morning he went into the church,
and found the books and crosses all removed from the places in which he
had previously left them; that he afterwards saw the knight Templar
Brother William deliver to the newly-received brother a large roll of
paper, containing the rule of the order, which the said newly-received
brother was directed to transcribe in private;

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>that after the departure of the said Brother William,
the deponent approached the said newly-received brother, who was then
diligently writing, and asked to be allowed to inspect the roll, but was
told that none but members of the order could be allowed to read it;
that be was then about to depart, when Brother William made his
appearance, and, astonished and confounded at the sight of the deponent,
snatched up the roll and walked away with it, declaring, with a great
oath, that he would never again allow it to go out of his hands.

Brother John de Donyngton, of the order of the Minorites, the
seventy-sixth witness examined, being sworn, deposed that some years
back an old veteran of the Temple (whose name he could not recollect)
told him that the order possessed four chief idols in England, one at
London in the sacristy of the Temple; another at the preceptory of
Bistelesham; a third at Bruere in Lincolnshire; and the fourth in some
place beyond the Humber, (the name of which he had forgotten;) that
Brother William de la More, the Master of the Temple, introduced the
melancholy idolatry of the Templars into England, and brought with him
into the country a great roll, whereon were inscribed in large
characters the wicked practices and observances of the order. The said
old veteran also told the deponent that many of the Templars carried
idols about with them in boxes, &c. &c.

The deponent further states that he recollected well that a private
gentleman, Master William de Shokerwyk, a short time back, had prepared
to take the vows of the order, and carried his treasures and all the
property he had to the Temple at London; and that as he was about to
deposit it in the treasury, one of the brethren of the Temple heaved a
profound sigh, and Master William de Shokerwyk having asked what ailed
him, he immediately replied, "It will be the worse for you, brother, if
you enter our order;" that the said Master William asked why, and the
Templar

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>replied, "You see us externally, but not internally;
take heed what you do; but I shall say no more;" and the deponent
further declares, that on another occasion the said Master William
entered into the Temple Hall, and found there an old Templar, who was
playing at the game called Daly; and the old Templar observing that
there was no one in the hall besides himself and the said Master
William, said to the latter, "If you enter into our order, it will be
the worse for you."

The witness then goes into a rambling account of various transactions in
the East, tending to show that the Templars were in alliance with the
Saracens, and had acted with treachery towards the christian
cause! <span id="fr_397"></span>[\*](#fn_397.md)

After the delivery of all this hearsay, these vague suspicions and
monstrous improbabilities, the notaries proceeded to arrange the
valuable testimony adduced, and on the 22nd of April all the Templars in
custody in the Tower and in the prisons of the city were assembled
before the inquisitors and the bishops of London and Chichester, in the
church of the Holy Trinity, to hear the depositions and attestations of
the witnesses publicly read. The Templars required copies of these
depositions, which were granted them, and they were allowed eight days
from that period to bring forward any defences or privileges they wished
to make use of. Subsequently, before the expiration of the eight days,
the officer of the bishop of London was sent to the Tower with
scriveners and witnesses, to know if they would then set up any matters
of defence, to whom the Templars replied that they were unlettered men,
ignorant of law, and that all means of defence were denied them, since
they were not permitted to employ those who could afford them fit
counsel and advice. They observed, however, that they were desirous of
publicly proclaiming the faith, and the religion of themselves

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>and of the order to which they belonged, of showing the
privileges conceded to them by the chief pontiffs, and their own
depotions taken before the inquisitors, all which they said they wished
to make use of in their defence.

On the eighth day, being Thursday the 29th of April, they appeared
before the papal inquisitors and the bishops of London and Chichester,
in the church of All Saints of Berkyngecherche, and presented to them
the following declaration, which they had drawn up amongst themselves,
as the only defence they had to offer against the injustice, the
tyranny, and the persecution of their powerful oppressors; adding, that
if they had in any way done wrong, they were ready to submit themselves
to the orders of the church.

This declaration is written in the Norman French of that day, and is as
follows:

"*Conue chese seit a nostre honurable pere, le ercevesque de

"Be it known to our honourable father, the archbishop of Canterbury,
primate of all England, and to all the prelates of holy church, and to
all Christians, that all we brethren of the Temple here assembled, and
every of one of us are Christians, and believe in our Saviour Jesus
Christ, in God the Father omnipotent, &c. &c. . . . ."

"And we believe all that the holy church believes and teaches us. We
declare that our religion is founded on vows of obedience, chastity, and
poverty, and of aiding in the conquest of the Holy Land of Jerusalem,
with all the power and might that God affordeth us. And we firmly deny
and contradict, one and all of us, all manner of heresy and evil doings,
contrary to the faith of

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>holy church. And for the love of God, and for charity,
we beseech you, who represent our holy father the pope, that we may be
treated like true children of the church, for we have well guarded and
preserved the faith and the law of the church, and of our own religion,
the which is good, honest, and just, according to the ordinances and the
privileges of the court of Rome, granted, confirmed, and canonized by
common council; the which privileges, together with the rule of our
order, are enregistered in the said court. And we would bring forward
all Christians, (save our enemies and slanderers,) with whom we are
conversant, and among whom we have resided, to say how and in what
manner we have spent our lives. And if, in our examinations, we have
said or done anything wrong through ignorance of a word, since we are
unlettered men, we are ready to suffer for holy church like him who died
for us on the blessed cross. And we believe all the sacraments of the
church. And we beseech you, for the love of God, and as you hope to be
saved, that you judge us as you will have to answer for yourselves and
for us before God; and we pray that our examination may be read and
heard before ourselves and all the people, *in the very language and
words in which it was given before you, and written down on paper*."

The above declaration was presented by Brother William de la More, the
Master of the Temple; the Knights Templars Philip de Mewes, Preceptor of
Garwy; William de Burton, Preceptor of Cumbe; Radulph de Maison,
Preceptor of Ewell; Michael de Baskevile, Preceptor of London; Thomas de
Wothrope, Preceptor of Bistelesham; William de Warwick, Priest; and
Thomas de Burton, Chaplain of the Order; together with twenty serving
brothers. The same day the inquisitors and the two bishops proceeded to
the different prisons of the city to demand if the prisoners confined
therein wished to bring forward anything in defence of

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>the order, who severally answered that they would adopt
and abide by the declaration made by their brethren in the Tower.

It appears that in the prison of Aldgate there were confined Brother
William de Sautre, Knight, Preceptor of Samford; Brother William de la
Ford, Preceptor of Daney; Brother John de Coningeston, Preceptor of
Getinges; Roger de Norreis, Preceptor of Cressing; Radulph de Barton,
priest, Prior of the New Temple; and several serving brethren of the
order. In the prison of Crepelgate were detained William de Egendon,
Knight, Preceptor of Schepeley; John de Moun, Knight, Preceptor of
Dokesworth; and four serving brethren. In the prison of Ludgate were
five serving brethren; and in Newgate was confined Brother Himbert
Blanke, Knight, Grand Preceptor of Auvergne.

The above declaration of faith and innocence was far from agreeable to
the papal inquisitors, who required a confession of guilt, and the
torture was once more directed to be applied. The king sent fresh orders
to the mayor and the sheriffs of the city of London, commanding them to
place the Templars in separate dungeons; to load them with chains and
fetters; to permit the myrmidons of the inquisitors to pay periodical
visits to see that the wishes and intentions of the inquisitors, with
regard to the severity of the confinement, were properly carried into
effect; and, lastly, to inflict TORTURE upon the bodies of the Templars,
and generally to do whatever should be thought fitting and expedient in
the premises, according to ecclesiastical law. <span
id="fr_399"></span>[\*](#fn_399.md) In conformity

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>with these orders, we learn from the record of the
proceedings, that the Templars were placed in solitary confinement in
loathsome dungeons; that they were placed on a short allowance of bread
and water, and periodically visited by the agents of the inquisition;
that they were moved from prison to prison, and from dungeon to dungeon;
were now treated with rigour, and anon with indulgence; and were then
visited by learned prelates, and acute doctors in theology, who, by
exhortation, persuasion, and by menace, attempted in every possible mode
to wring from them the required avowals. We learn that all the engines
of terror wielded by the church were put in force, and that torture was
unsparingly applied "*usque ad judicium sanguinis!*" The places in which
these atrocious scenes were enacted were the Tower, the prisons of
Aldgate, Ludgate, Newgate, Bishops-gate, and Crepelgate, the house
formerly belonging to John de Banguel, and the tenements once the
property of the brethren of penitence. <span
id="fr_400"></span>[\*](#fn_400.md) It appears that some French monks were
sent over to administer the torture to the unhappy captives, and that
they were questioned and examined in the presence of notaries whilst
suffering under the torments of the rack. The relentless perseverance
and the incessant exertions of the foreign inquisitors were at last
rewarded by a splendid triumph over the powers of endurance of two poor
serving brethren, and one chaplain of the order of the Temple, who were
at last induced to make the long-desired avowals.

On the 23rd of June, Brother Stephen de Stapelbrugge, described as an
apostate and fugitive of the order of the Temple, captured by the king's
officers in the city of Salisbury, deposed in the house of the head
gaoler of Newgate, in the presence of the bishops of London and
Chichester, the chancellor of the archbishop of Canterbury, Hugh de
Walkeneby, doctor of theology,

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>and other clerical witnesses, that there were two modes
of profession in the order of the Temple, the one good and lawful, and
the other contrary to the christian faith; that he himself was received
into the order by Brother Brian le Jay, Grand Preceptor of England at
Dynneslee, and was led into the chapel, the door of which was closed as
soon as he had entered; that a cross was placed before the Master, and
that a brother of the Temple, with a drawn sword, stood on either side
of him; that the Master said to him, "Do you see this image of the
crucifixion?" to which he replied, "I see it, my lord;" that the Master
then said to him, "You must deny that Christ Jesus was God and man, and
that Mary was his mother; and you must spit upon this cross;" which the
deponent, through immediate fear of death, did with his mouth, but not
with his heart, and he spat beside the cross, and not on it; and then
falling down upon his knees, with eyes uplifted, with his hands clasped,
with bitter tears and sighs, and devout ejaculations, he besought the
mercy and the favour of holy church, declaring that he cared not for the
death of the body, or for any amount of penance, but only for the
salvation of his soul.

On Saturday, the 25th of June, Brother Thomas Tocci de Thoroldeby,
serving brother of the order of the Temple, described as an apostate who
had escaped from Lincoln after his examination at that place by the
papal inquisitors, but had afterwards surrendered himself to the king's
officers, was brought before the bishops of London and Chichester, the
archdeacon of Salisbury, and others of the clergy in St. Martin's Church
in Vinetriâ; and being again examined, he repeated the statement made in
his first deposition, but added some particulars with regard to penances
imposed and absolutions pronounced in the chapter, showing the
difference between sins and defaults, the priest having to deal with the
one, and the Master with the other.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
He declared that the little cords were worn from honourable motives, and
relates a story of his being engaged in a battle against the Saracens,
in which he lost his cord, and was punished by the Grand Master for a
default in coming home without it. He gives the same account of the
secrecy of the chapters as all the other brethren, states that the
members of the order were forbidden to confess to the friars mendicants,
and were enjoined to confess to their own chaplains; that they did
nothing contrary to the christian faith, and as to their endeavouring to
promote the advancement of the order by any means, right or wrong, that
exactly the contrary was the ease, as there was a statute in the order
to the effect, that if any one should be found to have acquired anything
unjustly, he should be deprived of his habit, and be expelled the order.
Being asked what induced him to become an apostate, and to fly from his
order, he replied that it was through fear of death, because the abbot
of Lagny, (the papal inquisitor,) when he examined him at Lincoln, asked
him if he would not confess anything further, and he answered that he
knew of nothing further to confess, unless he were to say things that
were not true; and that *the abbot, laying his hand upon his breast,
swore by the word of God that he would make him confess before he had
done with him!* and that being terribly frightened he afterwards bribed
the gaoler of the castle of Lincoln, giving him forty florins to let him
make his escape.

The abbot of Lagny, indeed, was as good as his word, for on the 29th of
June, four days after this imprudent avowal, Brother Thomas Tocci de
Thoroldeby was brought back to Saint Martin's Church, and there, in the
presence of the same parties, he made a third confession, in which he
declares that, coerced by two Templars with drawn swords in their hands,
he denied Christ with his mouth, but not with his heart; and spat
*beside* the cross, but not on it; that he was required to spit upon the
image of

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>the Virgin Mary, but contrived, instead of doing so, to
give her a kiss on the foot. He declares that he had heard Brian le Jay,
the Master of the Temple at London, say a hundred times over, that Jesus
Christ was not the true God, but a man, and that the smallest hair out
of the beard of one Saracen was of more worth than the whole body of any
Christian. He declares that he was once standing in the presence of
Brother Brian, when some poor people besought charity of him for the
love of God and our lady the blessed Virgin Mary; and he answered, "*Que
dame, alez vous pendre a vostre dame*"--"What lady? go and be hanged to
your lady," and violently casting a halfpenny into the mud, he made the
poor people hunt for it, although it was in the depth of a severe
winter. He also relates that at the chapters the priest stood like a
beast, and had nothing to do but to repeat the psalm, "God be merciful
unto us, and bless us," which was read at the closing of the chapter.
(The Templars, by the way, must have been strange idolaters to have
closed their chapters, in which they are accused of worshipping a cat, a
man's head, and a black idol, with the reading of the beautiful psalm,
"God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and show us the light of thy
countenance, that *thy way may be known upon earth*, thy saving health
among all nations," &c. Psalm lxvii.) This witness further states, that
the priest had no power to impose a heavier penance than a day's fast on
bread and water, and could not even do that without the permission of
the brethren. He is made also to relate that the Templars always
favoured the Saracens in the holy wars in Palestine, and oppressed the
Christians! and he declares, speaking of himself, that for three years
before he had never seen the body of Christ without thinking of the
devil, nor could he remove that evil thought from his heart by prayer,
or in any other way that he knew of; but that very morning he had heard
mass with great devotion, and since then had thought only of Christ, and

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>thinks there is no one in the order of the Temple whose
soul will be saved, unless a reformation takes place. <span
id="fr_401"></span>[\*](#fn_401.md)

Previous to this period, the ecclesiastical council had again assembled,
and these last depositions of Brothers Stephen de Stapelbrugge and
Thomas Tocci de Thoroldeby having been produced before them, the
following solemn farce was immediately publicly enacted. It is thus
described in the record of the proceedings:

"To the praise and glory of the name of the most high Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost, to the confusion of heretics, and the
strengthening of all faithful Christians, begins the public record of
the reconciliation of the penitent heretics, returning to the orthodox
faith published in the council, celebrated at London in the year 1311.

"In the name of God, Amen. In the year of the incarnation of our Lord
1311, on the twenty-seventh day of the month of June, in the hall of the
palace of the bishop of London, before the venerable fathers the Lord
Robert by the grace of God archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all
England, and his suffragans in provincial council assembled, appeared
Brother Stephen de Stapelbrugge, of the order of the chivalry of the
Temple; and the denying of Christ and the blessed Virgin Mary his
mother, the spitting upon the cross, and the heresies and errors
acknowledged and confessed by him in his deposition being displayed, the
same Stephen asserted in full council, before the people of the City of
London, introduced for the occasion, that all those things so deposed by
him were true, and that to that confession he would wholly adhere;
humbly confessing his error on his bended knees, with his hands clasped,
with much lamentation and many tears, he again and again besought the
mercy and pity of holy mother church, offering to

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>abjure all heresies and errors, and praying them to
impose on him a fitting penance, and then the book of the holy gospels
being placed in his hands, he abjured the aforesaid heresies in this
form:

"I, brother Stephen de Stapelbrugge, of the order of the chivalry of the
Temple, do solemnly confess," &c. &c. (he repeats his confession, makes
his abjuration, and then proceeds;) "and if at any time hereafter I
shall happen to relapse into the same errors, or deviate from any of the
articles of the faith, I will account myself *ipso facto*
excommunicated; I will stand condemned as a manifest perjured heretic,
and the punishment inflicted on perjured relapsed heretics shall be
forthwith imposed upon me without further trial or judgment!!"

He was then sworn upon the holy gospels to stand to the sentence of the
church in the matter, after which Brother Thomas Tocci de Thoroldeby was
brought forward to go through the same monstrous ceremony, which being
concluded, these two poor serving brothers of the order of the Temple,
who were so ignorant that they could not write, were made to place their
mark (*loco subscriptionis*) on the record of the abjuration.

"And then our lord the archbishop of Canterbury, for the purpose of
absolving and reconciling to the unity of the church the aforesaid
Thomas and Stephen, conceded his authority and that of the whole council
to the bishop of London, in the presence of me the notary, specially
summoned for the occasion, in these words: 'We grant to you the
authority of God, of the blessed Mary, of the blessed Thomas the Martyr
our patron, and of all the saints of God (sanctorum atque *sanctarum*
Dei) to us conceded, and also the authority of the present council to us
transferred, to the end that thou mayest reconcile to the unity of the
church these miserables, separated from her by their repudiation

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>of the faith, and now brought back again to her bosom,
reserving to ourselves and the council the right of imposing a fit
penance for their transgressions!' And as there were two penitents, the
bishop of Chichester was joined to the bishop of London for the purpose
of pronouncing the absolution, which two bishops, putting on their
mitres and pontificals, and being assisted by twelve priests in
sacerdotal vestments, placed themselves in seats at the western entrance
of the cathedral church of Saint Paul, and the penitents, with bended
knees, humbly prostrating themselves in prayer upon the steps before the
door of the church, the members of the council and the people of the
city standing around; and the psalm, *Have mercy upon me, O God, after
thy great goodness*," having been chaunted from the beginning to the
end, and the subjoined prayers and sermon having been gone through, they
absolved the said penitents, and received them back to the unity of the
church in the following form:

"In the name of God, Amen. Since by your confession we find that you,
Brother Stephen de Stapelbrugge, have denied Christ Jesus and the
blessed Virgin Mary, and have spat *beside* the cross, and now taking
better advice wishest to return to the unity of the holy church with a
true heart and sincere faith, as you assert, and all heretical depravity
having for that purpose been previously abjured by you according to the
form of the church, we, by the authority of the council, absolve you
from the bonds of excommunication wherewith you were held fast, and we
reconcile you to the unity of the church, if you shall have returned to
her in sincerity of heart, and shall have obeyed her injunctions imposed
upon you."

Brother Thomas Tocci de Thoroldeby was then absolved and reconciled to
the church in the same manner, after which various psalms

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
(Gloria Patri, Kyrie Eleyson, Christe Eleyson, &c. &c.) were sung, and
prayers were offered up, and then the ceremony was concluded. <span
id="fr_402"></span>[\*](#fn_402.md)

On the 1st of July, an avowal of guilt was wrung by the inquisitors from
Brother John de Stoke, chaplain of the order, who, being brought before
the bishops of London and Chichester in St. Martin's church, deposed
that he was received in the mode mentioned by him on his first
examination; but a year and fifteen days after that reception, being at
the preceptory of Garwy in the diocese of Hereford, he was called into
the chamber of Brother James de Molay, the Grand Master of the order,
who, in the presence of two other Templars of foreign extraction,
informed him that he wished to make proof of his obedience, and
commanded him to take a seat at the foot of the bed, and the deponent
did so. The Grand Master then sent into the church for the crucifix, and
two serving brothers, with naked swords in their hands, stationed
themselves on either side of the doorway. As soon as the crucifix made
its appearance, the Grand Master, pointing to the figure of our Saviour
nailed thereon, asked the deponent whose image it was, and he answered,
"The image of Jesus Christ, who suffered on the cross for the redemption
of mankind;" but the Grand Master exclaimed, "Thou sayest wrong, and are
much mistakened, for he was the son of a certain woman, and was
crucified because he called himself the Son of God, and I myself have
been in the place where he was born and crucified, and thou must now
deny him whom this image represents." The deponent exclaimed, "Far be it
from me to deny my Saviour;" but the Grand Master told him he must do
it, or he would be put into a sack and be carried to a place which he
would find by no means agreeable, and there were swords in the room, and
brothers ready to use them, &c. &c.; and the deponent asked if such was
the custom of the order, and if all the brethren did the

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>same; and being answered in the affirmative, he,
through fear of immediate death, denied Christ with his *tongue*, but
not with his *heart*. Being asked in whom he was told to put his faith
after he had denied Christ Jesus, he replies, "In that great Omnipotent
God who created the heaven and the earth." <span
id="fr_403"></span>[\*](#fn_403.md)

Such, in substance, was the whole of the criminatory evidence that could
be wrung by torture, by a long imprisonment, and by hardships of every
kind, from the Templars in England. It amounts simply to an assertion
that they compelled all whom they received into their order to renounce
the christian religion, a thing perfectly incredible. Is it to be
supposed that the many good Christians of high birth, and honour, and
exalted piety, who entered into the order of the Temple, taking the
cross for their standard and their guide, would thus suddenly have cast
their faith and their religion to the winds? Would they not rather have
denounced the impiety and iniquity to the officers of the Inquisition,
and to the pope, the superior of the order?

On Saturday, the 3rd of July, the archbishop of Canterbury, and the
bishops, the clergy, and the people of the city of London, were again
assembled around the western door of Saint Paul's cathedral, and Brother
John de Stoke, chaplain of the order of the

MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Temple, made his public recantation of the heresies confessed by him,
and was then absolved and reconciled to the church in the same manner as
Brothers Thomas de Stapelbrugge and Tocci de Thoroldeby, after which a
last effort was made to bend the remaining Templars to the wishes of the
papal inquisitors.

On Monday, July 5th, at the request of the ecclesiastical council, the
bishop of Chichester had an interview with Sir William de la More, the
Master of the Temple, taking with him certain learned lawyers,
theologians, and scriveners. He exhorted and earnestly pressed him to
abjure the heresies of which he stood convicted, by his own confessions
and those of his brethren, respecting the absolutions pronounced by him
in the chapters, and submit himself to the disposition of the church;
but the Master declared that he had never been guilty of the heresies
mentioned, and that he would not abjure crimes which he had never
committed; so he was sent back to his dungeon.

The next day, (Tuesday, July the 6th,) the bishops of London,
Winchester, and Chichester, had an interview in Southwark with the
Knight Templar, Philip de Mewes, Preceptor of Garwy, and some serving
brethren of the New Temple at London, and told them that they were
manifestly guilty of heresy, as appeared from the pope's bulls, and the
depositions taken against the order both in England and France, and also
from their own confessions regarding the absolutions pronounced in their
chapters, explaining to them that they had grievously erred in believing
that the Master of the Temple, who was a mere layman, had power to
absolve them from their sins by pronouncing an absolution in the mode
previously described, and they warned them that if they persisted in
that error they would be condemned as heretics, and that as they could
not clear themselves therefrom, it behoved them to abjure all the
heresies of which they were accused. The Templars replied that they were
ready to abjure the error they

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>had fallen into respecting the absolution, and *all
heresies of every kind*, before the archbishop of Canterbury and the
prelates of the council, whenever they should be required so to do, and
they humbly and reverently submitted themselves to the orders of the
church, beseeching pardon and grace.

A sort of compromise was then made with most of the Templars in custody
in London. They were required publicly to repeat a form of confession
and abjuration drawn up by the bishops of London and Chichester, and
were then solemnly absolved and reconciled to the church in the
following terms:--

"In the name of God, Amen. Since you have confessed in due form before
the ecclesiastical council of the province of Canterbury that you have
gravely erred concerning the sacrament of repentance, in believing that
the absolution pronounced by the Master in chapter had as much efficacy
as is implied in the words pronounced by him, that is to say, 'The sins
which you have omitted to confess through shamefacedness, or through
fear of the justice of the order, we, by virtue of the power delegated
to us by God and our lord the pope, forgive you, as far as we are able;'
and since you have confessed that you cannot entirely purge yourselves
from the heresies set forth under the apostolic bull, and taking sage
counsel with a good heart and unfeigned faith, have submitted yourselves
to the judgment and the mercy of the church, having previously abjured
the aforesaid heresies, and all heresies of every description, we, by
the authority of the council, absolve you from the chain of
excommunication wherewith you have been bound, and reconcile you once
more to the unity of the church, &c. &c."

On the 9th of July, Brother Michael de Baskevile, Knight, Preceptor of
London, and seventeen other Templars, were absolved and reconciled in
full council, in the Episcopal Hall of the see of London, in the
presence of a vast concourse of the citizens.

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>On the 10th of the same month, the Preceptors of
Dokesworth, Getinges, and Samford, the guardian of the Temple church at
London, Brother Radulph de Evesham, chaplain, with other priests,
knights, and serving brethren of the order, were absolved by the bishops
of London, Exeter, Winchester, and Chichester, in the presence of the
archbishop of Canterbury and the whole ecclesiastical council.

The next day many more members of the fraternity were publicly
reconciled to the church on the steps before the south door of Saint
Paul's cathedral, and were afterwards present at the celebration of high
mass in the interior of the sacred edifice, when they advanced in a body
towards the high altar bathed in tears, and falling down on their knees,
they devoutly kissed the sacred emblems of Christianity.

The day after, (July 12,) nineteen other Templars were publicly absolved
and reconciled to the church at the same place, in the presence of the
earls of Leicester, Pembroke, and Warwick, and afterwards assisted in
like manner at the celebration of high mass. The priests of the order
made their confessions and abjurations in Latin; the knights pronounced
them in Norman French, and the serving brethren for the most part
repeated them in English. <span id="fr_404"></span>[\*](#fn_404.md) The
vast concourse of people collected together could have comprehended but
very little of what was uttered, whilst the appearance of the penitent
brethren, and the public spectacle of their recantation, answered the
views of the papal inquisitors, and doubtless impressed the commonalty
with a conviction of the guilt of the order. Many of the Templars were
too sick (suffering doubtless from the effect of torture) to be brought
down to St. Paul's, and were therefore absolved and reconciled to the
church by the bishops of London, Winchester, and Chichester, at Saint
Mary's chapel near the Tower.

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1311.</span>Among the prisoners absolved at the above chapel were
many old veteran warriors in the last stage of decrepitude and decay.
"They were so old and so infirm," says the public notary who recorded
the proceedings, "that they were unable to stand;" their confessions
were consequently made before two masters in theology; they were then
led before the west door of the chapel, and were publicly reconciled to
the church by the bishop of Chichester; after which they were brought
into the sacred building, and were placed on their knees before the high
altar, which they devoutly kissed, whilst the tears trickled down their
furrowed cheeks. All these penitent Templars were now released from
prison, and directed to do penance in different monasteries. Precisely
the same form of proceeding was followed at York: the reconciliations
and absolution being there carried into effect before the south door of
the cathedral. <span id="fr_405"></span>[\*](#fn_405.md)

Thus terminated the proceedings against the order of the Temple in
England.

Similar measures had, in the mean time, been prosecuted against the
Templars in all parts of Christendom, but no better evidence of their
guilt than that above mentioned was ever discovered. The councils of
Tarragona and Aragon, after applying the torture, pronounced the order
free from heresy. In Portugal and in Germany the Templars were declared
innocent, and in no place situate beyond the sphere of the influence of
the king of France and his creature the pope was a single Templar
condemned to death. <span id="fr_406"></span>[†](#fn_406.md)

On the 16th of October a general council of the church, which had been
convened by the pope to pronounce the abolition of the order, assembled
at Vienne near Lyons in France. It was opened by the holy pontiff in
person, who caused the different

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1312.</span>confessions and avowals of the Templars to be read over
before the assembled nobles and prelates, and then moved the suppression
of an order wherein had been discovered such crying iniquities and
sinful abominations; but the entire council, with the exception of an
Italian prelate, nephew of the pope, and the three French bishops of
Rheims, Sens, and Rouen, all creatures of Philip, who had severally
condemned large bodies of Templars to be burnt at the stake in their
respective dioceses, were unanimously of opinion, that before the
suppression of so celebrated and illustrious an order, which had
rendered such great and signal services to the christian faith, the
members belonging to it ought to be heard in their own defence. <span
id="fr_407"></span>[\*](#fn_407.md) Such a proceeding, however, did not
suit the views of the pope and king Philip, and the assembly was
abruptly dismissed by the holy pontiff, who declared that since they
were unwilling to adopt the necessary measures, he himself, out of the
plenitude of the papal authority, would supply every defect.
Accordingly, at the commencement of the following year, the pope
summoned a private consistory; and several cardinals and French bishops
having been gained over, the holy pontiff abolished the order by an
apostolical ordinance, perpetually prohibiting every one from
thenceforth entering into it, or accepting or wearing the habit thereof,
or representing themselves to be Templars, on pain of
excommunication. <span id="fr_408"></span>[†](#fn_408.md)

On the 3rd of April, the second session of the council was opened by the
pope at Vienne. King Philip and his three sons

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1312.</span>were present, accompanied by a large body of troops,
and the papal decree abolishing the order was published before the
assembly. <span id="fr_409"></span>[\*](#fn_409.md) The members of the
council appear to have been called together merely to hear the decree
read. History does not inform of any discussion with reference to it,
nor of any suffrages having been taken.

A few months after the close of these proceedings, Brother William de la
More, the Master of the Temple in England, died of a broken heart in his
solitary dungeon in the Tower, persisting with his last breath in the
maintenance of the innocence of his order. King Edward, in pity for his
misfortunes, directed the constable of the Tower to hand over his goods
and chattels, valued at the sum of 4*l*. 19*s*. 11*d*., to his
executors, to be employed in the liquidation of his debts, and he
commanded Geoffrey de la Lee, guardian of the lands of the Templars, to
pay the arrears of his prison pay (2*s*. per diem) to the executor,
Roger Hunsingon. <span id="fr_410"></span>[†](#fn_410.md)

Among the Cotton MS. is a list of the Masters of the Temple, otherwise
the Grand Priors or Grand Preceptors of England, compiled under the

</div>

The only other Templar in England whose fate merits particular attention
is Brother Himbert Blanke, the Grand Preceptor of Auvergne. He appears
to have been a knight of high honour

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1313.</span>and of stern unbending pride. From first to last he had
boldly protested against the violent proceedings of the inquisitors, and
had fearlessly maintained, amid all trials, his own innocence and that
of his order. This illustrious Templar had fought under four successive
Grand Masters in defence of the christian faith in Palestine, and after
the fall of Acre, had led in person several daring expeditions against
the infidels. For these meritorious services he was rewarded in the
following manner:--After having been tortured and half-starved in the
English prisons for the space of five years, he was condemned, as he
would make no confession of guilt, to be shut up in a loathsome dungeon,
to be loaded with double chains, and to be occasionally visited by the
agents of the inquisition, to see if he would confess *nothing
further!* <span id="fr_425"></span>[\*](#fn_425.md) In this miserable
situation he remained until death at last put an end to his sufferings.

James de Molay, the Grand Master of the Temple, Guy, the Grand
Preceptor, a nobleman of illustrious birth, brother to the prince of
Dauphiny, Hugh de Peralt, the Visitor-general of the Order, and the
Grand Preceptor of Aquitaine, had now languished in the prisons of
France for the space of five years and a half. The Grand Master had been
compelled to make a confession which he afterwards disowned and
stigmatized as a forgery, swearing that if the cardinals who had
subscribed it had been of a different cloth, he would have proclaimed
them liars, and would have challenged them to mortal combat. <span
id="fr_426"></span>[†](#fn_426.md) The other knights had also made
confessions which they had subsequently revoked. The secrets of the dark
prisons of these illustrious Templars have never been brought to light,
but on the 18th of

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1313.</span><span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
March, A.D. 1313, a public scaffold was erected before the cathedral
church of Notre Dame, at Paris, and the citizens were summoned to hear
the Order of the Temple convicted by the mouths of its chief officers,
of the sins and iniquities charged against it. The four knights, loaded
with chains and surrounded by guards, were then brought upon the
scaffold by the provost, and the bishop of Alba read their confessions
aloud in the presence of the assembled populace. The papal legate then,
turning towards the Grand Master and his companions, called upon them to
renew, in the hearing of the people, the avowals which they had
previously made of the guilt of their order. Hugh de Peralt, the
Visitor-General, and the Preceptor of the Temple of Aquitaine, signified
their assent to whatever was demanded of them, but the Grand Master
raising his arms bound with chains towards heaven, and advancing to the
edge of the scaffold, declared in a loud voice, that to say that which
was untrue was a crime, both in the sight of God and man. "I do," said
he, "confess my guilt, which consists in having, to my shame and
dishonour, suffered myself, through the pain of torture and the fear of
death, to give utterance to falsehoods, imputing scandalous sins and
iniquities to an illustrious order, which hath nobly served the cause of
Christianity. I disdain to seek a wretched and disgraceful existence by
engrafting another lie upon the original falsehood." He was here
interrupted by the provost and his officers, and Guy, the Grand
Preceptor, having commenced with strong asseverations of his innocence,
they were both hurried back to prison.

King Philip was no sooner informed of the result of this strange
proceeding, than, upon the first impulse of his indignation, without
consulting either pope, or bishop, or ecclesiastical council, he
commanded the instant execution of both these gallant noblemen. The same
day at dusk they were led out of their dungeons,

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

<span class="margnote">JAMES DE  
MOLAY  
A.D. 1313.</span>and were burned to death in a slow and lingering manner
upon small fires of charcoal which were kindled on the little island in
the Seine, between the king's garden and the convent of St. Augustine,
close to the spot where now stands the equestrian statue of Henri
IV. <span id="fr_427"></span>[\*](#fn_427.md)

Thus perished the last Grand Master of the Temple.

The fate of the persecutors of the order is not unworthy of notice.

A year and one month after the above horrible execution, the pope was
attacked by a dysentery, and speedily hurried to his grave. The dead
body was transported to Carpentras, where the court of Rome then
resided; it was placed at night in a church which caught fire, and the
mortal remains of the holy pontiff were almost entirely consumed. His
relations quarrelled over the immense treasures he left behind him, and
a vast sum of money, which had been deposited for safety in a church at
Lucca, was stolen by a daring band of German and Italian freebooters.

Before the close of the same year, king Philip died of a lingering
disease which baffled all the art of his medical attendants, and the
condemned criminal, upon the strength of whose information the Templars
were originally arrested, was hanged for fresh crimes. "History
attests," says Monsieur Raynouard, "that all those who were foremost in
the persecution of the Templars, came to an untimely and miserable
death." The last days of Philip were embittered by misfortune; his
nobles and clergy leagued against him to resist his exactions; the wives
of his three sons were accused of adultery, and two of them were
publicly convicted of that crime. The misfortunes of Edward the Second,

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

king of England, and his horrible death in Berkeley Castle, are too well
known to be further alluded to.

To save appearances, the pope had published a bull transferring the
property, late belonging to the Templars, to the order of the Hospital
of Saint John, <span id="fr_428"></span>[\*](#fn_428.md) which had just
then acquired additional renown and popularity in Europe by the conquest
from the infidels of the island of Rhodes. This bull, however, remained
for a considerable period nearly a dead letter, and the Hospitaliers
never obtained a twentieth part of the antient possessions of the
Templars.

The kings of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal, created new military orders
in their own dominions, to which the estates of the late order of the
Temple were transferred, and, annexing the Grand Masterships thereof to
their own persons, by the title of Perpetual Administrators, they
succeeded in drawing to themselves an immense revenue. <span
id="fr_429"></span>[†](#fn_429.md) The kings of Bohemia, Naples, and
Sicily, retained possession of many of the houses and strongholds of the
Templars in their dominions, and various religious orders of monks
succeeded in installing themselves in the convents of the fraternity.
The heirs of the donors of the property, moreover, claimed a title to it
by escheat, and in most cases where the Hospitaliers obtained the lands
and estates granted them by the pope, they had to pay large fines to
adverse claimants to be put into peaceable possession. <span
id="fr_430"></span>[‡](#fn_430.md)

"The chief cause of the ruin of the Templars," justly remarks Fuller,
"was their extraordinary wealth. As Naboth's vineyard was the chiefest
ground of his blasphemy, and as in England Sir John Cornwall Lord
Fanhope said merrily, not he, but his stately house at Ampthill in
Bedfordshire was guilty of high

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

treason, so certainly their wealth was the principal cause of their
overthrow. . . . We may believe that king Philip would never have taken
away their lives if he might have taken their lands without putting them
to death, but the mischief was, he could not get the honey unless he
burnt the bees." <span id="fr_431"></span>[\*](#fn_431.md)

King Philip, the pope, and the European sovereigns, appear to have
disposed of all the personalty of the Templars, the ornaments, jewels,
and treasure of their churches and chapels, and during the period of
five years, over which the proceedings against the order extended, they
remained in the actual receipt of the vast rents and revenues of the
fraternity. After the promulgation of the bull, assigning the property
of the Templars to the Hospitaliers, king Philip put forward a claim
upon the land to the extent of two hundred thousand pounds for the
expenses of the prosecution, and Louis Hutin, his son, required a
further sum of sixty thousand pounds from the Hospitaliers, before he
would consent to surrender the estates into their hands." <span
id="fr_432"></span>[†](#fn_432.md) "J’ignore," says Voltaire, "ce qui
revint au pape, mais je vois evidemment que les frais des cardinaux, des
inquisiteurs déléguès pour faire ce procès épouvantable monterent à des
sommés immenses." <span id="fr_433"></span>[‡](#fn_433.md) The holy
pontiff, according to his own account, received only a *small portion*
of the personalty of the order, <span id="fr_434"></span>[§](#fn_434.md)
but others make him a large participator in the good things of the
fraternity. <span id="fr_435"></span>[¦¦](#fn_435.md)

On the imprisonment of the Templars in England, the Temple at London,
and all the preceptories dependent upon it, with the manors, farms,
houses, lands, and revenues of the fraternity, were

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

placed under the survey of the Court of Exchequer, and extents <span
id="fr_436"></span>[\*](#fn_436.md) were directed to be taken of the same,
after which they were confided to the care of certain trustworthy
persons, styled "Guardians of the lands of the Templars," who were to
account for the rents and profits to the king's exchequer. The bishop of
Lichfield and Coventry had the custody of all the lands and tenements in
the county of Hants. John de Wilburgham had those in the counties of
Norfolk and Suffolk, and there were thirty-two other guardians entrusted
with the care of the property in the remaining counties of
England. <span id="fr_437"></span>[†](#fn_437.md) These guardians were
directed to pay various pensions to the old servants and retainers of
the Templars dwelling in the different preceptories, <span
id="fr_438"></span>[‡](#fn_438.md) also the expenses of the prosecution
against the order, and they were at different times required to provide
for the exigencies of the public service, and to victual the king's
castles and strongholds. On the 12th of January, A.D. 1312, William de
Slengesby, guardian of the manor of Ribbestayn in the county of York,
was commanded to forward to the constable of the castle of Knaresburgh a
hundred quarters of corn, ten quarters of oats, twenty fat oxen, eighty
sheep, and two strong carts, towards the victualling of the said
fortress, and the king tells him that the same shall be duly deducted
when he renders his account to the exchequer of the rents and profits of
the said manor. <span id="fr_439"></span>[§](#fn_439.md) The king, indeed,
began to dispose of the property as if it was wholly vested in the
crown, and made munificent donations to his favourites and friends. In
the month of February of the same year, he gave the manors of

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Etton and Cave to
David Earl of Athol, directing the guardians of the lands and tenements
of the Templars in the county of York to hand over to the said earl all
the corn in those manors, the oxen, calves, ploughs, and all the goods
and chattels of the Templars existing therein, together with the
ornaments and utensils of the chapel of the Temple. <span
id="fr_440"></span>[\*](#fn_440.md)

On the 16th of May, however, the pope addressed bulls to the king, and
to all the earls and barons of the kingdom, setting forth the
proceedings of the council of Vienne and the publication of the papal
decree, vesting the property late belonging to the Templars in the
brethren of the Hospital of St. John, and he commands them forthwith to
place the members of that order in possession thereof, Bulls were also
addressed to the archbishops of Canterbury and York and their
suffragans, commanding them to enforce by ecclesiastical censures the
execution of the papal commands. <span id="fr_441"></span>[†](#fn_441.md)
King Edward and his nobles very properly resisted this decree, and on
the 21st of August the king wrote to the Prior of the Hospital of St.
John at Clerkenwell, telling him that the pretensions of the pope to
dispose of property within the realm of England, without the consent of
parliament, were derogatory to the dignity of the crown and the royal
authority; and he commands him, under severe pains and penalties, to
refrain from attempting to obtain any portion of the possessions of the
Templars. <span id="fr_442"></span>[‡](#fn_442.md) The king, indeed,
continued to distribute the lands and rents amongst his friends and
favourites. At the commencement of the year 1313, he granted the Temple
at London, with the church and all the buildings therein, to Aymer de
Valence earl of Pembroke; <span id="fr_443"></span>[§](#fn_443.md) and on
the 5th of May of the same year he caused several merchants, from whom
he had borrowed money, to be placed in possession of many of the manors
of the Templars. <span id="fr_444"></span>[¦¦](#fn_444.md)

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

Yielding, however, at last to the exhortations and menaces of the pope,
the king, on the 21st of Nov. A.D. 1313, granted the property to the
Hospitallers, <span id="fr_445"></span>[\*](#fn_445.md) and sent orders to
all the guardians of the lands of the Templars, and to various powerful
barons who were in possession of the estates, commanding them to deliver
them up to certain parties deputed by the Grand Master and chapter of
the Hospital of Saint John to receive them. <span
id="fr_446"></span>[†](#fn_446.md) At this period, however, many of the
heirs of the donors, whose title had been recognized by the law, were in
possession of the lands, and the judges held that the king had no power
of his own sole authority to transfer them to the order of the
Hospital. <span id="fr_447"></span>[‡](#fn_447.md) The thunders of the
Vatican were consequently vigorously made use of, and all the detainers
of the property were doomed by the Roman pontiff to everlasting
damnation. <span id="fr_448"></span>[§](#fn_448.md) Pope John, in one of
his bulls, dated A.D. 1322, bitterly complains of the disregard by all
the king's subjects of the papal commands. He laments that they had
hardened their hearts and despised the sentence of excommunication
fulminated against them, and declares that his heart was riven with
grief to find that even the ecclesiastics, who ought to have been as a
wall of defence to the Hospitaliers, had themselves been heinously
guilty in the premises. <span id="fr_449"></span>[¦¦](#fn_449.md)

At last (A.D. 13.24) the pope, the bishops, and the Hospitallers, by
their united exertions, succeeded in obtaining an act of parliament,
vesting all the property late belonging to the Templars in the brethren
of the Hospital of Saint John, in order that the intentions of the
donors might be carried into effect by the appropriation of it to the
defence of the Holy Land and the

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

succour of the christian cause in the East. <span
id="fr_450"></span>[\*](#fn_450.md) This statute gave rise to the greatest
discontent. The heirs of the donors petitioned parliament for its
repeal, alleging that it had been made against law and against reason,
and contrary to the opinion of the judges; <span
id="fr_451"></span>[†](#fn_451.md) and many of the great barons who held
the property by a title recognised by the common law, successfully
resisted the claims of the order of the Hospital, maintaining that the
parliament had no right to interfere with the tenure of private
property, and to dispose of their possessions without their consent.

This struggle between the heirs of the donors on the one hand, and the
Hospitaliers on the other, continued for a lengthened period; and in the
reign of Edward the Third it was found necessary to pass another act of
parliament, confirming the previous statute in their favour, and writs
were sent to the sheriffs (A.D. 1334) commanding them to enforce the
execution of the acts of the legislature, and to take possession, in the
king's name, of all the property unjustly detained from the brethren of
the Hospital. <span id="fr_452"></span>[‡](#fn_452.md)

Whilst the vast possessions, late belonging to the Templars, thus
continued to be the subject of contention, the surviving brethren of
that dissolved order continued to be treated with the utmost inhumanity
and neglect. The ecclesiastical council had assigned to each of them a
pension of fourpence a day for subsistence, but this small pittance was
not paid, and they were consequently in great danger of dying of hunger.
The king, pitying their miserable situation, wrote to the prior of the
hospital of St. John at Clerkenwell, earnestly requesting him to take
their hard lot into .his serious consideration, and not suffer them to
come to beggary in the streets. <span id="fr_453"></span>[§](#fn_453.md)
The archbishop of Canterbury also

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

exerted himself in their behalf, and sent letters to the possessors of
the property, reproving them for the non-payment of the allotted
stipends. "This inhumanity," says he, "awakens our compassion, and
penetrates us with the most lively grief. We pray and conjure you in
kindness to furnish them, for the love of God and for charity, with the
means of subsistence." <span id="fr_454"></span>[\*](#fn_454.md) The
archbishop of York caused many of them to be supported in the different
monasteries of his diocese. <span id="fr_455"></span>[†](#fn_455.md)

Many of the quondam Templars, however, after the dissolution of their
order, assumed a secular habit; they blended themselves with the laity,
mixed in the pleasures of the world, and even presumed to contract
matrimony, proceedings which drew down upon them the severe indignation
of the Roman pontiff. In a bull addressed to the archbishop of
Canterbury, the pope stigmatises these marriages as unlawful
concubinages; he observes that the late Templars remained bound,
notwithstanding the dissolution of their order, by their vows of
perpetual chastity, and he orders them to be separated from the women
whom they had married, and to be placed in different monasteries, where
they are to dedicate themselves to the service of God, and the strict
performance of their religious vows. <span
id="fr_456"></span>[‡](#fn_456.md)

The Templars adopted the oriental fashion of long beards, and during the
proscription of the fraternity, when the fugitives who had thrown off
their habits were hunted out like wild beasts, it appears to have been
dangerous for laymen to possess beards of more than a few weeks’ growth.

Papers and certificates were granted to men with long beards, to prevent
them from being molested by the officers of justice as suspected
Templars, as appears from the following curious
[certificate](errata.htm#6.md) given by king Edward the Second to his
valet, who had

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

made a vow not to shave himself until he had performed a pilgrimage to a
certain place beyond sea.

"Rex, etc. Cum dilectus valettus noster Petrus Auger, exhibitor
præsentium, nuper voverit quod barbam suam radi non faciat, quousque
peregrinationem fecerit in certo loco in partibus transmarinis; et idem
Petrus sibi timeat, quod aliqui ipsum, ratione barbæ sum prolixæ fuisse
Templarium imponere sibi velint, et ei inferre impedimenta seu gravamina
ex hac causa; Nos veritati violentes testimonium pertulere, vobis tenore
præsentium intimamus, quod prædictus Petrus est valettus cameræ nostræ,
*nec unquam fuit Templarius, sed barbam suam sic prolixam esse
permittit, ex causa superius annotata*, etc. Teste Rege, &c." <span
