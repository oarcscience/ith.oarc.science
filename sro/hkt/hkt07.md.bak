</div>

THE Knights Templars first established the chief house of their order in
England, without Holborn Bars, on the south side of the street, where
Southampton House formerly stood, adjoining to which Southampton
Buildings were afterwards erected; <span
id="fr_101"></span>[\*](#fn_101.md) and it is stated, that about a century
and a half ago, part of the

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

ancient chapel annexed to this establishment, of a circular form, and
built of Caen stone, was discovered on pulling down some old houses near
Southampton Buildings in Chancery Lane. <span
id="fr_102"></span>[\*](#fn_102.md) This first house of the Temple,
established by Hugh de Payens himself, before his departure from
England, on his return to Palestine, was adapted to the wants and
necessities of the order in its infant state, when the knights, instead
of lingering in the preceptories of Europe, proceeded at once to
Palestine, and when all the resources of the society were strictly and
faithfully forwarded to Jerusalem, to be expended in defence of the
faith; but when the order had greatly increased in numbers, power, and
wealth, and had somewhat departed from its original purity and
simplicity, we find that the superior and the knights resident in London
began to look abroad for a more extensive and commodious place of
habitation. They purchased a large space of ground, extending from the
White Friars westward to Essex House without Temple Bar, <span
id="fr_103"></span>[†](#fn_103.md) and commenced the erection of a convent
on a scale of grandeur commensurate with the dignity and importance of
the chief house of the great religio-military society of the Temple in
Britain. It was called the *New* Temple, to distinguish it from the
original establishment at Holborn, which came thenceforth to be known by
the name of the *Old* Temple. <span id="fr_104"></span>[‡](#fn_104.md)

This New Temple was adapted for the residence of numerous military monks
and novices, serving brothers, retainers, and domestics. It contained
the residence of the superior and of the

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

knights, the cells and apartments of the chaplains and serving brethren,
the council chamber where the chapters were held, and the refectory or
dining-hall, which was connected, by a range of handsome cloisters, with
the magnificent church, consecrated by the patriarch. Alongside the
river extended a spacious pleasure ground for the recreation of the
brethren, who were not permitted to go into the town without the leave
of the Master. It was used also for military exercises and the training
of the horses.

The year of the consecration of the Temple Church, Geoffrey, the
superior of the order in England, caused an inquisition to be made of
the lands of the Templars in this country, and the names of the donors
thereof, <span id="fr_105"></span>[\*](#fn_105.md) from which it appears,
that the larger territorial divisions of the order were then called
bailiwicks, the principal of which were London, Warwic, Couele,
Meritune, Gutinge, Westune, Lincolnscire, Lindeseie, Widine, and
Eboracisire, (Yorkshire.) The number of manors, farms, churches,
advowsons, demesne lands, villages, hamlets, windmills, and watermills,
rents of assize, rights of common and free warren, and the amount of all
kinds of property, possessed by the Templars in England at the period of
the taking of this inquisition, are astonishing. Upon the great estates
belonging to the order, prioral houses had been erected, wherein dwelt
the procurators or stewards charged with the management of the manors
and farms in their neighbourhood, and with the collection of the rents.
These prioral houses became regular monastic establishments, inhabited
chiefly by sick and aged Templars, who retired to them to spend

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

the remainder of their days, after a long period of honourable service
against the infidels in Palestine. They were cells to the principal
house at London. There were also under them certain smaller
administrations established for the management of the farms, consisting
of a Knight Templar, to whom were associated some serving brothers of
the order, and a priest who acted as almoner. The commissions or
mandates directed by the Masters of the Temple to the officers at the
head of these establishments, were called precepts, from the
commencement of them, "*Præcipimus tibi*," we enjoin or direct you, &c.
&c. The knights to whom they were addressed were styled *Præceptores
Templi*, or Preceptors of the Temple, and the districts administered by
them *Præceptoria*, or preceptories.

It will now be as well to take a general survey of the possessions and
organization of the order both in Europe and Asia, "whose
circumstances," saith William archbishop of Tyre, writing from Jerusalem
about the period of the consecration at London of the Temple Church,
"are in so flourishing a state, that at this day they have in their
convent (the Temple on Mount Moriah) more than three hundred knights
robed in the white habit, besides serving brothers innumerable. Their
possessions indeed beyond sea, as well as in these parts, are said to be
so vast, that there cannot now be a province in Christendom which does
not contribute to the support of the aforesaid brethren, whose wealth is
said to equal that of sovereign princes." <span
id="fr_106"></span>[\*](#fn_106.md)

The eastern provinces of the order were, 1. Palestine, the ruling
province. 2. The principality of Antioch. 3. The principality of
Tripoli.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

1\. PALESTINE.--Some account has already been given of the Temple at
Jerusalem, the chief house of the order, and the residence of the
Master. In addition to the strong garrison there maintained, the
Templars possessed numerous forces, distributed in various fortresses
and strongholds, for the preservation and protection of the holy
territory.

The following castles and cities of Palestine are enumerated by the
historians of the Latin kingdom, as having belonged to the order of the
Temple.

The fortified city of Gaza, the key of the kingdom of Jerusalem on the
side next Egypt, anciently one of the five satrapies of the Lords of the
Philistines, and the stronghold of Cambyses when he invaded Egypt.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Placed where Judea's utmost bounds extend,  
Towards fair Pelusium, Gaza's towers ascend.  
Fast by the breezy shore the city stands  
Amid unbounded plains of barren sands,  
Which high in air the furious whirlwinds sweep,  
Like mountain billows on the stormy deep,  
That scarce the affrighted traveller, spent with toil,  
Escapes the tempest of the unstable soil."</span>

</div>

It was granted to the Templars, in perpetual sovereignty, by Baldwin
king of Jerusalem. <span id="fr_107"></span>[\*](#fn_107.md)

The Castle of Saphet, in the territory of the ancient tribe of Naphtali;
the great bulwark of the northern frontier of the Latin kingdom on the
side next Damascus. The Castle of the Pilgrims, in the neighbourhood of
Mount Carmel. The Castle of Assur near Jaffa, and the House of the
Temple at Jaffa. The fortress of Faba, or La Feue, the ancient Aphek,
not far from

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tyre, in the
territory of the ancient tribe of Asher. The hill-fort Dok, between
Bethel and Jericho. The castles of La Cave, Marie, Citern Rouge, Castel
Blanc, Trapesach, Sommelleria of the Temple, in the neighbourhood of
Acca, now St. John d’Acre. Castrum Planorum, and a place called Gerinum
Parvum. <span id="fr_108"></span>[\*](#fn_108.md) The Templars purchased
the castle of Beaufort and the city of Sidon; <span
id="fr_109"></span>[†](#fn_109.md) they also got into their hands a great
part of the town of St. Jean d’Acre, where they erected their famous
temple, and almost all Palestine was in the end divided between them and
the Hospitallers of Saint John.

2\. THE PRINCIPALITY OF ANTIOCH.--The principal houses of the Temple in
this province were at Antioch itself, at Aleppo, Haram, &c.

3\. THE PRINCIPALITY OF TRIPOLI.--The chief establishments herein were
at Tripoli, at Tortosa, the ancient Antaradus; Castel-blanc in the same
neighbourhood; Laodicea and Beyrout,--all under the immediate
superintendence of the Preceptor of Tripoli. Besides these castles,
houses, and fortresses, the Templars possessed farms and large tracts of
land, both in Syria and Palestine.

The western nations or provinces, on the other hand, from whence the
order derived its chief power and wealth, were,

1\. APULIA AND SICILY, the principal houses whereof were at Palermo,
Syracuse, Lentini, Butera, and Trapani. The house of the Temple at this
last place has been appropriated to the use of some monks of the order
of St. Augustin. In a church of the city is still to be seen the
celebrated statue of the Virgin, which Brother Guerrege and three other
Knights Templars brought

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

from the East, with a view of placing it in the Temple Church on the
Aventine hill in Rome, but which they were obliged to deposit in the
island of Sicily. This celebrated statue is of the most beautiful white
marble, and represents the Virgin with the infant Jesus reclining on her
left arm; it is of about the natural height, and, from an inscription on
the foot of the figure, it appears to have been executed by a native of
the island of Cyprus, A.D. 733. <span id="fr_110"></span>[\*](#fn_110.md)

The Templars possessed valuable estates in Sicily, around the base of
Mount Etna, and large tracts of land between Piazza and Calatagirone, in
the suburbs of which last place there was a Temple house, the church
whereof, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, still remains. They possessed
also many churches in the island, windmills, rights of fishery, of
pasturage, of cutting wood in the forests, and many important privileges
and immunities. The chief house was at Messina, where the Grand Prior
resided. <span id="fr_111"></span>[†](#fn_111.md)

2\. UPPER AND CENTRAL ITALY.--The houses or preceptories of the order of
the Temple in this province were very numerous, and were all under the
immediate superintendence of the Grand Prior or Preceptor of Rome. There
were large establishments at Lucca, Milan, and Perugia, at which last
place the arms of the Temple are still to be seen on the tower of the
holy cross. At Placentia there was a magnificent and extensive convent,
called Santa Maria del Tempio, ornamented with a very lofty tower. At
Bologna there was also a large Temple house, and on a clock in the city
is the following inscription, "*Magister Tosseolus de Miolâ me fecit . .
. Fr. Petrus de Bon, Procur. Militiæ Templi in curiâ Romanâ*, MCCCIII."
In the church of St. Mary in the same place, which formerly belonged to
the Knights Templars,

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

is the interesting marble monument of Peter de Rotis, a priest of the
order. He is represented on his tomb, holding a chalice in his hands
with the host elevated above it, and beneath the monumental effigy is
the following epitaph

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">Stirpe Rotis, Petrus, virtutis munere clarus,  
Strennus ecce pugil Christi, jacet ordine charus;  
Veste ferens, menteque crucem, nunc sidera scandit,  
Exemplum nobis spectandi cælica pandit:  
Annis ter trinis viginti mille trecentis  
Sexta quarte maii fregit lux organ mentis." <span
id="fr_112"></span>[\*](#fn_112.md)</span>

</div>

PORTUGAL.--In the province or nation of Portugal, the military power and
resources of the order of the Temple were exercised in almost constant
warfare against the Moors, and Europe derived essential advantage from
the enthusiastic exertions of the warlike monks in that quarter against
the infidels. In every battle, indeed, fought in the south of Europe,
after the year 1130, against the enemies of the cross, the Knights
Templars are to be found taking an active and distinguished part, and in
all the conflicts against the infidels, both in the west and in the
east, they were ever in the foremost rank, battling nobly in defence of
the christian faith. With all the princes and sovereigns of the great
Spanish peninsula they were extremely popular, and they were endowed
with cities, villages, lordships, and splendid domains. Many of the most
important fortresses and castles in the land were entrusted to their
safe keeping, and some were yielded to them in perpetual sovereignty.
They possessed, in Portugal, the castles of Monsento, Idanha, and Tomar;
the citadel of Langrovia in the province of Beira, on the banks of the
Riopisco; and the fortress of Miravel in Estremadura, taken from the
Moors, a strong place perched on the summit of a lofty eminence.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They had large
estates at Castromarin, Almural, and Tavira in Algarve, and houses,
rents, revenues, and possessions, in all parts of the country. The Grand
Prior or Preceptor of Portugal resided at the castle of Tomar. It is
seated on the river Narboan in Estremadura, and is still to be seen
towering in gloomy magnificence on the hill above the town. The castle
at present belongs to the order of Christ, and was lately one of the
grandest and richest establishments in Portugal. It possessed a splendid
library, and a handsome cloister, the architecture of which was much
admired. <span id="fr_113"></span>[\*](#fn_113.md)

CASTILE AND LEON. The houses or preceptories of the Temple most known in
this province or nation of the order were those of Cuenca and
Guadalfagiara, Tine and Aviles in the diocese of Oviedo, and Pontevreda
in Galicia. In Castile alone the order is said to have possessed
twenty-four bailiwicks. <span id="fr_114"></span>[†](#fn_114.md)

ARAGON.--The sovereigns of Aragon, who had suffered grievously from the
incursions of the Moors, were the first of the European princes to
recognize the utility of the order of the Temple. They endowed the
fraternity with vast revenues, and ceded to them some of the strongest
fortresses in the kingdom. The Knights Templars possessed in Aragon the
castles of Dumbel, Cabanos, Azuda, Granena, Chalonere, Remolins,
Corbins, Lo Mas de Barbaran, Moncon, and Montgausi, with their
territories and dependencies. They were lords of the cities of Borgia
and Tortosa; they had a tenth part of the revenues of the kingdom, the
taxes of the towns of Huesca and Saragossa, and houses, possessions,
privileges, and immunities in all parts. <span
id="fr_115"></span>[‡](#fn_115.md)

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

The Templars likewise possessed lands and estates in the Balearic Isles,
which were under the management of the Prior or Preceptor of the island
of Majorca, who was subject to the Grand Preceptor of Aragon.

GERMANY AND HUNGARY.--The houses most known in this territorial division
of the order are those in the electorate of Mayence, at Homburg,
Assenheim, Rotgen in the Rhingau, Mongberg in the Marché of
Brandenbourg, Nuitz on the Rhine, Tissia Altmunmunster near Ratisbon in
Bavaria, Bamberg, Middlebourg, Hall, Brunswick, &c. &c. The Templars
possessed the fiefs of Rorich, Pausin and Wildenheuh in *Pomerania*, an
establishment at Bach in *Hungary*, several lordships in *Bohemia* and
*Moravia*, and lands, tithes, and large revenues, the gifts of pious
German crusaders. <span id="fr_116"></span>[\*](#fn_116.md)

GREECE.--The Templars were possessed of lands and had establishments in
the Morea, and in several parts of the Greek empire. Their chief house
was at Constantinople, in the quarter called Ὀμόνοια, where they had an
oratory dedicated to the holy martyrs Marin and Pentaleon. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[†](#fn_117.md)

FRANCE.--The principal preceptories and houses of the Temple, in the
present kingdom of France, were at Besancon, Dole, Salins, à la Romagne,
à la ville Dieu, Arbois in *Franche Comté*. <span
id="fr_118"></span>[‡](#fn_118.md)

Bomgarten, Temple Savigné near Corbeil, Dorlesheim near Molsheim, where
there still remains a chapel called Templehoff, Ribauvillier, and a
Temple house in the plain near Bercheim in Alsace.

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

Bures, Voulaine les Templiers, Ville-sous-Gevrey, otherwise St.
Philibert, Dijon, Fauverney, where a chapel dedicated to the Virgin
still preserves the name of the Temple, Des Feuilles, situate in the
parish of Villett, near the chateau de Vernay, St. Martin, Le Chastel,
Espesses, Tessones near Bourges, and La Musse, situate between Baujé and
Macon in *Burgundy*. <span id="fr_119"></span>[\*](#fn_119.md)

Montpelier, Sertelage, Nogarade near Pamiers, Falgairas, Narbonne St.
Eulalie de Bezieres, Prugnanas, and the parish church of St. Martin
d’Ubertas in *Languedoc*. <span id="fr_120"></span>[†](#fn_120.md)

Temple Cahor, Temple Marigny, Arras, Le Parc, St. Vaubourg, and Rouen,
in *Normandy*. There were two houses of the Temple at Rouen; one of them
occupied the site of the present *maison consulaire*, and the other
stood in the street now called *La Rue des Hermites*. <span
id="fr_121"></span>[‡](#fn_121.md) The preceptories and houses of the
Temple in France, indeed, were so numerous, that it would be a wearisome
and endless task to repeat the names of them. Hundreds of places in the
different provinces are mentioned by French writers as having belonged
to the Templars. Between Joinville and St. Dizier may still be seen the
remains of Temple Ruet, an old chateau surrounded by a moat; and in the
diocese of Meaux are the ruins of the great manorial house of Choisy le
Temple. Many interesting tombs are there visible, together with the
refectory of the knights, which has been converted into a sheepfold.

The chief house of the order for France, and also for Holland and the
Netherlands, was the Temple at Paris, an extensive and

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

magnificent structure, surrounded by a wall and a ditch. It extended
over all that large space of ground, now covered with streets and
buildings, which lies between the rue du Temple, the rue St. Croix, and
the environs de la Verrerie, as far as the walls and the fossés of the
port du Temple. It was ornamented with a great tower, flanked by four
smaller towers, erected by the Knight Templar Brother Herbert, almoner
to the king of France, and was one of the strongest edifices in the
kingdom. <span id="fr_122"></span>[\*](#fn_122.md) Many of the modern
streets of Paris which now traverse the site of this interesting
structure, preserve in the names given to them some memorial of the
ancient Temple. For instance, *La rue du Temple, La rue des fossés du
Temple, Boulevard du Temple, Faubourg du Temple, rue de Faubourg du
Temple, Vieille rue du Temple*, &c. &c.

All the houses of the Temple in Holland and the Netherlands were under
the immediate jurisdiction of the Master of the Temple at Paris. The
preceptories in these kingdoms were very numerous, and the property
dependent upon them was of great value. Those most known are the
preceptories of Treves and Dietrich on the Soure, the ruins of which
last still remain; Coberne, on the left bank of the Moselle, a few miles
from Coblentz; Belisch, Temple Spelé, Temple Rodt near Vianden, and the
Temple at Luxembourg, where in the time of Broverus there existed
considerable remains of the refectory, of the church, and of some stone
walls covered with paintings; Templehuis near Ghent, the preceptory of
Alphen, Braëckel, la maison de Slipes near Ostend, founded by the counts
of Flanders; Temple Caestre near Mount Cassel; Villiers le Temple en
Condros, between Liege and Huy; Vaillenpont, Walsberge, Haut Avenes near
Arras; Temploux near Fleuru in the department of Namur; Vernoi in

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hainault; Temple
Dieu at Douai; Maries near Valenciennes; St. Symphonier near Mons, &c.
&c. <span id="fr_123"></span>[\*](#fn_123.md)

In these countries, as well as in all parts of Europe wherever they were
settled, the Templars possessed vast privileges and immunities, which
were conceded to them by popes, kings, and princes.

Temple, and about forty windmills. The order likewise received rents in
respect of lands at Bracebrig, Brancetone, Scapwic, Timberland,
Weleburne, Diringhton, and a hundred other places; and some of the land
in the county was charged with the annual payment of sums of money
towards the keeping of the lights eternally burning on the altars of the
Temple church. <span id="fr_129"></span>[‡](#fn_129.md) William Lord of
Asheby gave to the Templars the perpetual advowson of the church of

*Worcestershire*, the manor of Templars Lawern, and lands in Flavel,
Temple Broughton, and Hanbury. <span id="fr_135"></span>[\*](#fn_135.md) In
*Northamptonshire*, the manors of Asheby, Thorp, Watervill, &c. &c.;
they had the advowson of the church of the manor of Hardwicke in
Orlington hundred, and we find that "Robert Saunford, Master of the
soldiery of the Temple in England," presented to it in the year
1238. <span id="fr_136"></span>[†](#fn_136.md) In *Nottinghamshire*, the
Templars possessed the church of Marnham, lands and rents at Gretton and
North Carleton; in *Westmoreland*, the manor of Temple Sowerby; in the
Isle of Wight, the manor of Uggeton, and lands in Kerne. <span
id="fr_137"></span>[‡](#fn_137.md) But it would be tedious further to
continue with a dry detail of ancient names and places; sufficient has
been said to give an idea of the enormous wealth of the order in this
country, where it is known to have possessed some hundreds of manors,
the advowson or right of presentation to churches innumerable, and
thousands of acres of arable land, pasture, and woodland, besides
villages, farm-houses, mills, and tithes, rights of common, of fishing,
of cutting wood in forests, &c. &c.

There were also several preceptories in Scotland and Ireland, which were
dependent on the Temple at London.

The annual income of the order in Europe has been roughly estimated at
six millions sterling! According to Matthew Paris,

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

the Templars possessed *nine thousand* manors or lordships in
Christendom, besides a large revenue and immense riches arising from the
constant charitable bequests and donations of sums of money from pious
persons. <span id="fr_138"></span>[\*](#fn_138.md) "They were also
endowed," says James of Vitry, bishop of Acre, "with farms, towns, and
villages, to an immense extent both in the East and in the West, out of
the revenues of which they send yearly a certain sum of money for the
defence of the Holy Land to their head Master at the chief house of
their order in Jerusalem." <span id="fr_139"></span>[†](#fn_139.md) The
Templars, in imitation of the other monastic establishments, obtained
from pious and charitable people all the advowsons within their reach,
and frequently retained the tithe and the glebe in their own hands,
deputing a priest of the order to perform divine service and administer
the sacraments.

The manors of the Templars produced them rent either in money, corn, or
cattle, and the usual produce of the soil. By the custom in some of
these manors, the tenants were annually to mow three days in harvest,
one at the charge of the house; and to plough three days, whereof one at
the like charge; to reap one day, at which time they should have a ram
from the house, eight-pence, twenty-four loaves, and a cheese of the
best in the house, together with a pailful of drink. The tenants were
not to sell, their horse-colts, if they were foaled upon the land
belonging to the Templars, without the consent of the fraternity, nor
marry their daughters without their license. There were also various

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

regulations concerning the cocks and hens and young chickens. <span
id="fr_140"></span>[\*](#fn_140.md)

We have previously given an account of the royal donations of King Henry
the First, of King Stephen and his queen, to the order of the Temple.
These were far surpassed by the pious benefactions of King Henry the
Second. That monarch, for the good of his soul and the welfare of his
kingdom, granted the Templars a place situate on the river Fleet, near
Bainard's Castle, with the whole current of that river at London, for
erecting a mill; <span id="fr_141"></span>[†](#fn_141.md) also a messuage
near Fleet-street; the church of St. Clement, "quæ dicitur Dacorum extra
civitatem Londoniæ;" and the churches of Elle, Swinderby and Skarle in
Lincolnshire, Kingeswode juxta Waltham in Kent, the manor of Stroder in
the hundred of Skamele, the vill of Kele in Staffordshire, the hermitage
of Flikeamstede, and all his lands at Lange Cureway, a house in Brosal,
and the market of Witham; lands at Berghotte, a mill at the bridge of
Pembroke Castle, the vill of Finchingfelde, the manor of Rotheley with
its appurtenances, and the advowson of the church and its several
chapels, the manor of Blalcolvesley, the park of Haleshall, and three
*fat bucks* annually, either from Essex or Windsor Forest. He likewise
granted them an annual

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

fair at Temple Bruere, and superadded many rich benefactions in
Ireland. <span id="fr_142"></span>[\*](#fn_142.md)

The principal benefactors to the Templars amongst the nobility were
William Marshall, earl of Pembroke, and his sons William and Gilbert;
Robert, lord de Ros; the earl of Hereford; William, earl of Devon; the
king of Scotland; William, archbishop of York; Philip Harcourt, dean of
Lincoln; the earl of Cornwall; Philip, bishop of Bayeux; Simon de
Senlis, earl of Northampton; Leticia and William, count and countess of
Ferrara; Margaret, countess of Warwick; Simon de Montfort, earl of
Leicester; Robert de Harecourt, lord of Rosewarden; William de Vernon,
earl of Devon, &c. &c. <span id="fr_143"></span>[†](#fn_143.md)

The Templars, in addition to their amazing wealth, enjoyed vast
privileges and immunities within this realm. In the reign of King John
they were freed from all amerciaments in the Exchequer, and obtained the
privilege of not being compelled to plead except before the king or his
chief justice. King Henry the Third granted them free warren in all
their demesne lands; and by his famous charter, dated the 9th of
February, in the eleventh year of his reign, he confirmed to them all
the donations of his predecessors and of their other benefactors; with
soc <span id="fr_144"></span>[‡](#fn_144.md) and sac <span
id="fr_145"></span>[§](#fn_145.md), tol <span
id="fr_146"></span>[¦¦](#fn_146.md) and theam, <span

id="fr_148"></span>[\*\*](#fn_148.md) and unfangenethef, <span
id="fr_149"></span>[††](#fn_149.md) and hamsoca, and grithbrich, and
blodwite, and flictwite, and hengewite, and learwite, and flemenefrith,
murder, robbery, forestal, ordel, and oreste; and he acquitted them from
the royal and

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

sheriff's aids, and from hidage, carucage, danegeld and hornegeld, and
from military and wapentake services, scutages, tallages, lastages,
stallages, from shires and hundreds, pleas and quarrels, from ward and
wardpeny, and averpeni, and hundredespeni, and borethalpeni, and
thethingepeni, and from the works of parks, castles, bridges, the
building of royal houses and all other works; and also from waste regard
and view of foresters, and from toll in all markets and fairs, and at
all bridges, and upon all highways throughout the kingdom. And he also
gave them the chattels of felons and fugitives, and all waifs within
their fee. <span id="fr_150"></span>[\*](#fn_150.md)

In addition to these particular privileges, the Templars enjoyed, under
the authority of the Papal bulls, various immunities and advantages,
which gave great umbrage to the clergy. They were freed, as before
mentioned, from the obligation of paying tithes, and might, with the
consent of the bishop, receive them. No brother of the Temple could be
excommunicated by any bishop or priest, nor could any of the churches of
the order be laid under interdict except by virtue of a special mandate
from the holy see. When any brother of the Temple, appointed to make
charitable collections for the succour of the Holy Land, should arrive
at a city, castle, or village, which had been laid under interdict, the
churches, on their welcome coming, were to be thrown open, (once within
the year,) and divine service was to be performed in honour of the
Temple, and in reverence for the holy soldiers thereof. The privilege of
sanctuary was thrown around their dwellings; and by various papal bulls
it is solemnly enjoined that no person shall lay violent hands either
upon the persons or the property of those flying for refuge to the
Temple houses. <span id="fr_151"></span>[†](#fn_151.md)

Sir Edward Coke, in the second part of the Institute of the Laws of
England, observes, that "the Templars did so overspread

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

throughout Christendome, and so exceedingly increased in possessions,
revenues, and wealth, and specially in England, as you will wonder to
reade in approved histories, and withall obtained so great and large
priviledges, liberties, and immunities for themselves, their tenants,
and farmers, &c., as no other order had the like." <span
id="fr_152"></span>[\*](#fn_152.md) He further observes, that the Knights
Templars were *cruce signati*, and as the cross was the ensign of their
profession, and their tenants enjoyed great privileges, they did erect
crosses upon their houses, to the end that those inhabiting them might
be known to be the tenants of the order, and thereby be freed from many
duties and services which other tenants were subject unto; "and many
tenants of other lords, perceiving the state and greatnesse of the
knights of the said order, and withall seeing the great priviledges
their tenants enjoyed, did set up crosses upon their houses, as their
very tenants used to doe, to the prejudice of their lords."

This abuse led to the passing of the statute of Westminster, the second,
*chap*. 33, <span id="fr_153"></span>[†](#fn_153.md) which recites, that
many tenants did set up crosses or cause them to be set up on their
lands in prejudice of their lords, that the tenants might defend
themselves against the chief lord of the fee by the privileges of
Templars and Hospitallers, and enacts that such lands should be
forfeited to the chief lords or tò the king.

Sir Edward Coke observes, that the Templars were freed from tenths and
fifteenths to be paid to the king; that they were discharged of
purveyance; that they could not be sued for any ecclesiastical cause
before the ordinary, *sed coram conservatoribus suorum privilegiorum;*
and that of ancient time they claimed that a felon might take to their
houses, having their crosses for his safety, as well as to any
church. <span id="fr_154"></span>[‡](#fn_154.md) And concerning these
conservers or keepers of their privileges, he remarks, that the Templars
and Hospitaliers "held an ecclesiasticall court before a

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

canonist, whom they termed *conservator privilegiorum suorum*, which
judge had indeed more authority than was convenient, and did dayly, in
respect of the height of these two orders, and at their instance and
direction, incroach upon and hold plea of matters determinable by the
common law, for *cui plus licet quam par est, plus vult quam licet;* and
this was one great mischiefe. Another mischiefe was, that this judge,
likewise at their instance, in cases wherein he had jurisdiction, would
make general citations as pro salute anima, and the like, without
expressing the matter whereupon the citation was made, which also was
against law, and tended to the grievous vexation of the subject." <span
id="fr_155"></span>[\*](#fn_155.md) To remedy these evils, another act of
parliament was passed, prohibiting Hospitaliers and Templars from
bringing any man in plea before the keepers of their privileges, for any
matter the knowledge whereof belonged to the king's court, and
commanding such keepers of their privileges thenceforth to grant no
citations at the instance of Hospitaliers and Templars, before it be
expressed upon what matter the citation ought to be made. <span
id="fr_156"></span>[†](#fn_156.md)

Having given an outline of the great territorial possessions of the
order of the Temple in Europe, it now remains for us to present a sketch
of its organisation and government. The Master of the Temple, the chief
of the entire fraternity, ranked as a sovereign prince, and had
precedence of all ambassadors and peers in the general councils of the
church. He was elected to his high office by the chapter of the kingdom
of Jerusalem, which was composed of all the knights of the East and of
the West who could manage to attend. The Master had his general and
particular chapters. The first were composed of the Grand Priors of the
eastern and western provinces, and of all the knights present in the
holy territory. The assembling of these general chapters,

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

however, in the distant land of Palestine, was a useless and almost
impracticable undertaking, and it is only on the journeys of the Master
to Europe, that we hear of the convocation of the Grand Priors of the
West to attend upon their chief. The general chapters called together by
the Master in Europe were held at Paris, and the Grand Prior of England
always received a summons to attend. The ordinary business and the
government of the fraternity in secular matters were conducted by the
Master with the assistance of his particular chapter of the Latin
kingdom, which was composed of such of the Grand Priors and chief
dignitaries of the Temple as happened to be present in the East, and
such of the knights as were deemed the wisest and most fit to give
counsel. In these last chapters visitors-general were appointed to
examine into the administration of the western provinces.

The western nations or provinces of the order were presided over by the
provincial Masters, <span id="fr_157"></span>[\*](#fn_157.md) otherwise
Grand Priors or Grand Preceptors, who were originally appointed by the
chief Master at Jerusalem, and were in theory mere trustees or bare
administrators of the revenues of the fraternity, accountable to the
treasurer general at Jerusalem, and removeable at the pleasure of the
Chief Master. As the numbers, possessions, and wealth of the Templars,
however, increased, various abuses sprang up. The members of the order,
after their admittance to the vows, very frequently, instead of
proceeding direct to Palestine to war [against](errata.htm#2.md) the
infidels, settled down upon their property in Europe, and consumed at
home a large proportion of those revenues which ought to have been
faithfully and strictly forwarded to the general treasury at the Holy
City. They erected numerous

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

convents or preceptories, with churches and chapels, and raised up in
each western province a framework of government similar to that of the
ruling province of Palestine.

The chief house of the Temple in England, for example, after its removal
from Holborn Bars to the banks of the Thames, was regulated and
organised after the model of the house of the Temple at Jerusalem. The
superior is always styled "Master of the Temple," and holds his chapters
and has his officers corresponding to those of the chief Master in
Palestine. The latter, consequently, came to be denominated *Magnus
Magister*, or Grand Master, <span id="fr_158"></span>[\*](#fn_158.md) by
our English writers, to distinguish him from the Master at London, and
henceforth he will be described by that title to prevent confusion. The
titles given indeed to the superiors of the different nations or
provinces into which the order of the Temple was divided, are numerous
and somewhat perplexing. In the East, these officers were known only, in
the first instance, by the title of Prior, as Prior of England, Prior of
France, Prior of Portugal, &c., and afterwards Preceptor of England,
preceptor of France, &c.; but in Europe they were called Grand Priors
and Grand Preceptors, to distinguish them from the Sub-priors and
Sub-preceptors, and also Masters of the Temple. The Prior and Preceptor
*of* England, therefore, and the Grand Prior, Grand Preceptor, and
Master of the Temple *in* England, were one and the same person. There
were also at the New Temple at London, in imitation of the establishment
at the chief house in Palestine, in addition to the Master, the
Preceptor of the Temple, the Prior of London, the Treasurer, and the
Guardian of the church, who had three chaplains under him, called
readers. <span id="fr_159"></span>[†](#fn_159.md)

The Master at London had his general and particular, or his

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

ordinary and extraordinary chapters. The first were composed of the
grand preceptors of Scotland and Ireland, and all the provincial priors
and preceptors of the three kingdoms, who were summoned once a year to
deliberate on the state of the Holy Land, to forward succour, to give an
account of their stewardship, and to frame new rules and regulations for
the management of the temporalities. <span
id="fr_160"></span>[\*](#fn_160.md) The ordinary chapters were held at the
different preceptories, which the Master of the Temple visited in
succession. In these chapters new members were admitted into the order;
lands were bought, sold, and exchanged; and presentations were made by
the Master to vacant benefices. Many of the grants and other deeds of
these chapters, with the seal of the order of the Temple annexed to
them, are to be met with in the public and private collections of
manuscripts in this country. One of the most interesting and best
preserved, is the Harleian charter (83, c. 39,) in the British Museum,
which is a grant of land made by Brother William de la More, the martyr,
the last Master of the Temple in England, to the Lord Milo de Stapleton.
It is expressed to be made by him, with the common consent and advice of
his chapter, held at the Preceptory of Dynneslee, on the feast of Saint
Barnabas the Apostle, and concludes, "In witness whereof, we have to
this present indenture placed the seal of our chapter." <span
id="fr_161"></span>[†](#fn_161.md) A fac-simile of this seal is given
above. On the reverse of it is a man's head, decorated with a long
beard, and surmounted by a small cap, and around it are the letters
TESTISVMAGI. The same seal is to be met with on various other indentures
made by the Master and Chapter of the Temple. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[‡](#fn_162.md) The more early seals are surrounded with
the

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

words, Sigillum *Militis* Templi, "Seal of the Knight of the Temple;" as
in the case of the deed of exchange of lands at Normanton in the parish
of Botisford, in Leicestershire, entered into between Brother Amadeus de
Morestello, Master of the chivalry of the Temple in England, and his
chapter, of the one part, and the Lord Henry de Colevile, Knight, of the
other part. The seal annexed to this deed has the addition of the word
Militis, but in other respects it is similar to the one above
delineated. <span id="fr_163"></span>[\*](#fn_163.md)

The Master of the Temple was controlled by the visitors-general of the
order, <span id="fr_164"></span>[†](#fn_164.md) who were knights specially
deputed by the Grand Master and convent of Jerusalem to visit the
different provinces, to reform abuses, make new regulations, and
terminate such disputes as were usually reserved for the decision of the
Grand Master. These visitors-general sometimes removed knights from
their preceptories, and even suspended the masters themselves, and it
was their duty to expedite to the East all such knights as were young
and vigorous, and capable of fighting. Two regular voyages were
undertaken from Europe to Palestine in the course of the year, under the
conduct of the Templars and Hospitaliers, called the *passagium Martis*,
and the *passagium Sancti Johannis*, which took place respectively in
the spring and summer, when the newly-admitted knights left the
preceptories of the West, taking with them hired foot soldiers, armed
pilgrims, and large sums of money, the produce of the European
possessions of the fraternity, by which means a continual succour was
afforded to the christian kingdom of Jerusalem. One of the grand priors
or grand preceptors generally took the command of these expeditions, and
was frequently accompanied by many valiant secular

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

knights, who craved permission to join his standard, and paid large sums
of money for a passage to the far East. In the interval between these
different voyages, the young knights were diligently employed at the
different preceptories in the religious and military exercises necessary
to fit them for their high vocation.

On any sudden emergency, or when the ranks of the order had been greatly
thinned by the casualties of war, the Grand Master sent circular letters
to the grand preceptors or masters of the western provinces, requiring
instant aid and assistance, on the receipt of which collections were
made in the churches, and all the knights that could be spared forthwith
embarked for the Holy Land.

The Master of the Temple in England sat in parliament as first baron of
the realm, (*primus baro Angliæ*) but that is to be understood among
priors only. To the parliament holden in the twenty-ninth year of King
Henry the Third, there were summoned sixty-five abbots, thirty-five
priors, and the Master of the Temple. <span
id="fr_165"></span>[\*](#fn_165.md) The oath taken by the grand priors,
grand preceptors, or provincial Masters in Europe, on their assumption
of the duties of their high administrative office, was drawn up in the
following terms:--

"I, *A. B.*, Knight of the Order of the Temple, just now appointed
Master of the knights who are in ------, promise to Jesus Christ my
Saviour, and to his vicar the sovereign pontiff and his successors,
perpetual obedience and fidelity. I swear that I will defend, not only
with my lips, but by force of arms and with all my strength, the
mysteries of the faith; the seven sacraments, the fourteen articles of
the faith, the creed of the Apostles, and that of Saint Athanasius; the
books of the Old and the New Testament, with the commentaries of the
holy fathers, as received by the church; the unity of God, the plurality

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

of the persons of the holy Trinity; that Mary, the daughter of Joachim
and Anna, of the tribe of Judah, and of the race of David, remained
always a virgin before her delivery, during and after her delivery. I
promise likewise to be submissive and obedient to the Master-general of
the order, in conformity with the statutes prescribed by our father
Saint Bernard; that I will at all times in case of need pass the seas to
go and fight; that I will always afford succour against the infidel
kings and princes; that in the presence of three enemies I will fly not,
but cope with them, if they are infidels; that I will not sell the
property of the order, nor consent that it be sold or alienated; that I
will always preserve chastity; that I will be faithful to the king of
------; that I will never surrender to the enemy the towns and places
belonging to the order; and that I will never refuse to the religious
any succour that I am able to afford them; that I will aid and defend
them by words, by arms, and by all sorts of good offices; and in
sincerity and of my own free will I swear that I will observe all these
things." <span id="fr_166"></span>[\*](#fn_166.md)

Among the earliest of the Masters, or Grand Priors, or Grand Preceptors
of England, whose names figure in history, is Richard de Hastings, who
was at the head of the order in this country on the accession of King
Henry the Second to the throne, <span id="fr_167"></span>[†](#fn_167.md)
(A.D. 11540 and was employed by that monarch in various important
negotiations. In the year 1160 he greatly offended the king of France.
The Princess Margaret, the

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

daughter of that monarch, had been betrothed to Prince Henry, son of
Henry the Second, king of England; and in the treaty of peace entered
into between the two sovereigns, it was stipulated that Gizors and two
other places, part of the dowry of the princess, should be consigned to
the custody of the Templars, to be delivered into King Henry's hands
after the celebration of the nuptials. The king of England (A.D. 1160)
caused the prince and princess, both of whom were infants, to be married
in the presence of Richard de Hastings, the Grand Prior or Master of the
Temple in England, and two other Knights Templars, who, immediately
after the conclusion of the ceremony, placed the fortresses in King
Henry's hands. <span id="fr_168"></span>[\*](#fn_168.md) The king of France
was highly indignant at this proceeding, and some writers accuse the
Templars of treachery, but from the copy of the treaty published by Lord
Littleton <span id="fr_169"></span>[†](#fn_169.md) it does not appear that
they acted with bad faith.

The above Richard de Hastings was the friend and confidant of Thomas â
Becket. During the disputes between that haughty prelate and the king,
the archbishop, we are told, withdrew from the council chamber, where
all his brethren were assembled, and went to consult with Richard de
Hastings, the Prior of the Temple at London, who threw himself on his
knees before him, and with many tears besought him to give in his
adherence to the famous councils of Clarendon. <span
id="fr_170"></span>[‡](#fn_170.md)

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

Richard de Hastings was succeeded by Richard Mallebeench, who confirmed
a treaty of peace and concord which had been entered into between his
predecessor and the abbot of Kirkested; <span
id="fr_171"></span>[\*](#fn_171.md) and the next Master of the Temple
appears to have been Geoffrey son of Stephen, who received the Patriarch
Heraclius as his guest at the new Temple on the occasion of the
consecration of the Temple church, He styles himself "*Minister* of the
soldiery of the Temple in England." <span
id="fr_172"></span>[†](#fn_172.md)

In consequence of the high estimation in which the Templars were held,
and the privilege of sanctuary enjoyed by them, the Temple at London
came to be made "a storehouse of treasure." The wealth of the king, the
nobles, the bishops, and of the rich burghers of London, was generally
deposited therein, under the safeguard and protection of the military
friars. <span id="fr_173"></span>[‡](#fn_173.md) The money collected in the
churches and chapels for the succour of the Holy Land was also paid into
the treasury of the Temple, to be forwarded to its destination: and the
treasurer was at different times authorised to receive the taxes imposed
upon the moveables of the ecclesiastics, also the large sums of money
extorted by the rapacious popes from the English clergy, and the
annuities granted by the king to the nobles of the kingdom. <span
id="fr_174"></span>[§](#fn_174.md) The money and jewels of Hubert de Burgh,
earl of Kent, the chief justiciary, and at one time governor of the king
and kingdom of

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> England, were
deposited in the Temple, and when that nobleman was disgraced and
committed to the Tower, the king attempted to lay hold of the treasure.

Matthew Paris gives the following curious account of the affair:

"It was suggested," says he, "to the king, that Hubert had no small
amount of treasure deposited in the New Temple, under the custody of the
Templars. The king, accordingly, summoning to his presence the Master of
the Temple, briefly demanded of him if it was so. He indeed, not daring
to deny the truth to the king, confessed that he had money of the said
Hubert, which had been confidentially committed to the keeping of
himself and his brethren, but of the quantity and amount thereof he was
altogether ignorant. Then the king endeavoured with threats to obtain
from the brethren the surrender to him of the aforesaid money, asserting
that it had been fraudulently subtracted from his treasury. But they
answered to the king, that money confided to them in trust they would
deliver to no man without the permission of him who had intrusted it to
be kept in the Temple. And the king, since the above-mentioned money had
been placed under their protection, ventured not to take it by force. He
sent, therefore, the treasurer of his court, with his justices of the
Exchequer, to Hubert, who had already been placed in fetters in the
Tower of London, that they might exact from him an assignment of the
entire sum to the king. But when these messengers had explained to
Hubert the object of their coining, he immediately answered that he
would submit himself and all belonging to him to the good pleasure of
his sovereign. He therefore petitioned the brethren of the chivalry of
the Temple that they would, in his behalf, present all his keys to his
lord the king, that he might do what he pleased with the things
deposited in the Temple. This being done, the king ordered all that
money,

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

faithfully counted, to be placed in his treasury, and the amount of all
the things found to be reduced into writing and exhibited before him.
The king's clerks, indeed, and the treasurer acting with them, found
deposited in the Temple gold and silver vases of inestimable price, and
money and many precious gems, an enumeration whereof would in truth
astonish the hearers." <span id="fr_175"></span>[\*](#fn_175.md)

The kings of England frequently resided in the Temple, and so also did
the haughty legates of the Roman pontiffs, who there made contributions
in the name of the pope upon the English bishoprics. Matthew Paris gives
a lively account of the exactions of the nuncio Martin, who resided for
many years at the Temple, and came there armed by the pope with powers
such as no legate had ever before possessed. "He made," says he, "whilst
residing at London in the New Temple, unheard of extortions of money and
valuables. He imperiously intimated to the abbots and priors that they
must send him rich presents, desirable palfreys, sumptuous services for
the table, and rich clothing; which being done, that same Martin sent
back word that the things sent were insufficient, and he commanded the
givers thereof to forward him better things, on pain of suspension and
excommunication." <span id="fr_176"></span>[†](#fn_176.md)

The convocations of the clergy and the great ecclesiastical councils

<span id="fn_141"></span>[99:†](hkt07.htm#fr_141.md) The Templars, by
diverting the water, created a great nuisance. In A.D. 1290, the *Prior
et fratres de Carmelo* (the white friars) complained to the king in
parliament of the putrid exhalations arising from the Fleet river, which
were so powerful as to overcome all the frankincense burnt at their
altar during divine service, and had occasioned the deaths of many of
their brethren. They beg that the stench may be removed, lest they also
should perish. The Friars preachers (black friars) and the bishop of
Salisbury (whose house stood in Salisbury-court) made a similar
complaint; as did also Henry Lacy, Earl of Lincoln, who alleges that the
Templars (*ipsi de novo Templo*) had turned off the water of the river
to their mills at Castle Baignard.--*Rot. Parl.* vol. i. p. 60, 200.
