THE extraordinary and romantic institution of the Knights Templars,
those military friars who so strangely blended the character of the monk
with that of the soldier, took its origin in the following manner:--

On the miraculous discovery of the Holy sepulchre by the Empress Helena,
the mother of Constantine, about 298 years after the death of Christ,
and the consequent erection, by command

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

of the first christian emperor, of the magnificent church of the
Resurrection, or, as it is now called, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
over the sacred monument, the tide of pilgrimage set in towards
Jerusalem, and went on increasing in strength as Christianity gradually
spread throughout Europe. On the surrender of the Holy City to the
victorious Arabians, (A.D. 637,) the privileges and the security of the
christian population were provided for in the following guarantee, given
under the hand and seal of the Caliph Omar to Sophronius the Patriarch.

"From OMAR EBNO ’L ALCHITAB to the inhabitants of ÆLIA."

"They shall be protected and secured both in their lives and fortunes,
and their churches shall neither be pulled down nor made use of by any
but themselves." <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md)

Under the government of the Arabians, the pilgrimages continued steadily
to increase; the old and the young, women and children, flocked in
crowds to Jerusalem, and in the year 1064 the Holy Sepulchre was visited
by an enthusiastic band of seven thousand pilgrims, headed by the
Archbishop of Mentz and the Bishops of Utrecht, Bamberg, and
Ratisbon. <span id="fr_1"></span>[†](#fn_1.md) The year following, however,
Jerusalem was conquered by the wild Turcomans. Three thousand of the
citizens were indiscriminately massacred, and the hereditary command
over the Holy City and territory was confided to the Emir Ortok, the
chief of a savage pastoral tribe.

Under the iron yoke of these fierce Northern strangers, the Christians
were fearfully oppressed; they were driven from their

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

churches; divine worship was ridiculed and interrupted; and the
patriarch of the Holy City was dragged by the hair of his bead over the
sacred pavement of the church of the Resurrection, and cast into a
dungeon, to extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock. The pilgrims
who, through innumerable perils, had reached the gates of the Holy City,
were plundered, imprisoned, and frequently massacred; an *aureus*, or
piece of gold, was exacted as the price of admission to the holy
sepulchre, and many, unable to pay the tax, were driven by the swords of
the Turcomans from the very threshold of the object of all their hopes,
the bourne of their long pilgrimage, and were compelled to retrace their
weary steps in sorrow and anguish to their distant homes. <span
id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2.md) The melancholy intelligence of the
profanation of the holy places, and of the oppression and cruelty of the
Turcomans, aroused the religious chivalry of Christendom; "a nerve was
touched of exquisite feeling, and the sensation vibrated to the heart of
Europe."

Then arose the wild enthusiasm of the crusades; men of all ranks, and
even monks and priests, animated by the exhortations of the pope and the
preachings of Peter the Hermit, flew to arms, and enthusiastically
undertook "the pious and glorious enterprize" of rescuing the holy
sepulchre of Christ from the foul abominations of the heathen.

When intelligence of the capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders (A.D.
1099) had been conveyed to Europe, the zeal of pilgrimage blazed forth
with increased fierceness; it had gathered intensity from the interval
of its suppression by the wild Turcomans, and promiscuous crowds of both
sexes, old men and children, virgins and matrons, thinking the road then
open and the journey practicable, successively pressed forwards towards
the Holy City, with the passionate desire of contemplating the original
monuments of the

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Redemption. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3.md) The infidels had indeed been driven out of
Jerusalem, but not out of Palestine. The lofty mountains bordering the
sea-coast were infested by bold and warlike bands of fugitive Mussulmen,
who maintained themselves in various impregnable castles and
strongholds, from whence they issued forth upon the high-roads, cut off
the communication between Jerusalem and the sea-ports, and revenged
themselves for the loss of their habitations and property by the
indiscriminate pillage of all travellers. The Bedouin horsemen,
moreover, making rapid incursions from beyond the Jordan, frequently
kept up a desultory and irregular warfare in the plains; and the
pilgrims, consequently, whether they approached the Holy City by land or
by sea, were alike exposed to almost daily hostility, to plunder, and to
death.

To alleviate the dangers and distresses to which these pious enthusiasts
were exposed, to guard the honour of the saintly virgins and
matrons, <span id="fr_4"></span>[†](#fn_4.md) and to protect the gray hairs
of the venerable palmer, nine noble knights formed a holy brotherhood in
arms, and entered into a solemn compact to aid one another in clearing
the highways of infidels, and of robbers, and in protecting the pilgrims
through the passes and defiles of the mountains to the Holy City. Warmed
with the religious and military fervour of the day, and animated by the
sacredness of the cause to which they had devoted their swords, they
called themselves the *Poor Fellow-soldiers of Jesus Christ*. They
renounced the world and its pleasures, and in the holy church of the
Resurrection, in the presence of the patriarch of Jerusalem, they

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

embraced vows of perpetual chastity, obedience, and poverty, after the
manner of monks. <span id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md) Uniting in
themselves the two most popular qualities of the age, devotion and
valour, and exercising them in the most popular of all enterprises, the
protection of the pilgrims and of the road to the holy sepulchre, they
speedily acquired a vast reputation and a splendid renown.

At first, we are told, they had no church and no particular place of
abode, but in the year of our Lord 1118, (nineteen years after the
conquest of Jerusalem by the Crusaders,) they had rendered such good and
acceptable service to the Christians, that Baldwin the Second, king of
Jerusalem, granted them a place of habitation within the sacred
inclosure of the Temple on Mount Moriah, amid those holy and magnificent
structures, partly erected by the christian Emperor Justinian, and
partly built by the Caliph Omar, which were then exhibited by the monks
and priests of Jerusalem, whose restless zeal led them to practise on
the credulity of the pilgrims, and to multiply relics and all objects
likely to be sacred in their eyes, as the *Temple of Solomon*, whence
the Poor Fellow-soldiers of Jesus Christ came thenceforth to be known by
the name of "*the Knighthood of the Temple of Solomon*." <span
id="fr_6"></span>[†](#fn_6.md)

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

A few remarks in elucidation of the name Templars, or Knights of the
Temple, may not be altogether unacceptable.

By the Mussulmen, the site of the great Jewish temple on Mount Moriah
has always been regarded with peculiar veneration. Mahomet, in the first
year of the publication of the Koran, directed his followers, when at
prayer, to turn their faces towards it, and pilgrimages have constantly
been made to the holy spot by devout Moslems. On the conquest of
Jerusalem by the Arabians, it was the first care of the Caliph Omar to
rebuild "the Temple of the Lord." Assisted by the principal chieftains
of his army, the Commander of the Faithful undertook the pious office of
clearing the ground with his own hands, and of tracing out the
foundations of the magnificent mosque which now crowns with its dark and
swelling dome the elevated summit of Mount Moriah. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[\*](#fn_7.md)

This great house of prayer, the most holy Mussulman Temple in the world
after that of Mecca, is erected over the spot where "Solomon began to
build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the Lord
appeared unto David his father, in the place that David had prepared in
the threshing-floor of Oman the Jebusite." It remains to this day in a
state of perfect preservation, and is one of the finest specimens of
Saracenic architecture in existence. It is entered by four spacious
doorways, each door facing one of the cardinal points; the *Bab el
D'jannat*, or gate of the garden, on the north; the *Bab el Kebla*, or
gate of prayer, on the south; the *Bab ib’n el Daoud*, or the

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

gate of the son of David, on the east; and the *Bab el Garbi*, on the
west. By the Arabian geographers it is called *Beit Allah*, the house of
God, also *Beit Almokaddas*, or *Beit Almacdes*, the holy house. From it
Jerusalem derives its Arabic name, *el Kods*, the holy, *el Schereef*,
the noble, and *el Mobarek*, the blessed; while the governors of the
city, instead of the customary high-sounding titles of sovereignty and
dominion, take the simple title of *Hami*, or protectors.

On the conquest of Jerusalem by the crusaders, the crescent was torn
down from the summit of this famous Mussulman Temple, and was replaced
by an immense golden cross, and the edifice was then consecrated to the
services of the christian religion, but retained its simple appellation
of "The Temple of the Lord." William, Archbishop of Tyre and Chancellor
of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, gives an interesting account of this famous
edifice as it existed in his time, during the Latin dominion. He speaks
of the splendid mosaic work, of the Arabic characters setting forth the
name of the founder, and the cost of the undertaking, and of the famous
rock under the centre of the dome, which is to this day shown by the
Moslems as the spot whereon the destroying angel stood, " with his drawn
sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem." <span
id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md) This rock he

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

informs us was left exposed and uncovered for the space of fifteen years
after the conquest of the holy city by the crusaders, but was, after
that period, cased with a handsome altar of white marble, upon which the
priests daily said mass.

To the south of this holy Mussulman temple, on the extreme edge of the
summit of Mount Moriah, and resting against the modern walls of the town
of Jerusalem, stands the venerable christian church of the Virgin,
erected by the Emperor Justinian, whose stupendous foundations,
remaining to this day, fully justify the astonishing description given
of the building by Procopius. That writer informs us that in order to
get a level surface for the erection of the edifice, it was necessary,
on the east and south sides of the hill, to raise up a wall of masonry
from the valley below, and to construct a vast foundation, partly
composed of solid stone and partly of arches and pillars. The stones
were of such magnitude, that each block required to be transported in a
truck drawn by forty of the emperor's strongest oxen; and to admit of
the passage of these trucks it was necessary to widen the roads leading
to Jerusalem. The forests of Lebanon yielded their choicest cedars for
the timbers of the roof, and a quarry of variegated marble, seasonably
discovered in the adjoining mountains, furnished the edifice with superb
marble columns. <span id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md) The interior of this
interesting structure, which still remains at Jerusalem, after a lapse
of more than thirteen centuries, in an excellent state of preservation,
is adorned with six rows of columns, from whence spring arches
supporting the cedar beams and timbers of the roof; and at the end of
the building is a round tower, surmounted by a dome. The vast stones,
the walls of masonry, and the subterranean colonnade raised to support
the south-east angle of the platform whereon the church is erected, are
truly wonderful, and may still be seen by penetrating through

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

a small door, and descending several flights of steps at the south-east
corner of the inclosure. Adjoining the sacred edifice, the emperor
erected hospitals, or houses of refuge, for travellers, sick people, and
mendicants of all nations; the foundations whereof, composed of handsome
Roman masonry, are still visible on either side of the southern end of
the building.

On the conquest of Jerusalem by the Moslems, this venerable church was
converted into a mosque, and was called *D’jamé al Acsa;* it was
enclosed, together with the great Mussulman Temple of the Lord erected
by the Caliph Omar, within a large area by a high stone wall, which runs
around the edge of the summit of Mount Moriah, and guards from the
profane tread of the unbeliever the whole of that sacred ground whereon
once stood the gorgeous temple of the wisest of kings. <span
id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md)

When the Holy City was taken by the crusaders, the *D’jamé al Acsa*,
with the various buildings constructed around it, became the property of
the kings of Jerusalem; and is denominated by William of Tyre "the
palace," or "royal house to the south of the Temple of the Lord,
vulgarly called the Temple of Solomon." <span
id="fr_11"></span>[†](#fn_11.md) It was this edifice or temple on Mount
Moriah which was appropriated to the use of the poor fellow-soldiers of
Jesus Christ, as they had no church and no particular place of

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

abode, and from it they derived their name of Knights Templars. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md)

James of Vitry, Bishop of Acre, who gives an interesting account of the
holy places, thus speaks of the Temple of the Knights Templars. "There
is, moreover, at Jerusalem another temple of immense spaciousness and
extent, from which the brethren of the knighthood of the Temple derive
their name of Templars, which is called the Temple of Solomon, perhaps
to distinguish it from the one above described, which is specially
called the Temple of the Lord. " <span id="fr_13"></span>[†](#fn_13.md) He
moreover informs us in his oriental history, that "in the Temple of the
Lord there is an abbot and canons regular; and be it known that the one
is the Temple of the *Lord*, and the other the Temple of the *Chivalry*.
These are *clerks*, the others are *knights*." <span
id="fr_14"></span>[‡](#fn_14.md)

The canons of the Temple of the Lord conceded to the poor
fellow-soldiers of Jesus Christ the large court extending between that
building and the Temple of Solomon; the king, the patriarch, and the
prelates of Jerusalem, and the barons of the Latin kingdom, assigned
them various gifts and revenues for their maintenance and support, <span
id="fr_15"></span>[§](#fn_15.md) and the order being now settled in a
regular place of abode, the knights soon began to entertain more
extended views, and to seek a larger theatre for the exercise of their
holy profession.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

Their first aim and object had been, as before mentioned, simply to
protect the poor pilgrims, on their journey backwards and forwards, from
the sea-coast to Jerusalem; <span id="fr_16"></span>[\*](#fn_16.md) but as
the hostile tribes of Mussulmen, which everywhere surrounded the Latin
kingdom, were gradually recovering from the stupifying terror into which
they had been plunged by the successful and exterminating warfare of the
first crusaders, and were assuming an aggressive and threatening
attitude, it was determined that the holy warriors of the Temple should,
in addition to the protection of pilgrims, make the defence of the
christian kingdom of Jerusalem, of the eastern church, and of all the
holy places, a part of their particular profession.

The two most distinguished members of the fraternity were Hugh de Payens
and Geoffrey de St. Aldemar, or St. Omer, two valiant soldiers of the
cross, who had fought with great credit and renown at the siege of
Jerusalem. Hugh de Payens was chosen by the knights to be the superior
of the new religious and military society, by the title of "The Master
of the Temple;" and he has, consequently, generally been called the
founder of the order.

The name and reputation of the Knights *Templars* speedily spread
throughout Europe, and various illustrious pilgrims from the far west
aspired to become members of the holy fraternity. Among these was Falk,
Count of Anjou, who joined the society as a married brother, (A.D.
1120,) and annually remitted the order thirty pounds of silver. Baldwin,
king of Jerusalem, foreseeing that great advantages would accrue to the
Latin kingdom by the increase of the power and numbers of these holy

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

warriors, exerted himself to extend the order throughout all
Christendom, so that he might, by means of so politic an institution,
keep alive the holy enthusiasm of the west, and draw a constant succour
from the bold and warlike races of Europe for the support of his
christian throne and kingdom.

St. Bernard, the holy abbot of Clairvaux, had been a great admirer of
the Templars. He wrote a letter to the Count of Champagne, on his
entering the order, (A.D. 1123,) praising the act as one of eminent
merit in the sight of God; and it was determined to enlist the
all-powerful influence of this great ecclesiastic in favour of the
fraternity. "By a vow of poverty and penance, by closing his eyes
against the visible world, by the refusal of all ecclesiastical
dignities, the Abbot of Clairvaux became the oracle of Europe, and the
founder of one hundred and sixty convents. Princes and pontiffs trembled
at the freedom of his apostolical censures: France, England, and Milan,
consulted and obeyed his judgment in a schism of the church: the debt
was repaid by the gratitude of Innocent the Second; and his successor,
Eugenics the Third, was the friend and disciple of the holy St.
Bernard." <span id="fr_17"></span>[\*](#fn_17.md)

To this learned and devout prelate two knights templars were despatched
with the following letter:

"Baldwin, by the grace of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, King of Jerusalem, and
Prince of Antioch, to the venerable Father Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux,
health and regard.

"The Brothers of the Temple, whom the Lord hath deigned to raise up, and
whom by an especial Providence he preserves for the defence of this
kingdom, desiring to obtain from the Holy See the confirmation of their
institution, and a rule for their particular guidance, we have
determined to send to you the two knights, Andrew and Gondemar, men as
much distinguished by

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

their military exploits as by the splendour of their birth, to obtain
from the Pope the approbation of their order, and to dispose his
holiness to send succour and subsidies against the enemies of the faith,
reunited in their design to destroy us, and to invade our christian
territories.

"Well knowing the weight of your mediation with God and his vicar upon
earth, as well as with the princes and powers of Europe, we have thought
fit to confide to yon these two important matters, whose successful
issue cannot be otherwise than most agreeable to ourselves. The statutes
we ask of you should be so ordered and arranged as to be reconcilable
with the tumult of the camp and the profession of arms; they must, in
fact, be of such a nature as to obtain favour and popularity with the
christian princes.

"Do you then so manage, that we may, through you, have the happiness of
seeing this important affair brought to a successful issue, and address
for us to heaven the incense of your prayers." <span
id="fr_18"></span>[\*](#fn_18.md)

Soon after the above letter had been despatched to St. Bernard, Hugh de
Payens himself proceeded to Rome, accompanied by Geoffrey de St.
Aldemar, and four other brothers of the order, viz. Brother Payen de
Montdidier, Brother Gorall, Brother Geoffrey Bisol, and Brother
Archambauld de St. Amand. They were received with great honour and
distinction by Pope Honorius, who warmly approved of the objects and
designs of the holy fraternity. St. Bernard had, in the mean time, taken
the affair greatly to heart; he negotiated with the Pope, the legate,
and the bishops of France, and obtained the convocation of a great
ecclesiastical council at Troyes, (A.D. 11280 which Hugh de Payens and
his brethren were invited to attend. This council consisted of several
archbishops, bishops, and abbots, among

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

which last was St. Bernard himself. The rules to which the Templars had
subjected themselves were there described by the master, and to the holy
Abbot of Clairvaux was confided the task of revising and correcting
these rules, and of framing a code of statutes fit and proper for the
governance of the great religious and military fraternity of the Temple.
