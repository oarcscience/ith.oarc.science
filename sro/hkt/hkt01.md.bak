# PREFACE.

THE extraordinary and romantic career of the Knights Templars, their
exploits and their misfortunes, render their history a subject of
peculiar interest.

Born during the first fervour of the Crusades, they were flattered and
aggrandized as long as their great military power and religious
fanaticism could be made available for the support of the Eastern church
and the retention of the Holy Land, but when the crescent had ultimately
triumphed over the cross, and the religio-military enthusiasm of
Christendom had died away, they encountered the basest ingratitude in
return for the services they had rendered to the christian faith, and
were plundered, persecuted, and condemned to a cruel death, by those who
ought in justice to have been their defenders and supporters. The memory
of these holy warriors is embalmed in all our recollections of the wars
of the cross; they were the bulwarks of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem
during the short period of its existence, and were the last band of
Europe's host that contended for the possession of Palestine.

To the vows of the monk and the austere life of the convent,

the Templars added the discipline of the camp, and the stern duties of
the military life, joining

The vulgar notion that the Templars were as wicked as they were fearless
and brave, has not yet been entirely exploded; but it is hoped that the
copious account of the proceedings against the order in this country,
given in the ninth and tenth chapters of the ensuing volume, will tend
to dispel many unfounded prejudices still entertained against the
fraternity, and excite emotions of admiration for their constancy and
courage, and of pity for their unmerited and cruel fate.

Matthew Paris, who wrote at *St. Albans*, concerning events in
*Palestine*, tells us that the emulation between the Templars and
Hospitaliers frequently broke out into open warfare to the great scandal
and prejudice of Christendom, and that, in a pitched battle fought
between them, the Templars were slain to a man. The solitary testimony
of Matthew Paris, who was no friend to the two orders, is invalidated by
the silence of contemporary historians, who wrote on the spot; and it is
quite evident from the letters of the pope, addressed to the
Hospitaliers, the year after the date of the alleged battle, that such
an occurrence never could have taken place.

The accounts, even of the best of the antient writers, should not be
adopted without examination, and a careful comparison with other sources
of information. William of Tyre, for instance, tells us that
*Nassr-ed-deen*, son of sultan *Abbas*, was taken prisoner by the
Templars, and whilst in their hands became a convert to the Christian
religion; that he had learned the rudiments

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

of the Latin language, and earnestly sought to be baptized, but that the
Templars were bribed with sixty thousand pieces of gold to surrender him
to his enemies in Egypt, where certain death awaited him; and that they
stood by to see him bound hand and foot with chains, and placed in an
iron cage, to be conducted across the desert to Cairo. Now the Arabian
historians of that period tell us that *Nassr-ed-deen* and his father
murdered the caliph and threw his body into a well, and then fled with
their retainers and treasure into Palestine; that the sister of the
murdered caliph wrote immediately to the commandant at Gaza, which place
was garrisoned by the Knights Templars, offering a handsome reward for
the capture of the fugitives; that they were accordingly intercepted,
and *Nassr-ed-deen* was sent to Cairo, where the female relations of the
caliph caused his body to be cut into small pieces in the seraglio. The
above act has constantly been made a matter of grave accusation against
the Templars; but what a different complexion does the case assume on
the testimony of the Arabian authorities!

It must be remembered that William archbishop of Tyre was hostile to the
order on account of its vast powers and privileges, and carried his
complaints to a general council of the church at Rome. He is abandoned,
in everything that he says to the prejudice of the fraternity, by James
of Vitry, bishop of Acre, a learned and most talented prelate, who wrote
in Palestine subsequently to William of Tyre, and has copied largely
from the history of the latter. The bishop of Acre speaks of the
Templars in the highest terms, and declares that they were universally
loved by all men for their piety and humility. "*Nulli molesti erant!*"
says he, "*sed ab omnibus propter humilitatem et religionem amabantur*."

The celebrated orientalist *Von Hammer* has recently brought forward
various extraordinary and unfounded charges, destitute

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

of all authority, against the Templars; and *Wilcke*, who has written a
German history of the order, seems to have imbibed all the vulgar
prejudices against the fraternity. I might have added to the interest of
the ensuing work, by making the Templars horrible and atrocious
villains; but I have endeavoured to write a fair and impartial account
of the order, not slavishly adopting everything I find detailed in
antient writers, but such matters only as I believe, after a careful
examination of the best authorities, to be true.

It is a subject of congratulation to us that we possess, in the Temple
Church at London, the most beautiful and perfect memorial of the order
of the Knights Templars now in existence. No one who has seen that
building in its late dress of plaster and whitewash will recognize it
when restored to its antient magnificence. This venerable structure was
one of the chief ecclesiastical edifices of the Knights Templars in
Europe, and stood next in rank to the Temple at Jerusalem. As I have
performed the pilgrimage to the Holy City, and wandered amid the courts
of the antient Temple of the Knights Templars on Mount Moriah, I could
not but regard with more than ordinary interest the restoration by the
societies of the Inner and the Middle Temple of their beautiful Temple
Church.

The greatest zeal and energy have been displayed by them in that
praiseworthy undertaking, and no expense has been spared to repair the
ravages of time, and to bring back the structure to what it was in the
time of the Templars.

In the summer I had the pleasure of accompanying one of the chief and
most enthusiastic promoters of the restoration of the church (Mr. Burge,
Q.C.) over the interesting fabric, and at his suggestion the present
work was commenced. I am afraid that it will hardly answer his
expectations, and am sorry that the interesting task has not been
undertaken by an abler hand.

P.S. Mr. Willement, who is preparing some exquisitely stained glass
windows for the Temple Church, has just drawn my attention to the
nineteenth volume of the "MEMOIR ES DE LA SOCIÉTÉ ROYALE DES ANTIQUAIRES
DE FRANCE," published last year. It contains a most curious and
interesting account of the church of Brelevennez, in the department des
Cotes-du-Nord, supposed to have formerly belonged to the order of the
Temple, written by the Chevalier du FREMANVILLE. Amongst various curious
devices, crosses, and symbols found upon the windows and the tombs of
the church, is a copper medallion, which appears to have been suspended
from the neck by a chain. This decoration consists of a small circle,
within which are inscribed two equilateral triangles placed one upon the
other, so as to form a six-pointed star. In the midst of the star is a
second circle, containing within it the LAMB of the order of the Temple
holding the banner in its fore-paw, similar to what we see on the
antient seal of the order delineated in the title-page of this work. Mr.
Willement has informed me that he has received an offer from a gentleman
in Brittany to send over casts of the decorations and devices lately
discovered in that church. He has kindly referred the letter to me for
consideration, but I have not thought it advisable to delay the
publication of the present work for the purpose of procuring them.

Mr. Willement has also drawn my attention to a very distinct impression
of the reverse of the seal of the Temple described in page 106, whereon
I read very plainly the interesting motto, "TESTIS SVM AGNI.
