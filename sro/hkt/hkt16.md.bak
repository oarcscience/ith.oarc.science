"PLANTAGENET. Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?  
                      Dare no man answer in a case of truth?

SUFFOLK . . .      Within the TEMPLE HALL we were too loud:  
                      The GARDEN here is more convenient."

</div>

SHAKSPEARE makes the Temple Garden, which is to this day celebrated for
the beauty and profusion of its flowers, the scene of the choice of the
white and red roses, as the badges of the rival houses of York and
Lancaster. Richard Plantagenet and the earl of Somerset retire with
their followers from the hall into the garden, where Plantagenet thus
addresses the silent and hesitating bystanders:

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">  "Since you are tongue-ty’d, and so loath to
speak,  
In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:  
Let him, that is a true-born gentleman,  
And stands upon the honour of his birth,  
If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,  
From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.  
  *Somerset*. Let him that is no coward, nor no flatterer,  
But dare maintain the party of the truth,  
Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.  
  *Warwick*. I love no colours; and, without all colour  
Of base insinuating flattery,  
I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.  
  *Suffolk*. I pluck this red rose with young Somerset,  
And say withal I think he held the right.  
.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
  *Vernon*. Then for the truth and plainness of the case,  
I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,  
Giving my verdict on the white rose aide.  
  *Somerset*.    .    .    Come on, who else?  
  *Lawyer*. Unless my study and my books be false,  
The argument you held was wrong in you;  
In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.     \[TO SOMERSET.  
.    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .  
  *Warwick*.    .    .    This brawl to-day,  
Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden,  
Shall send, between the red rose and the white,  
A thousand souls to death and deadly night."</span>

In the Cotton Library is a manuscript written at the commencement of the
reign of Henry the Eighth, entitled "A description of the Form and
Manner, how, and by what Orders and Customs the State of the
Fellowshyppe of the Myddil Temple is maintained, and what ways they have
to attaine unto Learning." <span id="fr_590"></span>[\*](#fn_589.md) It
contains a great deal of curious information concerning the government
of the house, the readings, mot-yngs, boltings, and other exercises
formerly performed for the advancement

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

of learning, and of the different degrees of benchers, readers,
cupboard-men, inner-barristers, utter-barristers, and students, together
with "the chardges for their mete and drynke by the yeare, and the
manner of the dyet, and the stipende of their officers." The writer
tells us that it was the duty of the "Tresorer to gather of certen of
the fellowship a tribute yerely of iii*s*. iii*d*. a piece, and to pay
out of it the rent due to my lord of Saint John's for the house that
they dwell in."

"Item; they have no place to walk in, and talk and confer their
learnings, but in the church; which place all the terme times hath in it
no more of quietnesse than the perwyse of Pawles, by occasion of the
confluence and concourse of such as be suters in the lawe." The
conferences between lawyers and clients in the Temple Church are thus
alluded to by Butler:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Retain all sorts of witnesses  
That ply in the Temple under trees,  
Or walk the Round with knights of the poets,  
About the cross-legged knights their hosts."</span>

</div>

"Item; they have every day three masses said one after the other, and
the first masse doth begin at seaven of the clock, or thereabouts. On
festivall days they have mattens and masse solemnly sung; and during the
matyns singing they have three masses said." <span
id="fr_591"></span>[\*](#fn_590.md)

At the commencement of the reign of Henry VIII. a wall was built between
the Temple Garden and the river; the Inner Temple Hall was "seeled,"
various new chambers were erected, and the societies expended sums of
money, and acted as if they were absolute proprietors of the Temple,
rather than as lessees of the Hospitaliers of Saint John.

In 32 Hen. VIII. was passed the act of parliament dissolving

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

the order of the Hospital, and vesting all the property of the brethren
in the crown, saving the rights and interests of lessees, and others who
held under them.

The two law societies consequently now held of the crown.

In 5 Eliz. the present spacious and magnificent Middle Temple Hall, one
of the most elegant and beautiful structures in the kingdom, was
commenced, (the old hall being converted into chambers;) and in the
reigns both of Mary and Elizabeth, various buildings and sets of
chambers were erected in the Inner and Middle Temple, at the expense of
the Benchers and members of the two societies. All this was done in full
reliance upon the justice and honour of the crown. In the reign of James
I., however, some Scotchman attempted to obtain from his majesty a grant
of the fee-simple or inheritance of the Temple, which being brought to
the knowledge of the two societies, they forthwith made "humble suit" to
the king, and obtained a grant of the property to themselves. By letters
patent, bearing date at Westminster the 13th of August, in the sixth
year of his reign, A.D. 1609, king James granted the Temple to the
Benchers of the two societies, their heirs and assigns for ever, for the
lodging, reception, and education of the professors and students of the
laws of England, the said Benchers yielding and paying to the said king,
his heirs, and successors, ten pounds yearly for the mansion called the
Inner Temple, and ten pounds yearly for the Middle Temple. <span
id="fr_592"></span>[\*](#fn_591.md)

In grateful acknowledgment of this donation, the two societies caused to
be made, at their mutual cost, "a stately cup of pure gold, weighinge
two hundred ounces and an halfe, of the value of one thousand markes, or
thereabouts, the which in all humbleness was presented to his excellent
majestie att the court att Whitehall, in the said sixth year of his
majestie's raigne over

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

the realme of England, for a new yeare's gifte, by the hands of the said
sir Henry Mountague, afterwards baron Mountague, viscount Mandevil, the
earl of Manchester, Richard Daston, esq., and other eminent persons of
both those honourable societies, the which it pleased his majesty most
gratiously to accept and receiue . . . . Upon one side of this cup is
curiously engraven the proportion of a church or temple beautified, with
turrets and pinnacles, and on the other side is figured an altar,
whereon is a representation of a holy fire, the flames propper, and over
the flames these words engraven, *Nil nisi vobis*. The cover of this
rich cup of gold is in the upper parte thereof adorned with a fabrick
fashioned like a pyramid, whereon standeth the statue of a military
person leaning, with the left hand upon a Roman-fashioned shield or
target, the which cup his excellent majestie, whilst he lived, esteemed
for one of his roialest and richest jewells," <span
id="fr_593"></span>[\*](#fn_592.md)

Some of the antient orders and regulations for the government of the two
societies are not unworthy of attention.

From the record of a parliament holden in the Inner Temple on the 16th
of November, 3 and 4 Ph. and Mary, A.D. 1558, it appears that eight
gentlemen of the house, in the previous reading vocation, "were
*committed to the Fleete* for wilfull demenoure and disobedience *to the
Bench*, and were worthyly expulsed the fellowshyppe of the house, since
which tyme, upon their humble suite and submission unto the said
Benchers of the said house, it is agreed that they shall be readmitted
into the fellowshyppe, and into commons again, without payeing any
ffine." <span id="fr_594"></span>[†](#fn_593.md)

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

Amongst the ancient customs and usages derived from the Knights
Templars, which were for a lengthened period religiously preserved and
kept up in the Temple, was the oriental fashion of long beards. In the
reign of Philip and Mary, at the personal request of the queen, attempts
were made to do away with this time-honoured custom, and to limit

THE LENGTH OF A LAWYER'S BEARD.

On the 22nd of June, 3 and 4 Philip and Mary, A.D. 1557, it was ordered
that none of the companies of the Inner and Middle Temple, under the
degree of a knight being in commons, should wear their beards above
three weeks growing, upon pain of XL*s*., and so double for every week
after monition. They were, moreover, required to lay aside their arms,
and it was ordered "that none of the companies, when they be in commons,
shall wear Spanish cloak, sword and buckler, or rapier, or gownes and
hats, or gownes girded with a dagger;" also, that "none of the
COMPANIONS, except Knights or Benchers, should thenceforth wear in their
doublets or hoses any light colours, except scarlet and crimson; or wear
any upper velvet cap, or any scarf; or wings on their gownes, white
jerkyns, buskins or *velvet shoes*, double cuffs on their shirts,
feathers or ribbens on their caps! That no attorney should be admitted
into either of the houses, and that, in all admissions from thenceforth,
it should be an implied condition, that if the party admitted "should
practyse any attorneyship," he was *ipso facto* dismissed. <span
id="fr_595"></span>[\*](#fn_594.md)

In 1 Jac. I., it was ordered, in obedience to the commands of the king,
that no one should be admitted a member of either society who was not *a
gentleman by descent;*--that none of the gentlemen should come into the
hall "in cloaks, boots, spurs, swords, or daggers;" and it was publicly
declared that their "yellow

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

bands, and ear toyes, and short cloaks, and weapons," were "much
disliked and forbidden."

In A.D. 1623, king James recommended the antient way of wearing caps to
be carefully observed; and the king was pleased to take notice of the
good order of the house of the Inner Temple in that particular. His
majesty was further pleased to recommend that boots should be laid aside
as ill befitting gownsmen; "for boots and spurs," says his majesty, "are
the badges rather of roarers than of civil men, who should use them only
when they ride. Therefore we have made example in our own court, that no
boots shall come into our presence."

The modern Templars for a long period fully maintained the antient
character and reputation of the Temple for sumptuous and magnificent
hospitality, although the venison from the royal forests, and the wine
from the king's cellars, <span id="fr_596"></span>[\*](#fn_595.md) no
longer made its periodical appearance within the walls of the old
convent. Sir John Fortescue alludes to the revels and pastimes of the
Temple in the reign of Henry VI., and several antient writers speak of
the grand Christmasses, the readers’ feasts, the masques, and the
sumptuous entertainments afforded to foreign ambassadors, and even to
royalty itself. Various dramatic shows were got up upon these occasions,
and the leading characters who figured at them were the "*Marshall of
the Knights Templars!*" the constable marshall, the master of the games,
the lieutenant of the Tower, the ranger of the forest, the lord of
misrule, the king of Cockneys, and Jack Straw!

The *Constable Marshall* came into the hall on banqueting days "fairly
mounted on his mule," clothed in complete armour, with a nest of
feathers of all colours upon his helm, and a gilt pole-axe in his hand.
He was attended by halberdiers, and preceded

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

by drums and fifes, and by sixteen trumpeters, and devised some sport
"for passing away the afternoon."

*The Master of the Game*, and *the Ranger of the Forest*, were
apparelled in green velvet and green satin, and had hunting horns about
their necks, with which they marched round about the fire, "blowing
three blasts of venery."

The most remarkable of all the entertainments was *the hunt in the
hall*, when the huntsman came in with his winding horn, dragging in with
him a cat, a fox, a purse-net, and nine or ten couple of hounds! The cat
and the fox were both tied to the end of a staff, and were turned loose
into the hall; they were hunted with the dogs amid the blowing of
hunting horns, and were killed under the grate!!

The quantity of venison consumed on these festive occasions,
particularly at the readers’ feasts, was enormous. In the reign of Queen
Mary, it was ordered by the benchers of the Middle Temple, that no
reader should spend less than fifteen bucks in the hall, and this number
was generally greatly exceeded: "there be few summer readers," we are
informed in an old MS. account of the readers’ feasts, "who, in half the
time that heretofore a reading was wont to continue, spent so little as
threescore bucks, besides red deer; some have spent fourscore, some a
hundred . . . . . <span id="fr_597"></span>[\*](#fn_596.md)" The lawyers in
that golden age breakfasted on "brawn and malmsey," and supped on
"venison pasties and roasted hens!" Among the viands at dinner were
"faire and large bores’ heads served upon silver platters, with
minstralsye, roasted swans, bustards, hems, bitterns, turkey chicks,
curlews, godwits, &c. &c."

The following observations concerning the Temple, and a grand
entertainment there, in the reign of Queen Mary, will be read with
interest. "Arriving in the faire river of Thames, I landed

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

within halfe a leage from the city of London, which was, as I
conjecture, in December last. And drawing neere the citie, sodenly hard
the shot of double cannons, in so great a number, and so terrible, that
it darkened the whole aire, wherewith, although I was in my native
countrie, yet stoode I amazed, not knowing what it ment. Thus, as I
abode in despaire either to returne or to continue my former purpose, I
chaunced to see comming towardes me an honest citizen, clothed in long
garment, keping the highway, seming to walke for his recreation, which
prognosticated rather peace than perill. Of whom I demaunded the cause
of this great shot, who frendly answered, 'It is the warning shot to th’
officers of the Constable Marshall of the Inner Temple to prepare to
dinner! Why, said I, is he of that estate, that seeketh not other meanes
to warn his officers, then with such terrible shot in so peaceable a
countrey? Marry, saith he, he vttereth himselfe the better to be that
officer whose name he beareth. I then demanded what province did he
gouerne that needeth such an officer. Hee answered me, the prouince was
not great in quantitie, but antient in true nobilitie; a place, said he,
priuileged by the most excellent princess, the high gouernour of the
whole land, wherein are store of gentilmen of the whole realme, that
repaire thither to learne to rule, and obey by LAWE, to yeelde their
fleece to their prince and common weale, as also to vse all other
exercises of bodie and minde whereunto nature most aptly serueth to
adorne by speaking, countenance, gesture, and vse of apparel, the person
of a gentleman; whereby amitie is obtained and continued, that gentilmen
of al countries in theire young yeares, norished together in one place,
with such comely order and daily conference, are knit by continual
acquaintance in such vnitie of mincies and manners, as lightly neuer
after is severed, then which is nothing more profitable to the common
weale.

"And after he had told me thus much of honor of the place, I

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

commended in mine own conceit the pollicie of the gouernour; which
seemed to utter in itselfe the foundation of a good commonweale. For
that the best of their people from tender yeares trayned vp in precepts
of justice, it could not chose but yeelde forth a profitable people to a
wise commonweale. Wherefore I determined with myselfe to make proofe of
that I heard by reporte.

"The next day I thought for my pastime to walke to this Temple, and
entering in at the gates, I found the building nothing costly; but many
comfy gentlemen of face and person, and thereto very courteous, saw I
passe too and fro. Passing forward, I entered into a church of auncient
building, wherein were many monumentes of noble personnages armed in
knighteley habite, with their cotes depainted in auncient shieldes,
whereat I took pleasure to behold . . . . .

"Anon we heard the noise of drum and fyfe. What meaneth this drumme?
said I. Quod he, this is to warn gentlemen of the household to repaire
to the dresser; wherefore come on with me, and yee shall stand where ye
may best see the hall serued; and so from thence brought me into a long
gallerie that stretcheth itselfe alongest the hall, neere the prince's
table, where I saw the prince set, a man of tall personage, of mannelye
countenance, somewhat browne of visage, strongelie featured, and thereto
comelie proportioned. At the neather end of the same table were placed
the ambassadors of diners princes. Before him stood the earner, settler,
and cup-bearer, with great number of gentlemen wayters attending his
person. The lordes steward, treasorer, with diners honorable personages,
were placed at a side-table neere adjoyning the prince on the right
hand, and at another table on the left side were placed the treasorer of
the household, secretarie, the prince's serjeant of law, the four
masters of the reaulles, the king of armes, the deane of the chapell,
and diuers

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

gentlemen pentioners to furnish the same. At another table, on the other
side, were set the maister of the game, and his chiefe ranger, maisters
of household, clerkes of the greene cloth and checke, with diuers other
strangers to furnish the same. On the other side, againste them, began
the table of the lieutenant of the Tower, accompanied with diuers
captaines of footbandes and shot. At the neather ende of the hall, began
the table of the high butler and panter, clerkes of the kitchen, maister
cooke of the priue kitchen, furnished throughout with the souldiours and
guard of the prince . . . .

"The prince was serued with tender meates, sweet fruites, and daintie
delicates, confectioned with curious cookerie, as it seemed woonder a
word to serue the prouision. And at euerie course, the trompettes blew
the courageous blaste of deadlye warre, with noise of drum and fyfe,
with the sweet harmony of viollens, shakbuts, recorders, and cornettes,
with other instruments of musicke, as it seemed Apolloe's harpe had
tewned their stroke."

After dinner, prizes were prepared for "tilt and turney, and such
knighteley pastime, and for their solace they masked with bewtie's dames
with such heauenly armonie as if Apollo and Orpheus had shewed their
cunning." <span id="fr_598"></span>[\*](#fn_597.md)

Masques, revels, plays, and eating and drinking, seem to have been as
much attended to in the Temple in those days as the grave study of the
law. Sir Christopher Hatton, a member of the Inner Temple, gained the
favour of Queen Elizabeth, for his grace and activity in a *masque*
which was acted before her majesty. He was made vice-chamberlain, and
afterwards lord chancellor! <span id="fr_599"></span>[†](#fn_598.md) In
A.D. 1568, the tragedy of Tancred and Gismand, the joint production of
five students of the Inner Temple, was acted at the Temple before queen
Elizabeth and her court. <span id="fr_600"></span>[‡](#fn_599.md)

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

On the marriage of the lady Elizabeth, daughter of king James I., to
prince Frederick, the elector palatine, (Feb. 14th, A.D. 1613,) a masque
was performed at court by the gentlemen of the Temple, and shortly
after, twenty Templars were appointed barristers there inhon our of
prince Charles, who had lately become prince of Wales, "the chardges
thereof being defrayed by a contribution of xxxs. from each bencher,
xvs. from euery barister of seauen years' standing, and xs. a peice from
all other gentlemen in commons." <span id="fr_601"></span>[\*](#fn_600.md)

Of all the pageants prepared for the entertainment of the sovereigns of
England, the most famous one was that splendid masque, which cost
upwards of £20,000, presented by the Templars, in conjunction with the
members of Lincoln's Inn and Gray's Inn, to king Charles I., and his
young queen, Henrietta of France. Whitelock, in his Memorials, gives a
minute and most animated account of this masque, which will be read with
interest, as affording a characteristic and admirable exhibition of the
manners of the age

The procession from the Temple to the palace of Whitehall was the most
magnificent that had ever been seen in London. "One hundred gentlemen in
very rich clothes, with scarce anything to be seen on them but gold and
silver lace, were mounted on the best horses and the best furniture that
the king's stable and the stables of all the noblemen in town could
afford." Each gentleman had a page and two lacqueys in livery waiting by
his horse's side. The lacqueys carried torches, and the page his
master's cloak. "The richness of their apparel and furniture glittering
by the light of innumerable torches, the motion and stirring of their
mettled horses, and the many and gay liveries of their servants, but
especially the personal beauty and gallantry of the

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

handsome young gentlemen, made the most glorious and splendid show that
ever was beheld in England."

These gallant Templars were accompanied by the finest band of picked
musicians that London could afford, and were followed by the
*antimasque* of beggars and cripples, who were mounted on "the poorest,
leanest jades that could be gotten out of the dirt-carts." The habits
and dresses of these cripples were most ingeniously arranged, and as the
"gallant Inns of Court men" had their music, so also had the beggars and
cripples. It consisted of *keys*, *tongs*, and *gridirons*, "snapping
and yet playing in concert before them." After the beggars' antimasque
came a band of pipes, whistles, and instruments, sounding notes like
those of birds, of all sorts, in excellent harmony; and these ushered in
"*the anti-masque of birds*," which consisted of an owl in an ivy bush,
with innumerable other birds in a cluster about the owl, gazing upon
her. "These were little boys put into covers of the shape of those
birds, rarely fitted, and sitting on small horses with footmen going by
them with torches in their hands, and there were some besides to look
unto the children, and these were very pleasant to the beholders." Then
came a wild, harsh band of northern music, bagpipes, horns, &c.,
followed by the "*antimasque of projectors*," who were in turn succeeded
by a string of chariots drawn by four horses a breast, filled with "gods
and goddesses," and preceded by heathen priests. Then followed the
chariots of the grand masquers drawn by four horses abreast.

The chariots of the Inner and Middle Temple were silver and blue. The
horses were covered to their heels with cloth of tissue, and their heads
were adorned with huge plumes of blue and white feathers. "The torches
and flaming flamboys borne by the side of each chariot made it seem
lightsom as at noonday . . . . . It was, indeed, a glorious spectacle."

Whitelock gives a most animated description of the scene in

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

the banqueting-room. "It was so crowded," says he, "with fair ladies
glittering with their rich cloaths and richer jewels, and with lords and
gentlemen of great quality, that there was scarce room for the king and
queen to enter in." The young queen danced with the masquers herself,
and judged them "as good dancers as ever she saw!" The great ladies of
the court, too, were "very free and easy and civil in dancing with all
the masquers as they were taken out by them."

Queen Henrietta was so delighted with the masque, "the dances, speeches,
musick, and singing," that she desired to see the whole thing *acted
over again!* whereupon the lord mayor invited their majesties and all
the Inns of Court men into the city, and entertained them with great
state and magnificence at Merchant Taylor's Hall. <span
id="fr_602"></span>[\*](#fn_601.md)

Many of the Templars who were the foremost in these festive scenes
afterwards took up arms against their sovereign. Whitelock himself
commanded a body of horse, and fought several sanguinary engagements
with the royalist forces.

The year after the restoration, Sir Heneage Finch, afterwards earl of
Nottingham, kept his readers’ feast in the great hall of the Inner
Temple with extraordinary splendour. The entertainments lasted from the
4th to the 17th of August.

At the first day's dinner were several of the nobility of the kingdom
and privy councillors, with divers others of his friends; at the second
were the lord mayor, aldermen, and principal citizens of London; to the
third, which was two days after the former, came the whole college of
physicians, who all appeared in their caps and gowns; at the fourth were
all the judges, advocates, and doctors of the civil law, and all the
society of Doctors' Commons; at the fifth were entertained the
archbishops, bishops,

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

and chief of the clergy; and on the 15th of August his majesty king
Charles the Second came from Whitehall in his state barge, and (lined
with the reader and the whole society in the hall. His majesty was
accompanied by the duke of York, and attended by the lord chancellor,
lord treasurer, lord privy seal, the dukes of Buckingham, Richmond, and
Ormond; the lord chamberlain, the earls of Ossory, Bristol, Berks,
Portland, Strafford, Anglesy, Essex, Bath, and Carlisle; the lords
Wentworth, Cornbury, De la Warre, Gerard of Brandon, Berkley of Stratton
and Cornwallis, the comptroller and vice-chamberlain of his majesties's
household; Sir William Morice, one of his principal secretaries of
state; the earl of Middleton, lord commissioner of Scotland, the earl of
Glencairne, lord chancellor of Scotland, the earls of Lauderdale and
Newburgh, and others the commissioners of that kingdom, and the earl of
Kildare and others, commissioners of Ireland.

An entrance was made from the river through the wall into the Temple
Garden, and his majesty was received on his landing from the barge by
the reader and the lord chief justice of the Common Pleas, whilst the
path from the garden to the hall was lined with the readers' servants in
scarlet cloaks and white tabba doublets, and above them were ranged the
benchers, barristers, and students of the society, "the loud musick
playing from the time that his majesty landed till he entered the hail,
where he was received with xx. violins." Dinner was brought up by fifty
of the young gentlemen of the society in their gowns, "who gave their
attendance all dinner-while, none other appearing in the hall but
themselves."

On the 3rd of November following, his royal highness the duke of York,
the duke of Buckingham, the earl of Dorset, and Sir William Morrice,
secretary of state, were admitted members of

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

the society of the Inner Temple, the duke of York being called to the
bar and bench. <span id="fr_603"></span>[\*](#fn_602.md)

In 8 Car. II., A.D. 1668, Sir William Turner, lord mayor of London, came
to the readers’ feast in the Inner Temple with his sword and mace and
external emblems of civic authority, which was considered to be an
affront to the society, and the lord mayor was consequently very roughly
handled by some of the junior members of the Temple. His worship
complained to the king, and the matter was inquired into by the council,
as appears from the following proceedings:--

"At the Courte att Whitehall, the 7th April, 1669,

"Whereas, it was ordered the 31st of March last, that the complaints of
the lord maior of the city of London concerneing personall indignities
offered to his lordshippe and his officers when he was lately invited to
dine with the reader of the Inner Temple, should this day have a further
hearing, and that Mr. Hodges, Mr. Wyn, and Mr. Mundy, gentlemen of the
Inner Temple, against whome particular complaint was made, sshould
appeare att the board, when accordingly, they attendinge, and both
parties being called in and heard by their counsell learned, and
affidavits haveing been read against the said three persons, accuseing
them

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

to have beene the principall actors in that disorder, to which they
haveing made their defence, and haveing presented severall affidavits to
justifie their carriage that day, though they could not extenuate the
faults of others who in the tumult affronted the lord maior and his
officers; and the officers of the lord maior, who was alleaged to have
beene abused in the tumult, did not charge it upon anie of their
particular persons; upon consideration whereof it appeareing to his
majestie that the matter dependinge very much upon the right and
priviledge of beareing up the lord major's sword within the Temple,
which by order of this board of the 24th of March last is left to be
decided by due proceedings of lawe in the courts of Westminster Hall;
his majestie therefore thought fitt to suspend the declaration of his
pleasure thereupon until the said right and priviledge shall
accordinglie be determined att lawe."

On the 4th of November, 14 Car. II., his highness Rupert prince
palatine, Thomas earl of Cleveland, Jocelyn lord Percy, John lord
Berkeley of Stratton, with Henry and Bernard Howard of Norfolk, were
admitted members of the fellowship of the Inner Temple. <span

We must now close our remarks on the Temple, with a short account of the
quarrel with Dr. Micklethwaite, the *custos* or guardian of the Temple
Church.

After the Hospitallers had been put into possession of the Temple by
king Edward the Third, the prior and chapter of that order, appointed to
the antient and honourable post of *custos*, and the priest who occupied
that office, had his diet in one or other of the halls of the two law
societies, in the same way as the guardian priest of the order of the
Temple formerly had his diet in the hall of the antient Knights
Templars. He took his place, as did also the chaplains, by virtue of the
appointment of the

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

prior and chapter of the Hospital, without admission, institution or
induction, for the Hospitaliers were clothed with the privileges, as
well as with the property, of the Knights Templars, and were exempt from
episcopal jurisdiction. The *custos* had, as before mentioned, by grant
from the prior and chapter of the order of St. John, one thousand
faggots a year to keep up the fire in the church, and the rents of
Ficketzfeld and Cotterell Garden to be employed in improving the lights
and providing for the due celebration of divine service. From two to
three chaplains were also provided by the Hospitaliers, and nearly the
same ecclesiastical establishment appears to have been maintained by
them, as was formerly kept up in the Temple by the Knights Templars. In
21 Hen. VII. these priests had divers lodgings in the Temple, on the
east side of the churchyard, part of which were let out to the students
of the two societies.

By sections 9 and 10 of the act 32 *Hen*. VIII., dissolving the order of
the Hospital of St. John, it is provided that William Ermsted, clerk,
the *custos* or guardian of the Temple Church, who is there styled
"Master of the Temple," and Walter Limseie and John Winter, chaplains,
should receive and enjoy, during their lives, all such mansion-houses,
stipends, and wages, and all other profits of money, in as large or
ample a manner as they then lawfully had the same, the said Master and
chaplains of the Temple doing their duties and services there, as they
had previously been accustomed to do, and letters patent confirming them
in their offices and pensions were to be made out and passed under the
great seal. This appellation of "Master of the Temple," which antiently
denoted the superior of the proud and powerful order of Knights Templars
in England, the counsellor of kings and princes, and the leader of
armies, was incorrectly applied to the mere *custos* or guardian of the
Temple Church. The act makes no provision for the *successors* of the
*custos* and

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

chaplains, and Edward the Sixth consequently, after the decease of
William Ermsted, conveyed the lodgings, previously appropriated to the
officiating ministers, to a Mr. Keilway and his heirs, after which the
custos and clergymen had no longer *of right* any lodgings at all in the
Temple. <span id="fr_605"></span>[\*](#fn_604.md)

From the period of the dissolution of the order of Saint John, down to
the present time, the *custos*, or, as he is now incorrectly styled,
"the Master of the Temple," has been appointed by letters patent from
the crown, and takes his place as in the olden time, without the
ceremony of admission, institution, or induction. These letters patent
are couched in very general and extensive terms, and give the *custos*
or Master many things to which he is justly entitled, as against the
crown, but no longer obtains, and profess to give him many other things
which the crown had no power whatever to grant. He is appointed, for
instance, "to rule, govern, and superintend the house of the New
Temple;" but the crown had no power whatever to make him governor
thereof, the government having always been in the hands of the Masters
of the bench of the two societies, who succeeded to the authority of the
Master and chapter of the Knights Templars. In these letters patent the
Temple is described as a rectory, which it never had been, nor anything
like it. They profess to give to the *custos* "all and all manner of
tythes," but there were no tythes to give, the Temple having been
specially exempted from tythe as a religious house by numerous papal
bulls. The letters patent give the *custos* all the revenues and profits
of money which the *custodes* had at any time previously enjoyed by
virtue of their office, but these revenues were dissipated by the crown,
and the property formerly granted by the prior and chapter of Saint
John, and by pious persons in the time of the Templars, for the
maintenance of the priests and the celebration

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

of divine service in the Temple Church was handed over to strangers, and
the *custos* was thrown by the crown for support upon the voluntary
contributions of the two societies. He received, indeed, a miserable
pittance of 37*l*. 6*s*. 8*d*. per annum from the exchequer, but for
this he was to find at his own expense a minister to serve the church,
and also a clerk or sexton!

As the crown retained in its own hands the appointment of the *custos*
and all the antient revenues of the Temple Church, it ought to have
provided for the support of the officiating ministers, as did the
Hospitaliers of Saint John.

"The chardges of the fellowshyppe," says the MS. account of the Temple
written in the reign of Hen. VIII., "towards the salary or mete and
drink of the priests, is none; for they are found by my lord of Saint
John's, and they that are of the fellowshyppe of the house are chardged
with nothing to the priests, saving that they have eighteen offring days
in the yeare, so that the chardge of each of them is xviii*d*." <span
id="fr_606"></span>[\*](#fn_605.md)

In the reign of James the First, the *custos*, Dr. Micklethwaite, put
forward certain unheard-of claims and pretensions, which led to a
rupture between him and the two societies. The Masters of the bench of
the society of the Inner Temple, taking umbrage at his proceedings,
deprived the doctor of his place at the dinner-table, and "willed him to
forbear the hall till he was sent for." In 8 Car. I., A.D. 1633, the
doctor presented a petition to the king, in which he claims precedence
within the Temple "according to auncient custome, he being master of the
house," and complains that "his place in the hall is denyed him and his
dyett, which place the Master of the Temple hath ever had both before
the profession of the lawe kept in the Temple and ever since, whensoever
be came into the hall. That tythes are not payde him, whereas by pattent
he is to have *omnes et omnimodas decimas*. . . .

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That they denye
all ecclesiastical jurisdiction to the Master of the Temple, who is
appointed by the king's majesty master and warden of the house *ad
regendum, gubernandum, et officiendum domum et ecclesiam*," &c. The
doctor goes into a long list of grievances showing the little authority
that he possessed in the Temple, that he was not summoned to the
deliberations of the houses, and he complains that "they will give him
no consideracion in the Inner House for his supernumerarie sermons in
the forenoon, nor for his sermons in the afternoon," and that the
officers of the Inner Temple are commanded to disrespect the Master of
the Temple when he comes to the hall."

The short answer to the doctor's complaint is, that the *custos* of the
church never had any of the things which the doctor claimed to be
entitled to, and it was not in the power of the crown to give them to
him.

The antient *custos* being, as before mentioned, a priest of the order
of the Temple, and afterwards of the order of the Hospital, was a
perfect slave to his temporal superiors, and could be deprived of his
post, be condemned to a diet of bread and water, and be perpetually
imprisoned, without appeal to any power, civil or ecclesiastical, unless
he could cause his complaints to be brought to the ear of the pope. Dr.
Micklethwaite quite misunderstood his position in the Temple, and it was
well for him that the masters of the benches no longer exercised the
despotic power of the antient master and chapter, or he would certainly
have been condemned to the penitential cell in the church, and would not
have been the first *custos* placed in that unenviable retreat. <span
id="fr_607"></span>[\*](#fn_606.md)

The petition was referred to the lords of the council, and afterwards to
Noy, the attorney-general, and in the mean time the

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

doctor locked up the church and took away the keys. The societies
ordered fresh keys to be made, and the church to be set open. Noy, to
settle all differences, appointed to meet the contending parties in the
church, and then alluding to the pretensions of the doctor, he declared
that if he were *visitor* he would proceed against him *tanquam elatus
et superbus*.

In the end the doctor got nothing by his petition.

In the time of the Commonwealth, after Dr. Micklethwaite's death, Oliver
Cromwell sent to inquire into the duties and emoluments of the post of
"Master of the Temple," as appears from the following letter:--

"From his highness I was commanded to speake with you for resolution aid
satisfaction in theise following particulers--

"1. Whether the Master of the Temple be to be putt in him by way of
presentation, or how?

"2. Whether he be bound to attend and preach among them in terme times
and out of terme?

"3. Or if out of terme an assistant must be provided? then, whether at
the charge of the Master, or how otherwise?

"4. Whether publique prayer in the chapell be allwayes performable by
the Master himselfe in terme times? And whether in time of vacation it
be constantly expected from himselfe or his assistant.

"5. What the certain revenue of the Master is, and how it arises?

"2. Sir, the gentleman his highness intends to make Master is Mr.
Resburne of Oundle, a most worthy and learned man, pastor of the church
there, whereof I myselfe am an unworthy member.

"3. The church would be willing (for publique good) to spare him in
terme times, but will not part with him altogether. And in some of the
particulers aforementioned Mr. R. is very desirous to be satisfyd; his
highness chiefly in the first.

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

"4. I begg of you to leave a briefe answer to the said particulars, and
I shall call on your servant for it.

"For the honourable Henry Scobell, esq., theise." <span
id="fr_608"></span>[\*](#fn_607.md)

During the late repair of the Temple Church, A.D. 1830, the workmen
discovered an antient seal of the order of the Hospital, which was
carried away, and appears to have got into the hands of strangers. On
one side of it is represented the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem, with the
Saviour in his tomb. At his head is an elevated cross, and above is a
tabernacle or chapel, from the roof of which depend two incense pots.
Around the seal is the inscription, "FR------ BERENGARII CUSTOS PAUPERUM
HOSPITALIS JHERUSALEM." On the reverse a holy man is represented on his
knees in the attitude of prayer before a patriarchal cross, on either
side of which are the letters *Alpha* and *Omega*. Under the first
letter is a star.

These particulars have been furnished me by Mr. Savage, the architect.
