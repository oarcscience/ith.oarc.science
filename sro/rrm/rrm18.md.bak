### CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH

#### INQUIRY AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MIRACLE

THE definition of a miracle has been exposed to numerous erroneous
views. Inquirers know not what a miracle is. It is wrong to assume that
nature and human nature are alike invariably, and that you can,
interpret the one by the other. There may be in reality great divergence
between the two, though both start from the common point--individuality.
A miracle is not a violation of the laws of nature (because nature is
not everything), but a something independent of all laws--that is, *as
we know laws*. The mistake that is so commonly made is the
interpreting--or rather the perceiving, or the becoming aware of--that
thing we denominate a miracle through the operation of the human senses,
which in reality have nothing whatever to do with a miracle, because
they cannot know it. If nature, as we understand it, or law, as we
understand it, be universal, then, as nothing can be possible to us
which contradicts either the one or the other (both being the
same)--nature being law, and law being nature--miracle must be
impossible, and there never was, nor could there ever be, such a thing
as a miracle. But a miracle works outwardly from us at once, and not by
a human path--moves away from the world (that is, man’s world) as a
thing impossible to it, though it may be true none the less, since our
nature is not all nature; nor perhaps any nature, but even a
philosophical delusion. In the conception of a miracle; however, the
thing apprehended

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

revolves to us, and can come to us in no other way, and we seize the
idea of it through a machinery--our own judgment--which is a clear,
sight compounded of our senses--a synthesis of senses that, in the very
act of presenting an impossible idea, destroys it as *humanly* possible.
Miracle can be of no date or time, whether earlier, whether later, if
God has not withdrawn from nature; and if He has withdrawn from nature,
then nature must have before this fallen to pieces of itself; for God is
intelligence--not life only; and matter is not intelligent, though it
may be living. It is not seen that during that space--which is a space
taken out of time, though independent of it--in which miracle is
possible to us, we cease to be men, because time, or rather sensation,
is man’s measure; and that when we are men again, and back in ourselves,
the miracle is gone, because the conviction of the possibility of a
thing and its non-possibility has expelled it. The persuasion of a
miracle is intuition, or the operation of God’s Spirit active in us,
that drives out nature for the time, which is the opposite of the
miracle.

No miracle can be justified to men’s minds, because no amount of
evidence can sustain it; no number of attestations can affirm that which
we cannot in our nature believe. In reality, we believe nothing of which
our senses do not convince us--even these not always. In other matters,
we only believe *because we think we believe;* and since the conviction
of a miracle has nothing of God except the certain sort of motive of
possessed, excluding exaltation, which, *with the miracle*, fills us,
and to which exaltation we can give no name, and which we can only feel
as a certain something in us, a certain power and a certain light,
conquering and outshining another light, become fainter--it will follow
that the conviction of the

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

possibility of a miracle is the same sort of unquestioning assurance
that we have of a dream *in the dream itself*; and that, when the
miracle is apprehended in the mind, it just as much ceases to be a
miracle when we are in our senses, as a dream ceases to be that which it
was, a reality, and becomes that which it is, nonentity, when we awake.
But to the questions, what is a dream?--nay, what is waking?--who shall
answer? or who can declare whether in that broad outside, where our
minds and their powers evaporate or cease, where nature melts away into
nothing that we can know as nature, or know as anything else, in regard
to dreams and realities, the one may not be the other? The dream may be
man’s life to him--as another life other than his own life--and the
reality may be the dream (in its various forms), which he rejects as
false and confusion simply because it is as an unknown language, of
which, out of his dream, he can never have the alphabet, but of which,
in the dream, he has the alphabet, and can spell well because *that*
life is natural to him.

'A pretence that every strong and peculiar expression is merely an
Eastern hyperbole is a mighty easy way of getting rid of the trouble of
deep thought and right apprehension, and has helped to keep the world in
ignorance.'--*Morsels of Criticism*, London, 1800.

It is very striking that, in all ages, people have clothed the ideas of
their dreams in the same imagery. It may therefore be asked whether that
language, which now occupies so low a place in the estimation of men; be
not the actual waking language of the higher regions, while we, awake as
we fancy ourselves, may be sunk in a 'sleep of many thousand years, or
at least, in the echo of their dreams, and only intelligibly catch a few
dim words of that language of God, as sleepers do scattered expressions
from the

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

loud conversation of those around them'. So says Schubert, in his
*Symbolism of Dreams*. There is every form of the dream-state, from the
faintest to the most intense, in which the gravitation of the outside
world overwhelms the man-senses, and absorbs the inner unit. *In fact,
the lightest and faintest form of dream is the very thoughts that we
think*.

A very profound English writer, Thomas de Quincey, has the following:
'In the English rite of Confirmation, by personal choice, and by
sacramental oath, each man says, in effect: "Lo! I rebaptize myself; and
that which once was sworn on my behalf, now I swear for myself." Even so
in dreams, perhaps, under some secret conflict of the midnight sleeper,
lighted up to consciousness at the time, but darkened to the memory as
soon as all is finished, each several child of our mysterious race may
complete for himself the aboriginal fall.'

As to what is possible or impossible, no man, out of his presumption and
of his self-conceit, has any right to speak, nor can he speak; for the
nature of his terms with all things outside of him is unknown to him. We
know that miracle (if once generally believed in) would terminate the
present order of things, which are perfectly right and consistent in
their own way. Things that contradict nature are not evoked by reason,
but by man in his miracle-worked imagining, in all time; and such
exceptions are independent of reason, which elaborates to a centre
downwards, but exhales to apparent impossibilty (but to real truth)
upwards, that is, truth out of this world.

Upwards has nothing of man; for it knows him not. He ceases there; but
he is made as downwards, and finds his man’s nature there, lowest of
all--his mere bodily nature there perhaps, even to be found originally
among the four-footed; for by the raising

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

of him by God alone has Man got upon his feet, and set his face upward
to regard the stars--those stars which originally, according to the
great 'Hermes Trismegistus' (Thrice-Master), in the astrological sense,
raised him from the primeval level; for we refer heaven always to a
place over our heads, since there only we can be free of the
confinements of matter; but above us or below us is equally the.
altitude.

May not the sacrificial, sacramental rites--may not those minute acts of
priestly offering, as they succeed each other, and deepen in intensity
and in meaning--may not those aids of music to enlarge and change and
conjure the sense of hearing, and to react on sight (it being notorious
that object's change their character really as we look at them when
operated upon by beautiful music)--may not those dream-producing,
somnolent, enchanting vapours of incense, which seem to loosen from
around each of us the walls of the visible, and to charm open the body,
and to let out (or to let in) new and unsuspected senses, alight with a
new light not of this world, the light of a new spiritual world, in
which we can yet see things, and see them as things to be
recognized--may not all this be true, and involve impossibilities as
only seeming so, but true enough; inasmuch as miracle possibly is true
enough?

May not all these effects, and may not the place and the persons in the
body, and may not the suggestions, labouring to that end, of unseen,
unsuspected, holy ministries, such as thronging angels, casting off from
about us our swathes and bands of thick mortality in the new,
overmastering influence--may not all this be as the bridge across which
we pass out from this world gladly into the next, until we meet, as on
the other side, Jesus, the Ruler in very deed, but now felt as the
Offered, the Crucified, the complete

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

and accepted 'Living Great Sacrifice'? May we not in *this* 'Eucharist'
partake, not once, but again and again, of that--even of that
solid-which was our atonement, and of that blood which was poured out as
the libation to the 'Great Earth', profaned by 'Sin', partaking of that
reddest (but that most transcendently lucent) sacrament, which is to be
the new light of a new world? Is not the very name of the
intercommunicating High-Priest that of the factor. of this mystic,
glorious, spirit-trodden, invisible 'bridge'? Whence do we derive the
word *Pontifex*, or *Pontifex Maximus* (the Great, or the Highest,
Bridge-Maker, or Builder), elicited in direct translation from the two
Latin words *pons* and *facio* in the earliest pre-Christian theologies,
and become 'Pontiff' in the Roman and the Christian sense--'Pontiff'
from 'Pontifex'?

It is surely this meaning--that of fabricator or maker of the bridge
between things sensible and things spiritual, between body and spirit,
between this. world and the next world, between the spiritualizing
'thither' and the substantiating 'hither', *trans* being the transit.
The whole word, if not the whole meaning, may be accepted in this Roman
Catholic sense of 'transubstantiation', or the making of miracle. Never
'Idolatry'--but 'Idea' recognizing and acknowledging.
