# Preface to the First Edition

THIS book, which now leaves our hands, concentrates in a small compass
-the results of very considerable labour, and the diligent study of very
many books in languages living and dead. it purports to be a history
(for the first time treated seriously in English) of the famous Order of
the 'Rose-Cross', or of the 'Rosicrucians'. No student of the occult
philosophy need, however, fear that we shall not most carefully keep
guard--standing sentry (so to speak) not only over this, which is, by
far, the pre-eminent, but also over those other recondite systems which
are connected with the illustrious Rosicrucians.

An accomplished author of our own period has remarked that 'He who deals
in the secrets of magic, or in the secrets of the human mind, is too
often looked upon with jealous eyes by the world, which is no great
conjuror.'

How is it that, after centuries of doubt or denial--how happens it, in
face of the reason that can make nothing of it, the common sense that
rejects, and the science which can demonstrate it as impossible, the
supernatural still has such vital hold in the human--not to say in the
modern--mind? How happens it that the most terrible fear is the fear of
the invisible?--this, too, when we are on all hands assured that the
*visible* alone is that which we have to dread! The ordinary reason
exhorts us to dismiss our fears. That thing 'magic', that superstition
'miracle', is

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

now banished wholly from the beliefs of this clear-seeing, educated age.
'Miracle', we are told, never had a place in the world--only in men’s
delusions. It is nothing more than a fancy. It never was anything more
than a superstition arising from ignorance.

What is fear? It is a shrinking from possible harm, either to the body,
or to that thing which we denominate the mind that is in us. The body
shrinks with instinctive nervous alarm, like the sensitive leaf, when
its easy, comfortable exercise or sensations are disturbed.

Our book, inasmuch as it deals--or *professes* to deal--seriously with
strange things and with deep mysteries, needs the means of
interpretation in the full attention of the reader: otherwise, little
will be made, or can come, of it. It is, in brief, a history of the
alchemical philosophers, written with a serious explanatory purpose, and
for the first time impartially stated since the days of James. the First
and Charles the First. This is really what the book pretends to be--and
nothing more. It should be mentioned that the peculiar views and
deductions to be found herein were hinted at as demonstrable for the
first time by the same Author in the year 1858, when a work entitled
*Curious Things of the Outside World* was produced.

Let it be understood, however, that the Author distinctly excepts
against being in any manner identified with *all* the opinions religious
or otherwise, which are to be found in this book. Some of them are,
indeed, most extraordinary; but, in order to do full justice to the
speculations of the Hermetic Brethren, he has put forward their ideas
with as much of their original- force as he was able; and, in some parts
of his book, he believes he has urged them with such apparent warmth,
that they, will very likely seem to

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

have been his own most urgent convictions. As far as he can. succeed in
being so considered, the Author wishes to be regarded simply as the
Historian of, the Rosicrucians, or as an Essayist on their strange,
mysterious beliefs.

Whether he will succeed in engaging the attention of modern readers to a
consideration of this time-honoured philosophy remains to be seen; but
this he is assured of, that the admiration of all students and
reflective minds will be excited by the unrivalled powers of thinking of
the Rosicrucians. The application, proper or otherwise, of these powers
is a matter altogether beside the present inquiry.

The Author has chiefly chosen for exposition the Latin writings of the
great English Rosicrucian, Robert Flood, or Fludd (Robertus de
Fluctibus), who lived in the times of James the First and Charles the
First.

Our final remarks shall be those of a very famous Brother of the 'R.C.',
writing under the date of 1653: 'I will now cloze up', saith he, 'with
the doxology of a most excellent, renowned Philocryphus:

*Soli Deo Laus et Potentia!*

*Amen in MERCURIO, qui pedibus licet carens decurrit AQUA, et metallice
universaliter operatur*.'

LONDON, *January* 20*th*, 1870
