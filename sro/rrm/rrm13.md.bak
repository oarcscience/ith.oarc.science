### CHAPTER THE NINTH

#### SACRED FIRE

THE appearance of God to mortals seems always to have been in brightness
and great glory, whether He was angry and in displeasure, or benign and
kind. These appearances are often mentioned in Scripture. When God
appeared on Mount Sinai, it is said 'The Lord descended upon it in Fire'
(*Exod*. xix. 18). And when Moses repeats the history of this to the
children of Israel, he says 'The Lord spake unto you out of the midst of
the Fire' (*Deut*. iv. 12). So it was when the Angel of the Lord
appeared to Moses in a flame of fire out of the midst of the bush: 'The
bush burned with Fire, and the bush was not consumed' (*Exod*. iii. 3).
The appearances of the Angel of God’s presence, or that Divine Person
who represented God; were always in brightness; or, in other words, the
Shechinah was always surrounded with glory. This seems to have given
occasion to those of old to imagine fire to be what God dwelt in.

'Ipse' (Darius) 'solem Mithren, sacrumque et æternum invocans IGNEM, ut
illis dignam vetere gloria majoremque monumentis fortitudinem
inspirarent.'--Q. Curtius, l. iv. c. 13.

Whether it was that any fire preceded from God, and burnt up the
oblation in the first sacrifices, as some ingenious men have
conjectured, we know not. It is certain that in after ages this was the
case. We are sure that a fire from the Lord consumed upon the altar the
burnt-offering of Aaron (*Lev*. ix. 24); and so it did

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

the sacrifice of Gideon, 'both the flesh and the unleavened cakes'
(*Judg*. vi. 21). When David 'built an altar unto the Lord, and offered
burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon the Lord, He
answered him from heaven by Fire, upon the altar of burnt-offerings' (*1
Chron*. xxi. 26). The same thing happened at the dedication of Solomon's
temple: 'The fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt-offering
and the sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the house' (*2
Chron*. vii. 1). And much about a hundred years afterwards, when Elijah
made that extraordinary sacrifice in proof that Baal was no god, 'The
Fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood,
and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the
trench' (*1 Kings* xviii. 38). And if we go back long before the times
of Moses, as early as Abraham's days, we meet with an instance of the
same sort: 'It came to pass that when the sun went down, and it was
dark, behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp, that passed between
these pieces' (*Gen*. xv. 17).

The first appearance of God, then, being in glory--or, which is the same
thing, in light or fire--and He showing His acceptance of sacrifices in
so many instances, by consuming them with fire, hence it was that the
Eastern people, and particularly the Persians, fell into the worship of
fire itself, or rather they conceived fire to be the symbol of God’s
presence-, and they worshipped God in, or by, fire. From the Assyrians,
or Chaldæans, or Persians, this worship was propagated southwards among
the Egyptians, and westward among the Greeks; and by them it was brought
into Italy. The Greeks were wont to meet together to worship in their
*Prytaneia*, and there they consulted for the public good; and there was
a. constant fire kept upon the altar, which was dignified

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

by the name of Vesta, by some. The fire itself was properly Vesta; and
so Ovid:

Nec te aliud Vestam, quam vivam intelligere flammam.

The *Prytaneia* were the *atria* of the temples, wherein a fire was kept
that was never suffered to go. out. On the change in architectural forms
from the pyramidal (or the horizontal) to the obeliscar (or the upright,
or vertical), the flames were transferred from the altars, or cubes, to
the summits of the typical uprights, or towers; or to the tops of the
candles, such as we see them used now in Catholic worship, and which are
called 'tapers', from their tapering or pyramidal form, and which,
wherever they are seen or raised, are supposed always to indicate the
divine presence or influence. This, through the symbolism that there is
in the living light, which is the last exalted show of fluent or of
inflamed brilliant matter, passing off beyond into the unknown and
unseen world of celestial light (or occult fire), to which all the forms
of things tend, and in which even idea itself passes from recognition as
meaning, and evolves--spiring, as all flame does, to escape and to wing
away.

Vesta, or the fire, was worshipped in circular temples, which were the
images or the miniatures, of the 'temple' of the world, with its dome,
or cope, of stars. It was in the atria of the temples, and in the
presence of, and before the above-mentioned lights, that the forms of
ceremonial worship .were always observed. It is certain that Vesta was
worshipped at Troy; and Æneas brought her into Italy

      manibus vittas, Vestamque potentem,  
Æternumque adytis effert penetralibas Ignem.  
                                     --*Æneid* ii. 296.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Numa settled an
order of Virgin Priestesses, whose

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

business and care it was constantly to maintain the holy fire. And long
before Numa's days, we find it not only customary, but honourable, among
the Albans to appoint the best-born virgins to be priestesses of Vesta,
and to keep up the constant, unextinguished fire.

When Virgil speaks (*Æneid* iv. 200) of Iarbas, in Africa, as building a
hundred temples and a hundred altars, he says:

          vigilemque sacraverat Ignem,  
Excubias Divum æternas,

that he had 'consecrated a fire that never went out'. And he calls these
temples and these lights, or this fire, the 'perpetual watches', or
'watch-lights', or proof of the presence, of the gods. By which
expressions he means, that places and things were constantly protected,
and solemnized where such lights burned, and that the celestials, or
angel-defenders, 'camped', as it were, and were sure to be met with
thickly, where these flames upon the altars, and these torches or lights
about the temples, invited them and were studiously and incessantly
maintained.

Thus the custom seems to have been general from the earliest antiquity
to maintain a constant fire, as conceiving the gods present there. And
this was not only the opinion of the inhabitants in Judæa, but it
extended all over Persia, Greece, Italy, Egypt, and most other nations
of the world.

Porphyry imagined that the 'reason why the most ancient mortals kept up
a constant, ever-burning fire in honour of the immortal Gods, was
because Fire was most like the Gods. He says that the ancients kept an
unextinguished fire in their temples to the Gods, because it was most
like them. Fire was not like the Gods, but it was what they appeared in
to

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

mortals. And so the true God always appeared in brightness and glory,
yet no one would say that brightness was most like the true God, but was
most like the Shechinah, in which God appeared. And hence the custom
arose of keeping up an unextinguished fire in the ancient temples.

Vesta is properly an Oriental word, derived from the Hebrew ‏אש‎,
*As*--'Fire'. Thence the word Astarte, in the Phœnician dialect. The
signification of the term is the same as the πῦρ ἄσβεστον, the *ignis
æternus*, the perpetual fire itself. They that worshipped either Vesta
or Vulcan, or the master-power of nature which is known under those
names, were properly Fire-worshippers.

God, then, being wont to appear in Fire, and being conceived to dwell in
Fire, the notion spread universally, and was universally admitted.
First, then, it was not at all out of the way to think of engaging in
friendship with God by the same means as they contracted friendship with
one another. And since they to whom God appeared saw Him appear in Fire,
and they acquainted others with such His appearances, He was conceived
to dwell in Fire. By degrees, therefore, the world came to be
over-curious in the fire that was constantly to be kept up, and in
things to be sacrificed; and they proceeded from one step to another,
till at length they filled up the measure of their aberration, which was
in reality instigated by their zeal, and by their intense desire to
mitigate the displeasure of their divinities--for religion was much more
intense as a feeling in early days--by passing into dreadful ceremonies
in regard to this fire, which they reverenced as the last possible
physical form of divinity, not only in its grandeur and power, but also
in its purity. It arose from this view that human sacrifices came to be
offered to the deities in many

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

parts of the world, particularly in Phœnicia, and in the colonies
derived from thence into Africa and other places. In the intensity of
their minds, children were sacrificed by their parents, as being the,
best and dearest oblation that could be made, and the strongest
arguments that nothing ought to. be withheld from God. This was
expiation for that sad result, the consequence of the original curse,
issuing from the fatal curiosity concerning the bitter fruit of that
forbidden 'Tree',

                whose mortal taste  
Brought death into the world, and all our woe,  
With loss of Eden,

according to Milton. That peculiar natural sense of shame in all its
forms lesser and larger, and with all the references inseparably allied
to propagation in all its multitudinous cunning (so to speak), wherever
the condemned material tissues reach, puzzled the thoughtful ancients as
to its meaning. This they considered the convicted 'Adversary', or
Lucifer, 'Lord of light'--that is, material Light', 'Eldest Son of the
Morning'. Morning, indeed! dawning with its light from behind that
forbidden Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. What is this shame,
urged the philosophers, this reddening, however good and beautiful, and
especially the ornament of the young and inexperienced and of children,
who are newest from the real, glowing countenance of Deity, with the
bloom of the first angelic word scarcely yet fading from off their
cherub faces, gradually darkening and hardening in the degradation and
iniquity of being here as presences in this world, although the most
glorious amidst the forms of flesh? What is this shame, which is the
characteristic singly of human creatures? All other creatures are
sinless in

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

this respect, and know not the feeling of that--correctly looked
at--strange thing which men call 'shame', something which is not right
that the sun even should see, and therefore stirring the blood, and,
reddening the face, and confusing the speech, and causing man to hang
down his head, and to hide himself, as if guilty of something: even as
our guilty first parents, having lost the unconsciousness of their
child-like, innocent first state--that of sinless virginity--hid
themselves and shunned their own light in the umbrage of Paradise, all
at once convicted to the certainty that they must hide, because they
were exposed, and that they had themselves broken that original
intention regarding them.

'Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not, for of
such is the kingdom of heaven'.

That is, the innocent children should come up for salvation, who, though
suffering under the mortal liability incurred by all flesh in that first
sin (and incident in the first fall, which has empoisoned and cursed all
nature), are yet free by the nature of their ungrown possibility, and
from their unconsciousness of it. They know not the shame of the
condition adult, and therefore they bear not the badge of men, and are
not of this world really, but of another world.

To recur for a moment to the theory of human sacrifices which once
largely prevailed. Interwoven inseparably with the forms of architecture
from the earliest times, proof of which we see constantly in classical
buildings particularly, and in the Italian modifications displayed in
the cities of Europe, was the habit of exposing as talismans the members
(and particularly the heads) of human sacrifices. This is observable in
the innumerable masks (or heads full-faced) placed on the keystones of
arches or portals. They are either deified mortals or demigods. Some-

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

times, but very rarely (because it is, a sinister *palladium*),the head
of Medusa is seen. Exposure of the heads of criminals on town-gates,
over bridges, or over arches, follows the same idea, as ranging in the
list of protecting, protesting, or appealing *Palladia*, which are
supposed to possess the same objurgating or propitiating power as the
wild, winged creatures--children of the air--affixed in penitential,
magic brand or exposure on the doors of barns, or on the outside of
rustic buildings. All this is ceremonial sacrifice, addressed to the
harmful gods, and meant occultly and entreatingly for the eyes of the
observant, but invisible, wandering angels, who move through the
world--threading unseen the ways of men, and unwitted of by them, and
most abundant and most active there where the mother of all of them is
in the ascendant with her influences; or when Night is abroad, throned
in her cope of stars--letters, from their first judiciary arrangement in
the heavens, spelling out continually new astrological combinations. For
Astrology. was the mother, as she was the precursor, of Astronomy, and
was once a power; into whatever mean roads the exercise of the art of
her servants has strayed now, in unworthy and indign divination, and in
the base proffer of supposed Gipsy arts--ministration become ridiculous
(or made so), which was once mighty and sublime.

The pyramidal or triangular form which Fire assumes in its ascent to
heaven is in the monolithic typology used to signify the great
generative power. We have only to look at Stonehenge, Ellora, the
Babel-towers of Central America, the gigantic ruins scattered all over
Tartary and India, to see how gloriously they symbolized the majesty of
the Supreme. To these uprights, disks, or *lithoi*, of the old world,
including the *Bethel*, or Jacob's Pillar, or Pillow, raised in the

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

Plain of 'Luz', we will add, as the commemorative or reminding shape of
the fire, the Pyramids of Egypt, the Millenarius, Gnomon, Mete-Stone, or
Mark, called 'London Stone', all Crosses raised at the junction of four
roads, all Market-Crosses, the *Round Towers of Ireland*, and, in all
the changeful aspects of their genealogy, all spires and towers, in
their grand hieroglyphic proclamation, all over the world. All these are
*Phalli*, and express a sublime meaning.

(♈) Aries, (♉) Taurus, (♊) Gemini, (♋) Cancer, (♌) Leo, (♍) Virgo, are
the first six 'Signs'; and they collectively (in their annual
succession) form 'the Macrocosmos' of the Cabalists. Then succeeds the
'turning-point', 'balances', or 'nave' (*navel*), of the astronomical
wheel, represented by the sign 'Libra' (♎), which, be it remembered, was
added by the imaginative (and therefore practically inventive) Greeks.
The foregoing, up to 'Libra', represent the 'ascending signs', or six of
the spokes, so to speak, of the annual zodiacal wheel, circling to the
zenith or vertex. The last six 'Signs' of the zodiac are called
'descending signs', and they are the sinister, autumnal, or changing, in
reverse, monthly spaces, each of thirty degrees, and again comprising
six *radii* of this celestial wheel, or this 'Ezekiel's Wheel'. The
turning-point is 'Virgo-Scorpio', which, until separated in the mythical
interruption from without at the 'junction-point' between ascent and
descent, were the same 'single sign'. The latter half (or left wing of
this grand zodiacal 'army', or 'host of heaven', drawn up in battle
array, and headed--as, by a figure, we shall choose to say--by the
'Archangel Michael', or the Sun, at the centre, or in the 'champion' or
'conquering point') is called by the Cabalists--and therefore by the
Rosicrucians--the abstract 'Microcosmos'--in which 'Microcosm', or
'Little World',

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

in opposition to the 'Macrocosm', or 'Great World', is to be found
'Man', as produced in it from the operations from above, and to be saved
in the 'Great Sacrifice' (Crucifixion-Act), the phenomena of the being
(Man) taking place 'in the mythic return. of the world'. All this is
incomprehensible, except in the strange mysticism of the Gnostics and
the Cabalists; and the whole theory requires a key of explanation to
render it intelligible; which key is only darkly referred to as
possible, but refused absolutely, by these extraordinary men, as not
permissible to be disclosed. As they, however, were very fond of
diagrams and mystic figures, of which they left many in those rarities
(mostly ill-executed, but each wonderfully suggestive) called Gnostic
gems ',we will supply a seeming elucidation of this their astrological
assumption of 'what was earliest'; for which see the succeeding figure.

(♎) Libra (the Balances) leads again off as the 'hinge-point,'
introducing the six winter signs, which are: (♎) Libra again, (♏)
Scorpio, (♐) Sagittarius, (♑) Capricornus, (♒) Aquarius, and (♓) Pisces.

by the celestial perpendicular, or descending ray, as thus: (Fig. 13).

The last six signs, or descending signs, are 'represented by the
terrestrial ground-line, or horizontal, or 'equatorial' (symbol or
*sigma*), as thus: (Fig. 14).

The union of these (at the intersection of these rays) at the
junction-point, or middle point, forms the 'Cross', as thus: (Fig
15-19).

In figure C, the union of fig. 16 and fig. 17 forms the cross. Fig. 18
is the mundane circle. Fig. 19 is the astronomical cross *upon* the
mundane circle. The union of fig. 18, fig. 17, and fig. 16, in this
respective order, gives the *crux-ansata*, so continual in all the
Egyptian sculptures, which mark or sign is also the symbol of the Planet
Venus, as below (Fig. 20, 21).

Their origin is thus traced clearly to the same original meanings, which
reappear .under all sorts of disguises, and are varied in innumerable
ingenious ways, in all

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

the mythologies--incessantly disclosing, and inviting, and as
continually evading and escaping discovery. This abstruse mark
particularly abounds in the Egyptian temples, where every object and
every figure presents it. Its real meaning is, however, intended to be
buried in profound darkness.

In regard to the mysteries implied in the Christian Cross, the
schismatics contended (1st) 'that Christ, alive upon the cross, humbled
Himself, *usque ad inferni tremenda tormenta*, even unto the dreadful
torments of hell'. (Paget's *Catech. Latin.*) (2nd) 'Endured for a time
those torments, *qualis reprobi in æternum sensuri sunt*, which the
reprobates shall everlastingly suffer in hell'. (Pisc. in *Luc*. xii.
10.) 'Even despaired of God’s mercy, finding God, at this time, *Non
patrem sed tyrannum*, not a Father, but a Tyrant: and overcame despair
by despair; death by death; hell by hell; and Satan by Satan' (Ferus *in
Matth*. 27): 'suffered actually all the torments of hell for our
redemption, and descended into the heaviest that hell could yield;
endured the torments of hell, the second death, abjection from God, and'
was made a curse; that is, had the bitter anguish of God’s wrath in his
soul and body, which is the fire that shall never be quenched'.--*Faith
and Doctrine* (Thomas Rogers), London, 1629. Jacob Böhmen produces some
of these most stringent and dark shades in his profound
mysticism--although essentially Christian.

It may be here distinctly mentioned that it is a mistake to suppose any
of the Egyptian hieroglyphics tell the story of that most profound and
most ancient religion. There are various series of hieroglyphics, more
or less reserved, but the real beliefs of the Egyptian Priest were never
(indeed, they *dared not* so have been hazarded in sigma, or writing, or
hieroglyphic of any kind--being forbidden

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

to be spoken, still more written. Consequently all supposed readings of
hieroglyphics are guesswork only--implying earnest and plausible but
mistaken effort alone.
