Hargrave Jennings was a nineteenth century English writer and occultist.
His vision of the inner knowledge of the Rosicrucians in this book is,
at its core, very similar to that of the left-hand [Tantric
path](../../tantra/index.md). In some ways he was very reactionary; for
instance, he rejects the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs and the
atomic theory of the elements. In other ways, he was far in advance of
his time in his concepts of the roles of gender and sexuality in the
quest for spiritual perfection.

You won't find much in the way of historical description of the
Rosicrucians here. Key Rosicrucian documents such as the Fama
Fraternatis, Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkrueutz and Confessio
Fraternatis (see Waite's [The Real History of the
Rosicrucians](../rhr/index).md) are not even mentioned. Nor will you find
any disclosure of inner secrets. Jennings constantly drops hints that he
knows more than he is letting on, but states up-front that he is not an
initiate. Jennings believed that the doctrines of the Rosicrucians were
derived from ancient phallic worship, and to a lesser extent fire and
serpent worship. In this book, Jennings constructs elaborate and
constantly shifting sets of correspondences. He tries to interrelate
huge sets of symbols and objects in his search for the elusive
Rosicrucians. This is not a mainstream concept of the Rosicrucian
doctrine, and contemporaries such as A.E. Waite summarily dismissed
Jennings' theories.

The book makes frustrating reading at times. Like his friend
Bulwer-Lytton, Jennings piles clause upon clause. Often he seems on the
verge of stream-of-consciousness automatic writing, walking the thin
boundaries between illumination, synesthesia and psychosis. Because of
Victorian sensibilities, he is unable to discuss aspects of sacred
sexuality without elaborate circumlocutions, resorting to French and
Latin when he needs to spell things out. Uncharacteristically for a book
of this vintage, there are almost no footnotes, and very little other
scholarly apparatus (although he occasionally gives elaborate
bibliographic citations in the body of the text).

He goes on about hats, flags, and heraldry, with digressions and
out-of-context asides. For instance, in [Part I, Chapter 18](rrm22.md), he
starts out with the color spectrum and its correspondence to the vowels,
suddenly veers into the question of evil, and ties the chapter up with a
note on the *Filioque*. He proposes bizarre etymologies, e.g. *Iona* ==
*Yoni*, that even in the 19th century would have been dismissed as bunk
(perhaps he is actually using esoteric phonetic resonances). And he is
definitely obsessed with spotting phallic symbols, both male and female,
*everywhere*.

This book dovetails with Hall's [Secret Teachings of All
Ages](../../eso/sta/index.md), although Hall is a lot more coherent and
organized. The two books cover a lot of the same ground such as eternal
flames, Alchemy, the Kabbalah, and so on. Jennings also wrote a number
of other books, primarily on phallic worship, including [The Masculine
Cross and Ancient Sex Worship](../../sex/asw/index.md), (also at online
sacred-texts), under odd pseudonyms such as 'Sha Rocco' and Abisha S.
Hudson.

Production Notes: Due to the huge number of small illustrations, where
multiple figures occurred on a page, I merged them into one image file.
This text uses Unicode for Greek, Hebrew and astrological signs; if you
