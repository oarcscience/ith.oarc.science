### CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH

#### THE PRE-ADAMITES. PROFOUND CABALISTIC OR ROSICRUCIAN SPECULATIONS

THE monastic or separate (sexual) state, where nature is ignored and its
suggestions and the indulgence of the seductive individual *appetite* is
held to be ruinous (to the spiritual aims of the human creature), is a
dangerous--nay, almost an impossible abnegation. From the spirit-side,
in this respect, nature is held abominable. Its practice is the shutting
of the heavenly door. Thus fleshly incitements are AWFUL; and yet--such
are the contradictions of nature--they are necessitated. We must 'whip'
the body, as it were, 'into wood' before we can drive the devil
therefrom. <span id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) We must fast and watch,
and watch and fast. We must reduce our robustness into leanness. Our
physical graceful, worthy or handsome 'selves', we must punish down into
everything that is incapable and pitiable. We must become *pitiless* in
our body's own maceration and mortification. Meanwhile (in faith, and in
reliance on the efficacy of our penances) we grow into
holiness-intensifying into SAINT-HOOD. The lights of the soul are to
shine through the rents and fractures of the flagellated and punished
body, until the fleshly sense or enchantment and enticement is
trampled-up, through the destruction of its *medium*, into *life other
than this life*.

But truly, in this view, the necessities--or rather the requirements--of
nature cannot be set at naught

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --cannot be
contended with. Religion evades this question. *Men* suffer to a very
grievous extent. To descend to realities in this living world of flesh
of ours. Farther, however, in natural arrangements. The most cruel
nervous disorders, such as the *furor uterinus*, hysteric spasms, and a
whole train of vengeful mischiefs, chiefly attack such women as have
throughout life *refused* the pleasures of love. Many fatal affections,
such as mania, epilepsy, and so on, prey upon those of *both sexes* who
have imposed upon themselves too severe refraining or bridling. This
incidence is ingrain in nature. But the dangers resulting from the abuse
of these amiable pleasures are much more formidable. Pp. 38, 39, of
*Curiositates Eroticæ Physiologiæ* (1875). Woman's physical constitution
adapts her for love. 'Excitements *more numerous*, and of more
*exquisite sense*, are *bestowed on Woman*'--Casanova, *Physiology*,
1865, p. 78, quoting from Swedenborg. 'Polarity of the Two
Sexes--*Vito-electro galvanic*. Attractive power is effected from
within'--Casanova (1865), p. 25. 'The slumber of the body seems to be
but the waking of the soul'--Grindon, on 'Life'--Casanova, *Physiology*,
p. 39. But (until proven) she is rigid, and to a certain extent (like
virgins usually) insensate, and even rebelliously irresponsive.

All the '*pittoresques*', to the number of twelve, invented by the Greek
courtesan Cyrene, as being the best in which to signalize that
particular loving mystery which has everything (enjoined) under it; all
those enchanting modes of sympathy which Phyleiris and Ashyanase
published, which Elephaseus composed in Leonine verse, and which
afterwards the Roman Emperor Nero caused to be painted on the Walls of
the Imperial Banquetting Hall, in his famous Golden Palace, by the first
artists of Rome, all these

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

prove that women are much better adepts in the *ars amandi* and its
mysteries than men--that they have a much keener relish for its
intricacies, to which they deliver themselves up--*with the chosen
object*--with a delight and *abandon unknown to man*. In short, in all
the solicitation of love, women are the most inventive, assiduous,
intense and persevering. Catherine the Second of Russia possessed
boundless power. She set no limits to her gratification in the sensual
respect. She was imperial and magnificent in her luxurious enormities.
Her will was law--she was the 'modern Messalina'; she richly earned the
title which was accorded to her of literally being (no small distinction
in its way) '*la piū futatrice nel mondo*'. But, on the other hand,
there were wonderful contradictions to this state of irregular
eagerness. Maria (Mariana) Coanel, wife of Juan de la Cerda, not being
able to bear the absence of her husband, preferred committing suicide to
yielding to the otherwise irresistible temptations of the flesh--as she
found them in their occasional assaults. The extraordinary
unconsciousness and ignorance of some women is remarkable--however rare;
especially in these, in some respects, scarcely modest, all-knowing
times. Isabella Gonzaga, the wife of the Duke of Urbino, passed two
years with her husband still remaining a virgin; and so great was her
ignorance of the matrimonial usage that, until enlightened, she had
imagined all married women lived as she lived; and she received the new
knowledge in all simplicity.

Greek pictorial and statuary art was suffused with ideas of matchless
and--of immortal beauty. The curves and undulation of form, the
enchanting and enchanted art which peopled Grecian landscapes with
shapes of ravishment and Greek temples with wonders: the eye that saw,
the hand that traced,

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

the taste that toned, the delicacy that softened--all was exquisite, all
was successful. The most intensely poetical and subduing (nay, the most
religious, moving one to tears), and the most gloriously beautiful
object in the whole universe, is the naked form of a symmetrical woman.
This is difficult to understand--but it is true. The reason may
be--sorrow that such a glorious object--Divinity's handiwork, as a
'present' to Man--should perish. Reflect upon matter immediately
following.

No wonder that the ancients made a woman (thus) in object of idolatry.
In the excess--in the super-excelling--of their refinement, other ideals
were reached. Beauty became *bifurcated* (so to express), and irregular;
heated as it were into a sinister--a devilish (*forbidden*) temptation,
for passion of taste. Excess, or a deviating superflux or *overdoing*,
of desire supervened. Longing became delirious: because 'Lucifer', or
the 'Lost One'--'Unchastened Presumption'--had passed his lightning-like
availing spear of *apotheosizing*, enchanted, tempting DEATH through the
transmuted 'human female body'; advanced and addressed in its snaring
graces to Hell’s perfectness.

The 'Sexes' were 'Two'. But 'Beauty' was 'One'. Beards have naught of
beauty, apart from strength. Beards are barbarous--hence their name.
Hair is of the beasts, '*excrementa*'; '*tentacula*'. The Greek artists
exercised their talents in the production of a kind of beauty mixed of
that of the 'Two Sexes', merging and blending the softness and
enchanting shapeliness of the one with the aggressive picturesque
roundness and boldness of the other. Each (separate) was the acmé of
picturelike propriety and grace. But the third 'Thing' was a 'New
Thing'--otherwise a miracle--a new sensation. Hence Paris, hence Adonis,

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

hence Ganymede, hence the loves of Salmacis and Hermaphroditus, hence
the 'feminine' Bacchus, hence Hylas--hence these deities, in tresses, of
neither sex, and yet of both. Greek art in this respect presents a
phenomenon. As a phenomenon we must recognize and regard it. The flower
is *supra-natural*, treasonous, and abhorrent. It is 'a flower of Hell'.
Nevertheless, it is a 'flower'. And thus the idea dominates the
*alternate 'shaded' and 'shining' halves* of the whole world; of all
art; of all philosophy; of all RELIGION. Philosophy must not ignore, or
affect not to see, or decline hypocritically, or too nicely (not
wisely), to consider these powerful--these ALL POWERFUL--factors. This
whole round of subjects intimately refers to the Rosicrucians, and to
their supposed 'unintelligible' beliefs. They are intelligible enough to
the 'knowing ones'; but they are not to be divulged.

The most difficult problem of the Greek artists was to exercise their
talent in the production of a kind of beauty mixed with that of the Two
Sexes, and time has spared some of the masterpieces. Such is the figure
known under the name of the *Hermaphrodite* (*Hermes-Aprodite;
Venus-Mercury*). In the classic times, both amongst the Greeks and
Romans, as also in Oriental countries, a cruel and flagitious
*violation* of nature (not supposed-so; even accepted as sacred)
produced this beauty by enforcing sacrifice of a peculiar kind on young
male victims. In the case of true Hermaphroditism, that which art could
only effect by dispossession, nature brings about by super-addition, or
rather by concurrent transformation or mutual 'coincidence'. The idea
even lies '*perdue*' (like a silver snake) in the supposed origin of
'Mankind. The most extraordinary ideas as to the origin of the human
race have been entertained by speculative

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

thinkers, and by theologians. The celebrated William Law believed that
the First Human Being was a creature combining the characteristics of
both sexes in his own individual person. 'God created man in His own
Image. In the Image of God created He him.' Some controversionists
consider that there is. a LONG space due (but not allowed) between the
foregoing and the succeeding: 'Male and Female created He THEM'.

'Increase and Multiply, and replenish the earth.' This command was given
on the Sixth Day. Eve was not created until the Seventh Day. Hence Eve
must have been born of Adam--or separated from him 'Ejus autem imago ea
est quæ exhibetur, *ore* videlicet *excellentissimo*, ut sunt Arnobii
verba, et specie inter virginem et puerum eximia. Catullus hoc idem
voluit. Carm. 64.

Quod enim genus figuræ est, ego quod non habuerim?  
Ego mulier, ego adolescens, ego ephebus, ego puer,  
Ego gymnasii fui flos, ego eram decus olei.

Marcianus Capella, Lib. i.:

Atys pulcher item curvi et puer almus aratri.

Caput autem tectum *mithra Phrygem* indicat.'

Laurentii Pignorii Patavini Magnæ Deum Matris Idææ et Attidis initia.
Amstelodami Andreæ Frisii. MDCLXIX.

Admitting, moreover, that the term 'Day'--as used in *Genesis*--is
employed to express an indefinite period of time, in order to form
Woman, God deprived Adam of his *androgyne* character, and reduced him
to a Being having one sex only. And here steps in a fanciful idea of
some speculative thinkers; which (however extravagant) is very poetical
and beautiful. They ask in specifying the question--in serious truth

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

a not-altogether improbable conjecture--whether the irresistible
inclination and the otherwise mysterious, unaccountable drawing-together
and sympathy of two persons who meet for the first time and find
themselves mutually charmed (they cannot tell how or why); or who even
'hear' or 'read' of each other; whether even the continual natural
inclination which impels 'man to woman' and 'woman to man' be not the
spirit-reflex and the atoning 'Penance' (there is a great amount of
*sadness* which mingles in the delight of these feelings) of the
'Original Grand Human Division'. And that this extra-natural (and yet
natural) inclination which draws One Sex towards the Other be not the
movements of Fate (lying down deep-buried in the necessities of things);
and that the whole is the active tendency and forced (however latent,
sometimes) searching through the world for the 'Missed' and 'Lost Half'
(whether feminine, whether masculine), to once more embrace and
supernaturally in rapture in the recognition to become ONE again? Hence,
perhaps (also), that inconstancy and feebleness of decision and 'puzzled
distress' ('seeing through the glass darkly') so aboundingly manifest in
human nature, becoming dramatic in a thousand ways in the confusions of
history--a stupendous scheme of contradictions itself.

May such affinities--and such unsuspected enchantment in this hard,
practical, disbelieving world--lie mysteriously deep as the eternal
secret of original human fellowship and society? And may even the
amusement and the wonder of uninterested spectators and standers-by
arise only from their having the unimagined fact (to them) of dream and
magic being presented, while this unaccountable show is the secret
foundation (as dream started at the beginning of time) of all the
sentimental phenomena of the

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

world? In all the infinite gradations of love, and passion, and sympathy
(and in the experience of their opposites), we may be witnessing the
baffled attempts of the whole round of human-nature--of the succession
of the generations in the centuries--life being hopelessly too short,
and circumstances controlling everything; we may be seeing the efforts
of the 'Halves' to recover 'Each Other'. The masculine half of mankind
wandering unconsciously to find its fellow-feminine, and the female half
of the human family urging (from its nature) with the still more lively
and more sensitive, and more acutely disappointed at repeated
failure--quest. Each sex in its half-individuality, and prosecuting
through time its melancholy 'penance', straining blindly towards that
'Shadow', the complement and double of 'Itself'. Vain indeed in the
nature of things must be that human search to find, in this world, the
supernaturally divorced 'Half'. For that other 'Half-Self' originated in
'another world', and thence started on a 'Dream-Pilgrimage' as a Shadow,
or Spirit, recognizable only through the *imagination* (a mischievous,
deluding faculty) of a real person, to recover its other original Half
in 'This World'. We doubt, indeed, whether *in this world* (and were the
original duality of persons true) that in this state of flesh the
discovery would be welcome, even were discovery and recovery possible.
Such is the preordainment of fate (which has made circumstances), that
the halves of this first-junction may wander all the world over and
exhaust the generations, and all time, in the search, and yet never
meet; save at that 'Grand Assize' or General Resurrection where impend
the New Heaven and the New Earth; and at which Final Consummation the
two parts of the same Unit might be united never to be sundered
more--complete and

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

summed as. the 'One Being'--sexless in the bosom of DIVINITY; where
there is 'neither marriage, nor giving in marriage'.

But the reader will find, in the latter part of the book, plausible
theories--nay, cogent arguments, scarcely to be refuted--not only as to
the possible (and likely) incorporation of spirits; but as to the
difference of sexes among them, with natural incidents, and apparently
contradictory results from their semi-spiritual, semi-bodily Rosicrucian
conditions.

The idea that Adam and Eve were both originally Hermaphrodites was
revived in the thirteenth century by Amaury de Chartres. He held--among
other fanciful notions--that at the end of the world--both sexes *should
be re-united in the same person*.

Some learned Rabbis asserted that Adam was created *double*; that is,
with two bodies, one *male* and the other *female*, joined together by
the shoulders; their heads (like those of Janus) looking in opposite
directions. And that, when God created Eve, He only *divided* such body
in Two. Others maintained that Adam and Eve were each of them,
separately, an Hermaphrodite. Other Jewish authorities, among whom are
Samuel Manasseh and Ben-Israel, are of opinion that our Great Progenitor
was created with Two Bodies, and that 'HE' separated them afterwards
during Adam's sleep; an opinion founded by these writers upon the second
chapter of *Genesis*, verse 21: 'the literal translation of the Hebrew
being: 'He (God) separated the Woman from his side, and substituted
Flesh in her place.' This idea resembles that of Plato. Origen, St.
Chrysostom, and St. Thomas believed that the Woman was not created till
the Seventh Day. But the most generally received opinion is, that Adam
and Eve were created on the *Sixth*. These particular
notions--extravagant as they must be

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

admitted to be--as to the original 'single-dual, dual-single'
characteristics of Adam and Eve are eminently Platonic--nay, cabalistic.

Plato proceeds to account for the love which some men have for some
women, and *vice versa*. 'The males', he says, 'which are halves of an
Androgyne, are much given to women; and the women, which are the halves
of an Androgyne, are passionately fond of men. As for the women' (a not
uncommon Case) 'who indulge an inclination for their own sex, they are
the halves of the Androgyne females who were doubled, and the men who
exhibit a liking for other men are the halves of the males who were also
doubled. In the beginning there were three kinds of Human Beings, not
only the Two which still exist (namely, the Male and the Female)--but a
Third, which was composed of the Two First.' Of this last sex--*or
kind*--nothing remains but the tradition, and the name. 'The Androgynes,
for so they were called, had not only both the male and female faces,
but also possessed the sexual distinctions of both. Of these creatures,
likewise, nothing now exists but the *name*, which survives as a stigma,
and which is considered *infamous*.' Nature had made this, the fact; as
'out of' nature. The reason assigned for the different shape of these
three kinds was that 'the males were formed by the *Sun*; the females by
the *Earth*; and the mixed race of Androgynes by the *Moon*:--which
partakes both of the *Sun* and the *Earth*.'

Ecclesiastical writers declare that such an Eunuch was the Holy
Evangelist, St. John, whom Jesus loved beyond all His other disciples,
who lay upon Jesus’ bosom; who, while Peter tardily advanced, flew,
borne on the wings of virginity, to the LORD; and penetrating into the
secrets of the Divine Nativity, was emboldened to declare what preceding
ages had

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

been ignorant of. 'In the Beginning was the Word. And the Word was with
God, and the Word was God.' Reynardi *Opera*, vol. viii. p. 252.

If the disciples of the doctrine of 'evolution' or 'selection of the
fittest' are right--if your Darwins, your Huxleys, your Herbert
Spencers, your Leweses, your dense unimaginative men (only specious
philosophers), are correct in their deductions of
correlation--'bowing-out God' <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md) as it
were (in sublimity of *fools’* not '*mad*' presumption), 'exterior of
His own Creation'--then reverence, and devotion, and martyrdom, and the
sacredness, and the magic of *virginity*, must be the merest ludicrous
superstition and figment. Is MAN alone in his world? Are there OTHERS in
it with him? The ancients universally held virginity as a real magic,
transcendental, mysterious something, which exercised power
*supernaturally* both through Heaven and through Earth. It was an
unnatural-natural outspring set apart and sacred 'of the Gods'. None but
the barbarous touch, the brutal touch, could profane it. It worked
miracles.

’Tis said that the Lion will turn and flee  
From a Maid in the pride of her purity.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For maidhood and
virginity is a phenomenon *independent of Creation*, and bears through
the worlds visible and invisible--the worlds immortal--the impress and
seal upon its forehead of *GOD’S REST*, and 'Refusal', not of His
ACTIVITY and 'Consent'. Hence its sacredness in all religions and under
all beliefs. '*Voilà pourquoi, pendant les persécutions, il y eut tant
de vierges chrétiennes outragées par leurs bourreaux, qui ne faisaient
qu’appliquer l’antique loi* 

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

*romaine, en vertu de la quelle une vierge ne pouvait pas être mise à
mort*.'--*L’Antiquité la plus reculée jusqu’à nos jours*, *par* Pierre
Dufour, vol. 3, chap. i. p. 29. Bruxelles, J. Rosez, 1861. The reason
for this lies very deep, and is very refined and very true. It will be
seen, on adequate reflection, that the heathen executioners, in
exercising their supposed *human* right of death-giving in law, did not
dare touch the 'property of the Gods' in death, owing to their
superstition; and they therefore made their victims 'things' in 'getting
godhood' (so to speak) 'out of them' before the death-penalty. This was
the reason why, in the old English executioners’ practice, women were
always burnt or strangled at the stake, but not hanged vulgarly like men
or dogs. It was a tribute to the supposed sacredness of women's
characteristics, and from the fact of her (phenomenal) character. 'Les
Juges Païens qui prenaient un odieux plaisir à les frapper dans ce
qu’elles avaient de plus cher. Mais leur virginité était un sacrifice
qu’elles offraient chastement à Dieu en échange de la couronne du
martyre. "Une vierge", disait Saint-Ambroise, "peut être prostituée et
non souillée." "Les vierges", dit Saint-Cyprien, "sont comme les fleurs
du Jardin de Ciel".' Pierre Dufour. '*Le viol des vierges chrétiennes
n’était donc dans l’origine qu’un préliminaire de la peine capitale,
conformément à l’usage de la penalité romaine*. Vitiatæ prius a
carnifice dein strangulatæ.' Suetonius, *dans la vie de Tibère:* Pierre
Dufour. '*L’Histoire de Prostitution*'.

'Because Virgins by a received custom were not to be strangled, he
caused the Hangman first to deflower a Virgin, and then to strangle
her'. Tacitus. Suetonius. Edward Leigh's *Analecta de Primis Cæsaribus*.
And when *forced*, the author might have added, became still more
glorious flowers (or lights) of Paradise,

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> We live, in
nature, in contradiction--in 'impossibilities' that make
'possibilities'. Our 'forms' ignore 'ourselves'. Maidhood is the
possibility of bearing joy beyond compare (the human-natural joys locked
therein)--the first, last, and best of this world’s pleasures--through
the world; and yet withstanding the use of it. Refraining in the
carrying the precious casket from 'one world' (*through the world for
which it is intended 'as the temptation'*) into 'another world'. It is
the successful resistance and baffling of the Devil, who lures in this
mysterious respect, with his most exquisite inducement. Hence the reason
of our King Edward the Confessor being marked as the 'Saint; for he
'forbore his wife Edith'. This is the *raison d'être* of all triumph of
the kind: Virginity in itself (strangely as it may sound for mankind),
though without its infraction heaven could not be--for it is our senses
that make heaven--is a Key of Heaven. Hence the inherent sacredness of
the--human--'Act' all the world over; and highest so in the religions of
the most civilized peoples, those which have risen to the highest
refinement. Mary Magdalen was the *first* at the tomb of the Redeemer,
and was the *first* to whom our Lord showed Himself. It was through a
WOMAN that our race was rendered possible. This must never be forgotten.

It is not difficult to discover how inveterate the belief of their
system, which seems naturally to account for everything, has become to
the Materialists; who (to use a wild figure) have identified the *time*
that has got into the watch with the *reason that the watch goes*. Their
whole work is the falling-in-love-with and believing their own work. It
would be cruel to make these men believe. It would be the dispossession
of themselves, out of themselves. Their scope, and range, and judgment
are an impenetrable world’s

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

presumption; working only from the centre outwards--as from
'particulars' to 'generals'--the false way. These accepted *reasonable
reasoners* do not see that if God’s reasons had been man’s reasons man
would never have been; because MAN has no place *in reason*--he is not
reasonable. It is the self-assertion and the self-presumption that is at
fault--mere miserable self-conceit produces these men:--volubility--and
reading--provide them with a cloud of words wherewith they may (and do)
confuse. They have dared in their lofty (toppling) philosophical
climbing--like the men of Babel--or 'Babble', as the tongues afterwards
became--forcing into their Heights of Metaphysics (as it were) to *look
down* upon God--spying Him at His work! Impious--mad
stupidity;--trusting *brains*, in which the Devil (or Denier) forges
lies--forgetting that *Darkness is only the reversed side of Light*, as
light is only the presented side of Darkness--and that Both are the
Same. We should know no light without darkness, which shows us the
light; just in the same way as we see the wrong side of the light in
seeing the darkness when the welcome light appears--so to speak.

These men want contradiction. They are ruined in their own self-esteem.
They are floated upward in the pride of knowledge--with wings of wax.
They grape in, the *débris* of nature. Their knowledge is scientific
knowledge. Knowledge as an acquisition to enlighten (its only use) is as
ashes with the fire all out of it--fire which is faith. These
philosophers are converted into the vehicle of the comprehension of
their own theories: and there they rest, absorbed and occupied in these
alone. Self-centred, complete, satisfied, distrustless, they fortify
themselves in their triumph, and become incompetent to see aught that
shall challenge their own fixed ideas. In regard to

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

these merely scientific people, an apt and a forcible remark has been
made: 'Natural selection can only preserve such slight variations as are
immediately useful. It cannot provide a savage with brain *suited to the
remote needs of his civilized descendants some thousands of years
later*.' All is progressive, and all is development, with these
philosophers. They have no idea of cataclysm. When the whole world is
the offspring--when the mountains, with the mutilated and the riven
faces which they present to us, are the children--thunderstricken--of
the INTELLIGENT (*sudden* to the world sometimes, snapping 'gradations'
and 'evolutions' with *miracle*), MASTER, GUIDE and GOD of ALL! Thinkest
thou that those skies have forgotten to be in earnest, because thou
goest mouthing through the world like an ape?' Be what you wish to be
then, and go down into the dust! Very probably your fate it may prove to
be; though it may be the lot of some others to escape. By humbleness--by
FAITH!

Revelation and supernatural disclosure, quite different to progress and
circumstantial natural advance--as the 'nature of nature'--are to be
inferred from the apparition of certain deplorable maladies--diseases
which puzzle and bewilder as to their true character; which lead us
astray, sometimes, as to their likeliest best treatment. The ideas of
the ROSICRUCIANS as to the real (hidden and unsuspected) origin of these
diseases, which seem--large as is the catalogue of maladies--so
*contrary* to all the physiological, natural groundwork upon which (so
to say) man’s health and healthy exercise of his nature expand and
expound, are speculative and *recherché* in the extreme. Such querists
ask in vain where such diseases--so momentous, so super-horrid--could
have first sprung. Philosophers of this class affirm that there is
nothing of

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

these in the *true character of man*. That these diseases stand aloof,
and are of themselves. That they bear in themselves *proofs* of the
indignation (intelligent) exterior to man; to some violent invasion and
inversion--to some inappeasable outrage of God’s law. Flesh and blood
has become an accursed--a super-accursed *weed*, from the devils having
gained access to it. Man’s unholy passions have hurried him into an
abyss of physical perdition, wherein he has obliterated his 'image' and
gifts, and done things (worse than the beasts) *beyond the laws* of his
impress; wide already as the area of the exercise of those laws was,
*even for evil*. The penalty has pursued the original guilt through the
generations and still survives; because Man has dared to intrude into
the 'DISORDERS OF DARKNESS', and brought back out of ORCUS and made
physical guilt and horror which were the property of the devils and
within the compass of their range, alone, of accursed activity, but
which *were not for him--were not naturally for him*. Hence the marks
and tokens of this supernatural 'cancer', some of the imported
effects--otherwise lying out of his reach as being far above what his
limited nature could endure without utter consumption of itself--of the
'FIRST FALL'. Conquest is wide-spread just according to the weakness and
incidence of the subjected. Fire finds its easy prey in dry leaves and
in light combustible. These 'immortal-mortal' diseases spread and
ramified, and spread and ramify (though with diminution now), with an
extension, and with a vigour, just in the proportion of the necessitated
surrender arising from the incompetency and inability to resist; these
hitherto supersensual and supernatural terrors had found an access into
this real world of BODY, and there the disaster revelled in its
appropriate forms in its newly-found dominion. 'The imagination of man.

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

is evil continually.' There are blots and imperfections which have
fastened upon Man’s very mortal composition or body. His nature is
struggling to free itself of the contagion. But the poison is not poison
of this world. The generations suffer in all the crowd forward--in all
their procession and replication for the sin--for the unbelievable
sin--for the wanton, out-of-the-way wickedness of predecessors. This is
the theory as to the origin of certain diseases, which are considered
'NOT HUMAN'; but which have been conveyed-to, and are inherited by,
those who have no affinity with these inflictions by their nature or by
the intentions of the 'EXTERIOR PROVIDENCE'. Man has brought all this
upon himself, as farther fruits and newer penalties arising from the
First Great Lapse, and in farther proof, in still more degrading and
still more disfiguring decadence, of the imbibing of the first sweet
poison--so deliciously and yet so treacherously (lecherously) brewed by
the First Great Tempter:--Nameless--Anonymous--with 'Its' Janus Mask,
and offering to that 'Phenomenon', man, under 'Its' many 'Names'. Man is
another ruin, perhaps, in a series of *several previous ruins*, of which
mortality has lost all trace.

The terms superstition and science are counter-changed. In reality
science may be the superstition, and superstition the truth (otherwise
the 'science', assumed as truth). Scientific men are the most
superstitious of any class, for they have raised an idol which they call
science, and therefore truth (why, *therefore*, forsooth?); and they
have fallen down and worshipped Science (their own ignorance) as God.
They have taken themselves out of themselves, and worshipped
'themselves'--otherwise their heads, instead of their hearts; their
reason (their head), which is no reason (no head) really, instead of
their hearts, or

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

their emotions and instincts; which are true, and which are
infallible--because they contradict the apparent and the reasonable,
*which is never true*. Hence we cannot know God through God, or rather
through the Intellect; but we must know God through the 'Saviour', or
through the heart or affections; which entity, or sum of heart and
affections, is Second God, or Man 'in the image', etc. The Third
'Person' of the Trinity is the Holy Ghost, or 'Recognition' in which
'Both' are--'Seen in the Spirit', wherein, and absorbing the 'Two
Others', is interfluent, miraculous, instant union and 'ASSUMPTION' of
God and Means, in 'Belief'. This is the groundwork of all religious
systems. God’s anger (the 'denunciation' or the 'shaking-off' by the
All-Pure and the All-Powerful) is shown in those immortal (become
fleshly), or 'Spirit-Cancers' (so to speak), imported, as adaptations to
the nature of physical man, into *body-corporate* (that is,
intelligible): the supernatural become natural.

'Enfin, un des plus grands hommes qui aient porté le flambeau dans les
tenèbres de l’art médical: *Grand Chirurgie* (liv. i. ch. 7) "La
vérole", dit-il avec cette conviction que la génie peut seul donner, "a
pris son origine dans le commerce impur d’un Français lépreux avec une
courtisane qui avait des bubons vénériens, laquelle infecta ensuite tous
ceux qui eurent affaire à elle. C’est ainsi", continue cet habile et
audacieux observateur, "c’est ainsi que la vérole, provenue de la lépre
et des bubons vénériens, à peu près comme la race des mulets est sortie
de l’accouplement d’un cheval et d’une ànesse, se répandit par contagion
dans tout l’univers." Paracelse considérait, donc, le vérole de 1494
comme "un genre nouveau dans l’antique famille des maladies
vénériennes."' Pierre Dufour, tome quatrième, p. 292.

'Un saint laïque', dit Jean Baptiste van Helmont dans son *Tumulus
Pestis*, 'tâchant de diviner pourquoi la vérole avait paru au siècle
passé et non auparavant, fut ravi en esprit et eut une vision d’une
jument rongée. du farcin, d’où il soupçonna qu’au siége de Naples, où
cette maladie parut pour la première fois, quelque homme avait eu un
commerce abominable avec une bête de cette espèce attaquée du même mal,
et qu’ensuite, *par un effet* 

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

*de la justice divine*, il avait malheureusement infecté le genre
humain.' Pierre Dufour, tome quatriéme, chap. xx. p. 292.

'Manardi, Mathiole, Brassavola, et Paracelse disent que l’infection
vénérienne est née de la lèpre et de la prostitution.' Pierre Dufour,
tome quatrième, p. 297 (8vo edition).

Nothing can exceed the importance of the foregoing observations in
regard to the welfare (bodily and spiritually) of Man; especially in
these questioning, inquisitive modern times, when everything is brought
to the front, and remorselessly (although often foolishly, because
conceitedly) canvassed. Such names as the great (much-libelled)
Paracelsus, the prince of chemists and physiologists, and that of Van
Helmont, the most subtle and profound of magnetists and psychologists,
secure attention among the best-informed, and carry their own consummate
guarantee--the most convincingly to the adepts. MEN of REFLECTION are
needed to comprehend these theories and speculations, and to weigh this
evidence.
