# THE ROSICRUCIANS

## PART II

### CHAPTER THE FIRST

#### HISTORY OF THE TOWER OR STEEPLE

WE have asserted, in an earlier part of our book, that the pyramidal or
triangular form which fire assumes in its ascent to heaven was, in the
monolithic typology, used to signify the Great Generative Power. The
coarse sensuality which seems inseparable from modern ideas about the
worship of the pillar or upright had no place really in the solemn
ancient mind, in which ideas of religion largely and constantly mingled.
We must not judge the ancients by too rigid an adherence to our own
prepossessions--foolish and inveterately hardened as they continually
are.

The adoration paid to this image of the *phallus*, which has persisted
as an object of worship through all the ages, in all countries, was only
the acknowledgment, in the ancient mind, of wonder at the seemingly
accidental and unlikely, but certainly most complete and effectual,
means by which the continuation of the human race is secured. The
cabalistic arguers contended that 'Man' was a phenomenon; that he did
not, otherwise than in his presentment, seem intended; that there
appeared nothing even in the stupendous chain of organisms that seemed
specially to hint his approach, or to explain his appearance (strange as
this seems), according to likelihood and

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

sequence; that between the highest of the animals and the being 'Man'
there was a great gulf, and seemingly an impassable gulf; that some
'after-reason', to speak according to the means of the comprehension of
man, induced his introduction into the Great Design; that, in short,
'Man' originally was not intended. There is a deep mystery underlying
all these ideas, which we find differently accounted for in the various
theologies.

We are here only speaking some of the abstruse speculations of the old
philosophers, whose, idea of creation, and of the nature of man and his
destiny, differed most materially--if not wholly--from the acceptable
ideas which they chose to inculcate, and which they wished to impress
upon ordinary minds. Thus their deeper speculations were never committed
to writing, because they did not admit of, interpretation in this way;
and if so handed down or promulgated, they would have been sure to have
been rejected and disbelieved, on account of the impossibility of their
being believed. In indicating some of the strange notions propounded by
the Sophists, and, if possible, still more remarkably by the early
Christian Fathers, we desire to disclaim any participation with

them. Our personal belief of these theories must not be necessarily
supposed from our seeming to advocate them. There is no doubt that they
were very acute

and profound persons who undertook the examination and reconcilement of
the philosophical systems at the introduction of Christianity.

The succeeding array of phallic figures will be found interesting, as
tracing out to its progenitor or prototype that symbol which we call the
'upright'. This architectural descent we shall call the 'Genealogy of
the Tower or Steeple'.

The Architectural Genealogy of the 'Tower' or 'Steeple' (so to speak) is
full of suggestion, and is closely connected with the story of the
phallus.

The insignia on the heads of the cobras in the friezes of the Egyptian
Court in the Crystal Palace are coloured on the Right, *White*, on the
Left, *Red*. These imply masculine and feminine ideas.

Figure (British Museum)

Fig. 42 is the Winged Human-headed Lion. It comes from the Nineveh
Gallery. It may be recognized as the Winged Bull, and also as the Winged
'Lion of St Mark'.

The 'Lion', 'Bull', 'Eagle', 'Man', are the symbols of the Evangelists;
the 'Man', or 'Angel' standing for St. Matthew, the 'Lion' for St. Mark,
the 'Bull' for St. Luke, and the 'Eagle' for St. John. In these strange
aspects the Evangelists figured in many ancient churches, and on most
fonts. These representative forms are also said to have been the 'Four
Cherubim' of the Ark of the Hebrews. Hermetically they signify the 'four
elements', or the four corners or angle-points of the 'Lesser' or
'Manifested World', or the 'Microcosm' of the Cabalists.

Fig. 45 represents an Obelisk at Nineveh, now in the British Museum.
Jacob's Pillar, the Sacred Stone in Westminster Abbey, 'Bethel', etc.,
'Gilgal', have a mythic alliance with the obelisk.

Regarding the pyramids the following may be advanced: Murphy, the
delineator of the Alhambra, considered the Pointed Arch to be a system
founded on the principle of the Pyramid. The pointed or vertical
Saracenic or Gothic arch presents the form of the upper portion of the
human φαλλος. The Saracenic arch denotes the union of the Linga and
Yoni.

In fig. 56 we have the sun rising from between the horns of Eblis (here
taken for the pyramids). This is a poetical superstition of the
Arabians, who therefore turn to the *North* to pray it contradiction to

the practice of the Persians, who adore the rising sun. The Arabians
avert in prayer from this malific sign of the 'horns', because the sun
is seen rising from between them; and when disclosing from between these
mythic pillars, the sun becomes a portent.

Fig. 57 is an Egyptian seal, copied by Layard (*Nineveh and Babylon*, p.
156). Subject: the Egyptian god Harpocrates, seated on the mythic lotus,
in adoration of the Yoni, or ‏הוה‎, or *havah*.

The Druidical Circles, and single stones standing in solitary places,
are all connected with the mystic speculations of the Rosicrucians.

The eminences, St. Michael's Mount and Mont St.-Michel, were dedicated
by the Phœnicians to the Sun-God (Hercules), as the 'Hydra' or
'Dragon-slayer'.

The Architectural Genealogy of the 'Tower' or 'Steeple' displays other
phases of the alterations of the 'upright'. All towers are descendants
of the biblical votive stones, and in multiplying have changed in aspect
according to the ideas of the people of the country in which they were
raised. This Architectural Genealogy of the 'Tower' or 'Steeple' gives
many varieties.

architectural ideas of the builders of the different countries. where
the same memorial pillar was raised, it assumed in time the
peculiarities of the Gothic or pointed style. The steeples of the
churches, the figures of which we give on [p. 244](#page_244.md), indicate
the gradual growth and expansion of the romantic or pointed
architecture, which is generally called Gothic; and they prove how the
upright, or original phallic form, was adopted and gradually mingled in
Christian architecture--in reality at last becoming its dominant
feature.

the new character given, and the gradual variations of the 'Tower', in
the first instance, and afterwards of the 'Steeple'; both being
reproductions of the first idea of the *lithos*, upright, or *phallus:*
the 'Idol' imitative of the 'Flame of Fire'.

The two pillars in fig. 102 are monuments in Penrith Churchyard. These
are the familiar double, 'Runic' uprights, pillars, or spires.

All the minarets and towers in the East display in the peculiar curves
of their summits the influence of the same phallic idea, as an attentive
examination will prove.

There seems to be little or no reason to doubt that the much-disputed
origin of the pointed Gothic arch, or lancet-shaped arch, and the
Saracenic or Moorish horseshoe arch, is the union and blending of the
two generative figures, namely, the 'discus' or round, and the upright
and vertical, or 'phallic', shape, as indicated in the diagrams on pp.

The Zodiac itself is, in certain senses, a Genesis, or 'History of
Creation'. The 'Twelve Signs' may be interpreted as the 'Twelve Acts' of
the Divine Drama. Some of the Mosques in the East are surmounted with
twelve minarets, and the number twelve occurs frequently in connexion
with the theology of the Moslems.

In old representations of the cathedral church of Notre Dame at Paris,
the symbols of the masculine divinity--such as the sun and some
others--are placed over the right hand, or masculine western tower,
flanking the Galilee, or Great Western Porch; thus unmistakably hinting,
its meaning. Over the corresponding left hand, or female tower, are
placed the crescent horns of the moon, and some other indications,
announcing its dedication to the female deified principle.

crescent, with its points in the curvilinear or serpentine form. The
crescent moon of Egypt and that of Persia is the thin sickle of the new
moon reclining on her back, and seemingly with the star *issuant* from
between her horns; which is evidently an Egyptian hint coming from the
old hieroglyphic times. This mysterious crescent and star is the badge
of the sect of Ali among the Mohammedans, and it plays a most important
part in augurial or religious heraldry. The standards of Egypt, Persia,
and Arabia are *gules*, or Mars, or the fiery colour. It is

the ardent, or masculine, or red colour of Ali. The colours of Turkey,
on the other hand, are strictly those of Mohammed, and unconsciously
honour the female element in displaying the green, or the *vert*, or the
woman's colour, or Friday colour, that of the Mohammedan Sabbath. This
green is the *vert*, or 'Venus', of Mecca (see page
[390](rrm43.htm#page_390).md). The Turkish standard divides
*party-per-pale* the masculine red of the sect of Ali with the green of
the Hadgi; allotting to the former the place of honour, or the dexter
side of the emblazonment.

The Christian altar is divided, as a hieroglyphic, into two halves or
sides, before which the representative priest extends his hands,
standing before it with his right hand (meaning the 'Law') to the right,
and his left hand (meaning the 'Prophets') to the left; the first of
which signifies the masculine (Jewish), and the second the feminine
(Christian--because the Saviour was 'born of a woman'), mystic celestial
power.

Some monograms or hieroglyphic expressions, meaning the 'Salvator
Mundi,' show the Roman letter 'I' (Jesus) in front, in large size; the
letter 'H' (which is feminine, and Greek in its origin, meaning here
'Man, *as born of Woman*') much smaller; and behind, interlacing and
combining the first two letters, is the single curved or cursive 'S',
which stands for 'S.S.', the Holy Spirit, or the Third Person of the
Trinity. The whole, in another way, is 'Jesus Hominum Salvator'. Nearly
all the sacred monograms, with the intention of making the letter
denoting the 'Man' prominent, present the letter 'I' large; in the
heraldic language *surtout*, or 'over all'. The monogram of the Saviour
is sometimes seen in the 'Ark', or '*vesica piscis*,' which is a pointed
oval figure, familiar in Gothic architecture,

and shaped like a boat or a shuttle, *counter-changing* the letters and
the closing arcs, white and black--the black occupying the left or
female side according to the ideas of the Templars. The standards of
these soldier-monks were white and black, either oblong or forked.

There are two columns of that heavy, severe order, however grand and
impressive, which distinguishes the early Norman period of architecture
in England, in regard to which, though abounding in far-off hermetic
suggestions, we have seen no notice in antiquarian quarters. These two
columns comprise a part of the colonnade in the White Tower, or central
tower, of the Tower of London. The capital of the first column is
square, but it is rounded at the angles by a cut to the
*hypotrachelium*, or base-ring, of the [capital](errata.htm#6.md). The tops
of these cuts are formed by volutes similar to the horns of the
Corinthian and Ionic capitals. The male volute is to the right, and is a
spiral volve, from which issues a dependent budding flower dropping
seed. The volve to the left, which is a series of rings enclosing a
point, is female. A twisted perpendicular, like a horn, projects from
the base on this left side. The capital of the other column presents a
not unusual Norman form of two truncated-tables or faces rounded below
and divided in the middle. These we interpret as meaning the 'woman' and
the 'man', side by side, and left and right. These glyphs in the two
capitals of the columns signify 'Jachin' and 'Boaz', and stand for the
'First Man,' and the 'First Woman'. The mysterious letter 'Tau', which
is the same as the Runic Hammer of Thor, and which in truth is a
'Cross,' occupies the centre-point, or, heraldically, the
'honour-point', of the first column to the right. The master-masons were
celebrated in their art of concealing myths, or hinting them

cautiously in the most difficult and far-off resemblances. The curious
reader is referred to our illustration, figs. 119, 120.

The character of the 'Head' which the Templars were charged with having
worshipped in their secret 'encampments', or 'mystic lodges', has been
the subject of much dispute. Some say it was the head of Proserpine, or
of Isis, or of the 'Mother of Nature' presented under certain strange
aspects. Others assert that the figure was male, and that of Dis or
Charon, according to the classic nomenclature. The object was reputed to
be a talisman, and it is called by some the head of Medusa, or the
snake-haired visage, dropping blood which turned to snakes, and
transforming the beholder to stone. It was this head, or one of a
similar description, which was supposed to serve as the talisman or
recognitive mark of the secret fraternity or society, headed by Pichegru
and others, which was suppressed by Napoleon, and the members of which
were tried and condemned as aiming at revolutionary objects. Why
Napoleon adopted this mysterious supposed magical head, as he is said to
have done, on the suppression and destruction of this revolutionary
body--to which we refer elsewhere--and why he chose to place his own
head in the centre-place before occupied by this imagined awe-inspiring
countenance, and adopted the whole as the star of his newly founded
'Legion of Honour', it is very difficult to say. In the East there is a
tradition of this insupportable magic countenance, which the Orientals
assign to a 'Veiled Prophet', similar to the mysterious personage in
*Lalla Rookh*.
