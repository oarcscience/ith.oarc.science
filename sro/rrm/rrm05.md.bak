# THE ROSICRUCIANS

## PART I

### CHAPTER THE FIRST

#### CRITICS OF THE ROSICRUCIANS CRITICIZED

THAT modern science, spite of its assumptions and of its intolerant
dogmatism, is much at fault--nay, to a great extent a very vain
thing--is a conclusion that often presents itself to the minds of
thinking persons. Thus thoughtful people, who choose to separate
themselves from the crowd, and who do not altogether give in with such
edifying submission to the indoctrination of the scientific
classes--notwithstanding that these latter have the support generally of
that which, by a wide term, is called the 'press' in this
country--quietly decline reliance on modern science. They see that there
are numerous shortcomings of teachers in medicine, which fails
frequently, though always with its answer--in theology, which chooses
rather that men should sleep, though not the right sleep, than consider
waking--nay, in all the branches of human knowledge; the fashion in
regard to which is to disparage the ancient schools of thought by
exposing what are called their errors by the light of modern assumed
infallible discovery. It never once occurs to these eager, conceited
professors that they themselves may possibly have learned wrongly, that
the old knowledge they decry

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

is underrated because they do not understand it, and that, entirely
because the light of the modern world is so brilliant in them, so dark
to them, as eclipsed in this novel artificial light, is the older and
better and truer sunshine nearer to the ancients: because time itself
was newer to the old peoples of the world, and because the circumstances
of the first making of time were more understood in the then first
divine disclosure, granting that time ever had a beginning, as man’s
reason insists it must.

Shelley, the poet, who, if he had not been so great as a poet, would
have been perhaps equally eminent as a metaphysician, that is, when age
and experience had ripened and corrected his original brilliant
crudities of thought--used to declare that most men--at least, most
thinking men--spend the latter half of their lives in unlearning the
mistakes of the preceding half. This he declares to have been the fact
in his own experience--which was, even for this test, a very brief one;
.for Shelley was only twenty-nine when his lamentable death occurred.
The early departure of three brilliant poetic spirits of our fathers'
period, at the same time that it is very melancholy, is worthy of deep
remark. Shelley was, as we have said, twenty-nine; Byron was only
thirty-six; John Keats--in some respects the most poetically intense and
abstract of the three--was only twenty-four. And in these short several
lifetimes, measuring so few years, these distinguished persons had
achieved that which resulted in the enrolment of their names in a
nation's catalogue in a grand branch of human attainment. They live in
lasting records, they grow in honour, and their names do not fade, as is
the case with those reputations which have been unduly magnified, but
which give way to time. Perhaps the lot of some contemporaneous accepted
important, not to say

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

great, reputations will be diminution and disappearance. Time is not
only an avenger, but a very judicious corrector.

We are so convinced of the irresistible dominancy, all the world over,
of opinions, and of the *dicta* relative to this or that merit, or this
or that truth, propounded, by people with names and of influence in our
good, readily believing England, and of the power of supposed authority
in matters of taste and literary acceptance, that we desire to warn
querists against the statements about the fraternity--for it is not a
body--of the Rosicrucians appearing in all the published accounts,
whether of this country or abroad. We have examined all these supposed
notices and explanations of who the Rosicrucians were in biographical
works, in encyclopædias and histories, and we find them all prejudiced
and misrepresenting, really telling no truth, and only displaying a
deplorable amount of mischievous ignorance. They are, besides, in the
main copied from each other--which is notably the case with the early
encyclopædias. Old Fuller, who has some notices of Robert Flood, a
famous English member of the order of Rosicrucians, fully admits his
ignorance of whom the brotherhood comprised, and of their constitution
or purpose. All generally received accounts, therefore, are wrong,
principally for three reasons: first, through ignorance; secondly,
through prejudice; thirdly, as instigated by distrust, dislike, and
envy--for in criticism it is a dogma that the subject must be always
*under* the critic, never that, by a chance, the subject may be *above*
the critic--that is, above the critic's grasp and comprehension. But
suppose the criticized choose to except to the ability of the critic in
any way to judge of him?

From this obstinacy and conceit arise such underrating and false comment
as is implied in the following

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

which is extracted from *The Encyclopædia Britannica*--which account is
copied again into several other encyclopædias, and repeated into smaller
works with. pertinacious, with even malicious fidelity

'In fine, the Rosicrucians, and all their fanatical descendants, agree
in proposing the most crude and incomprehensible notions and ideas in
the most obscure, quaint, and unusual expressions.'--*Encyclopædia
Britannica:* article 'Rosicrucians'.

During the age of James the First, Charles the First, even during the
Protectorate, and again in the time of Charles the Second, the singular
doctrines of the Rosicrucians attracted a large amount of attention, and
excited much keen controversy. Sundry replies or 'apologies' appeared on
the part of the Rosicrucians. Among them was a most able work published
in Latin by Dr. Robert Flood, at Leyden, in 1616. It was a small,
closely printed, very learned octavo, entitled *Apologia Compendiaria
Fraternitatis de Rosea Cruce*, etc., and abounds in knowledge. It is an
exceedingly rare work; but there is a copy in the British Museum. All
this long period was marked by considerable speculation regarding these
Rosicrucians. Pope’s *Rape of the Lock* is founded upon some of their
fanciful cabalistic ideas. *The Spectator* contains notices of the
mystic society; and, to prove. the public curiosity concerning the
Rosicrucians, and a strange incident, the particulars of which we are
going to supply from the best sources now for the first time, we may
state that there is included, in one number of Addison’s elegant series
of papers called *The Spectator*, a resumption of a notice, and some
after-comment, upon the supposed discovery of the burial-place in
England of one of these mighty men the Rosicrucians. The story is to the
following. purport, as nearly as it can be gathered. We have

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

written much more fully of it from other means; for *The Spectator's*
account is very full of errors, and was evidently gained afar off, and
merely from hearsay, as it were. It is, besides, poor and ineffective,
gathered from no authority, and produced with no dramatic force; for the
life and the beliefs of the Rosicrucians were very dramatic, at the same
time that the latter were very true, although generally disbelieved.
