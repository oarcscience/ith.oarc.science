### THE TROUBADOURS,

#### THE SINGING MESSENGERS FROM EAST TO WEST.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

</div>

MYSTERIOUS songsters of the Middle Ages, messengers who were burdened—by
right of the royal gift of song—with a knowledge that transcended that
of their fellow-men—such were the Troubadours, who formed an integral
portion of the mystic thread, and thus served in the weaving of the
glorious traditions of eastern arcane lore into the young web of the
western child-life.

Much has been already set down by many competent writers on this most
complicated and interesting period of the Middle Ages; here and there
some few frankly acknowledge that in the study of the writings and poems
of the Troubadours, traces of hidden knowledge on their part become
revealed, a knowledge which pertains to some more ancient tradition than
that of the Catholic Church.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

It is these traces that must be collected, in order to demonstrate that
these "Messengers of Love," as they were often termed, were inheritors
of a "Kingdom of Heaven "—a mystic heaven, indeed, of pure doctrine,
noble life, and holy aspirations.

It is but slightly that we need touch on their general history, for the
outer aspect of their work can be easily followed by students; our chief
attention must be centred on the most important part of their mission,
and the part but little known in the general world, namely, that of
their work as spiritual teachers, their secret language, and above all
their secret doctrine.

Rossetti <span id="fr_91"></span>[\*](#fn_91.md) in his valuable book gives
many proofs of the existence of a mystic language in the "Secret
Schools," and of the "double" and even "triple language" used by these
Troubadours in communicating with each other. These details must be
investigated if we desire to arrive at any clear comprehension of the
extent to which these Secret Schools were organized and developed during
the Middle Ages, and on this point Rossetti writes as follows:

<span class="small">The existence of such a style of language is an
historical fact affirmed by many, and denied by none; it is a not less
notorious fact that the persecuted sect conformed in public to the
language and ceremonies of the persecuting religion; while they give in
secret to every</span>

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

sentence of that language, and to every act of those ceremonies, an
arbitrary and conventional meaning, corresponding with their own
designs. There is scarcely a contemporary or succeeding historian who
does not tell us that the Patarini, or Cathari, or Albigenses, were
Manicheans; and we know that Silvanus, one of the successors of the
murdered Manes, so artfully used that doctrine "that it seemed all drawn
from the Scriptures, as they are received by catholics. He affected to
make use of Scriptural phrases and he spoke like the most orthodox among
us, when he mentioned the baptism, death, burial or resurrection of our
Lord Jesus Christ." And he and his proselytes did all this so cunningly
that "the Manicheans seduced numbers of people; and their sect was
considered by the simple-minded to be a society of Christians, who made
profession of an extraordinary perfection." These are the words of the
Abbé Pluquet (*Dict. des Hérés*., art., Silvan and Manicheans), who
traced the existence of this sect in Italy as far back as 1022, when
many of them were discovered and burned for the love of God. Let us hear
the same author describe the actions of later sectarians after other
innumerable examples of inhuman cruelty. "The *Clanculars* were a
society of anabaptists who taught that *on religious subjects* it was
necessary to speak *in public like other men*, and only *in secret* to
express the thoughts." And the Albigensis and Manicheans show the best
means of succeeding in this design with the following fact.

Persecuted incessantly by the remorseless Inquisition, one of their
chiefs had recourse to a cunning device. He knew that he and his friends
were accused of refusing to worship the saints, and of denying the
supremacy of the Romish Church, and that they would be forced to make a
profession of faith and to swear by the *Holy Mary* to have no other
religion than that of the *Holy Church*. He was resolved not to betray
his inward sentiments, but he desired if possible, to escape death. "O,
muses! O, high genius!

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="small">Now vouchsafe your aid!" He shut himself up in a cave with
two aged females of his own sect, and gave the name of *Holy Church* to
the one and *Holy Mary* to the other, "In order, that, when the
sectarians were interrogated by the Father Inquisitors, they might be
able to swear by the *Holy Mary* that they held no other faith than that
of the *Holy Church*." Hence, when we desire to estimate properly the
devout and holy things written in those times, we must first consider
who composed them; and thus we shall be able to reconcile the frequent
contradictions which are apparent between the verses and the actions of
the Troubadours and Trouveurs." <span
id="fr_92"></span>[\*](#fn_92.md)</span>

It is remarkable that this secret language should have remained so
little known, since it gives a clue of almost unmeasured importance to
many a hidden mystery in the Troubadour life of the Middle Ages. It is
to Eugène Aroux that we owe the largest debt of gratitude for unveiling
this mysterious bye-way of mystic studies; he denounces, with the wrath

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

of a good, but bigoted Catholic, the teachings of Dante, and he unveils
for us the real reason of his wrath: and from his standpoint he is
right, Dante was not an orthodox Catholic; he was a true mystic, and his
church was composed of all those great and liberated souls who have
existed in every clime: without distinction of race, religion or caste.
Aroux draws the attention of the student to the following important
points: with relation to the real views of Dante, thus he says, in
commenting on the poet:

Though we may seem to have gone back quite beyond the deluge, it is
evident that we are really completely in the Middle Ages. And in fact,
though people may talk to us of the origin of the human species and of
its dispersion over the earth, the question is really that of the
starting-point of the Manichean-Gnostic doctrine and of its course from
East to West. Let the following lines be carefully considered: "We do
not readily believe that men were, immediately on the confusion of
tongues, dispersed all over the world. The root of the human race was
first planted *in the countries of the East*, then OUR RACE spread
itself *by putting forth numerous shoots on one side and another*,
\[like\] PALM-TREES, and it finally reached the *extreme boundaries of
the West*, whence it resulted that *rational throats* quenched their
thirst for the first time at the streams of Europe, at some at least, if
not at all. But whether they were foreigners coming there for the first
time, or whether, *born in Europe*, they had returned there, they
brought with them a *triple* language."

Here is the text of this passage, so singular as it is, understood in a
literal sense:

"*Ex præcedenti memorata confusione linguarum non leviter opinamur per
universa mundi climata . . . tunc* 

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

*homines primum fuisse dispersos. Et cum radix humanæ propaginis
principaliter in oris orientalibus sit plantata; nec non ab inde ad
utrumque per difusos multipliciter* PALMITES. NOSTRA *fuit extensa*
PROPAGO; *demumque ad fines occidentales protracta, unde primitus tunc
vel totius Europæ, vel saltem quædam*, RATIONALIA GUTTURA *potaverunt.
Sed sive* ADVENÆ *tunc* PRIMITUS ADVENISSENT, *sive ad Europam* INDIGENÆ
REPETISSENT, *idioma secum* TRIFARIUM *homines attulerunt*."

However little it may now be remembered that, according to Dante, those
only are men who make use of their reason, others being brutes in his
eyes; that, further, he has taken care to explain to us in the *Vita
Nuova* that the name of palms, *palmieri*, was affected by those who had
made the pilgrimage to Jerusalem, it will be acknowledged that the true
meaning of this passage is quite different from that which we have given
it, and that it conceals another which is as follows:

Our doctrine had its origin in the East; its votaries, constituting the
true human race, were not at first spread all over the earth: it was by
slow degrees that our Sectarian race, *nostra propago*, multiplied
itself with the help of Syrian pilgrims, *palms palmieri*, who brought
the light to the confines of the West, and then rational throats, men
using their reason, quenched their thirst at the streams of Europe.
These missionaries of the sect being either Orientals or Europeans
returning to the country of their birth, they brought with them a
language of threefold meaning, allegorical, moral, and mystical.

To reject an interpretation so plain and so thoroughly in accordance
with all that we have previously seen, it would have to be explained how
it could have come into Dante's head that men were born in Europe, when
no rational throat had as yet drunk of its streams, that these Europeans
had been to the East to learn a triple language, to bring it back into
their own country, which no doubt had one of its own,

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

and that the human race born in the East had to people the West, already
inhabited by men, whether rational or not. Now this explanation is none
of the easiest.

It is always the case that these importers of the *triple language* are
divided into three bands, having each their own idiom; to one was
allotted the south of Europe, to another the north, to the third the
part of Asia and of Europe occupied by those who are now called Greeks,
*quos nunc Græcos vocamus*, as if they did not bear this name ages ago.
But let us explain: here it is a question of the refugees of the sect,
of the Sinon of the party, whom we have seen so ill-treated in hell, who
are also spoken of in the *Monarchy* under the name of *Greek pastors*.
These hold to white and yellow, as one of the aspects of Lucifer; they
have one foot on the European soil of the Catholics, the other on the
eastern land of the Manicheans, and, which is very disturbing, they
understand for the most part the artifices of the conventional
vocabulary. The three idioms were then subdivided in each of the regions
mentioned; but those of the north, such as the Hungarians, Slays,
Teutons, Saxons, and English kept the monosyllable *is* as the sign of
their common origin. For the rest of Europe there was a third idiom,
"though *it may not be perceived* that it is triple, *licet nec videatur
trifarium*." Among the inhabitants of this region, "some say, as
affirmation, *oc*, others *oil*, and others again *si*; that is to say,
Spaniards, French, and Italians. But what proves the common origin of
their idiom is that they use some of the same words to express many
things, such as *Dieu, ciel, amour, mer, terre, vivre, mourir, aimer,
and others besides*. \[*God, heaven, love, sea, earth, to live, to die,
to love*.\]"

Dante knew very well that the Spaniards did not use *oc* as an
affirmation, that they used *si* like the Italians, but he desired to
call attention to the chief centre of the Albigensian doctrine, to the
land of the langue *d’oc*, and not venturing to name Toulouse, he made
use of this very

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="small">visible artifice, especially when it is recognized
that the words which he mentions as revealing the common origin of the
language in the three countries are precisely those which the sectarian
poets so frequently use in their mysterious compositions.</span>

Aroux <span id="fr_93"></span>[\*](#fn_93.md) further explains that these
"importers" of the "triple language" were divided into three bands, each
having its own idiom: one set traversed the south of Europe, another the
north, another the part of Asia and Europe occupied by those now called
Greeks. Then Aroux breaks out in wrath: ''They have one foot on the
European soil of the Catholics, the other on the eastern land of the
Manichæans."

But it is from another of his interesting works <span
id="fr_94"></span>[†](#fn_94.md) that we get the most intimate details
about the organization of these Troubadour heretics, and their spiritual
teaching; the passages are so important that it is better to give them
in full. <span id="fr_95"></span>[‡](#fn_95.md)

<span class="small">The eminent professor <span
id="fr_96"></span>[§](#fn_96.md) whom we follow untiringly because he is an
authority on the subject, had no suspicion, when making researches into
the elements composing the</span>

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

*personnel* of Provençal literature, that he was digging into the
archives of the Albigensian Church. So it is, however, as will be shown
by a rapid estimate of these elements in the light of common sense. One
may believe with him that previous to the XIth century there were in the
south of France men, who under the name of jesters, *joculatores*, made
it their profession to recite or to sing romantic fictions. But it was
precisely because the apostles of the dissenting doctrine found this
custom established in the countries where it had survived the Roman
domination, that they eagerly adopted it for the furtherance of their
propaganda. For just as they excelled in turning to account the heroic
traditions, the religious fables of the various peoples in order to
engraft their ideas on this national foundation, they displayed
exceeding skill in adapting themselves, according to times and places,
to the manners and customs of the countries in which they carried on
their ministry. Thus they became *minnesingers* in Germany, bards and
skalds in Scandinavia, minstrels in England, *trouvères* in northern
France, troubadours and jugglers in ancient Aquitaine, *giullari*, men
of mirth, in Italy—leaving everywhere monuments of their genius and a'
most popular memory.

The missionaries of the heresy certainly preached the religion of love
long before the time when William of Poitiers spoke of them, towards
1100, by the name of Troubadours, for before winning over the higher
classes of society, their doctrines must have taken a long time to
filter through the lower ranks.

At the time of the complete organization <span
id="fr_97"></span>[\*](#fn_97.md) of the sectarian propaganda, that is to
say from 1150 to 1200, the most brilliant period of Provençal
literature, Fauriel rightly distinguishes different orders of
troubadours and jesters,

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

the very necessity of things having obliged their division into two
distinct classes. The one in fact addressing themselves more especially
to social parties, singing only for courts and castles; the other,
appealing more to popular instincts, composed for public places, for the
mercantile and working classes, for the country population. We have said
that the former were the dissenting bishops, combining the qualities of
the Perfect Knights and the Perfect Troubadours. We have explained how,
having no less courage than skill, knowing how at need to employ
cunning, and giving constant evidence of a patience and humility proof
against everything, they were of the type of Renaud de Montauban, the
chivalrous figure in contrast to Maître Renard, the symbolical
representative of the Roman clergy.

The latter, no less useful on account of the recruits that they
unceasingly made amongst the most numerous classes, amongst those who
had most to suffer from clerical oppression and exactions, furnished the
model of the knights errant, as also that of the wild knights
\["*chevaliers sauvages*"\], personified in the romance of which Guido
the Wild is the easily to be recognized hero.

Lastly, above these two orders of knights and troubadours, there was
that of the barons and feudal lords, who, having embraced the
Albigensian faith, having become its protectors or godfathers, carried
on the propaganda in their own way and in their own social sphere. These
men often cultivated poetry, and used it to impress on the nobility, and
still more on the *bourgeoisie*, ideas hostile to pontifical
omnipotence. Not only did they encourage the people to shake off the
theocratic yoke by setting them the example, but they further upheld
them and resolutely took up their defence against prelates, inquisitors
and legates, the Estults, Galaffrons, giants and necromancers that
abound in the romances of Geste. Thence, we have that heroic personage
Roland, in contrast to Master Issengrin; that son of Milo, whose
powerful words, under the name of Durendal, made

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

an enormous breach in the granite of the mountains, a breach through
which an invasion was made on to Spanish soil, where it could exclaim,
long before Louis XIV., "The Pyrenees exist no longer!"

These noble sectaries, of the type of the chivalric Roland, were, as a
matter of fact, feudal lords, true knights. As such, they did not
hesitate to confer in case of need, in accordance with the ideas of the
time, and especially in masonic \[? "*masseniques*"\] lodges, the order
of knighthood on distinguished members of their communion whom religious
or political interest drew into foreign countries.

On another side, observe how generously certain German Emperors—such as
a Conrad, an Otho, the two Fredericks—once came down into Italy, lent
themselves to bestowing the order of knighthood on the bourgeois of
Milan, on merchants and bankers of Genoa and Florence. For them it was a
means of recruiting their forces against the papacy, and of
strengthening in Italy an opposition which they well knew to be not
simply political. And Dante also is careful not to forget the families
who quartered on their shields "the arms of the great baron," vicar of
the Emperor Otho; and it is with pride that he recalls the promotion of
his great-great-grandfather Cacciaguida, knighted by Conrad.

As to the jesters, properly so-named jesters of song, of sayings, of
romance, as they were called—they must be distinguished from the *mimic*
jesters, that is to say, from the mountebanks and buffoons. The clerical
jesters were, as has already been said, evangelical ministers, still
subject to the preliminary discipline of the priesthood. Holding the
rank of deacons in the sectarian church, they were with regard to the
pastors to whom they were attached, in a position analogous to that of
squires to knights, and it is under this title that they figure in the
romances.

If distinguished troubadours are spoken of, and, among others, Giraud de
Borneil, as always accompanied by two

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

jesters, it is unquestionably that these troubadours were *Albigensian
bishops*, whose dignity and functions required the assistance of two
deacons. This is why it is said of them that "*They never went on a
tour* (episcopal) without having both of them in their retinue."

It would be a great mistake to think that the first corner could be
admitted to the functions of a jester. Fauriel will tell you that it was
necessary to have "an extraordinary memory, a fine voice, to be able to
sing well, to play well on the accompanying instrument, and also to have
a knowledge of history, of traditions, of genealogies. Several jesters
indeed are cited for their historical knowledge." The learned member of
the Institute thinks that this knowledge could not have been very great,
at a time when all history was reduced to barren chronicles; but is it
quite certain that their blunders, their anachronisms, their confounding
of personages, countries, and dates, may not be voluntary? Would they
not on the contrary be a proof that their knowledge in this respect was
much greater than one is willing to suppose? As to the genealogies, it
is a question of those of Geste's romances.

Besides the jesters attached to the person of the bishop or of the mere
pastor, were those who, having already completed their probation, went
forth, furnished with the recommendation of the one or the other, to
give instruction or carry consolation into courts and castles. It was
these who were called *elder sons* \[of age? "*fils majeurs*"\], deacons
of the first-class. The others, designated *younger sons* \[under age?
"*fils mineurs*"\], performed the same functions in towns and villages;
but for the most part their own special aptitudes marked them out for
the kind of service expected from them.

These two classes of one and the same priesthood were recruited from all
ranks of society, on the sole condition of uniting to a true vocation
the natural gifts and the knowledge

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

necessary for success in so difficult and dangerous a mission.

One curious matter, to state precisely, would be how many personages
came *down* into these poetic classes from a station generally
considered superior. Nothing was more common in the 12th and 13th
centuries, in the countries of the Provençal tongue, than to see
knights, castellans, canons, clerics, become troubadours or simple
jesters. Several of the most distinguished among both had begun by being
considerable personages in society. Peyrols had been a knight; Pierre
Cardinal was born of a noble and wealthy family; Pierre Roger had been a
canon at Clermont; Arnaud de Marueilh had been a clergyman, and the
famous Arnaud Daniel was a noble who had received a first-rate
education. Assuredly these men did not consider that they were lowering
themselves by embracing the apostolate, but on the contrary were raising
themselves in their own eyes and in those of their brethren. The
mysterious Sordello was a noble lord.

Moreover, how should knights such as Sordello, such as the Dauphin of
Auvergne and so many others, have hesitated to become troubadours out of
zeal for their faith, when kings like Richard of England and Peter of
Aragon, powerful suzerains like William of Poitiers, had declared
themselves professors of the Gay Science; when they added their voices
to those of the servants of love, to exalt, in interests perhaps less
religious than political, the mysterious and Perfect lady who under
various names—as star, flower, light—was appealed to, to cast down to
hell the Roman she-wolf, to crush the pontifical serpent? The *Infamous*
dates not from Voltaire.

Just as episcopal mandates, days for the sermons of preachers, and the
order of the offices, &c., are affixed to the doors of churches, so did
the troubadours give out their notices in the castles by a kind of
poetical programme, thus making known the lyric, pastoral or romantic
compositions

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

which were to serve as the text for their teachings. In how many places
was not the Divine Comedy thus recited and commented on before a select
audience? Fauriel cites as a specimen a whimsical piece by Pierre
Cardinal, "in which the author," he says, "envelops himself in veils of
allegory of the most fantastic kind till it appears to him
unintelligible." These veils would have appeared to him transparent if
he had understood the true composition of the balsam of Fierabras.

As this famous balsam, the unguent proclaimed by the troubadour knight
and probably bishop, Pierre Cardinal, the unguent which *heals all kinds
of wounds*, even the bites *of the venemous reptiles* (in the orthodox
ranks, be it understood)—is in fact none other than the word of the
Gospel; so also the *golden vessel* in which it is contained, the vessel
adorned with the most precious stones, is none other than the *Holy
Grail itself, or the book of the Gospels, as the Albigenses had adopted
and translated it; the golden book, the vessel containing the true
light, visible only to the initiated, to the professors of the gay
science* \["*du gay saber*"\]. Now, among the romances given out by
Pierre Cardinal, we find in the nick of time that of Tristan of Léonois,
so well-known to Dante, and which, celebrating the conquest of England
by the law of love, should have more than one claim to the interest of
the people of Provence.

We have seen, on the one hand, that the Albigensian clergy, so skilful
and so full of zeal, were recruited from the ranks of the priesthood as
well as from those of the nobility and the bourgeoisie; on the other
hand we have become convinced, from the interpretations that we have
given of the decrees of the Courts of Love and of the decisions in the
amorous casuistry, that ecclesiastics converted to the faith of Love
could not continue their cure of souls in the parish where they had
performed their vicarial functions.

What then became of those fresh recruits enrolled under

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

the banner of heresy when once dispossessed of their cure or of any
other sacerdotal function?

Like the other aspirants to the sectarian priesthood, they went into
seminaries or lodges to receive instruction; then, having become deacons
or squires, having undergone tests and given the required pledges, they
were admitted to the rank of Perfect Knights, or Perfect Troubadours.
Having thus graduated, they started in the character of missionaries or
of *pilgrims of love* ("pellegrini d’amore") as Dante says, sometimes
undertaking long and dangerous journeys. And so we find traces of them
everywhere, from the icy north and the depths of Germany even to the
east, in France and the low countries, in England, Spain and Italy. Then
it was that, in the symbolical language of the faithful in love, they
were called by the name of Knights-errant.

Preaching the doctrine of love, the true law of the Redeemer, their
mission was to redress the wrongs of Rome, to take up the defence of the
weak and oppressed; they were also represented and celebrated as the
true soldiers of the Christ, the champions of the poor, attacking under
all their forms the monstrous abuses of theocratic regime; as comforters
of the *widow* Rachel, that Gnostic church so cruelly tried by the
pontifical Herod; as the devoted supporters of the *sons of the widow*,
those humble members of the "massenie" of the Holy Grail; as the terror
of ogres, dragons, and giants.

Fauriel must then believe in them, writing: "It is unquestionable that
in all the countries in Europe in which there were Knights, there was
one particular class known by the title of *Knights errant;* " and he
cites in proof of this the tax which was levied upon them in 1241 by
Henry III. of England, who was in great need of money and would
naturally turn to his best allies to obtain it; would he necessarily
call them by their true name of Albigensian missionaries?

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

"It is in the poetical monuments of southern France, he adds, that I
find the most ancient traces of knight-errantry. What may be gathered
from them as a whole, is that the condition of Knight errant was rather
*accidental* and *transitory* than fixed and permanent." Where else
indeed than in Provence could one find more traces of their pilgrims of
love since Provence was their native soil? And was it not the least that
could be expected, after the trials of a wandering life, that these
zealous missionaries, called back to sedentary functions, might rest
after their prolonged fatigue?

Contrary to the romances which represent them as always solitary, and
running about in search of adventures, "the Provençal poets depict them
to us as usually travelling several together, and to all appearance
temporarily associated for some enterprise or common *quest*." Yes,
indeed! Exactly like the missionaries of our own times, and they were
always accompanied by their *socius*, whom the Troubadours, their
colleagues, turned into their squire.

One of the most illustrious among these knights-errant—an authentic
personage, at least as a Troubadour—was Raimbaud de Vaqueiras, whose
platonic *amours* with Madame Beatrice, who called him her *beautiful
knight* ("beau chevalier"), are extremely curious, but would make too
long an episode. We will merely say that Boniface, Marquis de
Montferrat, whose sister Raimbaud's Beatrice must have been, was one of
the nobles of the south of Europe who most especially occupied the
attention of the Troubadours, for the very simple reason that, sharing
their faith, he sheltered under his protection the Vaudois, whose cradle
was in the valleys of Piedmont.

Other knights are mentioned at the same period in the historical
monuments of the south of France and of the Catalogue, under the name of
the "*Chevalier Sauvages*"—*Wild Knights*. The romance entitled "Guido,
the Wild," presents the poetical personification of these *guides* or

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

pastors of Alpine districts. He figures in Ariosto's "Roland," which we
shall probably annotate some day, with some heroes whose symbolical
value is not more difficult to estimate.

An article of certain constitutions of James I., of Aragon, who wanted
to treat with Rome, forbade in 1234, the making of Wild Knights; another
article, says Fauriel, "seems to establish a connection between this
class of Knights and the jesters; it prohibits the giving of any
gratuities to a *jester* or to a *Wild Knight*." I can well believe it,
and such a connection was a matter of course. Was not the jester the
squire, the *socius* of the Wild Knight, and the King of Aragon wishing
to give pledges to Rome, how could he separate them in the prohibition
he was issuing? Would not the gratuity given to one have been given to
the other? The Wild Knights had in reality the closest relations with
the Knights errant; like them they were ministers of the proscribed
worship, forced to disguise their character carefully. They differed
from them on one point only, and that was that instead of going to a
foreign land to catechise and convert the orthodox population, they had
to fulfil their own ministry in their own native country. Further,
instead of exercising sedentary functions in a single parish, they had
to move over a much more extensive area. They were obliged to go up hill
and down dale, in Alpine districts, to carry the words of peace and
*consolation* to the isolated populations, who were too few in number to
have a resident pastor; and also to those whom persecution or the stake
had deprived of their own.

Unlike the ministers of towns, boroughs and castles, the *gentle*
knights, as titularies of this or that church, their *lady-love*—they
themselves were the pastors of the woods and mountains, compelled, in
order to feed their sheep, to travel through the wildest districts;
hence the name given to them by their co-religionists, who caused it to
be taken, like so many other conventional terms, outside their church,
in a totally different sense.

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

The most bitter feeling on the part of the Catholics was aroused from
the fact that the teachings they denounced were so closely allied to
those inculcated by themselves, and that the lives of the heretics shone
out as stars against the blackness of the mediæval monastic life. <span
id="fr_98"></span>[\*](#fn_98.md) Indeed, the majority of the higher
classes became Troubadours, and when prevented by persecution from
speaking, they took refuge in song, <span id="fr_99"></span>[†](#fn_99.md)
and treated their subjects sometimes seriously, sometimes lightly, but
ever was there, as we have seen, a dual meaning in *La gaie saber*, or
the "Art of loving": for the true "union of love," as Aroux points out,
meant the attachment of the "Perfect Chevalier" to the "celestial
chivalry," for such were those knights <span
id="fr_100"></span>[‡](#fn_100.md) called who gave themselves to the
service of the "Holy Grail," or the "Mystic Quest," *i.e.*, to the inner
service, or initiation, of their secret body. They were indeed:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The soldier-saints who, row on row,  
Burn upward each to his point of bliss.</span>

</div>

The perfect passion of self-sacrifice was theirs, and moved those men of
the Middle Ages to martyrdom and suffering in their zeal for the
spreading of the knowledge of the mystic doctrine. Such, for

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

instance, was Peter Waldo, <span id="fr_101"></span>[\*](#fn_101.md) who
became the founder of the powerful groups of Waldensians, <span
id="fr_102"></span>[†](#fn_102.md) or the "Poor of Lyons," a secret body
with masonic connections. He was first attracted to serious subjects by
a Troubadour who was reciting a poem in the streets of Lyons—a chant in
favour of the ascetic life; Waldo invited the Troubadour in, and from
that time became one of them.

We must here digress from the mystic aspect, in order to give a slight
outline on the general organisation, which can be taken from Baret's
admirable work on the subject; <span id="fr_103"></span>[‡](#fn_103.md) he
gives a chart of the chief School of Troubadours as follows: <span
id="fr_104"></span>[§](#fn_104.md)

<div align="center">

| The School of Provence  |                                               |

</div>

The general compositions of the Troubadours may be classified under the
following heads:

"The Gallant," "The Historical," "The Didactic," "The Satirical," and
the purely "Theological"; then

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

further, others we may term "The Mystical," or even "Hermetic"; the
"Satirical" were often theological from an essentially belligerent
standpoint. Baret emphasizes the fact that theological matters occupied
the attention of the Troubadours much more than history. Nostradamus
enumerates several works of this kind. <span
id="fr_105"></span>[\*](#fn_105.md) In the Vatican Library, says Baret,
there, are four anonymous treatises which belong to the Provençal
literature.

But the object which was the special search of the Inquisition was the
translation of the Bible into the Catalonian tongue, and very carefully
was this work concealed; for the organization of these mystic schools
was admirable and their bishops and deacons were disguised as
Troubadours. Throughout Spain, Germany, Italy and Central Europe, this
powerful "secret organization" extended with its mystic traditions.
Aroux, in connecting the Troubadours with the Albigenses on one side,
links them also to the Manichæan religion on the other, that most
pernicious—according to the Roman Church—of all heresies, because the
most vital; <span id="fr_106"></span>[†](#fn_106.md) and, indeed, nothing
but the wholesale bloodshed undertaken by

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

the Dominicans could have crushed out its public organization; still, it
lived again in other forms and under other names, and when Rutherford
and other writers connect the Manichæans with the Freemasons they are
touching a deeper truth than perhaps they know. As the above-mentioned
writer points out, the Troubadours and the "Steinmetzen or
Bridge-Builders" were connected, and "among them, too, the Freemasons
found ample occupation"; this is accurately true, for from Manes <span
id="fr_107"></span>[\*](#fn_107.md) " the widow's son," descends the
tradition which was common to Troubadour and Freemason; their
hieroglyphs were in many cases identical and the signs common to both.
Manes went into Egypt and brought back from thence the ancient
tradition, he who was crucified for reforming the Magian priesthood,
became the originator of the powerful symbolic phrase used among "the
sons of the widow" with its corresponding sign. It is this tradition
which underlies the well-known societies of the Knight Templars, the
Fratres Lucis, the Asiatische Brüder, and many others who have kept
alive the mystic teaching, and handed it on.

From the death of Manes, 276 A.D., there was

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

an intimate alliance <span id="fr_108"></span>[\*](#fn_108.md)—even a
fusion—with some of the leading Gnostic sects, and thence do we derive
the intermingling of the two richest streams of oriental Wisdom: the
one, directly through Persia from India; the other, traversing that
marvellous Egyptian period, enriched by the wisdom of the great Hermetic
teachers, flowed into Syria and Arabia, and thence with added
force—garnered from the new divine powers made manifest in the profound
mystery of the blessed Jesus—into Europe, through Northern Africa,
finding a home in Spain, where it took deep root. From this stock sprang
into full flower that richness of speech and song for which the
Troubadours will live for ever, Manichæans, who sang and chanted the
Esoteric Wisdom they dared not speak.

Next we see them dispersed in sects, taking local names—separated in
name only, but using the same secret language, having the same signs.
Thus, everywhere they journeyed, and, no matter by what name they were
called, each knew the other as a "widow's son," bound together on a
Mystic Quest, knitted—by virtue of a secret science—into one community;
with them came from the East the chivalric ideal, and they

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

chanted of love and sang of heaven: but the love was a "Divine Love,"
and their heaven was the wisdom and peace of those who sought the higher
life. As Aroux <span id="fr_109"></span>[\*](#fn_109.md) says, the chief
object which dominated the work of these "Trouveurs" \[Troubadours\] was
chivalry—"not the feudal, fighting, iniquitous chivalry, as corrupt as
it was ignorant," but that tone of thought which is well termed mystic,
and which sees in all life only a manifestation of the Divine power;
they fought for the purity of their ideal against the ever-increasing
corruption of the Roman Church.

A word must here be added on the origin of chivalry which is mistakenly
supposed to be of Christian inception. Viardot says:

<span class="small">In recalling what Christian Europe owes to the Arabs
with regard to knowledge, we must not omit what she owes to them with
regard to manners. The high civilization to which they had attained bore
its natural fruit, and the Arabs were no less distinguished by the
advance and the gentleness of their manners than by the extent and
variety of their knowledge. The humanity, the tolerance that they
displayed towards conquered nations, to whom they generously left their
possessions, their religion, their laws, and mostly their civic rights,
bore a striking testimony on this point, which was thoroughly confirmed
by their whole</span>

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

history. This high civilisation appeared under two chief
aspects—gallantry in private manners, chivalry in public manners.
Gallantry (as we will call the delicacy of social relations) arose among
them from the extreme reserve imposed on the two sexes, from the
severity of the laws and of opinion, in fine, from the cultivated mind
of the women, who knew how to inspire love and to command respect. In
all social relations, in all family customs, the Arabs showed extreme
austerity. "Those people," they said of the Spaniards, "are full of
courage, and endure privations with fortitude; but they live like wild
beasts, washing neither their bodies nor even their clothes, which they
only take off when they fall into rags, and *going into each other's
houses without asking permission*." <span
id="fr_110"></span>[\*](#fn_110.md)

Chivalry was the virtue of warriors. Founded on justice, it corrected
the abuses of force, which is the right of war; founded on humanity, it
tempered the excesses of hatred, reminding men of their brotherhood even
in the midst of combat; it was a kind of association or confraternity
between men of arms which drew together and united all its members when
politics or religion separated them, and which imposed on them noble
duties when all rights were t disowned. Chivalry was the most powerful
correction of feudalism by giving to the weak and the oppressed,
protectors and avengers . . .

Bravery, however, the sole virtue of German soldiers, was neither the
only one nor even the first, required of an Arab Knight. Ten qualities
were indispensable to give him a right to this name, namely: goodness,
valour, courtesy, poetry, elegance of speech, strength, horsemanship,
skill in the use of lance, sword and bow. <span
id="fr_111"></span>[†](#fn_111.md)

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

This "Celestial Chivalry"—Aroux demonstrates—was derived from the
"Albigensian Gospel," whose "Evangel" or "Gospel" was again derived from
the Manichæan-Marcion tradition. <span id="fr_112"></span>[\*](#fn_112.md)
These Albigenses were identical with the Cathari, and the Troubadours
were the links bearing the secret teaching from one body to another. "
Thus one sees them taking every form: by turns, artizans, colporteurs,
pilgrims, weavers, colliers . . . deprived of the right to speak, they
took to singing."

It must be remembered that simultaneously with the inflow of this
Manichæan Oriental wisdom into

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Spain, there had
been the same development in Italy from Sicily, and all through the
Danubian Provinces into Hungary, over the Caucasus to Russia, and along
the shores of the Caspian Seas; just as the legend of the Holy Grail was
everywhere, so also was this stream of thought, for the two were one.

The most prominent public development takes place, as we see, in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries, but the enormous spread of the teaching
was the result of centuries of quiet work. Travel was slow, and nearly
all communication was from person to person. Hence when we see in the
twelfth century the "flowering of the plant," it must be remembered that
this result was the work in each country of small bands of—even
isolated—-travelling mystics who were true missionaries in life and
heart.

To turn to another aspect it is curious to think of the Troubadours as
authorities in dress and etiquette. Rutherford says: <span
id="fr_113"></span>[\*](#fn_113.md) "They prepared the youth of both sexes
for society, and they drew up rules for their guidance therein," and
then he gives a most interesting quotation from a Troubadour, Amanieu
des Escas, who instructed a young man of rank while he was a Page or
Esquire as follows: "Shun the companionship of fools, impertinents, or
meddlers, lest you pass for the same. Never indulge in buffoonery,
scandals, deceit, or falsehood. Be frank, generous, and brave; be
obliging and kind; study neatness in your dress,

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

and let elegance of fashion make up for plainness of material. Never
allow a seam to remain ripped and gaping; it is worse than a rent; the
first shows ill-breeding, the last only poverty, which is by far the
lesser evil of the two. There is no great merit in dressing well if you
have the means: but a display of neatness and taste on a small income is
a sure token of superiority of spirit," etc., etc. There is much more of
the same kind, but this citation serves to show how eminently practical
was the advice given to the young men in olden days.

Very bitter and violent were the attacks made upon these men by the
monks, who were jealous of the real purity and asceticism of these
heretical Troubadours, and who were infuriated at the publicity given to
their own misdeeds; such an attack is graphically described by Hueffer
in his thoughtful work on the Troubadours. The writings of "Izarn the
Monk," for instance, he well describes as a "striking specimen of
monkish effrontery" and he proceeds to criticise the "unctuous
self-laudation" of his work, the *Novas del Heretge*, or the *Tale of a
Heretic*, a dialogue between the author and a bishop of the Albigeois
sect.

"The opening lines," says Hueffer, "are important to the historian of
theology. They prove that the Neo-Manichæan heretics believed, or at
least were said by the Catholics to believe, in something very like
metempsychosis. 'Tell me,' the monk begins, 'in what school you have
learned that the spirit of man,

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

when it has lost its body, enters an ox, an ass, or a horned wether, a
hog, or a hen, whichever it sees first, and migrates from one to the
other until a new body of man or woman is born for it? . . . This thou
hast taught to deluded people, whom thou hast given to the devil and
taken away from God. May every place and every land that has supported
thee perish!'" <span id="fr_114"></span>[\*](#fn_114.md)

It is curious and suggestive to find that St. Francis of Assisi had been
a Troubadour; Görres <span id="fr_115"></span>[†](#fn_115.md) speaks of him
as a "genuine Troubadour," and there is no doubt that he and some of his
Franciscans were at one time members of the heretical Cathari: indeed it
is questionable whether he was at any time an orthodox Churchman,
though—like that other Troubadour, Dante—the Church has ever claimed him
as a "faithful son."

A few words must now be devoted to what may be termed the general
position of the Troubadours, the place and functions of some of them at
least. Among the most illustrious of the Troubadours was Alfonso the
Second, King of Arragon (1162-1196). Ticknor <span
id="fr_116"></span>[‡](#fn_116.md) says: "From 1209 to 1229, the shameful
war which gave birth to the Inquisition was carried on with
extraordinary cruelty against the Albigenses, a religious sect in
Provence, accused of heresy, but persecuted rather by an implacable
political ambition.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To this sect—which
in some points opposed the pretensions of the See of Rome, and was at
last exterminated by a crusade under the Papal Authority—belonged nearly
all the contemporary Troubadours, whose poetry is full of their
sufferings and remonstrances. <span id="fr_117"></span>[\*](#fn_117.md) In
their great distress, the principal ally of the Albigenses and
Troubadours was Peter the Second of Arragon, who in 1213 perished nobly
fighting in their cause at the disastrous battle of Muret. When
therefore the Troubadours of Provence were compelled to escape from the
burnt and bloody ruins of their homes, not a few of them hastened to the
friendly Court of Arragon, sure of finding themselves protected, and
their art held in honour, by princes who were at the same time poets."
These passages and the accompanying notes are of importance to students,
for they show how intimate a part was played by the Troubadours in the
religious movements of the period; and how they were instruments in
keeping the mystic teaching alive, and in handing on the Wisdom of the
east clothed in this, its latest, poetical disguise.

In Germany also the Troubadours dwelt in high places, for, according to
M. de Saint-Peloie, the Baron

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Zurlandben had
just (1773) found a MS. in the library of the King, containing the
sonnets of princely Troubadours, written about the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries. Among these royal writers were the Emperor Henry
VI., Conradin, King of Bohemia, and other Princes, Electors, Dukes and
Margraves.

The emotional life of the young European nations was largely educated by
means of the chivalric romances, based, as they were, on the highest
religious and mystic teaching; and later, in 1400-1500, the Celestial
Chivalry was the great standard set before the people, as a national
ideal.

Says Ticknor: <span id="fr_118"></span>[\*](#fn_118.md) "Religious romances
were written . . . in the form of Allegories, like the 'Celestial
Chivalry,' the 'Christian Chivalry,' 'The Knight of the Bright Star'";
and this author remarks that the object of that interesting book—the
*Celestial Chivalry*, written by Hierónimo de San Pedro (at Valencia, in
1554) was to drive out of the world "the profane books of chivalry."

The titles he uses are worth attention, the first part being called "The
Root of the Fragrant Rose"; the second, "The Leaves of the Rose." The
names are suggestive, for it was just at this period, when, owing to
bitter persecution, the Cathari and Albigenses were nearly
exterminated, <span id="fr_119"></span>[†](#fn_119.md) that the
Rosicrucians

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

began to revive the same old Eastern tradition, and the blessed
Christian Rosencreutz turned his steps eastwards, and in Arabia spent
three years fitting himself for the work to come.

The Rose was one of the ancient traditional mystic symbols, re-adapted
by the Rosicrucians, and used, indeed, by all sectaries and mystics
Aroux <span id="fr_120"></span>[\*](#fn_120.md) asserts that the famous
*Roman de la Rose* <span id="fr_121"></span>[†](#fn_121.md) was not only a
satire against the Pontifical Court, but also the apotheosis of heresy,
for it contained the Hermetic Science under the guise of a religious
poem.

Rossetti <span id="fr_122"></span>[‡](#fn_122.md) is as emphatic about this
symbolic language, and Warton <span id="fr_123"></span>[§](#fn_123.md)
gives us the following suggestive hints: "In the preface of the edition
\[to this poem,\] printed in the year 1583, all this allegory is turned
to religion. The Rose is proved to be a state of grace or divine wisdom,
or eternal beatitude, or the Holy Virgin to which heretics cannot gain

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

access. It is the White Rose of Jericho, . . . . the chemists made it a
search for the Philosopher's Stone." There is ever a mystery in the
crucified Rose, typical of light and glory springing from the blood of
Adonis, himself Dionysus, the best of heavenly beings. Endless are the
exquisitely beautiful and refined symbolic meanings of the sacred Rose.

Thus as we study the Troubadours it becomes evident that an enormous
under-current of secret teaching was being carried on, and Rutherford
gives us some important hints on this point which have been previously
noticed <span id="fr_124"></span>[\*](#fn_124.md) but may again be usefully
referred to since they illustrate this particular fact and verify much
that is said by Aroux.

<span class="small">The body of the learned in the Middle Ages—or the
inner circle of that body—seems to have formed a secret society, whose
purpose was to keep as much knowledge as possible confined to itself,
after the manner of the Druids, or of the Egyptians and Chaldæn Sages;
when compelled to put the more occult portions of their scientific
acquirements into a more permanent form they adopted one perfectly
unintelligible to the vulgar. Some wrapped up their more valuable
secrets in parables, others threw them again into the shape of
illuminations, and others again adopted the device of Roger' Bacon, who,
giving the name of an important ingredient of gunpowder in an anagram,
rendered the whole receipt for the composition of the substance a
complete mystery to the uninitiated.</span>

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

It has been said that Rutherford has allied the Troubadours with the
Freemasons, and the latter body has an undoubtedly Manichæan tradition.
For confirmation on this point we can refer to what is said by a very
well-known Masonic authority, <span id="fr_125"></span>[\*](#fn_125.md)
whose knowledge about Masonry is unquestionable:

<span class="small">Sons of the Widow <span
id="fr_126"></span>[†](#fn_126.md)—a powerful society founded by Manes, a
Persian slave . . . . and continued to the present day; it consisted of
two degrees: 1. Auditor. 2. Elect. It was at peace under the Mother of
the Emperor Anastasius (A.D. 491-518), but was persecuted by Justin. In
the course of time, its agents secretly instigated the Crusades; but
being betrayed, had to veil their mysteries under many names. In
Bulgaria and Lombardy it was known as the Society of the Paterini, in
France as the Cathari and Albigenses, and from it originated the
Hussites, Wyckliffites, and Lollards. The Dutch sect of the Family of
Love also sprang from it.</span>

Such is the statement of a high Mason on this connection, corroborating
the links that have already been outlined, and many more might be
instanced, showing that all the tenets of these mediæval sects of
Troubadours are traceable to Gnostic and Manichæistic doctrines. Very
wonderful is the part filled by the "Messengers of Love" in the
spiritual evolution of Europe during the Dark Ages. Martyrs many,

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

and Saints not a few—such will be the roll-call of the Minniesängers,
Troubadours, and Bards of these olden days, when in the future the
Ancient Wisdom once more reigns supreme.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[110:‡](mmm05.htm#fr_95.md) The phrases "True human
race" and "Sectarians" are generally applied to Mystics, also to the
Manichæans, Albigenses, Troubadours, Palmers, and Palmieri; it meant
those men and women throughout the world, of every nation and in every
clime, who were seeking the inner life in its true sense; and who will
be the "first fruits" of the "Redeemer," in the mystical sense.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[110:§](mmm05.htm#fr_96.md) Aroux is here referring
to Fauriel (M.P., Paris), whose works on the Provençal literature have
been so often quoted in these pages.

Dualism is added the doctrine of transmigration as a means of reward and

with Gnostic and Buddhist elements, that his doctrines found favour with

<span id="fn_107"></span>[123:\*](mmm05.htm#fr_107.md) Mani—or Cubricus—was
the pupil of Terebinthe (who was afterwards called Buddas). He was an
Egyptian Philosopher, and from him Manes received the Hermetic
tradition; Manichæism was based on the Ancient Babylonian religion with
Christian, Persian and Egyptian elements introduced. The Gnostics who
joined the Manichæan stream were the Basilideans, Marcionites, and
Bardesanites. See Beausobre (M. de), *Histoire critique de Manichée*, 2

<span id="fn_108"></span>[124:\*](mmm05.htm#fr_108.md) Says Lea: "Of all
the heresies with which the early Church had to contend, none had
excited such mingled fear and loathing as Manichæism." And again: "The
Manichæism of the Cathari, Patarins, or Albigenses, was not a mere
speculative dogma of the schools, but a faith which aroused fanaticism

"*Every Knight has the power to create Knights*. There is in the hand
and in the sword of every Knight a power (I nearly wrote 'a fluid,' but
I did not dare) which is really capable of creating other

<span id="fn_111"></span>[126:†](mmm05.htm#fr_111.md) "Fue muy buen
caballero, y se decia de él que tenia las diez prendas qué distinguen à
los nobles y generosos, qué consisten en <span id="page_127">p.

fuerza, destreza en la lanza, en la espada, y en el tirar del arco." (J.
Conde, perto II., cap. 63.)

He was an excellent Knight, and it was said of him that he possessed the
ten accomplishments that distinguish nobles and honourable men, which
consist in goodness, valour, horsemanship, courtesy, poetry, excellence
of speech, ability, skill in lance, sword, and in drawing the bow.

The word "gentileza" or "gentillesse," which has greatly changed in
meaning with the lapse of time, means charming manners, the good tone of
a man well born and well bred, of one whom the English call a
*gentleman*. Viardot (L), *Histoire des Arabes et des Mores d’ Espagne*,
ii., pp. 197, 199. Paris, 1851.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[127:\*](mmm05.htm#fr_112) Lea (H. C..md), *op.
cit.*, i. 92: A further irrefragable evidence of the derivation of
Catharism from Manichæism is furnished by the sacred thread and garment
which were worn by all the Perfect among the Cathari. This custom is too
peculiar to have had an independent origin, and is manifestly the
Mazdean *kosti and saddarah*, the sacred thread and shirt, the wearing
of which was essential to all believers, and the use of which, by both
Zends and Brahmins, shows that its origin is to be traced to the
prehistoric period anterior to the separation of those branches of the
Aryan family. Among the Cathari the wearer of the thread and vestment
was what was known among the inquisitors as the '*hæreticus indutus*' or
'*vestitus*,' initiated into all the mysteries of the heresy."

and horrors of the war of the Albigenses, and Llorente (*Histoire de l’

war with the origin of the Inquisition. The fact that nearly all the
Troubadours took part with the persecuted Albigenses is equally
notorious. *Histoire Litt. de la France*, tom. xviii., p. 588.
