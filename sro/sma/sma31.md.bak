### CHAPTER VI.

The Emperor Lewis the Bavarian--Charles IV.--Wenceslaus--Rupertian
Reformation--Encroachments of the Fehm-courts--Case of Nickel Weller and
the town of Görlitz--Of the City of Dantzig--Of Hans David and the
Teutonic Knights--Other instances of the presumption of the
Free-counts--Citation of the Emperor Frederic III.--Case of the Count of
Teckenburg.

THE history of the Fehm-gerichte, previous to the fifteenth century,
offers but few events to detain at-attention. The Emperor Lewis the
Bavarian appears to have exerted his authority on several occasions in
granting privileges in Westphalia according, as it is expressly stated,
to the Fehm-law. His successor, the luxurious Charles IV., acted with
the same caprice respecting the Fehm-tribunals as he did in every thing
else, granting privileges and revoking them just as it seemed to accord
with his interest at the moment. This monarch attempted also to extend
the Fehm-system beyond Westphalia, deeming it perhaps a good mean for
bringing all Germany under the authority of his patrimonial kingdom of
Bohemia. He therefore gave permission to the Bishop of Hildesheim to
erect two Free-tribunals out of Westphalia. On the representations of
the Archbishop of Cologne and the lords of Westphalia, however, he
afterwards abolished them.

Wenceslaus, the son of Charles, acted with his usual folly in the case
of the Fehm-tribunals; he is said, as he could keep nothing secret, to
have blabbed their

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

private sign, and he took on him to make frei-schöppen, contrary to the
law, out of Westphalia. These schöppen of the emperor's making did not,
however, meet with much respect from the genuine ones, as the answer
given to the Emperor Rupert by the Westphalian tribunals evinces. On his
asking how they acted with regard to such schöppen, their reply was, "We
ask them at what court they were made schöppen. Should it appear that
they were made schöppen at courts which had no right so to do, we hang
them, in case of their being met in Westphalia, on the instant, without
any mercy." Wenceslaus, little as he cared about Germany in general,
occasionally employed the Fehm-courts for the furtherance of his plans,
and, in the year 1389, he had Count Henry of Wernengerode tried and
hanged for treason by Westphalian schöppen. The reign of Wenceslaus is
particularly distinguished by its being the period in which the
Archbishop of Cologne arrived at the important office of lieutenant of
the emperor over all the Westphalian tribunals.

The reign of Rupert was, with respect to the Westphalian Fehm-courts,
chiefly remarkable by the reformation of them named front him. This
reformation, which is the earliest publicly-accredited source from which
a knowledge of the Fehm-law can be derived, was made in the year 1404.
It is a collection of decisions by which the rights and privileges of a
king of the Romans are ascertained with respect to these tribunals.

The Rupertian reformation, and the establishment of the office of
lieutenant in the person of the Archbishop of Cologne, which was
completed by either Rupert or his successor Sigismund, form together an
epoch in the history of the Fehm-gerichte. Hitherto Westphalia alone was
the scene of their operations, and their authority was of evident
advantage to the

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

empire. Their power had now attained its zenith; confidence in their
strength led them to abuse it; and, during the century which elapsed
between the Rupertian reformation and the establishment of the Perpetual
Public Peace and the Imperial Chamber by the Emperor Maximilian, we
shall have to contemplate chiefly their abuses and assumptions.

The right of citation was what was chiefly abused by the Free-courts.
Now that they were so formally acknowledged to act under the imperial
authority, they began to regard Westphalia as too narrow a theatre for
the display of their activity and their power. As imperial
commissioners, they maintained that their jurisdiction extended to every
place which acknowledged that of the emperor's, and there was hardly a
corner of Germany free from the visits of their messengers; nay, even
beyond the limits of the empire men trembled at their citations.

It was chiefly the towns which were harassed by these citations, which
were frequently issued at the instance of persons whom they had punished
or expelled for their misdeeds. Their power and consequence did not
protect even the greatest: we find, during the fifteenth century, some
of the principal cities of the empire summoned before the tribunals of
Westphalian counts. Thus in the records of those times we read of
citations served on Bremen, Lübeck, Augsburg, Nuremberg, Erfurt,
Görlitz, and Dantzig. Even Prussia and Livonia, then belonging to the
order of the Teutonic knights, were annoyed by their interference.

One of the most remarkable cases which this period presents is that of
the uneasiness, caused to the town of Görlitz by means of one of its
inhabitants named Nickel Weller. This man, who was a Westphalian
schöppe, was accused of having disinterred an unchristened child, and of
having made

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

a candle of the bone of its arm, which he had filled with the wax of an
Easter-taper and with incense, and of having employed it in a barn in
presence of his mother, his wife, and an old peasant, for magical
purposes. As he could not deny the fact, he was, according to the law of
those times, liable to be hanged; but the high-bailiff of Stein, and
some other persons of consequence, interfering in his favour, the
magistrates contented themselves with expelling him the town and
confiscating his goods. As it afterwards proved, they would have acted
more wisely had they condemned him to perpetual imprisonment.

Weller immediately repaired to Bresslau, and besought the council, the
Bishop of Waradein, and the imperial chancellor, to advocate his cause.
They acceded to his desire; but the magistrates of Görlitz perfectly
justified their conduct. Weller, still indisposed to rest, applied to
the pope, Innocent VIII., asserting that he could not to any purpose
bring an accusation against the council of Görlitz within the town of
the diocese of Meissen, and that he had no chance of justice there. The
pope forthwith named John de' Medici and Dr. Nicholas Tauchen of
Bresslau spiritual commissioners in this affair, and these desired the
high-bailiff of Stein to do his best that Weller should recover his
rights within the space of a month, on his taking his oath to the truth
of his statements, otherwise they should be obliged themselves to take
measures for that purpose.

From some unassigned cause, however, nothing came of this, and Weller
once more addressed himself to the pope, with whom the Bishop of Ostia
became his advocate, He was re-admitted into the bosom of the Church;
but the decree of the magistracy of Görlitz still remained in force, and
the new commissioners appointed by the pope even confirmed it.

Finding that he had nothing to expect from papal

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

interference, Weller had at last recourse to the Fehm-tribunals, and on
the 3d May, 1490, John of Hulschede, count of the tribunal at Brackel,
cited the burgomasters, council, and all the lay inhabitants of Görlitz
above the age of eighteen years, before his tribunal. This summons was
served in rather a remarkable manner, for it was found fastened to a
twig on a hedge, on a farm belonging to a man named Wenzel Emmerich, a
little distance from the town.

As by the Golden Bull of the Emperor Charles IV., and moreover by a
special privilege granted by Sigismund, Görlitz was exempted from all
foreign jurisdiction, the magistracy informed Vladislaus, King of
Bohemia, of this citation, and implored his mediation. The Bohemian
monarch accordingly addressed himself to the tribunal at Brackel, but
George Hackenberg, who was at that time the free-count of that court,
Hulschede being dead, did not even deign to give him an answer.

Meanwhile the appointed period had elapsed without the people of Görlitz
having appeared to the summons, and Weller, charging them with
disobedience and contempt of court, prayed that they might be condemned
in all the costs and penalties thereby incurred, and that he might be
himself permitted to proceed with his complaint. To this end he
estimated the losses and injuries which he had sustained at 500 Rhenish
florins, and made a declaration to that effect on oath, with two
joint-swearers. He was accordingly authorised by the court to indemnify
himself in any manner he could at the expense of the people of Görlitz.
It was farther added that, if any one should impede Weller in the
prosecution of his rights, that person should *ipso facto* fall under
the heavy displeasure of the empire and the pains and penalties of the
tribunal at Brackel, and be moreover obliged to pay all the costs of the
accuser.

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

On the 16th August of the same year, the count set a new peremptory term
for the people of Görlitz, assuring them that, in case of disobedience,
"he should he obliged, though greatly against his inclination, to pass
the heaviest and most rigorous sentence on their persons, their lives,
and their honour." The citation was this time found on the floor of the
convent church. The council in consternation applied to the Archbishop
of Cologne and to the free-count himself, to be relieved from this
condition, but in vain; the count did not condescend to take any notice
of their application, and when they did not appear at the set time,
declared the town of Görlitz outlawed for contumacy.

It appears that Weller had, for some cause or other, brought an
accusation against the city of Bresslau also; for in the published
decree of outlawry against Görlitz it was included. By this act it was
prohibited to every person, under penalty of similar outlawry, to
harbour any inhabitant of either of these towns; to eat or drink, or
hold any intercourse with them, till they had reconciled themselves to
the Fehm-tribunals, and given satisfaction to the complainant. Weller
himself stuck up a copy of this decree on a market-day at Leipzig; but
it was instantly torn down by some of the people of Görlitz who happened
to be there.

The two towns of Görlitz and Bresslau held a consultation at Liegnitz,
to devise what measures it were best to adopt in order to relieve
themselves from this system of persecution. They resolved that they
would jointly and separately defend themselves and their proceedings by
a public declaration, which should be posted up in Görlitz, Bresslau,
Leipzig, and other places. They also resolved to lay their griefs before
the Diet at Prague, and pray for its intercession with the Archbishop of
Cologne and the Landgraf

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

of Hessen. They accordingly did so, and the Diet assented to their
desire; but their good offices were of no avail, and the answer of the
landgraf clearly showed, either that he had no authority over his count,
or that he was secretly pleased with what he had done.

The indefatigable Weller now endeavoured to seize some of the people of
Bresslau and Görlitz, in Hein and other places in Meissen. But they
frustrated his plans by obtaining a promise of protection and
safe-conduct from the Duke George. Weller, however, did not desist, and
when Duke Albert came from the Netherlands to Meissen, he sought and
obtained his protection. But here again he was foiled; for, when the
high-bailiff and council of Görlitz had informed that prince of the real
state of the case, he withdrew his countenance from him. Wearied out by
this ceaseless teasing, the towns applied, through the king of Bohemia,
to the Emperor Frederic III. for a mandate to all the subjects of the
empire, and an inhibition to the tribunal at Brackel and all the
free-counts and schöppen. These, when obtained, they took care to have
secretly served on the council of Dortmund and the free-count of
Brackel. By these means they appear to have put an end to their
annoyances for the remainder of Weller's life. But, in the year 1502,
his son and his son-in-law revived his claims on Görlitz. Count Ernest
of Hohenstein interceded for them; but the council adhered firmly to
their previous resolution, and declared that it was only to their own or
to higher tribunals that they must look for relief. The matter then lay
over for ten years, when it was again stirred by one Guy of Taubenheim,
and was eventually settled by an amicable arrangement.

As we have said, the Fehm-tribunals extended their claims of
jurisdiction even to the Baltic. We

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

find that a citizen of the town of Dantzig, named Hans Holloger, who was
a free schöppe, was cited to appear before the tribunal of
Elleringhausen, under the hawthorn, "because he had spoken what he ought
not to have spoken about the Secret Tribunal." This might seem just
enough, as he belonged to the society; but the town-council were
commanded, under a penalty of fifty pounds of fine gold, to cast the
accused into prison till he had given security for standing his trial.

Even the powerful order of the Teutonic Knights, who were the masters of
Prussia and Livonia, did not escape being annoyed by the Fehm-tribunals.
How little their power availed against that formidable jurisdiction is
evinced by the answer made by the Grand Master to the towns which sued
to him for protection. "Beloved liegemen! you have besought us to
protect you therefrom; we would cheerfully do it knew we but ways and
means thereto." And when he wrote to Mangolt, the count of the tribunal
at Freyenhagen, warning him against summoning before him the subjects of
the order, the latter haughtily replied, You have your rights from the
empire, and I have power to judge over all who hold of the empire."

The following very curious case occurred in the first half of the
fifteenth century:--

A shopkeeper at Liebstadt died very much indebted to the two officers of
the Teutonic order, whose business it was to keep the small towns in
Prussia supplied with mercantile goods, and they accordingly seized on
the effects which he had left behind him. These, however, were not
sufficient to satisfy even the demands of one of them, much less of
both, and they had made up their minds to rest content with the loss,
when, to their surprise, Hans David, the son of the deceased, came
forward with

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

an account against the order of such amount, that, as it was observed,
if all the houses in the town were sold, and all the townsmen taxed to
the utmost, the produce would not discharge the one-half of it. He
however produced a document purporting to be a bond of the order. This
instrument bore all the marks of falsification; it was full of erasures
and insertions; among the witnesses to it, some were set down as priors
who were only simple brethren of the order; there were the names of
others who had never seen it; it was asserted to have been attested and
verified by the tribunal at Passnar, but in the records of that court
there were not the slightest traces of it; the seal of the Grand Master,
which was appended to every document of any importance, was wanting Of
course payment was resisted, but Hans David was told to pursue his
claim, if he pleased, before the emperor and the pope, whom the order
recognised as their superiors.

As Hans David was under the protection of the king of Poland, he had
recourse to that prince; but he declined interfering any farther than to
apply for a safe-conduct for him that he might apply for a new inquiry.
The Grand Master, on application being made to him, swore on his honour
that he owed to the complainant nothing, and that the bond was a
forgery; he moreover promised to answer the charge in any fit place that
the complainant might select; nay, even in Prussia, and he granted him a
safe-conduct as before.

It is not known what course Hans David now adopted; but nine years
afterwards (1441) we find him addressing himself to the Free-tribunal at
Freyenhagen, whose count, the notorious Mangolt, forthwith issued his
citations, "because, as he expressed himself, the order judges with the
sword and gentle murder and burning." The Grand Master,

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

indignant at this piece of arrogance, immediately brought the matter
before the assembly of the free-counts at Coblentz, who declared the
proceedings null, and Mangolt liable to punishment, as the knights were
spiritual persons. He moreover applied to the emperor, who, to gratify
him, issued a mandate, addressed to all princes of the empire, declaring
the act of Mangolt to be a piece of iniquity, and null and void.

Hans David was now cast into prison at Cologne, and, notwithstanding a
prohibition of the Free-tribunal, was detained there for two years.
Existing documents attest (though the fact is inexplicable) that the
emperor directed the Archbishop of Cologne and the Margraf of Baden to
examine anew into the affair, and to send the acts into the imperial
chancery, and, finally, to set the complainant free on his oath, or on
his giving bail to appear at Nuremberg. As this proceeding can only be
ascribed to the influence of the Secret Tribunals, bent on annoying the
order, it serves to show what their power and consequence must have been
at that time.

Two years afterwards it was clearly proved at Vienna that the bond had
beer}, forged, at the desire of Hans David, by a scholar of Elbingen,
named Rothofé. As the case against the former was now so plain, it might
be supposed that he would be punished at once. Instead of that, the
emperor referred the parties to the pope, as Hans David had struck a
prior of the order, and this last was not content with the satisfaction
accorded by the emperor.

The cause of the-'order was triumphant in Rome also, yet still Hans
David found means to keep off the execution of the sentence already
passed on him at Vienna. It was -not till after the death of the then
Grand Master that final judgment was formally delivered by Cardinal
Jossi, and Hans David, his comrade

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Paul Frankleuen,
and the Count Mangolt, were condemned to perpetual silence, and to
payment of the sum of 6,000 Rhenish florins to the order, and, in case
of disobedience, they were declared to be outlawed. All this, however,
did not yet avail, and two years afterwards Jossi was obliged to apply
to the emperor for the aid of the temporal arm for the execution of the
sentence. The chaplain of the order at Vienna also found that Hans David
had still the art to deceive many and gain them over to his cause, and
he accordingly took care to have the whole account of his conduct posted
up on the church-doors.

Still the unwearied Hans David did not rest. He now went to the
Free-tribunal at Waldeck, and had the art to deceive the count by his
false representations. He assured him that the order had offered him no
less than 15,000 florins and an annuity, if he would let his action
drop; that they would have been extremely well content if he had escaped
out of prison at Cologne, but that he preferred justice and truth to
liberty. The order however succeeded here again in detecting and
exposing his arts, and the count honestly confessed that he had been
deceived by him. He cast him off forthwith, and Hans David, ceasing to
annoy the order, devoted himself to astrology and conjuring for the rest
of his days <span id="fr_129"></span>[\*](#fn_129.md).

He had, however, caused [the order](errata.htm#28.md) abundance of

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

uneasiness and expense. Existing documents prove that this affair cost
them no less than upwards of 1580 ducats, and 7000 florins, which must
be in a great measure ascribed to the secret machinations of the
Free-tribunals, anxious to depress the Teutonic Knights, who stood in
their way.

In 1410 the Wild and Rhein Graf was summoned before the tribunal at
Nordernau, and, in 1454, the Duke of Saxony before that at Limburg. The
Elector-Palatine found it difficult, in 1448, to defend himself against
a sentence passed on him by one of the Fehm-courts. Duke Henry of
Bavaria found it necessary on the following occasion, actually to become
a [frei-schöppe](errata.htm#29.md) in order to save himself. One Gaspar, of
Torringen, had accused him before the tribunal of Waldeck of "having
taken from him his hereditary office of Chief Huntsman; of having seized
and beaten his huntsmen and servants, taken his hounds, battered down
his castle of Torringen, and taken from his wife her property and
jewels, in despite of God, honour, and ancient right." The free-count
forthwith cited the duke, who applied to the emperor Sigismund, and
procured an inhibition to the count. The duke found it necessary,
notwithstanding, to appear before the court; but he adopted the
expedient of getting himself made a frei-schöppe, and then, probably in
consequence of his rank and influence, procured a sentence to be passed
in accordance with his wishes. Gaspar, who was probably an injured man,
appealed to the emperor, who referred the matter to the Archbishop of
Cologne, and. we are not informed how it ended.

But the audacity of the free-counts went so far as even to cite the head
of the empire himself before their tribunals. The imperial chancery
having, for just and good cause, declared several free-counts and their
Tribunal-lord, Walrabe of Waldeck, to be outlawed,

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

three free-counts had the hardihood, in 1470, to cite the emperor
Frederic III., with his chancellor, the Bishop of Passau, and the
assessors of the chancery-court, to appear before the free-tribunal
between the gates of Wünnenberg in the diocese of Paderborn, "there to
defend his person and highest honour under penalty of being held to be a
disobedient emperor;" and on his not appearing, they had the impudence
to cite him again, declaring that, if he did not appear, justice should
take its course. Feeble, however, as was the character of the emperor,
he did not give way to such assumptions.

Even robbery and spoliation could find a defence with the Fehm-courts.
Towards the end of the thirteenth century a count of Teckenburg
plundered and ravaged the diocese of Münster. The bishop assembled his
own people and called on his allies to aid him, and they took two
castles belonging to the count and pushed him to extremity. To extricate
himself he accused the bishop, and all those who were with him, before
his Fehm-court, and though there were among them the Bishop of
Paderborn, three counts, and several knights, the free-count had the
boldness to cite them all to appear and defend their 'honour. The affair
was eventually amicably arranged and the citation recalled.

These instances may suffice to show how far the Fehm-tribunals had
departed from the original object of their institution, and how corrupt
and iniquitous they were become.

of his predictions, delivered by him, under the name of Master Von
Dolete, in the year 1457: "In the ensuing month, September, the sun will
appear like a black dragon; cruel winds will blow, the sea will roar,
and men will be knocked to pieces by the wind. The sun will then be
turned to blood; that betokeneth war in the East and West. A mighty
emperor will die; the earth will quake, and few men will remain alive.
Wherefore secure your houses and chambers; lay up provisions for thirty
days in caverns," &e., &c. The arts of knaves and the language of
impostors are the same in all ages and countries.
