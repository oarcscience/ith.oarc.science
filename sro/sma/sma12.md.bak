THE unhallowed rule of Mohammed II. lasted for the long space of
thirty-five years, during which time all the practices of Islam were
neglected by the Ismaïlites. The mosks were closed, the fast of Ramazan
neglected, the solemn seasons of prayer despised. But such a state can
never last; man must have religion; it is as essential to him as his
food; and those pseudo-philosophers who have endeavoured to deprive him
of it have only displayed in the attempt their ignorance and folly. The
purification of the popular faith is the appropriate task of the true
philanthropist.

We may often observe the son to exhibit a character the diametrically
opposite of that of his father, either led by nature or struck by the
ill effects of his father's conduct. This common appearance was now
exhibited among the Assassins. Mohammed disregarded all the observances
of the ceremonial law; his son and successor, Jellal-ed-deen (Glory of
Religion) Hassan, distinguished himself, from his early years, by a zeal
for the ordinances of Islam. The avowal of his sentiments caused
considerable enmity and suspicion between him and Mohammed; the father
feared the son, and the son the father. On the days of public

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

audience, at which Jellal-ed-deen was expected to appear, the old sheikh
used the precaution of wearing a shirt of mail under his clothes, and of
increasing the number of his guards. His death, which occurred when his
son had attained his twenty-fifth year, is ascribed by several
historians, though apparently without any sufficient reason, to poison
administered to him by his successor.

The succession of Jellal-ed-deen was uncontested. He immediately set
about placing all things on the footing which they had been on previous
to the time of *On his Memory be Peace*. The mosks were repaired and
reopened; the call to prayer sounded as heretofore from the minarets;
and the solemn assemblies for worship and instruction were held once
more on every Friday. Imams, Koran-readers, preachers, and teachers of
all kinds, were invited to Alamoot, where they were honourably
entertained and richly rewarded. Jellal-ed-deen wrote to his lieutenants
in Kusistan and Syria, informing them of what he had done, and inviting
them to follow his example. He also wrote to the khalif, to the powerful
Shah of Khaurism, and to all the princes of Persia, to assure them of
the purity of his faith. His ambassadors were everywhere received with
honour, and the khalif and all the princes gave to Jellal-ed-deen, in
the letters which they wrote in reply, the title of prince, which had
never been conceded to any of his predecessors. The imams, and the men
learned in the law, loudly upheld the orthodoxy of the faith of the
mountain-chief, on whom they bestowed the name of Nev (*New*) Musulman.
When the people of Casveen, who had always been at enmity with the
Ismaïlites, doubted of his orthodoxy, Jellal-ed-deen condescended to ask
of them to send some persons of respectability to Alamoot, that he might
have an opportunity of convincing them,

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They came, and in
their presence he committed to the flames a pile of books which he said
were the writings of Hassan Sabah, and contained the secret rules and
ordinances of the society. He cursed the memory of Hassan and his
successors, and the envoys returned to Casveen, fully convinced of his
sincerity.

In the second year of his reign Jellal-ed-deen gave a further proof of
the purity of his religious faith by permitting, or, perhaps, directing,
his harem, that is, his mother, his wife, and a long train of their
female attendants, to undertake the pilgrimage to the holy city of
Mecca, to worship at the tomb of the Prophet. The sacred banner was,
according to custom, borne before the caravan of the pilgrims from
Alamoot, and the Tesbeel, or distribution of water to the pilgrims,
usual on such occasions <span id="fr_57"></span>[\*](#fn_57.md), was
performed by the harem of the mountain-prince on such a scale of
magnificence and liberality as far eclipsed that of the great Shah of
Khaurism, whose caravan reached Bagdad at the same time on its way to
Mecca. The khalif Nassir-ladin-Illah even gave precedence to the banner
of the pilgrims from Alamoot, and this mark of partiality drew on him
the wrath of the potent prince of Khaurism. Twice did the latter
afterwards collect an

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

army to make war on the successor of the Prophet. With the first,
consisting of nearly 300,000 men, he marched against Bagdad, and had
reached Hamadan and Holuan, when a violent snow-storm obliged him to
retire. He had collected his forces a second time, when the hordes of
Chinghis Khan burst into his dominions. His son and successor resumed
his plans, and reached Hamadan, when again a snow-storm came to avert
destruction. from the City of Peace. As the power of the Mongol
conqueror was now great and formidable, the prudent prince of Alamoot
sent in secret ambassadors to assure him of his submission, and to
tender his homage.

Jellal ed-deen took a more active part in the politics of his neighbours
than his predecessors had done. He formed an alliance with the Atabeg
Mozaffer-ed-deen (*Causing the Religion to be victorious*), the governor
of Azerbeijan, against the governor of Irak, who was their common enemy.
He even visited the Atabeg at his residence, where he was received with
the utmost magnificence, and each day the Atabeg sent 1,000 dinars for
the expenses of his table. The two princes sent to the khalif for aid;
their request was granted; and they marched against, defeated, and slew
the governor of Irak, and appointed another in his place. After an
absence of eighteen months Jellal-ed-deen returned to Alamoot, having in
the mean time, by his prudent conduct, greatly augmented the fame of his
orthodoxy. He now ventured to aspire to a connexion with one of the
ancient princely houses of the country, and asked in marriage the
daughter of Ky Kaoos, the prince of Ghilan. The latter having expressed
his readiness to give his consent, provided that of the khalif could be
obtained, envoys were despatched to Bagdad, who speedily returned with
the approbation of Nassir-ladin-Illah, and the princess of Ghilan was
sent to Alamoot.

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

The mention of Ghilan and of Ky Kaoos presents an opportunity, which we
are not willing to let pass, of diversifying our narrative by an
excursion into the regions of Persian geography and romance, which may
cast a gleam of the sunshine of poetry over the concluding portion of
our history of the dark and secret deeds of the Ismaïlites.

The mountain range named Demavend, on the south side of which Roodbar,
the territory of the Ismaïlites, lies, is the northern termination of
the province of Irak Ajemee, or Persian Irak. Beyond it stretches to the
Caspian Sea a fertile region, partly hilly, partly plain <span
id="fr_58"></span>[\*](#fn_58.md). This country is divided into five
districts, which were in those times distinct from and independent of
each other. At the foot of the mountains lay Taberistan and Dilem, the
former to the east, the latter to the west. Dilem is celebrated as
having been the native country of the family of Buyah, which, rising
from the humblest station, exercised under the khalifs, and with the
title of Ameer-al-Omra (*Prince of the Princes*), a power nearly regal
over Persia during a century and a half <span
id="fr_59"></span>[†](#fn_59.md). North of Dilem lay Ghilan, and north of
Taberistan Mazenderan, the ancient Hyrcania. In the midst of

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

these four provinces lay Ruyan and Rostemdar, remarkable for having been
governed for a space of 800 years by one family of princes, while
dynasty after dynasty rose and fell in the neighbouring states. In these
provinces the names of the royal lines [recall](errata.htm#8.md) to our
mind the ancient history, both true and fabulous, of Irân (Persia), as
we find it in the poem of Ferdoosee, the Homer of that country. The
family of Kawpara, which governed Ruyan and Rostemdar, affected to
derive their lineage from the celebrated blacksmith Gavah, who raised
his apron as the standard of revolt against the Assyrian tyrant Zohak;
and the family of Bavend, which ruled for nearly seven centuries, with
but two interruptions, over Mazenderan and Taberistan, were descended
from the elder brother of Noosheerwan the Just, the most celebrated
monarch of the house of Sassan.

This region is the classic land of Persia. When, as their romantic
history relates, Jemsheed, the third monarch of Iran after Cayamars, the
first who ruled over men, had long reigned in happiness and prosperity,
his head was lifted up with pride, and God withdrew from him his favour.
His dominions were invaded by Zohak, the prince of the Tauzees
(Assyrians or Arabs); his subjects fell away from him, and, after
lurking for a hundred years in secret places, he fell into the hands of
the victor, who cut him asunder with a saw. A child was born of the race
of Jemsheed, named Feridoon, whom, as soon as he came to the light (in
the village of Wereghi, in Taberistan), his mother Faranuk gave to a
herdsman to rear, and his nourishment was the milk of a female buffalo,
whose name was Poormayeh. Zohak meantime had a dream, in which he beheld
two warriors, who led up to him a third, armed with a club which
terminated in the head of a cow. The warrior struck him on the head with
his club, and took him and chained

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

him in the cavern of a mountain. He awoke with a loud cry, and called
all the priests, and astrologers, and wise men, to interpret his dream.
They feared to speak. At last they told him of the birth and nurture of
Feridoon, who was destined to overcome him. Zohak fell speechless from
his throne at the intelligence. On recovering, he sent persons in all
directions to search for and put to death the fatal child; but the
maternal anxiety of Faranuk was on the watch, and she removed the young
Feridoon to the celebrated mountain Elburz, where she committed him to
the care of a pious anchorite. Zohak, after a long search, discovered
the place where Feridoon had been first placed by his mother, and in his
rage he killed the beautiful and innocent cow Poormayeh.

Zohak is represented as a most execrable tyrant. Acting under the
counsel of the Devil, he had murdered his own father to get his throne.
His infernal adviser afterwards assumed the form of a young man, and
became his cook. He prepared for him all manner of curious and
high-seasoned dishes; for hitherto the food of mankind had been rude and
plain. As a reward, he only asked permission to kiss the shoulders of
the king. Zohak readily granted this apparently moderate request; but
from the spots where the Devil impressed his lips grew forth two black
snakes. In vain every art was employed to remove them, in vain they were
cut away, they grew again like plants. The physicians were in
perplexity. At length the Devil himself came in the shape of a
physician, and said that the only mode of keeping them quiet was to feed
them with human brains. His object, we are told, was gradually in this
way to destroy the whole race of man.

The design of the Devil seemed likely to be accomplished. Each day two
human beings were slain, and the serpents fed with their brains. At
length

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

two of the tyrant's cooks discovered that the brain of a man mixed with
that of a ram satisfied the monsters, and, of the two men who were given
to be killed each day, they always secretly let go one, and those who
were thus delivered became the progenitors of the Koords who dwell in
the mountains west of Persia. Among those unfortunate persons who were
condemned to be food for the serpents was the son of a blacksmith named
Gavah. The afflicted father went boldly before the tyrant, and
remonstrated with him on the injustice of his conduct. Zohak heard him
with patience and released his son. He also made him bearer of a letter
addressed to all the provinces of the empire, vaunting his goodness, and
calling on all to support him against the youthful pretender to his
throne. But Gavah, instead of executing the mandate, tore the tyrant's
letter, and, raising his leathern apron on a lance by way of standard,
called on all the inhabitants of Iran to arise and take arms in support
of Feridoon, the rightful heir to the throne of Jemsheed.

Meantime Feridoon, who had attained the age of twice eight years, came
down from Elburz, and, going to his mother, besought her to tell him
from whom he derived his birth. Faranuk related to him his whole
history, when the young hero, in great emotion, vowed to attack the
tyrant, and avenge on him the death of his father; but his mother
sought, by representing the great power of Zohak; to divert him from his
purpose, and exhorted him to abandon all such thoughts, and to enjoy in
quiet the good things of this life. But a numerous army, led by Gavah in
search of the true heir to the throne, now came in sight. Feridoon,
joyfully advancing to meet them, adorned with gold and precious stones
the leathern banner, placed upon it the orb of the moon, and, naming it
Direfsh-e-Gavanee (*Gavah's Apron*),

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

selected it for the banner of the empire of Iran. Each succeeding
prince, we are told, at his accession, added jewels to it, and
Direfsh-e-Gavanee blazed in the front of battle like a sun. Feridoon,
then calling for smiths, drew for them in the sand the form of a club,
with a cow's head at the end of it,

</span>

 

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

and when they had made it he named it Gawpeigor (*Cow-face*), in honour
of his nurse. Taking leave of his mother, he marches against the tyrant;
an angel comes from heaven to aid the rightful cause; Zohak is deserted
by his troops; he falls into the hands of Feridoon, who, by the
direction of the angel, imprisons him in a cavern of the mountain
Demavend. Feridoon, on ascending the throne of his forefathers, governed
with such mildness, firmness, and justice, that his name is to the
present day in Persia significative of the ideal of a perfect
monarch <span id="fr_60"></span>[\*](#fn_60.md).

Mazenderan is not less celebrated in Persian romance than the region at
the foot of Demavend. It was the scene of the dangers of the
light-minded Kej Kaoos (supposed to be the Cyaxares of the Greeks), and
of the marvellous adventures called the Seven Fables or Stages of the
Hero Roostem, the Hercules of Persia, who came to his aid. When Kej
Kaoos mounted the throne of Irân, he exulted in his wealth and in his
power. A deev (*Demon*), desirous of luring him to his destruction,
assumed the guise of a wandering minstrel, and, coming to his court,
sought to be permitted to sing before the padisha (*Emperor*). His
request was acceded to,--his theme was the praises of Mazenderan, and he
sang to this effect:--

"Mazenderan deserves that the shah should think on it; the rose blooms
evermore in its gardens, its hills are arrayed with tulips and
jessamines, mild is the air, the earth is bright of hue, neither cold
nor heat oppresses the lovely land, spring abides there

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

evermore, the nightingale sings without ceasing in the gardens, and the
deer bound joyously through the woods. The earth is never weary of
pouring forth fruits, the air is evermore filled with fragrance, like
unto rose-water are the streams, the tulip glows unceasingly on the
meads, pure are the rivers, and their banks are smiling: ever mayest
thou behold the falcon at the chase. All its districts are adorned with
abundance of food, beyond measure are the treasures which are there
piled up, the flowers bend in worship before the throne, and around it
stand the men of renown richly girded with gold. Who dwelleth not there
knoweth no pleasure, as joy and luxuriant pastime are to him unknown."

Kej Kaoos was beguiled by the tempter, and, eager to get possession of
so rich a land, he led a large army into it. The Shah of Mazenderan was
aided by a potent demon or enchanter named the Deev Seffeed (*White
Deev*), who, by his magic arts, cast a profound darkness over the
Irânian monarch and his host, in which they would have all been
destroyed but for the timely arrival of Roostem, who, after surmounting
all the impediments that magic could throw in his way, slew the Deev
Seffeed, and delivered his sovereign.

Kej Kaoos, we are afterwards told by the poet, formed the insane project
of ascending to heaven, which he attempted in the following manner. A
stage was constructed on which a throne was set for the monarch; four
javelins were placed at the corners, with pieces of goat's flesh on
them, and four hungry eagles were tied at the bottom, who, by their of
arts to reach the meat, raised the stage aloft into the air; but when
the strength of the birds was exhausted the whole fell with the royal
aëronaut in the desert, where he was found by Roostem and the other
chiefs.

The history of the Shah-nameh (*King-book*), in which these legends are
contained, is one of the most curious in literature. The fanaticism of
the Arabs, who conquered Persia, raged with indiscriminate fury
[against](errata.htm#9.md) the literature, as well as the religion, of that
[country](errata.htm#10.md); and when, in the time of Al-Mansoor and

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

his successors Haroon-er-Rasheed and Al-Mamoon, the Arabs themselves
began to devote their attention to literature and science, it was the
science of Greece and the poetry of their native language that they
cultivated. The Persian literature meantime languished in obscurity, and
the traditional, heroic, and legendary tales of the nation were fading
fast from memory, when a governor of a province, zealous, as it would
appear, for the honour of the Persian nation, made a collection of them,
and formed from them a continuous narrative in prose. The book thus
formed was called the Bostan-nameh (*Garden-book*). It was in great
repute in the northern part of Persia, where, at a distance from the
court of the khalifs, the Persian manners, language, and nationality
were better preserved; and when the Turkish family of the Samenee
founded an empire in that part of Persia, sultan Mansoor I., of that
race, gave orders to a poet named Dakeekee to turn the Bastan-nameh into
Persian verse. The poet undertook the task, but he had not made more
than a thousand verses when he perished by assassination. There being no
one supposed capable of continuing his work, it was suspended till
twenty years afterwards, when the celebrated Mahmood of Ghizni, the
conqueror of India, meeting with the Bastan-nameh, gave portions of it
to three of the most renowned poets of the time to versify. The palm of
excellence was adjudged to Anseri, who versified the tale of Sohrab
slain by his own father Roostem, one of the most pathetic and affecting
narratives in any language. The sultan made him Prince of the Poets, and
directed him to versify the entire work; but, diffident of his powers,
Anseri shrank from the task, and having some time afterwards met a poet
of Toos in Khorasan, named Isaac, the son of Sheriff-Shah, surnamed
Ferdoosee

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (*Paradisal* <span
id="fr_61"></span>[\*](#fn_61).md), either from his father's employment as
a gardener, or from the beauty of his verses, he introduced him to the
sultan, who gladly committed the task to him. Ferdoosee laboured with
enthusiasm in the celebration of the ancient glories of his country; and
in the space of thirty or, as some assert, of only eight years, he
brought the poem to within two thousand lines of its termination, which
lines were added by another poet after his death.

The Shah-nameh is, beyond comparison, the finest poem of the Mohammedan
east. It consists of 60,000 rhymed couplets, and embraces the history of
Persia, from the beginning of the world to the period of its conquest by
the Arabs. The verses move on with spirit and rapidity, resembling more
the flow of our lyrical, than that of our common heroic, lines <span
id="fr_62"></span>[†](#fn_62.md).

Ferdoosee wrote his poem in the early part of the eleventh century from
a book which had been in existence a long time before, for he always
calls it an *old book*. No proof therefore is needed that he did not
invent the tales which compose the Shah-nameh, and they have every
appearance of having been the ancient traditionary legends of the
Persian nation. But we are able to show that these legends were popular
in Persia nearly six centuries before his time; and it was chiefly with
a view to establishing this

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

curious point that we related the tale of Zohak and Feridoon.

Moses of Choren, the Armenian historian, who wrote about the year 440,
thus addresses the person to whom his work is dedicated. "How should the
vain and empty fables about Byrasp Astyages gain any portion of thy
favour, or why shouldest thou impose on us the fatigue of elucidating
the absurd, tasteless, senseless legends of the Persians about him? to
wit, of his first injurious benefit of the demoniac powers which were
subject to him, and how he could not deceive him who was deception aryl
falsehood itself. Then, of the kiss on the shoulders, whence the dragons
came, and how thenceforward the growth of vice destroyed mankind by the
pampering of the belly, until at last a certain Rhodones bound him with
chains of brass, and brought him to the mountain which is called
Demavend; how Byraspes then dragged to a hill Rhodones, when he fell
asleep on the way, but this last, awaking out of his sleep, brought him
to a cavern of the mountain, where he chained him fast, and set an image
opposite to him, so that, terrified by it, and held by the chains, he
might never more escape to destroy the world."

Here we have evidently the whole story of Zohak and Feridoon current in
Persia in the fifth century; and any one who has reflected on the nature
of tradition must be well aware that it must have existed there for
centuries before. The very names are nearly the same. Taking the first
syllable from Feridoon, it becomes nearly Rodon, and Biyraspi Aidahaki
(the words of the Armenian text) signify the dragon Byrasp: Zohak is
evidently nearly the same with the last word. This fable could hardly
have been invented in the time of the Sassanian dynasty, who had not
then been more than two centuries on the throne, much less during the
period of

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

the dominion of the Parthian Arsacides, who were adverse to everything
Persian. We are therefore carried back to the times of the Kejanians,
the Achæmenides of the Greeks; and it is by no means impossible that the
tale of Zohak and Feridoon was known even to the host which Xerxes led
to the subjugation of Greece.

It is well known to those versed in oriental history that, when the
founder of the house of Sassan mounted the throne of Persia in the year
226, he determined to bring back everything, as far as was possible, to
its state in the time of the Kejanians, from whom he affected to be
descended, and that his successors trod in his footsteps. But, as Persia
had been for five centuries and a half under the dominion of the Greeks
and Parthians, there was probably no authentic record of the ancient
state of things remaining. Recourse was therefore had to the traditional
tales of the country; and, as the legend of Zohak and Feridoon was, as
we have seen, one of the most remarkable of these tales, it was at once
adopted as a genuine portion of the national history, and a banner
formed to represent the Apron of Gavah, which was, as the poet describes
it, adorned with additional jewels by each monarch of the house of
Sassan at his accession. This hypothesis will very simply explain the
circumstance of this banner being unnoticed by the Greek writers, while
it is an undoubted fact that it was captured by the Arabs at the battle
of Kadiseäh, which broke the power of Persia,--a circumstance which has
perplexed Sir John Malcolm.

We will finally observe that the historian just alluded to, as well as
some others, thinks that the darkness cast by the magic art of the White
Deev over Ky Kaoos and his army in Mazanderan coincides with the eclipse
of the sun predicted by Thales,

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

and which, according to Herodotus, parted the armies of the Medians and
the Lydians when engaged in conflict. Little stress is however, we
apprehend, to be laid on such coincidences. Tradition does not usually
retain the memory of facts of this nature, though fiction is apt enough
to invent them. The only circumstances which we have observed in the
early part of the Shah-nameh agreeing with Grecian history, are some
relating to the youthful days of Kei Khoosroo, which are very like what
Herodotus relates of Cyrus.

We now return to the history of the Assassins

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_57"></span>[133:\*](sma12.htm#fr_57.md) "Sebil, in Arabic 'the
way,' means generally the road, and the traveller is hence called
*Ibn-es-sebil*, the son of the road; but it more particularly signifies
the way of piety and good works, which leads to Paradise. Whatever
meritorious work the Moslem undertakes, he does *Fi sebil Allah*, on the
way of God, or for the love of God; and the most meritorious which he
can undertake is the holy war, or the fight for his faith and his
country, on *God's way*. But since pious women can have no immediate
share in the contest, every thing which they can contribute to the
nursing of the wounded, and the refreshment of the exhausted, is imputed
to them as equally meritorious as if they had fought themselves. The
distribution of water to the exhausted and wounded warriors is the
highest female merit in the holy war on God's way."--*Hammer's History
of the Assassins*, Wood's translation, p. 144.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[135:\*](sma12.htm#fr_58.md) This part of Persia
also acquires interest from the circumstance of Russia being believed to
be looking forward to obtaining it, one day or other, by conquest or
cession.

<span id="fn_59"></span>[135:†](sma12.htm#fr_59.md) Azed-ud-dowlah, one of
the most celebrated of these princes, had a dyke constructed across the
river Kur, in the plain of Murdasht, near the ruins of Persepolis, to
confine the water, and permit of its being distributed over the country.
It was called the Bund-Ameer (*Prince's Dyke*), and travellers ignorant
of the Persian language have given this name to the river itself. We
must not, therefore, be surprised to find in "Lalla Rookh" a lady
singing,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"There's a bower of roses by Bendameer's stream*;*"

</div>

and asking,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Do the roses still bloom by the *calm* Bendameer?"

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Calm and still,
beyond doubt, is the Bendameer.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[140:\*](sma12.htm#fr_60.md) Four lines, quoted by
Sir J. Malcolm from the Gulistan of Saadi, may be thus *literally*
rendered in the measure of the original:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">The blest Feridoon an angel was not;  
Of musk or of amber he formed was not;  
By justice and mercy good ends gained he;  
Be just and merciful, thou ’lt a Feridoon be.</span>

</div>

<span id="fn_61"></span>[144:\*](sma12.htm#fr_61.md) Paradise, we are to
recollect, is a word of Persian origin, adopted by the Greeks, from whom
we have received it. A Paradise was a place planted with trees, a park,
garden, or pleasure-ground, as we may term it.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[144:†](sma12.htm#fr_62.md) Hammer has, in his
"Belles Lettres of Persia" (*Schöne* *Redekunst Persians*), and in the
"Mines de l’Orient," translated a considerable portion of the Shah-nameh
in the measure of the original. MM. Campion and Atkinson have rendered a
part of it into English heroic verse. Görres has epitomised it, as far
as to the death of Roostem, in German prose, under the title of "Das
Heldenbnch von Iran." An epitome of the poem in English prose, by Mr.
Atkinson, has also lately appeared.
