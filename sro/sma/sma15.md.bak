AMONG the many extraordinary phenomena which the middle ages present,
none is more deserving of attention, or more characteristic of the times
and the state of society and opinion, than the institution of the
religio-military orders of the Hospitaliers, the Templars, and the
Teutonic Knights. Of these orders, all of which owed their origin to the
Crusades, and commenced in the 12th century, the last, after the final
loss of the Holy Land, transferring the scene of their activity to the
north of Germany, and directing their arms against the heathens who
still occupied the south coast of the Baltic, became the founders, in a
great measure, of the Prussian power; while the first, planting their
standard on the Isle of Rhodes, long gallantly withstood the forces of
the Ottoman Turks, and, when at length obliged to resign that island,
took their station on the rock of Malta, where they bravely repelled the
troops of the greatest of the Ottoman sultans, and maintained at least a
nominal independence till the close of the 18th century.

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A less glorious
fate attended the Knights of the Temple. They became the victims of the
unprincipled rapacity of a merciless prince; their property was seized
and confiscated; their noblest members perished in the flames; their
memory was traduced and maligned; the foulest crimes were laid to their
charge; and a secret doctrine, subversive of social tranquillity and
national independence, was asserted to have animated their councils.
Though many able defenders of these injured knights have arisen, the
charges against them have been reiterated even in the present day; and a
distinguished Orientalist (Von Hammer) has recently even attempted to
bring forward additional and novel proofs of their secret guilt. <span
id="fr_66"></span>[\*](#fn_66.md) To add one more to the number of their
defenders, to trace the origin, develope the internal constitution of
their society, narrate their actions, examine the history of their
condemnation and suppression, and show how absurd and frivolous were the
charges against them, are the objects of the present writer, who, though
he is persuaded, and hopes to prove, that they held no secret doctrine,
yet places them among the secret societies of the middle ages, because
it is by many confidently maintained that they were such.

As the society of the Templars was indebted for its origin to the
Crusades, we will, before entering on our narrative, endeavour to
correct some erroneous notions respecting the causes and nature of these
celebrated expeditions.

The opinion of the Crusades having been an emanation

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

of the spirit of chivalry is one of the most erroneous that can be
conceived, yet it is one most widely spread. Romancers, and those who
write history as if it were romance, exert all their power to keep up
the illusion, and the very sound of the word Crusade conjures up in most
minds the ideas of waving plumes, gaudy surcoats, emblazoned shields,
with lady's love, knightly honour, and courteous feats of arms. A vast
deal of this perversion of truth is no doubt to be ascribed to the
illustrious writer of the splendid epic whose subject is the first
Crusade. Tasso, who, living at the time when the last faint gleam of
expiring chivalry was fitfully glowing through the moral and political
gloom which was overspreading the former abodes of freedom and industry
in Italy, may be excused if, young and unversed in the philosophy of
history, he mistook the character of European society six centuries
before his time, or deemed himself at liberty to minister to the taste
of a court which loved the fancied image of former times, and stimulate
it to a generous emulation by representing the heroes of the first
Crusade as animated with the spirit and the virtues of the ideal
chivalry. But the same excuse is not to be made for those who, writing
at the present day, confound chivalry and the Crusades, give an epitome
of the history of the latter under the title of that of the former, and
venture to assert that the valiant Tancred was the *beau ideal* of
chivalry, and that the "Talisman" contains a faithful picture of the
spirit and character of the Crusades. <span
id="fr_67"></span>[\*](#fn_67.md)

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

We venture to assert that the Crusades did *not* originate in chivalry,
and that the first Crusade, the most important of them, and that which
gave the tone and character to all the succeeding ones, does not present
a single vestige of what is usually understood by the term chivalry, not
a trace of what the imagination rather than the knowledge of Burke
described as embodying "the generous loyalty to rank and sex, the proud
submission, the dignified obedience, and that subordination of the heart
which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted
freedom--that sensibility of principle, that chastity of honour, which
felt a stain like a wound, which inspired courage whilst it mitigated
ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice
itself lost half its evil by losing all its grossness." Little surely
does he know of the 11th century and its spirit who can suppose any part
of the foregoing description to apply to those who marched in arms to
Asia to free the sepulchre of Christ; slightly must he have perused the
*Gesta Tancredi* of Radulphus Cadomens, who can conceive that gallant
warrior, as he undoubtedly was, to have been the mirror of chivalry.

Chivalry and the Crusades commenced in the same century, and drew their
origin from the same source. One was not the cause of the other, but
both were effects of the same cause, and that cause was *feudalism*.
This inculcated "the proud submission, the dignified obedience," &c.,
&c., which were gradually idealised into chivalry; it impressed on the
mind of the vassal those principles of [regrard](errata.htm#11.md) to the
rights and property of his lord which seemed to justify and sanction the
Holy War. Previously, however, to explaining the manner in which this
motive acted, we must stop to notice another concurring cause of the
Crusades, without

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

which it would perhaps never have begun to operate.

Man has at all periods been led by a strong impulse of his nature to
visit those spots which have been distinguished as the scenes of great
and celebrated actions, or the abode of distinguished personages. The
operation of this natural feeling is still stronger when it is combined
with religion, and there arises a conviction that the object of his
worship is gratified by this act of attention, and his favour thereby
secured to the votary. Hence we find *pilgrimage*, or the practice of
taking distant journeys to celebrated temples, and other places of
devotion, to have prevailed in all ages of the world. In the most remote
periods of the mythic history of Greece, where historic truth is not to
be sought, and only manners and modes of thinking are to be discerned,
we constantly meet the *theoria*, or pilgrimage to Delphi, mentioned in
the history of the heroes, whence we may with certainty collect that it
formed at all times a portion of the manners of the Greeks. India, at
the present day, witnesses annually the pilgrimage of myriads to the
temple of Juggernaut, and Jerusalem has been for thousands of years the
resort of pious Israelites.

The country which had witnessed the life and death of their Lord
naturally acquired importance in the eyes of the early Christians, many
of whom, moreover, were Jews by birth, and had always viewed Jerusalem
with feelings of veneration. All, too, confounded--as has unfortunately
been too much the case in later times--the old and the new law, and saw
not that the former was but "beggarly elements" in comparison with the
latter, and deemed that the political and economical precepts designed
for a single nation, inhabiting one small region, were obligatory on the
church of Christ, which was intended.. to comprise the whole human race.
Many of the practices

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

of Judaism were therefore observed by the Christians, and to this
principle we are perhaps in a great measure to ascribe the rapid
progress of the practice, and the belief in the efficacy, of pilgrimage
to the Holy City.

The abuses of pilgrimage were early discerned, and some of the more
pious Fathers of the Church preached and wrote against the practice. But
piety and eloquence were vain, and could little avail to stem the
torrent when men believed that the waters of Jordan had efficacy to wash
every sin, though unattended by sincere repentance. The Church, as she
advanced in corruption, improved in worldly wisdom, and, taking
pilgrimage under her protection, made it a part of her penal discipline.
The sinner was now ordered a journey to the Holy Land as a means of
freeing his soul from the guilt of his perhaps manifold enormities. Each
year saw the number of the pilgrims augment, while the growing
veneration for relics, of which those which came from the Holy Land were
esteemed the most efficacious, stimulated pilgrimage by adding the
incentive of profit, as a small stock of money laid out in the purchase
of the generally counterfeit relics always on sale at Jerusalem would
produce perhaps a thousand per cent. on the return of the pilgrim to his
native country. A pilgrim was also held in respect and veneration
wherever he came, as an especial favourite of the Divinity, having been
admitted by him to the high privilege of visiting the sacred places, a
portion of whose sanctity it would be supposed might still adhere to
him.

The 11th century was the great season of pilgrimage. A strange
misconception of the meaning of a portion of Scripture had led men to
fancy that the year 1000 was to be that of the advent of Christ, to
judge the world. As the valley of Jehoshaphat was

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

believed to be the spot on which this, awful event would take place, the
same feeling which leads people at the present day to lay a flattering
unction to their souls by supposing that death-bed repentance will prove
equivalent in the sight of God to a life passed in obedience to his will
and in the exercise of virtue, impelled numbers to journey to the Holy
Land, in the belief that this officiousness, as it were, of hitherto
negligent servants would be well taken by their Lord, and procure them
an indulgent hearing before his judgment-seat. Pilgrimage, therefore,
increased greatly; the failure of their expectations, the appointed time
having passed away without the Son of Man coming in the clouds of
Heaven, gave it no check, but, on the contrary, rather an additional
impulse; and during this century the caravans of pilgrims attained to
such magnitude and strength as to be deserving of the appellation of
*The armies of the Lord*--precursive of the first and greatest Crusade.

In truth the belief in the merit and even the obligation of a pilgrimage
to Jerusalem, in the sight of God, was now as firmly impressed on the
mind of every Christian, be his rank what it might, as that of the
necessity and advantage of one to the Kaaba of Mecca is in the
apprehension of the followers of Mohammed; and in the degraded state of
the human intellect at that period a pilgrimage was deemed adequate to
the removal of all sin. As a proof of this we shall narrate the
pilgrimages of two distinguished personages of those times. The first
occurred in the 9th, the second in the 11th century.

In the reign of Lothaire, son of Louis the [Debonaire](errata.htm#12.md), a
nobleman of Brittany, named Frotmond, who had murdered his uncle and his
youngest brother, began to feel remorse for his crimes. Arrayed in the
habit of a penitent, he presented himself before the monarch and an
assembly of his prelates, and made confession

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

of his guilty deeds. The king and bishops had him straitly bound in
chains of iron, and then commanded him, in expiation of his guilt, to
set forth for the East, and visit all the holy places, clad in
hair-cloth, and his forehead marked with ashes. Accompanied by his
servants and the partners of his crime, the Breton lord directed his
course to Palestine, which he reached in safety. Having, in obedience to
the mandates of his sovereign and of the church, visited all the holy
places, he crossed the Arabian desert, which had been the scene of the
wanderings of Israel, and entered Egypt. He thence traversed a part of
Africa, and went as far as Carthage, whence he sailed for Rome. Here the
Pope, on being consulted, advised him to make a second pilgrimage, in
order to complete his penance, and obtain the perfect remission of his
sins. Frotmond accordingly set forth once more, and having performed the
requisite duties at the Holy City, proceeded to the shore of the Red
Sea, and there took up his abode for three years on Mount Sinai, after
which time he made a journey to Armenia, and visited the mountain on
which the ark of Noah had rested. His crimes being now, according to the
ideas of those times, expiated, he returned to his native country, where
he was received as a saint, and taking up his abode in the convent of
Redon, passed there the remainder of his days, and died deeply regretted
by his brethren. <span id="fr_68"></span>[\*](#fn_68.md)

Fulk de Nerra, Count of Anjou, had spilt much innocent blood; he had had
his first wife burnt alive, and forced his second wife to seek refuge
from his barbarity in the Holy Land. The public odium pursued him, and
conscience asserting her rights presented to his disturbed imagination
the forms of those who had perished by him issuing from their tombs, and
reproaching him with his crimes. Anxious to

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

escape from his invisible tormentors, the count put on him the habit of
a pilgrim, and set forth for Palestine. The tempests which he
encountered in the Syrian seas seemed to his guilty soul the instruments
of divine vengeance, and augmented the fervour of his repentance. Having
reached Jerusalem in safety, he set heartily about the work of penance.
He traversed the streets of the Holy City with a cord about his neck,
and beaten with rods by his servants, while he repeated these words,
*Lord, have mercy on a faithless and perjured Christian, on a sinner
wandering far from his home*. During his abode in Jerusalem he gave
abundant alms, relieving the wants of the pilgrims, and leaving numerous
monuments of his piety and munificence.

Deep as was the penitence of the Count of Anjou, it did not stand in the
way of the exercise of a little pious fraud. By an ingenious device he
deceived the impious malignity of the profane Saracens, who would have
made him defile the holy sepulchre; and the chroniclers tell us that as
he lay prostrate before the sacred tomb he contrived to detach from it a
precious stone, which he carried back with him to the West. On his
return to his duchy he built, at the castle of Loches, a church after
the model of that of the Resurrection at Jerusalem, and here he every
day implored with tears the divine forgiveness. His mind, however, could
not yet rest; he was still haunted by the same horrid images; and he
once more visited the Holy Land, and edified the faithful by the
austerity of his penance. Returning home by the way of Italy, he
delivered the supreme pontiff from a formidable enemy who was ravaging
his territory, and the grateful pope conferred on him in return the full
absolution of all his sins. Fulk brought with him to Anjou a great
quantity of relics, with which he adorned the churches of Loches and
Angers; and his

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

chief occupation thenceforward was the building of towns and
monasteries, whence he acquired the name of *The Great Builder*. His
people, who blessed heaven for his conversion, honoured and loved him;
the guilt of his sins had been removed by the means which were then
deemed of sovereign efficacy; yet still the monitor placed by God in the
human breast, and which in a noble mind no power can reduce to perfect
silence, did not rest; and the Holy Land beheld, for the third time, the
Count of Anjou watering the sepulchre of Christ with his tears, and
groaning afresh over his transgressions. H e quitted Jerusalem for the
last time, recommending his soul to the prayers of the pious brethren
whose office it was to receive the pilgrims, and turned his face
homewards. But Anjou he was never more to behold; death surprised him at
Metz. His body was transferred to Loches, and buried in his church of
the Holy Sepulchre.

These instances may suffice to show what the opinion of the efficacy and
merit of pilgrimage to the Holy Land was at the time of which we write.
We here find convincing proof that in the minds of princes and prelates,
the highest and most enlightened order of society, it was confidently
believed to avail to remove the guilt of crimes of the deepest die. And
let not any one say that the clergy took advantage of the ignorance of
the people, and made it the instrument of extending their own power and
influence; for such an assertion would evince ignorance both of human
nature in general and of the temper and conduct of the Romish hierarchy
at that, and we might almost say at all periods of its existence.
However profligate the lives of many of the clergy may have been, they
never called in question the truth of the dogmas of their religion. Even
the great and daring Gregory VII., in the midst of what appear to us his
arrogant and almost impious assumptions, never for

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

moment doubted of the course which he was pursuing being the right one,
and agreeable to heaven. The clergy, as well as the laity, were firmly
persuaded of the efficacy of pilgrimage, and in both the persuasion was
naturally stronger in proportion to the ignorance of the believer. We
accordingly find that vast numbers of all ranks, and both sexes, clergy
as well as laity, annually repaired to the tomb of Christ.

It remains to be explained what the principle was which gave origin to
the idea of the right and justice of recovering the Holy Land, which was
now in. the hands of the fanatic Turks, instead of those of the tolerant
Saracens. This cause was, as we have above asserted, the feudal spirit,
that is, the spirit of the age, and not that emanation of it termed
chivalry.

Religion, whatever its original nature and character, will always take a
tinge from the manners and temper of those who adopt it. Nothing can be
more illustrative of the truth of this observation than the history of
the Christian religion. Any one who opens the Gospel, and reads it
without preconception or prejudice, cannot fail at once to recognise the
rational and fervent piety, the active benevolence, the pure morality,
the noble freedom from the trammels of the world, joined with the
zealous discharge of all the social duties, which every page of it
inculcates. Yet we find this religion in the East degenerating into
abject grovelling superstition and metaphysical quibbling, pursued with
all the rancour of the *odium theologicum*, while in the West it assumed
a fiery fanatic character, and deemed the sword an instrument of
conversion superior to reason and argument. This difference, apparently
so strange, arose from the difference of the social state and political
institutions of the people of the East and of the West at the time when
they embraced Christianity.

The free spirit had long since fled from Greece

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

when the first Christian missionaries preached the faith among its
people. But the temper of the Greek was still lively, and his reasoning
powers acute. Moreover, he had still the same leaning towards a sensible
and material religion which has at all times distinguished him, and the
increasing despotism of the empire depressed and enfeebled more and more
every day the martial spirit which he had displayed in the days of his
freedom. No field remained for his mental activity but that of
philosophy and religion. The former, which had long been his delight, he
had contrived to subtilize into an almost unintelligible mysticism; and
in this form it speedily„ spread its infection through his new faith,
which was besides further metamorphosed and changed in character by an
infusion from the dualistic system of Persia. Meantime the ascetic
spirit which had come from the East joined with the timidity engendered
by the pressure of despotism to make him mistake the spirit of the
Gospel, and convert Christianity into a crouching cowardly superstition.
When the emperor Nicephorus Phocas sought to infuse a martial and
fanatic spirit into his subjects, and to rouse them to vigorous exertion
against the Saracens, his bishops replied to his exhortations by citing
a canon of St. Basil, which directed that he who had slain an enemy in
battle should abstain during three years from participation in the holy
sacraments. The priest of a little town in Cilicia was engaged one day
in saying mass when a band of Saracens burst in, and began to plunder
the town. Without waiting to take off his sacerdotal vestments, he
seized the hammer, which in the churches of the East frequently serves
the purpose of a bell, and, flying among the infidels, plied his weapon
to such effect that he forced them to a precipitate flight, and saved
the town. What was the reward of the gallant priest? He was censured by
his diocesan,

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

interdicted the exercise of his ghostly functions, and so ill-treated in
other respects, that he flung off his robes and joined the Saracens,
whose more martial and energetic creed accorded better with his manly
sentiments. When the pilgrims of the first Crusade began to arrive in
such terrific numbers at Constantinople, the Greek emperor and his
subjects could hardly persuade themselves of the possibility of religion
being the actuating cause of such a portentous movement--so little did
religion and deeds of arms accord in their minds!

But with the nations of the West the case was different. In these the
ruling portion, that which gave tone to the whole, were of the Gothic
and Germanic races, whose hardy bands had dashed to pieces the worn-out
fabric of the Western empire. Worshippers in their native forests of
Thor and Odin, and the other deities of Valhalla, who admitted none but
the valiant dead to share in the celestial pork and mead which each day
crowned the board in their lucid abode, their manners, their sentiments,
their whole being was martial, and they infused this spirit into the
religion which they adopted from their Roman subjects. In making this
change in its tone they derived aid from the Jewish portion of the
sacred volume, which has been in all ages abused, by men ignorant of its
character and original use, to purposes of fanaticism and persecution;
and the religion of Christian Europe, from the fifth century downwards,
became of a martial and conquering character. By the sword Charlemagne
converted the pagan Saxons; his successors employed the sword against
the heathen Vends; and by fire and sword Olof Triggva-son spread
Christianity throughout the North. In former times this mode of
conversion had been in a great degree foreign to the Western church; and
persuasion had

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

been chiefly employed in the dissemination of the faith among the
heathen nations.

The religion of the West we thus see was martial; but this spirit alone
would not have sufficed to produce the Crusade which was to interest and
appear as a duty to all orders of men. Here the feudal principle came
into operation, and gave the requisite impulse.

In the 11th century the feudal system was completely developed in France
and Germany, and the modes of thinking, speaking, and acting derived
from it pervaded all the relations of life. From the top to the bottom
of society the mutual obligations of lords and vassals were recognised
and acted upon, and each vassal deemed it a most sacred duty to defend
by arms the honour and property of his superior lord There was also a
kind of supreme temporal chief of the Christian world acknowledged in
the person of the Emperor of Germany, who was viewed as the successor of
Charlemagne, and the representative of the Roman emperors. The feudal
ideas extended even to the hierarchy, which now put forth such
exorbitant claims to supremacy over the temporal power. The head of the
church was an acknowledged vicegerent of Him who was styled in scripture
Lord of all the kingdoms of the earth. Jesus Christ was, therefore, the
apex of the pyramid of feudal society; he was the great suzerain and
lord paramount of all princes and peoples, and all were equally under
obligation to defend his rights and honour. Such were evidently the
sentiments of the age.

It is hardly necessary to remind the reader that the religion of the
period which we treat of was of a gross and material character, and that
the passions and infirmities of human nature were freely bestowed on the
glorified Son of God. He was deemed to take a peculiar interest in the
spot of land where he

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

had sojourned when on earth, and more especially in the tomb in which
his body had been deposited, and. with grief and indignation to see them
in the hands of those who contemptuously derided his divinity, and
treated with insult and cruelty those of his faithful vassals who
underwent the toils and dangers of a distant journey to offer their
homage at his tomb. Nothing could, therefore, be more grateful to his
feelings than to behold the sacred soil of Palestine free from heathen
pollution, and occupied and defended by his faithful vassals, and no
true son of the church could hesitate a moment to believe that it was
his bounden duty to arm himself in the cause of his lord, and help to
reinstate him in his heritage. Here, then, without having recourse to
the romantic principle of chivalry, we have an adequate solution of the
phenomenon of the first Crusade. Here we have a motive calculated to
operate on the minds of all orders, equally effectual with men of piety,
virtue, and wealth, like Godfrey of Bouillon and Stephen of Chartres,
who looked for no temporal advantages, as with the meanest and most
superstitious of the vassals and serfs who might be supposed to have
only sought a refuge from misery and oppression by assuming the cross.
We would not by any means be supposed to deny that many other causes and
motives were in operation at the same time; but this we deem the grand
one. This was the motive which gave dignity to and hallowed all others,
and which affected the mind of every Crusader, be his rank or station in
society what it might.

Pilgrimage then was esteemed a duty, and a powerful mean of removing
guilt and appeasing the wrath of the Almighty; the spirit of the age was
martial, and its religion, tinged by the ancient system of the North of
Europe, was of the same character; the feudal principle was in its
vigour, and extended even

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

to the relations of man with the deity; the rude and barbarous Turks had
usurped the heritage, the very crown-lands, as we may say, of Jesus
Christ, and insulted his servants, whose duty it plainly was to punish
them, and free the tomb of their lord;--the natural result of such a
state of circumstances aria opinion was the first Crusade.

Essay on the same subject, and Mills's and James's histories of
chivalry. We do not recollect that any of these writers has fairly
proved that the chivalry which they describe ever existed as an
institution, and we must demur to the principle which they all assume of
romances like Perceforest being good authority for the manners of the
age in which they were composed.
