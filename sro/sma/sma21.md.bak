Election--His Rights and Privileges--Restraints on him--The
Seneschal--The Marshal--The Treasurer--The Draper--The
Turcopilar--Great-Priors--Commanders--Visitors--Sub-Marsh

AN order consisting of so many members, and whose wealth and possessions
were of such extent, must necessarily have had numerous officers and
various ranks and dignities. The elucidation of this branch of their
constitution is now to engage our attention.

At the head of the order stood the Master, or, as he was sometimes
called, the Great-Master <span id="fr_85"></span>[\*](#fn_85.md) of the
Temple. This personage was always a knight, and had generally held one
of the higher dignities of the order. Though, like the Doge of Venice,
his power was greatly controlled by the chapter, he enjoyed very great
consideration, and was always regarded as the representative of the
order. In the councils, the Masters of the Temple and the Hospital took
precedence of all ambassadors, and sat next the prelates. All monarchs
conceded princely rank and place to the Master of the Temple.

A situation which offered so much state and consideration

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

must, of necessity, have been an object of ambition; but the scanty
records remaining of the society do not enable us to point out any
specific cases of intrigue employed for the attainment of it. That of
the last Master, hereafter to be mentioned, is somewhat problematic.

The election of a Master of the Temple was as follows:--

When the Master was dead, an event which always occurred in the East, as
he was bound to reside there, if it took place in the kingdom of
Jerusalem, and the marshal of the order was on the spot, he took upon
him the exercise of the vacant dignity till, with the aid of the chapter
and of all the bailiffs on this side of the sea (i.e. in the East), he
had appointed a great-prior to represent the Master. But this election
did not take place till after the funeral. Should the death of the
Master have occurred in the province of Tripolis, or that of Antioch,
the prior of the province took the direction of the order till the
great-prior was appointed.

Owing to the constant state of war which prevailed in the East, and to
other causes, a considerable space of time occasionally intervened
between the death of one Master and the appointment of his successor.
During the *interregnum* the society was directed by the great-prior who
bore the seal of the Master.

When the day appointed for the election was arrived, the great officers
of the order and all the bailiffs who were invited to be present
assembled in the place selected for holding the election--generally the
chapel of the order. The great-prior, taking several of the knights
aside, consulted with them; and they then made two or three or more of
the knights who were most highly-esteemed retire. The great-prior took
the voices of those present on the merits

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

of the absent knights; and he who had most in his favour was declared
the electing-prior. The knights were then called in, and the choice of
the assembly notified to them. A knight, possessing the same virtues of
piety, love of peace, and impartiality with himself, was then assigned
for an assistant to the electing-prior: and the whole assemblage
withdrew, leaving the two alone in the chapel, where they passed the
entire night in prayer.

Early next morning, after performing their usual devotions and hearing
the mass of the Holy Ghost, the chapter re-assembled. The great-prior
then exhorted the two electing brethren to perform their duty truly and
honestly. These, then retiring, chose two other brethren; these four
chose two more, and so on, till the number amounted to twelve, in honour
of the apostles. The twelve then chose a brother-chaplain to represent
the person of Jesus Christ, and maintain peace and concord. It was
necessary that these thirteen should be of different provinces--eight of
them knights, four serving-brethren, and one priest. The thirteen
electors then returned to the chapter, and the electing-prior besought
all present to pray for them, as a great task had been laid on them. All
then fell on their knees and prayed; and the great-prior solemnly
reminded the electors of their duty, and conjured them to perform it
truly and uprightly. Having again implored the prayers of the assembly,
the electing-prior and his companions retired to the place appointed for
their deliberations. If the electors, or the majority of them, declared
for any knight on this or the other side of the sea, he was appointed;
if they were divided into parties, the electing-prior came with one of
the knights, and, informing the assembly of the circumstance, asked
their prayers. All fell on their knees, and the two

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

electors returned to their companions; if they now agreed, the person
whom they chose was declared Master.

Should the object of their choice be, as was not unfrequently the case,
actually present in the chapter, the thirteen came in; and the
electing-prior speaking in their name, said, "Beloved sirs, give praise
and thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, and to our dear Lady, and to all
the saints, that we are agreed, and have, according to your command,
chosen, in the name of God, a Master of the Temple. Are ye content with
what we have done?" All then replied, "In the name of God!" "Do ye
promise to yield him obedience as long as he lives?" "Yea, with the help
of God!" The electing-prior then turned to the great-prior, and said,
"Prior, if God and we have chosen thee for the Master, wilt thou promise
to obey the chapter as long as thou live, and to maintain the good
morals and good usages of the order?" and he answered, "Yea, with the
aid of God!" The same question was then put to some of the most
distinguished knights; and if the person elected was present, the
electing-prior went up to him, and said, "In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, we have chosen you brother, N. N., for Master,
and do choose you!'' He then said, "Beloved sirs and brethren, give
thanks unto God: behold our Master." The chaplains then chanted aloud
the *Te Deum laudamus*, the brethren arose, and, with the utmost
reverence and joy, taking the new Master in their arms, carried him into
the chapel, and placed him before the altar, where he continued kneeling
while the brethren prayed, the chaplains repeating *Kyrie Eleïson*,
*Pater noster*, and other devotional forms.

The election of the Master of the Temple required

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

no papal confirmation: the choice of the chapter was conclusive. Two
knights were assigned to him as his companions.

The allowances and train of the Master were suitable to the rank which
he was to support in the world, and to the dignity of the order which he
represented. He was allowed four horses, and an esquire of noble birth.
He had a chaplain and two secretaries; one for managing his Latin
correspondence, whom he might, after a time, admit to become a knight of
the order; the other, who was called his Saracenic secretary, and who
was probably an eastern Christian, for carrying on his Arabic
correspondence with the Infidels. He had, moreover, a farrier, a cook,
and a Turcopole <span id="fr_86"></span>[\*](#fn_86.md), two footmen, and a
Turcoman <span id="fr_87"></span>[†](#fn_87.md), to serve as guide. On a
march, the Turcoman rode on a horse behind an esquire: during the time
of war he was led by a cord, to prevent his escape. On any ordinary
journey, the Master might take two beasts of burden with him; but in
war-time, or in case of his going beyond the Jordan, or the Dog's
Pass <span id="fr_88"></span>[‡](#fn_88.md), he might extend the number to
four, which the statutes thriftily direct to be put into the stable when
he arrives at the house where he is going to stop, and to be employed in
the service of the house. The Master was finally commander-in-chief

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

of the order in the field; and then, like the Spartan kings, he could
act in some degree unfettered by the chapter. When he died, he was
buried with great solemnity and pomp, by the light of torches and wax
tapers--an honour bestowed by the order on no other of its members. All
the knights were required to attend the funeral; and the prelates were
invited to give their presence at it. Each brother who was present was
to repeat 200 *Pater nosters* within seven days, for the repose of the
soul of the deceased; and 100 poor persons were fed at home in the
evening, with the same design.

On the other hand, the Master was bound to obey the chapter; and he
could do nothing without consulting some of the brethren. He could not
nominate to any of the higher dignities of the order; but he might, with
the advice and consent of some of the most reputable knights, appoint to
the inferior priories and preceptories. He could not sell, or in any
other way dispose of, any of the lands of the order, without the consent
of the chapter; neither could he make peace or truce without their
approbation. Their consent was also required to enable him to make any
alteration in the laws of the society, to receive any person into it, or
to send a brother beyond sea. He could take no money out of the treasury
without the consent of the prior of Jerusalem, who was the treasurer of
the society. In fact, the Master of the Temple was so curbed and
restrained in every way, and his office made so much an honorary one,
that his dignity may best he compared with that of a Spartan king or a
Venetian doge. It is rather curious that the Master of the Temple should
be thus limited in authority, when the abbot of the Benedictines, whose
rules the Templars in a great measure adopted, enjoyed monarchical
power.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

Next in rank to the Master stood the seneschal, who, as his name
denotes <span id="fr_89"></span>[\*](#fn_89.md), was the Master's
representative and lieutenant. He had a right to be present at all
chapters of the order; and to be acquainted with all transactions of
consequence. He was allowed the same number of horses as the Master;
but, instead of a mule, he was to have a palfrey: he had two esquires,
and was assigned a knight as his companion; a deacon acted as his
chaplain and Latin secretary; he had also a Saracenic secretary and a
Turcopole, with two footmen. Like the Master, he bore the seal of the
order.

The marshal, was the general of the order; he had charge of the banner,
and led the brethren to battle. All the arms, equipments, and stables of
the order were under his superintendence. It was he who nominated the
sub-marshal and the standard-bearer. Like all the other great officers,
he was appointed by the Master and the chapter. As we have seen, when
the Master died in the kingdom of Jerusalem, the marshal occupied his
place till a great-prior was chosen. The marshal was allowed four
horses, two esquires, a serving-brother, and a Turcopole.

The office of treasurer of the order was always united with the dignity
of preceptor of the kingdom of Jerusalem. This officer had the charge of
all the receipts and expenditure of the order, of which he was bound to
give an account, when required, to the Master and the chapter. The
wardrobe of the order was also under him; and the draper was assigned as
his companion, without whose knowledge he could not dispose of any of
the clothes. As the ships, though few in number, which the Templars
possessed, were under him, he may be regarded as,

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

also, in some sort, the admiral of the order; and on this account the
preceptor of Acre was subordinate to him. The treasurer had the same
allowance of horses, &c. as the seneschal.

The draper had charge of the clothing of the order: he was to see that
each brother was decently and properly dressed. His allowance was four
horses, two esquires, and a pack-servant.

The Turcopilar was the commander of the light horse. All the armed
serving-brethren and the Turcopoles were under his command. He was
himself subordinate to the marshal. When he was going into action, some
of the knights were sent with him. These were under his orders; but if
their number amounted to ten, and they had with them a banner and a
knight-preceptor, the Turcopilar became subordinate to this officer;
which proves that the office of Turcopilar was not one of the higher
dignitaries of the order. The Turcopilar was allowed four horses.

Besides these offices of the order in the East, there were the
great-priors, great-preceptors, or provincial-masters (for the terms are
synonimous) of the three provinces of Jerusalem, Tripolis, and Antioch;
and the preceptors, who were subordinate to them.

The great-prior of the kingdom of Jerusalem was also treasurer. His
office has been already noticed. The great-priors of Tripolis and
Antioch had the superintendence over the brethren and the possessions of
the order in these provinces. They had the same allowances of attendants
and horses as the seneschal. The prior of Antioch, when on a journey to
Armenia, which bordered on his province, and in which the order had
possessions, was allowed to take with him a chaplain and a portable
chapel, as the Armenians were monophysite heretics, with whom

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

the orthodox brethren of the Temple could not join in worship.

The prior of the town of Jerusalem had peculiar duties to perform. It
was his office, with ten knights who stood under his command, to escort
the pilgrims on their way to and from the Jordan--one of the principal
objects of the institution of the order. On this occasion he had with
him the banner of the order and a round tent, into which he might take
any persons whom he should find sick when he encamped; he was also to
take with him provisions, and beasts of burden on which to place such of
the pilgrims as might be fatigued on the return.

When the true cross was brought forth on any expedition, it was the duty
of the prior of Jerusalem to keep by it, with his ten knights, night and
day, and to guard it; he was to encamp close to it; and two brethren
were to watch it every night.

All the secular knights who associated themselves to the order in
Jerusalem were under his orders, and fought beneath his banner. All the
brethren of the order who were in Jerusalem were, in the absence of the
marshal, under his command. One half of the booty captured beyond the
Jordan fell to him, the other half to the prior of the kingdom.

As we have seen above, the West was, like the East, divided into
provinces of the order. Each of these provinces was presided over by a
lieutenant of the master, named the provincial-master, great-prior, or
great-preceptor, with his chapter and officers corresponding to those of
the kingdom of Jerusalem. He was appointed, as it would appear, by the
Master and chapter; and when entering on his office, he bound himself by
oath to defend the Catholic religion, not only with his lips, but with
arms and all his strength; to follow the rules drawn up by St. Bernard;
to obey the Master; to come over the sea to his

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

aid whenever it was necessary; to defend him against all unbelieving
kings and princes; not to fly before these unbelieving foes; not to
alienate the goods of the order; to be loyal to the prince of the
country; to be chaste; and to aid all spiritual persons, especially the
Cistercians, by words and by deeds.

Under the provincial-masters stood the priors, bailiffs, or masters, who
governed large districts of the provinces, and had under their
inspection several of the houses of the order and their preceptors. They
dwelt in large temple-houses, with a good number of knights; they had
the power of holding chapters, and of receiving members into the order.

The preceptors were subordinate to the priors; they presided over one or
more houses. They were generally knights, but they were sometimes
priests. They were of two kinds--house-preceptors and knight-preceptors;
the former, as their name denotes, merely presided over the houses, and
might be priests or serving-brethren; the latter, who were probably only
to be found in the East or in Spain, led each ten knights in the battle.

Another office to be found among the Templars was that of visitors.
These were knights, who, as the representatives of the Master, visited
the different provinces of the order, especially in the West, to reform
abuses, make new regulations, and terminate such disputes and law-suits
as were usually reserved for the decision of the Master and the chapter.
All the provincial officers, even the great-priors, were subject to the
visitors, as the representatives of the Master. The powers of the
visitors ceased as soon as the business ended for which they were sent,
or when they were recalled.

Besides the foregoing offices, which were almost exclusively confined to
the knights, there were some inferior ones appropriated to the
serving-brethren.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> These offices were
five in number--namely, those of sub-marshal, standard-bearer, farrier,
cook, and preceptor of the coast of Acre. Each of these was allowed two
horses.

The sub-marshal had the charge of all the inferior sort of accoutrements
(*le petit harnois*) of the order, in which the horse-furniture seems to
have been included. All the handicraftsmen of the order were under him,
and were obliged to account to him for their work. He supplied them with
the needful tools and materials; could send them where he pleased on the
service of the house; and on holidays give them permission to go from
one house to another to amuse themselves. The sub-marshal and the
standard-bearer were each the representative of the other in his
absence.

The standard-bearer had the command over all the esquires of the house;
that is, those who were engaged for a limited time in the service of the
order, whom he was bound to make acquainted with the rules to which they
were subject, and the punishments to which they were liable in case of
disobedience; he was also to pay them their wages. Whenever the esquires
took the horses out to graze, he was bound to precede them with a
standard of the order. He always presided at the table of the
serving-brethren and esquires. When the order was marching to battle, it
was his task to ride before the standard, which was borne after him by
an esquire, or carried on a wain <span id="fr_90"></span>[\*](#fn_90.md);
he was to lead whithersoever the marshal directed him. When the battle
commenced, those esquires who led the horses of the knights were to
combat behind their masters; the others were to take the mules on which
their masters rode, and remain with the standard-bearer, who was to

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

have a banner rolled about his lance, which, when he saw the marshal
engaged in action, he was to unfurl, and draw up the esquires in as
handsome order as possible behind the combatants, in order to support
them.

The serving-brethren were eligible to the office of house-preceptor; but
there was this distinction made between them and knights who held that
office, that, the serving-brethren being allowed but one horse, their
esquire was a serving-brother. As Acre was the sea-port at which all the
shipments of the order to and from Europe took place, the preceptory
there was necessarily an office which entailed a good deal of toil and
business on the person who held that situation, and required a knowledge
of commerce and of the affairs of the world. It was therefore not
considered suitable to a knight, and was always given to a
serving-brother. The serving-brethren were also set over the various
farms and estates of the order. These were named the
brother-stewards,--in Latin, *grangiarii* and *preceptores
grangiarum*,--and were probably selected from the craftsmen of the
order. They were allowed two horses and an esquire.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_85"></span>[253:\*](sma21.htm#fr_85.md) *Magister*, *Maistre*,
is the almost invariable expression in the historians, the statutes of
the order, and most documents. *Magnus Magister* was, however, early
employed. Terricus, the Master of the order, thus styles himself when
writing to Henry II. of England. The term Grand-Master is apt to convey
erroneous ideas of pomp and magnificence to the minds of many readers.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[257:\*](sma21.htm#fr_86.md) The Turcopoles were
the offspring of a Turkish father, by a Christian mother; or also those
who had been reared among the Turks, and had learned their mode of
fighting. The Christians employed them as light cavalry; and the
Templars had always a number of them in their pay.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[257:†](sma21.htm#fr_87.md) The Turcomans were, as
their name denotes, born Turks. The Christians used them as guides on
their expeditions.

on the way to Antioch.
