### SECRET SOCIETIES

###### OF

#### THE MIDDLE AGES.

### INTRODUCTION.

IF we had the means of investigating historically the origin of Secret
Societies, we should probably find that they began to be formed almost
as soon as any knowledge had been accumulated by particular individuals
beyond what constituted the common stock. The same thing has happened to
knowledge that has happened to all other human possessions,--its actual
holders have striven to keep it to themselves! It is true that in this
case the possessor of the advantage does not seem to have the same
reason for being averse to share it with others which naturally operates
in regard to many good things of a different kind; he does not, by
imparting it to those around him, diminish his own store. This is true,
in so far as regards the possession of knowledge considered in its
character of a real good; the owner of the treasure does not impoverish
himself by giving it away, as he would by giving away his money, but
remains as rich as ever, even after he has made ever so many others as
rich as himself. But still there is one thing that he loses, and a thing
upon which the human mind is apt to set a very high value; he loses the
distinction which he derived from his knowledge. This distinction really
serves, in many respects, the

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

same purpose that money itself does. Like money, it brings observation
and worship. Like money, it is the dearest of all things, power.
Knowledge, however held, is indeed essentially power; to *ken*, that is,
to know, is the same word and the same thing with to can, that is, to be
able. But there is an additional and a different species of power
conferred by knowledge when it exists as the distinction of a few
individuals in the midst of general ignorance. Here it is power not only
to do those things the methods of doing which it teaches; it is,
besides, the power of governing other men through your comparative
strength and their weakness.

So strong is the motive thus prompting the possessor of knowledge to the
exclusive retention of his acquisitions, that unless it had been met by
another motive appealing in like manner directly to our self-interest,
it appears probable that scarcely any general dissemination of knowledge
would ever have taken place. The powerful counteracting motive in
question is derived from the consideration that in most cases one of the
most effective ways which the possessor of knowledge can take of
exciting the admiration of others, is to communicate what he knows. The
light must give itself forth, and illuminate the world, even that it may
be itself seen and admired. In the very darkest times, the scholar or
philosopher may find his ambition sufficiently gratified by the mere
reputation of superior attainments, and the stupid wonder, or it may be
superstitious terror, of the uninquiring multitude. But as soon as any
thing like a spirit of intelligence or of curiosity has sprung up in the
general mind, all who aspire to fame or consideration from their
learning, their discoveries, or their intellectual powers, address
themselves to awaken the admiration of their fellow-men, not by
concealing, but by displaying their knowledge

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --not by scaling
up the precious fountain, but by allowing its waters to flow freely
forth, that all who choose may drink of them. From this time science
ceases almost to have any secrets; and, all the influences to which it
is exposed acting in the same direction, the tendency of knowledge
becomes wholly diffusive.

But in the preceding state of things the case was altogether the
reverse. Then there was little or no inducement to the communication of
knowledge, and every motive for those who were in possession of it to
keep it to themselves. There was not intelligence enough abroad to
appreciate, or even to understand, the truths of philosophy if they had
been announced in their simplicity, and explained according to their
principles; all that was cared for, all that was capable of arousing the
vulgar attention, was some display, made as surprising and mysterious as
possible, of their practical application. It would even have been
attended with danger in many cases to attempt to teach true philosophy
openly, or to make open profession of it; it was too much in opposition
to some of the strongest prejudices which everywhere held sway. It is
not, then, to be wondered at, that its cultivators should have sought to
guard and preserve it by means of secret associations, which, besides
excluding the multitude from a participation in the thing thus fenced
round and hidden, answered also divers other convenient purposes. They
afforded opportunities of free conference, which could not otherwise
have been obtained. There was much in the very forms of mystery and
concealment thus adopted calculated to impress the popular imagination,
and to excite its reverence and awe. Finally, the veil which they drew
around their proceedings enabled the members of these secret societies
to combine their efforts; and arrange their plans, in

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

security and without interruption, whenever they cherished any designs
of political innovation, or other projects, the open avowal and
prosecution of which the established authorities would not have
tolerated.

The facilities afforded by the system of secret association, and it may
even be said the temptations which it presents, to the pursuit of
political objects forbidden by the laws, are so great as to justify all
governments in prohibiting it, under whatever pretence it may be
attempted to be introduced. It is nothing to the purpose to argue that
under bad governments valuable political reforms have sometimes been
effected by such secret associations which would not otherwise have been
attained. The same mode of proceeding, in the nature of the thing, is
equally efficacious for the overthrow of a good government. Bad men are
as likely to combine in the dark for their objects as good men are for
theirs. In any circumstances, a secret association is an *imperium in
imperio*, a power separate from, and independent of, that which is
recognized as the supreme power in the state, and therefore something
essentially disorganizing, and which it is contrary to the first
principles of all government for any state to tolerate. In the case of a
bad government, indeed, all means are fairly available for its overthrow
which are not morally objectionable, the simple rule for their
application being that it shall be directed by considerations of
prudence and discretion. In such a case a secret association of the
friends of reform may sometimes be found to supply the most effective
means for accomplishing the desired end; but that end, however desirable
it may be, is not one which the constitution of the state itself can
rationally contemplate. The constitution cannot be founded upon the
supposition that even necessary alterations of it are to be brought
about through agencies out of

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

itself, and farming no part of its regular mechanism. Whenever such
agencies are successfully brought into operation, there is a revolution,
and the constitution is at an end. Even the amendment of the
constitution so effected is its destruction.

Yet most of the more remarkable secret associations which have existed
in different ages and countries have probably either been originally
formed to accomplish some political end, or have come to contemplate
such an object as their chief design. Even when nothing more than a
reformation of the national religion has been, as far as can be
discovered, the direct aim of the association, it may still be fairly
considered as of a political character, from the manner in which
religion has been mixed up in almost every country with the civil
institutions of the state. The effect which it was desired to produce
upon the government may in many cases have been very far from extending
to its complete abolition, and the substitution of another form of
polity; an alteration in some one particular may have been all that was
sought, or the object of the association may even have been to support
some original principle of the constitution against the influence of
circumstances which threatened its subversion or modification. Whether
directed to the alteration or to the maintenance of the existing order
of things, the irregular and dangerous action of secret combinations is,
as we have said, a species of force which no state can reasonably be
expected to recognize. But it may nevertheless have happened at
particular emergencies, and during times of very imperfect civilization,
that valuable service has been rendered by such combinations to some of
the most important interests of society, and that they have to a
considerable extent supplied the defects of the rude and imperfect
arrangements of the ordinary government.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

The system of secret association is, indeed, the natural resource of the
friends of political reform, in times when the general mind is not
sufficiently enlightened to appreciate or to support their schemes for
the improvement of the existing institutions and order of things. To
proclaim their views openly in such circumstances would be of no more
use than haranguing to the desert. They might even expose themselves to
destruction by the attempt. But, united in a secret association, and
availing themselves of all the advantages at once of their superior
knowledge and intelligence, and of their opportunities of acting in
concert, a very few individuals may work with an effect altogether out
of proportion to their number. They may force in a wedge which in time
shall even split and shiver into fragments the strength of the existing
social system, no matter by how many ages of barbarism it may be
consolidated. Or, in the absence of a more regular law and police, they
may maintain the empire of justice by stretching forth the arm of their
own authority in substitution for that of the state, which lies
paralysed and powerless, and turning to account even the superstitions
and terrors of the popular imagination by making these, as excited by
their dark organization and mysterious forms of procedure, the chain
whereby to secure the popular obedience.

On the whole, the system of secret association for political objects,
even when there is no dispute about the desirableness of the ends sought
to be accomplished, may be pronounced to be a corrective of which good
men will avail themselves only in times of general ignorance, or under
governments that sin against the first principles of all good
government, by endeavouring to put a stop to the advancement of society
through the prohibition of the open expression of opinion; but, in
countries where the liberty of

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

discussion exists, and where the public mind is tolerably enlightened,
as entirely unsuited to the circumstances of the case as it is opposed
to the rules and maxims on which every government must take its stand
that would provide for its own preservation. In these happier
circumstances the course for the friends of social improvement to follow
is to come forward into the full light of day as the only place worthy
of their mission, and to seek the realization of their views by directly
appealing to the understandings of their fellow-citizens.

One evil to which secret societies are always exposed is the chance of
the objects and principles of their members being misrepresented by
those interested in resisting their power and influence. As the wakeful
eyes of the government, and of those concerned in the maintenance of the
actual system, will be ever upon them, they must strictly confine the
knowledge of their real views and proceedings to the initiated, and as
their meetings must for the same reason be held in retired places, and
frequently by night, an opportunity, which is rarely neglected, is
afforded to their enemies of spreading the most calumnious reports of
their secret practices, which, though conscious of innocence, they may
not venture openly to confute. By arts of this kind the suspicions and
aversion of the people are excited, and they are often thus made to
persecute their best friends, and still to bow beneath the yoke of their
real foes. The similarity of the accusations made against secret
associations in all parts of the world is a sufficient proof of their
falsehood, and we should always listen to them with the utmost
suspicion, recollecting the quarter from which they proceed. Of the
spotless purity of the Christian religion when first promulgated through
the Roman world no one can entertain a doubt; yet when persecution
obliged its

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

professors to form as it were a secret society, the same charges of
Thyestian banquets, and of the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes,
were made against them, which they themselves afterwards brought, and
with probably as little truth, against the various sects of the Gnostic
heresy. Wherever there is secrecy there will be suspicion, and charges
of something unable to bear the light of day will be made.

The ancient world presents one secret society of a professedly political
character--that of the Pythagoreans. Of religious ones it might be
expected to yield a rich harvest to the inquirer, when we call to mind
all that has been written in ancient and modern times concerning the
celebrated mysteries. But the original Grecian mysteries, such as those
of Eleusis, appear to have been nothing more than public services of the
gods, with some peculiar ceremonies performed at the charge of the
state, and presided over by the magistrates, in which there were no
secrets communicated to the initiated, no revelation of knowledge beyond
that which was generally attainable. The *private* mysteries, namely,
the Orphic, Isiac, and Mithraic, which were introduced from the East,
were merely modes employed by cunning and profligate impostors for
taking advantage of the weakness and credulity of the sinful and the
superstitious, by persuading them that by secret and peculiar rites, and
the invocation of strange deities, the apprehended punishment of sin
might be averted. The nocturnal assemblies for the celebration of these
mysteries were but too often scenes of vice and debauchery, and they
were discountenanced by all good governments. It is to these last, and
not to the Eleusinian mysteries, that the severe strictures of the
fathers of the church apply. <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md)

The history of Pythagoras and his doctrines is

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

extremely obscure. The accounts of this sage which have come down to us
were not written till many centuries after his death, and but little
reliance is to be placed on their details. Pythagoras was a Samian by
birth; he flourished in the sixth century before Christ, at the time
when Egypt exercised so much influence over Greece, and its sages sought
the banks of the Nile in search of wisdom. There is, therefore, no
improbability in the tradition of Pythagoras also having visited that
land of mystery, and perhaps other parts of the East, and marked the
tranquil order of things where those who were esteemed the wise ruled
over the ignorant people. He may therefore have conceived the idea of
uniting this sacerdotal system with the rigid morals and aristocratic
constitution of the Dorian states of Greece. His native isle, which was
then under the tyranny of Polycrates, not appearing to him suited for
the introduction of his new system of government, he turned his eyes to
the towns of Magna Græcia, or Southern Italy, which were at that time in
a highly flourishing condition, whose inhabitants were eager in the
pursuit of knowledge, and some of which already possessed written codes
of law. He fixed his view on Croton, one of the wealthiest and most
distinguished of those towns.

Aristocracy was the soul of the Dorian political constitutions, and the
towns of Magna Græcia were all Dorian colonies; but in consequence of
their extensive commerce the tendency of the people was at that time
towards democracy. To preserve the aristocratic principle was the object
of Pythagoras; but he wished to make the aristocracy not merely one of
birth; he desired that, like the sacerdotal castes of the East, it
should also have the supremacy in knowledge. As his system was contrary
to the general feeling, Pythagoras saw that it was only by gaining

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

the veneration of the people that he could carry it into effect; and by
his personal advantages of beauty of form, skill in gymnastic exercises,
eloquence, and dignity, he drew to himself the popular favour by casting
the mantle of mystery over his doctrines. He thus at once inspired the
people with awe for them, and the nobles with zeal to become initiated
in his secrets.

The most perfect success, we are told, attended the project of the
philosopher. A total change of manners took place in Croton; the
constitution became nearly Spartan; a body of 300 nobles, rendered by
the lessons of the sage as superior to the people in knowledge of every
kind as they were in birth, ruled over it. The nobles of the other
states flocked to Croton to learn how to govern by wisdom; Pythagorean
missionaries went about everywhere preaching the new political creed;
they inculcated on the people religion, humility, and obedience; such of
the nobles as were deemed capable were initiated in the wisdom of the
order, and taught its maxims and principles; a golden age, in which
power was united with wisdom and virtue, seemed to have begun upon
earth.

But, like every thing which struggles against the spirit of the age,
such a political system was not fated to endure. While Croton was the
chief seat of Pythagoreanism, luxury had fixed her throne in the
neighbouring city of Sybaris. The towns were rivals: one or the other
must fall. It was little more than thirty years after the arrival of
Pythagoras in Croton that a furious war broke out between them. Led by
Milo and other Pythagoreans, who were as expert in military affairs as
skilled in philosophy, the Crotoniates utterly annihilated the power of
their rivals, and Sybaris sank to rise no more. But with her sank the
power of the Pythagoreans. They judged

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

it inexpedient to give a large share of the booty to the people; the
popular discontent rose; Cylon, a man who had been refused admittance
into the order, took advantage of it, and urged the people on; the
Pythagoreans were all massacred, and a democracy established. All the
other towns took example by Croton, a general persecution of the order
commenced, and Pythagoras himself was obliged to seek safety in flight,
and died far away from the town which once had received him as a
prophet. The Pythagoreans never made any further attempts at attaining
political power, but became a mere sect of mystic philosophers,
distinguished by peculiarities of food and dress.

Ancient times present us with no other society of any importance to
which we can properly apply the term *secret*.

The different sects of the Gnostics, who are by the fathers of the
church styled heretics, were to a certain extent secret societies, as
they did not propound their doctrines openly and publicly; but their
history is so scanty, and so devoid of interest, that an examination of
it would offer little to detain ordinary readers.

The present volume is devoted to the history of three celebrated
societies which flourished during the middle ages, and of which, as far
as we know, no full and satisfactory account is to be found in English
literature. These are the Assassins, or Ismaïlites, of the East, whose
name has become in all the languages of Europe synonymous with murderer,
who were a secret society, and of whom we have in general such vague and
indistinct conceptions; the military order of the Knights Templars, who
were most barbarously persecuted under the pretext of their holding a
secret doctrine, and against whom the charge has been renewed at the
present day; and,

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

finally, the Secret Tribunals of Westphalia, in Germany, concerning
which all our information has hitherto been derived from the incorrect
statements of dramatists and romancers. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1.md)

It is the simplicity of truth, and not the excitement of romance, that
the reader is to expect to find in the following pages,--pictures of
manners and modes of thinking different from our own,--knowledge, not
mere entertainment, yet as large an infusion of the latter as is
consistent with truth and instruction.
