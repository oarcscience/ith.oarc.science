### CHAPTER VII.

<span class="small">Keäh Mohammed--Murder of the Khalif--Castles gained
in Syria--Ismaïlite Confession of Faith--Mohammed's Son Hassan gives
himself out for the promised Imam--His Followers punished--Succession of
Hassan--He abolishes the Law--Pretends to be descended from the
Prophet--Is murdered.</span>

THE policy of the society underwent no alteration on the accession of
Mohammed. The dagger still smote its enemies, and as each victim fell,
the people who maintained the rights of Ismaïl, and who were kept in
rigid obedience to the positive precepts of the Koran, beheld nothing
but the right hand of Heaven made bare for the punishment of crime and
usurpation. The new mountain prince had hardly taken the reins of
government into his hands when Rasheed, the successor of the late
khalif, eager to avenge the murder of his father, assembled an army and
marched against Alamoot. He had reached Isfahan, but there his march
terminated. Four Assassins, who had entered his service for the purpose,
fell upon him in his tent and stabbed him. When the news was conveyed to
Alamoot great rejoicings were made, and for seven days and seven nights
the trumpets and kettle-drums resounded from the towers of the fortress,
proclaiming the triumph of the dagger to the surrounding country.

The Syrian dominion of the Ismaïlites was at this time considerably
extended. They purchased from Ibn Amroo, [their](errata.htm#6.md) owner,
the castles of Cadmos and Kahaf, and took by force that of Massyat from
the

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

lords of Sheiser. This castle, which was situated on the west side of
Mount Legam, opposite Antaradus, became henceforth the chief seat of
Ismaïlite power in Syria. The society had now a line of coast to the
north of Tripolis, and their possessions extended inland to the verge of
the Hauran.

The reign of Mohammed presents few events to illustrate the history of
the Assassins. It was probably in his time that the following confession
of the Ismaïlite faith was made to the persons whom Sultan Sanjar sent
to Alamoot to inquire into it <span id="fr_44"></span>[\*](#fn_44.md):

"This is our doctrine," said the heads of the society. "We believe in
the unity of God, and acknowledge as the true wisdom and right creed
only that which accords with the word of God and the commands of the
Prophet. We hold these as they are delivered in the holy writ, the
Koran, and believe in all that the Prophet has taught of the creation,
and the last things, of rewards and punishments, of the last judgment,
and the resurrection. To believe this is necessary, and no one is
authorized to judge of the commands of God for himself, or to alter a
single letter in them. These are the fundamental doctrines of our sect,
and if the sultan does not approve of them, let him send hither one of
his learned divines, that we may argue the matter with him."

To this creed no orthodox Mussulman could well make any objection. The
only question was, what was the Ismaïlite system of interpretation, and
what other doctrines did they deduce from the sacred text; and the
active employment of the dagger of the Fedavee suggested in tolerably
plain terms that there were others, and that something not very
compatible with the peace and order of society lay behind the veil.
Indeed the circumstance of the Ismaïlite chiefs

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

professing themselves to be only the ministers and representatives of
the invisible imam was in itself highly suspicious; for what was to
prevent their enjoining any atrocity which might be for their interest,
in the name of their viewless master? They are ignorant indeed of human
nature who suppose that a prompt obedience would not be yielded to all
such commands by the ignorant and bigoted members of the sect.

The ill leaven of the secret doctrine displayed itself before very long.
Keäh Mohammed, who appears to have been a weak, inefficient man, was
held in little esteem by his followers. They began to attach themselves
to his son Hassan, who had the reputation of being a man of prodigious
knowledge, learned in tradition and the text of the Koran, versed in
exposition, and well acquainted with the sciences. Hassan, either
through vanity or policy, began secretly to disseminate the notion of
his being himself the imam whose appearance had been promised by Hassan
Ben Sabah. Filled with this idea, the more instructed members of the
society vied with each other in eagerness to fulfil his commands, and
Keäh Mohammed, seeing his power gradually slipping from him, was at
length roused to energy. Assembling the people, he reprobated in strong
terms the prevailing heresy. "Hassan," said he, "is my son, and I am not
the imam, but only one of his missionaries. Whoever maintains the
contrary is an infidel." Then, in true Assassin fashion, he gave effect
to his words by executing 250 of his son's adherents, and banishing an
equal number from the fortress. Hassan himself, in order to save his
life, was obliged publicly to curse those who held the new opinions, and
to write dissertations condemning their tenets, and defending those of
his father. By these means he succeeded in removing suspicion

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

from the mind of the old chief; but, as he continued to drink wine in
private, and violated several of the other positive precepts of the law,
his adherents became only the more convinced of his being the imam, at
whose coming all the precepts of the law were to cease to be of any
force.

Hassan was obliged to be cautious and conceal his opinions during the
lifetime of his father; for, whatever their opinion might be of the
capacity and intellectual power of the head of their sect, the Assassins
believed themselves to be bound to obey his orders, as proceeding from
the visible representative of the sacred invisible imam; and, high as
their veneration for Hassan was, his blood would have flowed on the
ground the instant an order to that effect had passed the lips of his
father. But no sooner was Keäh Mohammed dead, after a reign of
twenty-four years, and the supreme station was come to Hassan himself,
than he resolved to fling away the mask at once, and not• only to
trample on the law himself, but to authorize and encourage all his
people to do the same.

Accordingly, when the month Ramazan (the Mohammedan Lent) of the 559th
year of the Hejra (A. D. 1163) was come, he ordered all the inhabitants
of Roodbar to assemble on the place of prayer (*Mosella*), or esplanade,
before the castle of Alamoot. Facing the direction of the Keblah <span
id="fr_45"></span>[\*](#fn_45.md) he caused a pulpit to be erected, at
whose four corners were displayed banners of the different hues familiar
to Islam, namely, a white, a red, a yellow, a green, colours adverse to
the black of the Abbassides.

On the 17th day of the month the people, in obedience to his commands,
appeared in great numbers beneath the walls of the fortress. After a
little

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

time Hassan came forth and ascended the pulpit. All voices were hushed;
expectation waited on the words of the Sheikh-al-Jebal. He commenced his
discourse by perplexing the minds of his auditors by enigmatical and
obscure sentences. When he had thus deluded them for some time, he
informed them that an envoy of the imam (that is, the phantom of a
khalif who was still sitting on the throne at Cairo) had arrived, and
had brought him a letter addressed to all Ismaïlites, whereby the
fundamental tenets of the sect were renewed and confirmed. He proceeded
to assure them that, by this letter, the gates of mercy and compassion
had been opened for all who would follow and obey him; that they were
the true elect; that they were freed from all obligations of the law,
and delivered from the burden of all commands and prohibitions; that he
had now conducted them to the day of the resurrection, that is, of the
revelation of the imam. He then commenced in Arabic the Khootbeh, or
public prayer, which he said he had received from the imam; and an
interpreter, who stood at the foot of the pulpit, translated it for them
to the following effect:--

"Hassan, the son of Mohammed, the son of Buzoorg Oomeid, is our khalif
(*successor*), dai, and hoojet (*proof*). All who follow our doctrine
must hearken to him in affairs of faith and of the world, and regard his
commands as imperative, his words as impressive. They must not
transgress his prohibitions, and they must regard his commands as ours.
They should know that our lord has had compassion upon them, and has
conducted them to the most high God."

When this proclamation was made known Hassan came down from the pulpit,
directed tables to be spread, and commanded the people to break the
fast, and to give themselves up, as on festival days, to all

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

kinds of enjoyment, with music, and various games and sports. "For
this," cried he, "this is the day of the resurrection;" that is,
according to the Ismaïlite mode of interpreting the Koran, the day of
the manifestation of the imam.

What the orthodox had before only suspected was now confirmed. It was
now manifest, beyond doubt, that the Ismaïlites were heretics who
trampled under foot all the most plain and positive precepts of Islam;
for, though they might pretend to justify their practice by their
allegorical system of interpretation, it was clearly repugnant to common
sense, and might be made the instrument of sanctioning, under the name
of religion, every species of enormity. From this time the term Moolahid
(impious) began to become the common and familiar appellation of the
Ismaïlites in the mouths of the orthodox Moslems. As to the Ismaïlites
themselves, they rejoiced in what they had done; they exulted like
emancipated bondsmen in the liberty which they had acquired; and they
even commenced a new era from the 17th (or, according to some
authorities, the 7th) Ramazan of the 559th year, namely, the day of the
manifestation of the imam. To the name of Hassan they henceforth affixed
the formula "On his memory be peace;" which formula, it would appear,
was employed by itself to designate him; for the historian Mirkhond
assures us that he had been informed by a credible person that over the
door of the library in Alamoot was the following inscription:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"With the aid of God, the bonds  
Of the law he took away,  
The commander of the world,  
Upon whose name be peace."</span>

</div>

The madness of Hassan now attained its climax. He disdained to be
regarded, like his predecessors, as merely the representative of the
imam on earth,

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

but asserted himself to be the true and real imam, who was now at length
made manifest to the world. He sent letters to all the settlements of
the society, requiring them to acknowledge him in his new capacity. He
was prudent enough, however, to show a regard for the dignity and power
of his different lieutenants in these letters, as appears by the
following specimen, being the letter which was sent to Kuhistan, where
the reis Mozaffar commanded:--

"I Hassan say unto you that I am the representative of God upon earth,
and mine in Kuhistan is the reis Mozaffar, whom the men of that country
are to obey, and to receive his word as mine."

The reis erected a pulpit in the castle of Moominabad, the place of his
residence, and read the letter aloud to the people, the greater part of
whom listened to its contents with joy. The tables were covered before
the pulpit, the wine was brought forth, the drums and kettle-drums
resounded, the notes of the pipe and flute inspired joy, and the day of
the abolition of the positive precepts of the law was devoted to mirth
and festivity. Some few, who were sincere and upright in their obedience
to Islam, quitted the region which they now regarded as the abode of
infidelity, and went in search of other abodes; others, of a less
decided character, remained, though shocked at what they were obliged
every day to behold. The obedience to the commands of the *soi-disant*
imam was, however, tolerably general, and, according to Hammer, who can
scarcely, however, be supposed to regard the system of Hassan as really
more licentious than he has elsewhere described that of Mahomet, "the
banner of the freest infidelity, and of the most shameless immorality,
now waved on all the castles of Roodbar and Kuhistan, as the standard of
the new illumination; and, instead of the name of the Egyptian khalif,
resounded from

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

all the pulpits that of Hassan as the true successor of the Prophet."

The latter point had presented some difficulty to Hassan; for, in order
to satisfy the people on that head, it was necessary to prove a descent
from the Prophet, and this was an honour to which it was well known the
family from which he was sprung had never laid claim. He might take upon
him to abolish the positive precepts of the law as he pleased, and the
people, whose inclinations were thereby gratified, would not perhaps
scan very narrowly the authority by which he acted; but the attempt to
deprive the Fatimite khalif of the honour which he had so long enjoyed,
and to assume the rank of God's vicegerent on earth in his room, was
likely to give too great a shock to their prejudices, if not cautiously
managed.

It was necessary, therefore, that he should prove himself to be of the
blood of the Fatimites. He accordingly began to drop some dark hints
respecting the truth of the received opinion of his being the son of
Keäh Mohammed. Our readers will recollect that, when Hassan Sabah was in
Egypt, a dispute had taken place respecting the succession to the
throne, in which Hassan had nearly lost his life for opposing the
powerful commander-in-chief (*Emir-al-Jooyoosh*), and Nezar, the prince
for whom the khalif Mostanser had designed the succession, had been
deprived of his right by the influence of that officer. The confidents
of Hassan now began to give out that, in about a year after the death of
the khalif Mostanser, a certain person named Aboo-’l-Zeide, who had been
high in his confidence, had come to Alamoot, bearing with him a son of
Nezar, whom he committed to the care of Hassan Sabah, who, grateful to
the memory of the khalif and his son, had received the fugitive with
great honour, and assigned a village at the foot of Alamoot for the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

residence of the young imam. When the youth was grown up he married and
had a son, whom he named *On his Memory be Peace*. Just at the time when
the imam's wife was confined in the village, the consort of Keäh
Mohammed lay in at the castle; and, in order that the descendant of
Fatima might come to the temporal power which was his right, a
confidential woman undertook and succeeded in the task of secretly
changing the children. Others went still further, and did not hesitate
to assert that the young imam had intrigued with the wife of Keäh
Mohammed, and that Hassan was the fruit of their adulterous intercourse.
Like a true pupil of ambition, Hassan was willing to defame the memory
of his mother, and acknowledge himself to be a bastard, provided he
could succeed in persuading the people to believe him a descendant of
the Prophet.

These pretensions of Hassan to a Fatimite pedigree gave rise to a
further increase of the endless sects into which the votaries of Islam
were divided. Those who acknowledged it got the name of Nezori, and by
them Hassan was called the Lord of the Resurrection (*Kaim-al-Kiamet*),
and they styled themselves the Sect of the Resurrection.

The reign of the vain, inconsiderate Hassan was but short. He had
governed the society only four years when he was assassinated by his
brother-in-law, Namver, a descendant, we are told, of the family of
Buyah, which had governed the khalifs and their dominions before the
power passed into the hands of the Turkish house of Seljook.
