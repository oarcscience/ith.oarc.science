THERE was a man named Ali, who resided in the city of Rei, in Persia. He
was a strenuous Sheäh, and maintained that his family had originally
come from Koofa, in Arabia; but the people of Khorasan asserted that his
family had always dwelt in one of the villages near Toos, in that
province, and that consequently his pretensions to an Arabian extraction
were false. Ali, it would appear, was anxious to conceal his opinions,
and employed the strongest asseverations to convince the governor of the
province, a rigid Soonite, of his orthodoxy, and finally retired into a
monastery to pass the remainder of his days in meditation. As a further
means of clearing himself from the charge of heresy he sent his only son
Hassan Sabah <span id="fr_21"></span>[\*](#fn_21.md) to Nishaboor to be
instructed by the celebrated imam Mowafek, who resided at that place.
What lessons he may have given the young Hassan previously to parting
with him, and what communication he may have afterwards kept up with
him, are points on which history is silent.

The fame of the imam Mowafek was great over all Persia, and it was
currently believed that those

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

who had the good fortune to study the Koran and the Soonna <span
id="fr_22"></span>[\*](#fn_22.md) under him were secure of their fortune in
after-life. His school was consequently thronged by youths ambitious of
knowledge and future distinction; and here Hassan met, and formed a
strict intimacy with, Omar Khiam, afterwards so distinguished as a poet
and an astronomer, and with Nizam-al-Moolk (*Regulation of the Realm*),
who became vizir to the monarchs of the house of Seljook. This last, in
a history which he wrote of himself and his times, relates the following
instance of the early development of the ambition of Hassan. As these
three, who were the most distinguished pupils of the imam, were one day
together, "It is the general opinion," said Hassan, "that the pupils of
the imam are certain of being fortunate. This opinion may be verified in
one of us. So come, let us pledge ourselves to one another that he who
shall be successful will make the other two sharers in his good
fortune." His two companions readily assented, and the promise was
mutually given and received.

Nizam-al-Moolk entered the path of politics, where his talents and his
noble qualities had free course, and he rose through the various
gradations of office, till at length he attained the highest post in the
realm, the viziriate, under Alp Arslan (*Strong Lion*), the second
monarch of the house of Seljook. When thus exalted he forgot not his
former friends; and calling to mind the promise which he had made, he
received with great kindness Omar Khiam, who waited on him to
congratulate him on his elevation; and he offered at once to employ all
his interest to procure him a post under the government. But Omar, who
was devoted to Epicurean indulgences, and averse from toil and care,
thanking his friend,

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

declined his proffered services; and all that the vizir could prevail on
him to accept was an annual pension of 1,200 ducats on the revenues of
Nishaboor, whither he retired to spend his days in ease and
tranquillity.

The case was different with Hassan. During the ten years' reign of Alp
Arslan he kept aloof from the vizir, living in obscurity, and probably
maturing his plans for the future. But when the young prince Malek Shah
(*King King*) mounted the throne he saw that his time was come. He
suddenly appeared at the court of the new monarch, and waited on the
powerful vizir. The story is thus told by the vizir himself in his work
entitled Wasaya (*Political Institutes*), whence it is given by
Mirkhond.

"He came to me at Nishaboor in the year that Malek Shah, having got rid
of Kaward, had quieted the troubles which his rebellion had caused. I
received him with the greatest honours, and performed, on my part, all
that could be expected from a man who is a faithful observer of his
oaths, and a slave to the engagements which he has contracted. Each day
I gave him a new proof of my friendship, and I endeavoured to satisfy
his desires. He said to me once, 'Khojah (*master*), you are of the
number of the learned and the virtuous; you know that the goods of this
world are but an enjoyment of little duration. Do you then think that
you will be permitted to fail in your engagements by letting yourself be
seduced by the attractions of greatness and the love of the world? and
will you be of the number of *those who violate the contract made with
God?*' 'Heaven keep me from it!' replied I. 'Though you heap honours
upon me,' continued he, 'and though you pour upon me benefits without
number, you cannot be ignorant that that is not the way to perform what
we once pledged ourselves to respecting each other.' 'You are right,'
said I; 'and I

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

am ready to satisfy you in what I promised. All that I possess of honour
and power, received from my fathers or acquired by myself, belongs to
you in common with me.' I then introduced him into the society of the
sultan, I assigned him a rank and suitable titles, and I related to the
prince all that had formerly passed between him and me. I spoke in terms
of such praise of the extent of his knowledge, of his excellent
qualities, and his good morals, that he obtained the rank of minister
and of a confidential man. But he was, like his father, an impostor, a
hypocrite, one who knew how to impose, and a wretch. He so well
possessed the art of covering himself with an exterior of probity and
virtue that in a little time he completely gained the mind of the
sultan, and inspired him with such confidence that that prince blindly
followed his advice in most of those affairs of a greater and more
important nature which required good faith and sincerity, and he was
always decided by his opinion. I have said all this to let it be seen
that it was I who had raised him to this fortune, and yet, by an effect
of his bad character, there came quarrels between the sultan and me, the
unpleasant result of which had like to have been that the good
reputation and favour which I had enjoyed for so many years were near
going into dust and being annihilated; for at last his malignity broke
out on a sudden, and the effects of his jealousy showed themselves in
the most terrible manner in his actions and in his words."

In fact, Hassan played the part of a treacherous friend. Everything that
occurred in the divan was carefully reported to the sultan, and the
worst construction put upon it, and hints of the incapacity and
dishonesty of the vizir were thrown out on the fitting occasions. The
vizir himself has left us an account of what he considered the worst
trick which his old

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

schoolfellow attempted to play him. The sultan, it seems, wishing to see
a clear and regular balance-sheet of the revenues and expenditure of his
empire, directed Nizam-al-Moolk to prepare it. The vizir required a
space of more than a year for the accomplishment of the task. Hassan
deemed this a good opportunity for distinguishing himself, and boldly
offered to do what the sultan demanded in forty days, not more than
one-tenth of the time required by the vizir. All the clerks in the
finance department were immediately placed at the disposal of Hassan;
and the vizir himself confesses that at the end of the forty days the
accounts were ready to be laid before the sultan. But, just when we
might expect to see Hassan in triumph, and enjoying the highest favour
of the monarch, we find him leaving the court in disgrace and vowing
revenge on the sultan and his minister. This circumstance is left
unexplained by the Ornament of the Realm, who however acknowledges, with
great *naïveté*, that, if Hassan had not been obliged to fly, he should
have left the court himself. But other historians inform us that the
vizir, apprehensive of the consequences, had recourse to art, and
contrived to have some of Hassan's papers stolen, so that, when the
latter presented himself before the sultan, full of hope and pride, and
commenced his statement, he found himself obliged to stop for want of
some of his most important documents. As he could not account for this
confusion, the sultan became enraged at the apparent attempt to deceive
him, and Hassan was forthwith obliged to retire from court with
precipitation.

Nizam-al-Moolk determined to keep no measures with a man who had thus
sought his ruin, and he resolved to destroy him. Hassan fled to Rei,
but, not thinking [himself](errata.htm#2.md) safe there, he went further
south,

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

and took refuge with his friend the reis <span
id="fr_23"></span>[\*](#fn_23) Aboo-’l-Fazl (Father of Excellence.md), at
Isfahan. What his plans may have hitherto been is uncertain; but now
they seem to have assumed a definite form, and he unceasingly meditated
on the means of avenging himself on the sultan and his minister. In
consultation one day with Aboo-’l-Fazl, who appears to have adopted his
speculative tenets, after he had poured out his complaints against the
vizir and his master, he concluded by passionately saying, "Oh that I
had but two faithful friends at my devotion! soon should I overthrow the
Turk and the peasant," meaning the sultan and the vizir. Aboo-’l-Fazl,
who was one of the most clear-headed men of his time, and who still did
not comprehend the long-sighted views of Hassan, began to fancy that
disappointment had deranged the intellect of his friend, and, believing
that reasoning would in such a case be useless, commenced giving him at
his meals aromatic drinks and dishes prepared with saffron, in order to
relieve his brain. Hassan perceived what his kind host was about, and
resolved to leave him. Aboo-’l-Fazl in vain employed all his eloquence
to induce him to prolong his visit; Hassan departed, and shortly
afterwards set out for Egypt.

Twenty years afterwards, when Hassan had accomplished all he had
projected, when the sultan and the vizir were both dead, and the society
of the Assassins was fully organized, the reis Aboo-’l-Fazl, who was one
of his most zealous partisans, visited him at his hill-fort of Alamoot.
"Well, reis," said Hassan,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "which of us was
the madman? did you or I stand most in need of the aromatic drinks and
the dishes prepared with saffron which you used to have served up at
Isfahan? You see that I kept my word as soon as I had found two trusty
friends."

When Hassan left Isfahan, in the year 1078, the khalif Mostanser, a man
of some energy, occupied the throne of Egypt, and considerable exertions
were made by the missionaries of the society at Cairo to gain proselytes
throughout Asia. Among these proselytes was Hassan Sabah, and the
following account of his conversion, which has fortunately been
preserved in his own words, is interesting, as affording a proof that,
like Cromwell, and, as we have supposed, Mohammed, and all who have
attained to temporal power by means of religion, he commenced in
sincerity, and was deceived himself before he deceived others.

"From my childhood," says he, "even from the age of seven years, my sole
endeavour was to acquire knowledge and capacity. I had been reared up,
like my fathers, in the doctrine of the twelve imams, and I made
acquaintance with an Ismaïlite companion (*Refeek*), named Emir Dhareb,
with whom I knit fast the bonds of friendship. My opinion was that the
tenets of the Ismaïlites resembled those of the Philosophers, and that
the ruler of Egypt was a man who was initiated in them. As often,
therefore, as Emir said anything in favour of these doctrines I fell
into strife with him, and many controversies on points of faith ensued
between him and me. I gave not in to anything that Emir said in
disparagement of our sect, though it left a strong impression on my
mind. Meanwhile Emir parted from me, and I fell into a severe fit of
sickness, during which I reproached myself, saying, that the doctrine of
the Ismaïlites was assuredly the true one, and that yet out of obstinacy
I had not gone over to it, and that

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

should death (which God avert!) overtake me, I should die without having
attained to the truth. At length I recovered of that sickness, and I now
met with another Ismaïlite, named Aboo Nejm Zaraj, of whom I inquired
touching the truth of his doctrine. Aboo Nejm explained it to me in the
fullest manner, so that I saw quite through the depths of it. Finally I
met a dai, named Moomin, to whom the sheikh Abd-al-Melik (*Servant of
the King*, i, e. *of God*) Ben Attash, the director of the missions of
Irak, had given permission to exercise this office. I besought that he
would accept my homage (in the name of the Fatimite khalif), but this he
at the first refused to do, because I had been in higher dignities than
he; but when I pressed him thereto beyond all measure, he yielded his
consent. When now the sheikh Abd-al-Melik came to Rei, and through
intercourse learned to know me, my behaviour was pleasing unto him, and
he bestowed on me the office of a dai. He said unto me, 'Thou must go
unto Egypt, to be a sharer in the felicity of serving the imam
Mostander.' When the sheikh Abd-al-Melik went from Rei to Isfahan I set
forth for Egypt <span id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24.md)."

There is something highly interesting in this account of his thoughts
and feelings given by Hassan Sabah, particularly when we recollect that
this was the man who afterwards organized the society of the Assassins,
so long the scourge of the East. We here find him, according to his own
statement, dreading the idea of dying without having openly made
profession of the truth, yet afterwards, if we are to credit the
Oriental historians, he inculcated the doctrine of the indifference of
all human actions. Unfortunately this declension from virtue to vice has
been too often exhibited to allow of our doubting that it may have
happened in the case of Hassan Sabah. A further reflection

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

which presents itself is this; Can anything be more absurd than those
points which have split the Moslems into sects? and yet how deeply has
conscience been engaged in them, and with what sincerity have they not
been embraced and maintained! Will not this apply in some measure to the
dissensions among Christians, who divide into parties, not for the
essential doctrines of their religion, but for some merely accessory
parts?

Hassan, on his arrival in Egypt, whither his fame had preceded him, was
received with every demonstration of respect. His known talents, and the
knowledge of the high favour and consideration which he had enjoyed at
the court of Malek Shah, made the khalif esteem him a most important
acquisition to the cause of the Ismaïlites, and no means were omitted to
soothe and flatter him. He was met on the frontiers by the Dai-al-Doat,
the sherif Taher Casvini, and several other persons of high
consideration; the great officers of state and court waited on hint as
soon as he had entered Cairo, where the khalif assigned him a suitable
abode, and loaded him with honours and tokens of favour. But such was
the state of seclusion which the Fatimite khalifs had adopted, that
during the eighteen months which Hassan is said to have passed at Cairo
he never once beheld the face of Mostanser, though that monarch always
evinced the utmost solicitude about him, and never spoke of him but in
terms of the highest praise.

While Hassan abode in Egypt the question of the succession to the throne
(always a matter of dispute in Oriental monarchies) became a subject of
dissension and angry debate at court. The khalif had declared his eldest
son, Nesar, to be his legitimate successor; but Bedr-al-Jemali, the
Emir-al-Juyoosh, or commander-in-chief of the army, who enjoyed almost
unlimited power under the Fatimites, asserted

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

the superior right of Musteäli, the khalif's second son, which right his
power afterwards made good. Hassan Sabah, not very wisely, as it would
seem, took the side of Prince Nesar, and thereby drew on himself the
hostility of Bedr-al-Jemali, who resolved on his destruction. In vain
the reluctant khalif struggled against the might of the powerful
Emir-al-Juyoosh; he was obliged to surrender Hassan to his vengeance,
and to issue an order for committing him to close custody in the castle
of Damietta.

While Hassan lay in confinement at Damietta one of the towers of that
city fell down without any apparent cause. This being looked upon in the
light of a miracle by the partisans of Hassan and the khalif, his
enemies, to prevent his deriving any advantage from it, hurried him on
board of a ship which was on the point of sailing for Africa. Scarcely
had the vessel put to sea when a violent tempest came on. The sea rolled
mountains high, the thunder roared, and the lightning flamed. Terror
laid hold on all who were aboard, save Hassan Sabah, who looked calm and
undisturbed on the commotion of the elements, while others gazed with
agony on the prospect of instant death. On being asked the cause of his
tranquillity he made answer, in imitation probably of St. Paul, "Our
Lord (*Seydna*) has promised me that no evil shall befall me." Shortly
afterwards the storm fell and the sea grew calm. The crew and passengers
now regarded him as a man under the especial favour of Heaven, and when
a strong west wind sprung up, and drove them to the coast of Syria, they
offered no opposition to his leaving the vessel and going on shore.

Hassan proceeded to Aleppo, where he staid some time, and thence
directed his course to Bagdad. Leaving that city he entered Persia,
traversed the province of Khuzistan, and, visiting the cities of

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Isfahan and Yezd,
went on to the eastern province of Kerman, everywhere making proselytes
to his opinions. He then returned to Isfahan, where he made a stay of
four months. He next spent three months in Khuzistan. Having fixed his
view on Damaghan and the surrounding country in Irak as a district well
calculated to be the seat of the power which he meditated establishing,
he devoted three entire years to the task of gaining disciples among its
inhabitants, For this purpose he employed the most eloquent dais he
could find, and directed them to win over by all means the inhabitants
of the numerous hill-forts which were in that region. While his dais
were thus engaged he himself traversed the more northerly districts of
Jorjan and Dilem, and when he deemed the time fit returned to the
province of Irak, where Hussein Kaïni, one of the most zealous of his
missionaries, had been long since engaged in persuading the people of
the strong hill-fort of Alamoot to swear obedience to the khalif
Mostanser. The arguments of the dai had proved convincing to the great
majority of the inhabitants, but the governor, Ali Mehdi, an upright and
worthy man, whose ancestors had built the fort, remained, with a few
others, faithful to his duty, and would acknowledge no spiritual head
but the Abbasside khalif of Bagdad; no temporal chief but the Seljookian
Malek Shah. Mehdi, when he first perceived the progress of Ismaïlism
among his people, expelled those who had embraced it, but afterwards
permitted them to return. Sure of the aid of a strong party within the
fort, Hassan is said to have employed against the governor the same
artifice by which Dido is related to have deceived the Lybians <span
id="fr_25"></span>[\*](#fn_25.md). He

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

offered him 3,000 ducats for as much ground as he could compass with an
ox-hide. The guileless Mehdi consented, and Hassan instantly cutting the
hide into thongs surrounded with it the fortress of Alamoot. Mehdi,
seeing himself thus tricked, refused to stand to the agreement. Hassan
appealed to justice, and to the arms of his partisans within the
fortress, and by their aid compelled the governor to depart from
Alamoot. As Mehdi was setting out for Damaghan, whither he proposed to
retire, Hassan placed in his hand an order on the reis Mozaffer, the
governor of the castle of Kirdkoo, couched in these terms: "Let the reis
Mozaffer pay to Mehdi, the descendant of Ali, 3,000 ducats, as the price
of the fortress of Alamoot. Peace be upon the Prophet and his family!
God, the best of directors, sufficeth us." Mehdi could hardly believe
that a man of the consequence of the reis Mozaffer, who held an
important government under the Seljookian sultans, would pay the
slightest attention to the order of a mere adventurer like Hassan Sabah;
he, however, resolved, out of curiosity, or rather, as we are told,
pressed by his want of the money, to try how he would act. He
accordingly presented the order, and, to his infinite surprise, was
forthwith paid the 3,000 ducats. The reis had in fact been long in
secret one of the most zealous disciples of Hassan Sabah.

Historians are careful to inform us that it was on the night of
Wednesday, the sixth of the month Rejeb, in the 483d year of the Hejra,
that Hassan Sabah made himself master of Alamoot, which was to become
the chief seat of the power of the sect of the Ismaïlites. This year
answers to the year 1090 of the Christian era, and thus the dominion of
the Assassins was founded only nine years before the Christians of the
west established their empire in the Holy Land.
