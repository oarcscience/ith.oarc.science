### CHAPTER VI.

<span class="small">Keäh Buzoorg Oomeid--Affairs of the Society in
Persia--They acquire the Castle of Banias, in Syria--Attempt to betray
Damascus to the Crusaders--Murders committed during the reign of Keäh
Buzoorg.</span>

KEAH BUZOORG OOMEID trod faithfully in the footprints of his
predecessor. He built the strong fortress of Maimoondees, and he made
the enemies of the society feel that it was still animated by the spirit
of Hassan Sabah. Sultan Sanjar, who, on account of the favourable terms
on which he had made peace with the Assassins, was regarded by the
rigidly orthodox as a secret follower of their doctrine, declared A
himself once more their open enemy, and sent an army to ravage Kirdkoh.
These troops were defeated by those which Keäh sent against them; but
the following year Sanjar put to the sword a great number of the members
of the sect. The dagger, as usual, retaliated. Mahmood, the successor of
Sanjar, having first tried in vain the effect of arms, sent his grand
falconer Berenkesh to Alamoot, to desire that an envoy might be sent to
him to treat of peace. The Khojah (*Master*) Mohammed Nassihi
accompanied Berenkesh back to court, and kissed the hand of the sultan,
who spoke to him a few words about the peace; but as the Khojah was
going out of the palace, he and his followers were fallen upon and
massacred by the people.

When the sultan sent an ambassador to Alamoot to exculpate himself from
the guilt of participation in this violation of the laws of nations,
Keäh made

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

answer, "Go back to the sultan, and tell him, in my name, Mohammed
Nassihi trusted to your perfidious assurances, and repaired to your
court; if you speak truly, deliver up the murderers to justice; if not,
expect my vengeance." On the refusal of the sultan to surrender the
murderers, a corps of Assassins appeared at the gates of Casveen, slew
400 men, and led away 3,000 sheep, 200 horses, and 200 oxen. Next year
the sultan took, and retained for a short time, the fortress of Alamoot;
but a body of 2,000 men which he sent against Lamseer fled, without
drawing a sword, when they heard that the Refeek (*Companions*) of the
society were marching against them. Shortly afterwards the sultan died,
and the Assassins made another incursion into the district of Casveen,
where they carried off booty and prisoners.

The mountain chief would tolerate no rival near his throne. Hearing that
one Aboo Hashem, a descendant of Ali, had arrogated to himself the
dignity of imam in the province of Ghilan, which lies north of Kuhistan,
and had issued letters calling on the people to acknowledge him, Keäh
wrote to him to desist from his pretensions. The self-appointed imam
only replied by reviling the odious tenets of the Ismaïlites. The sheikh
forthwith sent a body of his troops against him, took him prisoner, and,
after trying him by a court-martial, committed him to the flames.

Though, as we have seen, the settlements of the Assassins were in the
mountainous region of Irak, in the north-west of Persia, their power was
of such a nature that no distance was a security against it. A Fedavee
could speedily traverse the intervening regions to plant his dagger in
the bosom of any prince or minister who had incurred the vengeance of
the Sheikh-al-Jebal. Accordingly we find the shah (*King*) of Khaurism,
between which and Irak lies

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

the extensive province of Khorasan, coming to Sultan Massood, the
successor of Mahmood, to concert with him a plan for the destruction of
these formidable foes to princes. The shah of Khaurism had been formerly
rather disposed to favour the Ismaïlites, but his eyes were now opened,
and he was become their most inveterate enemy. Sultan Massood, we know
not for what reason, bestowed on him the lands which Berenkesh, the
grand falconer, had held of the sultan. Berenkesh, mortally offended at
this unworthy treatment, retired, with his family, to the territory of
the Ismaïlites, and sought the protection of Keäh, whose open enemy he
had hitherto been. Policy, or a regard to good faith and humanity, made
the Assassin prince grant the protection which was required; and when
the shah of Khaurism wrote, reminding Keäh of his own former friendship,
and the bitter hostility of Berenkesh, and requesting him, on that plea,
to give up the fugitive, the sheikh replied, "The shah of Khaurism
speaks true, but we will never give up our suppliants." Long and bloody
enmity between the sheikh and the shah was the consequence of this
refusal to violate the rights of hospitality.

The Syrian branch of the society begins at this time to attract rather
more attention than that of Persia, chiefly on account of its connexion
with the Crusaders, who had succeeded in establishing an empire
extending from the frontiers of Egypt to those of Armenia. A Persian
Ismaïlite, named Behram of Astrabad, who is said to have commenced his
career by the murder of his own father, gained the confidence of the
vizir of the prince of Damascus, who gave him the castle of Banias, or
Banias (the ancient Balanea), for the use of the society. This place,
which became the nucleus of the power of the Assassins in Syria, lies in
a fertile, well-watered

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

plain, about 4,000 paces from the sea. The valley whence the numerous
streams which fructify it issue is called the Wadi-al-Jinn (*Valley of
Demons*), "a place," observes Hammer, whom no casual coincidence
escapes, "from its very name worthy of becoming a settlement of the
Assassins." From Banias they extended their power over the neighbouring
castles and fortresses, until, twelve years afterwards, the seat of
dominion was transferred thence to Massyat.

Behram fell shortly afterwards in an engagement against the people of
the valley of Taïm, the brother of whose chief had perished by the
daggers of the Assassins. His successor was Ismaïl, a Persian, who
continued the bond of amity with the vizir of Damascus, whither he sent,
by way of resident, a man named, rather inappropriately as it would
appear, Aboo-’l-Wefa (*Father of Fidelity*). This man so won the favour
of the vizir and prince that he was appointed to the office of Hakem, or
supreme judge; and having thus acquired power and influence, he
immediately turned his thoughts to the best mode of employing them for
the advantage of the society, an object always near the heart of a true
Ismaïlite. A place of strength on the sea-coast would, he conceived, be
of the utmost importance to them; so he fixed his eyes upon Tyre, and
fell upon the following expedient to obtain possession of it.

The Franks had been now upwards of thirty years established in the East.
Their daring and enthusiastic valour was at once the dread and the
admiration of their Mussulman foes, and feats almost surpassing the
fables of the romances of chivalry had been performed by their gallant
warriors. These were the auxiliaries to whom Aboo-’l-Wefa directed his
attention; for we are to observe that as yet the fanatic spirit had not
united all the Moslems in [enmity](errata.htm#5.md)

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

against the followers of the Cross, and the princes of Aleppo, Damascus,
and the other districts of Syria, had been more than once in alliance
with the Christian realms of Jerusalem and Antioch. Aboo-’l-Wefa sent
therefore and concluded a secret treaty with Baldwin II., king of
Jerusalem, in which he engaged, if the Christian warriors would secretly
march and appear before Damascus on a i Friday, when the emir and his
officers would be at the mosk, to give them possession of the gates of
the town. The king was in return to put Tyre into the hands of the
Ismaïlites.

The Christian army was assembled; all the barons of the kingdom appeared
in arms; the king in person led the host; the newly-formed military
order of the Templars displayed for the first time in the field their
striped banner *Beauséant*, afterwards so well known in many a bloody
fray. Prince Bernard of Antioch, Count Pontius of Tripolis, the brave
Joscelin of Edessa, led their knights and footmen to share in the
capture of the wealthy city of Damascus. The mountains which environ
Lake Tiberias were left behind, and the host joyfully emerged into the
plain watered by the streams Abana and Pharpar. But here defeat awaited
them. Taj-al-Molook (*Diadem of Kings*) Boozi, the emir of Damascus, had
in time discovered the plot of his hakem. He had put him and the vizir
to death, and had ordered a general massacre of the Ismaïlites in the
city <span id="fr_42"></span>[\*](#fn_42.md). The Christian army was now at
a place named Marj Safar, and the footmen had begun to plunder the
villages for food, when a small body of gallant Damascene warriors
rushed from the town and fell upon them. The defenceless Christians sank
beneath their blows, incapable of resistance. The rest of the army
advanced to aid or avenge their brethren, when

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

suddenly <span id="fr_43"></span>[\*](#fn_43.md) the sky became overcast,
thick darkness enveloped all objects, the thunder roared, the lightning
flashed, the rain poured down in torrents, and, by a rapid transition,
peculiar to Eastern climates, the rain and waters turned into snow and
ice, and augmented the horrors of the day. The superstitious and
conscience-stricken Crusaders viewed in this awful phenomenon the
immediate agency of heaven, and deemed it to be sent as a punishment for
their sins; and, recollecting that on that very spot but four years
before King Baldwin had gained, with a handful of men, a victory over an
army of the Damascenes, they were plunged into grief and humiliation.
The only advantage which they derived from this expedition was the
acquisition of the castle of Banias, which the Ismaïlite governor put
into their hands, that under their protection he might escape the fate
of his brethren.

Banias was given up to the Christians in the same year in which Alamoot
was taken by the Seljookian sultan, and thus the power of the Assassins
seemed to be almost gone. But it had in it a conservative principle,
and, hydra-like, it grew by its wounds. Alamoot was speedily recovered,
and three years afterwards Banias was once more the seat of a
Daï-al-Kebir. At the same time the dagger raged with unwonted fury
against all of whom the society stood in apprehension, and the annals of
the reign of Keäh Buzoorg Oomeid furnish a list of illustrious victims.

The first of these was the celebrated Aksunkur, Prince of Mossul, a
warrior equally dreaded by the Christians and by the Assassins. As this
prince, on his return from Maärra Mesrin, where the Moslem and Christian
hosts had parted without venturing to engage, entered the mosk at Mossul
to perform his

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

devotions, he was attacked at the moment when Le was about to take his
usual seat by eight assassins, disguised as dervishes. Three of them
fell beneath the blows of the valiant emir, but ere his people could
come to his aid he had received his death-wound and expired. The
remainder of the murderers became victims to the vengeance of the
people; one youth only escaped. The Arabian historian, Kemal-ed-Deen,
relates on this occasion a curious trait of the fanaticism and Spartan
spirit which animated the members of the sect of the Ismaïlites. When
the mother of the youth above-mentioned heard that the formidable
Aksunkur had been slain, she painted her face and put on her gayest
raiment and ornaments, rejoicing that her son had been found worthy to
die the glorious death of a martyr in the cause of the Imam. But when
she saw him return alive and unscathed, she cut off her hair and
blackened her countenance, and would not be comforted.

In the following year (1127) fell Moin-ed-deen, the vizir of Sultan
Sanjar. In this case the Assassin had engaged himself as a groom in the
service of the vizir. As Moin-ed-deen went one day into the stable to
look at his horses the Assassin appeared before him, stripped, and
holding one of the horses by the bridle. As the vizir, unsuspicious of
danger, came near where he was, the false groom made the horse rear,
and, under the pretence of soothing and pacifying the restive animal, he
took out a small dagger which he had concealed in the horse's mane, and
plunged it into the bosom of the vizir.

The slaughter of the Ismaïlites by the Prince of Damascus was not
forgotten, and two years afterwards he received two dagger wounds, one
of which proved mortal. Their vengeance was not appeased by his blood,
and his son and successor, Shems-al-Molook (*Sun of Kings*), perished by
a conspiracy

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

with the guilt of which the Assassins were charged. in the catalogue of
the victims of this period appear also the names of the Judges of the
East and of the West, of the Mufti of Casveen, of the Reis of Isfahan,
and the Reis of Tebreez.

The East has been at all times prolific of crime; human life is not
there held to be of the value at which it is estimated in Europe; and
the dagger and poison are freely employed to remove objects of
apprehension, to put obstacles out of the way of ambition, or to satiate
the thirst of vengeance. We are not, therefore, lightly to give credit
to every charge made against the Assassins, and to believe them guilty
of murders from which they had no advantage to derive. Thus, when at
this time the Fatimite Khalit Amir bi-ahkami-llah (*Commander of the
observance of the laws of God*) fell by the hands of murderers, the
probability is that he was not a victim to the vengeance of the
Ismaïlite society, whom he had never injured, but rather to that of the
family of the powerful vizir Afdal, who had been assassinated some time
before by the khalif's order, as we have every reason to suppose.

With a greater show of reason may the murder or Mostarshed, the Khalif
of Bagdad, be imputed to the policy of the mountain chief. The
Seljookian princes, the predecessors of Massood, had been satisfied to
exercise all real power in the empire which had once obeyed the house of
Abbas, leaving to that feeble *Shadow of God upon Earth* the
unsubstantial privilege of having the coin of the realm struck and
prayers offered on Friday in the mosk in his name. But Massood arrogated
even these rights to himself. and the helpless successor of the Prophet
was obliged to submit to the indignity which he could not pre vent. At
length some discontented military chiefs passed with their troops over
to the khalif, and persuaded

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

him that by one bold effort he might overthrow the might of the Turkish
sultan, and recover all his rights. The khalif listened to their
arguments, and, placing himself at the head of an army, marched against
Sultan Massood. But fortune proved adverse to him. At the first shock
the greater part of the troops of Bagdad abandoned him, and he remained
a captive in the hands of the sultan, who brought him with him a
prisoner to Maragha. Here a treaty was concluded between them, and the
khalif bound himself not to go any more outside of the walls of Bagdad,
and annually to pay a sum of money. This treaty appears to have been
displeasing to the Assassins; and, watching their opportunity, when
Massood was gone to meet the ambassadors of Sultan Sanjar, a party of
them fell upon and massacred the khalif and his train. The lifeless body
of the Commander of the Faithful was mangled by them in the most
scandalous manner.

After a blood-stained reign of fourteen years and three days Keäh
Buzoorg Oomeid died. Departing from the maxims of Hassan Sabah, who it
is probable wished to imitate the conduct of the Prophet, and leave the
supreme dignity elective, he appointed his own son, Keäh Mohammed, to be
his successor, induced either by paternal partiality, or believing him
to be the person best qualified for the office.
