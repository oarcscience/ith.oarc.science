<p>1. The sixth fargar<I>d</I>, A<I>d</I>-t&acirc;-vakhshy&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1271"></A><A HREF="#fn_1251"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, is this, that by him who is a wise upholder of the dignity</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_323"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 323</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of a priest's leadership, the priestly assembly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1272"></A><A HREF="#fn_1252"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> wanted for performing religious rites (d&ecirc;n&ocirc;) is enlarged; for this reason, because the nature of the person, whose resources are bounty for the needy, eagerly becomes a causer of exertion for the teaching (&acirc;m&ucirc;k&#335;) of accomplishments. 2. This, too, that by him whose habits are virtuous the glorification of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1273"></A><A HREF="#fn_1253"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is accomplished and taught; even on this account, for the sake of whatever advantage <I>and</I> pleasure are due to virtue, they, indeed, whose habits are virtuous, glorify him, moreover, who is the creator of those virtuous habits, who is A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> himself. 3. This, too, that by him who speaks virtuous words the performance even of the worship of Voh&ucirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1274"></A><A HREF="#fn_1253"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is also taught; even on this account, because of the comeliness and desirableness of virtue, the good make it an example and speak virtuous words, <I>and</I> virtuous speaking is the worship of Voh&ucirc;man. 4. This, too, that the ceremonial which he whose way is virtuous shall accomplish becomes greater&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1275"></A><A HREF="#fn_1254"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> thereby; even for this reason, because the sacred beings come more particularly to the ceremonial of those of pure dispositions <I>and</I> virtuous ways, and accept <I>it</I>.</p>  
<p>5. This, too, that he who is a producer of benefit for promoters of good works becomes an extender&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1276"></A><A HREF="#fn_1255"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the teaching of religion; even for this reason, because from producing benefit for promoters of good works <I>arises</I> an increase of good works, from an increase of good works <I>arises</I> further progress of the will of the sacred beings, from further progress of the will of the sacred beings <I>arises</I> more progress</p>

<p><A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the good religion, <I>and</I> from more progress <I>of</I> the good religion arises an extension of the teaching of the good religion in the world. 6. This, too, that by him who possesses authority through virtue, discrimination&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1277"></A><A HREF="#fn_1256"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as to the regulation of duties is taught to mankind; even for this reason, because the possessor of authority through virtue is a man who becomes a decider <I>and</I> ruler, <I>and</I> mankind learn and practise to exercise the disposition, habits, and custom of rulers.</p>  
<p>7. This, too, that <I>he</I> who is a giver of the needful <I>to</I> his own needy ones has given himself to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t; even for this reason, because the needful <I>being</I> given <I>to</I> one's own needy ones is the existence of true liberality, which is a compendium of the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t; by him who is thereby ennobled (v&acirc;s<I>p</I>&ucirc;harak&acirc;n&icirc;-a&icirc;t&#335;) the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t is then put on, and whoever <I>has</I> put on the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t [has given himself to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t. 8. This, too, that by him who]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1278"></A><A HREF="#fn_1257"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> gives the leadership [to him who is suitable for the leadership]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1279"></A><A HREF="#fn_1257"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> even the wisdom <I>of</I> that man is increased; for this reason, because even the wisdom of the suitable, through which they accomplish that leadership, when the leadership comes to them, grows further with the glory of that duty.</p>  
<p>9. This, too, that he who <I>has</I> to select the better of two ways, which are good and bad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1280"></A><A HREF="#fn_1258"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, is assisted</p>  
<p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to do <I>so</I> by the benefiters&#146; ordeal of fire and ore; even for this reason, because that is discrimination by the eye of wisdom, which is the way of good intention, <I>and</I> the benefiters are decisive declarers of acquittal and incrimination through fire and metal, the two good discriminators; and when the business <I>is of</I> a different kind, even then both <I>are</I> associates in discriminating, and are powerful connections of one another. 10. This, too, that he who shall do that thing from <I>which</I> advantage of the sacred beings <I>arises</I>, is empowered to discriminate truly that which is sagacious&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1281"></A><A HREF="#fn_1259"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in thought, word, <I>and</I> deed; even for this reason, because from doing anything for the advantage of the sacred beings <I>arises</I> the reign of the will of the sacred beings in the world, from the reign of the will of the sacred beings in the world <I>arises</I> the freedom from danger <I>of</I> the temporal existence of the world, <I>and</I> the freedom from danger of the temporal existence of the world contributes also to the power of him who is sagacious in discriminating truly as to thought, word, <I>and</I> deed.</p>  
<p>11. This, too, that by him who thinks of the affairs of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> the eternity (ham&acirc;y&icirc;k&icirc;h) <I>of</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1282"></A><A HREF="#fn_1260"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and also the consideration of his own eternity <I>by</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> are thought of; even on this account, because mankind mind and serve A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> for the sake of even the hope&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1283"></A><A HREF="#fn_1260"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of eternal benefit from him; <I>and</I> they who think of him, through the eternal benefit due to him, are themselves increasing that benefit which is eternal, and it is thought eternal by him that thinks of that eternal <I>thing</I> his own eternity. 12. This, too, that</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A></p>  
<p><I>he</I> who restrains a person from reverence of the demons, has diverted him from making the world sickly; even for this reason, because whoever <I>has</I> restrained a person from reverence of the demons, has diverted a demon from making the world anarchical <I>and</I> from making the world sickly. 13. This, too, that by him who shall practise liberality benefit for the sun is caused, and by him who shall cause benefit for the sun benefit is caused also for the nature of the body of mankind; even for this reason, because <I>it is</I> declared <I>that</I> the sun <I>has</I> progressed through the radiance and glory of the liberal, and the nature of the body of mankind is preserved by the sun.</p>  
<p>14. This, too, that by him whose desire is for anything virtuous, and who possesses authority through virtue, mankind are controlled to persist (m&acirc;n&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>an&#335;) in virtue for receiving a reward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1284"></A><A HREF="#fn_1261"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because <I>he</I> whose desire is virtuous seeks happiness for every one&#151;a pre-eminent desire for the happiness of human existence <I>being</I> the desire of mankind for virtue&#151;and by him who requires that, <I>and</I> strives for <I>it</I> fully, so far as possible for him, any one whatever is brought to persist in virtue and to constrain the spirit for reward; and by him who possesses authority through virtue the continuance of mankind in authority <I>and their</I> persistence <I>and</I> instruction in virtue are attached to good works and are brought to reward. 15. This, too, that by him who possesses happiness through appropriation of the sacred beings mankind are attached to the sacred beings for receiving a reward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1285"></A><A HREF="#fn_1262"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because, on account of the possession of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_327"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 327</FONT></A></p>  
<p>happiness through appropriation of the sacred beings, he possesses <I>it</I> through the assistance and gratification of the good, and mankind shall therefore make him an example; it also becomes a good work for them, <I>and</I> they adhere to the sacred beings for receiving a reward.</p>  
<p>16. This, too, that by him who produces the benediction <I>of</I> him that is a conductor of investigation <I>and</I> a righteous judge, and who shall also occasion the reverence of the good, the teaching of the advantage of the righteous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1286"></A><A HREF="#fn_1263"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is likewise performed; even for this reason, because the essentials (m&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;g&acirc;n) of the advantage of the world are two&#151;one owing to justice, <I>and</I> one owing to generosity&#151;and it is declared <I>that</I> the advantage of <I>him</I> who possesses the blessings of the judges is owing to the justice of the judges, and the advantage of <I>him</I> who is reverent <I>to</I> the good is owing to the generosity of the good in developing the world, and the righteous teach about <I>it</I>.</p>  
<p>17. Righteousness is perfect excellence.</p>
