### CHAPTER LI.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The fifth fargar*d*, Khshmaibyâ <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[1](#fn_1242.md), is about this, that complaint is made
by Gô*s*-aûrvan <span id="fr_1262"></span>[2](#fn_1243.md) *that there* did
not exist *any one* who properly keeps the cattle that are in his
possession; even for this reason, because cattle are increased by such,
and others, through design (âhang) and a desire for that increase, act
by his example *and* keep cattle properly; *but* the complaint of
Gô*s*-aûrvan is *that* he does not exist. 2. This, too, that by him who
gives orders about the advancement *of* the concerns of the sacred
beings, the care of cattle is produced, and his soul attains to the
sacred beings; even for this reason, because the care of cattle is a
principal thing in the advancement of the concerns of the sacred beings,
*and* also for the preservation *of* the soul. 3. This, too, that by him
who keeps cattle with a controller (dastôbar) who is a
cattle-master <span id="fr_1263"></span>[3](#fn_1244.md), even a friend of
him who is the creator of cattle is taught to the cattle—the
cattle-master and he who is wise in the nourishment, protection, and
multiplication of cattle—even for this reason, because when his cattle
are kept with a controller who is a nourisher, protector, and multiplier
of cattle, the friendship of a nourisher for the nourished, *of* a
protector for the protected, and *of* a multiplier for the multipliable
is also exhibited by him; *and* the design of the creator for the
creation, through affection, is that of a nourisher for the nourished,
*of* a protector for the protected, *and of* a multiplier for the
multipliable.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

4\. This, too, that by him who maintains an animal with propriety, it is
presented to the sacred beings; even for this reason, because when *it*
is maintained by him with propriety, the will of the sacred beings
drives him on, and when the will of the sacred beings drives him on, it
is presented by him to the sacred beings. 5. This, too, that when *one*
shall admit the male of animals at the *proper* time, the mastery
(sa*r*dârînî*d*anŏ) of the animal is also taught by him; even for this
reason, because the admission of the male *of* the animals is the
essential business in the multiplication of cattle, and he who is a
multiplier has also taught the mastery of the animals. 6. This, too,
that by him who does not slaughter an animal until it attains to full
growth, the formation of a store for cattle is also taught; even for
this reason, because, from the increasing cattle produced, the profit of
mankind arises, *and* on account of the liking of mankind for profit,
they persevere more fully in cultivating cattle, and provide a store for
them.

7\. This, too, that *it is he* who is the more powerful of beings—that
is, strength is what is more in use *by* him <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[1](#fn_1245.md)—whose proceeding is for him who is his
own, so that he supplies that which it is necessary to supply; even for
this reason, because needful bountifulness *to* one's own needy ones
arises through lawful thoughts, lawful thoughts are provided by
expelling greed, lust, wrath, disgrace, envy, *and* other fiends from
the body, and a man expelling a fiend from *his* body becomes of
efficient strength. 8. This, too, that he is a very powerful person, for
invocation <span id="fr_1265"></span>[1](#fn_1245.md), supplication, and
attaining to good works,

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

who possesses wealth for the high-priest of the priests, who shall also
procure decisions and judgment always justly, and who likewise becomes
humble *and* reverent *to* the good; even for this reason, because the
wealth of multitudes of mankind is for maintaining the desires and
pleasure of the body, *for* procuring decisions and judgment whereto
their wishes tend, *and for* others becoming humble and reverent *to*
them even when *their* design is vicious; *but he* who possesses wealth
*for* invocation *and* connection *with* the wisdom of the religion,
through the high-priest of the religion, and shall procure just
decisions and judgment, *and* becomes humble and reverent *to* the good,
is a putter away of that design and *one* who, through the putting away
of that design, becomes a capable *and* very powerful person.

9\. This, too, that every one is made to persevere at *his* proper duty,
*as to* any excellent thing, by him who holds the reward of the
diligent, as the sacred beings are proceeding *with* a pure needy *one*;
for this reason, because the toiling of the body of a person at *his*
proper duty is induced *by* a desire of reward. 10. This, too, that by
him whose mouth (yông) <span id="fr_1266"></span>[1](#fn_1246.md) and *its*
appliances *are* for virtue, the possession of Vohûman is then
explained, through this mode, because the maintenance of the mouth and
*its* appliances as virtuous becomes so, when, through protection and
assistance *of* the good, *and* defeat and smiting of the vile, the
reformation of the world occurs; and this, too, is so, when *there is*
an existence of preparation of the friend of the good and the enemy

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

of the vile, and of friendship of the good and enmity of the vile,
through understanding good and evil; and the understanding of good and
evil is through possession of Vohûman, *and* that possession of Vohûman
becomes also an explainer of Vohûman.

11\. This, too, that by him who gives commands about the progress of the
concerns of the sacred beings, his own knowledge of every kind is also
developed; even for this reason, *because* the command *being* necessary
*for* the personal duty of the good, they also develope the knowledge of
every kind for which that commanding of duty and *its* auspiciousness
are suitable. 12. This, too, that by him who teaches the good, the good
work is then appropriated which is also an assistance of Zaratû*s*t
through speaking of the religion; even for this reason, because, on
account of those of the religion of Zaratû*s*t who really constitute the
renovation *of the universe*, the speaking connected with
Zaratû*s*t—through the teaching of the good *and* teachers not of the
same religion—*and* the assistance through speaking of the religion
become the good work appropriated.

13\. This, too, that by him who gives anything to that person who
praises the sacred beings *and* the good, a throne is appropriated *in*
yonder *world* <span id="fr_1267"></span>[1](#fn_1247.md), even on the
mention *of it*. 14. This, too, that by him who is teaching that which
is for the propitious, the damage that is owing to want of
resources <span id="fr_1268"></span>[2](#fn_1248.md) in religion is shut
out of the world; even for this reason, because, owing to that, he
increases the resources of religion of every kind, *and* the advantage

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

therefrom, in the world. 15. This, too, that by him who is bringing him
who is righteous forth to the rulers, for beneficence, the utmost
assistance is then afforded; even for this reason, because an
expectation of the utmost beneficence is further attached by him to the
place of obtainment <span id="fr_1269"></span>[1](#fn_1249.md).

16\. This, too, that by him who gives *him*self in service unto him who
is the supreme king of kings, the way of good thinking <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[2](#fn_1250.md), *of* the assistance of pleasure, and
*of* the production of sovereignty by Aûha*r*ma*zd* is disclosed to his
own; even for this reason, because the original reason of virtue is the
worthiness *of* mankind owing to the creator *and* their service unto
the creator, and, therefore, as he who is a well-ruling monarch is a
creator in the worldly *existence, and* a recompensing (pa*d*ŏ-dahâk)
leader of the creatures who steadfastly give *them*selves in service to
him, it is then given by him to the creator also; and I teach, besides,
*that* the origin of the virtue of worthiness, which is attached by the
creator to his own, is the way that is stated above, and other virtue is
also disclosed to his own thereby.

17\. Righteousness is excellence *that is* perfect.
