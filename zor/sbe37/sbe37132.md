### III. BAKÖ NASK <span id="fr_1734"></span>[1](#fn_1693.md).

Dk. IX, Chaps. X LVII-XLIX, describe the contents of the first three
fargar*d*s of this Nask, which are still extant in the Avesta text of
Yas. XIX—XXI, whose Pahlavi version may be translated as follows:—

#### Pahl. Yas. XIX = Bakŏ I.

The beginning of the Ahunavair of the Bakân <span
id="fr_1735"></span>[2](#fn_1694.md).

1\. Zaratû*s*t enquired of Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: 'O Aûha*r*ma*zd*, <span
id="fr_1736"></span>[3](#fn_1695.md) propitious spirit, creator of the
world of embodied existences, *and* righteous <span
id="fr_1737"></span>[4](#fn_1696)! (2.md) which were those words, O
Aûha*r*ma*zd*! that *were* spoken by thee for me, (3) before the sky,
before the water, before the earth, before the (well-yielding) cattle,
before the plants, before the fire which is Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

son, before the righteous man (Gâyômar*d*), before the demons, (who
remain) noxious creatures <span id="fr_1738"></span>[1](#fn_1697.md), and
mankind, before, all embodied existence (the creation of sovereignty),
*and* before all the excellence created by Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (which is
owing to) the manifestation of righteousness?'

4\. And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: ‘They were the apportionment of the
Ahunavair, *O* Spîtâmân Zaratû*s*t! (that spirit who would make the
religion current, who has formed that religion from the Ahunavair) which
was spoken out by me for thee; (5) (that is,) before the sky, (*&c., as
in* § 3).

6\. ‘Whoever chants that apportionment of the Ahunavair, *O* Spîtâmân
Zaratû*s*t! without talking (that is, he does not speak out in the
middle of any of its difficult Avesta <span
id="fr_1739"></span>[2](#fn_1698).md) *and* not without anxiety (that he
*may* slumber), (7) *it is* like a hundred above any other authority of
those of the Gâthas, when *one* chants *them* without talking, *or* not
without anxiety <span id="fr_1740"></span>[3](#fn_1699.md); (thus it
becomes *fit* for the ceremonial). 8. Whoever chants *it* while talking,
*or* without anxiety, (thus it becomes *fit* for the ceremonial,) *it
is* like ten above any other authority of those of the Gâthas.

9\. ‘Whoever in that embodied existence of mine, *O* Spîtâmân
Zaratû*s*t! recalls the apportionment of

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

the Ahunavair, (that is, seeks for *it*,) and, further, mutters that
which he recalls, (that is, shall accomplish *it* easily,) and, further,
chants that which he mutters, (that is, fully understands its ritual,)
and, further, reverences that which is chanted, (that is, shall
celebrate the ceremony,) (10) his soul I pass on to the best existence,
three times over the *K*inva*d* bridge, I who am Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (that
is, on that day *in* which he shall faithfully  <span
id="fr_1741"></span>[1](#fn_1700.md) provide the ceremony, it shall <span
id="fr_1742"></span>[2](#fn_1701.md) lead his soul three times unto *the
world* yonder, and shall <span id="fr_1743"></span>[2](#fn_1701.md) cause
its happiness therein) (11) to the best existence, the best
righteousness, and the best light. 12. Also whoever in that embodied
existence of mine, *O* Spîtâmân Zaratû*s*t! mutters the apportionment of
the Ahunavair, (that is, shall accomplish *it* easily,) *and*
drops <span id="fr_1744"></span>[3](#fn_1702.md), (that is, cuts off <span
id="fr_1745"></span>[4](#fn_1703)) (13.md) either <span
id="fr_1746"></span>[5](#fn_1704.md) as much as a half, or as much as a
third, or as much as a fourth, or as much as a fifth, (at a fifth the
foundation *of the sin* is laid, at a half it becomes quite complete,
and when he shall cut off the whole *it is* a Tanâpûhar <span
id="fr_1747"></span>[6](#fn_1705) *sin*,) (14.md) I twirl <span
id="fr_1748"></span>[7](#fn_1706.md) away the soul of him, I who am
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, from the best existence, (that is, I. would put it out;)
(15) to such an extent and width is the twirling away as *that of* this
earth, *and* even so the extent of this earth is as much as its width.’

16\. This saying is proclaimed (a revelation) possessing

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

an Ahu *and* possessing a Ratu, (from which this is manifest, namely,
the possession of a ruler and high-priest. 17. This, too, is said, that
it was) before that sky *was* created, before the water, before the
earth, before the plants, (18) before the creation of the four-legged ox
(which *was* the sole-created ox), (19) before the creation of the
two-legged righteous man (who *was* Gâyômar*d*), (20) *and* before that
sun of definite form (the body of the sun) *was* created as an
acquirement of the archangels. 21. It *was* (likewise) proclaimed to me
by the spirituality of propitiousness, (it likewise became possible for
the spirituality of propitiousness to say (22) *what was* said <span
id="fr_1749"></span>[1](#fn_1707) to Zaratû*s*t,.md) concerning the whole
material existence of the righteous who are, who have been, and who
*will* arise, (23) as to the progress of work, (that is, while they
shall perform for it that which is specified by it, and good works shall
arise through them,) *that* this work, among the living, is for
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (that is, that which they may perform, suitable for
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, they shall so perform as is declared by this fargar*d*).

24\. This, too, is the most expressive (most in effect) of those
statements which *were* ever spoken forth (till now), *or which one*
speaks forth (at present) <span id="fr_1750"></span>[2](#fn_1708.md), *or
shall* speak forth <span id="fr_1751"></span>[3](#fn_1709.md) (even
henceforth); (25) for it is *through* such a statement (such in effect)
as that, *if* the whole embodied existence (26) learnt it *and*, having
learnt <span id="fr_1752"></span>[4](#fn_1710.md), (that is, they shall
accomplish *it* easily,) they retain *it*, (that is, they

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

should rely upon it,) abstinence from passing *away* would be quite
masterful, (that is, they become immortal). 27. This, too, is our saying
spoken forth, (preserved <span id="fr_1753"></span>[1](#fn_1711.md) among
the revelation mentioned *n* this <span
id="fr_1754"></span>[2](#fn_1712) fargar*d*,.md) which is learnt, (that is,
they shall accomplish it easily,) and *one* recites, (that is, he utters
it in a ceremonial,) thus *for* any one whatever of the beings whose
righteousness is best, (that is, should he do it for a ceremonial, he
becomes *fit* for it; it is when he utters this in a ceremonial *that*
his soul becomes immortal).

28\. As *it is* here spoken forth, (that a ruler and high-priest are to
be maintained; as these things are so spoken, *and* as this law is so)
(29) even when it gives him an Ahu and a Ratu, (that is, it gives up
*his* person to the priestly assembly,) so it is thereby taught to him
*that* the thought of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is the creature *with* the first
thinking, (that is, the Gâthic lore is set going by him ) (30) whatever
teaches <span id="fr_1755"></span>[3](#fn_1713.md) this (is the person of
him who is king of kings, who) is the greatest (of men) of every
description <span id="fr_1756"></span>[4](#fn_1714.md), (that is, it
possesses <span id="fr_1757"></span>[3](#fn_1713.md) a person in the king
of kings ) *and* so it is taught *that* the creatures <span
id="fr_1758"></span>[5](#fn_1715.md) are for him, (where the Gâthic lore is
set going by him).

31\. Whatever is a good emanation for <span
id="fr_1759"></span>[3](#fn_1713.md) Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (that is, has an origin
in his personality,) is through *the word* vangh*e*u*s*, (which in the
division becomes the beginning of) the third assertion here, whose
recital is 'he gives through Vohûman,' (that is, the recitation which he
utters properly is accomplished by him,) and, besides, here is that
which

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vohûman has
taught, (that is, the reward and recompense which they give Vohûman,
they attribute also to him;) (32) whatever <span
id="fr_1760"></span>[1](#fn_1716.md) is a further indication by Vohûman,
(that is, anything which he may accomplish <span
id="fr_1761"></span>[1](#fn_1716.md) properly as a token, and is performed
by him,) became so through this summing up (that is, its end occurred)
in *sh*yaothananãm; (33) here among the existences was the summing
up <span id="fr_1762"></span>[2](#fn_1717), (that is, it was its end.md).

34\. What it teaches to the creatures <span
id="fr_1763"></span>[3](#fn_1718.md) of him who is Aûha*r*ma*zd*, is thus:
he *who is* like him is he who is his own creature <span
id="fr_1764"></span>[3](#fn_1718.md), (that is, even these people it tells
something so, *and* thus <span id="fr_1765"></span>[1](#fn_1716.md) they
attain again, through purity, to the possession of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, just
as Aûha*r*ma*zd* produced *them* through purity). 35. *By* 'the dominion
is for Aûha*r*ma*zd*' it has taught, that he has made Aûha*r*ma*zd* his
ruler <span id="fr_1766"></span>[4](#fn_1719.md), over his own person, (who
shall perform that which is revealed by the Avesta ) and this is taught,
*that* through him is the ministration of the poor, (that is, happiness
is thereby caused by him,) (36) which is friendship *for* the Spîtâmân;
(and the religion of the Spîtâmân became) *these* five assertions, (that
is, the decrees in it were five,) (37) *which* were the

<span id="page_459">p. 459</span>

whole enunciation of the saying, *and* the whole saying was that of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_1767"></span>[1](#fn_1720.md).

38\. For the sake of development Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (for cherishing the
creatures,) pronounced the Ahunavair, and in its development *there* was
a summing up, (that is, its end occurred). 39. Quickly, when <span
id="fr_1768"></span>[2](#fn_1721.md) destruction arose, (that is <span
id="fr_1769"></span>[3](#fn_1722), the destroyer,.md) *and* rushed in, even
among the wicked he uttered (as resistance) (40) this interdict:—(41)
'Neither our thoughts, nor <span id="fr_1770"></span>[3](#fn_1722.md)
teachings, (*as* I have not taught that which thou hast taught,) nor
wisdoms, (for I consider wisdom as virtuousness, and thou considerest
*it* as viciousness,) (42) nor wills, (for my will is a virtuous wish,
and thine a vicious *one*,) nor words, (for I speak that which is
virtuous, and thou speakest that which is vicious) nor actions, (for my
actions are virtuous, and thine are vicious,) (43) nor religions, (for
my religion is the Gâthic lore, and thine is witchcraft,) nor souls are
themselves in unison, (for *as to* those who rely upon my things, and
those who rely upon thy things, their souls are not in one place;' he
who said this, that even their souls exist, must thus say that *they
are* not souls in unison *with* ours).

44\. Also this saying, which Aûha*r*ma*zd* uttered, *has* the three
degrees, the four classes, (priest, warrior, husbandman, and artisan)
the five chieftainships, (house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler,
province-ruler,

<span id="page_460">p. 460</span>

and supreme Zaratû*s*t,) and its summing up is with liberality, (thus it
is possible to make *it* completely for their own, when they deliver
themselves up to the priests). 45. Which are the degrees of it? Good
thoughts, good words, and good deeds; (they are <span
id="fr_1771"></span>[1](#fn_1723.md), indeed, virtuous among the degrees of
religion). 46. Which are the classes? The priest, warrior, husbandman,
and artisan, (47) who are the whole day *and* night with a righteous
man, who are thinking rightly, speaking rightly, and acting rightly,
(48) who *have* recognised a priestly authority, (that is, possess a
high-priest,) who *have* taught the religion, (that is, have provided a
ceremony,) (49) *and* who, through their actions, are a furtherance of
the world of righteousness, (owing to the work they accomplish). 50.
Which are the chiefs? The house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler,
province-ruler, and the Zaratû*s*t is the fifth (51) *in* those
provinces which are other than the Ragha <span
id="fr_1772"></span>[2](#fn_1724.md) of Zaratû*s*t; *with* four
chieftainships is the Ragha of Zaratû*s*t. 52. Which are the chiefs of
that? The house-ruler, village-ruler, tribe-ruler, and the Zaratû*s*t is
the fourth; (that is, when he was in his own province, he also produced
its period *of prosperity*, who arises fourth).

53\. How *was it* when through good thought, (that is, the religion
remained in the degree of good thought)? When it arose first in a
righteous thinker, (it arose in Gâyômar*d*, and he thought for it). 54.
How, when through good words? When *it was* the bounteous text, (doing
good). 55. How,

<span id="page_461">p. 461</span>

when through good deeds? When *it was* the praise even of righteousness
*by* the first creature, (that is, they shall perform the ceremonial,
and also other good works, through the Gâtha lore).

56\. Aûha*r*ma*zd* proclaimed; for what *was it* proclaimed by him? For
the righteous spiritual and worldly *existence*, (*for* the benefit of
the spiritual and worldly *existence*). 57. Owing to what desire (owing
to what necessity) *was* the said announcement proclaimed <span
id="fr_1773"></span>[1](#fn_1725) by him? (So that he shall become.md) the
privileged developer, (he who is a resolute ruler). 58. For how many
righteous (is it requisite to utter it)? (So that *one may* become) a
developer, (even he who may be) an irresolute ruler <span
id="fr_1774"></span>[2](#fn_1726.md), (to whom they reveal these words. So
that the glory of the Kayâns, such as *it is* with good rulers, should
be even so with evil rulers; with good rulers for this purpose, that so
they shall produce more benefit; and with evil rulers for this purpose,
that so they shall produce less harm) <span
id="fr_1775"></span>[3](#fn_1727.md).

#### Pahl. Yas. XX = Bakŏ II.

The beginning of the second subdivision <span
id="fr_1776"></span>[4](#fn_1728.md).

1\. It was a proclamation of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the Ashem vohû vahi*s*tem
astî <span id="fr_1777"></span>[5](#fn_1729.md); besides perfect excellence
is taught by it to him, (that is, benefit is

<span id="page_462">p. 462</span>

produced by it for him,) who shall make self-progress his own, (that is,
shall produce that which is necessary to produce,) through vohû
vahi*s*tem astî <span id="fr_1778"></span>[1](#fn_1730.md), thus become the
summing up of the assertion, (that is, it became its end). 2. U*s*tâ
astî, u*s*tâ ahmâi <span id="fr_1779"></span>[2](#fn_1731.md) has, besides,
taught the righteous of every kind the happy progress which is necessary
to arise for the righteous of every kind, (so that <span
id="fr_1780"></span>[3](#fn_1732) happiness *may* be caused thereby.md);
whatever endurance of man (*or* diligence) it is necessary for the
righteous of every kind to occasion is, besides, taught to the righteous
of <span id="fr_1781"></span>[4](#fn_1733.md) every kind, (so that one's
happiness *may* be caused thereby). 3. Hya*d* ashâi vahi*s*tâi
ashem <span id="fr_1782"></span>[2](#fn_1731.md) has, besides, taught
*that* all (the duty and good works which are revealed in the text are
the whole text (for him whose Avesta and Zand are easy, so that, through
*its* Avesta and Zand, he can make manifest all the duty and good works
of that whole text) (4) which teaches <span
id="fr_1783"></span>[5](#fn_1734.md) *that* the dominion is for
righteousness <span id="fr_1784"></span>[6](#fn_1735.md), (so that, *one*
may exercise authority through virtuousness, that is, it should be the
opinion that it teaches a dominion through virtuousness, so that *one
may* possess authority through virtuousness ) (5) which also teaches the
truth to that righteous invoker, (so that he may make a true decision;)
(6) *and* which also teaches the truth to you that are

<span id="page_463">p. 463</span>

fraught with advantage, (so that it may produce true judgment). *These*
were the three assertions, (that is, three decrees were in it,) (7)
*and* the whole saying was a proclamation, the whole saying was that of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

8\. Aûha*r*ma*zd* proclaimed; (*&c., as in Pahl. Yas. XIX*, 56-58).

#### Pahl. Yas. XXI = Bakŏ III.

#### The beginning of the third subdivision <span id="fr_1785"></span>[1](#fn_1736.md).

1\. A saying of the righteous Zaratû*s*t, to be reverenced, was:
'Whoever of those existing is thus in worship as regards *the
good* <span id="fr_1786"></span>[2](#fn_1737.md)': Here what is taught by
it is the worship of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (that *it is* that which *one*
should provide for,) which is the law of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, (that is, his
virtuous law,) whereby the reverence *of* existence is taught, (that is,
that which he would most occasion, which is the ever-asking for progeny
*by* mankind; and he mentions that thing to them,) *through* which *it*
is possible for them to live well. 2. Here, besides, the reverence of
those males *and* females of the righteous, through complete
devotion <span id="fr_1787"></span>[3](#fn_1738.md) who *was* the first, is
taught by it, (3) which is the obeisance *for* the archangels, (that is,
it would occasion the propitiation of the archangels). *These* were the
three assertions, (that is, three decrees were in it,) *and* it was *in*
every way a saying to be reverenced. *Unto* whom was the reverence? Unto
the archangels in that worship.

4\. And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: 'Happy is he

<span id="page_464">p. 464</span>

whose happiness is the happiness of any one whatever, (5) and *may*
Aûha*r*ma*zd* grant it, through predominance of will, (through his
requirement) <span id="fr_1788"></span>[1](#fn_1739.md).' 6. What reply did
he speak through that utterance of words, (what *was* the thing he spoke
about <span id="fr_1789"></span>[2](#fn_1740).md)? 7. He spoke the reply of
happy progress, the happy progress of the righteous of every kind, who
are, who have been, and who *will* arise. 8. The developer told (that
man, as) the development, *in* reply; *and* (the reward as) the
development that Aûha*r*ma*zd* mentioned *in* reply *was*: 'That
development <span id="fr_1790"></span>[3](#fn_1741) (I call.md) righteous,
(which) is a development for the righteous.'

 

Dk. IX, Chap. XLVII, 11, refers to Pahl. Yas. XIX, 12-15, which is thus
quoted in Sls. X, 26, in a shorter and altered form:—'As it says in the
Bak thus: "Whoever shall mutter, *O* Zaratû*s*t! my apportionment of the
Ahunavair, (that is, shall softly take *it inwardly*) *and* shall let
*it* escape <span id="fr_1791"></span>[4](#fn_1742.md) again, (that is,
shall utter *it aloud*) so much as a half, or a third, or a fourth, or a
fifth, his soul will I shield <span id="fr_1792"></span>[5](#fn_1743.md), I
who am Aûha*r*ma*zd*, from the best existence, (that is, I *will* keep
it away,) by such an extent as the width of this earth."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1693"></span>[453:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1734.md) As the detailed
account of the first three fargar*d*s of this Nask, in Dk. IX, contains
about 840 Pahlavi words, and represents about 730 words of the original
Avesta text in Yas. XIX—XXI, with 1630 in its Pahlavi version, it may be
assumed that the detailed account of the whole Nask, extending to nearly
11,000 words, indicates about 9,500 words of Avesta text and 21,200 of
Pahlavi version as the total extent of this Nask.

<span id="fn_1694"></span>[453:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1735.md) The heading of
this first hâ is given in 32, Pt4, Mf4 which have been consulted by the
translator in addition to Spiegel's text representing K5. The division
into sections is that adopted by Spiegel, and the passages in
parentheses have no equivalents in the Avesta text.

<span id="fn_1695"></span>[453:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1736.md) Sp., J2 insert
'good *and*.'

<span id="fn_1696"></span>[453:4](sbe37132.htm#fr_1737.md) J2 adds '(this
is, Aûha*r*ma*zd* the creator is righteous; the rest is through the
praise which says the creator is righteous);' compare Pahl. Vend. II, 1.

<span id="fn_1697"></span>[454:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1738.md) Assuming that
the khr*a*fstar*d*ŏ, or khr*a*fôstar*d*ŏ, of Pt4, Mf4, stands for
khrafstarânŏ, as required by the Avesta text. Sp., J2 have 'who were
confounded by wisdom.'

<span id="fn_1698"></span>[454:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1739.md) So in Pt4, Mf4;
but Sp., J2 may mean 'he strictly does not speak out in the middle of
its Avesta.'

<span id="fn_1699"></span>[454:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1740.md) All the MSS.
have 'while talking, *or* without anxiety,' as in § 8; but this does not
correspond with the Avesta text. The repetition of the parenthetical
clause, about the ceremonial, which also occurs in § 8, is likewise
suspicious.

<span id="fn_1700"></span>[455:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1741.md) Pt4, Mf4 vâvar;
Sp., J2 have va-aêvar, 'and certainly.'

<span id="fn_1701"></span>[455:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1743.md) So in Pt4, Mf4;
Sp., J2 have 'I would,' which may be right.

<span id="fn_1702"></span>[455:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1744.md) Pt4, Mf4
aparôdînê*d*; Sp., J2 have ba*r*â âpahlûkinê*d*, 'puts quite aside.'

<span id="fn_1703"></span>[455:4](sbe37132.htm#fr_1745.md) Pahl. ba*r*â
yangê*d* (Pers. yan*g*ad).

<span id="fn_1704"></span>[455:5](sbe37132.htm#fr_1746.md) Only in J2.

<span id="fn_1705"></span>[455:6](sbe37132.htm#fr_1747.md) See Dk. VIII,
Chap. XX, 65.

<span id="fn_1706"></span>[455:7](sbe37132.htm#fr_1748.md) Pahl. tanôm
(Pers. tanam).

<span id="fn_1707"></span>[456:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1749.md) J2 omits gûftŏ,
'*what was* said.'

<span id="fn_1708"></span>[456:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1750.md) Pahl. avŏ kevan
in Pt4.

<span id="fn_1709"></span>[456:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1751.md) '*Or* is spoken
forth' in Pt4, Mf4.

<span id="fn_1710"></span>[456:4](sbe37132.htm#fr_1752.md) 'Have learnt
that which they should have learnt' in Pt4, Mf4.

<span id="fn_1711"></span>[457:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1753.md) J2 has 'given.'

<span id="fn_1712"></span>[457:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1754.md) Pt4, Mf4 insert
'very.'

<span id="fn_1713"></span>[457:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1759.md) So in J2, Pt4,
Mf4.

<span id="fn_1714"></span>[457:4](sbe37132.htm#fr_1756.md) Pt4, Mf4, 'the
greatest of all men.'

<span id="fn_1715"></span>[457:5](sbe37132.htm#fr_1758.md) See [p.
458](#page_458), n. [3](#fn_1718.md).

<span id="fn_1716"></span>[458:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1765.md) So in J2, Pt4,
Mf4.

<span id="fn_1717"></span>[458:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1762.md) Sp., J2 add 'of
the sacred beings.'

<span id="fn_1718"></span>[458:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1764.md) Only here, and
in § 30, dâhm, 'a member of the community,' is substituted for the usual
dâm, 'a creature.' Either meaning might suit the context, but the Avesta
text clearly has 'creature,' and would require more alteration, to suit
it to the Pahlavi version, than *vice versa*. Dk. IX, Chap. XLVII,
affords no assistance, as it does not allude to this passage.

<span id="fn_1719"></span>[458:4](sbe37132.htm#fr_1766.md) The Pahlavi
version of the Av. ta*d* mazdâ tavâ khshathrem quoted in Dk. IX, Chap.
XLVII, 17.

<span id="fn_1720"></span>[459:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1767.md) As the Pahlavi
text of the foregoing interpretation is a commentary upon an Avesta
commentary on an obscure Avesta text, it must be expected to be
difficult to translate with certainty.

<span id="fn_1721"></span>[459:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1768.md) Pt4, Mf4 omit
'when;' but the speaker of the interdict is Aûha*r*ma*zd* in Pahl. Yas.
XLIV, 2 c-e.

<span id="fn_1722"></span>[459:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1770.md) So in J2, Pt4,
Mf4.

<span id="fn_1723"></span>[460:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1771.md) J2, Pt4, Mf4
indicate hômant (= aît).

<span id="fn_1724"></span>[460:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1772.md) The ancient city
of Raî which stood not far from Teheran.

<span id="fn_1725"></span>[461:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1773.md) Pt4, Mf4 have
f*râz* gûftŏ, as in Pahl. Yas. XX, 9.

<span id="fn_1726"></span>[461:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1774.md) Quoted in Dk.
IX, Chap. LXIX, 45.

<span id="fn_1727"></span>[461:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1775.md) §§ 56-58 are
repeated at the end of Pahl. Yas. XX, with reference to the Ashem.

<span id="fn_1728"></span>[461:4](sbe37132.htm#fr_1776.md) So in Pt4, Mf4.

<span id="fn_1729"></span>[461:5](sbe37132.htm#fr_1777.md) This Avesta is
quoted as part of the Pahlavi version, and is translated, in Pt4, Mf4,
by the usual Pahlavi for 'righteousness is perfect excellence.'

<span id="fn_1730"></span>[462:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1778.md) So in Pt4, Mf4;
J2 has 'through one vohû vahi*s*tem; and vahi*s*tem astî.'

<span id="fn_1731"></span>[462:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1782.md) This phrase of
the Ashem, which begins the Avesta of this section, must also be
understood as beginning its Pahlavi version.

<span id="fn_1732"></span>[462:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1780.md) Only Sp. adds
'one's' here.

<span id="fn_1733"></span>[462:4](sbe37132.htm#fr_1781.md) Only Sp. has
'the righteous of,' but it is in the Avesta text.

<span id="fn_1734"></span>[462:5](sbe37132.htm#fr_1783.md) So in Pt4, Mf4.

<span id="fn_1735"></span>[462:6](sbe37132.htm#fr_1784.md) Just as the
Ahunavair states that 'the dominion is for Aûha*r*ma*zd*' (see Pahl.
Yas. XIX, 35).

<span id="fn_1736"></span>[463:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1785.md) So in Pt4, Mf4.

<span id="fn_1737"></span>[463:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1786.md) The beginning of
the YêNhê-hâtãm (see Dk. IX, Chap. IV, 1 n).

<span id="fn_1738"></span>[463:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1787.md) The archangel
Ârmaiti, or Spenda*r*ma*d*.

<span id="fn_1739"></span>[464:1](sbe37132.htm#fr_1788.md) Quoted from
Pahl. Yas. XLII, 1 a, b.

<span id="fn_1740"></span>[464:2](sbe37132.htm#fr_1789.md) Pt4, Mf4 have
madam in place of maman.

<span id="fn_1741"></span>[464:3](sbe37132.htm#fr_1790.md) So in Pt4, Mf4.

<span id="fn_1742"></span>[464:4](sbe37132.htm#fr_1791.md) Pahl.
rahôînê*d*, or rânînê*d*, 'reject.' It is the alteration in this verb
that changes the meaning of the original text; as the preceding and
following verbs, vakhdûnê*d* and gôyê*d*, do not differ in Pahlavi
writing from the vadîdûnê*d* and yangê*d* of Pahl. Yas. XIX, 12.

<span id="fn_1743"></span>[464:5](sbe37132.htm#fr_1792.md) Pahl. netrûnam.
