### CHAPTER XV.

1\. The Bakân-ya*s*t <span id="fr_128"></span>[3](#fn_127) *contains*
particulars, first, about the worship of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the highest of
divinities (bakân), and, secondly, *of* the worship of the angels of
other invisible and visible worldly existences, out of whom are likewise
the names of

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

the days <span id="fr_129"></span>[1](#fn_128); *also* their glory,
power, triumph, *and* marvellousness. 2. Besides, also, many angels who
are invoked by name in their worship, and the attention *and* obeisance
*due* to them.

3\. The worthiness *and* dispensation of favour for worshippers, *and*
the duty of their many separate recitations unto the angels. 4. The duty
of unlimited acquaintance *with* knowledge about the possessions *and*
arrangements of the period, over which the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* *has*
appointed them, and they remain to cause industry.

5\. Perfect is the excellence *of* righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_127"></span>[34:3](sbe37018.htm#fr_128) Corresponding to
the fourteenth word, mazdâi, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.;
but it is the fifteenth Nask in other Rivâyats. Bakân-ya*s*t means
'worship of the divinities,' and is written Baghân-ya*s*t, or
Bayân-ya*s*t, in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained
seventeen kardah, or subdivisions.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[35:1](sbe37018.htm#fr_129) Each of the days of
the Parsi month being named after some particular angel, or spirit. From
this description it appears probable that the Ya*s*ts formed a part of
this Nask; but, if so, it ought to have contained at least thirty
chapters.
