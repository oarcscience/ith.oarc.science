<p>In the name and <I>for</I> the propitiation of the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> these several commentaries (zand) are published from revelation (d&ecirc;n&ocirc;).</p>  
<p align="center">The names of the twenty-one Nasks.</p>  
<p>1. One is this that is Yath&acirc;, that is, the St&ocirc;<I>d</I>-ya<I>s</I>t, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of this St&ocirc;<I>d</I>-ya<I>s</I>t are thirty-three. In that Nask are the blessing <I>and</I> propitiation of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> and the archangels, and they are <I>for</I> the utterance of praise. A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> sends this Nask into the world, which is suitable for every one, <I>and</I> whoever has committed this Nask to memory recites <I>it</I>. And to every one who, being-a high-priest, becomes a reciter of both the Avesta and Zand, <I>and</I> shall recite that Nask three times with correctness, the archangels will come near; as to this they know <I>it</I> without doubt.</p>  
<p>2. The second Nask is that <I>which is</I> Ah&ucirc;, the St&ucirc;<I>d</I>gar, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of that Nask are</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_439"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 439</FONT></A></p>  
<p>twenty-two. In it are the giving of advice <I>to</I> mankind, the performance of prayer and virtue, the doing of good actions, intercession, producing union among relations, <I>and</I> such-like topics.</p>  
<p>3. The third is Vairy&ocirc;, the Vahi<I>s</I>t-m&acirc;nsar, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of this Nask are twenty-two. In this is the topic of those who are becoming without doubt as to the religion of Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship, causing heedfulness, and thinking about the religion; also the production of the benediction and attributes (s<I>i</I>f&acirc;t) of the blessedness of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, every action which was declared virtuous before Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, and all actions which have to occur after Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t until the future existence; the benefit of his world, and such-like topics.</p>  
<p>4. The fourth Nask is this <I>which is</I> Ath&acirc;, the Bagh, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of that Nask are twenty-one. In this the topic is this which is the purpose of the religion of Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship, and the ideas which A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> caused <I>to be</I> taught unto mankind; the exercise of reverence, heedfulness, adjudication, and justice; the performance of the proper duty of decision, doing good actions (k&acirc;r-&icirc; khva&icirc;r), closing the way of Aharman into oneself, attaining unto the spiritual <I>existence</I> for oneself, <I>and</I> such as are like <I>these</I>.</p>  
<p>5. The fifth Nask is Ratu<I>s</I>, the Dv&acirc;zdak-h&ocirc;m&acirc;st, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of that Nask are thirty-two. In that Nask are all the topics of the spiritual <I>existence and</I> the heavenly state, virtue and vileness, the material <I>existence</I> of this worldly state, about the sky and about the earth, and everything which A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> produced <I>and which</I> exists in the water, fire, and plants; human beings and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_440"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 440</FONT></A></p>  
<p>quadrupeds, grazing animals and birds, and everything which is similarly produced from any (<I>a</I><I>&ecirc;</I><I>k</I>) <I>of them</I>, and the characteristics of all things. Secondly, that which is the production of the resurrection and future existence, and the coming together and separation <I>at</I> the <I>K</I>inva<I>d</I> pass; the recompense for the doers of good works and the punishment for sinners occur through the future existence, <I>and</I> such-like topics as <I>these</I> are.</p>  
<p>6. The sixth Nask is Ash&acirc;<I>d</I>, the N&acirc;d&ucirc;r, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of that are thirty-five. In this Nask are the purposes of the stars (nu<I>g</I>&ucirc;m), the zodiac, and the planets, the goodness and evil of each constellation, and the movement of all the planets in the signs of the zodiac (b&ucirc;r<I>g</I>) and lunar mansions (mah&icirc;g&acirc;n nu<I>g</I>&ucirc;m). They have translated <I>it</I> into Arabic and Persian, and the name they have adopted <I>for</I> this book is B&ucirc;t&acirc;l, <I>and</I> in Persian the name which is appointed for it is Kap&acirc;m<I>&acirc;</I><I>g</I>&acirc;n.</p>  
<p>7. The seventh is this <I>which is</I> <I>K</I>&icirc;<I>d</I>, <I>and</I> is the P<I>&acirc;</I><I>g</I>am, and its subdivisions are twenty-two. In this P<I>&acirc;</I><I>g</I>am Nask is the topic of the slaughtering of quadrupeds <I>and</I> sheep, how <I>they</I> are to be slaughtered, of which among the quadrupeds the command is that it is allowable to eat, and of which kind the eating is not allowable; how <I>he</I> who slaughters shall strike at the time of the expiring of the sheep. The more expenditure (saraf) <I>one</I> makes upon a season-festival, so much the more is the reward; how much it is expedient to bestow upon the Dast&ucirc;rs, M&ocirc;bads, and H&ecirc;rbads, and upon the unwavering practisers of good works <I>in</I> the good religion; what merit accrues <I>to</I> every one</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_441"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 441</FONT></A></p>  
<p>who celebrates a season-festival and consecrates clothing for a soul, <I>and</I> who, <I>for</I> that reason, is in the supreme heaven <I>in</I> the last times; and it is necessary to give clothing to relations <I>and</I> the righteous as a righteous gift, <I>and</I> to exercise mediation on the part of the righteous; the five greater and lesser days of the guardian spirits, and the practice of good works on <I>these</I> ten days is enjoined in this Nask. It is requisite for all people that they shall read this book with good and wise understanding, that all <I>may</I> become aware of its topics.</p>  
<p>8. The eighth Nask is that <I>which is</I> Ha<I>k</I>&acirc;, the Ratu<I>s</I>t&acirc;&icirc;h, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of that Nask <I>were</I> fifty when the accursed Alexander had the Nasks burnt up, <I>but</I> after that, <I>as</I> they sought out this Nask, <I>only</I> thirteen of those subdivisions came to hand, and no <I>more</I> remained of those previously <I>existing</I>. In this Nask are the reasons of performing service, giving orders, and remaining at the command of kings and at the command of high-priests and judges; the adornment-preserving&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1728"></A><A HREF="#fn_1687"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> purpose of cities is declared, the command of religion, and things made magnificently (a<I>g</I><I>&icirc;</I><I>z</I>&icirc;h&acirc;), grazing animals, birds, cattle, and fish; everything which is a production of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> <I>or</I> Aharman; all the purposes of all the seas, mountains, and lands; <I>and matter</I> similar <I>to</I> such as are mentioned.</p>  
<p>9. The ninth Nask is this <I>which is</I> Vangh<I>e</I>u<I>s</I>, <I>and</I> is the Bari<I>s</I>; the subdivisions of that Nask were first sixty, <I>but</I> after the accursed Alexander <I>only</I> twelve remained. <I>As to</I> the information in this Nask, just as there is the sovereignty for <I>those</I></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_442"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 442</FONT></A></p>  
<p>who are kings, so <I>there</I> is the usage which it is necessary <I>for them</I> to practise, and the command of the sentence of judges of the religion such as is necessary to be executed; the custody and protection for the world, and making each new city flourishing; also the reasons of people, who are false-speaking, sinners, <I>and</I> such-like, are mentioned in this Nask.</p>  
<p>10. The tenth Nask is that <I>which is</I> Dazd&acirc;, the Ka<I>s</I>sr&ocirc;b, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of that Nask were formerly sixty, <I>but</I> after the accursed Alexander <I>only</I> fifteen subdivisions remained. In that Nask the topic is that which is wisdom and knowledge, the reason of <I>its</I> being brought forth from the mother, and the teaching of wisdom <I>by</I> demonstration, the performance of purification and the speaking of truth; bringing people from vileness unto virtue, and bringing <I>them</I> from defilement and pollution unto purity; greatness and good progeny arise for people near kings, and how the habit of people telling lies, to others and to kings, arises; <I>and</I> such-like as <I>these</I>.</p>  
<p>11. The eleventh Nask was Manangh&ocirc;, the V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp&acirc;<I>d</I>, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of that Nask were sixty, <I>but</I> after the accursed Alexander <I>only</I> ten remained. In this Nask is the topic of the sovereignty of G&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, and Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;m&acirc;n, <I>having</I> brought the religion from A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, king Gu<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp accepted <I>it</I>, and made <I>it</I> current in the world; <I>and</I> such-like as <I>these</I>.</p>  
<p>12. The twelfth is <I>S</I><I>h</I>yaothanan&atilde;m, the Kh&ucirc;st, <I>and</I> the subdivisions of that Nask were first twenty-two, <I>but</I> after the accursed Alexander <I>only</I> six remained. Among those six, which are the first</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_443"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 443</FONT></A></p>  
<p>portions (zizp = Ar. <I>g</I>izb), the topics in <I>one</I> portion are the attributes (sif&acirc;t) of the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and the understanding <I>of them;</I> also being without doubt about the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, the Sp&icirc;t&acirc;m&acirc;n, all the duty and good works which are prescribed in the religion, <I>and</I> such-like. In the second portion is the reason of service for kings, the truth of the religion, submission <I>to</I> all <I>its</I> commands, and withholding <I>one's</I> hand from evil actions, so that it <I>has</I> become far from mischief. In the third portion is that which is the debt for performers of virtuous position, the advantage <I>of</I> good works, the final release from hell, <I>and</I> such-like. The fourth is the reason of the creation of the world, the practice of agriculture, the cultivation of trees, the date-tree and every fruit-tree; whence arises most strength for people and animals; being under the command of the practisers of good works <I>and</I> the virtuous, and being under the command of the high-priests, <I>and</I> such-like as they are. In the fifth portion all the specimens of mankind are mentioned: <I>they</I> who are of great knowledge, who are kings, judges, and the sages of the religion; in the second specimen are <I>they</I> that <I>have</I> to keep watch <I>over</I> all the cities, and to make the enemy confounded; in the third specimen are these whose object <I>one</I> mentions <I>in the term</I> 'husbandmen;' the fourth specimen which <I>one</I> mentions <I>are</I> these who are the greatly-skilled and sitters in the market, grandiloquent to repel loss, giving one-tenth to the high-priest and king, and offering praise on hardened knees, the last reward of which is that <I>one</I> obtains in the spiritual <I>existence</I>.</p>  
<p>13. The thirteenth Nask is that which is Angh<I>e</I>u<I>s</I>,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_444"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 444</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Spend; its subdivisions are sixty which are precious unto people of pedigrees (m&acirc;yag&acirc;n) and <I>those who</I> possess much avidity for virtuous actions and <I>have</I> to proceed <I>in</I> the footsteps (p&acirc;&icirc;-rap&icirc;h) <I>of</I> the great and religious; <I>also</I> accounts of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, who is born from the womb of D&ucirc;ghd<I>&acirc;</I><I>v</I>&#335;, till ten years <I>of age</I>. Every Dast&ucirc;r and M&ocirc;bad shall recite this Nask in purity, and with ease and the proper words, <I>for</I> several days, and shall obtain every desire of his own, or <I>any</I> wish which he claims on account of (ba<I>r</I>&acirc; r&acirc;&icirc;-&icirc;) others.</p>  
<p>14. The fourteenth Nask is that <I>which is</I> Mazd&acirc;i; the name Zira<I>s</I>t is appointed <I>for it, and</I> the subdivisions of that Nask are twenty-two. In like manner this Nask is sent <I>by</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, which is to make manifest to the people what is the purpose <I>of</I> that science through which mankind are born from the womb of a mother, how many individuals among them will die <I>away</I> from the womb, and how many individuals will live; how many persons <I>and</I> people among them become kings, and how many, meanwhile (f&icirc;m&acirc;), exercise apostleship, that is, the high-priesthood; how many are the grandest of people, and how many are the meanest <I>of</I> mankind, <I>and</I> in what mode this occurs; from first to last, the time people are born and all those topics are in this Nask.</p>  
<p>15. The fifteenth is Khshathrem<I>k</I>&acirc;, <I>and</I> the name of that Nask is Bagh&acirc;n-ya<I>s</I>t, <I>and</I> its subdivisions are seventeen. In it are the topics of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> the lord and the archangels, the knowledge of their attributes, and the service <I>and</I> sublimity <I>of</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; at what time every G&acirc;h occurs until the future existence, and what duty is</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_445"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 445</FONT></A></p>  
<p>performed; offering praise <I>for</I> every benefit <I>from</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and obtaining benefit from him; the appearance of the archangels, and knowing what is such-and-such an appearance of such-and-such an archangel in the future existence. This Nask used in the service of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> and the archangels is very excellent.</p>  
<p>16. The sixteenth is Ahur&acirc;i, <I>and</I> they have appointed it the name Niy&acirc;r&acirc;m; the subdivisions of that Nask are fifty-four, about the reason of preserving wealth and placing <I>it</I> out, agreement <I>and</I> measure <I>by</I> the cubit <I>and</I> handful; everything the creator A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> has ordained <I>as</I> uncontaminated, release from hell, and how to walk in the path of reverence and worship; what is in the mind of man, and what is everything in the body of man; <I>and</I> such-like as <I>these that</I> are mentioned.</p>  
<p>17. The seventeenth Nask is that which is &Acirc;, <I>and</I> the name they have appointed <I>for</I> it is Asp&acirc;r&ucirc;m; one mentions sixty-five subdivisions of it, <I>and</I> in this Nask is every religious topic which all persons well understand, and the punishment suffered <I>by</I> sinners, which they receive in <I>their</I> last career; everything which is uncontaminated is allowable, <I>and what</I> is not uncontaminated is not allowable; the stars preside over the destiny of mankind; and such-like as <I>these</I>.</p>  
<p>18. The eighteenth Nask is that <I>which is</I> Yim, that <I>has</I> the name Duv&acirc;sar&ocirc;zad appointed <I>for it</I>, and the subdivisions of it are likewise sixty-five. In this Nask are the reasons of next-of-kin marriage, forming connections among relations, and such-like as <I>these</I>.</p>  
<p>19. The nineteenth Nask is Driguby&ocirc;, the name</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_446"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 446</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of which is Ask&acirc;ram, <I>and</I> is of fifty-two stanzas (v<I>&ecirc;</I><I>k</I>astih&acirc;), <I>about</I> the giving of orders, exercise of authority, and practising wisdom in everything; producing the resurrection, <I>by</I> which every person passed <I>away</I> is made living again, and the malformations of Aharman and the demons are withered away; <I>and</I> such-like.</p>  
<p>20. The twentieth Nask is that <I>which is</I> Dada<I>d</I>, that they call <I>by</I> its name of Vend&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I>, where the meaning <I>of</I> this is 'the law against the demons,' which is of twenty-two fargar<I>d</I>s. The topic <I>of</I> it is what preserves mankind from evil <I>and</I> pollution, and will restrain <I>them</I> from the menstruous, dead matter, pestilence, and running sores. Of all the twenty-one Nasks the Nask of 'the law against the demons' has <I>alone</I> remained entire; while several remain scattered by the wickedness (<I>s</I>&ucirc;m&icirc;h) of the accursed Alexander, this Nask of the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I> remained in hand, <I>and</I> owing to its elucidation the religion of Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship exists now.</p>  
<p>21. The twenty-first Nask is V&acirc;st&acirc;rem, whose name <I>one</I> calls H&acirc;d&ocirc;kht, <I>and its</I> fargar<I>d</I>s are said <I>to be</I> thirty. In it are much excellence and many miracles, and the vile Aharman becomes far from every one who recites this H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht, and it makes <I>him</I> extinct, and <I>the reciter</I> comes near <I>unto</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> and becomes purified from sin.</p>  
<p>22. Now, alas! if all these Nasks do not remain, so that <I>one</I> is not able to solemnize <I>them</I>, that is for this reason, that the accursed Alexander, the Ar&ucirc;man, took several transcripts&#151;in the Ar&ucirc;man language and characters (hur&ucirc;f&#335;)&#151;of any among those twenty-one Nasks which were <I>about</I> the stars and medicine, and burnt up the other Nasks; and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_447"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 447</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the soul of the accursed Alexander, the R&ucirc;man, will remain wretched and burnt in gloomy hell till the resurrection, owing to his own vileness which injured the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t.</p>  
<p>23. After the villany of Alexander, an assemblage of several high-priests, who were sages of the religion, brought the Avesta of all <I>of them</I> from various places, <I>and</I> made a collection of so much Avesta and Zand <I>as</I> the sacred (ya<I>s</I>t&ocirc;) Yasna, V&icirc;spera<I>d</I>, Vend&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I>, Ar<I>d</I>&acirc;-fravar<I>d</I>, and other scraps of the Avesta, the Dar&ucirc;n, <I>A</I>f<I>r&icirc;</I>ng&acirc;n, and the Commands of the religion; all these <I>were</I> written, and the B&ucirc;ndahi<I>s</I> book <I>was</I> correctly written; <I>and</I> all such, among them, as <I>were</I> not written, which did not come into the thoughts of the sages, departed, on that account, from the midst of the many topics of revelation.</p>  
<p>24. Just as it is said that <I>there</I> were twenty-one Nasks, there are first, in seven Nasks, the topics of the religion <I>of</I> Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship, in the second seven Nasks are the topics of medical practice, <I>and</I> in the third seven Nasks the topics and capabilities of the stars are mentioned.</p>
