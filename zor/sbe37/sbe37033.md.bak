### CHAPTER XXX.

*Hûspâram Nask*.

1\. One section is the Gôharikistân ('*quality code*'), particulars
about natural superiority; not the modified (ga*s*takŏ), but the lawful,
approved <span id="fr_261"></span>[2](#fn_260.md), and specific *state* of
superiority; not acquired by the slender power <span
id="fr_262"></span>[3](#fn_261.md) of the world, but *by* seeking virtuous
living through causing the prosperity *of* every person; *also* the
authorisation of superiority, *and* the proportion of advantage therein.
2. About a superiority unimpoverished (anyûrûzd), with *one*
unimpoverished with a nature unspent (an-aûrûzd), with *one* unspent
with an impoverished (nyûrûzd), and *one* impoverished with an
impoverished; also the extent of impoverishment and non-impoverishment,
that is, with whom *it is* not customarily of much

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

consequence (pavan freh-ar’*g*ŏ), with whom *it is so* customarily,
*and* with whom, owing to an exception, *it is* not customarily of much
consequence on account of *its* much consequence for an uninformed
*person*, that is, with whom *it is* as *it were* proper with a servant
of sin. 3. And superiority is a furtherance of living beings, and
pervades the natural extent thereof.

4\. About him who would sell property not his own, *and* him who would
buy *it*. 5.. About selling a sheep frequenting the house, *and one* not
frequenting the house. 6. About various precautions *as to* samples of
various things. 7. About selling beasts *of burden*, cattle, slaves,
servants, *and* other property, of the nature of whose species *one is*
aware through speaking about the nature of different species; *and* the
retribution for the sin of whatever is on the same subject. 8. That
which is an obvious agreement for selling with defects <span
id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_262.md), when it is declared of beasts *of
burden;* and that which is ever defective on selling.

9\. About a house in which a person, *or* dog, *has* passed away through
contagious sickness, and the clothing which the man wore owing to that
sickness; that is, how it is when spoiled for selling *for* three
*years*, how it is when *it is so for* two *years, and* how it is *when
it is so for* one year. to About a house in which a person, or dog,
*has* reposed in a contagious sickness, *and* not passed *away* after
*his* descent therefrom; *and* the clothing which the man wore in that
sickness; that is, how it is when spoiled for selling *for* two *years*,
how it is when *it is so for* one year, and how it is when *it is so
for* thirty nights; *and* whatever is on the same subject.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

11\. About forming a family (gôharik ka*rd*anŏ) with foreigners, that
is, how it is when allowable. 12. About a sheep of *good* breed for the
three nights <span id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_263.md), *and its* slaughter
after the three nights; likewise many other decisions as regards
superiority and sheep of a *good* breed.
