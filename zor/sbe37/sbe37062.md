### CHAPTER XIII.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The twelfth fargar*d*, U*s*tavaiti <span
id="fr_591"></span>[2](#fn_586), is about the exaltation of Zaratû*s*t
through the satisfaction of water, and the hope of all creatures for
him. 2. And about the impure recitation of a text, when <span
id="fr_592"></span>[3](#fn_587) the text is not uttered by a
high-priest. 3. This, too, that the text which a man who is corrupted
may

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

offer is an impropriety (adînâîh) for that which is an uncorrupted
place. 4. This, too, is declared, that a greedy man whose belly is
filled by accumulation—and the end of every sin is, to him, only for the
gratification of the body—*one* considers just like a gallows to which
*there* is a foundation (*s*îpŏ) of every impurity. 5. This, too, that a
bird (vâê) practises that habit (*s*ân) even that it kills those
outright which have become large in *our* midst, which are the serpents
produced by the demons. 6. This, too, that *for* invocation
(azbâyi*s*nŏ) of the sacred beings thinking with speaking, speaking with
acting, and acting without deceitfulness are effectual.

7\. About the pure goodness of the archangels, and the union of their
thoughts, words, *and* deeds together; their bountifulness, nurturing,
and protection are the cause <span id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_588) of
the prosperity of the world. 8. About the production of Zaratû*s*t *by*
Aûha*r*ma*zd* with a goodness like his own. 9. This, too, that whoever
gives anything to the disciples of Zaratû*s*t, his reward and recompense
are just as though the thing had been given by him to Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_589).

10\. It is perfect excellence *that is* righteousness.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[195:2](sbe37062.htm#fr_591) The appellation of
the first hâ of the second Gâtha (Yas. XLIII) which begins with the
words u*s*tâ ahmâi yahmâi u*s*tâ; it is here written aû*s*tavâîtŏ in
Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[195:3](sbe37062.htm#fr_592) Assuming that mûn,
'which,' stands for amat; the Pâzand of both words being practically the
same. Or, it may be, 'also him who does not utter the text through a
high-priest.'

<span id="fn_588"></span>[196:1](sbe37062.htm#fr_593) B omits sân, 'the
cause of.'

<span id="fn_589"></span>[196:2](sbe37062.htm#fr_594) Compare:—'Inasmuch
as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have
done it unto me.' (Matthew XXV. 40.)
