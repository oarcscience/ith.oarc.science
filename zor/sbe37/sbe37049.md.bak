### CHAPTER XLVI.

1\. The Gâthas of the Ya*s*t <span id="fr_480"></span>[1](#fn_477.md), as
the first offspring of the Ahunavair, are a recitation of the source of
sources of the religion, and in the compass (parvastârîh) <span
id="fr_481"></span>[2](#fn_478) *of* the Gâthas, every word (mârîk.md)

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

in it is the origin of a word. 2. The word ahû <span
id="fr_482"></span>[1](#fn_479.md) of the beginning <span
id="fr_483"></span>[2](#fn_480.md) is of a like kind with ahyâ <span
id="fr_484"></span>[3](#fn_481.md), the beginning of the Gâthas; the end
word, which is vâstârem <span id="fr_485"></span>[4](#fn_482.md), is *of a
like kind* with vahyô <span id="fr_486"></span>[5](#fn_483.md), the end of
the Gâthas; and the whole—which, though *its* nature is *of* one kind,
is distributed (vakhtŏ) in *what is* selected therefrom—is stored up
(a*v*argû*d*ŏ) in *this* compendium <span
id="fr_487"></span>[6](#fn_484.md) of all parts of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping
religion.

3\. Likewise the purport (*av*orî-hastân) <span
id="fr_488"></span>[7](#fn_485) of its verse (gâh.md), and the particulars
of the primitive Vîspêra*d* <span id="fr_489"></span>[8](#fn_486.md) are to
procure homage and praise, oblation *and* invocation; *and* the
blessing <span id="fr_490"></span>[9](#fn_487.md), which is regulated by
the sagacity of the creator, is adapted for the spiritual illustration
of the lodgment of the ceremonial of the sacred beings therein. 4. All

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

three are provisions for the first *and* last presentations <span
id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_488.md) which *one* utters by means of the
Stô*d* Ya*s*t.

5\. It is perfect *is* the excellence of righteousness; it is perfect
excellence *that is* righteousness; with the copy revised (râyînî*d*ŏ).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_477"></span>[169:1](sbe37049.htm#fr_480.md) Corresponding to
the twenty-first word, vâstârem, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P.
Riv.; but it is the first Nask in other Rivâyats. In Chap. I, 9, 12 it
is called Stô*d*-ya*s*t, 'praise-ritual,' (Av. staota yêsnya); and
Stûd-ya*s*t, or Ya*s*t, in the Rivâyats, which also state that it
contains thirty-three kardah, or ʓûrat. In Sls. XIII, 1 we are told that
Vîsâi v*e*-ameshâ-spe*n*tâ (Yas. XIV, 1) is the beginning of the
Stôtân-yasnô; and, if we look for its end, we find Yas. LVIII, LIX both
ending with special reverence of 'the whole collection of the
Stôtân-yasnân.' We may therefore conclude that Yas. XIV-LIX, with its
supplementary passages in Vîsp. V-XXIV, contains the whole of the
Stô*d*-ya*s*t. But from this we must deduct Yas. XIX-XXI which are the
first three fargar*d*s of the Bakŏ Nask, Yas. LII which is an
interpolation, and Yas. LVI, LVII which are the Srôsh Ya*s*ts, lesser
and greater; we must also consider the Yasna Haptanghâiti as a single
section, in accordance with its treatment in Bk. IX, Chaps. XII, XXXV,
LVII; and much of the Vîspêra*d* may not belong to the primitive text
mentioned in § 3. Making these necessary deductions we have exactly
thirty-three has of the Yasna left for the Stô*d*-ya*s*t, as stated in
the Rivâyats.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[169:2](sbe37049.htm#fr_481.md) This word can also
be read fravistârîh (Av. fra + vid), 'interpretation,' or frôstârîh,
'handing down.'

<span id="fn_479"></span>[170:1](sbe37049.htm#fr_482.md) The Ahunavair
begins with the words yathâ ahû vairyô. The word ahû, in the MS., is
written ahî as usual in Irân.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[170:2](sbe37049.htm#fr_483.md) Assuming that
ba*r*â stands for bûn.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[170:3](sbe37049.htm#fr_484.md) The first Gâtha,
or sacred hymn, begins with the words ahyâ yâsâ nemanghâ (Yas. XXVIII, 1
a). There is, of course, no connection but that of sound between ahû, 'a
spiritual lord,' and ahyâ, 'of this;' nor is there any other between the
concluding words vâstârem, 'a protector,' and vahyô, 'better,' though
the phrases in which these latter occur are of a very similar character,
which fully justifies the comparison made in the text.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[170:4](sbe37049.htm#fr_485.md) The Ahunavair ends
with the words yim drigubyô dada*d* vâstârem.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[170:5](sbe37049.htm#fr_486.md) The last Gâtha
ends with the words yâ erezhe*g*yôi dâhî drigaovê vahyô (Yas. LIII, 9
d).

<span id="fn_484"></span>[170:6](sbe37049.htm#fr_487.md) The Gâthas
apparently.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[170:7](sbe37049.htm#fr_488.md) Or *av*ar-gâstân,
'disseminations.'

<span id="fn_486"></span>[170:8](sbe37049.htm#fr_489.md) The Vîspêra*d*
service consists of the Yasna ritual with certain additional passages
intermixed, which passages are called the Vîspêra*d* because the earlier
ones invoke 'all the chiefs' (vîspê ratavô, Visp. II, 3) of creation.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[170:9](sbe37049.htm#fr_490.md) Possibly Yas. LV.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[171:1](sbe37049.htm#fr_491.md) Probably referring
to Yas. XIV and LVIII.
