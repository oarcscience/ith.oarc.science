### CHAPTER LXIII.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The seventeenth fargar*d*, Yêzî <span
id="fr_1464"></span>[3](#fn_1431), is *that* whoever maintains the
benedictions of the religion <span id="fr_1465"></span>[4](#fn_1432),
and shall uphold its commands, has thereby made even others learn it;
even for this reason, because through this *it* is much more possible
for him to attract others to the religion; *and, as to* the origin and
means of attraction, the attraction is this, that he himself maintains
the benedictions of the religion, and the means of attraction are this,
that he is an upholder of the commands of the religion.

2\. This, too, that by him who shall perform the ritual of an ordeal
which is accomplished, the *K*inva*d*

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

passage <span id="fr_1466"></span>[1](#fn_1433) is made known; even for
this reason, because those even *who have* accomplished what is a work
of the spirit become witnesses, one about the other, as to the facts. 3.
This, too, that by him who shall perform that thing whereby a change
occurs from evil to good <span id="fr_1467"></span>[2](#fn_1434), even
that change which is the renovation *of the universe* is made known, by
means even of the evidence of a partial change as regards a perpetual
change.

4\. This, too, that by him who shall produce generosity for the
tillers <span id="fr_1468"></span>[3](#fn_1435) of the world it is then
developed; even for this reason, because they become more diligent *in*
tilling the world. 5. This, too, that by him who shall produce benefit
for the poor, a development <span id="fr_1469"></span>[4](#fn_1436) of
the world is produced for them; even for this reason, because through
that reason they increase more.

6\. This, too, that the creature-forming (dâmîh) of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[5](#fn_1437) is occasioned by him whose rule <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[6](#fn_1438) is for Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even for this
reason, because he becomes a holder and attendant of good works. 7.
This, too, that the devastation by Vohûman <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[7](#fn_1439) is taught *by* him whose rule is for
Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even for this reason, because he smites sinners *and*
destroys among villains.

8\. This, too, that virtuous people are increased in a province <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[8](#fn_1440) by him who appoints a virtuous
governor of the province. 9. This, too, that virtuous instruction is
provided *and* explained by him who loves Vohûman <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[9](#fn_1441). 10. And this, too, that virtuous

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

deeds <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1](#fn_1442) are set going by him who
teaches learned sayings *and* virtuous deeds to him who is good; even
for this reason, because the reception *of* the progressive supply of
virtue by the learned becomes more complete.

11\. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness.
