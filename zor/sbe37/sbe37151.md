### ERRATA.

P. [89](sbe37029.htm#page_89), ll. 9, 10, for 'the Irânian nationality
(Aîrîh)' read 'subjection (hêrih)'

P. [186](sbe37059.htm#page_186), ll. 19, 20, for 'preparation' read
'bespattering'

In several places it would be better to read âmûkŏ,' teaching,' instead
of hamô-kun, 'every kind (or mode),' so as to obtain the following
amended passages:—

P. [23](sbe37012.htm#page_23), ll. 14-16. Then the exalting chanted
teaching of Aûha*r*ma*zd* for Zaratû*s*t is called, &c.

P. [24](sbe37014.htm#page_24), l. 1, the teaching for Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp; &c.

P. [114](sbe37039.htm#page_114), ll. 15-18, the meritoriousness in the
guardianship and teaching by the keepers of those flocks; the happy
effect of the flock and that of the keeper's teaching; &c.

      „  ll. 23-28, that of the disciple through the teaching by the
priestly instructor; the teaching of the priestly instructor for the
pupil, and the happy effect of the priestly instructor's teaching in
similar matters.

P. [119](sbe37040.htm#page_119), ll. 2-5, the want of eminence of any
one through a teaching that is an offence to others, which is owing to
his closed doors and evil eminence in teaching; &c.

Professor Darmesteter has suggested the following correction:—

P. [26](sbe37016.htm#page_26), ll. 22, 23, for '*based* upon the
traditional early law (vâsarî*d* pê*s*dâdŏ)' read '*dependent* upon
Vâêgerê*d* the Pê*s*dâ*d*ian;' \[who was the twin brother of Hôshâng;
see Sachau's Albîrûnî's Chronology of Ancient Nations, pp. 206, 211\].
