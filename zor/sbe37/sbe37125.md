### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1645"></span>[418:2](sbe37125.htm#fr_1686) These extracts
from the Persian Rivâyats are taken from MS. 29 belonging to the Bombay
University Library, which is a copy, made A.D. 1679, from a long Rivâyat
said to have been compiled by Barzû Kâmdîn. The same extracts are to be
found in many other MSS.

<span id="fn_1646"></span>[418:3](sbe37125.htm#fr_1687) Bahman Pûn*g*yah
of Surat, a layman whose father's name. appears to have been Isfendyâr,
returned from Persia A.D. 1627, with letters and MSS. from priests in
Irân in reply to letters from priests in India.

<span id="fn_1647"></span>[418:4](sbe37125.htm#fr_1688) The Vendîdâ*d*.

<span id="fn_1648"></span>[418:5](sbe37125.htm#fr_1689) The order in
which the Nasks are here arranged is the same as that employed in Dk.
VIII, Chap. I, 12, and was in general <span id="page_419">p. 419</span>
use 600 years ago, as we find that Rûstâm Mit*r*ô-*â*pân (the writer of
the original from which Kr was copied A.D. 1324) considered the
Vendîdâ*d* as the nineteenth Nask, corresponding to the Avesta word
drigubyô in the Ahunavair. In Olshausen and Mohl's *Fragmens relatifs à
la religion de Zoroastre*, a similar list of the Nasks is extracted from
Anquetil's Great Rivâyat, in which the order and orthography of the
names of the Nasks are the same as those adopted by the later writers of
the Persian Rivâyats, beginning with the Stô*d*-ya*s*t and ending with
the Hâ*d*okht (which makes the Vendîdâ*d* the twentieth Nask), and
reversing the order of the *K*îdra*s*t and Spentah, as well as that of
the Duvâsarô*g*î*d* and Hûspârâm.
