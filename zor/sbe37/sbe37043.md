### CHAPTER XL.

*Sakâ*d*ûm Nask*.

1\. One section is the Zîyânakistân ('*code of the injured*'), about
*anything* which is animate—and that *which is* inanimate—injured
through lawfully living, giving, receiving, *or* delivering back; the
duty of protection and care for both kinds; the nourishment,

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

extension, sustentation, stimulation, establishment, consolation, and
also gratification of an animate *being; and* the retribution for sin
due to unlawfulness as regards the same matters.

2\. About an example of a damaged gift, *in* the *case* when *one* gives
the thing *to* a poor (ga*d*âk) person at an appointed time, *and* when
at *one* unappointed; *and in* the *case* when *one* gives him an
increase, where *and* what is the increase. 3. A decision about a
shepherd when they shall bring *him* back *an animal* <span
id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_331.md), when damaged, before *its* subdivision;
what he obtains for the damaged *animal* when not delivered back at the
time of subdivision; when the duty about it is dictated by a religious
*man*, and when he keeps *it* in *his own* possession.

4\. About property which is inanimate, whose subdivisions, each
separately, when *one* keeps *them* in use <span
id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_332), and when in reserve (armê*s*tô.md), are
greater and less in value; that is, through so much effecting of penance
(*av*âkan*g*i*s*nŏ) worthily, *or* through so much bringing of interest;
and the capital is the same *in* value, the increase *being* the growth
of dividends.

5\. About the reason why the sin of an injured *person becomes* innocent
through not delivering back a damaged *article* <span
id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_333.md); and many opinions, on the same subject,
are provided for our benefit.
