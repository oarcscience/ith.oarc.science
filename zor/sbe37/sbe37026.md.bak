dogs; about the shepherd's comprehension of their serviceableness, one
with the other, *and* whatever is on the same subject. 2. The extent of
authorised efficiency (*s*alît-gârîkîh) accomplished by the
shepherd's-dog nature of a shepherd's dog, after his *being* appointed
by the shepherd.

3\. About the shepherd's preparing the means of bedding <span
id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_226.md) for the shepherd's dog, giving the
amount of the price of the daily *food* of a shepherd's dog, provisions
for the dog in the winter, and the preparation of a fire beforehand
which it is necessary to make in the sheepfold (pâh-hastŏ). 4. About the
mode of preparing the appointed *fire*place *of* the sheepfold, the
position of the shepherd's dog and the dog's fire, the means of lodging
*and* provisioning the shepherd's dog in the sheepfold, the sin owing to
*the occasions* when *one* proceeds to provide *another* mode, *and*
whatever is on the same subject.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

in flocks <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_227.md) dreading distress; the
dog, *their* protection, is not provided with bedding, *nor* with
pillow, and they are happy; every night *he has* to come out, through
the whole flock, three times, besides when one of the guards (pa*d*ânŏ),
who is apprehensive, counts *them, who*, every day *at* dawn, *has* to
walk out among the sheep, with good words, to inspect *them*, to apply
remedies properly *to* the sheep that are sick, wounded, bruised, *or*
defective, *and* to be *their* guardian; *also* the sin owing to
worrying *them, and* whatever is on the same subject. 6. About that
which is to be done by him as regards the breeding of the sheep, *and*
likewise for the sake of the young ones; *and* the sin when *he does*
not *do it*, or shall act otherwise. 7. About his fully understanding
where *and* which is the sheep for *each* young one. 8. About his habit
and means of keeping away the thief *and* the wolf from the sheep, *and*
the preservation of the sheep thereby when an awful cloud and wind and
rain arise, *or* when the position of those distressed ones, at the
fords of rivers, comes opposite a locality (nisi*s*no) of bad footing;
when it is not possible for him *to save* all, *he has* to save the
greater in value, or the more in number.

9\. About his *having* guarded a sheep from the pasture of others *and*
the retribution for the, sin of not *having* guarded as to the eating
*and* damaging of the corn and pasture of others by the sheep. 10. About
the extent of preservation by the shepherd's dog's driving the sheep
from the corn and pasture *of* others of various species, such as that
which *one* calls the very stupid (gôltar) pig; there is, moreover,

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

the specified pasture as regards those sheep, *but* the pig, which feeds
upon its own predecessors, is also that *which* may commit another sin,
for it feeds upon even *its* progeny at birth.

11\. About the indication of an assembly place (garang) for the sheep,
in a warm *or* cool locality, by the shepherd's dog. 12. About the
characteristics of sheep from one to four years *of age*. 13. About the
village (vîs) of the shepherd, where the shepherd's dog is known when he
arrives; how it is when a sheep *has* to be kept out of the sheepfold
*by* the shepherd's dog, *and* how *it is* when it has to be driven by
him to the village of the heedful shepherd. 14. About the coming of the
shepherd unto a sheep, *and* the path from the village which the
shepherd *has* provided for <span id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_228.md) the
flock.

15\. About a shepherd when he withholds the daily *food* of a shepherd's
dog, and the exhaustion of life thereby; after the fourth deprival of
food (atapak-dâ*d*ŏ) <span id="fr_230"></span>[2](#fn_229.md) *it* is
allowable for the shepherd's dog to kill a sheep for nourishment. 16.
About a sheep, *which* comes astray into the flock to be slaughtered,
*being* the perquisite of the butcher (bâhar-î kû*s*târ), and that of
the shepherd's dog *being* its dog <span id="fr_231"></span>[3](#fn_230.md)
and the appointed number of one sheep. 17. About *their* extent of
movement, and their pregnancy and growing old (bâr va-khasân). 18. About
the sin of the shepherd, as regards the shepherd's dog, through
injustice as to work,

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

shepherd, through improperly tending a sheep, *or* worrying *it* by

incompetence *and* unworthiness therein; *besides* adjudications between
the shepherd *and* shepherd's dog.

19\. About the instruction which the shepherd *gives* to the shepherd's
dog, through reminders (pavan ayâ*d*îhâ), to control a sheep, when, the
shepherd's dog *having* heard *some musical* notes (srû*d*ŏ gâsânŏ), the
instruction took place in the form of words; and, when the notes *were*
not heard, even by a blow (zatam), the means of that instructor *being*
a blow. 20. About the peculiarity of the shepherd's dog as regards *its*
employment (rô*g*kâr) at the periods of satisfying menstrual excitement,
