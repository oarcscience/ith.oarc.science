### CHAPTER XXX.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The seventh fargar*d*, A*d*-tâ-vakhshyâ <span
id="fr_815"></span>[2](#fn_809), is regarding the maintenance of the
worship and obeisance of the religion and the spirit of the liturgy; and
this, too, that the spirit of the ceremonial of him who is a
right-thinking, intelligent, and wise <span
id="fr_816"></span>[3](#fn_810) man is quickly mixed up with the light
of the sun, and connected with the accomplishment of the wishes and the
joy of the archangels.

2\. About the choice of will *by* mankind, and the existence of a way to
reward through *their* decision. 3. About advice to mankind as to
seeking that position in which it is possible to remain long with
fondness, and *as to* reciting and teaching <span
id="fr_817"></span>[4](#fn_811) the revelation of the sacred beings.

4\. And, from the statement of Zaratû*s*t, about the shouting of the
demon Aresh <span id="fr_818"></span>[5](#fn_812) to mankind, *thus:*

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Aûha*r*ma*zd* and
Aharman have been two brothers in one womb <span
id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_813), and out of them the archangel <span
id="fr_820"></span>[2](#fn_814) liked that which is evil <span
id="fr_821"></span>[3](#fn_815), through what *occurs* when the
understanders of it *have* mentioned the worship of the demons and this,
that, after it, you *should* present cattle to the planetary *bodies
and* the demons.' 5. About the falsity of the demon Aresh, the separate
origin of light and darkness, the goodness of the material *existence*
of light for determining *what* is done, and the evil of that of
darkness.

6\. The grumbling of the evil spirit thus: 'I am he whose thoughts *are*
evil, O beneficent spirit! he whose words *are* evil, *and* he whose
deeds *are* evil <span id="fr_822"></span>[4](#fn_816); what is dark is
my garment which is very thick, with lower corners where, so far as many
go, *it is still* darker <span id="fr_823"></span>[5](#fn_817); evil
thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds are my food, and I love those *of*
them who are in *that place* through evil thoughts, evil words, and evil
deeds.' 7. And the speaking of Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: 'I am he whose
thoughts *are* good, O evil spirit! he whose words *are* good, and he
whose deeds *are* good <span id="fr_824"></span>[6](#fn_818); the sky is
my garment, which *was* first produced from that substance of the
worldly *existences* which is created as the stone above all
stones <span id="fr_825"></span>[7](#fn_819), that is, every jewel is
set in it; good thoughts, good words, and good deeds are my food, and I
love those *of* them who are in that *place*

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

through good thoughts, good words, *and* good deeds.'

8\. This, too, that true discrimination is not for them, the
demons <span id="fr_826"></span>[1](#fn_820) astute in evil; and they
never truly discriminate whose will is that of Akôman <span
id="fr_827"></span>[2](#fn_821). 9. And about the sickening
(vîmârînî*d*anŏ) of the patron spirits of mankind, *by* the demons <span
id="fr_828"></span>[3](#fn_822), through the deceit of man towards man
owing to the deceit of the demons; and the approach of mankind to evil
proceedings *on the part* of the spiritual lordship, through those
patron spirits <span id="fr_829"></span>[4](#fn_823).

Io. Also the sending of monarchy and the wisdom of religion, *by*
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, for the preservation of the creatures; the recurrence of
the mission <span id="fr_830"></span>[5](#fn_824) whereby *there are*
injury and affliction for the demons and sovereignty again for
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and they possess the reward of Vohûman <span
id="fr_831"></span>[6](#fn_825) and *what* is required *by* the sacred
beings; and the predominance *of* man over demon, in the end, the good
over the evil, and the righteous over the wicked; also about the nature
of those *who* are producing the renovation *of the universe*. 11. This,
too, that is a declaration: 'They are those, *O* Zaratû*s*t the
Spîtâmân! who shall produce the renovation, they have escaped (girekhtŏ)
among the existences, they are

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

vigilant <span id="fr_832"></span>[1](#fn_826) in seeking righteousness,
and gentle-voiced; and, as regards righteousness in thought, they
convert into righteousness anything virtuous which *belongs* to them.'
12. About the statement of *those* praised it is recited that it is thus
mentioned in the Gâthas: 'So we are with *those* who are thine—that is,
we are thine own—by us this renovation is to be produced in the
existences <span id="fr_833"></span>[2](#fn_827).' 13. About the
perpetual convocation *held by* the archangel regarding . the production
of the future existence <span id="fr_834"></span>[3](#fn_828).

14\. This, too, that *he* is an extender of the days of those who defeat
the army of the fiend <span id="fr_835"></span>[4](#fn_829) and clothe
themselves *with* deeds of shining light, and also those of a virtuous
body, who are these: the priest, the warrior, the husbandman, and the
man who is a ruler; with whom are Aharî*s*vang <span
id="fr_836"></span>[5](#fn_830) and the spirit of liberality
(râ*d*îh) <span id="fr_837"></span>[6](#fn_831); they meditate with good
thoughts (hû-mîni*s*nîh) <span id="fr_838"></span>[7](#fn_832) and joy,
and, with pleasure to themselves, they give the world into the
guardianship of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and also *of* Ashavahi*s*t <span
id="fr_839"></span>[8](#fn_833), when they possess the religion of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* as a ruler. 15. This, too, that *he*, whose thoughts are
through a high-priest who possesses a patron spirit, always thinks that
which is virtuous, and his sagacity increases <span
id="fr_840"></span>[9](#fn_834).

16\. And about advice to mankind as to three things, through which the
renovation and happy progress of the creatures arise, *namely*, seeking
the

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

true religion, abstaining from injuring the creatures, *and* striving
for the benefit of mankind.

17\. The excellence *of* righteousness is perfect.
