### CHAPTER XXXVII.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 'produced the dawn *and* noontide (aûsh
r*ê*pis*p*) <span id="fr_988"></span>[3](#fn_979.md). *e*. I fashioned
sovereignty *and* the desired complete mindfulness together <span
id="fr_989"></span>[4](#fn_980.md), *and* produced, for more advantageous
disclosure, a son (be*r*manar-aê) for a father <span
id="fr_990"></span>[5](#fn_981.md); the disclosure that discloses a male
and the impregnation of a female, and in that disclosure a son *was*
produced by me for the father, *O* Zaratû*s*t!' *f*. So the evil spirit
observed, and he called upwards from the abyss thus: '*O* beneficent
spirit! thou art the creator *of* all creatures, *but* I *will* make all
thy creatures old, *O* beneficent spirit!'

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

*g*. About the religion becoming progressive <span
id="fr_991"></span>[1](#fn_982.md) in every one, through its renovation *of
the universe and its* future existence, *there* is this, too, namely:
'This thy religion of Zaratû*s*t is the width of the world, *and*
righteousness is the best of religions; this thy religion of Zaratû*s*t
is the improvement of the world, which is first supplied *by*
righteousness *and* complete mindfulness in the reason (vârôm) of those
who recite this thy revelation (dênô) <span
id="fr_992"></span>[2](#fn_983.md) of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, *O*
Zaratû*s*t! this thy good religion is the best which it is possible to
provide with righteousness for one's own. *h*. Thou shouldst proclaim
this to kinsmen *and* confederates, to priests and him who is most
active in the country; *as to those* who will dispute <span
id="fr_993"></span>[3](#fn_984.md) this thy religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, thou shouldst proclaim this over the earth of seven
regions, unto that which is the furthest of houses, villages,
communities, and provinces: "Do thou openly curse <span
id="fr_994"></span>[4](#fn_985.md) these who are heretical *towards* me,
*thou* united Ma*zd*a-worship of Zaratû*s*t, opposed to the demons,
which is the ordinance of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_995"></span>[5](#fn_986.md)!"'

*i*. Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: 'I *will* exalt this which is beloved by
thee, the religion of the Ma*zd*a-worship *of* Zaratû*s*t, opposed to
the demons, which is the ordinance of Aûha*r*ma*zd*. *j*. If this which
is thine had not been further loved by me, the Ma*zd*a-worship of
Zaratû*s*t, that is opposed to the demons *and is* the ordinance of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, would have lapsed into disaster (vinâsi*s*nŏ) <span
id="fr_996"></span>[6](#fn_987.md), so that the profession

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

of the religion *of* the Ma*zd*a-worshippers would be destroyed, that
is, the religion would not have become progressive, *and* no one *would
be* after the benefiters. *k*. But, owing to that *love*, O Zaratû*s*t!
the religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers becomes progressive <span
id="fr_997"></span>[1](#fn_988.md) even then up to the production of the
renovation *of the universe*, even then until the perpetual life of the
existences, even then till the raising up of the dead, *and* even then
up to the full atonement of the spirits.'

*l*. About *being* despised in hell; the wicked are scornful to a wicked
*one, and* to the spirits *apart* from the wicked; and it is the creator
who, even after saving the others from hell, and the three nights
stewing in hell <span id="fr_998"></span>[2](#fn_989.md), *is* to cause the
preservation of them also—after those three nights—from that misery, and
*every one* attains to happiness. *m*. This, too, that Zaratû*s*t
enquired of Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: 'How have the ignorant demons, *O*
Aûha*r*ma*zd*! ever been good rulers <span
id="fr_999"></span>[3](#fn_990.md)? How do they think of them in the world
thus, *that* their happiness arose from them?' *n*. And Aûha*r*ma*zd*
spoke thus: 'They have been demons, *O* Zaratû*s*t! *and* evil-ruling;
not well-ruling, even for a reward, do they produce the work of
righteousness <span id="fr_1000"></span>[4](#fn_991.md).'

*o*. Perfect righteousness is excellence.
