### III. FROM THE RIVÂYAT OF NARÊMÂN HÔSHANG <span id="fr_1720"></span>[3](#fn_1679.md)

1\. Again, that which is in Pahlavi characters is clear *in* that
manner, that in the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô there are twenty-one vocables, that
is, twenty-one words, and beneath each word there is an equivalent
meaning; it is also known to the devout *that* there are twenty-one
Nasks of the Avesta.

2\. The first Nask is of thirty-three subdivisions, that is, it is of
thirty-three compilations, and its name is Stôd-ya*s*t, that is,
'producing the praise of the sacred beings;' and the words of the book
*have* come down for the majesty of the sacred beings and angels, and
they recite *them* in that manner; and *in* the presence of every
high-priest of the pure ritual, who rightly understands its Avesta and
Zand,

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

as he recites *them* correctly on three occasions, the angels come down;
of this there is no doubt.

3\. The name of the second is Istûdgar, and it is of twenty-two
subdivisions; its statements are for the admonition of the people.

4\. The name of the third Nask is Vahi*s*t-mânthrah, and it is of

religion.

compilations; its explanation is about the interpretation of the world
of the stars, the planets and constellations, and understanding the
arrangement of the sky.

8\. The seventh is the Pâ*g*am; this Nask is of twenty-two subdivisions,
and its explanation is with regard to lawful and unlawful animals,
whenever they slaughter *them* for the sake of solemnizing a
season-festival; and, again, whatever is manifold reward and good work;
also about the reason of the five days of the guardian spirits, which
they call the select, *and* wherefore they are appointed.

9\. The name of the eighth is Ratu*s*tâyî, and it is of fifty
subdivisions, of which, after *the time of* Alexander, they preserved
and found no more *than* thirteen subdivisions; its explanation is about
maintaining devotion, and *of* obedience to kings, high-priests, and
governors.

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

10\. The name of the ninth is Bari*s*, and this Nask was of sixty
subdivisions, *but* after *the time of* Alexander they found no more

and high-priests, leaders and princes, judges and messengers, what is
the nature of the authority of peasants and princes, and what kind of
towns they possess.

11\. The name of the tenth is Ka*s*srôb, and this Nask has been of sixty
subdivisions, *but* after *the time of* Alexander they found again no
more *than* fifteen subdivisions; its explanation is about the
distinction of natural wisdom and knowledge from acquired knowledge;
that which makes mankind pure from defilement, and the usage that
maintains the proceedings of mankind.

12\. The eleventh is the Nask of Vi*s*tâsp-shâh, and it has been of
sixty subdivisions, *but* after *the time of* Alexander they found again
no more *than* ten subdivisions, and *their* statements are with regard
to king Gu*s*tâsp making the religion current.

13\. The name of the twelfth is ‘*H*a*s*t, and it is of twenty-two
subdivisions; its explanation is about enquiry of wisdom, maintaining
devotion in the world, *and* the punishment for every sin *such* as they
supply *it*.

14\. The name of the thirteenth is Sfend, and it is of sixty
subdivisions; its explanation is *of* that which they demonstrate *as*
miracles from this Nask, that every requirement comes to pass *which*
every high-priest—*who* shall recite this Nask for several days with
seven*fold* voice, according to that which has been written—shall
solicit for the world.

15\. The name of the fourteenth is *G*ira*s*t, and

<span id="page_431">p. 431</span>

this is of twenty-two subdivisions, its explanation is about the
creation of the people of mankind in the day of the Eternal, until the
last day of the resurrection occurs; their becoming manifest in the
mother's womb, *and* why some die in the womb and some are born, some
are kings and some are peasants.

16\. The name of the fifteenth is Baghân-ya*s*t, *and* this is of
seventeen subdivisions; its explanation is about the praise of the
angels admitted, and, *as to* the servants of the Most Glorious, *at*
what period they each become manifest, and what duty they perform, till
the resurrection.

17\. The name of the sixteenth is Niyâram, and this is of fifty-four
subdivisions; its explanation is about decrees *as to* traders,
covenants and decisions, that is, awards with regard to the creatures
*and* how they act.

18\. The name of the seventeenth is Aspâram, and this is of sixty-four
subdivisions; its explanation in these is well-directed and a good
*thing;* and whatever remains therein.

19\. The eighteenth is the Duvâsarô*g*ad, and it is of sixty-five
subdivisions; its explanation is that which is a statement on the
subject of Khêdyôdath, that is, forming a union with each other *by*
relations and those next *one another*.

20\. The name of the nineteenth is Askâram, and it is of fifty-two
subdivisions; its explanation is about the occurrence of the production
of the renovation *of the universe*, up to the resurrection *and* future
existence which are the converting of the dead alive, Aharman *and* the
demons becoming extinct, and the circumstances of those *events*.

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

21\. The name of the twentieth is *G*ud-dêv-dâd <span
id="fr_1721"></span>[1](#fn_1680.md), and that is of twenty-two
subdivisions; its explanation is of causing the abstinence of mankind
from pollution, that is, from defilement, and the assault of evil
peculiarly owing to the great; *from* the sight of a menstruous woman,
and the like of these, whenever harm and injury happen to the creation.

22\. The name of the twenty-first is Hâdokht, and this is a book of
thirty subdivisions; its explanation is such that the accursed devil
goes far from every one *who* shall recite this book together with the
Ya*s*t, and this person becomes near unto the sacred being, the
praiseworthy *and* exalted, and in such manner as *he is* near the
sacred being in like manner he obtains rank.

23\. And the purpose of this *being* written is so, that it is known to
these humble individuals <span id="fr_1722"></span>[2](#fn_1681.md) in this
manner, that these books are of those tendencies, and it has been
written *by* those devout *ones* <span id="fr_1723"></span>[3](#fn_1682.md)
in such manner that 'among us no one is able to read the Pahlavi
characters, and the interpretation of these Nasks is in Pahlavi; any one
who does not know the Pahlavi characters is high-priest and is not able
to demonstrate the miracles of the religion, nor that which was written
with regard to the commentary of these Nasks.'
