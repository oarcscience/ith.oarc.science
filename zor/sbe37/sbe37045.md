### CHAPTER XLII.

*Sakâ*d*ûm Nask*.

1\. One section, the Varistân ('*ordeal code*'), *contains* particulars
of that *which*, when it becomes manifest in any one, is indicative as
to witchcraft; the bringing of remedies *for* the person who is rendered
sickly by a wizard; the execution of the wizard, what the religious rite
is in the legal proceedings, *and* the *case* when *there is* a
religious rite in the legal proceedings. 2. About the *case* when, for
want of legal proceedings, he is executed without the religious rite;
and what it is when <span id="fr_348"></span>[1](#fn_346.md) he dies
through his own destruction of some one.

3\. About the accomplishment of an ordeal by which, through the power of
the spirit, *there* arises a manifestation of acquittal *or*
incrimination of those maintaining inconsistencies as to witchcraft,
destroying a righteous *man, or* other concealed instigations of
sin <span id="fr_349"></span>[2](#fn_347.md); the time of its performance,
and the place of hurtfulness of its continuance. 4. About the place of
accomplishment; *in* what manner is the selection (fragâr*d*anŏ),
limitation, *and* preparation of the abode *in* which the ordeal is
performed; that which is to be carried forth to that abode, *and* that
of which the carrying thereto is to be avoided; who is to be admitted to
that abode, *and* who is not to be admitted; *and* that which, when it
occurs there,

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

is a disturbance of the work, they separate (van*g*end) therefrom.

5\. About those belonging to the place of ordeal (varistânîkân) and
other officials there, the rites and customs therein, the ceremonial to
be celebrated in the abode, *and* the invocation of the sacred beings
for assistance. 6. What is the mode *of* performing the hot and cold
ordeal; how is the leading forth *of* the accomplishers thereto, and of
what Avesta is their uplifted recitation; how is the accomplishment of
the hot and cold ordeal, *and* the manifestation *of* the acquitted and
incriminated thereby; *and* many statements (gôkân) on the same subject.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_346"></span>[144:1](sbe37045.htm#fr_348.md) We should probably
read 'and about the *case* when,' supposing that maman stands for madam,
the reverse of what occurs in Chap. XLI, 28.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[144:2](sbe37045.htm#fr_349.md) That is, when
there is no evidence of the crime beyond the suspicions, real or
assumed, of the accusers.
