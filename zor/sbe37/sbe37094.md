### CHAPTER XLV.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The twenty-second fargar*d*, Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[10](#fn_1171), is about the perfection of the
prayers <span id="fr_1184"></span>[11](#fn_1172) of the good religion,
and information thereon.

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

2\. About the glory of a family of some houses *that* has come to the
Spîtâmas <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1](#fn_1173), even before the coming
of Zaratû*s*t; the knowledge and habit of organization and priestly
authority of those *arising* from that family; the existence therein of
houses, villages, communities, *and* districts; *its* attracting *and*
exalting mankind, from vice to virtue, by propriety *of* words and
actions; *and* it convinces those of the world even till the arrival of
the good religion. 3. And this, too, that the existence *of*
Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp—that desire of Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[2](#fn_1174)—and of Frashô*s*tar of the
Hvôbas <span id="fr_1187"></span>[3](#fn_1175), is owing to it.

4\. About the praise of Pôrû*k*âst <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[4](#fn_1176), daughter of Zaratû*s*t, for loving
the good religion with wisdom and acting *by* the advice of the
religion, *having* given *her*self contentedly in womanly service
(zanŏîh) to Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_1189"></span>[5](#fn_1177); *her*
complete accomplishment

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

of duty and reverence *for* him, *and*, after Zaratû*s*t, *her* also
performing womanly service (zanîh) and reverence *for* *G*âmâsp <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[1](#fn_1178); *likewise* her great reward from
Aûha*r*ma*zd* for religiousness and self-devotion (khvê*s*îh) to the
sacred beings. 5. About the praise of Hûtôs <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[2](#fn_1179) for the arising of the progress of the
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion through her, by the growth of righteousness
and smiting *of* the primeval fiend; *also* the good works and advantage
which have arisen in the world from *her* great possessions, and her
equal praise and grand position here *and in* yonder *world*.

6\. About the characteristics of those who are preparing the end *of
time* and arranging *its* period *there* is this, too, namely: 'They are
a manifestation *of* those, *O* Spîtâmân Zaratû*s*t! who shall cause
this renovation in the existences; they are observant, little afflictive
in tormenting, *and* fully mindful, so that, when milk reaches them,
they thoroughly digest *it;* they *have* no fear and accoutrements
(*a*fzâr), *nor* yet do they mention false *and* irreverent (anâstŏ)
statements concerning those who are righteous through imploring
righteousness.' 7. About the characteristics of those disturbing the end
*of time and* opposing *its* period *there* is this, too, namely: 'They
are a manifestation *of* those, *O* Spîtâmân Zaratû*s*t! who are
destroying the existences <span id="fr_1192"></span>[3](#fn_1180); they
are swiftly remedied, that is, they become very quickly devoured
(khâî*d*ŏ) and *are* in

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

the torment of the vicious *and* grievous abode; they are not fully
mindful, so that *it* is not possible for them to digest milk, their
fear is inevitable (a*k*âr), *and* they mention even false *and*
irreverent statements concerning those who are righteous through
imploring righteousness.'

8\. About the craving for the fiend, the assistance of the fiend, and
the gratification of the fiend *by* him who is an apostle of the demons,
and his rendering the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd* helpless <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[1](#fn_1181) even through the want of progress
(anas*ak*isnŏ) which they lament; also the confusion owing to his
speaking deceitfully in the world, *and* the connection with him of an
awful and swift death <span id="fr_1194"></span>[2](#fn_1182), and the
most grievous *and* hellish punishment. 9. About that wicked follower
and assistant of theirs *in* defeating righteousness, and also in
destroying the greater religiousness (frêh-dênôîh) *of* the world and
making the soul wicked in the end.

10\. About the occurrence of the dissipation of the glory of him who is
a well-ruling man, and the pacification (âsû*d*anŏ) of the creatures of
the world by the sacred beings, it says this, too, namely: 'The
persuader *to* evil <span id="fr_1195"></span>[3](#fn_1183) and the
organizer of distress (veshi*s*nŏ)—where they shall make pain *and*
distress current in the world—are the weakener (nerefsînî*d*âr) and
corrupter (âlâyî*d*âr) for the

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

righteous; it is the ruler that is righteous who smites them and opposes
them—that is, restrains them from sin—and causes hatred for them through
*his* will <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1](#fn_1184); that, O
Aûha*r*ma*zd*! is this dominion of thine *by* which you give benefits
(vehî*g*ânŏ) *to* him who is justly living *and* poor <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[2](#fn_1185).'

11\. It is perfect excellence *that is* righteousness.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[298:10](sbe37094.htm#fr_1183) See Chap. XXII,
1 n.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[298:11](sbe37094.htm#fr_1184) See Pahl. Yas.
LII, 1 a.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[299:1](sbe37094.htm#fr_1185) The family from
which Zaratû*s*t, Maî*d*ôk-mâh, and Pôrû*k*âst were descended. Its name
originated with Spitâma, an ancestor of Zaratû*s*t nine generations
back. Compare Chap. XXXIX, 23.

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[299:2](sbe37094.htm#fr_1186) Perhaps we ought
to read 'the Spîtâma Zaratû*s*t,' substituting Spîtâmak for kâmak,
'desire,' which latter word is written on a patch by the repairer of the
MS. who must have found the original word defective. See Pahl. Yas. LII,
2 C.

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[299:3](sbe37094.htm#fr_1187) See Chap. XXI,
24.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[299:4](sbe37094.htm#fr_1188) See Pahl. Yas.
LII, 3 a. Av. Pouru*k*ista who became the wife of *G*âmâsp, prime
minister of king Vi*s*tâsp.

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[299:5](sbe37094.htm#fr_1189) Ibid. 4 a. It
seems unlikely that zanŏîh means 'marriage' here (the term being applied
to her relation both to Zaratû*s*t and *G*âmâsp), unless we were to
suppose that she married *G*âmâsp after her father's death, which the
phrase akha*r* min Zaratû*s*t, 'after Zaratû*s*t,' might possibly imply.
And if zanŏîh means merely 'womanly service' here, its Zvâri*s*
equivalent nêsmanîh, applied to the seven sisters of Ar*d*â Vîrâf in AV.
II, 10, may also not imply marriage, which is a view already suggested
in S.B.E., vol. xviii, p. 398 n.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[300:1](sbe37094.htm#fr_1190) See Pahl. Yas.
LII, 4 b.

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[300:2](sbe37094.htm#fr_1191) Ibid. 5 a. Av.
Hutaosa, the wife of king Vi*s*tâsp, see Yt. IX, 26, XV, 35.

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[300:3](sbe37094.htm#fr_1192) See Pahl. Yas.
LII, 6 e.

<span id="fn_1181"></span>[301:1](sbe37094.htm#fr_1193) Or it may be
'maintaining the affliction of the creatures,' if we read *âz*ârdârîh
instead of a*k*ârgârîh.

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[301:2](sbe37094.htm#fr_1194) See Pahl. Yas.
LII, 8 d.

<span id="fn_1183"></span>[301:3](sbe37094.htm#fr_1195) Ibid. 9 a. B has
avêhîh vêrenakînî*d*âr, but avêhîh, 'want of goodness,' ought to be
dû*s*îh, 'evil,' which it resembles even more in appearance than in
meaning, in Pahlavi letters.

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[302:1](sbe37094.htm#fr_1196) See Pahl. Yas.
LII, 9 c.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[302:2](sbe37094.htm#fr_1197) Ibid. 9 d.
