### CHAPTER XXIX.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The sixth fargar*d*, Khshmaibyâ <span
id="fr_793"></span>[1](#fn_787.md), is about the complaint of
Gô*s*-aûrvan <span id="fr_794"></span>[2](#fn_788.md) to Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
when she sat at the creation in the assembly of the archangels, as
regards the abundant disease and misery which she saw spiritually
*would* come upon her in a bodily existence, through beating,
slaughtering, *and* wounding, stealing, plundering, and presenting, *by*
him of vicious actions *and* worse desires, as a bribe to him who is an
evil-ruling villain (mar), and the operation thereof: the bad ownership,
wrongful investigation, false evidence, and making captive (var*d*akŏ),
*by* him who is wrathful *and* oppressive through greed and envy, from
the warm cowshed *and* the effective *and* diligent guardianship of the
herd's dog (pasû*s*-haûrvô), to that which is a cold *and*
hastily-constructed place; *or by* him who is seeking meat *with* a
merciless hand through making *her* distantly separated from her young.
2. Also their explanation and extenuation (kâstanŏ) <span
id="fr_795"></span>[3](#fn_789.md), and the causing of misery of many kinds
thereby, 'which is no affliction to them when the wind that is
cold <span id="fr_796"></span>[4](#fn_790.md), *or* even that which is hot,
comes upon me; *which* is no affliction to them when, the *untimely
offspring of*

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

*my* womb *being* cast away, they slaughter me; and is no affliction to
them when the serpent, the leech (khun-garâî) <span
id="fr_797"></span>[1](#fn_791.md), *or* even the foulest of noxious
creatures gnaws me.' 3. And the petition of Gô*s*-aûrvan *was* thus: 'Do
not appoint me to a worldly *existence* and that awful misery, *or*, if
thou appointest me to a worldly *existence*, produce it for me without
life (aûzû*s*tânîhâ), so that I *may* be without feeling and may want
that distressing <span id="fr_798"></span>[2](#fn_792.md) pain; *it is*
created for the mighty, through whose assistance there is a capability
of affording protection *to* me, even though the Kaî and Karap <span
id="fr_799"></span>[3](#fn_793.md) exist.'

4\. And, *together* with the just complaint of Gô*s*-aûrvan, and the
compassion of the archangels as to that complaint, *there is* then the
creation of the creatures, among whom the greatest and best <span
id="fr_800"></span>[4](#fn_794.md) is mankind, for fighting *and* subduing
the destroyer, even though joined together with a complaint of wounding
and affliction like *that of* Gô*s*-aûrvan, *and* Gô*s*-aûrvan arose
with greater judiciousness than an absence of creation even with freedom
from disturbance by the Kaîs <span id="fr_801"></span>[5](#fn_795.md); on
account of the necessity of preparing *for* the living of mankind
through the assistance of cattle, Gô*s*-aûrvan *was* produced for the
material bodily existence and assistance of mankind. 5. And, on account
of little feeling for her worldly misery, the breeding (mâyînî*d*anŏ) of
cattle *was* the arraying

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

of strife; the advancement of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion of
Zaratû*s*t in the world by Gô*s*-aûrvan, on the production of Zaratû*s*t
for the assistance of cattle; *and* the preservation of cattle and other
good creations through complete satisfaction *at* the progress *of* the
religion.

6\. This, too, *was* said to Gô*s*-aûrvan, that is: 'I assert unto thee
the passing away of devastation, that is, the existence of a remedy
*for* the misery owing to the evil spirit <span
id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_796.md), *for* which no creature would be
produced by me—me who am Aûha*r*ma*zd*—when a remedy *for* the misery
owing to him had not been known to me.' 7. This, too, that the wish of
the evil spirit was thus: 'Thou shouldst never produce a creature, O
Aûha*r*ma*zd*! and *there* should be here no spiritual lordship, no
priestly authority, and no desire for perfect righteousness, *or*
necessity for duty and good works.' 8. The enquiry of Gô*s*-aûrvan,
thus: 'For whom am I appointed and formed? <span
id="fr_803"></span>[2](#fn_797.md)' and the reply to her, thus: 'For him
who is diligent *and* moderate <span id="fr_804"></span>[3](#fn_798.md).'

9\. Also the friend and nourishment (srâyi*s*nŏ) begged for cattle *by*
Gô*s*-aûrvan, the righteous man produced for the assistance of cattle
*by* Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and the sweetness in water and plants for the
nourishment of cattle, so that he is privileged to feed *and* keep
cattle who gives them pasture *in* reality, and is also diligent *in*
the production of cattle, that is, he gives them pasture, and is thereby
proclaimed a cattle-guardian (pasû*s*-haûrvô) for them who makes the
cattle fully develope <span id="fr_805"></span>[4](#fn_799.md); and also

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

he who gives the wicked Wrath, the foreigner, a beating, so that he may
make *him* stupefied <span id="fr_806"></span>[1](#fn_800.md). 10. The
development of cattle *by* Aûha*r*ma*zd*, advice to mankind as to
moderate eating <span id="fr_807"></span>[2](#fn_801.md), and the grievous
bridge *judgment* of him who *has* unlawfully produced distress *for*
the cattle whom Gô*s*-aûrvan is kindly regarding, with loving eyes <span
id="fr_808"></span>[3](#fn_802.md), in the spiritual *existence*, in bodily
contact with (ham-kerpŏ-î) the archangels and in bodily contact with the
light of the sun, so that *her* hands are more powerful; she who replies
to the sacred beings, and the sacred beings reply to her <span
id="fr_809"></span>[4](#fn_803.md).

11\. About the statements of Aûha*r*ma*zd* *there is* this, too, that
is: 'I am a calculator of those words <span
id="fr_810"></span>[5](#fn_804.md) by which they assert *that* the
existence of worldly beings is for the sake of that of both existences;
I am aware *of* the actions which are practised by those in the material
existence, *both* demons and men; of whatever they practise <span
id="fr_811"></span>[6](#fn_805.md) I am the decider *and* lord, and it is
such as my will *requires* <span id="fr_812"></span>[7](#fn_806.md), even
for the last change of existence; and I look upon all that with that
wisdom and sagacity of mine which was, which is, and which ever *will*
be.'

12\. The formation of a reward for worldly beings *by* Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
through the propitious liturgy (mânsars*p*end) <span
id="fr_813"></span>[8](#fn_807.md) which has become the precursor of the
benefiters; that is, their high-priest, who has

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

a propitiousness and intelligence that are all-beneficial, is he *with*
the liturgy. 13. And about the uniqueness and incomparableness of
Zaratû*s*t among mankind, through *his* desire for righteousness and
*his* understanding the means of defeating the destroyer <span
id="fr_814"></span>[1](#fn_808.md) and teaching the creatures.

14\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.
