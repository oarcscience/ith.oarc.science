### CHAPTER IV.

1\. The Bakŏ <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52) *contains* particulars
about the division of the recital of the first saying of
revelation <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53), the first creature <span
id="fr_54"></span>[3](#fn_54) *in* that saying, the first occurrence of
it, the adaptation of the creature, and the greatness *of* that saying
which is incorporating the creature, owing thereto; also, especially,
the intermingling of thought (mê*d*) <span id="fr_55"></span>[4](#fn_55)
with it. 2. Very comprehensive knowledge about everything, each
separately its own offspring, and many an appendage as much connected
with it as that which is said concerning the Bakŏ <span
id="fr_56"></span>[5](#fn_56), that 'the Bakŏ of the community (dâhmân)
is heard where it is spoken for the community,' that is, whoever shall
do this good work, for him this good work *will* be done.

3\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.
