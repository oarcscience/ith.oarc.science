### I. SÛ*D*KAR NASK <span id="fr_1730"></span>[2](#fn_1689).

Dk. IX, Chap. II, 3-15, referring to the useful effect of reciting the
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô as a spell, on various occasions, is quoted in Sls.
XIX, 1-14, and also in the Persian Rivâyat of Bahman Pûn*g*yah <span
id="fr_1731"></span>[3](#fn_1690), with some slight variations.

Dk. IX, Chap. VI, 2, refers to the passage thus mentioned in Sls. IX, 2,
3:—'The priest who passes away in an out-district (aûzdehîkîh) thou hast
considered as desolate (vîrân); and there is a high-priest who is of a
different opinion, there is *one* who says *it is as* a non-Irânian
(anâîrân) country. *It is* declared that, when a supreme high-priest
(zaratû*s*trotûm) passes away in an out-district, an apostate will be
born in that dwelling, and this calamity is only (aêvâ*k*) mentioned as
to the supreme high-priest <span id="fr_1732"></span>[4](#fn_1691).'

Dk. IX, Chap. VIII, 1-6, refers to Zaratû*s*t's

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

prophetic vision of the golden, silver, steel, and mingled-iron periods
of his millennium, quoted at length in Byt. I, 1-5, with variations
indicative of the date of the Bahman Ya*s*t being later than that of
this Nask.

Dk. IX, Chap. X, 3, refers to the detailed account of the seven most
heinous evil-doers, quoted in Dd. LX XII, 3-9,

Dk. IX, Chap. XV, refers to the supplication of the soul of Keresâsp for
admittance into heaven, on account of his heroic deeds, quoted at length
in the Dâ*d*istân Pahlavi Rivâyat and the Persian Sad-darband-i Hûsh
(see S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp. 373-381).

Dk. IX, Chap. XVIII, 2, refers to the passage thus quoted in Sls. X,
8:—'For in the Stû*d*gar it is said, concerning those who *have*
unlawfully slaughtered animals, the punishment is such that *each* hair
*of* those animals becomes like a sharp dagger (têkh), and he who is
unlawfully a slaughterer is slain.'

No allusion has been noticed in Dk. IX to another passage which is thus
quoted in Sls. XII, 32: 'In the Stûdgar it says thus: "What prepares
sneezing? that is, through what process (kâr) does it come?" And
Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "Hungry living, *O* Zaratû*s*t! moreover, the
remedy for its existence is the Ahunavair, *O* Zaratû*s*t! *and* the
Ashem (aharâyîh)."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1688"></span>[451:1](sbe37130.htm#fr_1729) Only the Pahlavi
versions of these fragments are extant, unless it be otherwise stated.

<span id="fn_1689"></span>[451:2](sbe37130.htm#fr_1730) The detailed
account of this Nask, in Dk. IX, contains about 5,400 Pahlavi words,
and, if these represent the same proportion of original text as those in
the accounts of the first three fargar*d*s of the Bakŏ Nask do, they
would indicate about 4,700 words of Avesta text and 10,500 of Pahlavi
version as the original extent of this Nask.
