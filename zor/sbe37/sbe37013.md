### CHAPTER X.

1\. The Ka*s*kîsrôbô <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_81) *contains*
particulars about the explanation of the ceremonial *and* ritual of the
sacred beings, through what *arises its* conversion *into*
demon-worship, *and* information *as to* cleanness and uncleanness. 2.
The preparations and precautions for the Ya*s*ts <span
id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_82); the tokens and signs of the overflowing
and evil owing to the demons at various times, and the cause of their
exhaustion and the final victory of the sacred beings. 3. Then the
exalting chants *of* every kind, which Aûha*r*ma*zd* *taught* to
Zaratû*s*t, are called the teaching (sâstô) of the spirits.

4\. Excellence *that is* perfect is righteousness.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[23:1](sbe37013.htm#fr_82) Corresponding to the
ninth word, vangh*e*u*s*, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but
it is the tenth Nask in other Rivâyats. Ka*s*kîsrôbô may perhaps mean
'with happy, or comfortable, statements,' and is corrupted into
Ka*s*srôb, Ka*s*kasîrah, or Ka*s*kanîz, in the Rivâyats, which also
state that it contained originally sixty kardah, or subdivisions, of
which only fifteen were recovered after the time of Alexander.
