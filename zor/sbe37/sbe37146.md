### XVIII. SAKA*D*ÛM NASK <span id="fr_1827"></span>[1](#fn_1777).

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 1, 2, refer to passages, one of which may
possibly have contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. XII, 2:—'It
says in the Sakâ*d*ûm that no one of them, that is an inattentive man
who has no high-priest, attains to the best existence, not though his
recitation should be so much that it has made his duty *and* good works
as much as the verdure of the plants when it shoots forth in spring, the
verdure which is given abundantly by Aûha*r*ma*zd*.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 3, refers to a passage which is thus quoted in
Sls. X, 25:—'When an action or an opinion comes forward, and *one* does
not know whether *it be* a sin or a good work, when possible *it* is to
be abandoned *and* not carried out by him, as it says in the Sakâ*d*ûm
that Zaratû*s*t *has* not provided about anything whatever as regards
everything, but three times *it has been done* by Zaratû*s*t about this
duty, that is, so that the Avesta

<span id="page_480">p. 480</span>

*and* Zand, when made quite easy by *any* one, are for recitation, but
are not to be mumbled, for, in mumbling, the portions *of* the Ahunavair
are more chattering.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, 6, refers to the passage thus mentioned in Sls.
XII, 12:—'Where a child is born, *during* three days, for protection
from demons, wizards, and witches, a fire is to be made at night until
day*light*, and is to be maintained there by day, and pure incense is to
be put upon it, as is revealed in the thirtieth <span
id="fr_1828"></span>[1](#fn_1778) of the Sakâ*d*ûm.'

Dk. VIII, Chaps. XXXVIII, 13, XLI, 19, refer to passages which seem both
to be partially quoted in Farh. Oîm, p. 38, ll. 4-10, thus:—'The period
is eagerly proclaimed in another place, as it says in the Sakâ*d*ûm
thus:—"Thripithwô zi asti âtar*s* Ahurahê Mazd*a*u hama, bipithwô
aiwi-gâmê, atha narô ashavanô:—For thrice-supplied is the fire of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* *in* summer <span id="fr_1829"></span>[2](#fn_1779), twice
in winter; so is the righteous man. (Whoever has become a depriver of
food (atapdâ*d*) four *times*, which are successive, should be in
doubtfulness as to unrestricted (aband) maintenance vî*k*ithrem*k*i*d*:
without any publicity; as much as *it is* possible to see *being* the
original minimum of any other)."'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXV III, 33, refers to the passage which contained the
statements thus quoted in Ep. I, viii, 1, 7:—'*It is* declared in the
Sakâ*d*ûm, that the consecrated bull's urine, when it becomes

<span id="page_481">p. 481</span>

fetid, is to be stirred up <span id="fr_1830"></span>[1](#fn_1780),
*and* they should not carry *it* forth so to the fire, so that the
stench extends to the fire; because, if that stench extends to the fire,
on account of the moisture *and* through carrying bodily refuse over and
forth to the fire, it overwhelms it. And that which the Sakâ*d*ûm *has*
declared is, specially, that one of the high-priests *has* individually
said: "That stench is mentioned with reference to the *occasion* when a
stench reaches it of a different kind *from that* which exists naturally
in it."'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLIII, 33, refers to the passage which contained the
statements thus mentioned in Sls. XII, 10, XIII, 30:—'In the
twenty-two <span id="fr_1831"></span>[2](#fn_1781) *sections* of the
Sakâ*d*ûm grievous things are shown about those who do not make
offerings unto the sacred beings.' And, again, 'while those nineteen
(*stanzas of Yas. XLVI*) are our offering, which it says in the
Sakâ*d*ûm should be my own, the strength and power of the sacred beings
shall become more considerable, and the destroyer more perishable.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1777"></span>[479:1](sbe37146.htm#fr_1827) The very long
account of this Nask, in Dk. VIII, contains 4,129 Pahlavi words, from
which the extent of its original text may be estimated (in the same way
as in the case of Nask XVII) at about 53,000 Avesta and 476,600 Pahlavi
words.

<span id="fn_1778"></span>[480:1](sbe37146.htm#fr_1828) That is, in one
of the first thirty sections (see Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVIII, i).

<span id="fn_1779"></span>[480:2](sbe37146.htm#fr_1829) Both K20 and MH6
have amat, 'though,' instead of pavan hamîn. This first sentence
corresponds with part of Chap. XLI, 19, and the following sentence with
part of Chap. XXXVIII, 13.

<span id="fn_1780"></span>[481:1](sbe37146.htm#fr_1830) This statement
is again mentioned in § 6.

<span id="fn_1781"></span>[481:2](sbe37146.htm#fr_1831) The *last*
twenty-two (see Dk. VIII, Chap. XLI, 1).
