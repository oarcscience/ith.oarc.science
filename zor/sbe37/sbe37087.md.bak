### CHAPTER XXXVIII.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The fifteenth fargar*d*, A*d*-fravakhshyâ <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[1](#fn_992.md), is about the seven <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[2](#fn_993.md) perfections of the admonitions of the
religion. 2. First, association with the beneficent spirit of the
creator, through hearing <span id="fr_1003"></span>[3](#fn_994.md),
learning, *and* practising his religion; *and* this, too, that thereby
arises the preservation *of* the good creation when the destroyer is
separated (van*g*î*d*). 3. Second, about separation from the destructive
evil spirit <span id="fr_1004"></span>[4](#fn_995.md), *and* the contempt
which is due to his arrogance and falsehood, the chief of all his vice.
4. Third, governing the temper <span id="fr_1005"></span>[5](#fn_996.md) by
good thoughts, good words, and good deeds; and this, that, whoever *of*
you does not so use this liturgy as thought and word <span
id="fr_1006"></span>[6](#fn_997.md), they *will* not allot him light, they
*will* not allot *him* the best existence, *and* he is miserable up to
the last <span id="fr_1007"></span>[7](#fn_998.md). 5. Fourth, about the
perfection *of* the nature of next-of-kin marriage <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[8](#fn_999.md), which is when *it is* a giving of
one's own (khû*d*îh-dahi*s*nîh); and the decision

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

given *about* it, which is the goodness of one's own progeny for the
manifestation of progeny; also the relationship, sturdiness,
effectiveness, advantageousness, ownership, and giving in next-of-kin
marriage. 6. *Its* first accomplishment *was by* the creator
Aûha*r*ma*zd* in the fatherhood *of* Vohûman <span
id="fr_1009"></span>[1](#fn_1000.md) who *was* the first progeny, and from
that arising of the practice (var’*z*-yehevûnîh) *came* the progress of
the spiritual and worldly creatures and much connected *therewith*, such
as the arising of splendour from light, radiance from splendour, *and*
lustrousness from radiance, *and* the fully progressive diffusion and
succession *of* mankind till the renovation *of the universe;* also,
through spiritual and worldly passing on in the spiritual and worldly
*existences*, Spenda*r*ma*d*'s <span id="fr_1010"></span>[2](#fn_1001.md)
acceptance of the motherly glory *was* an ennoblement. 7. Fifth, about
providing *and* maintaining the high-priests <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[3](#fn_1002.md) who are provided with a spiritual lord
and possessing priestly instruction; the listening of his authorities of
every kind to Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and the reward of the beneficent good
works <span id="fr_1012"></span>[4](#fn_1003.md) of the high-priesthood,
*are* authority for Aûha*r*ma*zd*; *and* the reward of the good works of
the high-priesthood is *their* relation *to* the best existence. 8.
Sixth, about the praise, obeisance, *and* ceremonial <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[5](#fn_1004.md) *for* the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*; and
this, too, that further conference *with* Vohûman <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[6](#fn_1005.md) arises, and wisdom *and*
advantage <span id="fr_1015"></span>[7](#fn_1006.md) are taught by

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

him thus: 'Thou shouldst be a supplicant for the immortal progress of
the soul <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1](#fn_1007.md), O Zaratû*s*t! so that
Aûha*r*ma*zd* *may be* lord of the creatures <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[2](#fn_1008.md), and the practice of propitiation *by*
mankind *may be* that *for* him, also a proportion of the ordering of
obeisance <span id="fr_1018"></span>[3](#fn_1009.md).' 9. About the
sovereignty of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[4](#fn_1010.md)—even through the reward given *at* the
bridge *of judgment*—which is in his good assemblies <span
id="fr_1020"></span>[5](#fn_1011.md), those of the restorer of the world,
the destroyer of the evil *one, and* the benefiter.

10\. This, too, *is said*, namely: 'Thou becomest, through complete
mindfulness, O Spîtâmân! a perpetual adopter (giriftâr) of this
ceremonial of mine <span id="fr_1021"></span>[6](#fn_1012.md).'

11\. About Aûha*r*ma*zd* *having* given power <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[7](#fn_1013.md) to the creatures, the
preparation <span id="fr_1023"></span>[8](#fn_1014.md) of the power, and
the contempt <span id="fr_1024"></span>[9](#fn_1015.md) *for* the evil
spirit and his appliances; Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the creations gave that
contempt back to the evil spirit and the primary (kâdmon) demons who are
those produced by the demons.

12\. About the glorification of Zaratû*s*t *there is*

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

this, too, namely: 'Thou art beneficial, thou art high-priest and
master, and through thee exists the religion which is propitious <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1](#fn_1016.md); thou art brother and companion *of*
all the benefiters, and thus thy friend <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[2](#fn_1017.md) is Vohûman.'

13\. Perfect *is* the excellence *of* righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_992"></span>[273:1](sbe37087.htm#fr_1001.md) See Chap. XV, 1
n; it is here written a*d*-fravakhshê in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_993"></span>[273:2](sbe37087.htm#fr_1002.md) Only six are
numbered in our text, but the seventh seems to be detailed in § 9.

<span id="fn_994"></span>[273:3](sbe37087.htm#fr_1003.md) See Pahl. Yas.
XLIV, 1 a.

<span id="fn_995"></span>[273:4](sbe37087.htm#fr_1004.md) Ibid. 1 d, e.

<span id="fn_996"></span>[273:5](sbe37087.htm#fr_1005.md) Ibid. 3 a.

<span id="fn_997"></span>[273:6](sbe37087.htm#fr_1006.md) Ibid. 3 c, d.

<span id="fn_998"></span>[273:7](sbe37087.htm#fr_1007.md) Ibid. 3 e.

<span id="fn_999"></span>[273:8](sbe37087.htm#fr_1008.md) Ibid. 4 a. There
is nothing whatever about next-of-kin marriage in the original Avesta
text of this Gâtha, but the Pahlavi translators (in order to interpolate
authority for such marriages) took advantage of the Avesta speaking
metaphorically of Mazda as being father of Good Thought (Vohûman), and
of Bountiful Devotion (Spenda*r*ma*d*) as being Mazda's daughter; while
they ignored the old tradition that Vohûman was created *before*
Spenda*r*ma*d* (see Bd. I, 23, 26). A translation of the Pahlavi version
of this Gâtha passage is given in S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp. 392, 393.

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[274:1](sbe37087.htm#fr_1009.md) See Pahl. Yas.
XLIV, 4 c.

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[274:2](sbe37087.htm#fr_1010.md) Ibid. 4 d.

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[274:3](sbe37087.htm#fr_1011.md) Ibid. 5 a.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[274:4](sbe37087.htm#fr_1012.md) Rather doubtful,
as the repairer of the MS. has omitted the first two Pahlavi letters of
ki*r*fakŏ, 'good works,' when writing the word on a patch.

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[274:5](sbe37087.htm#fr_1013.md) See Pahl. Yas.
XLIV, 6 a, b, d.

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[274:6](sbe37087.htm#fr_1014.md) Ibid. 6 d.

<span id="fn_1006"></span>[274:7](sbe37087.htm#fr_1015.md) Ibid. 6 e, 7 a.

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[275:1](sbe37087.htm#fr_1016.md) See Pahl. Yas.
XLIV, 7 c.

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[275:2](sbe37087.htm#fr_1017.md) Ibid. 7 e.

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[275:3](sbe37087.htm#fr_1018.md) Ibid. 8 a.

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[275:4](sbe37087.htm#fr_1019.md) Ibid. 9c. This
appears to be the seventh 'perfection' mentioned in § 1.

<span id="fn_1011"></span>[275:5](sbe37087.htm#fr_1020.md) Assuming that
hû-hambâmîhâ stands for hû-hangâmîhâ, just as hanbâm is a common variant
of hangâm. It might also mean 'good times,' but it seems to represent
the incorrect word amâvandîh in Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 9 e, which each of the
four MS. authorities spells differently. Mf4 has hû-dandîh which, no
doubt, stands for an original hû-zandîh, 'good community,' a fair
translation of Av. haozãthwa, and well expressed by 'good assemblies.'

<span id="fn_1012"></span>[275:6](sbe37087.htm#fr_1021.md) See Pahl. Yas.
XLIV, 10 a.

<span id="fn_1013"></span>[275:7](sbe37087.htm#fr_1022.md) Ibid. 10 e, in
which zakŏ-î ought to be zôr-î according to Pt4, Mf4, with which J2
partly agrees.

<span id="fn_1014"></span>[275:8](sbe37087.htm#fr_1023.md) Assuming that
nîvârûnŏ stands for nîvâr*d*anŏ.

<span id="fn_1015"></span>[275:9](sbe37087.htm#fr_1024.md) See Pahl. Yas.
XLIV, 11 b.

<span id="fn_1016"></span>[276:1](sbe37087.htm#fr_1025.md) See Pahl. Yas.
XLIV, 11 d.

<span id="fn_1017"></span>[276:2](sbe37087.htm#fr_1026.md) Ibid. 11 e.
