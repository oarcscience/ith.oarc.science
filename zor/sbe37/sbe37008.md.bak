### CHAPTER V.

1\. Amid the Dâmdâ*d* <span id="fr_57"></span>[6](#fn_57.md) are
particulars about the maintenance of action and the production of the

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

beneficial creatures. 2. First, as to the spiritual existence, and how
much *and* how is the maintenance in the spiritual *existence*; and the
production of the worldly *existence* therefrom, qualified *and*
constructed for descending (fitô*d*anŏ) into the combat with the
destroyer, and accomplishing the associated necessity for the end and
circumvention (garang) of destructiveness.

3\. The manner *and* species *of* the creation of the creatures; also
their material *existence*, and the character and use of the races and
species; and whatever is on the same subject. 4. The reason for *their*
creation, and for *their* perfection at last. 5. About the adversity,
injury, and misery of those creatures, and their secret (nîhônŏ)
resources *and* means of attacking *and* annihilating *them; with* the
preservation *or* disablement (*a*p*îk*ârînî*d*anŏ) of the creatures
thereby <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md).

6\. Of righteousness the excellence is perfect excellence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_57"></span>[13:6](sbe37008.htm#fr_57.md) Corresponding to the
fourth word, athâ, in the Ahunavair, <span id="page_14">p. 14</span>
according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the fifth Nask in other Rivâyats.
Dâmdâ*d* means 'the creatures produced,' and it is called Dvâzdah-hâmâst
(or humâst) in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained
thirty-two kardah, or subdivisions. No further particulars of this and
the subsequent Nasks are given by the Dinka*rd*, beyond the contents of
this eighth Book.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[14:1](sbe37008.htm#fr_58.md) So far as this brief
account of the Dâmdâ*d* goes, it corresponds very well with much of the
contents of the Bundahi*s*. Zâ*d*-sparam, in his Selections, IX, 1, 16,
also quotes the Dâmdâ*d* as the authority for certain details contained
in the Bundahish, which work must therefore be considered as derived
from this Nask. It is very probable, however, that the Nask contained
much more information than is here hinted, because the author's usual
plan, in these brief summaries, is evidently to confine his remarks to a
few of the details near the beginning of each Nask.
