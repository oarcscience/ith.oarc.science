### CHAPTER XLIV.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. *In* the twenty-first fargar*d*, Vohû-khshathrem <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[4](#fn_1136.md), it is said by Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: 'I
produced, *O* Zaratû*s*t! the desire *for* a good ruler <span
id="fr_1149"></span>[5](#fn_1137.md);' and this, too, *is said*, that, when
*there is* a desire *for* a

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

good ruler suitable for a share of the world, whoever is suitable for a
share of the world \[is a development of that character also, owing to
the share which is given him, and by him who is himself also developing
the character, by giving him a share\] <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[1](#fn_1138.md), giving the share is producing a
helper (vi*g*î*d*âr), production of a helper is a perfect action <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[2](#fn_1139.md), and superiority of action is owing to
thought *and* speech.

2\. About *the place* where the best wealth is the produce of water,
earth, and plants; also its best supplication is lamentation for the
religion, and the sovereignty is liberality. 3. About favours *being*
begged from the sacred beings, even with words controverting the
response of the sacred beings; the favours *for* the worthy are to be
contended *for* worthily. 4. About the connection of the power of
intelligent remembrance and wise discrimination, one with the other. 5.
About the attraction of the mercy of the spirit *and* leadership <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[3](#fn_1140.md), together, into the supreme heaven
(garô*d*mânô), for observation regarding the good creatures.

6\. About the begging *and* teaching of that intelligence which is with
the increase of good works; also the imperceptible acquirement <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[4](#fn_1141.md) of wealth occurs thereby. 7. This,
too, that whoever gives himself up, with humility and reverence, to him
who is a high-priest of the true religion, is proficient
(far’*z*ânakî-aîtŏ) in the religion <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[5](#fn_1142.md); and the benefit produced by him, for
him who is good, is the liberality

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

*which* is provided for the sacred beings <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1143.md). 8. About Aûha*r*ma*zd* *having*
created water, plants, animals <span id="fr_1156"></span>[2](#fn_1144.md),
*and* the law of the primitive religion *for* the nourishment,
arrangement, and succession of the creatures. 9. About the comfort *of*
the spirit *of* the liturgy of the religion when he who is a man of
credible wisdom and superior disposition utters it <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[3](#fn_1145.md).

10\. This, too, that the wicked *one* who does not believe the deception
that he teaches to others, which is his through his own spiritual lord,
yet, when he teaches multitudes (kabedân), is convinced by it,
attains—*as* the end of that teaching—eminence (pa*d*gahîh) for
bare-faced deceit (barâhnakŏ frad*î*pîh), public falsehood, and
disjointed belief.

11\. And about mankind *being* bodily prepared also for the future
existence by fire and melted ore <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[4](#fn_1146.md); in the worldly *existence* the
acquitted and incriminated, as regards the law, *have* become thereby
manifest <span id="fr_1159"></span>[5](#fn_1147.md), *and*, in the future
existence, the torment of the wicked *and* the gratification of the
righteous <span id="fr_1160"></span>[6](#fn_1148.md). 12. About Vohûman and
Ashavahi*s*t *being* invoked <span id="fr_1161"></span>[7](#fn_1149.md) for
assistance also in danger from the wicked, and about appropriating the
best existence through righteousness alone. 13. And this, too, that a
happy coming *of* men to the supreme heaven exists *for* the righteous,
*but* no <span id="fr_1162"></span>[8](#fn_1150.md) coming of any one from
the wicked.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

14\. About the enmity of the Kaî <span id="fr_1163"></span>[1](#fn_1151.md)
sodomite (vâêpŏ) <span id="fr_1164"></span>[2](#fn_1152.md) Akht, the
heretic of the dark existence <span id="fr_1165"></span>[3](#fn_1153.md),
to Zaratû*s*t; and the causing of disturbance (siklinî*d*anŏ), *by* him
and the wicked of similar kinds to him, among those who *follow*
Zaratû*s*t is extreme, and the primeval hellish existence is *for*
them <span id="fr_1166"></span>[4](#fn_1154.md). 15. About the closing of
the abode of the Kai and Karap from virtuousness <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[5](#fn_1155.md); *and* this, too, that they do not
develope the worldly *existences*, nor attend to the spirit, but they
contract the world *and* dissipate the spirit <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[6](#fn_1156.md).

16\. About the worthiness of the sovereignty *of* Kai-Vi*s*tâsp <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[7](#fn_1157.md), on account of great ability and
activity, apart even from superintending. 17. About the praise of
Frashô*s*tar <span id="fr_1170"></span>[8](#fn_1158.md) for his *having*
given Hvôbŏ <span id="fr_1171"></span>[9](#fn_1159.md) in marriage to
Zaratû*s*t, the praise *of* Hvôbŏ for her complete reverence *of*
Zaratû*s*t, and admonition to Zaratû*s*t as to making Hvôbŏ privileged
for the post of house-mistress <span id="fr_1172"></span>[10](#fn_1160.md).
18. About the praise of *G*âmâsp <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[11](#fn_1161.md) for begging fortune and *for* wisdom
in appropriating the excellence *of* the primitive righteousness; *also
his* affection for the sovereignty and *for* the recitation of
revelation, in which *there* is assistance of Zaratû*s*t through command
of

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vohûman <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[1](#fn_1162.md). 19. About the praise of
Maî*d*ôk-mâh <span id="fr_1175"></span>[2](#fn_1163.md) for his accepting
*and* exercising—*and* on account of his exercising—the upholding and
propagation of the religion; *also* the yelling, united assault, evil
food, *and* other affliction owing to the wicked *in* the earlier half
of the night, which is that which Zaratû*s*t *had*, for a like reason,
to bear; and the reciting of the law of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[3](#fn_1164.md), for the joy of the sacred beings, and
his appropriation of the best existence.

20\. About the abounding of Zaratû*s*t in complete mindfulness of the
origin of learning, and *its* development by him <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[4](#fn_1165.md); both the object and the advantage of
knowledge—which is the reigning of Vohûman in the body—*being* the means
*of* developing the world in righteousness <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[5](#fn_1166.md). 21. About the perfection of the
ceremonial <span id="fr_1179"></span>[6](#fn_1167.md) and obeisance of
Zaratû*s*t, *and* the superiority <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[7](#fn_1168.md)of his recompense <span
id="fr_1181"></span>[8](#fn_1169.md); *also* advice to him as to
worshipping Aûha*r*ma*zd* pre-eminently, and the primeval angels by
their own names <span id="fr_1182"></span>[9](#fn_1170.md) according to
their greatness.

22\. It is the excellence *of* righteousness *that is* perfect.
