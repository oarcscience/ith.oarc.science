### CHAPTER LVI.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The tenth fargar*d*, Yâ-*sh*yaothanâ <span
id="fr_1344"></span>[2](#fn_1315.md), is *that*, for him who is practising
good works <span id="fr_1345"></span>[3](#fn_1316.md) as much as it is
possible for him *to do*, an efficacious reason *for* the renovation *of
the universe* is afforded assistance; even for this reason, when every
good work is an assistance *to* the renovation, then—according to the
declaration *that* whoever *does* much more good work is more assisting
the renovation—by him who is practising good works as much as *it* is
possible for him *to do*, an efficacious reason for the renovation is
afforded assistance. 2. This, too, that the apostate <span
id="fr_1346"></span>[4](#fn_1317.md), who is the seduction of mankind, is
injured by him who devotes himself to Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even for this
reason, because he is dislodged *and* is elucidated

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (adîvâgî-aîtŏ
rôshanî-aîtŏ), *and there* arises a class of mankind *who* see the
admission (parvânakîh) *of* the apostate into hell, and he is disabled
when *it is* seen by them.

3\. This, too, that by him who is eager <span
id="fr_1347"></span>[1](#fn_1318.md) for knowledge, knowledge is grasped
*and* taught; even for this reason, because knowledge is taught through
that which is the instruction of every science and the original desire
for it, and mankind shall extol his knowledge; it is also coveted by
them for *being* taught, and they mount and grasp *it*. 4. This, too,
that to slay <span id="fr_1348"></span>[2](#fn_1319.md) an apostate is
taught by the good *one* who is united (hamî-aît) with a good *man;*
even for this reason, because the destruction (aôsh) of Aharman arises
from the union of the good. 5. This, too, that by him who is a disturber
(vishûftâr) as to Vohûman the production of development through
Vohûmanic rule <span id="fr_1349"></span>[3](#fn_1320.md) is taught;
sinners lawfully subjected to the bridge *judgment* (pûhalînî*d*ŏ) *for*
Vohûmanic disturbance, and the command for it by rulers and
high-priests, being a preparation *for* the development of the world.

6\. This, too, that a great ordinance <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[4](#fn_1321.md) is taught by him whose
ceremonial <span id="fr_1351"></span>[5](#fn_1322.md) is for Aûha*r*ma*zd*;
even for this reason, because a comprehension of Aûha*r*ma*zd* and
serving him are the foundation of joy (parkân bûn), and the ownership
and concentration (hanger*d*îkîh) of all good works are themselves the
great ordinance of the faithful whose preparation is through the
ownership, and their welcome is more particularly in the ceremonial;
owing to the same

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

reason, the original possession of the great ordinance of the ceremonial
which is Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s own, and *of* other good works—even though
*relating* to the ceremonial of Aûha*r*ma*zd* of every kind owing
thereto—is necessary for the manifestation of the great ordinance, and
is incorporated (ham-tanû) *with it* when it becomes manifest as a great
ordinance, or as more than a great ordinance; even then its extent
(vâli*s*nŏ) is over this joy. 7. This, too, that the performance
(sakhtârîh) of a ceremonial <span id="fr_1352"></span>[1](#fn_1323.md) *of*
the needy is a gift to the worthy of the creation, and a gift to the
worthy of the creation is the attraction (hâkhtârîh) of a ceremonial of
the needy.

8\. This, too, that the way of righteousness <span
id="fr_1353"></span>[2](#fn_1324.md), also that through which that way is
seen, *and* likewise the reward of those lonely-labouring
(aêvar’*z*îkân) therein are taught by him whose deeds arc an advantage
*to* the sacred beings; even for this reason, because the advantage of
the sacred beings is the advantage of the multitude, and the advantage
of the multitude, which is itself the religion of the sacred beings that
is a guide, is the way of righteousness and also that through which is
the reward of those lonely-labouring. 9. This, too, that even the reward
of a teacher of professionals, which is the profit of the profession, is
liberally given and appropriated for the professionals taught; even for
this reason, because the business of the sacred beings has profited by
the instruction (âmûkŏ).

10\. Excellence *that is perfect* is righteousness.
