### CHAPTER XLII.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The nineteenth fargar*d*, A*d* mâ-yavâ <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[2](#fn_1108.md), is about the protection *by* a
protector for the protection *of* the distressed *ones* of the
renovation *of the universe* <span id="fr_1120"></span>[3](#fn_1109.md). 2.
About the impossibility of convincing those who have not attained to the
fundamental reason (bûn *k*im) of belief, before making them
comprehensibly reliant upon the existence of the creator, which is the
fundamental reason of belief.

3\. About the grievous suffering (vîmârîh) of the religion owing to him
who is a wicked judge, whose effusions (r*êz*î*d*anŏ) on the judgment
seat are injudicious, malevolent, *and* enemies of wisdom; also his
wounding is owing to truth <span id="fr_1121"></span>[4](#fn_1110.md), and
*his* annoyance owing to the truthful, and the evil spirit is lodging in
him; *likewise* the advantage *to* the religion and the great reward of
just judges, and the introduction

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (madam-bari*s*nîh)
of a desire for leadership in virtuousness <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[1](#fn_1111.md). 4. About separation from the
friendship of a wicked, ill judging, unintelligent, and idle *person*,
in whom wrath and envy are coiled up (*av*ar*pêk*ŏ) <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[2](#fn_1112.md). 3. About the good government of
securers of their own necks (*k*avarman) from viciousness, and the bad
government of those repeatedly culpable (lakhvâr-âhûgân) owing to
viciousness. 6. And this, too, that the wicked themselves are wicked to
their own and make them fit for hell, even as to those who <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[3](#fn_1113.md) are precious to them and more beloved
than righteousness; and *their* reign, too, is a scanty protection
(ga*s*ûkŏ srâyi*s*nŏ).

7\. About the praise of Zaratû*s*t *there* is this, too, namely: 'Thy
sweetness and mildness are shown to the worldly existences, thy
leadership of the religion is through Vohûman, *and* thou art well
conversant with righteousness <span id="fr_1125"></span>[4](#fn_1114.md).'
8. About the praise of Frashô*s*tar's ardour in the leadership of good
works, in virtuousness <span id="fr_1126"></span>[5](#fn_1115.md),
listening *to* instruction, and truthful speaking, and in pasturing
(fshegîh), cultivating the world, achieving benefit (sû*d*ŏ
tâshî*d*ârîh), and not giving leadership to villains <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[6](#fn_1116.md). 9. About the praise also of the
energy *and* high-priestship of *G*âmâsp <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[7](#fn_1117.md). 10. About the protection of the good

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

creations by Vohûman, *and* that, too, of the souls of the righteous
*by* Spenda*r*ma*d* also <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[1](sbe37092.htm#fn_1118.md).

11\. About the punishment of the wicked *ruler* who is seizing anything
unlawfully in his realm. 12. Also about the grievous punishment of the
wicked, evil-thinking, evil-speaking, evil-doing, heretical
(dû*s*-dênô), evil ruler in hell <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[2](sbe37092.htm#fn_1119.md). 13. About the reply of
the archangels to Zaratû*s*t, as to the reward begged by him, to make
*him* satisfied about it <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[3](sbe37092.htm#fn_1120.md).

14\. It is righteousness *that is* perfect excellence.
