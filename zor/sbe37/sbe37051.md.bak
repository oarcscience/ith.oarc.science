### CHAPTER II.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. Glorification for the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion *which is* the
ordinance of Aûha*r*ma*zd* opposed to the demons.

2\. Of the Sû*d*kar <span id="fr_495"></span>[4](#fn_492.md) there are
twenty-two fargar*d*s,

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

*and* the first fargar*d* is the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <span
id="fr_496"></span>[1](#fn_493.md), just as the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô *formula*
is as *it were* the beginning (bûnîh) of the religion, and from it is
the formation of the Nasks which, though about the first six sciences
(dâni*s*nŏ), *have* also demonstrated the existence of the highest of
other sciences in its own place.

3\. And here it speaks about the power and success owing to uttering the
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô *formula* <span id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_494.md) at the
beginning of actions. 4. One *utterance* when *one* wishes to say
anything to *any* one; one when he wishes to beg of *any* one; *and* one
when he goes to work. 5. Two when he wishes to confer his blessing. 6.
Four when *it is* for the homage of the chiefs *of creation*
(ra*d*ŏ-franâmi*s*nîh), *or* the ceremony of a season-festival. 7. Five
when *it is* for carrying off the fiend. 8. Six when *it is* for power;
*and* six when *it is* for the success *of* a battle. 9. Seven when *it
is* for the ceremonial of

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

the archangels, *or* when *one* wishes to perform the ceremonial of the
archangels. 10. Eight when *it* is for the ceremonial of a guardian
spirit of the righteous. 11. Nine when *one* wishes to cast seed into
his land. 12. Ten when *one* wishes to allow procreation. 13. Eleven
when *one* goes to ask for a wife. 14. Twelve when *one* expects to go
up on a mountain. 15. Thirteen when *one* wishes to go to an inhabited
district (rû*d*astâk-1); twelve <span id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_495.md)
when he goes out pathless; *and* one <span
id="fr_499"></span>[2](#fn_496.md) when he wishes to proceed by a ford
*through* the water.

16\. About *the place* where *one has* to utter the first
Yathâ-ahû-vairyô for smiting the demons. 17. About the good results
(dahi*s*nân) *of* a suitable recital *of* the words *of* the Ahunavair,
the summary *of* everything for Zaratû*s*t to utter. 18. And about *the
fact that*, through chanting forth every single word of the Ahunavair
with a virtuous intention, a demon is disabled, and *there is*
protection of person *and* property from the adversary.

19\. About the division of the twenty-one Nasks, likewise, according to
the first, second, and third lines (gâs) of the Ahunavair <span
id="fr_500"></span>[3](#fn_497.md). 20. About the increase of the creatures
owing to the liberal thought, word, and deed of a righteous *person;
owing to* the priests *having* become numerous, and the reverence *of*
him who is making them numerous, and *owing to* the perpetual meditation
of righteousness and the existence of its recompense.

21\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_492"></span>[172:4](sbe37051.htm#fr_495.md) The first of the
Nasks and second of the Gâthic division (see Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 9, 12).
As the Stô*d*-ya*s*t (the first of the Gâthic <span id="page_173">p.
173</span> division, but the last of the general list of Nasks)
contained the text of the Gâthas, so the next three of the Gâthic
division contained commentaries, or homilies, upon that text, written
with different objects in view. The purpose of the Sû*d*kar was
apparently (as its name imports) to extract useful instruction from the
text, and to illustrate it with legends and remarks. A separate
fargar*d* is devoted to each hâ of the Gâthas, beginning with the three
sacred formulas, and including the united Yasna Haptanghâiti and the
Aîryaman. The connection between the commentary and text, though usually
traceable, is not always very clear; but that is a common characteristic
of homilies in general.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[173:1](sbe37051.htm#fr_496.md) The Ahunavair (see
Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 7). This fargar*d* explains the use made of this
formula, and the benefits derived from it.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[173:2](sbe37051.htm#fr_497.md) As a spell, or
appeal for success. The text of §§ 4-15 has been independently handed
down by tradition, with a few variations, in Sls. XIX and the Persian
Rivâyat of Bahman Pûn*g*yah.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[174:1](sbe37051.htm#fr_498.md) Sls. XIX, 14 has
'thirteen.'

<span id="fn_496"></span>[174:2](sbe37051.htm#fr_499.md) So in both MSS.,
but <span id="img_17400"></span> ![](img/17400.jpg) ayô*v*, 'or,' is
more probable than <span id="img_17401"></span> ![](img/17401.jpg)
aêvakŏ, 'and one.'

<span id="fn_497"></span>[174:3](sbe37051.htm#fr_500.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. I, 7.
