### CHAPTER XXXIII.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The tenth fargar*d*, Yathâi*s* <span
id="fr_929"></span>[3](#fn_922.md), is about the renovation *of the
universe* in the words of Aûha*r*ma*zd* to Zaratû*s*t, thus: 'I *have*
produced the effecter of the renovation, the causer of righteousness,
Sôshâns, *of* whom mankind say that he does not come; and *yet* he
*will* come, for the righteous, with that glory *which* becomes
all-brilliance.'

2\. About the scrutiny and consideration for moderation in a
high-priest's performance *of* every

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

duty *there* is this, too, that the desire of that non-assailant, who is
a producer of benefit among kinsmen, among confederates, *and* among
serfs <span id="fr_930"></span>[1](#fn_923.md), as regards anything
whatever, is accomplishing the will, and is a friend, of Aûha*r*ma*zd*;
and the spirit lodging in him is not deceived by him. 3. And advice
about distance from him in whom similarity of disposition *to* the fiend
and arrogance are oppressive, *and who* is scorning kinsmen, a sharp
liar with serfs <span id="fr_931"></span>[2](#fn_924.md), giving offence
(vêshîn-dahi*s*nŏ) *to* confederates, careless of cattle <span
id="fr_932"></span>[3](#fn_925.md), *and* unfriendly *to* the wretched.

4\. About the bridge on which *there* is access to Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_933"></span>[4](#fn_926.md), *and* he who reaches the best existence
is visibly, *or* invisibly, proceeding *while* offering up
(aû*z*dahân-sagîtûn). 5. And the teaching of the primitive faith to
Zaratû*s*t *by* Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *who* remained embodying the Ahunavair
(ahûnavair-tanû) *as* the Zôti <span id="fr_934"></span>[5](#fn_927.md) of
the world; *and* at the time of the renovation Zaratû*s*t, who *was*
from the sons of Aêzemnô, is in the position of Zôti <span
id="fr_935"></span>[6](#fn_928.md) of the whole

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

world; Vohûvastŏ, *son* of Snôê <span id="fr_936"></span>[1](#fn_929.md),
from the countries of those of the religion, in the post of
Hâvanân <span id="fr_937"></span>[2](#fn_930.md); Îsvand, son of Var*âz*,
from the countries of Tûrân, in the post of Âtarevakhsh; *S*ênô, son of
Hûmstûv, from the countries of the Sênân <span
id="fr_938"></span>[3](#fn_931.md), in the post of Frabar*d*âr; and
Vi*s*tâsp, who *was* from the sons of Nô*d*ar <span
id="fr_939"></span>[4](#fn_932.md), in the post of Srôshâvar’*z*. 6. About
the power and triumph which that ceremonial becomes, even through the
all-brilliance of the immortal renovation of the whole creation in that
existence.

7\. This, too, that the evil spirit <span
id="fr_940"></span>[5](#fn_933.md). . . . . . . . . . . .

<span id="fn_927"></span>[261:5](sbe37082.htm#fr_934.md) Ibid. 6 a. It is
said, in Bd. XXX, 30, that Aûha*r*ma*zd* comes to the world as Zôti, or
chief officiating priest, with Srôsh as assistant priest, just before
the renovation. Here it is not absolutely certain whether Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
or Zaratû*s*t, is meant as Zôti on this first occurrence of the word.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[261:6](sbe37082.htm#fr_935.md) Reading min
A*ê*-zemnôân pavan zôt gâs; Ayazem being an ancestor of Zaratû*s*t,
eleven generations back, the grandfather of Spitama, and the name being
variously written Aiazemn, Ayâzem, Nayâzem, and Aizim in different MSS.
Another reading is min 3 zamôn khûpŏ zôt gâs, 'from three-fold
*procreation, has* the happy position of Zôti,' referring to the
legendary account of Zaratû*s*t's origin, as detailed in the seventh
book of the Dinka*rd*. The position of the Zôti is at the north end of
the ceremonial area.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[262:1](sbe37082.htm#fr_936.md) This and the two
following persons are the Vohvasti *son* of Snaoya, Isva*d* *son* of
Varâza, and Saêna *son* of Ahûm-stû*d*, of Yt. XIII, 96, 97.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[262:2](sbe37082.htm#fr_937.md) In the great
ceremonies of ancient times the Hâvanân appears to have been the priest
who attended to the Hôm-mortar, and his position was near the north-west
corner of the ceremonial area; the Âtarevakhsh was the priest who fed
the fire, and his position was near the south-west corner; the
Frabar*d*âr was the priest who brought the necessary utensils, and his
position was near the northeast corner; and the Srôshâvar’*z* was the
priest who kept general order, his position being at the south end,
facing the Zôti at the north end. Besides these five priests, mentioned
in our text, there were three others enumerated in Vîsp. III, 1; Vend.
V, 58, VII, 17, 18, the water-bringer near the south-east corner, the
washer on the west side, and the cleanser on the east side. In modern
times the Zôti retains his ancient duties of chief priest, while the
Râspî (Bk. VIII, Chap. VII, 5, 9) combines the duties of the seven
others, being called by the Zôti (in Vîsp. III, 1) to take the place of
each of them in succession.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[262:3](sbe37082.htm#fr_938.md) Av. Sâininãm of
Yt. XIII, 144, probably the people about Samarkand (see Bd. XII, 13 n,
XV, 29).

<span id="fn_932"></span>[262:4](sbe37082.htm#fr_939.md) See Yt. V, 98.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[262:5](sbe37082.htm#fr_940.md) One folio of B is
here lost, containing the end of this chapter and the beginning of the
next. The passage missing was equivalent to about 100 lines of this
translation, of which perhaps one-fourth belonged to this chapter and
three-fourths to the next.
