Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### XX. HÂ*D*ÔKHT NASK <span id="fr_1833"></span>[1](#fn_1783.md).

It is doubtful how much of this Nask is still extant. Traditionally, the
two fragments published by Westergaard as Yt. XXI, XXII (excepting XXII,
37-42), and by Haug as Hn. I, II, III, are said to belong to this Nask;
but no allusion to Hn. II, III can be found in the account given in Dk.
VIII, Chap. XLV, and Hn. I can be traced in that account only by
assuming that the Ahunavair is therein mentioned (in § 1) instead of its
accompanying Ashem-vohû, as it appears to be in Hn. I, 4. In Yt. XI we
also appear to have a form of the Srôsh Ya*s*t derived from the
Hâ*d*ôkht Nask, or used in the liturgy when that Nask was recited, and
this Ya*s*t likewise refers (in § 3) to the Ahunavair in similar terms
to those used in Hn. I, 4.

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 1, refers to the passage which contained the
statement about the Ahunavair already mentioned and also thus quoted in
Sls.

<span id="page_483">p. 483</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> XII, 19:—'It says
in the Hâ*d*ôkht that of the sayings which are spoken out the Ahunavair
is that *which is* most triumphant.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 4, refers to the passage which probably contained
the statements thus quoted in the *Â*f*rî*n-i Gahanbâr, 14-19 (Sp.),
concerning the righteous gifts to be given away, for the sake of the
soul, at each of the six season-festivals:—'There is an Avesta witness
manifest in the Hâ*d*ôkht from the passage (*in the case of the
Maidhyô-zaremaya festival*): "Hazangrem maêshinãm daênunãm
paitiputhranãm narãm ashaonãm ashaya vanghuya urunê para-daithyâ*d*,
aêvahê hâtãm *k*inmânahê ya*d* ashahê vahi*s*tahê."' During the other
five festivals the gifts, instead of ewes, are to be cows, mares,
camels, and all kinds of herds and seeds, respectively, as appears from
the corresponding passages. All six passages, mingled with further
Avesta text, occur in several MSS. of the Âfrîngân-i Gahanbâr (see the
earlier part of each section of Af. Gab. 7-12, ed. Geldner).

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 9, probably refers to the passage which contained
the statement thus quoted in Sd. XL, 4:—'In the commentary of the
Hâ*d*ôkht it says:—"Mâ âzârayôi*s*, Zarathu*s*tra! mâ Pourushaspem, mâ
Dughdhovãm <span id="fr_1834"></span>[1](#fn_1784.md), mâ
aêthrapaiti*s*:—It is not desirable that thou, O Zaratû*s*t! *shouldst*
distress *thy* father, *or* mother, *or* priest."'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 10, may possibly refer to

<span id="page_484">p. 484</span>

the passage which contained a statement that is often partially quoted
in Pahlavi colophons, and the Avesta text of which constitutes Yas.
LXXII, (Gld.); the first part of the statement, with a translation of
its Pahlavi version, is here quoted from Mit*r*ô-*â*pân's colophon to a
volume of miscellaneous Pahlavi texts, usually called the
Vi*s*tâsp-shâhnâmak from the subject of its first text, and written A.D.
1322, in which the writer mentions the source from which he quotes; and
the second part is taken from the same writer's colophon to the Yasna
MS. K5, written thirteen months later, which is the only known authority
for this part of the text:—'In one passage of the Hâ*d*ôkht it is
declared that Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke to Zaratû*s*t thus:—"Aêvô pa*n*t*a*u
yô ashahê vispê anyaêshãm apantãm:—one only is the way of righteousness,
all those are no ways:—angrahê mainy*e*us nasi*s*tãm <span
id="fr_1835"></span>[1](#fn_1785.md) daênãm daêvayasnanãm parâ*g*îtîm
ma*sh*yânãm <span id="fr_1836"></span>[2](#fn_1786.md) frâkereitîm:—which
the evil spirit of the heretical demon-worshippers, the wizard, has
forced on to mankind."'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 13, must refer to the passage which contained the
statement thus mentioned in Sls. XIII, 10:—'The fifteen stanzas of
Yâ-*sh*yaothanâ <span id="fr_1837"></span>[3](#fn_1787.md) are for this
reason, because it is given for the destruction of those fifteen fiends
who are declared in the medical part of the Hâ*d*ôkht.'

No allusion to the following seven passages, quoted from this Nask, has
been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV:—

In Sls. XII, 30, it is stated that 'in the Hâ*d*ôkht

<span id="page_485">p. 485</span>

it says that a woman who shall be reverent is to be considered as much
as she who is suitable.'

In Sls. XIII, 6, it is said that 'the twenty-two stanzas of
Tâ-v*e*-urvâtâ <span id="fr_1838"></span>[1](#fn_1788.md) are the
twenty-two judgments of which it speaks in the Hâ*d*ôkht thus: "Anaomô
mananghê daya vîspâi kva, kva parô?—Lodging in the judge, that while *he
has* twenty-two judgments *he may be* more just."'

In Sd. XXII, 3, 4, it is stated that 'in the commentary of the Hâ*d*ôkht
it says, that every one who performs intercession, and extracts anything
from a person on their account, and conveys *it* to them is as much
without dishonesty towards them, as he who may have given to them out of
his own property. And *in* the spiritual *existence* they take account
of that profit for him, and just as they make *out* the account of the
good work of that person who may have given *it*, even so much is his
good work.'

In Vi*g*. p. 12, it is said, with reference to Aharman, '*that* he is a
creature *of* Aûha*r*ma*zd* is manifest from the Avesta *of* the
Hâ*d*ôkht: "Dâta, Ahura spe*n*ta! Mazd*a*u."'

In Vi*g*. pp. 23-25, it is said that, 'if any one passes away from the
bodily existence, as much of his wealth comes to his son, wife, and
daughter as is declared by the Avesta *of* the Hâ*d*ôkht <span
id="fr_1839"></span>[2](#fn_1789.md):—"Âa*d* yêzi avi hê anguhê
astvai*n*ti, Spitama Zarathu*s*tra!—So if in that bodily existence, *O*
Spîtâmân Zaratû*s*t!—narãm vâ nâirinãm vâ para-irithyâ*d*,—*of* males or

<span id="page_486">p. 486</span>

females *one* expires,—*k*va*d* aêtaêshãm y*a*unghuyanãm avaretanãm
maêthananãm*k*a vastranãm paiti-raê*k*yâ*d*,—however much of their
wealth and things, houses and clothing he abandons (that is, he leaves
such in this world)—avatha hê *hv*atô puthrem angha*d*, aêvôbaghem
ha*k*a avaretanãm nisrinuyâ*d*; âa*d* yêzi hvãm nâirika bavaiti,
aêvô-baghem paiti-nidadhâiti; yêzi dughdhrãm he*n*ti, naêmem baghem
fra*g*asâ*d*:—in such *a case, should* there be a son of his, himself,
*one* delivers up *to him* one share of the property; if the wife
herself (that is, his privileged wife) exists, *one* gives up *to* her
one *share* in it; if there are daughters, a half-share comes on to
*each of* them. Âa*d* yêzi*k*a hê narô irista hva hizva ukhdhem vâ*k*em
nazdas*k*a narô danghrem paiti-dyaêti, vîspanãm va*k*ãm ukhdhanãm*k*a
avi yãm astvaitîm gaêthãm harethrem frabarâ*d*;—So also, if that dead
man gives over a verbal statement by his own tongue *to* the nearest
wise man (that is, speaks his own will), all his words and statements,
when in control of *his* bodily existence, *one* carries out (that is,
*one* shall confer authority on his words);—yêzi nôid harethrem baraiti
anâperetha ha*k*a *sh*yaothana:—if *one* shall not confer the authority,
he becomes an unpardonable *sinner* (owing to doing this deed; that is,
the person who, when *there* is a will, does not carry it out).—Ava*d*
ya*d* hê narô irista aputhrâi angha*d*, upa hê puthrem fradadhâ*d*,
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! yahma*d* ha*k*a puthrô haom urvânem *K*inva*d*
peretûm vîdhârya*d*:—So when that dead man is without a son (that is,
there is no son of his), *one* gives forth *the share* over *to* the
son, *O* Spîtâmân Zaratû*s*t! by whom, *as* a son (that is, an adopted
son), they pass on *the man's* own soul from that

<span id="page_487">p. 487</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *K*inva*d* bridge
(that is, it departs *by* the passage of the bridge)."'

In Vi;. p. 83, it is said that 'hair from an ox *or* a horse is
suitable, as *it* is declared by the Hâ*d*ôkht: "G*e*us vâ aspahê vâ
varesa."'

In Vi*g*. pp. 144, 145, it is said, with reference to announcing the
name of the deceased during the celebration of the Srôsh Ya*s*t after a
death, that '*it is* declared by the Avesta of the Hâ*d*ôkht: "Yêzi narô
mazdayasnô ha*k*a gaêthâbyô parairithyêiti, âa*d* hê nãma hadha pitô
frag*e*urvayâ*d*; yêzi nâirika para-irithyêiti, âa*d* ya*d* hê nãma
hadha pathanô uzg*e*urvayâ*d*, Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! aêtem vâ*k*em nî
a*n*tare mazdayasnanãm frasastayâ*d*:—If a man who is a
Ma*zd*a-worshipper passes away from the worldly *existence*, in such *a
case one* holds out his name with *that of* his father; and if *it be* a
woman who passes away, in such *a case one* upholds whatever is her name
with *that of* her husband, O Spîtâmân Zaratû*s*t! *one* shall further
bless this statement (that is, *its being* reverenced is important)
among the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, (do thou proclaim and further bless this
statement)."'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1783"></span>[482:1](sbe37148.htm#fr_1833.md) The short
account of this Nask, in Dk. VIII, contains 295 Pahlavi words which,
according to the proportions adopted in the case of Nask XIII, would
represent about 8,400 Avesta and 17,400 Pahlavi words of original text.

<span id="fn_1784"></span>[483:1](sbe37148.htm#fr_1834.md) The orthography
of these three Avesta names has been amended in accordance with the
Persian version accompanying them, but all the four MSS. consulted have
the first two in the genitive, and one MS. uses a masculine genitive
form also for the third name.

<span id="fn_1785"></span>[484:1](sbe37148.htm#fr_1835.md) Only the first
and last letters of this word are clearly legible.

<span id="fn_1786"></span>[484:2](sbe37148.htm#fr_1836.md) The first
syllable is illegible.

<span id="fn_1787"></span>[484:3](sbe37148.htm#fr_1837.md) Yas. XXXIV.

<span id="fn_1788"></span>[485:1](sbe37148.htm#fr_1838.md) Yas. XXXI.

<span id="fn_1789"></span>[485:2](sbe37148.htm#fr_1839.md) It is perhaps
necessary to repeat that no attempt is made to correct the Avesta
orthography, except in the case of a few obvious misprints.
