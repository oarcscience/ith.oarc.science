### XVII. HÛSPÂRAM NASK <span id="fr_1822"></span>[3](#fn_1772).

A small portion of this Nask is still preserved and known by the name of
Nîrangistân. The last seven-eighths of this text corresponds with the
description of the Nîrangistân section of the Hûspâram,  given in Dk.
VIII, Chap. XXIX, 1-17, although a few folios of its commencement are
probably lost. And

<span id="page_477">p. 477</span>

the earlier portion of the text begins with a fragment of a passage;
which appears to correspond with part of the description of the
Aêrpatistân section, given in Chap. XXVIII, 1; but also contains
passages that are difficult to trace in any part of that description.
The Nîrangistân portion of this text is divided into three fargar*d*s,
and Dd. LXVI, 1 mentions 'five fargar*d*s *of* the Avesta of the correct
law of the Nîrangistân, *which are* easy through the Zand;' so that the
missing portion of this section of the Nask, described in Chap. XXIX,
18-25, must have contained two fargar*d*s. With regard to the
unidentified passages, preceding the Nîrangistân portion of the extant
text, it may be remarked that they include several of the statements
about 'unseasonable chatter' contained in Sls. V, 3-6, where they are
differently arranged.

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXIX, 2, refers to a passage which may have contained
the statement thus mentioned in Sls. XII, I:—'Of the merit of a
threefold *consecration of the* sacred cake the high-priests *have*
specially taught in the Hûspâram that *it is* as much as *that of* a
lesser *form of* worship.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXIX, 8, refers to the passage which probably contained
the statement thus quoted in Sls. XII, 31:—'Of the ceremonies which go
to the bridge *as sin* it says this in the Hûspâram, that *they are* the
non-celebration of the rites of the season-festivals, the Rapît*v*în,
the three nights *after a death, the days of* the guardian spirits, and
the sun. and moon.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXII, 1, refers to the passage which must have
contained the statement thus mentioned in Sls. XIII, 17:—'The six hot
ordeals

<span id="page_478">p. 478</span>

which, in the Hûspâram, are effected by *k*athrayâim âthraiãm <span
id="fr_1823"></span>[1](#fn_1773).'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXIII, 4, refers to the passage which must have
contained the statement thus mentioned in Pahl. Vend. XV, 67:—'What is
as to the sick *dog in* the Hûspâram is, "*when* several doors are
together, *it is* just *if* the nourishment *at* each one *be* only
*for* three nights, and then, when opulence is manifest, the delivery
*be* unto that opulent *one*, and when not, the delivery *be* unto him
*who is* good."'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXV, 2, probably refers to the passage which contained
the statement thus mentioned in Sls. XII, 7:—'In the twentieth <span
id="fr_1824"></span>[2](#fn_1774) of the Hûspâram it is shown *that*
over the soul of him who works in the dark *there is* more predominance
of the evil spirit.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVI, 7, or 13, probably refers to the passage thus
mentioned in Dd. LXI, 3:—'Nearer details of the family guardianship
which is proper *and* which is not proper for an adopted son's duty, of
the child of the good religion with whose business *it* is connected,
*and* of the fathers for whom a family guardian is to be appointed, are
*in* the recital of five fargar*d*s <span
id="fr_1825"></span>[3](#fn_1775) of the Hûspâram.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XXXVI, 8-12, probably refers to the passage which
contained the statement thus quoted in Sls. X, 21, XII, 14:—'In the
fourteenth <span id="fr_1826"></span>[4](#fn_1776)

<span id="page_479">p. 479</span>

of the Hûspâram Nask the high-priests *have* taught thus: "My son is
suitable even *as* thy son, *but* my daughter is not suitable even *as*
thy daughter."'

No allusion has been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chaps. XXVIII-XXXVII, to the
two passages in Pahl. Vend. IV, 35, V, 73, referring to this Nask, which
have been already quoted as also referring to Nask XV.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1770"></span>[476:1](sbe37144.htm#fr_1819) The very long
account of this Nask, in Dk. VIII, contains 2,179 Pahlavi words, from
which the extent of its original text may be estimated (in the same way
as in the case of Nask XVII) at about 28,000 Avesta and 251,500 Pahlavi
words.

<span id="fn_1771"></span>[476:2](sbe37144.htm#fr_1821) So as to include
the nine months’ existence, before birth, in the prescribed fifteen
years.

<span id="fn_1772"></span>[476:3](sbe37145.htm#fr_1822) As the 212
Pahlavi words in Dk. VIII, Chap. XXIX, 1-17, represent about 2,722 words
of the original Avesta text of this Nask, with 24,472 of its Pahlavi
version, it may be fairly assumed that the 3,496 Pahlavi words of the
whole account of the Nask in Chaps. XXVIII-XXXVII, must represent about
44,900 Avesta and 403,600 Pahlavi words of original text. And the same
proportion probably holds good with regard to the other Legal Nasks, XV,
XVI, XVIII, of which very long accounts are given.

<span id="fn_1773"></span>[478:1](sbe37145.htm#fr_1823) This corrupt
Avesta means probably 'fourfold fire.'

<span id="fn_1774"></span>[478:2](sbe37145.htm#fr_1824) The first
section mentioned of these twenty is that described in Chap. XXXII.

<span id="fn_1775"></span>[478:3](sbe37145.htm#fr_1825) See Dk. VIII,
Chap. XXXVI, 1 n.

<span id="fn_1776"></span>[478:4](sbe37145.htm#fr_1826) That is, in one
of the last fourteen sections of the Nask. If it were not for this
number, and the fact that the passage is understood to apply to the
children of a concubine, it might be connected with Chap. XXXIV, 4, 5.
