### CHAPTER XXVIII.

1\. One section of the *first* thirty of the Hûspâram <span
id="fr_244"></span>[1](#fn_243.md) is the Aêrpatistân <span
id="fr_245"></span>[2](#fn_244) ('*priest-code*'.md), particulars about *a
case* where *one has* to provide for a priestly assembly (aêrpatistân),
which is a birth; how the *case* is when *it* is important to go, how it
is when *one*

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

stays at his own *house*, and how it is when *it* is not allowable to
go; also deciding about the *chief* priest (aêrpatŏ), and the proportion
of priests (âsrûkŏ) who are superior, *of* those who are intermediate,
and *of* those who are inferior in the estimation of the wisdom of the
righteous. 2. About the priest whom *one* is sending, and the wayfaring
garments *and* appliances which are to be given to him.

3\. About the disciple, as reverent towards the *chief* priest; the
labour in receiving the *sacred* words *and* teaching *them* to the
disciple; the advice of the *chief* priest to the priests; *and* the
muttered phrases at the time of contamination *by dead matter*. 4. About
what priest—on the arrival of a priest back at the district from which
*one* sends *him*—is to be appointed, as priest for the district from
which *he came, by* the district governor and those of the district, for
teaching *and* instruction in the district.

5\. About which are *those* reckoned as the five dispositions <span
id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_245.md) of a priest that are the glorification
of the priest's statements of the law, *from* the first of *his*
statements in succession unto the last, *and* whatever is on the same
subject.

6\. About the subjects regarding which a priest of concealed parentage
is to be asked, *with* the prelude and sequel of the same subject. 7.
About the bridge *penalty* <span id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_246.md) of a
priest through sinfulness, *in* a separate fargar*d* <span
id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_247.md). 8. About a priest they may carry away
from a district, owing to anxiety for forming a priestly assembly, *who*
becomes worried in forming *it*.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

9\. About the superiority of priests in means of knowledge, one as
regards another; the extent of superiority through which the greater
suitability for authority, of one as regards another <span
id="fr_249"></span>[1](#fn_248.md), arises; *and* whatever is on the same
subject.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_243"></span>[92:1](sbe37031.htm#fr_244.md) Corresponding to
the seventeenth word, â, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; and
it is the seventeenth Nask in all Rivâyats. This name should probably be
Avisp-kharam, meaning 'free from all defect;' but it is called Hûspârâm,
Aspâram, or Aspâram in the Rivâyats, which also state that it contained
sixty-four, or sixty, kardah or subdivisions. The former number agrees
with the total of the sections mentioned in Chaps. XXVIII, XXXII, XXXVI.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[92:2](sbe37031.htm#fr_245.md) A considerable
portion of this section is still extant, combined with a larger portion
of the next section, the Nîrangistân, whose name is applied to the whole
text.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[93:1](sbe37031.htm#fr_246.md) See Bd. XIX, 36 n.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[93:2](sbe37031.htm#fr_247.md) See Chap. XX, 63.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[94:1](sbe37031.htm#fr_249.md) Reading
s*ag*âktarîh-î aêvakŏ min tanê pavan patîh, but there are only faint
traces of the third, fourth, and fifth words, as the decayed folio of
the manuscript has been patched, and the repairer forgot to record the
missing words at the time he did his work. His marginal note refers to a
defect in the next line of the manuscript.
