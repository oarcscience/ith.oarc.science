### CHAPTER LIII.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The seventh fargar*d*, Tâ-v*e*-urvâtâ <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[2](#fn_1264.md), is *that* by him who possesses
advantage through virtue, the world of righteousness is *freed*
from <span id="fr_1288"></span>[3](#fn_1265.md) destruction <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[4](#fn_1266.md); even for this reason, because the
possession of advantage through virtue arises through the
non-participation of the demons *and* the vile therein, and the
participation of, the sacred beings *and* the

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

good; and, when *one* shall act so, the advantage of spiritual origin
becomes more powerful through guarding the advantage from the
destroyers. 2. This, too, that, by him who welcomes Aûha*r*ma*zd* in
*his* person, apostates are likewise forced to make the religion of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* progressive <span id="fr_1290"></span>[1](#fn_1267.md); even
for this reason, because owing to <span
id="fr_1291"></span>[2](#fn_1268.md) the apostasy of apostates *being* a
religion produced by Aharman, *they are* only able to make the religion
progressive through the appellation of Aûha*r*ma*zd*; apostasy *and*
priesthood, *and* the apostates *and* priests, are fraternal opponents,
and whenever the priesthood and multitudes of the priesthood are
triumphant, multitudes of the apostates of apostasy perish (aôshênd),
and when the multitudes of the apostates of apostasy are bold, the
priests of the priesthood are weak; and the priests are superior *in*
power *and* success when their priesthood is properly limited, and their
properly-limited priesthood, too—which can arise through
mankind—consists in the welcome precedence of Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

3\. About the completeness (s*p*ôrîkîh) *of* the priesthood in that
quality now, when the priests of the multitude are the habitation
(mêhônŏ) of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *and* the power of the priests of the
priesthood *has* increased, the valour of the apostates of apostasy is
smitten, and the apostates are defeated *by* the abundant splendour of
the priests, also their power as regards making the religion of Aharman
progressive through the appellation of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is fettered, *and*
they keep apostasy concealed <span id="fr_1292"></span>[3](#fn_1269.md).

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 4. And then also
they, with the appellation of priests, truly speak and teach the
religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and make *it* progressive, just as it is
solemnized and made easy by them, even Though the will *of* the sacred
beings *be* unheard *and* undesired through apostasy.

5\. This, too, that he proclaims the miraculousness of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_1293"></span>[1](#fn_1270.md), who shall appoint
for ordeal that which is certainly a doubt; even for this reason,
because, through accomplishing an ordeal, that which is doubtful is
forcibly rendered visible (vên*âv*dahakî-aîtŏ) to the eyes, as certain
clearness, through the power of the spirit, *which* is itself a miracle
of Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 6. This, too, that by him who shall make a public
decision thereon, *as to* the acquitted and convicted <span
id="fr_1294"></span>[2](#fn_1271.md), gratification is afforded to him
whose maintenance of the dispute <span id="fr_1295"></span>[2](#fn_1271.md)
is righteous; even for this reason, because the needful is delivered by
him to its own requirer *who* thereby becomes even renowned. 7. This,
too, that even the rite of ordeal \[is produced\] <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[3](#fn_1272.md) by him \[who is an advantage to the
righteous; for this reason, because the rite of ordeal is for the
advancement of the ordeal, and the religious ordeal\] proceeds through
sovereignty; these righteous are those of the good religion, and their
advantage is that belonging to the multitude, which is the sovereignty
now, *and* every one who is given for that advantage, to the

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

righteous *of* those of the good religion, becomes the performer of any
rite of ordeal really produced, because the origin of that giving of
advantage is even the rite of ordeal. 8. This, too, that by him who
gives a priest and righteous *man* for propagating the religion, the
rite of ordeal is also proclaimed; even for this reason, because the
teacher and one rightly merciful (hû-âmûr’*z*î*d*âr) give <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[1](#fn_1273.md) the sacred text by which even the rite
of ordeal is declared.

9\. This, too, that *he* who recites the revelation of Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
and who shall do *it* with exceeding goodness, becomes an increaser of
wisdom; even for this reason, because the wisdom of a man increases in
these two ways, either he speaks *and* teaches himself, or he
exemplifies the excellence of a portion to the wise who become speakers
and teachers of wisdom. 10. This, too, that his homage is for
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, who thoroughly teaches a righteous employer *of* animals
and human beings (kî*r*â vavîr) that he considers *him* as their
controller (dastôbar); because, since the productiveness of the
completion of the creatures is produced through the nourishment of the
creatures *by* Aûha*r*ma*zd* through his fulfilling his own
productiveness, that righteous employer *in* the world is *intended* for
the nourishment of his creatures, owing to that outward subjection and
propitiation of theirs, *and* the righteous employer is connected with
*their* subjection and propitiation *for* the creator.

11\. This, too, that by him who gives thought to the religion of
Zaratû*s*t, the soul is given to Zaratû*s*t;

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

even for this reason, because with a man's *having* given thought to the
religion of Zaratû*s*t is connected the receiving of his soul *by*
Zaratû*s*t for preservation from hell. 12. This, too, that by him who
teaches the nature of the sacred beings to mankind, consultation with
Aûha*r*ma*zd* is also further taught; even for this reason, because the
nature of the sacred beings is consulting a spiritual lord, *and*
becomes also the consulting of Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

13\. This, too, that by him who keeps the produce of sheep as the
property of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, a sheep is given to him who is diligent *and*
moderate <span id="fr_1298"></span>[1](#fn_1274.md); even for this reason,
because produce kept as the property of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is for *being*
given for good works, *being* given for good works is *being* truly kept
as a beginning for the possession of produce, and a beginning truly kept
is kept even through a sheep, as a beginning of excellence, in the
control (dastôbarîh) of him who is a diligent *and* moderate
shepherd <span id="fr_1299"></span>[2](#fn_1275.md). 14. This, too, that by
him who is liberal to the liberal the increase owing to developers is
brought into the world; even for this reason, because a liberal *man*,
on account of even that gift given back to the worthy, becomes even for
us—through the development of the world—him who is first praised therein
with the sacred beings. 15. This, too, that whoever shall form a store
for sheep, becomes an agent even in the development *of* sheep *by* the
creator; because, on account of the increase of sheep through the
existence of nourishment for them *having* arisen, whoever has arranged
nourishment for sheep, becomes an agent even in the development

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

*of* sheep *by* the creator. 16. This, too, that by him who teaches
*inward* prayer (v*âk*akŏ) to the good, it is also taught *to* eaters;
even for this reason, because, everything connected with eating *being*
declared by the religion, when the religion is taught by *any* one to
the good, in which even that information is proclaimed, even eaters are
taught about it. 17. This, too, that whoever maintains a sheep, *or*
human being, as our property, is taught to maintain it through the
high-priest of Zaratû*s*t; even for this reason, because it *is* so
maintained as the property of the sacred beings, when he maintains *it*
as the property of Zaratû*s*t.

18\. This, too, that by him who gave predominance to those of the nature
of Gâyômar*d* <span id="fr_1300"></span>[1](#fn_1276.md), the sovereignty
also of those of the religion of Zaratû*s*t is desired; even for this
reason, because the religion of Zaratû*s*t is the nature of Gâyômar*d*,
and the nature of Gâyômar*d* is the religion of Zaratû*s*t. 19. This,
too, that when *one is* alone among rulers a way of speaking to the
rulers such words *as are* really true is thereby provided; even for
this reason, because the utterance *of* blessings *by* a solitary
*person* is for advantage. 20. This, too, that by him who keeps the
sovereignty which is his within the will of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the best
thing is done unto Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even for this reason, because a
sovereignty is so kept within the will of Aûha*r*ma*zd* when he who is
the ruler gives to Aûha*r*ma*zd* the individuality in which is the
sovereignty, and when its proximity and closeness have given to
Aûha*r*ma*zd* that thing which is best *and* supreme.

21\. This, too, that when *one* teaches the sayings

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (v*âk*akŏ) *of*
the benefiters, the information which is owing to the religion is
illustrated <span id="fr_1301"></span>[1](#fn_1277.md) by him to his own;
even for this reason, because the knowledge of religion, which is in
*its* causing liberality by him, is increased even by the repeated
enquiry of disciples. 22. This, too, that by him who teaches an
applicant the virtuous way and doctrine (pand) the liturgy is then
taught; even for this reason, because knowledge arises through the
virtuous course of the liturgy <span id="fr_1302"></span>[2](#fn_1278.md).
23. This, too, that by him who thinks of the affairs of virtue, the
liturgy is maintained *and* taught with virtuousness <span
id="fr_1303"></span>[2](#fn_1278.md); even for this reason, because the
maintenance of the liturgy with virtuousness arises through virtuous
thinking.

24\. This, too, that whoever shall provide the nourishment of creatures
with propriety, his Vohûman (*good thought*) is Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s
progeny <span id="fr_1304"></span>[3](#fn_1279.md); and whoever properly
maintains those which are in his keeping, his position becomes
Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s fatherhood of Vohûman <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[4](#fn_1280.md) even for this reason, because every
proper nourishing is that in which the nourished becomes an offspring
such as Vohûman unto Aûha*r*ma*zd*; and every proper protection of the
creatures, over those which are protected by it, is a fatherhood such as
*that of* Aûha*r*ma*zd* over Vohûman. 25. This, too, that by him who
shall provide nourishment with propriety *for* the creation which is
good, it is taught *that* the good creation *was* produced *by*
Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even for this reason, because from the nourishment of the
creation with propriety, *together* with the discriminating action of
the nourisher, the goodness of the nourished is also

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

evident, from the goodness of the nourished creation the goodness *of*
him who is its creator is evident, and the creator of the good creation
is Aûha*r*ma*zd* himself.

26\. This, too, that whoever shall spiritually make Aûha*r*ma*zd* the
ruler over *his* own person becomes a ruler as to actions <span
id="fr_1306"></span>[1](#fn_1281.md); even for this reason, because whoever
is making Aûha*r*ma*zd* ruler over his person is a leader of wisdom, a
leader of wisdom is a decider taking account of sin and good works,
taking account of sin and good works is abstaining from sin *and*
practising good works, and owing to abstinence *from* sin and practising
good works one becomes a ruler over actions. 27. This, too, that
Spenda*r*ma*d* <span id="fr_1307"></span>[2](#fn_1282.md) is given to
Aûha*r*ma*zd* by him who is as reverent unto Aûha*r*ma*zd* as a daughter
unto a father; even for this reason, because the Spenda*r*ma*d*ic nature
(S*p*enda*r*ma*d*îh) is provided by him *for* Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

28\. This, too, that for him *who* thinks of the care of cattle *there*
arises that wisdom <span id="fr_1308"></span>[3](#fn_1283.md) which the
control (patîh) of cattle gives; even for this reason, because the
nature of the wisdom *for* a production of cattle is provided in
mankind, and, when mankind apply *their* thoughts to seeking that
wisdom, they obtain *it*. 29. This, too, that by him who is admitting
the male *to* cattle at the *proper* time, the care of cattle is also
thought of; even for this reason, because the admittance of the male
becomes productiveness, and whoever <span
id="fr_1309"></span>[4](#fn_1284.md) would cause productiveness thinks also
of nourishment.

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

30\. This, too, that by him who *has* prepared *him*self for the priests
the way to yonder <span id="fr_1310"></span>[1](#fn_1285.md) *world* is
taught; even for this reason, because the way to yonder *world* is
declared by the religion, and its indicator is the priest; therefore, by
him who is prepared for the priests, through discipleship, that way is
known and is made known. 31. This, too, that *in* him who shall do that
which is something that is an assistance to the renovation *of the
universe*, thoughts of the bounty (dahîh) of the creator arise; even for
this reason, because creativeness is through thinking of the renovation,
thinking of the renovation arises through the renovation, the renovation
arises through anything which is done that is an assistance of the
renovation, the doing of anything that is an assistance of the
renovation is through thinking of sagacity, and thinking of sagacity
becomes thoughts of the bounty of the creator.

32\. This, too, that by him who loves the affairs of the archangels a
heart and mind <span id="fr_1311"></span>[2](#fn_1286.md), *for* not being
misled from the way of the sacred beings, are recommended to mankind;
even for this reason, because from the religion of the sacred beings
being loved *arises* increasing power of the sacred beings, from the
increasing power of the sacred beings *arises* their greater authority
among mankind, *and* from the greater authority of the sacred beings
among mankind arises the resistance of heart and mind of mankind, even
in their not being misled by the very demons. 33. This, too, that
whoever shall act with reverence *to* Vohûman sees the sin which is
concealed in *him* mingled with good works

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

thereby <span id="fr_1312"></span>[1](#fn_1287.md); even for this reason,
because reverence for Vohûman becomes submission (hêrîh) in
virtuousness, with virtuous submission are connected freedom from
Kîkship and from Karapship <span id="fr_1313"></span>[2](#fn_1288.md), and
with freedom from Kîkship and from Karapship *is connected one* sound of
life *and* eye, whereby *he is* an observant decider, and atonement
*for* sin arises from good works.

34\. This, too, that by him who shall provide liberality for the
liberal, the giving of a loans to mankind is also taught; even for this
reason, because liberal giving by any one is accounting for his own
debt, and he endeavours to repay *it* fully observantly and with
complete gratification; besides that, the power of liberality becomes
extendible among mankind, *and* through loans and other gifts <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[3](#fn_1289) *of* generosity (dahi*s*nîkîh.md) they
become ardent. 35. This, too, that by him who pays homage (franâmê*d*ŏ)
to the affairs of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, as much as he is able, the non-injury
of the innocent is also taught; even for this reason, because to
intertwine further (frôv*â*ftanŏ) with the affairs of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, as
much as possible, is first *to commit* no sin *and* to perform as many
good works as possible, *and* abstaining from the essentials of sin is
non-injury of the innocent. 36. This, too, that by him who possesses a
ruler and high-priest Aûha*r*ma*zd* is

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

spiritually made ruler over his person <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[1](#fn_1290.md); even for this reason, because,
through the requirement of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the angels are lord and master
of the worldly *existence* of that *man*.

37\. This, too, that whoever decides duty and opinion becomes also an
informer of others; even for this reason, because it informs others that
*he is* possessing wisdom, and this is what is said, that 'the wisdom of
a man is evident from *his* deciding as to affairs.' 38. This, too, that
whoever shall provide nurture with propriety becomes also an indicator
(dakhshakînî*d*âr) <span id="fr_1316"></span>[2](#fn_1291.md) *for* others;
even for this reason, because the happiness of the nurturer becomes also
a happy indicator even *for* thee; and this, too, is what *one* says,
that 'always good, happy, *and* free from serfs <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[3](#fn_1292.md) is he who is not a master of vagabonds
(pa*d*ŏ-î pûân).'

39\. This, too, that by him who is a ruler who, by a command given,
appoints him who is liturgical (mânsarîk), and gives anything to him
which it is desirable to give, the necessary demeanour for true *and*
virtuous statements <span id="fr_1318"></span>[4](#fn_1293.md) is taught;
even for this reason, because the uttering of true *and* virtuous
statements, in fearlessness <span id="fr_1319"></span>[4](#fn_1293.md) of
rulers, is owing to a well-established sovereignty, and their
well-established sovereignty is more particularly through these two
*things*, good commanding and helpfulness; when they establish that
liturgical *one* by a command given *it* is good commanding, and when
they give

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

anything to him which it is desirable to give the helpfulness is
provided; also, owing to their good commanding, the helpfulness is a
good establishment *of* the sovereignty, owing to a well-established
sovereignty *there* is fearlessness also in uttering true *and* virtuous
statements, and, owing to freedom from concealment in uttering true
*and* virtuous statements, the necessary demeanour for true and virtuous
statements arises. 40. This, too, that *he* who gives personal service
unto the king of kings, and who considers the product (bar) as the
property of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, is empowered for indicating the acquitted and
convicted <span id="fr_1320"></span>[1](#fn_1294.md) *by* the spirits, his
indicators of the acquitted *and* convicted; even for this reason,
because the person *being* given in service to the king of kings is the
preparation (nîvâri*s*nŏ) of subjection, and the product *being*
considered as the property of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is to consider the innocence
of *its* origin (bûn) and to make the product well-selecting
(hû-*k*înakŏ) through virtuousness; owing to the progress of these two,
the virtuousness in the world becomes great *and* increasing
productiveness for all the good spiritual and worldly *existences* which
are in it, even those who are angels indicating the acquitted and
convicted.

41\. This, too, that by him who becomes immortal progress <span
id="fr_1321"></span>[2](#fn_1295.md) for him who is immortally progressive,
complete progress <span id="fr_1322"></span>[2](#fn_1295.md) is given to
him who is completely progressive; and its routine (dâ*d*istân), too,

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

is even this, that by him who wishes <span
id="fr_1323"></span>[1](#fn_1296.md) to make that which is his own soul
immortal, *and* would afford *it* assistance, every benefit is given to
him who is a supplicant *for* every benefit *and* becomes a giver of
every benefit which he begs, which becomes an assistance to him whom he
asks in attaining thereto. 42. This, too, that whoever gratifies that
which is enjoyment renders *his* soul immortal; even for this reason,
because the soul subsists through good works, and good works are all
those which gratify enjoyment. 43. This, too, that whoever keeps himself
always in good works <span id="fr_1324"></span>[2](#fn_1297.md) has
produced perfection and happiness by any goodness *and* worthiness of
his; even for this reason, because keeping oneself always in good works
becomes perfect diligence in industry, within perfect diligence in
industry is also comprised opposition to any harm whatever, and it is
opposition to harm and perfect goodness that are worthy of every
happiness.

44\. This, too, that by him who possesses wealth as high-priest of the
priests, predominance as their high-priest is maintained <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[3](#fn_1298.md) *and* taught; even for this reason,
because the provision of sovereignty and *its* progress are really
through wealth. 45. This, too, that by him who would act for the
pleasure of others, owing to virtue, the growth *and* increase owing to
Vohûman <span id="fr_1326"></span>[4](#fn_1299.md) are produced; even for
this reason, because that which has given virtuous pleasure is the
nourishment of the creatures by the producer of increase and growth.

46\. This, too, that by him who welcomes Aûha*r*ma*zd*

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

in *him*self <span id="fr_1327"></span>[1](#fn_1300.md), and teaches good
works to mankind, every virtuous instruction is taught; even for this
reason, because the welcoming of Aûha*r*ma*zd* in *one*self is the
non-committal of sin, *and* the teaching of good works to mankind is
more particularly the performance of good works oneself; innocence and
the practising of good works are the end of every instruction, and *he*
in whom they exist becomes a teacher of every goodness. 47. This, too,
that by him who shall occasion benefit through him who is a propagator
of good works, the evidence of him *who is* well-informed <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[2](#fn_1301.md) is taught through *one* well-informed;
even for this reason, because the chief evidence as to sagacity is to
occasion benefit for the good. 48. This, too, that by him who gives
commands as to the affairs of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, Aûha*r*ma*zd* is made
welcome in *his* person <span id="fr_1329"></span>[1](#fn_1300.md); even
for this reason, because the throne of Aûha*r*ma*zd* in the worldly
*existence* is more particularly in a ruler of well-commanding person.

49\. The excellence *of* righteousness is perfect.
