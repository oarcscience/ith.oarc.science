### OBSERVATIONS.

1\. For all divisions into chapters and sections the translator is
chiefly responsible, as the stops found in the manuscripts are not used
systematically.

2\. Italics are used for any English words which are not expressed, or
fully understood, in the original text, but are added to complete the
sense of the translation.

3\. Italics occurring in Oriental words, or names, represent certain
peculiar Oriental letters (see the 'Transliteration of Oriental
Alphabets' at the end of this volume), or certain abbreviated modes of
writing Pahlavi letters, for which see the remarks on Pahlavi
transliteration near the end of the Introduction. Italic *a*, *â*, *d*,
*e*, *ê*, *h*, *i*, *î*, *kh*, *l*, *p*, *r*, *sh*, *u*, *v*, *zd*
indicate no change of pronunciation; but *g* should be sounded like j,
*hv* by like wh, *k* like ch in 'church,' *s* like sh, and Avesta *z*
like French j.

4\. In the translation words in parentheses are merely explanatory of
those that precede them.

5\. For the meaning of the abbreviations, used in the notes, see the
explanatory list after the Introduction.

6\. The manuscripts used, being the only two independent authorities for
the text of the Dinka*rd* known to exist, are:—

B (written A.D. 1659), a nearly-complete MS. of Books III-IX, brought
from Irân to Surat in 1783, and now divided between three, or more,
owners in Bombay, Nawsârî, and Poona. Of the Books here translated two
folios are missing, which contained portions of Bk. IX, Chaps. XXXIII,
XXXIV, XXXVI, XXXVII.

K (written A.D. 1594 and later), No. 43 in the University Library at
Kopenhagen, a miscellaneous MS. containing several fragments of Books
III, V, VI, IX. Of the Books here translated it contains the text of Bk.
IX, Chaps. I, 1-XXXI, 17.
