### CHAPTER VI.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The fifth fargar*d*, Khshmaibyâ <span
id="fr_510"></span>[1](#fn_506.md), is about the forgetfulness of a father
for a son, a son for a father, a brother for a brother, a friend for a
friend, a husband (mânpatŏ) for a wife (nârîk), and a wife for a husband
in a measurable time, through excess and festivity (khang); and the
unforgetfulness of the spirit of the Gâthas for so many reciters and
chanters of the Gâthas. 2. About the complaint of the spirit of the
Gâthas when a high-priest, although priest of the country-folk
(dehîgânŏ), passes away in an out-district <span
id="fr_511"></span>[2](#fn_507.md), and the body of that man does not come
back to his own land; whatever is relating to that, *and*, besides that,
what is to be born in that

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

land, and the oppressiveness of apostates *which* arises. 3. About the
superior power of the spirit of the Gâthas, *and* also that of
liberality, in preserving the soul from hell.

4\. Excellence *that is* perfect is righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_506"></span>[178:1](sbe37055.htm#fr_510.md) The first word of
the second M of the first Gâtha (Yas. XXIX, 1), here written khshmŏâîbê
(B) and khshmâîbê (K) in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[178:2](sbe37055.htm#fr_511.md) Reading
aû*z*dêhikîh (from Av. uzda*hv*yu); in Sls. IX, 2, 3, where this passage
is evidently referred to, this word has been erroneously read
aû*z*dâyakîh and translated 'idolatry.'
