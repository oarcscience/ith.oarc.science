### CHAPTER XLI.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The eighteenth fargar*d*, Yêzî <span
id="fr_1088"></span>[2](#fn_1078), is about the existence of certain and
doubtful evidence *and* indication as to the future existence <span
id="fr_1089"></span>[3](#fn_1079) arising. 2. About the great dignity
*of* the spirit of good works, *and* that also of the person doing good
works through the lodgment of that spirit in him. 3. This, too, that
they praise, recount, and practise the religion of Ma*zd*a-worship at
the time of the renovation *of the universe*, that of which the demons
through deceitfulness, and then also wicked mankind deceived by those
who are demons, *have* said that it does not occur <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[4](#fn_1080).

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

4\. About the triumph of the sacred beings over the demons at the end of
*various* periods. 5. First, that which *occurs* when, on account of the
preservation of mankind from hell, they praise the religion *of*
Ma*zd*a-worship; *and* that which *occurs* when Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân,
*whose* guardian spirit is reverenced, came to the obedient king
Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_1091"></span>[1](#fn_1081). 6. Second, when
the power and triumph of renewed sovereignty are again connected with
the religion, and mankind, on that account, return to the good religion;
and this occurs on the near approach *of* Aûshê*d*ar <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[2](#fn_1082), son of Zaratû*s*t, when the righteous
*K*itrag-miyân <span id="fr_1093"></span>[3](#fn_1083) arrives. 7.
Third, when mankind contentedly praise the religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, and this occurs as Aûshê*d*ar-mâh <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[4](#fn_1084), son of Zaratû*s*t, arrives. 8. *And*
fourth, that which *occurs* when every one shall practise the religion
of Ma*zd*a-worship with eagerness; *at* that time arrives the beneficial
*and* triumphant producer of the renovation, Sôshâns <span
id="fr_1095"></span>[5](#fn_1085), son of Zaratû*s*t; *and* this becomes
the consummation (sar-hômôndîh) *and* supreme triumph of the sacred
beings.

9\. About enquiring of him who is acquainted with religion *and* a wise
priest *concerning* the religion, and hearing *of it* from him <span
id="fr_1096"></span>[6](#fn_1086); also well understanding *it* through
wisdom. 10. About abstaining

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

from the secret proceedings (nihân-hômôndîh) *of* a deceitful *and*
seductive apostate <span id="fr_1097"></span>[1](#fn_1087). 11. This,
too, *is said*, namely: 'Thou shouldst also not fall into the downcast
imprisonment (nikûn alakîh) through the teaching they deceive, where
they thus mislead thee to the downcast imprisonment which is hell.'

12\. About mankind attaining to the wisdom of an angel (yêdatô
dânôgîh) <span id="fr_1098"></span>[2](#fn_1088) through the grades of
intellect, ability, *and* religion. 13. This, too, *is said*, namely:
'It is for that way when mankind cause the disturbance (*s*iklinênd)
*of* that which is a vile religion for want of a way, when even this is
produced from among the creatures, in which is the opening of a passage
*for* mankind to him, where the evil spirit is dwelling *and* making
thee surrender, and on account of the stupefying Akômanô <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[3](#fn_1089).' 14. This, too, that, through the
sovereignty of sagacity, every one *at* last arrives at that way. 15.
And this, too, that *by him*, who shall persistently perform good works
or sin *with* fearlessness, *it is* to be hereupon considered that his
performance is mindful <span id="fr_1100"></span>[4](#fn_1090), *and*
that the best thing *for* mankind, after birth, is purification from
sin <span id="fr_1101"></span>[5](#fn_1091).

16\. This, too, that the food *and* maintenance of the priests *depend*
upon the husbandmen <span id="fr_1102"></span>[6](#fn_1092). 17. This,
too, that coveted is now the pleasure and strength of mankind due to the
cattle of Khû*r*da*d* *and*

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Amû*r*da*d* <span
id="fr_1103"></span>[1](#fn_1093). 18. About the oppressiveness *of*
Wrath and Envy, *and* the destruction of both through complete
mindfulness and possession of Good Thought <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[2](#fn_1094). 19. *And* this *is said*, namely: 'I
made the religion of righteousness a combining desire (vôyak-î
hâm-dahi*s*nŏ <span id="fr_1105"></span>[3](#fn_1095)), and all
mankind's own selves *are* to be forced into that desire; also its
involuntary seeking of immortality is the reign of the will of all
mankind, and advantage always arises from it <span
id="fr_1106"></span>[4](#fn_1096).' 20. This, too, that the care of
cattle is reverence of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1107"></span>[5](#fn_1097).

21\. About the progress <span id="fr_1108"></span>[6](#fn_1098) of
righteousness *there* is this, too, that that greatness <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[6](#fn_1098) is generated therefrom, and its
seekers—who are human beings—*have* demanded the supreme predominance in
the best existence. 22. About the praise of the period of the renovation
*of the universe there* is this, too, that, at that time, those who are
doubtful about it are all disclosed to publicity <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[7](#fn_1099); *also* the last reward and bridge
*judgment* of the worthy. 23. About the lawfulness of that which
*occurs* through the destruction by Vohûman <span
id="fr_1111"></span>[8](#fn_1100), who is himself the spiritual lord of
the arrangement, *there* is this, too, that the wicked,

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

*at* that time, become aware of their own wickedness, when their bodies
are dissipated. 24. About the destruction of the good works of the
wicked, also that of their own souls, that of *their* spiritual
existences, and that of *their* material bodies <span
id="fr_1112"></span>[1](#fn_1101). 25. And this, too, that at the time
of the renovation *of the universe* occurs the approach *of* the wisdom
of our sovereignty to that of the best of mankind, and that glory is put
on by it through which the destruction *of* the bad and the development
of the good arise; *also* the sagacity which *exists* in Vohûman extends
to those who are its friends <span id="fr_1113"></span>[2](#fn_1102).

26\. This, too, that *there* are those who are extenders of the days,
and they are beneficial in the country <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[3](#fn_1103); and their custom, where they have
arisen, is an opponent of him who is a wrathful person <span
id="fr_1115"></span>[4](#fn_1104). 27. And this, too, that they shall
thereupon excite (lâlâ vadîdûnâñd) a brother *and* sister with mutual
desire, so that they shall form a next-of-kin marriage with unanimity;
and before midday they generate a sublime radiance, centred in the face,
*and* trembling passion <span id="fr_1116"></span>[5](#fn_1105), and
they *make* the radiance grow up, openly manifest, to an altitude of the
height of three spears of the length *of* three reeds *each* <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[6](#fn_1106); and

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

after midday they have learnt expulsion (rânakîh) <span
id="fr_1118"></span>[1](sbe37091.htm#fn_1107), *and* shall remove the
fiend who *was* before a destroyer. 28. About *those who* girdle
themselves where they shall perform *their* proper duty, and are thus
all-beneficent for *being* seen.

29\. Perfect is the excellence *of* righteousness.

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[285:3](sbe37090.htm#fr_1093) A title of
Pêshyôtanû, son of king Vi*s*tâsp, who remains immortal as chief
high-priest of Kangd*ez*, whence he is expected to come to restore the
religious rites in Irân and the rest of the world (see Bd. XXIX, 5, Byt.
III, 23-32, 36-38, 41, 42, 51, 52).

<span id="fn_1084"></span>[285:4](sbe37090.htm#fr_1094) See Bk. VIII,

XLVII, 3 c.

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[286:2](sbe37090.htm#fr_1098) The use of ô for
â sometimes occurs in MSS. from Irân. The word can also be read
shavandagîh, 'existence,' but this meaning is less likely.

<span id="fn_1089"></span>[286:3](sbe37090.htm#fr_1099) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. IX, 3 n.

<span id="fn_1090"></span>[286:4](sbe37090.htm#fr_1100) See Pahl. Yas.

<span id="fn_1093"></span>[287:1](sbe37090.htm#fr_1103) See Pahl. Yas.
XLVII, 6 a, b; also Chap. XIX, 1.

<span id="fn_1094"></span>[287:2](sbe37090.htm#fr_1104) Ibid. 7a, b.

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[287:3](sbe37090.htm#fr_1105) Ibid. 7 c,
where, however, this last word can be read asamîni*s*nŏ, 'unalarming'
(asahamîni*s*nŏ in Pt4, Mf4), and the corresponding word in Pahl. Yas.
XXXIV, 10 b can be read asami*s*nŏ, 'intrepid;' but, as these meanings
are difficult to reconcile with those of the original Av. hithao*s*,
hithãm, it seems more probable that the first syllables asam or asaham,
should be read hisam or hisâm, a mere transcript of Av. hithãm.

<span id="fn_1096"></span>[287:4](sbe37090.htm#fr_1106) Ibid. 8 a.

<span id="fn_1097"></span>[287:5](sbe37090.htm#fr_1107) Ibid. 8 b.

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[287:6](sbe37090.htm#fr_1109) Perhaps these
two words, rûbâkîh, 'progress,' and rabâîh, 'greatness,' should be
alike, but it is doubtful which is correct.

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[287:7](sbe37090.htm#fr_1110) See Pahl. Yas.
XLVII, 9 b.

<span id="fn_1100"></span>[287:8](sbe37090.htm#fr_1111) Ibid. 9 c.

<span id="fn_1101"></span>[288:1](sbe37090.htm#fr_1112) See Pahl. Yas.
XLVII, 11 c.

<span id="fn_1102"></span>[288:2](sbe37090.htm#fr_1113) Ibid. 11 d.

<span id="fn_1103"></span>[288:3](sbe37090.htm#fr_1114) Ibid. 52 a.

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[288:4](sbe37090.htm#fr_1115) Ibid. 52 d.

<span id="fn_1105"></span>[288:5](sbe37090.htm#fr_1116) Reading as
follows:—lâlâ zerkhûnd rôshanô pavan mîyân rôd bûland navêndakŏ khrôs,
but some of the words can be read otherwise, as in S.B.E., vol. xviii,
p. 395, or with further variations; and it is doubtful if the verb is to
be construed with the words that follow it, contrary to the usual
Pahlavi rule, as there is no other trace of Avesta construction in this
section. Neither the Avesta, nor the Pahlavi, version of this chapter of
the Gâthas makes any allusion to the subjects mentioned in §§ 27, 28.

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[288:6](sbe37090.htm#fr_1117) It appears from
Dd. XLIII, 5 that this total of nine reeds would be about forty-eight
human feet of fourteen finger-breadths <span id="page_289">p. 289</span>
(see Farh. Oîm, p. 41, l. 1), or 10½ inches, each; so that the height
here mentioned would be about forty-two English feet.
