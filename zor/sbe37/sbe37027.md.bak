### CHAPTER XXIV.

*Ganabâ-sar-ni*g*a*d *Nask*.

1\. The first section of the *last* thirty-five is the Stôristân
('*beast-of-burden code*'), particulars about the sin, affecting the
soul, due to unlawfully striking and wounding as regards beasts *of
burden and* cattle; *and* the retribution and compensation for it to
one's own cattle, that in case of a beast *of burden and* that in case
of a sheep (anûm*âê*), during life. 2. That which *arises* when *one
smites* them with a brand (dakhshak); that when *one* smites them on the
flank, *and* that when *it is* in front of them; that

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

when their flanks are so smitten is complete smiting. 3. Of the smiting,
too, *of* other members, the smiting in front, though the smiting *be*
such as when *one* so smites for smiting on the flank, is not complete
smiting. 4. And that which amounts to as much as a complete smiting,
when *one* so smites as for smiting on the flank, is such as that when
*one casts off* the skin, and that when *one* casts off the flesh,
thereby, that when *one* is cutting it, *or* that when wounds (khîmân)
or serpent-scourging (mârvanô) <span id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_231.md) are
*upon* it.

5\. It is also about making the dog which drives the sheep
(pasû*s*-haûrvô) dumb. 6. About bruising the limbs and plucking the
feathers of birds, such as the *case* when *it is* complete smiting, and
such as that when *it is* not complete smiting. 7. And unlawfully
destroying as regards fish, such as when it would make their flesh
uneatable. 8. An account as to noticeably and worryingly beating cattle,
about decrees of whatever kinds as to each separate beating worryingly
that is to be considered as noticeable beating, *and* many decrees as to
whatever is on the same subject. 9. About the retribution for making
clothing of skins and woven *wool* (ta*d*akŏ), and the sin of any one
owing to kindling a fire therewith, *or* roasting flesh which is stolen
*or* plundered.

10\. About the good work *of* all that is wise activity, and the reward
of the happy place <span id="fr_233"></span>[2](#fn_232.md); the sin of
every*thing* that is ignorant activity, and the

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

bridge *penalty* of the evil place <span
id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_233.md); connected therewith, to make him who is
righteous develope in wisdom, and to make him who is wicked diminish in
ignorance, is the world.
