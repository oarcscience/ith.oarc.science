### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. The *K*itradâ*d* <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_88.md) *contains*
particulars about the race of mankind; how the formation of the first

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

man, Gâyômar*d* <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_89.md), by Aûha*r*ma*zd*
was for the manifestation of the bodily form (kerpîh); and in what
manner the first couple, Mashya and Mashyôî <span
id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_90.md), arose. 2. About their progeny and lineage
during the entire progress of mankind in the central region of
Khvanîras <span id="fr_92"></span>[3](#fn_91.md), and the distribution from
them into the six <span id="fr_93"></span>[4](#fn_92.md) regions which are
around Khvanîras. 3. The various races, which are specially enumerated,
were ordered to disperse by the attracting or banishing command of the
creator, to each separate race, as to the place where it went to; and
whose life and soul (nisman) are appointed from yonder world. 4. Also
the original description of their descent into the various regions, of
those, too, who are on the frontiers of Khvanîras, and those who also
made their habitation in the intermediate places; and the customs of
each one of the species of mankind which was produced among the original
races.

5\. The original establishment of law and custom; that of village
superintendence (dihânkânîh) <span id="fr_94"></span>[5](#fn_93.md), for
the cultivation and nourishment of the world, based upon the traditional
early law (vâsarî*d* pê*s*dâ*d*ŏ); and that of monarchy, for the
protection and government

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

*of* the creatures, upon Hôshâng the Pê*s*dâ*d*ian <span
id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_94.md). 6. A report of the lineage of Hôshâng,
who was the first, and Tâkhmô-rupô <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_95.md)
who *was* the second ruler of the seven regions; and an enumeration of
reports of lineage from the original creation even unto Yim <span
id="fr_97"></span>[3](#fn_96.md). 7. A report of the lineage of Yim, the
third ruler of the seven regions; information as to his period, *and*
the progress (sa*k*i*s*nŏ) of time from the original creation till the
end of the reign of Yim.

8\. A report of the ill-informed evil ruler of the seven regions,
Dahâk <span id="fr_98"></span>[4](#fn_97.md); his lineage back to
T*âz* <span id="fr_99"></span>[5](#fn_98.md), the brother of Hôshâng and
father of the T*âz*îks (*Arabs*); information *as to* him and his
period, the progress of time from the end of the good reign of Yim till
the end of the evil reign of Dahâk, and the lineage from Yim as far as
Frê*d*ûn <span id="fr_100"></span>[6](#fn_99.md).

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

9\. A report of Frê*d*ûn, the ruler of Khvanîras; as to the smiting of
Dahâk, the conquering of the country of Mâzendarân <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_100.md), and the allotment of Khvanîras among
his three sons, Salm, Tû*g*, *and* Aîr*îk* <span
id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_101.md); their union with the daughters of
Pât-srôbô <span id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_102.md), and the king of the
Arabs and descendant lineage and report of them, each separately. 10.
The reign of Mânû*sk*îhar of Irân, descendant (n*â*pŏ) of Aîr*îk*. 11.
The expiating <span id="fr_104"></span>[4](#fn_103.md) monarch Frâsîy*âv*
of Tûrân, and Aûzôbŏ <span id="fr_105"></span>[5](#fn_104.md) the
Tûmâspian, monarch of Irân.

12\. The descendant of Mânû*sk*îhar, Kavî-Kavâ*d*, *who* was progenitor
of the Kayâns and ruler of Irân; and the expiating ruler Keresâsp <span
id="fr_106"></span>[6](#fn_105.md). 13. Kâî-Ûs, *grandson* <span
id="fr_107"></span>[7](#fn_106.md) of Kavâ*d*, ruler and maintainer of
royalty (kaî-dânŏ) in the seven regions. 14. Kaî-Khûsrôî who *was* son
of Sîyâvakhsh <span id="fr_108"></span>[8](#fn_107.md) *and* ruler of

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Khvanîras. 15. And
a special report of many particulars *of* the races of Irân, Tûrân,
*and* Salmân <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_108.md), even unto the ruler
Kaî-Lôharâsp <span id="fr_110"></span>[2](#fn_109.md) and the monarch
Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_111"></span>[3](#fn_110.md). 16. The prophet
(vakhshvar) of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, Zaratû*s*t the
Spîtâmân, and the progress of time from the beginning of the reign of
Frê*d*ûn till the coming of Zaratû*s*t to conference *with
Aûha*r*ma*zd <span id="fr_112"></span>[4](#fn_111.md).

17\. And many races and statements, onwards from that *time*, are
enumerated in the same Nask as *having* existed, and are characterized
by it for existence, such as the Sasanians—whom it reckons as the
well-created—and their sovereignty. 18. In the race of Mânû*sk*îhar,
Nô*d*ar <span id="fr_113"></span>[5](#fn_112.md), Yô*s*kŏ Fryânŏ <span
id="fr_114"></span>[6](#fn_113.md), *and*

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Namûn, son of
Spend-shê*d* <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_114.md), is *included* the
father of Avarethrab*a*u <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_115.md),
Âtû*r*-pâ*d* son of Mâ*r*aspend; and *its* existence, even then, remains
for the future. 19. Also about the many qualities of capability and
glory *of* the selfsame sovereignty, which are promoting the renovation
*of the universe* destined for the races; and *its* fortune *and*
splendour which are shed upon the race, and are not severed from it till
the renovation <span id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_116.md).

20\. About the original knowledge of the professions, care, and industry
of the period; the great acquaintance *of* mankind with the putting
aside of injury from the adversary, the preservation of the body, *and*
the deliverance of the soul; the government

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

necessary for the world, even before the coming of Zaratû*s*t by order
of the creator; the bringing of the word <span
id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_117.md) from the sacred beings, and all
occurrences to the leaders *of religion* at various times; *and*
whatever is on the same subjects.

21\. Perfect righteousness is excellence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_88"></span>[25:2](sbe37016.htm#fr_89.md) Corresponding to the
twelfth word, *sh*yaothananãm, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P.
Riv.; but it is the fourteenth Nask in other Rivâyats. *K*itradâ*d*
means 'the races produced,' a name of the same form as Dâmdâ*d*, but it
is read *K*îdra*s*t, *K*ira*s*t, or *G*ira*s*t in the Rivâyats, which
also state that it contained twenty-two kardah, or subdivisions.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[26:1](sbe37016.htm#fr_90.md) The original human
being who was created as the source whence mankind were to spring, in
the same way as 'the sole-created ox' was to be the origin of all other
animals (see Bd. III, 14, 17, 19-23, IV, r, XV, I, 31).

<span id="fn_90"></span>[26:2](sbe37016.htm#fr_91.md) Literally 'man and
woman,' here written masyê va-masyâôî. The mode of their origin from
Gâyômar*d* and the development of man upon the earth are detailed in Bd.
XV.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[26:3](sbe37016.htm#fr_92.md) See Chap. VIII, 2.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[26:4](sbe37016.htm#fr_93.md) The MS. has 'seven'
by mistake.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[26:5](sbe37016.htm#fr_94.md) A more probable
reading than gehânakânîh in the sense of 'colonization.'

<span id="fn_94"></span>[27:1](sbe37016.htm#fr_95.md) This 'Hôshâng of the
early law,' Av. Haoshyanghô paradhâtô, is considered to have been the
great-grandson of Mashya and first monarch of the world, being the
founder of the Pê*s*dâ*d*ian dynasty (see Bd. XV, 28, XXXI, I, XXXIV, 3,
4).

<span id="fn_95"></span>[27:2](sbe37016.htm#fr_96.md) Here written
Tâkhmô-r*î*pô, Av. Takhmô-urupa; the great-grandson and successor of
Hôshâng (see Bd. XXXI, 2, 3, XXXI V, 4).

<span id="fn_96"></span>[27:3](sbe37016.htm#fr_97.md) Av. Yimô khshaêtô,
the *G*amshê*d* of the Shâhnâmah; the brother and successor of
Tâkhmô-rupô (see Bd. XXXI, 3-5 XXXIV, 4).

<span id="fn_97"></span>[27:4](sbe37016.htm#fr_98.md) Also called *Az*-î
Dahâk, Av. a*z*i*s* dahâkô, 'destructive serpent,' a name applied to a
foreign dynasty, considered as a single king who conquered Yim and
succeeded him, being traditionally his third cousin once removed (see
Bd. XXXI, 5, 6, XXXIV, 5). Further details are given in Bk. IX, Chap.
XXI, 1-13. Dahâk was the last ruler of all the seven regions, excepting
Kâî-Ûs.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[27:5](sbe37016.htm#fr_99.md) See Bd. XV, 26-28.

<span id="fn_99"></span>[27:6](sbe37016.htm#fr_100.md) Av. Thraêtaonô, son
of Athwyô, and, traditionally, the ninth in descent from Yim (see Bd.
XXXI, 7, 8); nine generations being assumed necessary to allow for the
thousand years’ reign of the Dahâk dynasty which he put an end to. His
rule was confined to the central region of Khvanîras.

<span id="fn_100"></span>[28:1](sbe37016.htm#fr_101.md) The land on the
southern coast of the Caspian belonging to the Mâzainya daêva (demons,
or idolators) of the Avesta.

<span id="fn_101"></span>[28:2](sbe37016.htm#fr_102.md) The last of whom
was slain by his brothers, and was avenged by his descendant
Mânû*sk*îhar (see Bd. XXXI, 9-I2).

<span id="fn_102"></span>[28:3](sbe37016.htm#fr_103.md) Possibly the
celebrated individual of that name who is mentioned, in Pahl. Vend. XX,
4, as an instance of opulence. The Shâhnâmah speaks only of the three
daughters of the king of Yaman.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[28:4](sbe37016.htm#fr_104.md) Or 'plundering;'
but Tû*g*-hômônd here, and Tû*g*âvand in § 12, may perhaps mean
'descended from Tû*g*,' as Frâsîy*âv* was the sixth in descent from
Tû*g* (see Bd. XXXI, 14).

<span id="fn_104"></span>[28:5](sbe37016.htm#fr_105.md) Said to have been a
great-grandson of Mânû*sk*îhar (see Bd. XXXI, 23).

<span id="fn_105"></span>[28:6](sbe37016.htm#fr_106.md) Probably the hero
who was sixth in descent from Tû*g*, and third cousin of Frâsîy*âv* (see
Bk. IX, Chap. XV; Bd. 26, 27); though placed by Firdausî as a king
Garshâsp preceding Kaî-Qubâd.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[28:7](sbe37016.htm#fr_107.md) As appears from Bd.
XXXI, 25.

<span id="fn_107"></span>[28:8](sbe37016.htm#fr_108.md) The son of Kâî-Ûs,
who did not become king.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[29:1](sbe37016.htm#fr_109.md) The people of the
Airya, Tûirya, and Sairima provinces, mentioned in Yt. XIII, 143.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[29:2](sbe37016.htm#fr_110.md) Fifth in descent
from Kavî-Kavâ*d*, and third cousin once removed of his predecessor
Kaî-Khûsrôî (see Bd. XXXI, 25, 28).

<span id="fn_110"></span>[29:3](sbe37016.htm#fr_111.md) Son of Kaî-Lôharâsp
(see Bd. XXXI, 29).

<span id="fn_111"></span>[29:4](sbe37016.htm#fr_112.md) The historical
legends contained in the Avesta end with the sons of king Vi*s*tâsp, and
other contemporaries of Zaratû*s*t; not a word being said of any
succeeding monarch. Similarly, Bd. XXXI and this historical Nask fail to
carry on the details of the royal line beyond Vi*s*tâsp; ignoring the
Achæmenians, Alexander, and the A*s*kânians, they leap over an evident
gap in history (very insufficiently bridged in the more modern chapter,
Bd. XXXIV) to the Sasanians. This gap, between Avesta legends and the
later undoubted Persian history, is a very weak point in the continuity
of the two periods. And as the mode of bridging over this gap in Bd.
XXXIV occurs in a chapter 'on the computation of years of the Arabs'
(see S.B.E. vol. v, p. xxxvii) it must be considered as more of an Arab
than a Persian contribution to history.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[29:5](sbe37016.htm#fr_113.md) Av. Naotara; a son
of Mânû*sk*îhar (see Bd. XXXI, 13, 23, XXX III, 5).

<span id="fn_113"></span>[29:6](sbe37016.htm#fr_114.md) Doubtful; if the
second name be a patronymic, the combination suggests the Yôi*s*tô yô
Fryânanãm of Yt. V, 8,, XIII, 120, regarding whom the tale of Yô*s*t-î
Fryânŏ is told. No son of <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> Nô*d*ar with a
corresponding name is known, so that we are not dealing with a complete
pedigree.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[30:1](sbe37016.htm#fr_115.md) Probably intended
for Spend-dad, and we should perhaps read 'Vohûmanô, son of
Spend-dâ*d*,' whose reign is celebrated as the silver age in Byt. II, 17
(see also Bd. XXXI, 29, XXXIV, 8).

<span id="fn_115"></span>[30:2](sbe37016.htm#fr_116.md) This name, or
surname, is given in Pâzand, and is also to be found in Yt. XIII, 106,
as follows: 'we reverence the guardian spirit of the righteous
Avarethrab*a*u, son of Râ*s*tare-vagha*nt*.' If the latter epithet were
a surname of Âtû*r*-pâ*d*, the famous prime minister of Shahpûhar II, as
the text intimates, we must conclude that the former epithet was a
surname of his only son, Zaratû*s*t, mentioned in his Pandnâmak. These
surnames, and others of their time, might have been easily interpolated
in the long list of uncouth names included in the Fravardîn Ya*s*t, when
the Avesta books were revised during the reign of Shahpûhar II, and the
Nasks were 'reckoned,' as stated in the fourth book of the Dinka*rd*
(see Haug's Essay on Pahlavi, pp. 146, 152).

<span id="fn_116"></span>[30:3](sbe37016.htm#fr_117.md) §§ 17-19 refer to
text which must have been written either in the time of Shahpûhar II, or
at some later period during Sasanian rule. Whereas §§ 1-16 are
descriptive of an older record which, though consistent with the extant
Avesta texts, could not have been compiled from them alone. And § 20
describes text that might have been written at any time.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[31:1](sbe37016.htm#fr_118.md) Reading vakhsh in
the same Avesta sense as in vakhshvar, 'a prophet;' it may, however,
mean 'gain, fortune, gifts.' A similarly-written word, vâyâ, 'air,
breath,' is used in Sg. XIII, 7 to translate the 'Spirit' of God in Gen.
i. 2.
