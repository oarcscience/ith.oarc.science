### CHAPTER V.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The fourth fargar*d*, Yânîm-manô <span
id="fr_506"></span>[1](#fn_503.md), is about where a gradual development
(dêr-zahî*s*nîh) *of* that which is for the future existence is best;
and, secondly, that which *occurs* now when the wisdom, instructed
eloquence, diligence, and energetic effort, which are the utilizers of
life, are with one, and these five misusers *of it*—greediness, want of
energy, indolence, defilement, and illicit intercourse—are not with one.
2. This, too, that these five defects existed in Dahâk <span
id="fr_507"></span>[2](#fn_504.md), and owing to that, moreover,
Frê*d*ûn <span id="fr_508"></span>[2](#fn_504.md) is irritated with *him*,
and smites him in revenge for Yim <span id="fr_509"></span>[3](#fn_505.md).

3\. About the heinousness of these four vices, which are drunkenness,
knavish companionship, apostasy, and selfishness, and the grievous
results therefrom. 4. And this, too, that Yim drove away these four
vices from the world, and then was able to prepare immortality. 5. About
avoidance of him who, through any statement, is producing a thief as an
orator (âkhûn), and *of* acquiescence with a hasty unoratorical
statement of a companion. 6. And this, too, that *he* who propagates
very evil commands in the world gives stout-heartedness to the fiend.

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

7\. About the clamour of a poor distressed *one for* a perfect remedy,
and the repelling derangement (lakhvâr-pafshîri*s*nîh),
unacceptableness, unblessedness, and want of Gâtha lore of the
distresser arisen from the clamour of the distressed *one*. 8. About the
connection of satisfying distress on true *and* reasonable complaint,
and the reasonable complaining of true complainers, by him who *has*
been an inferior judge, *and* gradually up to the highest adjudicator
who is Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

9\. The excellence *of* righteousness is perfect.
