<p>1. Praise <I>for</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and obeisance <I>to</I> the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshipping religion which is the ordinance of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> opposed to the demons.</p>  
<p>2. The eighth <I>book</I> is the present (latamman) memorandum about a summary of what is in the Nasks of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshipping religion, each separately. 3. That which is within the compass (sh&acirc;<I>d</I>-a&ucirc;rv&acirc;n) of this book, about the account of the good religion, is a writing for the information of the many, <I>and</I> an announcement from the commentary (zand)&#151;that which is in explanation of revelation (d&ecirc;n&ocirc;)&#151;which, for this simple (p&acirc;<I>d</I>ram) high-priest, is in itself the writing of the voice of revelation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>4. But, before that, is a writing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>of</I> the usage about the divisions (ban<I>g</I>i<I>s</I>n&#335;) of the reckoning of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshipping revelation, also the parts (b&acirc;har) of its divisions, and the sections (bur&icirc;nak&#335;) of the parts; <I>and</I> the exposition of the account&#151;</p>

<p>which, though very condensed, is in its division&#151;is <I>also</I> condensed in the parts of its division, and more diffuse in the sections of the parts. 5. The divisions of the reckoning of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshipping revelation are three:&#151;G&acirc;thas which are the higher spiritual knowledge <I>and</I> spiritual duty; Law which is lower&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> worldly knowledge and worldly duty; and the Hadha-m&atilde;thric which are mostly information and matters about what is between these two&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. And the reason of the triple division of the reckoning of revelation is the exposition of all knowledge <I>and</I> duty, and the kinds of knowledge and action <I>in</I> the same revelation are these three that <I>have been</I> written. 7. Also in the Ahunavair&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, which</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is the basis of the reckoning of revelation, are three metrical lines (g&acirc;s); the first chiefly indicates the G&acirc;thic lore, the second the Hadha-m&atilde;thric lore, and the third the Law.</p>  
<p>8. And there have been twenty-one parts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_27"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of its divisions, which are called Nasks:&#151;(9) Seven are G&acirc;thic, because they are composed for the G&acirc;thas,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and their names&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are that of the ritual of the G&acirc;thic worship, which is the St&ocirc;<I>d</I>-ya<I>s</I>t, <I>with</I> the S&ucirc;<I>d</I>kar, Var<I>s</I>tm&acirc;nsar, Bak&#335;, Va<I>s</I>tag, H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht, and that which has made them G&acirc;thic&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the Spend. 10. And the names of the seven Hadha-m&atilde;thric are D&acirc;md&acirc;<I>d</I>, N&acirc;<I>d</I>ar, P&acirc;<I>g</I>ag, Ra<I>d</I>&#335;-d&acirc;<I>d</I>-a&icirc;tag, Bari<I>s</I>, Ka<I>s</I>k&icirc;sr&ocirc;b&ocirc;, <I>and</I> Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp-s&acirc;st&ocirc;. 11. <I>And</I> seven are Legal, because they are composed for the lawyer (d&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;k), and their names are those of the legal, and those are the N&icirc;k&acirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;m, Ganab&acirc;-sar-ni<I>g</I>a<I>d</I>, H&ucirc;sp&acirc;ram, Sak&acirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;m, and Vend&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I>, and those which are composed for the law with separate dedications, the <I>K</I>itrad&acirc;<I>d</I> and Bak&acirc;n-ya<I>s</I>t. 12. And the sequence is S&ucirc;<I>d</I>kar, Var<I>s</I>t-m&acirc;nsar, Bak&#335;, D&acirc;md&acirc;<I>d</I>, N&acirc;<I>d</I>ar, P&acirc;<I>g</I>ag, Ra<I>d</I>&#335;-d&acirc;<I>d</I>-a&icirc;tag, Bari<I>s</I>, Ka<I>s</I>k&icirc;sr&ocirc;b&ocirc;, Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp-s&acirc;st&ocirc;, Va<I>s</I>tag, <I>K</I>itrad&acirc;<I>d</I>, Spend, Bak&acirc;n-ya<I>s</I>t, N&icirc;k&acirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;m, Ganab&acirc;-sar-ni<I>g</I>a<I>d</I>, H&ucirc;sp&acirc;ram, Sak&acirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;m, Vend&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I>, H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht, and St&ocirc;<I>d</I>-ya<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>13. In all three <I>divisions</I> all three are <I>found</I>; in the G&acirc;thic are the Hadha-m&atilde;thric and Legal, in the Hadha-m&atilde;thric are the G&acirc;thic and Legal, and in the Legal are the G&acirc;thic and Hadha-m&atilde;thric.</p>

<p>14. <I>In</I> each separately that which is essentially and specially itself is included, and that which is partly another and introduced is included; and the reason of it is <I>that</I> in spiritual and worldly <I>existences</I>, and in worldly and spiritual <I>existences</I>, and in that which is between the two, <I>there</I> are both <I>existences</I>.</p>  
<p>15. The occurrence <I>of</I> the joining of the Va<I>s</I>tag part of the G&acirc;thas on to the last of the Hadha-m&atilde;thric&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is because <I>it</I> is written in connection with the Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp-s&acirc;st&ocirc;, the last <I>of</I> the Hadha-m&atilde;thric. 16. The reason of the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht and Ya<I>s</I>t being in succession to the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I>, the last of the Law&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and 'the production of the worldly creations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>' <I>being</I> between the Hadha-m&atilde;thric <I>and</I> those spiritual G&acirc;thas, is because the spiritual <I>existence</I> likewise, which is spiritual life (ahv&ocirc;), is the beginning; and the worldly <I>existence</I> is purposed and caused, and a part is preserved (n&ocirc;<I>s</I>&icirc;-a&icirc;t&#335;), important for the purpose and intended for the spiritual life, the part at the beginning. 17. And the rejoining of the end of the Law, which is <I>about</I> the H&ocirc;m&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, to the G&acirc;thas, which are the beginning,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is a symbol of the existence of the pure influence of the G&acirc;thic lore upon the first spiritual state&#151;that <I>which</I> exists likewise at last&#151;and of the rejunction of the worldly existence to the spiritual, because it came down from the spiritual to exist at present.</p>  
<p>18. And the reason of the twenty-one-fold partition of the three divisions of the reckoning of revelation is in the distinction which is evident from <I>their</I> composition; also in the three metrical lines of the Ahunavair, which is the basis of the reckoning of revelation, there are twenty-one words (m&acirc;r&icirc;k). 19. As the three metrical lines of the Ahunavair, which is the basis of the reckoning of revelation, are an emblem of the triple division of the reckoning of revelation; so the twenty-one words of the three <I>lines</I> indicate the twenty-one-fold partition of these three divisions; as <I>it</I> is declared that 'He who is the omniscient creator produced a discourse from every single word.'</p>  
<p>20. <I>As to</I> the sections of the parts, such as the H&acirc;s and Fargar<I>d</I>s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the Nasks, <I>it</I> is known <I>there</I> were one thousand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, from the testimony <I>and</I> knowledge of the religion owing to the teaching of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&#151;<I>whose</I> guardian spirit is reverenced&#151;in the country of Ir&acirc;n. 21. And after the devastation occurred, owing to the evil-destined <I>and</I> raging villain Alexander, <I>there</I> was not so much of them</p>

And that which the saintly (h&ucirc;fravar<I>d</I>&#335;) &Acirc;t&ucirc;<I>r</I>-p&acirc;<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, son of M&acirc;raspend, achieved through their composition and preservation, is known so far as the decrees (<I>k</I>ak&#335;) in the treatises (m&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;g&acirc;n) of the country of Ir&acirc;n are preserved as teaching and admonition (pand&acirc;n&#335;).</p>  
<p>23. After writing of each separate Nask, that is, as to what it speaks about more particularly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, each Nask is accounted for separately, and what is in its various H&acirc;s <I>and</I> Fargar<I>d</I>s comes to be realized&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; for in these particulars (m&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;g&acirc;n) any ruggedness of the auspicious&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> <I>and</I> desirable collection is explained. 24. But, first, the class of writing of the various Nasks&#151;that is, about what they speak&#151;is here written; the extent of attainment not being adapted to <I>their</I> peculiarity of wonderfulness.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_22"></A><A HREF="sbe37004.htm#fr_22">3:1</A> The author means that he derives his information about the contents of the Nasks entirely from their Pahlavi versions which, so far as he is concerned, are of equal authority with the Avesta text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_23"></A><A HREF="sbe37004.htm#fr_23">3:2</A> This introductory chapter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_24"></A><A HREF="sbe37004.htm#fr_24">4:1</A> Or 'mostly,' if we read <I>a</I><I>v</I>&icirc;rtar, instead of <I>a</I><I>z</I>&icirc;rtar, as is done in the next clause of this sentence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_25"></A><A HREF="sbe37004.htm#fr_25">4:2</A> The three Pahlavi terms are g&acirc;s&acirc;n&#335;, d&acirc;<I>d</I>, and h&acirc;<I>d</I>ak-m&acirc;nsar&icirc;k. Of these d&acirc;<I>d</I> evidently means 'law,' because the D&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;k Nasks are chiefly devoted to legal matters (see Chaps. XVI-XLIV); and g&acirc;s&acirc;n&#335; appears to mean 'g&acirc;thas' rather than 'verses,' because the first G&acirc;s&acirc;n&icirc;k Nask contained the G&acirc;tha texts (see Chap. XLVI), the next three were commentaries upon the G&acirc;thas (see Chaps. II-IV and Bk. IX, Chaps. II-LXVIII), and the remaining three, so far as we are informed, were devoted to religious matters, but we have no reason to suppose that any of them were metrical, except the G&acirc;thas themselves. The exact meaning of h&acirc;<I>d</I>ak-m&acirc;nsar&icirc;k is less clear; it is derived from Av. hadha-m&atilde;thra, 'provided with spells, or inspired words,' a term applied to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t in V&icirc;sp. XIII, 1 and also to the M&atilde;thra-spe<I>n</I>ta, or liturgy, in a phrase (see Westerg. Z. A., p. 485) which is appointed to be used in certain parts of the liturgy whenever the Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp Ya<I>s</I>t (a remnant of the last Hadha-m&atilde;thric Nask) is recited; just as another phrase, referring to the Law, is appointed to be used in the same places whenever the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;<I>d</I> (one of the D&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;k Nasks) is recited. In what sense the Hadha-m&atilde;thric Nasks can be said to be 'provided with spells' is not clear from the details given in Chaps. V-XI, but, practically, the meaning of the term must be something like 'semi-religious,' being applied to philosophy and science which are neither strictly religious nor strictly secular.</p>  
<p>The same three terms were applied to the three classes of mankind, probably the priests, philosophers, and laity; a classification analogous to that of the three professions, the priests, warriors, and husbandmen, but not quite identical with it, as may be gathered from a passage in the sixth book of the Dinka<I>r</I><I>d</I> This book is <A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A> 'about an epitome, composed <I>and</I> preserved by those of the primitive faith, concerning the statements of the religion of Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worship;' and its statements are introduced by the following words:&#151;'Those of the primitive faith, who <I>were</I> the sages of the ancients, considered thus, &amp;c.' Near the middle of the book the following passage occurs:&#151;'And this, too, <I>was</I> considered by them thus, that these are the three species of mankind:&#151;One is the G&acirc;thic, one the Hadha-m&atilde;thric, <I>and</I> one the D&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;k. The association (ham&icirc;h) of him who is G&acirc;thic is with the sacred beings, <I>and his</I> severance (v<I>&icirc;</I><I>g</I>&icirc;-a&icirc;tag&icirc;h) from the demons <I>and</I> fiends; the extent of <I>his</I> wealth is due to members of the community and <I>religious</I> feasts (d&acirc;hm va-s&ucirc;r), and the punishment for the sin which he may commit is shame and is invisible. The association of him who is Hadha-m&atilde;thric is with the righteous, and his severance from the wicked; also the extent of his wealth is that which may be produced virtuously, and the punishment for the sin he shall commit is the goad, or scourge (see Chap. XLIV, 65 n); also. noxious creatures <I>for</I> the body, and compensating the destitute. And the association of him who is D&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;k is with Ir&acirc;nians, and his severance from foreigners; also the extent of his wealth is due to affairs that it is possible to accomplish lawfully, <I>and</I> the punishment for the sin which he shall commit is <I>for</I> the life<I>time</I> of a fowl (k&ucirc;k), the day of a demon.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_26"></A><A HREF="sbe37004.htm#fr_26">5:1</A> This information seems to be taken from the first fargar<I>d</I> of the S&ucirc;<I>d</I>kar Nask (see Bk. IX, Chap. II, 19). The Ahunavair (Av. ahuna vairya) is the name of the most sacred formula of the Parsis, derived from its second and third words; it is also called the Yath&acirc;-ah&ucirc;-vairy&ocirc;, from its first phrase, and is a declaratory statement in metre, consisting of one stanza of three lines, containing twenty-one Avesta words, as follows:&#151;</p>  
<p><DIR>Yath&acirc; ah&ucirc; vairy&ocirc;, ath&acirc; ratu<I>s</I> ash&acirc;<I>d</I>-<I>k</I>&icirc;<I>d</I> ha<I>k</I>&acirc;,<br> Vangh<I>e</I>us dazd&acirc; manangh&ocirc; <I>s</I><I>h</I>yaothanan&atilde;m angh<I>e</I>us mazd&acirc;i,<br> Khshathrem<I>k</I>&acirc; ahur&acirc;i &acirc;, yim driguby&ocirc; dada<I>d</I> v&acirc;st&acirc;rem.</DIR></p>  
<p>The usual Pahlavi version of this formula explains it as follows:&#151;<A NAME="page_6"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 6</FONT></A> 'As is the will of the spiritual lord (as is the will of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>) so should be the priestly master (so virtuous should he be) owing to whatsoever are the duties and good works of righteousness (the duties and good works should be as virtuous as the will of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>). Whose is the gift of good thought (that is, the reward and recompense that good thought gives, it gives also <I>unto</I> him) which, among spiritual lords, is the work of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> (that is, he would do that which A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> requires): [there are <I>some</I> who would say thus: Whose gift is for good thought (that is, the reward and recompense which they give for good thought, they give also unto him); <I>and</I> there are <I>some</I> who would say thus: Whose gift is through good thought (that is, the reward and recompense which they give up through good thought, they would also give even him); &Acirc;t&ucirc;<I>r</I>p&acirc;<I>d</I>, son of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, said thus: Owing to the gift of good thought, among spiritual lords, they recognise a doer of deeds. The dominion for A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is his (that is, his dominion exists through the advantage that A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> has maintained) who gives allotments (v&acirc;yag&acirc;n&#335;) to the poor (that is, he would make intercession for them).'</p>  
<p>The Avesta text may be translated, according to Haug, as follows:&#151;'As a spiritual lord is desirable, so is a priestly master, for the sake of every righteousness, <I>to be</I> a giver of good thoughts as to the actions of life towards Mazda; and the dominion is for the lord whom he (<I>Mazda</I>) has given as a protector for the poor.'</p>  
<p>According to Geldner the first two lines refer to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, and, if we assume that yim is a contraction of y&ocirc; &icirc;m, the Avesta text may be translated somewhat as follows:&#151;'As <I>he is</I> the desirable spiritual lord, so <I>is he</I> the priestly master with every right, the producer of the actions of the good thoughts of life towards Mazda. The dominion, however, is for Ahura who has given him as a protector for the poor.'</P>
