<p>beneficial creatures. 2. First, as to the spiritual existence, and how much <I>and</I> how is the maintenance in the spiritual <I>existence</I>; and the production of the worldly <I>existence</I> therefrom, qualified <I>and</I> constructed for descending (fit&ocirc;<I>d</I>an&#335;) into the combat with the destroyer, and accomplishing the associated necessity for the end and circumvention (garang) of destructiveness.</p>  
<p>3. The manner <I>and</I> species <I>of</I> the creation of the creatures; also their material <I>existence</I>, and the character and use of the races and species; and whatever is on the same subject. 4. The reason for <I>their</I> creation, and for <I>their</I> perfection at last. 5. About the adversity, injury, and misery of those creatures, and their secret (n&icirc;h&ocirc;n&#335;) resources <I>and</I> means of attacking <I>and</I> annihilating <I>them; with</I> the preservation <I>or</I> disablement (<I>a</I>p<I>&icirc;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;r&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>an&#335;) of the creatures thereby&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_58"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_57"></A><A HREF="sbe37008.htm#fr_57">13:6</A> Corresponding to the fourth word, ath&acirc;, in the Ahunavair, <A NAME="page_14"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 14</FONT></A> according to B. P. Riv.; but it is the fifth Nask in other Riv&acirc;yats. D&acirc;md&acirc;<I>d</I> means 'the creatures produced,' and it is called Dv&acirc;zdah-h&acirc;m&acirc;st (or hum&acirc;st) in the Riv&acirc;yats, which also state that it contained thirty-two kardah, or subdivisions. No further particulars of this and the subsequent Nasks are given by the Dinka<I>r</I><I>d</I>, beyond the contents of this eighth Book.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_58"></A><A HREF="sbe37008.htm#fr_58">14:1</A> So far as this brief account of the D&acirc;md&acirc;<I>d</I> goes, it corresponds very well with much of the contents of the Bundahi<I>s</I>. Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam, in his Selections, IX, 1, 16, also quotes the D&acirc;md&acirc;<I>d</I> as the authority for certain details contained in the Bundahish, which work must therefore be considered as derived from this Nask. It is very probable, however, that the Nask contained much more information than is here hinted, because the author's usual plan, in these brief summaries, is evidently to confine his remarks to a few of the details near the beginning of each Nask.</P>
