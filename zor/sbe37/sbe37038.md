### CHAPTER XXXV.

*Hûspâram Nask*.

1\. One section *contains* particulars about the science (dâni*s*nŏ) of
seeking a son, advice about it from revelation (dênô), the advantage of
offspring for the admonitory explanation of revelation within *one's*
self, *and* the harm owing to neglecting the advice of the same.

2\. About what *happens* in the begetting of a son; the first sexual
excitement it should produce for the female, the second, third, fourth,
*and* fifth; the arising of a son in the world, *and* also the milk,
owing to *her* impregnation. 3. And, when *it is* so that it amounts to
a son, which of the *two*, male *or* female, is sooner emitting the
germs at the time *of* occurrence; *and* how *and* how long both *have*
remained, at the time, in semination, how long in connection, and how
long in bleeding. 4. When *and* wherefrom various expectations are
produced to contend *about*, and when and by what signs the male sex, or
female sex, of the offspring *has* become manifest.

5\. When the localization <span id="fr_280"></span>[1](#fn_279.md)
regarding *it* is arranged; and, *as to* the members, which is the first
member therein, and *their* being produced, each consecutively, till the
bodily form is complete; which, *and* in what position, is the
localization of the members after the complete production of the form of
the body, *and* the purpose as regards the position *and* localization
of the members after the complete production *of* the

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

form of the body. 6. The effect upon the offspring which is *furnished*
with subjection to the male, so far as the complete effecting of it is
within the limit for its authorisation <span
id="fr_281"></span>[1](#fn_280.md); the time (vidanâânag <span
id="fr_282"></span>[2](#fn_281).md) of the offspring with the female, the
period of its turning downwards for birth, *and* the occurrence of birth
*at* the same time.

7\. About the growth of life, too, with the bodily organs (tanûgân);
*and* which is the first bone become possessed of marrow, *apart* from
the other bones, as it is reported. 8. About the admissibility of the
elaboration *of* the male sex, *or* female sex, within it, *by* the
guardian spirit of the righteous, at the fifth month; and the ceremony
for the guardian spirit of the righteous for the sake of the arrival of
a male child.

9\. About the act of childbirth by a pregnant woman before *recourse to*
midwifery (dâigânîh), except that relating to the navel string of the
child; also its first and second food, and when the midwifery is *that*
of her mother; what is the kind of milk, *and* the care of the child at
the time, *its* bandaging, sleeping, nourishment, and protection; *and*
the sin owing to acting unlawfully in such matters. 10. About how many
months is the bearing of the offspring in the womb *of* the camel,
horse, ass,

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

cow, and woman; and whatever is on the same subject. 11. About the
spiritual perception *of* a newborn child, *and its* coming into the
boundaries of worldly comprehension on the same subjects.

12\. About the habits through which multitudes *of* mankind *attain* to
the acme of beautiful form: that of desire for women, that of swiftness
which is owing to the strength of the leg, and that of powerfulness
which is owing to the vigour of the body, that of desire for wealth,
that of speaking in an assembly, and that of speaking at a distance,
that through which *any one* uncontrolled comes to a downfall, that
through which *there is* more knowledge of obedience, *and* that through
which a counteraction of the affliction of the race arises.

13\. About the vicious desire of the performer *and* permitter of
unnatural intercourse; also their violent lustfulness, heinous practice,
and corrupt, polluted bodies, blighted in destiny; great through their
destruction of life in the things which they see, and every greatness
inevitably provides *them* a merited death; *as* great in sinfulness as
*Az*-î Dahâk <span id="fr_283"></span>[1](#fn_282.md) in oppression, *as*
the serpent Srôbar <span id="fr_284"></span>[2](#fn_283.md) in witchcraft,
*as* Tûr-î Brâ*d*rô-rêsh <span id="fr_285"></span>[3](#fn_284.md), the
Karap <span id="fr_286"></span>[4](#fn_285.md), in destroying the

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

righteous, *and as* a deceiving apostate in falsehood. 14. About the
grievous sinfulness of a woman, just delivered and giving milk, whose
progeny is the offspring from intercourse with divers males, and
whatever is on the same subject.

15\. About the increasing vigour *of* the female from the mounting of
the male, and the diminished vigour of the male from mounting *on* to
the female.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_279"></span>[109:1](sbe37038.htm#fr_280.md) Assuming that
gêsî-hastanŏ stands for gâsî-hastanŏ in all three occurrences of the
word. This is rather doubtful, because the noun gâs, 'position,' occurs
twice in close connection with the uncertain word, and is correctly
spelt.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[110:1](sbe37038.htm#fr_281.md) The Pahl. text is
as follows:—'Kâr-î madam zâkŏ-î levatman dên ku*s*n s*p*ar, vad *sp*ôr
kârîh zya*s* dên sâmân pa*d*a*s* ra*d*akîh.'

<span id="fn_281"></span>[110:2](sbe37038.htm#fr_282.md) This unusual
hybrid word is evidently intended as a Zvâri*s* equivalent of the
Irânian zamânah, and is composed of vidanâ (= Ch. ‏עִדָּנָא‎, which is
the usual Zvâri*s* for zamân) + ânag (= ânah, the final syllables of
zamânah). The central syllable of zamânah is, therefore, twice
represented in the Zvâri*s* vidanâânag. The hybrid occurs again, in Bk.
IX, Chap. XVII, 3, in a phrase where it can only mean 'time, period.' If
it were not for this after-occurrence, the word here might be read
va-dô-ahûg, 'and the dual existence,' with some degree of probability.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[111:1](sbe37038.htm#fr_283.md) See Chap. XIII, 8
n, and compare the account of the seven special evil-doers in Dd. LXXII,
3-9.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[111:2](sbe37038.htm#fr_284.md) The Av. a*z*i
srvara of Yas. IX, 11 (W.), Yt. XIX, 40; a terrible serpent slain by
Keresâspa the Sâman, as mentioned again in Bk. IX, Chap. XV, 2.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[111:3](sbe37038.htm#fr_285.md) Also written
Brâ*d*rôk-rêsh; he was one of the Tûrânian priesthood who persecuted
Zaratû*s*t in his youth, and probably the same as Pers. Bartarûsh (the
Brâ*d*ar-vakhsh of Sd. IX, 5) who is said to have killed Zaratû*s*t in
the end. But, as he was one of five brothers, three of whose names were
much alike (see Byt. II, 3 n), his identification is rather uncertain.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[111:4](sbe37038.htm#fr_286.md) Av. karapan. In
Dk. Bk. VII the Karaps are often mentioned <span id="page_112">p.
112</span> as enemies of Zaratû*s*t, both before and after his birth.
Some are named, such as Dûrâsrôb, Brâ*d*rôk-rêsh, Vaêdvôi*s*t, and
*G*êshmak. The Karap of the district where the mother of Zaratû*s*t was
born banishes her for witchcraft, and must, therefore, have been the
official head of the district. Dûrâsrôb, the Karap, travels sometimes
with a disciple (hâvi*s*t), so his title was probably a priestly one.
The Karap is also often mentioned with the Kaî, or Kîk (Av. kavan or
kavi), the title of an equally obnoxious class; both Kîks and Karaps
being termed 'demon-worshippers,' or idolators; and the Pahlavi
translators of the Avesta speak of them, metaphorically, as 'blind and
deaf' to the sacred beings.
