### CHAPTER XL.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The seventeenth fargar*d*, Spe*n*tâ-mainyû <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[5](#fn_1068), is about *this*, that Aûha*r*ma*zd*
produced the creatures through wisdom, *and* maintains *them* in truth.
2. This, too, that the best thing <span
id="fr_1079"></span>[6](#fn_1069) *for* every one is thought in a
high-priest who is the tongue of a spiritual lord <span
id="fr_1080"></span>[7](#fn_1070); in a high-priest, who *has* to
maintain thought, no appliances of the body *are* to lie unto the
spiritual lord on account of affection *for* the

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

worldly *existence*. 3. Also that the spiritual lord is always true; of
the tongue—when he (*the priest*) speaks falsehood with the tongue—are
those words which he does not believe through the spiritual lord, and
*it is* owing to this, too, when, of all the body, the tongue first
dies. 4. 'I say unto thee, *O* Spîtâmân! that thou shouldst speak with
the tongue just as thou thinkest with the mind, and thou shouldst
accomplish work with both hands in complete mindfulness <span
id="fr_1081"></span>[1](#fn_1071).' 5. And this, too, that he who shall
act thus is sagacious, and he is the father of righteousness through
wisdom <span id="fr_1082"></span>[2](#fn_1072); and whoever would do
that which has happened, thoroughly observes *it* on account of that
*which* has not happened. 6. Also this, *that* in the person of him who
shall do that which he understands, *and* asks again about that which he
does not understand, the propitious spirit of wisdom is lodging.

7\. About cattle *being* produced for the assistance *of* mankind, and
the pastures of pleasure for the assistance *of* cattle <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[3](#fn_1073). 8. This, too, that the archangels
injure the evil demon and wicked people, *but* they do not injure
righteous people <span id="fr_1084"></span>[4](#fn_1074) and the sage.
9. This, too, *is said*, namely: 'In scanty opulence do not murmur (a*l*
mang) owing to good works <span id="fr_1085"></span>[5](#fn_1075), *and*
thus in great opulence much good work arises.' 10. This, too, that
beneficence gives all to the good, *and* it is no further the villain
whom the sacred beings maintain <span id="fr_1086"></span>[6](#fn_1076).

11\. About the tongue *of* a true speaker *being* given for the
satisfying (vi*g*âri*s*nŏ) of disputants,

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

*and for* declaring who is acquitted *or* incriminated; and the ordeal
that is a demonstrator, to acquit *or* convict, which he whose tongue is
truthful *has* accepted—and it shall make his statement current—has
developed its jurisdiction in the world, *and* diminished distress. 12.
*And* this, too, *is said*, that he gives out fire for disputes, so that
it may make manifest the acquitted and incriminated, when he in whom are
his immense complete mindfulness, and also righteousness, is guardian of
the ordeal; and, when many inspect it, that which is the ritual of the
ordeal believes them wicked <span id="fr_1087"></span>[1](#fn_1077).

13\. Perfect is the excellence of righteousness.
