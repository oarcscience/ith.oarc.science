### CHAPTER XVII.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The sixteenth fargar*d*, Spe*n*tâ-mainyû <span
id="fr_633"></span>[2](#fn_628), is about effecting the
bridge*-judgment* of sinners, as declared by revelation. 2. About
performing the ceremony (ya*s*tô) for a man and a woman, and it is
ordered *for* the woman before the man; the fitness for the supreme
heaven (garô*d*mânîkîh) arisen through the liturgy (ya*s*tô) to be
recited itself, or *through* purchasing *heaven in* the worldly
*existence* <span id="fr_634"></span>[3](#fn_629).

3\. About the immunity of the soul from hell through the righteousness
*of having* respectfully given a horse of a *good* race, the land of a
cultivated field, *or* a virtuous woman, to a righteous man; and also
the woman who gives herself in marriage to

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

the righteous man; and that liberal good work increases *from* time *to*
time <span id="fr_635"></span>[1](#fn_630), and *from* day *to* day.

4\. About the bridge *penalty* of him who is a mourner (navînî*d*âr) and
*self-*wounder in the three nights *after a death, and* how *it is* as
though *they* who are living *should* again pour melted ore on a human
being. 5. About the punishment for a woman who gives herself in marriage
to a righteous man, *and* comes away <span
id="fr_636"></span>[2](#fn_631) from him; such as when a hedgehog <span
id="fr_637"></span>[3](#fn_632) should be constantly going in and coming
out by her sexual organ; and the cutting off of her way from the best
existence. 6. About the non-deliverance of a soul of the wicked from
hell till the future existence. 7. About the punishment of the wicked
*there is* this, too, *it is* as though a sheep which is alive should be
remaining tied by the legs, head downwards, and *there* should be a
specific exudation of its toes through running at the nose <span
id="fr_638"></span>[4](#fn_633).

8\. About the Gâthas for an ordeal <span id="fr_639"></span>[5](#fn_634)
of the spiritual *existence*, which is concealed in every mode, *being*
without a footing (*a*p*â*-pâstakŏ), as it were, for him who is a
righteous chanter of the Gâthas.

9\. The excellence *of* righteousness is perfect.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_628"></span>[204:2](sbe37066.htm#fr_633) The first two
words of the first hâ of the third Gâtha (Yas. XLVII, 1), which are
converted into the Pahlavi appellation S*p*endmaîtŏ.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[204:3](sbe37066.htm#fr_634) By providing for
the performance of the proper ceremonies for the benefit of one's own
soul.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[205:1](sbe37066.htm#fr_635) Pahl.
vidanâânag vidanâânag, a hybrid equivalent of zamânak zamânak (see Bk.
VIII, Chap. XXXV, 6 n).

<span id="fn_631"></span>[205:2](sbe37066.htm#fr_636) B has 'relapses.'

<span id="fn_632"></span>[205:3](sbe37066.htm#fr_637) Compare AV. LXX.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[205:4](sbe37066.htm#fr_638) Pahl. *a*fas
angûstô zahîh-1-i mâyagânîk pavan vînîk-ta*g* *aê*. For mâyagânîk,
'specific' (which occurs, however, in Bk. VIII, Chap. XX, 166), we can
read mâsânîk, 'tumerous or coagulating,' or we may consider it
equivalent to mûyi*s*nîk, 'lamentable.'

<span id="fn_634"></span>[205:5](sbe37066.htm#fr_639) Compare the
reference to the ordeal by fire in Pahl. Yas. XLVI, 6; the earlier part
of the chapter is also somewhat of a homily upon the references to the
wicked and righteous in the same hâ.
