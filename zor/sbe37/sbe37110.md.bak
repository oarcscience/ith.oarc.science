### CHAPTER LXI.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The fifteenth fargar*d*, Kamnamaêza <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[1](#fn_1409.md), is about the reply of Aûha*r*ma*zd*
to Zaratû*s*t, as to that which *was* asked by him thus: 'To which lands
do I step <span id="fr_1443"></span>[2](#fn_1410.md)?' *and* it is *thus:*
'Do thou march (sagîtûn) there where the man, in whose person
righteousness is *connected* with complete mindfulness, is welcome;
this, too, is where happy is he from whom there is no complaint.'

2\. This, too, that mankind are made diligent in good works by him who
produces progress for good works; even for this reason, because mankind
attain progress *in* manifest duty who engage more particularly *in*
good works. 3. This, too, that the teaching of religion is the public
action which is prescribed by him who would produce exertion for the
righteous, that is, benefit for those of the good religion; even for
this reason, because the multitude (kabedân) approach the religion, and
are taught and practise *it*, on account of a desire *for* benefit. 4.
This, too, that *it is* in a province of even exhausted production <span
id="fr_1444"></span>[3](#fn_1411.md) that it is taught by him who appoints
a virtuous governor over the province; even for this reason, because a
virtuous governor of a province becomes a teacher of ability and good
works to those of the province.

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

5\. This, too, that the good protection of fire <span
id="fr_1445"></span>[1](#fn_1412.md) is taught by him whose words are
through Vohûman, *and* who also would provide a time for the ordeal of
that which is doubtful; even for this reason, because *he* whose words
are utterable through Vohûman, *and* who would provide a time *for* the
ordeal of that which is doubtful, teaches the provision of care *for*
the operative fire, owing to that *which occurs* when *what is*
accomplished, about one acquitted *or* convicted *by* the fire, is
declared, *and* mankind shall provide more particularly for the
brilliancy of the fire, and the wicked more *for* assistance and
protection from it.

6\. This, too, that whoever shall provide about him who liberally gives
*him*self in discipleship <span id="fr_1446"></span>[2](#fn_1413.md) unto
the priests, has thereby taught even by the mention of the high-priest;
even for this reason, because the person *being* given in discipleship
unto the priests, the religion practised by the high-priest arises also
*for* mention, *and* whoever shall provide generosity for that person,
has increased *and* also taught that action, which is religion, even by
the mention made. 7. This, too, that men and women <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[3](#fn_1414.md) are taught *as being* given in
discipleship <span id="fr_1448"></span>[4](#fn_1415.md) to Zaratû*s*t by
him who keeps his own males and females in the control of Zaratû*s*t. 8.
This, too, that goodness is taught by him to those (valman) who are
good, so that they produce it who give to that righteous *one* the
worthiness which is through that wealth; the righteous *one* who is
worthy is *one* of the good religion for whose production of the
worthiness which is through that wealth it is sought, and that wealth
which is

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

coveted is wealth of little trouble *and* much advantage, through the
goodness and idea of virtue of the giver to the account of him who is
the accepter of the good worthiness. 9. This, too, that through his
*K*inva*d* passage (*K*i*s*-vi*d*arg) it is taught that they shall step
forth (frôvâmând) <span id="fr_1449"></span>[1](#fn_1416.md); *and* by him
who goes on through anything (*k*is) openly, when he *has* proceeded
publicly on the right path, *one* passed *away* on the *K*inva*d*
passage is taught.

10\. This, too, that by him whose ceremonial is through complete
mindfulness it is taught that the world produces abundance through
complete mindfulness <span id="fr_1450"></span>[2](#fn_1417.md); even for
this reason, because it is taught by him, through that disposition of
his *for* the sacred beings (pavan zak-1 valman ya*zd*ânŏ khîm), *that*
the developed world is shown *to be* theirs; *and* here *below* it is
fully taught by him, *that* Khû*r*da*d* and Amû*r*da*d* <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[3](#fn_1418.md)—that is, the sacred beings—produce
*it* for the benefiters. 11. This, too, that thus he who is wicked, even
he who is privileged, becomes unprivileged at that time when every one
understands, that is, when righteousness is aloft. 12. This, too, that
when he who is privileged is Vi*s*tâsp <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[4](#fn_1419.md), likewise he who is privileged is the
righteous Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_1453"></span>[5](#fn_1420.md), *and* so
he who is the wicked Ar*g*âsp <span id="fr_1454"></span>[6](#fn_1421.md) is
unprivileged.

13\. This, too, that creation is taught by him to

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aûha*r*ma*zd*, so
that he creates, and this, too, that the archangels are taught by his
will, whose contentment <span id="fr_1455"></span>[1](#fn_1422.md) is
through that of the archangels, so that he observes the conclusion in
the affairs of the archangels. 14. And this, too, that wisdom is taught
to him who is Zaratû*s*t—so that it becomes his—by him whose thoughts
are for Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_1456"></span>[2](#fn_1423.md) *and* for the
religion of Zaratû*s*t.

15\. Perfect is the excellence *of* righteousness.
