### CHAPTER VII.

1\. The Pâ*g*ag <span id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60.md) *contains*
particulars about lawfully slaughtering a sheep, for the ceremonial of
fires, waters, *and* holy-water, in aid of a season-festival <span
id="fr_61"></span>[3](#fn_61.md) *of* the Ma*zd*a-worshippers; besides
this, namely, in what are the skill, and the means for selection, of a
man for such work, and the formula (nîrang) of the ceremony. 2. And
this, namely, from which limb of the sheep species is the

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

share *of* the fires and waters to be taken <span
id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md), *and* how is the preparation which is to
be carried on, *and* with what Avesta. 3. And whatever is about a
season-festival; where the appointed place is, when one celebrates *it,
and* when it has fully elapsed; the assembly of the season-festival, and
the donation for the feast; where and when the celebration is possible,
in what proportion the provisions are to be given out, *and* when to be
prepared *and* divided; where its advantage is, *and* what benefit
*there* is from it to the good creations both spiritually and
materially.

4\. And this, namely, what skill is more suitable for the sacerdotal
(ra*d*-pî*s*ag) leadership *and* other priestly authority (ra*d*îh) each
separately. 5. About the business *of* the sacerdotal leadership, where
*it is* owing to *having* appointed the place and *having* gone forth to
the assembly of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, *and* when *they are* to be
made aware that that assembly is more particularly for the arrangement
of renunciation of vice and retribution for sin; the needful supply of
things for the feast; the selection of the men for the Zôti duty *and*
Râspî duty before the day <span id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_63.md); the
Zôtis, Râspîs, and others who put in action the work for the preparation
*and* giving of the portions; *and* the cleansing of the body-clothing.
6. *As to* the selection *of* the president (pê*s*-gâs) of the feast
*there* is this, namely, what ability is requisite for that
presidentship. 7. The allotment of the portions, and giving *them*
sooner to *those* who are sooner in need *of them*. 8. Scoffing before

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

priestly authorities, *who are* great *and* good, *and* when they do not
give a portion to the authorities are *cases when* the season-festivals
are not to be considered as celebrated. 9. This, too, that the Zôtis and
Râspîs are for the Zôti duty *and* Râspî duty, *and* the other priestly
authorities for the control of sin and computation (*âv*âr) of the
portions; and more on the same subject.

10\. About the rotation of the day-watches (gâs), days, months, and
seasons of the year—which are when *it* is summer *and* winter—and the
appearances (sahî*s*nŏ) therein which are owing to the motion of the
constellations <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md). 11. Where the coming
of the righteous guardian spirits (fravâhar) into the worldly *existence
occurs*, in those ten days which are the end of the winter *and*
termination of the year, because the five Gâthic days <span
id="fr_65"></span>[2](#fn_65.md), among them, are for that purpose; the
cessation of that same, as well as its continuance. 12. The great
needfulness *of* the guardian spirits of the righteous in the ceremonial
*and* obeisance of those ten days, *and* their abundant gratification
therefrom; their vexation from

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

want of welcome and want of obeisance; and *their* ascent from the
worldly existences. 13. The extreme importance (fr*êv*ŏânîkîh) *of*
liberality and bounty at that season; and the proper duty *of* the
priestly authority of a district (shat*r*ô) in assisting and interceding
for the poor, for the sake of teaching, from the days devoted to the
guardian spirits, *proper* actions among those having guardian spit its.

14\. About the period for taking medicinal plants, and whatever is on
the same subject. 15. About where *there* is a household, village,
communal, *or* provincial petitioning *for* the royal chastisement *of*
sins affecting the soul, each separately; *and* for whom is the
atonement. 16. About the advantage owing to disposal of sin and
infliction of chastisement, and the harm owing to not disposing of sin
and neglecting the chastisement inflicted.

17\. About the first thirty-three chieftainships (ra*d*îh), around *and*
concealed; that is, which *and* how many are spiritual, *and* how many
worldly; and which is the second, and which the third, of the spiritual
*and* worldly *existences*. 18. About the admirableness and great
meritoriousness *of* public observances, and the awfulness and grievous
sinfulness *of* apostasy. 19. And also this, that is, when any one is
doubtful, through apostasy, which is the law from the sacred beings in
elucidation, and which of the sacred beings is to be entreated for
assistance. 20. About this, namely, *for* which of the women the
bringing of a handful of anything, from the property *of her* husband,
*to be* given away is allowable, in what proportion, and how, *and* for
whom; and for whom, when she gives *it* away, *it* is allowable *for*
the husband to bring *it* back.

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

21\. About this, namely, when summer comes on, where does winter run to;
and when winter comes on, where does summer go to? 22. About the amount
of disaster <span id="fr_66"></span>[1](#fn_66.md) *that* has passed by in
one century, and the duration of *its* passing; everything which is
connected with the disaster, and whatever is on the same subject. 23.
Where *and* how many months are of such a kind <span
id="fr_67"></span>[2](#fn_67.md) *and* how many of such a kind <span
id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_67.md); as well as the religious names of the
twelve months, and the reason of the name of each one of them, that is,
to which of the sacred beings, in the ceremonial, each one of these
twelve months is predominantly appertaining; so also of the thirty days
which are in every month, and so also of the five Gâthas in every
*year*—that is, the five Gâthic days at the end of the year <span
id="fr_69"></span>[3](#fn_68.md)—all the sacred beings *to whom they are*
appertaining, and when the righteous guardian spirits (ar*d*âî
fravar*d*ŏ) are reverenced.

24\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_60"></span>[15:2](sbe37010.htm#fr_60.md) Corresponding to the
sixth word, ashâ*d*, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it
is the seventh Nask in other Rivâyats. Pâ*g*ag probably means 'cooking,'
with reference to the preparations for the sacred feasts; it is called
Pâ*g*am, Pâ*k*am, or Pâzûn in the Rivâyats, which also state that it
contained twenty-two kardah, or subdivisions.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[15:3](sbe37010.htm#fr_61.md) The six Gâhanbârs or
season-festivals are held on the five days ending, respectively, with
the 45th, 105th, 180th, 210th, 290th, and 365th days of the Parsi year
(see Sls. XVIII, 3 n).

<span id="fn_62"></span>[16:1](sbe37010.htm#fr_62.md) The heart for the
fires, and the fore-legs for the waters, according to Sls. XI, 4.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[16:2](sbe37010.htm#fr_63.md) The Zôti is the chief
officiating priest in the ceremonial, and the Râspî is the assistant
priest.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[17:1](sbe37010.htm#fr_64.md) That is, the
*apparent* motions of the akhtarân, or signs of the zodiac.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[17:2](sbe37010.htm#fr_65.md) The five
supplementary days, named after the five Gâthas, which are added to the
twelfth month of thirty days to complete the 365 days of the year. They
are also called fravar*d*îkân, or 'those devoted to the Fravar*d*s,' or
Fravashis, the guardian spirits, or prototypes, of created beings, who
are supposed to revisit their old haunts on earth during those days. The
last five days of the twelfth month are also considered a part of the
same festival of ten days, which would have terminated at the vernal
equinox, as indicated in the text, about A.D. 1000 if the ordinary
receding calendar of the Irânian Parsis were used; but it seems
probable, from Bd. XXV, that the calendar in those times was fixed for
the new year to begin at the vernal equinox.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[19:1](sbe37010.htm#fr_66.md) Pâz. vôighn.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[19:2](sbe37010.htm#fr_68.md) Reading hamgûn in
both places; but the two words may be hamînô, 'summer,' and khamînô,
'wet weather.'

<span id="fn_68"></span>[19:3](sbe37010.htm#fr_69.md) The five
supplementary days mentioned in § 11.
