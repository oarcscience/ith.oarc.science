### CHAPTER XIX.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The eighteenth fargar*d*, A*d*-mâ-yavâ <span
id="fr_644"></span>[5](#fn_639), is

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

about the pregnancy of the demon from him who *has* eaten *and*
chattered in sinfulness *towards* Khû*r*da*d* and Amû*r*da*d* <span
id="fr_645"></span>[1](#fn_640), or who makes water *when*
standing <span id="fr_646"></span>[2](#fn_641)) or who heedlessly sees
*his* semen. 2. And the hussy <span id="fr_647"></span>[3](#fn_642) who
spills (gûyê*d*ŏ) anything after sunset (hûk-frâshmôk-dâ*d*), *or* who
scatters a morsel (dânar) *of* food to the north, *at* night, without a
recitation of the Ahunavair <span id="fr_648"></span>[4](#fn_643).

3\. This, too, that only the soul is constantly desirable for the body,
even through this alone, that this perishable body <span
id="fr_649"></span>[5](#fn_644) \[is a worldly state of righteousness,
and, by rousing up (lâlâ-payami*s*nîh) <span
id="fr_650"></span>[6](#fn_645) when thou wouldst sleep on, the
righteousness\] is on the advance when thou wouldst have retreated; and

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

the righteousness, in arising, is like thee in every coming *and*
departure; through fetching *and* delivering the breath it shall become
good reward, abundant reward, and the reward of righteousness. 4. When
the body shall act so, the soul is rejoiced *and* shall utter a blessing
for the body thus: 'Happy may it be *for* thee, O perishable body! whom
I have made tall, *and* whom I have brought near to the best existence.'
5. And when the body shall not accept the progress (*a*frâs) of the
soul, and says *it is* evil progress on rousing up, evil progress on
advancing, \[and evil progress upwards, the soul is a demon\]' and shall
offer \[lamentable\] <span id="fr_651"></span>[1](#fn_646) words thus:
'Evil *art* thou, O perishable body! whom I made dwarfish (ga*s*ûk),
*and* whom I have brought near to the worst existence.'

6\. About where *there are* unaccustomed (avê*s*akŏ), imperfect, and
secret signs of short life, and the healthfulness *of* uttering the
Ahunavair <span id="fr_652"></span>[2](#fn_647) *and* Ashem <span
id="fr_653"></span>[3](#fn_648) for it. 7. This, too, that, when thou
wouldst squat for making water, thou recitest the Ahunavair, and the
Ashem, afterwards, when thou wouldst stand up; so that *any* demon, *or*
fiend, shall least injure thee. 8. And when thou wouldst go in unto
*thy* wife (nârîk), thou recitest first the Ahunavair, and the Ashem,
afterwards, when thou wouldst be coming together <span
id="fr_654"></span>[4](#fn_649); for so thou wouldst be making that,
too, *which* arises—which is thy son—more righteous and

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

more successful through the Ashem. 9. This, too, that, when thou wouldst
go into a house, thou shouldst be offering homage, and do thou utter the
Ahunavair, *for* the spirit of the house and *for* every*thing* of the
material *existence* of the righteous which is and was and *will* be in
that dwelling.

10\. Also about the corruption (tava*s*tanŏ) of the wicked, and the
calamity (sûr) which is unjustly distributed by them in the realm <span
id="fr_655"></span>[1](#fn_650).

11\. Excellence *that is* perfect is righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_639"></span>[206:5](sbe37068.htm#fr_644) The first three
words of the third hâ of the third Gâtha (Yas. XLIX, 1), here written
a*d*-mâ-îyûbŏ in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[207:1](sbe37068.htm#fr_645) Av. haurvatât,
'completeness, or health,' and ameretât, 'immortality;' the archangels
who have special charge of water and plants, respectively (see Sls. XV,
25-29), and are said to be injured by the sin of talking while eating
and drinking those things (see Chap. IX, 2).

<span id="fn_641"></span>[207:2](sbe37068.htm#fr_646) Thereby polluting
more ground than is necessary (see Sls. X, 5).

<span id="fn_642"></span>[207:3](sbe37068.htm#fr_647) See Chap. XI, 5 n.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[207:4](sbe37068.htm#fr_648) K does not mention
the latter sinful action. The reason of the sin of such actions is that
they may be considered as offerings to the demons (who are supposed to
come from the north and to be powerful at night) unless protected by the
Ahunavair (see Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 7) used as an exorcism (see Sd. XXX,
1, 2; Sls. X, 7, XII, 18).

<span id="fn_644"></span>[207:5](sbe37068.htm#fr_649) B has 'even
through the assertion that this is corporeal and perishable.' The
passage in brackets occurs only in K.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[207:6](sbe37068.htm#fr_650) This appears to be
the most probable reading of the word which occurs again in § 5, where
it is written lâlâ-ûpayami*s*nîh in K, which form is also found in Hn.
I, 23, where it translates Av. ustryamnô. For the latter member of this
compound see also Chap. XX, 6, 7. For the syllable yam we might
substitute gam or *g*am without much alteration of meaning, or even dam
if we translate by 'fanning up, exciting.'

<span id="fn_646"></span>[208:1](sbe37068.htm#fr_651) The words in
brackets are omitted in K.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[208:2](sbe37068.htm#fr_652) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. I, 7.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[208:3](sbe37068.htm#fr_653) See Chap. III, 1;
here, and in §§ 7, 8, it is expressed by Pahl. aharâyîh,
'righteousness,' being an abbreviation of its usual appellation, 'praise
of righteousness,' in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[208:4](sbe37068.htm#fr_654) Pahl. 'amat andarg
hakhtô vadîdûnâñ *aê*.'

<span id="fn_650"></span>[209:1](sbe37068.htm#fr_655) Like Yas. XLIX
this fargar*d* begins with special references to the wicked, and returns
to them towards the end.
