<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 155. This, too,

167\. Perfect excellence is righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_172"></span>[53:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_173.md) It is not clear
whether these twenty-four particulars are to be sought in the details of
§ 1, or in the whole chapter, or some portion of it.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[53:2](sbe37023.htm#fr_174.md) Merely a guess.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[54:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_175.md) Compare Pers.
bi*s*ing, Av. fshaoni. In some cases it might perhaps be read pîkhvô,
and be traced to Av. pithwa. The word often occurs, as in § 11, Chaps.
XXIII, 3, 15, XXVI, 10, XXVII, 4, 6, XXXI, 25, 36, XXXVII, 5, 7, 22,
XLI, 19, 23, XLIII, 19, and its meaning, 'provision, or nourishment,' is
well ascertained.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[55:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_176.md) One married to her
husband with the parents’ consent, and never betrothed to another, so
that she and her children belong to him in both worlds (see Bd. XXXII, 6
n).

<span id="fn_176"></span>[56:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_177.md) The relative
lengths of these five measures of distance are stated in Farh. Oîm, p.
41, ll. 9-11, as follows:—'So much as two Dashmêst (Av. dakhshmaiti) is
as much as a Yû*g*yast (Av. yu*g*yasti); so much as two Agoyôhast is as
much as a Dashmêst; so much as two Ta*k*ar is as much as an Agoyôhast;
*and* so much as two Hâsar (Av. hâthra) is as much as a Ta*k*ar (Av.
ta*k*ara).' As the average Hâsar is a Roman mile (see Chap. XIX, 54 n),
the Ta*k*ar ('run?') is two, the Agoyôst or Agoyôhast ('cattle-run?'
<span id="page_57">p. 57</span> Av. gaoyaoiti?) is four, the Dashmêst
('distance-mark?') is eight, and the Yû*g*yâst ('stage?') is sixteen
miles. This series of distances is analogous to the Sanskrit series, but
more elaborate; the Hâsar is best compared with the Kro*s*a as the
commonest unit of moderate distance, though less than half its usual
length; the Agoyôst is nearly the same as the Gavyûta; and the Yû*g*yâst
is analogous to the Yo*g*ana, though nearly double its length.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[57:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_178.md) That is, on the
first or second day of the Parsi month; and to the other on the third
day.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[58:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_179.md) See § 11 n.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[58:2](sbe37023.htm#fr_180.md) A slave no doubt.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[58:3](sbe37023.htm#fr_181.md) This is the
technical term for legal seizure, or sequestration (see Chap. XXXIX).

<span id="fn_181"></span>[59:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_182.md) See Chap. XVII, 6.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[60:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_183.md) Or it may be 'to
provide supplies.'

<span id="fn_183"></span>[60:2](sbe37023.htm#fr_184.md) See Chap. XIX, 47.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[61:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_185.md) Pâz. aôganghen for
Av. aoganghem = ao*g*anghem (see also Chap. XLI, 17, 18).

<span id="fn_185"></span>[62:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_186.md) The decision
announced at the *K*înva*d* bridge (see Chap. XIV, 8), as to the fate of
the soul until the renovation of the universe, after the account of its
good works and sins has been accurately balanced.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[62:2](sbe37023.htm#fr_187.md) Farh. Oîm, p. 36,
ll. 6, 7, has 'when through sinfulness one lays a weapon upon a sinner,
the name is Aredû*s*.'

<span id="fn_187"></span>[62:3](sbe37023.htm#fr_188.md) See Chaps. XVII, 6,
XIX, 1.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[62:4](sbe37023.htm#fr_189.md) Whereby a person
becomes an outcast and worthy of death. According to Vend. IV, 67-72,
75-78, 81-84, this occurs on the eighth committal of an Âgêreptŏ, on the
seventh of an Avôîri*s*tŏ, and on the sixth of an Aredû*s*; or on the
first committal of any of the three, if the criminal refuses to atone
for it.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[63:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_190.md) Eighty minutes on
the average (see Chap. XIX, 54 n), but varying from one hour to two,
according to the duration of daylight.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[63:2](sbe37023.htm#fr_191.md) That is, from the
scriptural law and its commentary.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[63:3](sbe37023.htm#fr_192.md) That is, according
to precedents recorded by the priesthood.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[64:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_193.md) This term is
explained in an extract from some Nask (compare Chap. XLIII, 9) quoted
in Farh. Oîm, pp. 17, l. 9-18, l. 5, as follows:—'*Av*. kô asti
*d*kaêshô vivi*s*dâtô, which is the judge who is acquainted with the
law? *Av*. yô aêta pairi arethra frazânaiti, he who thoroughly
understands the adjudication from the statements \[even though he does
not easily understand many of the statements, and though *it be* not
easy as regards the statements which are not numerous, is an official
who is acquainted with the law (ka*rd*âr-î âkâs-dâ*d*); *and he* who
does not thoroughly understand the adjudication from the statements,
even though the statements are not numerous, and *it be* not easy *for
him* as regards *them*, is to be still considered as unacquainted with
the law (anâkâs-dâ*d*)\].'

<span id="fn_193"></span>[64:2](sbe37023.htm#fr_194.md) Compare § 115.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[65:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_195.md) The minimum and
maximum grades of value mentioned in Chap. XIX, 47. Here it is evident
that mîdat and mozd are synonyms, the former being, no doubt, the
Zvâri*s*, or Semitic, equivalent of the latter, compare Chald. ‏מִדַּה‎.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[65:2](sbe37023.htm#fr_196.md) Pahl. khâkûnîhâ,
literally 'through making a dust.'

<span id="fn_196"></span>[65:3](sbe37023.htm#fr_197.md) Or it may be 'of a
man *and* a woman who is domineeringly plundered.'

<span id="fn_197"></span>[66:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_198.md) That is, in some
very easy way. The intention was probably to discourage petty disputes
between man and wife, by not interfering with the stronger party when
aggrieved.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[67:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_199.md) See Chap. XVII, 6.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[67:2](sbe37023.htm#fr_200.md) See § 65.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[67:3](sbe37023.htm#fr_201.md) Reading dêv-vi*g*în
which is miswritten <span id="img_06700"></span> ![](img/06700.jpg).

<span id="fn_201"></span>[67:4](sbe37023.htm#fr_202.md) See Chap. XIX, 54
n.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[67:5](sbe37023.htm#fr_203.md) A distance of four
Hâsars (Bd. XVI, 7), or as far as a far-seeing man can distinguish a
black ox from a white one (Bd. XXVI, 2). It is usually from 3½ to 4
English miles, but in Pahlavi texts it often stands for a Hâsar, or
Roman mile, both being measures for long distances.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[67:6](sbe37023.htm#fr_204.md) Or 'rations'
(vâyagân).

<span id="fn_204"></span>[68:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_205.md) Compare § 79.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[69:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_206.md) In hell (compare
AV. XL, 7).

<span id="fn_206"></span>[69:2](sbe37023.htm#fr_207.md) Pahl. mar’*z*ânân,
which might be supposed to be a defective writing of margar’*g*ânân,
'those worthy of death' (the two letters equivalent to rga being
omitted), but see Chap. XXI, 13.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[69:3](sbe37023.htm#fr_208.md) The MS. pâk is
evidently a defective writing for na*v*âk which is written correctly in
the next clause of this section.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[70:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_209.md) The Persian
monarch.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[71:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_210.md) Vâmkûnîh, compare
Pers. bâmûn. It cannot be 'making loans, or money-lending,' because that
would be spelt *âv*âmkûnîh.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[72:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_211.md) The angel of
justice who weighs the good works of the departed soul against its sins,
in order to decide its fate till the end of time.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[73:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_212.md) Here written
Hâ*d*ôîtô; the name of the twentieth Nask (see Chap. XLV).

<span id="fn_212"></span>[74:1](sbe37023.htm#fr_213.md) The name of the
eleventh Nask (see Chap. XII).
