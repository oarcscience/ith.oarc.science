### CHAPTER XXII.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The twenty-first fargar*d*, Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti <span
id="fr_701"></span>[3](#fn_696.md), is about where the best prayers <span
id="fr_702"></span>[4](#fn_697.md) of the good religion *are:* unto
Mit*r*ô <span id="fr_703"></span>[5](#fn_698.md) once every night for
dismissing and lessening Wrath *in* the whole world, *and* a second time
*for doing so with* Lethargy; a third *unto* Srôsh <span
id="fr_704"></span>[6](#fn_699.md) the righteous, and the fourth is the
Dâhmân *Â*f*rî*n <span id="fr_705"></span>[7](#fn_700.md) for further gifts
and increasing gifts; and the most

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

preservative of them was the Dâhmân *Â*f*rî*n. 2. And this, too, that
the most admirable of shapes of women *was* Hûmâî <span
id="fr_706"></span>[1](#fn_701.md) of the noble family of Vi*s*tâsp, of
horses the splendid horse of Vi*s*tâsp, of oxen the male ox
Barmâyûn <span id="fr_707"></span>[2](#fn_702.md), of sheep the very much
celebrated <span id="fr_708"></span>[3](#fn_703.md) sheep that is fat,
white-jawed, *and* star-spotted, *with its* upper half in a manufacture
(pa*s*akhtakŏ) embroidered with gold and the topmost part yellow; and
yet not one of them attains an equality to even a single thousandth
*part* of the glory of a righteous man, a member of the community, by
whom the Dâhmân *Â*f*rî*n of the good *is uttered*. 3. And this, too, as
much as *its* goodness for the man and *his* wife is *its* evil *for* a
villain and *his* paramour <span id="fr_709"></span>[4](#fn_704.md).

4\. About the exercise of sovereignty *by* Kâî-Ûs <span
id="fr_710"></span>[5](#fn_705.md), with triumph, over the earth of seven
*regions;* the advancement of his commands, by the people of the
creation <span id="fr_711"></span>[6](#fn_706.md), more swiftly than a wave
of the hands; the construction of his seven dwellings (mân) <span
id="fr_712"></span>[7](#fn_707.md) in the midst of Albûr’*z* <span
id="fr_713"></span>[8](#fn_708.md), one of gold, two of silver, two

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

of steel, and two of crystal (*âv*gînakînŏ); the restraining of the many
Mâzônîk demons <span id="fr_714"></span>[1](#fn_709.md) who are the ruin of
the world, and confining *them* to their own duty; the arrival at those
dwellings of his, and the swift winding (v*â*fînî*d*anŏ) around those
dwellings, of a person whose strength is overpowered by decrepitude, and
the approach of *whose* life to departure from the body *has* taken
place; the reduction (khûsânî-hastanŏ) of the decrepitude thereby, and
the return of his strength and manhood, that is, a command is given by
him thus: 'Keep no people away at the door!' and he might make a
domestic of fifteen years *of age*.

5\. Afterwards, the consultation of the demons about the death of
Kâî-Ûs, and the coming of Aeshm <span id="fr_715"></span>[2](#fn_710.md) to
Kâî-Ûs, approving his death, and, therefore, making *him* wretched in
his mind *about* the great sovereignty which *was* possessed by him over
the seven lands, and causing him to long for the sovereignty *of* the
heavenly region (asâmânŏ gâs) of the archangels <span
id="fr_716"></span>[3](#fn_711.md). 6. And, owing to the seductiveness of
Aeshm, and the other demons who remained his co-operators for that
undoing, Kâî-Ûs *was* even *engaged* in opposing and molesting the
sacred beings. 7. Also his not returning across Albûr’*z*, *but* rushing
upwards, with many demons and wicked people, unto the *outer* edge of
darkness <span id="fr_717"></span>[4](#fn_712.md);

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

*and* the reason *of* the glory of the Kayâns <span
id="fr_718"></span>[1](#fn_713.md) becoming a figure of clay on that
border. 8. The previous separation (madam rê*g*î-hastanŏ) of Kâî-Ûs from
the troops, and *his* not turning from that ill-advisedness even on
renewed strife aloft <span id="fr_719"></span>[2](#fn_714.md) *with* the
supreme sacred beings. 9. Afterwards, the creator's calling back the
glory of the Kayâns to himself, the falling of the troops of Kâî-Ûs to
the earth from that height, and the flying of Kâî-Ûs to the wide-formed
ocean <span id="fr_720"></span>[3](#fn_715.md).

10\. This, too, it says, that, besides him, some one <span
id="fr_721"></span>[4](#fn_716.md) flew behind him, thus associated with
him; *and* after him flew Nêryôsang <span
id="fr_722"></span>[5](#fn_717), the promoter (frê*h*-dâ*d*âr.md) of the
world, for diverting that person *from* him. 11. And the cry of him, the
unborn Khûsrôî, who *was* thus associated with him, like that of a
regiment (s*i*pâh) a thousand *strong, was* thus: 'Thou shouldst not
smite him, *O* Nêryôsang, promoter *of* the world! for if thou shouldst
smite this man, *O* Nêryôsang, promoter *of* the world! *there will* not
be afterwards obtained, for acquirement, a

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

thorough destroyer *of* the high-priest of Tûrân <span
id="fr_723"></span>[1](#fn_718.md); because owing to this man *will* be
born *him whose* name is Sîyâvakhsh <span
id="fr_724"></span>[2](#fn_719.md), and owing to Sîyâvakhsh I *shall* be
born, who am the Khûsrôî who *will* entice the most heroic <span
id="fr_725"></span>[3](#fn_720.md) *one* of Tûrân—who is mostly the
destruction of champions and troops—to the numerous heroes of the
religion, so that I *may* accomplish the destruction of his champions
and troops, when <span id="fr_726"></span>[4](#fn_721.md) I would occasion
a distant flight of the sovereign of Tûrân.' 12. Through these words the
guardian spirit of Khûsrôî delighted Nêryôsang, the promoter *of* the
world; and, on these words, *the latter was* releasing him and that
Kâî-Ûs who thereby became discreet.

13\. Perfect is the excellence *of* righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_696"></span>[219:3](sbe37071.htm#fr_701.md) The appellation of
the fifth Gâtha (Yas. LIII) which begins with the words vahi*s*tâ
î*s*ti*s*; it is here written vahi*s*tôk-î*s*tŏ in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[219:4](sbe37071.htm#fr_702.md) The Pahlavi
explanation of Av. vahi*s*tâ î*s*ti*s*.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[219:5](sbe37071.htm#fr_703.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. XLIV, 16.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[219:6](sbe37071.htm#fr_704.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. IX, 3.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[219:7](sbe37071.htm#fr_705.md) 'The blessing of
members of the community.' The Dahmân Âfrînagân consists of Yas. LX, 2-7
with Âf. I, 14-18; but the Âf*rî*n is another formula, otherwise called
'the Âf*rî*n of the seven Ameshâspends,' and it is uncertain which of
the two is meant here.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[220:1](sbe37071.htm#fr_706) Av. (gen..md)
Humay*a*u of Yt. XIII, 139.

<span id="fn_702"></span>[220:2](sbe37071.htm#fr_707.md) See Chap. XXI, 22.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[220:3](sbe37071.htm#fr_708.md) Reading
frêh-ôkhtar (for frêh-ôkhttar), as Bd. XXIV, 3 states that 'the black
sheep which is fat and white-jawed is the chief of sheep.' It might be
'the sheep of Frashôkhtar,' and this name might be a miswriting of
Frashô*s*tar, but we have no record of any such sheep of his.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[220:4](sbe37071.htm#fr_709.md) It is easy to
trace a connection between §§ 1, 2 and Yas. LIII, 1, and between § 3 and
the Pahl. version of Yas. LIII, 6 a.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[220:5](sbe37071.htm#fr_710.md) Av. Kava Usa (see
Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 13).

<span id="fn_706"></span>[220:6](sbe37071.htm#fr_711.md) K has 'by demons
and men.'

<span id="fn_707"></span>[220:7](sbe37071.htm#fr_712.md) Probably the
origin of the legends of the seven halting-places of Rustam and
Isfendiyâr in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[220:8](sbe37071.htm#fr_713.md) Here meaning the
mountain-range south of the Caspian (see Chap. XX, 3).

<span id="fn_709"></span>[221:1](sbe37071.htm#fr_714.md) Av. Mâzainya
daêva, the idolators of Mâzendarân.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[221:2](sbe37071.htm#fr_715.md) The demon of wrath
(see Bk. VIII, Chap. IX, 3 n).

<span id="fn_711"></span>[221:3](sbe37071.htm#fr_716.md) §§ 5-9 are
evidently a summary of the original form of the legend of Kâvûs's
attempt to reach the sky, otherwise described in the Shâhnâmah.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[221:4](sbe37071.htm#fr_717.md) Where the endless
light commences. Reading par-i tom; or it might be 'to the utmost,' if
we read frêtum as equivalent to frêhtûm.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[222:1](sbe37071.htm#fr_718.md) K omits 'of the
Kayâns.' It is the royal glory of Yt. XIX, which descended from heaven
and accompanies the faithful rulers and champions of the religion,
successively (see Chap. XXIV, 3).

<span id="fn_714"></span>[222:2](sbe37071.htm#fr_719.md) B has 'pitying
strife;' khv*â*parîk being written instead of *av*arîk.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[222:3](sbe37071.htm#fr_720.md) Meaning the
Caspian, as in Chap. XXI, 17.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[222:4](sbe37071.htm#fr_721.md) It will be seen,
from what follows, that this was the fravashi, or guardian spirit, of
his future grandson, Kaî-Khûsrôî. Every being and object belonging to
Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s creation is supposed to have its spiritual
representative, created before the universe and perpetually existing
(see Bd. I, 8; Mkh. XLIX, 23).

<span id="fn_717"></span>[222:5](sbe37071.htm#fr_722.md) Av. Nairyôsangha,
an angel who is supposed to be the usual messenger of Aûha*r*ma*zd* to
mankind (see Byt. III, 25, 26, 59, 60). K has only 'besides him *and*
behind him flew Nêryôsang.'

<span id="fn_718"></span>[223:1](sbe37071.htm#fr_723.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. XIII, 15.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[223:2](sbe37071.htm#fr_724.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. XIII, 14.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[223:3](sbe37071.htm#fr_725.md) A single
particular hero appears to be meant, although this is not quite certain.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[223:4](sbe37071.htm#fr_726.md) Assuming that mûn,
'who,' stands for amat, as in Chap. XIII, 2.
