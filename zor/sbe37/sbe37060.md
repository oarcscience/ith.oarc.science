### CHAPTER XI.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The tenth fargar*d*, Yâ-*sh*yaothanâ <span
id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_546), is about the complaint of the spirit of
fires to Aûha*r*ma*zd* owing to seven descriptions of people. 2. First,
owing to domestics considering *it* as contemptible and *in* an
unresisting state (a*g*angîh), molesting *it* immoderately, and making
use of it with unwashed hands; also the damsel who *has* introduced fire
into the sole of *her* foot, and the bursting of the blister (âvilag);
and a weapon brought out into *its* splendour. Second, the complaint
owing to the carriers of fire from that abode \[where the provision of
care for fire is as a law to them, to that abode\] <span
id="fr_551"></span>[2](#fn_547) where the provision of care for fire is
not as a law to them. 4. And there, owing to the arrival and preparation
of the demons, it lay stupefied, like a powerful youth *who is* feverish
and in a languid state; and its cure from that sickness (ayôyakîh) was
by bringing forward to it their pure sandalwood, or benzoin, or
aloe-wood, or pomegranate <span id="fr_552"></span>[3](#fn_548), or

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

whatever *there* was of the most odoriferous of plants. 5. Third, the
complaint owing to the hussy <span id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_549) unto
whom it happens, through menstruation, *that* the stench and filth owing
to the menstruation is brought to it (*the fire*); and *its* sickness
and stupefaction owing thereto are as written above. 6. Fourth, the
complaint owing to the hussy who, dropping *her* knee on to the
fire-stand, arranged *her* curls; the falling of damp and moisture from
*her* head, with the hair and filth therefrom, into the fire; the
consumption *of it* discontentedly, *and* the sickness and stupefaction
owing thereto. 7. Fifth, the complaint owing to the father, *or*
guardian, of a child for not keeping the child away from the fire; and
the bodily refuse and other unlawfulness that come upon it from such
children. 8. Sixth, the complaint owing to the adversity which the
unpurified infidel (agdênô) may bring upon it, by blowing the breath of
*his* mouth upon it in directing *its* use, *and* it becomes
incalculable. 9. Seventh, the complaint—which, *one* says, is more awful
and more grievous—owing to those who use it as an ordeal for a
falsehood, and, when it is made evident thereby as to the acquitted and
convicted, they become of a different opinion about it.

10\. At the place of complaint that which is polluted is put forward
together with that which is pure, and the increase of it (*the fire*) is
through lawful and unlawful operation; *its* burning alone

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

and increasing are such as when both would be as a necessity for it, and
undesired and rapid burning and increasing <span
id="fr_554"></span>[1](#fn_550) are those which are polluted by burning
*and* insatiably consuming; and in that which is an operation
unlawfully—the burning alone *and* increasing *being* \[such as
when\] <span id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_551) both would be as a
necessity \[for it\]—the increase is troubled.

11\. This, too, he <span id="fr_556"></span>[3](#fn_552) says: 'I am not
*of the world* here, and from here I *will* extricate *myself*, from the
earth up to the sky; I am also thy son <span
id="fr_557"></span>[4](#fn_553), more to thee <span
id="fr_558"></span>[5](#fn_554) than any of the other creatures.' 12.
And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke to him thus: 'So thou shouldst stand over the
fire, in thy proper duty as \[a spirit <span
id="fr_559"></span>[6](#fn_555)\], carrying that club; \[it is a
substantial means, because I produce it, through which\] thou turnest
off \[the whole bodily existence\], some to the endless light, and some
to the endless darkness.'

13\. This, too, that *he* who shall provide care for, fire has paid the
greatest reverence unto Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 14. The propitiation of the
righteous is the best *thing*, and their vexation is the worst; when
pleased they favour one, *and it is* the law of the sacred beings that
they promote; \[when vexed they wound, *and it* is the demon that they
restrict.

15\. It is righteousness *that is* perfect excellence.\] <span
id="fr_560"></span>[6](#fn_555)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_546"></span>[186:1](sbe37060.htm#fr_550) The first two
words of the seventh, and last, hâ of the first Gâtha (Yas. XXXIV, 1),
here written yâ-shyâôsnŏ in Pahlavi in both MSS. This fargar*d* may
perhaps be considered as a homily upon Yas. XXXIV, 4.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[186:2](sbe37060.htm#fr_551) The words in
brackets are omitted in B by mistake.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[186:3](sbe37060.htm#fr_552) The traditional
equivalents of the four sweet-scented vegetable substances, Av. urvâsna,
vohû-gaona, vohû-kereti, and hadhâ-naêpata, which are mentioned in Vend.
VIII, 2, 79, IX, 32, XIV, 3, <span id="page_187">p. 187</span> XVIII, 71
as acceptable fuel for the sacred fire, or scent for fumigation; their
Pahlavi names are merely corruptions of these Avesta words.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[187:1](sbe37060.htm#fr_553) The word *g*êh,
'courtezan,' is used here and in § 6 merely as a general opprobrious
term for a woman.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[188:1](sbe37060.htm#fr_554) As in the case of
a destructive conflagration.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[188:2](sbe37060.htm#fr_555) The words in
brackets are supplied by guess, to fill up a blank space left by the
repairer of B on one of his patches. In K the passage is shorter, and
stands as follows:—'and in that which is unlawful operation *it is*
troubled by the increase.'

<span id="fn_552"></span>[188:3](sbe37060.htm#fr_556) The spirit of
fires mentioned in § 1. This dialogue seems to be a quotation from the
original Pahlavi version of the Nask.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[188:4](sbe37060.htm#fr_557) Fire being called
'the son of Aûha*r*ma*zd*.'

<span id="fn_554"></span>[188:5](sbe37060.htm#fr_558) Both MSS. have
'me' by mistake.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[188:6](sbe37060.htm#fr_560) The passages in
brackets are omitted in B, evidently by mistake.
