### XXI. STÔ*D*-YA*S*T NASK <span id="fr_1840"></span>[1](#fn_1790).

It has been already shown, in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLVI, 1 n, that the whole
of this Nask is probably still extant in the Yasna and Vîspêra*d*. About
half of the present Yasna appears to consist of five-sixths of this
Stô*d*-yast, to which have been added three

fargar*d*s of the Bakŏ (Nask III), with the Hôm and Srôsh Ya*s*ts,
extracted probably from the Bakân-ya*s*t (Nask XIV), and the greater
part of the Âta*s* and Âbân Nyâyi*s*es; the whole collection being
provided with an introductory and concluding ritual, compiled from other
sources, to form the complete ceremonial liturgy of the present Yasna.

There appears to be no sufficient evidence, either internal or external,
for ascribing this collection of the liturgy to so late a date as the
end of the ninth century, when the compilation of the Dinka*rd* was
completed. It is therefore safer, for the present, to assume that the
Stô*d*-ya*s*t existed for a long period as a separate Nask (the form
described by the Dinka*rd*), even after the greater part of its text had
been incorporated with others to form the collected liturgy now known as
the Yasna.

Besides the fragments which are specially attributed to particular
Nasks, there are also a few writings which closely resemble the Nasks,
or their fragments, in general character, but which can hardly be traced
to their actual source by means of the accounts given in the Dinka*rd*.
Thus, the Aogemadaê*k*â might perhaps be supposed to have been extracted
from the Bari*s* (see Dk. VIII, Chap. IX, 18), if it did not contain a
few Avesta quotations from the Yasna, Vendîdâ*d*, and Ya*s*ts. While the
quotations from the Ashem-staota, given in Vi*g*. pp. 89, 90, 125-129,
177, 178, are difficult to trace, owing to the name of their source.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1790"></span>[487:1](sbe37149.htm#fr_1840) The actual
extent of those portions of the Yasna and Vîspêra*d* which appear to
have constituted this Nask, may be estimated at about 12,500 Avesta and
22,400 Pahlavi words.
