### CHAPTER LXVII.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. *In* the twenty-first fargar*d*, Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[5](#fn_1477.md), it is proclaimed by the righteous
Zaratû*s*t, that the ceremonial is performed by him owing to whom our

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

worship is good thinking. 2. This, too, that Vohûman and the liturgy are
lodging in the body of him in whose body the religion is lodging; *and
so is* the spirit of goodness, which is peace (pa*d*mân). 3. This, too,
that the good religion is taught in word and deed by him who shall
achieve the giving of thought (mîni*s*n-dahîh) *to* Vohûman *in* the
ceremonial. 4. This, too, that the archangels become lodging in the body
of him who loves Vohûman; even for this reason, because their lodging is
in light, purity, and perfume, and the body is illuminated, purified,
and perfumed by Vohûman.

5\. This, too, that mankind are made diligent in the performance of good
works by him who shall provide gifts for the doers of good works. 6.
This, too, that by him who loves the beneficial way <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[1](#fn_1478.md), even others are put *in* the same way
*and* taught. 7. This, too, that he gives his daughter in daughterhood
to *his* fatherhood <span id="fr_1518"></span>[2](#fn_1479.md), who teaches
to the daughter reverence towards *her* father; even for this reason,
because she is made steadfast in daughterhood by him. 8. This, too, that
the authority of Vohûman is taught by him who keeps the talent which is
his for virtue; even for this reason, because from the authority of
goodness arise the advantage *and* freedom from strife of the sciences
(hûnarânŏ).

9\. This, too, that a daughter is given to a father for womanly service
(nê*s*manîh <span id="fr_1519"></span>[2](#fn_1479).md), *and* so also a
wife to another man, by him who teaches reverence, towards father and
husband, to the daughter and the other woman; and so, too, *by him* who
instructs

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

the wife of a man in housewifery; because the advantageous womanly
service of a woman *for* a man arises through reverence towards *her*
husband and good training in housewifery. 10. This, too, that even the
reverence *of* a wife towards a husband is produced by him *who* gives a
woman unto a man; because the giver of possession (khû*d*îh) becomes
praiseworthy even by the act of *having* given that possession.

11\. This, too, that origin and effect (bûn va-bar) are produced for
Aûha*r*ma*zd* by him who gives *what* is necessary unto Aûha*r*ma*zd*
and teaches perpetual preservation; *what* is properly necessary *being*
the origin of the preservation *which is* the effect of *what* is
properly necessary. 12. This, too, that dominion is acquired for the
house of him who keeps the door of the house an opening for the wise;
the house *being* the body, *and* the door of the house *being* the ear,
eye, and mouth.

13\. It is the excellence *of* righteousness *that is* perfect.
