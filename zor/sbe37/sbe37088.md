### CHAPTER XXXIX.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. *In* the sixteenth fargar*d*, Kamnamaêza <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[3](#fn_1018), about departure to any land
whatever <span id="fr_1028"></span>[4](#fn_1019), in renewed search *of*
fortune, *there is* also this, namely: 'Do not stay *away*
discontentedly from this thy ceremonial and obeisance, O Zaratû*s*t!
through love of us, when they do not satisfy thee—*neither* thy own, nor
the confederate, nor the companion, nor the serf, nor the wicked
tyrant <span id="fr_1029"></span>[5](#fn_1020)—by whom those who are
demons are *wont* to be worshipped. 2. And where and when thou art far
from us, even then do not stand aloof from our affairs; and also when
the affairs of the worldly *existence* shall not stand well for thee,
even then thou shouldst reverence us and shouldst pay us homage.' 3. So
also this, that the wish *of* the evil spirit is thus: 'Thou shouldst
not reverence and shouldst not pay homage to the archangels; and
here <span id="fr_1030"></span>[6](#fn_1021) *the people* shall possess
neither lordship, nor priestly instruction—that is, ruler and

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

high-priest—and their desire is not *for* perfect righteousness.'

4\. And this, too, *is said*, namely: '*Of* the contracted <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[1](#fn_1022) spirituality and deficient
wealth <span id="fr_1032"></span>[2](#fn_1023), owing to the little
progress of men who are self-gratifiers, thou art aware, *O* Zaratû*s*t!
*thou* who art no seeker *of* this—that is, this want of opulence of
thine—because thou dost not know *it* <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[3](#fn_1024); *but* I perceive those words of
complaint of thine, of which I demand an account from thee <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[4](#fn_1025).' 5. And this, *too*, namely: 'Thou
art aware *of* the gratification of desire <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[5](#fn_1026) *by* us who are archangels, and
*which* we give for the gratification that thou bringest forth
(zihi*h*); we also give thee the liberty which a friend gives to him who
is a friend <span id="fr_1036"></span>[5](#fn_1026).'

6\. About *what* occurs in *future* ages <span
id="fr_1037"></span>[6](#fn_1027): the experienced (arvandân) who are
beneficial through teaching *and* practising wisdom <span
id="fr_1038"></span>[7](#fn_1028), and the thirst of youths is increased
by them; by the assistance of complete mindfulness they improve the
world of righteousness and produce distress for the fiend; and the
advantage due to virtue extends to them <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[8](#fn_1029). 7. And this, too, that he who is
evilly oppressive has died off through his own deeds <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[9](#fn_1030). 8. About always opposing villains
with as much strength as exists, so that he who is a good ruler <span
id="fr_1041"></span>[10](#fn_1031), whose high-priest is the bounteous
liturgy (Mânsars*p*end), may become predominant <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[11](#fn_1032) over Wrath.

9\. About the praise of the renovators *there* is this,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

too, namely: 'Blessings on good understanding *and* also on Mit*r*ô,
whose punishment of sinners they shall inflict for this consideration,
that *he is* intelligent *and* friendly (mit*r*ô-pân) <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[1](#fn_1033).' 10. And, about adjudication *as to*
a kinsman (naf*s*man) of any one whatever, *there* is this, too, namely:
'Through a revival of Rashnû, whoever is righteous and also whoever is
wicked—that is, every one—is to be kept for judicial investigation <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[2](#fn_1034).' 11. This, too, namely: 'A kinsman is
to be considered as virtuous <span id="fr_1045"></span>[3](#fn_1035), by
whom his own soul is preserved from wickedness <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[4](#fn_1036).' 12. *And* this, too, namely: 'So thy
high-priest is he whose own religion is pure <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[5](#fn_1037).'

13\. About the characteristics of the fiend, the broken-down (khastakŏ)
Mânih <span id="fr_1048"></span>[6](#fn_1038),and the destruction of the
wicked who *were* listening to him, that which came from him who *was*
monarch. 14. And this, too, namely: 'The wicked *one*, who gives my
world to that which the malicious <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[7](#fn_1039) Aharman has established *as* supremacy
(lâlâîh), is he who is a self-wounding <span
id="fr_1050"></span>[8](#fn_1040) demon that is set going for the death
of the world of righteousness which he praises. 15. The ceremonial

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

of righteousness is not such as that he praises, *O* Zaratû*s*t! the
priestly authority of the worldly settlements (gêhânân) that he mentions
thus: "In priestly authority and high-priestship I *am* better (sapîr)
*and* am better suitable;" and not so, *O* Zaratû*s*t! is that excretion
(mûtri*s*nŏ) <span id="fr_1051"></span>[1](#fn_1041) he stirs up for
mankind; that *which* he mentions to them becomes a perpetual effusion
from him, and they who stirred up the excretion afterwards think it
theirs, *and* that which is a perfect ceremonial of the demons occurs.
16. Through the opposing arrival *of* Srôsh <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[2](#fn_1042), the righteous, the ruler is in
vexation with that person; that ruler who is a protection of these
*others* through good emanation <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[3](#fn_1043)—not through evil living—and at every
time a distresser *of* the wicked <span
id="fr_1054"></span>[4](#fn_1044).'

17\. About the peculiarity of attracters *to* the religion, *and* the
good works of those attracted <span id="fr_1055"></span>[5](#fn_1045).
18. About the signs of the last times, which *are* the millenniums of
the sons of Zaratû*s*t.

19\. This, too, that they cause disturbance (aâramênd) unto the
sovereignty, and *they* who are Kaîs and Karaps <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[6](#fn_1046), those even who are the most
evil-ruling in the country—who by villanous deeds are those *who*
destroy the existence of mankind through statements, and destroy their
own souls <span id="fr_1057"></span>[7](#fn_1047)—*also* destroy the
material world which, confused by them,

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

is more beloved than righteousness; even the sovereignty is a scanty
shelter, among the existences, from those whose command is villanous,
when they produce *that* which is vicious and deliver their pupils
(âmûkhtagânŏ) to that which is *their* end (*a*fdûm), to the fiendish
abode <span id="fr_1058"></span>[1](#fn_1048).

20\. And here, too, about the praise of the family of the Fryânaks <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[2](#fn_1049) it speaks thus: 'Righteousness comes
up, *O* Spîtâmân! from the descendants and posterity of Tûrân; when
extracted by the Fryânaks *it* is stated <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[3](#fn_1050) just as *though* it were by Tûrân;
through the assistance of complete mindfulness they develope the
world <span id="fr_1061"></span>[4](#fn_1051) of righteousness and
produce distress for the fiend; they likewise think about *it* with Good
Thought, *O* Zaratû*s*t! *and* thou shouldst bring forth (zâyê*s*) their
gratification <span id="fr_1062"></span>[5](#fn_1052) from us, who are
archangels, by words, that is, do thou demand *it*.'

21\. This, too, *is said*, namely: 'This liberality which is *for* thee
is *for us* who are archangels; by him who shall provide liberality for
thee <span id="fr_1063"></span>[6](#fn_1053), it is provided for us.'
22. About the praise of Vi*s*tâsp *there* is this, too, namely:
'Kai-Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_1064"></span>[7](#fn_1054) *has* propitiated
thee, among the existences, by liberal giving; that Vi*s*tâsp, whose
coming forth to thee in distress is through the reign of Vohûman, has
developed the material world of righteousness; thou

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

shouldst think of him, the good companion, *O* Zaratû*s*t! the pure
friend who is Kat-Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_1065"></span>[1](#fn_1055);
such is that Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp, the active, who, when he praises the
religion, is attracting fellow-dwellers *and* converts *them*, that is,
he brings them on to the religion <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[2](#fn_1056).'

23\. About attracting the Spîtâmas to the religion *there* is this, too,
namely: 'Thou shouldst speak thus to the Spîtâmas: "Praise righteousness
with much homage about *it* mentally; and a concession is to be
discriminated by you, as well as whatever is no concession; even for
those deeds *of* yours righteousness is the reward given unto you, that
reward which is much given by Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[3](#fn_1057)."' 24. About the place of the four
marvels produced by Aûha*r*ma*zd* *in* yonder *world*: there where is
the reign of Vohûman <span id="fr_1068"></span>[4](#fn_1058), there
where is the hospitality of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[5](#fn_1059), there where religion is *along* with
complete mindfulness <span id="fr_1070"></span>[6](#fn_1060), *and*
there where are the souls of the liberal <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[7](#fn_1061).

25\. About advice to Zaratû*s*t as to speech, made for mankind, which is
proportionate—abandoning want of proportion—which is an appropriation of
liberality with humility and a wise proportion <span
id="fr_1072"></span>[8](#fn_1062) for good works. 26. This, too, namely:
'To him who gives himself mentally up to thee in discipleship, thou also
shouldst give up the best which *thou hast* to give of thine own; and
thou shouldst give wealth to him who shall give wealth to thee <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[9](#fn_1063), because so thy soul would be perfect,
*O* righteous Zaratû*s*t! when it shall act thus.' 27. This, too: 'Thou

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

shouldst select this religion of mine with wisdom *and* also with
thought <span id="fr_1074"></span>[1](#fn_1064).' 28. This, too, that
*as to* him who *has* to act with the freedom from effort
(*a*pêsitûnagîh) of righteousness <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[2](#fn_1065) *and* owing to *it*, for the good
works done by him the gift is good. 29. This, too, that whoever seeks by
good works, *and* seeks good works by innocence, obtains freedom from
harm (*a*-nâsîh); *and* whoever is liberal to the sacred beings <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[3](#fn_1066) is free from destruction
(*a*-nasîni*s*nŏ), owing to the liberality of the sacred beings. 30.
*And* this, too, namely: 'These *are* the rewards I am aware of <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[4](#fn_1067), which have been, which still are, and
which ever *will* be.'

31\. Perfect excellence is righteousness.

<span id="fn_1038"></span>[278:6](sbe37088.htm#fr_1048) The arch-heretic
who was born in A.D. 215-6, first preached his doctrines on the
coronation day of king Shahpûr I (20th March, 242), and was put to death
by order of Bahrâm I in A.D. 276-7 (see Nŏldeke's Gesch. der Sas. pp.
47, 412, 415). From the mode in which he and his followers are mentioned
in §§ 13-16, it would seem that the original Pahlavi version of this
Nask must have been made at a time when this heresy was still fresh in
men's memories, as it would have been in the first half of the fourth
century, when Âtû*r*pâ*d*-î Mâ*r*aspendân was collecting and revising
the sacred books.
