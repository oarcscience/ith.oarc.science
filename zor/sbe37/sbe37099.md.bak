### CHAPTER L.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. Propitiation *for* the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and a scornful dole
*for* the evil spirit.

2\. The fourth fargar*d* is the Yânîm-manô <span
id="fr_1238"></span>[1](#fn_1224.md) of the Bakŏ, about the praise of
Zaratû*s*t, that is, his jurisdiction, invocation of blessing
(yânŏ) <span id="fr_1239"></span>[2](#fn_1225.md), and speaking *in* reply
were such as are declared by the *sacred* text. 3. This, too, that that
jurisdiction of his arose before the blessing, that is, this one
decision is made by him about his own, that his own person is first made
deserving by him through virtue, and then virtue is prayed for by
him <span id="fr_1240"></span>[3](#fn_1226.md).

4\. This, too, that he has attributed the source *and* result to
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, who gives joy to Aûha*r*ma*zd*; for the source and result
of various advantages *and* various joys are desirable for joy itself,
as joy is the acme (rôê*s*man) of every happiness *of him* whose joy
*has* made an offering (aûstôfrî*d*ŏ) to Aûha*r*ma*zd*, because his
decision is this, that by him whose joy arises from that thing which is
the will of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, its source *and* result are attributed to
Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 5. This, too, that the good work, which is a
gratification *by* lawful gratifiers <span
id="fr_1241"></span>[4](#fn_1227.md), becomes appropriated by him who shall
perform that which is truly reverent; even for this reason, because he
who is a lawful gratifier of others, through true reverence, *has*
intended to gratify through the practice of his reverence, and, when
thus the gratifier of those persons, the good work of gratification

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

*by* lawful gratifiers becomes appropriated. 6. This, too, that the
wisdom of Vohûman <span id="fr_1242"></span>[1](#fn_1228.md) is advanced by
him who utters a discourse through Vohûman; for this reason, because the
wisdom of Vohûman and its advancement are mostly through discourse. 7.
This, too, that the plentifulness and satisfaction of cattle <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[1](#fn_1228.md) are taught by him who properly
maintains the cattle which are in his possession; even for this reason,
owing to the multitudes thus *belonging* to *him* who properly maintains
the cattle which are in his possession, he gains his profit *and*
pleasure therefrom, *and* others, who see that gain, are instructed,
even as much as he, about the proper maintenance of cattle for their own
profit *and* pleasure.

8\. This, too, that benefit <span id="fr_1244"></span>[2](#fn_1229.md)
*being* given for the benefit *of* the worthy *man* is taught by him who
keeps the benefit that is his as the property *of* the sacred beings;
even for this reason, because he gives the benefit that is his unto the
worthy *man* for the purpose of keeping *it* for the advantage of the
sacred beings, and others are instructed about it. 9. This, too, that
prosperity <span id="fr_1245"></span>[3](#fn_1230.md) *being* given, in
both existences <span id="fr_1246"></span>[2](#fn_1229.md), to him who is
generous *and* worthy is taught by him who gives benefit to a worthy
*man* possessing body and life; even for this reason, because a worldly
*existence* and a spiritual *one* are both his, also his worldly
*existence* is in this existence, *and* the spiritual *one* in that
existence wherefrom satisfaction *for* the giving of benefit arrives.
10. This, too, that by him who shall cause reverence <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[4](#fn_1231.md) of the good, even this is taught, that
the sacred

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

beings gratify him who is practising their will; even for this reason,
because good for him, by whom the reverence is practised, becomes the
reply of satisfaction, *and* the throne of the sacred beings is certain.

11\. This, too, that *he* who *was* at first has taught even this to
mankind, that supplicants <span id="fr_1248"></span>[1](#fn_1232.md) *for*
the favour of the sacred beings gratify the sacred beings by being
contented (pa*d*v*âz*); even for this reason, because the welcome of a
sacred being, supplied by command from the religion, is a virtuousness
in the world distinct from that, and the production of a course of
generosity, from the sacred beings to mankind, arises really through the
contentment of the favoured; *and* mankind thereby become freer from
doubt, and believe more in the sacred beings. 12. This, too, that his
soul is delivered, *or will* be delivered, into the supreme heaven <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[2](#fn_1233.md), who *has* given something to him who
praises the sacred beings *and* the good; even for this reason, because
even through liberality as to wealth, and the production of a way to the
supreme heaven, *it* is manifest *that* anything given to the praisers
of the sacred beings *and* the good is a greater liberality. 13. This,
too, that the reverence <span id="fr_1250"></span>[3](#fn_1234.md) of those
needing reverence is occasioned by him who teaches the *sacred* word
(v*âk*akŏ) to the good; even for this reason, because he who is a good
teacher of revelation (dênô) can bring *it* into use for the reverence,
advantage, *and* joy of the sacred beings *and* the good.

14\. This, too, that acquaintance with the religion of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_1251"></span>[3](#fn_1234.md) is disclosed to
his own by him who loves Vohûman; even for this reason, because true

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

knowledge arises from the discrimination of pure wisdom, and the pure
attainment of the most discriminative spiritual lord (ahvô) to the mind,
through the purity that constitutes the way within the mind of a
spiritual lord, the purity which becomes that way through the lodgment
of Vohûman there. 15. This, too, that righteousness is taught <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[1](#fn_1235.md) *by him* who keeps *his* mind
connected with righteousness; even for this reason, because his mind
attains to an effort for authority, and, ridden by the effort, *attains*
to *its* acquisition. 16. This, too, that by him who gives commands
about the progress of the concerns of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, this is also taught
to mankind, namely, when *one* sees the throne of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1253"></span>[2](#fn_1236.md); even for this reason, because it is
possible to see that throne through the complete progress *of* the will
of Aûha*r*ma*zd* in the world; *and* whoever gives commands about the
progress of the concerns of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the will of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is
necessary in him, the progressive share of those concerns for the people
of the world *being* shown, which is seen even through that foundation,
of completeness that becomes the throne of Aûha*r*ma*zd* *for* mankind.

i7. This, too, that by him who welcomes Aûha*r*ma*zd* in *him*self <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[3](#fn_1237.md), matters only known by even a
high-priest are then taught to mankind; even for this reason, because
instruction and knowledge are mostly those through a high-priest, and by
him who welcomes Aûha*r*ma*zd* in *him*self, a spiritual lord is then
prayed for, who becomes glorious and praised for that which is to be
taught, and mankind are taught by him. 18. This, too, that by any one
good, who

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

is a servant *and* pleaser of a good ruler, a good person may be brought
forward, to him who is the ruler, for benefit <span
id="fr_1255"></span>[1](#fn_1238.md); even for this reason, because a good
*man* associates other good people with him in the benefit that happens
to him, and *his* character, temper, *and* disposition are thus due to
that; but when bringing himself forward to rulers, through reverence
*and* gratification *of* the rulers, other good people may also be
brought forward by him for that benefit. 19. This, too, that by him
*who* shall virtuously make an accumulation, the way of prosperity <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[2](#fn_1239.md) from the sacred beings is disclosed to
his own; even for this reason, because virtuous accumulation is provided
through unnumbered (*a*pênavâ*d*ŏ) grants of a decider, and, when *it
is* so, he becomes the treasurer of the sacred beings.

20\. This, too, that by him who produces advantage for the archangels,
the gift of him who is suitable for the sovereignty <span
id="fr_1257"></span>[3](#fn_1240) of the immature (khâm.md) world is
solicited; even for this reason, because the advantage which is produced
for the archangels *being* for the sake of his own, the advantage of the
immature creation solicited—the supreme advantage of the primitive good
creations—becomes a virtuous ruler. 21. This, too, that by him who is a
praiser <span id="fr_1258"></span>[3](#fn_1240.md) of an archangel, the
good religion is praised; even for this reason, because the good
religion is praise of the archangels, *and* the praise of the archangels
is the good religion. 22. This, too, that the religion of the sacred
beings is made progressive <span id="fr_1259"></span>[3](#fn_1240.md) by
him who shall make an offering (aûstôfrî*d*ŏ) *to* the

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

sacred beings; even for this reason, because making an offering *to* the
sacred beings strengthens the upholders of religion, and the progress of
religion occurs through upholders of religion.

23\. This, too, that by him who shall make mankind quite zealous
(garemôkŏ) for doing good works, the reward of the good works is also
made liberal for mankind; even for this reason, because the producer of
the origin is also the producer of the result. 24. This, too, that above
the multitude is the praise of the man who is assisting those of
virtuous will, who is also the nourishment of the creatures through
virtuousness, and whose accumulation is also owing to virtuousness; even
for this reason, because whoever is assisting those of virtuous will is
an increaser of virtuousness in the world, whoever is the nourishment of
the creatures through virtuousness is a producer of the paternity of
creatures, *and he* whose accumulation is owing to virtuousness becomes
an improver of the world. 25. This, too, that by him who assists him who
is ignorant (kha*s*t), is given *and* taught to supplicants that which
is suitable for them. 26. To assist him who is ignorant is this, such as
forming the province, district, domain, *and* family; maintaining the
abode *and* house of a follower of Vi*s*tâsp (Vi*s*tâs*p*anŏ), the
fortress *and* stronghold, and the homestead (khân) of the agricultural
peasant; repairing a rugged road; building bridges over rivers; managing
a river, aqueduct, or brook; populating desolate places; *and* doing
other things, owing to which any retention (gîrift-aê) of the comfort
and advantage of mankind in the world occurs. 27. And by him who shall
do these things, the assistance even of him who is born afterwards,

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

the making of that which is a very advantageous thing suitable *for*
mankind, and also the doing *of this* for others, are taught.

28\. This, too, that it is revealed (*k*âshtô) of the spiritual
existence *that* that which is wisdom is for Aûha*r*ma*zd*, for him who
is wisdom—that is, it teaches *that* acquired *wisdom* is for him whose
innate wisdom is good—even for this reason, because the spirit, this
that has come into his possession, which is acquired wisdom, is given by
it to the progeny of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, which is innate wisdom, to increase
*it; and* Aûha*r*ma*zd* is gratified thereby.

29\. Of a summary about the continuance *that* was, the progress of the
material *existence, and* the continuance *that will* be <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[1](#fn_1241.md), *there* is also this:—about the
continuance *that* was, which is the beginning, *there are* the
essential thought *and* beneficent production of the good and evil
material *existence* of its good goodness, and that of *its* evil
vileness; about the progress of the material *existence*, which is
intermediate, *there are* the dutiful doing of good works,
righteousness, and having reward, the committal of crime, wickedness,
*and* having the bridge *penalty; and* about the continuance *that will*
be, which is the last, *there are* the government, with wisdom, of that
supremely good *one* who is the origin of all the multitudinous
*creatures* (vasîkân), the triumph of goodness over vileness, the
admissibility *of* the good, the inadmissibility of the bad, *and* the
purity of the restoration of the good creatures.

30\. Of righteousness perfect is the excellence.
