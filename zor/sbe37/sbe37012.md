Vi*s*tâsp-sâstô.'

21\. The excellence *of* righteousness is perfect.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_73"></span>[20:4](sbe37012.htm#fr_74) Corresponding to the
eighth word, ha*k*â, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it
is the ninth Nask in other Rivâyats. Bari*s*, or Barî*s*, means
'splendid, sublime;' and the Rivâyats state that it contained originally
sixty kardah, or subdivisions, of which only twelve were recovered after
the time of Alexander.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[21:1](sbe37012.htm#fr_75) Pû*s*, the demon of
misers in Bd. XXVIII, 28.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[21:2](sbe37012.htm#fr_76) These four angels are
personifications of Av. vohû manô, 'good thought,' spe*n*ta ârmaiti*s*,
'bountiful devotion,' sraoshô, 'the obedient one,' and ashi*s* vanguhi,
'good rectitude.'

<span id="fn_76"></span>[21:3](sbe37012.htm#fr_77) These four demoniacal
propensities are here mentioned as the opponents of the foregoing four
angels. Akômanô and Aeshm, the first and third, are the recognised
opponents of Vohûman and Srôsh, respectively (see Bd. XXX, 29). Varenô,
the second, is considered a demon (see Bd. XXVIII, 25), and is mentioned
in the Dinka*rd*, book VI, as opposing the angel Ar*d* or Aharî*s*vang
(see Dd. XCIV, 2); here he evidently opposes another female angel,
Spenda*r*ma*d*, while Aharî*s*vang or Ashi is opposed by her simple
negation, Anâhar.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[21:4](sbe37012.htm#fr_78) Av. sraoshya, see
Pahl. Vend. XIII, 9.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[22:1](sbe37012.htm#fr_79) Supposing that sûkŏ
stands for sûd.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[22:2](sbe37012.htm#fr_80) Reading
bêshînî*d*ârîh which is more probable than the bêsh*âz*înî*d*ârîh,
'curativeness,' of the MS.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[22:3](sbe37012.htm#fr_81) All the details in §§
5-19 are to be read in connection with 'the period' mentioned in § 4.
