IV, 35, if a man wounds another so that the blood comes, and does this for the <I>fourth</I> time, he becomes an outcast and receives the maximum punishment. Also, when a person walks without the sacred girdle or shirt (Vend. XVIII, 59), it is at the <I>fourth</I> step that the demons possess him.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_170"></A><A HREF="sbe37022.htm#fr_171">51:1</A> A H&acirc;sar (Av. h&acirc;thra) is a measure of distance, as well as of time. This is stated in Farh. O&icirc;m, pp. 41, l. 11-42, l. 3, thus:&#151;'Of the H&acirc;sar there are also several kinds that express measurement. A medium H&acirc;sar on the ground, which they call also a Parasang, is a thousand steps of two feet which have to walk. With the lapse of time of a medium H&acirc;sar the day and night are computed.' Again, p. 43, ll. 1-3 state that 'of twelve H&acirc;sars is the longest day; that day and night in which is the longest day are twelve of the longest H&acirc;sars, eighteen of the medium, and twenty-four of the least.' From this it appears that an average H&acirc;sar of distance is a thousand paces, or Roman mile; and an average H&acirc;sar of time is one hour and twenty minutes.</P>
