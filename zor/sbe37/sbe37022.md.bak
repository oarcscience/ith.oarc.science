### Footnotes

<span id="fn_151"></span>[43:1](sbe37021.htm#fr_152.md) These three modes
are expressed by Pâz. ithrih, hidhih, and apavarâvar*s*tih, which stand
evidently for the original Avesta words ithra, hadha, and
apaurvavar*s*ta (see Chap. XXI, 6).

<span id="fn_152"></span>[43:2](sbe37021.htm#fr_153.md) See § 2.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[44:1](sbe37022.htm#fr_154.md) Pahl. aharûbŏkîh (=
Av. ashavagha) must not be confounded with aharûbŏîh, 'righteousness,'
for which aharâyîh is more commonly used.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[44:2](sbe37022.htm#fr_155.md) These two kinds of
injury, usually written bâîô*d*ôk-zê*d*ŏ and kâîtyôk-*g*a*d*ŏ in the
Dinka*rd*, are mentioned in Farh. Oîm, pp. 32, l. 8-34, l. 2, as
follows:—'*Av*. baodha*g*a*d* = *Pahl*. bô*d*ô-zê*d* *and* *Av*.
baodhô-var*s*tahê = *Pahl*. bô*d*ôk-var*s*t are as *it were*
"observantly assaulted," and *one* mentions *them* most about the
assault and injury of anything which is noticeable. Through falsehood
other noticeable sin is small, *and* is subdued through *being* devoid
of an injurer, as the assault *and* injury of anything through wear is a
small sin. Kâîtyô-ge*d* is a sin for mankind, which is a degree of
Bô*d*ôk-zê*d*, *but* less; so also the decree (dastînak) is different
from Bô*d*ôk-var*s*t. The principal Bô*d*ôk-zê*d*, that of animals with
observance, the Bô*d*ôk-zê*d* through wear, *and* the Kâîtyôk-zê*d* sin
towards people are sins which are hamêmâlân ("affecting accusers"). The
dissipating weapon for sin dissipates the sinfulness of the other sin,
which is called rûbânîk ("affecting the soul").'

<span id="fn_155"></span>[44:3](sbe37022.htm#fr_156.md) These two terms are
âgêreptŏ and avôîri*s*tŏ (Av. âgereptem and avaoiri*s*tem) which are
thus described in Farh. Oîm, p. 36, ll. 4-6: 'âgerept, "seized," is that
when they shall take up a weapon for smiting an innocent *person*;
avoîri*s*t, "turning," is that when *one* turns the weapon upon an
innocent *person*.'

<span id="fn_156"></span>[44:4](sbe37022.htm#fr_157.md) See Chap. XVII, 6,
for some of these terms.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[44:5](sbe37022.htm#fr_158.md) Pahl. handerêtŏ
which is thus described in Farh. Oîm, pp. 34, l. 8-35, l. 1: '*Av*.
ha*n*dereiti, *Pahl*. handeretŏ, is that when, owing to negligence,
*one* keeps any one exhausted; when *one* would make him fallen who is
of the ruined, or him who is a master of arms, and *has* imprisoned him,
the causing of much anguish thereby is the committal of incarceration.'
See also § 44.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[45:1](sbe37022.htm#fr_159) Pâz. knîn (= knûn.md).

<span id="fn_159"></span>[45:2](sbe37022.htm#fr_160.md) Of which the
details are not mentioned.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[45:3](sbe37022.htm#fr_161.md) Pahl. hîkhar (Av.
hikhra) is any refuse or dirt from the living body, or any liquid
exudation from a corpse.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[47:1](sbe37022.htm#fr_162.md) Doubtful: the word
can be read freh-gasîgân on its first occurrence, and freh-ga*s*îgânŏ on
its last; but both reading and meaning are very uncertain.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[48:1](sbe37022.htm#fr_163.md) It might be
'inevitability,' but this would render the ordeal unnecessary.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[49:1](sbe37022.htm#fr_164.md) The fact of the
wound being sufficient to prove the unlawfulness of using the weapon.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[49:2](sbe37022.htm#fr_165.md) According to Vend.
IV, 35, if a man wounds another so that the blood comes, and does this
for the *fourth* time, he becomes an outcast and receives the maximum
punishment. Also, when a person walks without the sacred girdle or shirt
(Vend. XVIII, 59), it is at the *fourth* step that the demons possess
him.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[50:1](sbe37022.htm#fr_166.md) See Chap. XVII, 6.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[50:2](sbe37022.htm#fr_167.md) Pahl. Av.
as*p*erenô (=Pahl. anas*p*ôrîk) 'imperfect, immature;' an epithet for a
lamb or kid.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[50:3](sbe37022.htm#fr_168.md) Pahl. anûmôyê (Av.
anumaya), probably 'bleater,' an epithet for a sheep or goat.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[50:4](sbe37022.htm#fr_169.md) These four grades
of value are mentioned in Vend. IV, 48.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[50:5](sbe37022.htm#fr_170.md) See § 1.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[51:1](sbe37022.htm#fr_171.md) A Hâsar (Av.
hâthra) is a measure of distance, as well as of time. This is stated in
Farh. Oîm, pp. 41, l. 11-42, l. 3, thus:—'Of the Hâsar there are also
several kinds that express measurement. A medium Hâsar on the ground,
which they call also a Parasang, is a thousand steps of two feet which
have to walk. With the lapse of time of a medium Hâsar the day and night
are computed.' Again, p. 43, ll. 1-3 state that 'of twelve Hâsars is the
longest day; that day and night in which is the longest day are twelve
of the longest Hâsars, eighteen of the medium, and twenty-four of the
least.' From this it appears that an average Hâsar of distance is a
thousand paces, or Roman mile; and an average Hâsar of time is one hour
and twenty minutes.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[52:1](sbe37022.htm#fr_172.md) Possibly hûmat,
hûkht, hûvarst, 'good thoughts, good words, and good deeds,' which would
be accepted as a sign of repentance.
