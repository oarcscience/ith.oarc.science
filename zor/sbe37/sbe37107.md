### CHAPTER LVIII.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The twelfth fargar*d*, U*s*tavaiti <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[5](#fn_1355.md), is *that* the benefit of him who is
reverent *to* the benefiters is the benefit of any one whatever <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[6](#fn_1356.md); even for this

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

reason, because the benefit of the immature creation is owing to
carrying *out* the commands of a benefiting spiritual lord. 2. This,
too, that whoever pleases superiors by submission, is pleased by
inferiors. 3. This, too, that by him who gives thought to the religion
of Zaratû*s*t, that which is best for his own in every mode <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1](#fn_1357.md) is produced, because he has attained
to the religion who is listening best. 4. This, too, that virtue is
taught by him to all the creatures of the beneficent spirit, *to* the
righteous whose stepping forth (fravâmi*s*nŏ) is for the righteous; even
for this reason, because the creatures of the beneficent spirit are all
*of* one nature, *and* the stepping forth (fragâmi*s*nŏ) and hastening
of the limbs of one body become those of the whole of that body. 5.
This, too, that his spirit is connected with Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[2](#fn_1358.md), and his knowledge is accepted, who
loves Vohûman; even for this reason, because the spirit *who* is the
original spiritual lord of knowledge is Vohûman. 6. This, too, that just
giving is taught by him whose words are through Vohûman <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[3](#fn_1359.md); even for this reason, because the
speaking of virtuous words becomes the teaching of knowledge in which
*there* is also just giving.

7\. This, too, that joy which is of long duration is produced <span
id="fr_1390"></span>[4](#fn_1360.md) for his own by him who brings forth
strength through virtue, *and* who also assists him who is unborn; even
for this reason, because joy which is perpetual increases by both. 8.
This, too, that by him who is an assistance of those in the proper way,
the proper way is taught to mankind <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[5](#fn_1361.md);

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

even for this reason, because *he is* making mankind long for *that*
way. 9. This, too, that heat is given to fire <span
id="fr_1392"></span>[1](#fn_1362.md) by him who *tells* truth to the
invokers; even for this reason, because the adversary—owing to the heat
of the fire achieved *by* the indicator of truth—is more particularly
subdued by the strength of that just *one*.

10\. This, too, that the assistants for the renovation *of the universe*
are the decrees of Vi*s*tâsp which <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[2](#fn_1363.md) are through Vohûman—of Sôshâns <span
id="fr_1394"></span>[3](#fn_1364.md) and Kai-Khûsrôî <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[4](#fn_1365.md); even for this reason, because the
fragments are possessing a renewer which is their own completion <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[5](#fn_1366.md), and the completion—which is through
the assistance of the renovation by Vi*s*tâsp—is through what *occurs*
when the religion is set going by him, through which the renovation
arises; and the triumph of the completion, which is through an ordinance
by Sôshâns, is through what *occurs* when through the ordinance *there*
is thus a decree which sets aside all distress from the creatures, *and*
gives the ordinance *to* the whole material existence, that which is
living and also that which is dead. 11. This, too, that whoever intrusts
it with a command given—which command given intrusts him who supplies
the command from revelation—and it worships what is

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

necessary to worship, is thereby displayed among the existences *as* the
progeny of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_1397"></span>[1](#fn_1367.md).

12\. This, too, that the defeat of the bad and the acceptance of the
good <span id="fr_1398"></span>[2](#fn_1368.md) are taught by him who shall
provide a righteous gift for the worthy; because both are therein. 13.
This, too, that ability for even the transformation of the
creatures <span id="fr_1399"></span>[3](#fn_1369.md) of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is
taught by him who loves Vohûman; even for this reason, because the
forward-dragging, and also the backward-dragging, power—which is in
mankind—is qualified, through changeableness of will, for even the
actions of the Vohûmanic nature. 14. This, too, that power is taught, to
that spirit through whom the creatures are changed, by him whose wisdom
is for that which is wisdom; even for this reason, because that spirit
is wisdom, *and* increases in mankind through instruction. 15. This,
too, that by him who praises the religion like a disciple, and who also
teaches *it* like a priest <span id="fr_1400"></span>[4](#fn_1370.md), it
is shown *that* Sôshâns <span id="fr_1401"></span>[4](#fn_1370.md) really
comes; even for this reason, because the religion, from the first
praiser and teacher *down* to the last praiser and teacher, is connected
by discipleship and priesthood, *and* Sôshâns becomes a disciple *in*
the end, and the last priest.

16\. This, too, that the wisdom of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1402"></span>[5](#fn_1371.md) is taught by him who shall supply
decisions and adjudication from the religion; even for this reason,
because the decision of religion is the wisdom of Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 17.
This, too, that complete mindfulness, so that they are not
deceived <span id="fr_1403"></span>[5](#fn_1371.md), is taught

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

through wisdom by him who is as reverent *to* Aûha*r*ma*zd* as a
daughter *to* a father; even for this reason, because the reverence of a
daughter unto a father arises mostly through natural sympathy (âhang-î
*k*itrîk), *and* through the intellectual complete mindfulness of the
daughter.

18\. This, too, that maintaining the destinies (vakhtân) of the body
through the command of the creator is taught by him who teaches the
righteous *man* and the wicked *one* that thing *which* becomes comfort
to them, *to* the righteous *man* as to *his* body, *and to* the wicked
*one* as to *his* soul; even for this reason, because he becomes a
friend of the creatures, a friend of the creatures is also a friend of
creativeness, *and* a friend of the creator maintains body *and* wealth
through the command of the creator, *and* others are taught by him. 19.
This, too, that joy owing to him who is powerful is taught him who is
righteous only by him—that is, *he* is conveying him to the rulers for
benefit <span id="fr_1404"></span>[1](#fn_1372.md)—who is an assistance of
him who is righteous through capability, that is, he shall do it through
exertion of power; even for this reason, because, when he *has* provided
as much assistance as *it* is possible for him *to do*, his praise
arises through that benefit which is pre-eminent through his exertion.
20. This, too, that the benefit *of* sovereignty for that which
arises <span id="fr_1405"></span>[2](#fn_1373.md) is taught only by him who
always thoroughly teaches authority (patîh) up to dictatorship
(vispô-farmânîh); that is, he teaches to others that thing which always
arises for them up to dictatorial. authority; this is where it is
connected by them with the

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

renovation *of the universe* through the control which is in the tree of
germs <span id="fr_1406"></span>[1](#fn_1374.md).

21\. This, too, that he becomes liberal to fire <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[2](#fn_1375.md) who shall perform work for fire that
is its protection, and so it is taught about *it* through the obeisance
by him whose liberality—that is his through the obeisance—becomes
liberal, *and* whose declaration, that arises as to Vohûman, possesses
wealth through virtue. 22. This, too, *that* this thinking as to
righteousness <span id="fr_1408"></span>[3](#fn_1376.md) is taught only by
him—that is, he thinks—whose petition for righteousness is ever afresh.
23. This, too, that the religion is interrogated <span
id="fr_1409"></span>[4](#fn_1377.md) by him who is submissive *to*
superiors and similarly situated (ham-*g*âk) *to* inferiors.

24\. This, too, that the state of the present *world* (latammanîh) for
the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion is thoroughly taught where whatever
becomes a progress <span id="fr_1410"></span>[5](#fn_1378.md) of the
religion is whatever is purification for mankind; even for this reason,
because the want of progress of the religion is owing to the want of
purification of mankind as to the fiend, and when a human being is
purified from the fiend, the progress of the religion becomes different.
25. This, too, that pleasure is taught to him who is a friend <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[6](#fn_1379.md);

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

only by him—that is, he gives it—who is a pleasure to him who is a
friend; and its routine is really this, that by him who causes pleasure
to friends, his *having* caused pleasure is taught also to them. 26.
This, too, that, owing to him whom Aûha*r*ma*zd* teaches joy, it is
taught *that* gratification <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1](#fn_1380.md)
comes from Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even for this reason, because he is exalted,
even in the worldly *existence*, through that joy which is supreme, and
mankind are thereby taught.

27\. This, too, that the augmentation of indications as to intellect is
taught to him who is a vigorous-minded (tûstŏ-mîni*s*nŏ) man <span
id="fr_1413"></span>[2](#fn_1381.md), by him whose own progress is that
towards his own sacred beings; even for this reason, because he fully
considers, *and* delivers the decision, of his own powers, of those,
too, of *his* contemporaries (ham-bu*d*îkânŏ), *and* likewise of the
chivalry (*k*îrîh) of the age; and others are taught about *it* by him.
28. This, too, that the spirit of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[3](#fn_1382.md) is expounded only by him—that is, he
loves *it*—whose close exposition is of Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even for this
reason, because he becomes similarly loved with Aûha*r*ma*zd*, so
that <span id="fr_1415"></span>[4](#fn_1383.md) . . . 29. And this, too,
that the reward is taught in the publicity of the sun <span
id="fr_1416"></span>[5](#fn_1384.md) by him whose friendship is for the
Spîtâmân, which also increases in the day—that is, it is necessary to
perform duty and good works in the day—but he does not put *it* aside
the second day; even for this reason, because friendship for the
religion is through kind regard;

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

and duty in *one* day, only to put *it* aside for the second day,
becomes affliction (vêsh) *at* the bridge *of judgment*; also the sun is
the most kindly-regarding and swiftest of those visible.

30\. Excellence *that* is perfect *is* righteousness.
