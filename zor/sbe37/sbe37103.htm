<p>1. The eighth fargar<I>d</I>, <I>H</I><I>v</I>a&ecirc;tumaiti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1330"></A><A HREF="#fn_1302"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, is <I>that</I> by him who teaches wisdom to others the not being deceived by an apostate into confusing a righteous <I>one</I> (ahar&ucirc;b&#335;-bar&icirc;<I>s</I>&icirc;h) is also taught&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1331"></A><A HREF="#fn_1303"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; even for this reason, because he who <I>has</I> taught is not deceived.</p>

<p>2. This, too, that by him who is as reverent <I>unto</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> as a daughter <I>unto</I> a father, and who is also a gratifier of virtuous doers, Spenda<I>r</I>ma<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1332"></A><A HREF="#fn_1304"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is <I>made one</I> of the archangels, and one is also made to love <I>her;</I> even for this reason, because through that Spenda<I>r</I>ma<I>d</I>ic <I>one being</I> reverent <I>unto</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, and the gratification of the good <I>by</I> him, the archangels love and preserve her Spenda<I>r</I>ma<I>d</I>ic nature (Spenda<I>r</I>ma<I>d</I>&icirc;g&icirc;h). 3. This, too, that he who is loving Voh&ucirc;man is taught by his wisdom not to destroy (nas&acirc;n&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>a<I>n</I>&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1333"></A><A HREF="#fn_1305"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the religion of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; even for this reason, because wisdom maintains the religion in virtue, and others are taught about it.</p>  
<p>4. This, too, that by him who gives <I>him</I>self in discipleship unto the priests, <I>and</I> who asks again that which he does not understand, learning (&acirc;m&ucirc;k&#335;) is taught; even for this reason, because the asking for knowledge again <I>by him</I> who <I>has</I> given <I>him</I>self in discipleship to a wise priest, increases knowledge; and the friends of knowledge, therefore, make him an example, and shall practise asking again, that which they do not understand, <I>from</I> the disciples of the priests.</p>  
<p>5. This, too, that whoever is <I>in accordance</I> with Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, through pure affection, becomes, in like manner, <I>him</I> who is giving strength <I>to</I> the will of the archangels and the commands <I>of</I> the good; even for this reason, because these two capabilities <I>are</I> of the special nature of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t. 6. This, too, that through the discrimination of him who loves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1334"></A><A HREF="#fn_1306"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Voh&ucirc;man A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I></p>

<p><A NAME="page_342"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is gratified; even for this reason, because <I>one</I> loving Voh&ucirc;man is loving wisdom and <I>has</I> taught wisdom, wisdom taught is discrimination, and the discriminator becomes a gratifier of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>.</p>  
<p>7. This, too, that whoever gives thought to the religion of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t is taught wisdom; even for this reason, because all the wisdom of the good religion is taught to him by giving thought. 8. This, too, that whoever <I>has</I> kept wealth in the control&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1335"></A><A HREF="#fn_1307"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t becomes taught, <I>and</I> is <I>one</I> who is reverent <I>to</I> the benefiters; even for this reason, because whoever is reverent <I>to</I> the supporters of religion keeps wealth in the control <I>of</I> the supporters of religion, <I>and</I>, when kept by him in their control, it is kept by him in that of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t.</p>  
<p>9. This, too, that his destiny is connected with himself who practises industry. 10. This, too, that his good works <I>for</I> arranging the creation become his own who has fully prepared his own person.</p>  
<p>11. The excellence <I>of</I> righteousness is perfect.</p>
