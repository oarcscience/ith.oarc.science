### CHAPTER XX.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The nineteenth fargar*d*, Ka*d*-môi-urvâ <span
id="fr_656"></span>[2](#fn_651), is about where the souls, when they
come together, extol the soul of him who *was* a virtuous high-priest, a
friend of the soul, because he did not injure it, *and* guarded *it*
from hell.

2\. About the darkness, the intensity (bûr’*z*vŏ-hômandîh) and
far-reaching bottomlessness of the blackness, and the absence of
goodness *in* hell; and the proximity to stenches, close
concealment <span id="fr_657"></span>[3](#fn_652), sleet-pelted
clambering (pî*s*nakŏ-bâlînîh), frozen advancing,

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

painful condition, distressed state, and awful fear of those in hell. 3.
This, too, that is thrown open (lakhvâr ramîtun*d*) over it, from the
Dâîtî peak <span id="fr_658"></span>[1](#fn_653), which is in
Aîrân-vê*g*, to Albûr’*z* <span id="fr_659"></span>[2](#fn_654), and
below the middle of which is the gate of hell, is the *K*înva*d*
bridge <span id="fr_660"></span>[3](#fn_655) which is the route
(vi*d*âr) of every one, righteous *or* wicked; the width across the
route of the righteous is a breadth of nine spears, each one the length
of three reeds, *but* the route for the wicked becomes like the edge of
a razor.

4\. 'Thus say I <span id="fr_661"></span>[4](#fn_656) unto thee, O
Spîtâmân! that the man of truth steps forward over the *K*înva*d* pass,
even the far-famed happy bridge; for Â*s*tâ*d* <span
id="fr_662"></span>[5](#fn_657), the good promoter of the world, and
Mit*r*ô <span id="fr_663"></span>[6](#fn_658) of the vast
cattle-pastures save only the man possessing truth from that distress,
as though they *were* a regiment (si*p*âh) a thousand strong. 5. So I
say unto thee, O Spîtâmân! that thou shouldst not become a liar unto
Mit*r*ô, neither when thou wouldst converse with the wicked, nor when
*thou wouldst* with those of thine own religion who are righteous; for
both *of* those are promises, both *with* the wicked and the righteous;
there is a promise, O Zaratû*s*t! even *of* a wolf with young animals,
*but* that which is a

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

lascivious (*g*êhîk) promise is more awful, O Spîtâmân! 6. So I say unto
thee, O Spîtâmân! that thou shouldst not seize a wanton (*g*êhîk) for
use—that is, do not make her *thy* wife—and with compulsion
(ûpayami*s*nîh) of her <span id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_659)—that is, do
not let *thyself* lie with her. 7. And if thou shouldst seize a
courtezan for use, and with compulsion *of* her, thou mayst not dismiss
*her* afterwards, neither in adversity, nor in prosperity, neither on
account of fondness for self, nor *for* life; because *he* who seizes a
courtezan for use, and with compulsion, and shall dismiss her on account
of fondness for self, or *for* life, becomes thereby a breaker of
promises *to* the house, village, community, *or* province, *that* gives
her life (valman zîvînê*d*ŏ), *and to* the soul *that* animates
her <span id="fr_665"></span>[2](#fn_660).'

8\. So breaking the promise comes upon the children that are theirs,
through evil teaching; *and* he who is wicked is lying down without
children at the bottom of hell. 9. *That* is, there is nothing whatever
*of* <span id="fr_666"></span>[3](#fn_661) happiness *for* the wicked,
that happiness which is produced abundantly by him *who is*
Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

10\. Perfect righteousness is excellence.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[209:2](sbe37069.htm#fr_656) The first three
words of the fourth, and last, hâ of the third Gâtha (Yas. L, 1), here
written ka*d*-môk-ravakŏ in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[209:3](sbe37069.htm#fr_657) Compare AV. LIV,
5-8:—'As close as (tang-i*k*) from the ear to the eye, and as many as
the hairs a horse has in his mane, so many in number the souls of the
wicked stand, but they do not see, nor do they hear a sound, one from
the other, and every one, therefore, thinks that he is alone.' For a
description of hell see also Dd. XXVII.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[210:1](sbe37069.htm#fr_658) Or *K*akâ*d*-î
Dâîtî (see Pahl. Vend. XIX, 101; Bd. XII, 7).

<span id="fn_654"></span>[210:2](sbe37069.htm#fr_659) Av. hara
berezaiti, the range of lofty mountains supposed to surround the world
(see Bd. V, 3-5).

<span id="fn_655"></span>[210:3](sbe37069.htm#fr_660) Here called
*K*înakŏ-pûhal, and *K*î*s*-vi*d*arg in § 4; for a fuller description of
it see Dd. XXI, 2-7. Allusion is made to it in Yas. L, 7.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[210:4](sbe37069.htm#fr_661) Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
speaking to Zaratû*s*t. The whole of this paragraph appears to be quoted
verbatim from the original Pahlavi text of the Nask.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[210:5](sbe37069.htm#fr_662) See Chap. IX, 6.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[210:6](sbe37069.htm#fr_663) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. XLIV, 16.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[211:1](sbe37069.htm#fr_664) Or, perhaps, 'with
approach to her' (see Chap. XIX, 3 n). If ûpadami*s*nîh were read, it
might mean 'aspiration, or attachment' for her.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[211:2](sbe37069.htm#fr_665) This implies that
the woman, being a notorious sinner, cannot reasonably complain of
bodily injury on being dismissed; but her soul and the community are
grievously injured by her being thus driven into further sin, and for
this injury the man's soul will be made responsible.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[211:3](sbe37069.htm#fr_666) K has 'none even
of this.'
