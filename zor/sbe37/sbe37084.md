### CHAPTER XXXV.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The twelfth fargar*d*, the Yasna <span
id="fr_954"></span>[1](#fn_946.md), is about the manifestation of good
thoughts, good words, *and* good deeds by the religion <span
id="fr_955"></span>[2](#fn_947.md); the lodgment of the religion in good
thoughts, good words, and good deeds; *and* whoever possesses good
thoughts, whoever *has* good words, *and* whoever *has* good deeds, by
him righteousness and the reward of the righteous are possessed. 2.
This, too, that neither is he, who is not to be born *for* Zaratû*s*t,
an issue from parents who are not righteous, nor yet is he, for him, who
is a manifestation of the righteous.

3\. This, too, *is said*, namely: 'Thou shouldst give a glad-thinking
desire *for* a spiritual lord, and an easy-bodied constitution, to their
minds, the religion which I spoke forth *to* thee; so that the greatest,
best, and most beneficial of existences <span
id="fr_956"></span>[3](#fn_948.md), that *are* those which cattle *are*
wanting from men, *are* water, pasture, and freedom from danger <span
id="fr_957"></span>[4](#fn_949.md); *and* those which men *are wanting*
from cattle are also food and clothing.' 4. This, too, that that which
mankind ought to give to the sacred beings is a power for completeness
*of* control; and that which the sacred beings ought to give to men is
ever that which is good for them. 5. And this, too, that thou who *art*
Aûha*r*ma*zd* also suppliest *it* from those sacred beings, and *thou
who art* Zaratû*s*t also teachest *it* thoroughly to that best-ruling
sovereignty <span id="fr_958"></span>[5](#fn_950.md) and authority.

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

6\. This, too, *is said*, namely: 'Let no *one* practise ill-perpetrated
deeds, even though in a wilderness when far from publicity, nor in
distress, *O* Spîtâmân! because Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the observer of
everything, is aware of them; and the rule is *that* just as any one
whatever *of* the embodied existence thinks, speaks, *and* practises, so
great is his punishment.' 7. And this, too, that the best ceremonial and
obeisance <span id="fr_959"></span>[1](#fn_951.md) are the ceremonial *and*
obeisance of a righteous man.

8\. About begging for life and receiving *it, there* is this, that *it
is* customarily due to two methods (babâ): one, through leadership of
righteousness <span id="fr_960"></span>[2](#fn_952.md), is that *through*
which *it* is evident that *it is* owing to virtuousness; and one,
through service of righteousness <span id="fr_961"></span>[2](#fn_952.md),
is that which is not an evidence that *it is* owing to viciousness. 9.
About *the case* where virtuousness is producing authority over truth,
and truth over the tongue, so that thou speakest words through the will
of Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 10. And this, too, *is said*, namely: 'I am the
propitious spirit who *was at* first *and* ever *will be*, and am not
really deceived by anything.'

11\. About fire *being* given *by* Aûha*r*ma*zd* for shelter and
assistance *by* the protection of mankind; *its* maintenance and
assistance *by* mankind; and the openheartedness of the spirit of fire
for him who shall perform obeisance to it, and for him who is to perform
obeisance to it <span id="fr_962"></span>[3](#fn_953.md). 12. The work
which is the greatest that exists, *and* is accomplished in the future
existence <span id="fr_963"></span>[4](#fn_954.md), whereby the creatures
become pure,

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

occurs through fire; *and one* prays *for it* for the sake of the
requirements which mankind acquired from the sacred beings. 13. This,
too, *is said*, namely: 'Since thou *art* thus, '*O* Zaratû*s*t! most
propitiatory, that is, able to perform most for our pleasure, we are
more promptly coming than Mânû*sk*îhar *was* able to come, when thou
beggest of us who are archangels, *O* Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_964"></span>[1](#fn_955.md)!'

14\. About Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s exhibiting the creatures in the future
existence to Zaratû*s*t. 15. *And* this, too, namely, the all-brilliance
of the earth, the all-brilliance *of* the cattle, the all-brilliance
*of* the plants, and the all-brilliance *of* every excellence <span
id="fr_965"></span>[2](#fn_956.md) which is a manifestation of
righteousness. 16. About the worshipping of Aûha*r*ma*zd* by
worshippers, through advancing <span id="fr_966"></span>[3](#fn_957.md) in
the religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s covenant (pa*d*mânŏ), which gave the
world his righteousness; also the good protectiveness of his rule, and
*of* the greatness therein, is owing to it <span
id="fr_967"></span>[4](#fn_958.md), and the name of the ruler is
Wisdom <span id="fr_968"></span>[5](#fn_959.md); likewise his
ceremonial—performed while the creations owing to him live. when
possessing bodies and possessing life <span
id="fr_969"></span>[6](#fn_960.md)—is a benefit *to* all the worldly and
spiritual *existences*.

17\. And this, too, *is said*, namely: 'Thou art our own <span
id="fr_970"></span>[7](#fn_961.md), and also *our* confederate, *O*
Spîtâmân! likewise unto us thou comest with the reverence that is
good <span id="fr_971"></span>[8](#fn_962.md); thine, *O* Zaratû*s*t! are
the greatness and completeness in performance <span
id="fr_972"></span>[9](#fn_963.md), so that they

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

become thy greatness and completeness, that is, they are thine, *O*
Zaratû*s*t! and are boundless onwards from the middle, that is, we give
thee a reward <span id="fr_973"></span>[1](#fn_964.md) so enormous that,
when thou shouldst stand in the middle *of it*, thou *wouldst* not see
to *its* limits, the width of the earth, the length of a river, and the
height of the sun <span id="fr_974"></span>[2](#fn_965.md).'

18\. Zaratû*s*t begged of Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: 'Give unto me him who
becomes a disciple of men <span id="fr_975"></span>[3](#fn_966.md) of the
mighty through meditation for the religion, *of them* who shall produce
the actual progress of this my religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers,
*and* who *will* also explain the good practices to this *one* of mine,
even the blessings set forth *by* me in the benedictions they possess.'
19. *And* Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: 'I *will* give unto thee him who
becomes a disciple of other men of the mighty; they are thy kinsmen and
those confederates *of* theirs, and thine are their companions and their
serfs <span id="fr_976"></span>[4](#fn_967.md), who produce the progress of
this thy religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers. 20. Mostly thine, *O*
Zaratû*s*t! are their worship and their homage; and, through their
ceremonial and obeisance, the liberality of him who is worshipped is
given to thee, *and* righteousness for the soul is with thee; also thy
life exists owing to us, and likewise *thy* body <span
id="fr_977"></span>[5](#fn_968.md), *O* Zaratû*s*t! 21. Forth to thee
*will* I, who am the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, come in both
existences <span id="fr_978"></span>[6](#fn_969.md), as assistance; thou
becomest worthy, *O* Zaratû*s*t! through Khû*r*da*d* *and*
Amû*r*da*d* <span id="fr_979"></span>[7](#fn_970.md), both of them, *and*
through the gratification of

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

me, who am Aûha*r*ma*zd*, by those sayings *and* deeds which I, *who* am
the most propitious of spirits, proclaimed unto thee.'

22\. Zaratû*s*t spoke thus: 'They have become applicants on him who is
powerful *with* thee <span id="fr_980"></span>[1](#fn_971.md).' 23. *And*
Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: 'Thou becomest an applicant and powerful in
the embodied existence.' 24. Zaratû*s*t spoke thus: '*Be* thou a
gratification to us in the slow progress *of* life, *thou* most
beneficent (hû-dahâktûm) of existences! that is, thou shouldst give to
us <span id="fr_981"></span>[2](#fn_972.md).' 25. *And* Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke
thus: 'I *will* gratify thee, *O* righteous Zaratû*s*t! in that best
existence <span id="fr_982"></span>[3](#fn_973.md).'

26\. Excellence *that* is perfect *is* righteousness.
