### CHAPTER LV.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The ninth fargar*d*, Yathâi*s* <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[2](#fn_1308), is *that* by him who praises
Aûha*r*ma*zd* *his* work in the Gâthic lore <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[3](#fn_1309) is taught; even for this reason,
because the reason of the praise even of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is for *his*
works, *and* by him who extols any work the performance

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

of that work is also taught; *moreover* the work of Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
*which is* the Gâthic lore, is pure goodness. 2. This, too, that by him
who increases the propagators of good works priestly-controlled action
(ra*d*îk-kûni*s*nîh) <span id="fr_1338"></span>[1](#fn_1310) is taught;
even for this reason, because the advancement of merit and the action of
priestly chieftainship are the two maxims (vâ*k*akŏ) of one who, when
*there* is reason, exalts progressive merit when he increases the
propagators of good works; and when progressive merit is exalted
priestly-controlled action is praised and also taught.

3\. This, too, that what is worthy, *and* what is coveted for every
worthy *man*, is produced by him for whom the command of the liturgy is
the reckoning for him who is habitually sagacious; and this statement
also indicates the explanation of rulers *and* all who are needing those
of the world for one combined effort, who, in the immature world, *have*
to trust a command that is *at* one time sagacious. 4. This, too, that
personal assistance is liberally given (râ*d*îni*d*ŏ) to the creatures
of the good *beings* by him whose deeds are an assistance of the
renovation *of the universe;* and this statement, too, also indicates
the great power *of* any good work whatever, because every good work,
*being* an assistance of the renovation, becomes liberality *to* the
immature (khâm) creation.

5\. This, too, that whoever teaches to a son reverence unto *his* father
has also appropriated the reward for reverence unto the creator for
teaching that person; even for this reason, because express reverence
unto parents and service to them are connected

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

with reverence unto the creator and service to him. 6. This, too, that
whoever is personally progress for him who is his own <span
id="fr_1339"></span>[1](#fn_1311)—that is, for any one whatever among
those who are needing him—becomes the happiness of the creator who is
the maker of the original good creations; and this statement also
indicates as to whom *it is*, when, through him whose decision is
progress—which *arises* through that which *occurs* when the decision is
given that becomes for every one that which is needful for him—there is
happiness that is concentrated. 7. This, too, that by him who is causing
benefit for him who is a cultivator cattle <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[2](#fn_1312) are multiplied; even for this reason,
because a gratifier of the performers of tillage is multiplying tillage,
*and* cattle are the chief tillage of the world.

8\. This, too, that the religion which is the way of righteousness is
made his own <span id="fr_1341"></span>[3](#fn_1313) by him who is a
good thinker about the religion of righteousness; and this statement,
too, also indicates the limit of reliance (asti*s*nŏ) upon the good
religion; because whoever is not a good thinker about the good religion,
even though he be a reciter of revelation, becomes really an apostate;
whoever is a good thinker, *but* not about the good religion, becomes
really an infidel; and whoever thinks truly becomes a good thinker about
religious righteousness and the statements in the good religion. 9. And
about three statements, the bringer forward *for* all mankind is your
submission to the sacred beings; one is of the produce (bar), one of the
origin (bûn), and

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

one of the body and life; that of the produce is the exertion from which
*there* is produce, that of the origin is the advantage for which the
origin is requisite, and that of the body and life is the thought of the
proposer (râyînî*d*âr), which considered both as submission *to* the
sacred beings. 10. This, too, that connected with the sitting-place of
the sage is the excessiveness *of* the pleasure <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[1](#fn_1314) for those causing pleasure, for the
upper classes (*av*arîgânŏ) of Irân, *and* for the energy
(patûkîh) <span id="fr_1343"></span>[1](#fn_1314) of the diligent.

11\. Excellence *that is* perfect is righteousness.
