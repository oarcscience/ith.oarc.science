### XIV. BAKÂN-YA*S*T NASK <span id="fr_1805"></span>[1](#fn_1756.md).

No allusion to the following three passages, quoted from this Nask,
could be expected in the very short account of it, given in Dk. VIII,
Chap. XV; and they can hardly be traced, with any certainty, in the
Avesta texts of the Ya*s*ts themselves:—

It is just possible that a commentary on Yt. I, 17 may have contained
the Av.-Pahl. passage thus quoted in Vi*g*. <span
id="fr_1806"></span>[2](#fn_1757.md) pp. 160, 161:—'By the Avesta of

<span id="page_471">p. 471</span>

the Baghân-ya*s*t *it* is declared: Ya*d* aêtê yô mazdayasnô aperenâyûkô
avi hê hapta saredha fra*g*asâiti, stehr-paêsanghô aiwy*a*unghânô
paiti*s* hê maidhyâi bû*g*yamanô, avi hê nara pas*k*aiti nemanghe*n*ti:
Whoever of those Ma*zd*a-worshippers is a child who attains unto the age
of seven years, *and* ties the *thread-*girdle on his waist, upon that
man there is thenceforth the maintenance of the obeisances.'

A Pahlavi commentary on Yt. VI, 2 may have formerly contained the
passage thus mentioned in Sls. XII, 17:—'As in the Bâg-yasnô notice is
given about the uncleanness of well-water at night.'

Perhaps one of the five Ya*s*ts, XI, XII, XIII, XV, XVIII, respectively
dedicated to Srôsh, Rashnû, the guardian spirits, the good Vâê, and
Â*s*tâ*d*—the sacred beings specially propitiated by the ceremonies
after a death—may have included a commentary containing the passage thus
quoted in Vi*g*. pp. 157-158, about the necessity of appointing some one
to provide such ceremonies for a man who dies without a son, and to
administer his estate:—'By the Avesta of the Bagân-yast it is declared:
Yêzi narô pa*nk*adasanghô saredhô irîraithyâ*d* avi hê urvânem
bû*g*yânem thrâyô ayara uzayarana rathwô ha*ng*amanem fra*g*asôi*d*,
âa*d* hê aputhra angha*d* puthra fradadhâiti yatha*k*a nara irista
vîspanãm avaretanãm shaêtavaitanãm avi hê frazai*n*tîm fra*g*asôi*d*,
pas*k*aiti nemanguhaiti baoidhyêita*k*a urvâsnay*a*u.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1756"></span>[470:1](sbe37142.htm#fr_1805.md) The account of
this Nask in Dk. VIII, though very short, is a fair description of the
extant Ya*s*ts I-XX, and their general character is also indicated by
the name of the Nask, which means 'the worship of the divinities.' The
extent of these Ya*s*ts may be estimated at about 22,000 words of Avesta
text, and, from the Pahlavi versions of the few Ya*s*ts that still
possess one, it may be calculated that about 44,000 words of Pahlavi
version would have been required for the whole collection.

transcribed in 1754, from an Irânian MS. written in 1240, which the
transcriber found in the Modî library at Surat. The Avesta quotations
are here transliterated without any attempt at amendment.
