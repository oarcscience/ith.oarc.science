### CHAPTER LXVI.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. *In* the twentieth fargar*d*, Vohû-khshathrem <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1](#fn_1467.md), *it is* also stated by Aûha*r*ma*zd*
to Zaratû*s*t the Spîtâmân thus: 'They who are now in sovereignty are
privileged, the human being who is a wicked lying tyrant *being* not now
in sovereignty; moreover, thou shouldst cause *some one* to thoroughly
smite (ba*r*â vânîn-*aê*) him who is causing deception in the embodied
world by lamentation (*s*îvan), and they cause the preservation of
death, ruin, and falsehood because they would cause the preservation of
his effects (mamana*s* var ae bô*g*înênd).' 2. And this, too, namely:
'When the sovereignty should be given by them unto him who is good <span
id="fr_1507"></span>[2](#fn_1468.md), *they* would be preserved through
that sovereignty of his; moreover, thou shouldst cause *some one* to
thoroughly smite him who is made deceitful by lamentation, and *so also*
death, ruin, and falsehood.'

3\. This, too, that by him who shall provide complete mindfulness <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[3](#fn_1469.md) for his own, righteousness is
produced; even for this reason, because, through

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

complete mindfulness, the discerning eye of life, which is
righteousness, is enlightened. 4. This, too, that the coveted *thing*
(î*s*tŏ) which it is expedient for sovereignty to give away <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1](#fn_1470.md) is taught by him who shall provide
sovereignty for him who is all-progressive (hamâk-rûbi*s*nŏ); even for
this reason, because the observation, consideration, and action of him
who is an all-progressive ruler are about that which is coveted *by* the
multitude and is an advantage for the sovereignty which it is expedient
to produce.

5\. This, too, that *what is* produced by the words of Vohûman <span
id="fr_1510"></span>[2](#fn_1471.md) is taught by him who shall perform the
ceremonial of the sacred beings with the thoughts of Vohûman; even for
this reason, because, the mind *being* with the thoughts of Vohûman, the
tongues of the faithful are habituated (khûkînî*d*akŏ) in the statements
of Vohûman. 6. This, too, that innocence from discontinued (amând) good
works is taught by him who remains in virtue; even for this reason,
because *they are* atoned for by him even among important good works.

7\. This, too, that the original causer of goodness is assisted in
causing goodness by him whose fundamental gift (bûn dahi*s*nŏ) among the
existences is that he supplies that which it is requisite for him to
give; even for this reason, because *in* a work, upon which one remains
with a thousand men, when one *man* is bringing his own strength to the
labour therein, the 999 *other* men are assisted by him in that work.

8\. This, too, that the way of righteousness <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[3](#fn_1472.md) is

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

not concealed, *but* taught, by him who is a good considerer as to
righteousness; even for this reason, because the sap and root of his
righteousness are owing to undiverted thought. 9. This, too, that its
*being* unnecessary to provide repletion for those who are cattle <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1](#fn_1473.md) is taught by him who keeps cattle as a
controller *for* benefiters; even for this reason, because they teach
and command him.

10\. This, too, that housewifery <span id="fr_1513"></span>[2](#fn_1474.md)
*being* performed is taught by that wife who shall joyfully pay
reverence *to her* husband; even for this reason, because her
housewifery is for the satisfaction of the husband, the satisfaction is
through her reverence, and the reverence arises through joy. 11. This,
too, that to love the religion through knowledge <span
id="fr_1514"></span>[3](#fn_1475.md) is taught by him who is peaceful
(pa*d*mânîk) *and* Vohûmanic *to* it; even for this reason, because
Vohûmanic peacefulness is understood as religion. 12. And this, too,
that the gratification of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[4](#fn_1476.md) is caused by him who teaches for
Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

13\. It is righteousness *that is* perfect excellence.
