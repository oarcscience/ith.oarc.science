### Footnotes

<span id="fn_264"></span>[99:2](sbe37034.htm#fr_265.md) See Chap. XXII, 6
n.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[101:1](sbe37034.htm#fr_266.md) Here, again, the
repairer of the manuscript has forgotten to note the words in brackets
which he had cut out of the folio before patching it.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[102:1](sbe37034.htm#fr_267.md) According to Bd.
X, 1, XIV, 1, XXVII, 2, fifty-five species of <span id="page_103">p.
103</span> grain sprang up originally where the primeval ox passed away;
a statement which does not agree with that hinted at in this section.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[103:1](sbe37034.htm#fr_268.md) See Chap. XIII, 1.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[104:1](sbe37034.htm#fr_269.md) These six names
are applied to the various grades of assault and wounding, for which a
special scale of punishment is appointed (see Sls. I, 1, 2, XI, 1, 2,
XVI, 1, 5). Here the list begins at the most heinous end of the scale,
and the last three names, which refer to the lightest offences, have
been already explained in Chaps. XIX, 1 n, XX, 64 n. The first three
names are explained in Farh. Oîm, pp. 36, l. 7-37, l. 2, as
follows:—'For whatever reaches the source of life the name is Khôr;
*one* explains B*âz*âî *as* "smiting," *and* Yât *as* "going to,"
*though* it be possible *for* the soul of man to be withstanding; *and*
a counterstroke is the penalty for a Yât when it *has* been so much
*away* from the abode of life.' These six gradations of crime,
therefore, range from the infliction of the nearest possible
approximation to a fatal wound, down to the merely constructive assault
of seizing a weapon. All authorities agree in estimating the relative
heinousness of the first four crimes by the following numbers: 180, 90,
60, and 30; but regarding the amounts for the two lighter offences there
is much difference of statement. In the old law of the Vendîdâ*d* there
are seven gradations of such crime, the lowest four corresponding in
name with the lowest four here, and all punishable by lashes, with a
horse-whip, or scourge, varying from five to two hundred in number,
according to the heinousness of the offence and the number of times it
has been committed.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[104:2](sbe37034.htm#fr_270.md) By scourging, as
prescribed in the Vendîdâ*d*

<span id="fn_270"></span>[104:3](sbe37034.htm#fr_271.md) Owing to sickness,
or any other disabling cause.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[105:1](sbe37034.htm#fr_272.md) Pâz. vôighn.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[105:2](sbe37034.htm#fr_273.md) The fiend of
greediness, *Âz*ŏ.
