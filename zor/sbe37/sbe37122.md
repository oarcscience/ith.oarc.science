#### CHAPTER CLXI.

1\. About *one* supremely <span id="fr_1650"></span>[2](#fn_1609.md)
acquainted with the three <span id="fr_1651"></span>[3](#fn_1610.md) codes
(dâ*d*ŏ) of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion there is *this:—One*
supremely acquainted

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

with the three codes of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion is he *of* the
primitive faith whose insight into the good religion is even such that
he knows *how* to discriminate *and* announce the statements (v*âk*akŏ)
of the Hadha-mãthric and Gâthic from *those of* the Law, *those* of the
Legal *and* Gâthic from *those of* the Hadha-mãthric, and *those* of the
Hadha-mãthric and Legal from *those of* the Gâthas. 2. Also to the
statements (v*âk*akŏ) in the Law—which is superior <span
id="fr_1652"></span>[1](sbe37123.htm#fn_1611.md) knowledge about the
worldly *existences*—is allotted (vakhtŏ) the worldliness *of* the
Hadha-mãthric and also *of* the Gâthic; *to those* in the Gâthas—which
are superior knowledge about the spiritual *existences*—is *allotted*
the spirituality *of* the Hadha-mãthric and even that of the Law; and
*to those* in the Hadha-mãthra—which is superior knowledge about
*things* intermediate *between* the spiritual and worldly
*existences*—is *allotted* the intermediate matter (mîyânîkîh) *of* the
Gâthic *and* also *of* the Legal <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1609"></span>[407:2](sbe37122.htm#fr_1650.md) Perhaps we
should read *av*îrtar, 'more particularly,' instead of *av*artar.

<span id="fn_1610"></span>[407:3](sbe37122.htm#fr_1651.md) B has 'four' by
mistake here, but not afterwards.
