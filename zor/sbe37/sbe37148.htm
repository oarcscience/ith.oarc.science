<p>It is doubtful how much of this Nask is still extant. Traditionally, the two fragments published by Westergaard as Yt. XXI, XXII (excepting XXII, 37-42), and by Haug as Hn. I, II, III, are said to belong to this Nask; but no allusion to Hn. II, III can be found in the account given in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, and Hn. I can be traced in that account only by assuming that the Ahunavair is therein mentioned (in &sect; 1) instead of its accompanying Ashem-voh&ucirc;, as it appears to be in Hn. I, 4. In Yt. XI we also appear to have a form of the Sr&ocirc;sh Ya<I>s</I>t derived from the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht Nask, or used in the liturgy when that Nask was recited, and this Ya<I>s</I>t likewise refers (in &sect; 3) to the Ahunavair in similar terms to those used in Hn. I, 4.</p>  
<p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 1, refers to the passage which contained the statement about the Ahunavair already mentioned and also thus quoted in Sls.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> XII, 19:&#151;'It says in the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht that of the sayings which are spoken out the Ahunavair is that <I>which is</I> most triumphant.'</p>  
<p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 4, refers to the passage which probably contained the statements thus quoted in the <I>&Acirc;</I>f<I>r&icirc;</I>n-i Gahanb&acirc;r, 14-19 (Sp.), concerning the righteous gifts to be given away, for the sake of the soul, at each of the six season-festivals:&#151;'There is an Avesta witness manifest in the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht from the passage (<I>in the case of the Maidhy&ocirc;-zaremaya festival</I>): "Hazangrem ma&ecirc;shin&atilde;m da&ecirc;nun&atilde;m paitiputhran&atilde;m nar&atilde;m ashaon&atilde;m ashaya vanghuya urun&ecirc; para-daithy&acirc;<I>d</I>, a&ecirc;vah&ecirc; h&acirc;t&atilde;m <I>k</I>inm&acirc;nah&ecirc; ya<I>d</I> ashah&ecirc; vahi<I>s</I>tah&ecirc;."' During the other five festivals the gifts, instead of ewes, are to be cows, mares, camels, and all kinds of herds and seeds, respectively, as appears from the corresponding passages. All six passages, mingled with further Avesta text, occur in several MSS. of the &Acirc;fr&icirc;ng&acirc;n-i Gahanb&acirc;r (see the earlier part of each section of Af. Gab. 7-12, ed. Geldner).</p>  
<p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 9, probably refers to the passage which contained the statement thus quoted in Sd. XL, 4:&#151;'In the commentary of the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht it says:&#151;"M&acirc; &acirc;z&acirc;ray&ocirc;i<I>s</I>, Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! m&acirc; Pourushaspem, m&acirc; Dughdhov&atilde;m&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1834"></A><A HREF="#fn_1784"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, m&acirc; a&ecirc;thrapaiti<I>s</I>:&#151;It is not desirable that thou, O Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t! <I>shouldst</I> distress <I>thy</I> father, <I>or</I> mother, <I>or</I> priest."'</p>  
<p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 10, may possibly refer to</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_484"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 484</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the passage which contained a statement that is often partially quoted in Pahlavi colophons, and the Avesta text of which constitutes Yas. LXXII, (Gld.); the first part of the statement, with a translation of its Pahlavi version, is here quoted from Mit<I>r</I>&ocirc;-<I>&acirc;</I>p&acirc;n's colophon to a volume of miscellaneous Pahlavi texts, usually called the Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp-sh&acirc;hn&acirc;mak from the subject of its first text, and written A.D. 1322, in which the writer mentions the source from which he quotes; and the second part is taken from the same writer's colophon to the Yasna MS. K5, written thirteen months later, which is the only known authority for this part of the text:&#151;'In one passage of the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht it is declared that A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t thus:&#151;"A&ecirc;v&ocirc; pa<I>n</I>t<I>a</I>u y&ocirc; ashah&ecirc; visp&ecirc; anya&ecirc;sh&atilde;m apant&atilde;m:&#151;one only is the way of righteousness, all those are no ways:&#151;angrah&ecirc; mainy<I>e</I>us nasi<I>s</I>t&atilde;m&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1835"></A><A HREF="#fn_1785"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> da&ecirc;n&atilde;m da&ecirc;vayasnan&atilde;m par&acirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;t&icirc;m ma<I>s</I><I>h</I>y&acirc;n&atilde;m&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1836"></A><A HREF="#fn_1786"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> fr&acirc;kereit&icirc;m:&#151;which the evil spirit of the heretical demon-worshippers, the wizard, has forced on to mankind."'</p>  
<p>Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV, 13, must refer to the passage which contained the statement thus mentioned in Sls. XIII, 10:&#151;'The fifteen stanzas of Y&acirc;-<I>s</I><I>h</I>yaothan&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1837"></A><A HREF="#fn_1787"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are for this reason, because it is given for the destruction of those fifteen fiends who are declared in the medical part of the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht.'</p>  
<p>No allusion to the following seven passages, quoted from this Nask, has been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chap. XLV:&#151;</p>  
<p>In Sls. XII, 30, it is stated that 'in the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht</p>

<p>it says that a woman who shall be reverent is to be considered as much as she who is suitable.'</p>  
<p>In Sls. XIII, 6, it is said that 'the twenty-two stanzas of T&acirc;-v<I>e</I>-urv&acirc;t&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1838"></A><A HREF="#fn_1788"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are the twenty-two judgments of which it speaks in the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht thus: "Anaom&ocirc; manangh&ecirc; daya v&icirc;sp&acirc;i kva, kva par&ocirc;?&#151;Lodging in the judge, that while <I>he has</I> twenty-two judgments <I>he may be</I> more just."'</p>  
<p>In Sd. XXII, 3, 4, it is stated that 'in the commentary of the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht it says, that every one who performs intercession, and extracts anything from a person on their account, and conveys <I>it</I> to them is as much without dishonesty towards them, as he who may have given to them out of his own property. And <I>in</I> the spiritual <I>existence</I> they take account of that profit for him, and just as they make <I>out</I> the account of the good work of that person who may have given <I>it</I>, even so much is his good work.'</p>  
<p>In Vi<I>g</I>. p. 12, it is said, with reference to Aharman, '<I>that</I> he is a creature <I>of</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is manifest from the Avesta <I>of</I> the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht: "D&acirc;ta, Ahura spe<I>n</I>ta! Mazd<I>a</I>u."'</p>  
<p>In Vi<I>g</I>. pp. 23-25, it is said that, 'if any one passes away from the bodily existence, as much of his wealth comes to his son, wife, and daughter as is declared by the Avesta <I>of</I> the H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1839"></A><A HREF="#fn_1789"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:&#151;"&Acirc;a<I>d</I> y&ecirc;zi avi h&ecirc; anguh&ecirc; astvai<I>n</I>ti, Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra!&#151;So if in that bodily existence, <I>O</I> Sp&icirc;t&acirc;m&acirc;n Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t!&#151;nar&atilde;m v&acirc; n&acirc;irin&atilde;m v&acirc; para-irithy&acirc;<I>d</I>,&#151;<I>of</I> males or</p>
