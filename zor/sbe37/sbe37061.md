### CHAPTER XII.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The eleventh fargar*d*, the Yasna <span
id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_556.md), is about the assembly of the angels of
the spiritual *existences* on account of the complaint of fire; and the
complaint of fire in the assembly, with *its* statement of this,
too <span id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_557.md): 'I am not *of the world*
here, and from here I *will* extricate *myself*, from the earth up to
the sky, and there I *will* shine on to the earth of seven regions, like
the moon and sun and even the divinely-produced stars when they shine
with their own light.' 2. The words of Aûha*r*ma*zd* about the just
complaining of fire as regards the contamination <span
id="fr_563"></span>[3](#fn_558.md) of the creatures, the impossibility of
keeping the fire undisturbed, and satisfying the fire concerning the
creation of the creatures for the worldly *existence, along* with the
disturbed condition of fire, too, owing to the impossibility of
maintaining <span id="fr_564"></span>[4](#fn_559.md) the uncreated state
which, with the freedom from disturbance of fire also, was better;
*likewise* proclaiming the care *of it*. 3. And the speech of the fire
*was* thus: 'If *there be* not that one mode whereby I *may* thus shine,
owing to those that *have* acted according to my request <span
id="fr_565"></span>[5](#fn_560.md), thou art aware, O Aûha*r*ma*zd*!
*there*

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

*are some* among the creatures that I cannot grant so much *to*;
therefore carry me away, O Aûha*r*ma*zd*! then give me away there! and
be thou carrying *me* away into the midst of Aîrân-v*êg* <span
id="fr_566"></span>[1](#fn_561.md)!'

4\. The propitious <span id="fr_567"></span>[2](#fn_562.md) fire is from
the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and it is produced by him in a dwelling,
without *being* handled (ba*r*â sû*d*akŏ) <span
id="fr_568"></span>[3](#fn_563.md), by aid of bringing together <span
id="fr_569"></span>[4](#fn_564.md). 5. And so he spoke in words thus: 'Such
is thine own growth, thou who art my fire! in every dwelling where thou
comest, and *in* every village, every community, and every province; and
as exalted as thou are the water and plants, and *he*, too, who is a
guardian spirit of the righteous, when they shall bring forward
holy-water for delivering up *to* thee <span
id="fr_570"></span>[5](#fn_565.md); *and*, when they shall bring forward to
thee firewood which is dry, a person—through the light which he
observes—*has* spoken of it thus: "This is the Gû*s*n-as*p* <span
id="fr_571"></span>[6](#fn_566.md) fire."'

6\. About so much reward of the hewer and inspector and kindler of the
firewood—when all three shall do *it* for the sake of affection—as
*they*

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

*are* possessing righteousness. 7. About the character *and* reward of
the washer (âsnôtâr) and the producer of the purity and cleansing of
that which the fire *has* dropped <span id="fr_572"></span>[1](#fn_567.md),
*of* the introducer of the firewood and the washer upwards <span
id="fr_573"></span>[2](#fn_568.md), *of* the stirrer of the fire and the
carrier-away of the firewood, who are strictly directed; the lawful work
done with a *cooking-*pot *and* such-like, and the sin of him who is a
disturber of it. 8. About the destroyer of that which the fire *has*
dropped, and the introducer of damp firewood into it. 9. About the
blessing of fire for people by whom *it is* satisfied.

10\. About advice as regards not bringing to the fire that which is due
to theft, *or* the power of extortion, and the grievous
bridge-judgment <span id="fr_574"></span>[3](#fn_569.md) of him who is
bringing *it; also* the defilement (âlû*d*an) and hurting of the fire
from that which *occurs* when he likewise consecrates his hoard
(hanbari*s*nŏ), owing to the corruption by the demons <span
id="fr_575"></span>[4](#fn_570.md) thus arisen. 11. This, too, that *it is*
owing to want of attention to fire when *it is* not at every menstrual
excitement they produce, *in* a woman assisted by a propensity

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

for a son (pûs ra*d*îh), *that* the progeny is a son. 12. And about the
penalty for <span id="fr_576"></span>[1](#fn_571.md) the progress of other
impropriety which occurs to fire; also *about* the person who has
attained to the guardianship of fire and does not lawfully control *it*.

13\. About an admonition to Zaratû*s*t as to consecrating *to* the
sacred beings anything whatever which *one* eats, and not eating *what
is* unconsecrated. 14. About the wish of the evil spirit that no one
shall be performing (vadîdûnâñ-â*d*ŏ) worship and obeisance to the
sacred beings, and *that the people* shall possess no ruler and
high-priest, so that no desire of theirs shall arise for any
virtuousness. 15. About an admonition as to indispensably worshipping
the sacred beings with the best ceremonial, that of a priest (âsrûkŏ)
without sin; *or with* an average *one*, that of a priest whose sin is
not more than one Aredû*s* <span id="fr_577"></span>[2](#fn_572.md) without
a basis (*a*-bûn); *or with* the lowest *one*, that of a priest whose
*sin* is not more than one Khôr <span id="fr_578"></span>[3](#fn_573.md) on
a basis (pavan bûn). 16. Whoever, in a village of Ma*zd*a-worshippers,
*has* not chanted the *sacred* hymns after fifteen years *of age*,
through sinfulness, is as a dog they *have* thrown provisions *to*, and
it *has* occurred for a basis of the sin of unseasonable
chattering <span id="fr_579"></span>[4](#fn_574.md); also the
inadmissibility of his soul by Mânsarspend <span
id="fr_580"></span>[5](#fn_575.md),

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

17\. About the coming of Ast-vîdâ*d* <span
id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_576.md), at all times, to mortals whom death has
reached <span id="fr_582"></span>[2](#fn_577.md), and also whom *it has*
not. 18. About the ideas of the wicked, that the best existence does not
exist, *that* the production of the renovation *of the universe* does
not occur, *that there are* no dead whom they raise up thereby, and *it
is* not that change *one* attains. 19. This, too, that is false, for the
same *reason* they observe, *being* wicked; because the best existence
exists, *there* occurs a production of the renovation which is good,
they raise up the dead thereby, and thus *one* attains that change.

20\. About an admonition as to not making lamentation and weeping over
those passed away; and, after the passing away of every righteous *one*
of the religion to the spirits, *one* is not to augment the distress of
the very spirit of life by making lamentation and weeping over the
departed. 21. And this, too, that the guardian spirits of the righteous
claim no lamentation and weeping after their own ceremonial and the
blessing of righteous men. 22. This, too, that the body of every one is
not of like will with the soul; food is the desire of the body, and also
a store of wealth; righteous action is the desire of the soul, and also
the gifts which they give away.

23\. About an enquiry of the righteous Zaratû*s*t as to who it is who
has banished (*â*pârinî*d*ŏ) all goodness and perfection from his own
*self, but* thinks *them* not banished, and does not complain of

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

that loss <span id="fr_583"></span>[1](#fn_578.md). 24. And the reply of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, that it is he *who* is deceived <span
id="fr_584"></span>[2](#fn_579.md) by his own tongue through the utterance
of words, so that, through speaking falsely, he has become worthy of
death. 25. This, too, that for him it is the weapon of the evil spirit;
*even* so complete mindfulness is the reign of Spenda*r*ma*d* <span
id="fr_585"></span>[3](#fn_580.md), and thus a liar is more a power for the
religion when a man, on account of dulness of thought, *gives* no reply,
so that he *may* not speak falsely through dulness of thought.

26\. This, too, that he worships the demons with thousand-fold
holy-water, who establishes him who is not a member of the
community <span id="fr_586"></span>[4](#fn_581.md) in the Zôti duty <span
id="fr_587"></span>[5](#fn_582.md), sooner than him who is a wise Zôti. 27.
And this, too, that thou shouldst fetch him who is a member of the
community for the Zôti duty, not him who is not a member of the
community, for thus thy advance is to the supreme heaven (garô*d*mânŏ).
28. Also this, that a bad Zôti is worse from the Zôti duty.

29\. This, too, that that which is the earliest controller (ayûkhtâr) of
sin is thought *which* is subdued <span id="fr_588"></span>[6](#fn_583.md),
then forgiveness, then shame, and then listening; and, afterwards,
through the sinfulness of the fiend <span
id="fr_589"></span>[7](#fn_584.md),

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

*one* becomes a promise-breaker. 30. This, too, that they shall bring
every man who is a wounder before the convocation *composed of* any
priest who is a controller of recitation (srâyi*s*nŏ ayûkhtâr), any
priest who is of the district (âdehîk), any priest who is of an
out-district (aû*z*dehîk), and any priest who is *the man's* own
kinsman.

31\. 'Thus say I unto thee, O Spîtâmân! let *there be* no breach of
promise; neither when the conversation, that they would make a support,
*was* with the wicked, and there is no great judiciousness in it; nor
when *it was* with those of thine own religion, the righteous, as to
anything *of* great judiciousness; because both of them are promises,
both *with* the wicked and the righteous <span
id="fr_590"></span>[1](#fn_585.md).'

32\. It is the excellence *of* righteousness *that is* perfect.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[191:2](sbe37061.htm#fr_573.md) Pahl. f*râz*
âsnâtâr must mean one who washes in the mode defined by the Av.
frasnâiti, as distinguished from upasnâiti, in Vend. VIII, 98, 99, Ep.
II, iii, 2; this mode is explained as lâlâîk, 'upwards,' and
distinguished from the frô*d*gûnŏ, 'downward mode,' in Ep. II, iv, 2.
