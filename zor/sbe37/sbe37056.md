### CHAPTER VII.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The sixth fargar*d*, A*d*-tâ-vakhshyâ <span
id="fr_512"></span>[1](#fn_508.md), is about the perfection of the five
excellences: the first through righteousness, the second through
virtuous offspring, the third through land producing vegetation, the
fourth through flocks of sheep, and the fifth through training in
industry. 2. About the distribution of fortune to the diligent; and *of*
destitution to the indolent. 3. About the acquirement of fortune singly
sitting, two-fold even walking, three-fold hastening, four-fold even
running, five-fold even carrying on a horse, six-fold even driving on a
road, seven-fold by understanding legal proceedings, eight-fold by good
protection even of wealth, nine-fold by intelligence *and* diligence in
the cultivation of land, and ten-fold by providing the teaching of the
bounteous texts <span id="fr_513"></span>[2](#fn_509.md).

4\. About the grievous sorrow *of* an aged man, owing to the indolence
of any one in youth. 5. About the four things through which, when a man
has

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

amassed *them* in his youth, he becomes very pleased in old age: first,
virtuous learning; second, productive wealth; third, a good wife; *and*
fourth, a prosperous dwelling. 6. About the five store-holders <span
id="fr_514"></span>[1](sbe37057.htm#fn_510.md) of perfect excellence:
industry, diligence, contentment, guileless understanding
(nîrikht-hûshîh), and provision of means.

7\. About abstaining from sitting with drunkards. 8. And this, too, that
he does not drink varieties of wine (mâê-gunagânŏ) with the approval of
the sacred beings, who becomes a viciously-disposed assailant and
annoyer of others, and a disturber (k*ê*pînî*d*âr) of duties, through
drinking varieties of wine. 9. And this, too, that thou shouldst eat
that which is your food where *there is* a suitable place. 10. And where
*it is* eaten by thee it should be lightly, it should not be heavily, so
that, when *it is* eaten by thee, a good work is performed, and *there
is* abstinence from sin. 11. And, so that what thou eatest shall be
immortally joyful to thee, where *there are* poor, provide *them* a
share, and the poor *will* bless thee; and, *as to* a poor *man* who is
righteous, the opinion is *that* his blessing is best.

12\. Excellence *that* is perfect *is* righteousness.
