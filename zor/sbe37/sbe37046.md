### CHAPTER XLIII.

*Sakâ*d*ûm Nask*.

1\. One section is miscellaneous: about *having* sought an assistant who
is brought, that is, in what mode *it* is proper; *and* the payment of
an assistant who is a member of the community (dâhm) <span
id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_348), and also that of a foreigner (an-Aîr.md),
in the same affair. 2. About how the coming of a man to confinement and
fettering is through his own wealth, and whatever is on the same
subject. 3. About confession through one, two, and three statements;
*and* whatever is about it. 4. About the contempt *of* a disciple for a
*priestly* master, which is an annoyance to him; the property
*belonging* to the master, and the squandering that occurs in *it*.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

5\. The sin that is its own penalty through *being* liable to penalty,
*and* the transgressor whose penalty is owing thereto; when they would
unlawfully bring a penalty upon *one* liable to penalty, or *one*
thereby inflicts a penalty *upon* him, of which *one* is aware that *he*
is not capable (patûkŏ); and the time which *one* liable to penalty
*has* for the payment of that penalty of *his* is until his attaining to
opulence, when, after the appointment about the penalty, he becomes
capable of an atonement. 6. About the accumulation (gan*g*îh) of sin
through the expedients of the wrathful (garmakân), which are connected
with much destruction of the righteous. 7. About the sin owing to which,
among those that are wrathful, *he* who *has* drunk from a well on a
road, *or* path, conceals the water for the sake of concealment.

8\. About the sin of a judge who pronounces the sinner *to be* in
innocence, and the innocent *to be* in some sinfulness. 9. About a judge
acquainted with the law <span id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_349.md) *for* ten
years, him who is *for* eleven, him who is *for* twelve, him who is
*for* thirteen, him who is for *fourteen*, *and* him who is *for*
fifteen; that is, their decisions, each separately, on several specially
prominent objects of acquaintance with the law, as regards decision and
judgment.

10\. About a daughter whose religious control, during the life of her
father, *resides* in *her* mother for the joint life of the mother, but
for <span id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_350.md) the authorised giving *her
away there* is the father. 11. About a daughter who is unprovided with a
husband, *and*

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

who *has* no father and no mother, nor yet any of the brothers of the
departed parents, *and it* is not even allowable to give herself away
into guardianship by a husband.

12\. About property which is *bequeathed* by will *on* passing away;
that is, how it is when given, *and* how it is when it does not exist.
13. About the privilege of a father in giving property to *his* children
according to his wish, and a son who is irreverent towards *his* father,
so that <span id="fr_353"></span>[1](#fn_351.md) *some* of the property of
the father *goes* to the worthy mother; also when they would make
irreverence towards the father the imputed characteristic (bâkht
nî*s*ânŏ), where a decree about the property of the father is decided
upon; *and* whatever is on the same subject, as regards the extent of
irreverence *of* the son towards the father, and the sin of it.

14\. About the sin of a son <span id="fr_354"></span>[2](#fn_352.md) who is
accepted, when he recoils from that acceptance; the accepter of a
living, *or* even a departed, father is *so* because *it is* the will
*of* the people, and also *for* the worldly fame of a soul of the
departed; and the ceremonial *and* obeisance are, moreover, for those of
them within their own dwelling, owing to letting forth their generosity,
and they shall provide them.

15\. About the production *and* arising of even that property which a
liberal person *has* not seen, *if* there be any one who <span
id="fr_355"></span>[3](#fn_353.md) *has* not lived liberally.

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 16. About the
production *and* arising of something of the property of a damsel, even
when she gives *it* by design only to him *who* is worthy.

17\. About a damsel whom an idolator (dêvîyast) carries off from her own
master, *and* would give. to a Ma*zd*a-worshipper; that is, how *it is*
justifiable for the Ma*zd*a-worshipper, *having* had that damsel in
*his* possession, to seek a son by *her*, so long as the guardianship of
the woman is with that man. 18. About a mother *being* guardian over a
living father, owing to *their having* a son. 19. About the proper
completion of a provision—that was for the decision *of* the supreme
judge, *on* various statements, and was never otherwise—which is the
provision *of him* who is a high-priest of the religion.

20\. About the sin of a father through not satisfying the menstrual
excitement of a daughter who *has* attained the capability of *having* a
son (be*r*man ra*d*îh); what it is when, through not satisfying the
menstrual excitement of the daughter, *he is* sinful; and how it is when
the daughter herself is sinful; also the symptoms of attaining the
capability of *having* a son.

21\. About where *and* which is that sin on the committal of which
inadvertently *one* attains to deliverance thus, when it comes to his
knowledge *it is* through a determined renunciation it goes away from
*its* source; *also* which is that committal inadvertently which does
not occur through him who is intelligent. 22. About the four more
heinous *forms of* demon-service (*s*êdâ-y*az*akîh), and the three worst
sins wherein they shall perform *them;* the ten existences that are
furtherances, and the nine that are destroyers, *of* the world.

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

23\. About a true *statement* through which, when *one* utters *it, he*
is wicked *and* worthy of death. 24. About driving the bestowable
benefit of the spiritual *existence* away from the world, when he who is
destroying a righteous *man* walks openly in the world; how one section
*of* the spirit's earth is that of a people <span
id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_354.md) destroying the righteous *man*, and the
complaint of the spirits of fire, water, and plants, owing thereto;
*also* how the bestowal of the allotment of a leading man is upon his
inferiors. 25. About the three kinds *of* righteous men; one that is
greater than water *and* earth, animals *and* plants, one that is equal
*to them*, and one that is less; and what is the arrangement of—as *it
were*—the conjoined formation of those who are somewhat outside of the
three kinds.

26\. About the grievous bridge*-judgment* for carrying forth dead matter
to water, or to fire, with which *there* is evidence; and the heaviness
of the spirit due to dead matter in the water. 27. The good work of him
who brings the dead matter <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_355.md) *of*
man *or* dog,

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

*or* that of the serpent *or* frog, out of the water. 28. About the
destruction of the serpent and frog, and other aquatic noxious
creatures, in the water when it is *only* thus possible, *and* carrying
*them* out from it when it is possible. 29. About the gratification of
the spirit of the world, *and* the vexation of the demons, owing to the
destruction of them.

30\. Where *and* what are the tokens of the good <span
id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_356.md) management and well-operating
drinking-party (tô*s*tîh) of a neighbour not of the same district
(ahamshat*r*ô nazd). 31. About the sin of him who, after joining a
drinking-party from sunset (hû-frâshmôkdâ*d*ŏ), pulverizes the road (râh
tekhnunê*d*ŏ), keeps the door opened, *and* would unlawfully make an
uproar.

32\. About Aûha*r*ma*zd* *having* produced the bodies *and* members of
animals—through *having* created the body of the sole-created ox with
satisfaction, as assistance for mankind—because *they* are repeated for
protection, and also *for* the ceremonial for sacred beings specially
declared. 33. About the reason of making offerings (aûstôfrî*d*ŏ) to the
sacred beings, for the increase of power of the allotters of destiny in
the allotment of destiny; the connection of that acknowledgement
(pa*d*îri*s*nŏ) and *of* the benefit *and* advantage of the recompense
thereof; the proper maintenance *of* that acknowledgement, through the
means *and* efficacy *of* the spiritual bridge*-judgment* of sin, and
the fear of worldly disaster and harm from not properly maintaining the
perpetual acknowledgement in force

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (dên patûkîh),
*and from* the setting up even of ruin thereby; the reasonable control
of the offering to each one of the sacred beings therein is for the
skilful member of the community (hûnarîk dâhm) of whatever kind, *and*
is not produced by intrusting the consecration to the violent, more
particularly to those whom *one* specially enumerates; the sin and
retribution owing to *having* given *it* to those who are of that class;
*and* more upon the same subject.

34\. About the damage and injury of the world owing to greed (*âz*ŏ) and
its fellow-miscreations, *and* him who is their supporter and abettor,
the idolator (dêvîyastô), also the wolf of many kinds and noxious
creatures of various species; because the occurrence of their
fiendishness is due to the original fiend, *and* the means for
strengthening their fiendishness are *derived* from the destruction of
all mankind *and* the other primary worldly creations which are aiding
mankind. 35. Advice to mankind about smiting and destroying the evil
domination (dû*s*khshasarînî*d*anŏ) of the world *by* those *injurers*,
and the merit manifest for them*selves* therein; the object *and*
spiritual reward for smiting *and* killing each one of the wolves *and*
noxious creatures, *and*, as regards the same reward, the perfection of
that for destroying a two-legged wolf <span
id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_357.md); *and* whatever is on the same subject.

36\. About advice as to not reverencing the evil spirit and demons,
whereby the observing (var’*z*ŏ) of the several ceremonies and
gratifications of the sacred beings *would be* more particularly
irregular in *any* manner whatever, and the damage and

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

harm *owing* to those *who are* irregular *and* ill-observant, through
being inclined for that irregularity *and* ill-observance, *would*
become an oppressive presidence (pa*d*gahîh) of the demons over the
creatures; also the vice of clamorous talking (drâyân gôgîh) <span
id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_358.md) and the damage owing thereto, *and* the
pleasure of the demons due to the same *and* other *things* which are
irregular. 37. Advice about the reason, habit, *and* primitive practice
of not chattering, and other good customs, during eating *and* drinking;
the gratification of the sacred beings owing to that primitive practice
of good customs *by* mankind, and the unself-devoting (a-khvê*s*-dâk) is
he who is not maintaining *it*.

38\. Through the ceremonial of which sacred being is the greater welcome
(mâhmânŏtarîh) of a high-priest *and of* any good work *of* each one of
the five periods of the day and night; the reward and advantage owing to
celebrating the ceremony of each of them separately in its own period,
and also other means *and* regulations in the same statement.

39\. It is righteousness *that is* perfect excellence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_348"></span>[145:1](sbe37046.htm#fr_350.md) The
contradistinction here indicated between dâhm and an-Aîr is an important
confirmation of Geldner's definition of Av. dahma as 'Vollbürger oder
Mitglieder' (see Studien zum Avesta, 1882, p. 14).

<span id="fn_349"></span>[146:1](sbe37046.htm#fr_351.md) See Chaps. XX, 74,
XXII, 2r.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[146:2](sbe37046.htm#fr_352.md) Reading râî
instead of lâ, 'not.'

<span id="fn_351"></span>[147:1](sbe37046.htm#fr_353.md) As aêgh also means
'where,' it is rather uncertain whether the irreverence is supposed to
be the cause, or the effect, of the special provision for the mother
which afterwards becomes a source of litigation.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[147:2](sbe37046.htm#fr_354.md) An adopted son
must be meant.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[147:3](sbe37046.htm#fr_355.md) Supposing that min
stands for mûn.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[149:1](sbe37046.htm#fr_356.md) Some neighbouring
nation of unbelievers is probably meant, such as the Byzantines; as we
must always recollect that the compiler is summarizing the contents of
the Pahlavi commentary written in Sasanian times (see Chap. I, 3).

<span id="fn_355"></span>[149:2](sbe37046.htm#fr_357.md) See Chap. XXVII,
4. It appears from this section that the dead matter of an evil
creature, such as a snake or frog, was considered to pollute the water
as much as that of a good creature. § 28, however, admits the expediency
of killing noxious creatures in the water when it is impossible to take
them out beforehand; and this is in accordance with Vend. V, 35-38 (W.)
which teaches that an apostate defiles no one when dead (any more than a
dried-up frog that has been dead a year), because he defiles while
living. This rule was evidently intended to remove all scruples as to
killing such creatures, but it applies to them only when recently
killed; hence the necessity of removing them, from any place liable to
<span id="page_150">p. 150</span> pollution, as soon as possible after
death, common sense being preferable to logical consistency.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[150:1](sbe37046.htm#fr_358.md) Supposing that vûp
stands for khûp.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[151:1](sbe37046.htm#fr_359.md) A term applied to
an idolator.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[152:1](sbe37046.htm#fr_360.md) Whereby the
devotions are disturbed, or rendered ineffectual.
