### CHAPTER XXV.

*Var*s*tmânsar Nask*.

1\. The second fargar*d*, Yathâ-ahû-vairyô <span
id="fr_768"></span>[2](#fn_763.md), is about the worthiness, as to worldly
and spiritual virtue, in a ruler and *in* the production of a
high-priest's

efficiency; *and* they *have* been suitable for leadership and priestly
authority with whom *there is* an existence of it; *also* other talent
through which sovereignty and priestly authority are appropriated, and
*which* the ruler or high-priest himself possesses.

2\. 'My wish (dôsh), O Zaratû*s*t! is *that* thou *be* in spiritual
lordship and priestly authority, because thou art, O Zaratû*s*t!
provided with a spiritual lord *and* possessing priestly
instruction—that is, they consider thee, too, as high-priest—*and* it is
because thine is the accomplishment of rites, that thou art quite
preserved when *there is* an encounter of the demons with thee—that is,
a dispute of apostates with thee.' 3. It is non-possession of a ruler
and high-priest, *or* non-possession of a ruler <span
id="fr_769"></span>[1](#fn_764.md), *that* became the nature and law of the
demons; and the maintenance of Aûha*r*ma*zd* *and* the archangels, as
ruler and high-priest, and the dominion of Aûha*r*ma*zd* *are* combined
with beneficence.

4\. This, too, that through righteousness a priestly instructor (ra*d*ŏ)
is a ruler at will, a sage and benefactor, a cherisher and cleanser
(âsnî*d*âr) of the poor; also the fitness for the supreme heaven
(garô*d*mânîkîh) of all those who are accepting the religion which
*proceeds* from Zaratû*s*t.

5\. Of righteousness the excellence is perfect.
