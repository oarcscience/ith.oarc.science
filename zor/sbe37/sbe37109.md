### CHAPTER LX.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The fourteenth fargar*d*, A*d*-fravakhshyâ <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[3](#fn_1402), is *that* whatever is instruction is
to be listened to <span id="fr_1436"></span>[4](#fn_1403) here as much
as is possible, *and* he who is not to be

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

taught is allowed an opportunity *for* listening by Zaratû*s*t.

2\. This, too, that by him who would be a causer of procreation for
performers of labour, the perfect nature of the performance of the first
next-of-kin marriage <span id="fr_1437"></span>[1](#fn_1404) is praised;
because causing the procreation of performers of labour is the
fatherhood of mankind, the proper fatherhood of mankind is through the
proper production of progeny, the proper progeny of the producer is
through the accomplishment of progeny among his own, according to the
disposition of the first creatures, and the accomplishment of progeny
among one's own is next-of-kin marriage; and that which *occurs*, when a
causer of the procreation of performers of labour praises the fatherhood
of mankind, *is that* next-of-kin marriage is also praised by him. 3.
This, too, that by him whose creatures are in virtue, owing to his
virtuous nourishment *of* the creatures, the performance of next-of-kin
marriage <span id="fr_1438"></span>[2](#fn_1405) is taught, *and* the
virtue is his virtue; even on this account, because, for the sake of
keeping the creatures in virtue, he allows (and*âz*ê*d*ŏ) for the
virtuous disposition pertaining to the multitude, *and* that which is
born he produces (dahê*d*ŏ) as lineage from the next-of-kin marriage
pertaining to the multitude.

4\. This, too, that Spenda*r*ma*d* is in daughterhood <span
id="fr_1439"></span>[3](#fn_1406) to Aûha*r*ma*zd* is taught by him
whose wisdom is through complete mindfulness; even for this reason,

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

because *his* wisdom *and* complete mindfulness are within limits which
are Aûha*r*ma*zd* and Spenda*r*ma*d*, the wisdom *being* that of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the complete mindfulness that of Spenda*r*ma*d*, and the
complete mindfulness *being* the offspring of the wisdom just as
Spenda*r*ma*d* is of Aûha*r*ma*zd*; and, owing to this, the assertion is
reasonable that, by him whose complete mindfulness is connected with
wisdom, it is taught *that* Spenda*r*ma*d* is in daughterhood to
Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 5. This, too, that thus the exercise of that daughterhood
is taught by him whose righteousness is through complete mindfulness,
and whose ceremonial is also through complete mindfulness; that is, he
shall perform the ceremonial and other good works fully mindfully.

6\. This, too, that mankind are attracted to religious good deeds by him
who shall provide benefit for the people through actions *and* words;
even for this reason, because those actions are religious good deeds,
and, when instituted by him, *others* are also taught by him. 7. This,
too, that reverence for Vohûman <span id="fr_1440"></span>[1](#fn_1407)
is taught by him who shall make that which is contaminated obvious to
the eye, so that what is dark *becomes* light; even for this reason,
because the display of the work of Vohûman thereby has also taught the
offer of reverence *for* Vohûman. 8. And this, too, that the ceremonial
is taught with complete mindfulness <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[2](#fn_1408) only *by him* who teaches words and
actions with complete mindfulness.

9\. Perfect righteousness is excellence.
