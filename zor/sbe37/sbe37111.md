### CHAPTER LXII.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The sixteenth fargar*d*, Spe*n*tâ-mainyû <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[3](#fn_1424), is *that* the religion is lodging in
him who is himself wise, or becomes a hearer of the wise. 2. This, too,
that the deeds of complete mindfulness are practised <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[4](#fn_1425) and taught by him who becomes himself
completely mindful. 3. This, too, that *whoever* shall openly perform
good works becomes a nourisher of good works.

4\. This, too, that the spirit of fatherhood becomes lodging in him who
nourishes the creatures with propriety <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[5](#fn_1426). 5. This, too, that pasture is
given <span id="fr_1460"></span>[6](#fn_1427) to cattle is taught by him
who shall provide care *for* cattle, because the giving of pasture to
them with care is advantageous.

6\. This, too, that all for his good who becomes a benefit to him who is
good <span id="fr_1461"></span>[7](#fn_1428)—*through* that which

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

has come to him—is every benefit which occurs to him who is good; all
*for* his good every benefit is given to every *one* good by way of
similarity in race, species, and nature, and every benefit is given in
the way of complete giving which is possible for it.

7\. This, too, that whoever shall justly inflict sentence and judgment,
really according to the declaration regarding *one* acquitted *or*
convicted <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1](#fn_1429), becomes praiseworthy;
even for this reason, because the origin of the judgment is the ritual
of the ordeal. 8. And this, too, that by him who gives to him who is
wise that which is needful for him, an immense <span
id="fr_1463"></span>[2](#fn_1430) *and* strong foundation for learning
is produced, *and* the knowledge in the world is augmented.

9\. Perfect excellence is righteousness.
