Textual Heritage

### CHAPTER XIV.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The thirteenth fargar*d*, Ta*d*-thwâ-peresâ <span
id="fr_595"></span>[3](#fn_590.md),

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

is about the strength *and* mightiness of the spirit of the sacred
cake <span id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_591.md). 2. This, too, that every
night the demons rush from hell <span id="fr_597"></span>[2](#fn_592.md)
into the world, to injure *and* cause the death of the creatures; and,
when *people* consecrate a sacred cake, that spirit descends to attack
and keep back the demons, and to engage in combat with the demons
ninety-nine times during every night; he also smites and stupefies them,
and keeps *them* back from destroying the world.

3\. This, too, that any one whatever of those men who utter these
words <span id="fr_598"></span>[3](#fn_593.md) in prayer becomes righteous,
except those men who shall contentedly, *or* wishfully, carry out a
command for evil deeds, and they deceive (suftênd), or make *others*
deceive, by statements proposed to them; *and* whose evil thoughts are
thus more than *their* good thoughts, their evil words more than *their*
good words, and their evil deeds more than *their* good deeds. 4. About
carrying off the reliance produceable that *a sin* worthy of death is
the obliteration (f*râz* mûshtanŏ) of other sin, like an awful *and*
mighty wind when it sweeps swiftly over the plain <span
id="fr_599"></span>[4](#fn_594.md).

5\. Of righteousness the excellence is perfect.
