<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A></p>  
<p>harm <I>owing</I> to those <I>who are</I> irregular <I>and</I> ill-observant, through being inclined for that irregularity <I>and</I> ill-observance, <I>would</I> become an oppressive presidence (pa<I>d</I>gah&icirc;h) of the demons over the creatures; also the vice of clamorous talking (dr&acirc;y&acirc;n g&ocirc;g&icirc;h)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the damage owing thereto, <I>and</I> the pleasure of the demons due to the same <I>and</I> other <I>things</I> which are irregular. 37. Advice about the reason, habit, <I>and</I> primitive practice of not chattering, and other good customs, during eating <I>and</I> drinking; the gratification of the sacred beings owing to that primitive practice of good customs <I>by</I> mankind, and the unself-devoting (a-khv&ecirc;<I>s</I>-d&acirc;k) is he who is not maintaining <I>it</I>.</p>  
<p>38. Through the ceremonial of which sacred being is the greater welcome (m&acirc;hm&acirc;n&#335;tar&icirc;h) of a high-priest <I>and of</I> any good work <I>of</I> each one of the five periods of the day and night; the reward and advantage owing to celebrating the ceremony of each of them separately in its own period, and also other means <I>and</I> regulations in the same statement.</p>  
<p>39. It is righteousness <I>that is</I> perfect excellence.</p>
