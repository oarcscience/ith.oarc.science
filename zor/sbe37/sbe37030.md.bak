5\. About picketing (ba*r*â ni*s*âstanŏ) a horse, that is, how *it is*

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_238"></span>[90:1](sbe37030.htm#fr_239.md) See Chap. XIX, 3.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[90:2](sbe37030.htm#fr_240.md) Any solid portion
of a corpse, or carcase, of a human being, dog, or other animal.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[90:3](sbe37030.htm#fr_241.md) Which might
extinguish it and, thereby, render the person who had charge of the fire
grievously sinful.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[91:1](sbe37030.htm#fr_242.md) Reading vad-i*k*
vand-1-î 4 lôtŏ-î pânakîh, and taking lôtŏ as equivalent to Pers. latah.
We might suppose that the phrase meant 'a belt of the four strings
(rû*d*ŏ) of protection,' but the number would not correspond to the
three times the sacred thread-girdle passes round the waist, nor would
the material of rû*d*ŏ, 'catgut,' be appropriate for the girdle.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[91:2](sbe37030.htm#fr_243.md) The scriptural
formula to be recited in its original language.
