### XV. NÎKÂ*D*ÛM NASK <span id="fr_1807"></span>[1](#fn_1758.md).

Dk. VIII, Chap. XVIII, 3, refers to the passage which, no doubt,
contained the statement thus quoted

<span id="page_472">p. 472</span>

in Farh. Oîm, pp. 6, 1. 11-7, l. 13:—'Aêdha is the skin of the head, and
there is *part* of it which is large and *part* which is small, as it
says in the Nihâ*d*ûm:—"Kaya he*n*ti masyanghô aêdha, which are those
*parts with* the larger skin? Yô aparaya paiti mastraghnaya, whatever is
behind the skull; (*A*farg <span id="fr_1808"></span>[1](#fn_1759.md) said,
from the ear backwards). Kaya kasyanghô, *which are those with the
smaller?* Yô paouruya paiti mastraghnaya, whatever is before *the
skull* <span id="fr_1809"></span>[2](#fn_1760.md). Vaghdhanem is the head,
*and one* says nar*s* vaghdhanem, &c., this is: Sinful are they *who*
penetrate (sûmbênd) a man's head, astem aêvô mastravanãm, *or* one bone
*of* the skull; vîspa*k*a yô mastraghnãm amãsta, all those *are* to be
smitten who *have* penetrated into the skull, *and* to be given up *as*
outcast <span id="fr_1810"></span>[3](#fn_1761.md);
*hv*arô-*k*ithanãm <span id="fr_1811"></span>[4](#fn_1762.md) aêt*e*ê anyê
*k*ikayatô, the penalties of a Khôr <span
id="fr_1812"></span>[5](#fn_1763.md) *sin* chastise those who *hurt* other
*parts*, (such as the brain which is in the skull of the head, and the
*marrow* of the other members *that are* to be mentioned, just as it
mentions this:—Sinful are they who strike through the bone, or flesh, or
marrow of a leg, and every *one* of those is to be smitten who strikes

<span id="page_473">p. 473</span>

through the bone of one fleshy *part, and* he is to be given up *as*
outcast; *while* the penalties of a Khôr *sin* <span
id="fr_1813"></span>[1](#fn_1764.md) chastise those who *hurt* other
*parts*)."'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XX, 116, probably refers to the passage which contained
the statement thus quoted in Pahl. Vend. IV, 35: 'That is, this is the
account of the number of years, *according to* that which is in the
Hûspârûm as regards the account of the number; and *according to* that
which is in the Nihâ*d*ûm *it is* the account of the number of men.'

Dk. VIII, Chap. XX, 124, possibly refers to the passage which contained
the statement thus quoted in Sls. X, 3:—'In the exposition of the
Nihâ*d*ûm Nask it says that a man is going to commit robbery, *and* a
wall falls in upon him, *it is* his destroyer; when a man strikes at him
*he* is his adversary, *and* both are in sinfulness; when he is going to
perform the ceremonial of the sacred beings both are in innocence
*towards* him.'

No allusion to the following six passages, quoted from this Nask, has
been noticed in Dk. VIII, Chaps. XVI-XX:—

In Sls. X, 22, XII, 15, it is said as in the last fragment of the Spend
N ask, already quoted.

In Sls. X, 23, XII, 16, it is said that 'in the Nihâ*d*ûm the
high-priests *have* taught thus:—"A man gives a hungry *one* bread, *and
it is* too much, yet (*or* when a man gives bread to a man, even though
that man *has* too much bread) all the good works, which he shall
perform through that superabundance,

<span id="page_474">p. 474</span>

become as much his *who gave it* as though they had been done by his own
hand."'

In Pahl. Vend. V, 73, it is said 'like unto this earth and that (sky)
which would also cover over *it* (ever in all *places*; there is *some
one* who says this is as to dead matter, that in the Nihâ*d*ûm *says it
is* as to decision and judgment, and that in the Hûspârûm says it is as
to the ritual of the ceremonial).'

In Vi*g*. p. 136, it is said that '*it is* declared by the Avesta *of
the* Nihâ*d*ûm *thus:*—"Âa*d* ya*d* draonô Vana*n*tô stârô mazdadhâtô
frâyazyâ*d*, *k*athwârô draonô frakere*n*te*n*ti aiwi-*hv*are*n*ti,
ya*d* aêshô nâ yô yao*z*dâthryô:—So when he, who is that man who is a
purifier, shall consecrate the sacred cake of Vanand <span
id="fr_1814"></span>[1](#fn_1765.md), the star produced by Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
they cut up and shall eat up four sacred cakes."'

In Vi*g*. pp. 180, 181, it is said that 'in the Nihâ*d*ûm it is
stated:—Âa*d* aokhta Ahurô Mazd*a*u: "Ya*d* aêtê yô mazdayasna aêtem
srîrem vastrem stehr-paêsanghem hvãm tanûm bâdha paoirîm vanghanem*k*a
hadha varanô paitanem*k*a, pas*k*aiti aiwy*a*unghânô ava hê maidhyânem
bû*g*yamanô." Aêtem zî srîrem vastrem mainyutâ*s*tem ha*k*a mainyavanãm
dâmanãm avi mê fradadhâ*d* Ahurô Mazd*a*u ashava. "Yatha hê varanô
paitanem asti mãnayen hvare-khshaêtahê, adhâ*d* hadha hê vastranãm
yao*z*dâthranãm frâyaza vâ nizbaya vâ Ahurâi Mazdâi ameshanãm
spe*n*tanãm, Spitama Zarathu*s*tra!"—Thus spoke Aûha*r*ma*zd*: "When
*for* him, of those who are Ma*zd*a-worshippers, *there is* this
beneficial, star-spangled (that is, wrought) garment <span
id="fr_1815"></span>[2](#fn_1766.md), always (after seven years *of age*,
that is,

<span id="page_475">p. 475</span>

after seven years *of age*) first he covers up (that is, clothes) his
own body in it, and with (that *he* is properly) a preserver of faith
(that is, a preserver of attachment, and) he afterwards ties <span
id="fr_1816"></span>[1](#fn_1767) (that.md) girdle (over that starry
*garment*) at the waist (as a waist-belt)." That, even this well-looking
garment, spiritually formed by the creatures of the spirits, is really
(that which) the righteous Aûha*r*ma*zd* granted me (who am Zaratû*s*t).
"Since it is his preserver of faith, (that is, preserver of attachment),
he is like (him who is as) the sun, (a preserver of beneficial faith, an
implorer of the splendid heaven, and is *one* who is an accepter *of*
the religion); therefore, with that garment, which is purified (that is,
pure), do thou worship, or practise invocation, as regards Aûha*r*ma*zd*
and as regards the archangels, O Spîtâmân Zaratû*s*t!"'

In Vi*g*. pp. 184, 185, it is said that '*it is* declared by the Avesta
of the Nihâ*d*ûm *thus:*—Âa*d* aêtahê pa*nk*a ayara hamaspathmaidhem
paiti ratûm spe*n*tay*a*u ârmatôi*s* mâunghô nôi*d* frasrâvayôi*d*:—So
*one* does not chant forth (that is, does not invoke) the month of (the
completely mindful) Spenda*r*ma*d* <span
id="fr_1817"></span>[2](#fn_1768) (that is, the Spenda*r*ma*d* month.md) in
the reign of those five Hatnaspa*d*mêdêm days <span
id="fr_1818"></span>[3](#fn_1769.md); (for if *one* invokes *it*, owing to
forgetfulness, the Avesta is not accepted).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1758"></span>[471:1](sbe37143.htm#fr_1807.md) The very long
account of this Nask, in Dk. VIII, contains <span id="page_472">p.
472</span> 4,876 Pahlavi words, from which the extent of its original
text may be estimated (in the same way as in the case of Nask XVII) at
about 62,600 Avesta and 562,900 Pahlavi words.

<span id="fn_1759"></span>[472:1](sbe37143.htm#fr_1808.md) One of the old
commentators whose statements are frequently quoted in the Pahlavi
versions of the Avesta. The reading of his name and the age in which he
lived are alike uncertain, but he appears to have been one of the
earliest commentators whose opinions now survive.

<span id="fn_1760"></span>[472:2](sbe37143.htm#fr_1809.md) Perhaps the
quotation ends at this point; but Dk. VIII, Chap. XVIII, 3, is equally
applicable to what follows.

<span id="fn_1761"></span>[472:3](sbe37143.htm#fr_1810.md) Tanâpûhar, see
Dk. VIII, Chap. XX, 65.

<span id="fn_1762"></span>[472:4](sbe37143.htm#fr_1811.md) So in K20.

<span id="fn_1763"></span>[472:5](sbe37143.htm#fr_1812.md) See Dk. VIII,
Chap. XXXI, 39.

<span id="fn_1764"></span>[473:1](sbe37143.htm#fr_1813.md) MH6 has va-aêvak
kerp after mazg, and both K20 and MH6 have valman ba*r*â yehabûni*s*n;
khôr tô*g*i*s*nîhâ after tan*â*pûhar.

<span id="fn_1765"></span>[474:1](sbe37143.htm#fr_1814.md) The southern
leader of the stars, probably Fomalhaut. (see Bd. II, 7, V, I).

<span id="fn_1766"></span>[474:2](sbe37143.htm#fr_1815.md) The sacred
shirt.

<span id="fn_1767"></span>[475:1](sbe37143.htm#fr_1816.md) This appears to
be the reverse of the meaning of Av. bû*g*yamanô in Yt. I, 17, but see
the first fragment of Nask XIV, quoted in Vi*g*. pp. 160, 161.

<span id="fn_1768"></span>[475:2](sbe37143.htm#fr_1817.md) The last month
of the Parsi year, named after the archangel Spenda*r*ma*d* (see Dk.
VIII, Chap. IX, 3).

<span id="fn_1769"></span>[475:3](sbe37143.htm#fr_1818.md) The five
intercalary days that follow the last month, in order to make the twelve
months, of thirty days each, correspond with a year of 365 days. They
coincide with the Hamaspa*d*mêdêm season-festival, originally intended
to celebrate the vernal equinox.
