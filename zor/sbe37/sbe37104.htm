<p>1. The ninth fargar<I>d</I>, Yath&acirc;i<I>s</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1336"></A><A HREF="#fn_1308"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, is <I>that</I> by him who praises A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> <I>his</I> work in the G&acirc;thic lore&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1337"></A><A HREF="#fn_1309"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is taught; even for this reason, because the reason of the praise even of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> is for <I>his</I> works, <I>and</I> by him who extols any work the performance</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_343"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 343</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of that work is also taught; <I>moreover</I> the work of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, <I>which is</I> the G&acirc;thic lore, is pure goodness. 2. This, too, that by him who increases the propagators of good works priestly-controlled action (ra<I>d</I>&icirc;k-k&ucirc;ni<I>s</I>n&icirc;h)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1338"></A><A HREF="#fn_1310"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is taught; even for this reason, because the advancement of merit and the action of priestly chieftainship are the two maxims (v&acirc;<I>k</I>ak&#335;) of one who, when <I>there</I> is reason, exalts progressive merit when he increases the propagators of good works; and when progressive merit is exalted priestly-controlled action is praised and also taught.</p>  
<p>3. This, too, that what is worthy, <I>and</I> what is coveted for every worthy <I>man</I>, is produced by him for whom the command of the liturgy is the reckoning for him who is habitually sagacious; and this statement also indicates the explanation of rulers <I>and</I> all who are needing those of the world for one combined effort, who, in the immature world, <I>have</I> to trust a command that is <I>at</I> one time sagacious. 4. This, too, that personal assistance is liberally given (r&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;ni<I>d</I>&#335;) to the creatures of the good <I>beings</I> by him whose deeds are an assistance of the renovation <I>of the universe;</I> and this statement, too, also indicates the great power <I>of</I> any good work whatever, because every good work, <I>being</I> an assistance of the renovation, becomes liberality <I>to</I> the immature (kh&acirc;m) creation.</p>  
<p>5. This, too, that whoever teaches to a son reverence unto <I>his</I> father has also appropriated the reward for reverence unto the creator for teaching that person; even for this reason, because express reverence unto parents and service to them are connected</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_344"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with reverence unto the creator and service to him. 6. This, too, that whoever is personally progress for him who is his own&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1339"></A><A HREF="#fn_1311"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#151;that is, for any one whatever among those who are needing him&#151;becomes the happiness of the creator who is the maker of the original good creations; and this statement also indicates as to whom <I>it is</I>, when, through him whose decision is progress&#151;which <I>arises</I> through that which <I>occurs</I> when the decision is given that becomes for every one that which is needful for him&#151;there is happiness that is concentrated. 7. This, too, that by him who is causing benefit for him who is a cultivator cattle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1340"></A><A HREF="#fn_1312"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are multiplied; even for this reason, because a gratifier of the performers of tillage is multiplying tillage, <I>and</I> cattle are the chief tillage of the world.</p>  
<p>8. This, too, that the religion which is the way of righteousness is made his own&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1341"></A><A HREF="#fn_1313"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> by him who is a good thinker about the religion of righteousness; and this statement, too, also indicates the limit of reliance (asti<I>s</I>n&#335;) upon the good religion; because whoever is not a good thinker about the good religion, even though he be a reciter of revelation, becomes really an apostate; whoever is a good thinker, <I>but</I> not about the good religion, becomes really an infidel; and whoever thinks truly becomes a good thinker about religious righteousness and the statements in the good religion. 9. And about three statements, the bringer forward <I>for</I> all mankind is your submission to the sacred beings; one is of the produce (bar), one of the origin (b&ucirc;n), and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A></p>  
<p>one of the body and life; that of the produce is the exertion from which <I>there</I> is produce, that of the origin is the advantage for which the origin is requisite, and that of the body and life is the thought of the proposer (r&acirc;y&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r), which considered both as submission <I>to</I> the sacred beings. 10. This, too, that connected with the sitting-place of the sage is the excessiveness <I>of</I> the pleasure&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1342"></A><A HREF="#fn_1314"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> for those causing pleasure, for the upper classes (<I>a</I><I>v</I>ar&icirc;g&acirc;n&#335;) of Ir&acirc;n, <I>and</I> for the energy (pat&ucirc;k&icirc;h)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1343"></A><A HREF="#fn_1314"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the diligent.</p>  
<p>11. Excellence <I>that is</I> perfect is righteousness.</p>
