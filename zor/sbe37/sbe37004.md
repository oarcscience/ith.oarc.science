# CONTENTS OF THE NASKS.

## DÎNKA*RD*.—BOOK VIII.

### CHAPTER I.

1\. Praise *for* Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and obeisance *to* the
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion which is the ordinance of Aûha*r*ma*zd*
opposed to the demons.

2\. The eighth *book* is the present (latamman) memorandum about a
summary of what is in the Nasks of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion,
each separately. 3. That which is within the compass (shâ*d*-aûrvân) of
this book, about the account of the good religion, is a writing for the
information of the many, *and* an announcement from the commentary
(zand)—that which is in explanation of revelation (dênô)—which, for this
simple (pâ*d*ram) high-priest, is in itself the writing of the voice of
revelation <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md).

4\. But, before that, is a writing <span id="fr_23"></span>[2](#fn_23.md)
*of* the usage about the divisions (ban*g*i*s*nŏ) of the reckoning of
the Ma*zd*a-worshipping revelation, also the parts (bâhar) of its
divisions, and the sections (burînakŏ) of the parts; *and* the
exposition of the account—

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

which, though very condensed, is in its division—is *also* condensed in
the parts of its division, and more diffuse in the sections of the
parts. 5. The divisions of the reckoning of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping
revelation are three:—Gâthas which are the higher spiritual knowledge
*and* spiritual duty; Law which is lower <span
id="fr_24"></span>[1](#fn_24.md) worldly knowledge and worldly duty; and
the Hadha-mãthric which are mostly information and matters about what is
between these two <span id="fr_25"></span>[2](#fn_25.md).

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

6\. And the reason of the triple division of the reckoning of revelation
is the exposition of all knowledge *and* duty, and the kinds of
knowledge and action *in* the same revelation are these three that *have
been* written. 7. Also in the Ahunavair <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md), which

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

is the basis of the reckoning of revelation, are three metrical lines
(gâs); the first chiefly indicates the Gâthic lore, the second the
Hadha-mãthric lore, and the third the Law.

8\. And there have been twenty-one parts <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) of its divisions, which are called
Nasks:—(9) Seven are Gâthic, because they are composed for the Gâthas,

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

and their names <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md) are that of the
ritual of the Gâthic worship, which is the Stô*d*-ya*s*t, *with* the
Sû*d*kar, Var*s*tmânsar, Bakŏ, Va*s*tag, Hâ*d*ôkht, and that which has
made them Gâthic <span id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29.md), the Spend. 10. And
the names of the seven Hadha-mãthric are Dâmdâ*d*, Nâ*d*ar, Pâ*g*ag,
Ra*d*ŏ-dâ*d*-aîtag, Bari*s*, Ka*s*kîsrôbô, *and* Vi*s*tâsp-sâstô. 11.
*And* seven are Legal, because they are composed for the lawyer
(dâ*d*îk), and their names are those of the legal, and those are the
Nîkâ*d*ûm, Ganabâ-sar-ni*g*a*d*, Hûspâram, Sakâ*d*ûm, and Vendîdâ*d*,
and those which are composed for the law with separate dedications, the
*K*itradâ*d* and Bakân-ya*s*t. 12. And the sequence is Sû*d*kar,
Var*s*t-mânsar, Bakŏ, Dâmdâ*d*, Nâ*d*ar, Pâ*g*ag, Ra*d*ŏ-dâ*d*-aîtag,
Bari*s*, Ka*s*kîsrôbô, Vi*s*tâsp-sâstô, Va*s*tag, *K*itradâ*d*, Spend,
Bakân-ya*s*t, Nîkâ*d*ûm, Ganabâ-sar-ni*g*a*d*, Hûspâram, Sakâ*d*ûm,
Vendîdâ*d*, Hâ*d*ôkht, and Stô*d*-ya*s*t <span
id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30.md).

13\. In all three *divisions* all three are *found*; in the Gâthic are
the Hadha-mãthric and Legal, in the Hadha-mãthric are the Gâthic and
Legal, and in the Legal are the Gâthic and Hadha-mãthric.

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

14\. *In* each separately that which is essentially and specially itself
is included, and that which is partly another and introduced is
included; and the reason of it is *that* in spiritual and worldly
*existences*, and in worldly and spiritual *existences*, and in that
which is between the two, *there* are both *existences*.

15\. The occurrence *of* the joining of the Va*s*tag part of the Gâthas
on to the last of the Hadha-mãthric <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md)
is because *it* is written in connection with the Vi*s*tâsp-sâstô, the
last *of* the Hadha-mãthric. 16. The reason of the Hâ*d*ôkht and Ya*s*t
being in succession to the Vendîdâ*d*, the last of the Law <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md), and 'the production of the worldly
creations <span id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33.md)' *being* between the
Hadha-mãthric *and* those spiritual Gâthas, is because the spiritual
*existence* likewise, which is spiritual life (ahvô), is the beginning;
and the worldly *existence* is purposed and caused, and a part is
preserved (nô*s*î-aîtŏ), important for the purpose and intended for the
spiritual life, the part at the beginning. 17. And the rejoining of the
end of the Law, which is *about* the Hôm <span
id="fr_34"></span>[4](#fn_34.md), to the Gâthas, which are the beginning,

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

is a symbol of the existence of the pure influence of the Gâthic lore
upon the first spiritual state—that *which* exists likewise at last—and
of the rejunction of the worldly existence to the spiritual, because it
came down from the spiritual to exist at present.

18\. And the reason of the twenty-one-fold partition of the three
divisions of the reckoning of revelation is in the distinction which is
evident from *their* composition; also in the three metrical lines of
the Ahunavair, which is the basis of the reckoning of revelation, there
are twenty-one words (mârîk). 19. As the three metrical lines of the
Ahunavair, which is the basis of the reckoning of revelation, are an
emblem of the triple division of the reckoning of revelation; so the
twenty-one words of the three *lines* indicate the twenty-one-fold
partition of these three divisions; as *it* is declared that 'He who is
the omniscient creator produced a discourse from every single word.'

20\. *As to* the sections of the parts, such as the Hâs and
Fargar*d*s <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) in the Nasks, *it* is
known *there* were one thousand <span id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36.md),
from the testimony *and* knowledge of the religion owing to the teaching
of Zaratû*s*t—*whose* guardian spirit is reverenced—in the country of
Irân. 21. And after the devastation occurred, owing to the evil-destined
*and* raging villain Alexander, *there* was not so much of them

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

recovered as would be possible for a high-priest to preserve <span
id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md). 22. And that which the saintly
(hûfravar*d*ŏ) Âtû*r*-pâ*d* <span id="fr_38"></span>[2](#fn_38.md), son of
Mâraspend, achieved through their composition and preservation, is known
so far as the decrees (*k*akŏ) in the treatises (mâ*d*îgân) of the
country of Irân are preserved as teaching and admonition (pandânŏ).

23\. After writing of each separate Nask, that is, as to what it speaks
about more particularly <span id="fr_39"></span>[3](#fn_39.md), each Nask
is accounted for separately, and what is in its various Hâs *and*
Fargar*d*s comes to be realized <span id="fr_40"></span>[4](#fn_40.md); for
in these particulars (mâ*d*îgân) any ruggedness of the auspicious <span
id="fr_41"></span>[5](#fn_41.md) *and* desirable collection is explained.
24. But, first, the class of writing of the various Nasks—that is, about
what they speak—is here written; the extent of attainment not being
adapted to *their* peculiarity of wonderfulness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_22"></span>[3:1](sbe37004.htm#fr_22.md) The author means that
he derives his information about the contents of the Nasks entirely from
their Pahlavi versions which, so far as he is concerned, are of equal
authority with the Avesta text.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[3:2](sbe37004.htm#fr_23.md) This introductory
chapter.

<span id="fn_24"></span>[4:1](sbe37004.htm#fr_24.md) Or 'mostly,' if we
read *av*îrtar, instead of *az*îrtar, as is done in the next clause of
this sentence.

<span id="fn_25"></span>[4:2](sbe37004.htm#fr_25.md) The three Pahlavi
terms are gâsânŏ, dâ*d*, and hâ*d*ak-mânsarîk. Of these dâ*d* evidently
means 'law,' because the Dâ*d*îk Nasks are chiefly devoted to legal
matters (see Chaps. XVI-XLIV); and gâsânŏ appears to mean 'gâthas'
rather than 'verses,' because the first Gâsânîk Nask contained the Gâtha
texts (see Chap. XLVI), the next three were commentaries upon the Gâthas
(see Chaps. II-IV and Bk. IX, Chaps. II-LXVIII), and the remaining
three, so far as we are informed, were devoted to religious matters, but
we have no reason to suppose that any of them were metrical, except the
Gâthas themselves. The exact meaning of hâ*d*ak-mânsarîk is less clear;
it is derived from Av. hadha-mãthra, 'provided with spells, or inspired
words,' a term applied to Zaratû*s*t in Vîsp. XIII, 1 and also to the
Mãthra-spe*n*ta, or liturgy, in a phrase (see Westerg. Z. A., p. 485)
which is appointed to be used in certain parts of the liturgy whenever
the Vi*s*tâsp Ya*s*t (a remnant of the last Hadha-mãthric Nask) is
recited; just as another phrase, referring to the Law, is appointed to
be used in the same places whenever the Vendîdâ*d* (one of the Dâ*d*îk
Nasks) is recited. In what sense the Hadha-mãthric Nasks can be said to
be 'provided with spells' is not clear from the details given in Chaps.
V-XI, but, practically, the meaning of the term must be something like
'semi-religious,' being applied to philosophy and science which are
neither strictly religious nor strictly secular.

The same three terms were applied to the three classes of mankind,
probably the priests, philosophers, and laity; a classification
analogous to that of the three professions, the priests, warriors, and
husbandmen, but not quite identical with it, as may be gathered from a
passage in the sixth book of the Dinka*rd* This book is <span
id="page_5">p. 5</span> 'about an epitome, composed *and* preserved by
those of the primitive faith, concerning the statements of the religion
of Ma*zd*a-worship;' and its statements are introduced by the following
words:—'Those of the primitive faith, who *were* the sages of the
ancients, considered thus, &c.' Near the middle of the book the
following passage occurs:—'And this, too, *was* considered by them thus,
that these are the three species of mankind:—One is the Gâthic, one the
Hadha-mãthric, *and* one the Dâ*d*îk. The association (hamîh) of him who
is Gâthic is with the sacred beings, *and his* severance
(v*îg*î-aîtagîh) from the demons *and* fiends; the extent of *his*
wealth is due to members of the community and *religious* feasts (dâhm
va-sûr), and the punishment for the sin which he may commit is shame and
is invisible. The association of him who is Hadha-mãthric is with the
righteous, and his severance from the wicked; also the extent of his
wealth is that which may be produced virtuously, and the punishment for
the sin he shall commit is the goad, or scourge (see Chap. XLIV, 65 n);
also. noxious creatures *for* the body, and compensating the destitute.
And the association of him who is Dâ*d*îk is with Irânians, and his
severance from foreigners; also the extent of his wealth is due to
affairs that it is possible to accomplish lawfully, *and* the punishment
for the sin which he shall commit is *for* the life*time* of a fowl
(kûk), the day of a demon.'

<span id="fn_26"></span>[5:1](sbe37004.htm#fr_26.md) This information seems
to be taken from the first fargar*d* of the Sû*d*kar Nask (see Bk. IX,
Chap. II, 19). The Ahunavair (Av. ahuna vairya) is the name of the most
sacred formula of the Parsis, derived from its second and third words;
it is also called the Yathâ-ahû-vairyô, from its first phrase, and is a
declaratory statement in metre, consisting of one stanza of three lines,
containing twenty-one Avesta words, as follows:—

Yathâ ahû vairyô, athâ ratu*s* ashâ*d*-*k*î*d* ha*k*â,  
Vangh*e*us dazdâ mananghô *sh*yaothananãm angh*e*us mazdâi,  
Khshathrem*k*â ahurâi â, yim drigubyô dada*d* vâstârem.

The usual Pahlavi version of this formula explains it as follows:—<span
id="page_6">p. 6</span> 'As is the will of the spiritual lord (as is the
will of Aûha*r*ma*zd*) so should be the priestly master (so virtuous
should he be) owing to whatsoever are the duties and good works of
righteousness (the duties and good works should be as virtuous as the
will of Aûha*r*ma*zd*). Whose is the gift of good thought (that is, the
reward and recompense that good thought gives, it gives also *unto* him)
which, among spiritual lords, is the work of Aûha*r*ma*zd* (that is, he
would do that which Aûha*r*ma*zd* requires): \[there are *some* who
would say thus: Whose gift is for good thought (that is, the reward and
recompense which they give for good thought, they give also unto him);
*and* there are *some* who would say thus: Whose gift is through good
thought (that is, the reward and recompense which they give up through
good thought, they would also give even him); Âtû*r*pâ*d*, son of
Zaratû*s*t, said thus: Owing to the gift of good thought, among
spiritual lords, they recognise a doer of deeds. The dominion for
Aûha*r*ma*zd* is his (that is, his dominion exists through the advantage
that Aûha*r*ma*zd* has maintained) who gives allotments (vâyagânŏ) to
the poor (that is, he would make intercession for them).'

The Avesta text may be translated, according to Haug, as follows:—'As a
spiritual lord is desirable, so is a priestly master, for the sake of
every righteousness, *to be* a giver of good thoughts as to the actions
of life towards Mazda; and the dominion is for the lord whom he
(*Mazda*) has given as a protector for the poor.'

According to Geldner the first two lines refer to Zaratû*s*t, and, if we
assume that yim is a contraction of yô îm, the Avesta text may be
translated somewhat as follows:—'As *he is* the desirable spiritual
lord, so *is he* the priestly master with every right, the producer of
the actions of the good thoughts of life towards Mazda. The dominion,
however, is for Ahura who has given him as a protector for the poor.'

<span id="fn_27"></span>[6:1](sbe37004.htm#fr_27.md) See §§ 18, 19.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[7:1](sbe37004.htm#fr_28.md) For variants of these
names, in the order stated in § 12, see the notes to the first sections
of Chaps. II-XVI, XXI, XXVIII, XXXVIII, XLIV-XLVI, which begin the
summary description of each of the twenty-one Nasks.

<span id="fn_29"></span>[7:2](sbe37004.htm#fr_29.md) Referring probably to
'the bestowal of the other Nasks' mentioned in Chap. XIV, 5.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[7:3](sbe37004.htm#fr_30.md) This is the order in
which the twenty-one words of the Ahunavair are applied to the
twenty-one Nasks, as hinted in § 19; and, therefore, the order in which
they ought to be enumerated. Representing the three divisions of the
Nasks by G, H, L, respectively, and the seven Nasks in each division by
the ciphers 1-7, the order of enumeration is as follows:—G 2-4; H 1-7;
G5; L6; G7; L 7, 1-5; G 6, 1. More or less fanciful reasons for this
dislocation of the divisions are given in §§ 15-17.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[8:1](sbe37004.htm#fr_31.md) That is, the placing
of G 5 after H 7.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[8:2](sbe37004.htm#fr_32.md) That is, the placing
of G 6, 1 after L 5. The Vendîdâ*d* appears to be the last of the truly
legal Masks, as the contents of the *K*itradâ*d* (see Chap. XIII) appear
to have been chiefly historical, and those of the Bakân-ya*s*t (see
Chap. XV) chiefly religious. These two Nasks are also placed in a
sub-class in § 11.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[8:3](sbe37004.htm#fr_33.md) This
Dahi*s*nŏ-î-sti*h*-dâ*d*ŏ is evidently another name for the Dâmdâ*d*, or
'the creatures produced,' which is placed between G 2-4 and H 2-7.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[8:4](sbe37004.htm#fr_34.md) Written Hîm in Pâzand,
for Hûm; and referring to the white Hôm, mentioned in Pahl. Vend. XX,
17, 21, and its healing properties. It is not absolutely necessary to
understand from the text that the twentieth fargar*d* was literally the
end of the Vendîdâ*d* in Sasanian times, because Chap. XLIV, 81 is quite
as descriptive of the twenty-second as of the twentieth fargar*d*.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[9:1](sbe37004.htm#fr_35.md) The term Hâ (hâ*d*,
Av. hâiti) is applied to the chapters of the Yasna, and the term
Fargar*d* (Av. fra + kereta) to the chapters of the Vendîdâ*d* and most
of the other Masks.

<span id="fn_36"></span>[9:2](sbe37004.htm#fr_36.md) Combining the
information given in the Persian Rivâyats with that in the Dinka*rd* we
find only 905 chapters enumerated, of which 180 are said to have been
lost, from the philosophical Nasks, during the Greek rule.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[10:1](sbe37004.htm#fr_37.md) Probably meaning not
more than a high-priest could retain in his memory.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[10:2](sbe37004.htm#fr_38.md) A supreme high-priest
who was prime minister of king Shahpûhar II (A.D. 309-379).

<span id="fn_39"></span>[10:3](sbe37004.htm#fr_39.md) In this eighth book
of the Dinka*rd*.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[10:4](sbe37004.htm#fr_40.md) In the more detailed
statements in the ninth book.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[10:5](sbe37004.htm#fr_41.md) Reading hû*s*ukûngûn,
but it may be khû*s*kûnînŏ, 'beneficent,' or ana*s*ikôn-gûn,
'unconfusing.'
