### Footnotes

<span id="fn_299"></span>[121:1](sbe37041.htm#fr_300.md) Corresponding to
the eighteenth word, yim, in the Ahunavair, according to E. P. Riv.; but
it is the nineteenth Nask in other Rivâyats. This name, which is here
written like Zakî-hat-min, should probably be Zîk-a*î*t-tûm, meaning
'the most intimate concerns,' as the Nask refers chiefly to personal and
family law; but it is called Askâram, or Sakadâm, in the Rivâyats, which
also state that it contained fifty-two kardah, fargar*d*s, or vê*d*ast;
thus agreeing with the total of the sections mentioned in Chaps.
XXXVIII, XLI.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[121:2](sbe37041.htm#fr_302.md) It is possible to

season corresponding to the middle of the second Parsi month, which was
early in May when the year commenced at the vernal equinox (see Bd. XXV,
6, 21).

appears to refer to that quoted in Farh. Oîm, p. 38, ll. 8, 9; though
the latter part of Chap. XLI, 19 is more applicable to ll. 4-8 of the
same page.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[124:1](sbe37041.htm#fr_307.md) Or *g*âmak may
mean 'a cup.'

<span id="fn_306"></span>[124:2](sbe37041.htm#fr_308.md) Reading min
gûnagîhâ.

n.

ceremonial purification.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[127:1](sbe37041.htm#fr_311.md) For irrigation.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[127:2](sbe37041.htm#fr_312.md) Reading virûnag,
but the word is miswritten nîrang-î.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[128:1](sbe37041.htm#fr_313.md) In the shape of
sluices for regulating the supply of water for irrigation.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[129:1](sbe37041.htm#fr_314.md) Instead of khar
va-khazûrâ, the MS. has khôr va-zak-î ras.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[129:2](sbe37041.htm#fr_315.md) Assuming that
minênamakŏ-1 stands for apênamakŏ-1; <span id="page_130">p. 130</span>
the copyist having mistaken *a*p for *az*, and substituted the Zvâri*s*
equivalent min for the latter which he supposed was a separate word.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[130:1](sbe37041.htm#fr_316.md) Or 'abstracting.'

<span id="fn_315"></span>[130:2](sbe37041.htm#fr_317.md) See Chaps. XVII,
6, XXXVII, II.
