### Footnotes

<span id="fn_274"></span>[107:1](sbe37037.htm#fr_275.md) The Pahl. text is
pavan mamanîh va-ka*d*âmîh-i namî*d*ŏ. Possibly namî*d*ŏ, 'moistened,'
may stand for numû*d*ŏ, 'indicated;' but the whole sentence is more or
less obscure.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[107:2](sbe37037.htm#fr_276.md) Written 4 + 2 (=
six) in the MS., but this is a most unusual way of writing 'six;' it is
more probable that we ought to read 4 + 3, the usual mode of writing
'seven.' 'Seven evil-doers of sin of a heinous kind' are detailed in Dd.
LXXII, 2-9.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[107:3](sbe37037.htm#fr_277.md) Pahl.
bâîô*d*ôk-zê*d*ŏ, see Chap. XIX, 1 n.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[108:1](sbe37037.htm#fr_278.md) Assuming that
gôbar *kh*e*k*îrûntanŏ stands for gôbar (Pers. gôr) *kh*efrûntanŏ.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[108:2](sbe37037.htm#fr_279.md) See Chap. XIX, 3.
