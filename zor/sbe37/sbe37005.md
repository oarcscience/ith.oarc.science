Textual Heritage

### CHAPTER II.

1\. Homage *to* the glory *of* the good religion *of* Ma*zd*a-worship!

2\. The Sû*d*kar <span id="fr_42"></span>[6](#fn_42.md) *contains*
particulars about the

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

power of the pure glorifying of the first utterance of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md), through thinking,
speaking, and acting; and *about* abstaining from the law of very evil
*and* very disturbing people <span id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md). 3.
Glorifying the observances (hûnarânŏ) *and* good works *of* the good
religion *and* of a like nature, as well as their effectualness; and
condemning the faults and sin *of* him *of* very evil religion, when all
kinds of neglect of the spiritual ceremony and *of* care for the
archangel of the worldly existence are owing to him <span
id="fr_45"></span>[3](#fn_45.md); also much information about spiritual
matters. 4. It *has* become old (kahûnîk), and is a witness whose
statement *extends* even unto the renovation *of the* universe <span
id="fr_46"></span>[4](#fn_46.md).

5\. Righteousness is perfect-excellence <span
id="fr_47"></span>[5](#fn_47.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_42"></span>[10:6](sbe37005.htm#fr_42.md) Corresponding to the
first word, yathâ, in the Ahunavair, according to the Persian Rivâyat of
Bahman Pûn*g*yah, which adopts the sequence detailed in Chap. I, 12. All
other Persian Rivâyats and also the Dînî-vi*g*irkard adopt the sequence
G 1-4; H 1-7; <span id="page_11">p. 11</span> G 5, 7; L 6, 7, 1, 3, 2,
4, 5; G 6. Like most of the names of the Nasks, Sû*d*kar is an
adjective, meaning 'causing benefit, or acting beneficially;' it is
corrupted into Stûdgar, or Istûdgar, in the Rivâyats and Dv. For a
detailed account of the contents of each of its twenty-two fargar*d*s
see Bk. IX, Chaps. II-XXIII.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[11:1](sbe37005.htm#fr_43.md) The Ahunavair, or
Yathâ ahû vairyô, which Aûha*r*ma*zd* recited before the creation in
order to confound Aharman (see Bd. I, 21, 22). This clause refers
chiefly to the first fargar*d* of the Sû*d*kar (see Bk. IX, Chap. II).

<span id="fn_44"></span>[11:2](sbe37005.htm#fr_44.md) Referring to Bk. IX,
Chaps. V, IX, X, &c.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[11:3](sbe37005.htm#fr_45.md) See Bk. IX, Chap. IX.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[11:4](sbe37005.htm#fr_46.md) See Bk. IX, Chap.
XXIII, 7.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[11:5](sbe37005.htm#fr_47.md) The text is aharâyîh
*âzâd*îh pâhlûm aîtŏ, the Pahl. equivalent of the Av. ashem vohû
vahi*s*tem astî, 'righteousness is the best good,' the first metrical
line of the Ashem-vohû formula, with which it is usual to conclude forms
of prayer and religious writings. It is here used to conclude the
account of each of the twenty-one Nasks, and twice over at the end of
the last one, so that it occurs twenty-two times in this eighth Book. In
the ninth Book it concludes the account of each fargar*d* of the three
Nasks detailed, and is written twice at the end of the second Nask, and
twice at the end of the Book; so that it occurs in three series of 22,
24, and 24 repetitions, respectively, in the ninth Book. As the formula,
<span id="page_12">p. 12</span> which is thus repeated, consists of four
words, it is capable of 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24 permutations in the order of
its words; and it appears as if the author intended that each of the
four series of repetitions of the formula, contained in the two Books,
should give all these permutations successively; and, with the exception
of a few deviations (chiefly in the first two series, and probably due
to the errors of copyists), he has maintained this fanciful peculiarity
throughout. The English translations of the formula have been varied, so
as to preserve this peculiarity to some extent, but it has not been
found possible to differentiate the whole of the twenty-four
permutations.
