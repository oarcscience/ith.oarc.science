### CHAPTER IV.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The third fargar*d*, YêNhê-hâtãm <span
id="fr_503"></span>[3](#fn_500.md), is about

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

the formation of mankind by slow increase, and, when they live on *for*
fifty <span id="fr_504"></span>[1](#fn_501.md) years, *their* slowly
becoming dust; the coming of death even *to* him who is very pleasantly
living, as regards mankind, at the climax (barînŏ) of his life; and the
happiness of the worldly *existence* is given only to the worthy, on
account of *their* love of righteousness; the rest are passed by <span
id="fr_505"></span>[2](#fn_502.md). 2. And also this, that he who is
produced by the demons, *or* is proceeding to the

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

demons, *or* has committed falsehood, is the opulent person who gives
nothing to a worthy supplicant.

3\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_500"></span>[175:3](sbe37053.htm#fr_503.md) This third formula
is chiefly recited at the end of most of the hâs in the Yasna, and
consists of fifteen Avesta words, as follows:—

YêNhê hâtãm âa*d*, yêsnê paitî, vanghô  
mazd*a*u ahurô vaêthâ, ashâ*d* ha*k*â,  
y*a*unghãm*k*â, tãs*k*â t*a*us*k*â yazamaidê.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This may be
translated as follows:—'Of whatever male of the <span id="page_176">p.
176</span> existences, therefore, Ahuramazda was better cognizant,
through righteousness in worship, and of whatever females, both those
males and those females we reverence.'

The Pahlavi version explains it as follows:—'Whoever of those existing
is thus in worship as regards a good *being* \[that is, shall celebrate
a ceremonial for that good *being* who is Aûha*r*ma*zd* the lord\],
Aûha*r*ma*zd* is aware of *it*, owing to the accompaniment of
righteousness \[*and being* acquainted with the reward and recompense of
whatever are, severally, the duty and good works that any one has
performed, he grants *them*\]. I reverence those of the assembly, males
and females \[the archangels; because the male *of* them are good, and
the female *of* them\].'

The Pahlavi translator evidently read vanghô in the first line of the
text, as printed above, and not in the second, as in the present MSS.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[176:1](sbe37053.htm#fr_504.md) So in K, but B has
'seventy.' The text seems to allude to the beginning of old age, of
which three grades are mentioned in the Avesta (Vend. III, 19, 20): the
hanô, zaururô, and pairi*s*tâkhshudrô. The Pahlavi version defines the
age of each grade, but the ciphers given are corrupted in the MSS.
extant. The Far. Oîm, p. 5, ll. 9, 10, gives fifty years as the age of
the zarmân (Av. zaururô), seventy years as that of the hân (Av. hanô),
and ninety years as that of the pâ*d*îrânŏ-shûsar (Av.
pairi*s*tâkhshudrô); but whether this arrangement of the ages is
compatible with the different order of these epithets in the Avesta is
doubtful, though it shows that old age was considered to begin at the
age of fifty years.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[176:2](sbe37053.htm#fr_505.md) Reading
sa*k*î-aîtŏ according to K, though the word can also be read
se*g*î-aîtŏ, 'are ruined;' in B it can be read gadâîgî-aîtŏ, 'are
impoverished.'
