#### DÎNKA*RD*.—BOOK IV <span id="fr_1658"></span>[2](#fn_1617.md).

1\. Obeisance *to* the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion which is opposed to
the demons *and* is the ordinance of Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

2\. The fourth *book* is matter for instruction from the statements
selected, from the instruction of the good religion, by the saintly
(hû-fravar*d*ŏ) Âtû*r*-farnbag <span id="fr_1659"></span>[1](#fn_1618.md),
son of Farukhŏ-zâ*d* *and* leader of those of the good religion.

3\. From the Selection of Customary Instruction <span
id="fr_1660"></span>[2](#fn_1619.md) there is *this:—Number* one is the
actual original evolution <span id="fr_1661"></span>[3](#fn_1620.md),
resembling only himself *and* not designed (*k*imîk). 4. *Number* two,
the duplication of the first among those akin (khvê*s*îgân) owing to the
consciousness of creation—which is the first—is Vohûman; but *it is* his
origin, concealed from the destroyer, which is the reason of the
creation.

.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

10\. *Number* three is the original creature Ashavahi*s*t <span
id="fr_1662"></span>[4](#fn_1621.md)—due to development among those akin,
one out of another—who possesses the third place among the archangels,
for the reverence of the first.

.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .     .

12\. *Number* four, the perfect sovereignty among

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

those akin, is named Shatraver <span id="fr_1663"></span>[1](#fn_1622.md),
the necessity of the stored-up (a*v*ar-gû*d*ŏ) nature of a spiritual
lord arisen from the reverence of the perfectly just doer Ashavahi*s*t,
who is the third in arising from him who is the second, Vohûman, who is
the first creature.     .     .     .     .       19. So, too, the
sovereignty of the religion is ever specially good sovereignty *and*
triumphant, and the true religion is confident; the will of the sacred
beings in the world is progress, and the comprisal of every knowledge is
in the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion; the correct attainment of its good
sovereignty and their joint statement are together really on account of
their concealed good protection and progressive production, one for the
other. 20. They strive for the powerful maintenance of the religious
good monarchy of rulers, trusty *in* religion through practising
Ma*zd*a-worship; the law of the rulers is custom, and their custom is
religious.

21\. Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_1664"></span>[2](#fn_1623.md), the king when he
became relieved (pardakhtŏ) from the war with Ar’*g*âsp <span
id="fr_1665"></span>[3](#fn_1624.md), sent to the chief rulers about the
acceptance of the religion, 'and the writings <span
id="fr_1666"></span>[4](#fn_1625.md) *of* the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion,
which are studded with all knowledge through resources and learning of
many kinds, and *also* the tongue *of* a Magian man (Magôî-gab*r*â),
arisen *in* the very same instructed duty, it is expedient you *should*
send (*s*ed*r*ûnê*d*ŏ) *there*with.' 22. Now

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Ar*ez*râs*p*ô <span id="fr_1667"></span>[1](#fn_1626.md), *and* others from
outside *of* Khvanîras <span id="fr_1668"></span>[2](#fn_1627.md), came to
Frashô*s*tar for religious enquiry, with complete intelligence *for* the
most who did *so*.

23\. Dârâî <span id="fr_1669"></span>[3](#fn_1628.md), son of Dârâî,
ordered the preservation of two written copies of the whole Avesta *and*
Zand, according to the receiving *of it by* Zaratû*s*t from
Aûha*r*ma*zd*; one in the treasury of Shapîgân <span
id="fr_1670"></span>[4](#fn_1629.md), *and* one in the fortress of written
*documents*.

24\. Valkha*s* <span id="fr_1671"></span>[5](#fn_1630.md), descendant of
A*s*kân, in *each* district, just as he had come forth, ordered the
careful preservation, *and* making of memoranda for the royal city
(shat*r*ô shahag), of the Avesta *and* Zand as it had purely come unto
*them, and* also of whatever instruction (âmûkŏ-*k*), due to it, had
remained written about, as well as deliverable by the tongue through a
high-priest, in a scattered state in the country of Irân, owing to the
ravages and devastation of Alexander and the cavalry and infantry of the
Arûmans <span id="fr_1672"></span>[6](#fn_1631.md).

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

25\. That (valman-1-î) A*r*takhshatar <span
id="fr_1673"></span>[1](#fn_1632.md), king of kings, who *was* son of
Pâpak, summoned Tôsar, *and* also all that scattered instruction
(âmûkŏ), as true authority, to the capital; Tôsar *having* arrived, him
alone he approved, and, dismissing the rest of the high-priests, he also
gave this command, namely: 'For us every other exposition of the
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion becomes removed, because even now there is
no information *or* knowledge of it below.'

26\. Shahpûhar <span id="fr_1674"></span>[2](#fn_1633.md), king of kings
*and* son of A*r*takhshatar, again brought together also the writings
which *were* distinct from religion, about the investigation of medicine
and astronomy, time, place, *and* quality, creation (dahi*s*nŏ),
existence, *and* destruction (vinâsi*s*nŏ), the submission of a wild
beast <span id="fr_1675"></span>[3](#fn_1634.md), evidence, and other
records and resources *that* were scattered among the Hindûs, *and in*
Arûm <span id="fr_1676"></span>[4](#fn_1635.md) and other lands; and he
ordered *their* collocation again with the Avesta, *and* the
presentation of a correct copy of each to the treasury of Shapîgân <span
id="fr_1677"></span>[5](#fn_1636); and the settlement (astînî*d*anŏ.md) of
all the erring upon the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, for proper
consideration, was effected.

27\. Shahpûhar <span id="fr_1678"></span>[6](#fn_1637.md), king of kings
*and* son of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, instituted a tribunal (*âv*ân âhankŏ
ka*rd*ŏ) for the controversy of the inhabitants of all regions,

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

and brought all statements to proper consideration and investigation;
*and* after the preservation of Âtû*r*pâ*d* <span
id="fr_1679"></span>[1](#fn_1638.md), through the statement which he
maintained (pasâkhtŏ) with all those *of* different sects, and the Nasks
were enumerated, he also spoke this even *to* those who *were*
heterodox, namely: 'Now, when the religion is recognised by us in the
worldly *existence*, we do most diligently endeavour *that* they shall
not allow the infidelity (agdênôîh) of any one whatever;' and he acted
accordingly.

28\. This (le-denman-1-î <span id="fr_1680"></span>[2](#fn_1639).md)
Khûsrôî <span id="fr_1681"></span>[3](#fn_1640.md), king of kings *who is*
son of Kavâ*d*, as apostasy and tyranny *were* fully antagonistically
smitten by him <span id="fr_1682"></span>[4](#fn_1641.md), and information
and redoubled proper consideration *were* abundantly augmented—through a
declaration from the religion unto every apostasy of the four classes
(pî*s*akŏ)—also spoke even this as to winning the sacred beings
(ya*zd*ân kharî*d*îh), namely: ‘The truth of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping
religion is fully understood, *and* the intelligent *are* steadfastly
capable through proper consideration; but recognition by the worldly
*existence has* mostly become exceedingly scattered, *and* the
particulars are not possible through proper consideration, but through
purity *of* thought,

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

word, and deed, and the statements of the good spirit, the liturgical
ceremonial of the sacred beings with purity.

29\. ‘We also call, each of those called by us, a priest of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, whose perception of the spiritual *existence* is
manifested unto us; and our wide resources, the perception of the
spiritual *existence and* the example of the worldly *one*, are likewise
indications *of* both natures *that are* complete. 30. And we invite
(bavîhûnêm) those invited <span id="fr_1683"></span>[1](#fn_1642.md), even
with that excellence *and* efficiency which are due to them, on account
of which the sacred beings are predominantly over Irân; the country of
Irân *having* proceeded onwards through instruction from the
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion which the ancients celebrated. 31. The
knowledge *of* the sociable ceremonial (ham-ya*z*i*s*nîh)—for which,
indeed, those of the intelligent of disunited Khvanîras are not in a
dispute of antagonism—is, *in* that way, mostly the sonorous (aêv*âz*îk)
Avesta, in the pure statement of the writing adornable by memoranda of
particulars; and even the simple wordless (av*âk*îk) mode is maintained
in the announcement of the statement.

32\. ‘Even then all the domestic (khânîk) knowledge of the
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion is really on this account, which is
understood by us, that, when all are intellectual (vîr-hômônd), and the
proper consideration of a stranger (bîgânakŏ) is owing to the world of
the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, they arrive at this place. 33. *But*
through the new possession and proper consideration *of* the stranger,
owing to the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, they are

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

not capable of bringing about so much acquirement *and* manifestation of
knowledge, for the advantage and open duty of the worldly existence, as
is in the recitation of a priestly master through much investigation,
and is abundantly well-considered. 34. And. if we command, with the
utmost solicitude, the proper consideration of the Avesta and Zand of
the primitive Magian statements (Magôî-gobi*s*nŏ), which are more humbly
observant, better disposed, good, *and* ever renewed uneffacedly, *as
well as* an increase of acquirement worthily therefrom, for the
knowledge of those *of* the world, *there is* no necessity of first
acquiring the quality of creation from the creator, *by* those who are
worldly *existences*, for understanding the creator and the
marvellousness *of* the spiritual *existences;* or all necessity of
acquiring is said *to be* longing through scanty knowledge.

35\. ‘They who are a counterpart (aê*d*ûnŏîh) of manifestation from the
religion—and even through the resemblance *there* is a possibility of
the existence of understanding—*are* mentioned as effecting proper
consideration (hû-sikâl-gar); and he who *has* to exhibit enlightenment
(rôshanô) through knowledge, *has* to maintain acquaintance *with* the
religion. 36. And since the origin of every knowledge is the religion,
alike through spiritual power, and alike through worldly
manifestation <span id="fr_1684"></span>[1](#fn_1643.md), that which any
one *has* wisely spoken—even though not considered by him *as* similarly
beheld (ham-dî*d*ŏ) by any Avesta declaration—is still then accounted as
a manifestation from the religion, whose business is

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

bringing forth offspring for the sacred beings through instruction.’

37 <span id="fr_1685"></span>[1](#fn_1644.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1617"></span>[410:2](sbe37124.htm#fr_1658.md) This book
commences with an account of the seven archangels, and, illustrative of
the 'desirable dominion' personified in Shatraver, the fourth of them, a
statement is made of the legendary history of the efforts made by the
good rulers, from Vi*s*tâsp to Khûsrôî Anôsharavân, for the preservation
of Avesta and Pahlavi <span id="page_411">p. 411</span> literature. Most
of this statement has been already translated at the end of Haug's Essay
on Pahlavi, from a less perfect MS. than B, but, as some of the
accompanying text is obscure, it has now been necessary to translate the
whole of it to ascertain its connection clearly, although only so much
of this translation is here given as will indicate this connection in a
general way.

<span id="fn_1618"></span>[411:1](sbe37124.htm#fr_1659.md) Who held a
religious disputation with the accursed Abâli*s* in the presence of the
Khalîfah Al-Mâmûn (A.D. 813-833), as stated in the Mâ*d*îgân-î
Gu*g*astak Abâli*s*. He appears to have been the first compiler of the
Dinka*rd*, especially of its first two Books which are still
undiscovered (see Dk. III, Chap. last, 9, in Introduction; Sg, IV, 107,
IX, 3, X, 55). Dk. IV, V are taken from his statements, as well as a
portion of Dk. III, Chap. CXLII.

<span id="fn_1619"></span>[411:2](sbe37124.htm#fr_1660.md) Âyûînŏ âmûkŏ
vi*g*înŏ, evidently the name of a treatise compiled by Âtû*r*-farnbag.

<span id="fn_1620"></span>[411:3](sbe37124.htm#fr_1661.md) That is,
Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

<span id="fn_1621"></span>[411:4](sbe37124.htm#fr_1662.md) See Dk. VIII,
Chap. XXXVII, 14.

<span id="fn_1622"></span>[412:1](sbe37124.htm#fr_1663.md) See Dk. IX,
Chap. XLIII, 1.

<span id="fn_1623"></span>[412:2](sbe37124.htm#fr_1664.md) See Dk. VIII,
Chaps. XI, 1, XIII, 15.

<span id="fn_1624"></span>[412:3](sbe37124.htm#fr_1665.md) Ibid. XI, 4.

<span id="fn_1625"></span>[412:4](sbe37124.htm#fr_1666.md) Haug's MS. omits
this passage: va*l* sar-khû*d*âyân madam pa*d*îrôftanŏ-î dênô firîstakŏ,
va-nipîkîhâ-î; and, even when it is supplied from B, a few more words
appear to be still wanting.

<span id="fn_1626"></span>[413:1](sbe37124.htm#fr_1667.md) Evidently the
same person as Arezrâs*p*âh (Dk. IX, Chap. XXI, 24), the supreme
high-priest of the northern region Vîda*d*afsh (Bd. XXIX, 1). In Dk. VII
it is also stated that S*p*îtôî*s* and Are*z*râs*p*ô came to
Frashô*s*tar, seeking information about the religion, 57 years after it
had been received by Zaratû*s*t who appears to have departed to the best
existence ten years before.

<span id="fn_1627"></span>[413:2](sbe37124.htm#fr_1668.md) See Dk. VIII,
Chap. VIII, 2.

<span id="fn_1628"></span>[413:3](sbe37124.htm#fr_1669.md) According to Bd.
XXXIV, 8 and the Persian Rivâyats, which teach a chronology of their
own, this Dârâî was the predecessor of Alexander and reigned fourteen
years; his father reigning twelve years.

<span id="fn_1629"></span>[413:4](sbe37124.htm#fr_1670.md) It is hazardous
to read 'the royal (shâyagân) treasury' because the name, which occurs
seven times in the Dinka*rd*, is five times spelt Shapîgân, and twice
Shas*p*îgân.

<span id="fn_1630"></span>[413:5](sbe37124.htm#fr_1671.md) Probably
Vologeses I, who was a contemporary of Nero and appears to have been a
Ma*zd*a-worshipper (see S.B.E., vol. iv, p. xxxiv).

<span id="fn_1631"></span>[413:6](sbe37124.htm#fr_1672.md) The older Greeks
were so called by the Persians in Sasanian <span id="page_414">p.
414</span> times, because they came from the same quarter as the later
armies of the eastern empire of the Romans.

<span id="fn_1632"></span>[414:1](sbe37124.htm#fr_1673.md) The first
Sasanian king, who reigned A.D. 226-240.

<span id="fn_1633"></span>[414:2](sbe37124.htm#fr_1674.md) The second
Sasanian king, who reigned A.D. 240-271.

<span id="fn_1634"></span>[414:3](sbe37124.htm#fr_1675.md) Doubtful; but it
is difficult to find a more probable meaning for da*d*akŏ hêrîh.

<span id="fn_1635"></span>[414:4](sbe37124.htm#fr_1676.md) The eastern
empire of the Romans.

<span id="fn_1636"></span>[414:5](sbe37124.htm#fr_1677.md) See § 23.

<span id="fn_1637"></span>[414:6](sbe37124.htm#fr_1678.md) The ninth
Sasanian king, who reigned A.D. 309-379.

<span id="fn_1638"></span>[415:1](sbe37124.htm#fr_1679.md) See Dk. VIII,
Chap. I, 22.

<span id="fn_1639"></span>[415:2](sbe37124.htm#fr_1680.md) Literally 'this
one who is,' which, applied to a person near at hand, is a phrase
analogous to valman-1-î, 'that one who is,' applied in § 25 to a person
more remote. The oblique case le-denman of the demonstrative pronoun,
which occurs very rarely, is analogous to the oblique cases li, lanman,
lak, lekûm of the personal pronouns, which occur constantly.

<span id="fn_1640"></span>[415:3](sbe37124.htm#fr_1681.md) The twentieth
Sasanian king, who reigned A.D. 531-579; he was surnamed Anôsharavân,
'immortal-soulled.'

<span id="fn_1641"></span>[415:4](sbe37124.htm#fr_1682.md) Referring to his
extirpation of the heresy of Mazdak, A.D. 528, before he came to the
throne.

<span id="fn_1642"></span>[416:1](sbe37124.htm#fr_1683.md) As in Yas. II.

<span id="fn_1643"></span>[417:1](sbe37124.htm#fr_1684.md) Assuming that
pê*d*âkîh-înî*d*ârîh stands for pê*d*âkînî*d*ârîh.

<span id="fn_1644"></span>[418:1](sbe37124.htm#fr_1685.md) Then follows a
briefer account of the remaining three archangels.
