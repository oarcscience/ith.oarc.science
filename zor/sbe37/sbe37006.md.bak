### CHAPTER III.

1\. The Var*s*tmânsar <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) *contains*
particulars about the birth of Zaratû*s*t, his attaining the
religion <span id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49.md), *and* whatever is on the
same subject <span id="fr_50"></span>[3](#fn_50). 2. A notice (numâ*d*.md)
of the priestliness, discipleship, spiritual lordship, priestly
authority, and steadfastness which are in his original more concise
words of the Gâthas <span id="fr_51"></span>[4](#fn_51.md). 3. The
explanation (zand) of the statements about everything and also the good
arrangement (khu*s*ra*d*akŏ) are such as that which *one* speaks of
thus:—'*It* is the Var*s*tmânsar which has given forth an exposition
upon every*thing*.' 4. So that, in the Var*s*tmânsar, something is said
about every*thing* that is mentioned in the Gâthas.

5\. Of righteousness the excellence is perfect.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[12:1](sbe37006.htm#fr_48.md) Corresponding to the
second word, ahû, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P. Riv.; but it is
the third Nask in other Rivâyats. Var*s*tmânsar means 'used as spells,
or employed as liturgy,' and is often corrupted into Vahi*s*t-mânthrah
in the Rivâyats. For a detailed account of the contents of each of its
twenty-three fargar*d*s see Bk. IX, Chaps. XXIV-XLVI.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[12:2](sbe37006.htm#fr_49.md) See Bk. IX, Chap.
XXIV.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[12:3](sbe37006.htm#fr_50.md) This final phrase is
often used for unspecified details, and may be considered as equivalent
to *et caetera*.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[12:4](sbe37006.htm#fr_51.md) See Bk. IX, Chap.
XXV.
