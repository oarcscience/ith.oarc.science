a*hv*yâ*k*â *hv*aêtu*s*; it is here written khvatamaîtŏ in Pahlavi in
both MSS.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[181:5](sbe37058.htm#fr_520.md) Compare Yas.
XXXII, 3.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[182:1](sbe37058.htm#fr_521.md) Av. Andra, or
I*n*dra; one of the arch-demons produced by the evil spirit, and the
special opponent of the archangel Ashavahi*s*t; he seduces from virtue
and opposes the use of the sacred shirt and girdle (see Bd. I, 27,
XXVIII, 8, 10, XXX, 29; Ep. I, x, 9; Pahl. Yas. XLVII, 1).

<span id="fn_518"></span>[182:2](sbe37058.htm#fr_522.md) Av. Sauru; another
of the arch-demons and the special opponent of the archangel Shatvaîrô;
he encourages anarchy and drunkenness, and opposes the use of the sacred
shirt and girdle (see Bd. I, 27, XXVIII, 9, 10, XXX, 29; Ep. I, X, 9).

<span id="fn_519"></span>[182:3](sbe37058.htm#fr_523.md) Probably
equivalent to 'walking in stockings,' though some think it means
'walking barefoot.' It is sinful on account of the risk of pollution
from stepping on impurities.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[182:4](sbe37058.htm#fr_524.md) Av. Tauru and
Zairi*k*a; two more of the arch-demons and the special opponents of the
archangels Khû*r*da*d* and Amû*r*da*d*; they produce and diffuse poison,
and are propitiated by walking with one boot (see Bd. I, 27, XXVIII, 11,

21, 22, and Bk. VIII, Chap. XVIII, 2.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[182:7](sbe37058.htm#fr_527.md) B omits 'eats.'
Talking during eating is sinful because the eater has muttered an inward
prayer, as a protective spell, the good effect of which would be
destroyed by speaking aloud (compare Bk. VIII, Chap. XLIII, 37).

<span id="fn_524"></span>[183:1](sbe37058.htm#fr_528.md) K has
'protection.'

<span id="fn_525"></span>[183:2](sbe37058.htm#fr_529.md) That is, its
muttering the Ashem-vohû formula which is recited thrice, as a
conclusion of the inward prayer (see Dd. LXXIX, 1 n).

<span id="fn_526"></span>[183:3](sbe37058.htm#fr_530.md) Or it may be 'he,'
as the optative 3rd plural is often used for the singular; but it is a
doctrine of the religion that a person who causes good works to be done
by others, as he does when he employs a priest to perform ceremonies, is
as much the owner of the good works as the actual performer is (see Sls.
X, 22, 23 for cases of less direct agency).

<span id="fn_527"></span>[183:4](sbe37058.htm#fr_531.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chaps. IX, 3, XLIV, 16, and Pahl. Yas. I, 22.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[183:5](sbe37058.htm#fr_532.md) As an offering,
referring to the verb nivaêdhayêmi, 'I announce or invite,' with which
most of the clauses of Yas. I. commence.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[183:6](sbe37058.htm#fr_533.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. XX, 153, and Pahl. Yas. I, 23.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[183:7](sbe37058.htm#fr_534.md) Av. Ar*s*tâ*d*,
'rectitude,' a female angel who assists the soul on its way to the other
world (see AV. V, 3).

<span id="fn_531"></span>[183:8](sbe37058.htm#fr_535.md) The period from

*hv*âstrem, Pahl. râmi*s*nŏ khvârôm, who cooperates with Mit*r*ô (see
Pahl. Yas. I, 9).

<span id="fn_534"></span>[184:1](sbe37058.htm#fr_538.md) The period from
dawn till noon, and in winter it extends into the afternoon (see Bd.
XXV, 9-14).

<span id="fn_535"></span>[184:2](sbe37058.htm#fr_539.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. XXXVII, 14, and Pahl. Yas. I, 12.

3 p*m*. during summer (see Bd. XXV, 9-14). Here written Rapis*v*ag.

ahurahê nafedhrô apãm, Pahl. bûr’*z*and khû*d*âî nekedân-î *âv*ânŏ nâpô
(see Pahl. Yas. I, 15).

<span id="fn_538"></span>[184:5](sbe37058.htm#fr_542.md) The evening from
the middle of the afternoon till dusk (see Bd. XXV, 9; Sls. XXI, 4-7).

18, 19.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[184:7](sbe37058.htm#fr_544.md) The period from
dusk till midnight; here written ay*îv*îk-srûksrîm. It will be noticed
that the periods for the ceremonials of the beings here detailed
correspond with those with which their names are connected in Yas. I,
3-7, II, 3-7, III, 5-9, IV, 8-12, VI, 2-6, VII, 5-9 (W.).
