### CHAPTER XVI.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The fifteenth fargar*d*, Kamnamaêza <span
id="fr_610"></span>[4](#fn_605.md), is

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

about the arrival of Ast-vîdâ*d* <span id="fr_611"></span>[1](#fn_606.md)
upon the spot, and the insecurity of any one from him; also the
non-continuance of the mortal body and decaying (farsâvand) wealth of
any one of the mortals summoned is death <span
id="fr_612"></span>[2](#fn_607.md). 2. And this, too, that Ast-vîdâ*d*
shall carry off all mortals by that awful and proclaimed marvel, and
they are not saved from him <span id="fr_613"></span>[3](#fn_608.md); each
one, indeed, saves only *that* which is the soul. 3. This, too, that the
soul alone sees the reward and bridge <span
id="fr_614"></span>[4](#fn_609.md) of the spiritual *existence*, and
embodied it does not see such *things;* if, *when* embodied, it could
have seen like that, then it would not have committed the sin really
originating with it, even for anything whatever *of* the ease and
comfort of the worldly existence, nor shrunk (mansî*d*ŏ) from the first
good work.

4\. About the hideousness and frightfulness of the body of man after
death, and only that which is considered by every one the most precious
of desirable things is undecaying (*a*farsâk). 5. As regards the casting
away of the dust, and also living people, that which is more nearly
connected therewith is

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

uninhabitableness <span id="fr_615"></span>[1](#fn_610.md) and its
duration. 6. And when, too, this way, the consciousness is in the
vicinity of the body <span id="fr_616"></span>[2](#fn_611.md), and the dog
and bird go forth for the dismemberment of the body, the frightening of
the consciousness by them is like *that of* a sheep by a wolf; also
*its* disputing with the dog and bird about the dismemberment of the
body, the reciting (mâr*d*anŏ) of words spiritually *at* first repelling
them, thinking the body is alive. 7. And, afterwards, when the body is
dismembered by them, the hastening of the consciousness to the vicinity
of the dismembered body, just like a female (dênû*d*akŏ) sheep when it
hastens on to *its* young ones; *and its* noticing—with grievous
unhappiness <span id="fr_617"></span>[3](#fn_612.md) for the body—and
recounting where the features (dêmagânŏ) of that body were in happiness,
and to what misery it has now come. 8. And, when that body became sinful
in *its* lifetime, about its not accepting, during that lifetime, that
which the consciousness repeatedly well-endeavoured to promote for that
body, as regards abstaining from sin and practising good works.

9\. This, too, that thy time of worldly happiness *has* occurred, and
that of misery is long. 10. This, too, that the people who live on, in
the worldly *existence*, a hundred years are less than those who do not
live a hundred years; the progress of a lifetime, little *by* little,
and the rushing on of a lifetime; wife and property and the rest *of*
worldly *things* all

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

leaving you at once, and coming to another person. 11. And this, too,
that—when mankind mostly keep up any statement (nisang-i*k*) *or*
register (aêvar’*g*-ŏ) which they have drawn out (na*z*î-hênd) <span
id="fr_618"></span>[1](#fn_613.md) about ordainable supplies in a friendly
*or* inimical (patyân-mônd) way, which is more particularly expedient
for them—a supply, suitable for the discreet, of the rest of that which
is constantly desirable, is to be extracted therefrom, and *one* is to
keep up its preparation with his own.

12\. About the seven immortal rulers who are produced in the region of
Khvanîras <span id="fr_619"></span>[2](#fn_614.md), and also about the
ordaining of their glory and the goodness, too, of *their* assistants
living *and* privileged in both existences. 13. The tree opposed to
harm <span id="fr_620"></span>[3](#fn_615.md) is on Aîrân-v*êg* <span
id="fr_621"></span>[4](#fn_616.md), in the place of most excavations
(frêhnigânân gâs). 14. Gôk-patŏ <span id="fr_622"></span>[5](#fn_617.md) is
in foreign <span id="fr_623"></span>[6](#fn_618.md) countries.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 15.
Pêhshôtanû <span id="fr_624"></span>[1](#fn_619.md), *son* of Vi*s*tâsp, is
in Kangd*ez* <span id="fr_625"></span>[2](#fn_620.md) the hundred-moated
(sa*d*-gandak), wherein *there are* a myriad spears (drafsh), those of
the exalted who wear black marten *fur*, who are righteous listeners of
the religion <span id="fr_626"></span>[3](#fn_621.md), out of the retinue
(akha*rî*h) of Pêhshôtanû, *son* of Vi*s*tâsp. 16. Frâ*d*akhshtŏ, son of
the mortal Khûmbîks <span id="fr_627"></span>[4](#fn_622.md), who is
predominant on the waters flowing in channels. 17. Ashavâzd, son of
Pôrû*d*akhshtŏ <span id="fr_628"></span>[5](#fn_623.md), who is predominant
over the most manifest among uplands, the plain of Pê*s*inâs <span
id="fr_629"></span>[6](#fn_624.md). 18. Barâzak <span
id="fr_630"></span>[7](#fn_625.md) the causer of strife. 19. 'And the
eighth Kayân <span id="fr_631"></span>[8](#fn_626.md) who *was* renowned,
*O* Vi*s*tâsp! it is

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

he whom one calls Kai-Khûsrôî, who produces even an advance of thy
religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, and also understands about it; who
gives my good practices further blessings, so that the world <span
id="fr_632"></span>[1](#fn_627.md) maintains my doings with benedictions.'

20\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_605"></span>[199:4](sbe37065.htm#fr_610.md) The appellation of
the fourth, and last, hâ of the second <span id="page_200">p. 200</span>
Gâtha (Yas. XLVI), which begins with the words kâm nemôi zãm; it is here
written kamnam*êz*ŏ in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[200:1](sbe37065.htm#fr_611.md) See Chap. XII, 17.
The connection of the demon of death with Yas. XLVI is that the first
few words of that ha are supposed to be repeated by the wicked soul in
despair after death (see Yt. XXII, 20, W.; Mkh. II, 159; AV. XVII, 7).

<span id="fn_607"></span>[200:2](sbe37065.htm#fr_612.md) K has mar*d*ûm,
'human (?).'

<span id="fn_608"></span>[200:3](sbe37065.htm#fr_613.md) B has the whole of
this first clause thus:—'And the unconsumed (*a*pakhshînŏ) property of
him who is surprised by the invisible marvel that he shall endure, they
have not saved from him.' This marvel is probably the supposed casting
of a noose by Ast-vîdâ*d*, around the neck of the dead to drag him to
hell, which only the righteous are able to cast off.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[200:4](sbe37065.htm#fr_614.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chaps. XIV, 8, XXIV, 10.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[201:1](sbe37065.htm#fr_615.md) Corpses are to be
deposited in an uninhabited place (see Vend. VI, 44-51, VII, 45-50; Dd.
XVIII).

<span id="fn_611"></span>[201:2](sbe37065.htm#fr_616.md) Compare Dd. XVI,
7.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[201:3](sbe37065.htm#fr_617.md) Pahl. ashâ*d*îh in
K, but B has aya*d*akîh, 'remembrance.'

<span id="fn_613"></span>[202:1](sbe37065.htm#fr_618.md) Or 'they offer up
(û*z*dahênd).'

<span id="fn_614"></span>[202:2](sbe37065.htm#fr_619.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. VIII, 2. And, regarding these seven rulers, compare Bd. XXIX, 5,
6; Dd. XC.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[202:3](sbe37065.htm#fr_620.md) The many-seeded
tree in the wide-formed ocean, whence the seeds of all wild plants are
brought by the rain (see Yt. XII, 17; Bd. XXVII, 2, 3; Mkh. LXII,
37-42).

<span id="fn_616"></span>[202:4](sbe37065.htm#fr_621.md) See Chap. XII, 3.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[202:5](sbe37065.htm#fr_622.md) Gôpatshah in Bd.
XXIX, 5, XXXI, 20, 22; Byt. II, 1; Dd. XC, 3, 4; Gôpaîtôshah in Mkh.
LXII, 8, 31; and Gôpaîtŏ in Mkh. XLIV, 35. All these forms of the name
imply that he was a king, or master, of oxen; and Mkh. describes him as
a Ma*zd*a-worshipping minotaur on the sea-shore, probably the Caspian,
or the river Oxus, as Bd. makes him a brother, or nephew, of Frâsîy*âv*
the Turânian. His country is called S*a*ukavastân in Bd., and Gôpatŏ in
Dd.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[202:6](sbe37065.htm#fr_623.md) Pahl. an-Aîrân
which corresponds with the position of S*a*ukavastân being between
Tûrkistân and *K*înistân, as stated in Bd. XXIX, 13, and that of Gôpatŏ
being coterminous with Aîrân-vê*g*, as in Dd. XC, 4. But K, by omitting
the negative prefix, places it <span id="page_203">p. 203</span> 'within
the countries of Irân;' and Mkh. makes Gôpaîtŏ a chief of Aîrân-v*êg*.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[203:1](sbe37065.htm#fr_624.md) Av. Peshôtanu,
commonly written Pêshyôtanû in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[203:2](sbe37065.htm#fr_625.md) A fortified
settlement, to the east of Irân (see Bd. XXIX, 10), formed by Sîyâvakhsh
(see Bk. VIII, Chap. XIII, 14) who was first cousin of Vi*s*tâsp's
great-grandfather (see Bd. XXXI, 25, 28, 29).

<span id="fn_621"></span>[203:3](sbe37065.htm#fr_626.md) Who are expected
to be led into Irân by Pêhshôtanû in future times, when he is summoned
by the angels to restore religion to the world after the conflict of the
nations (see Byt. III, 25-42).

<span id="fn_622"></span>[203:4](sbe37065.htm#fr_627.md) K has
'Frâ*d*akhshtŏ, son of Khûmbîk the son of Hôshâng.' He was evidently the
Fradhâkh*s*ti Khuñbya of Yt. XIII, 138, who might have been considered
as a descendant of the Haoshyangha mentioned before him in Yt. XIII.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[203:5](sbe37065.htm#fr_628.md) Av. Ashavazdangh
Pourudhâkh*s*tayana of Yt. V, 72, XIII, 112.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[203:6](sbe37065.htm#fr_629.md) Said to be in
Kâvulistân where Sâma Keresâspa lies asleep till summoned to kill Dahâk
in the latter times (see Bd. XXIX, 7, 11; Byt. III, 59-62). It may be
connected with the vairi Pisanangh of Yt. V, 37, where Keresâspa offered
sacrifice, and with the Pi*s*în valley south-east of Qandahâr; but Chap.
XXI, 20 seems to place it between Mâzendarân and Irân, and Mkh. LXII, 20
also describes it as near Mount Dimâvand. Its name is variously written
Pê*s*inâ*s*, Pe*s*ânsih, Pê*s*yânsaî, Pê*s*ândas, Pê*s*ânîgas, &c.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[203:7](sbe37065.htm#fr_630.md) Possibly Av.
Varâza of Yt. XIII, 101.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[203:8](sbe37065.htm#fr_631.md) Kavi Haosravangh
(Kaî-Khûsrôî) is the eighth and last in the list of Kavis, or Kayâns, in
Yt. XIII, 132; and was celebrated for <span id="page_204">p. 204</span>
his opposition to idolatry (see Yt. V, 49, 50; Bd. XVII, 7). This
section appears to be an actual quotation from the Pahlavi version of
the Nask, professing to give the words of Zaratû*s*t.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[204:1](sbe37065.htm#fr_632.md) K has dêhîk, 'a
provincial.'
