### CHAPTER XIV.

1\. The Spend <span id="fr_119"></span>[2](#fn_118.md) *contains*
particulars about the origin *and* combination *of* the material
*existence*, guardian spirit, *and* soul (nisman) of Zaratû*s*t; how the
creation of each one *occurred* in the spiritual *existence*, and *in*
what mode *it was* produced for the worldly *existence*; how *their*
connection with the parents *arose*, the coming of the parents together,
the combination in the mother, and the birth from the mother; *and*
whatever is on the same subject. 2. Also about the arrival of both
spirits, the good *one* for developing, and the evil *one* for
destroying; the victory *of* the good spirit, and the rearing of
Zaratû*s*t.

3\. His attainment on maturity, at thirty years *of age*, to a
conference *with* Aûha*r*ma*zd*; and the

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

occurrence of seven conferences in ten years. 4. Many marvels, owing to
him, are published therein, just as there are *some* which, collected
*and* selected, are noticed by the Dinka*rd* manuscript <span
id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_119.md).

5\. *In* seven sections (burînŏ), such as are called Spend, are the
seven enquiries, *in* each instance a single enquiry; *and* the bestowal
of the other Nasks, in these seven enquiries, *was* through speaking out
in each one *of* the places of conference. 6. About the various
enquiries, the period of the sitting *and* rising *on* each occasion,
the nature of the sitting of the archangels, the coming forward of
Zaratû*s*t to that domestic conclave (handêmânîh), his position *in*
that place, what *there was* to say to him, *and* what *there was* to
exhibit to him.

7\. The conferring of the wisdom of omniscience upon Zaratû*s*t, and
*what was* seen *by* Zaratû*s*t *of* the past *and* future, and the
perpetual amount of duration therein, through that wisdom <span
id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_120.md). 8. The existence of that wisdom, *and*
what that is which, after *having* subsisted in it, is again well
recognised; such as, owing to it, are the highest *and* best of places,
heaven and the various grades of position *and* reward *of* the
righteous, according to their worthiness through the practice of good
works; the most downward and worst of places, hell and the place *of*
punishment *of* the wicked, according to their sin; and, between the
two, the place of the ever-stationary, those having equal good works
*and*

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

sin; the *K*înva*d* bridge <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_121.md), at
which is the account as to good works *and* sin; and the future
existence, in which is the consummation of every one, righteous and
wicked, and the preservation of all good creations from every evil
occurs.

9\. Information also *as to* many other things which are marvellous, and
*as to* a summary of the statements of these seven enquiries, which is
*derived* from knowledge of every kind. 10. Likewise, about the
communication of Zaratû*s*t's knowledge of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping
religion to the world, his attracting mankind to the religion, *and* the
ages, after Zaratû*s*t, until the renovation *of the universe*. 11.
*And* about the nature of the advancement of the people of the period,
the separation *of* centuries and millenniums, *and* the signs, wonders,
and perplexity which are manifested in the world at the end of each
millennium in the world.

12\. Also as to the birth *and* arrival of Aûshê*d*ar <span
id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_122.md), son of Zaratû*s*t, at the end of the
first millennium <span id="fr_124"></span>[3](#fn_123.md), and a report of
him and his time, *and of* the many destroyers of the organizers of the
period between Zaratû*s*t's millennium and the coming of
Aûshê*d*ar <span id="fr_125"></span>[4](#fn_124.md).

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 13. The arrival of
Aûshê*d*ar-mâh <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_125.md), son of Zaratû*s*t,
at the end of the second millennium; information *about* him and his
time, *and* the destroyers *of* the organizers who *were* within the
millennium *of* Aûshê*d*ar. 14. The coming and arrival of Sôshâns <span
id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_126.md), son of Zaratû*s*t, at the end of the
third millennium, the destroyers *of* the organizers who *were* within
the millennium of Aûshê*d*ar-mâh, the arrival of Sôshâns, *and*

*of the universe* and the future existence, *it* is declared *that* they
arise in his time.

16\. Perfect *is* the excellence *of* righteousness.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_118"></span>[31:2](sbe37017.htm#fr_119.md) Corresponding to
the thirteenth word, angh*e*us, in the Ahunavair, according to B. P.
Riv.; and it is the thirteenth Nask in all Rivâyats. Spend means
'beneficent, or bounteous,' and is written Sfend, or Spentah, in the
Rivâyats, which also state that it contained sixty kardah, or
subdivisions.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[32:1](sbe37017.htm#fr_120.md) In its seventh book
which contains a full account of the birth and much of the life of
Zaratû*s*t, with a narrative of future events, all derived, no doubt,
from the Spend Nask. Particulars connected with his birth will also be
found in Bk. IX, Chap. XXIV.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[32:2](sbe37017.htm#fr_121.md) See Byt. II, 5-9.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[33:1](sbe37017.htm#fr_122.md) Av. *k*invatô
peretu*s*, the route to the other world (see Bk. IX, Chap. XX, 3).

<span id="fn_122"></span>[33:2](sbe37017.htm#fr_123.md) Commonly written
Hûshê*d*ar, but [it](errata.htm#1.md) is a corruption of Av.
Ukhshya*d*-ereta. He is the first of the three posthumous sons of
Zaratû*s*t, who were expected to restore his religion and make it
triumphant by three successive efforts, each preceded by a period of
anarchy (see Bd. XXXII, 8, Byt. III 13, 43-50).

<span id="fn_123"></span>[33:3](sbe37017.htm#fr_124.md) The millennium of
Zaratû*s*t, which, according to the chronology of the Bundahi*s*, must
have ended during the period A.D. 593-635 (see Byt. III, 11 n).

<span id="fn_124"></span>[33:4](sbe37017.htm#fr_125.md) The occurrence of
such an interval between the first millennium and the coming of
Aûshê*d*ar seems inconsistent with the previous <span id="page_34">p.
34</span> statement as to his arrival at the end of that millennium,
but, from Byt. III, 44, it appears probable that he was expected to come
in the 600th year of the next millennium (A.D. 1193-1235).

<span id="fn_125"></span>[34:1](sbe37017.htm#fr_126.md) Commonly written
Hûshê*d*ar-mâh, but it is a corruption of Av. Ukhshya*d*-nemangh. He is
the second of the expected posthumous sons (see Byt. III, 52, 53).

<span id="fn_126"></span>[34:2](sbe37017.htm#fr_127.md) Av. Saoshyãs; the
last of the posthumous sons, who is expected to complete the triumph of
the religion, and prepare for the renovation of the universe (see Bd.
XXX, 4, 7, 25, 27, Byt. III, 62).
