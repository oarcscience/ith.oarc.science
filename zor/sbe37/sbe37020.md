### CHAPTER XVII.

*Nîkâ*d*ûm Nask*.

1\. The second section is the Zatamistân ('*assault code*'), particulars
about assault (zatam) and the annoyances (vêshîgânŏ) from assault, such
as pain, blood, and unconsciousness; *also* the sin <span
id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_139.md) that a man may commit in a state of
unconsciousness. 2. About the seven kinds of symptoms of
unconsciousness, and separate decisions about assaults that adults may
commit among those who are children; also as regards an assault which
proceeds to pain *and* blood, and as regards that *in* which the
duration of the disposition of wrath abates the pain *and* blood.

3\. About begging (khvahî*s*nŏ) *and* beneficence (hû-dahî*s*nŏ) <span
id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_140.md), such as those of which one says in
particular *there* are four species: when stinginess (pû*s*îh) benefits
pride (pîkŏ), when pride benefits stinginess, when stinginess benefits
stinginess, and when pride benefits pride; and *there* are three other
species that originate from these *last* two, in consultation together,
when stinginess and pride benefit stinginess and pride, when stinginess
and pride benefit stinginess, and when stinginess and pride benefit
pride, *all* which, *together*, constitute the seven primary species;
many others, too, are traced back to these. 4. Also about seeing the
depravity (khang

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

dî*d*anŏ) of a perverting member of the community (kastâr dâhm) and of
the perverter of a member of the community, and whatever is on the same
subject.

5\. About a weapon seizable, and a weapon one brings, there is this,
namely, what is the thing which is imperfect (anas*p*ôrîk) as a weapon,
what is that which is not, and what is that which is welcome as a
weapon; what is that which, when any one forces it back at any one as a
weapon, is itself something annoying to him; what is his natural
annoyance and what his imparted; and the penalty in property and
difference of sentence on a man who is carrying a weapon, due to any
weapon he has to carry away.

6\. About the six modes of engaging in conflict: through assault, tumult
(khva*s*i*s*nŏ) <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_141.md), false teaching
(mîtôk-sâstô) <span id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_142.md), giving no food
(atapdâ*d*ŏ) <span id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_143.md), speaking with
wizard's spells <span id="fr_145"></span>[4](#fn_144.md), and speaking with
threats of danger <span id="fr_146"></span>[5](#fn_145.md); and, where
there is an engaging

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

in conflict, it then occurs when *one has* stood up for beginning *it*
and the assault is committed, *on* one by the other, *and* not before.
7. And this, too, that engaging in conflict occurs *as regards* adult
with adult, childless women with childless women, pregnant women with
pregnant women, and children of seven years with children of seven
years—*but*, as regards children of seven years in sight of *their*
fathers, it becomes an engaging in conflict of the fathers—and the
decision about it is this, that the atonement for every sin which may be
committed through engaging in conflict goes to the priestly authorities.

8\. About the affliction *of* a pure lord who sees any one *who* has
been useless (abûn) unto *his* slave, though the slave is beseeching,
and does not contend for *his* ownership. 9. About sin *affecting*
accusers <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_146.md) not being atoned for by
any other good work, except unto the accuser himself; *also* about the
slaying of a servant together with *his* lord, *and* whatever is on the
same subject.

To. About slaying *by* untaught children of seven years, *or* even of
eight years in sight of *their* fathers; *and* the criminality of the
fathers therein, when *it* is possible for them to hinder *it and* they
do not hinder *it*, and when *it* is not possible for them to hinder
*it*.
