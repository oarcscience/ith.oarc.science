### CHAPTER LII.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The sixth fargar*d*, A*d*-tâ-vakhshyâ <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[3](#fn_1251.md), is this, that by him who is a wise
upholder of the dignity

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

of a priest's leadership, the priestly assembly <span
id="fr_1272"></span>[1](#fn_1252.md) wanted for performing religious rites
(dênô) is enlarged; for this reason, because the nature of the person,
whose resources are bounty for the needy, eagerly becomes a causer of
exertion for the teaching (âmûkŏ) of accomplishments. 2. This, too, that
by him whose habits are virtuous the glorification of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_1273"></span>[2](#fn_1253.md) is accomplished
and taught; even on this account, for the sake of whatever advantage
*and* pleasure are due to virtue, they, indeed, whose habits are
virtuous, glorify him, moreover, who is the creator of those virtuous
habits, who is Aûha*r*ma*zd* himself. 3. This, too, that by him who
speaks virtuous words the performance even of the worship of
Vohûman <span id="fr_1274"></span>[2](#fn_1253.md) is also taught; even on
this account, because of the comeliness and desirableness of virtue, the
good make it an example and speak virtuous words, *and* virtuous
speaking is the worship of Vohûman. 4. This, too, that the ceremonial
which he whose way is virtuous shall accomplish becomes greater <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[3](#fn_1254.md) thereby; even for this reason, because
the sacred beings come more particularly to the ceremonial of those of
pure dispositions *and* virtuous ways, and accept *it*.

5\. This, too, that he who is a producer of benefit for promoters of
good works becomes an extender <span id="fr_1276"></span>[4](#fn_1255.md)
of the teaching of religion; even for this reason, because from
producing benefit for promoters of good works *arises* an increase of
good works, from an increase of good works *arises* further progress of
the will of the sacred beings, from further progress of the will of the
sacred beings *arises* more progress

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

of the good religion, *and* from more progress *of* the good religion
arises an extension of the teaching of the good religion in the world.
6. This, too, that by him who possesses authority through virtue,
discrimination <span id="fr_1277"></span>[1](#fn_1256.md) as to the
regulation of duties is taught to mankind; even for this reason, because
the possessor of authority through virtue is a man who becomes a decider
*and* ruler, *and* mankind learn and practise to exercise the
disposition, habits, and custom of rulers.

7\. This, too, that *he* who is a giver of the needful *to* his own
needy ones has given himself to Zaratû*s*t; even for this reason,
because the needful *being* given *to* one's own needy ones is the
existence of true liberality, which is a compendium of the religion of
Zaratû*s*t; by him who is thereby ennobled (vâs*p*ûharakânî-aîtŏ) the
religion of Zaratû*s*t is then put on, and whoever *has* put on the
religion of Zaratû*s*t \[has given himself to Zaratû*s*t. 8. This, too,
that by him who\] <span id="fr_1278"></span>[2](#fn_1257.md) gives the
leadership \[to him who is suitable for the leadership\] <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[2](#fn_1257.md) even the wisdom *of* that man is
increased; for this reason, because even the wisdom of the suitable,
through which they accomplish that leadership, when the leadership comes
to them, grows further with the glory of that duty.

9\. This, too, that he who *has* to select the better of two ways, which
are good and bad <span id="fr_1280"></span>[3](#fn_1258.md), is assisted

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

to do *so* by the benefiters’ ordeal of fire and ore; even for this
reason, because that is discrimination by the eye of wisdom, which is
the way of good intention, *and* the benefiters are decisive declarers
of acquittal and incrimination through fire and metal, the two good
discriminators; and when the business *is of* a different kind, even
then both *are* associates in discriminating, and are powerful
connections of one another. 10. This, too, that he who shall do that
thing from *which* advantage of the sacred beings *arises*, is empowered
to discriminate truly that which is sagacious <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[1](#fn_1259.md) in thought, word, *and* deed; even for
this reason, because from doing anything for the advantage of the sacred
beings *arises* the reign of the will of the sacred beings in the world,
from the reign of the will of the sacred beings in the world *arises*
the freedom from danger *of* the temporal existence of the world, *and*
the freedom from danger of the temporal existence of the world
contributes also to the power of him who is sagacious in discriminating
truly as to thought, word, *and* deed.

11\. This, too, that by him who thinks of the affairs of Aûha*r*ma*zd*
the eternity (hamâyîkîh) *of* Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1282"></span>[2](#fn_1260.md) and also the consideration of his own
eternity *by* Aûha*r*ma*zd* are thought of; even on this account,
because mankind mind and serve Aûha*r*ma*zd* for the sake of even the
hope <span id="fr_1283"></span>[2](#fn_1260.md) of eternal benefit from
him; *and* they who think of him, through the eternal benefit due to
him, are themselves increasing that benefit which is eternal, and it is
thought eternal by him that thinks of that eternal *thing* his own
eternity. 12. This, too, that

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

*he* who restrains a person from reverence of the demons, has diverted
him from making the world sickly; even for this reason, because whoever
*has* restrained a person from reverence of the demons, has diverted a
demon from making the world anarchical *and* from making the world
sickly. 13. This, too, that by him who shall practise liberality benefit
for the sun is caused, and by him who shall cause benefit for the sun
benefit is caused also for the nature of the body of mankind; even for
this reason, because *it is* declared *that* the sun *has* progressed
through the radiance and glory of the liberal, and the nature of the
body of mankind is preserved by the sun.

14\. This, too, that by him whose desire is for anything virtuous, and
who possesses authority through virtue, mankind are controlled to
persist (mânînî*d*anŏ) in virtue for receiving a reward <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[1](#fn_1261.md); even for this reason, because *he*
whose desire is virtuous seeks happiness for every one—a pre-eminent
desire for the happiness of human existence *being* the desire of
mankind for virtue—and by him who requires that, *and* strives for *it*
fully, so far as possible for him, any one whatever is brought to
persist in virtue and to constrain the spirit for reward; and by him who
possesses authority through virtue the continuance of mankind in
authority *and their* persistence *and* instruction in virtue are
attached to good works and are brought to reward. 15. This, too, that by
him who possesses happiness through appropriation of the sacred beings
mankind are attached to the sacred beings for receiving a reward <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[2](#fn_1262.md); even for this reason, because, on
account of the possession of

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

happiness through appropriation of the sacred beings, he possesses *it*
through the assistance and gratification of the good, and mankind shall
therefore make him an example; it also becomes a good work for them,
*and* they adhere to the sacred beings for receiving a reward.

16\. This, too, that by him who produces the benediction *of* him that
is a conductor of investigation *and* a righteous judge, and who shall
also occasion the reverence of the good, the teaching of the advantage
of the righteous <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1](#fn_1263.md) is likewise
performed; even for this reason, because the essentials (mâ*d*îgân) of
the advantage of the world are two—one owing to justice, *and* one owing
to generosity—and it is declared *that* the advantage of *him* who
possesses the blessings of the judges is owing to the justice of the
judges, and the advantage of *him* who is reverent *to* the good is
owing to the generosity of the good in developing the world, and the
righteous teach about *it*.

17\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

evidently omitted a passage, but whether the repairer has made the
insertion merely by guessing from the context (which is quite possible),
or by referring to some other MS., is uncertain.
