### CHAPTER LXIV.

*Bakŏ Nask*.

1\. The eighteenth fargar*d*, A*d*-mâ-yavâ <span
id="fr_1476"></span>[2](#fn_1443.md), is that, through his complete
mindfulness <span id="fr_1477"></span>[3](#fn_1444.md), the teaching of
mankind in virtue is by him, and they become properly intelligent <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[3](#fn_1444.md) through him, whose actions are those
which are more daughterly, that is, as reverent unto Aûha*r*ma*zd* as a
daughter unto a father; even for this reason, because his display of the
complete mindfulness which is instinctive (âsnîk) is through action,
*and* that action, acquired (srûtîk) for the thoughts of mankind, is
kindled by him and *has* become properly intelligent. 2. This, too, that
proper intelligence of things arises for *one* completely mindful <span
id="fr_1479"></span>[3](#fn_1444.md), even for a daughter to a father,
through that complete mindfulness which is instinctive, whereby that
lust is excluded which is most violently reverenced by the male
(kû*s*nŏ), and, devoid of that, the reverence is assimilated
(ângunîhînî*d*ŏ) most strongly to one's reverence unto the creator.

3\. This, too, that discrimination of the affairs of the sacred beings
through wisdom <span id="fr_1480"></span>[4](#fn_1445.md) is taught by him

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

whose learning is in the affairs *of* the sacred beings; even for this
reason, because discrimination of the affairs of the sacred beings is
specially that which is advantageous *in* the end, and the
advantageousness *in* the end is seen through learning; *and*, apart
from that, he who is learned in the affairs of the sacred beings has
taught discrimination of the affairs of the sacred beings through his
wisdom <span id="fr_1481"></span>[1](#fn_1446.md).

4\. This, too, that the joyfulness in righteousness is taught to
Frashô*s*tar by him—that is, he would make him ardent in the performance
of duty and good works <span id="fr_1482"></span>[2](#fn_1447.md)—who *has*
thoroughly expounded Khû*r*da*d* *and* Amû*r*da*d* to Frashô*s*tar <span
id="fr_1483"></span>[3](#fn_1448.md), that is, he maintains *him* as his
high-priest. 5. This, too, that he who shall perform good works ever
afresh, has taught him to become ardent in duty and good works <span
id="fr_1484"></span>[2](#fn_1447.md). 6. This, too, that Aûha*r*ma*zd*
supplies guardianship <span id="fr_1485"></span>[4](#fn_1449.md) to him who
gives pleasure to Aûha*r*ma*zd*; even for this reason, because a giver
of pleasure to Aûha*r*ma*zd* is any one *who is* a true servant of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *and* Aûha*r*ma*zd* becomes the guardian of a true
servant.

7\. This, too, that they ever amount to a master of all commands <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[5](#fn_1450.md) for him who is a benefit *and*
sovereignty for that which arises; even owing to this reason, because,
in establishing *and* arranging that which is an absurd (As kiln) or a
virtuous law, the command issued, which is another *and* further
observation of the advantage of the creatures, prepares

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

that which is ever an attainable benefit among the creatures, by means
of which, even after symptoms of the life of one's body, it is governed
through setting going the usage of that law, and is connected *with* his
mastery of command and *his* sovereignty. 8. This, too, that Vohûman's
*having* guarded the creature-forming (dâmîh) of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1487"></span>[1](#fn_1451.md) is taught *by him* whose rule is for
Aûha*r*ma*zd*; on this account, because he whose rule is for
Aûha*r*ma*zd* has taught the inclination for (pa*d*îsâî) *being*
guarded, on this account, because the inclination of the creatures of
that ruler for *being* guarded by the power of goodness, *and* the
creatures being guarded by the power of goodness have published the
power of goodness, which is Vohûman, to the multitude.

9\. Here is about the reply to Zaratû*s*t concerning the wicked, thus:
'Upon arrival in the fiend's abode <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[2](#fn_1452), through an immature (khâm.md) death,
they are unprivileged, so that every misery is theirs, and *it* is not
possible for them to seek a remedy.'

10\. This, too, that the spirit of reverence comes through invocation to
the assistance <span id="fr_1489"></span>[3](#fn_1453.md) of him who is
reverent unto the benefiters; even for this reason, because the spirits
respond more particularly to that invoker who becomes their worshipper
preponderantly (vâs*p*ûharakânîhâ); and for each one of the spirits
there is preponderantly a *form of* worship, as the spirit of liberality
is more particularly worshipped through helpfulness
(vi*g*î*d*âr-dahi*s*nîh), the spirit of truth through exact truth
(hû-râstîh), the spirit of a promise through true promising
(hû-mit*r*ôîh),

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

and the spirit of sovereignty through good sovereignty; and, even so,
the worship of the spirit of reverence consists preponderantly in
reverence unto the benefiters. 11. This, too, that he whose rule is for
Aûha*r*ma*zd* becomes a supplicant *for* that which is coveted (î*s*tŏ)
*from* Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_1490"></span>[1](#fn_1454.md); even for
this reason, because *what* is wisely begged from the sacred beings
*and* rulers, for rendering one's own self worthy, occurs as a benefit
owing to the sacred beings *and* rulers.

12\. About the reply of Aûha*r*ma*zd* to Zaratû*s*t, when asked by him
about his own, *his* confederate <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[2](#fn_1455.md), and *his* serf, thus: 'He is thine
own, he *thy* confederate, and he *thy* serf, even when *and* where *he
is* a righteous offspring who produces the progress of this thy religion
of Ma*zd*a-worship, *and* recites *it* openly even unto *him* he knows,
who provides the public benedictions, this good practice of thine, that
is, he maintains *what is* provided *by* thee as benedictions <span
id="fr_1492"></span>[3](#fn_1456.md).'

13\. Perfect is the excellence *of* righteousness.
