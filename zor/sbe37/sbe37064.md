### CHAPTER XV.

*Sû*d*kar Nask*.

1\. The fourteenth fargar*d*, A*d*-fravakhshyâ <span
id="fr_600"></span>[5](#fn_595), is

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

about Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s showing to Zaratû*s*t the terrible condition of
the soul of Keresâsp <span id="fr_601"></span>[1](#fn_596); the dismay
of Zaratû*s*t owing to that terrible condition; the sorrowful speaking
of Keresâsp as regards the slaying of multitudes, for which mankind
extol him, whereby abstentions from sin *occurred*; and the recognition
of him by the creator, Aûha*r*ma*zd*, as smiting his fire. 2. The
supplication of Keresâsp *for* the best existence from. Aûha*r*ma*zd*
for those exploits when the serpent Srôbar <span
id="fr_602"></span>[2](#fn_597) *was* slain by him, and the violence of
that adversary; when Gandarep <span id="fr_603"></span>[3](#fn_598) with
the golden heels *was* smitten by him, *and* the marvellousness of that
fiend; when the Ve*s*kŏ progeny <span id="fr_604"></span>[4](#fn_599)
who *were descendants* of Nîvîk *and* Dâ*s*tânîk *were* slain by him,
and the grievous harm and disaster owing to them; and when the mighty
wind <span id="fr_605"></span>[5](#fn_600) *was* appeased by him, *and*
brought back from damaging the world to benefiting the creatures; *and*
for that which *happens* when owing to confinement <span
id="fr_606"></span>[6](#fn_601), Dahâk becomes eager, rushes on for the

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

destruction of the world, and attempts (girâyê*d*ŏ) the annihilation of
the creatures; *when* he (*Keres*âsp) is roused to smite him, and to
tame that powerful fiend for the world and creatures.

3\. The enmity of fire to Keresâsp, through the distress which he
occasioned to it, and the keeping of him away <span
id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_602) \[from heaven;. also the friendship of
Gô*s*-aûrvan <span id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_603) for him, through the
prosperity which he occasioned to it, and the protection of him\] from
hell. 4. The petition of Zaratû*s*t to the fire to have compassion upon
what *was* owing to *Keresâsp's* sin; the compliance (han*g*âftanŏ) of
the fire *with* that petition, and the departure of the soul of Keresâsp
to the ever-stationary existence <span id="fr_609"></span>[3](#fn_604).

5\. Of righteousness perfect is the excellence.

Ve*s*kŏ, the Av. hunavô Vaêskaya of Yt. V, 54, 57, who were enemies of
the warrior Tusa; but the hunavô of Nivika and of the Dâ*s*tayâni were
slain by Keresâspa (see Yt. XIX, 41). It is also possible to read
