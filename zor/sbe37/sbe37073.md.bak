### CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. Of the Var*s*tmânsar <span id="fr_740"></span>[1](#fn_735.md) there are
twenty-three fargar*d*s, *and* the first is the Aêthrapaiti*s* <span
id="fr_741"></span>[2](#fn_736.md), on the asking of Zaratû*s*t, by
Maî*d*ôk-mâh <span id="fr_742"></span>[3](#fn_737.md), about the nature of
the birth of Zaratû*s*t, and his coming to the religion. 2. And the
reply of Zaratû*s*t about the combative coming together of the
life-causing and death-causing spirits at his birth <span
id="fr_743"></span>[4](#fn_738.md). 3. This, too, that when the
fellow-villagers <span id="fr_744"></span>[5](#fn_739.md) of her who bore
*him* saw his head <span id="fr_745"></span>[6](#fn_740.md)

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

*they* considered *it* the shoulder *of* <span
id="fr_746"></span>[1](#fn_741.md) Arekdvîksûr <span
id="fr_747"></span>[2](#fn_742.md), *and his* chest and back *those of*
Aharî*s*vang <span id="fr_748"></span>[3](#fn_743.md), *and* when *they
saw* his full <span id="fr_749"></span>[4](#fn_744.md) bosom *they
considered it that of* the spirit of liberality <span
id="fr_750"></span>[5](#fn_745.md); and by *his* side *was* the Kayân
glory <span id="fr_751"></span>[6](#fn_746) to rub (mû*s*tanŏ.md) his
bosom.

4\. The speaking of Zaratû*s*t spiritually, on the grievous bringing
forth of *his* head <span id="fr_752"></span>[7](#fn_747.md), thus: 'As a
spiritual lord is *my* desire, do thou who art the Zôti speak forth to
me <span id="fr_753"></span>[8](#fn_748.md);' and the reply from
Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: 'So shouldst thou be the priestly master as regards
whatever righteousness I speak forth with righteous intelligence; thou
art of very much value, thou *art* very righteous, thou *art* most
intelligent, and thou *wilt* state the religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers to creatures of every kind.' 5. Through that saying
an arrow reaches spiritually unto the demons, just as from a mighty
chief warrior of Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_754"></span>[9](#fn_749.md),
like him in a mountain dwelling (garânŏ mân) who *has* shot an arrow for
an attack (patkopi*s*nŏ) opposing those in coats of mail. 6. The evil
spirit grumbled (dandî*d*ŏ) to the demons thus: 'Evil *has* it become
*for* you *who* are demons, but

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

you are unobservant.' 7. Even so Zaratû*s*t proclaimed life *free* from
the control of the demons, when this same *saying was* uttered by him,
thus: 'As a spiritual lord is *my* desire;' and, *at* the falling of the
demons upon Zaratû*s*t for *his* destruction, an incarnation (tanû) of
*its* spiritual existence stood opposed to them, in that weapon
*proceeding* from Zaratû*s*t, to keep them back.

8\. And he spoke again thus: 'The religion of the benefiters progresses
there in him who, through good actions, *has* joyfulness owing to his
righteousness <span id="fr_755"></span>[1](#fn_750.md);' and, through that
saying, an arrow reaches spiritually unto the demons, equal to ten *of*
that which *was* first spoken, and, *at* the falling of the demons upon
Zaratû*s*t for *his* destruction, it stood spiritually opposed to them,
and that weapon *proceeding* from Zaratû*s*t kept *them* back.

9\. The third utterance of Zaratû*s*t, on the bringing forth of *his*
arms, *was* thus: 'That which the first existence produced is to be so
practised, with attention, through actions to be concealed *by* him who
is a priestly authority (ra*d*ŏ) <span id="fr_756"></span>[2](#fn_751.md);'
and through that saying an arrow reaches spiritually unto the demons,
equal to one hundred *of* that which *was* first spoken, and, *at* the
falling of a demon upon Zaratû*s*t for *his* death, *its* spirit, *as* a
sacred being, kept the demon away from Zaratû*s*t.

10\. And, when the whole body of Zaratû*s*t *was* brought forth, trouble
(âsipŏ) fell among the demons, and the demons rushed back to hell in
haste; light

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

increased among the creatures, and every creature of the beneficent
sacred being is pleased and talked of virtuous conduct. 11. And
Aûha*r*ma*zd* took away Zaratû*s*t with joyfulness to provide security
for *him*, and Arekdvîksûr, Aharî*s*vang, and the primitive and Kayân
glory *in* the body of Zaratû*s*t spoke to Zaratû*s*t of *its*
production *by* Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: 'Thou shouldst think of him who is
wise.' 12. Thereupon Zaratû*s*t spoke spiritually, *in* reply, thus: 'I
am a Ma*zd*a-worshipper, I profess the Ma*zd*a-worship of
Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_757"></span>[1](#fn_752.md); *and* this *means*
that I am an apostle of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and am sent *by* Aûha*r*ma*zd*.'

13\. And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke to Zaratû*s*t thus: '*As to* the sacred
beings *of* the worldly *existence*, do thou beg companionship from
them; *but as to* the demons, do thou long for (dôsh) <span
id="fr_758"></span>[2](#fn_753.md) separation from every one of them;
practise good thoughts, good words, and good deeds, and abstain from
evil thoughts, evil words, and evil deeds.' 14. Also about vigilantly
reverencing the sacred beings, and the reward thereof; not strengthening
the vile, nor weakening <span id="fr_759"></span>[3](#fn_754.md) the good;
expounding *for* the disturber of religion (dênô-pa*d*rêsh), and
producing liberality for the accepters of religion; and not turning
*away* from the religion on account of fondness for body and life.

15\. The accepting of such advice spiritually *by* Zaratû*s*t, and his
glorifying Aûha*r*ma*zd*, for creativeness,

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

sovereignty, and all goodness, and the primary archangels *and* other
good creations, each separately, for their own special glory <span
id="fr_760"></span>[1](#fn_755.md). 16. And, afterwards, the grumbling of
the evil spirit maliciously, at that vexation, thus: 'I have produced,
for the annoyance <span id="fr_761"></span>[2](#fn_756.md) of *any*
upholder of that religion of thine, 99,999 wizards, 99,999
wolf-worshippers <span id="fr_762"></span>[3](#fn_757.md), and 99,999
apostates.'

17\. Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke to Zaratû*s*t thus: 'Maintain this religion
steadfastly, for through the assistance of this religion I, who am
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *will* be with thee, and the omniscient wisdom becomes
thine, and extends to thy disciples, Maî*d*ôk-mâh <span
id="fr_763"></span>[4](#fn_758.md), Parsha*d*-gâvô <span
id="fr_764"></span>[5](#fn_759.md), *S*ênô <span
id="fr_765"></span>[6](#fn_760.md), Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp, Frashô*s*tar, and
*G*âmâsp <span id="fr_766"></span>[7](#fn_761.md), the teacher of public
observance and will to the righteous, *besides* many of the people who
are diligent and even those who are idle, and their good works and
praise *will* be owned by thee.' 18. Likewise

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

about the worldly display of the religion to Zaratû*s*t *by*
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the accepting of the religion *by* Zaratû*s*t through
recitation and faith, and the reverence of the Ahunavair <span
id="fr_767"></span>[1](#fn_762.md) *by* Zaratû*s*t.

19\. Also about Aûha*r*ma*zd* *having* created the creatures in the
spiritual *existence, and* their allotment out to the worldly
*existence*, the superiority of the righteous man as compared with other
creatures, and, among mankind, *of* him who is relying on the provisions
of the law and *its* unchangeableness from goodness, *and* who is a
teacher and provider of teaching *as to* the pre-eminent existence of
the good religion of the sacred beings.

20\. And a summary about the bringing together of that fire which is the
residue of a fire in a house, for the reverence of that water which is
nearest to the dwelling, and *of* any spirit of a kinsman; and as *to
him* who leaves that fire, water, and spirit, and, on account of a
similar desire, reverences another fire, water, and spirit, *but* none
of them can accept that ceremonial, and the acceptance of that man's
ceremonial *by* the others *will* have occurred just when the *former*
three are reverenced by him.

21\. Righteousness is perfect excellence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_735"></span>[226:1](sbe37073.htm#fr_740.md) The second of the
Nasks and third of the Gâthic division (see Bk. VIII, Chap. I, 9, 12).
It is a second commentary on the Gâthas, devoting a fargar*d* to each ha
of the Gâthas and to each Gâthic formula, as in the Sû*d*kar Nask, but
beginning with an extra fargar*d* about the birth and calling of
Zaratû*s*t. Its chief object appears to be the quotation of texts, both
from the Gâthas and from sources no longer known.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[226:2](sbe37073.htm#fr_741.md) Here written
asrapâitô*s* (B) and asrapâîti*s* (K) in Pahlavi, which, no doubt, stand
for Av. aêthrapaiti*s*, Pers. hêrbad, 'a Zoroastrian priest.' This name
may either refer to the general subject of the fargar*d*, or have been
the first word of its Avesta text; as it seems not intended to quote any
section of the Yasna, although the guardian spirits of the priests are
reverenced in Yas. XXVI, 7, 8, before commencing the recitation of the
Gâthas.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[226:3](sbe37073.htm#fr_742.md) Av.
Maidhyô-m*a*ungha; he was first cousin of Zaratû*s*t, and also his first
disciple (see Bd. XXXII, 2, 3; Zs. XI, 10 n).

birth of his life.'

<span id="fn_739"></span>[226:5](sbe37073.htm#fr_744.md) B has ham-vîsagîh,
K ham-disagîh.

vagânŏ stands for vag*d*ânŏ, which word occurs in § 4, according to K.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[227:1](sbe37073.htm#fr_746.md) B omits 'the
shoulder *of*.'

<span id="fn_742"></span>[227:2](sbe37073.htm#fr_747.md) Av. Aredvî sûra of
Yt. V, a title of Anâhita, the female angel of the waters.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[227:3](sbe37073.htm#fr_748.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chap. IX, 3.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[227:4](sbe37073.htm#fr_749.md) Pahl. aûrûks*p*ar
= Av. uruthware.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[227:5](sbe37073.htm#fr_750.md) Av. Rita, who is
associated with the archangel Spe*ñ*ta-Ârmaiti in Yt. II, 3, 8; Sîr. I,
II, 5, and with Ashi Vanguhi in Yt. XXIV, 8.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[227:6](sbe37073.htm#fr_751.md) Av. kavaêm
*hv*arenô (see Chap. XXII, 7).

<span id="fn_747"></span>[227:7](sbe37073.htm#fr_752.md) B has 'whenever
his birth occurred.'

<span id="fn_748"></span>[227:8](sbe37073.htm#fr_753.md) This, with the
first clause of the response, is the Pahlavi version of the concluding
formula of Yas. XXVI, 11, without the extra Pahlavi glosses.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[227:9](sbe37073.htm#fr_754.md) See Bk. VIII,
Chaps. XI, 5-4, XIII, 15.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[228:1](sbe37073.htm#fr_755.md) This is the

(nyôsh).

<span id="fn_754"></span>[229:3](sbe37073.htm#fr_759.md) Assuming that
nizôrinî*d*anŏ (K) stands for nizârînî*d*anŏ; B has zôrînî*d*anŏ, which
is synonymous with the previous nîrûkînî*d*anŏ, 'strengthening.'

<span id="fn_755"></span>[230:1](sbe37073.htm#fr_760.md) Or it may be 'in
his own particular soul (nisman).'

<span id="fn_756"></span>[230:2](sbe37073.htm#fr_761.md) Pahl.
rêshî*d*ârîh, which B omits.

<span id="fn_757"></span>[230:3](sbe37073.htm#fr_762.md) This term,
gûrg-ya*z*akŏ (= Av. vehrkayâza), does not occur in the extant Avesta.

<span id="fn_758"></span>[230:4](sbe37073.htm#fr_763.md) See § 1.

<span id="fn_759"></span>[230:5](sbe37073.htm#fr_764.md) Av.
Parsha*d*-g*a*u of Yt. XIII, 96 (compare Piz. Par*s*adgâ of Bd. XXIX,
5). This name can also be read Fradâ*d*ayânŏ and be compared with Av.
Fradhidaya of Yt. XIII, 97.

<span id="fn_760"></span>[230:6](sbe37073.htm#fr_765.md) Av. Saêna of Yt.
XIII, 97, who is said to have 'first set forth upon this earth with a
hundred disciples.' Further details about him are given in Chap. XXXIII,
5. In the third and seventh books of the Dinka*rd* his name is written
*S*ênôv (for *S*ênôk or *S*ênôê) which has been read Dâyûn by Peshotan
(Dk. pp. 308-314 of English translation), as pointed out by Darmesteter
in his *Textes Pehlvis relatifs au Judaisme*, p. 3, n. 2. In Dk. VII he
is said to have been a high-priest who was born in the 100th year of the
religion, and died in its 200th year.

<span id="fn_761"></span>[230:7](sbe37073.htm#fr_766.md) See Bk. VIII,
