### CHAPTER IX.

1\. And *as to* that which is written <span
id="fr_1210"></span>[1](#fn_1206), that '*the teachings of*
Mê*d*yôk-mâh, Afarg, and Sôshâns <span id="fr_1211"></span>[2](#fn_1207)
have all three come *and* remained, and, on that account, whoever *has*
washed just as they always wash therein is certain that he is worthy.'
2. Also, 'should it have been as *it were* proper to them, would
Mê*d*yôk-mâh have said that "not even the purifier is single?"' 3. *And*
the rest as written an that subject, which, on account of its acute
observation, *has* seemed *to be* from their statements; they, however,
*have* not decided it so by the teaching which is in their names, as
*was* indicated by me before <span id="fr_1212"></span>[3](#fn_1208).

4\. But I do not so understand that 'if those should have been all the
particulars of the peculiarity of all three teachings, would *the
teachings* of Mê*d*yôk-mâh and Sôshâns have said, concerning any one who
should have so washed that the purifier was single, that it is suitable,
because the high-priests have been thus very unanimous that when

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

there is one he is unsuitable <span id="fr_1213"></span>[1](#fn_1209)?
5. And when it should be to them as *it were* proper that, apart from
the hands, the other <span id="fr_1214"></span>[2](#fn_1210) customary
*parts* (pî*s*akŏ) *should be* washed once by them, would Afarg have
said it is proper <span id="fr_1215"></span>[3](#fn_1211), because
washing them three times is not mentioned in the Avesta? 6. And when it
would have been as *it were* proper that the three hundred pebbles
(sang) *should* not *be* cast *into* the water and bull's urine, *would*
Afarg's *teaching have* said that it is proper <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[4](#fn_1212), because there is not a single use for
a pebble (sagî*k*akŏ)? 7. And when it would be as *it were* proper that
*he who* is washed at the ablution seats (mak) at which any one *has
been* washed *during* the length of a year, is not injured thereby--only
they shall take them away *and they* are again deposited <span
id="fr_1217"></span>[5](#fn_1213)--would Mê*d*yôk-mâh's *teaching* have
said that it is proper, because, when the stones (sagŏ) are again
deposited by one, *it* is to effect the cleansing (vistari*s*nŏ) of some
one,

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

*and* when a *shower of* rain occurs thereon so *that* the whole place
shall be thoroughly wetted, inside *and* outside, it is proper? 8. And
if some one says that this is the case of a rite by a teaching of
authority, and the rule is by a teaching of private authority, is not
the whole rite by any teaching proper, that *consists* in this washing
which is thoroughly preserved as they keep *it* in practice <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[1](#fn_1214)?'

9\. The reply is even this, that every rite (nîrông) is to be performed
*in* such manner as *that* which is said *to be* most preservative, and
most connected with the declaration of revelation *and* the testimony of
the high-priests *concerning* it. 10. And not for the reason that
Mê*d*yôk-mâh's *teaching* is more preservative <span
id="fr_1219"></span>[2](#fn_1215) as to one rite, and after that
some-thing of Afarg is more preservative, is the operation to be
performed by the statement of Mê*d*yôk-mâh; *but* whatever is the more
preservative of Mê*d*yôk-mâh's is collected from Mê*d*yôk-mâh, all the
more preservative of Afarg from Afarg, *and* that which is the more
preservative of *any* other high-priest from that which *has* the most
preservative approval of the high-priest. 11. That which those
high-priests *have* said, which they decide by just authority, is the
commandment of the learned of the realm, which has lawfully arisen over
the provinces (shôhârânŏ); but even that statement opposing it *which*
is much testified *and* manifestly more of a deliverance, or which is
declared *as* an exposition

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

of the teaching of high-priests of the religion in a dissimilar case,
they shall then <span id="fr_1220"></span>[1](#fn_1216) wholly accept,
and *they* are to perform the operation authorisedly *and*
preservatively thereby.

12\. This, too, I so consider, *that* even if each separate teaching
should be as *it were* proper, it would then not be determined by them
as to the impropriety of the *purifying* cup, for Mê*d*yôk-mâh *has*
stated, only as *it was* apparent to him, that every single customary
*part* is to be washed for three times <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[2](#fn_1217), *and has* not specifically determined
that when all shall be *so* once it is not proper. 13. By the special
teaching of Mê*d*yôk-mâh and the washing which is in the law that
says--concerning those interpreting revelation--that whoever becomes
quite polluted shall thoroughly wash by that law, so that his *being*
washed is to be considered as *being* washed, it (the rite) is not
performed by me if, also, that other high-priest *has* said, that every
one who becomes quite polluted, *and* washes not by the law of the
primitive faith, is not to be considered as washed. 14. Then, too, in
the special teaching of Mê*d*yôk-mâh *it* is not said, *of* that washing
which is washed by the law of those of a portion of the religion
(pârak-dînôân), that it is note proper.

15\. He who washes by the law of those of the primitive faith, which
many high-priests maintain as excellent, because it is suitable, *and*
imagines that regarding the threefold washing it should be said that it
is not proper, even he--when he also

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

*has* become of the same opinion as to this, that the statements of the
high-priests are on an equality, and the most evidence of the
high-priests is the *right* course--would have attained to confidence
about this, that in a doubtful matter *there* should be a
high-priest <span id="fr_1222"></span>[1](#fn_1218), and also that *of*
which Afarg and Sôshâns *have* alike understood a similar thing is
proper.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[312:1](sbe18110.htm#fr_1210) In the epistle
to which he is replying.

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[312:2](sbe18110.htm#fr_1211) See Chap. V, 1.

<span id="fn_1208"></span>[312:3](sbe18110.htm#fr_1212) See Chap. VI,
2-4.

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[313:1](sbe18110.htm#fr_1213) The writer says
he does not understand this argument of his correspondents, because it
differs from the view he takes in Chap. VI, 2, but it must be confessed
that the meaning of the passage in dispute (Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, b) is
not very clear, as the word ashâye*d*, 'he is unsuitable,' can also. be
read ae shâye*d*, 'he would be suitable,' both there and in our text.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[313:2](sbe18110.htm#fr_1214) K35 has one line
blank here, but this was probably owing to the state of the paper, or
some inadvertence of the copyist; as it is evident that none of the text
is omitted.

<span id="fn_1211"></span>[313:3](sbe18110.htm#fr_1215) Compare Chap.
VI, 9-I1.

<span id="fn_1212"></span>[313:4](sbe18110.htm#fr_1216) Compare Chap.
VII, 16-18.

<span id="fn_1213"></span>[313:5](sbe18110.htm#fr_1217) This shows that
the places for ablution during the Bareshnûm ceremony were, a thousand
years ago, the same as now, namely, stones deposited on the ground, not
holes dug in the ground, as directed in Vend. IX, 13, 14, 16. They are,
in fact, the stones or hard material directed to be deposited at the
holes in Vend. IX, 29, 30, but they go by the old name for the holes
(magh).

<span id="fn_1214"></span>[314:1](sbe18110.htm#fr_1218) This string of
arguments appears to be quoted from the epistle to which the writer is
replying, but as they are separated from their context it is difficult
to understand the exact line of argument. or to be sure that they are
translated correctly.

<span id="fn_1215"></span>[314:2](sbe18110.htm#fr_1219) From pollution
or sin.

<span id="fn_1216"></span>[315:1](sbe18110.htm#fr_1220) That is, when
the dissimilar case arises, or when it is manifestly more efficient.

<span id="fn_1217"></span>[315:2](sbe18110.htm#fr_1221) See Chap. VI, 7.

<span id="fn_1218"></span>[316:1](sbe18110.htm#fr_1222) To consult about
the matters in doubt.
