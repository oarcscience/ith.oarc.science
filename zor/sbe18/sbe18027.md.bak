### CHAPTER XIX.

1\. The eighteenth question is that which you ask thus: When the souls
of the righteous *and* the souls of the wicked go out to the spirits,
will it then be possible for them to see Aûha*r*ma*zd* and Aharman <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_123.md), or not?

2\. The reply is this, that concerning Aharman it is said that his is no
material existence (stîs); *and* Aûha*r*ma*zd*, as a spirit among the
spirits, is to be heard by those who are material and those also who are
spiritual, *but his* form (kerpô) is not completely visible except
through wisdom. 3. And a semblance of *his* power is seen, as *was* told
unto Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân when he saw the result (zah) of his
handiwork, and he (Aûha*r*ma*zd*) spoke thus: 'Grasp the hand of a
righteous man! for the kindly operation of my religion through <span
id="fr_125"></span>[3](#fn_124.md) thee thyself is as

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

much as he shall grasp, and thou mayst see him whose reception
(mâhmânîh) of my wisdom and glory is the most.

4\. And about the souls of the righteous and wicked, in the spiritual
places they see the throne (gâs), which they deem a sight of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 5. And so also those who are domiciled with (hamnemân)
Aharman, through that wisdom with reference to whose creator they shall
suffer, will understand minutely as regards Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the nature
of Aharman (Aharmanîh). 6. And he who is of the righteous is delighted
at escaping from Aharman *and* coming to the existence pertaining to
Aûha*r*ma*zd*; and they shall offer homage to the glory <span
id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_125.md) of Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 7. And he who is
wicked, through being deceived by Aharman, and turning from the
direction (pe*l*ag) of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, becomes more vexed *and* more
penitent; the hope (zahî*s*nŏ) and forgiveness which he possesses, and
the retribution *and* manacling which are his among the fiends *and*
spirits through his own handiwork, are *by* the permission which comes
from the most persistent of the persistent <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_123"></span>[44:2](sbe18027.htm#fr_124.md) The evil spirit
(see Chap. II, II), whose nature and powers differ very little from
those ascribed to the devil by most Christian writers.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[44:3](sbe18027.htm#fr_125.md) Or 'on;' or,
perhaps, it 'is as much as he shall grasp at thee thyself.'

<span id="fn_125"></span>[45:1](sbe18027.htm#fr_126.md) The word 'glory' is
always to be understood in its material sense of 'radiance, effulgence.'

<span id="fn_126"></span>[45:2](sbe18027.htm#fr_127.md) That is, from
Aûha*r*ma*zd*. The epithet khvâpar, here translated 'persistent,'
appears to mean 'self-sustaining' in the Avesta (see Sls. XXII, 21);
traditionally it is supposed to mean 'protecting, cherishing,' but this
is merely a guess, though it seems related to, Pers. khapârah, 'active,'
and may, therefore, often mean 'persevering.'
