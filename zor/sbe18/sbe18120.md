### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. To arrange again for approval the other *matters, of* which a
portion is written *about* by you, an epistle <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[3](#fn_1369) is again prepared in advance for
Sîrkân, Shirâ*z*, *and* other *places*, so as thus to make your decree a
writing of bygone offence. 2. Because, if your despatch (firîst)
prepared this new .proceeding, and you do not turn away *from* it, *and*
do not recede through opposition *and* accumulation of vexation, *and*
these others, too, like thee, shall

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

not now abandon routine of that kind, then *your* children, your own
precious *ones* who are beloved--*of* whom I know that you make them
love *you*, and do not, moreover, diminish in *your* protection *of
them*--shall be your accusers; *and* they shall abandon confidence *in*
me as refuge and guardian, *and* in the sacred beings, through want of
advice *and* want of guardianship. 3. The fires of the sacred fires
whose manager is a guard *and* protection such as I, lest they *should*
not obtain such an officiating priest (zôtŏ), *will have* in defence and
guardianship of themselves to make back to *their* Shirâ*z* abode. 4.
And *I* myself *shall have* to retire (agvira*z*î*d*anŏ) from the
countries of Irân, *and* to wander forth to far distant realms where I
*shall* not hear a rumour about your evil deeds. 5. In *my* occupation,
moreover, my fortune (sukûn) *may be* to wander forth by water even to
China, or by land even to Arûm <span id="fr_1375"></span>[1](#fn_1370);
but *to be* carried off by Vâê <span id="fr_1376"></span>[2](#fn_1371),
that uplifter, is much more my desire than when I am there where, owing
to you, I hear that, as regards the glorifying of the sacred beings,
which, because of my reply obtained above, *would* then *be* as much as
death to me; *it would* also be the ending of that internal strife, *so*
distasteful (aparvârakŏ) to me, which is like *his* who *has* to
struggle with his own life.
