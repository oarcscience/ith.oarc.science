<p>1. <I>As to</I> the thirty-seventh question and reply, that which you ask is thus: The measure that they</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A></p>  
<p>measure good works <I>with being</I> revealed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, how is it then <I>when</I> there is more, or not, done by us?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that every thought, word, and deed whose result is joy, happiness, and commendable recompense--when a happy result is obtainable, and the exuberance (afz&ucirc;n&#335;) of thought, word, and deed is important--is well-thought, well-said, and well-done&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 3. And for him the result of whose wish for good works is conclusively joy and exaltation of soul--which are his attainment of recompense from the constantly-beneficial space&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the immortal <I>and</I> unlimited, which shall never perish--there is no measure of the multitude of good works. 4. For every one by whom many are performed, and <I>who</I> engages in still more, appropriates the result more fully, and is more worthy; <I>but</I> it is not obtained for the completion of that which is a <I>definite</I> measure, therefore he does not obtain still more, and it is not necessary <I>he should</I>; and it is, moreover not obtained even for the completion of a limit of unlimitedness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

XIII, 2-4, XXIV, 5, 6); if the good works exceed the sins by a very small quantity the soul is supposed to go to the ordinary heaven (vahi<I>s</I>t&ocirc;), but if by a quantity sufficient to balance one unatonable sin it goes to the best existence, or supreme heaven (gar&ocirc;<I>d</I>m&acirc;n&ocirc;, see Sls.
