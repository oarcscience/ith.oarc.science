### CHAPTER XXXI.

1\. The thirtieth question is that which you ask thus: When a soul of
the righteous goes on to heaven, in what manner does it go; also, who
receives it, who leads <span id="fr_198"></span>[2](#fn_197.md) *it*, and
who makes it a household attendant <span id="fr_199"></span>[3](#fn_198.md)
of Aûha*r*ma*zd*? Also, does any one of the righteous in heaven come out
to meet it, and shall any thereof make enquiry of it, or how? 2. Shall
they also make up an account as to its sin *and* good works, and how is
the comfort and pleasantness in heaven shown to it; also, what is its
food? 3. *Is it* also their assistance which

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

reaches unto the world, or not? And is the limit (sâmânŏ) of heaven
manifest, or what way *is it*?

4\. The reply is this, that a soul of the righteous steps forth unto
heaven through the strength of the spirit of good works, *along* with
the good spirit <span id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_199.md) which is the
escort (parvânakŏ) of the soul, into *its* allotted station and the
uppermost (tâyîkŏ) which is *for* its own good works; *along* with the
spiritual good works, without *those* for the world, and a crown and
coronet <span id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_200.md), a turban-sash and a
fourfold fillet-pendant  <span id="fr_202"></span>[3](#fn_201.md), a
decorated robe (*g*âmakŏ) and suitable equipments, spiritually flying
unto heaven (vahi*s*tô), or to the supreme heaven (garô*d*mân), there
where its place is. 5. And Vohûman  <span
id="fr_203"></span>[4](#fn_202.md), the archangel, makes it a household
attendant (khavag-î-mânînê*d*ŏ) to Aûha*r*ma*zd* the creator, *and* by
order of Aûha*r*ma*zd* announces *its* position (gâs) and reward; *and*
it becomes glad to beg for the position of household attendant of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, through what it sees and knows.

6\. Aûha*r*ma*zd* the creator of good producers

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (dahâkân) is a
spirit even among spirits, and spirits even *have* looked for a sight of
him; which spirits are manifestly above worldly existences  <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_203.md). 7. But when, through the majesty <span
id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_204.md) of the creator, spirits put on worldly
appearances (vêni*s*nŏîhâ), or are attending (sinâyânîkŏ) to the world
and spirit, and put away appearance (vêni*s*nŏ apadŏ*g*ênd), then he
whose patron spirit (ahvô) <span id="fr_206"></span>[3](#fn_205.md) is in
the world is able to see the attending spirits, in such similitude as
when they see bodies in which is a soul <span
id="fr_207"></span>[4](#fn_206.md), or when they see a fire in which is
Varahrân <span id="fr_208"></span>[5](#fn_207.md), or see water in which is
its own spirit <span id="fr_209"></span>[6](#fn_208.md). 8. Moreover, in
that household attendance, *that* Aûha*r*ma*zd* *has* seen the soul is
certain, for Aûha*r*ma*zd* sees all *things*; and many even of the
fiend's souls <span id="fr_210"></span>[7](#fn_209.md), who are put away
from those of Aûha*r*ma*zd* in spiritual understanding, are delighted by
the appearance (numû*d*anŏ) of those of Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

9\. And the righteous in heaven, who have been

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

his intimate friends, of the same religion and like goodness, speak to
him *of* the display of affection, the courteous enquiry, and the
suitable eminence from coming to heaven, and his everlasting well-being
in heaven.

10\. And the account as to sin and good works does not occur unto the
heavenly *ones; it is* itself among the perplexing questions of this
treatise, for the taking of the account and the atonement for the sins
of a soul of those passed *away and* appointed unto heaven happen
so <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_210), although its place (gâs.md) is
there <span id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_211.md) until the renovation *of the
universe*, and *it has* no need for a new account. 11. And that account
is at the time the account occurs; *those* taking the account are
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, Vohûman, Mit*r*ô, Srôsh, and Rashnû, and they shall make
up the account of all with justice, each one at his own time, as the
reply is written in its own chapter <span
id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_212.md).

12\. *As to* that which you ask concerning food, the meals of the world
are *taken* in two ways: one is the distribution of water in haste, and
one is with enjoyment (aûrvâ*z*i*s*nŏ) to the end; *but* in heaven there
is no haste as to water, and rejoicing with much delight *they* are like
unto those who, as worldly beings, make an end of a meal of luxury
(aûrvâ*z*i*s*nîkîh). 13. To that also *which* is the spiritual
completion of the soul's pleasure *it* is attaining in like
proportion <span id="fr_214"></span>[4](#fn_213.md), and in its appearance
to worldly beings *it* is a butter of the name of Maî*d*yôk-zarem <span
id="fr_215"></span>[5](#fn_214.md). 14. And the reason of

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

that name of it is this, that of the material food in the world that
which is the product of cattle is said *to be* the best (pâshûm), among
the products of cattle *in use* as food is the butter of milk, and among
butters that is extolled as to goodness which they shall make *in* the
second month of the year <span id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_215.md), and when
Mit*r*ô <span id="fr_217"></span>[2](#fn_216.md) is in the constellation
Taurus; as that month is scripturally (dînôîkŏ) called Zaremêyâ <span
id="fr_218"></span>[3](#fn_217.md), the explanation of the name to be
accounted *for* is this, that its worldly representative (andâ*z*ako) is
the best food in the world.

15\. And *there* is no giving out of assistance *by* the soul of the
righteous from heaven and the supreme heaven  <span
id="fr_219"></span>[4](#fn_218.md); for, *as to* that existence full

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

of joy, *there* is then no deserving of it for *any* one unless each one
is fully worthy of it. 16. But the soul has a remembrance of the world
and worldly people, *its* relations *and* gossips; and he who is
unremembered and unexpecting (abarmarva*d*) is undisturbed, and enjoys
in his own time all the pleasure of the world as it occurs in the
renovation *of the universe*, and wishes to attain to it. 17. And, in
like manner, of the comfort, pleasure, and joy of the soul, which,
*being* attained in proportion, they cause to produce in heaven and the
supreme heaven, its own good works of every kind are a comfort and
pleasure such as *there* are in the world from a man who is a wise
friend--he who is a reverent worshipper--and other educated men, to her
who is a beautiful, modest, *and* husband-loving woman--she who is a
manager (ârâstâr) under protection--and other women who are clever
producers of advantage <span id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_219.md). 18.
This <span id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_220.md), too, *which arises* from
beasts of burden, cattle, wild beasts, birds, fish, and other species of
animals; this, too, from luminaries, fires, streams (hû-ta*g*i*s*nân),
winds, decorations, metals, and coloured earths; this, too, which is
from the fences (pardakânŏ) of grounds, houses, *and* the primitive
lands of the well-yielding *cattle*; this <span
id="fr_222"></span>[3](#fn_221.md), too, which is from rivers, fountains,
wells, and the primary species of water; this, too, which is from trees
and shrubs, fruits, grain, and fodder, salads, aromatic herbs, *and*
other plants; this, too, which is

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

the preparation of the land for these <span
id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_222.md) creatures *and* primitive creations;
this, too, from the species of pleasant tastes, smells, and colours of
all natures, the producers of protections <span
id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_223), the patron spirits (ahûân.md), and the
appliances of the patron spirits, can come unto mortals.

19\. And what the spirit of good works is in similitude is expressly a
likeness of stars and males, females and cattle, fires and sacred fires,
metals of every kind, dogs, lands, waters, *and* plants  <span
id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_224.md). 20. The spiritual good works are
attached (a*v*ayûkhtô) to the soul, and in the degree and proportion
which are their strength, due to the advancement of good works by him
who is righteous, *they* are suitable as enjoyment for him who is
righteous. 21. He obtains durability thereby <span
id="fr_226"></span>[4](#fn_225.md) and necessarily preparation, conjointly
*with* constant pleasure and without a single day's vexation
(ayômaê-bêshîhâ).

22\. There is also an abundant joyfulness, of which no example is
appointed (vakhtô) in the world from the beginning, but it comes thus to
those who are heavenly ones *and* those of the supreme heaven; and of
which even the highest worldly happiness and pleasure are no similitude,
except through the possession of knowledge which is said *to be* a
sample *of it* for worldly beings.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 23. And of *its*
indications by the world the limited with the unlimited, the
imperishable with perishableness, the consumable with inconsumableness
are then no equivalent similitudes of it <span
id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_226.md). 24. And *it is* the limited,
perishable, and consumable *things* of the world's existence which are
the imperishable *and* inconsumable *ones* of the existence of endless
light <span id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_227.md), the indestructible *ones*
of the all-beneficial and ever-beneficial space (gûn*g*) <span
id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_228.md), and the all-joyful *ones*--without a
single day's vexation--of the radiant supreme heaven (garô*d*mânô). 25:
And the throne (gâs) of the righteous in heaven and the supreme heaven
is the reward he obtains first, and is his until the resurrection, when
even the world becomes pure *and* undisturbed; *he* is himself
unchangeable thereby, *but* through the resurrection he obtains what is
great and good and perfect, *and* is eternally glorious.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_197"></span>[63:2](sbe18038.htm#fr_198.md) It is doubtful
whether the verb be yezrûn (a corruption of yezderûn) or dezrûn (a
corruption of dedrûn), but both forms are traceable to the same Semitic
root (‏ו ?D?B?R‎), one with and the other without the prefix 'ye,' and
both, therefore, have nearly the same meaning.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[63:3](sbe18038.htm#fr_199.md) Reading
khavag-î-mân, 'servant of the house' (see also §§ 5, 8, Chaps. XXXII, 7,
XXXVII, 16, 17, 21, XLIII, 1, XLVIII, 41). This word occurs in Pahl.
Vend. XIX, 102, in a compound which is doubtfully read avîdamânkarânŏ,
'those acting without time, eternal ones,' in Haug's Essays, p. 388 (it
should be 'those acting as household attendants'). It also occurs in the
Pâzand tract called Aogemadaê*k*â, from its initial word (see Geiger's
ed. p. 23, § 11), where it is read a*ñ*dimânî, and translated by Sans.
pratîhâra, 'doorkeeper;' but in a Pahlavi version of this tract (which
seems to form part of the Afrîn-i Dahmân, and differs considerably from
the Pâzand text) this word is replaced by bôndak mânîk-i, 'a household
servant,' which confirms the reading adopted here.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[64:1](sbe18038.htm#fr_200.md) Probably the good
Vâê, the spirit of air (see Chaps. XXVIII, 2, 5, XXIX, 4).

<span id="fn_200"></span>[64:2](sbe18038.htm#fr_201.md) Reading rukhŏ
var*d*îvanŏ, which words also occur in AV. XII, 16, XIV, 9. A most
elaborate account of heaven and hell will be found in the Book of Ar*d*â
Vîrâf with an English Translation, ed. Hôshangji and Haug, 1872.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[64:3](sbe18038.htm#fr_202.md) Reading vâ*s* va
*k*ahârakŏ bâlak.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[64:4](sbe18038.htm#fr_203.md) Vend. XIX, 102-107
(trans. D.) states as follows: 'Up rises Vohu-manô from his golden seat;
Vohu-manô exclaims: "How hast thou come to us, thou holy one, from that
decaying world into this undecaying one?" Gladly pass the souls of the
righteous to the golden. seat of Ahura Ma*zd*a, to the golden seat of
the Amesha-spe*n*ta's, to the Garô-nmânem, the abode of Ahura Ma*zd*a,
the abode of the Amesha-spe*n*tas, the abode of all the other holy
beings.'

<span id="fn_203"></span>[65:1](sbe18038.htm#fr_204.md) Implying that
Aûha*r*ma*zd* can hardly be considered visible, except by the eye of
faith (see Chap. XIX, 2).

<span id="fn_204"></span>[65:2](sbe18038.htm#fr_205.md) Assuming that
rabâ-vânagîh is equivalent to Pers. buzurgânagî, 'magnificence.'

<span id="fn_205"></span>[65:3](sbe18038.htm#fr_206) The ahvô (Av. ahû.md)
seems to be a spiritual protector, somewhat similar to a patron saint;
as, according to the Ahunavar, the most sacred formula of the Parsis
(see Bd. I, 21. Zs. I, 12-19), both an ahû and a ratu are to be chosen,
that is, both a patron spirit and a high-priest.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[65:4](sbe18038.htm#fr_207.md) That is, he sees
the spirits by means of their material manifestations.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[65:5](sbe18038.htm#fr_208.md) The old Pahl. form
of Vâhrâm, the angel whose name is applied to the sacred fire (see Bd.
XVII, 1, 2, 9); he is the Av. Verethraghna of the Bahrain Yt.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[65:6](sbe18038.htm#fr_209.md) The female angel of
water is the Av. ardvî sûra Anâhita of the Âbân Yt.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[65:7](sbe18038.htm#fr_210.md) The souls in hell.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[66:1](sbe18038.htm#fr_211.md) As in Chap. XXIV,
5, 6.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[66:2](sbe18038.htm#fr_212.md) In heaven.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[66:3](sbe18038.htm#fr_213.md) See Chap. XIV, 2-5.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[66:4](sbe18038.htm#fr_214.md) This sentence is
rather ambiguous in the original.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[66:5](sbe18038.htm#fr_215.md) Said to be the food
of the souls in heaven (see Hn. II, 38, <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>
Mkh. II, 752); it is to be distinguished from the draught of
immortality, called Hûsh, which is prepared from the fat of the ox
Hadhayô*s* and the white Hôm at the time of the resurrection (see Bd.
XXX, 25).

<span id="fn_215"></span>[67:1](sbe18038.htm#fr_216.md) If the writer
refers to the correct solar year of Bd. XXV, 27, beginning at the vernal
equinox, the second month would be 19th April-19th May when the sun is
in the conventional sign of Taurus; but the ordinary Parsi year in his
time commenced in the middle of April, and its second month would be
May-June when the sun (about A.D. 880) would be in the actual
constellation of Taurus. So that the statements in the text afford no
certain indication of the particular calendar used by the author.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[67:2](sbe18038.htm#fr_217.md) The angel of the
sun's light, here used for the sun itself.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[67:3](sbe18038.htm#fr_218.md) The fifteenth day
of the second month of the Parsi year is the season festival called
Maidhyô-zarensaya, 'mid-verdure,' in the Avesta; being also the middle
of the second month, the author assumes that the name of that month was
originally Zaremaya, The Pahl. word can also be read Zar-mâh, 'the month
of gold, or the green month.'

<span id="fn_218"></span>[67:4](sbe18038.htm#fr_219.md) That is, there is
no intercession of saints for those still in the world. The only
interceders are the angels and guardian spirits, and they go no further
than to obtain strict justice for every one according to his worldly
merits.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[68:1](sbe18038.htm#fr_220.md) Reading sû*d* â*z*
kârânŏ, and identifying the second word with Pers. â*z*.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[68:2](sbe18038.htm#fr_221.md) That is, the
pleasure.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[68:3](sbe18038.htm#fr_222.md) This clause is
omitted in M14 and J.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[69:1](sbe18038.htm#fr_223.md) It is doubtful
whether we should read le-denmanshânŏ, a rare plural form of denman;
'this,' or whether it should be le-denman ya*zd*ânŏ; in the latter case
the translation would be 'for these creatures of the sacred beings'

<span id="fn_223"></span>[69:2](sbe18038.htm#fr_224.md) Assuming that
zinharânŏ stands for zinhârânŏ, otherwise we must read zôharânŏ,
'holy-waters.'

<span id="fn_224"></span>[69:3](sbe18038.htm#fr_225.md) The chief objects
benefited by good works.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[69:4](sbe18038.htm#fr_226.md) Reading
hangâmîh-ash, but the construction is unusual.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[70:1](sbe18038.htm#fr_227.md) Meaning that no
adequate conception can be obtained of the enjoyments of heaven by
contrasting the earthly objects which most resemble it with those most
opposed to it.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[70:2](sbe18038.htm#fr_228.md) The place of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, or heaven in general (see Bd. I, 2), where things which
are perishable on earth become everlasting.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[70:3](sbe18038.htm#fr_229.md) The
'constantly-beneficial place' of Pahl. Vend. XIX, 122, 'which is
self-sustained, (its constant beneficialness is this, that, when it once
became so, all of it became thereby ever-beneficial).' The Avesta
version (trans. D.) merely calls it 'the sovereign place of eternal
weal;' and it appears from Chap. XXXVII, 22, 24 that it is here
understood as the unlimited space of heaven, contained in the 'endless
light.'
