### CHAPTER LXXXVI.

1\. *As to* the eighty-fifth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: What is possible to become the harm of a gift *that* is reduced?

2\. The reply is this, that since *those things* are to be properly
given which are for the religious rites of the ceremonial <span
id="fr_933"></span>[1](#fn_930.md), and are the consideration of the
undertakers of all the religious rites, and are also the stipend of some
solemnizers, both <span id="fr_934"></span>[2](#fn_931.md) are living
comfortably *by* the ceremonial. 3. The sons of the disciples *who*
wanted approval for the words prayed, become so much the more to be
ordered *and* to be accepted; and the ceremonial of all the religious
rites becomes more progressive.

4\. So, moreover, when they go to undertake the well-operating activity
of the ceremonial for a diminution of remuneration *and* gift, and owing
to undertaking *and* ordering again <span
id="fr_935"></span>[3](#fn_932), by way of routine (pavan dôr râs.md), they
do not request so much stipend, *it is* as though they should buy my
linen *and* should sell *it* again for their own payment (dâ*d*anŏ). 5.
*As to* the performers of the ceremonial, likewise, who *have* to
acquire approval with much trouble and words prayed, and obtain a
remuneration which, *for* the soul even, is as little for the ceremonial
as though *one were* annoyed--whereby

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

living is difficult--they become sorry for enduring the trouble, owing
to lukewarmness (afsur*d*ŏ-mini*s*nîh) *in* the same profession. 6. And
even the sons of the disciples shall sell linen for wages, and they
rejoice *that* it is possible to learn other callings *with* less pains;
and thus they make *them* become lukewarm *and* meditating retreat
(a*v*â*z*âhang) from the words of fresh paragraphs continually
prayed <span id="fr_936"></span>[1](#fn_933.md), from the approval
requested of the learned (â*z*ân), *and* from all the religious rites
they should undertake *for* the contented.

7\. *As to* those, moreover, who, through fervent-minded undertaking of
*what* is ordered, request less *for* all the religious rites, *and
have* not obtained <span id="fr_937"></span>[2](#fn_934.md) even that which
is due *to them*, it is not even as though they ordered *of them* for
the fiends <span id="fr_938"></span>[3](#fn_935.md). 8. And the disgrace,
too, of the orderers of good works of lukewarmness is the exaltation of
the profession of the disciples; and its deficient progress becomes the
paralysation of the ceremonial of the sacred beings for saving the souls
of the good from the deadly *one* (mar).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_930"></span>[248:1](sbe18093.htm#fr_933.md) M14 has merely
'since the proper donation for the ceremonial.'

<span id="fn_931"></span>[248:2](sbe18093.htm#fr_934.md) That is, both the
undertakers and solemnizers, the chief priest and his assistants.

<span id="fn_932"></span>[248:3](sbe18093.htm#fr_935.md) Referring to a
priest who undertakes ceremonies and then directs inferiors to perform
them (see Chaps LXVI, 4, 6).

<span id="fn_933"></span>[249:1](sbe18093.htm#fr_936.md) Literally 'prayed
and prayed.'

<span id="fn_934"></span>[249:2](sbe18093.htm#fr_937.md) Reading ayâft,
instead of the unintelligible ayâ*d*t, as *d* has, no doubt, been
written for f.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[249:3](sbe18093.htm#fr_938.md) Meaning that the
orderers would act more liberally if they wanted a ceremony even in
honour of the fiends.
