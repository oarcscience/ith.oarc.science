### CHAPTER XLV.

1\. The forty-fourth question is that which you ask thus: Of priesthood
(aêrpatîh) or discipleship (hâvi*s*tîh) which is the priest's duty
(aêrpatîh), *and* which the disciple*'s*; which is that which it is
necessary to have in priesthood, *and* which in discipleship?

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

2\. The reply is this, that the priesthood and discipleship are
connected together; the priests teach the scriptures <span
id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_558.md), *and* the disciples learn the knowledge
of the religion, that is, the Avesta and Zand <span
id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_559.md). 3. The priest; have been disciples;
through the teaching of his own priest they make the aroused
existence <span id="fr_563"></span>[3](#fn_560.md) of even a disciple
become a priest, *and* in one body with the learner are the priesthood
and discipleship. 4. Through that which he has learned as a disciple
from the priest *he* is wiser, and owing to the priesthood in his own
person he teaches the disciple who is a learner; the desire which is his
craving for learning is also owing to that in his own priest, when *he
was* a disciple unto his own priest.

5\. And the disciple *and* priest are even such as is said thus: 'The
director (farmâ*d*âr) of the profession of priests (âsravŏân) of
Pârs <span id="fr_564"></span>[4](#fn_561.md), *and* chieftain over the
faithful and the officiating priests (magôpatân) of Pârs, is the leader
of the religion; and *his* disciple (ashaka*rd*ŏ) is a disciple *in* a
selected foremost position among the priests of the religion, set up
(madam â*g*ast) over those acquainted with the commentary
(zand-âkâsânŏ).' 6. The

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

more infallible (a*s*aktar) of these is the powerful skill of the priest
(aêrpatŏ) put forth through the ritual *and* Vispara*d* <span
id="fr_565"></span>[1](#fn_562.md), and *his* skill in the commentary
(zand); the skill of disciples in the Avesta is, further, fully
understood, *and* sin *recognised* as oppressive, through the formulas
(nîrang) of the sacred ceremony, ablution and non-ablution, purity and
pollution.

7\. And both professions are the indispensable preservers of great
decisions *as to* that which the priestly disposition *has* taught,
done, and considered about the perpetual existence of every being, the
complete goodness *and* final success of the non-existent evil *and*
entire good of the sacred beings, the annihilation of the demons <span
id="fr_566"></span>[2](#fn_563.md), *and* the complete understanding of the
friends of the sacred beings.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_558"></span>[152:1](sbe18052.htm#fr_561.md) The word mâ*d*igân
means a treatise upon almost any subject, but it is specially applied to
the Nasks or books of the complete ancient literature of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, which are now nearly all lost. It should be noted
that 'teaching' and 'learning' are expressed by the same word in
Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[152:2](sbe18052.htm#fr_562.md) The Avesta is the
religious literature in its original language, erroneously called Zend
by Europeans, and the Zand is the Pahlavi translation of the same
literature, with the Pahlavi commentary (see Bd. Introd. p. x).

<span id="fn_560"></span>[152:3](sbe18052.htm#fr_563.md) Reading ham-vîkhtŏ
yehevûnîh and taking ham-vîkhtŏ as equivalent to Pers. angîkht.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[152:4](sbe18052.htm#fr_564.md) This was the post
held by the author himself (see Chap. XCIV, 13).

<span id="fn_562"></span>[153:1](sbe18052.htm#fr_565.md) The term ya*s*tô,
'ritual,' means any form of prayer with ceremony, and appears to include
the Yasna or chief ceremonial ritual. The Vispara*d* (here written
Vispôrê*d*ŏ) is a particular form of ceremonial prayer, the various
sections of which are interspersed among those of the Yasna and
Vendidâ*d* in the full liturgy of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers; it is called
Vispara*d*, 'all chiefs,' because it commences with an invocation of all
the spiritual chiefs of the universe.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[153:2](sbe18052.htm#fr_566.md) K35 has kha*s*ânŏ,
which might stand for khasânŏ, 'reptiles,' but is more probably a slight
alteration of *s*êdânŏ,' demons,' which would correspond to the more
modern form, *s*edâânŏ, in M14.
