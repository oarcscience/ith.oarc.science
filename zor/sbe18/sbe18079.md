### CHAPTER LXXII.

1\. *As to* the seventy-first question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: What are the heinous sins of committing unnatural intercourse,
is it proper to order *or* perform the *sacred* ceremony for him who
shall commit unnatural intercourse, *and* is it then proper to practise
sitting together and eating together with him who shall commit *it*, and
shall commit *it with* a longing for it, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that of the evil Ma*zd*a-worshippers <span
id="fr_800"></span>[2](#fn_797)--who *were* the seven evil-doers of sin
of a heinous kind <span id="fr_801"></span>[3](#fn_798), whose practice
of Aharman's *will was* as much as an approximation to *that of* 

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aharman
*himself*--two are those whom you have mentioned, who are defiled with
mutual sin. 3. For, of those seven evil-doers, one *was* A*z*-î
Dahâk <span id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_799), by whom witchcraft *was*
first glorified; he exercised the sovereignty of misgovernment, and
desired a life of the unintellectual (ahangân khayâ) for the world. 4.
One *was* A*z*î Sruvar <span id="fr_803"></span>[2](#fn_800), by whom
infesting the highway *in* terrible modes, frightful watchfulness
(vîmag-bî*d*ârîh) <span id="fr_804"></span>[3](#fn_801) of the road, and
devouring of horse *and* man *were* perpetrated. 5. One *was*
Va*d*ak <span id="fr_805"></span>[4](#fn_802) the mother of Dahâk, by
whom adultery *was* first committed, and by it all lineage is disturbed,
control is put an end to, and without the authority of the husband an
intermingling of son with son <span id="fr_806"></span>[5](#fn_803)
occurs. 6. One *was* the Vîptak <span id="fr_807"></span>[6](#fn_804)
('pathic')

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

*in* the intercourse of males, the infecundity of which is the desire of
men; and by him the intercourse of males *and* the way of destroying the
seed *were* first shown unto males. 7. One *was* the Vîpînî*d*ak <span
id="fr_808"></span>[1](#fn_805) ('pæderast'), the male by whom the use
of females *was* first brought among the errors (khazdag) of the male,
and *was* despised (dûkhtŏ) by him; he who is a cherisher of seed is
delivering *it* to females, and that which is destroying the seed is the
flowing of stenches into the prescribed vessels <span
id="fr_809"></span>[2](#fn_806) for it, the delivering *it* to males by
a demoniacal process, and carrying on a practice which effaces
(âhan*g*ê*d*ŏ) *and* conceals the race <span
id="fr_810"></span>[3](#fn_807) of the living. 8. One *was* Tûr-î
Brâ*d*ar-vakhsh <span id="fr_811"></span>[4](#fn_808), the Karap *and*
heterodox wizard, by whom the best of men *was* put to death. 9. And one
*was* he by whom the religions of apostates <span
id="fr_812"></span>[5](#fn_809) *were* preferred--through the
deceitfulness of the perverted text and interpretation <span
id="fr_813"></span>[6](#fn_810) which they themselves utter--to the law
which the righteous

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

*has* praised, that existence *which* would have procured a complete
remedy, *and* would have become the eternity of the records which bestow
salvation, through the good righteousness which is owing to the pure
religion, the best of knowledge.

10\. And they who are defiled by a propensity to stench are thereby
welcoming the demons *and* fiends <span id="fr_814"></span>[1](#fn_811),
*and* are far from good thought <span id="fr_815"></span>[2](#fn_812)
through vexing *it*; and a distance from them is *to be maintained* of
necessity in sitting and eating with *them*, except so far as *it may
be* opportune for the giving of incitement *by* words for withdrawing
(pa*d*âli*s*nŏ) from *their* sinfulness, while converting *them* from
that propensity. 11. *Should one* die, to order a ceremonial for him is
indecorous, and to perform *it* would be unauthorised; but if *he were*
to do *so* penitently *one* would then be authorised to perform his
ceremonial after the three *nights* <span
id="fr_816"></span>[3](#fn_813), for it is the remedy for atonement of
sin. 12. And so long as *he* is living *he* is in the contingencies
(vakhtagânŏ) owing to the sickness through which *he* is in that way an
infamous *one* (akhamî*d*âr), and *there* are no preventives (bôndagânŏ)
and medicinal powder for it; these are teachings also for the duty and
good works of a ceremonial for the soul <span
id="fr_817"></span>[4](#fn_814).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_797"></span>[216:2](sbe18079.htm#fr_800) M14 has 'of a like
evil practice, in inclination for sins, were the very heinous in the
religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers.'

<span id="fn_798"></span>[216:3](sbe18079.htm#fr_801) Reading girâî van
vinâs, and assuming that van is a miswriting of gûn.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[217:1](sbe18079.htm#fr_802) See Chap.. XXXVII,
97.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[217:2](sbe18079.htm#fr_803) A personification
of Av. a*z*i srvara, a serpent or dragon thus described in the Hôm Yt.
(Yas. IX, 34-39):--'(Keresâspa) who slew the serpent Srvara which
devoured horses and men, which was poisonous and yellow, over which
yellow poison flowed a hand's-breadth (spear's-length?) high. On which
Keresâspa cooked a beverage in a caldron at the mid-day hour, and the
serpent scorched, hissed, sprang forth, away from the caldron, and upset
the boiling water; Keresâspa Nareman*a*u fled aside frightened' (see
Haug's Essays, pp. 178, 179). The same account is given in Zamyâ*d* Yt.
40.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[217:3](sbe18079.htm#fr_804) M14 has
bîmînî*d*ârîh, 'terrifying.'

<span id="fn_802"></span>[217:4](sbe18079.htm#fr_805) See Chap. LXXVIII,
a. There is possibly some connection between this name and the Av.
epithet, Vadhaghana, which is thus mentioned by the evil spirit,
speaking to Zaratû*s*t, in Vend. XIX, 23:--'Curse the good
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion! and thou shalt obtain fortune such as the
Vadhaghana sovereign obtained;' and Mkh. LVII, 25 calls him 'the
Va*d*agân sovereign Dahâk.' The Pahlavi writers seem to have taken this
epithet as a matronymic, owing to its form, but whether the mother's
name be really traditional, or merely manufactured from the epithet, is
doubtful.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[217:5](sbe18079.htm#fr_806) Reading levatman
ba*r*man ba*r*man, instead of levatman bûm ba*r*man. M14 omits bûm.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[217:6](sbe18079.htm#fr_807) Av. viptô (p. p.
of vip, 'to sow, to fecundate'), used in the <span id="page_218">p.
218</span> sense of 'a pathic' in Vend. VIII, 102. This name, as well as
the next one, is used here more as representing a class than an
individual.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[218:1](sbe18079.htm#fr_808) The p. p. of the
causal form of vîptanŏ, 'to fecundate,' used as an equivalent of the Av.
vaêpayô of Vend. VIII, 102.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[218:2](sbe18079.htm#fr_809) Assuming that
pavan pavan mû*d*ragânŏ stands for pavan farmû*d* ragânŏ; but there is
some doubt as to the correct reading of several words in this section.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[218:3](sbe18079.htm#fr_810) Or 'seed.'

<span id="fn_808"></span>[218:4](sbe18079.htm#fr_811) The eldest of five
brothers who were wizards of the Karap race or caste, and deadly enemies
of Zaratû*s*t (see Byt. II, 3). He is said to have slain Zaratû*s*t in
the end.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[218:5](sbe18079.htm#fr_812) Aharmôkô, Av.
ashemaogha, means literally 'disturbing the right,' and is a term
applied to an ungodly man specially under the influence of the evil
spirit, as an apostate is naturally supposed to be.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[218:6](sbe18079.htm#fr_813) The Avesta and
Zand.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[219:1](sbe18079.htm#fr_814) Who are supposed
to seize upon them and pervade them; hence the necessity of shunning
such men, to avoid contamination from the demons who possess them.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[219:2](sbe18079.htm#fr_815) That is, from what
is personified in the archangel Vohûman.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[219:3](sbe18079.htm#fr_816) During which the
soul is supposed to remain on earth, hovering about the body, after
death (see Chaps. XX, 2, XXIV, 2, XXV, 2).

<span id="fn_814"></span>[219:4](sbe18079.htm#fr_817) That is, they are
warnings to him to repent.
