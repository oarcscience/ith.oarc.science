### CHAPTER XXXVI.

1\. The thirty-fifth question is that which you ask thus: Who are they
who are requisite in producing the renovation *of the universe*, who
were they, *and* how are they?

2\. The reply is this, that of those assignable for that most perfect
work the statements recited are lengthy, for even Gâyômar*d*, Yim the
splendid, Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân <span id="fr_254"></span>[2](#fn_253.md),
the *spiritual* chief (ra*d*ŏ) of the righteous, and many great
thanksgivers *were* 

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

appointed for completing the appliances of the renovation; and their
great miracles and successful (a*v*a*k*îragânîk) management *have* moved
on, which works for the production of the renovation <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_254.md). 3. Likewise, on the approach of the
renovation, Keresâsp <span id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_255.md) the Sâmân who
smites Dahâk, Kaî-Khûsrôî <span id="fr_257"></span>[3](#fn_256.md) who was
made to pass *away* by Vâê the long-continuing lord <span
id="fr_258"></span>[4](#fn_257.md), Tûs and Vêvan <span
id="fr_259"></span>[5](#fn_258) the allies (a*v*âkânŏ.md), *and* many other
mighty doers are aiding the production of the renovation.

4\. But those who are the producers of the renovation more *renowned*
throughout the spheres (vâspôharakânîktar) are said *to be* seven, whose
names are Rôshanô-*k*ashm <span id="fr_260"></span>[6](#fn_259.md),
Khûr-*k*ashm, Frâda*d*-gadman,

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Vâ*r*eda*d*-gadman, Kâmak-vakhshi*s*n, Kâmak-sû*d*, and Sôshâns. 5. As
it is said that in the fifty-seven years <span
id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_260.md), which are the period of the raising of
the dead, Rôshanô-*k*ashm in Arzâh <span
id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_261.md), Khûr-*k*ashm in Savâh, Frâda*d*-gadman
in Frada*d*âfsh, Vâ*r*eda*d*-gadman in Vî*d*adâfsh, Kâmak-vakhshi*s*n in
Vôrûbar*s*t, and Kâmak-sû*d* in Vôrû*g*ar*s*t, while Sôshâns in the
illustrious *and* pure Khvanîras is connected with them, are immortal.
6. The completely good sense, perfect hearing, and full glory of those
seven producers of the renovation are so miraculous that they converse
from region unto region, every one together with the six *others*, just
as now men at an interview utter words of conference and co-operation
with the tongue, one to the other, and can hold a conversation <span
id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_262.md).

7\. The same perfect deeds for six <span id="fr_264"></span>[4](#fn_263.md)
years in the six *other* regions, and for fifty years in the illustrious
Khvanîras <span id="fr_265"></span>[5](#fn_264.md), prepare immortality,
and set going everlasting

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

life and everlasting weal (sû*d*îh) through the help and power and glory
of the omniscient *and* beneficent spirit, the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_253"></span>[77:2](sbe18043.htm#fr_254.md) See Chap. II, 10.
His title, which is nearly always written Spîtamân in K35 (rarely
Spîtâmân), is Av. spitama or spitâma, but is usually understood to mean
'descendant of Spitama,' his ancestor in the ninth generation (see Bd.
XXXII, I).

<span id="fn_254"></span>[78:1](sbe18043.htm#fr_255.md) That is, even these
ancient rulers and legislators have contributed to the final renovation
of the universe by their wise actions and laws.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[78:2](sbe18043.htm#fr_256.md) See Chap. XVII 6.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[78:3](sbe18043.htm#fr_257.md) Av. Kavi
Husravangh, the third king of the Kayânian dynasty (see Bd. XXXI, 25,
XXXIV, 7), whose mysterious disappearance, as related in the Shâhnâmah,
is evidently alluded to here.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[78:4](sbe18043.htm#fr_258.md) The Av. vayãm
dareghô-*hv*adhâitîm of Khûrshêd Nyâyish, 1, that seems to be identified
here with the good Vâê (see Chap. XXX, 4), who conducts the soul to the
other world.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[78:5](sbe18043.htm#fr_259.md) The Tûs and Gîw of
Bd. XXIX, 6 and the Shâhnâmah, where they are said to have been frozen
in the mountain snow, with other warriors, after the disappearance of
Kai-Khûsrôî. They are the Av. Tusa of Âbân Yt. 53, 58, and, perhaps,
Gaêvani of Fravar*d*în Yt. 115, but the Pahlavi form Vêvan (or Vîvô) of
our text is inconsistent with the latter identification; the form Gîw of
Bd. XXIX, 6 is merely Pâzand.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[78:6](sbe18043.htm#fr_260.md) These names are the
Av. Rao*k*as-*k*aêshman, Hvare-*k*aêshman, Frâda*d*-*hv*arenô,
Vareda*d*-*hv*arenô, Vouru-nemô, Vouru-savô, and Saoshyãs of Fravar*d*în
Yt. 128, 2 29, partly transcribed, partly translated, and partly
corrupted into Pahlavi. The corruptions are easily explained thus: Av.
vouru, 'wide,' when written in Pahlavi is often identical with varen,
'desire,' and has been so read by a later copyist and then translated by
its synonym kâmak; Av. <span id="page_79">p. 79</span> nemô is
translated by Pahl. nîyâyi*s*n, 'homage, praise,' which is written very
much like vakhshi*s*n, 'increase,' and has been so read by a later
copyist. For the first two names and the fast see Chap. II, 10.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[79:1](sbe18043.htm#fr_261.md) The same period is
mentioned in Bd. XXX, 7.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[79:2](sbe18043.htm#fr_262.md) That is, there is
one of the seven producers of the renovation in each of the seven
Kêshvars, or regions of the earth, of which Arzâh is the western, Savâh
the eastern, Frada*d*âfsh and Vî*d*adâfsh the two southern, Vôrûbar*s*t
and Vôrû*g*ar*s*t the two northern, and Khvanîras the central one (see
Bd. V, 8, y, XI, 2-4)

<span id="fn_262"></span>[79:3](sbe18043.htm#fr_263.md) If this passage
were found in the Christian scriptures, it would very probably be
considered as a prophetical allusion to the electric telegraph and
telephone.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[79:4](sbe18043.htm#fr_264.md) So in all MSS., but
one would expect it to be 'seven,' so as to complete the fifty-seven
years of § 5. The number being written in ciphers the difference between
'six' and 'seven' is very slight.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[79:5](sbe18043.htm#fr_265.md) This central region
of the earth is that which contains Irân and all lands well known to the
Irânians.
