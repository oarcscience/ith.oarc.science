### CHAPTER XXX.

1\. The twenty-ninth question is that which you ask thus: The third
night, in the light of dawn, what is the reason for consecrating
separately the three sacred cakes <span id="fr_188"></span>[4](#fn_187.md)
with three dedications (shnûman)?

2\. The reply is this, that one sacred cake, whose dedication is *to*
Rashnû *and* Â*s*tâ*d* <span id="fr_189"></span>[5](#fn_188.md), is for
 <span id="fr_190"></span>[6](#fn_189.md) satisfying

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

the light of dawn and the period of Atûshahîn <span
id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_190.md), because the mountain Aûshdâ*s*târ <span
id="fr_192"></span>[2](#fn_191.md) is mentioned in the propitiation of the
angel Â*s*tâ*d*. 3. With Â*s*tâ*d* is the propitiation of the period of
Aûshahîn <span id="fr_193"></span>[3](#fn_192.md), and *she* is the ruler
of glory <span id="fr_194"></span>[4](#fn_193.md) of that time when the
account occurs; the souls are in the light of the dawn of Aûshahîn when
they go to the account; their passage (vi*d*âr) is through the bright
dawn.

4\. One sacred cake, which is in propitiation of the good Vâê <span
id="fr_195"></span>[5](#fn_194.md), is, moreover, on this account: whereas
the bad Vâê <span id="fr_196"></span>[6](#fn_195.md) is a despoiler and
destroyer, even so the good Vâê is a resister (kûkhshî*d*âr), and
likewise encountering the bad Vâê; *he* is also a diminisher (vizû*d*âr)
of his abstraction of life,

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

and a receiver and protection of life, on account of the sacred
cake <span id="fr_197"></span>[1](#fn_196.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_187"></span>[61:4](sbe18037.htm#fr_188.md) The drôn, or sacred
cake, is a small flexible pancake which is consecrated in the
ceremonies, and dedicated to some particular spirit by means of the
shnûman, or propitiatory dedication (see Sls. III, 32).

<span id="fn_188"></span>[61:5](sbe18037.htm#fr_189.md) See Sls. XVII, 4.
These two angels are supposed to be present when the soul renders its
account; Rashnû weighs its actions in his golden balance, and Â*s*tâ*d*
assists it (see AV. V, 3, 5),

<span id="fn_189"></span>[61:6](sbe18037.htm#fr_190.md) Reading râî,
instead of lâ,' not.'

<span id="fn_190"></span>[62:1](sbe18037.htm#fr_191.md) One of the five
periods of the day and night, extending from midnight until the stars
disappear in the dawn, or, as some say, until all the fixed stars
disappear except four of the first magnitude (see Bd. XXV, 9, Sls. XIV,
4-6).

<span id="fn_191"></span>[62:2](sbe18037.htm#fr_192.md) Called Ushi-darena
in the Avesta, and identified with some mountain in Sagastân in Bd. XII,
15. It is mentioned in the dedicatory formula of Â*s*tâ*d* (see Sir.
26), and its name is evidently here supposed to mean 'the holder of
dawn,' an appropriate term for a lofty mountain to the eastward.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[62:3](sbe18037.htm#fr_193.md) Both Rashnû and
Â*s*tâ*d* are blessed in the prayers appointed for the Aûshahîn period
of the day.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[62:4](sbe18037.htm#fr_194.md) The 'glory of the
Aryans' is lauded in the Â*s*tâ*d* Yost.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[62:5](sbe18037.htm#fr_195.md) The spirit of air,
or angel Râm, who receives and protects the good soul on its way to the
other world (see Chap XXVIII, 2, 5).

<span id="fn_195"></span>[62:6](sbe18037.htm#fr_196.md) Identified with
Astô-vîdâ*d*, the demon of death,. in Bd. XXVIII, 35, but Pahl. Vend. V,
25, 31 makes him a separate demon, who conveys away the bound soul,
which would identify him with the demon Vîzarêsh of Vend. XIX, 94, Bd.
XXVIII, 18. There is very little doubt, however, that the Pahlavi
translator of Vend. V misunderstood the Avesta, which merely says that
'Astô-vîdhôtu binds him, Vayô conveys him bound,' referring probably to
the good Vâê who receives the parting soul; and Pahl. Vend. V, 31 admits
that this was the opinion of some.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[63:1](sbe18037.htm#fr_197.md) Nothing is here
said about the third sacred cake, but Sls. XVII, 4 states that this is
to be dedicated to the righteous guardian spirit (see Chap. XXVIII, 7).
