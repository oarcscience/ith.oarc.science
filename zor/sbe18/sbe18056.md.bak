### Chapter XLIX.

1\. *As to* the forty-eighth question and reply, that which you ask is
thus: *As to them* who shall buy corn and keep *it* in store until it
shall become dear, *and* shall then sell it at a high price (pavan
girânŏîh), what is the nature of the decision?

2\. The reply is this, that when there is nothing therein on account of
which I *should* so deem <span id="fr_657"></span>[1](#fn_654.md) *it*
otherwise than due to the eating of the requisite amount (a*v*âyi*s*n)
of food for one's self, that which is his controlling impulse
(sa*r*dârîh), and not the teachings of the worthy *and* good, is the
internal instruction which a time of scarcity *has* taught by means of
the occurrences during that time <span id="fr_658"></span>[2](#fn_655.md);
but clamorous worldly profit is want of diligence (akhapârakânîh), for
they would buy to make people distressed, and in order that they may
sell again dearer. 3. Moreover, the store *one* keeps, and keeps as
closed even unto the good as unto the bad--*and* though it be necessary
for a man of the good *and* worthy, and they beg for *some* of the food,
they shall not sell at the price it is worth at that time, on account of
*its* becoming dearer--*one* keeps in store unauthorisedly *and*
grievously sinfully, *and* every calamity *of* those good people they
shall suffer who would not sell it at the price they beg.

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

4\. On account of that non-obtainment of corn, or that unlawfully
heinous sin, and because of dearness of price it is not proper to give
*it* for that non-distribution (an-af*s*ânŏîh) unto *him* himself, or
those under *his* control, or the poor to whom it would be given by
him <span id="fr_659"></span>[1](#fn_656.md); and the distribution
(reshi*s*nŏ) *which* occurs is then retaliative upon him. 5. And if the
corn be spoiled <span id="fr_660"></span>[2](#fn_657.md), through keeping
too long a time in store, *he* is suffering assault from the hungry
*man* (gûr*s*nŏ) who is injured even by that damaging
(bô*d*yôzê*d*îh) <span id="fr_661"></span>[3](#fn_658.md) of the corn; if
through that un-lawful want of preservation (adâri*s*nŏîh) noxious
creatures are associated with the corn, he is overwhelmed also by that
heinous sin; *and*, through the profit of improper diligence *he* is
unworthy.

6\. But if it be necessary for their own people who are under their
control, on account of the fear *of* a time of scarcity, they should buy
at their own suitable time, and should afford protection. 7. Or, because
of the teachings of the good *and* worthy, they should buy corn at a
cheap price from a place where the corn is more than the requirements of
the eaters, *and* they should bring *it* unto there where corn is
scarce, provided (va hatŏ) the good *and* those requiring corn are
sufficient (vasân). 8. So that, while their information of a scarcity of
corn is even

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

from him himself to whom the price would become profit <span
id="fr_662"></span>[1](#fn_659.md), or *is* the persistence of *these* same
teachings of the good--so that it may become more abundant unto them
than unto the bad, even in the time of scarcity *when* it is very much
raised in price <span id="fr_663"></span>[2](#fn_660.md)--they should buy
corn *at* a cheap price during an excess of corn, so that *one* may keep
*it* until the time of a period of scarcity. 9. When *there* occurs a
necessity for it *among* the good he sells *it* at *such* price as *one*
buys it at that time, that is, the market price (ar*g*-î
shat*r*ôîk) <span id="fr_664"></span>[3](#fn_661.md); by that means, in a
season of scarcity, much more is obtained in price, *and* it becomes
more plentiful among the good; then a more invigorating
(pa*d*îkhûînagtar) praise of him is commendable.

10\. And, yet, as regards that which is suitable profit--and also apart
from the eating of corn, *from* anything eatable for the maintenance of
life, *from* medicine and remedies for the healthfulness of life, and
*from* whatever is for the preservation of life--it is allowable *that*
they shall buy *and* shall sell dear <span
id="fr_665"></span>[4](#fn_662.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_654"></span>[174:1](sbe18056.htm#fr_657.md) K35 has a blank
space for this word, but it is given in M14, and also occurs in a
similar phrase in Chap. LIV, 6.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[174:2](sbe18056.htm#fr_658.md) That is, so long
as one does not lay in a store more than sufficient for one's own
requirements, it is only an act of prudence taught by former experience,

<span id="fn_656"></span>[175:1](sbe18056.htm#fr_659.md) That is, corn is
not to be sold to a man who keeps it in store for the purpose of raising
the price, nor to his people, nor is it even to be given to the poor
whom he relieves, so that he may be compelled to support them out of his
own stores, as a penalty.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[175:2](sbe18056.htm#fr_660.md) Reading
tapâhî-aît, as in M14.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[175:3](sbe18056.htm#fr_661.md) Literally
'destroying the consciousness,' or 'injuring the existence.'
Bô*d*yôzê*d* is a technical name for sins whereby animals are
ill-treated, or useful property injured (see Sls. II, 39).

<span id="fn_659"></span>[176:1](sbe18056.htm#fr_662.md) And, therefore,
likely to be correct, as it is given in opposition to his own interest.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[176:2](sbe18056.htm#fr_663.md) M14 has 'begged at
a price,' by inserting a stroke.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[176:3](sbe18056.htm#fr_664.md) Without holding it
back for an exorbitant rise in prices.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[176:4](sbe18056.htm#fr_665.md) That is, there is
no harm in speculating upon prices, except in the case of necessaries of
life.
