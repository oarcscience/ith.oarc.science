<p>1. <I>As to</I> the fifty-second question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: <I>If</I> people of the good religion, in <I>their</I> country <I>or</I> out of <I>their</I> country, shall buy <I>and</I> sell with those of a different religion as regards cattle, <I>or</I> shall lay hold of traders (van&icirc;kgar&acirc;n) and shall sell to them, what is then the decision about it? 2. When <I>those of</I> the good religion shall not buy, as they have not come <I>up to</I> the price, but <I>the orthodox dealers</I> shall sell to traders <I>and</I> those of a different religion, what is then the decision about it? 3. <I>And</I> about him, of whom the means of existence (z&icirc;vi<I>s</I>n&#335; mindavam) are such, what is then the decision?</p>  
<p>4. The reply is this, that it would be very grievously sinful, and it would be an evil occupation to transact such business through the influence of opportunity, <I>and</I> to seek profit unauthorisedly in that manner. 5. But if <I>it be</I> the means of existence <I>of</I> those of the good religion <I>of</I> whom <I>you have</I> written, and <I>they</I> are not able to seek <I>it</I> in any other business <I>and</I> proper occupation which <I>would be</I> a less sinful meant of existence, complete&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_677"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> purchasers who <I>have</I> acquired</p>

So it is possible, when they shall sell cattle for slaughter <I>and</I> foreign eating, many cattle--amounting even to a diminution of the maintenance of Ir&acirc;n--are more wretched than a righteous man forced to kill <I>them</I> through a living becoming unobtainable <I>and</I> the fear of death.</p>
