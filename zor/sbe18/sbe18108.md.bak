### CHAPTER VII.

1\. And *as to* that which is written <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[4](#fn_1178.md), that 'in the teaching of Afarg *it*
is thus declared, that "for every single person, at the least <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[5](#fn_1179.md), one cup of water *and* 

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

one cup of bull's urine, which are well alike (vêhmâl) <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[1](#fn_1180.md), are requisite;" *and in* the same
manner it is said in the teaching of Mê*d*yôk-mâh, that "the water and
bull's urine, when it is possible, are all to be thoroughly consecrated;
when not--and, at the lowest, one cup of water and one cup of bull's
urine, which are well alike, for every single person--*they* are to be
set down *in* that place, and are afterwards to be mingled
together <span id="fr_1185"></span>[2](#fn_1181.md)." 2. And since two
teachings have so stated, are *we* to perform the operation more
preservatively <span id="fr_1186"></span>[3](#fn_1182.md) and according to
a more correct opinion than this?'

3\. Also, 'a correct apportionment is not understood by us, and clear
reasons *have* not come to *our* knowledge that a less measure of the
thing is proper.' <span id="fr_1187"></span>[4](#fn_1183.md). But I well
imagine (hû-minam) this. is not the operation of the *purifying* cup
(tâ*s*tîkŏ), where a less thing is not proper, because the information
with which they have existed--owing to that information of theirs, of
which a former high-priest and deliberator *was* the communicator--is
that which *was* heard by me, that there are *some* who, for the sake of
diminishing the measure *of* water *and* bull's urine, speak of this
apportionment thus: 'Vî*k*ithr*ek*i*d*', in everything the operation

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

which accomplishes this, that is, when *there is* as much as is
discernible from his body <span id="fr_1188"></span>[1](#fn_1184.md), is
proper.' 5. And the saying is not perceived by me *as* a correct
apportioning, because the judgment of the greatly-learned leader of
those of the good religion, the glorified Yûdân-Yim <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[2](#fn_1185.md), and of other deliberators, the
opinion of good thinkers, was thus, that that saying is spoken about
that of which the measure is not declared as the least by the
high-priests' teaching of revelation. 6. Finally, when it is really of
the same origin *and* suitable, then less than the least of that, of
which the measure is declared as the least, is not proper, if, owing to
much evidence in the teaching which has mentioned *it* as suitable, *it
be* more of a blessing, and the operation performed thereby *be* more
legitimate; because that teaching is for confessing that the statements
of high-priests are most evidence of the practice.

7\. This is that which is equally perpetual: it is very important *for*
the purifiers to keep the intellect of life in operation, *and for* the
good to become mentally a powerful giver of aid to them; and now, too, a
purifier is ordered to keep in use his own most universal equal measure.
8. That which is perceived by me, and *has* come to my knowledge, more
particularly when washed by myself, is the keeping in use an equal
measure <span id="fr_1190"></span>[3](#fn_1186.md). 9. And even if there be
a purifier who does not completely keep in use the

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

consecrated water and bull's urine, still then *it* is not worse than
when it does not really arise *from* the same origin <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1](#fn_1187.md), and its religious rite also does not
take place.

10\. Also the words of both the solemnization of the Vendidâ*d* and the
recitation of the Avesta are likewise to be uttered by him;
because <span id="fr_1192"></span>[2](#fn_1188.md) 'Zaratû*s*t enquired of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* *about* it thus: "How *shall* I purify <span
id="fr_1193"></span>[3](#fn_1189.md) where he does not attain unto the
Airy*e*mâ <span id="fr_1194"></span>[4](#fn_1190.md)--there are *some* who
say *where* everything is anusô ('discontented') <span
id="fr_1195"></span>[5](#fn_1191.md)? 11. How as to the fire, how as to the
water, how as to the earth, how as to animals, how as to plants, how as
to the righteous man, how as to the righteous woman, how as to the
stars, how as to the moon, how as to the sun, how as to the endless
light, how as to the independent light <span
id="fr_1196"></span>[6](#fn_1192.md), how as to all the prosperity, created
by

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_1197"></span>[1](#fn_1193.md), which is a
manifestation of righteousness?" 12. And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke to him
thus: "Thou shalt chant the purification *liturgy*, O Zaratû*s*t!--that
is, fully solemnize a Vendidâ*d* *service*--then he becomes purified,
&c.,"' as mentioned by me *above* <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[2](#fn_1194.md). 13. Where they do not make *them*
solemnize a Vendidâ*d* so that they keep in operation that which is
written of it as a rite, this does not drive *pollution* from any *one*;
and then, too, they should abandon the commands of a decree of leaders
who are not over *them* <span id="fr_1199"></span>[3](#fn_1195.md).

14\. Keep the Bareshnûm *ceremony* <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[4](#fn_1196.md) in operation, so that the consecrated
water and bull's urine are in the proportion *which* is taught by the
high-priests of the religion, unless a scarcity occurs as regards these.
15. Then *together* with it, also, this is *to be observed*, that what
is mentioned in two teachings is certainly more correct; afterwards,
too, where a possibility for it is not obtained by them, *there* is
*what* is mentioned as suitable by one teaching, and I do not decide
*that it* is not an expediency.

16\. And *as to* that, also, *which* is written concerning the three
hundred pebbles <span id="fr_1201"></span>[5](#fn_1197.md) that, sprinkled

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

in *ceremonial* ablution (pâ*d*yâ*v*ŏ), are cast into (va*l*) the bull's
urine and water, that is taught even *in* the same manner; the *inward*
prayer (vâ*g*ŏ) <span id="fr_1202"></span>[1](#fn_1198.md), even for when
*one* does not cast *them*, is in the existing teaching, which is
proper. 17. Then, too, on account of the cheapness <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[2](#fn_1199.md) and harmlessness of the pebbles the
purifiers are less curtailing as to them, *and* to drink the thing so is
well-curative in performance. 18. In the existing teaching of imperfect
purifiers it should be very advantageous to maintain it as easy;
moreover, it is not said of it *that it* is not suitable, and in the
teaching of Afarg it is said that it is proper.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[304:1](sbe18107.htm#fr_1179.md) In Vend. IX,
48-117 the washings of the several parts of the body are mentioned only
once, which is 'the first computation' here mentioned.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[304:2](sbe18107.htm#fr_1180.md) Reading pêsmâl,
as equivalent to the pê*s*mâl or pê*s*îmal previously used; but the word
can also be read pasîmal, 'after deponent,' which would be inconsistent
with the context. The two terms are very liable to be confounded in
writing Pahlavi, and in Ep. II, ii, 6 they are again written alike,
though put in opposition to each other. The 'prior deponent' is Afarg.

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[304:3](sbe18107.htm#fr_1181.md) That is, 'about
this one time,' as J has it.

<span id="fn_1178"></span>[304:4](sbe18108.htm#fr_1182.md) In the epistle
to which he is replying.

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[304:5](sbe18108.htm#fr_1183.md) The words pavan
kâmîstîh, both here and in §§ 5, 6, would be better translated as 'a
desideratum, or desired quantity;' but in <span id="page_305">p.
305</span> Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, *c* the phrase is pavan kamistîh, which
can mean only 'at the minimum, or least.'

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[305:1](sbe18108.htm#fr_1184.md) In Pahl. Vend.
IX, 132, *c*, where this statement occurs, the first letter of this word
is omitted, which converts it into shumâr, 'alike: Either word may be
correct, but vêh-mâl occurs twice in this section.

<span id="fn_1181"></span>[305:2](sbe18108.htm#fr_1185.md) This statement
of Mê*d*yôk-mâh seems no longer extant in the Pahlavi Vendidâ*d*.

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[305:3](sbe18108.htm#fr_1186.md) That is, in a
way more delivering from pollution and sin.

<span id="fn_1183"></span>[305:4](sbe18108.htm#fr_1187.md) This word, which
probably means 'in whatever is varied,' was <span id="page_306">p.
306</span> evidently the beginning of an Avesta phrase whose Pahlavi
translation concludes the sentence. The phrase does not appear to be
extant elsewhere.

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[306:1](sbe18108.htm#fr_1188.md) That is, just
sufficient to wet the body.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[306:2](sbe18108.htm#fr_1189.md) His father (see
Chap. III, 10).

<span id="fn_1186"></span>[306:3](sbe18108.htm#fr_1190.md) That is, the two
liquids should he provided in equal quantities, <span id="page_307">p.
307</span> which differs from the present practice, as stated in the
Persian Rivâyats; thus, M10, fol. 104 a, mentions 3¼ mans of water and
1¼ man of bull's urine as suitable quantities to be provided. This
section is omitted in J, probably by mistake.

<span id="fn_1187"></span>[307:1](sbe18108.htm#fr_1191.md) Apparently
deprecating the use of mingled liquids derived from various sources.

<span id="fn_1188"></span>[307:2](sbe18108.htm#fr_1192.md) The passage
quoted here is from Pahl. Vend. XI, 1-6, with a few variations.

<span id="fn_1189"></span>[307:3](sbe18108.htm#fr_1193.md) Pahl. Vend.
inserts 'as to the abode.'

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[307:4](sbe18108.htm#fr_1194.md) The Airy*e*mâ
(written Airyêmê in the MSS.) is Yas. LIII, which commences with the
words 'â airy*e*mâ ishyô,' and is the last of the Gâtha spells
mentioned, in Vend. X, 22, as having to be recited four times in order
to exorcise the fiend. The meaning of the question in the text,
therefore, is: how is the purification to be effected when all the
spells are not recited?

<span id="fn_1191"></span>[307:5](sbe18108.htm#fr_1195.md) Referring to
Vend. IX, 161--163 (see Chap. IV, 3).

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[307:6](sbe18108.htm#fr_1196.md) This clause is
omitted in Pahl. Vend., being merely a repetition of the preceding one,
the Av. anaghra rao*ka*u being first translated by asarag rôshanŏîh, and
then partially transliterated by <span id="page_308">p. 308</span>
anagrag rŏshanŏ. As sar means 'head, end' in Pahlavi (hardly ever
'beginning'), the only meaning common to the two terms asarag and
anagrag seems to be 'without a head or superior, independent,' that is,
in this case, independent of the light of other luminaries.

<span id="fn_1193"></span>[308:1](sbe18108.htm#fr_1197.md) K35 has
'righteousness, created by Aûha*r*ma*zd*,' but this is evidently a
mistake, as 'righteousness' does not translate the original Av. vohû.

<span id="fn_1194"></span>[308:2](sbe18108.htm#fr_1198.md) That is, as to
the fire, &c. mentioned in § 11.

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[308:3](sbe18108.htm#fr_1199.md) Referring to the
heretical decree about which he is writing.

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[308:4](sbe18108.htm#fr_1200.md) See App. IV.

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[308:5](sbe18108.htm#fr_1201.md) See also Ep. II,
iii, 12. The word generally used in these <span id="page_309">p.
309</span> epistles is sang, 'stone,' but Chap. IX, 6 has sagî*k*akŏ,
and Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, *c* mentions sag*k*ak, 'a pebble,' as being
cast into (dên) the consecrated water and bull's urine, without
specifying any number. The practice appears not to be mentioned in the
Persian Rivâyats, and seems now obsolete; the addition of a small
quantity of the ashes of the sacred fire to the bull's urine, which is
tasted at the beginning of the rite, is, however, mentioned in the
Rivâyats.

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[309:1](sbe18108.htm#fr_1202.md) See Dd. LXXIX,
2. The prayer or grace has to be taken inwardly, that is, murmured,
before the drinking mentioned in § 17. According to this text provision
seems to have been made for not using the pebbles, by means of a special
prayer.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[309:2](sbe18108.htm#fr_1203.md) Or 'value,' as
ar*g*ânîh means both.
