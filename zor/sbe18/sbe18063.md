### CHAPTER LVI.

1\. *As to* the fifty-fifth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: What is this adopted-sonship *and* guardianship of the family, and
what does it become; *in* what manner is it necessary to appoint *it*,
whence is it necessary to provide food and clothing for it, and how is
it necessary to be *for* it?

2\. The reply is this, that the adopted-sonship is thus:--It is
requisite whenever a man of the good religion is passing *away*, while
*he is* a complete ruler of a numerous household <span
id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_691.md), who has no wife and child that may be
privileged <span id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_692.md) and acknowledged, *nor*
associating brother, *nor* son by adoption, and his property is sixty
stîrs <span id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_693.md) of income. 3. The
controlling (khû*d*âyînag) of the property is to be publicly provided
*out* of the kindred of the deceased, and is called the adopted-sonship;
and he is to be appointed to it who is the nearest of the same lineage
(min ham-nâfân), who *will* manage *and* keep the property united in its
entirety.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

4\. The guardianship of a family is that when a guardian *has* to be
appointed in that manner over the family of a man whose wife <span
id="fr_697"></span>[1](#fn_694.md), or daughter, or infant son is not fit
for their own guardianship, so it is necessary to appoint *some one*. 5.
And it is necessary to appoint the adopted son *and* the family,
guardianship at *such* time as may be convenient to them; and when the
man passes *away* as *I have* written it is necessary to appoint at such
period as *I have* written, and to neglect it temporarily, even the
length of a year, would not be authorised.

6\. *Fit* for adoption is a grown-up sister who is not adopted in
another family <span id="fr_698"></span>[2](#fn_695.md), then a brother's
daughter, then a brother's son, *and* then the other nearest relatives.
7. *Fit* for the family guardianship is first the father of the serving
*wife* (*k*agar) <span id="fr_699"></span>[3](#fn_696.md), then a brother,
then a daughter, and then the other nearest relations; among brothers he
who is the eldest (mas) among *them* is the fittest.

8\. The food *and* clothing of a wife that may be privileged--who is the
house-mistress of the family, and is one kind of adopted son--*of* a
living infant son till he becomes grown up, *and of* a daughter of the
family while she is in the guardianship of the family guardians <span
id="fr_700"></span>[4](#fn_697.md), are out of the property of the family
so long as it exists for the purpose.

9\. *It has* become the custom *that* the lapfuls *and* 

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

armfuls <span id="fr_701"></span>[1](#fn_698.md) of the family guardian are
every month four stîrs of, it may be, sixteen <span
id="fr_702"></span>[2](#fn_699.md), which is the disbursement
(andâ*z*i*s*nŏ), for food, clothing, medicine, *and* shelter, out of the
income (bar), or out of the capital (bûn), of the property which remains
in the family, by a perfect <span id="fr_703"></span>[3](#fn_700.md) wife
when she is capable--such as the former house-mistress--so as want of
nourishment (atafdâ*d*ŏ) may not come nakedly and unlawfully upon them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_691"></span>[188:1](sbe18063.htm#fr_694.md) Reading vad marak
khân shah bundakŏ, but the phrase can also be read vad malkâân shah
bandakŏ, 'while he is a servant of the king of kings (that is, a subject
of the Iranian sovereign),' which is evidently the reading adopted by
M14 in Chap. LVII, 2, where it substitutes the Huz. synonym malkâ for
shah, but here the word shah is uncertain. This ambiguous phrase can
also be read vad mark-âhangihâ bundakŏ, 'while the agonies of death are
complete.'

<span id="fn_692"></span>[188:2](sbe18063.htm#fr_695.md) See Chap. LIV, 9.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[188:3](sbe18063.htm#fr_696.md) About 84 rûpîs
(see Chap. LII, 1 n); but the actual value of such an income depends
upon the value of silver at that time, or, in other words, upon the
prices of the necessaries of life.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[189:1](sbe18063.htm#fr_697.md) Because she is not
a privileged wife, but a serving one (see Chap. LIV, 9), as appears from
§ 7.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[189:2](sbe18063.htm#fr_698.md) A woman or child
cannot be adopted by more than one family (see Chap. LVII, 3). The case
under consideration is that mentioned in § 2, when the deceased leaves
no wife, child, or brother.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[189:3](sbe18063.htm#fr_699.md) Referring to the
case assumed in § 4.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[189:4](sbe18063.htm#fr_700.md) That is, till she
is married.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[190:1](sbe18063.htm#fr_701.md) That is, an ample
remuneration (see Chap. LIV, 10).

<span id="fn_699"></span>[190:2](sbe18063.htm#fr_702.md) So the sentence
may be literally translated, but it is not quite certain that this is
the meaning intended, as the language used is very involved. This would
imply that the family guardian is entitled to one-fourth of the family
expenditure.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[190:3](sbe18063.htm#fr_703.md) It is doubtful
what noun is to be connected with the adjective pûr; perhaps we should
read 'full disbursement' in the foregoing part of the sentence, and omit
the word 'perfect' here.
