### CHAPTER LXVIII.

1\. *As to* the sixty-seventh question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: What is this which, when the sun and moon *have* both come up,
is something <span id="fr_781"></span>[4](#fn_778)

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

come, *and* comes on as *it were* anew when it (the moon) becomes new,
*and* men want the thing to go down from the place *where it* is
becoming apparent? 2. When it *has* been several times, what is then the
thing *which* comes up *and* exists, and how is its motion by night and
day?

3\. The reply is this, that the sun and moon are always seen <span
id="fr_782"></span>[1](#fn_779) there where they stand, and they exist
for men and the creatures. 4. The sun is swifter-moving <span
id="fr_783"></span>[2](#fn_780) than the moon, *and* every day becomes a
little in advance; at the new moon the sun is shining, and the moon
owing to diminution backwards, on account of the slenderness of the moon
by much travelling <span id="fr_784"></span>[3](#fn_781), and on account
of the brilliance of the sun, is not apparent. 5. As the sun goes down a
light which is not very apparent is the moon, and not *having* gone down
the moon is seen <span id="fr_785"></span>[4](#fn_782); and each day the
moon increases, comes up more behind the sun, *and* goes down more
behind, *and* is, therefore, more seen. 6. When increased to the utmost,
which is approaching a likeness of the sun, it comes spherical
(aspiharakŏ), and is seen the whole night; to diminish anew it comes
back to the companionship of the sun, and goes into the splendour of the
sun.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_778"></span>[210:4](sbe18075.htm#fr_781) The only probable
reading for this word is mindavam, 'a thing;' it occurs three times in
this question, but is a very vague term for the phases of the moon,
probably referring to a supposed body covering the dark part of the
moon's disc.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[211:1](sbe18075.htm#fr_782) The MSS. have
astî-hênd, 'have remained,' instead of khadîtunî-hênd, 'are seen;' but
the difference between these words in Pahlavi letters is merely a medial
stroke.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[211:2](sbe18075.htm#fr_783) Apparently so, as
the moon rises and sets about 48 minutes later every day, on the
average.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[211:3](sbe18075.htm#fr_784) A very
anthropomorphic mode of accounting for the waning of the moon into a
slender crescent.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[211:4](sbe18075.htm#fr_785) Most Orientals
consider the day of the new moon to be that in the evening of which it
is first possible to see the moon; this is usually the first, but
sometimes the second, day after the actual change of the moon according
to European ideas.
