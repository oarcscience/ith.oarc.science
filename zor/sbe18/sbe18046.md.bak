### CHAPTER XXXIX.

1\. *As to* the thirty-eighth question and reply, that which you ask is
thus What are the reason and cause of tying *on* the *sacred
thread*-girdle (kûstîkŏ) <span id="fr_453"></span>[1](#fn_451.md) which,
when they shall tie *it* on is said *to be* so greatly valuable, and
when they shall not tie *it* the sin is so grievous?

2\. The reply is this, that the all-good, most spiritual of spirits, and
most ruling of rulers is the creator, and there is no need of troubles
for men of the poor as to any wealth *or* anything, for all are his own.
3. And through his will *as* ruler, and all-powerful, he demands this of
men, to remain properly

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

skirted <span id="fr_454"></span>[1](#fn_452.md) as a true servant not even
bound--which is due to that service, and also the indication of a
servant--as is seen *and* clearly declared in the ever-fixed
(hamâî-dâ*d*ŏ) religion and belief.

4\. Formerly men paid homage through the will and worship, as *it were*
more effectually, more essentially, *and* more suitably for the
discreet; and every day *spent* in worship offered and homage paid they
account as *of* the greatest use, particularly for observing the world,
and understanding *its* character. 5. And *as to him* of whose offering
of homage no worldly advantage whatever is apparent--as fruit is
apparent from trees, flavour from foods, fragrance from aromatic herbs,
tint (bâm) from colours, the good quality of spears from the forest,
health from the patient (môlvarakân), and decision from words--but,
audibly speaking, *his* head is lowered in sign of humility--as though
the head, which is uppermost in the body and in the most pre-eminent
*position*, and is lowered as far even as the sole of the foot, which is
lowermost in the body, salutes <span id="fr_455"></span>[2](#fn_453.md)
*and* is placed on the ground in thought about worship *and* desire of
paying homage--and the appearance which exists as regards himself
through *that* lowliest (kîhastŏ) servitude is *in accordance* with that
which is apparent from trees, food, and the many other worldly
advantages *before* recited--whoever *has* offered homage and such
advantageous (vê*s*i*s*nakŏ) appearance

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

is manifest--even then that sign of humility *and* servitude is *what*
great multitudes consider the offering of homage of a man more essential
for hypocrisy (shêdŏ) <span id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_454.md).

6\. *But* owing to that which *happens* when they plant a tree in the
name of a sacred being <span id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_455.md) and eat the
produce, and practise other worldly labour of worldly advantage, owing
also to work of this kind through the doing of which they preserve all
the growing *crops* of the whole world, and through tillage and
multitudinous cultivated plots (khûstakîhâ) *it* is manifest that they
should meditate inwardly (dên mînŏyên) <span
id="fr_458"></span>[3](#fn_456.md). 7. A token *and* sign of worship is
*of* great use, and a great assistance (ban*g*i*s*nŏ) therein is this
belt (band), which is called the Kûstîk, that is tied on the middle of
the body.

8\. The reasons of the assistance are numerous; and its first assistance
is this, that *as to* him who--*as* a worshipper of the sacred beings,
owing to the undeceitful (akadbâ) religion whose indication is
sagaciously propitiating with the *purifying* cup <span
id="fr_459"></span>[4](#fn_457.md)--wears upon the body that spiritual,
customary, and

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

doctrinal indication of the sacred beings with a wisdom which is truly
religion, *his* steadfastness and religious service of the sacred beings
are audibly spoken thereby; even for the religious *it* is commanded,
because *it* is an assisting motive of beneficial high-priests and
such-like submitters *to* the commands of the religion of the sacred
beings.

9\. One is this, that, as the lowliest servant and greatest lord are
steadily agreed, and *it is* beneficial <span
id="fr_460"></span>[1](#fn_458) when they (the servants.md) wear a belt
upon the body *as* a sign of service--because *it* is not the custom to
grant that little at any time without guardianship--the lapse of which
service is also not a beneficial lapse, then those unbound are without a
token of the lord's service.

10\. One is this, that it is commanded in revelation to keep thought,
word, and deed confined from sin by a belt, and just like a servant; for
the sake of confinement of sins from purity of thought, whose dwelling
is the heart, *one* is to wear the same belt, which is the token of a
servant, *on* the middle of the body and before the heart; and the
periodical (hangâmîkânŏ) sight of the token and sign of confined sins,
and of the constant reminder for *one's* own mind, is the necessity of
wearing *it* as a belt which is very restraining from the sin in
thought, word, and deed that is manifest even in experience; which
wearing of the same belt is as a reason and cause of much remembrance of
much sin, that in the same way is therefore a restraint of it.

II\. One is this, that the ancients acquainted with religion *have*
communicated these tidings (srôbŏ)

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

unto our ancestors *and* to us:--'When the destroyer came upon the
creatures, the demons and witches (parîkŏ) especially rushed up in the
earth and atmosphere, and even to *just* below the position of the
stars; and they saw multitudes of luminaries, and also the barricade
*and* rampart <span id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_459.md) of the glory of the
religion, and the girdle (parvand) <span id="fr_462"></span>[2](#fn_460.md)
of the wishes *and* good works of all, when <span
id="fr_463"></span>[3](#fn_461.md) it is arrayed like a brilliant
*thread*-girdle (kûstîk), and all its luminaries are girded (parvastŏ)
by the girdle as the girdle of the omniscient wisdom has girded the
all-intelligent angels.' 12. That great glory of the pure religion,
solving doubts, became as beautiful and far-adorning as is stated in the
liturgy (mânsar) thus: 'The star-studded girdle (ayî*v*yahângânŏ) of the
spirit-fashioned, good religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers <span
id="fr_464"></span>[4](#fn_462.md).' 13. All the demons and fiends *were*
terrified by the great glory of the religion, *and it is* said that, by
the recital, practice, *and* promulgation of the whole routine of the
enlightened religion, all those fiends are subdued, *and* the renovation
*of the universe* is produced by the will of the patron spirits (ahvân).
14. Likewise, on account of that terror, none of the demons and fiends,
who are the mightiest of the demons, rushed upon the creatures of that
uppermost third *of the sky* <span id="fr_465"></span>[5](#fn_463.md), who
are in purity and indestructibility.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 15. And it (the
girdle) is commanded in revelation for men, more particularly for
upholders of the religion <span id="fr_466"></span>[1](#fn_464.md), *to be*
within the middle third *and* near to the uppermost third of the
body <span id="fr_467"></span>[2](#fn_465.md).

16\. *One is* this, that Yim the splendid, *son* of Vîvangha <span
id="fr_468"></span>[3](#fn_466.md), who in *his* worldly career was most
prosperous in worldly affairs, a keeper away of all agitations of
temper <span id="fr_469"></span>[4](#fn_467.md) *and* all death, *and* a
provider of freedom from decay *and* exemption from death, when he was
deceived by the fiend *was* thereby made eager for supreme sovereignty
instead of the service of Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 17. And about his
administration (dâ*d*ârîh) of the creatures *it* is said he himself
became cut <span id="fr_470"></span>[5](#fn_468.md) away from radiant glory
by that fiendishness <span id="fr_471"></span>[6](#fn_469.md), and their
cause of wandering

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (garîni*s*nŏ) is
the demon, and mankind perishes in that wandering from plain and
hill-side <span id="fr_472"></span>[1](#fn_470.md). 18. And his pardon
originated from the fully-persistent creator; therefore he spoke *and*
gave advice unto his successors as to the retribution of those *who*
shall abandon the service of the creator; and therein is explained about
the fortress of the angels <span id="fr_473"></span>[2](#fn_471.md), with
the many proper actions which are the strength of the fortress, and
about the proportional way it is strengthened when a belt worn on the
waist is ordered for men *by* him--the fully glorious ruler who was lord
of the world, and also in gloriousness well-betokening the good
creation--*and* they <span id="fr_474"></span>[3](#fn_472.md) likewise
order *it*.

19\. One is this, that just as through that reason <span
id="fr_475"></span>[4](#fn_473.md), which is an appointment
(pa*d*ŏ-dahi*s*nŏ) that the sacred beings decreed, the *sacred
thread*-girdle *was* worn even before the coming of Zaratû*s*t the
Spîtamân, *so* after *the coming of* that messenger (vakh*s*var) of the
sacred beings, the righteous Zaratû*s*t--who enjoined the commands of
the good spirits *and* the exposition of the religion, with discourse
praising the sacred beings and scriptures (a*v*îstâkŏ) about
steadfastness in the good religion--the same religious girdle is put on,
with a religious formula <span id="fr_476"></span>[5](#fn_474.md), around

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

the body, over the garment of Vohûman <span
id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_475.md). 20. Because the same intimation,
relative to girding (parvandi*s*nîk) is wisdom for which the race of the
religion is so justly famed that innumerable people, with the same
customs *and* equally proper girding, wear the *sacred thread*-girdle,
the ceremonial belt of the religion *and* indication of the creator, on
the middle of the body; *and* it becomes more destructive of the power
of destruction <span id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_476.md), more obstructive
of the way to sin, and more contesting (kastaktar) the will of the
demons.

21\. One is this, that *he* is unwise that *has* not worn *it* when that
*man has* arrived in whose law no belting and no girdling <span
id="fr_479"></span>[3](#fn_477.md) are ordered, and more perplexing and
more grievous destruction is so manifested at the time, that *it* is
similar evidence to that exposition of revelation, the purport (aêvâ*z*)
of *whose* question *and* reply is spoken thus <span
id="fr_480"></span>[4](#fn_478.md):--'"O creator! in whom is the
manifestation of secretly-progressing destruction, that is, in whom is
its progress <span id="fr_481"></span>[5](#fn_479.md)?" And Aûha*r*ma*zd*
spoke thus: "In him who is the guide of a vile religion; whoever it is
who puts on a girdle

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

at most thrice (3-tûmak) in a year <span
id="fr_482"></span>[1](#fn_480.md), that is, he does not wear a *sacred*
shirt and *thread*-girdle, and his law also is this, that it is not
necessary to wear *them*"'--and when the law of no belting is so
grievous that, when that law shall be accepted, it is observed *that*
destruction is strengthened.

22\. The same belt, kept on after the command of Yim, *was* the first
token as regards which an annihilator of destruction is mentioned *and*
established by law; *and on* both occasions <span
id="fr_483"></span>[2](#fn_481.md) destruction is more grievously manifest.
23. That which is more particularly important is such as the destroyer
of destruction, Yim the splendid, advised, which the high-priest of the
good, Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân, mentioned thus:--'The *sacred
thread*-girdle is as a sign of the service of the sacred beings, a token
of sin ended, and a presage of beneficence; *and one is* to put *it* on
*and* to gird *it*, in the neighbourhood of the heart and *on* the
middle of the body, with the religious formula accompanying the glorious
scripture.' 24. That is also betokened by *its* equally-dividing
(hambûr) position and determining fashion; for, as a wise man becomes a
discriminator between benefit *and* injury, between good and evil, so
also the place of the *sacred thread*-girdle is between below and above.
25. With a low *sacred* girdle there is a passage for one's want of
openness (avîshô*d*anŏ) and secret ruin, and also a shutting up <span
id="fr_484"></span>[3](#fn_482.md) of life; with a high *sacred* 

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

girdle there is a way *for* thought, word, and deed, and no confinement
(agîri*s*nŏkârîh) of life; and tying the *sacred* girdle with a
religious rite (hamdînŏ) is like a glory amid the glories *of* the
angels, for it is itself through the aid of the patron spirit (ahvô).
26. And from the heart, which is the place of thought and dwelling of
life, on the upper side (lâlâîh) are the eye, ear, tongue, *and* brain,
which are the dwellings of sight, hearing, speech, understanding, and
intellect; and on its lower side (frô*d*îh) <span
id="fr_485"></span>[1](#fn_483.md) is the abode of a father's
generativeness.

27\. When this *sacred thread*-girdle, whose token, sign, and presage
are such <span id="fr_486"></span>[2](#fn_484.md), is tied, it is girded on
with this glorious rite <span id="fr_487"></span>[3](#fn_485.md) of the
glorious ones, the custom of the learned, the command of rulers, and the
decree of apostles.

28\. That secretly-progressing destruction <span
id="fr_488"></span>[4](#fn_486.md), which *arises* from the fiend of
insubordination (asa*r*dârîh) <span id="fr_489"></span>[5](#fn_487.md) who
*was* much afraid of Yim, *and* which is averse to the labour of men
*and* the service of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, is a demon and irreligious
(dû*s*-dînô), who is full of fear of the girdles (parvandîhâ) of the
glory of

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

religion, *with* which both angels *and* also worldlings *have* become
belted *and* diligent.

29\. Then, because the glory for this belt of ours, which is called the
Kûstîk and is worn on the middle of the body, remains unreleased
(a*v*î-vûkht) from the angels, who are givers of glory, *and from* men
who are glorious--which is explained as a similitude *and* sample of
fortunes (bâharakŏîhâ) among worldlings, even those *who are* actually
primitive creatures likewise <span id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_488.md)--it
*has*, therefore, seemed comely and desirable. 30. And their heart,
will, knowledge, and purpose are as much for it as that which is
perceptible where, even apart from those of the good religion who shall
tie the *sacred thread*-girdle with the scripture formula, *some* of the
faiths of all countries, except those who are unbelted, possess the
religious custom <span id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_489.md). 31. Also outside
the seat of the existence of faith <span id="fr_492"></span>[3](#fn_490.md)
all men have the waist, or the palms of the hands <span
id="fr_493"></span>[4](#fn_491.md), or similar joints for a girdle
(kûstîkŏ); *and* it is deemed comely, desirable, and convenient for work
to wear *it*. 32. And *it* is manifestly the lot (dakŏ) of the
thoroughly-praising one whose own desire is truth and the enjoyment of
welfare, *it is* a token of the service of the sacred beings, and a sign
of walking *in* the commands of religion,

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

which they shall tie on account of the superior beings (pâshûmân) with
the proper formula, more particularly *with* that which *one* utters
when *there is* reliance *upon* the scripture itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_451"></span>[122:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_453.md) The Kûstîk (Pers.
kustî) consists of a string, about the size of a stay-lace, which is
first passed twice round the waist very loosely, over the sacred shirt
(see Chap. XL, 2), and tied in front with a loose double knot
(right-handed and left-handed), and the long ends are then passed a
third time round the waist and tied again behind with a similar double
knot. This string contains six strands, each consisting of twelve very
fine, white, woollen threads twisted together, or seventy-two threads in
all. Near each end the six strands are braided together, instead of
being twisted, and for the last inch they are braided into three
separate string-ends of two strands each; these string-ends, therefore,
contain twenty-four threads each, and form a kind of fringed end to the
string. This fringe is a sort of remembrancer, as its six strands are
supposed to symbolize the six Gâhanbârs or season-festivals, the twelve
threads in each strand symbolize the twelve months, the twenty-four
threads in each string-end symbolize the twenty-four kar*d*aks or
sections of the Vispara*d*, and the seventy-two threads in the whole
string symbolize the seventy-two his or chapters of the Yasna. The
girdle has to be re-tied every time the hands have been washed, which,
in order to comply with the ceremonial laws, occurs many times in the
day; and each time it has to be done with ceremony and a particular
formula of prayer (see § 27).

<span id="fn_452"></span>[123:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_454.md) That is, fully
clad, as going about uncovered is a sin (see Chap. XL, 4). On occasions
of ceremony, and for the purpose of showing extraordinary respect, the
Parsis wear an extra long-skirted robe.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[123:2](sbe18046.htm#fr_455.md) Reading
d*r*û*d*ŏê*d*, but the orthography is unusual and the word, therefore,
uncertain.

<span id="fn_454"></span>[124:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_456.md) The author is here
adopting his most involved style of writing, which, in the original
Pahlavi, is often hardly intelligible, and particularly apt to be
misunderstood; but the object of this section seems to be to deprecate
the Muhammadan practice of frequent prostrations during prayer, which
are in marked contrast to the slight obeisances made by the Parsis.

<span id="fn_455"></span>[124:2](sbe18046.htm#fr_457.md) Whether yêdatô
means 'an angel,' or 'God,' is here uncertain.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[124:3](sbe18046.htm#fr_458.md) The argument is
that the growth of plants is so obviously occasioned by some unseen
power that it naturally leads to meditation, and then to prayer.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[124:4](sbe18046.htm#fr_459.md) The words
dâni*s*nîkŏ levatman-tâ*s*tîk-shnâyîn seem to refer to the Bareshnûm
ceremony of purification, described in Vend. IX, 1-145 (see App. IV),
which is a rite eminently characteristic of Ma*zd*a-worship.

<span id="fn_458"></span>[125:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_460.md) Reading spenâk,
but it may be sa*z*ŏâk, 'seemly.'

<span id="fn_459"></span>[126:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_461.md) See Chap. XXXVII,
47.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[126:2](sbe18046.htm#fr_462.md) It is not certain
that parvand signifies 'a girdle,' or that parvastanŏ means 'to gird,'
but they seem to be used in that sense here. The former word translates
Av. paurvanîm, 'leading the Pleiades' (Haug's Essays, p. 182), in Yas.
IX, 81, an epithet applied to the belt of Orion.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[126:3](sbe18046.htm#fr_463.md) M14 has 'which.'

<span id="fn_462"></span>[126:4](sbe18046.htm#fr_464.md) Quoted from Pahl.
Yas. IX, 81 (see Chap. XXXVII, 48).

<span id="fn_463"></span>[126:5](sbe18046.htm#fr_465.md) See Chap. XXXVII,
24-27.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[127:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_466.md) M14 continues as
follows:--'through that girdle (parvand) of the religion, *and* a
*thread*-girdle (kûstîkŏ), from the region of the world and religious
*in character*, is put on within the middle third,' &c.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[127:2](sbe18046.htm#fr_467.md) Some words are
evidently here missing in the Pahl. text, including the first word of
the next section. The reason here given for the girdle being worn round
the waist, just below the uppermost third of the body, is that the
impregnable barrier of heaven (of which the girdle is a counterpart) is
said to be just below the uppermost third of the sky.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[127:3](sbe18046.htm#fr_468.md) See Chap. XXXVII,
80, 95.

<span id="fn_467"></span>[127:4](sbe18046.htm#fr_469.md) Reading vispŏ
khôî-*s*ôrân, but we might perhaps read vispŏân sahôrân, 'all
oppressors,' assuming that sahôr stands for Av. sâthra, a term applied
to some particular tribe of another religion which was under the rule of
Yim and his two predecessors (see Zamyâ*d* Yt. 26, 28, 31). Another
possible reading is vispŏân yêkhvarân, 'all frosts.'

<span id="fn_468"></span>[127:5](sbe18046.htm#fr_470.md) Assuming that
khvû*d*akŏ stands for khû*d*akŏ, but the word is uncertain.

<span id="fn_469"></span>[127:6](sbe18046.htm#fr_471.md) The particular
kind of fiendishness that led Yim astray in his old age (like Solomon)
was lying, that is, denial of the truth of his religion. In consequence
of this apostasy the royal glory departed from him, and he allied
himself to the demons in the <span id="page_128">p. 128</span> 617th
year of his reign, and remained in their power for most of the remaining
century of his life (see Zamyâ*d* Yt. 31-38, Bd. XVIII, 1, XXXIV, 4).

<span id="fn_470"></span>[128:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_472.md) Assuming that
dastŏ stands for Pers. da*s*t, and varî*v*akŏ, for Pers. garîvah;
otherwise, we may read 'from dignity and the hovel (varî*k*akŏ),'
meaning that they perish from all ranks; instead of all places.

<span id="fn_471"></span>[128:2](sbe18046.htm#fr_473.md) The rampart of
heaven (see § 11).

<span id="fn_472"></span>[128:3](sbe18046.htm#fr_474.md) His successors.

<span id="fn_473"></span>[128:4](sbe18046.htm#fr_475.md) As detailed in §
18.

<span id="fn_474"></span>[128:5](sbe18046.htm#fr_476.md) The Nîrang-i Kustî
(see § 27).

<span id="fn_475"></span>[129:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_477.md) The sacred shirt
(see Chap. XL, 2). The garment of a purified man is called Vohûman in
Vend. XIX, 76--78, 81--83 (trans. D.).

<span id="fn_476"></span>[129:2](sbe18046.htm#fr_478.md) The term se*g* or
sê*g*, used for 'destruction' here. and in §§ 21--23, is the name of
'the fiend who causes annihilation' (see Bd. XXVIII, 26).

<span id="fn_477"></span>[129:3](sbe18046.htm#fr_479.md) It is possible
that an-ayî*v*yâgânîh may mean 'no garmenting,' and refer to the sacred
shirt, as the previous term a*v*îbandîh, 'no belting,' refers to the
sacred thread-girdle.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[129:4](sbe18046.htm#fr_480.md) In Pahl. Vend.
XVIII, 21-23, with some variations (see Haug's Essays, p. 367).

<span id="fn_479"></span>[129:5](sbe18046.htm#fr_481.md) Instead of
rûbâkîh, 'progress,' K35 has rûbânîh, which might mean 'soul-state,' but
is probably a clerical blunder.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[130:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_482.md) In the Vendidad it
is he who does not put one on for three years.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[130:2](sbe18046.htm#fr_483.md) Both when ordered
by Vim and when confirmed by Zaratû*s*t.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[130:3](sbe18046.htm#fr_484.md) Reading
a*v*ar-vadi*s*nŏih (the first nasal in bandi*s*n = vandi*s*n being often
omitted); it can hardly be afrandi*s*nŏîh, 'magnificence,' because the
latter abstract suffix, -îh, would be <span id="page_131">p. 131</span>
ungrammatical after the former, -i*s*nŏ, in an uncompounded verbal noun.
Some of the other words are also uncertain.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[131:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_485.md) The MSS. have
merely rô*d*ih.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[131:2](sbe18046.htm#fr_486.md) As stated in § 23.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[131:3](sbe18046.htm#fr_487.md) This is the
Nîrang-i Kustî, or girdle formula, that has to be performed every time
the girdle is re-tied, which happens several times a day. It is fully
detailed in Appendix II, at the end of this volume.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[131:4](sbe18046.htm#fr_488.md) See § 21; the
first letter of nîhân, 'secretly,' is omitted by K35 in both places.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[131:5](sbe18046.htm#fr_489.md) Sê*g*, the fiend
of destruction, is connected with the demon Bût in Vend. XIX, 4, 6; but
the characteristic of 'insubordination' is more applicable to the demon
Tarômat, 'the disobedient' (see Bd. XXVIII, 14, 26, 34).

<span id="fn_488"></span>[132:1](sbe18046.htm#fr_490.md) The precise
meaning is not very clear.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[132:2](sbe18046.htm#fr_491.md) Alluding probably
to the Brahmanical thread which is worn by the higher castes of Hindus
diagonally, over one shoulder and below the other arm, and is so far
analogous to the Parsi thread-girdle that it is a religious symbol put
on with a religious rite.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[132:3](sbe18046.htm#fr_492.md) Reading
varôyi*s*nŏ ahû gâs, but K35 has rôyi*s*nŏ, 'growth,' instead of
'faith.'

<span id="fn_491"></span>[132:4](sbe18046.htm#fr_493.md) Reading kafihâ, or
kafagîh. Perhaps the allusion is to a rosary which is held in the hands,
or worn on the wrists, by people of many religions.
