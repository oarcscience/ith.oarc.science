### CHAPTER V.

1\. That writing which comes amid the writing of your epistle is a
correct fragment <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1](#fn_1150.md) as regards the
nothing in which *one* is to change the operation properly maintainable,
and it is becoming; because, if it be even for him, by whom it is
written from the

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

statements of Mê*d*yôk-mâh, Afarg, and Sôshâns <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1151.md), the several statements *and*
teachings of the same high-priests, yet then the elaboration *and*
publication thereof are not such as that which is sent down by his
further elaboration <span id="fr_1156"></span>[2](#fn_1152.md). 2. And
thereby it *has* seemed manifest *that it* is sent so that a wish for
the spirit *may* proceed from the truth of *its* minister (pa*d*ŏ), or
*from* his thought for the desired decision; or his understanding *may*
be of that kind which is warped (vukô*s*tŏ), as though he believed it as
other than the exposition of the religion *and* the teaching of the
high-priests. 3. But until the unparalleled arrival of Sôshâns <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[3](#fn_1153.md) any one not sharing in complete
knowledge is not appointed unto a patron spirit (ahvŏ), *and* the fiend
specially contends more experimentally with the thoughts of the
high-priests of the religion for a religious decision.

4\. And even the recompense of community <span
id="fr_1158"></span>[4](#fn_1154.md) of property is that when *one* gladly
observes pure thoughts; *and* the swift action of voluble (pûr) speakers
and kind regard of religious characters for deliverance <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[5](#fn_1155.md) *and* for the noticeable
undeceitfulness of the same spirit <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[6](#fn_1156.md)--which is itself the desire of settled
observation that is in it for the sake of the

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

same kind of full religious diffusion--are the swift action of the
patron spirit, which, for the sake of preparing him for a deliverance
that is not falsifying revelation *and is* without disputants, is a kind
regard for the deliverance itself of *him* whose spiritual life (hûkŏ)
it is.

5\. *As to* that which is thought by him <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[1](#fn_1157.md) of those deliverances sent down,
completed, *and* announced, I consider more particularly about the
meaning of one thing, which is their solemnized observance. 6. The
solemnized observance of Mê*d*yôk-mâh is in the teaching <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[2](#fn_1158.md) of Mê*d*yôk-mâh, and those of Afarg
and Sôshâns are each one meditated *and* indicated in a teaching; and
the pointedly superior position of each one of them is mentioned by him
in *his* statement of any teaching and *of* the decision set up. 7. Also
with a kind regard for his own choice he *has* thought it (the former
teaching) imperfect, and, on account of *what* was not attained by
it--which *was* a re-explainer of the same good ideas provided--*its*
dissimilarity to it is not unnoticed <span
id="fr_1163"></span>[3](#fn_1159.md). 8. *But* when *one* hears the
re-explainers of a true reply he is well protected (hû-zinharî*d*ŏ) by
complete mindfulness <span id="fr_1164"></span>[4](#fn_1160.md), *and* is
himself confident that the teaching of Mê*d*yôk-mâh is not the whole
statement of Mê*d*yôk-mâh, for there are many opinions of

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mê*d*yôk-mâh <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[1](#fn_1161.md) *which* have decided *in* another
manner; not *that* whatever Mê*d*yôk-mâh said is not good, *but* in the
teaching of Mê*d*yôk-mâh *it* is certain that even *what* is not proper
is mentioned many *times* as a possibility <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[2](#fn_1162.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[298:1](sbe18106.htm#fr_1154.md) Reading
ban*g*i*s*nîh, but it may be bû*g*i*s*nîh, 'deliverance from
contamination.' The reference is to the decree of Zâ*d*-sparam mentioned
in Chap. IV, 7, the 'writing' alluded to in Ep. II, ii, 1; iii, 1.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[299:1](sbe18106.htm#fr_1155.md) The names of
three of the commentators whose opinions are most frequently quoted in
the Pahlavi Vendidâ*d* (see Sls. I, 3). Each of them appears to have
written a complete 'teaching' or dissertation upon the ceremonial laws,
from which the quotations are taken (see § 6).

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[299:2](sbe18106.htm#fr_1156.md) That is, in
collecting the opinions of the ancients, he has twisted them so as to
suit his own views.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[299:3](sbe18106.htm#fr_1157.md) The last of the
future apostles (see Dd. II, 10), not the commentator of the same name
mentioned in § 1.

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[299:4](sbe18106.htm#fr_1158.md) Literally
'fraternity.'

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[299:5](sbe18106.htm#fr_1159.md) From pollution
or sin.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[299:6](sbe18106.htm#fr_1160.md) See § 2.

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[300:1](sbe18106.htm#fr_1161.md) Zâ*d*-sparam the
writer of the decree mentioned in § 1.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[300:2](sbe18106.htm#fr_1162.md) The word
*k*â*s*takŏ means usually a written course of teaching or exposition, a
commentary, dissertation, or manual of instruction.

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[300:3](sbe18106.htm#fr_1163.md) Implying that
Zâ*d*-sparam had been more inclined to enforce his own opinions than to
examine those of the commentators.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[300:4](sbe18106.htm#fr_1164.md) The Pahl.
translation of Av. ârmaiti, 'devotion,' which is usually personified as
a female archangel protecting the earth.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[301:1](sbe18106.htm#fr_1165.md) J inserts 'rules
which are mentioned in the special teaching of Mê*d*yôk-mâh.' It appears
probable that the author had access to much more complete commentaries
than the fragments now extant in the Pahlavi version of the Vendidâ*d*.

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[301:2](sbe18106.htm#fr_1166.md) Meaning,
probably, that Mê*d*yôk-mâh was disposed to relax the rigid enforcement
of the law in cases of doubt or difficulty, as the Avesta itself does in
several cases.
