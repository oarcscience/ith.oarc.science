### CHAPTER XXVIII.

1\. The twenty-seventh question is that which you ask thus: Why and what
is *the ceremony of* 

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

the three *nights* (satûîh), when during three days they order and
perform the sacred-cake ceremony (ya*z*i*s*nŏ drônô) of Srôsh <span
id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_175.md)?

2\. The reply is this, that the life and soul, when from the realm of
the spirit of air <span id="fr_177"></span>[2](#fn_176.md) they attain unto
worldly attire, and have passed into its pain and misfortune, are more
sensitive (nâ*z*ûktar); owing to their nurture, birth, *and* mission,
protection and defence are more desirable and more suitable for the
discreet (hû-*k*îragânîktar); and milk food, and renewed (navagûnak) and
constant attention to the fire are requisite  <span
id="fr_178"></span>[3](#fn_177.md). 3. So also when they are ousted from
bodily existence, and pain and the eradication of life have come upon
them, *they* are *in* like manner more sensitive, and sending them
protection and defence from spirits *and* worldly existences is more
desirable. 4. And on account of their spiritual character the offering
(firî*s*ti*s*nŏ) of gifts *for* the angels, fit for the ritual of a
spirit (maînôk nîrangîk), is more presentable; and also a fire newly
tended (nôgônd) is that which is more the custom in the *sacred*
ceremony (ya*z*i*s*nŏ).

5\. *For* the same reason *in* the three days when in connection with
the soul the *sacred* ceremony, the burning of fire, *its* cleanly
clearance (gôndi*s*nŏ),

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

*and* other religious *and* ritualistic defence, feeding on milk *and*
eating with a spoon <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_178.md) are ordered,
because--as the *sacred* ceremony, the defence and protection of the
worldly existences, is, by order of the creator, the business of Srôsh
the righteous <span id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_179.md), and *he* is also
one of *those* taking the account in the three *nights* <span
id="fr_181"></span>[3](#fn_180.md)--Srôsh the righteous gives the soul,
*for* three days and nights, the place of the spirit of air in the
world, and protection. 6. And because of the protectiveness of Srôsh,
and *that one* is assisted likewise by Srôsh's taking the account, and
for that purpose, are the manifest reasons for performing *and* ordering
the ceremony of Srôsh *for* three days and nights <span
id="fr_182"></span>[4](#fn_181.md).

7\. And the fourth day the ordering and performing the ceremony of the
righteous guardian spirit (ar*d*âî fravar*d*ŏ) <span
id="fr_183"></span>[5](#fn_182.md) are *for* the same soul and the
remaining righteous guardian spirits of those who are *and* were *and
will* be, from Gâyômar*d* the propitious to Sôshâns the triumphant <span
id="fr_184"></span>[6](#fn_183.md).

<span id="fn_175"></span>[59:1](sbe18035.htm#fr_176.md) See Chap. XIV, 4.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[59:2](sbe18035.htm#fr_177.md) Reading min maînôk
vâyîh, and assuming that 'the good Vâê' (the Vayô of the Râm Yt.), who
is often called the angel Râm, is alluded to (see Chap. XXX, 4, Sls. XI,
4, XVII, 4). The life and soul are treated as one being in this chapter,
as all the verbs and pronouns referring to them are in the singular
number in the Pahlavi text.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[59:3](sbe18035.htm#fr_178.md) Referring to the
proper care of new-born infants, for whose protection from the demons a
bright fire is to be kept constantly burning for three days (See Sls.
XII, r i, 12).

<span id="fn_178"></span>[60:1](sbe18035.htm#fr_179.md) No meat is to be
eaten by the survivors until the third night has passed away (see Sls.
XVII, 2).

<span id="fn_179"></span>[60:2](sbe18035.htm#fr_180.md) The angel Srôsh is
said to have been the first creature who performed the sacred ceremony
(see Yas. LVI, i, 2-7, ii, 2-4, iii, 2-4), of which the spiritual
counterpart was produced by Aûha*r*ma*zd* during the creation (see Bd.
II, 9).

<span id="fn_180"></span>[60:3](sbe18035.htm#fr_181.md) See Chap. XIV, 4.
