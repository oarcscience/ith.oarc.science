### CHAPTER LXXVI.

1\. *As to* the seventy-fifth question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: *As to* him who shall slay those who shall commit unnatural
intercourse, how is then his account as to good works and crime?

2\. The reply is this, that the high-priests, in *their* decision,
*have* thus specially said, that all worthy of death are *so* by the
decision of judges and the

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

command of kings, whose business is execution. 3. Whoever shall slay him
who *has* heinous sins <span id="fr_832"></span>[1](sbe18084.htm#fn_829)
after controversies three times with him, about the decision of those
acquainted with the religion *and about* the command of kings, when he
*has* thus remained in the sin in defiance of his own relations--and not
inimically to the man *and* injuriously to the religion, but inimically
to the sin *and* in order to keep away intercourse with demons--is to
consider *it* as a great good work. 4. No command is given about the
decision of *what one* is to do *in* the same matter, more heedfully and
more authorisedly in *cases of* doubtful attention, for the good work
exists undoubtedly more *and* more abundantly <span
