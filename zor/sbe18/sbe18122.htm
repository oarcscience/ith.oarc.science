<p align="center"><I>In</I> the name of the sacred beings.</p>  
<p>A copy of the notification (vish&acirc;<I>d</I>ak&#335;') of <I>his</I> priestly lordship M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har, son of Y&ucirc;d&acirc;n-Yim, regarding the grievous sinfulness of <I>assuming</I> the propriety of washing for fifteen times.</p>  
<p align="center">____________________</p>  
<p align="center"><I>In</I> the name of the sacred beings.</p>  
<p>1. It <I>has</I> come unto the ears (va<I>s</I>amm&ucirc;ni<I>s</I>n&#335;) of me, M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har, son of Y&ucirc;d&acirc;n-Yim, pontiff (ra<I>d</I>) of P&acirc;rs <I>and</I> Kirm&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1396"></A><A HREF="#fn_1391"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, that, in some quarters of the country of Ir&acirc;n, they whose chance happens <I>to be</I> so much&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1397"></A><A HREF="#fn_1392"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> pollution, such as is decreed unto so much washing of the customary <I>parts</I> (p&icirc;<I>s</I>ak&#335;), always wash <I>themselves</I> fifteen times with bull's urine and once with water, consider themselves as clean&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1398"></A><A HREF="#fn_1393"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and go to water, fire, and <I>ceremonial</I> ablution, the ablution</p>

<p>of the sacred twigs. 2. Such--although&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1399"></A><A HREF="#fn_1394"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they say that Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1400"></A><A HREF="#fn_1395"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, son of Y&ucirc;d&acirc;n-Yim, <I>has</I> ordered, <I>and</I> the high-priests <I>have</I> appointed, washing of this kind--<I>has</I> appeared to my well-reflecting (h&ucirc;-min) opinion, apprehension, and appreciation very marvellous <I>and</I> grave, and <I>merely</I> a rumour. 3. And <I>it</I> is needful for me to keep those of the good religion in <I>all</I> quarters of the country of Ir&acirc;n informed concerning the placing reliance upon their washing with the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1401"></A><A HREF="#fn_1396"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> to make my own opinion clear also as regards the writings collected.</p>  
<p>4. And, first of all, about the indispensability of the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I> I write several such copies of a well-matured writing of mine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1402"></A><A HREF="#fn_1397"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> as may even be new light to the intelligent. 5. That my opinion of the information provided by revelation, the decisions <I>of</I> high-priests, <I>and</I> the teachings <I>of</I> those of the primitive faith is thus, that washing by the polluted with water is pollution for the life and spiritual life (ahv&ocirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1403"></A><A HREF="#fn_1398"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; they render the material <I>body</I> clean thereby, <I>but</I> that which is known as the handiwork&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1404"></A><A HREF="#fn_1399"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> of the immortals, and is also professionally called the Bareshn&ucirc;m, when <I>there is</I> the protection of a ritual of <I>various</I> kinds, shall make the body clean from endless worldly attacks.</p>  
<p>6. It is in the nine ablution seats (magak&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1405"></A><A HREF="#fn_1400"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and the furrow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1406"></A><A HREF="#fn_1401"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>, even with prayer, bull's urine, water,</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_361"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 361</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and other appliances, and the ritual which is such as is declared in the teaching of revelation; and even now the purifiers, who are just as written <I>about</I> below, keep <I>it</I> in use. 7. When there is a washing they wash just as in the well-teaching statements which are known as <I>those</I> of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h, of Afarg, and of S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1407"></A><A HREF="#fn_1402"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, or <I>in</I> the statement of one of those three teachings, or in the statement of one of the high-priests <I>by</I> whom those three teachings are declared as propriety, or has come unto me as the practice of those same three teachings <I>by</I> those of the primitive faith.</p>  
<p>8. I deem <I>this</I> deliverance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1408"></A><A HREF="#fn_1403"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> one wholly approvable, and the washer <I>in</I> a washing of that kind, with the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>--which is lawfully <I>of</I> that description--I consider as a purifier who is approvable. 9. And the polluted of every description, as <I>above</I> written, who <I>have</I> obtained, for any indispensable reason whatever, a purifier, as <I>above</I> written, whom even now various districts <I>and</I> various places have appointed <I>and</I> approved, are able to wash with the Bareshn&ucirc;m ceremony as <I>above</I> written. 10. Then their washing fifteen times is no deliverance in any way, and to wash them quickly with the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I> as <I>above</I> written is indispensable.</p>  
<p>11. Owing to a washing of the same kind through the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>, as is intended, water, fire, and other <I>things</I>, not to provide care for which is un&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1409"></A><A HREF="#fn_1404"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> . . . . . . . . . . authorisedly is grievously sinful.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 12. When, on account of a cleansing through another washing, distinct from the Bareshn&ucirc;m ceremony,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_363"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 363</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they consider themselves as clean <I>it</I> is more grievously sinful; just as when they do not wash with the Bareshn&ucirc;m, as <I>above</I> written, <I>but</I> consider themselves as clean through <I>washing</I> fifteen times, as <I>above</I> written, or on account of any washing whatever distinct from the Bareshn&ucirc;m, <I>it</I> is more grievously sinful; because, when they do not wash with a Bareshn&ucirc;m, as <I>above</I> written, <I>but</I> wash for fifteen times, as <I>above</I> written, or any washing whatever distinct from the Bareshn&ucirc;m, as <I>above</I> written, they do not become clean, through the professional washing which is decreed, from that pollution which remains&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1410"></A><A HREF="#fn_1405"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>13. When without similar trouble <I>and</I> great judiciousness they go unto water <I>and</I> fire, the sin is grievous; and when they go to the bowl (pa<I>d</I>m&acirc;n&#335;) for ablution of the sacred twigs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1411"></A><A HREF="#fn_1406"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>it</I> is non-ablution advisedly, <I>and</I> to perform the ceremonial therewith would not be authorised. 14. And, <I>in</I> like manner, the washing of polluted H&ocirc;m <I>twigs</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1412"></A><A HREF="#fn_1407"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, for any indispensable purpose, with the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>, as <I>above</I> written, is not possible.</p>  
<p>15. Therefore, so that we <I>may</I> obtain as <I>it were</I> a remedy for it, I wash with the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>, as <I>above</I> written; to keep the mind steadfast <I>and</I> to attain to a remedy I wash with the Bareshn&ucirc;m, as <I>above</I> written; <I>and</I> to bestow the indispensable, comprehensive Bareshn&ucirc;m, as <I>above</I> written, is indeed a good work suitable for the discreet <I>and</I> liberated</p>  
<p>

<p>from bonds, and the purification of body <I>and</I> soul is connected with it.</p>  
<p>16. These <I>things</I> those of the primitive faith, who provided for the moderns, <I>have</I> communicated, whose position <I>was</I> above us moderns who are now the law (g&ucirc;n) of others, and are teachers and rulers; our station as regards them is the position (g&acirc;s&icirc;h) of disciples <I>to spiritual</I> masters, <I>that of</I> listeners <I>and</I> servitors to form <I>and</I> hold the opinion, about the same and other <I>things</I>, which those of the primitive faith formed; <I>and</I> the teaching of even one of those high-priests is greater <I>and</I> higher than our sayings and decisions.</p>  
<p>17. And <I>as to</I> every custom there may be in the country of Ir&acirc;n, about casting away the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>, as written by me, and about all the polluted, as <I>above</I> written--whom <I>it</I> is possible to wash, for any indispensable reason whatever, with the Bareshn&ucirc;m as written by me, <I>and</I> one does not wash with the Bareshn&ucirc;m as <I>written</I> by me, <I>but</I> is ordered to wash for fifteen times, as written by me, <I>and</I> to pronounce as clean--and <I>which</I> is established as a rule <I>one</I> is urged to practise, if Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam or any one else <I>has</I> ordered, said, or decided in the name of authority <I>that one</I> is to do <I>so, or has</I> established <I>it</I> as a rule, <I>or</I> set <I>it</I> going, this is to give authoritatively my opinion, decision, and enactment upon it likewise. 18. That <I>those</I> same sayings are short-sighted (a&ecirc;-v&ecirc;nak&#335;), <I>that</I> same order is unlawfully <I>given, that</I> same decision is false teaching, <I>that</I> same rule is vicious, <I>that</I> same setting going is grievously sinful, and <I>that</I> same authority is not to be accepted; <I>it</I> is a practice, therefore, not to be performed, <I>and</I> whoever <I>has</I> performed it, is to</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_365"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 365</FONT></A></p>  
<p>engage quickly <I>in</I> renunciation of it. 19. And he who <I>has</I> decreed in the country of Ir&acirc;n, in the name of authority, washing of <I>other</I> kinds <I>as</I> all-remedial for the polluted, as <I>above</I> written, <I>and has</I> established a rule of that description is to be considered as a heretic (aharm&ocirc;k&ocirc;) deserving death.</p>  
<p>20. So, when through his wilfulness that kind of injury without enlightenment (b&acirc;m) is decreed, <I>and</I> a rule of that description is established, as <I>above</I> written, <I>and one</I> rendered polluted is washed fifteen times with bull's urine <I>and</I> once with water, or <I>in</I> whatever other mode that is distinct from the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I> as written by me, <I>though</I> it is possible to wash him, for any indispensable reason whatever, with the Bareshn&ucirc;m as <I>above</I> written, then, his renunciation <I>of sin being</I> accomplished, <I>he</I> is to be washed again at the nine ablution seats (magh)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1413"></A><A HREF="#fn_1408"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with the Bareshn&ucirc;m as written by me; <I>and</I> until washed again, as written by me, <I>he</I> is not to go to water and fire <I>and</I> the bowl for ablution.</p>  
<p>21. And this epistle is written by me, in my own <I>hand</I>-writing, for the sake of <I>all</I> members whatever of the good religion of the country of Ir&acirc;n becoming aware of the opinion, apprehension, <I>and</I> appreciation of the commands of religion <I>entertained by</I> me, M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har, son of Y&ucirc;d&acirc;n-Yim; <I>and</I> several copies are finished <I>in</I> the month of the triumphant Ho<I>r</I>vada<I>d</I> of the year 250 of Ya<I>z</I><I>d</I>aka<I>r</I><I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1414"></A><A HREF="#fn_1409"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1404"></A><A HREF="sbe18122.htm#fr_1409">361:3</A> At this point there is a blank page in K35, and also in the MS. belonging to Mr. Tehmuras Dinshawji, which is supposed to be older; and one line is left blank in BK. It is not, however, <A NAME="page_362"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 362</FONT></A> quite certain that any text is really missing, as this section can be read continuously and translated as follows, without much difficulty:--'<I>Apart</I> from a washing of the same kind through the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>, as is intended, <I>there</I> would be a grievous sin <I>against</I> water, fire, and other <I>things</I>, not to provide care for which would be unauthorised.'</p>  
<p>If some folios of text are missing, as seems quite possible from the terms applied to this epistle in &sect; 4, the question arises whether a portion of the missing text may be contained in the following fragment on the subject of the Bareshn&ucirc;m, which is appended to the passage (Ep. II, vi, 2-ix, 7) interpolated in Dd. XXXVII, 33 in the MS. J:--</p>  
<p>'As it is declared in revelation that, if a man who <I>has</I> chanted comes upon a corpse, <I>whether</I> a dog, or a fox, or a wolf, or a male, or a female, or any <I>creature</I> on whose corpse it is possible <I>that</I> he <I>may</I> come, that good man becomes so that a man <I>may</I> become defiled by him, <I>and</I> it is necessary to wash the polluted <I>one</I>, so that it <I>may</I> not make him a sinner. In order that they <I>may</I> act <I>so</I> to the polluted <I>one</I> it is necessary to wash <I>him</I>, it is necessary to perform that Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I> of the nine nights. If the man that is spoken of <I>has</I> worked about carrying the dead and contact with dead matter (n&ocirc;s&acirc; ham&acirc;lih), so that they know about his defilement to whom he comes, then he <I>who has</I> done this work <I>in</I> contact with dead matter becomes afterwards disabled <I>for</I> that worship of the sacred beings which they perform. So, also, <I>some one</I> says (compare Vend. VIII, 271-299), where in a wilderness (vy&acirc;v&acirc;n) are several priests (&acirc;sr&ucirc;v&ocirc;) <I>and</I> a man lies <I>on</I> the road, there he <I>who</I> carries the dead <I>body</I> of the man who passes away--as those others remain <I>and</I> stand away helpless, without offerings of <I>inward</I> prayer (v&acirc;<I>g</I>&#335; vakhtag&acirc;n) over that person (kerp&ocirc;) according to the religious way--<I>having</I> washed his body, comes into the town and performs the nine nights' Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I> twice; afterwards, his G&ecirc;t&ocirc;-khar&icirc;<I>d</I> <I>ceremonies</I> (see Dd. LXXIX, 4) are performed, <I>and</I> he has acted well according to the religious way; then he comes into the ceremonial of the sacred beings. "How are those men purified, O righteous <I>one!</I> who shall stand up by a corpse <I>which is</I> very dry <I>and</I> dead a year?" (See Pahl. Vend. VIII, 107, 108.) The reply is this, that "those men are purified; <A NAME="page_363"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 363</FONT></A> for <I>it</I> is not <I>to</I> the dry from that dryness--that is, it would not act from this polluted <I>thing--that</I> the existence <I>of</I> dry diffusion <I>has</I> arisen."'</P>
