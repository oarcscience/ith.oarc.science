### III. THE MEANING OF KHVÊTÛK-DAS OR KHVÊTÛDÂ*D*.

THAT the term Khvêtûk-das is applied to marriages between kinsfolk is
admitted by the Parsis, but they consider that such marriages were never
contracted by their ancestors within the first degree of relationship,
because they are not so permitted among themselves at the present day.
Any statements of Greek, or other foreign, writers, regarding the
marriage of Persians with their mothers, sisters, or daughters, they
believe to be simply calumnies due to ignorance, which it is
discreditable to Europeans to quote  <span
id="fr_1491"></span>[1](#fn_1485.md). Such statements, they consider, may
have referred to the practices of certain heretical sects, but never to
those of the orthodox faith.

The Parsis are, no doubt, fully justified in receiving the statements of
foreign writers, regarding the customs of their ancestors, with proper
caution; a caution which is quite as necessary when the statements are
agreeable as when they are disagreeable to present notions. The Greeks,
especially, had such a thorough contempt for all foreign customs that
differed from their own, that they must have found it quite as difficult
to obtain correct information, or to form an impartial opinion, about
oriental habits as the average European finds it at the present time. On
the other hand, the Parsis have to consider that the ancient Greek
writers, whose statements they repudiate, were neither priests nor
zealots, whose accounts of religious customs

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

might be distorted by religious prejudices, but historians accustomed to
describe facts as impartially as their information and nationality would
permit. It is quite possible that these writers may have assumed that
such marriages were common among the Persians, merely because they had
sometimes occurred among the Persian rulers; but such an assumption
would be as erroneous as supposing that the marriage practices of the
Israelites were similar to those of their most famous kings, David and
Solomon, forgetting that an oriental sovereign is usually considered to
be above the law and not subject to it.

Rejecting all statements of foreigners, as liable to suspicion, unless
confirmed by better evidence, it seems desirable to ascertain what
information can be obtained, on this subject, from the religious books
of the Parsis themselves. This matter has hitherto been too much
neglected by those best acquainted with the original texts, and must be
considered as only partially exhausted in the following pages.

The term Khvêtûk-das <span id="fr_1492"></span>[1](#fn_1486.md) is a
Pahlavi transcription of the Avesta word *hv*aêtvadatha, 'a giving of,
to, or by, one's own,' and is sometimes partially translated into the
form Khvêtûk-das, or Khvêtûk-da*d*, in which the syllable dâ*d*, 'what
is given, a gift,' is merely a translation of the syllable das (Av.
datha).

The Avesta word *hv*aêtvadatha is not found in any of the Gâthas, or
sacred hymns, that are still extant and are usually considered the
oldest portion

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

of the Avesta. But its former component, *hv*aêtu, occurs several times
therein, with the meaning 'one's own, or kinsman,' as distinguished from
'friends' and 'slaves.'

The earliest occurrence of the complete word is probably in Yas. XIII,
28 <span id="fr_1493"></span>[1](#fn_1487.md), where it is mentioned as
follows:--'I praise . . . . the righteous *Hv*aêtvadatha, which is the
greatest and best and most excellent of things that exist and will
exist, which is Ahurian and Zarathu*s*trian.' This merely implies that
*Hv*aêtvadatha was a good work of much importance, which is also shown
by Visp. III, 18, Gâh IV, 8, and Vi*s*tâsp Yt. 17, where the
*Hv*aêtvadatha (meaning the man who has accomplished that good work) is
associated with youths who are specially righteous for other reasons.
But there is nothing in any of these passages to indicate the nature of
the good work.

In Vend. VIII, 35, 36 we are told that those who carry the dead must
afterwards wash their hair and bodies with the urine 'of cattle or
draught oxen, not of men or women, except the two who are *Hv*aêtvadatha
and *Hv*aêtvadathi,' that is, male and female performers of
*Hv*aêtvadatha. This passage, therefore, proves that the good work might
be accomplished by both men and women, but it does not absolutely imply
that it had any connection with marriage.

Turning to the Pahlavi translations of these passages we find the
transcription Khvêtûk-das, Khvêtûk-dat, or Khvêtûk-dasîh, with
explanations which add very little to our knowledge of the nature of

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

the good work. Thus, Pahl. Yas. XI II, 28 merely states that it is
'declared about it that it is requisite to do *it*;' Pahl. Vi*s*tâsp Yt.
17 <span id="fr_1494"></span>[1](#fn_1488.md) asserts that 'the duty of
Khvêtûk-das is said *to be* the greatest good work in the religion,
that, owing to it, Aharman, the demon of demons, is becoming hopeless,
so that the dissolution of Khvêtûk-das is worthy of death;' and Pahl.
Vend. VIII, 36 speaks of 'the two who are a Khvêtûk-dat man *and*
woman <span id="fr_1495"></span>[2](#fn_1489.md), that is, it is done by
them.'

Another reference to Khvêtûk-das in the Pahlavi translations of the
Avesta occurs in Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 4, as follows:--'Thus I proclaim in
the world that \[which he who is Aûha*r*ma*zd* made his own\] best
\[Khvêtûk-das\] <span id="fr_1496"></span>[3](#fn_1490.md). By aid of
righteousness Aûha*r*ma*zd* is aware, who created this *one* <span
id="fr_1497"></span>[4](#fn_1491.md) \[to perform

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Khvêtûk-das\]. And
through fatherhood Vohûman <span id="fr_1498"></span>[1](#fn_1492.md) *was*
cultivated by him, \[that is, for the sake of the proper nurture of the
creatures Khvêtûk-das *was* performed by him.\] So she who is *his*
daughter is acting well, \[who is the fully-mindful\]
Spenda*r*ma*d* <span id="fr_1499"></span>[2](#fn_1493.md), \[that is, she
did not shrink from the act of Khvêtûk-das.\] *She* <span
id="fr_1500"></span>[3](#fn_1494.md) *was* not deceived, \[that is, *she*
did not shrink from the act of Khvêtûk-das, because *she* is\] an
observer of everything \[as regards that which is\] Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s,
\[that is, through the religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd* *she* attains to all
duty and law.\]' The allusions to Khvêtûk-das in this passage are mere
interpolations introduced by the Pahlavi translators, for the sake of
recommending the practice; they have no existence in the Avesta text,
but they show that the Pahlavi translators understood Khvêtûk-das to

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

refer to such relationship as that of father and daughter, as will
appear more clearly from further allusions to the same circumstances in
passages to be quoted hereafter <span id="fr_1501"></span>[1](#fn_1495.md).
Regarding the age of the Pahlavi translation of the Yasna we only know
for certain that it existed in its present form a thousand years ago,
because a passage is quoted from it by Zâ*d*-sparam, brother of the
author of the Dâ*d*istân-î Dînîk and Epistles of Mânû*sk*îhar, in his
Selections <span id="fr_1502"></span>[2](#fn_1496.md), and we know that he
was living in A.D. 881 <span id="fr_1503"></span>[3](#fn_1497.md). But it
was probably revised for the last time as early as the reign of Khûsrô
Nôshirvân (A.D. 531-579), when the Pahlavi Vendidâ*d* was also finally
revised <span id="fr_1504"></span>[4](#fn_1498.md).

The Pahlavi versions of the lost Nasks must have been nearly of the same
age as those of the extant Avesta, but of the contents of these versions
we possess only certain statements of later writers. According to some
of the modern Persian statements the Dûbâsrû*g*e*d* Nask contained many
details about Khvêtûk-das, but this is contradicted by the long account
of its contents given in the eighth book of the Dînka*rd*, which was
written more than a thousand years ago <span
id="fr_1505"></span>[5](#fn_1499.md), and in which Khvêtûk-das is not once
noticed. The practice is, however, mentioned several times in the
Dînka*rd*, as an important good work noticed in the Nasks, but no
details are given, except in the following passages from the ninth
book:--

First, regarding the latter part of the eighteenth fargar*d* of the
Vara*s*tmânsar Nask:--'And this, too,

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

that thereupon they shall excite a brother *and* sister with mutual
desire, so that they shall perform Khvêtûk-das with unanimity, and
before midday are generated a radiance which is sublime, centred in the
face, and peeping glances (vênîkŏ Mils); and they make the radiance,
*which* is openly manifest, grow up in altitude the height of three
spears of a length of three reeds *each* <span
id="fr_1506"></span>[1](#fn_1500.md); and after midday they have learned
expulsion (rânakîh <span id="fr_1507"></span>[2](#fn_1501).md), *and* shall
renounce the fiend who is before the destroyer.' This is clearly an
allusion to the Khvêtûk-das of brother and sister, as it can hardly be
considered as merely referring to the arrangement of marriages between
their children.

Second, regarding the earlier part of the fourteenth fargar*d* of the
Bakô N ask:--'And this, too, that the performance of whatever would be a
causer of procreation for the doers of actions is extolled *as* the
perfect custom of the first Khvêtûk-das; because causing the procreation
of the doers of actions is the fatherhood of mankind, the proper
fatherhood of mankind is through the proper production of progeny, the
proper production of progeny is the cultivation of progeny in one's own
with the inclinations (khîmîhâ) of a first wish <span
id="fr_1508"></span>[3](#fn_1502.md), and the cultivation of progeny in
one's own is Khvêtûk-das. And he who extols the fatherhood of mankind,
when *it is* a causer of the procreation of the doers of actions, has
also extolled Khvêtûk-das. And this, too, that the proper nurture for
the creatures, by him whose wish is for

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

virtue, has taught *him* to perform Khvêtûk-das. Virtue is its virtue
even for this reason, because, for the sake of maintaining a creature
with propriety, he reckons upon the proper disposition of the multitude,
that which is generated in the race by innumerable Khvêtûk-dases <span
id="fr_1509"></span>[1](#fn_1503.md). And this, too, that Spenda*r*ma*d* is
taught *as being* in daughterhood to Aûha*r*ma*zd* by him whose wisdom
*consists* in complete mindfulness. Even on this account, because wisdom
*and* complete mindfulness <span id="fr_1510"></span>[2](#fn_1504.md) are
within the limits of Aûha*r*ma*zd* and Spenda*r*ma*d*; wisdom is that
which is Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s, complete mindfulness is that which is
Spenda*r*ma*d*'s, and complete mindfulness is the progeny of wisdom,
just as Spenda*r*ma*d* is *of* Aûha*r*ma*zd*. And from this is expressly
the announcement that, by him who *has* connected complete mindfulness
with wisdom, Spenda*r*ma*d* is taught *as being* in daughterhood to
Aûha*r*ma*zd*. And this, too, the existence of the formation of that
daughterhood, is taught by him whose righteousness *consists* in
complete mindfulness.' This quotation merely shows that Khvêtûk-das
referred to connections between near relations, but whether the
subsequent allusions to the daughterhood of Spenda*r*ma*d* had reference
to the Khvêtûk-das of father and daughter is less certain than in the
case of Pahl. Yas. XLIV, 4, previously quoted <span
id="fr_1511"></span>[3](#fn_1505.md).

Third, regarding the middle of the twenty-first

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

fargar*d* of the Bakô Nask:--'And this, too, that a daughter is given in
marriage (nê*s*manîh) to a father, even so as a woman to another man, by
him who teaches the daughter and the other woman the reverence *due*
unto father and husband.' The reference here to the marriage of father
and daughter is too clear to admit of mistake, though the term
Khvêtûk-das is not mentioned.

Next in age to the Pahlavi versions of the Avesta we ought perhaps to
place the Book of Ar*d*â-Vîrâf, because we are told (AV. I, 35),
regarding Vîrâf, that 'there are *some* who call *him by* the name of
Nikhshahpûr,' and this may have been the celebrated commentator of that
name, who was a councillor of king Khûsrô Nôshirvân <span
id="fr_1512"></span>[1](#fn_1506.md), so that we cannot safely assume that
this book was written earlier than the end of the sixth century. It
gives an account of heaven and hell, which Ar*d*â-Vîrâf is supposed to
have visited during the period of a week, while he seemed to be in a
trance. In the second grade of heaven, counting upwards, he found the
souls of those who had 'performed no ceremonies, chanted no sacred
hymns, and practised no Khvêtûk-das,' but had come there 'through other
good works;' and it may be noted that the two upper grades of heaven
appear to have been reserved for good sovereigns, chieftains,
high-priests, and others specially famous. In hell, also, he saw the
soul of a woman suffering grievous punishment because she had 'violated
Khvêtûk-das;' but this passage occurs in one MS. only. We are also told
(AV. II, 1-3, 7-10) that 'Vîrâf had seven sisters, and all <span
id="fr_1513"></span>[2](#fn_1507.md) those seven sisters

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

were as wives of Vîrâf; revelation, also, *was* easy to them, and the
ritual had *been* performed . . . . they stood up and bowed, and spoke
thus: "Do not this thing, ye Ma*zd*a-worshippers! for we are seven
sisters, and he is an only brother, and we are, all seven sisters, as
wives <span id="fr_1514"></span>[1](#fn_1508.md) of that brother."' This
passage, supposing that it really refers to marriage, seems to attribute
an exaggerated form of the Khvêtûk-das of brother and sister to Vîrâf,
as a proof of his extraordinary sanctity; but it can hardly be
considered as a literal statement of facts, any more than the supposed
case of a woman having married seven brothers successively, mentioned in
Mark xii. 20-22. Luke xx. 29-32.

In another Pahlavi book of about the same age, which is best known by
its Pâzand name, Mainyô-i Khar*d* <span
id="fr_1515"></span>[2](#fn_1509.md), we find Khvêtûk-das placed second
among

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

seven classes of good works (Mkh. IV, 4), and ninth among thirty-three
classes of the same (Mkh. XXXVII, 12); and the dissolution of
Khvêtûk-das is mentioned as the fourth in point of heinousness among
thirty classes of sin (Mkh. XXXVI, 7).

In the Bahman Ya*s*t, which may have existed in its original Pahlavi
form before the Muhammadan conquest of Persia <span
id="fr_1516"></span>[1](#fn_1510.md), it is stated that, even in the
perplexing time of foreign conquest, the righteous man 'continues the
religious practice of Khvêtûk-das in his family <span
id="fr_1517"></span>[2](#fn_1511.md).'

The third book of the Dînka*rd*, which appears to have been compiled by
the last editor <span id="fr_1518"></span>[3](#fn_1512.md) of that work,
contains a long defence of the practice of Khvêtûk-das, forming its
eighty-second <span id="fr_1519"></span>[4](#fn_1513.md) chapter, which may
be translated as follows:--

'On a grave attack (hû-girâyi*s*nŏ) of a Jew upon

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

a priest, which *was* owing to asking the reason of the custom (âhankŏ)
as to Khvêtûk-das; and the reply of the priest to him from the
exposition of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion.

'That is, as *one* complaining about wounds, damage, *and* distress
comes on, *it* is lawful to dispute with him in defence begirt with
legal opinion (dâ*d*istânŏ parvand), and the consummation of the
accusation of an innocent man is averted; *so* of the creatures, the
invisible connection of their own power to fellow-creations *and* their
own *race*, through the propitiousness of the protection *and*
preserving *influence* of the sacred beings, is a girdle, *and* the
consummation of the mutual assistance of men is Khvêtûk-das. The name is
Khvêtûk-das, which is *used* when *it is* "a giving of *one's* own"
(khvê*s*-dahi*s*nîh), and its office (gâs) is a strong connection with
one's own *race and* fellow-creations, through the protection *and*
preserving *influence* of the sacred beings, which is, according to the
treatises, the union of males *and* females of mankind of one's own
*race* in preparation for, and connection with, the renovation *of the
universe*. That union, for the sake of proceeding incalculably more
correctly, is, among the innumerable similar races of mankind, that with
near kinsfolk (nabânazdi*s*tânŏ), *and*, among near kinsfolk, that with
those next of kin (nazd-pa*d*vandânŏ); *and* the mutual connection of
the three kinds of nearest of kin (nazd-pa*d*vandtar)--which are father
and daughter, so and she who bore *him* <span
id="fr_1520"></span>[1](#fn_1514.md), and brother and sister--is the most
complete (a*v*îrtar) that I have considered.

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

'On the same subject the exposition of the obscure statements of the
good religion, by a wise high-priest of the religion, is this:--"I
assert that God (yêdatŏ) is the being, as regards the creatures, who
created *any* of the creatures there are which are male, and *any* there
are which are female; and that which is male is a son, and, similarly, a
daughter is that which is female. The daughter of himself, the father of
all, *was* Spenda*r*ma*d* <span id="fr_1521"></span>[1](#fn_1515.md), the
earth, a female being of the creation; and from her he created the male
Gâyômar*d* <span id="fr_1522"></span>[2](#fn_1516.md), which is explained
*as* the name for him who *was* specially the first man, since it is
Gâyômar*d* living who is speaking *and* mortal, a limitation which *was*
specially his, because of these three words--which are 'living,
speaking, *and* mortal'--two of the limitations, which are 'living and
speaking,' *were* through the provision of *his* father, the creator,
and one, which is 'mortal,' *was* proceeding from the destroyer; the
same limitation is upon all mankind, who are connected with that man's
lineage, until the renovation *of the universe*. And now I say, if the
aid of the father *has* produced a male from the daughter, it is named a
Khvêtûk-das of father *and* daughter <span
id="fr_1523"></span>[3](#fn_1517.md)."

'This, too, is from the exposition of the religion, that the semen of
Gâyômar*d*--which is called seed--when he passed away, fell *to*
Spenda*r*ma*d* <span id="fr_1524"></span>[4](#fn_1518.md), the earth, which
*was* his own mother; and, from its being united

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

*there*with, Mashya *and* Mashîyôî <span
id="fr_1525"></span>[1](#fn_1519.md) *were* the son and daughter of
Gâyômar*d* and Spenda*r*ma*d*, *and* it is named the Khvêtûk-das of son
and mother. And Mashya and Mashîyôî, as male and female, practised the
quest of offspring, one with the other, and it is named the Khvêtûk-das
of brother and sister. And many couples *were* begotten by them, *and*
the couples became continually <span id="fr_1526"></span>[2](#fn_1520.md)
wife and husband <span id="fr_1527"></span>[3](#fn_1521.md); and all men,
who *have* been, are, and *will* be, are from origin the seed of
Khvêtûk-das. And this is the reason which is essential for *its*
fulfilment by law, *that* where *its* contemplation (andâ*g*isnŏ) exists
*it* is manifest from the increase of the people of all regions,

'And I assert that the demons are enemies of man, and a non-existence of
desire for them consists *in* striving for it when Khvêtûk-das is
practised; it then becomes their <span id="fr_1528"></span>[4](#fn_1522.md)
reminder *of* that original practice of contemplation which is the
complete gratitude of men, and *has* become his <span
id="fr_1529"></span>[5](#fn_1523.md) who is inimical to them. Grievous
fear, distress, and anguish also come upon them, *their* power
diminishes, and they less understand the purpose of causing the
disturbance *and* ruin of men. And *it* is certain that making the
demons distressed, suffering, frightened, *and* weakened is thus a good
work, and this way of having reward and *of* recompense is the property
of the practisers of such good works.

'And I assert that the goodness of appearance and growth of body, the
display of wisdom, temper,

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

and modesty, the excellence of skill *and* strength, and also the other
qualities of children are so much *the more* as they are nearer to the
original race of the begetter, and they shall receive *them* more
perfectly *and* more gladly. An example is seen *in* those who *spring*
from a religious *woman* who is gentle, believing the spiritual
*existence*, acting modestly, of scanty strength, who is a forgiver and
reverential, *and from* a mail-*clad* (gapar) warrior of worldly
religion, who is large-bodied *and* possessing strength which is
stimulating (âgâr) *his* stout heart while he begets. They <span
id="fr_1530"></span>[1](#fn_1524.md) are not completely for war--which is a
continuance of lamentation (nâ*s*-ravandîh)--and not for carefulness and
affection for the soul; as *from* the dog *and* wolf--and not the ruin
(se*g*) *of* the sheep--arises the fox, like the wolf, *but* not *with*
the strength of the wolf like the dog, and it does not even possess
*its* perfect shape, nor that of the dog. And *they are* like those
which are born from a swift Arab horse and a native *dam*, and are not
galloping like the Arab, and not kicking (pa*d*âyak) like the native.
And *they have* not even the same perfect characteristics  <span
id="fr_1531"></span>[2](#fn_1525.md), just as the mule that *springs* from,
the horse and the ass, which is not like unto either' of them, and even
*its* seed is cut off thereby, *and its* lineage is not propagated
forwards.

'And this is the advantage from the pure preservation of race. I assert
that *there* are three <span id="fr_1532"></span>[3](#fn_1526.md) species

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (vâg) *and* kinds
of affection of sister *and* brother for that which shall be born of
them:--one is this, where *it is* the offspring of brother and brother;
one is this, where the offspring is that of <span
id="fr_1533"></span>[1](#fn_1527.md) brothers <span
id="fr_1534"></span>[2](#fn_1528.md) and their sister; and one is this,
where *it is* the offspring of sisters <span
id="fr_1535"></span>[3](#fn_1529.md). And as to the one of these where the
offspring is that of <span id="fr_1536"></span>[4](#fn_1530.md) a brother,
and for the same reason as applies to all three <span
id="fr_1537"></span>[5](#fn_1531.md) species of them, the love, desire, and
effort, which arise for the nurture of offspring of the three species,
are in hope of benefit. And equally adapted are the offspring to the
procreators; and this is the way of the increasing love of children,
through the good nurture which is very hopeful.

'And so, also, are those who are born of father and daughter, or son and
mother. Light flashed forth (*g*astŏ) or unflashed (aparvâkhtŏ) is
always seen at the time when it is much exposed, and pleased is he who
has a child of his child, even when it is from some one of a different
race and different

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

country. That, too, *has* then become much delight (vâyag) *which* is
expedient, that pleasure, sweet ness, and joy which are owing to a son
that a man begets from a daughter of his own, who is also a brother *of
that* same mother; and he who is born of a son and mother is also a
brother *of that* same father; this is a way of much pleasure, which is
a blessing of the joy, *and* no harm is therein ordained that is more
than the advantage, and no vice that is more than the well-doing (khûp
gâr). And if it be said that it is of evil appearance, it should be
observed that when <span id="fr_1538"></span>[1](#fn_1532.md) a wound
occurs in the sexual part of a mother, or sister, or daughter, and she
flees (fravê*d*) from a medical man, and there is no opportunity for him
to apply a seton (palîtŏ), and her father, or son, or brother is
instructed in similar surgery, which is more evil *in* appearance, when
they touch the part with the hand, and apply a seton, or *when* a
strange man *does so?*

'And, when *it* is desirable to effect their union, which is the less
remarkable (kam hû-zanâkhîktar) in evil appearance, when they are united
(hamdvâ*d*î-hênd) by them in secret, such as when the hearing of their
written *contract* (nipi*s*tŏ) of wifehood and husbandhood <span
id="fr_1539"></span>[2](#fn_1533.md) is accomplished in the back*ground*
(dar pû*s*tŏ), or when the sound of drums and trumpets acquaints the
whole district, where

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

these people are renowned, that such an Arûman <span
id="fr_1540"></span>[1](#fn_1534.md) intends to effect such a purpose with
the daughter, sister, or mother of such a Pârsî man?

'On this account of less evil appearance is even the good appearance
which is to be mutually practised; and after the mode is seen, even the
advantageousness in the accomplishment of the daily duty of concealing
disgrace, the mutual desire, the mutual advantage and harm, and the
contentment *which arise* as to whatever has happened are also mutual
assistance. Some, with a husband and faint-heartedness, *have* a
disposition (*s*ânŏ) of incapability, and the diligence which is in
their reverence of the husband, who is ruler of the family (bûnag shah),
is *due* even *to* the supremacy which he would set over them through
the severity of a husband. Very many others, too, who are strange women,
are not content with a custom (va*g*) of this description; for they
demand even ornaments to cover *and* clothe the bold *and* active
*ones*, and slaves, dyes, perfumes, extensive preparations, and many
other things of house-mistresses which are according to their desire,
though *it* is not possible they should receive *them*. And, if *it* be
not possible, they would not accept retrenchment; and, if they should
not accept retrenchment, it hurries *on* brawling, abuse, and ugly words
about this, and even uninterrupted falsehood (avisistak-i*k* zûr) is
diffused as regards it; of the secrets, moreover, *which* they conceal
they preserve night and day a bad representation, and unobservantly.
They shall take the bad *wife* to

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

the house of *her* father and mother, the husband is dragged to the
judges, *and* they shall form a district assembly (shat*r*ô angê*z*ŏ)
about it. And lest he *should* speak thus: "I will release *her* from
wifehood *with* me <span id="fr_1541"></span>[1](#fn_1535.md)," vice and
fraud of many kinds *and* the misery of deformity are the faults which
are also secretly attributed to him.

'A wife of those three classes <span id="fr_1542"></span>[2](#fn_1536.md)
is to be provided, since they would not do even one of *these*
things <span id="fr_1543"></span>[3](#fn_1537.md); on which account, even
through advantageousness, virtuous living, precious abundance, dignity,
and innocence, mutual labour is manifestly mighty *and* strong.

'And if it be said that, "with all this which you explain, there is
also, afterwards, a depravity (darvakh) which is hideous," it should be
understood in the mind that hideousness and beauteousness are specially
those *things* which *do* not *exist* in themselves, but through some
one's habit of taking *up* an opinion and belief. The hideous children
of many are in the ideas of procreation exceedingly handsome, and the
handsome forms of many are in the ideas of a housekeeper (khânŏpânŏ)
exceedingly ugly. We consider him also as *one* of our enemies when any
one walks naked in the country, *which* you consider hideous; *but* the
naked skins of

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

the country call *him* handsome whose garments, which seem to them
hideous, have fallen *off*. And we are *they* in whose ideas a nose
level with the face is ugly, *but they* who account a prominent nose
ugly, and say it is a walling *that* reaches between the two eyes,
remain selecting a handsome *one* <span
id="fr_1544"></span>[1](#fn_1538.md). And concerning handsomeness and
ugliness in themselves, which are only through *having* taken *up* an
opinion and belief, *there* is a change even through time and place; for
*any* one of the ancients whose head *was* shaved was *as it were* ugly,
and it was so settled by law that *it was* a sin worthy of death for
them <span id="fr_1545"></span>[2](#fn_1539); then its habits (*s*ânŏ.md)
did not direct the customs of the country to shave the head of a man,
*but* now there is a sage who has considered *it* as handsome *and* even
a good work. Whoever is not clear that *it* is hideous is to think,
about something threatening (girâî), that *it* is even so not in itself,
but through *what is* taken into themselves they consider that *it* is
hideous.

'Then for us the good work of that thing <span
id="fr_1546"></span>[3](#fn_1540.md), *of* which *it* is cognizable that it
is so ordained by the creator, has *its* recompense; it is the protector
of the race, *and* the family is more perfect; *its* nature

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

is without vexation (apî*z*âr) and gathering affection, an advantage to
the child--the lineage *being* exalted--gathering (a*v*ar*k*ûn) hope,
offspring, and pleasure *it* is sweetness *to* the procreator, and the
joy is most complete; less is the harm *and* more the advantage, little
the pretence and much the skill of the graceful blandishments (nâz*â*nŏ)
which are apparent, aiding and procuring assistance (ban*g*isnŏ),
averting disaster, and conducting affairs; less is the fear, through
itself is itself illustrious, and the steadfast shall abandon crime
(*k*am). And all our fathers and grandfathers, by whom the same practice
*was* lawfully cherished, maintained *it* handsomely in *their* homes;
and to think of mankind only as regards some assistance is the
enlightenment of the steadfast, a reason which is exhibiting the
evidence of wisdom, that no practice of it <span
id="fr_1547"></span>[1](#fn_1541.md) is not expedient.

'And if it be said that the law <span id="fr_1548"></span>[2](#fn_1542.md)
*has* afterwards commanded as regards that *custom* thus: "Ye shall not
practise *it!*" every one who is cognizant of that command is to
consider *it* current; *but* we are not cognizant of that command, and
*by* an intelligent *person* (khapârvârakŏ) this should also be seen
minutely, through correct observation, that all the knowledge of men has
arisen from Khvêtûk-das. For knowledge is generated by the union of
instinctive wisdom and acquired wisdom <span
id="fr_1549"></span>[3](#fn_1543.md); instinctive wisdom is the female,
*and* acquired wisdom the male; and on this account, since both are an
achievement by the creator, they are sister and brother. And

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

also of everything worldly the existence, maturing, *and* arrangement
are due to union in proportion; water, which is female, and fire, which
is male <span id="fr_1550"></span>[1](#fn_1544.md), are accounted sister
*and* brother in combination, and they seem as *though one* restrains
*them* from Khvêtûk-das, unless, through being dissipated
themselves <span id="fr_1551"></span>[2](#fn_1545.md), seed--which is
progeny--arises therefrom; *and* owing to a mutual proportionableness of
water and fire is the power in the brain, for if the water be more it
rots *it* away, *and* if the fire be more it burns *it* away.'

This elaborate defence of Khvêtûk-das shows clearly that, at the time it
was written (about a thousand years ago), that custom was understood to
include actual marriages between the nearest relatives, although those
between first cousins appear to be also referred to.

In the 195th <span id="fr_1552"></span>[3](#fn_1546.md) chapter of the
third book of the Dînka*rd* we are told that the eighth of the ten
admonitions, delivered to mankind by Zaratû*s*t, was this:--'For the
sake of much terrifying of the demons, and much lodgment of the blessing
of the holy <span id="fr_1553"></span>[4](#fn_1547.md) in one's body,
Khvêtûk-das is to be practised.'

And the following chapter informs us, that 'opposed to that admonition
of the righteous Zaratû*s*t, of practising Khvêtûk-das for the sake of
much terrifying

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

of the demons from the body of man, and the lodgment of the blessing of
the holy in the body, the wicked wizard Akhtŏ <span
id="fr_1554"></span>[1](#fn_1548.md), the enemy of the good *man* on
account of the perplexing living which *would arise* from his practising
Khvêtûk-das, preferred not practising Khvêtûk-das.'

The practice is also mentioned in the 287th chapter of the same book, in
the following passage:--'The welfare of the aggregate of one's own
limb-formations--those which *exist* through no labour of one's own,
*and* have not come to the aid of those not possessing *them*
(anaf*s*manân) owing to their own want of gratitude--even *one* of a
previous formation *has* to eulogize suitably; *and* this which *has*
come, completely establishing (spôr-nih) the Avesta, *one* calls equally
splendid, by the most modestly comprehensive appellation *of*
Khvêtûk-das.'

In the sixth book of the Dînka*rd*, which professes to be a summary of
the opinions of those of the primitive faith <span
id="fr_1555"></span>[2](#fn_1549.md), we are told that, 'when the good work
of Khvêtûk-das shall diminish, darkness will increase and light will
diminish.'

In the seventh book of the Dînka*rd*, which relates the marvels of the
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, we are informed that it was 'recounted
how--Gâyômar*d* <span id="fr_1556"></span>[3](#fn_1550.md) *having* passed
*away--it was* declared secondly, as regards worldly *beings*, to Masyê
and Masyâôê <span id="fr_1557"></span>[4](#fn_1551.md), the first progeny
of Gâyômar*d*, by the word of Aûha*r*ma*zd*--that is, he spoke to them
when they

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

were produced by him--thus: "You are the men I produce, you are the
parents of all bodily life, and so you men shall not worship the demons,
for the possession of complete mindfulness <span
id="fr_1558"></span>[1](#fn_1552.md) *has been* perfectly supplied to you
by me, so that you *may* quite full-mindfully observe duty and decrees."
And the creativeness of Aûha*r*ma*zd* *was* extolled by them, and they
advanced in diligence; they also performed the will of the creator,
*they* carved (parkâvînî*d*ŏ) advantage *out of* the many duties of the
world, *and* practised Khvêtûk-das through procreation *and* the union
and complete progress of the creations in the world, which are the best
good works of mankind.'

The following passage also occurs in the same book:--'Then Zaratû*s*t,
on becoming exalted, called out unto the material world of righteousness
to extol righteousness and downcast are the demons; and, "homage *being*
the Ma*zd*a-worship of Zaratû*s*t, the ceremonial and praise of the
archangels are the best for you, I assert; and, *as to* deprecation
(aya*z*i*s*nîh) of the demons, Khvêtûk-das is even the best intimation,
so that, from the information which is given *as to* the trustworthiness
of a good work, the greatest is the most intimate of them, *those of*
father *and* daughter, son *and* she who bore *him* <span
id="fr_1559"></span>[2](#fn_1553.md), and brother *and* sister."*It is*
declared that, upon those words, innumerable demon-worshipping Kîks and
Karaps <span id="fr_1560"></span>[3](#fn_1554) disputed (sâri*s*i*d*ŏ.md)
with Zaratû*s*t and strove for his death, just like this which
revelation states:--"It is then the multitude clamoured (mar ba*r*â
vîrâ*d*) who are in the vicinity of the seat of Tûr, the

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

well-afflicting <span id="fr_1561"></span>[1](#fn_1555.md) holder of
decision; and the shame of the brother of Tûr arose, like *that of* a
man whose shame *was* that they spoke of his Khvêtûk-das so that he
might perform it. This Tûr *was* Tûr-î Aûrvâîtâ-sang <span
id="fr_1562"></span>[2](#fn_1556.md), the little-giving, *who* was like a
great sovereign of that quarter; and he maintained many troops and
*much* power. And the multitude told him they would seize the great
*one* from him who is little <span id="fr_1563"></span>[3](#fn_1557.md).
*But* Tûr-î Aûrvâîtâ-sang, the little-giving *and* well-afflicting,
*spoke* thus:--'*Should* I thereupon smite him, this great *one* who
mingles together those propitious words for us--where we are thus
without doubt *as to* one thing therein, such as Khvêtûk-das, that it is
not necessary to perform *it*--it would make us ever doubtful that it
*might* be necessary to perform it.' . . . . And Zaratû*s*t spoke to him
thus: 'I am not always that reserved speaker, by whom that I *have*
mentioned is the most propitious *thing* to be obtained; and inward
speaking and managing the temper are a Khvêtûk-das <span
id="fr_1564"></span>[4](#fn_1558.md), and the high-priest *who has*
performed *it* is to perform the ceremonial.'"' This passage attributes
to Zaratû*s*t himself the enforcement of next-of-kin marriage, but it is
hardly necessary to point out that the Dînka*rd* only records a
tradition to that effect; which

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

record may be quoted as evidence of the former existence of such a
tradition, but not as testimony for its truth. It is also worthy of
notice that this tradition clearly shows that such marriages were
distasteful to the people in general but this might naturally be
inferred from the efforts made by religious writers to assert the
extraordinary merit of Khvêtûk-das, because customs which are popular
and universal require no such special recommendation from the
priesthood.

In the Dâ*d*istân-î Dînîk (XXXVII, 82, LXIV, 6, LXV, 2, LXXVII, 4, 5)
allusions are made to the Khvêtûdâ*d* <span
id="fr_1565"></span>[1](#fn_1559.md) of brother and sister, formed by the
progenitors of mankind. We are also told that Khvêtûdâ*d* is to be
practised till the end of the world, and that to occasion it among
others is an effectual atonement for heinous sin <span
id="fr_1566"></span>[2](#fn_1560) (Dd. LXXVII, 6, 7, LXXVIII, 19.md); but
it is not certain that the term is applied in these latter passages to
marriages between the *nearest* relatives.

For later particulars about Khvêtûk-das we have to descend to the
darkest ages of Ma*zd*a-worship, those in which the Rivâyats, or records
of religious legends, customs, and decisions, began to be compiled. Of
the earlier Rivâyats, such as the Shâyast Lâ-shâyast and Vi*g*irka*rd*-î
Dînîk, which were written in Pahlavi, few remain extant; but the later
ones, written in Persian, are more numerous and very voluminous.

A Pahlavi Rivâyat, which precedes the Dâ*d*istân-î Dînîk in many MSS. of
that work, devotes several

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

pages to the subject of Khvêtûdâ*d*, which fully confirm the statements
of the defender of the practice, quoted above from the Dînka*rd* (III,
lxxxii). The age of this Pahlavi Rivâyat is quite uncertain; it is found
in MSS. written in the sixteenth century, but, as it does not mention
the marriage of first cousins, it was probably compiled at a much
earlier period, more especially as it is written in fairly grammatical
Pahlavi. The following extracts will be sufficient to show how far it
confirms the statements of the Dînka*rd*:--

'Of the good works of an infidel this is the greatest, when he comes out
from the habit of infidelity into the good religion; and of *one* of the
good religion, remaining backward (akha*r*-mân) *at* the *time* when his
ritual is performed, this is a great good work, when he performs a
Khvêtûdâ*d*; for through that Khvêtûdâ*d*, which is so valuable a token
of Ma*zd*a-worship, is the destruction of demons. And of Aûha*r*ma*zd*
*it* is declared, as regards the performance of Khvêtûdâ*d*, that, when
Zaratû*s*t sat before Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_1567"></span>[1](#fn_1561.md), and Vohûman, Ar*d*avahi*s*t,
Shatvaî*r*ô, Ho*r*vada*d*, Ame*r*ôda*d*, and Spenda*r*ma*d* <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[2](#fn_1562.md) sat around Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and
Spenda*r*ma*d* sat by his side, she had also laid a hand on his neck,
*and* Zaratû*s*t asked Aûha*r*ma*zd* about it thus: "Who is this *that*
sits beside thee, and thou wouldst be such a friend to her, and she also
would be such a friend to thee? Thou, who art Aûha*r*ma*zd*, turnest not
*thy* eyes away from her, and she turns not away

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

from thee; thou, who art Aûha*r*ma*zd*, dost not release her from *thy*
hand, and she does not release thee from *her* hand <span
id="fr_1569"></span>[1](#fn_1563.md)." And Aûha*r*ma*zd* said: "This is
Spenda*r*ma*d*, who is my daughter, the house-mistress of my heaven, and
mother of the creatures  <span id="fr_1570"></span>[2](#fn_1564.md)."
Zaratû*s*t spoke thus: "When they say, in the world, this is a very
perplexing thing, how is it proclaimed by thee--thee who art
Aûha*r*ma*zd*--for thee *thyself?*" Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "O
Zaratû*s*t! this should have become the best-enjoyed thing of mankind.
When, since my original creation, Mâharîyâ *and* Mâharîyâôîh <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[3](#fn_1565.md) had performed it, you, also, should
have performed it; because although mankind *have* turned away *from*
that thing <span id="fr_1572"></span>[4](#fn_1566.md), yet they should not
have turned away. Just as Mâharîyâ *and* Mâharîyâôîh had performed
Khvêtûdâ*d*, mankind should have performed it, *and* all mankind would
have known their own lineage and race, *and* a brother would never be
deserted by the affection of his brother, *nor* a sister *by that* of
her sister. For all nothingness, emptiness <span
id="fr_1573"></span>[5](#fn_1567.md), and drought *have* come unto mankind
from the deadly *one* (mar), when men have come to them from a different
country, from a different town, *or* from a different district, and
*have* married their women; and when they shall have carried away their
women, and they have

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

wailed together about this, thus: 'They will always carry our daughters
into perversion <span id="fr_1574"></span>[1](#fn_1568.md).'"

'This, too, *is said*, that Khvêtûdâ*d* is so miraculous that *it* is
the preservation of the most grievous sin--such as witchcraft and *that*
worthy of death--from hell. And the want of protection (a*v*îpâharîh)
from hell *of one* unprotected from Aharman and the demons arises at
that time when, owing to what *occurs* when *he* is begged by *some* one
to exercise witchcraft, *he* is made worthy of death. And when they
shall perform Khvêtûdâ*d*, when the Khvêtûdâ*d* is owing to him <span
id="fr_1575"></span>[2](#fn_1569.md), the unprotected *one* is preserved
from the prison of hell, *from* Aharman *and* the demons; so miraculous
is Khvêtûdâ*d*.

'*In* a passage *it* is declared, that Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke unto
Zaratû*s*t thus: "These are the best four things: the ceremonial worship
of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord; presenting firewood, incense, and holy-water
*to* the fire; propitiating a righteous man <span
id="fr_1576"></span>[3](#fn_1570.md); and *one* who performs Khvêtûdâ*d*
with her who bore *him*, or a daughter, or with a sister. And of all
those he is the greatest, best, and most perfect who shall perform
Khvêtûdâ*d*. . . . When Sôshâns comes <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[4](#fn_1571.md) all mankind *will* perform
Khvêtûdâ*d*, and every fiend will perish through the miracle and power
of Khvêtûdâ*d*.'

It is then explained why the several merits of the

<span id="page_418">p. 418</span>

three classes of Khvêtûdâ*d* are considered to stand in the same order
as that in which the classes are mentioned in the preceding paragraph;
also that the third class includes the case of half brothers and
sisters, and the second that of an illegitimate daughter. After this we
find the following legend:--

And Khvêtûdâ*d* is so miraculous, that *it* is declared, regarding
Yim <span id="fr_1578"></span>[1](#fn_1572.md), that, when the glory *of*
his sovereignty had departed from him, he went out to the precincts
(var) of the ocean with Yimak, his sister, *in order* to flee from the
people, demons, and witches of the assembly of Dahâk  <span
id="fr_1579"></span>[2](#fn_1573.md). And *they were* sought by them in
hell and not seen; and others sought them among mankind, water, earth,
and cattle, among trees, in the mountains, and in the towns, *but they
were* not seen by them. Then Aharman shouted thus: "I think thus, that
Yim is travelling in the precincts of the ocean." And a demon and a
witch, *who* stood among *them, spoke* thus: "We *will* go and seek
Yim." And they rushed *off and* went; and when they came unto those
precincts where Yim was--the precincts *where* the water of Tîr <span
id="fr_1580"></span>[3](#fn_1574.md) was--Yim spoke thus: "Who are

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

you?" And they spoke thus: "We are those who are just like thee, who had
to flee from the hands of the demons; we, too, have fled away from the
demons, and we are alone. Do thou give this sister in marriage to me,
while I also give this *one* unto thee!" And Yim, therefore, when the
demons were not recognised by him from mankind, made the witch his own
wife, and gave his sister unto the demon *as* wife. From Yim and that
witch were born the bear, the ape, Gandarep <span
id="fr_1581"></span>[1](#fn_1575.md), *and* Gŏsûbar <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[2](#fn_1576.md); *and* from Yimak and that demon were
born the tortoise (gasaf), the cat, the hawk (gavin*g*), the frog, the
weevil (dîvakŏ), and also as many more noxious creatures, until Yimak
saw that that demon was evil, and it was necessary to demand a divorce
(zan-ta*k*â) *from* him. And one day, when Yim *and* that demon had
become drunk with wine, she exchanged her own position and clothing with
those of the witch; and when Yim came he was drunk, *and* unwittingly
lay with Yimak, who was his sister, and they came to a decision *as to*
the good work of Khvêtûdâ*d*; many demons were quite crushed *and* died,
and they rushed away at once, and fell back to hell.'

The fact, that the zealous writer felt that he had to force his opinions
upon an unwilling people, is betrayed by the exaggerated language he
uses in the following statements:--

'This, too, is declared by the Avesta, that Zaratû*s*t enquired of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: "Many thoughts, many words, *and* many deeds are
mentioned by

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

thee--thee who art Aûha*r*ma*zd*--that it is necessary to think, speak,
and do; of all *such* thoughts, words, *and* deeds which is the best,
when *one* shall think, speak, *or* do it?" Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus:
"Many thoughts, *many* words, *and* many deeds should be proclaimed by
me, O Zaratû*s*t! *but*, of those thoughts, words, *and* deeds *which*
it is necessary to think, speak, *and* do, that which is best and most
perfect *one* performs by Khvêtûdâ*d*. For *it* is declared that, the
first time when he goes near to it, a thousand demons will die, and two
thousand wizards *and* witches; when he goes near *to* it twice, two
thousand demons will die, *and* four thousand wizards and witches; when
he goes near to *it* three times, three thousand demons will die, *and*
six thousand wizards *and* witches; *and* when he goes near to it four
times *it* is known *that* the man and woman become righteous <span
id="fr_1583"></span>[1](#fn_1577.md)."

'. . . . Owing to the performance of Khvêtûdâ*d* *there* arises a
destruction of demons equivalent *to* a stoppage of creation; and
though, afterwards, *some* of those men *and* women shall become
wizards, *or* unlawfully slaughter a thousand sheep and beasts *of
burden* at one time, *or* shall present holy-water to the demons, *yet*,
on account of that destruction *and* vexation of the demons, which has
occurred to them owing to the Khvêtûdâ*d*, it does not become
comfortable to them while completed; and *it* is not believed by them
that "the souls of those *people* will come to us."

'Whoever keeps one year in a marriage of Khvêtûdâ*d*

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

becomes just as though one-third of all this world, with the water, with
the trees, and with the corn, had been given by him, as a righteous
gift, unto a righteous man. When he keeps two years in the marriage *it*
is as though two-thirds of this world, with the water, trees, *and*
corn, had been given by him unto a righteous man. When he keeps three
years in the marriage *it* is as though all this world, with the water,
with the trees, *and* with everything, had been given *by him*, as a
righteous gift, unto a righteous man. *And* when he keeps four years in
his marriage, and his ritual <span id="fr_1584"></span>[1](#fn_1578.md) is
performed, *it* is known *that his* soul thereby goes unto the supreme
heaven (garô*d*mân); *and* when *the ritual is* not *performed*, it goes
thereby to *the ordinary* heaven (vahi*s*tŏ).

'Zaratû*s*t enquired of Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: "*As to* the man who
*practises* Khvêtûdâ*d*, and his ritual is performed, *and* he also
offers a ceremonial (ya*zis*nŏaê), is the good work of it such as *if
one* without Khvêtûdâ*d* *had* offered *it, or* which way is it?"
Aûha*r*ma*zd* said: "*It* is just as though a hundred men without
Khvêtûdâ*d* had offered it."

'Zaratû*s*t enquired this, also, of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, that is: "How is the
benediction (âf*rî*nô) which a man who *practises* Khvêtûdâ*d* shall
offer?" Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "As though a hundred men without
Khvêtûdâ*d* *should* offer the benediction."

'And this, too, *was* asked by him, that is: "*As to* them who render
assistance, *and one* meditates and attains to Khvêtûdâ*d* *through*
them, *and one* 

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

performs Khvêtûdâ*d* on account of their statements, how is *their* good
work?" Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "Like *his* who keeps in food and
clothing, *for* one winter, a hundred priests--each of which priests has
a hundred disciples--*such* is his good work."

'Zaratû*s*t enquired this, also, of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, that is: "*As to*
them who keep a man back *from* performing Khvêtûdâ*d*, *and* owing to
their statements he shall not perform Khvêtûdâ*d*, what is their sin?"
*Aûha*r*ma*zd *spoke* <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1](#fn_1579.md) thus:
"*Their* place is hell."

'*In* a passage *it* is declared that, wiser than the wise, *and* more
virtuous than the virtuous is *he* in whose thoughts, words, *and* deeds
the demons are less predominant; *and* Aharman *and* the demons are less
predominant in the body of him who *practises* Khvêtûdâ*d*, and his
ritual <span id="fr_1586"></span>[2](#fn_1580.md) is performed.

'*It* is declared by revelation that *at* the *time* when Zaratû*s*t
came out from the presence of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord, into a worldly
place where he travelled, he spoke this, that is: "Extol the religion!
*and* you should perform Khvêtûdâ*d*. I speak of the good and those
existing *in* the religion; *as to* the negligent, the vile, and those
in perplexity, this is said, that a thing so wondrous *and* important
*as that* which is in our law *of* Khvêtûdâ*d* could not be for
performance. This is a sublime (kîrag) custom, *and*, as the best of all
things, *one* asserts that it is necessary to perform it. *To* me, also,
this is manifest when, through all faith *in* the law *of* those
existing *in* the religion <span id="fr_1587"></span>[3](#fn_1581.md), that
which is called by

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

them a very heinous sin, through faith *in* this law *of* the good, is
that which is called the most perfect *and* best good work of
Ma*zd*a-worship."

'This, too, is declared by revelation, that Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke unto
Zaratû*s*t thus: "You should cause the performance of duties *and* good
works." And Zaratû*s*t spoke thus: "Which duty *and* good work *shall* I
do first?" Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "Khvêtûdâ*d*; because that duty
*and* good work is to be performed in the foremost place of all, for, in
the end, it happens through Khvêtûdâ*d*, when all who are in the world
attain unto the religion <span id="fr_1588"></span>[1](#fn_1582.md)."

'This, too, is declared by revelation, that Zaratû*s*t spoke unto
Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: In my eyes *it* is an evil (va*d*ŏ) which is
performed, and *it is* perplexing that I *should* make Khvêtûdâ*d* *as
it were* fully current among mankind." Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "In my
eyes, also, *it* is just as *in* thine; but for this reason--when out of
everything perfect *there* is *some* miserable evil <span
id="fr_1589"></span>[2](#fn_1583.md) for thee--it should not seem *so*. Do
thou be diligent in performing Khvêtûdâ*d*, and others, also, will
perform *it* diligently. '

The unpopularity of the practice advocated could hardly be more fully
admitted than in this last paragraph, nor the objection more
irrationally and dogmatically disposed of. As for the numerous
quotations, which the compiler of this Pahlavi Rivâyat

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

professes to take from the Parsi scriptures, it is hardly necessary to
remark that their authenticity must be accepted with great reserve.

Persian Rivâyats, copied in the seventeenth century, advocate the
marriage of first cousins, and allude vaguely to those between nearer
relatives as long extinct, though most of their remarks merely recommend
the performance of Khêdyôdath <span id="fr_1590"></span>[1](#fn_1584.md),
without explaining the meaning of the term. Thus, we are informed that a
person worthy of death can perform Khêdyôdath as a good work, but it is
better if followed by the Bareshnûm ceremony <span
id="fr_1591"></span>[2](#fn_1585.md). An unclean person can do the same,
but the Bareshnûm should precede the performance, so as to avoid sins
arising from the uncleanness. The performance also destroys demons,
wizards, and witches; and if arranged by any one, at his own expense,
for another person, it is as meritorious as if performed by himself. But
the following quotations are more descriptive of the practice <span
id="fr_1592"></span>[3](#fn_1586.md):--

'Again, whereas the great wisdom of the king and of the assembly of
priests fully understands that the ceremony of all the religious
rites <span id="fr_1593"></span>[4](#fn_1587.md) is a great good work,
besides that which is called Khêdyôdath, yet, in these days, both have
fallen out of *their* hands; but they will make an endeavour, so that
they may form connection with their own, and on account of

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

the Musulmâns the connection is a medium *one* <span
id="fr_1594"></span>[1](#fn_1588.md), better than that of an infidel. And
Ormazd has said that *by* as much as the connection is nearer *it is*
more of a good work; and they display *their* endeavour and effort, and
give the son of a brother and daughter of a brother *to* each other. And
just as this *is said*: I establish the *performer* of Khêdyôdath, I
establish the patrol of the country <span
id="fr_1595"></span>[2](#fn_1589.md)," even on this account they certainly
display an endeavour.

'Query:--"How are the connections that relations form?" Reply:--"A
brother's children with a brother's children and a sister's children,
and relations with one another form connections, *and* it is proper for
them."

*Kh*êdyôdath is *that* which is a great good work, and has fallen out of
their hands, owing to the reason that there is no king of the good
religion; and if it be so they will make an endeavour, and will form
connections with their own, and will give the son of a brother and
daughter of a brother to each other, and if not it is not proper; and
every such connection as is nearer is more of a good work. And the mode
they will act who are at first without a king will be an infidel *one*,
and to form connections among themselves will be very difficult now he
(the king) is a Musulmân, *but* that which is nearer is better and more
of a good work.'

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

These quotations indicate that a great change had crept over the meaning
of Khvêtûk-das since the dark ages of the Pahlavi Rivâyat, previously
quoted, although a tradition of the old meaning still lingered in the
minds of the writers. The modern meaning is, however, most completely
explained in a passage, appended to a Persian version of Aêshm's
complaint to Aharman, regarding the difficulty of destroying the effect
of the season-festivals, the sacred feast, and Khvetûk-das (Sls. XVIII).
After Aharman has confessed his inability to suggest a means of
destroying the merit of the last, the Persian writer adds the following
particulars:--

'Therefore it is necessary to understand, that the chief Khêtvadat is
that of a sister's daughter and brother's son; a medium Khêtvadat is
that of a brother's son and a younger brother's daughter, or of a
sister's son and a younger sister's daughter; and inferior to a medium
Khêtvadat is that of a sister's son and a younger brother's daughter. It
is necessary to know that any person, who performs Khêtvadat, if *his*
soul be *fit* for hell, will arrive among the ever-stationary <span
id="fr_1596"></span>[1](#fn_1590.md); if it be *one* of the ever-stationary
it will arrive at heaven. Another particular is to be added: if any one,
in departing, settles and strives for the connection of Khêtvadat of a
next brother it is a good work of a thousand Tanâpûhars <span
id="fr_1597"></span>[2](#fn_1591.md); if any one strives to break off the
connection of Khêtvadat he is worthy of death.'

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

With this quotation, which occurs in a MS. <span
id="fr_1598"></span>[1](#fn_1592.md) written A.D. 1723, we may conclude our
examination of all passages in the Parsi scriptures referring to
Khvetûk-das, the result of which may be summarized as follows:

First, the term does not occur at all in the oldest part of the Avesta,
and when it is mentioned in the later portion it is noticed merely as a
good work which is highly meritorious, without any allusion to its
nature; only one passage (Vend. VIII, 36) indicating that both men and
women can participate in it. So far, therefore, as can be ascertained
from the extant fragments of the Avesta--the only internal authority
regarding the ancient practices of Ma*zd*a-worship--the Parsis are
perfectly justified in believing that their religion did not originally
sanction marriages between those who are next of kin, provided they
choose to ignore the statements of foreigners, as based upon imperfect
information.

Second, when we descend to the Pahlavi translations and writings of the
better class, which, in their present form, probably range from the
sixth to the ninth century, we find many allusions to Khvêtûk-das
between those next of kin, and only one obscure reference to the
marriage of first cousins <span id="fr_1599"></span>[2](#fn_1593.md).
Marriages between the nearest relations are defended chiefly by
reference to mythical and metaphorical

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

statements regarding the creation, and to the practice of the
progenitors of mankind; they are also advocated with all the warmth and
vehemence that usually indicate much difficulty in convincing the laity,
and this zealous vehemence increases as we descend to the dark ages of
the Pahlavi Rivâyat <span id="fr_1600"></span>[1](#fn_1594.md), the
compilation of which may perhaps be attributed to some writer of the
thirteenth or fourteenth century. Unless, therefore, the Parsis
determine to reject the evidence of such Pahlavi works as the Pahlavi
Yasna, the book of Ar*d*â-Vîrâf, the Dînka*rd*, and the Dâ*d*istân-î
Dînîk, or to attribute those books to heretical writers, they must admit
that their priests, in the later years of the Sasanian dynasty, and for
some centuries subsequently, strongly advocated such next-of-kin
marriages, though, probably, with little success. That a practice now
reprobated by all Parsis should have been formerly advocated by their
priests, as a religious duty, need not excite the surprise of those who
consider how slavery has been advocated by many Christians, on
scriptural grounds, within the present generation, and how the execution
of supposed witches was similarly advocated a few generations ago.

Third, as we come to the modern writings of the Persian Rivâyats, which
may have commenced about the fifteenth century, we find the present form
of Khvêtûk-das, the marriage of first cousins (which was only slightly
mentioned in the Dînka*rd* of the ninth century), the only form in use;
though obscure allusions are made to the other forms as being long
extinct.

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

At whatever period the practice of next-of-kin marriage may have
originated there were evidently two reasons for its establishment and
continuance; one was the indispensable necessity of offspring <span
id="fr_1601"></span>[1](#fn_1595.md), unfettered by duties towards any
other family, for the purpose of maintaining the necessary periodical
ceremonies for the souls of those passed away; the other was the wish of
preventing any risk of religious perversion consequent upon marrying
into a family of strangers or infidels. Both of these reasons must have
become intensified as the Ma*zd*a-worshippers diminished in numbers,
hence the increasing vehemence of priestly advocacy, until the foreign
conquerors probably interfered, and put a stop to the practice.

That such marriages were not unusual among other races, in ancient
times, we learn from many tales in Greek and Roman mythology, from the
usual practice of the Greek dynasty of the Ptolemies in Egypt, and even
from the laws prohibiting such connections in Lev. xviii. 6-16, which,
as laws are not made to prohibit practices that do not exist, would
hardly have been written unless the children of Israel had at one time
adopted the custom to some slight extent. That Parsis now deny the
existence of such marriages among their ancestors proves that they no
longer approve the custom, but does not affect the historical evidence
of its former

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

existence. Christians no longer approve the persecution and execution of
women for the imaginary crime of witchcraft, but it would be both
childish and useless for them to deny that their ancestors committed
hundreds of such judicial murders less than two centuries ago.

<span id="fn_1488"></span>[392:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1494.md) The age of this
Pahlavi version of the Vi*s*tâsp Vast is doubtful, and it is even
possible that it may have been composed in India. The only MS. of it
that I have seen belongs to Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji, who kindly
gave me a copy of it, but seemed doubtful about-the age of the
translation. He was aware that his MS. was written some forty years ago,
but he did not know from what MS. it was copied. This version is,
however, mentioned in the list of Pahlavi works given in the
introduction to Dastûr Peshotanji's Pahlavi Grammar, pp. 18, 31, so that
another MS. of the Pahlavi text probably exists in the library of the
high-priest of the Parsis in Bombay.

<span id="fn_1489"></span>[392:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1495.md) Or, perhaps,
'man *and* wife;' as gab*r*â, 'man,' is occasionally used for 'husband,'
though shûî is the usual word, and nê*s*man means both 'woman' and
'wife.'

Khvêtvadas or Khvêtûdas in the very old MS. of Dastûr Jâmâspji
Minochiharji, the text of which is followed in this translation. The

translators.

<span id="fn_1491"></span>[392:4](sbe18125.htm#fr_1497.md) Spenda*r*ma*d*
apparently, as indicated by the sequel.

<span id="fn_1492"></span>[393:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1498.md) The Pahlavi
translator seems here to understand Vohûman not as the archangel (see
Dd. III, 3), but as a title ('good-minded') of the primeval man,
Gâyômar*d*, who is supposed to have been produced by Aûha*r*ma*zd* out
of the earth (compare Gen. ii. 7), represented by the female archangel
Spenda*r*ma*d*. The term vohû-manô is used in Vend. XIX, 69, 76-84 for
both a well-intentioned man and his clothing.

<span id="fn_1493"></span>[393:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1499.md) The female
archangel, a personification of the Avesta phrase spe*n*ta ârmaiti,
'bountiful devotion;' she has special charge of the earth and virtuous
women (see Bd. I, 26, Sls. XV, 20-24). She is called the daughter of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, even as the fire and Vohûman are called his sons, because
devotion (representing the earth), fire, and good thought are considered
to be his most important creations. And, as the earth is also,
metaphorically, the mother of man, and the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* is
figuratively his father, this unfortunate combination of
anthropomorphisms has induced later superstition to take these
statements literally, and to quote them as a justification of marriage
between father and daughter.

<span id="fn_1494"></span>[393:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1500.md) This seems the

<span id="fn_1504"></span>[396:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1510.md) 'Complete

<span id="fn_1507"></span>[397:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1513.md) The word
translated 'all' is the ordinary Huz. ko*l*â, equivalent <span
id="page_398">p. 398</span> to Pers. har, but a Parsi critic has
suggested that it ought to be read kanîk, 'virgin,' so as to get rid of
the idea that the sisters were married to Vîrâf. This suggestion is
ingenious, because the difference between ko*l*â and kanîk is very
slight, when written in Pahlavi characters; but it is not very
ingenuous, because the substitution of kanîk for kola, both here and in
the similar phrase at the end of the passage quoted in our text, would
render the sentences quite ungrammatical, as would be easily seen by any
well-educated Parsi who would translate the phrases literally into
modern Persian words, which would give him the following text: ân har
haft ‘*h*vâharân Vîrâf *k*ûn zan bûd and for the first phrase, and har
haft ‘*h*vâhar ân birâdar zanî êm for the second. To substitute any
Persian word for 'virgin' in place of the pronoun har, in these two
phrases, would evidently produce nonsense. The really doubtful point in
these phrases is whether zan and zanî are to be understood as 'wife' and
'wifehood,' or merely as 'woman' and 'womankind;' but it would be
unusual to use such terms for the unmarried female members of a family.

<span id="fn_1508"></span>[398:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1514.md) Or 'the

<span id="fn_1509"></span>[398:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1515.md) From a facsimile
of the only known MS. of the original Pahlavi <span id="page_399">p.

appears that its Pahlavi name was Dînâ-î Mînavad-î Khar*d* (or Maînôg-î

(see pp. [90](sbe18044.htm#page_90)-[102](sbe18044.htm#page_102.md) of the
English translation of his edition) differs considerably from that given
in our text. This difference may be partly owing to its being translated
from the Gu*g*arâti translation, and not direct from the original
Pahlavi; but it is chiefly due to the inevitable result of attempting a
free translation of difficult Pahlavi, without preparing a literal
version in the first place. The translation here given is as literal as
possible, but the Pahlavi text is too obscure to be yet understood with
absolute certainty in some places.

sentence; here it seems to have 'six' in ciphers, but the first cipher
can also be read aê, the conditional suffix to the verb which
immediately precedes the ciphers in the Pahlavi text, and the second
cipher is merely 'three,' which corresponds to the three possible kinds
of first cousins that are about to be detailed in the text.

<span id="fn_1531"></span>[404:5](sbe18125.htm#fr_1537.md) Reading 13, by
dividing the Pahlavi cipher for 'four' into two parts, both here and
near the end of the sentence. This paragraph can hardly be understood
otherwise than referring to the present form of Khvêtûk-das, the
marriage of first cousins.

<span id="fn_1532"></span>[405:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1538.md) Reading amat
instead of mûn, 'who,' (see Dd. LXII, 4 n.)

<span id="fn_1533"></span>[405:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1539.md) Showing that the
practice advocated was understood to be a regular marriage (performed in
private probably on account of the authorities being of a foreign faith)
and not any kind of irregular intercourse. It is here approvingly
contrasted with the noisy celebration of a marriage with a person of
foreign faith, in accordance with foreign customs.

<span id="fn_1534"></span>[406:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1540.md) A native of Asia
Minor, or any other part of the eastern empire of the Romans.

<span id="fn_1535"></span>[407:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1541.md) That is, lest he
should pronounce her divorce.

<span id="fn_1536"></span>[407:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1542.md) The three
nearest degrees of relationship must be meant, as the sequel admits the
possibility of the union being considered objectionable; otherwise, the
three kinds of first cousins might be understood.

<span id="fn_1537"></span>[407:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1543.md) As a special
pleader for marriage between near relations the apologist feels himself
bound to argue that all bad wives must have been strangers to the family
before marriage.

<span id="fn_1538"></span>[408:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1544.md) That is, those
who admire flat noses select their beauties accordingly. Beauty being
merely a matter of taste, which varies with the whim of the individual
and the fashion of the period.

<span id="fn_1539"></span>[408:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1545.md) This law was
evidently becoming obsolete at the time the apologist was writing, and
is now wholly forgotten. All Parsi laymen have their heads shaved at the
present time, although the priests merely have their hair closely cut.
This change of custom, in a matter settled by religious law, should warn
the Parsis not to deny the possibility of other complete alterations
having taken place in their religious customs.

<span id="fn_1540"></span>[408:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1546.md) Khvêtûk-das.

<span id="fn_1541"></span>[409:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1547.md) Khvêtûk-das.

<span id="fn_1542"></span>[409:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1548.md) Perhaps the law
of the foreign conquerors is meant.

<span id="fn_1543"></span>[409:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1549.md) See Dd. XXXVII,
35, XL, 3.

<span id="fn_1544"></span>[410:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1550.md) See Dd. XCIII,
13 n.

<span id="fn_1545"></span>[410:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1551.md) Into the forms
of moisture and warmth in the body. Water and fire in their ordinary
state being incapable of combination.

<span id="fn_1546"></span>[410:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1552.md) This will be the
193rd chapter in Dastûr Peshotanji's edition, because his numbers do not
commence at the beginning of the book. A similar difference will be
found in the numbering of all other chapters of the third book of the
Dînka*rd*.

<span id="fn_1547"></span>[410:4](sbe18125.htm#fr_1553.md) The technical
name of Yas.

<span id="fn_1548"></span>[411:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1554.md) Av. Akhtya of
Âbân Yt. 82, who propounded ninety-nine enigmas to Yôi*s*tô of the
Fryâns (see Dd. XC, 3).

<span id="fn_1549"></span>[411:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1555.md) See Dd. XCIV, 1
n.

<span id="fn_1550"></span>[411:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1556.md) The sole-created
man (see Dd. II, 10, XXXVII, 82).

<span id="fn_1551"></span>[411:4](sbe18125.htm#fr_1557.md) See p. 402, note
1.

<span id="fn_1552"></span>[412:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1558.md) See
[396](#page_396.md), note 2.

<span id="fn_1553"></span>[412:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1559.md) See
[400](#page_400.md), note 1.

<span id="fn_1554"></span>[412:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1560.md) See
[384](sbe18124.htm#page_384.md), note 1.

<span id="fn_1555"></span>[413:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1561.md) The word
hû-nô*s*akŏ is the Pahlavi equivalent of Av. hunu*s*tâ (Yas. L, 10, b),
but the meaning of both words is uncertain. This Tar seems to have been
more friendly to Zaratû*s*t than the Tûrânians were in general, but he
appears not to be mentioned in the extant Avesta.

<span id="fn_1556"></span>[413:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1562.md) As this epithet
has not been found in the extant Avesta, the reading is uncertain.

<span id="fn_1557"></span>[413:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1563.md) Meaning that
they demanded possession of Zaratû*s*t in an insolent manner.

<span id="fn_1558"></span>[413:4](sbe18125.htm#fr_1564.md) In a figurative
sense.

<span id="fn_1559"></span>[414:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1565.md) Another form of
the word Khvetûk-das (see [p. 390](#page_390).md).

<span id="fn_1560"></span>[414:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1566.md) This is also
stated in Sls. VII, 18.

<span id="fn_1561"></span>[415:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1567.md) As he is said to
have done in heaven, when receiving instruction in the religion.

<span id="fn_1562"></span>[415:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1568.md) The archangels
(see Dd. XLVIII, i n), of whom Spenda*r*ma*d* is said to be a female
(see p. 393, note 2).

<span id="fn_1563"></span>[416:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1569.md) This legend is
an instance of the close proximity of superstition to profanity, among
uneducated and imaginative people.

<span id="fn_1564"></span>[416:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1570.md) She being a
representative of the earth.

<span id="fn_1565"></span>[416:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1571.md) See [p.
402](#page_402.md), note 1.

<span id="fn_1566"></span>[416:4](sbe18125.htm#fr_1572.md) That is, from
marriage of the nearest relations, which is admitted, throughout these
extracts, to be distasteful to the people; hence the vehemence with
which it is advocated.

<span id="fn_1567"></span>[416:5](sbe18125.htm#fr_1573.md) Literally
'air-stuffing' (vâê-âkînîh).

<span id="fn_1568"></span>[417:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1574.md) This fear of
perversion to another faith was, no doubt, the real cause of the
vehement advocacy of family marriages by the priesthood.

<span id="fn_1569"></span>[417:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1575.md) That is, when he
has arranged the next-of-kin marriage of others, before his death.

<span id="fn_1570"></span>[417:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1576.md) That is, a
priest.

<span id="fn_1571"></span>[417:4](sbe18125.htm#fr_1577.md) Shortly before
the resurrection (see Dd. II, 10).

<span id="fn_1572"></span>[418:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1578.md) The third
sovereign of the world, after Gâyômar*d* (see Dd. II, 10). This legend
is also mentioned in Bd. XXIII, 1, as explaining the origin of the ape
and bear.

<span id="fn_1573"></span>[418:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1579.md) The foreign
king, or dynasty, that conquered Vim (see Dd. XXXVII, 97 n).

<span id="fn_1574"></span>[418:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1580.md) Evidently
intended for Tî*s*tar, a personification of the star Sirius, who is
supposed to bring the rain from the ocean (see Dd. XCIII, 1-17).
Strictly speaking Tîr is the planet Mercury, the opponent of Tî*s*tar,
whose name is given to the fourth month, and thirteenth day of the
month, in the Parsi year (see Bd. V, 1, VII, 2, XXVII, 24); but the
confusion between the two names is not uncommon in the later books
(comp. Sls. XXII, 13 with XXIII, 2).

<span id="fn_1575"></span>[419:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1581.md) See [p.
371](sbe18123.htm#page_371.md), note 3.

<span id="fn_1576"></span>[419:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1582.md) Not identified,
and the reading is, therefore, uncertain.

<span id="fn_1577"></span>[420:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1583.md) Or, as stated in
the Appendix to the Shâyast Lâ-shâyast (Sls. XVIII, 4), they '*will* not
become parted from the possession of Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the archangels.'

<span id="fn_1578"></span>[421:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1584.md) The proper
ceremonies after his death, or for his living soul during his lifetime
(see Dd. XXVIII, LXXXI).

<span id="fn_1579"></span>[422:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1585.md) The Pahlavi text
is imperfect.

<span id="fn_1580"></span>[422:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1586.md) See [p.
421](#page_421.md), note 1.

<span id="fn_1581"></span>[422:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1587.md) That is, the
general law of Ma*zd*a-worship, as distinguished from what he is
advocating as a peculiarly religious law sanctioned <span
id="page_432">p. 432</span> by the priests ('the good'). This is
evidently an admission that the practice advocated was contrary to the
ordinary laws of Ma*zd*a-worship itself.

<span id="fn_1582"></span>[423:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1588.md) As Pahlavi
writers expect them to do before the resurrection.

<span id="fn_1583"></span>[423:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1589.md) Reading va*d*ŏ-î
vêsht; but it may be '*something* is difficult and hard' (tang va
sakht).

<span id="fn_1584"></span>[424:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1590.md) The Persian form
of the word Khvetûk-das. It is also written Khetyôdath in some passages,
and Khêtvadat in others.

<span id="fn_1585"></span>[424:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1591.md) The great
ceremony of purification (see App. IV).

<span id="fn_1586"></span>[424:3](sbe18125.htm#fr_1592.md) The Persian
Rivâyat from which all this information has been extracted is M10 (fol.
50 a).

<span id="fn_1587"></span>[424:4](sbe18125.htm#fr_1593.md) See Dd. XLIV, 2
II.

<span id="fn_1588"></span>[425:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1594.md) This seems to be
an allusion to some interference of the Muhammadan government with
marriages of those next of kin. A similar allusion occurs in the next
paragraph but one, which, with most of this paragraph, is also found in
M7, fols. 229 b, 230 a.

<span id="fn_1589"></span>[425:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1595.md) This Avesta
quotation, from Visp. III, 18, 19, is as follows '*hv*aêtvadathem
âstâya, daNhâurvaêsem âstâya;' and the meaning of the last term is
uncertain.

<span id="fn_1590"></span>[426:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1596.md) See Dd. XX, 3.

<span id="fn_1591"></span>[426:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1597.md) See Dd. LXXVIII,
13. Geldner in his Studien zum Avesta, I, pp. 3-12, suggests that the
original meaning of Av. tanuperetha and peshôtanu was outcast;' but,
although these words are translated by Pahl. tanâpûhar, it is doubtful
whether this last <span id="page_427">p. 427</span> word be a mere
transcript of tanuperetha (which ought to have been tanûpûhar), or
whether it expresses the different idea of tan-apûhar, 'a person without
a bridge *to heaven*,' which might have been that adopted by the Pahlavi
translators of the Vendidâ*d*; an outcast in this world being very
liable to be considered as an outcast from the next.

<span id="fn_1592"></span>[427:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1598.md) M5, fols. 54,
55.

<span id="fn_1593"></span>[427:2](sbe18125.htm#fr_1599.md) In Dk. III,
lxxxii (see [p. 404](#page_404).md).

<span id="fn_1594"></span>[428:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1600.md) See pp.
[415](#page_415.md)-423.

<span id="fn_1595"></span>[429:1](sbe18125.htm#fr_1601.md) The oriental
feeling of such a necessity, for the mere purpose of perpetuating the
family, is abundantly manifested in the story of Lot's daughters (Gen.
xix. 30-38), which is related without reproval by its writer. Also by
the exceptional law requiring a man to marry his brother's wife, when
the brother has died childless (Deut. xxv. 5-10).
