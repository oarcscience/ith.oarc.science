### CHAPTER II.

1\. Then comes that itself <span id="fr_1082"></span>[1](#fn_1078.md) which
is dictated *in* the middle of your epistle, *and*, thereupon, it lays
hold of me, and, owing to its hellish gloom, pallid appearance, *and*
hellish effect, benediction is perplexedly dispensed by me in terror for
*my* heart *and* mind; I *have*, also, grievously repented, as regards
my own former arrangements in my warfare of violence--which *were*
undeceptive in the balance pertaining to Rashnû <span
id="fr_1083"></span>[2](#fn_1079.md)--of any real falsity of the
co-existent *one* <span id="fr_1084"></span>[3](#fn_1080.md) I *may* have
produced.

2\. *Responsible* for the malice *and* annoyance of unjust kinds which
are encountering *us* is the fiend of great strength, who is
unobserving, seductive, astute in evil, eager for causing annihilation
(ga*s*tokûn-varen), *and* full of deceit, so that *it* is possible for
him to render doubtful, *when* so deceived, even him who is most a
listener to essential righteousness, most desirous of steadfast truth,
most performing proper religious customs, most acquainted with good
ideas, most amazingly careful of *his* soul, most approved in the most
wounding hell-brought conflict, *and* most at home (khânagîktûm) in
truth of all kinds, *and* to show him a semblance of reality in
unreality, *and* of unreality in reality. 3. Just as even that
similitude which is mentioned in revelation thus: 'He intends
righteousness *and* considers

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

about it thus: "A good work is done by me," and he acquires
fiendishness--that is, it becomes a source of sin for him--who shall
bring forth water without holy-water to *one* contaminated by dead
matter (nas-hômand), or who shall bring *it* forth without holy-water on
a concealed *or* dark *place* in the night <span
id="fr_1085"></span>[1](#fn_1081.md).'

4\. And about this I *have* no doubt, that the wish of that spirit is
not coincident with righteousness, for it is realised, understood, *and*
known that, as regards his own *creatures, he* is not careful for the
proper movement of body and for the long living of life; so that the
furtherance *and* continuance of these, which are his original resources
of body and activities (khapârânŏ) of life, become, for him who is among
them (the fiend's creatures), an increase of the propitiation of the
sacred beings, of the practice of religion, and of the advancement and
benediction of the teachings of just high-priests <span
id="fr_1086"></span>[2](#fn_1082.md). 5. *It* is also manifest from the
constantly-operating arrangement of manuscripts and synodical
statements, about which Afarg <span id="fr_1087"></span>[3](#fn_1083.md)
*wrote* without falsifying the religion *and* apart from controversies;
because among them (the fiend's creatures) is *he* who *has* said they
are like unto that which is now written

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

by him himself about it, and it has arranged much deliverance *from
sin* <span id="fr_1088"></span>[1](#fn_1084.md).

6\. Of this, too, I am aware, that, except there where a purifier is in
no way reached, his great duty--which is just the purification *in*
which there is a washer who is cleansed (masî*d*ô) in the religious mode
for the profession of the priesthood--is then a means which the
high-priests should allow <span id="fr_1089"></span>[2](#fn_1085.md). 7. A
washing which is not religiously ritualistic is ranked as an operation
among the useless *ones; it is* vicious *and* grievously criminal,
because the special means which, by preserving the soul <span
id="fr_1090"></span>[3](#fn_1086.md), is the perfect happiness of men, is
the purification

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

of men. 8. *It* is said <span id="fr_1091"></span>[1](#fn_1087.md): 'The
purification of men cleansingly is a something (aîtŏ) for the soul that
should be after perfect birth; when they have been fully born the
purification of others is the one thing which is good for the soul.'

9\. And it is shown *in* another place that it is possible to obtain
possession of purification also for the soul through purification of the
body, even as it is said that a purifier is requested by him. to. And it
is necessary for him to speak thus: 'I have thus stood close by the body
of him who is dead; I am no wisher *for it* by thought, I am no wisher
*for it* by word, I am no wisher *for it* by deed; which is the
reason--that is, on account of pollution--it is not possible to seek
good works by thought, word, *or* deed, *and* it demands purification
for me, that is, wash me thoroughly <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[2](#fn_1088.md)!' 11. As it is thereby declared that
when he whose body is not purified, until they thoroughly wash him, is
not able to seek good works by thought, word, *or* deed, and is not able
to purify his soul, it is then a matter for the truly wise *to seek*
even for purification of the soul by the purification of the body, *for*
whose religious purification are those *things* which are unsubdued
(a*s*ikand) in the religious ritual.

12\. When these are thus the statements of former upholders of the
religion *and* high-priests of the religion, he who is more intelligent
*and* more active

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

in the religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers in every house, village,
tribe, and province--*and*, very much more the man who is righteous, of
fluent speech, speaking the truth, who *has* chanted the *sacred* hymns,
acquainted with the ritual, trained for the work, of renowned
disposition, and a friend of the soul--is *competent* for the
purification which *it* is very important to prepare, to think of, *and*
to promote.

13\. When the period is so unworthy, the fiend so abundantly
contentious, and the hasty preparer of holy-water of such base origin
(dû*s*-vêkh) <span id="fr_1093"></span>[1](#fn_1089.md)--which *happens*,
moreover, when the good are equally low-minded (ham-bâstŏ-mînisnŏ)--we
strive for *what* encourages the preparation of that even which is a
collectively virtuous profession. 14. Then, too, *there* remains such
rising in strength of many new *things* from very many countries, which
is particularly grievous distress and danger to us; they deliver tokens
*of them* to us applaudingly, *and* the expansibility of the words of
the delivering diffuser of these and also other religious customs, as
the sacred beings' own persistency and complete glory, is a great *and*
powerful capability.

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[282:2](sbe18103.htm#fr_1083.md) See Dd. XIV, 4.

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[282:3](sbe18103.htm#fr_1084.md) The evil spirit
who is supposed to be, for a time, co-existent with the beneficent
spirit of Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[283:1](sbe18103.htm#fr_1085.md) Quoted from
Pahl. Vend. VII, 194-196, with some slight variations from the existing
text. The meaning is that it is quite possible to commit sin by doing a
good action in an improper manner.

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[283:2](sbe18103.htm#fr_1086.md) That is, even
the wicked, when they seek welfare, have to take to religious practices.

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[283:3](sbe18103.htm#fr_1087.md) A commentator
whose opinions are frequently quoted in the Pahlavi translations of the
Avesta (see Sls. I, 3). J has 'about which the splendour (afrand) of the
religion is without falsehood.'

<span id="fn_1084"></span>[284:1](sbe18103.htm#fr_1088.md) That is, any one
who explains the scriptures in a new fashion to suit his own purposes,
which he thereby represents as beneficial, is merely carrying out the
wishes of the fiend, The author is here, referring to the heretical
teachings of his brother, regarding purification, which are further
described in the sequel.

<span id="fn_1085"></span>[284:2](sbe18103.htm#fr_1089.md) That is,
whenever a properly-qualified purifier is procurable, the priests should
require him to purify any one who happens to be defiled by contact with
dead matter by means of the Bareshnûm ceremony (see App. IV). It appears
from the sequel, and from Eps. II and III, that the heresy of
Zâ*d*-sparam consisted chiefly of a misinterpretation of Vend. VIII,
278-299 (see App. V), which passage directs that a man in the fields,
who has touched a corpse not yet eaten by dogs or birds, shall wash
himself fifteen times with bull's urine, that he shall then run to some
village, asking three different men on the way to cleanse him with the
proper ceremony, and if they decline they each take upon themselves a
share of the sin; when arrived at the village he shall ask a fourth time
to be cleansed, and if no one will perform the ceremony he must wash
himself with bull's urine and water in the ordinary manner, and shall be
clean. The erroneous teaching of Zâ*d*-sparam was that the fifteen
times' washing was sufficient, without the subsequent ceremonial
cleansing; and the object of these epistles was to combat that view of
the law.

<span id="fn_1086"></span>[284:3](sbe18103.htm#fr_1090.md) The ceremonial
purification is supposed to cleanse the soul, <span id="page_285">p.
285</span> whereas ordinary washing cleanses the body only, and is
spiritually useless.

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[285:1](sbe18103.htm#fr_1091.md) In Pahl. Vend.
V, 65, X, 35, being a translation of a quotation from the Gâthas or
sacred hymns (Yas. XLVII, 5, c).

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[285:2](sbe18103.htm#fr_1092.md) Quoted, with
some variation, from Pahl. Vend. VIII, 283, 284 (see App. V).

<span id="fn_1089"></span>[286:1](sbe18103.htm#fr_1093.md) This seems to be
an allusion to the unworthiness of some of the priests of the period
(compare Ep. II, i, 13; y, 14).
