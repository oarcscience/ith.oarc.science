### CHAPTER LXXVIII.

1\. *As to* the seventy-seventh question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: *As to* the nature of the heinousness *and* sinfulness of
committing adultery, *and* the worldly retribution specified *for it* in
revelation,

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

*will* you then direct *some one* to point out to us the modes <span
id="fr_849"></span>[1](#fn_846.md) of retribution for it?

2\. The reply is this, that it is adultery, heinous *and* vicious, which
first Dahâk *used* to commit, and *he* is known by the illicit
intercourse which *was* his desire with Va*d*ak <span
id="fr_850"></span>[2](#fn_847.md), who *was his* mother, in the life-time
of Aûrva*d*âsp <span id="fr_851"></span>[3](#fn_848.md), who *was* his
father, without <span id="fr_852"></span>[4](#fn_849.md) the authority of
Aûrva*d*âsp, who was the husband of Va*d*ak whose practising of sin,
unauthorisedly *and* injudiciously, *was* itself heinous *and* very
frequent. 3. And its modes *of* theft or spoliation are just as much
more heinous than other theft *and* spoliation as a man *and* that which
arises from his procreation of man are greater than the position of
property.

4\. One is this, that *it* is important to consider with steadfastness
the courtezan life of the adulteress *and* the bad disposition assuredly
*and* undoubtedly therein; she causes pillage unauthorisedly, and in
*her* practice, also, intercourse during menstruation, owing to *its*
resembling the burning of seed, is a frightful kind of handiwork
(dastô).

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

5\. One is this, that it may be *that* she becomes pregnant by that
intercourse, *and has* to commit on her child <span
id="fr_853"></span>[1](#fn_850.md) the murdering of progeny.

6\. One is this, that it may be in pregnancy, *by* her coming to
intercourse *with* another man, *that* the living child which is in her
womb has died through that intercourse.

7\. One is this, that it may he that she becomes pregnant by that
intercourse, *and* the pregnancy *having* given indications, through
shame or fear she swallows a drug <span id="fr_854"></span>[2](#fn_851.md)
\[and seeks a remedy, and murders the child in *her* womb.

8\. One is this, that it may\] be that a woman who is foreign or
infidel, and becomes pregnant by that intercourse, gives birth to a
child, *and* it has grown up with the child which is known *to belong
to* the husband of the woman, *and* remains in foreign habits (an-aîrîh)
or infidelity. 9. The committer of the illicit intercourse is as
unobservant and grievously sinful as *he* who shall lead *his* own child
from his native habits (aîrîh) and the goad religion into foreign habits
and infidelity; as to the sin which that child may commit in childhood
*he* is the sinner, and as to that which it may commit in manhood *he*
is equally sinful with it. 10. Also, if that child be put to death in
childhood, *and* be passed through water, rain, *or* fire, *or* be
buried in the well-yielding earth <span id="fr_855"></span>[3](#fn_852.md),
*he* is an equally vicious murderer, *and* is defiled thereby through
*being* the invisible causer.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

11\. Likewise, if he who is a man of the good religion accustoms a woman
to illicit intercourse, *and* through adultery a child is born and grows
up, even then to practise undutifully that which undutifulness committed
is to make a wretched *and* clandestine connection. 12. On account of
the birth *having* occurred through illicit intercourse *it* is
grievously sinful; through propriety *it* is praise*worthy*, and through
falsity *it* is sinful <span id="fr_856"></span>[1](#fn_853.md), *and* it
is said that a bastard is not appointed in superintendence over *any
one*. 13. *If* it be done so that pregnancy does not occur, even then
every single time--not to mention the text (a*v*istâk) *as to* the
matter regarding the destruction of his own living *seed* <span
id="fr_857"></span>[2](#fn_854.md)--*it* is *a sin of* two Tanâpûhars,
which are six hundred stîrs <span id="fr_858"></span>[3](#fn_855.md); and
regarding that emission *it* is inexpiable (atanâpûhar) <span
id="fr_859"></span>[4](#fn_856.md).

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

14\. As much on account of the conversation as on account of the
companionship *of* the man who goes unto various women, for the sake of
a man's sin, and is unatoning, *should* his own body be also defiled
with bodily refuse (hîgar-hômônd) <span id="fr_860"></span>[1](#fn_857.md),
or *should* those kinds of harm be not *kept* away from another <span
id="fr_861"></span>[2](#fn_858.md), even then every single time of the
bodily refuse bringing harm to his own body is *a sin of* sixty
stîrs <span id="fr_862"></span>[3](#fn_859.md), and through making his own
body defiled with bodily refuse is each *time a sin of* sixty stîrs; and
if he washes with water that defilement with his own bodily refuse, or
that which is harmed *thereby*, every single time *it* is *a sin of* six
hundred <span id="fr_863"></span>[4](#fn_860.md) stîrs.

15\. And if it be a foreign or infidel woman, apart from the sinfulness
*about* which *I have* written, *it* is a sin of sixty stîrs on account
of not controlling the sins *and* vicious enjoyment of the foreign
woman. 16. And, finally, the other various sins which are owing to
*this* sin are very numerous, *and* grievous to thousands of
connections, and *it* is thereby contaminating to them *in* a fearful
manner.

17\. The retribution is renunciation *of sin* in procuring pardon; and
the renunciation in his turning from equally grievous disobedience <span
id="fr_864"></span>[5](#fn_861.md), every single

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

time that *he turns* from similar viciousness, and as an atonement for
the sin, is to arrange, or order, four (arbâ) marriages of the next of
kin to his own wife, lawfully, authorisedly, and most hopeful of
offspring. 18. Through fear of the grievous sinfulness which *I have*
recounted, *in case of* a child of those of the good religion who has no
giver of shame <span id="fr_865"></span>[1](#fn_862.md), and to keep
lawfully in subjection a child who is under control, he who is
unnurtured is lawfully given nurture, *and* is nominated for lawfully
bringing up. 19. And to turn a man *or* woman of bad disposition, by
eulogy and entreaty, or <span id="fr_866"></span>[2](#fn_863.md) *by*
distress (fangîm) and fear and other representations, from that bad
disposition *and* vicious habit; to order next-of-kin marriage <span
id="fr_867"></span>[3](#fn_864.md) and all the religious rites (hamâk
dînô), the Dvâ*z*dah-hômâst <span id="fr_868"></span>[4](#fn_865.md), the
ceremony *in honour* of the waters <span
id="fr_869"></span>[5](#fn_866.md), and the *presentation of* holy-water to
the fires <span id="fr_870"></span>[6](#fn_867.md); to remove the burden of
offspring <span id="fr_871"></span>[7](#fn_868.md) which is distressing
those of the good religion, and to force them from the infidelity
acquired, which is a very atoning atonement for such sins, are extremely
proper proceedings (a*v*îr-farhakhtîkîh).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_846"></span>[228:1](sbe18085.htm#fr_849.md) M14 has 'the
various modes.'

<span id="fn_847"></span>[228:2](sbe18085.htm#fr_850.md) This is evidently
the name written Udaî in Pâz. in Bd. XXXI, 6, who was, therefore, the
*daughter* of Bayak; the fact of her being the mother of Dahâk is more
clearly expressed in the Pahlavi text of Chap. LXXII, 5.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[228:3](sbe18085.htm#fr_851.md) This is the name
written Khrûtâsp in Bd. XXXI, 6, which is a Pâz. reading, though
confirmed by the Pahl. form in TD (as Udaî is, to some extent, by the
Pahl. Aû*d* of TD). This Aûrva*d*âsp, whose name can also be read
Khûrûtâsp, must be distinguished from his namesake, the father of
Vi*s*tâsp, whose name became corrupted into Lôharâsp (see Bd. XXXI, 28,
29).

<span id="fn_849"></span>[228:4](sbe18085.htm#fr_852.md) K35 omits a*v*îk,
'without,' here, but has it in Chap. LXXII, 5. Without this particle the
meaning would be 'who *was* the high-priest of his father, Aûrva*d*âsp.'

<span id="fn_850"></span>[229:1](sbe18085.htm#fr_853.md) M14 has '*and*
with the assistance of another man *she has* so to commit on her child
of that pregnancy.' The interpolation is clumsy, and does not make the
sentence easier to translate.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[229:2](sbe18085.htm#fr_854.md) The passage which
follows, in brackets, is from M14; there being evidently something
omitted from K35 at this point.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[229:3](sbe18085.htm#fr_855.md) The contamination
of water, rain, fire, or earth, by contact with <span id="page_230">p.
230</span> a corpse, being considered a heinous sin (see Sls. II, 9, 50,
76, XIII, 19).

<span id="fn_853"></span>[230:1](sbe18085.htm#fr_856.md) That is, procuring
the birth of a legitimate child is highly meritorious, but an
illegitimate birth is sinful.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[230:2](sbe18085.htm#fr_857.md) Referring probably
to Vend. VIII, 77-82, which states that the voluntary waste of seed is
an inexpiable sin, as mentioned at the end of this section.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[230:3](sbe18085.htm#fr_858.md) A Tanâpûhar (Av.
tanuperetha) sin was originally one that required the sinner to place
his body at the disposal of the high-priest, in order to atone for it;
but it was not necessarily a sin worthy of death, or mortal sin. At the
time when the Vendidâ*d* was written, such a sin was punished by two
hundred lashes of a horse-whip or scourge (see Vend. IV, 72).
Subsequently, when the Vendidâ*d* scale of punishments was converted
into a scale of weights, for estimating the amounts of sins and good
works, a Tanâpûhar sin was estimated at three hundred stîrs (στατήρ) of
four dirhams (δραχμή, ) each (see Sls. I, 1, 2). The weight of 600 stîrs
was probably about that of 840 rûpîs, or 21 3/5 lbs. (see Chap. LII, r
n).

<span id="fn_856"></span>[230:4](sbe18085.htm#fr_859.md) That is, a sin
which cannot be atoned for even by giving up tae's body for execution.
Anâpûhar in Pahl. Vend. VIII, 82.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[231:1](sbe18085.htm#fr_860.md) See Chap. XLVIII,
19.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[231:2](sbe18085.htm#fr_861.md) M14 has 'or he
does not wash those harmful kinds of bodily refuse,' which is
inconsistent with what follows.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[231:3](sbe18085.htm#fr_862.md) This is the
estimated weight of a Khôr sin, originally the crime of inflicting a
severe hurt, ranging from a bruise to a wound or broken bone not
endangering life (see Sls. I, 1, 2). The weight was probably equal to
that of 84 rûpîs.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[231:4](sbe18085.htm#fr_863.md) M14 has 'three
hundred.'

<span id="fn_861"></span>[231:5](sbe18085.htm#fr_864.md) Reading asrû*s*tîh
as in M14, instead of the aîtrôî*s*tŏîh of K35. Possibly the latter word
might be read 3-trôî*s*tŏîh, 'the <span id="page_232">p. 232</span>
passing away of the three *nights*,' referring to the Av. phrase
thrity*a*u khshapô thrao*s*ta, 'on the passing away of the third night,'
in Hn. II, 18; the three nights are those immediately after death, while
the soul is supposed to remain hovering about the body, thinking over
its sins, and dreading the approaching judgment of the angel Rashnu; but
previous renunciation of sin would relieve it from much of this dread.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[232:1](sbe18085.htm#fr_865.md) That is, one not
born in shame, but a legitimate child. M14 has shîr, 'milk,' substituted
for sharm, 'shame.'

<span id="fn_863"></span>[232:2](sbe18085.htm#fr_866.md) M14 has 'woman of
family with extending sins or bad disposition.'

<span id="fn_864"></span>[232:3](sbe18085.htm#fr_867.md) See Chap. LXV.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[232:4](sbe18085.htm#fr_868.md) See Chap. XLVIII,
25.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[232:5](sbe18085.htm#fr_869.md) Probably the Abân
Nyâyi*s*.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[232:6](sbe18085.htm#fr_870.md) Probably the
Âta*s* Nyâyi*s*.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[232:7](sbe18085.htm#fr_871.md) By assisting in
their support.
