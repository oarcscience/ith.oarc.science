### CHAPTER XXXIII.

1\. *As to* the thirty-second question and reply, that which you ask is
thus: In which direction and which land is hell, and how is it?

2\. The reply is this, that the place of a soul of the wicked, after the
dying off  <span id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_242.md) of the body, is in
three districts (vîmand): one of them is called *that* of the
ever-stationary <span id="fr_244"></span>[3](#fn_243.md) of the wicked, and
it is a

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

chaos (gûmê*z*akŏ), but the evil is abundantly and considerably more
than the good; and the place is terrible, dark, stinking, and grievous
*with* evil. 3. And one is that which is called the worst existence, and
it is there the first tormentors (vîkhrunîgânŏ) and demons have *their*
abode; it is full of evil and punishment, and there is no comfort and
pleasure whatever. 4. And one is called Drû*g*âskân <span
id="fr_245"></span>[1](#fn_244.md), and is at the bottom of the gloomy
existence, where the head (kamârâkŏ) of the demons rushes; there is the
populous abode of all darkness and all evil.

5\. These three places, collectively, are called hell, *which* is
northerly, descending, and underneath this earth, even unto the utmost
declivity of the sky; and its gate is in the earth, a place of the
northern quarter, and is called the Arezûr ridge <span
id="fr_246"></span>[2](#fn_245.md), a mountain which, among its fellow
mountains of the name of Arezûr <span id="fr_247"></span>[3](#fn_246.md)
that are amid the rugged (kôfîk) mountains, is said in revelation <span
id="fr_248"></span>[4](#fn_247.md) *to have* a great fame with the demons,
and the rushing together and assembly of the demons in the world are on
the summit of that mountain, *or* as it is called 'the head of Arezûr.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_242"></span>[74:2](sbe18040.htm#fr_243.md) Literally 'dying
down.'

<span id="fn_243"></span>[74:3](sbe18040.htm#fr_244.md) Assuming that
ham-hastakân, 'co-existences, associates,' is meant for hamîstakân (see
the hamîstânîkŏ of Chap. XX, 3). From this it would appear that the
place of the Hamîstakân, intermediate between heaven and hell, was
itself supposed by the author to be divided into two widely separated
regions, one for the slightly righteous (see Chap. XXIV, 6), and one for
the slightly wicked, as here described. No such separation is mentioned
in AV. and Mkh., and the passage is omitted in M14.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[75:1](sbe18040.htm#fr_245.md) The Av.
dru*g*askanãm of Vend. XIX. 139, which is translated 'the slothful ones
of the Dru*g*' by Darmesteter, 'the servants of the Dru*g*' by Harlez,
and 'wizards' in Haug's Essays, p. 336. Drû*g*âskân is said to be a son
of the evil spirit in Bd. XXXI, 6.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[75:2](sbe18040.htm#fr_246.md) See Bd. XII, 8.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[75:3](sbe18040.htm#fr_247.md) Bd. XII, I6
mentions another Arezûr 'in the direction of Arûm.'

<span id="fn_247"></span>[75:4](sbe18040.htm#fr_248.md) Vend. XIX, 142
(trans. D.) says 'they run away casting the evil eye, the wicked,
evil-doing Daêvas: "Let us gather together at the head of Arezûra!"'
