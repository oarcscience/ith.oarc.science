### CHAPTER XV.

1\. The fourteenth question is that which you ask thus: Is the
eradication of life the gnawing of dogs and birds upon the corpse? And
does the sin of those who suppose *it* <span
id="fr_96"></span>[3](#fn_95) a sin proceed from *that* origin, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that the decrease of sin and increase of good
works, owing to good thoughts, good words, *and* good deeds, arise
really from the effort and disquietude which come on by means of the
religion the soul practises, *and* through the strength in effort,
steadfastness of religion, and

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

protection of soul *which* the faithful possess. 3. That evil which
*occurs* when doing good works, which is the one (hand,) when doing
iniquity, and when one strives *it* is the one when he does not strive,
the one when content and the one when not content, and after *it is*
undesired, and no cause of good works is with it, it occurs just as
undesired, for the sake of favour and reward, is the certain eradication
of life. 4. It happens once only (aêtûm) unto the righteous and the
wicked, every one *who* may have received the reward--that reward is
living until the time of passing *away*--but the gnawing of dogs and
birds does not happen unto every one and every body. 5. It is necessary
*for those* to act very differently <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_96)
whose understanding of good works is owing to proper heed of dead
matter; and, on account of the rapid change (var*d*î-hastanŏ) of that
pollution, and a desire of atonement for sin, they should carry the body
of *one* passed *away* out to a mountain-spur (kôf vakhsh), *or* a place
of *that* description, enjoining unanimously that the dogs and birds may
gnaw it, owing to the position of the appointed place <span
id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_97). 6. Therefore, as owing to that fear <span
id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_98), the commands of religion, and progressive

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

desire *it* is accepted strenuously for the wicked himself, his own
recompense is therein, and it happens to him in that way for the removal
(narafsi*s*nŏ) of sin *and* for the gratification of *his* soul.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_93"></span>[34:1](sbe18022.htm#fr_94) The three days and
nights of final punishment, after the resurrection and before the final
purification in melted metal (see Bd. XXX, 13, 16, 20), which is
mentioned again in § 8.

<span id="fn_94"></span>[34:2](sbe18022.htm#fr_95) This does not refer
to the final punishment of §§ 6 and 8, but to the previous three nights'
tribulation just after death, and to the fate of the soul before the
resurrection (see Chaps. XXIV, XXV).

<span id="fn_95"></span>[34:3](sbe18023.htm#fr_96) The exposure of the
dead, apparently; but the construction of this question and its relation
to the reply are by no means clear at first sight. From §§ 2, 5, 6 we
have to infer that the exposure is a meritorious action rather than a
sin; and from §§ 3, 4 we have to gather that as loss of life occurs to
every one, and exposure of the corpse only to some, the former cannot be
caused by the latter.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[35:1](sbe18023.htm#fr_97) Differently from
others.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[35:2](sbe18023.htm#fr_98) The dead must be
deposited upon some dry and barren spot, remote from habitations and
water, and, if possible, upon the summit of a hill (see Chap. XVII, 17,
and Vend. VI, 93). From the mention of dogs gnawing the corpse it would
appear that the depositories for the dead were less enclosed when this
work was written than they are at present; and in ancient times both
enclosed and unenclosed depositories seem to have been used (see Vend.
VI, 92-106). For a description of the present form of such depositories
see Sls. II, 6, note.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[35:3](sbe18023.htm#fr_99) Fear of pollution
from the dead.
