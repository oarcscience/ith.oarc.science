<p>1. The seventh question is that you ask thus: When a man is passing <I>away</I>, <I>and</I> after the occurrence of his passing <I>away</I>, how does the good work</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A></p>  
<p>then go to him <I>and</I> assist him, which any others may do for him who has gone out from the world, on the third night in the dawn&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>at</I> which he goes out to the balance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>? <I>And is its</I> greatness such as though it be done by his own hand, or otherwise?'</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this:--When any others do a good work for him who <I>has</I> passed away, after the passing away, and if he who <I>has</I> passed away did not order that good work in <I>his</I> lifetime; and did not bequeath it, nor <I>was its</I> originator, and it was not even his by design (d&acirc;<I>d</I>&#335;), then it does not go and does not reach him out at the balance. 3. Even at the time for being proceeded with, when that good work does not assist it is not appropriated, for that which is appropriated as the design of some one is appropriated by acceptance from some one; when it is not his by design it is then not accepted as his.</p>  
<p>4.. If he who <I>has</I> passed <I>away</I> did not order that good work, and did not even bequeath <I>it</I>, but was consenting to it by design, that which shall be done in <I>his</I> life<I>time</I> then reaches out in the three <I>nights</I> (sat&ucirc;&icirc;h) for the aggrandizement of his position; <I>but</I> that which shall be done after <I>his</I> passing <I>away</I> is not in the account of the three <I>nights</I> and the balance, but reaches out, at the time the good work is proceeded with, for the enjoyment of the soul.</p>  
<p>5. And if he who <I>has</I> passed <I>away</I> ordered that</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>good work in his own life<I>time</I>, or bequeathed it, or was the originator and cause of the soul's employment, although it is proceeded with after <I>his</I> passing away, it then reaches out to him for the happiness of his soul, since the origin of the thanksgiving (sip&acirc;s)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the orderer and ownership of the good work are certain.</p>  
<p>6. Any good work whatever which is proceeded with is clearly a like good work as regards those who account for <I>it as</I> with him who is the doer <I>of it</I>; also in the account of his soul the good work is as much with him who did <I>it</I>, but the soul of him by whom the good work is done by his own hand, is handsomer and stronger than of him by whom it is ordered. 7. And its similitude is such as when a man's handsome and seemly suit of clothes is his own, and he wears <I>it</I> on <I>his</I> body <I>and</I> is handsomer, more splendid, and more seemly <I>than</I> another man <I>who</I> wears a suit of clothes, <I>in</I> like manner, <I>which</I> is his own by theft.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_76"></A><A HREF="sbe18016.htm#fr_77">27:1</A> The soul of a dead person is supposed to hover about the corpse for three nights, and not to depart for the other world till the dawn after the third night; that is, at dawn of the fourth day, including the day of death (see Chap. XX, 2, 3, Sls. XVII, 2-6).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_77"></A><A HREF="sbe18016.htm#fr_78">27:2</A> Where the soul's good works are balanced against its sins, to determine its fate till the resurrection.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_78"></A><A HREF="sbe18016.htm#fr_79">28:1</A> The good works mentioned in this chapter would chiefly consist of prayers and ceremonies for which priests have to be remunerated, and gifts to holy men and the poor; such actions as are most highly appreciated by priests.</P>
