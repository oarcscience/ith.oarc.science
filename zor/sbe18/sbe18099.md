### CHAPTER XCII.

1\. *As to* the ninety-first question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: Of waters and rivers, and whatever water is good, is
Arekdvisûr <span id="fr_994"></span>[2](#fn_991) the greatest (mas.md), or
*some* other water or good river; and, again, where is the place of
Arekdvisûr?

2\. The reply is this, that *it is* the water of Arekdvisûr; and *what
has* gushed from Arekdvisûr is as large a mass as all the water in the
world <span id="fr_995"></span>[3](#fn_992.md) except the Arvand <span
id="fr_996"></span>[4](#fn_993.md); within the wide-formed ocean <span
id="fr_997"></span>[5](#fn_994.md) *it* is dominant over the thousand
cascades (pashan) *and* thousand lakes <span
id="fr_998"></span>[6](#fn_995.md) of the waters, and its place is most
*renowned* throughout the spheres. 3. There flows the water of
Arekdvisûr in a forest, the source of all seeds, whereby the species
*which* plants possess are assimilated (aê*d*ûnagî*d*ŏ) by it, *and*
healing existences of all kinds are mingled *with it* from medicinal
plants. 4. The abundant power of the

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

coming of healing to the purifying water is like the nature of the
existences which it acquires, *and* then the nature which it thus
acquires for its own the water draws up by the power which is drawing
water to itself.

5\. The water of Arekdvisûr is on Albûr*z* <span
id="fr_999"></span>[1](#fn_996.md), and flows even to the summit of the
star station during the coming of the healing of purification, even unto
Hûkhîr the lofty <span id="fr_1000"></span>[2](#fn_997.md), all-gorgeous
*and* brilliant; thence *its* flowing is effected <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[3](#fn_998.md) into the lake of a summit to Albûr*z*,
Mount [Aûshin*d*ûm](errata.htm#1.md) <span
id="fr_1002"></span>[4](#fn_999.md), which is in the middle of the
wide-formed ocean. 6. And from that flowing of waters that destined
river, the utter destruction of every night, comes on in the light of a
dawn; by the sprinkling of spray (pash-pashanŏ) it extends through the
seven regions *of the earth*, and from it arise the growth of their
plants and the coming of the healing of purification; that which is
called a drop (srî*s*k) of the primeval creatures *being* a particle
(aham) of water of the bulk of a horse <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[5](#fn_1000.md).
