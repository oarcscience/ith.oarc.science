### CHAPTER LXXXV.

1\. *As to* the eighty-fourth question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: *As to* a gift for the ceremonial *which* they do not reduce,
and while they give *it* in excess, in what manner is then its great
advantage, *and* how *and* in how many modes is it possible to occur?

2\. The reply is this, that the advancement of the ceremonial of the
sacred beings is by so much as the gift is more fully given; and the
great advantage of the good work is more, and its reasons many,
therefrom. 3. The desire of this wealth, which *has* come for the sake
of the good work, is an experience

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

of the comfortable living of the angels, by whom the solemnizers are
aggrandized, and is proper apart from *its* great judiciousness; to
diminish *it* is improper.

4\. When the gift *for* the ceremonial is abundantly given, the
performers of the ceremonial, who, with much trouble annoying them,
*have* solemnized the Avesta *and* chanted the hymns (Gâthas), and
obtain the stipend of their solemnizing from the remuneration *of* the
solemnization, are living comfortably, thriving, and blessed. 5. And
also the undertakers of all the religious rites who, by means of the
hope of rightful religion, render *one* certain as to the way *to* the
distant awful place <span id="fr_929"></span>[1](#fn_926), and tempt the
longers for righteousness into the religion <span
id="fr_930"></span>[2](#fn_927), undertake all the religious rites *and*
ceremonial *of* the sacred beings for the sake of the stipend of proper
diligence.

6\. And reasoning thought is cognizant as regards the advantageousness
due to the undertakers and solemnizers of all the religious rites, and a
great stipend is more obtained and observed *for them* than for *any*
other profession. 7. The sons, too, of priests and disciples strive for
the words prayed <span id="fr_931"></span>[3](#fn_928), and are more
eager for their. prayers; and many, likewise, shall engage for all the
religious rites, and become more diffusive of the religion (dînô
bâli*s*nîktar); and, in like, manner, the proper, more attainable, *and*
more propitious path of the good for saving the soul becomes wider <span
id="fr_932"></span>[4](#fn_929).
