### CHAPTER XCIV.

1\. And <span id="fr_1018"></span>[3](#fn_1015.md) those of the primitive
faith, the ancients of those acquainted with the religion <span
id="fr_1019"></span>[4](#fn_1016.md), thus considered, *that* in the
*spirit of* life (ahvô) <span id="fr_1020"></span>[5](#fn_1017.md) there is

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

a thought and one appointed who <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1](#fn_1018.md)
holds the position (gâs), *and* there is a fiend who stops <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[2](#fn_1019.md) the way; and in the thought there is a
word appointed which holds the position, *and* there is a fiend who
stops the way <span id="fr_1023"></span>[3](#fn_1020.md). 2. In the *spirit
of* life <span id="fr_1024"></span>[4](#fn_1021.md) is a thought *and*
Spenda*r*ma*d* <span id="fr_1025"></span>[5](#fn_1022.md) ('bountiful
devotion') holds the position, *and* the fiend Tarômat <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[6](#fn_1023) ('scornful thought'.md) stops the way; in
the thought is a word *and* Ar*d* <span
id="fr_1027"></span>[7](#fn_1024) ('the righteous'.md) holds the position,
and Varenô <span id="fr_1028"></span>[8](#fn_1025) ('lust'.md) stops the
way; in the word is a deed *and* Dînô <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[9](#fn_1026) ('religion'.md), the good, holds the
position, and self-conceit

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
(khû*d*-dôshagîh)stops the way. 3. We men of all descriptions <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[1](#fn_1027.md) have to become very <span
id="fr_1031"></span>[2](#fn_1028.md) cautious that, while we do not desist
from that way <span id="fr_1032"></span>[3](#fn_1029.md), we do not go on
to the way of the demons *and* fiends <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[4](#fn_1030.md). 4. For the struggling of men <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[5](#fn_1031.md) is *in* these three <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[6](#fn_1032.md) ways and paths; *and* whoever is saved
in these three <span id="fr_1036"></span>[6](#fn_1032.md) ways and paths is
saved from every place, and whoever is misled there comes into the hands
of the demons *and* fiends <span id="fr_1037"></span>[7](#fn_1033.md), and
is thenceforth not master (*s*alîtâ) of himself, except when he shall do
that which the fiends order him <span id="fr_1038"></span>[8](#fn_1034.md).

5\. And this, too, *was* thus considered by them, that that nature only
is good when it <span id="fr_1039"></span>[9](#fn_1035.md) shall not do
unto another whatever is not good for its own self <span
id="fr_1040"></span>[10](#fn_1036.md); and that wisdom only is good when it
thoroughly <span id="fr_1041"></span>[11](#fn_1037.md) understands *how* to
utilize the advantage <span id="fr_1042"></span>[12](#fn_1038.md) of that
happiness which has occurred, *and* shall <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[13](#fn_1039.md) not suffer vexation *on account of*
harm which has not occurred; and that intellect only is good which

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

understands that it does not understand that which it does not
understand.

6\. And this, too, *was* thus considered by them, that *one* is to
become <span id="fr_1044"></span>[1](#fn_1040.md) a friend of every one,
and this is thy nature <span id="fr_1045"></span>[2](#fn_1041.md); also,
bring them on into <span id="fr_1046"></span>[3](#fn_1042.md) goodness,
and, this is thy wisdom; also, consider them as thine own, and this is
thy religion;, also, through them it shall produce <span
id="fr_1047"></span>[4](#fn_1043.md) happiness, and this is thy soul <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[5](#fn_1044.md).

7\. And this, too, *was* thus considered by them, that, when <span
id="fr_1049"></span>[6](#fn_1045.md) *one* shall do even that which he
knows to be sin <span id="fr_1050"></span>[7](#fn_1046.md), that is
disobedience; *and* disobedience is the nature of the adversary; when
*one* shall not do even that which he knows to be a good work, that is
cupidity (varenôîkîh), *and* cupidity is the wisdom of the
adversary <span id="fr_1051"></span>[8](#fn_1047.md); *and* when *one*
shall do <span id="fr_1052"></span>[9](#fn_1048.md) even that which he does
not know *to be* a good work or a sin, until it comes fully to <span
id="fr_1053"></span>[10](#fn_1049.md) *his* knowledge,

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

that is self-conceit, and self-conceit is the religion of the
adversary <span id="fr_1054"></span>[1](#fn_1050.md).

8\. And this, too, *was* thus considered by them, that Aharman <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[2](#fn_1051.md) would do everything for the injury of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *but* when it is done by him <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[3](#fn_1052.md) *it* is then an injury of him himself,
*and* an advantage of Aûha*r*ma*zd*; and Aûha*r*ma*zd* would do
everything for his own advantage, *and* when it is done by him *it* is
then, indeed <span id="fr_1057"></span>[4](#fn_1053.md), an advantage of
him himself, *but* an injury of Aharman <span
id="fr_1058"></span>[5](#fn_1054.md).

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

9\. And this, too, *was* thus considered by them, that a person of
whatever description is to be kept <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[1](#fn_1055.md) in remembrance of the affairs of the
spirit at every period and time, and *of* the happiness of heaven *and*
misery of hell at that period when comfort, happiness, and pleasure have
come to him.

10\. And this, too, *was* thus considered by them <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[2](#fn_1056.md), that happiness, indeed, would be
there, in the heaven of light <span id="fr_1061"></span>[3](#fn_1057.md),
when even here *it* is so happy, though, owing to many *things* <span
id="fr_1062"></span>[4](#fn_1058.md), Aharman--with whom the happiness
there is not connected--is even here so happy at the time when distress,
vexation, *and* misery have come hereto; *and* this, too, *was* thus
considered, that evils, indeed, would be there, in hell, when here is
such misery, though even here much *of* the earthly happiness *of*
Aûha*r*ma*zd*--

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

with whom the misery there is not connected--is here so evil.

11\. And this, too, *was* thus considered by them, that that person is
the more fortunate <span id="fr_1063"></span>[1](#fn_1059.md), in whom the
soundness of body, happiness, and energy (râyînisnŏ) <span
id="fr_1064"></span>[2](#fn_1060.md); *who* has done those things *about*
which the last wish of him who departs from the world is then thus: 'I
*will* strive to do more;' *and who* shall have exercised much complete
abstinence from those things *about* which his last wish, when he
departs from the world, is then such as 'I *will* strive to do less, and
it would have occurred more comfortably for my soul <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[3](#fn_1061.md).'

12\. Do you good people of those of the good religion of these countries
of Irân keep in use the laws appointed *by* those of the primitive faith
who *were* high-priests, so that your bodies *may* become more renowned,
*and your* souls more perfect, in the radiant supreme heaven which <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[4](#fn_1062.md) is the seat of Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the
archangels, *of* the angels *and* all the guardian spirits of the
righteous. 13. So these are so many answers of the questions provided,
and are given explanatorily from the exposition of the religion *and*
the statements of the high-priests *of* 

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

those of the primitive faith, and *are* the nature of the teachings
*that* Mânû*sk*îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[1](#fn_1063), pontiff (ra*d*ŏ.md) of Pârs and
Kirmân <span id="fr_1068"></span>[2](#fn_1064.md), and director
(farmâ*d*âr) <span id="fr_1069"></span>[3](#fn_1065.md) of the profession
of priests, ordered to write.

14\. Steadfast in the propitiation and praise of the creator
Aûha*r*ma*zd* is the righteousness of obtainments of prayers, perfect is
Zaratû*s*t, *and* one *only* is the way <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[4](#fn_1066.md) which righteousness obtains, the
others are no ways; homage to the exalted pontiff *sent* from the
creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the heavenly, most righteous Zaratû*s*t the
Spîtamân.

15\. Completed in peace and pleasure, joy *and* delight;. happy for him
who reads, *and* happier for him who keeps *it* in use and shall take
his duty therefrom <span id="fr_1071"></span>[5](#fn_1067.md), if they
exist unto time eternal.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1015"></span>[269:3](sbe18101.htm#fr_1018.md) The first eleven
sections of this chapter are quoted from the beginning of the sixth book
of the Dînka*rd*, which commences as follows:--'The propitiation of the
creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* is even in the benedictions of the religion of
Ma*zd*a-worship; this, too, was the settled decision of those of the
primitive faith. The sixth *book* is on a compendium (vasang) which
*was* prepared by those of the primitive faith to maintain about the
sayings of the religion of Ma*zd*a-worship;' and then proceeds as in our
text, with the variations and additional matter mentioned in the
foot-notes. It is hardly probable that these quotations were intended as
a conclusion to any reply, the beginning of which may be lost, as they
refer to a variety of subjects; but they may have been selected by the
author as authoritative opinions sufficiently comprehensive for his
general peroration. At any rate they show that the Dînka*rd* must have
been in existence in its present form before the Dâ*d*istân-î Dînîk was
written. All the MSS. have this peroration written continuously with the
preceding chapter, without stop or break of any kind to indicate a
change of subject.

<span id="fn_1016"></span>[269:4](sbe18101.htm#fr_1019.md) Dk. has 'the
ancients of the wise.'

<span id="fn_1017"></span>[269:5](sbe18101.htm#fr_1020.md) Dk. adds 'of
men.'

<span id="fn_1018"></span>[270:1](sbe18101.htm#fr_1021.md) Dk. has 'which
is appointed and,' &c.

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[270:2](sbe18101.htm#fr_1022.md) Literally
'holds.'

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[270:3](sbe18101.htm#fr_1023.md) It is evident
from the context that something is omitted here, and Dk. supplies the
following:--'and in the word there is a deed *for* the appointed
position, *and* there is a fiend who stops the way. And in the *spirit
of* life is a heart (vâlôm) *and* Vohûman ("good thought") holds the
position, and Akômanô ("evil thought") stops the way; and in the heart
is a will *and* Srôsh ("attention") holds the position, and Aeshm
("wrath") stops the way.' It seems probable that the author did not mean
to quote the latter sentence of this passage.

<span id="fn_1021"></span>[270:4](sbe18101.htm#fr_1024.md) Dk. has 'and in
the will.'

<span id="fn_1022"></span>[270:5](sbe18101.htm#fr_1025.md) The female
archangel, who is a personification of Av. spe*n*ta ârmaiti, and has
special charge of the earth and virtuous women (see Bd. I, 26, Sls. XV,
20-24).

<span id="fn_1023"></span>[270:6](sbe18101.htm#fr_1026.md) Here written
Tarôkmatŏ (Av. tarômaiti); he is the arch-demon of disobedience, also
called Nâûnghas (see Bd. XXVIII, 14, XXX, 29).

<span id="fn_1024"></span>[270:7](sbe18101.htm#fr_1027.md) Av. areta, a
title of the female angel Arshi*s*ang or Ashi*s*ang (Av. ashi*s*
vanguhi, 'good rectitude'), whose name is given to the 25th day of the
Parsi month (see Bd. XXII, 4, XXVII, 24, Sls. XXII, 25, XXIII, 4).

<span id="fn_1025"></span>[270:8](sbe18101.htm#fr_1028.md) Av. varena,
'desire,' personified as a demon (see Bd. XXVIII, 25).

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[270:9](sbe18101.htm#fr_1029.md) Av. daêna
personified as an angel whose name is given to the tenth month and 24th
day of the month of the Parsi year, and is also coupled with the names
of other angels to form appellations <span id="page_271">p. 271</span>
for the 8th, 15th, and 23rd days (see Bd. XXV, 3, r 1, 20, Sls. XXII, 8,
15, 23, 24, XXIII, 4). Dk. omits the epithet 'good.'

<span id="fn_1027"></span>[271:1](sbe18101.htm#fr_1030.md) Dk. omits the
words 'of all descriptions;' it also places § 3 after § 4.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[271:2](sbe18101.htm#fr_1031.md) Dk. omits
'very.'

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[271:3](sbe18101.htm#fr_1032.md) Dk. has 'from
the way of the angels.'

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[271:4](sbe18101.htm#fr_1033.md) Dk. has 'go
after the fiends.'

<span id="fn_1031"></span>[271:5](sbe18101.htm#fr_1034.md) Dk. has 'and the
struggling of the fiend with men,' and places this section after § 2.

<span id="fn_1032"></span>[271:6](sbe18101.htm#fr_1036.md) Dk. has 'such'
instead of 'three' in both places.

<span id="fn_1033"></span>[271:7](sbe18101.htm#fr_1037.md) Dk. has 'comes
then to the hands of the fiends.'

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[271:8](sbe18101.htm#fr_1038.md) Dk. then
proceeds with § 3, 'and we men have to become cautious,' &c.

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[271:9](sbe18101.htm#fr_1039.md) Dk. has 'which,'
instead of 'when it,' both here and in the next clause.

<span id="fn_1036"></span>[271:10](sbe18101.htm#fr_1040.md) Dk. has 'for
itself.'

<span id="fn_1037"></span>[271:11](sbe18101.htm#fr_1041.md) Dk. omits
'thoroughly.'

<span id="fn_1038"></span>[271:12](sbe18101.htm#fr_1042.md) Literally 'to
eat the fruit'

<span id="fn_1039"></span>[271:13](sbe18101.htm#fr_1043.md) Dk. has 'does.'

<span id="fn_1040"></span>[272:1](sbe18101.htm#fr_1044.md) Dk. has 'it is
the becoming.'

<span id="fn_1041"></span>[272:2](sbe18101.htm#fr_1045.md) Dk. has
'wisdom.'

<span id="fn_1042"></span>[272:3](sbe18101.htm#fr_1046.md) Or 'through.'
Dk. omits this clause, substituting 'and this, too, *was* thus
considered by them.'

<span id="fn_1043"></span>[272:4](sbe18101.htm#fr_1047.md) Dk. has 'do thou
produce.'

<span id="fn_1044"></span>[272:5](sbe18101.htm#fr_1048.md) Dk. continues as
follows:--'And this, too, *was* thus considered by them, that nature is
that which deceives no one, wisdom is that which does not deceive
itself, and religion is that which is whatever knows where *one* should
perform good works.'

<span id="fn_1045"></span>[272:6](sbe18101.htm#fr_1049.md) Reading amat,
instead of mûn, 'which,' in all three clauses (see Chap. LXII, 4 n); Dk.
omits the word altogether.

<span id="fn_1046"></span>[272:7](sbe18101.htm#fr_1050.md) Dk. has 'shall
not do even that which he knows to be a good work,' as in the second
clause which it omits.

<span id="fn_1047"></span>[272:8](sbe18101.htm#fr_1051.md) This clause is
omitted by M14, J, BK, and the oldest MS. of Dk.; later MSS. of Dk. give
it as follows: 'should they do even that they know to be a sin, that is
lustful (varenôîk), and lustful is the wisdom of the adversary.'

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[272:9](sbe18101.htm#fr_1052.md) Dk. has 'does.'

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[272:10](sbe18101.htm#fr_1053.md) Dk. has 'before
it comes unto.'

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[273:1](sbe18101.htm#fr_1054.md) In Dk. the
following is here inserted:--'And this, too, *was* thus considered by
them, that in *one's* nature there is no wisdom, *but* in wisdom *there*
is nature, and in religion are both wisdom *and* nature. It is known
*how* to manage the affairs of the spirit by the nature, they are
preserved by wisdom, and the soul is preserved by a union of both. And
this, too, *was* thus considered by them, that shame is that which
should not allow *one* to commit sin, and disgrace is that it would not
allow to cause. And this, too, *was* thus considered by them, that the
essential thing of the primitive faith is freedom from sin. And this,
too, *was* thus considered by them, that *one* becomes diligent about
that *with* which *he* is conversant. And this, too, *was* thus
considered by them, that the good thoughts that are in the records of
the religion of every kind *one should* always put fully into practice,
so far as he understands *them*. And this, too, *was* thus considered by
them, that Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the lord, produced these creatures through
*his* nature, maintains *them* through wisdom, and forces them back to
himself through religion.'

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[273:2](sbe18101.htm#fr_1055.md) The evil spirit
(see Chaps. II, 11, XIX, 1).

<span id="fn_1052"></span>[273:3](sbe18101.htm#fr_1056.md) Or 'when he has
done it,' which would be expressed by the same words.

<span id="fn_1053"></span>[273:4](sbe18101.htm#fr_1057.md) Dk. omits
'indeed.'

<span id="fn_1054"></span>[273:5](sbe18101.htm#fr_1058.md) In Dk. the
following is here inserted:--'And this, too, *was* thus considered by
them, that people are to keep an eye most diligently on the world *for*
these three things: that which is realisable *by* a sinner through sin,
a follower made famous, *and* to beg the recompense of good works from
the spirits: and keeping their eye on the world is said *to be* this,
that *it is he* who observes himself, so that *a part* of whatever he
really desires he should always perform. And this, too, *was* thus
considered by them, that three <span id="page_273">p. 273</span> things
which are very difficult to do are even such as these: one is not to
render the sinfulness famous by the sin; one is not to exalt the
opinions of the fiend, and the various sovereignties of the evil *one*,
for the sake of wealth; and one is to beg the recompense of good works
from the spirits, *and* not from the world.'

<span id="fn_1055"></span>[274:1](sbe18101.htm#fr_1059.md) Dk. has merely
'keeps.'

<span id="fn_1056"></span>[274:2](sbe18101.htm#fr_1060.md) Dk. has 'this,
too, is to be considered,' as a continuation of the preceding section.

<span id="fn_1057"></span>[274:3](sbe18101.htm#fr_1061.md) Dk. omits 'of
light.'

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[274:4](sbe18101.htm#fr_1062.md) The oldest MS.
of Dk. has 'though *some* of the much happiness of Aûha*r*ma*zd*,' &c.,
as in the latter part of the section, omitting the passage referring to
Aharman and hell; later MSS., however, insert a modified version of the
omitted passage, and read as follows: 'When even here *it* is so happy
at the period when it should be distressing *and* the mischievous
vexation of much pain has come; this, too, is to be considered, that
misery, indeed, is the calamity (âfatŏ) there in hell, when even here
*it* is so, though *some* of the much happiness of Aûha*r*ma*zd*,' &c..
as before. This interpolation in Dk. is evidently modern (as the word
âfatŏ is Arabic and not Pahlavi), and was probably composed by a copyist
in India who was acquainted with the text of Dk.

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[275:1](sbe18101.htm#fr_1063.md) Dk. has 'that a
person is most fortunate in that.'

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[275:2](sbe18101.htm#fr_1064.md) M14 and J have
'are the appearance of health of body and pleasure;' Dk. has 'is the
appearance of perfection.'

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[275:3](sbe18101.htm#fr_1065.md) Dk. concludes as
follows: '*who has* done those things which are done, *about* which *on
his* last day--when the things of the world depart--his wish is then
thus, that 'more endeavour should be made by me;' *and has exercised*
much abstinence from those things *about* which his last day's wish is
this, that the endeavour made should not be made.' The quotations from
Dk. end at this point.

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[275:4](sbe18101.htm#fr_1066.md) Reading mûn, as
in M14 and J, instead of amat, 'when,' (see Chap. LXII, 4 n.)

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[276:1](sbe18101.htm#fr_1067.md) See [p.
3](sbe18009.htm#page_3.md), note 2.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[276:2](sbe18101.htm#fr_1068.md) The two southern
provinces of Persia, bordering on the Persian Gulf.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[276:3](sbe18101.htm#fr_1069.md) This title seems
to be always spelt in Pahlavi with â in the middle syllable, so that the
form framaDHâr in Nŏldeke's Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit
der Sasaniden, p. 9, must be looked upon as an Arabic corruption, and
the idea that it means 'a preceder or one who has precedence' can hardly
be maintained. It probably stands for farmâî*d*âr, 'a director or
commander,' not in a military sense. It occurs also in Bd. XXXIII, 2,
where the title 'a great farmâ*d*âr' is evidently equivalent to 'prime
