<p>It has been already stated (see pp, xiii, xiv) that Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam, a younger brother of M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har, after having been at Sarakhs, in the extreme north-east of Khur&acirc;s&acirc;n, where he seems to have associated with the heretical Tughazghuz, was appointed high-priest of S&icirc;rk&acirc;n, south or south-west of Kirm&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Shortly after his arrival there he issued a decree, regarding the ceremonies of purification and other matters, which was so unpalatable to the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers of that place that they wrote an epistle to M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har, complaining of the conduct of his brother (Ep. I, i, 2, ii, 1).</p>  
<p>In reply to this complaint, which was sent by a special courier (Ep. I, i, 2), and after going to Sh&icirc;r&acirc;<I>z</I> and holding a general assembly of the priests and elders (Ep. II, i, ii), M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har wrote his first epistle, completed on the 15th March 881 (Ep. I, xi, 12), in which he condemned the practices decreed by Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam, to whom he sent a confidential agent, named Ya<I>z</I><I>d</I>&acirc;n-p&acirc;nak (Ep. I, xi, i, 2, 6, 10, II, vii, 2), with a copy of this epistle and a further one to himself, which has not been preserved, for the purpose of inducing his brother to withdraw his decree and conform to the usual customs.</p>  
<p>It would appear that Ya<I>z</I><I>d</I>&acirc;n-p&acirc;nak was not very successful in his mission, as we find M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har writing a general epistle (Ep. III) to all the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers in Ir&acirc;n, in the following June or July (Ep. III, 21), denouncing as heretical the mode of purification decreed by Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam, and ordering an immediate return to former customs. At the same time (Ep. II, vii, 2, viii, 1) he wrote a second epistle (Ep. II) to his brother, as he had already</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxvi"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxvi</FONT></A></p>  
<p>promised in Ep. I, xi, 2, and, after referring to an epistle (now lost) which he had received from Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam in the previous November or December, he proceeded to enforce his views by a judicious intermingling of argument, entreaty, and threats. He also contemplated making preparations (Ep. I, xi, 4, II, vii, 3) for travelling himself to S&icirc;rk&acirc;n, notwithstanding his age (Ep. II, ix, 1), to arrange the matters in dispute upon a satisfactory basis. Whether he actually undertook this journey is unknown, but that his brother must have finally submitted to his authority appears from Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam retaining his position in the south, as has been already noticed (p. xiv).</p>  
<p>The matter in dispute between Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam and the orthodox Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers may seem a trivial one to people of other religions, but, inasmuch as the ceremonial uncleanness of a person insufficiently purified after contact with the dead would contaminate every one he associated with, the sufficiency of the mode of purification was quite as important to the community, both priests and laity, as avoidance of breach of caste-rules is to the Hind&ucirc;, or refraining from sacrifices to heathen gods was to the Jew, the early Christian, or the Muhammadan. And much more important than any disputes about sacraments, infallibility, apostolic succession, ritual, or observance of the Sabbath can possibly be to any modern Romanist or Protestant.</p>  
<p>In his mode of dealing with this matter M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har displays at once the moderation and tact of a statesman accustomed to responsibility, the learning and zeal of a well-informed priest, and the kindly affection of a brother. That he was not without rivals and enemies appears from his casual allusions to Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, the club-footed, and &Acirc;t&ucirc;r&#335;-p&acirc;d in Ep. II, i, 13, v, 14, ix, 11; but in all such allusions, as well as in his denunciation of heretical opinions, he refrains from coarse invective, and avoids the use of exaggerated language, such as too often disfigures and weakens the arguments in polemical discussions.</p>  
<p>Indirectly these epistles throw some light upon the condition of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers after more than two</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxvii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxvii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>centuries of ceaseless struggle with the ever-advancing flood of Muhammadanism which was destined to submerge them. Sh&icirc;r&acirc;<I>z</I>, S&icirc;rk&acirc;n, Kirm&acirc;n, R&acirc;&icirc;, and Sarakhs are still mentioned as head-quarters of the old faith; and we are told of assemblies at Sh&icirc;r&acirc;<I>z</I> and among the Tughazghuz, the former of which appears to have had the chief control of religious matters in P&acirc;rs, Kirm&acirc;n, and the south, acting as a council to the high-priest of P&acirc;rs and Kirm&acirc;n, who was recognised as the leader of the religion (Dd. XLV, 5). We also learn, from Ep. I, iii, I x, II, v, 14, that the leaders of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshippers, if not their high-priests, were still in the habit of maintaining troops and, from Ep. II, i, 9, that when a high-priest became very old his worldly duties were performed by four of the most learned priests, forming a committee, which had full authority to deliberate and act for him in all worldly matters. M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har even speaks of emigrating by sea to China, or by land to Asia Minor (Ep. II, viii, 5), in order to escape from the annoyances of his position.</p>  
<p>But the statements which are most important to the Pahlavi scholar, in these epistles, are the date attached to the third epistle, corresponding to A.D. 881, and the mention of N&icirc;shahp&ucirc;har in Ep. I, iv, 15, 17 as the supreme officiating priest and councillor of king Kh&ucirc;sr&ocirc; N&ocirc;shirv&acirc;n (A.D. 531-579), engaged apparently in writing commentaries on the Avesta. The date of these epistles not only limits that of the D&acirc;<I>d</I>ist&acirc;n-&icirc; D&icirc;n&icirc;k to the latter half of the ninth century, but also fixes those of the larger recension of the Bundahi<I>s</I> and of the latest revision of the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I> within the same period, because it is stated in Bd. XXXIII, 10, 11 that the writer of that chapter was a contemporary of Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam, son of Y&ucirc;d&acirc;n-Yim, and &Acirc;t&ucirc;<I>r</I>-p&acirc;<I>d</I>, son of H&ecirc;m&icirc;<I>d</I>, the former of whom was evidently the brother of M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har, and the latter is mentioned in D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I> III, ccccxiii as the latest editor of that work. The actual compiler of a great part of the D&icirc;nka<I>r</I><I>d</I> (especially of the fourth and fifth books) was, however, the somewhat earlier writer At&ucirc;<I>r</I>-fr&ocirc;bag, son of Farukh&ucirc;z&acirc;<I>d</I> (Dd. LXXXVIII, 8, Ep. I, iii, 9). The name of N&icirc;shahp&ucirc;har is also mentioned as that</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_xxviii"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. xxviii</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of a commentator in the Pahlavi Vendid&acirc;<I>d</I> and N&icirc;rangist&acirc;n, which works must, therefore, have been revised since the middle of the sixth century. And as we are informed in the book of Ar<I>d</I>&acirc;-V&icirc;r&acirc;f (I, 35) that 'there are <I>some</I> who call <I>him by</I> the name of Nikhshahp&ucirc;r,' we ought probably to refer that book to the same age. These epistles, therefore, enable us, for the first time, to fix the probable dates of the latest extensive revisions of six of the most important Pahlavi works that are still extant; and from the relationship of these to others we can readily arrive at safer conclusions, regarding the age of Pahlavi literature in general, than have been hitherto possible.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_8"></A><A HREF="sbe18004.htm#fr_8">xxv:1</A> The city of Kirm&acirc;n was itself called S&icirc;r<I>g</I>&acirc;n, or S&icirc;rg&acirc;n, in the middle ages, and is evidently mentioned by that name in Ouseley's Oriental Geography, pp. 139, 143, though the S&icirc;rg&acirc;n of pp. 138, 141 of the same work was clearly further south. Which of these two towns was the S&icirc;rk&acirc;n of these epistles, may therefore, be doubtful.</P>
