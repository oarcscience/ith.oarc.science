<p>1. This, too, this aged <I>one</I> (a&ucirc;zv&acirc;r<I>d</I>&#335;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1377"></A><A HREF="#fn_1372"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) orders, that, <I>as to</I> the polluted of the countries of Ir&acirc;n, when they do not obtain another washer, their way is then through thoroughly washing <I>themselves</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1378"></A><A HREF="#fn_1373"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 2. For you who are understanding the rite and capable of washing, <I>and</I> are the most forward and intelligent of the religious, so long as your previous washing is a way of no assistance, <I>there</I> is <I>this</I> tediously-worded epistle; moreover, all their sin you assign for your own affliction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1379"></A><A HREF="#fn_1374"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, whose after-course is thus for their Pa<I>n</I><I>k</I>adasa fifteen<I>fold</I>') washing', <I>at</I> the time they shall abandon, <I>as</I> distasteful, that sin which is a new development by way of Upasn&acirc;t<I>e</I>&ecirc; ('washing downwards')&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1380"></A><A HREF="#fn_1375"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; and the sinfulness is his who established that law for them.</p>  
<p>3. And yours are truly creatures of a fetid pool (gand-&acirc;<I>v</I>&#335;), who, as regards my motive, always speak about it just as they spoke thus to a priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1381"></A><A HREF="#fn_1376"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>: 'Why <I>has</I> the savoury meat-offering not become forgotten by thee, <I>while</I> the firewood and incense, because it is not possible to eat <I>them</I> up, are quite</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>

<p><A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A></p>  
<p>forgotten?' 4. Also, <I>as</I> a similitude of your affairs, they are saying that <I>it is</I> as though the stipend of guardianship <I>were</I> always to be demanded just <I>in accordance</I> with omissions <I>of duty</I> (a<I>v</I>&acirc;g m&acirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;h&acirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1382"></A><A HREF="#fn_1377"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 5. So that even while the trifle of trifles which exists as an interval from the title of leadership unto <I>that of</I> high-priestship--in which, except a title that is no joy of the strictly religious, there is nothing whatever--is, that way, to prepare a source of dispute as to the work which you do for the guardianship, it should, therefore, be a sufficiency (khv&acirc;r-b&acirc;r), where your own supreme work is purification itself; and to do either <I>what</I> is taught, or is advantageous, would be withdrawing from the country a demand which <I>has</I> caused disturbance (bal&ucirc;b&acirc;k&icirc;n&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;); to subdue <I>it</I> thou shouldst always so decide the daily allowances&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1383"></A><A HREF="#fn_1378"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>6. And, to-day, I <I>have</I>, on that account, written everything sternly, because that which another person arranges and speaks so opposed <I>to me</I> in evil appearance--which is little fit <I>to be</I> prepared--when I write seasonably, and with friendly and brotherly exaltation, you direct and persevere more expressly in preparing, so that portion upon portion is thus brought forth. 7. In good old age&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1384"></A><A HREF="#fn_1379"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the great law of after-restoration is a harsh remedy, and, on that</p>

<p>supposition, where <I>a rule</I> is shown to descend from their three teachings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1385"></A><A HREF="#fn_1380"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> is itself regarded as true, <I>and</I> the wisdom of the period <I>as</I> impotent (an&ocirc;z&ocirc;har&icirc;k&#335;), you yourself fully imagine (h&ucirc;-min&ecirc;<I>d</I>&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1386"></A><A HREF="#fn_1381"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> that <I>further restoration</I> is not an important&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1387"></A><A HREF="#fn_1382"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and foremost thing. 8. Those of different faiths of various kinds <I>have</I> many usages and perplexing kinds of doubt, even about the accomplishment <I>and</I> explanation of the statements of the high-priests&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1388"></A><A HREF="#fn_1383"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, for <I>on</I> this subject, about old age (g&ucirc;n&acirc;n&icirc;h), <I>and</I> even about sprinkling and about yourself accomplishing the religious <I>rites</I>, you are wisely <I>for</I> a preservation of the equally wise experience of the profession; <I>and as to</I> the heterodox, that writing which realised that even now memory is opposing you is itself evil-wishing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1389"></A><A HREF="#fn_1384"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, and you know <I>it</I> is your own arrangement.</p>  
<p>9. This, too, they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1390"></A><A HREF="#fn_1385"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> say that, if <I>it be</I> on that account that the purifiers shall not always so perform the purification by all three teachings, or every rite which is proper according to one teaching, it will be necessary <I>that</I> the purifiers shall abandon purification. 10. Then about old age, the performance of the ceremonial&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1391"></A><A HREF="#fn_1386"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> the many times of this which</p>

<p>are mentioned as <I>though</I> this <I>were</I> proper, <I>it</I> is stated as regards how it is proper that, when on account of those of the good religion they always proceed just as is mentioned in the Zand teaching of the Avesta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1392"></A><A HREF="#fn_1387"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, it will then be necessary <I>that</I> they shall abandon the religion. 11. And many other sayings of things like unto these are scattered about (zerkh&ucirc;n&icirc;-a&icirc;t&#335;), and are named near &Acirc;t&ucirc;<I>r</I>&#335;-p&acirc;<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1393"></A><A HREF="#fn_1388"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>as</I> hints from you; for this reason they are reckoned (khaprag-a&icirc;t&#335;) in the thoughts of men.</p>  
<p>12. And this much is written by me in distressing haste I consider <I>it</I> complete, and <I>may</I> peace and every happiness perpetually become hospitably attainable <I>and</I> accomplishable for you thereby, through the severe anguish <I>and</I> discomfort, <I>and</I> the eternal distress and despondency <I>of</I> the healer of affliction, M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har, son of Y&ucirc;d&acirc;n-Yim, director of the profession of priests of P&acirc;rs and Kirm&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1394"></A><A HREF="#fn_1389"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1372"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1377">354:1</A> From this it appears clearly that M&acirc;n&ucirc;<I>s</I><I>k</I>&icirc;har was an aged man when these epistles were written, though not too old to travel. The previous allusion to old age, however, in Chap. I, 9, may not have referred to himself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1373"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1378">354:2</A> As provided in Vend. VIII, 299 (see App. V).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1374"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1379">354:3</A> omits alag, 'affliction;' and in K35 it is doubtful whether it be struck out, or not.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1375"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1380">354:4</A> See Chap. III, 2 for both these terms.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1376"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1381">354:5</A> Implying that the laity were inclined to attribute his own strict enforcement of ceremonies, requiring the employment of the priest hoot, to interested motives.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1377"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1382">355:1</A> That is, the laity attributed his brother's laxity, on the other hand, to sheer neglect of duty, and had, therefore, begun to consider his supervision hardly worth paying for.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1378"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1383">355:2</A> Meaning that by adherence to long-established custom, as regards both priestly work and priestly allowances, the laity would be better satisfied and more easily managed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1379"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1384">355:3</A> Reading h&ucirc;-kah&ocirc;ban&icirc;h; J has merely kah&ocirc;ban&icirc;h, 'old age, antiquity.' He appears to be referring rather to the antiquity of the Avesta law, than to his own old age.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1380"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1385">356:1</A> See Chap. III, 1, Ep. I, v, 1, 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1381"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1386">356:2</A> J has khav&icirc;t&ucirc;n&ecirc;<I>d</I>, 'you know.' He deprecates all further investigation into the meaning of the scriptures, which had already been explained by three old commentators, as he doubted the religious wisdom of the age in which he lived.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1382"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1387">356:3</A> The continuation of the text in J ends at this point.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1383"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1388">356:4</A> The commentators.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1384"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1389">356:5</A> That is, the decree of Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam, though itself objectionable, was opposed to the heterodox who wished for further innovations.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1385"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1390">356:6</A> The heterodox.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1386"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1391">356:7</A> Referring perhaps to the performance of the Vendid&acirc;<I>d</I> service <A NAME="page_357"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 357</FONT></A>(which includes the Yasna ceremonial) as directed in Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, <i>b</i>, <i>o</i> (see App. IV).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1387"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1392">357:1</A> It is possible also to read 'in the teaching of the Avesta and Zand;' but this would ignore the fact that the 'teaching' is the Zand itself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1388"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1393">357:2</A> The same rival as is mentioned in Chap. V, 14.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1389"></A><A HREF="sbe18121.htm#fr_1394">357:3</A> According to Dd. XLV, g the farm&acirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r or 'director' of the profession of priests of P&acirc;rs was the p&ecirc;<I>s</I>&ucirc;p&acirc;&icirc; or 'leader' of the religion.</P>
