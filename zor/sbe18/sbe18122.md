# EPISTLE III.

#### TO ALL OF THE GOOD RELIGION IN IRAN.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*In* the name of the sacred beings.

A copy of the notification (vishâ*d*akŏ') of *his* priestly lordship
Mânû*sk*îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, regarding the grievous sinfulness of
*assuming* the propriety of washing for fifteen times.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*In* the name of the sacred beings.

1\. It *has* come unto the ears (va*s*ammûni*s*nŏ) of me, Mânû*sk*îhar,
son of Yûdân-Yim, pontiff (ra*d*) of Pârs *and* Kirmân <span
id="fr_1396"></span>[1](#fn_1391.md), that, in some quarters of the country
of Irân, they whose chance happens *to be* so much <span
id="fr_1397"></span>[2](#fn_1392.md) pollution, such as is decreed unto so
much washing of the customary *parts* (pî*s*akŏ), always wash
*themselves* fifteen times with bull's urine and once with water,
consider themselves as clean <span id="fr_1398"></span>[3](#fn_1393.md),
and go to water, fire, and *ceremonial* ablution, the ablution

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

of the sacred twigs. 2. Such--although <span
id="fr_1399"></span>[1](#fn_1394.md) they say that Zâ*d*-sparam <span
id="fr_1400"></span>[2](#fn_1395.md), son of Yûdân-Yim, *has* ordered,
*and* the high-priests *have* appointed, washing of this kind--*has*
appeared to my well-reflecting (hû-min) opinion, apprehension, and
appreciation very marvellous *and* grave, and *merely* a rumour. 3. And
*it* is needful for me to keep those of the good religion in *all*
quarters of the country of Irân informed concerning the placing reliance
upon their washing with the Bareshnûm *ceremony* <span
id="fr_1401"></span>[3](#fn_1396.md), *and* to make my own opinion clear
also as regards the writings collected.

4\. And, first of all, about the indispensability of the Bareshnûm
*ceremony* I write several such copies of a well-matured writing of
mine <span id="fr_1402"></span>[4](#fn_1397.md) as may even be new light to
the intelligent. 5. That my opinion of the information provided by
revelation, the decisions *of* high-priests, *and* the teachings *of*
those of the primitive faith is thus, that washing by the polluted with
water is pollution for the life and spiritual life (ahvô) <span
id="fr_1403"></span>[5](#fn_1398.md); they render the material *body* clean
thereby, *but* that which is known as the handiwork <span
id="fr_1404"></span>[6](#fn_1399.md) of the immortals, and is also
professionally called the Bareshnûm, when *there is* the protection of a
ritual of *various* kinds, shall make the body clean from endless
worldly attacks.

6\. It is in the nine ablution seats (magakŏ) <span
id="fr_1405"></span>[7](#fn_1400.md) and the furrow <span
id="fr_1406"></span>[8](#fn_1401.md), even with prayer, bull's urine,
water,

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

and other appliances, and the ritual which is such as is declared in the
teaching of revelation; and even now the purifiers, who are just as
written *about* below, keep *it* in use. 7. When there is a washing they
wash just as in the well-teaching statements which are known as *those*
of Mê*d*yôk-mâh, of Afarg, and of Sôshâns <span
id="fr_1407"></span>[1](#fn_1402.md), or *in* the statement of one of those
three teachings, or in the statement of one of the high-priests *by*
whom those three teachings are declared as propriety, or has come unto
me as the practice of those same three teachings *by* those of the
primitive faith.

8\. I deem *this* deliverance <span id="fr_1408"></span>[2](#fn_1403.md)
one wholly approvable, and the washer *in* a washing of that kind, with
the Bareshnûm *ceremony*--which is lawfully *of* that description--I
consider as a purifier who is approvable. 9. And the polluted of every
description, as *above* written, who *have* obtained, for any
indispensable reason whatever, a purifier, as *above* written, whom even
now various districts *and* various places have appointed *and*
approved, are able to wash with the Bareshnûm ceremony as *above*
written. 10. Then their washing fifteen times is no deliverance in any
way, and to wash them quickly with the Bareshnûm *ceremony* as *above*
written is indispensable.

11\. Owing to a washing of the same kind through the Bareshnûm
*ceremony*, as is intended, water, fire, and other *things*, not to
provide care for which is un <span id="fr_1409"></span>[3](#fn_1404.md) . .
. . . . . . . . authorisedly is grievously sinful.

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 12. When, on
account of a cleansing through another washing, distinct from the
Bareshnûm ceremony,

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

they consider themselves as clean *it* is more grievously sinful; just
as when they do not wash with the Bareshnûm, as *above* written, *but*
consider themselves as clean through *washing* fifteen times, as *above*
written, or on account of any washing whatever distinct from the
Bareshnûm, *it* is more grievously sinful; because, when they do not
wash with a Bareshnûm, as *above* written, *but* wash for fifteen times,
as *above* written, or any washing whatever distinct from the Bareshnûm,
as *above* written, they do not become clean, through the professional
washing which is decreed, from that pollution which remains <span
id="fr_1410"></span>[1](#fn_1405.md).

13\. When without similar trouble *and* great judiciousness they go unto
water *and* fire, the sin is grievous; and when they go to the bowl
(pa*d*mânŏ) for ablution of the sacred twigs <span
id="fr_1411"></span>[2](#fn_1406.md) *it* is non-ablution advisedly, *and*
to perform the ceremonial therewith would not be authorised. 14. And,
*in* like manner, the washing of polluted Hôm *twigs* <span
id="fr_1412"></span>[3](#fn_1407.md), for any indispensable purpose, with
the Bareshnûm *ceremony*, as *above* written, is not possible.

15\. Therefore, so that we *may* obtain as *it were* a remedy for it, I
wash with the Bareshnûm *ceremony*, as *above* written; to keep the mind
steadfast *and* to attain to a remedy I wash with the Bareshnûm, as
*above* written; *and* to bestow the indispensable, comprehensive
Bareshnûm, as *above* written, is indeed a good work suitable for the
discreet *and* liberated

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

from bonds, and the purification of body *and* soul is connected with
it.

16\. These *things* those of the primitive faith, who provided for the
moderns, *have* communicated, whose position *was* above us moderns who
are now the law (gûn) of others, and are teachers and rulers; our
station as regards them is the position (gâsîh) of disciples *to
spiritual* masters, *that of* listeners *and* servitors to form *and*
hold the opinion, about the same and other *things*, which those of the
primitive faith formed; *and* the teaching of even one of those
high-priests is greater *and* higher than our sayings and decisions.

17\. And *as to* every custom there may be in the country of Irân, about
casting away the Bareshnûm *ceremony*, as written by me, and about all
the polluted, as *above* written--whom *it* is possible to wash, for any
indispensable reason whatever, with the Bareshnûm as written by me,
*and* one does not wash with the Bareshnûm as *written* by me, *but* is
ordered to wash for fifteen times, as written by me, *and* to pronounce
as clean--and *which* is established as a rule *one* is urged to
practise, if Zâ*d*-sparam or any one else *has* ordered, said, or
decided in the name of authority *that one* is to do *so, or has*
established *it* as a rule, *or* set *it* going, this is to give
authoritatively my opinion, decision, and enactment upon it likewise.
18. That *those* same sayings are short-sighted (aê-vênakŏ), *that* same
order is unlawfully *given, that* same decision is false teaching,
*that* same rule is vicious, *that* same setting going is grievously
sinful, and *that* same authority is not to be accepted; *it* is a
practice, therefore, not to be performed, *and* whoever *has* performed
it, is to

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

engage quickly *in* renunciation of it. 19. And he who *has* decreed in
the country of Irân, in the name of authority, washing of *other* kinds
*as* all-remedial for the polluted, as *above* written, *and has*
established a rule of that description is to be considered as a heretic
(aharmôkô) deserving death.

20\. So, when through his wilfulness that kind of injury without
enlightenment (bâm) is decreed, *and* a rule of that description is
established, as *above* written, *and one* rendered polluted is washed
fifteen times with bull's urine *and* once with water, or *in* whatever
other mode that is distinct from the Bareshnûm *ceremony* as written by
me, *though* it is possible to wash him, for any indispensable reason
whatever, with the Bareshnûm as *above* written, then, his renunciation
*of sin being* accomplished, *he* is to be washed again at the nine
ablution seats (magh) <span id="fr_1413"></span>[1](#fn_1408.md) with the
Bareshnûm as written by me; *and* until washed again, as written by me,
*he* is not to go to water and fire *and* the bowl for ablution.

21\. And this epistle is written by me, in my own *hand*-writing, for
the sake of *all* members whatever of the good religion of the country
of Irân becoming aware of the opinion, apprehension, *and* appreciation
of the commands of religion *entertained by* me, Mânû*sk*îhar, son of
Yûdân-Yim; *and* several copies are finished *in* the month of the
triumphant Ho*r*vada*d* of the year 250 of Ya*zd*aka*rd* <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[2](#fn_1409.md).

22\. In trustfulness and gratitude to the sacred beings, *and* homage to
the exalted pontiff *sent* from <span id="fr_1415"></span>[3](#fn_1410.md)

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the heavenly, most righteous, *and* glorified
Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân. 23. For the sake of obtainments of prayers the
one thing is the righteousness of the Spîtamân; great, good, *and*
perfect is Zaratû*s*t; one *only* is the way of perfect righteousness,
which is the way of those of the primitive faith; all the others,
appointed afresh, are no ways <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1](#fn_1411.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1391"></span>[359:1](sbe18122.htm#fr_1396.md) See Dd. XCIV,
13.

<span id="fn_1392"></span>[359:2](sbe18122.htm#fr_1397.md) Reading hâvan;
but it may be 'pollution of the spiritual life (ahvô),' though this is
hardly possible in the next phrase, where the same word occurs.

<span id="fn_1393"></span>[359:3](sbe18122.htm#fr_1398.md) By confounding
the preliminary washing appointed in Vend. VIII, 279 with the final
washing appointed in Vend. VIII, 299 (see App. V, and compare Ep. II,
iii, 2, ix, 2).

<span id="fn_1394"></span>[360:1](sbe18122.htm#fr_1399.md) Reading amat,
instead of the very similar word hamâî, 'ever.'

<span id="fn_1395"></span>[360:2](sbe18122.htm#fr_1400.md) See the headings
to Eps. I, II.

<span id="fn_1396"></span>[360:3](sbe18122.htm#fr_1401.md) See App. IV.

<span id="fn_1397"></span>[360:4](sbe18122.htm#fr_1402.md) Meaning this
epistle.

<span id="fn_1398"></span>[360:5](sbe18122.htm#fr_1403.md) Because it
pollutes pure water, which is considered a sin.

<span id="fn_1399"></span>[360:6](sbe18122.htm#fr_1404.md) Reading yadman;
but it may be gadman, 'glory,' which is written in precisely the same
manner.

<span id="fn_1400"></span>[360:7](sbe18122.htm#fr_1405.md) See Ep. I, ix,
7.

<span id="fn_1401"></span>[360:8](sbe18122.htm#fr_1406.md) See Vend. IX,
21-28 (App. IV)

<span id="fn_1402"></span>[361:1](sbe18122.htm#fr_1407.md) See Ep. I, v, 1.

<span id="fn_1403"></span>[361:2](sbe18122.htm#fr_1408.md) From pollution.

<span id="fn_1404"></span>[361:3](sbe18122.htm#fr_1409.md) At this point
there is a blank page in K35, and also in the MS. belonging to Mr.
Tehmuras Dinshawji, which is supposed to be older; and one line is left
blank in BK. It is not, however, <span id="page_362">p. 362</span> quite
certain that any text is really missing, as this section can be read
continuously and translated as follows, without much
difficulty:--'*Apart* from a washing of the same kind through the
Bareshnûm *ceremony*, as is intended, *there* would be a grievous sin
*against* water, fire, and other *things*, not to provide care for which
would be unauthorised.'

If some folios of text are missing, as seems quite possible from the
terms applied to this epistle in § 4, the question arises whether a
portion of the missing text may be contained in the following fragment
on the subject of the Bareshnûm, which is appended to the passage (Ep.
II, vi, 2-ix, 7) interpolated in Dd. XXXVII, 33 in the MS. J:--

'As it is declared in revelation that, if a man who *has* chanted comes
upon a corpse, *whether* a dog, or a fox, or a wolf, or a male, or a
female, or any *creature* on whose corpse it is possible *that* he *may*
come, that good man becomes so that a man *may* become defiled by him,
*and* it is necessary to wash the polluted *one*, so that it *may* not
make him a sinner. In order that they *may* act *so* to the polluted
*one* it is necessary to wash *him*, it is necessary to perform that
Bareshnûm *ceremony* of the nine nights. If the man that is spoken of
*has* worked about carrying the dead and contact with dead matter (nôsâ
hamâlih), so that they know about his defilement to whom he comes, then
he *who has* done this work *in* contact with dead matter becomes
afterwards disabled *for* that worship of the sacred beings which they
perform. So, also, *some one* says (compare Vend. VIII, 271-299), where
in a wilderness (vyâvân) are several priests (âsrûvô) *and* a man lies
*on* the road, there he *who* carries the dead *body* of the man who
passes away--as those others remain *and* stand away helpless, without
offerings of *inward* prayer (vâ*g*ŏ vakhtagân) over that person (kerpô)
according to the religious way--*having* washed his body, comes into the
town and performs the nine nights' Bareshnûm *ceremony* twice;
afterwards, his Gêtô-kharî*d* *ceremonies* (see Dd. LXXIX, 4) are
performed, *and* he has acted well according to the religious way; then
he comes into the ceremonial of the sacred beings. "How are those men
purified, O righteous *one!* who shall stand up by a corpse *which is*
very dry *and* dead a year?" (See Pahl. Vend. VIII, 107, 108.) The reply
is this, that "those men are purified; <span id="page_363">p. 363</span>
for *it* is not *to* the dry from that dryness--that is, it would not
act from this polluted *thing--that* the existence *of* dry diffusion
*has* arisen."'

<span id="fn_1405"></span>[363:1](sbe18122.htm#fr_1410.md) Even after the
best ordinary washing.

<span id="fn_1406"></span>[363:2](sbe18122.htm#fr_1411.md) See Dd. XLIII,
5.

<span id="fn_1407"></span>[363:3](sbe18122.htm#fr_1412.md) See Dd. XLVIII,
16.

<span id="fn_1408"></span>[365:1](sbe18122.htm#fr_1413.md) See §6.

<span id="fn_1409"></span>[365:2](sbe18122.htm#fr_1414.md) The third month
of the Parsi year 250, which corresponded to the interval between the
14th June and 13th July, 88 r.

<span id="fn_1410"></span>[365:3](sbe18122.htm#fr_1415.md) Reading min, as
in Ep. II, ix, 14, instead of mûn,' who.'

<span id="fn_1411"></span>[366:1](sbe18122.htm#fr_1416.md) Compare Dd.
XCIV, 14, Ep. II, ix, 15. This epistle is followed, in K35, by the
Selections of Zâ*d*-sparam, of which the first portion is translated in
the fifth volume of the Sacred Books of the East.
