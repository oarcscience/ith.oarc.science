### CHAPTER XXXV.

1\. The thirty-fourth question is that which you ask thus: Does this
world become quite without men <span id="fr_252"></span>[4](#fn_251.md), so
that *there* is no bodily existence in *it* whatever,

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

and then shall they produce the resurrection, or how is it?

2\. The reply is this, that this world, continuously from *its*
immaturity even unto *its* pure renovation, *has* never been, and also
*will* not be, without men; and *in* the evil spirit, the worthless
(a*s*apîr), no stirring desire of this arises. 3. And near to the time
of the renovation the bodily existences desist from eating, and live
without food (pavan akhûri*s*nîh) <span id="fr_253"></span>[1](#fn_252.md);
and the offspring who are born from them are those of an immortal, for
they possess durable and blood-exhausted (khûn-girâî) bodies. 4. Such
are *they* who are the bodily-existing men that are in the world when
there are men, passed *away*, who rise again and live again.
