### 1. LEGENDS RELATING TO KERESÂSP.

THE Avesta informs us that Keresâspa was a son of Thrita the Sâman, and
the brother of Urvâkhshaya <span id="fr_1417"></span>[1](#fn_1412.md). From
the name of his father's family he is sometimes called Sâma
Keresâspa <span id="fr_1418"></span>[2](#fn_1413.md), but his more usual
title is Nareman*a*u or Nairiman*a*u, 'the manly-minded <span
id="fr_1419"></span>[3](#fn_1414.md).' He is described as 'a youthful hero,
wearing side-locks and carrying a club <span
id="fr_1420"></span>[4](#fn_1415.md),' to whom the witch Knãthaiti <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[5](#fn_1416.md) attached herself; she whom Zaratû*s*t
promised to destroy by means of the apostle Saoshyãs, who is to be born
hereafter <span id="fr_1422"></span>[6](#fn_1417.md). And his body is
watched over by 99,999 guardian spirits <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[7](#fn_1418.md).

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

Of his exploits we are told that he 'slew the serpent Srvara, which
devoured horses and men, which was poisonous and yellow, over which
yellow poison flowed a hand's-breadth high. On which Keresâspa cooked a
beverage in a caldron at the midday hour, and the serpent being
scorched, hissed, sprang forth, away from the caldron, and upset the
boiling water; Keresâsp, the manly-minded, fled aside frightened <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[1](#fn_1419.md).' We are further told that he slew the
golden-heeled Ga*n*darewa <span id="fr_1425"></span>[2](#fn_1420.md); that
he smote Hitâspa in revenge for the murder of his brother,
Urvâkhshaya <span id="fr_1426"></span>[3](#fn_1421.md); that he smote the
Hunus who are the nine highwaymen, and those descended from Nivika and
Dâ*s*tayâni <span id="fr_1427"></span>[4](#fn_1422.md); also Vareshava the
Dânayan, Pitaona with the many witches, Arezô-shamana, and
Snâvidhaka <span id="fr_1428"></span>[5](#fn_1423.md); and that he
withstood many smiters or murderers <span
id="fr_1429"></span>[6](#fn_1424.md).

The details of these exploits, still extant in the Avesta, are very
scanty; but some of them appear to have been more fully described in a
legend about the soul of Keresâspa which formerly constituted the
fourteenth fargar*d* of the Sû*d*kar Nask, the contents of which are
thus summarized in the ninth book of the Dînka*rd*:--

'The fourteenth fargar*d*, A*d*-fravakhshî <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[7](#fn_1425.md), is about

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s
showing the terrible state of the soul of Keresâsp <span
id="fr_1431"></span>[1](#fn_1426.md) to Zaratû*s*t; the dismay of
Zaratû*s*t owing to that terrible state; the sorrowful speaking of
Keresâsp as regards the slaying of multitudes, for which mankind extol
him, whereby abstentions from sin *occurred*; and the recognition of him
by the creator, Aûha*r*ma*zd*, as extinguishing his fire. The
supplication of Keresâsp *for* the best existence from Aûha*r*ma*zd* for
those exploits when the serpent (gaz) Srôbar <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[2](#fn_1427.md) *was* slain by him, and the violence
of that adversary; when Gandarep <span id="fr_1433"></span>[3](#fn_1428.md)
with the golden heels *was* smitten by him, *and* the marvellousness of
that fiend; when the Hunus *of* Ve*s*kŏ <span
id="fr_1434"></span>[4](#fn_1429.md), who are

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

*descendants* of Nîvîk *and* Dâstânîk <span
id="fr_1435"></span>[1](#fn_1430.md), *were slain* by him, *and* the
grievous harm and disaster owing to them; *and* when the mighty
wind <span id="fr_1436"></span>[2](#fn_1431.md) *was* appeased by him, and
brought back from damaging the world to benefiting the creatures; *and*
for that which *happens* when, owing to confinement <span
id="fr_1437"></span>[3](#fn_1432.md), Dahâk becomes eager, rushes on for
the destruction of the world, *and* attempts the annihilation of the
creatures; *and* his being roused to smite him and to tame that powerful
fiend for the creatures of the world. The opposition of fire to
Keresâsp, through *his* causing distress to it *and* keeping away *from
it*, which *were* owing to his seeking hell; *the supplication of*
Zaratû*s*t to the fire to have compassion upon *him*, which was owing to
his sin; the compliance of the fire *with* that request; and the
departure of the soul of Keresâsp to the ever-stationary existence <span
id="fr_1438"></span>[4](#fn_1433.md). Perfect is the excellence of
righteousness <span id="fr_1439"></span>[5](#fn_1434.md).'

Although the Sû*d*kar Nask has long been lost, the legend contained in
this fourteenth fargar*d* still survives in its Pahlavi form, though
probably somewhat abridged, and a Persian paraphrase of this Pahlavi
version is also to be found in the Persian

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rivâyats <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[1](#fn_1435.md). The Pahlavi legend is included among
a series of quotations, regarding the importance of fire, contained in a
Pahlavi Rivâyat preceding the Dâ*d*istân-î Dînîk in some
manuscripts <span id="fr_1441"></span>[2](#fn_1436.md); and its close
correspondence with the' above summary of the fourteenth fargar*d* of
the Sû*d*kar Nask will be seen from the following translation of it:--

. . . . 'And *it* is declared that fire is so precious that
Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke unto Zaratû*s*t thus: "Of whose soul is it *that*
the actions' <span id="fr_1442"></span>[3](#fn_1437.md), position,
consciousness, and guardian spirit seem best when thou shalt behold
*it*?"

'And Zaratû*s*t spoke thus: "Of him who is Keresâsp."

'Aûha*r*ma*zd* summoned the soul of Keresâsp, and the soul of Keresâsp
saw <span id="fr_1443"></span>[4](#fn_1438.md) Zaratû*s*t and, on account
of the misery which it had seen in hell, it spoke unto *him* thus: "I
have been a priest of Kâpûl <span id="fr_1444"></span>[5](#fn_1439.md),
which should be a power in support of me; and for the sake of begging
life I have ever travelled through the world, and the world would have
become hideous in my eyes, the world which should have feared my
splendour <span id="fr_1445"></span>[6](#fn_1440.md)."

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

'And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "Stand off, *thou* soul of Keresâsp! for
thou shouldst be hideous in my eyes, because the fire, which is my
son <span id="fr_1446"></span>[1](#fn_1441.md), *was* extinguished by thee,
and no care *of it was* provided by thee."

And the soul of Keresâsp spoke thus: "Forgive me, O Aûha*r*ma*zd*! and
grant me the best existence! grant me the supreme heaven! The serpent
(a*z*ŏ) Srôvbar <span id="fr_1447"></span>[2](#fn_1442.md) is slain
outright, which *was* swallowing horses *and* swallowing men, and its
teeth were as long as my arm, its ear was as large as fourteen blankets
(nama*d*ŏ), its eye was as large as a wheel, and its horn was as much as
Dahâk <span id="fr_1448"></span>[3](#fn_1443.md) in height. And I was
running as much as half a day on *its* back, till *its* head *was*
smitten by me at the neck *with* a club made for *my* hand, and *it was*
slain outright by me <span id="fr_1449"></span>[4](#fn_1444.md). And if
that serpent had not been slain by me, all thy creatures would have
*been* completely annihilated by it, and thou wouldst never have known a
remedy *for* Aharman."

'Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "Stand off! for the fire, which is my son,
*was* extinguished by thee."

'Keresâsp spoke thus: "Grant me, O Aûha*r*ma*zd*! that best existence,
the supreme heaven! for by me Gandarep <span
id="fr_1450"></span>[5](#fn_1445.md) *was* slain outright, by whom twelve

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

districts *were* devoured at once. When I looked among the teeth of
Gandarep, dead men <span id="fr_1451"></span>[1](#fn_1446.md) were sticking
among his teeth; and my beard *was* seized by him, and I dragged him out
of the sea <span id="fr_1452"></span>[2](#fn_1447.md); nine days and nights
the conflict *was* maintained by us in the sea, and then I became more
powerful than Gandarep. The sole of Gandarep's foot *was* also seized by
me, and the skin *was* flayed off up to *his* head, and with it the
hands and feet of Gandarep *were* bound; *he was* also dragged by me out
to the shore of the sea, and *was* delivered by. me over *to*
Âkhrûtrag <span id="fr_1453"></span>[3](#fn_1448.md); and he slaughtered
*and* ate my fifteen horses. I also fell down in a dense thicket
(aî*s*akŏ), and Gandarep carried off *my* friend Âkhrûtrag, and she who
was my wife *was* carried off by him <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[4](#fn_1449), and my father *and* nurse (dâyakŏ.md)
*were* carried off by him. And I took under *my* protection
(dinhârîgînî*d*ŏ) and raised all the people *of* our pleasant *place*,
and every single step I sprang forward a thousand steps, and fire fell
into everything which *was* struck by my foot *as* it sprang
forward <span id="fr_1455"></span>[5](#fn_1450.md); I went out to the sea,
and they were brought back by me,

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

and Gandarep *was* taken and slain by me <span
id="fr_1456"></span>[1](#fn_1451.md). And if he had not been slain by me,
Aharman would have become predominant over thy creatures."

'Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "Stand off! for *thou art* hideous in my
eyes, because the fire, which is my son, *was* extinguished by thee."

'Keresâsp spoke thus: "Grant *me*, O Aûha*r*ma*zd*! heaven *or* the
supreme heaven! for I have slain the highwaymen <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[2](#fn_1452.md) who were so big in body that, when
they were walking, people considered in this *way*, that 'below them are
the stars and moon, and below them moves the sun *at* dawn, and the
water of the sea reaches up to their knees.' And I reached up to their
legs, and they *were* smitten on the legs by me; they fell, and the
hills on the earth *were* shattered by them <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[3](#fn_1453.md). And if those fallen <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[4](#fn_1454.md) highwaymen *had* not been slain by me,
Aharman would have become predominant over thy creatures."

'Aûha*r*ma*zd*. spoke thus: "Stand off! for thou shouldst be hideous in
my eyes, because the fire, which is my son, *was* extinguished by thee."

'Keresâsp spoke thus: "Grant me, O Aûha*r*ma*zd*! heaven *or* the
supreme heaven! When the wind *was* weakened (rakhtŏ) and paralysed by
me, the

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

demons deceived the wind, and they spoke unto the wind thus: '*He* is
more resisting thee than all the creatures and creation, and thou
shouldst think of him thus, that "there is no one walks upon this earth
more resistant of me *than* Keresâsp;" he despises demons *and* men, and
thee, too, who shouldst be the wind, *even* thee he despises.' And the
wind, when those words *were* heard by it, came on so strongly that
every tree and shrub which was in its path *was* uprooted, and the whole
earth which was in its path *was* reduced to powder (payan*g*ânŏîaîtŏ
ka*rd*ŏ), and darkness arose. And when it came to me, who am Keresâsp,
it was not possible for it to lift my foot from the ground; and I arose
and sallied forth (ba*r*â yehabûn*d*) upon the earth, and I stood *upon*
it, with both feet on an equality (mirîh), until a rampart (pû*s*tŏ) of
it *was* completed, so that I *might* go again below the earth; that
which Aûha*r*ma*zd* ordered thus: 'Should I appoint a keeper of the
earth and sky, they would not forsake me <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[1](#fn_1455.md).' And if that thing had not been done
by me, Aharman would have become predominant over thy creatures."

'Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "Stand off! for thou shouldst be hideous in
my eyes, because the fire, which is my son, *was* smitten by thee."

Keresâsp spoke thus: "Grant *me*, O Aûha*r*ma*zd*! heaven *or* the
supreme heaven! for *it* is thus

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

declared by revelation, that, when Dahâk has escaped from
confinement <span id="fr_1461"></span>[1](#fn_1456.md), no one is able to
seek *any* other remedy *against* him but me; on that account grant me
heaven *or* the supreme heaven! And if it be not possible to grant me
heaven *or* the supreme heaven, give me again the strength and success
which were mine during life! for when thou shalt give me again so much
strength and success *as* were mine when I was produced alive, I *will*
slay Aharman with the demons, I will eradicate darkness from hell, I
will complete the beautiful light, and within its sole existence
(tang-aê) <span id="fr_1462"></span>[2](#fn_1457.md) you *shall* sit and
move <span id="fr_1463"></span>[3](#fn_1458.md)."

'Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "This I *will* not give thee, *thou* soul of
Keresâsp! because men shall commit sin; and until men commit no more
sin, it is not possible to make thee alive again, and thou wouldst also
not be able to make other men alive again, for they produce the
resurrection thus, when all men become quite innocent. When men shall
die, and their souls are wicked, all comfort shall forsake them, and all
the misery and discomfort occasioned by them *shall* remain."

'When Keresâsp *and* his exploits were spoken of in this manner, the
angels of the spiritual *and* the angels of the worldly *existences*
wept aloud, and

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Zaratû*s*t the
Spîtamân wept aloud <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1](#fn_1459.md) *and* spoke
thus: "Though *there* should be no deceiver, I would be the deceiver in
*thy* eyes <span id="fr_1465"></span>[2](#fn_1460.md), O Aûha*r*ma*zd*! as
regards the soul of Keresâsp; for when Keresâsp should not have existed
as a bodily and living *existence, there* would have been no remnant of
anything whatever, or of creature of thine, in the world <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[3](#fn_1461.md)."

'When Zaratû*s*t had become silent therewith, the *angel of* fire <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[4](#fn_1462.md) stood upon *his* feet <span
id="fr_1468"></span>[5](#fn_1463.md), and the sinfulness of Keresâsp unto
himself *was* fully mentioned by him, and he spoke thus: "I shall not
let him into heaven."

'And the *angel* of fire, *having* spoken thus many

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

words, desisted; and the angel Gô*s*-aûrvan <span
id="fr_1469"></span>[1](#fn_1464.md) stood upon *her* feet, and spoke thus:
"I shall not let *him* into hell, for the benefit produced by him for me
*was* manifold,"

'Gô*s*-aûrvan, *having* spoken thus many words, desisted <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[2](#fn_1465.md); *and* Zaratû*s*t stood upon *his*
feet, and homage *was* offered by him unto the fire, and he spoke thus:
"I shall provide care for thee, and shall speak of thy exploits in the
world, and I shall speak to Vi*s*tâsp <span
id="fr_1471"></span>[3](#fn_1466.md) and *G*âmâsp <span
id="fr_1472"></span>[4](#fn_1467.md) thus 'Observe fully that a place is
made *for* the fire as *it were* at once!' when Keresâsp *has* engaged
in renunciation *of sin*, and you shall forgive him <span
id="fr_1473"></span>[5](#fn_1468.md)."'

The Pahlavi legend breaks off at this point, leaving

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

the reader to infer that Zaratû*s*t's request was granted. It is
succeeded, however, by the following further remarks about Keresâsp,
which are evidently connected with the same legend:--

'Zaratû*s*t enquired of Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[1](#fn_1469.md): "Whose is the first dead *body* thou
shalt unite (varâ*z*ês)?"

'And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus <span id="fr_1475"></span>[1](#fn_1469.md):
"*His* who is Keresâsp <span id="fr_1476"></span>[2](#fn_1470.md)."

'And it seemed grievous *to* Zaratû*s*t, and he spoke unto Aûha*r*ma*zd*
thus: "When the business of Keresâsp was the slaughter of men, why is
his the first dead *body* thou wilt prepare?"

'Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "Let it not seem grievous to thee, O
Zaratû*s*t! for if Keresâsp had not existed, and thus much work had not
been done by him, which *has* been stated, *there* would have been no
remains of thee, nor of any creature of mine."'

Besides the Persian paraphrase of this legend, in prose, the Persian
Rivâyats contain another version in metre, which consists of 173
couplets <span id="fr_1477"></span>[3](#fn_1471.md). The exploits of
Keresâsp are also mentioned in the Mainyô-i Khar*d* (XXV II, 49-53) as
follows:--

'And from Sâm the advantage was this, that by him the serpent Sruvar,
the wolf Kapô*d* which they also call P*e*han <span
id="fr_1478"></span>[4](#fn_1472.md), the water-demon Ga*n*darfi, the bird
Kamak <span id="fr_1479"></span>[5](#fn_1473.md), and the bewildering <span
id="fr_1480"></span>[6](#fn_1474.md) demon *were* slain.

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And also many
other great actions, that *were* more valuable, he performed; and he
kept back much disturbance from the world, of which, if one of those
special disturbances had remained behind, it would not have been
possible to effect the resurrection and the future existence.'

Var*s*tmânsar, the first fargar*d* remains unnamed. Whether these words
were used merely as names, or whether their insertion implies that the
fargar*d*s of these Nasks used to be recited (somewhat like those of the
Vendidâ*d*) alternately with the sections of the Gâthas, can hardly be
determined from our present information. It may be noted that the three
Nasks (Sû*d*kar, Var*s*tmânsar, and Bakô), whose contents are thus
detailed in the Dînka*rd*, all belong to the so-called gâsânîk or Gâtha
class of Nasks; but whether that term implies that they were metrical,
or merely that they were connected in some way with the Gâthas, is also
uncertain.

Ve*s*kŏ, but it is also possible to read khûnŏ-dâkŏ, 'blood-producing,'
which is fully applicable to these highway-robbers. The 'Hunus in
Vaêska' are mentioned in Âbân Yt. 54, 57 as opponents of the warrior
Tusa, but the Hunus in Zamyâ*d* Yt. 41 have no country assigned to them.

equivalent of the Av. ashem vohû, here translated, follows each summary
of the contents of a fargar*d* or Nask in the Dînka*rd*, in the same way
as ashem vohû follows each fargar*d* of the Vendidâ*d* and each section

in K35 this portion of the Rivâyat has been lost, with the first 71
folios of that MS.; it also appears to have been similarly lost from the
older MS. belonging to Mr. Tehmuras Dinshawji Anklesaria.

<span id="fn_1437"></span>[373:3](sbe18123.htm#fr_1442.md) J omits this
word.

<span id="fn_1438"></span>[373:4](sbe18123.htm#fr_1443.md) J omits the

<span id="fn_1439"></span>[373:5](sbe18123.htm#fr_1444.md) Kâbul. One of
the three most sacred fires, the Frôbak fire, is said to have been
removed by Vi*s*tâsp from Khvâri*z*em to Kâvulistân (see Bd. XVII, 6).
The Persian version has 'would to God (kâ*s*kê) I were a priest!' and
alters the rest of the sentence to correspond.

<span id="fn_1440"></span>[373:6](sbe18123.htm#fr_1445.md) Reading rê-î li;
J has 100 var, 'a hundred lakes (or ordeals or results).'

called 'the son of Ahura-mazda' in the Avesta, as in Yas: II, 18, Vend.
V, 9, &c.

<span id="fn_1442"></span>[374:2](sbe18123.htm#fr_1447.md) The Srvara of
Yas. IX, 34, Zamyâ*d* Yt. 40. The Persian version has merely azdahâ, 'a
dragon.'

<span id="fn_1443"></span>[374:3](sbe18123.htm#fr_1448.md) Or it may be
shâk, 'a bough.' The Persian version has 'eighty cubits.'

<span id="fn_1444"></span>[374:4](sbe18123.htm#fr_1449.md) The Persian
version adds 'and as I looked into its mouth, men were still hanging
about its teeth;' which was evidently suggested by what is stated in the
account of the next exploit.

<span id="fn_1445"></span>[374:5](sbe18123.htm#fr_1450.md) See [p.
371](#page_371.md), note 3.

<span id="fn_1446"></span>[375:1](sbe18123.htm#fr_1451.md) The Persian
version says 'horses and asses.'

<span id="fn_1447"></span>[375:2](sbe18123.htm#fr_1452.md) For this clause
the Persian version substitutes 'the sea was up to his knee, and his
head up to the sun.'

<span id="fn_1448"></span>[375:3](sbe18123.htm#fr_1453.md) This is merely a
guess. The word can also be read khârvarag, 'thorny, or a thorny brake;'
but it seems to be the name of some person, being followed by the word
dôstŏ, 'friend,' in the next sentence. Âkhrûra, son of Haosravangh, is
mentioned in Fravar*d*în Yt. 137, next after Sâma Keresâspa, as
'withstanding Hashi-dava (or daêva), the wicked and covetous one
destroying the world.' The Persian version omits from the dragging out
of the sea in this sentence to the slaying in the next (p. 376, line 1).

<span id="fn_1449"></span>[375:4](sbe18123.htm#fr_1454.md) BK has 'by me,'
which must be a blunder.

<span id="fn_1450"></span>[375:5](sbe18123.htm#fr_1455.md) J omits these
last seven words.

<span id="fn_1451"></span>[376:1](sbe18123.htm#fr_1456.md) The Persian
version says, 'I slew him, and as he fell down many villages and places
became desolate.'

<span id="fn_1452"></span>[376:2](sbe18123.htm#fr_1457.md) The 'nine
highwaymen' of Zamyâ*d* Yt. 41. The Persian version says 'seven.' BK has
'walked,' instead of 'slain.'

<span id="fn_1453"></span>[376:3](sbe18123.htm#fr_1458.md) Instead of this
sentence the Persian version has 'through fear of them people could not
go on any journey, and every one whom they might see, on the road that
he went, they would instantly eat up; and in three years they reckoned
three hundred thousand men they had slain and destroyed. And I fought
with them and slew all the seven.'

<span id="fn_1454"></span>[376:4](sbe18123.htm#fr_1459.md) J omits the word
'fallen.'

<span id="fn_1455"></span>[377:1](sbe18123.htm#fr_1460.md) The Persian
version has 'and as it arrived near me, it was not able to bear my foot
from the spot; and I seized the spirit of the wind, and overthrew him
with my own strength, until he made a promise thus: "I *will* go again
below the earth." And I did not keep back my hand *from* that work less
than Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the archangels ordered me.'

<span id="fn_1456"></span>[378:1](sbe18123.htm#fr_1461.md) See Byt. III,
55-61. The Persian version substitutes a legend about the gigantic bird
Kamak (also mentioned in Mkh. XXVII, 50) which overshadowed the earth,
and kept off the rain till the rivers dried up; it also ate up men and
animals as if they were grains of corn, until Keresâsp killed it by
shooting it with arrows continuously for seven days and nights.

<span id="fn_1457"></span>[378:2](sbe18123.htm#fr_1462.md) That is, when
there is only light, and no darkness.

<span id="fn_1458"></span>[378:3](sbe18123.htm#fr_1463.md) J has 'I will
sit and move alone within it;' and the Persian version has 'I will sit
alone in that place.'

<span id="fn_1459"></span>[379:1](sbe18123.htm#fr_1464.md) The Persian
version does not mention the angels and the weeping.

<span id="fn_1460"></span>[379:2](sbe18123.htm#fr_1465.md) This can also be
translated thus: 'Though thou shouldst be no deceiver, thou wouldst be a
deceiver in *my* eyes;' the words hômanâye, 'would be,' and hômanê*s*,
'thou wouldst be,' being written alike.

<span id="fn_1461"></span>[379:3](sbe18123.htm#fr_1466.md) The Persian
version of this speech is, 'O good creator! I know that hatred and anger
are not in thy path, and when any one indulges in hatred of another,
there is no acquiescence of thine therein, yet now I see this matter as
though some one maintained hatred against another.'

<span id="fn_1462"></span>[379:4](sbe18123.htm#fr_1467.md) The Persian
version says 'the archangel Ardîbahi*s*t,' who is the protector of fire
(see Sls. XV, 5, 12, 13).

<span id="fn_1463"></span>[379:5](sbe18123.htm#fr_1468.md) The Persian
version proceeds, and concludes the sentence, as follows: 'and Keresâsp
groaned unto Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân, and Ardîbahi*s*t, the archangel,
said: "'O Zaratu*s*t! thou dost not know what Keresâsp has done unto me;
that in the world, formerly, my custom and habit would have been so,
that, as they would place firewood under a caldron, I would send the
fire, until that caldron should be boiled, and their work should be
completed, *and* then it would have come back to its own place. As that
serpent that he speaks of *was* slain he became hungry, and because the
fire fell one moment later upon the firewood which he had placed below
the caldron, he smote the fire *with* a club and scattered the fire,
*and* now I *will* not pass the soul of Keresâsp to heaven."'

<span id="fn_1464"></span>[380:1](sbe18123.htm#fr_1469.md) Av. g*e*u*s*
urva, 'the soul of the ox,' that is, of the primeval ox, from which all
the lower animals are supposed to have been developed. This angel, who
is usually called Gô*s*, is said to be a female, and is the protectress
of cattle (see Bd. IV, 2-5); in this capacity she is supposed to be
friendly to Keresâsp, whose exploits had chiefly consisted in slaying
the destroyers of animal life.

<span id="fn_1465"></span>[380:2](sbe18123.htm#fr_1470.md) The Persian
version omits these words, and the preceding paragraph, proceeding in
continuation of note 5, p. 379, as follows: 'And as Ardîbahi*s*t, the
archangel, spoke these words, the soul of Keresâsp wept and said:
"Ardîbahi*s*t, the archangel, speaks truly; I committed sin and I
repent." And he touched the skirt of Zaratû*s*t *with his* hand, and
said: "Of mankind no one has obtained the eminence, rank, and dignity
that thou obtainedst; now, through this grandeur and glory which is
thine, do thou entreat and make intercession of Ardîbahi*s*t, the
archangel, for me! so that it may be that I obtain liberation from this
distress and torment."'

<span id="fn_1466"></span>[380:3](sbe18123.htm#fr_1471.md) See Dd. XXXVII,
36.

<span id="fn_1467"></span>[380:4](sbe18123.htm#fr_1472.md) See Dd. XLIV,
r6.

<span id="fn_1468"></span>[380:5](sbe18123.htm#fr_1473.md) The Persian
version continues as follows: 'And as Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân made
intercession, Ardîbahi*s*t, the archangel, said: "Thy reputation is
immense, and thy will is great." And after that he made no opposition to
the soul of Keresâsp, but pardoned *it* for Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân; and
the soul of Keresâsp obtained liberation from that discomfort.' This
version then concludes with an admonition as to the necessity of
treating fire with proper respect.

<span id="fn_1469"></span>[381:1](sbe18123.htm#fr_1475.md) J omits the
following words as far as the next 'thus.'

<span id="fn_1470"></span>[381:2](sbe18123.htm#fr_1476.md) Referring to the
revival of Keresâsp from his trance, in order to destroy Dahâk, which is
expected to take place before the general resurrection (see Bd. XXIX, 8,
Byt. III, 59--61).

<span id="fn_1471"></span>[381:3](sbe18123.htm#fr_1477.md) In B29, fols.
169-171, it is quoted from 'the book of Bahirâm Fîrûz.'
