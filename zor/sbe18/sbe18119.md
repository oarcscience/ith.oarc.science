### CHAPTER VII.

1\. A well-reflecting *person*, moreover, is able to understand that
which is written by me, in private, in writing unto the good *people* of
Sîrkân, as perhaps a legitimate copy <span
id="fr_1364"></span>[5](#fn_1359) of a writing of that kind from

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

me *may be* near you; and it was like the production of some one for the
tearing and rending of his own limbs, and for the purpose of bringing on
that remedy--the burning, torturing medicine that is religious <span
id="fr_1365"></span>[1](#fn_1360)--whose purpose is to remain *away*
from the steadfast while *abiding* by the commands of religion. 2. This
*same* epistle <span id="fr_1366"></span>[2](#fn_1361), which *was* one
of very great incompleteness, and one as *it were* thinking very
severely, *was* similar to the decision (azad <span
id="fr_1367"></span>[3](#fn_1362)) *to* which I *have* come on the same
subject, *which is* written *of* below and again; and accompanying this
epistle *was* a man of my own with a further epistle <span
id="fr_1368"></span>[4](#fn_1363). 3. I am discharging (vi*g*ârakŏ) my
own *duty* as regards it <span id="fr_1369"></span>[5](#fn_1364), where
I so arrange affairs of every kind which *it* is possible for me to
complete *for* a *period* of three months <span
id="fr_1370"></span>[6](#fn_1365), *and* come myself to *where* you are,
and that mastery (*k*îrîh) which is prepared is again arranged when it
is wanted by them <span id="fr_1371"></span>[7](#fn_1366).

4\. You *have* already become a reserver (khamo-*s*î*d*âr) and rapid
preparer of the adaptation of words in which cogency *exists*, and
*have* clearly explained

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

as much as is in sight about the reason of altering that decree,
concerning which your opinion is written with great judiciousness. 5.
But *as to* the understanding which prompted you to write properly, and
not to alter the rites *and* purifications of the Avesta, and about the
duty of purifying the purifiers <span id="fr_1372"></span>[1](#fn_1367),
such as *has* entered into the practice of the good, the propriety is
declared in the teaching of the high-priests; *and* to do *it* better,
so far as is possible, is to strive forwards in goodness.

6\. Also, as regards changing the law of the fifteen times
*washing* <span id="fr_1373"></span>[2](#fn_1368), just as *it is* for
Irân *in* which purifiers are to be found, it is ordered for *places* to
be found without purifiers; *and it is* in the countries of Irân that
the order is given regarding purifiers not thus appointed for the work.
