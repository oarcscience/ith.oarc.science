### CHAPTER XXV.

1\. The twenty-fourth question is that which you ask thus: When he who
is wicked shall die, where is the place the soul sits the first night,
the second, and the third; and what does it say and do?

2\. The reply is this, that those three nights the soul is upon earth,
*and* notices about the thoughts, words, and deeds of its own body; *it*
is doubtful about its own position, and experiences grievous fear of the
account, great terror of the bridge, and perplexing fear on account of
hell 3. Thought is oppressive as an indicator of fear, and the soul, in
a manner the spirit of the body, is a computer <span
id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_167) and acquirer of acquaintance by sight
about the good works which it *has* not done, and the sin which it *has*
committed.

4\. And the first night *it* is hastening away from

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

its own evil thoughts, the second night from its own evil words, and the
third night from its own evil deeds; but, owing to the good works which
it has done in the world, the first night the spirit of *its* good
thoughts, the second night the spirit of *its* good words, and the third
night the spirit of *its* good deeds, come unto the soul, and become
pleasing and commendable to it.

5\. And the third night, on the fresh arrival of a dawn, its sin, in the
frightful, polluted shape of a maiden (*k*arâtîk) who is an injurer,
comes to meet *it* with the store of its sin; and a stinking
northerly <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_168) wind comes out to meet
*it*, and it comes on shudderingly, quiveringly <span
id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_169), and unwillingly running to the account.
6. And through being deceived and deceiving, heresy (a*v*ârûn-dînôîh),
unrelenting and false <span id="fr_171"></span>[3](#fn_170) accusation
of constant companions, and the wide-*spread* sinfulness of a fiend-like
existence (drû*g*-stihîh) it is ruined, falls from the bridge, *and* is
precipitated to hell.
