### CHAPTER LXIII.

1\. The sixty-second question is that which you ask thus: Would they
authorisedly carry off any property whatever from foreigners and
infidels, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that wealth and property and anything that
foreigners (an-aîrânŏ) possess and is carried off by them from the good
with violence, *and which through* obstinacy they do not give back

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

when it is proper, it is well allowable in *that* case that they should
seize from the foreigners. 3. So long as *it* is the lawful order of the
procurator of its owners <span id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_723) *it* is
allowable for a just decider to consider properly, and to demand
authoritatively the sending of interest (sû*d*ŏ) thereon for himself. 4.
But *if* they proceed in their obstinacy *he* is sent to come *up* with
them in obstinacy, not to dissemble with them <span
id="fr_727"></span>[2](#fn_724).

5\. *It is* the custom to give an infidel (ak-dînô), who is not a
foreigner, food, clothing, *and* medicine, when his renunciation (vâ*z*)
has come, for keeping away matters (*k*isânŏ) of death and sickness
owing to hunger *and* thirst, cold and heat; but wealth, horses,
accoutrements, wine, *and* land are not given authorisedly, it is said,
unto foreigners *and* idolators <span id="fr_728"></span>[3](#fn_725).

<span id="fn_723"></span>[197:1](sbe18070.htm#fr_726) Reading vad zak
amata*s* khû*d*âyân ayâ*v*î-aîtâr farmân-î dâ*d*îk. The form of
ayâ*v*î-aîtâr has not yet been met with elsewhere, but it seems to mean
'one who holds the obtainment,' though whether as agent or officer of
justice is uncertain.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[197:2](sbe18070.htm#fr_727) M14 has merely
'but should they proceed in their obstinacy, to come with them is not to
dissemble.'

<span id="fn_725"></span>[197:3](sbe18070.htm#fr_728) Literally
'demon-worshippers.'
