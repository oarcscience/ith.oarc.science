### CHAPTER LXV.

1\. *As to* the sixty-fourth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: Where *and* from what did the origin of race, *which* they say
*was* next-of-kin marriage (khvêtûdâ*d*ŏ) <span
id="fr_737"></span>[3](#fn_734.md), arise; and from what place did it
arise?

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

2\. The reply is this, that the first consummation of next-of-kin
marriage was owing to that *which* Mashyâîh *and* Mashyâyôîh <span
id="fr_738"></span>[1](#fn_735.md) did, who were brother and sister
together, and their consummation of intercourse produced a son <span
id="fr_739"></span>[2](#fn_736.md) as a consummation of the first
next-of-kin marriage. 3. So that they effected the first intercourse of
man with woman, *and* the entire progress of the races of every kind of
lineage of men arose from that, *and* all the men *of* the world are of
that race.

4\. It is truly said, that it was the joy of the lord *and* creator
after the creation of the creatures, and, owing to that, its
consummation, which *was* his complete accomplishment of the existence
of the creatures (dâmânîh), was owing to him. 5. And its occurrence,
too, is in evidence that the creator, who is so with unflinching
(atôrâk) will, is as much *the cause of* the begetting and entire
progress of his own perfect creatures <span
id="fr_740"></span>[3](#fn_737.md), in whom begetting is by destiny, as
Hôshâng <span id="fr_741"></span>[4](#fn_738.md) by whom two-thirds <span
id="fr_742"></span>[5](#fn_739.md) of the demons *were* smitten,
Tâkhmôrup <span id="fr_743"></span>[6](#fn_740.md) who overturned Aharman
through the power of the angels, Yim by

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

whom order *was* arranged and death *was* driven away (avakâl*d*ŏ) <span
id="fr_744"></span>[1](#fn_741.md), Frê*d*ûn *who* fettered A*z*-î
Dahâk <span id="fr_745"></span>[2](#fn_742.md) and stripped his blaspheming
(nîrangâk) from the world, and the many princes (kayân) and high-priests
of grave spirit *who* were, *and* are, *and will* be.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_734"></span>[199:3](sbe18072.htm#fr_737.md) Usually written
khvêtûk-das (Av. *hv*aêtvadatha, 'a giving of, or to, one's own'). It is
a term applied to marriages between near relations, and is extolled as
specially meritorious. For centuries past the Parsis have understood it
to refer to marriages between first cousins, and all allusions to
marriage between nearer relations they attribute to the practices of
heretics (see Sls. XVIII, 4 n); though, like the professors of all other
religions, they must admit the necessity of such a practice in the first
family of mankind, as detailed in the text. Translations of other
passages relating to the subject will be found in Appendix III, and it
is also mentioned in Chaps. XXXVII, 82, LXXVII, 6, and LXXVIII, 19.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[200:1](sbe18072.htm#fr_738.md) See Chap. LXIV, 2.
The names are here written Mashyêîh and Mashyêyôîh.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[200:2](sbe18072.htm#fr_739.md) Twins, according
to Bd. XV, 22, 24.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[200:3](sbe18072.htm#fr_740.md) That is, he is not
only the original creator, but also the perpetual promoter of the
increase and progress of the creation, as much as those who appear to be
such promoters, though merely acting as his agents.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[200:4](sbe18072.htm#fr_741.md) Here written
Hôshyâng. For the Av. names of these four primeval monarchs, see Chap.
II, 10 n.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[200:5](sbe18072.htm#fr_742.md) K35 has
'three-thirds,' but see Âbân Yt. 22, Râm Yt. 8, Zamyâ*d* Yt. 26.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[200:6](sbe18072.htm#fr_743.md) He is said to have
subjugated the evil spirit, and to have used him as a steed for thirty
years (see Chaps. II, 10, XXXVII, 35).

<span id="fn_741"></span>[201:1](sbe18072.htm#fr_744.md) He is said to have
kept away cold and heat, decay and death, and other evils from the earth
(see Râm Yt. 16, Zamyâ*d* Yt. 33).

<span id="fn_742"></span>[201:2](sbe18072.htm#fr_745.md) See Chap. XXXVII,
97.
