### CHAPTER XXI.

1\. The twentieth question is that which you ask thus: How are the
*K*inva*d* bridge, the Dâîtih peak (*k*akâ*d*), and the path of the
righteous and wicked;

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

how *are they* when *one* is righteous, and how when *one* is wicked?

2\. The reply is this, that thus the high-priests *have* said, that the
Dâîtih peak <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_135.md) is in
Aîrân-vê*g* <span id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_136.md), 2, in the middle of
the world; reaching unto the vicinity of that peak is that beam-shaped
(dâr-kerpô) spirit, the *K*inva*d* bridge <span
id="fr_138"></span>[3](#fn_137.md), which is thrown *across* from the
Albûr*z* enclosure (var) back to the Dâîtih peak. 3. As *it were* that
bridge is like a beam of many sides, of whose edges (pô*s*tŏ) there are
*some* which are broad, and there are *some* which are thin *and* sharp;
its broad sides (sûkîhâ) are so large that its width is twenty-seven
reeds (nâî), and its sharp sides are so contracted (tang) that in
thinness *it* is just like the edge of a razor. 4. And when the' souls
of the righteous and wicked arrive it turns to that side which is
*suitable to* their necessities, through the great glory of the creator
and the command of him who *takes* the just account <span
id="fr_139"></span>[4](#fn_138.md).

5\. Moreover, the bridge becomes a broad bridge for the righteous, as
much as the height of nine spears (nî*z*akŏ)--and the length of those
which they carry is each separately three reeds <span
id="fr_140"></span>[5](#fn_139.md)--; and

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

it becomes a narrow bridge *for* the wicked, even unto a resemblance to
the edge of a razor. 6. And he who is of the righteous passes over the
bridge, and a worldly similitude of the pleasantness of his path upon it
is when thou shalt eagerly and unweariedly walk in the golden-coloured
spring, and *with* the gallant (hû-*k*îr <span
id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_140).md) body and sweet-scented blossom in the
pleasant skin of that maiden <span id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_141.md)
spirit, the price of goodness. 7. He who is of the wicked, as he places
a footstep *on* to the bridge, on account of affliction (siparîh) and
*its* sharpness, falls from the middle of the bridge, and rolls *over*
head-foremost. 8. And the unpleasantness of his path to hell is in
similitude such as the worldly *one* in the midst of that stinking *and*
dying existence (hastân), there where numbers of the sharp-pointed darts
(tê*z*ŏ mûk dû*g*ŏ) are planted <span id="fr_143"></span>[3](#fn_142.md)
out inverted and point upwards, and they come unwillingly running; they
shall not allow *them* to stay behind, *or* to make delay. 9. So much
greater *than* the worldly similitude is that pleasantness and
unpleasantness unto the souls, as such as is fit for the spirit is
greater than *that* fit for the world.

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

1\. The twenty-first question is that which you ask thus: When he who is
righteous passes away, who has performed much worship of the sacred
beings, and many duties and good works, do the spirit of creation, the
spirit of the *sacred* ceremony (ya*z*isnŏ) and religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, the water, earth, plants, and animals, make
complaint unto Aûha*r*ma*zd*, owing to the passing away of him who is
righteous, and is it distressing to them when he goes out from the
world, or how is it?

2\. The reply is this, that *as to* him who is of the righteous, in
*his* transit of worldly pain in passing away, and also after passing
away to the passage onwards <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_143.md) which
is his limit (stâr) still in the perplexing account, and, after the
account, in his own joy, and in what *occurs* when his gossips
(hamvâ*k*ân) in the world--by whom the spiritual beings are also not
unrecognised; *nor* his position unknown--are in worldly demeanour
downcast and grieving, *on all these occasions* <span
id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_144.md) *his* thoughts, procuring forgiveness,
are about the sacred beings. 3. And the spirit of creation, *and* the
good spirit of the religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, which are in the
worldly *existence*--of which <span id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_145.md)
also, in the world, that righteous *one* is a praiser, an employer, a
manager, a protection, and a forbearing friend--shall make an outcry to

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

the creator about him who is righteous, who is *away* from worldly
protection, *also* for the granting of a promoter of forbearance, and
*for* a restorer (â*v*ôr*d*âr) of what is extorted <span
id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_146.md); *likewise* a petition about the
compensatory concomitants as to his new protection and disposer.

4\. And the almighty creator responds, *and* allots a teacher <span
id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_147.md) for smiting the fiend, for the
satisfaction of the righteous, *and* for the protection of the good
creatures. 5. As it is said, that in every age a high-priest of the
religion and *his* managing of the creatures are made manifest, in whom,
in that age, the protection of the creatures and the will of the sacred
beings are progressing.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_135"></span>[48:1](sbe18029.htm#fr_136.md) The *K*akâ*d*-i
Dâitîk of Bd. XII, 7.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[48:2](sbe18029.htm#fr_137.md) The primeval home
of Ma*zd*a-worship (see Vend. I, 5, 6), which the Bundahi*s* places 'in
the direction of Âdarbî*g*ân;' it is also stated to contain the Dâîtîk
or Dâîtih river (which must not be confounded with the Dâîtih peak) and
the Dâra*g*a river (on whose bank Zaratû*s*t's father is said to have
dwelt), and to have been the scene of Zaratû*s*t's first promulgation of
the religion (Bd. XX, 13, 32, XXIX, 12, XXXII, 3). Its winter is
likewise described as both long and cold (Vend. I, 8-12, Bd. XXV, 11,
16), which is the case in Âdarbî*g*ân.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[48:3](sbe18029.htm#fr_138.md) See Chap. XX, 3.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[48:4](sbe18029.htm#fr_139.md) The angel Rashnû.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[48:5](sbe18029.htm#fr_140.md) The nine spears of
three reeds each, in length, making up the <span id="page_49">p.
49</span> twenty-seven reeds mentioned in § 3. As the reed appears to
have been about 4 feet 8 inches (see Chap. XLIII, 5, note), the width of
the bridge is supposed to be about 126 feet, and the length of a spear
is taken as 14 feet.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[49:1](sbe18029.htm#fr_141.md) So in the MSS., but
hû-*k*ihar, 'handsome,' is more probable.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[49:2](sbe18029.htm#fr_142.md) Reading kanîkŏ,
instead of the kanâkŏ of the MSS., as there can be no allusion to the
evil spirit here. The reference is to a good conscience, which is
symbolised by the handsome maiden who is supposed to meet the righteous
soul on its way to heaven (see Chap. XXIV, 5).

<span id="fn_142"></span>[49:3](sbe18029.htm#fr_143.md) Assuming that
â*g*zast is equivalent to Pers. â*g*ast. The allusion seems to be to a
form of torturing punishment (running upon ground studded with sharp
points) well known to the author.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[50:1](sbe18029.htm#fr_144.md) The *K*inva*d*
bridge, near which the soul's account is rendered.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[50:2](sbe18029.htm#fr_145.md) The sentence is
clear enough in Pahlavi, but too involved to be readily understood in
English without these extra words.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[50:3](sbe18029.htm#fr_146.md) The worldly
existences which those spirits represent.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[51:1](sbe18029.htm#fr_147.md) These latter
clauses of the outcry refer to their own wants, and the necessity of
providing some one to take the place of the deceased; but the final
petition seems to be for the deceased himself.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[51:2](sbe18029.htm#fr_148.md) The word maybe
either farhakhtâkŏ, 'preparing, educating,' or firî*s*tâkŏ, 'sending,
deputing,' and must be used as a substantive.
