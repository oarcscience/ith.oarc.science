### CHAPTER LVIII.

1\. The fifty-seventh question is that which you ask thus: How many
kinds of family guardianship and adoption are *there?*

2\. The reply is this, that it is said *there* are three kinds, which
are the existent, the provided, and the appointed. 3. An adopted son who
is existent is such as a wife who may be privileged, *or* an only
daughter is a kind of adopted son owing to confidence in herself, such
as happens when there is no wife, *and* a daughter for whom there is no
husband, *and* none is provided, is the one *that* has remained.

4\. An adopted son *who* is provided is such *as* a son that is
acknowledged, who is accepted by one's self <span
id="fr_705"></span>[1](#fn_702.md), and *free* from *being* appointed, or
*from* necessity <span id="fr_706"></span>[2](#fn_703.md).

5\. And an adopted son who is appointed is he who is to be appointed
among the relations who are suitable for adoption--and are nearest to
him who is to be appointed *as* adopted son--and the ministers (pa*d*ân)
of religion, *and* he performs the duty of

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

family guardianship <span id="fr_707"></span>[1](#fn_704.md); he who is the
appointed *one* is he who is appointed by the men *who are* the nearest
relations (nabânazdi*s*tânŏ) on account of proximity.

during the man's lifetime.

nîyâ*z*ŏ, but it may be ayûfŏ êyâ*v*ŏ, 'or *from* discovery.'

<span id="fn_704"></span>[192:1](sbe18065.htm#fr_707.md) M14 has 'an
existent family guardianship is *in* the son of him appointed, and a
provided *one* is that when he himself performs the duty in the
guardianship;' but the phrase interpolated is hardly grammatical.
