### CHAPTER LXIV.

1\. *As to* the sixty-third question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: Whence *was* the first creation of mankind, and how was the
formation of the original race of men? 2. What issued from
Gâyômar*d* <span id="fr_729"></span>[4](#fn_726.md), *and* what did it
really become; and from what have Mashyâîh *and* Mashyâyôîh <span
id="fr_730"></span>[5](#fn_727.md) arisen?

3\. The reply is this, that Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the all

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

ruling, produced from the endless light the shape of a fire-priest
(âsrûkŏ) whose name *was* that of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and *its* brilliance
that of fire; *its* incombustibility was like *that* inside the light,
*and its* expansion like the western (khûrbarag) land. 4. And in the
shape of the fire-priest *was* created by him the material existence
(stih) *that* is called man, *and for* three thousand years <span
id="fr_731"></span>[1](#fn_728.md), when it did not progress and did not
eat, it did not speak; likewise, it did not utter, but it thought of,
the righteousness of the perfect *and* true religion, the desire for the
pure glorification of the creator.

5\. Afterwards, the contentious promise-breaker <span
id="fr_732"></span>[2](#fn_729.md) injured the life of it, *and* produced a
burdensome mortality; and the mortality is *clear* from the appellation,
Gâyômar*d* <span id="fr_733"></span>[3](#fn_730.md), of the nature
produced. 6. The seed which *was* the essence of the life of the leader
(mîrakŏ) of life, who *was* Gâyômar*d*, flowed forth on *his* passing
away, came on to the earth of the beneficent angel <span
id="fr_734"></span>[4](#fn_731.md), *and* is preserved in the earth until,
through the protection of the angels, a brother and

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

sister of mankind <span id="fr_735"></span>[1](#fn_732.md), connected
together, have grown from it, *have* attained to movement *and* walking
upon the earth, *and* have advanced even to intercourse and also
procreation.

7\. The ground where the life of Gâyômar*d* departed is gold, *and* from
the other land, where the dissolution of *his* various members occurred,
as many kinds of decorative metals flowed forth it is said <span
id="fr_736"></span>[2](#fn_733.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_726"></span>[197:4](sbe18071.htm#fr_729.md) See Chap. II, 10.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[197:5](sbe18071.htm#fr_730.md) The same as the
Marhayâ and Marhîyôih of Chap. XXXVII, 82.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[198:1](sbe18071.htm#fr_731.md) This is the second
of the four periods of three thousand years of which time is said to be
composed (see Chap. XXXVII, 11 n). The 'shape of the fire-priest' is one
of the spiritual creations of the first period, in which shape man was
created during the second period, and this primeval man became
Gâyômar*d* (that is, 'a living mortal') through the persecution of the
evil spirit (see § 5) at the commencement of the third period. The first
two steps of this creation are not described to the text of the
Bundahi*s* known to Europeans.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[198:2](sbe18071.htm#fr_732.md) The evil spirit,
who is said to be the origin of falsehood (see Chap. XXXVII, 17).

<span id="fn_730"></span>[198:3](sbe18071.htm#fr_733.md) Which means 'the
living mortal,' or 'the mortal living one.'

<span id="fn_731"></span>[198:4](sbe18071.htm#fr_734.md) The female
archangel Spenda*r*ma*d*, who has special charge of the earth. Or the
phrase may be 'came on to the earth which the beneficent spirit
produced.'

<span id="fn_732"></span>[199:1](sbe18071.htm#fr_735.md) The Mashyâîh and
Mashyâyôîh, or man and woman, of § 2, who are said to have grown up, in
the course of forty years, connected together in the shape of a plant;
but, after a breathing soul had entered them, they became human beings,
and fifty. years later they began to be the progenitors of mankind (see
Bd. XV, 1-30).

<span id="fn_733"></span>[199:2](sbe18071.htm#fr_736.md) Zs. X, 2 states
that eight kinds of metal arose from the various members of the dead
Gâyômar*d*, namely, gold, silver, iron, brass, tin, lead, quicksilver,
and adamant.
