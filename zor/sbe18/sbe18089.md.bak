### CHAPTER LXXXII.

1\. *As to* the eighty-first question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: *As to* a man who shall order a ceremonial *and* shall give the
money (diram), and the man who shall undertake his ceremonial

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

and shall take his money, *but has* not performed the ceremonial, what
is then the decision and what is then the decision *about* the man who
ordered the ceremonial?

2\. The reply is this, that the merit of a ceremonial not performed is
not set going, and does not come to the soul of the undertaker who shall
take money for it, *nor* even *to* that of the orderer who gave money
for it. 3. But, *as to* him who is the orderer, since his mental
meritoriousness is so steadfast that he gave his money, the efficacy
(tûban) of the good work, mentally his own, *has* not stayed *away* from
him, because he gave money authorisedly for the good work; the decision,
then, *about* him is such as *about him* to whom harm occurs in
performing a good work for the religion. 4. It is said that the angels
so recompense him that he does not consider it as *any* other harm; and
as much as the good money given <span id="fr_917"></span>[1](#fn_914.md)
for the sacred feast <span id="fr_918"></span>[2](#fn_915.md) *and*
ceremonial is then the pleasure *which* comes unto his soul, as much as
would have been possible to arise in the world from that money.

5\. And he who shall take his money, and did not perform his ceremonial,
is just as though he had abstracted from the angels <span
id="fr_919"></span>[3](#fn_916.md) and the righteous guardian spirits,
*and* destroyed, as much propitiation as would have been possible from
that ceremonial; and he is, therefore, overwhelmed by it <span
id="fr_920"></span>[4](#fn_917.md), and expiates *it* in the soul.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_914"></span>[243:1](sbe18089.htm#fr_917.md) M14 has 'the money
given by him,' which may be correct.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[243:2](sbe18089.htm#fr_918.md) See Chap, XLVII,
I.

<span id="fn_916"></span>[243:3](sbe18089.htm#fr_919.md) K35 has 'the
good.'

<span id="fn_917"></span>[243:4](sbe18089.htm#fr_920.md) Or, we might
perhaps read 'thereby. it is his overwhelming (astarî*d*ŏ),' supposing
astarî*d*ŏ to be a technical term implying a <span id="page_244">p.
244</span> flogging, as appears probable from a passage in Farh. Okh. p.
34, 11. 1, 2, which, when restored to its form in the oldest MSS., runs
as follows:--Astarî*d*anô â*s*kârîh astaraspân sna*s* pavan vinâs, which
may be translated 'the manifestation of "overwhelming" is the blow of
horsewhips for sin;' assuming that astarasp is equivalent to aspô
a*s*tar, the usual translation of Av. aspahê a*s*traya, 'with a
horsewhip.'
