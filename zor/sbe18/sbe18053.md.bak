### CHAPTER XLVI.

7\. The forty-fifth question is that which you ask thus: Is it allowable
*that* those of the priesthood, when there is no daily livelihood for
them from the life of the priesthood, should abandon the priesthood, and
*that* other work *be* done, or not?

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

2\. The reply is this, that there is no loss of reputation to priests
from priestly duties (aêrpatîh), which are themselves the acquired
knowledge *that* is accumulated *by* the priestly disposition, care for
the soul, *and* the requisite good works. 3. *And* there is this
advantage, that, through acquaintance with the religion *of* the sacred
beings, *and* certainty as to the reward of the spirit, they make *them*
become more contented in adversity, more intelligent as regards
stability of character in difficulty *and* restriction, and more through
knowledge the abode of hope for those saved. 4. So that it is not fit
they should abandon the priesthood, which is both harmless *and* an
employment *with* advantages *that has* required much trouble to learn.

5\. But, indeed, when they do not obtain <span
id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_564.md) a daily livelihood from priestly duty,
and the good do not give them chosen righteous gifts <span
id="fr_568"></span>[2](#fn_565.md) for it, and they do not let *them*
obtain *any* from next of kin *or* the wicked even by begging, a
livelihood *may be* requested from the paid performance of ceremonies,
management of all religious rites (dînô), *and* other priestly
disciple's duty therein <span id="fr_569"></span>[3](#fn_566.md). 6. When
even by that they do not obtain *it, they* are to seek a livelihood by
agriculture, sheep-rearing, penmanship, *or* other proper employment
among priests; *and* when *it* is not possible for them to live even by
these, *they are to seek it* by bearing arms, hunting, *or* other proper
employment in the profession of a virtuous warrior. 7. And when even it
is not

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

possible for them to maintain their own bodies, which are in requisite
control, by that which is cravingly digested, *they* are to beg a
righteous gift <span id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_567.md) authorisedly
(dastôbarîhâ) as an effectual remedy; by living idly, or not expending
strength, their own bodies, which are in control, are without
livelihood, but not authorisedly <span id="fr_571"></span>[2](#fn_568.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_564"></span>[154:1](sbe18053.htm#fr_567.md) K35 has 'beg,'
both here and in § 6, the difference between the two words in Pahlavi
being only a stroke.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[154:2](sbe18053.htm#fr_568.md) See Chap. XL IV,
19.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[154:3](sbe18053.htm#fr_569.md) That is, from the
general funds of the priesthood.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[155:1](sbe18053.htm#fr_570.md) That is, charity.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[155:2](sbe18053.htm#fr_571.md) That is, they are
not authorised to beg charity for maintaining themselves in idleness.
