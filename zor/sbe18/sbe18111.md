### CHAPTER X.

1\. And *as to* the many other *matters to* which an explicit reply is
not written by me--be it the determinableness of it, be it, the flow of
*inward* prayer <span id="fr_1223"></span>[2](#fn_1219.md), be it the
pouring of the water, and likewise the rest which is written *to*
me--the statements, when de-liberation and conjecture about such
arrangements become needful, are not *to be made* unto the multitude,
but *unto* the priestly at once <span id="fr_1224"></span>[3](#fn_1220.md).
2. And this much, also, which is written by me is on this account <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[4](#fn_1221.md), *that* when a writing has come to you
which is the purport of my re-explanation, *and it has* seemed that it
is written after *well*-weighed (sakhtakŏ) observations <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[5](#fn_1222.md), even so they *would* cause *some* of
those of good desires to understand, who are thoughtful friends of the
soul *and* observers of

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

*well*-weighed *ideas*, in whose heart and mind, owing to that *other*
writing <span id="fr_1227"></span>[1](#fn_1223.md), the existence of
doubtfulness may fully remain; and, owing to that, this much
re-explanation *has*, indeed, seemed to me good.

3\. And then the desire <span id="fr_1228"></span>[2](#fn_1224.md) to
sprinkle <span id="fr_1229"></span>[3](#fn_1225.md) in many modes is also
an incorrect presentation <span id="fr_1230"></span>[4](#fn_1226.md), on
which same subject there is this in consideration, that afterwards,
peradventure, the same priestly man <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[5](#fn_1227.md) by whom it is written *may*
come--whose assured wisdom <span id="fr_1232"></span>[6](#fn_1228.md) may
the angels make steadfast! *and* whom my approaching causing a purifier
to travel for *various* quarters *has* occasioned to write it--so that
while they are, therefore, awed by him, and shall provide more
completely for use the full measure of water *and* bull's urine, the
complete words of the Avesta, *and* other proper rites, they shall
proceed more approvably. 4. And if *it be* even not auxiliary for the
same purpose (âhanŏ) *that it was* written by him--except, indeed,
through consideration of its details--no reason for a writing of that
kind is to be assigned.

5\. But if for the reason *it was* written by him *it be* manifest as an
existence which is very little threatening, then I consider his opinion,
which is in his decree, not so perplexing; and, till <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[7](#fn_1229.md) now, the perplexing consideration
*was* more particularly as

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

to that, when, owing to the great learning thereof to be seen by me,
this was not doubtful, that *as to* the great opinion of the world
*about* the existing law of the profession of the priesthood, *and* the
practice of all those of the good religion of the realm, they should
make a decree only by the deliberation of me and other priestly men
*and* religious observers <span id="fr_1234"></span>[1](#fn_1230.md). 6.
For if even he retorts a further statement <span
id="fr_1235"></span>[2](#fn_1231.md) as to the appointed observance, *its*
origin is then also a propagation from the diverse teachings of those
great high-priests of those of the primitive faith, *who* were they
*who* have been formerly great.

7\. On account of the depth and much intricacy of the religion they
mention many opinions *and* well-considered decrees *which were*
likewise formed devoid of uniformity, *and* the utterance *of* the
different opinions of the priests is with the reciters of the Nasks; but
even among themselves the most supremely just high-priests were of a
different opinion, different judgment, different teaching, different
interpretation, and different practice only in the peace, mutual
friendship, and affection which they had together. 8. Just as that even
which was prominent about these chief priests (magôpatânŏ magôpatŏ),
whose names *were* Âtûrŏ-Frôbagvindâ*d* and Âtûrŏ-bû*g*êd, who have
been, each separately, the high-priest of the realm of the true religion
and the scholar of the age.

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

9\. To many, when an opinion is afterwards so obtained, *pertaining* to
the high-priests *in* the spiritual *existence* <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[1](#fn_1232.md), *it* is as is said about Zaratû*s*t
the Spîtamân, that 'the first time when the arch-angels are seen by him,
the Spîtamân, *it* is then supposed by him that they are Aîndar, Sârû,
Nâki*s*îyyâ, Tâûîrê*v*, *and* Zâîrî*k* <span
id="fr_1237"></span>[2](#fn_1233.md), who are most mighty <span
id="fr_1238"></span>[3](#fn_1234.md).' 10. From such as those the decree
and its original perversity (bûn-gâ*s*tîkŏîh) and scanty
preservativeness are so written *and* prepared, and afterwards, also,
your opinion is that way irritated by the habit of good thinking--of
which there is so much manifest <span id="fr_1239"></span>[4](#fn_1235.md)
from those of the primitive faith and the high-priests--because even its
words and those written with *it, and* the completeness of will *and*
religion which is written, inclined the mind *away* from the teaching of
the high-priests.

11\. But as the same decree, *or* that which is resembling the same
decree <span id="fr_1240"></span>[5](#fn_1236), is appointed (vakhtŏ.md)

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

*and* specially decided, and is not to be accepted *from* him, and the
operation is not to be performed thereby, its position is then to be
considered, *by* those steadfast *in* the practice of the pre-eminent
religion, with the most advanced understanding and discernment, which
are the thought of its true station in the religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers. 12. And other religious decrees, intelligently
preservative of the soul, which are made known *and* declared from the
teaching of truthful high-priests of the religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, are to be suitably accepted *and* fulfilled. 13.
And since this opinion (dâstakŏ) of mine is, moreover, from the writing
of Afarg, even about the preservation of different interpretations and
different teachings, not specially owing to unobtainable statements of
this shattered <span id="fr_1241"></span>[1](#fn_1237.md) religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, nor even *to* distress through simultaneous strife,
but owing to the desire of true opinions which *has* existed, there is
safety abundantly, but temporarily, from the scribbling of the opposing,
partial, and injurious writing of that priestly man <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[2](#fn_1238.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1219"></span>[316:2](sbe18111.htm#fr_1223.md) Reading
vâ*g*-rê*g*i*s*nŏîh; but J omits the first letter, and thereby converts
the word into aparda*z*i*s*nîh, 'want of leisure.'

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[316:3](sbe18111.htm#fr_1224.md) J has merely
'the statements are when deliberation and conjecture become at once
needful.'

<span id="fn_1221"></span>[316:4](sbe18111.htm#fr_1225.md) Reading hanâ
râî, as in J; the other MSS. have hanâ lâ.

<span id="fn_1222"></span>[316:5](sbe18111.htm#fr_1226.md) Or, perhaps,
'strict observations' here, and 'strict observers' further on.

<span id="fn_1223"></span>[317:1](sbe18111.htm#fr_1227.md) To which he is
replying.

<span id="fn_1224"></span>[317:2](sbe18111.htm#fr_1228.md) Reading adîn
gâm, but this is doubtful.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[317:3](sbe18111.htm#fr_1229.md) The Huz. verb
zerîkûntanŏ, 'to sprinkle,' is not found in the glossaries, but is
readily traceable to Chald. ‏ו ?Zְ?Rַ?Q‎.

<span id="fn_1226"></span>[317:4](sbe18111.htm#fr_1230.md) Reading
arashnîkŏ-*k*ŏ-dahi*s*nîh.

<span id="fn_1227"></span>[317:5](sbe18111.htm#fr_1231.md) Meaning his
brother, Zâ*d*-sparam.

<span id="fn_1228"></span>[317:6](sbe18111.htm#fr_1232.md) The usual
Pahlavi phrase for the Av. âsnô khratus or instinctive wisdom (see Dd.
XL, 3).

<span id="fn_1229"></span>[317:7](sbe18111.htm#fr_1233.md) Assuming that
val stands for va*l*.

<span id="fn_1230"></span>[318:1](sbe18111.htm#fr_1234.md) Implying that
the more learning there is manifest in an erroneous teaching, the more
necessary it is to submit it to careful examination.

<span id="fn_1231"></span>[318:2](sbe18111.htm#fr_1235.md) Reading frâ*g*ŏ
va*k* patŏ-yekavîmûnê*d*, and assuming that the last word stands for
patŏ-îstê*d*.

<span id="fn_1232"></span>[319:1](sbe18111.htm#fr_1236.md) That is, such as
have passed away.

<span id="fn_1233"></span>[319:2](sbe18111.htm#fr_1237.md) These are the
last five of the arch-demons who are the special opponents of the
archangels, being corruptions of the Avesta names I*n*dra, Sauru,
N*a*unghaithya, Tauru, and Zairi*k*a (see Bd. I, 27). The name of the
first arch-demon, Akôman, is omitted here, probably by the mistake of
some copyist, as six names are wanted to make up the number of the
archangels exclusive of Aûha*r*ma*zd* himself.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[319:3](sbe18111.htm#fr_1238.md) J continues as
follows:--'"of the demons." 10. Written with the wretchedness (vakhârîh)
and savageness of such as those, the oppressiveness and disaster of a
decree of that description, and its original perversity,' &c. (as in the
text).

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[319:4](sbe18111.htm#fr_1239.md) In the decree,
which was so written as to appear to be directly derived from the
teachings of the commentators, but, at the same time, so warped their
statements as to lead astray. Hence, it might be compared to the
conversion of an archangel into an arch-fiend through a mental
hallucination, as mentioned in § 9.

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[319:5](sbe18111.htm#fr_1240.md) J omits these
last eight words.

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[320:1](sbe18111.htm#fr_1241.md) Reading hanâ
giring, but it can also be read ân adarog, 'that undeceitful.'

<span id="fn_1238"></span>[320:2](sbe18111.htm#fr_1242.md) Zâ*d*-sparam.
