### CHAPTER XLVII.

1\. *As to* the forty-sixth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: At a sacred feast (myazd) <span id="fr_572"></span>[3](#fn_569.md) of
those of the good religion, in which *there* are fifty or a hundred men,
more or less, just as it happens, and seven men who are *engaged* in the
performance of the religious rite (dînô) which is celebrated by them are
feasting together with them, of those seven men there are *some* who are
easily <span id="fr_573"></span>[4](#fn_570.md) able to pray five sections
(vîdak) <span id="fr_574"></span>[5](#fn_571.md), and *some* six
subdivisions (vakhshi*s*nŏ), of the Avesta, *but* no chapter
(fargar*d*ŏ) <span id="fr_575"></span>[6](#fn_572.md) of the commentary
(zand) is

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

easy to them; and all seven of them are disputing about the right (râs)
to the foremost places. 2. And he to whom thirty chapters in <span
id="fr_576"></span>[1](#fn_573.md) the commentary are easy speaks thus:
'The foremost place is mine, and it became my place owing to great
retentiveness *of memory*, for I know the commentary well and "the
proper *and* improper <span id="fr_577"></span>[2](#fn_574.md);" and my
place must be good, for whenever I do not indicate this as the place of
religion unto the people I am not in the security of religion; *but* you
should not dispute about my place, for *it* is not becoming to dispute
*it*, because this neglect and outlandishness (an-aîrîh), which *some
one* brings constantly into the religion, is not *due* to me.' 3. Those
seven men, moreover, speak constantly unto him thus: 'Our place is
*more* important and must ever be *so*, for every man of us is able to
pray several sections in his own officiating priestly duty (zôtîh),
*and* it is ever necessary to consider who is more participating in
sharing a reward.' 4. Then *as to* those whose Avesta is very easy, or
him who knows the commentary *and* 'the proper *and* improper' well, and
*their* goodness and greatness, as asked by us in this chapter, direct
*some one* to make *them* clear unto us, for when he demonstrates the
littleness and greatness in this

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

subject his great religion is then completely an advantage.

5\. The reply is this, that, as to that which you ask *me* to write, so
that they may decide *whether* thirty chapters in the commentary are
easier, *or* really the other, be they five *or* be they six sections of
the Avesta, are easier, *there* is no deciding, because which are the
chapters and which the sections? 6. For, as regards more cleverness and
less cleverness, it is not clear; there are *some* of the sections
greater than many sections, and there are chapters *as* great *as* many
chapters, but to understand severally the divisions (buri*s*) and
enumeration of him to whom five sections of the Avesta are easy, *and*
also of him whose thirty chapters in the commentary are easy, it is
necessary for making the calculation to consider every single division
in the commentary as *equivalent to* seven *equal* divisions apart from
the commentary <span id="fr_578"></span>[1](#fn_575.md). 7. And it is
thereby thus manifest who *has* skill *in the one* and who *has* skill
*in the other* <span id="fr_579"></span>[2](#fn_576.md), and whoever *has*
less, when there is nothing in it regarding which *he* is otherwise
*than* when the superintending command *of* rulers (khtû*d*âyân)
delivered over to him the place of duty--or on account of a new
officiating priestly duty or directorship (ra*d*îh) of the season
festivals <span id="fr_580"></span>[3](#fn_577.md), or the

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

foremost places *being* occupied, or like causes he becomes
otherwise--is fit for all the great share *and* very good estimation of
the place of *one* much more skilful, when their *being* fitting *and*
skilful, or *their* excess *or* deficiency, is not specially manifest
from their skill <span id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_578.md). 8. And him to
whom the commentary is very easy, *having* prayed much, it *has* seemed
important to consider more thriving proportionable to *his* eating <span
id="fr_582"></span>[2](#fn_579.md).

9\. And great and ample respect for both their ways of worthiness is an
advantage *and* fully necessary, skill in the commentary *and* that in
the Avesta *being* together mutually assisting; for even the solemnizers
of the Avesta *have* need for information from the commentary about the
scattered (parvand) 'proper *and* improper' *usages* of the sacred
ceremony. 10. The more efficient information from the commentary is
advantageous when the ceremonial is proceeded with by them, and one of
those two is one of the skilful, *and* a friend, provider, glorifier,
and aggrandizer for the other; and the friends of religion are good
friends and, therefore, also providers of fame for both of them.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

11\. When, too, they are publishing accusing statements, one about the
other, from necessity, or from the violence which is owing to the
adversary <span id="fr_583"></span>[1](#fn_580.md), *it* is important to
become an excuser as regards them, and not a diminisher of their share,
*nor* a bringer (âkhtâr) of unhealthiness to *their* united strength.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_569"></span>[155:3](sbe18054.htm#fr_572.md) The sacred feast
consists of the consecration of the sacred cakes (see Chap. XXX, r),
followed by that of wine and fruit with the recitation of the Âfrîngân
or blessings (see Haug's Essays, p. 408), after which the consecrated
food and drink are consumed by those present, both priests and laymen.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[155:4](sbe18054.htm#fr_573.md) That is, they know
the prayers by heart, which is necessary in reciting the Avesta.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[155:5](sbe18054.htm#fr_574.md) Compare Pers. vaî,
vîd, vîdâ, 'part, little,' *g*uz, 'a portion, a bundle of folios.' M14
has nask, 'book,' but this is clearly an unlucky guess.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[155:6](sbe18054.htm#fr_575.md) The chapters of
the Vendidâ*d* are called fargar*d*s, as are also <span id="page_156">p.
156</span> those of the Vi*s*tâsp Ya*s*t and many of the lost Nasks or
books. The text here applies the term specially to the chapters of some
scripture with commentary, and it may be noted that the thirty;
fargar*d*s, subsequently mentioned, are the exact number contained in
the Vendidâ*d* and Vi*s*tâsp Vast taken together, the learning of which
by heart (as the word 'easy' implies) is a very serious task, comparable
with learning the whole Greek text of the four Gospels.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[156:1](sbe18054.htm#fr_576.md) Perhaps 'with' is
meant, but the word used is pavan.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[156:2](sbe18054.htm#fr_577.md) See Chap. XLIV, 2.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[157:1](sbe18054.htm#fr_578.md) The reason for
this difference is that it is only necessary to learn the words of the
Avesta, without understanding them, whereas a knowledge of the Zand, or
commentary, implies understanding both texts as well as knowing the
Avesta by heart.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[157:2](sbe18054.htm#fr_579.md) M14 omits the
repetition of the words mûn afzâr, but it seems necessary for the
completion of the idiomatic phrase.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[157:3](sbe18054.htm#fr_580.md) The six Gâsânbârs
or Gâhambârs are festivals, each held for five days, and severally
ending on the 45th, 205th, 180th, 210th, 290th, and 365th days of the
Parsi year. They were probably <span id="page_158">p. 158</span>
intended originally to celebrate the periods of midspring, midsummer,
the beginning of autumn, the beginning of winter, midwinter, and the
beginning of spring (see Sls. XVIII, 3), when the Parsi year was fixed
to begin at the vernal equinox. In later times they were supposed to
commemorate the creations of the sky, water, earth, vegetation, animals,
and man.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[158:1](sbe18054.htm#fr_581.md) The meaning, seems
to be that a priest once acknowledged as pre-eminent is not to lose his
right of precedence merely because others become rather better
qualified, so long as he himself does not retrograde, or is not
superseded in his official duties. But if through any accidental
circumstance he be excluded from the chief seat, he ought not to dispute
the matter.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[158:2](sbe18054.htm#fr_582.md) Or, perhaps,
'through being moderate in his eating.'

<span id="fn_580"></span>[159:1](sbe18054.htm#fr_583.md) The evil spirit.
