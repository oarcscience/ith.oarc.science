### CHAPTER XLII.

1\. *As to* the forty-first question and reply, that which you ask is
thus: *As to* him who remains in the good religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, *whom* men shall make the protection and assistance
of the good religion <span id="fr_519"></span>[4](#fn_517.md), *who* shall
save men from a foreign faith and irreligion (akdînôîh), and then holds
back *some* of those who have the idea that they should go over to a
foreign faith and irreligion, *and* they do not go over to the foreign
faith, *but* become steadfast in the religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, what is then <span id="fr_520"></span>[5](#fn_518.md)
the

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

nature of the decision of the angels *about* him, and what is the nature
of their (the men's) good works *and* sin?

2\. The reply is this, that *he* is much extolled, happy, exalted, of
great good works *and* abundant recompense, and the path to the best
existence, prepared (frârâstŏ) by his righteousness, is wide <span
id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_519.md); the delight of *his* soul becomes
complete, *and its* hope <span id="fr_522"></span>[2](#fn_520.md) is great.
3. And every good work that is manifested in the good religion by those
who are transferred by him from a foreign faith and irreligion, and
*which* they shall do thereafter--when, through the perseverance *and*
praise exercised by him who is protected by the religion, they are saved
*from* irreligion--becomes his as much as though it had been set going
by him himself, and *he has* the same praise and the same good works
with them. 4. Of the extent (sâmânŏ) *and* amount of such good works
*there* is no writing a second time, unless *his* acquaintance with the
full computation of the good works due to *their* number is
continuous <span id="fr_523"></span>[3](#fn_521.md); but when *in* the same
way they are practising and steadfast in sin it shall not be assigned
*to him* <span id="fr_524"></span>[4](#fn_522.md). 5. Then his position in

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

righteousness <span id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_523.md) is very grand, and
in the world he has himself great eminence, applause, *and* dignity.

6\. And as much as that which is an improper law *and* a law worthy of
death is a punishing of the soul, and the disconnected <span
id="fr_526"></span>[2](#fn_524) words and perversion (va*s*takîh.md), due
also to the perfidy (rangi*s*nŏ) of the fiend *who has* come, are such
that in his time the religious rites (dînô) performed are rites of
grievous vexation *and* fear, *so* that which is a proper law, like the
great glorification in spirit and the connected words of the
high-priests, is the arrival of the good spirit as much as a virtue
worthy of recompense *and* full of hope. 7. Even as that which is said
thus: 'Of men who are practisers of good deeds the manifestation is then
in their children.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_517"></span>[139:4](sbe18049.htm#fr_519.md) Some one placed in
authority, such as a high-priest or judge, is evidently meant.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[139:5](sbe18049.htm#fr_520.md) Reading êdîna*s*,
'then of him,' instead of ayûf, 'or;' the <span id="page_140">p.
140</span> two words being alike in Pahlavi except in the latter part of
the last letter.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[140:1](sbe18049.htm#fr_521.md) That is, his path
to heaven over the *K*inva*d* bridge is rendered wide and easy by his
good deeds (see Chap. XXI, 5).

<span id="fn_520"></span>[140:2](sbe18049.htm#fr_522.md) Reading aîmê*d*;
M14 has khîm, 'disposition,' and K35 has khimâ*d*, which suggests 'shall
be greatly celebrated' as a possible translation.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[140:3](sbe18049.htm#fr_523.md) The meaning
appears to be that their good works are imputed to him only so long as
he continues to exercise some control over them.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[140:4](sbe18049.htm#fr_524.md) That is, their
sins will not be imputed to him in the same way as their good works.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[141:1](sbe18049.htm#fr_525.md) Or, perhaps,
aharûbŏîh may here mean 'the righteous existence' or heaven.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[141:2](sbe18049.htm#fr_526.md) Reading
apa*d*vand, instead of va pa*d*vand.
