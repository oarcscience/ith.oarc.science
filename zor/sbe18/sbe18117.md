### CHAPTER V.

1\. If this which is said by you be a knowledge that is replete
(a*v*kâr) with advantage, why was it then necessary for you to keep *it*
as *it were* concealed <span id="fr_1338"></span>[2](#fn_1333.md) from me,
when I thus consider that, if a knowledge should be rightly obtained by
you, it should then have been needful for you to report unto me on the
first rumour <span id="fr_1339"></span>[3](#fn_1334.md) from every *one*
who is well-enlightened (hû-bâm)? 2. If this decree

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

seemed so to you before, between when you have been in Pârs and this
*time* when in Sîrkân, *it was* not well considered with those
acquainted with the religion, the wise *and* the high-priests, *and* not
even reported. 3. If not conceived by you before, then what learned
acquaintance with the religion *was* acquired by you in Sarakhs <span
id="fr_1340"></span>[1](#fn_1335.md) *and* Shirâ*z*, about which you are
enlightened? 4. And before it was to be well considered amid observation
*and* meditation <span id="fr_1341"></span>[2](#fn_1336.md) what
high-priest *was* obtained by you in Shirâ*z*, who, when it was well
considered with him, in completely securing himself, kept you *away*
from deliberation to be decided with me *and* other priestly *men* and
high-priests?

5\. If not decided by you in Pârs on account of breaking *away* from me,
that is *as* though you yourself understand that I *am* to keep, *in* my
own person, not even in the rank of discipleship unto you, but in that
which is like servitude; and my coming <span
id="fr_1342"></span>[3](#fn_1337.md), which is on your account, is even an
accumulation of harm *and* distrust (tars) which you *have* amassed for
yourself by *having* written *and* acted, *and* has made *me* suffer
sorrow (vî*d*varînî*d*ŏ) in my own person. 6. If it had been shown to me
by you *that* it would be the preservation of the religion, it would
then have incited me to accept *it* steadfastly. 7. If,

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

for the sake of co-operation with me, a lawful decree had been even more
privately propagated by you, and if the religious demonstration about it
*were* conservative *and* correct, it would then have been less
vexatious for you to explain *it* to me than to others who *have* less
acquaintance with the decrees *and* declaration of revelation; *and* if
a difference had arisen thereon, a correct reply would then have come to
you more fully from me. 8. And if you conceive that it is not necessary
to demonstrate *it* to me through the declaration in revelation, that
deliverance which it is not necessary to announce is not to be so
decreed, even in another place. 9. And, just as even in Pârs, *if it*
were not decreed by you in Sîrkân on that account, when your conception
was that they would not accept *it* from you, it *was* necessary for you
to know that, because it was not possible for you to provide much
interval for demonstration.

10\. If *its* purport *be* now considered by you, when you are moving as
to the writing from Shirâ*z* <span
id="fr_1343"></span>[1](#fn_1338.md)--which writes fully *of* your
acquirement and interpretation of it, and *of* a mutilated
deliverance <span id="fr_1344"></span>[2](#fn_1339.md)--the arrangements
for iniquity on this subject are many. 11. And one of them is the
erroneous writing <span id="fr_1345"></span>[3](#fn_1340.md) which is with
me, for you conceive that they would accept from me your *view*, as *it
were* swearing (sôkandîkŏ) that it does not go to the filth accumulated
for <span id="fr_1346"></span>[4](#fn_1341.md)

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Zaratû*s*t, and
does not contend with him; *and that* the opposition (hamêmalîh) does
not strive *for* a new law, *and* does not increase the evil of the
spirit *and* the world, since it labours *for* the hoard of the soul.

12\. And, persistently concealed, that *was* done by thee, owing to
which is the anguish of my life; for *it* is annoying when a wound of
the soul is not actually realised by means of the decree; but if, too,
it should be really avoidable, *it* is then even said *that* ignorance
itself would be regenerative (navazû*d*ârîhâ), since *it* is not dubious
to me, unless a matured knowledge of creation and some of that even *of*
the angels should be in sight <span id="fr_1347"></span>[1](#fn_1342.md).
13. Also through their much talking, which is like Vîsari*s* <span
id="fr_1348"></span>[2](#fn_1343.md), and much affliction, which is like
the eradication of life, *there* is a perpetual demonstration then *in*
every place of the country of Irân, where this information *about* its
religion shall arrive, *that* they then consider thee as an apostate and
an enemy of the religion.

14\. And through this eager procedure of yours many troops in the
provinces, who *have* to horse (aspînî*d*anŏ) themselves, *have* joined
Âtûrŏ-pâ*d* <span id="fr_1349"></span>[3](#fn_1344.md);

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

for, inasmuch as those most mounted on horses <span
id="fr_1350"></span>[1](#fn_1345.md) are the washers <span
id="fr_1351"></span>[2](#fn_1346.md) *of* Sîrkân, who would have always
thought about their abundance which is due to the archangels, they have
spoken with opponents about this interpretation of the section *of
scripture* (vîdak) <span id="fr_1352"></span>[3](#fn_1347.md), *and* so
become similarly testifying <span id="fr_1353"></span>[4](#fn_1348.md),
thus: 'We do not conceive it is necessary to demand thy reason *for*
this most grievous disaster <span id="fr_1354"></span>[5](#fn_1349.md), a
thing which is more complete through your elucidation of doubt and the
power of the enemy, owing to this way which is appointed by thee.' 15.
And on that account, too, *it* is more disquieting unto me, when I am
aware both of the origin *of* this perplexity *and* the surpassing
contamination which is possible to arise from it.

16\. And you always so observe as not to leap (la aîyyûkhtanŏ) without
looking before; but temporary observation is nothing really of that
*which*, by a well-stinging similitude, is what *one* observes, with the
eyesight looking well forward, *when* dust of many kinds is domesticated
with the sight of the

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

eye; and if his intellect be not judicious he is wonderfully deceived by
it; and *should* it be even when he mentions the existence of two moons,
*has it* become more proved thereby? 17. *It is* a custom of the most
provoking in itself, and presented disquietingly when I, who believe
with a fervent mind, *would have* delivered the life even of *my* body
over to the perplexing bridge <span id="fr_1355"></span>[1](#fn_1350.md)
for your happiness *and* enjoyment. 18. Also, on account of my want of
leisure, even the information which is presented, asking peace, is
information I believe with a generous mind; and *being* aware regarding
my want of leisure is both an advantage and harmful, and the heart to
write of them <span id="fr_1356"></span>[2](#fn_1351.md) is, therefore,
miraculous. 19. Then it is always necessary for me, who *am* in want of
leisure, to write unto you so much writing of the harassing of annoyers
*and* against disputes, of whose end there is no conception in my heart.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1333"></span>[343:2](sbe18117.htm#fr_1338.md) Reading nîhânŏ,
as in J, but K35 and BK omit the first letter.

<span id="fn_1334"></span>[343:3](sbe18117.htm#fr_1339.md) Assuming that
mayâg is a pseudo-Huzvâri*s* equivalent of â*v*âg (Pers. âvâ); mayâ
being the true Huzvâri*s* of â*v*, 'water.'

<span id="fn_1335"></span>[344:1](sbe18117.htm#fr_1340.md) A town in the
extreme north-east of Khurâsân, between Nîshahpûhar and Marv, but nearer
the latter city. When in this town Zâ*d*-sparam probably came in contact
with the Tughazghuz mentioned in Chap. I, 12.

<span id="fn_1336"></span>[344:2](sbe18117.htm#fr_1341.md) J inserts the
words 'by you, and through your good consideration it was more properly
undeceiving, if done, then.'

<span id="fn_1337"></span>[344:3](sbe18117.htm#fr_1342.md) Referring to his
intended visit to Sîrkân, mentioned in Chaps. VI, 4, 6, VII, 3, Ep. I,
xi, 4.

<span id="fn_1338"></span>[345:1](sbe18117.htm#fr_1343.md) Referring
probably to Ep. I, which appears to have been written from Shirâ*z*
after holding as general assembly (see Chap. I, x, Ep. I, iii, 13); but
this epistle, judging from the remark in the text, was probably written
after Mânû*sk*îhar had left Shirâ*z*, as was also Ep. III (see Chap.
VIII, 1).

<span id="fn_1339"></span>[345:2](sbe18117.htm#fr_1344.md) From pollution.

<span id="fn_1340"></span>[345:3](sbe18117.htm#fr_1345.md) See Chap. II, 1.

<span id="fn_1341"></span>[345:4](sbe18117.htm#fr_1346.md) Assuming that
the Pâz. p*g*sâhu stands for pa*z* sâkh-î: but, <span id="page_346">p.
346</span> as Av. *g* and *d* are much alike, it may be p*d*sâhu, which,
when written in Pahlavi letters, can also be read pa*d* gêhan,
'protector of the world;' or p*d*sâhu may be merely a corruption of
pa*d*shâh = pâ*d*akhshah, 'sovereign.'

<span id="fn_1342"></span>[346:1](sbe18117.htm#fr_1347.md) Meaning that he
should have preferred being ignorant of such a decree, unless it
exhibited far more knowledge of the truth than it actually did.

<span id="fn_1343"></span>[346:2](sbe18117.htm#fr_1348.md) So written here
in Pâzand; but, no doubt, the demon Vîzaresha (the Vîzarâsh of Dd.
XXXII, 4, XXXVII, 44), who carries off the souls of the wicked, is
meant.

<span id="fn_1344"></span>[346:3](sbe18117.htm#fr_1349.md) The name,
apparently, of some rival of his in authority, who is also mentioned in
Chap. IX, 11.

<span id="fn_1345"></span>[347:1](sbe18117.htm#fr_1350.md) Reading
asp-vârakântûm, and this meaning tallies well with the previous mention
of troops horsing themselves; but J, by pre-fixing a stroke, changes the
word into vâspôharakântûm, 'those most *renowned* among the spheres.'

<span id="fn_1346"></span>[347:2](sbe18117.htm#fr_1351.md) The ceremonial
washers or priests.

<span id="fn_1347"></span>[347:3](sbe18117.htm#fr_1352.md) The term vîdak
is applied to sections or chapters of the Avesta in Dd. XLVII, 1, 5, 6,
LXVI, 4; and here it must be applied to the Avesta of Vend. VIII or IX,
to which the misinterpretations of. Zâ*d*-sparam specially referred.

<span id="fn_1348"></span>[347:4](sbe18117.htm#fr_1353.md) J has '*and* so
given similar testimony, which is written by them of a priest of your
fame, and written by them to me.'

<span id="fn_1349"></span>[347:5](sbe18117.htm#fr_1354.md) The diminution
of their means of livelihood by the decrease of ceremonial washing, more
than their apprehension of the sinfulness of such decrease.

<span id="fn_1350"></span>[348:1](sbe18117.htm#fr_1355.md) The *K*inva*d*
bridge, or passage to heaven (see Dd. XX, 3); meaning that he would have
been ready to lose his life for the sake of his brother.

<span id="fn_1351"></span>[348:2](sbe18117.htm#fr_1356.md) The heart to
write of the 'happiness and enjoyment' of § 17.
