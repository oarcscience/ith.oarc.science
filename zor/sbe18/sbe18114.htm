<p>1. I <I>have</I> also examined that writing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1280"></A><A HREF="#fn_1276"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in detail, and <I>it</I> is very unprepared for the remarks of the learned and those acquainted with the religion, for the sentences concocted <I>have</I> to be divided, and the slender demonstration is disconnected (aparvand&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;); so I consider that <I>it</I> is not sent to be seen, as regards which such a course <I>would</I>, indeed, <I>be</I> a cause of terror to purifiers. 2. <I>It</I> is so written that, while on account of <I>that</I> same terror they are very much alarmed, and are thorough in maintaining the duty of the continuance of care for water and bull's urine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1281"></A><A HREF="#fn_1277"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and <I>of</I> the formula of the operation, they shall more fully perform <I>it</I> as a duty provided for high-priests; even from that I am more fully of opinion that your like judgment and own concession <I>have</I> produced this explanation.</p>  
<p>3. When I saw in the decree, such as that which you have written, that each time <I>one</I> comes unto a purifier who washes <I>in</I> such manner as is declared</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_332"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 332</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in revelation--which is evident, indeed, from <I>his</I> existence when <I>he</I> is a religious purifier, <I>and</I> also from <I>your</I> priestly lordship's knowledge of the rite; indeed, there is no use of <I>that</I> same decree unless the scripture of revelation, likewise, be so--<I>he</I> is to do <I>it with</I> very strict observation, <I>now</I>, since, owing to the reception of terror by the purifiers, that preparation is evidently to produce, as regards their own disposition and movements, much harm <I>and</I> irregularity, <I>and</I> perplexed thoughts <I>among</I> the people, the discredit of the decreer is generated therefrom, and it would have been more reasonable to consider the terror and doubt of the purifiers in another way.</p>  
<p>4. That which is so explained by you as though it would remain accomplished <I>and</I> would be in notice--and this is written by you like as it were from a teaching of <I>some</I> description--is not proper; because, thus, every rite in the performance of the desired operation, even by one <I>single</I> teaching, is suitable, <I>which</I>, like the preparation for the statements of lying litigants, is very like, <I>but</I> not correct. 5. For when there are <I>some</I> who <I>have</I> furthered M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1282"></A><A HREF="#fn_1278"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> better than the teaching of Afarg&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1283"></A><A HREF="#fn_1278"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>it</I> is well when every single rite in the teaching is right; and <I>as to</I> his rite <I>it</I> is not very clear that deliverance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1284"></A><A HREF="#fn_1279"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is promoted by maintaining <I>it</I>. 6. Even on that <I>occasion</I> when M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h <I>has</I> mentioned threefold washing, <I>and</I> Afarg once washing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1285"></A><A HREF="#fn_1280"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h is the after deponent and Afarg the prior</p>

<p>deponent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1286"></A><A HREF="#fn_1281"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and, on that account, the statement is to be made as long as M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h is preserved, <I>but</I> as regards the opinion of the words of Afarg <I>it</I> is to be maintained in a state of preservation.</p>  
<p>7. <I>As to</I> that which Afarg <I>has</I> said&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1287"></A><A HREF="#fn_1282"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, that 'two purifiers are requisite,' M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h <I>has</I> also said that one is plenty; <I>and</I>, since the teaching of S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1288"></A><A HREF="#fn_1283"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is similar evidence to his, as to that which is said by him, they have thus been more unanimous that when there is one it would be proper; <I>and</I> as several high-priests have announced just the same evidence, <I>and</I> Afarg himself <I>and</I> other priests have been of the same opinion where <I>it</I> is the performance of the beginning of the V&icirc;kaya ('exorcism')&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1289"></A><A HREF="#fn_1284"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h is preserved. 8. Not on this account, that Afarg is more preservative&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1290"></A><A HREF="#fn_1285"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> through once washing, is the operation to be performed according to the teaching of Afarg, but the once washing from Afarg who is the prior deponent, <I>and</I> the one purifier from M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h who is the most corroborated are to be accepted and to be conducted.</p>  
<p>9. And even the computers of the stars would make the position of the stars which exists when that of the sun <I>and</I> moon is from the direction (min z&icirc;k) of <I>S</I>atv&acirc;har&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1291"></A><A HREF="#fn_1286"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, that of Saturn from the direction</p>

<p>of Av&ecirc;nak, and that of Mars from the direction of Pa<I>d</I>ramg&ocirc;s, a position <I>which</I> sends much good, <I>and</I> is said <I>to be</I> capable of undoubtedly (an&acirc;rangak) bringing on maturity of strength. 10. That this is to be seen as an occurrence (<I>g</I>ast&#335;) is a conjunction (nazdak&#335;) which is not possible&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1292"></A><A HREF="#fn_1287"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, because, if the conjunction of Satv&acirc;har&acirc;n <I>be</I> exact, yet, since Saturn <I>and</I> Mars are not at <I>their</I> conjunctions (min nazdak), its effect is not a good configuration (kh&ucirc;p tan&ucirc;); if the conjunction of Av&ecirc;nak <I>be</I> exact, yet, since the sun, moon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1293"></A><A HREF="#fn_1288"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> Mars are not at their conjunctions, its effect is not good; <I>and</I> if the conjunction of Pa<I>d</I>ramg&ocirc;s be exact, yet, since the sun, moon, and Saturn are not&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1294"></A><A HREF="#fn_1289"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> at their conjunctions, the effect is</p>

<p>not good; on account of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1295"></A><A HREF="#fn_1290"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which, in any conjunction which is not exact, they believe <I>it</I> possible <I>for</I> a firm mind also to accomplish this auspicious labour (sukh-var<I>z</I>i<I>s</I>n&#335;), but they say the just and wise should make the decision&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1296"></A><A HREF="#fn_1291"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 11. So that this one is a very good position, because that which is truly issuing (r&acirc;st-ta<I>g</I>) through the conjunction of Satv&acirc;har&acirc;n, is from that mighty Satv&acirc;har&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1297"></A><A HREF="#fn_1292"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> that of Satv&acirc;har&acirc;n <I>being</I> better through the conjunction of Pa<I>d</I>ramg&ocirc;s, that is done&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1298"></A><A HREF="#fn_1293"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

You <I>should</I> understand that of the same kind is the similitude of the three teachings, of which you <I>have</I> written, with this similitude which I <I>have</I> portrayed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1299"></A><A HREF="#fn_1294"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> <I>and</I> ordered to form <I>and</I> scheme, so that you <I>may</I> look at it more clearly, from a proper regard for your own deliverance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1300"></A><A HREF="#fn_1295"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, <I>for</I> the sharp</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1286"></A><A HREF="sbe18114.htm#fr_1291">333:6</A> The high-priest of the Parsis in Bombay is of opinion that the names of the three 'directions' mentioned in this section are the Pahlavi forms of the names of three of the lunar mansions, whose <A NAME="page_334"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 334</FONT></A> P&acirc;zand appellations are given in Bd. II, 3; and he identifies Satv&acirc;har&acirc;n with Kahtsar, Av&ecirc;nak with Avdem, and Pa<I>d</I>ramg&ocirc;<I>s</I> with Pad&ecirc;var. The reading of all these names is, however, very uncertain. <I>S</I>atv&acirc;har&acirc;n is written <I>S</I>at&acirc;har&acirc;n three times out of the five occurrences of the name, and the first syllable might easily be read Gaht = Kaht, so as to correspond with the P&acirc;zand; on the other hand, the reading <I>S</I>at corresponds with <I>S</I>ata-bhisha<I>g</I> or <I>S</I>ata-t&acirc;rak&acirc;, the Sanskrit name of the 25th lunar mansion, Kahtsar. As P&acirc;z. Avdem seems to be merely Pahl. afd&ucirc;m, 'last,' I prefer identifying Av&ecirc;nak (which can also be read Av&ecirc;<I>r</I>ak) with the ninth lunar mansion, Avra (Avrak in Bd. VII, 1, Avrak in Zs. VI, 1), the Sans. &Acirc;<I>s</I>lesh&acirc;. Pa<I>d</I>ramg&ocirc;<I>s</I> is also written Pa<I>d</I>ramg&ocirc;s twice out of the three occurrences of the name; its identification with Pad&ecirc;var makes it the first lunar mansion, the Sans. A<I>s</I>vin&icirc;. The aspect of the heavens, therefore, which is here mentioned as very auspicious, has the sun and new moon in the latter part of Aquarius, Saturn in the first part of Aries, and Mars in the latter part of Cancer, that is, twice as far from Saturn as the latter is from the sun and moon.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1287"></A><A HREF="sbe18114.htm#fr_1292">334:1</A> That is, it very rarely happens; as rarely as the exact agreement of three different commentators, whom these three conjunctions are intended to represent.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1288"></A><A HREF="sbe18114.htm#fr_1293">334:2</A> Reading mit<I>r</I>&ocirc; m&acirc;h, instead of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1291"></A><A HREF="sbe18114.htm#fr_1296">335:2</A> That is, the circumstances are too unpropitious for any one to come to a decision without consulting those who are better qualified to judge, as is also the case when commentators disagree.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1292"></A><A HREF="sbe18114.htm#fr_1297">335:3</A> Reading min zak rab&acirc; <I>S</I>atv&acirc;har&acirc;n, but this is doubtful, because K35 has min rab&acirc; &acirc;har&acirc;n with zak <I>S</I>at written above min rab&acirc;; BK has min zak <I>S</I>at&#335; (or d&acirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) rab&acirc; &acirc;har&acirc;n (or kh&acirc;r&acirc;n), which is merely reading the same characters in a different order; while J omits most of the doubtful phrase, having merely min zak-&icirc;, which, with the alteration of r&acirc;st-ta<I>g</I> into r&acirc;sttar, changes the meaning into the following:--'because that which is through the conjunction of Satv&acirc;har&acirc;n is more correct than that of Satv&acirc;har&acirc;n, <I>and</I> that which is through the conjunction of Pa<I>d</I>ramgo<I>s</I>, that is done.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1295"></A><A HREF="sbe18114.htm#fr_1300">335:6</A> From pollution. There is some temptation to use the word 'salvation' for b&ucirc;<I>g</I>i<I>s</I>n, but this would introduce ideas that were, no doubt, foreign to the author's mind.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1296"></A><A HREF="sbe18114.htm#fr_1301">336:1</A> The ancient law, as contained in the difficult language of the Avesta.</P>
