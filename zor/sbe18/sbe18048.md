### CHAPTER XLI.

1\. *As to* the fortieth question and reply, that which you ask is thus:
Of those whose decision is this, that it is not necessary to be
steadfast in the religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers--by *which*
decision this is asserted, *that* they should abandon the religion of
the Ma*zd*a-worshippers--*some one* disparages the religion *and* goes
over to a foreign faith (an-aîrîh), then of what nature is his sin

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

owing thereto, *and* what does the sin owing thereto, as regards those
of the same foreign religion, amount to? 2. Or order *some one* then to
tell us clearly concerning it, how it is, and how is the disobedience
due to this sin.

3\. The reply is this, that an adult is worthy of death <span
id="fr_506"></span>[1](#fn_504) on account of the good religion
they <span id="fr_507"></span>[2](#fn_505) would abandon, on account
also of the adopted law of the foreign faith *he* is worthy of death, in
whose reliance upon the improper law is also the sin which they <span
id="fr_508"></span>[3](#fn_506) maintain *and* practise by law, and
through *being* in the same law *he* is equally sinful with them. 4. And
also when any one is on that course, and his wish is *for* the same
protection, of which a similitude is *in* the enduring words of that
good law they would forsake, and he adopts that which is vile <span
id="fr_509"></span>[4](#fn_507), even through that impropriety *he* is
equally sinful.

5\. When he dies, without renunciation <span
id="fr_510"></span>[5](#fn_508) *of that sin* and impenitently, in that
improperly-constituted law, the position of his soul is then in the
worst

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

existence <span id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_509), and his punishment is
that of many *sins* worthy of death; from the demons also *there* come
grievously, hand in hand, pain and suffering, gnawing and stench of many
kinds, stinging, tearing, and lacerating, primary evil and discomfort.
6. And through their <span id="fr_512"></span>[2](#fn_510) law and faith
his distress in that worst existence is thus until the last change of
existence, when the renovation *of the universe* is produced by will
among living beings.

7\. But reality (aîtŏîh), as regards living, arises from renunciation of
that disobedience; it makes those attract to the good law who seduced
him to that evil law, that which established him improperly in the law
it eradicates from *his* conduct (rûbâkîh), advancing sins it again
restrains, and whatever *has* advanced it repairs again anew through the
religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers, *and* he becomes thoughtful,
constant, and steadfast. 8. The sin which he set going he restrains and
atones for by wealth, trouble, and authorising <span
id="fr_513"></span>[3](#fn_511) commands; even in the body he also
undergoes punishment in the three *nights* (satûîh) <span
id="fr_514"></span>[4](#fn_512); he then obtains forgiveness, and his
soul is saved.

9\. And as *it* is said in the persistent law of the sacred beings <span
id="fr_515"></span>[5](#fn_513), that 'the good religion of the sacred
beings, who are the Ma*zd*a-worshipping superiors,

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

ordains *it* as retribution,' so that the sin it takes away
(spayêiti) <span id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_514) may not exist in him,
his retribution is declared by revelation. 10. And by the same witness
*it* is said, that all of the primitive faith have been quite of the
same opinion about this, that from the good religion except by <span
id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_515) the way of renunciation *of sin* there
is none unless to hell; but that renunciation *should* be during life,
for it is said that 'whoever *when* living does not become righteous,
that is, does not fully atone for sin, *for* him *when* dead *there* is
no grant of <span id="fr_518"></span>[3](#fn_516) the best existence.'
11. To commit no sin is better than retribution *and* renunciation of
sin.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_504"></span>[137:1](sbe18048.htm#fr_506) That is, he
commits a mortal sin, for which he could have formerly been condemned to
death- by the high-priest (see Sls. VIII, 2, 5-7, 21).

<span id="fn_505"></span>[137:2](sbe18048.htm#fr_507) The teachers of
infidelity.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[137:3](sbe18048.htm#fr_508) The foreigners.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[137:4](sbe18048.htm#fr_509) The probable
meaning is that if he conforms to the foreign faith merely from politic
motives, while retaining a belief in his own religion, he is still
equally sinful.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[137:5](sbe18048.htm#fr_510) This renunciation
is effected by the recitation of a particular formula called the Patit,
in which every imaginable sin is mentioned with a declaration of
repentance of any such sins as the reciter may have committed. But this
formal renunciation must. be accompanied by atonement and true
repentance; and in order to ascertain the proper atonement all serious
sins must be confessed to the high-priest (see Sls. IV, 14, VIII, 1, 2,
8-10).

<span id="fn_509"></span>[138:1](sbe18048.htm#fr_511) See Chap. XXXIII,
3.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[138:2](sbe18048.htm#fr_512) The 'foreigners'.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[138:3](sbe18048.htm#fr_513) Or, tûbânkâr, may
mean 'lavish.' The ordering of religious ceremonies, as good works in
atonement for sin, is probably in-tended; and these always imply a
lavish expenditure upon the priesthood.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[138:4](sbe18048.htm#fr_514) Referring to the
three nights' punishment after the resurrection of the body, which is
specially reserved for mortal sinners (see Bd. XXX, 10).

<span id="fn_513"></span>[138:5](sbe18048.htm#fr_515) Quoting, with some
alteration, from Pahl. Vend. III, 151.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[139:1](sbe18048.htm#fr_516) The Avesta verb
spayêiti, here used as a technical term, occurs frequently in Vend. III,
142.-148.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[139:2](sbe18048.htm#fr_517) Assuming that
ba*r*â, 'indeed,' stands for pavan, 'by,' (see Chap. VII, 2 n.)

<span id="fn_516"></span>[139:3](sbe18048.htm#fr_518) Reading
bakhshi*s*n-î, but it may be a corruption of bakhshând,' they shall
grant,' as assumed in M14. This passage is quoted from Pahl. Vend. V,
173.
