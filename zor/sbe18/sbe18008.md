### OBSERVATIONS.

1\. For all divisions into chapters and sections the translator is
responsible, as the manuscripts merely indicate the beginning of each
question and reply.

2\. Italics are used for any English words which are not expressed, or
fully understood, in the original text, but are added to complete the
sense of the translation.

3\. Italics occurring in Oriental words, or names, represent certain
peculiar Oriental letters (see the 'Transliteration of Oriental
Alphabets' at the end of this volume). The italic *d*, *l*, *n*, *r*,
*v* may be pronounced as in English; but *g* should be sounded like j,
*hv* by like wh, *k* like ch in 'church,' *s* like sh, and *z* like
French j.

4\. In Pahlavi words the only vowels expressed in the original text are
those circumflexed, initial a, and the letter ŏ; italic *d* is written
like t, *r* and *l* like n or the Avesta o, *v* and *z* like *g*, and
*zd* like â in the Pahlavi character (see the latter part of § 1 of the
Introduction).

5\. In the translation, words in parentheses are merely explanatory of
those which precede them.

6\. For the meaning of the abbreviations used in the notes, see the end
of the Introduction.

7\. The manuscripts mentioned are:--

BK, an old imperfect copy of K35 written in Kirmân, but now in Bombay.

J (about 60 years old), belonging to Dastûr Jâmâspji Minochiharji in
Bombay.

K35 (probably written A.D. 1572), No. 35 in the University Library at
Kopenhagen; upon the text of which this translation is based.

Bombay), No. 14 in the same Collection.
