### CHAPTER XIV.

1\. The thirteenth question is that which you ask thus: 'Who should
prepare the account of the soul as to sin and good works, and in what
place should they make it up? *And* when punishment is inflicted by
them, where is their place then?

2\. The reply is this, that the account about the doers of actions, as
to good works *and* sin, three times every day whilst the doer of the
actions is living, Vohûman the archangel should prepare; because taking
account of the thoughts, words, and deeds of all material existences is
among his duties. 3. And about the sin which *affects* accusers <span
id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_87.md), which

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

is committed by (va*l*) breakers of promises, even in the world
Mit*r*ô <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_88.md) is said *to be* over the
bodies, words, and fortunes (hû-bakhtakŏ) of the promise-breakers; *and*
as to the amount, and also as to *being* more than the stipulation when
*there is* a period of time <span id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_89.md), Mit*r*ô
is the account-keeper. 4. In the three *nights' account* (satûîh) Srôsh
the righteous *and* Rashnû the just <span id="fr_91"></span>[3](#fn_90.md)
are over the estimate of the limits of the good works *and* sin of
righteousness and wickedness. 5. In the future existence, on the
completion of every account, the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* himself takes
account <span id="fr_92"></span>[4](#fn_91.md), by whom both the former
account of the three *nights* and all the thoughts, words, and deeds of
the creatures are known through his omniscient wisdom.

6\. The punishment for a soul of the sinners comes from that
spirit <span id="fr_93"></span>[5](#fn_92.md) with *whom* the sin, which
was committed by it, is connected; fostered by the iniquity practised,
that punishment comes upon the souls of the sinful and wicked, first on
earth, afterwards in hell, *and* lastly at the organisation of the

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

future existence <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](sbe18023.htm#fn_93.md). 7.
When the punishment of the three *nights* is undergone <span
id="fr_95"></span>[2](sbe18023.htm#fn_94.md) the soul of the righteous
attains to heaven *and* the best existence, *and* the soul of the wicked
to hell and the worst existence. 8. When they have undergone their
punishment at the renovation *of the universe* they attain, by complete
purification from every sin, unto the everlasting progress, happy
progress, *and* perfect progress of the best *and* undisturbed
existence.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_87"></span>[32:1](sbe18022.htm#fr_88.md) Sins are divided into
two classes, hamêmâlân or those which affect 'accusers,' and rûbânîk or
those which affect only one's own soul. In the first class are included
all evil actions which injure our fellow-creatures or any good animal or
thing, and for which the injured party (the 'accuser') must receive
satisfaction before the sinner can be pardoned (see Sls. VIII, I).

<span id="fn_88"></span>[33:1](sbe18022.htm#fr_89.md) The angel of the
sun's light; he is a personification of friendship and good faith, and
is, therefore, specially aggrieved by breaches of promise and fraudulent
debtors, but assists righteous souls in their passage to the other world
(see AV. V, 3, Mkh. II, 118).

<span id="fn_89"></span>[33:2](sbe18022.htm#fr_90.md) Referring to debts
and promises to pay.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[33:3](sbe18022.htm#fr_91.md) The angels of
obedience and justice; the duty of the former is to protect the
righteous, and that of the latter is to weigh the good works and sins in
his golden scales, when the soul's account is balanced after the third
night after death (see AV. V, 2-5, Mkh. II, 115-122).

<span id="fn_91"></span>[33:4](sbe18022.htm#fr_92.md) Referring, perhaps,
to the future temporary separation of the wicked from the righteous,
after the assembly of the Sa*d*vâstarân (see Bd. XXX, 10-16).

<span id="fn_92"></span>[33:5](sbe18022.htm#fr_93.md) The demon who is
supposed to have occasioned the sin.
