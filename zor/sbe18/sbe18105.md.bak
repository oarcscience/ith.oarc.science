### CHAPTER IV.

1\. I *have* also seen the spiritual life <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[3](#fn_1115.md) in the writing which is in such
statements of incompleteness <span id="fr_1120"></span>[4](#fn_1116.md),
*and* owing to the same reason they should not cease from the
operation <span id="fr_1121"></span>[5](#fn_1117.md) of washing you--whom
may the angels protect!--with the Bareshnûm *ceremony* <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[6](#fn_1118.md). 2. Because the ancients have said
that, when it shall be discarded from use, every water, fire, plant,
righteous man, *and* animal, and all the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd* are
afflicted, diminished, and made to leap *away*. 3. As it is said in
revelation that, *as to* him *who* stands *by* a dead body upon which
the Nasû*s* <span id="fr_1123"></span>[7](#fn_1119.md) *has* rushed <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[8](#fn_1120.md), 'anusô zî, Spitama Zarathu*s*tra!

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

aêsha yâ <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1](#fn_1121.md) paiti-irista
ava*d* <span id="fr_1126"></span>[2](#fn_1122.md) hvare â-tâpayêiti <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[3](#fn_1123.md), anusô hâu m*a*u, anusô avê
stârô <span id="fr_1128"></span>[4](#fn_1124.md)--discontentedly, moreover,
O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân! does the sun shine upon him who *has been* by
the dead, so discontentedly \[does the moon\] <span
id="fr_1129"></span>[5](#fn_1125.md), thus discontentedly do the
stars--khshnâvayêiti zî, Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! aêshô nâ yô
yao*z*dâthryô, ya*d* aêtem <span id="fr_1130"></span>[6](#fn_1126.md)
paiti-iristem frâ-nasûm kerenaoiti--the man who is purifying propitiates
*them*, O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân! when *he operates on* him *who has
been* by the dead, *on* whom the Nasû*s* is put forth, *and* he has
become *parted* from the sacred twigs <span
id="fr_1131"></span>[7](#fn_1127.md)--he propitiates fire, he propitiates

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

water, he propitiates animals *and* plants <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1](#fn_1128.md), he propitiates the righteous
man <span id="fr_1133"></span>[2](#fn_1129.md), he propitiates the
righteous woman, both *of them*,' as *in* the Avesta <span
id="fr_1134"></span>[3](#fn_1130.md) of it:---khshnâvayêiti âtarem, &c.

4\. When *there* is no purifier all the angels of the worldly
*existence* become afflicted *and* dissatisfied; and religious purifiers
who are intelligent are even now not to keep backward the work of
purification, just as *it has* come to them by practice from those of
the primitive faith, and are not to diminish it. 5. To change a good
work properly appointed they shall not accept a law which is not right,
a good work not properly appointed <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[4](#fn_1131.md); not to do the work thereof is
accounted very sagacious *and* perfectly wise; and through your freedom
from inferiority <span id="fr_1136"></span>[5](#fn_1132.md) the glorifying,
commendation, praise, and blessing are your own. 6. For it is said that
in all the work of forming and maintaining the law (dâ*d*istânŏ) those
of the primitive faith *were* very greatly particular about every single
thing; and *as to* the whole operation of that proceeding into which
they *have* entered, those of the primitive faith have become aware of
the power which *resides* in true authority. 7. But, otherwise <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[6](#fn_1133.md), the routine which is brought out

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

from revelation <span id="fr_1138"></span>[1](#fn_1134.md) and the teaching
of the high-priests is then not authorisedly changed by that priestly
man whose decree of the fifteen <span id="fr_1139"></span>[2](#fn_1135.md)
*washings* is written in *your* epistle <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[3](#fn_1136.md); because, on account of the whole and
any perversion (ga*s*takîh) of the same writing, not of similar
utterance with revelation, before which the custom did not exist, I am
without doubt as to that decree.

8\. And in it <span id="fr_1141"></span>[4](#fn_1137.md), moreover, is
written, declared, *and* contained (van*g*î*d*ŏ) that once *washing* is
mentioned <span id="fr_1142"></span>[5](#fn_1138.md), until a purifier
comes who is acquainted with the ritual, who washes just as declared in
revelation. 9. *To be* so washed I consider just as a thing for which he
is even now as *it were* a purifier who is a good washer <span
id="fr_1143"></span>[6](#fn_1139.md), that of which *it* is written below
*and* clearly realised that it should not be decreed; *and* through the
scanty deliverance written therein <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[7](#fn_1140.md) *it* is manifest it would not be the
statement above <span id="fr_1145"></span>[8](#fn_1141.md).

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

10\. If learned knowledge, *relating* both to that about inferior
matters (a*g*îrtarîhâ) and that about superior matters, *be* <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1](#fn_1142.md) true authority praised *and* declared
by the great primitive faith, former high-priests *and* those newly
arisen (navakgandakânŏ) would be *and* would have been similarly
forward; then, too, it would exist not so much with the priestly men
*of* the time *as with* the learned officiating priests (magôpatân) of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* *who* have been before. 11. And when, moreover, all the
Avesta and Zand are easy *to* a priest <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[2](#fn_1143.md), pre-eminently acquainted with the
liturgy *and* a supreme Zaratû*s*t, *he has* attained *unto, and* should
remain with, Aûha*r*ma*zd* and <span id="fr_1148"></span>[3](#fn_1144.md)
the officiating priestship of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and the supreme,
world-managing, religion-observing (hû-dîn nikah) sovereignty as to
*religious* treatises <span id="fr_1149"></span>[4](#fn_1145.md). 12. To
change then their practice in the law would be entirely an outcry apart
from deliberation, and a like violation of the unanimity of the spirits
who are the heads *and* guardians <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[5](#fn_1146.md) of the religion, *and of* the
unanimity of the source of opinion of the good themselves, for the sake
of *what is* not acceptable.

13\. But the statement above <span id="fr_1151"></span>[6](#fn_1147.md) is,
was, *and will* be that which remains a good idea well considered by
them with the centre of thought, as to *its* well-operating

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

characteristics, just contention, and complete powerfulness. 14. Also
from the teaching of just high-priests, through the preservation of much
evidence, and ascertained for the members of the assemblies of various
provinces (shat*r*ô shat*r*ô), are shown the opinion *and* experience of
most priestly men; and to make the various districts (kûstakŏ kûstakŏ)
thrivingly steadfast, an unperverted *one* should be set up in all four
quarters (pâ*d*kôs) of the same province.

15\. And a semblance of it is apparent even from that which the
glorified Nîshahpûhar, the supreme officiating priest <span
id="fr_1152"></span>[1](#fn_1148.md), and also other officiating priests of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* *have* said, *that one is* not to change any teaching of
theirs thereon after *it is* provided, *and* not to render useless the
statements of other authority thereon. 16. But that which they should
accept *from* them as a certainty is to maintain the statements of other
high-priests as pre-eminent; *and* not to change the operation of
statements of another description *has* appeared lawful. 17. Even so it
was as that *same* Nîshahpûhar, in the council of the glorified
(anôshakŏ rûbânô) Khûsrô <span id="fr_1153"></span>[2](#fn_1149.md), king
of

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

kings *and* son of Kavâ*d*,--by preserving old things (ligânŏ)--showed
that way on whose thoughts they are established, and wrote them
unaltered, so that such thoughts thereon became as *it were* decided;
and their thoughts thereon, after such decree of his, have so become
unanimous. 18. Through the importance *of his* assured rank, and the
rest which was said by him in the work of sustaining the faithful, he
maintains as much as the other statements, one *by* one, from the
deliberative teaching of those high-priests.

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[292:1](sbe18104.htm#fr_1117.md) J has
bûr*z*îdakŏ, 'extolled,' instead of var*z*îdakŏ, 'practised.'

ahvôîh; but it can also be read stihânŏîh, in which case the translation
would be:--'And my worldly condition.'

<span id="fn_1116"></span>[292:4](sbe18105.htm#fr_1120.md) Meaning the
incomplete kind of purification which their statements complained of, or
his referred to.

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[292:5](sbe18105.htm#fr_1121.md) K35 and BK omit
the *r* in ka*rd*akŏ.

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[292:6](sbe18105.htm#fr_1122.md) See App. IV.

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[292:7](sbe18105.htm#fr_1123.md) The fiend of
corruption (see Dd. XVII, 7).

<span id="fn_1120"></span>[292:8](sbe18105.htm#fr_1124.md) The three Avesta
passages here quoted, with their 'Land (Pahlavi translation), are from
Vend. IX, 161-163, and are freely translated (trans. D) thus:---'It
grieves the sun, indeed, O Spitama <span id="page_293">p. 293</span>
Zarathu*s*tra! to shine upon a man defiled by the dead; it grieves the
moon, it grieves the stars. That man delights them, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! who cleanses from the Nasu those whom she has defiled; he
delights the fire, he delights the water, he delights the earth, he
delights the cow, he delights the trees, he delights the faithful, both
men and women.' The Avesta text is given according to the standard
edition of Westergaard (IX, 41, 42), and all variants of any importance,
in the three MSS. here used, are mentioned in the notes. These passages
are also referred to in Ep. II, iii, 5.

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[293:1](sbe18105.htm#fr_1125.md) K35 and BK
insert the last three words, anusô âvâ stârô, here.

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[293:2](sbe18105.htm#fr_1126.md) J inserts yâ
here.

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[293:3](sbe18105.htm#fr_1127.md) J has
â-tâpayaêta, but K35 and BK omit the word.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[293:4](sbe18105.htm#fr_1128.md) K35 and BK have
khshathrô-chinanghô, 'of a desire of authority' (which occurs in
Fravar*d*în Yt. 112 as the name of a man) instead of avê stârô, which
they have inserted earlier. They also leave a blank space for the words
maman akhû*r*sandîhâ, 'moreover, discontentedly' (which begin the
Pahlavi translation), as if they were descended from a damaged original.

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[293:5](sbe18105.htm#fr_1129.md) B All three MSS.
omit the words in brackets, which are necessary to complete the Pahlavi
version.

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[293:6](sbe18105.htm#fr_1130.md) K35 and BK omit
aêtem.

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[293:7](sbe18105.htm#fr_1131.md) J has 'who has
become polluted,' which separation from the sacred twigs (see Dd. XLIII,
5), or other ceremonial apparatus, implies. The phrase is omitted in
Pahl. Vend. IX, 162.

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[294:1](sbe18105.htm#fr_1132.md) J has 'he
propitiates plants,' as in Pahl. Vend. IX, I63.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[294:2](sbe18105.htm#fr_1133.md) Literally
'male.'

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[294:3](sbe18105.htm#fr_1134.md) The initial
words of which here follow their Pahlavi translation, instead of
preceding it.

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[294:4](sbe18105.htm#fr_1135.md) J omits these
six words.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[294:5](sbe18105.htm#fr_1136.md) Reading
afrôtarîh, as in BK; K35 had originally a*v*artarîh, 'pre-eminence,' as
in J, but the copyist wrote afrô (= aparva) over the a*v*arta, as a
correction, leaving it doubtful whether he meant afrôtarîh or aparvarîh,
'want of education.'

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[294:6](sbe18105.htm#fr_1137.md) That is, unless
confirmed by the decisions of the ancients.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[295:1](sbe18105.htm#fr_1138.md) J has 'which is
brought out with knowledge of the *purifying* cup (tâ*s*tîk), with
preservation of faith, and with manifestation from revelation.'

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[295:2](sbe18105.htm#fr_1139.md) All three MSS.
have 'sixteen' in ciphers, but it is evident that Zâ*d*-sparam and his
erroneous teaching of the sufficiency of fifteen washings (see Ep. III,
1, 2) are here referred to.

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[295:3](sbe18105.htm#fr_1140.md) Reading *s*emag,
a Huz. hybrid for nâmak.

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[295:4](sbe18105.htm#fr_1141.md) The decree of
Zâ*d*-sparam, apparently.

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[295:5](sbe18105.htm#fr_1142.md) Referring
probably to Vend. VIII, 299, which provides a washing for the pointed
person by himself, if he can find no one willing to purify him (see App.
V).

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[295:6](sbe18105.htm#fr_1143.md) That is, for
such a purpose any ordinary washer would be sufficient.

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[295:7](sbe18105.htm#fr_1144.md) In Pahl Vend.
VIII, 299, which states that, although pure enough for ordinary
purposes, he must still abstain from engaging in ceremonies for others
(see App. V).

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[295:8](sbe18105.htm#fr_1145.md) That is, it is
very different from the propitiation mentioned in § 3.

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[296:1](sbe18105.htm#fr_1146.md) J has 'because
if even for that about superior matters, acquaintance with religion, and
learned knowledge there be,' &c.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[296:2](sbe18105.htm#fr_1147.md) That is, when he
knows all the scriptures and commentaries by heart.

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[296:3](sbe18105.htm#fr_1148.md) J omits
'Aûha*r*ma*zd* and.'

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[296:4](sbe18105.htm#fr_1149.md) That is, he has
full authority to interpret the scriptures.

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[296:5](sbe18105.htm#fr_1150.md) Reading saran
sa*r*dârân, but in K35 the two words overlap, so that sar-sa*r*dârân,
'head guardians,' might be intended.

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[296:6](sbe18105.htm#fr_1151.md) Probably
referring to the quotation from the Vendidâ*d* in § 3.

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[297:1](sbe18105.htm#fr_1152.md) This môbad of
môbads is mentioned in Pahl. Vend. III, 151, V, 112, VI, 71, VIII, 64,
XVI, 10, 17, AV. I, 35, and twenty-four times in the Nîrangistân (see
Sls. I, 4 n). His name is spelt in various ways.

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[297:2](sbe18105.htm#fr_1153.md) King Khûsrô, son
of Kavâ*d*, who is best known by his title Nôshirvân, or Anôshirvân,
'immortal-soulled,' reigned A.D. 531-579; and the statement that
Nîshahpûhar was one of his councillors (made little more than three
centuries after his death, and, therefore, probably correct) is of
considerable importance for fixing a limit to the age of those Pahlavi
books in which he is mentioned. These books are the Pahlavi Nîrangistân,
a late recension of the Pahlavi Vendidâ*d*, and the Book of
Ar*d*â-Vîrâf, in which last it is <span id="page_298">p. 298</span>
stated that Vîrâf was called by the name of Nikhshâpûr by some. From the
statements made in our text it seems probable that the council was
employed in revising the Pahlavi Vendidâ*d*, in which they were careful
not to erase the opinions of older commentators, and thus confirmed
their statements by their own authority. It is possible that this
council was that mentioned in Byt. I, 7, where the name Nishâpûr also
occurs, but whether it refers to a man or a city is not quite certain.
This council, which seems to have been summoned for condemning the
heresy of Mazdak, was held probably two or three years before Khûsrô
came to the throne (see Nŏldeke: Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur
Zeit der Sasaniden, p. 465).
