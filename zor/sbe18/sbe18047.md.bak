### CHAPTER XL.

1\. *As to* the thirty-ninth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: What kind of goodness and want of goodness can there be *in* the
*sacred thread*-girdle and shirt; *and* what are the sin of running
about uncovered, of prayer offered and prayer not offered, and the
purpose of cleansing (mî*s*n)?

2\. The reply is this, that it (the shirt) <span
id="fr_494"></span>[1](#fn_492.md) is needful *to be* perfectly pure white
*and* single, which one fold is because Vohûman also is thus the one
creature who *was* first <span id="fr_495"></span>[2](#fn_493.md), and
afterwards from him the garment which is innermost and concealed is
called in revelation <span id="fr_496"></span>[3](#fn_494.md).

3\. Proper girdling is double <span id="fr_497"></span>[4](#fn_495.md),
which two folds are because he also who is in the course of the twofold
religious wisdom is intelligent, and the duties *due to* the sacred
beings are themselves *in* two divisions

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

which are called the instinctive *and that* heard by the ears <span
id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_496.md).

4\. After a man is in the girding they shall tie on, the symptoms of
*any* sins of the belted body are *free* from sin which is condemned
(vi*g*îrînîdŏ); and when he walks uncovered, or naked, or with a
two-fold garment, there is then no root of *the sin of* running about
uncovered <span id="fr_499"></span>[2](#fn_497.md) in him. 5. Moreover, on
hymns *being* chanted during a meal an *inward* prayer is not also
necessary <span id="fr_500"></span>[3](#fn_498.md).

6\. The purpose <span id="fr_501"></span>[4](#fn_499.md) of a cleansing
(mî*s*n-aê) is this, that the suitableness of men for eating is due to
worship of the sacred beings and glorification of the sacred beings. 7.
And *as to* their necessary recommendation (sipârîh) <span
id="fr_502"></span>[5](#fn_500.md) of any food for eating, the

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

glorifying of the sacred beings, and the true usages about recounting
*it*, it is commanded, before eating, when the mouth is not soiled with
food, *that* the mouth (dahân) *should* proceed with the utterance of
the pure glorification <span id="fr_503"></span>[1](#fn_501.md). 8. Being
thereupon suitably seated, and *having* properly eaten the food, *one*
is to make the mouth clean with a tooth-pick and water; and after
eating, before all words, the praise of the sacred beings is glorified
by the mouth cleansed by washing. 9. And between the glorifying before
eating and the after glorification *one* is not <span
id="fr_504"></span>[2](#fn_502.md) to speak other words, and when during a
meal a word is spoken by the mouth, that kind of glorification which
*it* is the custom to utter before and after eating is offered by its
own organ (andâm) <span id="fr_505"></span>[3](#fn_503.md).

To. And every single organ *has* one function, *but* two special
functions are. connected with the mouth, which are speaking *and*
eating; *and* because *they are* together *they* are mutually opposed,
for speaking connects that which is an inward possession with outside
teachings (*k*âshîhâ), *and* through eating, the outside food comes for
the inward further vitality of life. 11. As the ancients *have* said,
where one operation is appointed unto two operators, *it is* more

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

expressly so that during eating two operations may not both at once
(ayag-i*k*-gûn) be produced, by speaking *and* by eating.

12\. To keep those two operations distinct, one from the other, the
custom of uttering the praise of sacred beings *and* the glorification
of sacred beings when the mouth remains in the act of eating, until the
mouth becomes clean from food, is decreed as inconsistent with goodness
(aham-vêhîh). 13. And that *which* remains from the outpouring (rîkh) at
the time of a cleansing is called 'a cleansing (nîsn-aê).'

14\. One means for the retention of knowledge is through not having that
retention of knowledge exhausted, but when *one* thus speaks during that
cleansing the words are really originating with the mouth, for he does
not retain *them*; and whenever (maman) he does not speak anything
whatever with the tongue, that religious glorification which *it* is the
custom to utter before and after eating is then offered by him from his
own limited resources (sâmânŏ-î vîmônd), and it will be offered from his
own limited resources.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_492"></span>[133:1](sbe18047.htm#fr_494.md) The sacred shirt,
constantly worn by Parsis of both sexes (young children excepted), is a
very loose tunic of white muslin, with very short loose sleeves covering
part of the upper arm (see Sls. IV, 4-8).

<span id="fn_493"></span>[133:2](sbe18047.htm#fr_495.md) The archangel
Vohûman (see Chap. III, 13) is said to have been the first creation of
the creator (see Bd. I, 23).

<span id="fn_494"></span>[133:3](sbe18047.htm#fr_496.md) The garment of
Vohûman (see Chap. XXXIX, 19).

<span id="fn_495"></span>[133:4](sbe18047.htm#fr_497.md) That is, it is
passed twice round the waist before it is tied the first time, but then
it is passed a third time round the waist (see Chap. XXXIX, I).

<span id="fn_496"></span>[134:1](sbe18047.htm#fr_498.md) The twofold wisdom
of the Avesta comprises the two intellects, the âsnô khratu*s*, 'the
durable or instinctive wisdom,', and the gaoshô-srûtô khratu*s*, 'the
ear-heard or acquired wisdom,' which are the terms used here.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[134:2](sbe18047.htm#fr_499.md) The sin of
vishâ*d*-dûbâri*s*nîh, which would have been incurred in any of these
cases if no girdle had been worn, is a venial sin of one Farmân for each
of the three first steps, but becomes a Tanâpûhar sin (equivalent to 75
or 400 Farmâns) at the fourth step (see Sls. IV, 8-10).

<span id="fn_498"></span>[134:3](sbe18047.htm#fr_500.md) This is mentioned
as a further illustration of a greater religious duty superseding a
lesser one. When the Gâthas, or hymns, are being chanted, the reciter is
already under the protection of the inward prayer (vâ*g*) with which all
acts of worship must commence; it is, therefore, unnecessary to take
another prayer inwardly before eating. Inward prayer is a short formula
which is said to be 'taken' and 'retained' inwardly, as a protective
spell, by muttering its commencement before certain necessary acts, and
after the completion of the act the remainder of the formula is 'spoken
out' aloud, and the spell is dissipated, before the person can converse
(see Sls. III, 6).

<span id="fn_499"></span>[134:4](sbe18047.htm#fr_501.md) The MSS. have pêm,
'milk,' instead of *k*îm, 'purpose,' but see § 1; the Pahl. letters p
and *k* are often much alike.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[134:5](sbe18047.htm#fr_502.md) M14 has sipâsîh,
'praise;' but this and several other emendations <span id="page_135">p.
135</span> in the same MS. are probably nothing but unsuccessful
attempts to render an obscure text intelligible, without taking the
trouble to understand it.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[135:1](sbe18047.htm#fr_503.md) This glorification
(stâyi*s*nŏ) must refer to the inward prayer of § 5, which commences by
praising Aûha*r*ma*zd* (see Chap. LXXIX, 2, note).

<span id="fn_502"></span>[135:2](sbe18047.htm#fr_504.md) Reading lâ, 'not,'
instead of râî, 'on account of.' M14 has altered the passage.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[135:3](sbe18047.htm#fr_505.md) That is, when the
spell of the inward prayer is broken by speaking before the proper time
(see § 5, note), the spell must be renewed before proceeding with the
meal.
