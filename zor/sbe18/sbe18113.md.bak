# EPISTLE II.

#### TO HIS BROTHER, ZÂ*D*-SPARAM.

Copy of an epistle of the priest Mânû*sk*îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, which
*was* prepared by him for the priest, *his* brother, Zâ*d*-sparam <span
id="fr_1259"></span>[1](#fn_1255.md).

### CHAPTER I.

1\. *In* the name of the sacred beings who shall keep exalted the
pre-eminent success of *your* priestly lordship, accomplishing *your*
wishes in both worlds, I am longing for the children--formerly promoting
health of body--and *for* activity, and fully desirous, and in every
mode a thanksgiver unto the sacred beings, for the well-abiding
*eye*sight, peace, *and* understanding of *your* priestly lordship.

2\. The epistle that came *from* you in the month Â*v*ân <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[2](#fn_1256.md), which Nîvshahpûhar <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[3](#fn_1257.md) *was* ordered to write,

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

and . . . by me from <span id="fr_1262"></span>[1](#fn_1258.md) . . . . and
would . . . . , have been quite desirable to increase *my* gratitude
unto the sacred beings *for* the health and salutation of *your*
priestly lordship, though it had been *merely* to write intelligence of
your own condition; for your writing of the epistle is not such as *that
of* the distant who write in duplicate, but like *that of* neighbours
who think that everything new should always be really mutual
information. 3. *As to* that, too, which you ordered to write about
omens *and* such occurrences--for which my form of words is not as is
twice specified within the epistle, and from henceforth *one* should
order to write intelligence more clearly-moreover, on account of want of
leisure on many subjects, my heart is not disengaged even for the
understanding of omens.

4\. I apprize *your* priestly lordship that in this

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

interval (tâhîkŏ) <span id="fr_1263"></span>[1](#fn_1259.md) a written
*statement has* come unto me that the good *people* of Sîrkân are,
indeed, so enveloped by you *in* distress, despondency, and trouble that
its counterpart *was* when *there was* a liberation of *our* glorified
fathers from the state of material existence. 5. For such as the
insufficiency of the whole life of such *was* then to me, so even is the
wounding and damage which comes *now* to *my* understanding and
intellect. 6. The whole life of such is on the confines of the pure
existence, a contest *with* the complete incorrectness that remains
contaminating the liturgy by which the greatest intelligence of the
religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers is aided; a little also, finally, of
sagacity and observance of the apportionment of the more grievous
impostures and more frightful delusions.

7\. And, first of all, as to when your completely vile idea first
destroyed your own enlightenment, and quite subdued your seconding of
me, is inopportune (avidanâ) for me; and that ordinance <span
id="fr_1264"></span>[2](#fn_1260.md), which though it be also right, is
then even grandeur, because *it* is a law of the realm and an opinion of
the world. 8. When even in the mansion of various thoughts, the
residence of the assembly of Pârs, *and* many other conventions to
deliberate, and the united opinions of a thousand priestly *men*
(magavôg) of the good religion thereon, it could remain unaltered, then,
also, the various good thoughts *and* opposing considerations that,
*along* with me, the

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

minds of other heads of the religion *have* promoted, *and* shaped *or*
altered decisions thereon, *and* settled and issued orders thereon,
could not have seen a grievance (se*g*) *therein*. 9. And this, too,
should be observed among your requirements <span
id="fr_1265"></span>[1](#fn_1261.md), that when the fattiness <span
id="fr_1266"></span>[2](#fn_1262) of the body is in wrinkles (*k*în.md), so
that four perfect *ones* of the period are provided, even then the
opinion of a high-priest of the religion is greater than every opinion,
*but* the law of the realm of *various* kinds <span
id="fr_1267"></span>[3](#fn_1263.md) is only through the deliberation of
the same perfect *ones*; to make him decide then is not proper <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[4](#fn_1264.md).

10\. And it would be desirable for you to take account of that which is
said thus: 'Thou shouldst not practise that, O Zaratû*s*t! when thou and
three or four companions, in the village of a thanksgiver of the
assembly, shall say this: "Such is an evil notion."' 11. These words of
his are then not taken into account by you; and *it* is *firmly* and
*with* acute observation determined by you, and thought preservative for
yourself, that even the sin be not privately (andarg) declared by me
unto the assembly which *has* deliberated at Shirâ*z* <span
id="fr_1269"></span>[5](#fn_1265.md). 12. You order this, and

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

*it* is known that if it were a statement of yours in the assembly of
the Tughazghuz <span id="fr_1270"></span>[1](#fn_1266.md), *you* would have
been still less a speaker in private.

13\. I consider that you are as much under-*hand* (aîr) about this, as
regards yourself, as Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_1271"></span>[2](#fn_1267.md)
the club-footed (apafrôbd) when he arranged his garments (vakhshakîhâ),
and his club-foot is itself overspread thereby even to himself, so that
*he was* then approved *as* good <span id="fr_1272"></span>[3](#fn_1268.md)
by *some* of those of Kirmân <span id="fr_1273"></span>[4](#fn_1269.md)
when they heard *of it*, and those of Râî <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[5](#fn_1270) (Râ*z*îkânŏ.md) wrote a reply that, if
*he* should be appointed by you also at a distance, *he* would then be
approved by them likewise *as* good. 14. This idea of yours is more
heinous than that act of his, the reply from *various* sides is more
mischievous, the disgrace among the people is more unslumberable, the
load upon the soul is more consumingly heavy, and the

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

severance *from, and* contest *with*, Aûha*r*ma*zd* and Zaratû*s*t
become more incalculably perplexing. 15. And this, too, is my summing up
(khapîr) <span id="fr_1275"></span>[1](#fn_1271.md)--when your own
acquaintance with the religion and salvation of soul are *in* such
force--by the parable (ângunî-aîtakŏ) of that physician of the body who,
when they asked about destroying the toothache, thereupon gave his reply
thus: 'Dig *it* out!' and they rejoined thus: 'He is always wanted *as*
our physician, so that he may cure even a tooth which is diseased;' I
*would* extract its teeth <span id="fr_1276"></span>[2](#fn_1272.md) more
plentifully and *with* more suspicion than he.

16\. And if, also, those of the good religion in the country of Irân be,
therefore, always in want of the learning and acquaintance with religion
of *his* priestly lordship, so that he disperses the profession and the
preparation *and* management of the remedy <span
id="fr_1277"></span>[3](#fn_1273.md) of many diseases, then he throws it
away as a profession, *and* there is not much of a necessity for the
wisdom *and* learning of *his* priestly lordship. 17. For *there* are
*some* of the *present* time would never vouchsafe approval of a
presiding fire <span id="fr_1278"></span>[4](#fn_1274.md), which is in many
modes an advance of foreign habits; *and* of many *things* which are in
writing, *of* a nature easier and more comfortable in a worldly *sense*,
they offer and

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

always give more than he who is a priest; and, *at* last, no one ever
accepts *any* except him who is astute in evil *and* wicked <span
id="fr_1279"></span>[1](#fn_1275.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1255"></span>[325:1](sbe18113.htm#fr_1259.md) See the heading
to Ep. I.

<span id="fn_1256"></span>[325:2](sbe18113.htm#fr_1260.md) The eighth month
of the Parsi year, which must have been A.Y. 249 (see Ep. I, xi, 12,
note). This month corresponded to the interval between the 11th November
and the 10th December, 880; but it is evident from Chaps. VII, 2, VIII,
1 that this reply was written about the same time as Ep. III, that is,
in the interval between the 14th June and 13th July, 881.

<span id="fn_1257"></span>[325:3](sbe18113.htm#fr_1261.md) This appears to
have been the original form of the name Nîkhshahpûhar or Nîshahpûhar,
applied both to a man (see Ep. I, iv, 15, 17) and to a city in Khurâsân,
and in this place it is not quite <span id="page_326">p. 326</span>
certain whether a man or a city is alluded to. The text, as it stands in
the MSS., is as follows:--'Nâmakŏ zîtanŏ dên bidanâ Â*v*ânŏ mûn
Nîvshahpûhar nipi*s*tanŏ farmû*d*ŏ va ma*d*ŏ.' This can be translated as
in our text, if the word va be omitted; but, if this word be retained
and mûn be changed into min, the translation would be as follows:--'The
epistle which *some one was* ordered by you to write in the month Â*v*ân
from Nîvshahpûhar, and *which* came.' Now it is evident from Ep. I that
Zâ*d*-sparam must have been in Sîrkân for some time previous to the date
of that epistle, 15th March 881, and, therefore, probably in the
previous November; but, at the same time, it must be noticed that there
are allusions in this second epistle (see Chaps. I, 12, V, 3) to his
having been formerly at Sarakhs and among the Tughazghuz, that is, in
the extreme east of Khurâsân; it is, therefore, just possible that he
may have been at Nîvshahpûhar, on his way to Sîrkân in the south, in
November.

<span id="fn_1258"></span>[326:1](sbe18113.htm#fr_1262.md) J and BK attempt
to fill up the blank with the words kêshvar ar*g*, the value of the
realm;' but the original text probably stood thus:--'and *was received*
by me from *so and so*,' the names having been torn off in some
intermediate MS.

<span id="fn_1259"></span>[327:1](sbe18113.htm#fr_1263.md) Since he heard
from his correspondent. The word cannot be tî*s*gakŏ, 'nine days,' as
that would not tally with the dates of Eps. I and III.

<span id="fn_1260"></span>[327:2](sbe18113.htm#fr_1264.md) Referring
probably to the Bareshnûm ceremony which Zâ*d*-sparam wished to dispense
with in many cases.

<span id="fn_1261"></span>[328:1](sbe18113.htm#fr_1265.md) J omits this
phrase.

<span id="fn_1262"></span>[328:2](sbe18113.htm#fr_1266.md) Reading mê*s*akh
or miskha; but it may be masagîh, 'squeezing.

<span id="fn_1263"></span>[328:3](sbe18113.htm#fr_1267.md) J has merely the
words, 'even then the opinion of the high-priest for the realm,' which
gives a reverse meaning to the text.

<span id="fn_1264"></span>[328:4](sbe18113.htm#fr_1268.md) It appears from
this, that when a supreme high-priest became very old, his worldly
duties were put in commission, by being intrusted to a committee of four
of the most learned priests; but the opinion of the superannuated
high-priest was still supreme in spiritual matters, though not to be
trusted in worldly affairs.

<span id="fn_1265"></span>[328:5](sbe18113.htm#fr_1269.md) Whither
Mânû*sk*îhar had specially gone to hold this assembly before writing Ep.
I (see Ep. I, iii, 13).

<span id="fn_1266"></span>[329:1](sbe18113.htm#fr_1270.md) The MSS. have
Tughzghuz in Pâzand. Mas’âudî states (A.D. 943) that the *T*aghazghaz
were a powerful Turkish tribe who dwelt between Khurâsân and China, in
and around the town of Kû*s*ân, and not very far from the supposed
sources of the Ganges. They had become Manicheans, having been converted
from idolatry to the heretical form of Ma*zd*a-worship taught by Mazdak
(see Mas’âudî, ed. Barbier de Meynard, vol. i, pp. 214, 288, 299, quoted
at length in a note to Sls. VI, 7). It would seem from the allusion in
our text that Zâ*d*-sparam had recently been among these *T*aghazghaz,
and might have imbibed some of their heretical opinions, so as to lead
to this controversy with his brother and the orthodox people of Sîrkân.
That he had recently been in the extreme north-east of Khurâsân is
further shown by the allusion to Sarakhs in Chap. V, 3.

<span id="fn_1267"></span>[329:2](sbe18113.htm#fr_1271.md) Evidently some
recent pretender to the supreme high-priesthood, who had endeavoured to
conceal the deformity that disqualified him for that office.

<span id="fn_1268"></span>[329:3](sbe18113.htm#fr_1272.md) That is, fit for
the dignity he aspired to.

<span id="fn_1269"></span>[329:4](sbe18113.htm#fr_1273.md) Here written
Gîrmân (see Dd. XCIV, 13).

<span id="fn_1270"></span>[329:5](sbe18113.htm#fr_1274.md) Near Teherân.

<span id="fn_1271"></span>[330:1](sbe18113.htm#fr_1275.md) J converts the
phrase into 'very heinous to me,' by reading a*v*îr and adding girân.

<span id="fn_1272"></span>[330:2](sbe18113.htm#fr_1276.md) That is, he
would drive the morbid ideas from his brother's mind.

<span id="fn_1273"></span>[330:3](sbe18113.htm#fr_1277.md) Meaning the
practice of the Bareshnûm ceremony, for which the priests were specially
required.

<span id="fn_1274"></span>[330:4](sbe18113.htm#fr_1278.md) Probably because
they saw no necessity for the presence of the fire at the sacred
ceremonies. He is warning his brother that his heretical teachings would
soon make the people imagine that they could dispense with the
priesthood altogether.

<span id="fn_1275"></span>[331:1](sbe18113.htm#fr_1279.md) That is, some
priest who teaches such heresies. These terms are those applied to the
demons themselves in Pahl. Vend. XIX, 140, 141, 147.
