### CHAPTER VII.

1\. The sixth question is that which you ask thus: Why are we men
produced for the world, and what is it necessary for us to do therein?

2\. The reply is this, that even in the reply to an accompanying
question <span id="fr_74"></span>[2](#fn_73.md) *it* is written that the
creatures are achieved for <span id="fr_75"></span>[3](#fn_74.md) justice
and the performance of what is desirable for the creator; and to prepare
thoroughly well that which is unlimited and the virtuous progress of the
creatures, whose distress is like fear, there is the unparalleled
(abrâ*d*arvatô) renovation *of the universe*.

3\. And that preparation arises from the complete predominance of the
creator *and* the non-predominance of the fiend, as is said of it in
revelation thus: 'In that time I become completely predominant, I who am
Aûha*r*ma*zd*; in nothing whatever

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

is the evil spirit predominant.' 4. And also about the good procedure of
the creature-creation *it* is recounted thus: 'Happy *am* I when the
creatures are so created by me, and according to any wish whatever of
mine they give the sovereignty to me, and also come *to* the sovereignty
when I have created *it* for the performance of what is desirable for
the expression of what sovereignty is.'

5\. And it is necessary for us to become so in the world as that the
supreme sovereignty of the creator may be kept more friendly to us, its
own true servants. 6. The way to that true service is known through
wisdom, is believed (vâ*v*arî-aîtŏ) through truth, *and* is utilized
through goodness; and the path of excellence more particularly *leads
to* it. 7. And to set the good spirit rightly in the place of thought
*it is* deliberately taken *and* they should deliberately leave
*it* <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_75.md), as it is said in revelation
that Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke out to Zaratû*s*t thus: 'Thou shouldst assist
Vohûman with thy pure spiritual faculties (ahvŏ), so that they may make
him fully welcome; for when thou assistest Vohûman with thy pure
spiritual faculties, so that they make him fully welcome, thou shalt
thus fully understand the two ways, *that* which is good conduct, and
*that* also which is bad conduct.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_73"></span>[25:2](sbe18015.htm#fr_74.md) See Chap. III.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[25:3](sbe18015.htm#fr_75.md) Reading pavan instead
of ba*r*â, two words which are often confounded by the copyists of MSS.
because their Persian equivalents are nearly identical.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[26:1](sbe18015.htm#fr_76.md) Compare Chap. III,
15. The 'good spirit' is Vohûman.
