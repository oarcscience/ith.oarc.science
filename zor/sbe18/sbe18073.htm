<p>1. <I>As to</I> the sixty-fifth question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: <I>There is</I> a man of wealth of the good religion who fully intends to order a <I>celebration of</I> all <I>the rites</I> of his religion; and a priest of it, to whom the five chapters (fragar<I>d</I>&#335;) of the Avesta ('text') of the correct law of the N&icirc;rangist&acirc;n ('religious-formula code')&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_746"></A><A HREF="#fn_743"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are easy through the Zand commentary'), is ever progressing in priestly manhood (mag&ocirc;&icirc;-gab<I>r</I>&acirc;&icirc;h). 2. And he (the man) goes unto him, and he (the priest) speaks thus: 'All the religious rites are <I>performed</I> for 350 <I>dirhams</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_747"></A><A HREF="#fn_744"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, as a gift always given beforehand by them <I>who</I> give the order unto me, so that I <I>may</I> come to <I>them</I>.'</p>  
<p>3. A man of the disciples&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_748"></A><A HREF="#fn_745"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, to whom the five</p>

<p>sections (v&icirc;dag) of the Avesta are easy, and no-thing whatever of its Zand is easy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_749"></A><A HREF="#fn_746"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, then says unto him--unto that man who intends to order all the religious rites--thus: 'For this gift I will conduct all the religious rites for thee twice, with the appliances in the land of P&acirc;rs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_750"></A><A HREF="#fn_747"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, shouldst thou give the order unto me. 4. For it is quite possible for me to pray so many sections through my own exertion (dast&#335;), <I>but</I> for him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_751"></A><A HREF="#fn_748"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> it is necessary to order again of an officiating priest (pavan z&ocirc;tak&#335;), who is himself not able to pray any section, <I>or</I> does not himself pray; and it is not necessary for him to go for the control (parv&acirc;r)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_752"></A><A HREF="#fn_749"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of all the religious rites when a stipend (b&acirc;har) is the one consideration within him, <I>and</I> the matter is <I>that</I> he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_753"></A><A HREF="#fn_750"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> <I>may</I> receive again. 5. <I>He</I> who <I>has</I> always himself prayed is better than he who shall accept readily <I>and</I> orders <I>the work</I> again, and is not able to pray it himself, when a fulfilment is tedious to him; when <I>it</I> is I who&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_754"></A><A HREF="#fn_751"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> receive, I always pray myself better than he who would accept readily <I>and</I> orders again, and it brings on my business to a <I>closing</I> point.'</p>  
<p>6. The priestly man speaks thus: 'The consideration</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p><A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of stipend is more necessary to arise <I>with</I> me than&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_755"></A><A HREF="#fn_752"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> other men, owing to the position of religion, not the other portion (<I>s</I>&acirc;n&#335;) of all religious rites; therefore, it is more authorisedly received <I>and</I> conducted by me when I accept readily and again intrust <I>the work</I>; but I direct so that they pray thoroughly, and it brings on much business to its <I>closing</I> point; moreover, <I>if</I> I seize upon it, even then I should be authorised, for this is the stipend of religion.'</p>  
<p>7. Should they seize this that is authorisedly theirs, or not? <I>And</I> is <I>it</I> the custom of a man who is frequently ordering all the religious rites to reduce his gift for the ceremonial, or not?</p>  
<p>8. Order <I>some one</I> to decide for us clearly, when they do not dispute the gift <I>for</I> the ceremonial, or <I>when</I> they do dispute <I>it</I>, how is then its great advantage; <I>and</I> the harmfulness that exists therein, in many ways <I>and</I> many modes, when they give an insufficient gift for the ceremonial. 9. Is the property which is given up as a gift for the ceremonial--so long as it thus becomes the remuneration which <I>one</I> gives to a receiver of remuneration (mozd&ocirc;-bar)--that property which they can seize? 10. And is the work which is done, <I>or</I> deputed, and its great advantage, more than they would perform when, in the period of the evil millenniums&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_756"></A><A HREF="#fn_753"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, they diminish the gift for the ceremonial; <I>and</I> in how many modes</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A></p>  
<p>does its harm then proceed therefrom? 11. Of whom are all the religious rites always more authorisedly ordered; of that priestly man, or of that disciple? 12. <I>For</I> what reason, also, is it proper to diminish the gift for all the religious rites of him who is a priestly man, or to give <I>it</I> in excess? 13. When they do not diminish the gift for the ceremonial, and <I>it</I> is given in excess, in what manner does its great advantage then arise therefrom; <I>and</I> why <I>and</I> through what source (b&ecirc;kh) is it possible <I>for</I> advantage to arise therefrom? 14. When they diminish the gift what harm to it (the ceremonial) is then possible to arise therefrom, <I>and</I> how is <I>it</I> better when they give the gift for the ceremonial?</p>  
<p>15. For when the family householders, with those of the good religion of Ir&acirc;n, are early (p&ecirc;<I>s</I>) <I>with</I> every single <I>celebration of</I> all the religious rites with holy-water, in the land of P&acirc;rs, unless they are in distress, their gift is then 400 dirhams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_757"></A><A HREF="#fn_754"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and we have given more than this, <I>even</I> 450 dirhams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_758"></A><A HREF="#fn_755"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for it. 16. And now should it be needful, when we diminish anything from the 400 dirhams, or from the 450&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_759"></A><A HREF="#fn_756"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> dirhams, of their gift, they would then not accept <I>it</I> from us, <I>and</I> they speak thus: 'For 400 dirhams, or <I>at</I> least for 350 dirhams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_760"></A><A HREF="#fn_757"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; nothing less do we</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_205"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 205</FONT></A></p>  
<p>accept.' 17. <I>But</I> there are needy <I>men</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_761"></A><A HREF="#fn_758"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> who always come to us <I>and</I> speak thus: 'For 350 dirhams we will twice conduct all the religious rites with holy-water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_762"></A><A HREF="#fn_759"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, as you have always ordered us before for 400 dirhams; order <I>it</I> only of us, <I>for</I> shouldst thou have <I>it</I> managed by priestly men, they always say that they should always perform a curtailment (k&acirc;st&acirc;r&icirc;h) of the religious rites and ceremonies of the sacred beings, <I>and</I> that all the religious rites are not authorisedly ordered except of them.'</p>  
<p>18. Although a priest (a&ecirc;rpat&#335;) who becomes a ruler of the ceremonial should be doubly a decider, yet order <I>some one</I> to explain to us clearly concerning these questions, as asked by us.</p>  
<p>19. The reply is this, that the <I>man</I> of the good religion who intended to order all the religious rites is he whose desire is goodness, and he should be a decider of questions about it.</p>  
<p>20. <I>As to</I> the priest who spoke thus:--'Thou shouldst order <I>it</I> of me for 350&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_763"></A><A HREF="#fn_760"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> dirhams, as you have always given before your business <I>was arranged</I>; <I>and</I> it becomes your own non-religious share of the duty, to be authorisedly given, because you have proceeded with the alleged demeanour of the country, <I>and</I> for the purpose of intercession; and all the</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A></p>  
<p>religious rites with holy-water are such as they solemnize repeatedly (pavan d&ocirc;r), among which there are many in which&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_764"></A><A HREF="#fn_761"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I <I>act</I> and <I>am</I> very well performing'--the gift of 350 dirhams is then not excessive remuneration for him.</p>  
<p>21. <I>As to</I> the disciple who spoke thus:--'For 350 dirhams I will <I>twice</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_765"></A><A HREF="#fn_762"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> conduct all the religious rites in the land&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_766"></A><A HREF="#fn_763"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of P&acirc;rs'--such of them as they then conduct repeatedly are not many in the aggregate (<I>k</I>&icirc;nak&#335;), and they certainly damage his (the man's) property, and all the religious rites of fire, through that deficiency. 22. And they would accept it on this account, that through a love of righteousness they might cause an advantage (khan<I>g</I>&icirc;nak&#335;) unto all those religious rites by their own inferior eminence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_767"></A><A HREF="#fn_764"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 23. And he extends <I>and</I> impels the ceremonial of the sacred beings into much progress who promotes it through that eminence which is owing to his own wealth, <I>and</I> which is thus more possessed of a share (b&ocirc;n) of the ceremonial of the sacred beings and of the good work of praise--except, indeed, a like good work of praise of his--when they shall cause that manifestation of eminence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_768"></A><A HREF="#fn_765"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. 24. So that the orderer of the good work understands that that which is diminished by him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_769"></A><A HREF="#fn_766"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> is the eminence</p>  
<p>

<p>of the disciple, which his own wealth <I>has</I> to order for those who are not able to give wealth which is their own property for it; <I>and</I> he makes no curtailment (ban<I>g</I>i<I>s</I>n&#335;) of those scanty remunerations.</p>  
<p>25. And if that disciple should accept as remuneration less than is the custom <I>for</I> all the religious rites, <I>the orderer</I> is not undiminished in wealth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_770"></A><A HREF="#fn_767"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for the reason that the good effect owing to the advantage of holy-water is such as <I>when</I> they conduct <I>them</I> repeatedly, unless it be necessary to conduct <I>them</I> in a manner as <I>if</I> unpaid (pavan aga<I>z</I>&icirc;<I>d</I>). 26. That curtailment of the good effect is not afterwards demandable (pas&icirc;n-sakhun&icirc;k&#335;), if it <I>has</I> to be accepted by him; <I>and</I> if that acceptance of less remuneration by him be an opposing of him to the malice and ill-temper (vush&acirc;&icirc;) of the priests, this also is not <I>the way</I> that they should cause progress as regards their own <I>business</I>.</p>  
<p>27. And the proximity (nazd&icirc;h) of a master of the house&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_771"></A><A HREF="#fn_768"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>who</I> keeps away from all the religious rites requested <I>and</I> accepted--more particularly when the accepter accepts all the religious rites of the requester for that remuneration--is itself necessary; he may not be of a religious disposition, but it is yet requisite <I>for him</I> to be where this is requested</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and accepted for that scanty remuneration of his, owing to the extent and impetus of <I>his</I> share of the duty.</p>  
<p>28. Moreover, it is perceived by us in P&acirc;rs <I>that</I> they who would accept the work for half the remuneration which was requisite as profit for it formerly would seize the remuneration. 29. And the reason of it is this:--The peasants relied upon the corn of the field (kh&acirc;n&#335;) <I>which</I> has not come, <I>and they</I> said: 'We are hurried; we never obtain <I>anything</I> even on a single one of various debts, and by this payment we <I>shall</I> save <I>our</I> lives for the time; so we calculate that whatever we seize in the manner of a debt or two, when the corn arrives <I>and</I> we sell the corn, we <I>shall</I> make <I>as</I> profit on that business&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_772"></A><A HREF="#fn_769"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;'--and it seemed to me very desirable <I>for</I> such a man.</p>  
<p>30. If, also, they should approve that scanty remuneration of that disciple, it is an injury of all the religious rites, of which the forgivers &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_773"></A><A HREF="#fn_770"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>have</I> to cast the consideration of the unequally-shared advantage out of the body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_774"></A><A HREF="#fn_771"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 31. All the religious rites ordered of him who is a better performer, owing to not diminishing the proper remuneration, <I>having</I> proceeded unaltered, the remuneration of righteousness <I>one</I> does not approve is important as regards such as they solemnize and conduct in the period&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_775"></A><A HREF="#fn_772"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_209"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 209</FONT></A></p>  
<p>32. Since, for the 350 dirhams, all the religious rites which they conduct once with holy-water are, it is affirmed, all the religious rites caused to be conducted twice with holy-water in that same place <I>and with</I> the same good effect, it is more important to order of <I>them</I> who shall allow all the religious rites twice; for, with as much wealth, as much efficiency, and as much good effect, more ceremonial is good.</p>  
<p>33. The worthiness of the disciple, which is owing to himself, is the preparation; <I>and</I> the priest is worthy, of whose performance in the religion <I>you have</I> spoken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_776"></A><A HREF="#fn_773"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; therefore, supreme worthiness is unattainable by either of them; so it is more significant when the disciple is the preparer, <I>and</I> the priest, <I>as</I> director, becomes a demander of good effect; both strive for good progress, <I>and</I> through many kinds of participation they may be worthy. 34. And both of them, praising together--whereby the participation is brought <I>to</I> an end--may authorisedly seize&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_777"></A><A HREF="#fn_774"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; but that worthiness of theirs is owing to the duty and the praise therein--this <I>one</I> in preparing, <I>and</I> this <I>one</I> in superintendence (a<I>v</I>ar-ma<I>d</I>&icirc;h) of the recital--<I>and</I> the after discourse and petitioning, <I>and</I> other good done.</p>
