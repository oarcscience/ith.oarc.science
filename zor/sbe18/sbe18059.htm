<p>1. <I>As to</I> the fifty-first question <I>and</I> reply, that <I>which</I> you ask is thus: <I>There is</I> a man who hands over a dirham&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_672"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> as regards five bushels (kaf&icirc;<I>z</I>) of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A></p>  
<p>wheat, thus: 'I give this to thee as an instalment (b&ocirc;n-ae)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_673"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of five bushels of wheat at the end of a month;' and during the month, <I>and</I> at <I>its</I> end, those five bushels of wheat become five <I>times</I> the price; would they authorisedly seize the five bushels of wheat <I>when</I> winnowed (p&ecirc;kht&#335; ka<I>r</I><I>d</I>&#335;) by him, through that instalment which he handed over, or not?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that when they who shall take his dirham <I>have</I> to intrust the five bushels of wheat, unsuspiciously <I>and</I> by their own will, <I>to him</I> to winnow, even so as <I>they</I> are advisedly <I>and</I> unsuspiciously winnowed by him they should take <I>them</I> just as winnowed; <I>this</I> is the decision authorisedly given. 3. But when <I>it</I> is winnowed by him on account of very grievous necessity for payment, <I>it</I> is more suitable for the soul to beg the giver of the money, who is the purchasing payer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_677"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for <I>some</I> of that excess of undivided (ap&acirc;r) profit. 4.

<P><A NAME="fn_672"></A><A HREF="sbe18059.htm#fr_675">180:2</A> The dirham (&#0948;&#0961;&#0945;&#0967;&#0956;&#0942;) is a weight, and also a silver coin of that weight, but its amount is rather uncertain. According to the Pers. MS. M5 (fol. 55), written A.D. 1723, the proper dowry for a 'privileged' wife is 2000 dirhams of white-silver, or 2300 r&ucirc;p&icirc;s, and 2 dirhams of red gold, or 2&frac14; tolas. The r&ucirc;p&icirc;s formerly current in Gu<I>g</I>ar&acirc;t were less in value than the present Indian coinage, but the tola, which is the weight of the present r&ucirc;p&icirc;, was probably much the same as it is now, or 180 grains; the statement in M5 is, therefore, equivalent to saying that the dirham contained 202 grains of pure silver. This is so much more than the amount deducible from other authorities that it might be supposed that the st&icirc;r (&#0963;&#0964;&#0945;&#0964;&#0942;&#0961;) or tetradrachm was meant, if it were not confirmed, to some extent, by the Pers. Riv&acirc;yats, which state the dowry at 2000 dirhams of pure white silver and 2 d&icirc;n&acirc;rs of red gold of the N&icirc;sh&acirc;p&ucirc;r currency; the d&icirc;n&acirc;r being a gold coin containing a dirham weight of pure <A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A> gold. It is safer, however, to rely upon the average weight of the Sasanian dirham coins, which, according to Dr. Mordtmann's statement in ZDMG. vol. xii, pp. 44, 45, is about 63 grains, or 5 3/5 annas' worth of silver; so that the st&icirc;r would be 252 grains or 22 3/5 annas. But the actual value of such coins of former times can be ascertained only from the quantity of corn! or other well-defined necessary of life, which they would purchase.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_673"></A><A HREF="sbe18059.htm#fr_676">181:1</A> K35 has vaban twice in this sentence, but b&ocirc;n in &sect; 4. M14 alters this word and others, so as to make the chapter unintelligible. The money is supposed to be given merely as a deposit, in acknowledgment of a bargain to be carried out after the corn is ready for delivery.</P>
