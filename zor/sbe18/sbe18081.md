### CHAPTER LXXIV.

1\. *As to* the seventy-third question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: Is *there any* discomfiture (vânî*d*ârîh) of the archangels
from that stench, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that the archangels are immortal and
undistressed; their place, also, is in that best existence of light,
all-glorious, all-delightful, *and* undisturbed; and the strength of the
stench due to the demons <span id="fr_820"></span>[1](#fn_817) does not
reach unto *anything* pertaining to the archangels. 3. The, archangels
are omniscient <span id="fr_821"></span>[2](#fn_818), friendly to the
creatures, persistent, *and* procure forgiveness; they know that heinous
practice which is the heinous practice <span
id="fr_822"></span>[3](#fn_819) of that wretched dupe (frîftakŏ) who
*has* become defiled in that most filthy manner (zî*s*ttûm ârang), which
is like that which is provided *and* which is applied to him even in the
terrible punishment <span id="fr_823"></span>[4](#fn_820) that *has*
come upon him from the demons; and then, on account of *their*
friendliness to the creatures, it *has*

seemed to them severe, and thereby arises their forgiveness which is
according to whatever anguish is owing to the torment which galls him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_817"></span>[221:1](sbe18081.htm#fr_820) Reading
a*z*-*s*êdâîkŏ, but it may be â*z*-*s*êdâîkŏ, 'of the demon of
greediness,' or it may stand for kha*v*dak-*s*êdâîkŏ, 'of a male
paramour of the demons,' as mentioned in the last note.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[221:2](sbe18081.htm#fr_821) Omniscience with
regard to what is taking place in the world being an indispensable
characteristic of any being to whom prayers are addressed, or whose
intercession is implored.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[221:3](sbe18081.htm#fr_822) These words are
thus repeated in K35, and the repetition may be correct.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[221:4](sbe18081.htm#fr_823) Referring probably
to the punishment of such. a sinner, detailed in AV. XIX, 1-3, as
follows:--'I saw the soul of a man, through the fundament of which soul,
as it were, a snake, like a beam, went in, and came forth out of the
mouth; and many other snakes ever seized all the limbs.'
