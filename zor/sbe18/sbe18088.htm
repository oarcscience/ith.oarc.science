<p>1. <I>As to</I> the eightieth question and reply, that which you ask is thus: What is the purpose of this <I>ceremony for</I> the living soul&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> why&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> is it necessary</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_238"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 238</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to order <I>it?</I> 2. And, whenever <I>one</I> orders it, how is it necessary then to order it, how is it best when they celebrate <I>it</I>, and what is its great advantage <I>as</I> a good work?</p>  
<p>3. The reply is this, that worship with the ceremonial <I>for</I> those newly passed <I>away, during</I> the three days which <I>they spend</I> in the account&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is suitable for the discreet, just as the protection with nourishment of those newly born, in their infancy, is also much more suitable for the discreet. 4. He is a truly discreet man through whom <I>there</I> is ceremonial for the three <I>days</I>, on account of his own father, and privileged wife, and infant child, <I>and</I> well-behaved servant, on <I>their</I> passing away; and it is indispensable to order the triple ceremonial of the three days.</p>  
<p>5. This, too, is said: where it is not possible to solemnize his three <I>days</I>, or they solemnize <I>them</I> afterwards, when information <I>of the death</I> arrives&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, three days are to be solemnized as a substitute <I>for</I> those three. 6. For the good work of the ceremonial which is ordered by him himself, or bequeathed by him, or is his <I>through</I> consenting to it by design&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, exists--even though it is thus possible that it will be conducted afterwards--whenever it comes into progress; therefore he is exalted for it at his account</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in the three <I>days</I>, and it comes on for his <I>being</I> exalted. 7. When that which is conducted afterwards comes on for aiding <I>his being</I> exalted in the three <I>days</I> of the account, that which <I>was</I> conducted by him himself beforehand is more hopeful <I>and</I> more certain of being exalted in that position.</p>  
<p>8. On account of there being also a diminution (a&icirc;t&#335;-<I>k</I> gah&icirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r&icirc;h) of risk about their own souls, in the event of (min zak a&icirc;gh hat) their children not ordering the three <I>days' ceremonial</I>, or it not being possible to solemnize <I>it</I> at that time, it is desirable to order, in their own lifetime and <I>at</I> their own convenience, <I>the ceremony for</I> their own living souls, advisedly, without doubt, and <I>having</I> appointed the <I>mode of</I> life of the three <I>days</I>, and also to appoint by will him who is to conduct <I>it</I> in the end. 9. And when both are conducted, the increase of good works and exaltation, though the end is not possible, or is not proceeded <I>with</I>--and the previous good works are commendable, and, therefore, preservatory--<I>has</I> reached even unto the most lordly wishes.</p>  
<p>10. <I>As to</I> the man <I>with</I> great <I>and</I> powerful children, to whom the ceremonial of the three <I>days</I> for himself <I>at</I> the final day, <I>and</I> also the progress of many good works <I>have</I> seemed certain, <I>but</I> on account of yet another way to freedom from doubt effectually (fr&acirc;r&acirc;st&icirc;h&acirc;) existing, he <I>has</I> bequeathed the conduct of the three <I>days' ceremonial</I>, and also other good works, unto <I>his</I> children, in order that <I>the ceremony for</I> the living soul <I>may be</I> conducted <I>at</I> the final day, with him the angels are in triumph, the glory of the religion in the most lordly glory, <I>and</I> the solemnizers of ceremonial worship are many. 11. Then, moreover, owing to the contest of the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_240"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 240</FONT></A></p>  
<p>demons--so unjust that <I>on</I> the day of his passing <I>away it</I> is due to the uncleanness (ap&acirc;<I>d</I>y&acirc;<I>v</I>&icirc;h) which <I>has</I> attained unto <I>its full</I> extent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--all the solemnizers <I>in</I> the country, of the acts of worship solemnized, <I>may have</I> become thoroughly doubtful of the worship, and until it goes on to the disciples, and the ceremony is prepared, it is not proper to perform the whole ceremonial; in that way is manifested the great advantage <I>and</I> commendableness which <I>arises</I> from that ceremony <I>for</I> his living soul.</p>  
<p>12. The nature of <I>the ceremony</I> ordered <I>for</I> the living soul is a counterpart of the three <I>days</I>, so <I>it</I> is needful that <I>at</I> all times of the three days <I>and</I> nights, successively emancipative (avad&icirc;g&icirc;ni<I>s</I>n&icirc;k), a ceremonial <I>in honour</I> of Sr&ocirc;sh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>be</I> always conducted, and <I>that</I> it proceed; and a fire is lighted in the ceremonial, and the clean ligature of the limbs is to be tied. 13. As a rule it is so considered that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the three days <I>there</I> are fifteen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> ceremonies (ya<I>s</I>tan&#335;) <I>in honour</I> of Sr&ocirc;sh, and three sacred cakes (dr&ocirc;n)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> which are consecrated in each dawn (b&acirc;m-<I>i</I>) with various dedications; and the fourth day they solemnize the Vispara<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, the portion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> of the righteous guardian spirits (ar<I>d</I>&acirc;&icirc; fravar<I>d</I>&#335;). 14.

<p>are fugitives of families of the period, <I>and</I> other still further diminishers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of good works, who <I>have</I> wished to produce the wealth which is necessary to perform advantageously, as a custom of the soul in those three days, one <I>celebration</I> of all the religious rites (ham&acirc;k d&icirc;n&ocirc;) <I>in honour</I> of Sr&ocirc;sh, <I>and</I> the consecration of three sacred cakes for Sr&ocirc;sh every day; and the third night, at dawn&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the consecration of a sacred cake <I>dedicated in</I> three modes. 15. In accomplishing the <I>consecration of the</I> sacred cake specially for the righteous guardian spirits, <I>on</I> the fourth day, <I>one</I> is supposed to order a Dv&acirc;<I>z</I>dah-h&ocirc;m&acirc;st&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <I>in honour</I> of the righteous guardian spirits, and the rest of the ceremonial.</p>  
<p>16. And <I>he</I> who <I>has</I> intended much more laudably is declared <I>as</I> the more devout and more judicious of worshippers; and for the sake of the ceremonial he is cleansed by the Bareshn&ucirc;m <I>ceremony</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> is to practise other descriptions of cleanliness as regards <I>his</I> body and clothing. 17.
