### CHAPTER XXXVII.

1\. *As to* the thirty-sixth question and reply, that which you ask is
thus: How shall they produce the resurrection, how do they prepare the
dead, and when the dead are prepared by them, how are they? 2. When it
is produced by them, is an increase in the brilliance of the stars,
moon, and sun necessary, *and* does it arise, or not? are *there* seas,
rivers, *and* mountains, or not? and is the world just as large as this,
or does it become more *so* and wider?

3\. The reply is this, that the preparation and production of the
resurrection are an achievement *connected* with miracle, a sublimity
(rabâîh), and, afterwards, also a wondrous appearance unto the creatures
who are uninformed. 4. The secrets and affairs of the persistent creator
are like every mystery and secret; excepting himself--he who is
*capable* of all knowledge, the fully-informed, and all in all (vispânŏ
vispô)--no one of the worldly beings and imperfect spirits *has* known
them.

5\. A true proverb (gôbi*s*nŏ-gô) of the intelligent *and* worldly,
which is obvious, is that as it is easier in teaching to teach again
learning *already* taught *and* forgotten than that which *was*
untaught, and easier to repair again a well-built house, given
gratuitously, than that *which* is not *so* given, so also the formation
*again* of that which *was* formed is more excellent (hunîrtar), and the
wonder is

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

less, than the creation of creatures. 6. And through the wisdom and
glory *of* the omniscient and omnipotent creator, by whom the saddened
(âlîkhtŏ) creatures *were* created, that which *was* to perish is
produced again anew, *and that which was* not to perish, except a
little, is produced handsome even for a creation of the creator <span
id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_265.md).

7\. He who is a pure, spiritual creature is made unblemished; he, also,
who is a worldly creature is immortal and undecaying, hungerless and
thirstless, undistressed and painless; while, though he moves
(*g*undê*d*ŏ) in a gloomy, evil existence, the fiend is rightly judging
from *its* arrangement (min nivâr*d*ŏ) *that it* is not the place of a
beneficent *being*, but the place of an existence *which* is deadly,
ignorant, deceiving, full of malice, seducing, destroying, causing
disgrace; making unobservant (aûbêngar), and full of envy. 8. And his
existence is so full of malice, deceit, seductiveness, unobservance,
destructiveness, and destruction that *he has* no voice except for
accomplices (ham-bû*d*îkân) and antagonists, except also for his own
*creatures and* gossips when *their* hearts are desirous of evil,
seducing, destroying, making unobservant, causing malice, and bearing
envy. 9. And *he* is disclosed (vishâ*d*) from his own origin and abyss
full of darkness, unto the limits of darkness *and* confines of the
luminaries; and in his terribleness and demoniacal deliberation he gazes
at the unblemished light and creatures of the beneficent Aûha*r*ma*zd*.
10. And through abundant envy and complete maliciousness is his lying;
and he mounts (sûbârê*d*ŏ) to seize, destroy,

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

render unobservant, and cause to perish *these* same well-formed
creatures of the sacred beings. I1. And owing to his observance of
falsehood he directed falsehood *and* lies with avidity (varenô), which
were necessary for obtaining his success in his own rendering *others*
unobservant (aûbênŏ); even in the nine thousand winters (hazangrôk
zîm) <span id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_266.md) of falsehood that which is
disregarded therein is his own falsity.

12\. He who is the most lordly of the lords of the pre-eminent
luminaries, and the most spiritual of spirits, and all *the beings* of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* the creator--who was himself capable of an effectual
(tûbânŏ) gain for every scheme of his <span
id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_267.md)--do not allow that fiend into the
interior, into the radiance (farôgî*d*) of the luminaries. 13. And
*they* <span id="fr_269"></span>[3](#fn_268.md) understood through *their*
own universal wisdom that fiend's thoughts <span
id="fr_270"></span>[4](#fn_269.md) of vileness, and *meditation* of
falsehood

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

*and* lies, and became aware *of them* by themselves and through their
own intuition, and shall not accept the perdition (aôshîh) of the fiend,
*but* are to be rightly listening to the commands of him <span
id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_270.md) who is worthy. 14. For his <span
id="fr_272"></span>[2](#fn_271.md) is not the nature of him who is good,
*nor* the wisdom of him who is propitious; and he does not turn from the
confines of the shining ones, and the developments pertaining to those
of the good *being* <span id="fr_273"></span>[3](#fn_272.md), until he
arrives at the creatures; and he struggles in an attempt (aûzmânŏ),
spreads forth into the sky, is mobbed (garôhagî-aît) in combats, is
completely surrounded, *and* is tested *with* perfect appliances. 15:
His resources, also, are destroyed, *his* internal <span
id="fr_274"></span>[4](#fn_273.md) vigour is subdued, *his* weapons of
falsehood are disregarded, and *his* means of deceiving shall perish;
and with completeness of experience, thorough painfulness, routed
troops, broken battle-array, and disarranged means he enjoys on the
outside the radiance of the luminaries with the impotence (anaîyyâragîh)
of a desire which again returns to him.

16\. And the same well-shining light of all kinds of the creator, when
they shall not let in him who is Aharman, shall remain an unlimited
time, *while* the fiend is in household attendance on those of the
frontier through not being let in, *and* constantly troubled at the
everlasting creatures. 17. The household attendance of the fiend seemed
to it <span id="fr_275"></span>[5](#fn_274.md) perpetually afflicting; and
also the previous struggle

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

of the fiend when the celestial spirit (ahvô) *pertaining* to the
luminaries *was* not contended *with* by him, *his* defeat
(makhîtûntanŏ) when the luminaries *were* not defeated by him, *his*
infliction of punishment before sin, and *his* causing hatred before
hatred *exists* are all recounted by it to the justice and judiciousness
whose unchangeableness, will, persistence, and freedom from
hatred--which is the character of its faithful ones--are not so <span
id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_275), to him who is the primeval (pê*s*akŏ.md)
creator.

18\. The fiend, after *his* falsity, the struggle--on account of the
fighting of the shining ones *and* the decreed keeping *him* away which
*was* due to the fighter for the luminaries--*and* the ill-success of
the struggle of himself and army, ordered the beating back of the worthy
fighter *against* destruction, the malicious avenging again of the
causer of hatred, *and* the destroyer's internal vileness and
disorganisation anew of his own place. 19. He saw the beneficent actions
by which, through the wisdom of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the spiritual
wisdom <span id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_276.md), within the allotted
(burîn-hômônd) time, the limited space, the restricted conflict, the
moderate trouble, *and* the definite (far*g*âm-hômand) labour
*existing*, struggles against the fiend, who is the unlawful establisher
*of* the wizard; and he returned inside to fall disarmed (asâmânŏ) *and*
alive, *and* until he shall be fully tormented (pûr-dar*d*ag-hâe) and
shall be thoroughly experienced, they shall not <span
id="fr_278"></span>[3](#fn_277.md) let *him* out again in the allotted time
that the fiend ordered *for* the success of falsehood *and* lies. 20.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And the same fiend
*and* the primeval (kâdmôn) demons are cast out confusedly,
irreverently, sorrowfully, disconcertedly, fully afflicting *their*
friends, thoroughly experienced, even with their falsehoods and not
inordinate means <span id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_278.md), with lengthy
slumbers, with broken-down (a*v*asîst) deceits and dissipated resources,
confounded and impotent, into the perdition of Aharman, the
disappearance of the fiend, the annihilation of the demons, and the
non-existence of antagonism.

21\. To make the good creatures again fresh and pure, *and* to keep
*them* constant and forward in pure and virtuous conduct is to render
them immortal; and the not letting in of the co-existent *one* <span
id="fr_280"></span>[2](#fn_279.md), owing to the many new assaults
(pa*dg*astŏîh) that *occur* in his perpetual household attendance <span
id="fr_281"></span>[3](#fn_280.md) of falsity--through which *there* would
have been a constant terror of light for the creatures of the sacred
beings--is to maintain a greater advantage. 22. And his
(Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s) means are not the not letting in *of the fiend*, but
the triumph arranged for him*self* in the end--the endless <span
id="fr_282"></span>[4](#fn_281.md), unlimited light *being* also produced
by him, and the constantly-beneficial space <span
id="fr_283"></span>[5](#fn_282.md)

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

that is self-sustained--which (triumph) is the resource of all natures,
races, characters, powers, *and* duties from the beginning and maturing
of those of the good religion and the rushing of the liar and destroyer
on to the creatures, which are requisite *for* the final, legitimate
triumph of the well-directing creator, and *for* the termination of the
struggles of all by the protection and recompense of the praises and
propitiation performed, which are the healing of the righteous *and* the
restoration of the wicked *at* the renovation. 23. Even these
developments, even these established habits (da*d*-*s*ânîhâ), even these
emissions of strength, even these births, even these races, even these
townspeople (dihîkŏîhâ), even these characters, even these
sciences <span id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_283.md), even these manageable
and managing ones <span id="fr_285"></span>[2](#fn_284.md), and even these
other, many, special species and manners which at various periods
(anbânŏ) of time are in the hope that the quantity and nature of their
auxiliaries *may be* complete, and their coming accomplished and not
deficient in success (vakhtŏ), are distributed and made happy by him.

24\. The sky is in three thirds, of which the one at the top is joined
to the endless light, in which is the constantly-beneficial space; the
one at the

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

bottom reached to the gloomy abyss, in which is the fiend full of evil;
and one is between those two thirds *which are* below and above. 25. And
the uppermost third, *which* is called 'the rampart of the supreme
heaven' (garô*d*mânô drupû*s*tŏ) <span id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_285.md),
*was* made by him with purity, all splendour, and every pleasure, and no
access to it for the fiend. 26. And he provided that third for
undisturbedly convoking the pure, the archangels, *and* the righteous
*that have* offered praises who, as *it were* unarmed (azenâvar),
struggle unprepared and thoroughly in contest *with* the champions of
the co-existent *one*, and they smite the co-existent *one* and his own
progeny (gôhârakŏ) *already* described, and afford support to the
imperishable state <span id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_286.md), through the
help of the archangels and the glory of the creator. 27. And, again
also, in their <span id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_287.md) fearlessness they
seek for the destruction of the demons and for the perfection of the
creatures of the good *beings*; as *one* who is fearless, owing to some
rampart which is inaccessible *to* arrows and blows, and shoots arrows
at the expanse below, is troubled (bakhsê*d*ŏ) for friends below.

28\. And he made a distinction in the prescribed splendour and glory for
the lowermost third of the sky; and the difference is *that* it is
liable to injury (pavan resh), so that the fiend, who is void of
goodness, comes *and* makes that third full of darkness and full of
demons, *and* shall be able to perplex in that difficulty when the
thousand winters occur, and the five detested (lakhsî*d*akŏ) kinds of
the

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

demons of life <span id="fr_289"></span>[1](#fn_288.md) have also
overwhelmed with sin those of the wicked who are deceived by the demons
and *have* fled from the contest. 29. *But* they shall not let the fiend
fully in, owing to the luminaries of the resplendent *one*, during the
allotted time when the demons' punishing and the repentance of the
wicked are accomplished.

30\. And he appointed for the middle third the creatures of the world
separated <span id="fr_290"></span>[2](#fn_289.md) from, the world and the
spiritual *existence*; and among those creatures <span
id="fr_291"></span>[3](#fn_290.md) *were* produced for them the managing
man as a guardian of the creatures, and the deciding wisdom *as* an
appliance of man; *and* the true religion, the best of knowledge *was*
prepared by him. 31. And that third is for the place of combat and the
contest of the two different natures <span
id="fr_292"></span>[4](#fn_291.md); and in the uppermost part of the same
third is stationed by him the light *of* the brilliant sun and moon and
glorious stars, and *they* are provided by him that they may watch <span
id="fr_293"></span>[5](#fn_292.md) the coming of the adversary, and revolve
around the creatures. 32. All the *sacred* ceremonies of the distant
earth (bûm), the light, the abundant rains, and the good angels vanquish

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

and smite the wizards *and* witches who rush *about* below them <span
id="fr_294"></span>[1](#fn_293.md), *and* struggle to perplex by injury to
the creatures; they make all such assailants become fugitives <span
id="fr_295"></span>[2](#fn_294.md). 33. And through their revolution the
ascents and descents, the increase and diminution (narafsi*s*nŏ), of the
creatures <span id="fr_296"></span>[3](#fn_295.md) shall occur, the flow
and ebb of the seas, and the increase of the dye-like <span
id="fr_297"></span>[4](#fn_296.md) blood of the inferior creatures <span
id="fr_298"></span>[5](#fn_297.md); also owing to them *and* through *them
have* elapsed the divisions of the days, nights, months, years, periods,
*and* all the millenniums (hazagrôk zîmân) of time.

34\. He also appointed unto *our fore*fathers the equipment which is
their own, a material vesture, a sturdy bravery, and the guardian
spirits of the righteous; and he provided that they *should* remain *at*
various times in their own nature <span id="fr_299"></span>[6](#fn_298.md),
and come into worldly vesture. 35. And those for great hosts *and* many
slaves are born, for the duties of the period, into *some* tribe; he who
has plenty of offspring is like Fravâk <span
id="fr_300"></span>[7](#fn_299.md), he who is of the early law

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (pê*s*dâ*d*ŏ) like
Hôshâng <span id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_300.md), he who is a smiter of the
demon like Tâkhmôrup <span id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_301.md), he who is
full of glory like Yim <span id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_302.md), he who is
full of healing like Frê*d*ûn, he who has both wisdoms <span
id="fr_304"></span>[4](#fn_303.md) like the righteous Mânû*sk*îhar <span
id="fr_305"></span>[5](#fn_304.md), he who is full of strength like
Keresâsp <span id="fr_306"></span>[6](#fn_305.md), he who is of a glorious
race like Kai-Kavâ*d* <span id="fr_307"></span>[7](#fn_306.md), he who is
full of wisdom like Aôshânar <span id="fr_308"></span>[8](#fn_307.md). 36.
He who is noble is like Sîyâvash <span id="fr_309"></span>[9](#fn_308.md),
he who is an eminent doer (a*v*arkâr) like Kaî-Khûsrôî <span
id="fr_310"></span>[10](#fn_309.md), he who is exalted like
Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_311"></span>[11](#fn_310.md), he who is
completely good like the righteous Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_312"></span>[12](#fn_311.md), he who arranges the world like
Peshyôtanû <span id="fr_313"></span>[13](#fn_312.md), he who is over the
religion (dînô-a*v*arag)

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

like Atû*r*ŏ-pâ*d* <span id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_313.md), he who is
liturgical like Hûshê*d*ar <span id="fr_315"></span>[2](#fn_314.md), he who
is legal like Hûshê*d*ar-mâh, and he who is metrical and concluding like
Sôshâns. 37. Among them are many illustrious ones, glorious doers,
supporters of the religion, and good managers, who are completely (âpûr)
for the smiting of the fiend and the will of the creator.

38\. He also produced the creatures as contenders, and granted
assistance (vê*d*varih), through the great, in the struggle for the
perfect happiness from heaven at the renovation <span
id="fr_316"></span>[3](#fn_315.md) *of the universe*; and he made *them*
universally (vâspôharakânîhâ) contented. 39. A vitiated thought of a
living, well-disposed *being* is a stumble (ni*s*î*v*ŏ) which is owing
to evil; and these are even those <span id="fr_317"></span>[4](#fn_316.md)
contented with death, because they know their limit, *and* it shall be
definite (burînŏ-hômônd) and terminable; the evil of the world, in life,
is definite, and they shall not make *one* exist unlimitedly *and*
indefinitely in the evil of the world, through an eternal life with
pain.

40\. And through a great mystery, wholly miraculous, he produced a
durable immortality for the living a perplexity so long as the best and
utmost of it is such an immortality of adversity, for *it* is

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

ever living molested and eternally suffering. 41. And their development,
the strength of lineage obtained, is ever young in succession, and the
tender, well-destined *ones*, who are good, are in adversity and
perpetuity of life, so that there is a succession of life through their
own well-destined offspring <span id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_317.md). 42.
They become eternally famous, so that they obtain, every one, an old age
which is renewed, *free* from sickness and decay, visibly in their own
offspring and family (gôharakŏ) whenever they become complete; and any
one of the combative, whose struggle is through the smiting that his
fellow-combatant obtains, is of a comfortable disposition at the
balance <span id="fr_319"></span>[2](#fn_318.md). 43. This *one*, too, is
for stepping forth to heaven, even as that pre-eminent *one* of the
righteous, the greatest of the apostles and the most fortunate of those
born, the chief of worldly beings, the righteous Zaratû*s*t the
Spîtamân, when the omniscient wisdom, *as* a trance (gîp), came upon him
from Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and he saw him who *was* immortal *and* childless,
and also him *who was* mortal *and provided* with children that
perpetual life of the childless then seemed to him terrible, and that
succession of mortals *seemed* commendable <span
id="fr_320"></span>[3](#fn_319.md); so that

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

the coming of *his* assured offspring <span
id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_320.md), Hûshê*d*ar, Hûshê*d*ar-mâh, *and*
Sôshâns <span id="fr_322"></span>[2](#fn_321.md), became more longed for
and more desired, *and* death *more* than the perpetual life of his own
body.

44\. And when he <span id="fr_323"></span>[3](#fn_322.md) who is
all-watchful and all-knowing had arranged the means of opposing the
fiend, *there* came for destroying, like a general leader (vispvar),
that fiend of deceiving nature, the harassing, rushing, evil-wishing,
primeval (pê*s*) contender, *together* with the demons Akômanô ('evil
thought') <span id="fr_324"></span>[4](#fn_323), Aêshm ('wrath'.md), Zarmân
('decrepitude'), Bûshasp ('lethargy'), craving distress, bygone
luck <span id="fr_325"></span>[5](#fn_324.md), Vâê <span
id="fr_326"></span>[6](#fn_325), Varenô ('lust'.md) <span
id="fr_327"></span>[7](#fn_326.md), Astô-vîdâ*d* <span
id="fr_328"></span>[8](#fn_327.md), and Vîzarâsh <span
id="fr_329"></span>[9](#fn_328.md), and the original, innumerable demons
and fiends of Mâzendarân <span id="fr_330"></span>[10](#fn_329.md). 45. And
his darkness *and* gloom, scorpions (kadzûnŏ), porcupines, and vermin,
poison

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

and venom, and the mischief originally in the lower-most third of the
sky <span id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_330.md), issue upwards, astute in
evil, into the middle third, in which are the agreeable <span
id="fr_332"></span>[2](#fn_331.md) creatures which Aûha*r*ma*zd* created.

46\. And he smote the ox <span id="fr_333"></span>[3](#fn_332.md), he made
Gâyômar*d* mortal, and he shook the earth; and the land was shattered,
creation became dark, and the demons rushed below, above, and on all
sides, and they mounted even to the uppermost third of the sky <span
id="fr_334"></span>[4](#fn_333). 47. And there the barricade (band.md) and
rampart fortifying (vakhshîkŏ) the spiritual world is approached, for
which the safeguard (nigâs) of all barricades <span
id="fr_335"></span>[5](#fn_334.md), that is itself the great glory of the
pure religion, solving doubts--which is the safeguard of all
barricades--is arrayed. 48. And the splendid, belt-bearing
Pleiades <span id="fr_336"></span>[6](#fn_335.md), like the star-studded
girdle of the spirit-fashioned, good religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, are so arrayed as luminaries of the fully-glorious
ones. 49. And there was no possibility (aîtŏkîh) of any demon or fiend,
nor yet even of

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

the demon of demons, the mightiest (mazvantûm) in valour, rushing up
across that boundary; they are beaten back now, when *they have* not
reached *it* from the gloom, at once *and* finally (yak-vayô akha*r*).

50\. And the fiend *of* gloomy race, accustomed to destruction
(aôsh-âyin), changed into causes of death the position (gâs) of the
brilliant, supreme heaven of the pure, heavenly angels--which he
ordained through the power *of* <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_336.md)
Mîtôkht ('falsehood')--and the triumph of the glory of the world's
creatures, *as ordained* through two decrees (zîkŏ):--one, the
destruction of the living by the power <span
id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_337.md) of death; and one causing the manacling
of souls by a course of wickedness. 51. And he made *as* leaders therein
that *one* astute in evil who is *already* named <span
id="fr_339"></span>[3](#fn_338.md), and Astô-vîdâ*d* <span
id="fr_340"></span>[4](#fn_339.md) *who* is explained *as* 'the
disintegration of material beings;' he also intrusted the demon Bûshasp
('lethargy') <span id="fr_341"></span>[4](#fn_339.md) with the weakening of
the breath, the demon Tap ('fever') <span
id="fr_342"></span>[5](#fn_340.md) with stupefying and disordering the
understanding, and the demon Â*z* ( greediness') <span
id="fr_343"></span>[6](#fn_341.md) with suggesting cravings and causing
drinking before *having* the thirst of a dog <span
id="fr_344"></span>[7](#fn_342.md). 52. Also the demon Zarmân
(decrepitude') <span id="fr_345"></span>[8](#fn_343.md) for injuring the
body and abstracting

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

the strength; the bad Vâê's tearing away the life by stupefying the
body; the demon Aêshm e wrath') for occasioning trouble by contests, and
causing an increase of slaughter; the noxious creatures of gloomy places
for producing stinging and causing injury; the demon Zâîrî*k* <span
id="fr_346"></span>[1](#fn_344.md) for poisoning eatables and producing
causes of death; with Nîyâ*z* ('want') <span
id="fr_347"></span>[2](#fn_345.md) the stealthily-moving and dreading the
light <span id="fr_348"></span>[3](#fn_346.md), the fearfulness of Nihîv
terror') chilling the warmth, and many injurious powers and demons of
the destroyers were made by him constant assist-ants of Astô-vîdâ*d* in
causing death.

53\. Also, for rendering wicked *and* making *fit* for hell those whose
souls are under the sway of <span id="fr_349"></span>[4](#fn_347.md)
falsehood (kadbâ), which in religious language is called Mîtôkht--since
it is said in revelation that that is as much an evil as all the demons
with the demons of demons--there is Akômanô (evil thought') <span
id="fr_350"></span>[5](#fn_348.md), who is with the evil spirit owing to
the speaking of Mîtôkht ('falsehood') <span
id="fr_351"></span>[6](#fn_349). 54. And for his doctrine (dinôîh.md) of
falsehood, and winning the creatures, slander the deceiver, lust the
selfish, hatred, and envy, besides the overpowering progress of disgrace
(nang), the improper desires of the creatures, indolence in seeking
wisdom, quarrelling about that

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

which is no indication of learning, disputing (sitô*g*) about the nature
of a righteous *one*, and many other seductive powers *and* demons
helping to win, *were* made auxiliary to the doctrine of falsehood in
deceiving the creatures.

55\. Also, to turn his disturbance <span id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_350.md)
to creatures of even other kinds, *there* are demons *and* fiends of
further descriptions (freh-aîtân); and for the assistance of those
combatants he established also *those* afflictions (nîvakân) of many,
the witches of natures for gloomy *places*, whose vesture is the
radiance of the lights <span id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_351.md) that fall,
*and* rush, and turn below the luminaries which have to soar
(vâ*z*i*s*nîkânŏ) in stopping the way of *any* little concealment of the
spirits *and* worldly *beings* <span id="fr_354"></span>[3](#fn_352.md).
56. And they (the witches) overspread the light and glory of those
*luminaries*, of whose bestowal of glory and their own diminution *of
it*, moreover, for seizing the creatures, consist the pain, death, and
original evil of the abode for the demon of demons <span
id="fr_355"></span>[4](#fn_353.md).

57\. And those demons *and* original fiends, who are the heads and
mighty *ones* of the demons, injudiciously, prematurely moving,
prematurely speaking, not for their own disciplined advantage,

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

but with unbecoming hatred, lawless manner <span
id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_354.md), envy, *and* spears exposing the
body <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_355.md), undesirably struggle
together--a perplexing contention of troublers--about the destruction of
the luminaries. 58. The army of angels, judiciously and leisurely
fighting for the good creatures of the sacred beings, not with premature
hatred and forward spears (pê*s*-nîzahîh), but by keeping harm away
*from* themselves--the champions' customary mode <span
id="fr_358"></span>[3](#fn_356.md) of wounding--valiantly, strongly,
properly, and completely triumphantly struggle *for* a victory
triumphantly fought. 59. For Aharman the demons are procurers
(vashîkânŏ) of success *in* the contests till the end, when the fiend
becomes invisible *and* the creatures become pure.

60\. Since worldly *beings* observe, explain, *and* declare among
worldly *beings* the work of the spirits and knowledge of customs
(rîstakŏ),by true observation, through wisdom, *that* that life (zîk) is
proper when *it is* in the similitude of the true power of wisdom, *and*
the visible life is undiscerning of that which is to come *and* that
which is provided, so also the evidence of a knowledge of the end of the
contention is certain *and* clearly visible. 61. And tokens are
discernible and signs apparent which, to the wisdom of the ancients--if
it extended, indeed, to a knowledge about this pre-eminent
subject--*were* hidden by the fiends, who are concealers *of them* from
the perception (hâ*z*i*s*nŏ) of worldly *beings*, and also from *their*
coming to the perception of worldly *beings*.

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

62\. The learned high-priests who *were* founders (pâyînkânŏ) *of the
religion* knew *it* (*the evidence*), and those portions of it *were*
transmitted by them to the ancients which the successive realisers of
it, for the ages before me (levînam), *have* possessed. 63. The
deceivers <span id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_357.md) of the transmitters, who
have existed *at* various times, even among those who are blessed <span
id="fr_360"></span>[2](#fn_358.md), *have* remained a mass of knowledge for
me, by *being* my reminder of the mature *and* proper duty of those
truly wise (hû-*k*îragânîkŏ), through the directions issuable by even
worldly decision, and of so many of which I have a remembrance <span
id="fr_361"></span>[3](#fn_359.md), for the writing of which *there would
be* no end. 64. Then the manifest power of the fiend among us below, and
the way provided by the creator for *his* becoming invisible *and his*
impotence are clear; so also the full power of the creator of the army
of angels, assuredly the procurers of success *in* the end, and <span
id="fr_362"></span>[4](#fn_360.md) the accomplishment all-powerfully--which
is his own advantage--of the completely-happy progress, for ever, of all
creations which are his creatures, are thereby visible *and* manifest;
*and* many tokens and signs *thereof* are manifestly clear.

65\. One is this, that the creator is *in* his own predestined
(bagdâ*d*akŏ) abode, and the fiend is

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

advancing *and has* rushed in, and his advancing is for the subjugation
of the creation <span id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_361.md).

66\. One, that the creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd* are spiritual *and* also
worldly, and that is no world of the fiend, but he gathers an evil
spiritual state into the world; *and* as among so many the greed of
success is only in one <span id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_362.md), so the
triumph is manifest of the good spirits *and* worldly beings over the
evil spirits.

67\. One is this, that *his* defeat in the end is manifest from his
contention and aggression (pê*s*za*d*ârîh); for the fiend is an
aggressor *in* an unlawful struggle; and leaving the army of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*--subsequently the lawful defender (lakhvârza*d*âr)--the
fiend of violence is a cause of power among those wholly unrequiting the
creator *in* the world <span id="fr_365"></span>[3](#fn_363.md). 68. If,
also, every time that he smites the creatures he is equally *and*
lawfully beaten once again, it is assuredly evident therefrom that, when
their beating *and* being beaten are *on* an equality together, *at*
first he whose hand *was* foremost *was* the smiter, and the backward
fighter was beaten; *but at* last that backward fighter is the smiter,
and the foremost fighter becomes beaten <span
id="fr_366"></span>[4](#fn_364.md); for when he is

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

beaten *in* the former combat, *there* is then a combat again, and his
enemy is beaten.

69\. One is this, that when the supply of weapons <span
id="fr_367"></span>[1](#fn_365.md), the fighting, and the ability of the
contenders are equal, the supply of weapons of him who is the beginner
(pê*s*î*d*âr) has always sooner disappeared, and, *at* last, he is
unarmed and his opponent re-mains armed; *and* an armed *man* is known
*to be* <span id="fr_368"></span>[2](#fn_366.md) victorious over him *who
is* unarmed, just as *one* fighting is triumphant over *one* not
fighting <span id="fr_369"></span>[3](#fn_367.md). 70. And a similitude of
it, which is *derived* from the world, is even such as when each ogle of
two furious *ones* (âr*d*ŏ) of equal strength, in a fight together, has
an arrow, and each one is in fear of the other's possession of an arrow;
*and* one of them alone shoots *his* arrow, and makes *it* reach *his*
opponent; then he is without an arrow, and his opponent, fully mindful
*of it*, has an arrow, and becomes fearless through possession of the
arrow, his own intrepidity, *and* the lack of arrows and complete terror
of that earlier shooter. 71. And as regards mighty deeds he is
successful; *and* though *there be* as much strength for the earlier
fighter a successful termination is undiscoverable *for him*; despoiled
of possession *by* him who is later, *and* ruined in that which is
all-powerful, *his* end *and* disappearance are undoubted, clear, *and*
manifest <span id="fr_370"></span>[4](#fn_368.md).

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

72\. One is this, that owing to the previous non-appearance of the
fiend, the coming forward of sickness and death unto the creatures of
the sacred beings *occurred* when the fiend rushed *in*, and he rendered
the existence of men sickly; he also destroyed *and* put to death the
progeny of animals. 73. Afterwards, through lawfully driving *him* away,
sickness and death *come* in turn (bârîkîhâ) unto the demons, *and* the
healthiness <span id="fr_371"></span>[1](#fn_369.md) of the righteous *and*
perfect life unto the creatures of the sacred beings, as its counterpart
is the great healthiness *which* comes, more rightly rising, unto the
creatures advised by the sacred beings, through united arrangement <span
id="fr_372"></span>[2](#fn_370.md). 74. And, in the end, a worldly
similitude of the sickness and grievous, complete death for the
fiends <span id="fr_373"></span>[3](#fn_371.md), and of the healthiness
*and* intrinsic (benaf*s*man-*k*îgûnîh) life for the creatures of the
sacred beings, is that which *occurs* when one of two litigants
(ham-patkâr), prematurely revengeful, gives to *his* fellow-litigant an
irritating poison, *and* himself eats wholesome flour before the later
litigant gives a poison, as an antidote, to the earlier litigant, *and*
himself eats the poison-subduing flour; after which he is cured *by* the
poison, and his enemy is dead through the poison of the later
flour <span id="fr_374"></span>[4](#fn_372.md).

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

75\. One is this, that Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the creator, is a manager with
omniscient wisdom, *and* the contention of the fiend of scornful looks
(tar nigîri*s*n) is through lust of defilement; of united power is the
management of that creator, as existing with (hamzîk) <span
id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_373.md) all the vigilance in the wisdom which is
in everything; and that united power is the strength of the management
of heaven. 76. And of much power is the contention of the fiend, as
*his* manifold changing of will--which is hostile to the will of even
his own creatures, and is through the weakness and exhausted <span
id="fr_376"></span>[2](#fn_374.md) strength of an evil nature--is the
contending power which forms his visible strength <span
id="fr_377"></span>[3](#fn_375.md).

77\. One is this, that is, on account of the fiend's contending
ill-advisedly, however strongly the contest is adapted for the damage of
his own fiendishness, and regret and bad consequences therefrom are
perceptible. 78. Such as the very paralyzing <span
id="fr_378"></span>[4](#fn_376.md) affliction which *was* appointed
(nîhâ*d*ŏ) by him

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

for the creatures of the world in putting the living to death, which he
ordered with violence and the hope that it *would* be *his* greatest
triumph. 79. Even that is what is so self-damaging to the same fiend
that, when he puts to death him who is wicked, and he who is wicked, who
is performing what is desirable for him (the fiend)--that performance of
what is desirable *being* the practice of sin--is useless *and* goes
thither where he is penitent of that seduction, the spirit <span
id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_377) of the owner (shah.md) of the sin, whose
soul is wicked <span id="fr_380"></span>[2](#fn_378.md), is righteous, in
whose worldly body exist the fetters of pain and darkness; and owing to
the unfettering of *its* hands *from* that pain it (the spirit) is far
*away*, and goes to heaven, which is the most fortified of fortresses.
80. Fearlessly it fights for it, even as the guardian spirit of Yim the
splendid <span id="fr_381"></span>[3](#fn_379.md) kept away all trouble
(vê*s*am), the guardian spirit of Frê*d*ûn kept away even those active
in vexing <span id="fr_382"></span>[4](#fn_380.md), *and* other guardian
spirits of those passed away are enumerated as *engaged* in the defeat
of many fiends.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

81\. One is this, that the most grievous severance that is owing to him
(the fiend) <span id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_381.md) is the production of
the mortality of the creatures, in which the afflicting (nîzgûn), demon
Astô-vîdâ*d* <span id="fr_384"></span>[2](#fn_382.md) is the head *of* the
many Mâzînîkân *demons* <span id="fr_385"></span>[3](#fn_383.md). 82. And
the propitious creator's developers *were* thus unprovoked (anârgônd)
when the only person, who is called Gâyômar*d* <span
id="fr_386"></span>[4](#fn_384.md), *was* destroyed by him, and came back
to the world *as* a man and a woman whose names were Marhayâ *and*
Marhîyôih <span id="fr_387"></span>[5](#fn_385.md); and the propagation and
connection of races *were* through their next-of-kin marriage of a
sister <span id="fr_388"></span>[6](#fn_386.md). 83. The unlucky <span
id="fr_389"></span>[7](#fn_387.md) fiend, while he

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

increased offspring and fortune for them through death, so uplifted
*his* voice in *their* presence, about the death of the living *ones* of
their offspring and lineage; that *together* with the unmeasured
destructiveness of the deadly evil spirit, and the unjust contention of
his through death and the conveyer of death <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_388.md), the sting also of birth *was* owing to
death. 84. The repetitions of the cry *were* many, so that the issue
(bâr) of thousands and thousands *of* myriads from those two persons,
and the multitude passed *away*, from a number *which* is limited and a
counterpart (aê*d*ûnŏîh) of the living people in the world, are
apparent; and for the annihilation of many fiends, through death, the
propitiousness of the contending power of the creator is clear *and*
manifest.

85\. One is this, that the most steadfast quality of the demon himself
is darkness, the evil of which is so complete that they shall call the
demons also those of a gloomy race. 86. *But* such is the power in the
arms *and* resources of the angels, that even the first gloomy darkness
in. the world is perpetually subdued by the one power really originating
with the sun *and* suitable *thereto, and* the world is
illuminated <span id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_389.md).

87\. One is this, that the most mischievous weapon of the demons is the
habit of self-deception which,

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

on account of rendering the soul wicked thereby, seemed to them as the
greatest triumph for themselves, *and* a complete disaster for the
angels. 88. In the great glory of the pure, true religion of the sacred
beings is as much strength as is adapted to the full power of the
lawlessness and much opposition of falsehood, *and* also to the fully
accurate (arsî*d*ŏ) speaking which is in itself an evidence of the true
speaking of every proper truth and no truth whatever is perverted by it.
89. And the false sayings are many, and good sayings--*their* opponents
through good statement--do not escape from their imperfect truth <span
id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_390.md); since a similitude of them is that
which *occurs* when, concerning that which is white-coloured, the whole
of the truthful speak about *its* white colour, *but as to* the liars
there are *some* who *speak of* its black colour, some of *its* mud
colour, some of *its* blue colour, some of *its* bran <span
id="fr_393"></span>[2](#fn_391.md) colour, some of *its* red colour, and
some of *its* yellow colour. 90. And every single statement of each of
the truthful is as much evidence, about those several colours of those
who are liars, as even the compiled sayings of the Abraham of the
Christians <span id="fr_394"></span>[3](#fn_392.md), which are the word of
*him* who is also called their Messiah <span
id="fr_395"></span>[4](#fn_393.md), about the

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Son of the
*Supreme* Being <span id="fr_396"></span>[1](#fn_394.md); thus, they
recount that the Son, who is not less than the Father, is himself He,
the Being whom they consider undying. 91. One falsehood they tell about
the same Messiah is that he died, and one falsehood they tell is that he
did not die; it is a falsehood for those who say he did not die, *and*
for those who say he did die; wherefore did he not die, when *he is* not
dead? *and* wherefore is it said he did not die, when he is mentioned as
dead <span id="fr_397"></span>[2](#fn_395.md)? 92. Even the compilation
itself is an opponent to its own words, for, though it said *he* is
dead, it spoke unto *one* not dead; and though *he* is not dead, it
spoke unto *one* dead. 93. The proper office (gâs) of a compiler and
mutilator <span id="fr_398"></span>[3](#fn_396.md)--through whose complete
attainments the demons of like power as to the force of truth are
strengthened, *and* the pure, good religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers
is itself dissipated and rendered useless for itself--is a habit
(dâ*d*ŏ) growing with

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

the fiend; and, as he is seen *to be* victorious who overturns reliance
on changeableness and similar powers, the final disruption of forces is
a disruption of peculiarities (khû*d*îh vishôpi*s*nŏ) <span
id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_397.md).

94: One is this, that is, even that prodigious devastation *of* which it
is declared that it happens through the rain of Malkôs <span
id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_398.md), when, through snow, immoderate cold,
*and* the unproductiveness of the world, most mortals die; *and* even
the *things* attainable by mortals are *attended* with threatenings of
scarcity. 95. Afterwards--*as* among the all-wise, preconcerted remedies
(pê*s* *k*ârîh) of the beneficent spirit <span
id="fr_401"></span>[3](#fn_399.md) such a remedy *was* established (and
nihâ*d* *k*âr) that *there is* one of the species of lands, that is
called 'the enclosure formed by

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yim <span
id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_400.md),' through which, by orders issued by Yim
the splendid *and* rich in flocks, the son of Vîvangha <span
id="fr_403"></span>[2](#fn_401.md), the world is again filled--men of the
best races, animals of good breeds, the loftiest trees, *and* most
savoury (khare*g*istânŏ) foods, *in* that manner came back miraculously
*for* the restoration of the world; which new men are *substituted* for
the former created beings, which is an upraising of the dead <span
id="fr_404"></span>[3](#fn_402.md). 96. Likewise from that miracle is
manifested the non-attainment of the evil spirit to the universal
control of the glory of the creator for every purpose.

97\. One is this, that--when the heterodox (dû*s*dînô) Dahâk <span
id="fr_405"></span>[4](#fn_403.md), on whom most powerful demons and fiends
in the shape of serpents are winged <span
id="fr_406"></span>[5](#fn_404.md), escapes from the fetters of Frê*d*ûn,
and, through witchcraft, remains a demon even to the demons <span
id="fr_407"></span>[6](#fn_405.md) *and* 

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

a destroyer--a mighty man *who* is roused <span
id="fr_408"></span>[1](#fn_406.md) up beforehand from the dead, *and* is
called Keresâsp the Sâmân <span id="fr_409"></span>[2](#fn_407.md), crushes
that fiendishness with a club *consisting* of a cypress tree, *and*
brings that Dahâk through wholesome fear to the just law of the sacred
beings <span id="fr_410"></span>[3](#fn_408.md).

98\. One is this, that these, which are *distinct* from those born *and*
the men who have laboured together, Astô-vîdâ*d* <span
id="fr_411"></span>[4](#fn_409.md) *has* not obtained, nor even *will*
obtain, for death; and through the power of immortals, and the action of
the good discourses (hû-sakhunagânîh) <span
id="fr_412"></span>[5](#fn_410.md), they urge on to the sacred beings
*those* who are inquiring (kâv-hômand), even to the immortality which is
the renovation of the other creatures. 99. One, *which is* where the
mingled conflict of the meeting *of good and evil occurs* <span
id="fr_413"></span>[6](#fn_411.md), is the glorious good-yielding *one* of
the creator which is guarded by purity, so that the fiend *has* not
attained to injuring *it*, since it is pronounced *to be* the uninjured
ox which is called Hadhayã*s* <span id="fr_414"></span>[7](#fn_412.md).
100. Also the long life which

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

is through its all-controlling power <span
id="fr_415"></span>[1](#fn_413.md) until they cause the end to occur, and
the devourers of fires are subdued by it--*besides* the whole strength
of the unboasting (a*k*ûm) creatures of the beneficent spirit, after
they live even without eating <span id="fr_416"></span>[2](#fn_414.md)--is
because of the Hôm that is white <span id="fr_417"></span>[3](#fn_415.md)
and the promoter (frâshm) of perfect glory, which possesses the
wholesomeness of the elixir of immortality, and through it the living
become ever-living. 101. And also as many more specially pure glorious
*ones* whose enumeration *would* be tedious <span
id="fr_418"></span>[4](#fn_416.md).

102\. One is this, that the struggle of the evil *one* and the demons
*with* the creatures is not precisely the existence of *various* kinds
of contest, but

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

by natural operation and through desire of deceit <span
id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_417). 103. And the demon of slander (spazg.md),
whose nature it is to make the indignation (zôhar) of the creatures pour
out, one upon the other, about nothing, as he does not succeed in making
*it* pour out among the righteous <span id="fr_420"></span>[2](#fn_418.md),
he makes the wicked even pour *it* out upon the wicked; *and* as he does
not succeed even in making *it* pour out among the wicked, he makes a
demon pour *it* out upon a demon. 104. The impetuous assailant, Wrath
(Aeshm), as he does not succeed in causing strife *among* the righteous,
flings discord *and* strife amid the wicked; *and* when he does not
succeed *as* to the strife even of the wicked, he makes the demons *and*
fiends fight together. 105. So also the demon of greediness (â*z*ŏ),
when he does not attain, in devouring, to that of the good, mounts <span
id="fr_421"></span>[3](#fn_419.md) by his own nature unto devouring that of
the demons. 106. So also the deadly Astô-vîdâ*d* <span
id="fr_422"></span>[4](#fn_420.md) is ever an antagonistic operator; when
*there* is no righteous *one* who is mortal, nor any creatures in the
world, the wicked dying *one* (mîrâk) rides to the fiends through a
death which is an antagonism of himself <span
id="fr_423"></span>[5](#fn_421.md).

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

107\. The means of the united forces <span
id="fr_424"></span>[1](#fn_422.md) are means such as the wise and the
high-priests *have* proclaimed, that is, at the time of the renovation
*of the universe* <span id="fr_425"></span>[2](#fn_423.md) *being* nigh,
when completion *has* come to generation--those who *were* provided
*being* born--and after they occasion freedom from generation
(azerkhûni*s*nîh), they cause men *and* animals to exist, though passed
*away and* dead. 108. All men, righteous and wicked, who continue in the
world *become* immortal, the men are righteous whom Astôvîdâ*d* does not
obtain for death by evil noosing (dû*s*-vadi*s*nŏ) <span
id="fr_426"></span>[3](#fn_424.md) from behind, and *who have* completely
attained to the rules of the sacred beings (yang-î ya*zd*ân); *and* the
soul of the wicked, which is repentant of deceit, turns back upon the
demons and fiends themselves all that previous violence of destruction
and perversion, contention and blinding <span
id="fr_427"></span>[4](#fn_425.md) which is natural to a demon, and they
fight, and strike, and tear, and cause to tear, and destroy among
themselves (benaf*s*man va*l* 

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

benaf*s*man) so long as they are in hell and numerous.

109\. The wicked who are penitent become courageous anew as to the demon
who perverts, the living occasion strength <span
id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_426.md), *and* the retribution of the hellish
existence of the wicked is completed, because the increase of sins <span
id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_427.md), owing to the sin which they committed,
ceases. 110. They are let out from hell, though their sins are thus
accumulated by the demons; they have also prepared <span
id="fr_430"></span>[3](#fn_428.md) the spirit of sin by the three days *in*
molten metal <span id="fr_431"></span>[4](#fn_429.md), which drives away
tears, as its name, is owing to the lessening of tears <span
id="fr_432"></span>[5](#fn_430.md), which is all <span
id="fr_433"></span>[6](#fn_431.md) in that which *occurs* when all the
doers of actions for the demon of falsehood <span
id="fr_434"></span>[7](#fn_432.md) pass through that preparation. 111. And
*he* who, *for* three days, thus bathes (vushakê*d*ŏ) his sins which are
owing to the fiend, and *has* destroyed the filth (*k*akhû) of the
accumulated sins, is like *those who* have passed off *and* turned over
a burden.

112\. And the impotence of sin is owing to the destroyer *of* the fiend
by the perception of light,

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

who was their creator <span id="fr_435"></span>[1](#fn_433); they (men.md)
all see all, they all forgive, and they all are powerful as regards all
*things* for the creator. 113. And, moreover, after the three days, when
they occur, all the creatures of the good creator are purified *and*
pure by the perfect washing passed through, by the most amazing
preparation ordained (bakhtŏ), *and* by the most complete account they
render complete. 114. And they are triumphant *over* the fiend through
their own weapons, through their own driving away *of* their own
littleness (kâsvî*d*ârîh), and the glory of the creator and that of the
angels and since he becomes exhausted in resources (dên *k*âr) they make
*him* become extinct.

115\. *But* previously <span id="fr_436"></span>[2](#fn_434.md) they are
attacked, and dispersed, and subdued, and this even fully painfully and
with complete experience; and they aid, through backward goodness, in
the antagonism of means which are separated divergently, through
scattered resources and subdued strength, like the life from the body of
worldly mortals, and this, moreover, confusedly, uselessly, and
unmovingly. 116. *But* the abode <span id="fr_437"></span>[3](#fn_435.md)
for the essential material existence (stî-î *k*îharîkŏ), about which
*there* is a seeking for interment <span
id="fr_438"></span>[4](#fn_436.md), is not powerless, and on enquiring the
wishes of such numbers <span id="fr_439"></span>[5](#fn_437.md) they have

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

cast *him* out; and no share whatever, *nor* fragment of a share, of
fiendishness, *nor* even so much as some morsel of unpardonableness sent
by fiendishness, remains in this light.

117\. Those who are righteous, intelligent through their own glory of
religion--which is a spirit <span id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_438.md) in the
form of light--are scattered (parvandag-aîtŏ) equally around the sky of
skies, when from every single side of it *there* arises, for the sake of
margin, three *times* as much *space* as the earth created by
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, in the preparation of the creatures which *were* created
by him. 118. Through his own will he again constructs the bodies of the
evil creation, unlaboriously, easily, and full-gloriously, though their
construction is even from the clay of Aûshdâ*s*târ <span
id="fr_441"></span>[2](#fn_439.md), and their moisture is from the purified
water of Arekdvisûr <span id="fr_442"></span>[3](#fn_440.md) the undefiled.
119. And from that which is a good protector *through* him, and which is
also connected *with* 

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

*him*, even from the Hadhayã*s* ox <span
id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_441.md), is the strength of everlasting welfare
(vêhgarîh) *and* immortality; and the living are again produced for the
body, they have immortal life, *and* they become hungerless *and*
thirstless, undecaying *and* undying, undistressed and undiseased,
ever-living *and* ever-beneficial.

120\. After the renovation *of the universe there* is no demon, because
*there* is no deceit; and no fiend, because there is no falsity; *there*
is no evil spirit (angraminô), because there is no destruction; *there*
is no hell, because there is no wickedness; *there* is no strife,
because there is no anger; *there* is no hatred, because there is no
ill-temper (dazîh); *there* is no pain, because there is no disease.
121. *There* is also no Dahâk <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_442.md),
because there is no fear; *there* is no want, because there is no
greediness; *there* is no shame, because there is no deformity; *there*
is no falsehood <span id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_443.md), because there is
no desire of falsehood; *there* is no heterodoxy, because there are no
false statements; and *there* is no tardiness, because *it speaks* of a
dilatory (*s*ustŏ) race in that which is said thus: '*They are* all
those of evil thoughts, of evil words, of evil deeds, a race of all
evils to be made to tear by the evil spirit.'

122\. And on his (the demon's) disappearance every evil has disappeared,
on the disappearance of evil every good is perfected, and in the time
of. complete goodness it is not possible to occasion (andâkhtanŏ) any
pain *or* distress whatever, by any means, to any creature. 123. Those
who are present (nunak) sufferers <span id="fr_446"></span>[4](#fn_444.md),
when *there* is a blow of

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

a fist on the body, or the point of a nail (têkh bûrâk) is driven into a
limb, are pained on account of the combination (ham-dâ*d*akîh) of a
different nature for the purposes of the fiend in the body. 124. *But*
at that time of no complication (aham-yâkhtîh), when a limb is struck
upon a limb, or even such *a thing* as a knife, *or* sword, *or* club,
*or* stone, *or* arrow reaches the body, *there* is no pain *or*
discomfort whatever corresponding to that present pain. 125. And at that
time one consideration (vusî*d*-aê) occurs, for now the pain from that
beating *and* striking is always owing to that different nature, and on
account of *their being* suitable *to it*, but at that time everything
*being* of like nature and like formation *there* is never *any*
distress.

126\. And in that most happy time they let the sun, moon, and luminaries
exist, but *there* is no need for a return of the day and a removal of
*its going* forth (frâshm) <span id="fr_447"></span>[1](#fn_445.md), for
the world is a dispenser (vakhtâr) of all light, and all creatures, too,
are brilliant; those luminaries also become as it were perfectly
splendid *for* them. 127. And every creature, too, is of like will and
like power; whichever *were* mortals, unenvious of the welfare of all
creatures, are alike joyous, and that *share* of their position and
pleasure rejoices *them* which has come to them from the glory of all
*the existences and* capabilities of him, the all-good, who is aware of
all of everything through his own perfect persistence *and* complete
resources.

128\. And he allots, to the doers of good works

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

and the suitable ranks, the power of a judge (da*d*akŏ), wealthiness,
goodness, and the directorship (ra*d*îh) of *what* is intended. 129. *He
is* the designer of *what* is intended, as it is said about his
creatures and capability that fire is producing wind, fire is producing
water, and fire is producing earth; wind is producing fire, wind is
producing water, and wind is producing earth; water is producing fire,
water is producing wind, and water is producing earth; earth is
producing fire, earth is producing wind, and earth is producing water.
130. The spirit is both the cause of spirit and the cause of matter
(stî*s*); and the cause of matter, too, is also the cause of spirit,
through that perpetual capability.

131\. And, moreover, all the angels, the souls, and the guardian spirits
are attending to the wishes *of* the glory of the creator and the
commands of the creator, without trouble *and* fully rejoicing, in
likeness unto the forms of seas, rivers, mountains, trees, and
waters <span id="fr_448"></span>[1](#fn_446.md); and they have comforted
and decorated the creation. 132. And the angels, souls, and guardian
spirits, themselves also the constituted spirits of a former contact
with life, are thereby pleased *and* rejoiced; eternal *and* thoroughly
prepared they are naturalised in that complete joy.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_265"></span>[81:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_266.md) This last clause is
omitted in M14 and J.

<span id="fn_266"></span>[82:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_267.md) The interval
between the first appearance and the final disappearance of the evil
spirit. Twelve thousand years are supposed to elapse between the first
creation and the resurrection; during the first three (about B.C.
8400--5400) the creation remains undisturbed in a spiritual state,
during the next three (B.C. 5400--2400) the evil spirit appears, but
flies back to hell in confusion, during the next three (B.C. 2400--A.D.
600) he attacks the creation and keeps it in a constant state of
tribulation, and during the last three (A.D. 600--3600) his power,
having attained its maximum, is gradually weakened till it is finally
destroyed at the resurrection (see Bd. I, 8, 18, 20, 22, III, I, XXXIV,
I--9, Byt. III, II, 44, 52, 61, 62).

<span id="fn_267"></span>[82:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_268.md) Probably 'the
fiend,' but the sentence is by no means clear.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[82:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_269.md) As the verbs
'allow' in § 12 and 'accept' in § 13 are both plural we must understand
that the opposition to the fiend arises from the spiritual creatures of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and not from Aûha*r*ma*zd* alone.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[82:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_270.md) Reading minishnŏ
instead of maînôgânŏ, 'spirits;' the difference between these words in
Pahlavi being only a single stroke.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[83:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_271.md) Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[83:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_272.md) The fiend's.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[83:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_273.md) Reading vêhîkânakŏ
vakhshi*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[83:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_274.md) Assuming that
andarmûnîh is a form analogous to pirâmûnîh, and with the meaning of
andarûnîh.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[83:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_275.md) The light.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[84:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_276.md) That is, they are
altogether different from the faults of the fiend, just recounted.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[84:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_277.md) Perhaps the same as
'the spirit of wisdom' of Mkh.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[84:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_278.md) Reading lâ, 'not,'
instead of râi, 'on account of.'

<span id="fn_278"></span>[85:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_279.md) The words va
avi*g*âftŏ afzârîhâ are omitted in M14 and J.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[85:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_280.md) The evil, spirit.
As the co-existent spirits of good and evil are antagonistic the word
ham-bu*d*ikŏ, 'co-existent,' is often supposed to mean 'antagonistic.'

<span id="fn_280"></span>[85:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_281.md) See § 16. M14 and J
have only 'that occur through his falsity and the constant terror of
light which would have arisen from him.'

<span id="fn_281"></span>[85:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_282.md) That the term asar
has only its etymological meaning 'endless,' and not the wider sense of
'eternal,' is clear from this phrase. The 'endless light' is the phrase
used in Pahlavi to express Av. anaghra rao*ka*u, a term implying 'the
fixed stars,' so the passage in the text is very suggestive of the
phrase, 'he made the stars also' (Gen. i. 16).

<span id="fn_282"></span>[85:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_283.md) Instead of gun*g*,
'space,' we might read *g*an*g*, 'treasury,' <span id="page_87">p.
87</span> but it is written gûn*g* in Chap. XXXI, 24, according to K35,
and the meaning 'space' is more appropriate to the gâtu*s* *hv*adhâtô,
'self-sustained place,' of Vend. XIX, 122. The epithet
'constantly-beneficial' is a Pahl. translation of Av. misvâna, and is
evidently applied here to the unlimited heavenly space contained in the
endless light' (see § 24) and including the supreme heaven, as appears
from the order in which these three existences (the earliest creations
of Aûha*r*ma*zd*) are mentioned in Chap. XXXI, 24.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[86:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_284.md) M14 and J have
'separate doers.'

<span id="fn_284"></span>[86:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_285.md) M14 and J have
'doers at different times.'

<span id="fn_285"></span>[87:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_286.md) Bd. III, 26 says
that 'the rampart of the sky was formed so that the adversary should not
be able. to mingle with it.'

<span id="fn_286"></span>[87:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_287.md) Reading âgûra*z*ênd
va*l* ase*g* gûn.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[87:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_288.md) Assuming that va*l*
stands for valman or valman*s*ân.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[88:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_289.md) Probably referring
to the five fiends, or demonesses, which are the special embodiments of
each man's evil passions, and are thus detailed in Mkh. XLI,
9-11:--'That man is the stronger who is able to contend with his own
fiends, and who keeps these five fiends, in particular, far from *his*
body, which are such as avarice, wrath, lust, disgrace, and discontent.'

<span id="fn_289"></span>[88:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_290.md) Reading
fî*s*ar*d*akŏ, but the word is doubtful. This central region of the sky
would seem to be the place of the 'ever-stationary,' if it do not
include the earth itself, which is not quite clear, owing to the obscure
style of the author.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[88:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_291.md) While in the world.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[88:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_292.md) The beneficent and
evil spirits.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[88:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_293.md) Reading venâpênd,
but the word is doubtful.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[89:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_294.md) Below the sun,
moon, and stars which protect the creatures.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[89:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_295.md) Literally
'springers back.'

<span id="fn_295"></span>[89:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_296.md) Reading dâmîkŏ, but
the word is unusual; it might be read dahmîkô, 'of the holy man,' or be
considered a corruption of damîkŏ, 'earth.'

<span id="fn_296"></span>[89:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_297.md) Reading rangmânŏ,
but the word is doubtful.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[89:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_298.md) Five folios of text
are here interpolated in J, of which four contain the passage (Ep. II,
vi, 4--ix, 7) omitted at the end of that MS., and the fifth contains a
passage on the same subject as Ep. III, and which may possibly be part
of the text missing in Ep. III, r 1.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[89:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_299.md) Meaning that the
unembodied spirits of men should enter upon their worldly existence.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[89:7](sbe18044.htm#fr_300.md) The great-grandson
of the primeval man, Gâyômar*d*, and the forefather of the fifteen races
of undeformed human beings (see Bd. XV, 25-31, XXXI, 1).

<span id="fn_300"></span>[90:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_301.md) See Chap. II, 10
for this and the following three names.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[90:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_302.md) He is said to have
kept the evil spirit thirty years as a steed (see Râm Yt. 12, Zamyâ*d*
Yt. 29, Mkh. XXVII, 22).

<span id="fn_302"></span>[90:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_303.md) Here written *G*îm.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[90:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_304.md) Instinctive wisdom
and that acquired by experience (see Chap. XL, 3).

<span id="fn_304"></span>[90:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_305.md) Av. Manu*sk*ithra;
the descendant of Frê*d*ûn, in the eleventh generation, who overthrew
the usurpation of the collateral branches of his family, and restored
the Irânian line of the Pê*s*dâdian dynasty in his own person (see Bd.
XXXI, 12-14, XXXIV, 6).

<span id="fn_305"></span>[90:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_306.md) See Chap. XVII, 6.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[90:7](sbe18044.htm#fr_307.md) Av. Kavi Kavâta;
the first king of the Kayânian dynasty (see Bd. XXXI, 24, 25, XXXIV, 7).

<span id="fn_307"></span>[90:8](sbe18044.htm#fr_308.md) Probably the Av.
Aoshnara, mentioned in Af. Zarat., along with several of the other
names, in a passage somewhat similar to that in our text. The name here
can also be read Aûsh-khûr.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[90:9](sbe18044.htm#fr_309.md) Av. Kavi
Syâvarshân; the son of king Kaî-Kâûs and father of king Kaî-Khûsrôî, but
he did not reign himself. He is said to have formed the settlement of
Kangde*z* (see Chap. XC, 5, Bd. XXXI, 25, Byt. III, 25, 26).

<span id="fn_309"></span>[90:10](sbe18044.htm#fr_310.md) See Chap. XXXVI,
3.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[90:11](sbe18044.htm#fr_311.md) Av.. Kavi
Vî*s*tâspa, Pers. Gu*s*tâsp; the fifth king of the Kayânian dynasty, who
received the religion from Zaratû*s*t. His father, the fourth king, was
of collateral descent from the first king (see Bd. XXXI, 28, 29, XXXIV,
7).

<span id="fn_311"></span>[90:12](sbe18044.htm#fr_312.md) The great apostle
of the Parsis (see Chap. II, 10).

<span id="fn_312"></span>[90:13](sbe18044.htm#fr_313.md) Av. Peshôtanu; a
son of Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp, who is said to be <span id="page_91">p. 91</span>
immortal and to live in Kangde*z*, whence he is to come to restore the
religion in the millennium of Hûshê*d*ar (see Chap. XC, 3, 5, Bd. XXIX,
5, Byt. III, 25-32, 36-38, 41, 42).

<span id="fn_313"></span>[91:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_314.md) Probably the
supreme high-priest and prime minister of the ninth Sasanian king,
Shâpûr II (A.D. 309--379; see Bd. XXXIII, 3).

<span id="fn_314"></span>[91:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_315.md) See Chap. II, 10
for thee, last three names. The terms mânsarîk, 'liturgical,' dâ*d*îk,
'legal,' and gâsânîk, 'metrical,' are those applied to the three
divisions of the twenty-one Nasks, or books of the complete literature
of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[91:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_316.md) M14 and J have
merely 'granted assistance in the struggle at the renovation.'

<span id="fn_316"></span>[91:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_317.md) Assuming that
gha*l* stands for valman, as it sometimes does.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[92:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_318.md) M14 and J have
merely: 'are a succession in adversity and perpetuity of life.'

<span id="fn_318"></span>[92:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_319.md) Assuming that
tarâ*z* stands for tarâ*z*ûk. The meaning is that any one who has
successfully struggled with sin in the world, and leaves offspring
behind him, goes to his account, at the balance of the angel Rashnû,
with cheerfulness.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[92:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_320.md) This seems to be a
variation of the statement in Byt. II, 13, where Zaratû*s*t, after
asking for immortality, and having had the omniscient wisdom infused
into him for a week, describes what he had seen, and amongst other
things says: 'I saw a wealthy *man* without children, and it did not
seem to me commendable; and I <span id="page_93">p. 93</span> saw a
pauper with many children, and it seemed to me commendable.'

<span id="fn_320"></span>[93:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_321.md) The Av. âsna
frazai*n*ti*s*, 'inherent or natural offspring,' of Yas. LIX, 14, &c.
The Pahl. equivalents âsnû*d*ak and âsnî*d*ak can hardly be mere
transliterations of âsna, but are more probably translations, formed of
â+*s*unu*d*ak and *s*inî*d*ak, with some such meaning as 'assured.'

<span id="fn_321"></span>[93:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_322.md) These three future
apostles (see Chap. II, 10) are considered to be sons of Zaratû*s*t (see
Bd. XXXII, 8).

<span id="fn_322"></span>[93:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_323.md) Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[93:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_324.md) These first four
demons are described in Bd. XXVIII, 7, 15-17, 23, 26.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[93:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_325.md) The words
nîyaî*z*înâkŏ tangîh bû*d*ŏ bakhtŏ, here translated, may possibly be a
miswriting of five names of demons.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[93:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_326.md) The bad Vâê (see
Chap. XXX, 4).

<span id="fn_326"></span>[93:7](sbe18044.htm#fr_327.md) See Bd. XXVIII, 25.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[93:8](sbe18044.htm#fr_328.md) A demon of death
(see Chap. XXIII, 3, note, Bd. XXVIII, 35).

<span id="fn_328"></span>[93:9](sbe18044.htm#fr_329.md) Another demon of
death (see Chap. XXXII, 4, 7).

<span id="fn_329"></span>[93:10](sbe18044.htm#fr_330.md) The mountainous
country south of the Caspian, said to be full of demons, the Mâzainya
daêva of the Avesta (see Bd. III, Lo, XV, 28). These demons were, no
doubt, merely idolators.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[94:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_331.md) See § 28.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[94:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_332.md) By omitting a
stroke nô*s*, 'agreeable,' would become vêh, 'good.'

<span id="fn_332"></span>[94:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_333.md). The sole-created,
or primeval ox, whence all animals are said to have sprung. For an
account of this incursion of the fiend, see Bd. III, 12-20, VIII, 1, Zs.
II, 1-11.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[94:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_334.md) M14 and J have
'even to the upper sky of the middle third,' which means the same thing,
as the author's words imply that the demons did not enter the upper
third, but only reached its borders (see § 49).

<span id="fn_334"></span>[94:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_335.md) M14 and J conclude
the sentence as follows: 'the pure religion, solving doubts, is
arrayed.'

<span id="fn_335"></span>[94:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_336.md) Reading vandvar
Pêrvakŏ. The author seems to have been thinking of Yas. IX, 81: Ma*zd*a
brought to thee the star-studded, spirit-fashioned girdle (the belt of
Orion) leading the Pleiades; the good Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion'
(Haug's Essays, p. 182).

<span id="fn_336"></span>[95:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_337.md) Or, zôharakŏ may
mean 'venomous.' Mîtôkht was the first demon produced by the evil spirit
(see Bd. I, 24, XXVIII, 14, 16) who is supposed to be as much 'the
father of lies' as his counterpart, the devil of the Christians.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[95:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_338.md) Or, zôhar may mean
'venom.'

<span id="fn_338"></span>[95:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_339.md) Mîtôkht.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[95:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_341.md) See § 44.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[95:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_342.md) See Chap. XXIII, 3.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[95:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_343.md) See Bd. XXVIII, 27.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[95:7](sbe18044.htm#fr_344.md) Reading pê*s*
ti*s*nŏ-î sagak nô*s*ânînî*d*anŏ, but we might read pê*s* ti*s*nŏg
sedkûni*s*nînî*d*anŏ, 'causing gnawing before being thirsty.'

<span id="fn_343"></span>[95:8](sbe18044.htm#fr_345.md) See § 44 for this
demon and the next two.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[96:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_346.md) One of the seven
arch-fiends, the Av. Zairi*k*a, which probably means 'decay,' but from
the resemblance of his name to zâhar, 'poison,' he is called 'the maker
of poison' (see Bd. I, 27, XXVIII, II).

<span id="fn_345"></span>[96:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_347.md) See Bd. XXVIII, 26.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[96:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_348.md) Reading gadman bîm,
but it may be yadman bîm, 'dreading the hand;' and it is doubtful
whether the epithet be applied to Nîyâ*z*, or to Nihîv.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[96:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_349.md) Reading î instead
of the va, 'and,' of the MSS.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[96:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_350.md) See § 44.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[96:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_351.md) See § 50.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[97:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_352.md) Reading
paitîyârakŏ, but K35 and J have paîtâ*z*ârakŏ, which, if it be a real
word; would have nearly the same meaning.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[97:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_353.md) Shooting stars,
meteors, and comets, the last of which are apparently intended by the
term Mû*s*par (Av. Mû*s* pairika, 'the Mû*s* witch') of Bd. V, 1,
XXVIII, 44.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[97:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_354.md) That is, the
luminaries which have to prevent these beings from becoming obscured by
the darkness produced by the evil spirits.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[97:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_355.md) By the omission of
one loop the MSS. have ya*zd*ânŏ, 'angels,' instead of shêdânŏ,
'demons;' the difference between the two words being very slight in
Pahlavi characters.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[98:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_356.md) Reading an-âyin
gun, but this is uncertain.

<span id="fn_355"></span>[98:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_357.md) Reading
*k*îhar-tanû nîzah; the last word is usually spelt nîzak, but occurs in
§ 58 in the same form as here.

<span id="fn_356"></span>[98:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_358.md) Reading nîvîkânmank
gûn, but this is uncertain.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[99:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_359.md) The unorthodox, or
those holding erroneous views regarding the traditions handed down by
them.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[99:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_360.md) Reading
âf*r*în.î*d*ŏ, which K 35 has converted into afgônê*d*ŏ, 'casts,' by
inverting the order of the two central characters.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[99:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_361.md) M14 and J omit the
words from 'through' to 'remembrance.' The author means that he has
acquired much information on the subject even from the opinions of the
unorthodox judiciously studied.

<span id="fn_360"></span>[99:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_362.md) M14 has merely the
words: 'and the completely-happy progress,' &c.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[100:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_363.md) K35 has altered
dakhshakŏ, 'token,' into dahi*s*nŏ, 'creation,' by changing one letter,
and M14 and J have adopted the wrong reading.

<span id="fn_362"></span>[100:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_364.md) Reading *k*îgûn
dên hâvandîh *k*îr â*z* dên khadûkŏ. The drift of these two first
reasons seems to be that the fiend, being an invader and outnumbered,
must. be vanquished in the end.

<span id="fn_363"></span>[100:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_365.md) Reading zak-î zôr
drû*g*ô dên-i dâ*d*âr ba*r*â-atô*g*îgânŏ-î stî*s* vahânŏ-î
nirûkŏ-hômandîh. This phrase seems to have been generally misunderstood
by copyists, as both M14 and J have altered it into something like:
'when the violence of the fiend is in the hand of the creator, yet even
if the motive of the army is so much power.'

<span id="fn_364"></span>[100:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_366.md) M14 and J omit
this clause, from 'but' to 'beaten.'

<span id="fn_365"></span>[101:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_367.md) The term zênô
afzâr evidently refers here to the warrior's stock of arrows and other
missiles which were to be expended in battle, so that it is analogous to
the modern term 'ammunition:

<span id="fn_366"></span>[101:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_368.md) M14 has
yehevûnê*d*, 'becomes,' instead of dânôstŏ, 'known.'

<span id="fn_367"></span>[101:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_369.md) M14 and J omit
these last four words.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[101:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_370.md) The argument, both
in this case and the preceding one, is that even when two combatants are
equal in power and resources the hasty aggressor is likely to be beaten
in the end, and, therefore, <span id="page_102">p. 102</span> the
inferiority of the fiend is still more likely to lead to his final
defeat.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[102:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_371.md) M14 begins a fresh
argument here, owing to some misunderstanding of the meaning of the
sentence.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[102:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_372.md) That is, the
advantage of driving away the fiend in this life is a counterpart of the
blessings attained at the resurrection.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[102:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_373.md) The word
drû*g*ânŏ, 'fiends,' is omitted in K35, but is evidently necessary to
complete the sentence.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[102:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_374.md) This appears to be
a description of ordeal by poison and the two usual modes of evading its
operation: The hasty evader relies upon deceitfully substituting a
wholesome, powder for the <span id="page_103">p. 103</span> poison he
has to take; while the more cautious evader trusts to recognising his
adversary's poison by its taste, and selecting another poison as an
antidote for both to take, so that the hasty evader suffers through his
own deceit in not taking the first poison. Similarly, the fiend is
supposed to suffer in the end from the death and destruction which he
was the first to introduce into the world.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[103:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_375.md) By omitting a
phrase M14 and J have: 'and the management of the fiend of scornful
looks is as *it were* existing with,' &c.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[103:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_376.md) This is little
more than a guess at the meaning of a word which can be read vashakî*d*ŏ
(compare Pers. ga*s* and ka*s*îdan). The whole sentence is rather
uncertain.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[103:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_377.md) The argument is
that this unstable power of the fiend cannot permanently stand against
the consolidated strength of the creator.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[103:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_378.md) Adopting J's
reading samakgûntar, but K35 has vasmakgûntar, which may be 'very
troublesome,' and M14 has samkîntar, probably for sahmgîntar, 'very
terrible.'

<span id="fn_377"></span>[104:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_379.md) That is, the
guardian spirit (see Chap. II, 5) which is not rendered wicked by the
sin of the soul.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[104:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_380.md) The phrase mûn
rûbân-î zak darvand is ambiguous, as it might mean 'which is the soul of
that wicked one,' but this is not reconcile able with the context.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[104:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_381.md) See Chap. II, 10.
Yim-î shê*d*ô is the Yimô khshaêtô of Vend. II, 43, 45, the Jamshêd of
the Shâhnâmah. The legends here referred to are mentioned in Fravar*d*în
Yt. 130-138, where the guardian spirit of Yima is said to withstand the
misfortune brought on by the demons, while that of Thraêtaona (Frê*d*ûn)
withstands various diseases, and those of other heroes withstand various
other evils and demons.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[104:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_382.md) Reading pavan
bêsh-i*k* ka*rd*ârân, but for i*k* we ought probably to read a*z*, so as
to make the phrase correspond to the Av. a*z*i-kar*s*tahê *d*baeshanghô
of Fravar*d*în Yt. 131.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[105:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_383.md) Instead of zî*s*
madam, 'that is owing to him,' we ought probably to read zî*s* bar,
'that is his production;' the Huz. madam, which is the proper equivalent
of the preposition bar, 'on, according to,' being wrongly used for the
noun bar, 'produce.'

<span id="fn_382"></span>[105:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_384.md) See § 44.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[105:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_385.md) The Mâzainya daêva
of the Avesta (see § 44, note).

<span id="fn_384"></span>[105:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_386.md) The sole-created,
or primeval, man from whom the whole human race is said to have sprung
(see Chap. II, 10, Bd. III, 14. 77, 19-23, XV, I, 31).

<span id="fn_385"></span>[105:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_387.md) The progenitors of
the undeformed human race, who are said to have grown up, in the manner
of a plant, from the seed of the dead Gâyômar*d* (see Bd. XV, 2-5).
Their names are derived from Av. mashya mashyôi, 'the man and woman,'
but the latter form is no longer extant in the Avesta. From Av. mashya
we have the Mashya of Bd. XV, 6, and the Mâshya of Bd. XV, II, 19, 20,
30. From its dialectical variant martiya in ancient Pers., which would
be marethya in the Avesta (compare Av. mareta, Pers. mard), we have the
Marhayâ of our text. And by transposition of the letters rt = reth = rha
in these latter forms, we have the Matrô of Bd. XV, 2 and the Maharîh or
Maharyâ of Bd. XV, 22, note. Other forms of these names also occur (see
Chaps. LXIV, 2, LXV, 2, LXXVII, 4).

<span id="fn_386"></span>[105:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_388.md) M14 has 'of
brother and sister,' but the insertion of the extra word is unnecessary.
Regarding khvêtudâ*d*, or next-of-kin marriage, see Chap. LXV.

<span id="fn_387"></span>[105:7](sbe18044.htm#fr_389.md) Reading
lâ-khâ*g*astŏ; the fiend is certainly 'unlucky' here, <span
id="page_106">p. 106</span> as by introducing death into the world he
merely increases the number of beings who pass into the other world to
join his opponents in the end; but the text probably means that he is
'inauspicious' and wishes to bring misfortune on mankind.

<span id="fn_388"></span>[106:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_390.md) Astô-vîdâ*d* (see
§ 81).

<span id="fn_389"></span>[106:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_391.md) The argument is
that, as the sun is able to subdue darkness, the most constant quality
of the fiend, every day, it is probable that the fiend himself will be
entirely subdued in the end.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[107:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_392.md) Assuming that
apûrâstîh stands for apûr râstîh; it may, however, be intended for
a*v*î-râstîh, 'want of truth.' The meaning is that even true statements
become perverted by inaccurate speakers.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[107:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_393.md) Perhaps sapû*s*ag,
'bran,' may have originally been sapzag, 'green.'

<span id="fn_392"></span>[107:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_394.md) Written Abrêhâm-î
Tarsâkîgân.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[107:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_395.md) The letter *s* in
Ma*s*îkhâ is here written like âî, but the word is correctly written in
§ 91.

<span id="fn_394"></span>[108:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_396.md) The phrase is
ba*r*manŏ-î dâ*d*, literally 'son of the created one,' unless we assume
that dâ*d* is taken as a name of God. It is, however, quite conceivable
that a priest would be reluctant to admit that a strange god could be
anything better than a created being. That dâ*d* is here used as a noun,
and not with the meaning of 'gift' or 'law,' appears from the subsequent
phrase dâ*d*ŏ-î amîrâkŏ yakhsenund, 'the created one whom they consider
undying.'

<span id="fn_395"></span>[108:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_397.md) Owing to the
frequent repetitions of the same words in these phrases they are
specially liable to corruption by copyists, but as they stand in K35
they can hardly be translated otherwise than as questions. M14 and J
have an altered text which may be translated as follows:--'for whomever
he did not die, when dead, he is as dead; for whomever it is said he
died, he is so when he is mentioned as dead;' but this seems no
improvement of the text.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[108:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_398.md) Referring to those
who compile commentaries and mutilate texts to suit their own views.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[109:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_399.md) The argument is
that even heterodoxy, 'the most mischievous weapon' of the fiend (see §
87), must fail in the end, because, like other revolutions, it relies on
constant change, which implies want of permanency.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[109:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_400.md) Malkôsânâ, 'of
Malkôs,' is a denominative adjective derived from Chald. ‏ו
םַ?Lְ?Q?Wֹסה‎ 'autumnal rain.' The deluging rain of Malkôs is supposed
to usher in the dreadful winter foretold to Yima in Vend. II, 46-56,
when all, or nearly all, living creatures were to perish, a truly
glacial epoch. In a Persian paraphrase of the Bahman Vast (see Byt.
Introd. p. lix) this period of Malkôs is described as follows:--'As
three hundred years have elapsed from the time of Hûshê*d*ar (Byt. III,
44-49) the period of Malkôs comes on; and the winter of. Malkôs is, such
that, owing to the cold and snow which occur, out of a myriad of men in
the world only one will remain, and the trees and shrubs all become
withered, and the quadrupeds, whether carrying, walking, leaping, or
grazing, will all utterly die. Then, by command of God, they will come
from the enclosure formed by Vim, and the men and quadrupeds from that
place spread over Irân, and make the world populous a second time, and
it is the beginning of the millennium of Hûshê*d*ar(-mâh).'

<span id="fn_399"></span>[109:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_401.md) The formation of
the enclosure was ordered, as a precaution by Aûha*r*ma*zd* (see Vend.
II, 61-92).

<span id="fn_400"></span>[110:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_402.md) Reading Yim-ka*rd*
var, but these words are corrupted in three different ways in the three
MSS. consulted. This enclosure is said to have been in the middle of
Pârs in Bd. XXIX, 14.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[110:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_403.md) Av. Vivangh*a*u
(see Bd. XXXI, 2).

<span id="fn_402"></span>[110:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_404.md) That is, a type of
the resurrection.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[110:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_405.md) The Av. A*z*i
Dahâka, 'destructive serpent,' slain by Thraêtaona. In later times he
was converted into a usurping king, or dynasty, the Dha‘h‘hâk of the
Shâhnâmah, who conquered Yim (Jamshêd) and, after a reign of a thousand
years, was defeated by Frê*d*ûn (Thraêtaona) and fettered under Mount
Dimâvand; whence he is to escape during the millennium of Hûshê*d*ar-mâh
to devastate the world, till he is finally slain by the hero Keresâsp,
who is revived for the purpose (see Bd. XXIX, 8, g, XXXI, 6, Byt. III,
56-60.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[110:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_406.md) That is, attached
to the shoulders like wings; referring to the serpents said to have
grown from the shoulders of Dahâk.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[110:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_407.md) M14 alters shêdân,
'demons,' into gêhân, 'world,' so as to read 'through the demon of
witchcraft remains a destroyer unto the world.' The alteration in the
Pahlavi text is small, but seems unnecessary.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[111:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_408.md) Reading
angê*z*ŏî-aîtŏ, instead of the unintelligible angî*d*î-aîtŏ.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[111:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_409.md) See Chap. XVII, 6.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[111:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_410.md) Dahâk and all
other heinous offenders are said to undergo a special punishment for
three nights at the resurrection, and are then finally purified by
passing through molten metal like the rest of mankind (see Bd. XXX, 16,
20).

<span id="fn_409"></span>[111:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_411.md) See § 44.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[111:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_412.md) Perhaps referring
to the liturgical recitations.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[111:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_413.md) In the atmosphere
apparently (see Bd. I, 4).

<span id="fn_412"></span>[111:7](sbe18044.htm#fr_414.md) Written Hadhayãm
here, but Hadhayă*s* in § 119, Chaps. XLVIII, 34, XC, 4, and Hadhayô*s*
or Hadhayâv*s* in Bd. XIX, 13, XXX, 25, though always in Pâzand. It is
also called Sarsaok, or Srisaok, in Bd. XV, 27, XVII, 4, XIX, 13, always
in Pâzand, and his name is converted into Pahl. Srûvô in Zs. XI, 10.
<span id="page_112">p. 112</span> It is said to be an ox which never
dies till it is slaughtered at the resurrection, so that its fat may
form one of the ingredients of the elixir of immortality which all men
have then to taste; it is also said that mankind, in ancient times,
crossed the ocean on its back, when going to settle in the other regions
of the earth. From what is stated in the text it may be supposed to be
some form of cloud myth, but it is not mentioned in the extant portion
of the Avesta, unless 'the ox Hadhayô*s*' be taken as a corruption of
gâu*s* hudh*a*u, 'the well-yielding ox,' and Sarsaok as connected with
Pers. sri*s*k,' a drop,' and referring to showers of rain; but this is
very uncertain.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[112:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_415.md) The power of the
white Hôm mentioned below.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[112:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_416.md) As, it is said,
they will do for ten years before Sôshâns, the last apostle, appears to
prepare for the resurrection (see Chap. XXXV, 3, Bd. XXX, 3).

<span id="fn_415"></span>[112:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_417.md) A tree said to
grow in the ocean, the juice of which is the other ingredient of the
elixir of immortality; it is also called Gôkarn, or Gôkar*d*, Av.
gaokerena, and is guarded by ten enormous fish (see Bd. XVIII, 1-3,
XXVII, 4, XXX, 25).

<span id="fn_416"></span>[112:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_418.md) The existence of
such immortal creatures; said to be intended for special use at the
resurrection, is here taken as a proof of the reality of the
resurrection itself. Whether the seven immortals described in Chap. XC
are to be included among them is uncertain.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[113:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_419.md) That is, the
demons do not come into personal conflict with material creatures, but
are supposed to influence their evil passions and to pervert the
original laws of nature.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[113:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_420.md) M14 omits the
passage from this word to the same word in § 104.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[113:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_421.md) The word
sôbârê*d*ŏ, 'rides, mounts,' both here and in § 10b, is possibly only a
miswriting of the very similar word dûbârê*d*ŏ, 'runs, rushes.' Several
words in this sentence are accidentally omitted in M14.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[113:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_422.md) See § 44.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[113:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_423.md) As it is uncertain
whether the 'dying *one*' is a human being or the demon himself, it is
doubtful which of them is here supposed to commit suicide. M14 and J
have merely: 'nor even among the <span id="page_114">p. 114</span>
creatures of the sacred beings those which are an antagonism of
himself;' apparently connecting this section with the next. This final
argument is that, as the demons by their very nature must injure their
friends if they fail with their enemies, they contain within themselves
the source of their own final destruction. In other words: 'if Satan
rise up against himself, and be divided, he cannot stand, but hath an
end' (Mark iii. 26).

<span id="fn_422"></span>[114:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_424.md) The army of angels
of §§ 58, 64. The author, having exhausted his arguments in favour of
the final triumph of the good creation, now returns to his description
of the issue of the contest, which he was about to commence in § 64.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[114:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_425.md) M14 and J omit the
following words as far as 'provided.'

<span id="fn_424"></span>[114:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_426.md) See Chap. XXIII,
3.

<span id="fn_425"></span>[114:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_427.md) Or, perhaps,
'concealment,' as there is some doubt whether aûbênî*d*ârîh means
'making unseeing, or making unseen.'

<span id="fn_426"></span>[115:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_428.md) That is, the
wicked who are still living, being penitent, rein-force the host of the
righteous.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[115:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_429.md) Referring probably
to the 'growth of sin' mentioned in Chaps. XI, 2, XII, 5.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[115:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_430.md) That is,
'purified.'

<span id="fn_429"></span>[115:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_431.md) All men are said
to be purified, at the time of the resurrection, by passing through
melted metal, which seems like warm milk to the righteous, but is a
final torment to the wicked (see Chap. XXXII, 12, 13, Bd. XXX, 19, 20).

<span id="fn_430"></span>[115:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_432.md) This would seem to
allude to some Avesta name of this molten metal, which is no longer
extant.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[115:6](sbe18044.htm#fr_433.md) We should probably
read hamâî, 'ever,' instead of hamâk, 'all.'

<span id="fn_432"></span>[115:7](sbe18044.htm#fr_434.md) Reading zûr, but
it may be zôr, 'violence.'

<span id="fn_433"></span>[116:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_435.md) That is, the
destroyer of the fiend was the creator of the men mentioned in § 10S.
The reading sinâ*s*nŏ, 'perception,' is uncertain; perhaps we ought to
read 'in the regions (dîvâgânŏ) of light.'

<span id="fn_434"></span>[116:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_436.md) That is, before
the purification in molten metal.

<span id="fn_435"></span>[116:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_437.md) The 'body,'
apparently, but this section is by no means clear.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[116:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_438.md) This must be on
the part of the fiend, as burial is unlawful.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[116:5](sbe18044.htm#fr_439.md) Perhaps the
meaning is that the fiend is at length overcome by the constantly
accumulating numbers of the penitent wicked.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[117:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_440.md) The handsome
maiden who is supposed to meet the departed soul, and whose form is an
embodiment of its own deeds and religion (see Chaps. XXIV, 5 XLIV, 20).
Or, perhaps, the angel of religion (Dîn) itself, which is reverenced for
its radiance and glory in Din Yt. 4.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[117:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_441.md) A mythical
mountain (see Chap. XXX, 2).

<span id="fn_440"></span>[117:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_442.md) The mythical
source of pure water which is said to flow from Mount Albûr*z* into Lake
Urvis on the summit of Mount Hûgar, and thence to Mount Aûsîndôm in the
wide-formed ocean, whence it partly flows into the ocean, and partly
rains upon the earth (see Bd. XIII, 1, 3-5). Much the same account of it
is given in Chap. XCII, 5, only the lake is said to be on the summit of
Mount Aûsîndôm. It is the Av. Ardvî sûra of the Âbân Yt., and the Pahl.
form Arekdvisûr = Aregdvisûr may be explained as a trans-position of
Aredgvisûr, an ordinary mispronunciation of Ardvî sûra. Modern Parsis,
who consider the Pahl. k as silent (or merely a soft aspirate) after a
vowel, would pronounce Aredvisûr.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[118:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_443.md) See § 99.

<span id="fn_442"></span>[118:2](sbe18044.htm#fr_444.md) See § 97.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[118:3](sbe18044.htm#fr_445.md) M14 and J omit
what follows, as far as 'heterodoxy.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[118:4](sbe18044.htm#fr_446.md) Literally
'attainers to endurance.'

<span id="fn_445"></span>[119:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_447.md) The 'going forth'
of the day or the sun means its disappearance or going away, and is an
Avesta phrase. The sun is supposed to be 'forth' when it is absent, not
when it appears.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[120:1](sbe18044.htm#fr_448.md) All objects being
supposed to be represented by guardian spirits in the other world.
