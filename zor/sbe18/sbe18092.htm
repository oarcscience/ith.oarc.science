<p>1. <I>As to</I> the eighty-fourth question <I>and</I> reply, that which you ask is thus: <I>As to</I> a gift for the ceremonial <I>which</I> they do not reduce, and while they give <I>it</I> in excess, in what manner is then its great advantage, <I>and</I> how <I>and</I> in how many modes is it possible to occur?</p>  
<p>2. The reply is this, that the advancement of the ceremonial of the sacred beings is by so much as the gift is more fully given; and the great advantage of the good work is more, and its reasons many, therefrom. 3. The desire of this wealth, which <I>has</I> come for the sake of the good work, is an experience</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_247"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 247</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the comfortable living of the angels, by whom the solemnizers are aggrandized, and is proper apart from <I>its</I> great judiciousness; to diminish <I>it</I> is improper.</p>  
<p>4. When the gift <I>for</I> the ceremonial is abundantly given, the performers of the ceremonial, who, with much trouble annoying them, <I>have</I> solemnized the Avesta <I>and</I> chanted the hymns (G&acirc;thas), and obtain the stipend of their solemnizing from the remuneration <I>of</I> the solemnization, are living comfortably, thriving, and blessed. 5. And also the undertakers of all the religious rites who, by means of the hope of rightful religion, render <I>one</I> certain as to the way <I>to</I> the distant awful place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and tempt the longers for righteousness into the religion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, undertake all the religious rites <I>and</I> ceremonial <I>of</I> the sacred beings for the sake of the stipend of proper diligence.</p>  
<p>6. And reasoning thought is cognizant as regards the advantageousness due to the undertakers and solemnizers of all the religious rites, and a great stipend is more obtained and observed <I>for them</I> than for <I>any</I> other profession. 7. The sons, too, of priests and disciples strive for the words prayed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_928"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and are more eager for their. prayers; and many, likewise, shall engage for all the religious rites, and become more diffusive of the religion (d&icirc;n&ocirc; b&acirc;li<I>s</I>n&icirc;ktar); and, in like, manner, the proper, more attainable, <I>and</I> more propitious path of the good for saving the soul becomes wider&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>
