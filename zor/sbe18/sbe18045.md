### CHAPTER XXXVIII.

1\. *As to* the thirty-seventh question and reply, that which you ask is
thus: The measure that they

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

measure good works *with being* revealed <span
id="fr_449"></span>[1](#fn_447.md), how is it then *when* there is more, or
not, done by us?

2\. The reply is this, that every thought, word, and deed whose result
is joy, happiness, and commendable recompense--when a happy result is
obtainable, and the exuberance (afzûnŏ) of thought, word, and deed is
important--is well-thought, well-said, and well-done <span
id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_448.md). 3. And for him the result of whose wish
for good works is conclusively joy and exaltation of soul--which are his
attainment of recompense from the constantly-beneficial space <span
id="fr_451"></span>[3](#fn_449.md), the immortal *and* unlimited, which
shall never perish--there is no measure of the multitude of good works.
4. For every one by whom many are performed, and *who* engages in still
more, appropriates the result more fully, and is more worthy; *but* it
is not obtained for the completion of that which is a *definite*
measure, therefore he does not obtain still more, and it is not
necessary *he should*; and it is, moreover not obtained even for the
completion of a limit of unlimitedness <span
id="fr_452"></span>[4](#fn_450.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_447"></span>[121:1](sbe18045.htm#fr_449.md) They are balanced
against the sins committed (see Chaps. XIII, 2-4, XXIV, 5, 6); if the
good works exceed the sins by a very small quantity the soul is supposed
to go to the ordinary heaven (vahi*s*tô), but if by a quantity
sufficient to balance one unatonable sin it goes to the best existence,
or supreme heaven (garô*d*mânô, see Sls. VI, 3, 4). M14 and J have
merely: 'The measure for good works *being* revealed.'

<span id="fn_448"></span>[121:2](sbe18045.htm#fr_450.md) The three
characteristics of good works.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[121:3](sbe18045.htm#fr_451.md) See Chaps. XXVI,
3, XXXI, 24, XXXVII, 22.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[121:4](sbe18045.htm#fr_452.md) The good works in
excess of the quantity necessary 'for admitting the soul into the
supreme heaven cannot affect the destination of the soul, but. they add
to its future enjoyment (see Chap. VIII, 4), and no limit can be
assigned to the quantity that can be thus absorbed.
