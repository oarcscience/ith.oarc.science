### CHAPTER LXIX.

1\. *As to* the sixty-eighth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: When *something* takes hold of the moon *or* sun what is then its
residence (khânŏ), *and* whence does it always seize upon *it?*

2\. The reply is this, that two dark progeny of the *primeval* ox <span
id="fr_786"></span>[1](#fn_783.md) move and are made to revolve from far
below the sun and moon, and whenever, during the revolution of the
*celestial* sphere, they make *one* pass below the sun, or below the
moon, it becomes a covering which is spun (ta*d*) over the sun, *and* it
is so when the sun or moon is not seen. 3. Of each of those two progeny
of the *primeval* ox--one of which is called 'the head,' and one 'the
tail'--the motion is specified among astronomers <span
id="fr_787"></span>[2](#fn_784.md); but *in* remaining upon those
luminaries, and producing that covering, they do not attain unto those
luminaries

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

within that covering. 4. *There* occurs no difference whatever of the
descending *rays* <span id="fr_788"></span>[1](#fn_785.md) from those
luminaries into a place of purity and freedom from disturbance far below
those luminaries, except this, that the light which they divert to the
world, and their activity as regards the *celestial* spheres are not
complete *for* so much time, *nor* the coming <span
id="fr_789"></span>[2](#fn_786.md) of the light to the earth.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_783"></span>[212:1](sbe18076.htm#fr_786.md) Supposing the
reading should be 2-ân gô*k*îhar-î târ here, and 2-ân gô*k*îharân in §
3. Gô*k*îhar is a supposed planetary (and, therefore, malevolent) body,
connected with the sun and moon and having a head and tail, which falls
on to the earth at the resurrection (see Bd. V, 1, XXVIII, 44, XXX, 18),
and is here described as the cause of eclipses. Its name implies that it
sprang from, or contained, the seed of the primeval ox, the supposed
source of animal life (see Bd. XIV, 3), and in its Av. form,
gao*k*ithra, it is a common epithet of the moon; in Pers. it has become
gôzihr or gava*z*kihr. As the words stand in K35 they look more like 2
andô*g* dâlan-î târ, 'two dark store-lobbies,' or 2 andô*g* gâl-î târ,
'two clusters of dark spiders;' and in § 3 the word han*k*înŏ is
substituted for the nearly synonymous andô*g*. In M14 the words seem to
be 2 ângûn *k*îharânŏ-î târ, 'two such dark faces.'

<span id="fn_784"></span>[212:2](sbe18076.htm#fr_787.md) M14 has 'in the
calculations of astronomers.'

<span id="fn_785"></span>[213:1](sbe18076.htm#fr_788.md) Literally
'fallers.'

<span id="fn_786"></span>[213:2](sbe18076.htm#fr_789.md) Assuming that
mâ*d*ârîh stands-for ma*d*ârîh. The meaning is that an eclipse produces
no harm beyond a short interruption of the descent of the sun's or
moon's rays to the earth.
