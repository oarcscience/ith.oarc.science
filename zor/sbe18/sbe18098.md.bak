### CHAPTER XCI.

1\. *As to* the ninetieth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: From what is the sky made, *and* with what is it prepared?

2\. The reply is this, that the sky is a dome (gardûn), wide *and*
lofty; its inside and whole width and boundaries (âkhyakîhâ), besides
its material existence, are the stone of light, of all stones the
hardest <span id="fr_981"></span>[1](#fn_978.md) *and* most beautiful; and
the grandeur of its spirit *and* even *its* internal bow <span
id="fr_982"></span>[2](#fn_979.md) are like *those of* mighty warriors
arrayed. 3. And that material of the sky reached unto the place *where*
promise-breaking words exist <span id="fr_983"></span>[3](#fn_980.md),
*and* was without need of preparation; *as* it is said *of* places such
as those--where wisdom is a witness about *them*--that *that* which is
not even itself a place, and its place does not yet exist, is without
need of any preparing <span id="fr_984"></span>[4](#fn_981.md).

4\. The light is for existing things, and they cherish a faculty
(nîyûîh) of motion also of two

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

kinds, *that* causing motion *and that* of movables <span
id="fr_985"></span>[1](#fn_982.md); as mobility is mentioned about
thought <span id="fr_986"></span>[2](#fn_983.md) and immobility about
material things. 5. Immovables are not moved, while movables are moved
by their power of movement; and those movables, that way causing motion,
are afterwards themselves a moving secret cause of motion, and then a
cause of motion is not moving the movable, since *it* is not incapable
of causing motion secretly by movement of itself. 6. Just as the force
(kûni*s*nŏ) of a movement exists *and* does not become a force; only
then it is declared by wisdom, that the causers of motion have been the
causing of motion by force before movement, *and, being* unmoved, they
are subsequently made to move by the force; later on, the causers of
motion *have* to cause motion, by their power of causing motion, *in*
the non-causers of motion, from which it is certain though the force of
a movement exists it does not become a force; but, finally, that *which
is* prepared with a source of activity <span
id="fr_987"></span>[3](#fn_984.md), before force, becomes unmoved.

7\. Natures without need of the trouble of a preparer are distinguished
from such; where movement occurs through every force, the championship
of a position (gâh) not made to move--except, indeed, *of that* whose
force, when it is unmoved by other force, is its own--is unmoving and
thirstless <span id="fr_988"></span>[4](#fn_985.md). 8. *It* 

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

*was* restored immovably when *there was* an approach to the sky of that
actual contender for the place, the fiend, and the sky *was* shaken by
him; for connected with the sky *were* arranged so many possessors of
all resources, dignified (afrankî*d*) by their. own all-powerful
position and that well-operating, mighty, undrawn bow <span
id="fr_989"></span>[1](#fn_986.md), righteous *and* well-discoursing
(hûfravakhsh), and many good spirits, gloriously co-operating for the
preparation of the sky. 9. For that which *was* not even itself a
place <span id="fr_990"></span>[2](#fn_987.md), when *it* is thus
henceforth really a place, is *in* want of preparing; *and*, in the
preparation *of* that visible <span id="fr_991"></span>[3](#fn_988.md)
place, with the material of the sky is mingled that triumphing, powerful
spirit who made its existence a seeking for principle *and* seeking for
intention, drawing up from below *and* drawing down from above, so that
through that seeking for principle it becomes a concord, the
resting-place of united champions, and unadmonishable through that power
of seeking for intention; such as this *it is* if, indeed, *it be* the
will of him, the creator of all goodness.

10\. And it is said summarily that the sky was shaken in the *period of*
disturbance and restored *with* trouble; and, if the guardian spirits
are in freedom from disturbance through the glory *of* the creator, when
there is not even a place for it prepared by themselves <span
id="fr_992"></span>[4](#fn_989.md), and *their* nature and own

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

strength are approving the trouble of preparation, it is not moved <span
id="fr_993"></span>[1](#fn_990.md), except by the creatures of *his* will,
a will which is subduing.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_978"></span>[259:1](sbe18098.htm#fr_981.md) The same notion as
that indicated in Genesis by the word 'firmament.'

<span id="fn_979"></span>[259:2](sbe18098.htm#fr_982.md) The rainbow.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[259:3](sbe18098.htm#fr_983.md) Probably meaning
that the sky extends downwards, below the horizon, as far as the second
grade of hell, that for 'evil words,' Du*s*-hûkht (see Sls. VI, 3,
note).

<span id="fn_981"></span>[259:4](sbe18098.htm#fr_984.md) The word dîvâk,
'place' (zîvâk in the Sasanian inscription of Naq*s*-i Rustam, but
traditionally pronounced *g*înâk), seems to be here taken in the
etymological sense of zîvâk, that is, 'a living-place.' The text refers
to the period, in the beginning, when the sky was indefinite space
unprepared for the residence of creatures and merely a region of light
(see Bd. I, 2), the light mentioned in § 4. Its preparation is referred
to in §§ 8, 9.

<span id="fn_982"></span>[260:1](sbe18098.htm#fr_985.md) M14 has 'movables
*and* immovables' instead of this clause.

<span id="fn_983"></span>[260:2](sbe18098.htm#fr_986.md) Perhaps we should
read 'the spirits,' by inserting an additional medial stroke in the
Pahlavi word.

<span id="fn_984"></span>[260:3](sbe18098.htm#fr_987.md) Reading
tûkhshînîkîhâ, instead of the unintelligible tûkhshtîkîhâ'. The author
has so nearly lost sight of his argument in the mazes of his verbiage
that there is some uncertainty about the translation of this paragraph.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[260:4](sbe18098.htm#fr_988.md) That is, the
guardians of a place exposed to all attacks (as <span id="page_261">p.
261</span> the sky is supposed to be), unless it is a stronghold in
itself, must be always on the alert.

<span id="fn_986"></span>[261:1](sbe18098.htm#fr_989.md) The rainbow;
reading atan*g* darûn.

<span id="fn_987"></span>[261:2](sbe18098.htm#fr_990.md) That is, 'a
living-place' (see § 3 n).

<span id="fn_988"></span>[261:3](sbe18098.htm#fr_991.md) Reading dî*d*ŏ,
'seen;' but it may be stô for stî, 'material.'

<span id="fn_989"></span>[261:4](sbe18098.htm#fr_992.md) That is, while the
sky was still indefinite space, the region of light, but, no
dwelling-place; although the guardian spirits had <span id="page_261">p.
261</span> been created as representatives of the creatures, both
spiritual and material, which were to be afterwards produced (see Bd. I,
8).

<span id="fn_990"></span>[262:1](sbe18098.htm#fr_993.md) That is, when
afterwards prepared as a dwelling-place the sky remains unmoved by evil
beings.
