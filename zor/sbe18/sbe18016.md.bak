### CHAPTER VIII.

1\. The seventh question is that you ask thus: When a man is passing
*away*, *and* after the occurrence of his passing *away*, how does the
good work

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

then go to him *and* assist him, which any others may do for him who has
gone out from the world, on the third night in the dawn <span
id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_76.md), *at* which he goes out to the
balance <span id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_77.md)? *And is its* greatness such
as though it be done by his own hand, or otherwise?'

2\. The reply is this:--When any others do a good work for him who *has*
passed away, after the passing away, and if he who *has* passed away did
not order that good work in *his* lifetime; and did not bequeath it, nor
*was its* originator, and it was not even his by design (dâ*d*ŏ), then
it does not go and does not reach him out at the balance. 3. Even at the
time for being proceeded with, when that good work does not assist it is
not appropriated, for that which is appropriated as the design of some
one is appropriated by acceptance from some one; when it is not his by
design it is then not accepted as his.

4.. If he who *has* passed *away* did not order that good work, and did
not even bequeath *it*, but was consenting to it by design, that which
shall be done in *his* life*time* then reaches out in the three *nights*
(satûîh) for the aggrandizement of his position; *but* that which shall
be done after *his* passing *away* is not in the account of the three
*nights* and the balance, but reaches out, at the time the good work is
proceeded with, for the enjoyment of the soul.

5\. And if he who *has* passed *away* ordered that

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

good work in his own life*time*, or bequeathed it, or was the originator
and cause of the soul's employment, although it is proceeded with after
*his* passing away, it then reaches out to him for the happiness of his
soul, since the origin of the thanksgiving (sipâs) <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_78.md), and the orderer and ownership of the good
work are certain.

6\. Any good work whatever which is proceeded with is clearly a like
good work as regards those who account for *it as* with him who is the
doer *of it*; also in the account of his soul the good work is as much
with him who did *it*, but the soul of him by whom the good work is done
by his own hand, is handsomer and stronger than of him by whom it is
ordered. 7. And its similitude is such as when a man's handsome and
seemly suit of clothes is his own, and he wears *it* on *his* body *and*
is handsomer, more splendid, and more seemly *than* another man *who*
wears a suit of clothes, *in* like manner, *which* is his own by theft.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_76"></span>[27:1](sbe18016.htm#fr_77.md) The soul of a dead
person is supposed to hover about the corpse for three nights, and not
to depart for the other world till the dawn after the third night; that
is, at dawn of the fourth day, including the day of death (see Chap. XX,
2, 3, Sls. XVII, 2-6).

<span id="fn_77"></span>[27:2](sbe18016.htm#fr_78.md) Where the soul's good
works are balanced against its sins, to determine its fate till the
resurrection.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[28:1](sbe18016.htm#fr_79.md) The good works
mentioned in this chapter would chiefly consist of prayers and
ceremonies for which priests have to be remunerated, and gifts to holy
men and the poor; such actions as are most highly appreciated by
priests.
