### CHAPTER LXXVII.

1\. *As to* the seventy-sixth question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: Will you direct *some one* then to make the heinousness of this
sin of unnatural intercourse clear to us?

2\. The reply is this, that the first material creature *was* the
righteous man, the smiter of the fiend, the righteous propitiator; so,
also, in the world *he* is more recognising the sacred beings, more
completely (hamâktar) for the production of creatures,

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

and with more provision for the creatures <span
id="fr_834"></span>[1](#fn_831.md). 3. And with the manifestation of
knowledge the best duty is that which *exists* in lawfully practising
procreation, *and* the complete progression of righteous men arose
therefrom.

4\. In like manner he who is the omniscient creator formed mankind in
the first pair, who were brother and sister, *and* became Mashyâîh and
Mashyâyôîh <span id="fr_835"></span>[2](#fn_832.md), and all races of
material life *exist* by means of acquiring sons and *his* omnisciently
causing procreation. 5. The man and woman *were* also made to lust
(gâmîni*d*ŏ) by him, and thereby *became* the father and mother of
material men; and he naturalized among primitive man the qualities of a
desire (âlû*d*anŏ) for acquiring sons together through glorifying. 6.
And the law *and* religion authorised it as a proper wish, so long as
*they proceed* from those who are their own *relations*, not from those
who are not their own; and with those whom next-of-kin marriages <span
id="fr_836"></span>[3](#fn_833.md), original duties, and desires for other
sons have formed, complete progress in the world is connected, and even
unto the time of the renovation *of the universe* <span
id="fr_837"></span>[4](#fn_834.md), it is to arise therefrom. 7. And the
birth of many glorious practisers of the religion, those confident in
spirit, organizers of the realm, arrangers of the country, *and* even
accomplishers

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

of the renovation *of the universe*, which *arises* from *those* same
*to* whom that practice shall be law--and when it occurs lawfully--is a
miracle and benefit of the world, the will of the sacred beings and the
utmost good work discernible, because the complete progress of the
righteous arises therefrom, and the great female faculty (nekedîh) is
manifested.

8\. So when the opponent of the same, by whom the source *of* seed *and*
procreation is spoiled, is intent upon a way for the death of
progeny--and the intention is certain--*its* annihilation is owing to
him <span id="fr_838"></span>[1](#fn_835.md); and he is the devastating
fiend <span id="fr_839"></span>[2](#fn_836.md), whose will is a desire of
depopulation and ruin, and by the power of his Nîyâ*z* (*demon of*
'want') <span id="fr_840"></span>[3](#fn_837.md) he turns imperceptibly the
esteem of the very indispensable production of men from the position of
wishing for sons to a creature <span id="fr_841"></span>[4](#fn_838.md) who
is opposed to it, through whom have arisen its ruin *and* corruption. 9.
And the nature and power which are his cherishing of progeny are not
suitable for receiving seed, and misrepresented (drôkînî*d*ŏ) by him is
the accompanying evil intercourse, so that emitting the seed (shûdak),
in delivering *it* at that time into that burning place, full of stench,
is to produce *its* death, *and* no procreation occurs.

10\. The dupes <span id="fr_842"></span>[5](#fn_839.md) turn the living
seed from mingling with women *and* seeking for births, just as in the
like vice of any demon, connected with a longing

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

for the dupes <span id="fr_843"></span>[1](#fn_840.md), they shall abandon
that advantage of the world, the delights (vâyagânŏ) of a son <span
id="fr_844"></span>[2](#fn_841.md). 11. He who is wasting seed makes a
practice of causing the death of progeny; when the custom is completely
continuous, which produces an evil <span id="fr_845"></span>[3](#fn_842.md)
stoppage of the progress of the race, the creatures *have* become
annihilated; *and* certainly, that action, from which, when it is
universally proceeding, the depopulation of the world must arise, *has*
become and furthered (frârâstŏ) the greatest wish of Aharman <span
id="fr_846"></span>[4](#fn_843.md). 12. Such a practiser is the greatest
wish of Aharman, through the demon's excretion <span
id="fr_847"></span>[5](#fn_844.md) of doubt *in* the practice, owing to
intercourse with the emitter, *which* is most filthy and most fetid, and
the emitting member, which is causing death; and the demoniacal
practice <span id="fr_848"></span>[6](#fn_845.md) is perceptible even from
the same practice, and whatever is the heinousness *of* the sinfulness
is clear to observers of the dead *body*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_829"></span>[224:1](sbe18083.htm#fr_832.md) Reading vinâsânŏ,
as in M14, instead of the doubtful word vashki*s*n, which might perhaps
be compared with Pers. buzhi*s*, 'opposition.'

<span id="fn_830"></span>[224:2](sbe18083.htm#fr_833.md) The meaning is
that no one is bound to put such sinners to death until they are
condemned by the authorities, but should one do so upon his own
responsibility, entirely for the good of the faith, and certain of the
impenitence of the sinners, he is not only free from blame, but has done
a meritorious deed.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[225:1](sbe18084.htm#fr_834.md) Reading
va*l*-dâm-nîvâri*s*nŏîhâtar; the syllables -âtar being written
separately M14 has va*l* dâm-nîvâri*s*nîh aîyyâ*d*tar, 'more remembering
the provision for the creatures.' Promoting the increase of, and
providing maintenance for, good creatures are considered to be important
good works.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[225:2](sbe18084.htm#fr_835.md) Here written
Mashyâ and Mashyâyâôîh, but see Chaps. XXXVII, 82, LXIV; 2.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[225:3](sbe18084.htm#fr_836.md) See Chap. LXV.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[225:4](sbe18084.htm#fr_837.md) See Chap. II, 8.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[226:1](sbe18084.htm#fr_838.md) A free translation
of a*g*a*s* lôîtŏ, which phrase is placed at the end of the section in
the Pahl. original.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[226:2](sbe18084.htm#fr_839.md) The evil spirit.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[226:3](sbe18084.htm#fr_840.md) See Chap. XXXVII,
52.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[226:4](sbe18084.htm#fr_841.md) M14 has 'to a
member.'

<span id="fn_839"></span>[226:5](sbe18084.htm#fr_842.md) Of the fiend.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[227:1](sbe18084.htm#fr_843.md) Such men are said
to become paramours of the demons (see Vend. VIII, 10e-106), as further
alluded to in § 12.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[227:2](sbe18084.htm#fr_844.md) M14 has 'seeking a
son.'

<span id="fn_842"></span>[227:3](sbe18084.htm#fr_845.md) Reading dahê*d*
va*d*, but M14 has yâîtyûntô, 'brought a,' and may be right.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[227:4](sbe18084.htm#fr_846.md) See Chap. XXXVII,
10.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[227:5](sbe18084.htm#fr_847.md) Reading rîkhîh,
but M14 has râsîh, 'course.'

<span id="fn_845"></span>[227:6](sbe18084.htm#fr_848.md) In hell.
