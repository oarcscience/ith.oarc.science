### CHAPTER LX.

1\. *As to* the fifty-ninth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: What is the sin owing to not appointing *an adopted son?* 

2\. The reply is this, that *for the man* himself *it* is allowable when
he gives up all the property in

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

righteous gifts, *and* when he has no property they should not provide
an adopted-sonship for him, *and* his relations are innocent as regards
it. 3. But should they recognise him who has the adopted-sonship of the
deceased, or has accepted the position of his adopted-sonship <span
id="fr_709"></span>[1](#fn_706.md), *or* should they have seized the
property for the adopted-sonship *in order* to appoint an acting adopted
son (satôrgar), *and* he conducts the adopted-sonship, and throws away
*both* the portion (bôn) provided for disbursement (vishôpŏ) and the
entirety, and quite destroys the property, and thoroughly ruins the
adopted-sonship, though, on account of not restraining him, it is said
*to be* a sin worthy of death for *every* single dirham, it is not said
*they are* killed outright <span id="fr_710"></span>[2](#fn_707.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_706"></span>[193:1](sbe18067.htm#fr_709.md) M14 has 'or any
one who has accepted the adoption as an adoption.'

<span id="fn_707"></span>[193:2](sbe18067.htm#fr_710.md) The meaning
appears to be that, though, owing to their misplaced confidence and
neglect, they have been guilty of many mortal sins they are not liable
to capital punishment. It is evident that the writer had no apprehension
that any property would lie neglected through want of administration,
but that he had considerable doubts of the prudence and honesty of
administrators.
