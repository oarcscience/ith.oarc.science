### CHAPTER LXXIII.

1\. *As to* the seventy-second question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: Does the stench of him, stinking withal, who commits unnatural
intercourse proceed to the sky, or not; and to what place does the wind
of that stench go *when* it goes *anywhere*?

2\. The reply is this, that the material stench goes as far and in such
proportion as there are filthiness and fetidness in the stinking
existences, and the spiritual stench goes unto there where there are
appliances (sâmânŏ) for acquiring stench, a miserable place; on account
of the separation (gar*d*îh) of the sky, everywhere where it goes in the
direction of the sky it does not reach to the undisturbed
existences <span id="fr_818"></span>[1](#fn_815). 3. Information about
the stench is manifest in the omniscient creator, whose omniscience is
among the luminaries, *but* that persistent creator *and* the primeval
angels *and* archangels are *free* from its attack; and *his*
information about the deception which is *practised* upon that labourer
*for* hell and mind *allied* with the demons <span
id="fr_819"></span>[2](#fn_816) is certain.
