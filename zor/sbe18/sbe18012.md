### CHAPTER IV.

1\. The third question is that you ask thus: For what reason does this
greatness <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59) of a righteous man exist?

2\. The reply is this, that *it* is for the performance of what is
desirable for the creator by the Ma*zd*a-worshipper; because he strives
unhesitatingly that the way for the performance of what is desirable for
the creator *may* be the propitiation <span
id="fr_60"></span>[2](#fn_60) which is his, desire, and that desired
propitiation <span id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_60) becomes perfect through
sound wisdom. 3. The wisdom by which he understands about the desire of
the heavenly angels is not appointed (vakht), but is the true, pure
religion which is knowledge of <span id="fr_62"></span>[3](#fn_61) the
spirits, the science of sciences, the teacher of the

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

teaching of the angels, and the source of all knowledge.

4\. And the progress, too, of the pure religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers is through the righteous man, as is shown of him in
revelation thus: 'I created, O Zaratû*s*t the Spîtamân! the righteous
man who is very active <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_62), and I will
guard his hands from evil deeds; I *will* also have him conveyed unto
those who are afterwards righteous and more actively wise <span
id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_63). 5. And *at* the same time the religion of
me who created him is his desire, *and* it is the obtainment of a ruler
which is to be changed by the well-organised renovation *of the
universe* <span id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_64).'

6\. As through wisdom is created the world of righteousness, through
wisdom is subjugated every evil, and through wisdom is perfected every
good; and the best wisdom is the pure religion whose progress is that
achieved by the upholders of religion, the greatness of the best men of
the righteous, in whose destiny *it is*, such as that which *was* shown
about Gâyômar*d*, Zaratû*s*t, and Sôshâns <span
id="fr_66"></span>[4](#fn_65).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_59"></span>[20:1](sbe18012.htm#fr_59) Referring to Chap.
II, 1, and not to Chap. III, 20; otherwise it might be supposed that the
questions were contrived to suit the replies.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[20:2](sbe18012.htm#fr_61) Or, perhaps,
'understanding.'

<span id="fn_61"></span>[20:3](sbe18012.htm#fr_62) K35 has 'obedience
to' by inserting a medial stroke in dâni*s*nŏ, which converts it into
*s*invi*s*nô, but is probably a mistake.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[21:1](sbe18012.htm#fr_63) M14 and J here insert
'I will guard his mind from evil thoughts, his tongue from
evil-speaking.'

<span id="fn_63"></span>[21:2](sbe18012.htm#fr_64) In the future
existence.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[21:3](sbe18012.htm#fr_65) M4 and J have '*and*
it is the obtainment of a ruler who is a wise upholder of religion, from
time to time, even unto the change of the last existences by the
well-organised renovation *of the universe*.' But the additional words
appear to have been suggested by the word 'ruler' being taken literally,
whereas it seems to have been figuratively applied to the religion which
is to rule the righteous till the future existence.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[21:4](sbe18012.htm#fr_66) In Chap. II, 9-13.
