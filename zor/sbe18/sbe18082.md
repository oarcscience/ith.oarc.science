### CHAPTER LXXV.

1\. *As to* the seventy-fourth question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: Do the angels have *his* dead *body* restored, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that *there* was a high-priest who said that the
angels do not have *his* dead *body* restored, because of the sin of the
mutually-polluting, full of stench, and inglorious victims
(khvâpî*d*ŏân) <span id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_821.md), the terrible kind
of means for the exculpation of creatures <span
id="fr_825"></span>[2](#fn_822.md), and that practice when males keep
specially imperfect in *their* duty; it *being* then suitable for
mankind to become *free* from him who--like A*z*-î Dahâk <span
id="fr_826"></span>[3](#fn_823.md), who wanted many most powerful
demons--resists *and* struggles, and is not possessing the perception to
extract (patka*s*istanŏ) a pardon, owing to the course of many
demoniacal causes. 3. But innumerable multitudes (amarakânîhâ), happily
persevering <span id="fr_827"></span>[4](#fn_824.md) in diligence, have
with united observation, unanimously, *and* with mutual assistance
(ham-ban*g*i*s*nîhâ) insisted upon this, that they have the dead
*bodies* of all men restored; for

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

the good creator, granting forgiveness *and* full of goodness, would not
abandon any creature to the fiend <span id="fr_828"></span>[1](#fn_825.md).
4. In revelation (dînô) it is said that every dead *body* is raised up,
both of the righteous and of the wicked <span
id="fr_829"></span>[2](#fn_826.md); *there* is none whom they shall abandon
to the fiend.

5\. And this, also, is thus decided by them <span
id="fr_830"></span>[3](#fn_827.md), that even *as to* him *who* is most
grievously sinful, when he becomes mentally *seeking* pardon *and*
repentant of the sin, *and, being* as much an atoner as *he* is well
able, *has* delivered *up his* body *and* wealth for retribution *and*
punishment, in reliance upon the atonement for sin of the good religion,
then it is possible *for* his soul, also, to come to the place of the
righteous <span id="fr_831"></span>[4](#fn_828.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_821"></span>[222:1](sbe18082.htm#fr_824.md) Victims of the
deceptions practised by the demons (see Chaps. LXXIII, 3, LXXIV, 3); but
the reading is uncertain.

<span id="fn_822"></span>[222:2](sbe18082.htm#fr_825.md) Probably the
punishment of the wicked in hell.

<span id="fn_823"></span>[222:3](sbe18082.htm#fr_826.md) See Chap. XXXVII,
97.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[222:4](sbe18082.htm#fr_827.md) Reading
farukhvŏ-tûshi*s*n, but it may be perkhûntŏ dahi*s*n, '*having* begged
the boon;' and M14 has pôryô*d*keshânŏ, '*of* those of the primitive
faith.'

<span id="fn_825"></span>[223:1](sbe18082.htm#fr_828.md) Except for
temporary punishment in hell. All ideas of the vindictiveness of
implacable justice are foreign to the Ma*zd*a-worshipper's notion of the
good creator.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[223:2](sbe18082.htm#fr_829.md) Compare Bd. XXX,
7.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[223:3](sbe18082.htm#fr_830.md) Probably by the
'multitudes' of § 3.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[223:4](sbe18082.htm#fr_831.md) By delivering up
his body and wealth to the will of the high-priest, as an atonement, and
mentally renouncing his sins, he is saved from hell, and the beneficial
effect of any good works he may have performed returns to him (see Sls.
VIII, 5).
