### CHAPTER IX.

1\. This, too, this aged *one* (aûzvâr*d*ŏ <span
id="fr_1377"></span>[1](#fn_1372).md) orders, that, *as to* the polluted of
the countries of Irân, when they do not obtain another washer, their way
is then through thoroughly washing *themselves* <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[2](#fn_1373.md). 2. For you who are understanding the
rite and capable of washing, *and* are the most forward and intelligent
of the religious, so long as your previous washing is a way of no
assistance, *there* is *this* tediously-worded epistle; moreover, all
their sin you assign for your own affliction <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[3](#fn_1374.md), whose after-course is thus for their
Pa*nk*adasa fifteen*fold*') washing', *at* the time they shall abandon,
*as* distasteful, that sin which is a new development by way of
Upasnât*e*ê ('washing downwards') <span
id="fr_1380"></span>[4](#fn_1375.md); and the sinfulness is his who
established that law for them.

3\. And yours are truly creatures of a fetid pool (gand-â*v*ŏ), who, as
regards my motive, always speak about it just as they spoke thus to a
priest <span id="fr_1381"></span>[5](#fn_1376.md): 'Why *has* the savoury
meat-offering not become forgotten by thee, *while* the firewood and
incense, because it is not possible to eat *them* up, are quite

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

forgotten?' 4. Also, *as* a similitude of your affairs, they are saying
that *it is* as though the stipend of guardianship *were* always to be
demanded just *in accordance* with omissions *of duty* (a*v*âg
mânî*d*îhâ) <span id="fr_1382"></span>[1](#fn_1377.md). 5. So that even
while the trifle of trifles which exists as an interval from the title
of leadership unto *that of* high-priestship--in which, except a title
that is no joy of the strictly religious, there is nothing whatever--is,
that way, to prepare a source of dispute as to the work which you do for
the guardianship, it should, therefore, be a sufficiency (khvâr-bâr),
where your own supreme work is purification itself; and to do either
*what* is taught, or is advantageous, would be withdrawing from the
country a demand which *has* caused disturbance (balûbâkînî*d*ŏ); to
subdue *it* thou shouldst always so decide the daily allowances <span
id="fr_1383"></span>[2](#fn_1378.md).

6\. And, to-day, I *have*, on that account, written everything sternly,
because that which another person arranges and speaks so opposed *to me*
in evil appearance--which is little fit *to be* prepared--when I write
seasonably, and with friendly and brotherly exaltation, you direct and
persevere more expressly in preparing, so that portion upon portion is
thus brought forth. 7. In good old age <span
id="fr_1384"></span>[3](#fn_1379.md) the great law of after-restoration is
a harsh remedy, and, on that

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

supposition, where *a rule* is shown to descend from their three
teachings <span id="fr_1385"></span>[1](#fn_1380.md), *and* is itself
regarded as true, *and* the wisdom of the period *as* impotent
(anôzôharîkŏ), you yourself fully imagine (hû-minê*d*ŏ) <span
id="fr_1386"></span>[2](#fn_1381.md) that *further restoration* is not an
important <span id="fr_1387"></span>[3](#fn_1382.md) and foremost thing. 8.
Those of different faiths of various kinds *have* many usages and
perplexing kinds of doubt, even about the accomplishment *and*
explanation of the statements of the high-priests <span
id="fr_1388"></span>[4](#fn_1383.md), for *on* this subject, about old age
(gûnânîh), *and* even about sprinkling and about yourself accomplishing
the religious *rites*, you are wisely *for* a preservation of the
equally wise experience of the profession; *and as to* the heterodox,
that writing which realised that even now memory is opposing you is
itself evil-wishing <span id="fr_1389"></span>[5](#fn_1384.md), and you
know *it* is your own arrangement.

9\. This, too, they <span id="fr_1390"></span>[6](#fn_1385.md) say that, if
*it be* on that account that the purifiers shall not always so perform
the purification by all three teachings, or every rite which is proper
according to one teaching, it will be necessary *that* the purifiers
shall abandon purification. 10. Then about old age, the performance of
the ceremonial <span id="fr_1391"></span>[7](#fn_1386.md), *and* the many
times of this which

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

are mentioned as *though* this *were* proper, *it* is stated as regards
how it is proper that, when on account of those of the good religion
they always proceed just as is mentioned in the Zand teaching of the
Avesta <span id="fr_1392"></span>[1](#fn_1387.md), it will then be
necessary *that* they shall abandon the religion. 11. And many other
sayings of things like unto these are scattered about (zerkhûnî-aîtŏ),
and are named near Âtû*r*ŏ-pâ*d* <span id="fr_1393"></span>[2](#fn_1388.md)
*as* hints from you; for this reason they are reckoned (khaprag-aîtŏ) in
the thoughts of men.

12\. And this much is written by me in distressing haste I consider *it*
complete, and *may* peace and every happiness perpetually become
hospitably attainable *and* accomplishable for you thereby, through the
severe anguish *and* discomfort, *and* the eternal distress and
despondency *of* the healer of affliction, Mânû*sk*îhar, son of
Yûdân-Yim, director of the profession of priests of Pârs and
Kirmân <span id="fr_1394"></span>[3](#fn_1389.md).

13\. Written in propitiation, praise, and benediction of the creator
Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the archangels, all the angels of the spiritual and
the angels of the worldly *existences, and* every guardian spirit of the
righteous. 14. Homage to the exalted pontiff (ra*d*ŏ) *sent* from the
creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the most heavenly of the heavenly, Zaratû*s*t the
Spîtamân. 15. The

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

*most* prayerful *and* gainful of things is righteousness; great and
good and perfect is Zaratû*s*t; *and* one *only* is the way of
righteousness, all the others are no ways <span
id="fr_1395"></span>[1](#fn_1390.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[354:1](sbe18121.htm#fr_1377.md) From this it
appears clearly that Mânû*sk*îhar was an aged man when these epistles
were written, though not too old to travel. The previous allusion to old
age, however, in Chap. I, 9, may not have referred to himself.

<span id="fn_1373"></span>[354:2](sbe18121.htm#fr_1378.md) As provided in
Vend. VIII, 299 (see App. V).

<span id="fn_1374"></span>[354:3](sbe18121.htm#fr_1379.md) omits alag,
'affliction;' and in K35 it is doubtful whether it be struck out, or
not.

<span id="fn_1375"></span>[354:4](sbe18121.htm#fr_1380.md) See Chap. III, 2
for both these terms.

<span id="fn_1376"></span>[354:5](sbe18121.htm#fr_1381.md) Implying that
the laity were inclined to attribute his own strict enforcement of
ceremonies, requiring the employment of the priest hoot, to interested
motives.

<span id="fn_1377"></span>[355:1](sbe18121.htm#fr_1382.md) That is, the
laity attributed his brother's laxity, on the other hand, to sheer
neglect of duty, and had, therefore, begun to consider his supervision
hardly worth paying for.

<span id="fn_1378"></span>[355:2](sbe18121.htm#fr_1383.md) Meaning that by
adherence to long-established custom, as regards both priestly work and
priestly allowances, the laity would be better satisfied and more easily
managed.

<span id="fn_1379"></span>[355:3](sbe18121.htm#fr_1384.md) Reading
hû-kahôbanîh; J has merely kahôbanîh, 'old age, antiquity.' He appears
to be referring rather to the antiquity of the Avesta law, than to his
own old age.

<span id="fn_1380"></span>[356:1](sbe18121.htm#fr_1385.md) See Chap. III,
1, Ep. I, v, 1, 6.

<span id="fn_1381"></span>[356:2](sbe18121.htm#fr_1386.md) J has
khavîtûnê*d*, 'you know.' He deprecates all further investigation into
the meaning of the scriptures, which had already been explained by three
old commentators, as he doubted the religious wisdom of the age in which
he lived.

<span id="fn_1382"></span>[356:3](sbe18121.htm#fr_1387.md) The continuation
of the text in J ends at this point.

<span id="fn_1383"></span>[356:4](sbe18121.htm#fr_1388.md) The
commentators.

<span id="fn_1384"></span>[356:5](sbe18121.htm#fr_1389.md) That is, the
decree of Zâ*d*-sparam, though itself objectionable, was opposed to the
heterodox who wished for further innovations.

<span id="fn_1385"></span>[356:6](sbe18121.htm#fr_1390.md) The heterodox.

<span id="fn_1386"></span>[356:7](sbe18121.htm#fr_1391.md) Referring
perhaps to the performance of the Vendidâ*d* service <span
id="page_357">p. 357</span>(which includes the Yasna ceremonial) as
directed in Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, *b*, *o* (see App. IV).

<span id="fn_1387"></span>[357:1](sbe18121.htm#fr_1392.md) It is possible
also to read 'in the teaching of the Avesta and Zand;' but this would
ignore the fact that the 'teaching' is the Zand itself.

<span id="fn_1388"></span>[357:2](sbe18121.htm#fr_1393.md) The same rival
as is mentioned in Chap. V, 14.

<span id="fn_1389"></span>[357:3](sbe18121.htm#fr_1394.md) According to Dd.
XLV, g the farmâ*d*âr or 'director' of the profession of priests of Pârs
was the pê*s*ûpâî or 'leader' of the religion.

<span id="fn_1390"></span>[358:1](sbe18121.htm#fr_1395.md) Compare Dd.
XCIV, 14, Ep. III, 23.
