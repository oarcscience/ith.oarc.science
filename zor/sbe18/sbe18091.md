### CHAPTER LXXXIV.

1\. *As to* the eighty-third question and reply, that which you ask is
thus: Is it desirable to give

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

in excess the gift *for* the ceremonial *which* it is not desirable to
diminish?

2\. The reply is this, that *it* is proper not to diminish a gift where
*it is* the gift <span id="fr_926"></span>[1](#fn_923.md) for a ceremonial,
and the reasons for it are many. 3. One is this, that a gift is the
money which in another good work suffices for the accomplishment of the
good work, *and* the good work of a righteous gift <span
id="fr_927"></span>[2](#fn_924.md) is a great good work, *and* not to
diminish *it* is sure worthiness among the explainers. 4. When the
sacred feast <span id="fr_928"></span>[3](#fn_925.md) *and* the gift for
the ceremonial are supplied in excess, even that which is an excess of
gift is an excess of liberality to the performers of the ceremonial,
*and has* realized (frârâstŏ) an excess of good works that is
commendable.
