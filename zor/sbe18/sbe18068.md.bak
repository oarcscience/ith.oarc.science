### CHAPTER LXI.

1\. *As to* the sixtieth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: What is the propriety *and* impropriety, the merit *and* demerit,
of family guardianship?

2\. The reply is this, that the merit is the appointment *and*
recognition of him who accomplishes more worthily the greater benefit;
the demerit is *as to*

him who is unworthy, or him whose worthiness is not appointed to avert a
lesser benefit and the ruining of a worthy adoption. 3. Nearer details
(khûr*d*akŏ) of the family guardianship which is proper *and* which is
not proper for an adopted son's duty, of the child of good religion with
whose business *it* is connected, *and* of the fathers for whom a family
guardian is to be appointed, are *in* the recital of five chapters
(fragar*d*ŏ) of the Hûspârûm *Nask* <span
id="fr_711"></span>[1](#fn_708), and *in* the abstracts (giriftakŏîhâ.md)
of the good ideas in various scriptures (naskô) in which many decisions
are together.
