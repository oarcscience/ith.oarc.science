### CHAPTER II.

1\. I *have* also examined that writing <span
id="fr_1280"></span>[2](#fn_1276.md) in detail, and *it* is very unprepared
for the remarks of the learned and those acquainted with the religion,
for the sentences concocted *have* to be divided, and the slender
demonstration is disconnected (aparvandî*d*ŏ); so I consider that *it*
is not sent to be seen, as regards which such a course *would*, indeed,
*be* a cause of terror to purifiers. 2. *It* is so written that, while
on account of *that* same terror they are very much alarmed, and are
thorough in maintaining the duty of the continuance of care for water
and bull's urine <span id="fr_1281"></span>[3](#fn_1277.md), and *of* the
formula of the operation, they shall more fully perform *it* as a duty
provided for high-priests; even from that I am more fully of opinion
that your like judgment and own concession *have* produced this
explanation.

3\. When I saw in the decree, such as that which you have written, that
each time *one* comes unto a purifier who washes *in* such manner as is
declared

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

in revelation--which is evident, indeed, from *his* existence when *he*
is a religious purifier, *and* also from *your* priestly lordship's
knowledge of the rite; indeed, there is no use of *that* same decree
unless the scripture of revelation, likewise, be so--*he* is to do *it
with* very strict observation, *now*, since, owing to the reception of
terror by the purifiers, that preparation is evidently to produce, as
regards their own disposition and movements, much harm *and*
irregularity, *and* perplexed thoughts *among* the people, the discredit
of the decreer is generated therefrom, and it would have been more
reasonable to consider the terror and doubt of the purifiers in another
way.

4\. That which is so explained by you as though it would remain
accomplished *and* would be in notice--and this is written by you like
as it were from a teaching of *some* description--is not proper;
because, thus, every rite in the performance of the desired operation,
even by one *single* teaching, is suitable, *which*, like the
preparation for the statements of lying litigants, is very like, *but*
not correct. 5. For when there are *some* who *have* furthered
Mê*d*yôk-mâh <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1](#fn_1278.md) better than the
teaching of Afarg <span id="fr_1283"></span>[1](#fn_1278.md), *it* is well
when every single rite in the teaching is right; and *as to* his rite
*it* is not very clear that deliverance <span
id="fr_1284"></span>[2](#fn_1279.md) is promoted by maintaining *it*. 6.
Even on that *occasion* when Mê*d*yôk-mâh *has* mentioned threefold
washing, *and* Afarg once washing <span
id="fr_1285"></span>[3](#fn_1280.md), Mê*d*yôk-mâh is the after deponent
and Afarg the prior

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

deponent <span id="fr_1286"></span>[1](#fn_1281.md); and, on that account,
the statement is to be made as long as Mê*d*yôk-mâh is preserved, *but*
as regards the opinion of the words of Afarg *it* is to be maintained in
a state of preservation.

7\. *As to* that which Afarg *has* said <span
id="fr_1287"></span>[2](#fn_1282.md), that 'two purifiers are requisite,'
Mê*d*yôk-mâh *has* also said that one is plenty; *and*, since the
teaching of Sôshâns <span id="fr_1288"></span>[3](#fn_1283.md) is similar
evidence to his, as to that which is said by him, they have thus been
more unanimous that when there is one it would be proper; *and* as
several high-priests have announced just the same evidence, *and* Afarg
himself *and* other priests have been of the same opinion where *it* is
the performance of the beginning of the Vîkaya ('exorcism') <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[4](#fn_1284.md), Mê*d*yôk-mâh is preserved. 8. Not on
this account, that Afarg is more preservative <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[5](#fn_1285.md) through once washing, is the operation
to be performed according to the teaching of Afarg, but the once washing
from Afarg who is the prior deponent, *and* the one purifier from
Mê*d*yôk-mâh who is the most corroborated are to be accepted and to be
conducted.

9\. And even the computers of the stars would make the position of the
stars which exists when that of the sun *and* moon is from the direction
(min zîk) of *S*atvâharân <span id="fr_1291"></span>[6](#fn_1286.md), that
of Saturn from the direction

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

of Avênak, and that of Mars from the direction of Pa*d*ramgôs, a
position *which* sends much good, *and* is said *to be* capable of
undoubtedly (anârangak) bringing on maturity of strength. 10. That this
is to be seen as an occurrence (*g*astŏ) is a conjunction (nazdakŏ)
which is not possible <span id="fr_1292"></span>[1](#fn_1287.md), because,
if the conjunction of Satvâharân *be* exact, yet, since Saturn *and*
Mars are not at *their* conjunctions (min nazdak), its effect is not a
good configuration (khûp tanû); if the conjunction of Avênak *be* exact,
yet, since the sun, moon <span id="fr_1293"></span>[2](#fn_1288.md), *and*
Mars are not at their conjunctions, its effect is not good; *and* if the
conjunction of Pa*d*ramgôs be exact, yet, since the sun, moon, and
Saturn are not <span id="fr_1294"></span>[3](#fn_1289.md) at their
conjunctions, the effect is

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

not good; on account of <span id="fr_1295"></span>[1](#fn_1290.md) which,
in any conjunction which is not exact, they believe *it* possible *for*
a firm mind also to accomplish this auspicious labour
(sukh-var*z*i*s*nŏ), but they say the just and wise should make the
decision <span id="fr_1296"></span>[2](#fn_1291.md). 11. So that this one
is a very good position, because that which is truly issuing
(râst-ta*g*) through the conjunction of Satvâharân, is from that mighty
Satvâharân <span id="fr_1297"></span>[3](#fn_1292.md), *and* that of
Satvâharân *being* better through the conjunction of Pa*d*ramgôs, that
is done <span id="fr_1298"></span>[4](#fn_1293.md).

12\. You *should* understand that of the same kind is the similitude of
the three teachings, of which you *have* written, with this similitude
which I *have* portrayed <span id="fr_1299"></span>[5](#fn_1294.md) *and*
ordered to form *and* scheme, so that you *may* look at it more clearly,
from a proper regard for your own deliverance <span
id="fr_1300"></span>[6](#fn_1295.md), *for* the sharp

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

intellectuality of the re-explainers of *what is* not well-considered
*in connection* with *its* purpose (âhankŏ), *and for* the accumulation
*of opinions* that is steadfast in the law of the ancients *and* orders
*you* to heed *it*. 13. For, owing to the miraculousness and
pre-eminence of that <span id="fr_1301"></span>[1](#fn_1296.md), he who
thinks to restore the good ideas of the ancients does not himself
understand the knowledge in that wisdom of the ancients, *and* does not
keep his own presumption (mînîh) lowly and teachable; much, too, which
is through his own learning is declared *to be* out of it (the law),
*and* how he orders *us* to understand *it* is *by* his own
opinion <span id="fr_1302"></span>[2](#fn_1297.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1276"></span>[331:2](sbe18114.htm#fr_1280.md) The decree of
Zâ*d*-sparam. a copy of which had been sent to him by the people of
Sîrkân (see Ep. I, iv, 7).

<span id="fn_1277"></span>[331:3](sbe18114.htm#fr_1281.md) The two liquids
used in the purifying ceremony of the Bareshnûm (see App. IV).

<span id="fn_1278"></span>[332:1](sbe18114.htm#fr_1283.md) See Ep. I, v, 1.

<span id="fn_1279"></span>[332:2](sbe18114.htm#fr_1284.md) From pollution.

<span id="fn_1280"></span>[332:3](sbe18114.htm#fr_1285.md) In Pahl. Vend.
IX, 132, *j* (see App. IV), where the threefold washing is connected
with the name of Afarg, and the once washing with that of Mê*d*yôk-mâh;
but Ep. I, vi, 7--9 agrees with the statement here.

<span id="fn_1281"></span>[333:1](sbe18114.htm#fr_1286.md) The words
pasîmal, 'after deponent,' and pêsmâl, 'prior deponent,' are here
written alike (see Ep. I, vi, 10, note).

<span id="fn_1282"></span>[333:2](sbe18114.htm#fr_1287.md) In Pahl. Vend.
IX, 132, *b* (see App. IV and compare Ep. I, vi, 1-4).

<span id="fn_1283"></span>[333:3](sbe18114.htm#fr_1288.md) See Ep. I, v, 1.

<span id="fn_1284"></span>[333:4](sbe18114.htm#fr_1289.md) See Ep. I, vi,
6.

<span id="fn_1285"></span>[333:5](sbe18114.htm#fr_1290.md) From pollution
(see § 6).

<span id="fn_1286"></span>[333:6](sbe18114.htm#fr_1291.md) The high-priest
of the Parsis in Bombay is of opinion that the names of the three
'directions' mentioned in this section are the Pahlavi forms of the
names of three of the lunar mansions, whose <span id="page_334">p.
334</span> Pâzand appellations are given in Bd. II, 3; and he identifies
Satvâharân with Kahtsar, Avênak with Avdem, and Pa*d*ramgô*s* with
Padêvar. The reading of all these names is, however, very uncertain.
*S*atvâharân is written *S*atâharân three times out of the five
occurrences of the name, and the first syllable might easily be read
Gaht = Kaht, so as to correspond with the Pâzand; on the other hand, the
reading *S*at corresponds with *S*ata-bhisha*g* or *S*ata-târakâ, the
Sanskrit name of the 25th lunar mansion, Kahtsar. As Pâz. Avdem seems to
be merely Pahl. afdûm, 'last,' I prefer identifying Avênak (which can
also be read Avê*r*ak) with the ninth lunar mansion, Avra (Avrak in Bd.
VII, 1, Avrak in Zs. VI, 1), the Sans. Â*s*leshâ. Pa*d*ramgô*s* is also
written Pa*d*ramgôs twice out of the three occurrences of the name; its
identification with Padêvar makes it the first lunar mansion, the Sans.
A*s*vinî. The aspect of the heavens, therefore, which is here mentioned
as very auspicious, has the sun and new moon in the latter part of
Aquarius, Saturn in the first part of Aries, and Mars in the latter part
of Cancer, that is, twice as far from Saturn as the latter is from the
sun and moon.

<span id="fn_1287"></span>[334:1](sbe18114.htm#fr_1292.md) That is, it very
rarely happens; as rarely as the exact agreement of three different
commentators, whom these three conjunctions are intended to represent.

<span id="fn_1288"></span>[334:2](sbe18114.htm#fr_1293.md) Reading mit*r*ô
mâh, instead of Mê*d*yôk-mâh.

<span id="fn_1289"></span>[334:3](sbe18114.htm#fr_1294.md) The MSS. omit
lâ, 'not,' by mistake.

<span id="fn_1290"></span>[335:1](sbe18114.htm#fr_1295.md) Reading râî, as
in J, instead of the lâ, 'not,' of K35 and BK.

<span id="fn_1291"></span>[335:2](sbe18114.htm#fr_1296.md) That is, the
circumstances are too unpropitious for any one to come to a decision
without consulting those who are better qualified to judge, as is also
the case when commentators disagree.

<span id="fn_1292"></span>[335:3](sbe18114.htm#fr_1297.md) Reading min zak
rabâ *S*atvâharân, but this is doubtful, because K35 has min rabâ âharân
with zak *S*at written above min rabâ; BK has min zak *S*atŏ (or dâ*d*ŏ)
rabâ âharân (or khârân), which is merely reading the same characters in
a different order; while J omits most of the doubtful phrase, having
merely min zak-î, which, with the alteration of râst-ta*g* into râsttar,
changes the meaning into the following:--'because that which is through
the conjunction of Satvâharân is more correct than that of Satvâharân,
*and* that which is through the conjunction of Pa*d*ramgo*s*, that is
done.'

<span id="fn_1293"></span>[335:4](sbe18114.htm#fr_1298.md) Or 'that remains
the effect.'

<span id="fn_1294"></span>[335:5](sbe18114.htm#fr_1299.md) Reading
nî*s*ânînî*d*ŏ; K35 and BK omit the first letter so as to convert the
word into dîhânînî*d*ŏ, which might mean 'presented.'

<span id="fn_1295"></span>[335:6](sbe18114.htm#fr_1300.md) From pollution.
There is some temptation to use the word 'salvation' for bû*g*i*s*n, but
this would introduce ideas that were, no doubt, foreign to the author's
mind.

<span id="fn_1296"></span>[336:1](sbe18114.htm#fr_1301.md) The ancient law,
as contained in the difficult language of the Avesta.

<span id="fn_1297"></span>[336:2](sbe18114.htm#fr_1302.md) That is,
commentators are apt to attribute to the scriptures many opinions which
really originate in themselves.
