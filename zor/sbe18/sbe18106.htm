<p>1. That writing which comes amid the writing of your epistle is a correct fragment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as regards the nothing in which <I>one</I> is to change the operation properly maintainable, and it is becoming; because, if it be even for him, by whom it is written from the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_299"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 299</FONT></A></p>  
<p>statements of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h, Afarg, and S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1151"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the several statements <I>and</I> teachings of the same high-priests, yet then the elaboration <I>and</I> publication thereof are not such as that which is sent down by his further elaboration&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1156"></A><A HREF="#fn_1152"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 2. And thereby it <I>has</I> seemed manifest <I>that it</I> is sent so that a wish for the spirit <I>may</I> proceed from the truth of <I>its</I> minister (pa<I>d</I>&#335;), or <I>from</I> his thought for the desired decision; or his understanding <I>may</I> be of that kind which is warped (vuk&ocirc;<I>s</I>t&#335;), as though he believed it as other than the exposition of the religion <I>and</I> the teaching of the high-priests. 3. But until the unparalleled arrival of S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1157"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> any one not sharing in complete knowledge is not appointed unto a patron spirit (ahv&#335;), <I>and</I> the fiend specially contends more experimentally with the thoughts of the high-priests of the religion for a religious decision.</p>  
<p>4. And even the recompense of community&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1158"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of property is that when <I>one</I> gladly observes pure thoughts; <I>and</I> the swift action of voluble (p&ucirc;r) speakers and kind regard of religious characters for deliverance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1159"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> <I>and</I> for the noticeable undeceitfulness of the same spirit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1160"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>--which is itself the desire of settled observation that is in it for the sake of the</p>

<p>same kind of full religious diffusion--are the swift action of the patron spirit, which, for the sake of preparing him for a deliverance that is not falsifying revelation <I>and is</I> without disputants, is a kind regard for the deliverance itself of <I>him</I> whose spiritual life (h&ucirc;k&#335;) it is.</p>  
<p>5. <I>As to</I> that which is thought by him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1161"></A><A HREF="#fn_1157"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of those deliverances sent down, completed, <I>and</I> announced, I consider more particularly about the meaning of one thing, which is their solemnized observance. 6. The solemnized observance of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h is in the teaching&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1162"></A><A HREF="#fn_1158"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h, and those of Afarg and S&ocirc;sh&acirc;ns are each one meditated <I>and</I> indicated in a teaching; and the pointedly superior position of each one of them is mentioned by him in <I>his</I> statement of any teaching and <I>of</I> the decision set up. 7. Also with a kind regard for his own choice he <I>has</I> thought it (the former teaching) imperfect, and, on account of <I>what</I> was not attained by it--which <I>was</I> a re-explainer of the same good ideas provided--<I>its</I> dissimilarity to it is not unnoticed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1163"></A><A HREF="#fn_1159"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 8. <I>But</I> when <I>one</I> hears the re-explainers of a true reply he is well protected (h&ucirc;-zinhar&icirc;<I>d</I>&#335;) by complete mindfulness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1164"></A><A HREF="#fn_1160"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> is himself confident that the teaching of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h is not the whole statement of M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h, for there are many opinions of</p>

The reference is to the decree of Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam mentioned in Chap. IV, 7, the 'writing' alluded to in Ep. II, ii, 1; iii, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1151"></A><A HREF="sbe18106.htm#fr_1155">299:1</A> The names of three of the commentators whose opinions are most frequently quoted in the Pahlavi Vendid&acirc;<I>d</I> (see Sls. I, 3). Each of them appears to have written a complete 'teaching' or dissertation upon the ceremonial laws, from which the quotations are taken (see &sect; 6).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1152"></A><A HREF="sbe18106.htm#fr_1156">299:2</A> That is, in collecting the opinions of the ancients, he has twisted them so as to suit his own views.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1153"></A><A HREF="sbe18106.htm#fr_1157">299:3</A> The last of the future apostles (see Dd. II, 10), not the commentator of the same name mentioned in &sect; 1.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1157"></A><A HREF="sbe18106.htm#fr_1161">300:1</A> Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam the writer of the decree mentioned in &sect; 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1158"></A><A HREF="sbe18106.htm#fr_1162">300:2</A> The word <I>k</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>tak&#335; means usually a written course of teaching or exposition, a commentary, dissertation, or manual of instruction.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1159"></A><A HREF="sbe18106.htm#fr_1163">300:3</A> Implying that Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam had been more inclined to enforce his own opinions than to examine those of the commentators.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1160"></A><A HREF="sbe18106.htm#fr_1164">300:4</A> The Pahl. translation of Av. &acirc;rmaiti, 'devotion,' which is usually personified as a female archangel protecting the earth.</P>

It appears probable that the author had access to much more complete commentaries than the fragments now extant in the Pahlavi version of the Vendid&acirc;<I>d</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1162"></A><A HREF="sbe18106.htm#fr_1166">301:2</A> Meaning, probably, that M&ecirc;<I>d</I>y&ocirc;k-m&acirc;h was disposed to relax the rigid enforcement of the law in cases of doubt or difficulty, as the Avesta itself does in several cases.</P>
