### CHAPTER LXXXVIII.

1\. *As to* the eighty-seventh question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: *As* family householders we of the good religion of Irân,
before each *celebration of* all the religious rites with
holy-water <span id="fr_941"></span>[3](#fn_938.md) which they have
provided in the land <span id="fr_942"></span>[4](#fn_939.md) of Pârs, have
then always given for it a gift of 400 dirhams, *or* 350 dirhams <span
id="fr_943"></span>[5](#fn_940.md) *at* least. 2. And now if *we* should be
needy, when we deduct something from the 400 dirhams, or from the 350
dirhams, of the gift for them, they would then not accept *it* from us,
and speak thus: 'Less than 400, or than 350, dirhams we do not <span
id="fr_944"></span>[6](#fn_941.md) accept.' 3. *But* there are needy *men* 

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

who always come to us themselves and speak thus: 'For 350 dirhams we
will always twice conduct all the religious rites *and* ceremonial with
holy-water such as *those* which you have always ordered before for 400;
only order us.' 4. Would a needy *one, apart* from the priestly men
*who* always say that they are not, be authorised, or not?

5\. The reply is this, that the priest *to whom your* predecessors
*have* given a gift of 400 or 350 *dirhams*, for all the religious rites
with holy-water, it is proper to consider particularly virtuous *and*
faithful, when there is nothing else *about* him, on account of which he
is otherwise: 6. A *celebration of* all the religious rites with
holy-water, in which they shall use four pure animals <span
id="fr_945"></span>[1](#fn_942.md)--*and* just according to the teaching of
the high-priests they present *to* every single fire from one animal
*and* one holy-water--and the offering of holy-water unto the fire whose
holy-water *it is*, and bringing it on to another fire *apart* from that
holy-water, and the *ceremonial* cleansing of the holy-water they
maintain by agreement in thy name, the superiors solemnize with
approval, faithfully, and attentively; *and* the remuneration of 350
dirhams would be a balancing of when they conduct the religious rite
*at* the place of undertaking *it, and* when *it* is undertaken as
regards a distant district <span id="fr_946"></span>[2](#fn_943.md).

7\. In A*r*takhshatar-gadman <span id="fr_947"></span>[3](#fn_944.md),
within my memory,

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

they who would accept less than 300 dirhams <span
id="fr_948"></span>[1](#fn_945) for it made a memorandum (farhâng.md), to
keep in remembrance *that* 350 dirhams for all the religious rites
performed *was* to be the rule declared by those of the religion *in*
A*r*takhshatar-gadman. 8. Likewise, the glorified Atû*r*-frôbag <span
id="fr_949"></span>[2](#fn_946.md), *son* of Farâkhûzâ*d*, who was the
pre-eminent leader of those of the good religion, decided *in* the same
manner.

9\. And now, too, they always conduct those *rites* which are without
holy-water for 150 dirhams, *or* even for 120 dirhams <span
id="fr_950"></span>[3](#fn_947.md); and the reason of it is the neediness
of the disciples who, owing to that need, *and* in hope of obtaining
more employment, always diminish *their demands, and* through deficient
remuneration always become more needy, more importunate, and more
moderate in desiring remuneration; and, in the course *of* the
employment of resources and requesting *the charge of* all the religious
rites, the labour and endurance of discipleship are exhausted.

10\. And *as to* him who undertakes to conduct all the religious rites
twice for 350 dirhams, if *he be* properly working *and* thoroughly
reliable *for* the 350 dirhams *which* are always given him for the
ceremonial of all the religious rites--just like those who would always
undertake *them* once--and all the religious rites are conducted *and*
secured twice, on

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

account of the merit due to the continuous ceremonial of the sacred
beings it is more authorisedly ordered of those who solemnize all the
religious rites twice <span id="fr_951"></span>[1](#fn_948.md). 11. But
*as* to *him* who would under-take all the religious rites twice for 350
dirhams, *but* is not able to conduct *them* unless he puts to it *some*
of his own wealth, so that the progress *may be* acceptable to him as
they conduct *them* through repetition, he should not undertake *them*
owing to the reasons written in another chapter of ours <span
id="fr_952"></span>[2](#fn_949.md), since *it tends* much more to
neediness.

12\. And more like unto the ancient sceptics (vimânakŏ) *have* become
the disciples, among whom disagreement *and* enmity are produced, as is
written in the same writing (khadû-gûn nâmakŏ) <span
id="fr_953"></span>[3](#fn_950.md); *and*, owing to admonishing words,
these *become* enviousness and maliciousness unto the disciples, *and*
trouble *and* disagreement less becoming among you and more contentious
about you. 13. And at the time *in* which a great stipend existed,
*they* contended with him through whose greatness *and* abundance of
stipend their conflict was caused, one with the other, through envy; and
now, too, they [always](errata.htm#0.md) squabble *about* his deficient
stipend, by which they will tempt them, on account of *its* inadequacy,
for the sake of a way for preserving life, as was shown by my metaphor
in the other chapter <span id="fr_954"></span>[4](#fn_951.md). 14. When
those who, through need of *employment in the rites* of religion, or the
recitations <span id="fr_955"></span>[5](#fn_952.md)

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

which are its wisdom, would at once produce enmity, and the friends of
religion, are for each *of* two sides, *it* is important to look to the
procuring of forgiveness, kind regards, and the progress of the elect
(pasandakânŏ) in the duty of the faithful.

17.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[250:4](sbe18095.htm#fr_942.md) Reading bûm, as in
M14, instead of the ba*r*manŏ; 'son,' of K35.

rûpîs (see Chap. LII, 1 note). As in Chap. LXVI, the actual value of
these sums of money depended upon the price of the necessaries of life
in the ninth century.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[250:6](sbe18095.htm#fr_944.md) K35 repeats the
negative, but whether this is a blunder, or intended to intensify the
negation, is uncertain.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[251:1](sbe18095.htm#fr_945.md) Sheep or goats.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[251:2](sbe18095.htm#fr_946.md) That is, it is a
fair average charge.

Ar*d*ashîr-khurrah, the name given by Ar*d*ashîr son of Pâpak, the first
Sasanian king, to the city and district of Gôr, subsequently called
Pîrûzâbâd (see Nŏldeke's Geschichte der Perser and Araber zur Zeit der
Sasaniden, pp. 11, 19), about seventy miles south of Shîrâ*z*.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[252:1](sbe18095.htm#fr_948.md) About 105 rûpîs.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[252:2](sbe18095.htm#fr_949.md) The name of an
early editor of the Dînka*rd*, whose selections from various religious
writings form the fourth and fifth books of that extensive work in its
present form. He lived after the Muhammadan conquest of Persia, and
probably in the eighth century of the Christian era.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[252:3](sbe18095.htm#fr_950.md) That is, 52½ or 42
rûpîs.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[253:1](sbe18095.htm#fr_951.md) This is also
stated in Chap. LXVI, 32.

<span id="fn_949"></span>[253:2](sbe18095.htm#fr_952.md) See Chap. LXVI,
24-26.

28, 29.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[253:5](sbe18095.htm#fr_955.md) It is uncertain
whether these are the correct technical meanings of kêsh and dôr.
