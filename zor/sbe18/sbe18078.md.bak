### CHAPTER LXXI.

1\. *As to* the seventieth question and reply, that which you ask is
thus; Is anything which happens

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

unto men through fate or through action, is exertion destiny *or*
without destiny, *and* does anything devoid of destiny happen unto men,
or what way is it? 2. *As to* that which they say, that, when a man
turns unto sinfulness, they ordain anew a new death <span
id="fr_796"></span>[1](#fn_793.md); *as to* that which they say, *that*
anything which happens unto men is a work of the moon <span
id="fr_797"></span>[2](#fn_794.md), and every benefit is connected with the
moon, and the moon bestows *it* upon worldly beings; and *as to* what
way the moon *does* this, and bestows all benefits, order *some one* to
decide the literal explanation of how and what way it is, by the will of
the sacred beings.

3\. The reply is this, that the high-priests <span
id="fr_798"></span>[3](#fn_795.md) have said thus, that there are *some*
things through destiny, and there are *some* through action; and *it* is
thus fully decided by them, that life, wife, and child, authority and
wealth are through destiny, and the righteousness and wickedness of
priesthood, warfare, and husbandry are through action. 4. And this, too,
is thus said by them, that that which is not

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

destined for a man in the world does not happen; *and* that which is
destined, be it owing to exertion, will come forward, be it through
sinfulness *or* slothfulness he is injured by it. 5. That which will
come forward owing to exertion is such as *his* who goes to a meeting of
happiness, or the sickness *of* a mortal who, owing to sickness, dies
early <span id="fr_799"></span>[1](#fn_796.md); *and* he who through
sinfulness and slothfulness is thereby injured is such as *he* who would
wed no wife, *and* is certain that no child of his is born, *or* such as
he who gives *his* body unto slaughter, and life is injured by his
living.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_793"></span>[215:1](sbe18078.htm#fr_796.md) This reference is
to a phrase in the Pahl. commentary on Vend. V, 33, which commentary
contains a good many of the statements made in this chapter, excepting
those relating to the moon. The reading aôsh, 'death,' given by K35, is
probably more correct than aûba*s*, 'for him,' given by our modern MSS.
of the Vendidâ*d*; but M14 has amended it, and states 'then many new
things are ordained by it for him.'

<span id="fn_794"></span>[215:2](sbe18078.htm#fr_797.md) Assuming that
vidanâg, 'time,' stands for bidanâg, the Huz. of mâh, which means both
'month' and 'moon.' In the following phrases the word mâh is used.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[215:3](sbe18078.htm#fr_798.md) It may be noted
that most Pahlavi writers, when quoting the Pahlavi commentaries on the
Vendidâ*d* (as the author is doing here) or any other Nask, speak of
them merely as the utterances of the high-priests, and reserve the term
dînô, 'revelation,' for the Avesta itself; thus showing that belief in
the inspiration of the Pahlavi translations of the Avesta is a very
modern idea.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[216:1](sbe18078.htm#fr_799.md) M14 has 'which
comes forward owing to sickness.'
