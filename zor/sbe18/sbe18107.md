# CHAPTER VI.

1\. *As to* that which is written in that epistle, that in the teaching
of Sôshâns he thus states, that 'of both the purifiers necessary he is
suitable by whom the ritual is performed <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[3](#fn_1163.md),' they have been similarly very
unanimous that when one is incapable (atû) <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[4](#fn_1164.md) it is the other *that* is suitable,
who is written *of* in connection with him; and that, moreover, because
the statement of Afarg is in a teaching of his <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[5](#fn_1165.md), and, on

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

that account, that declaration of his seemed *to be* from him, which is
as though *it were* decided by him. 2. Then, when *one* reaches the
eulogistic (afrâsînâkŏ) reply of his re-explainer, owing to his just
will it is itself well perceived that Afarg comes into account as one of
the high-priests; and that which is the special teaching of Sôshâns
*has* mentioned that they have been very unanimous that when there is
one he would be suitable <span id="fr_1170"></span>[1](#fn_1166.md).

3\. That evidence, too, which many high-priests, and especially one
teaching, are alike diffusing, is stated also in the teaching of
Mê*d*yôk-mâh, that when he who is washing <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[2](#fn_1167.md) understands the profession, then one
purifier is plenty for him. 4. When it is abundantly declared, in
particular by two teachings, *that* when there is one he is suitable,
*it* is then not to be rendered quite inoperative through the solitary
statement of Afarg; for Afarg only said, as it appeared so to him
himself, *that* 'two purifiers are requisite <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[3](#fn_1168.md).' 5. The customs of another
high-priest are not declared to exist with like evidence; and this is
set aside (spê*g*î*d*ŏ) even by him himself, that another custom is not
suitable to exist, because his own view is mentioned as it appeared to
him.

6\. Those of the primitive faith have been fully <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[4](#fn_1169.md) of the custom that other *one*
selected, as to this, where *it* is the performance of the Vîkaya
('exorcism') <span id="fr_1174"></span>[5](#fn_1170.md); because its
explanation is this, that an

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

opinion upon which the priests (magavôgânŏ) are without dispute is that
which he says is the custom of a priest, *and* the business of the two
priests, of whose other custom he speaks as much, is a performance by
those two witnesses indicating the same as the priest.

7\. This, too, is evident, that, by confession of Afarg, when there is
*only* one purifier *he* is to be considered as being suitable <span
id="fr_1175"></span>[1](#fn_1171.md); *and* an attainment *to* more
evidence is that which is written by you, that Mê*d*yôk-mâh *has* said
that every customary *part* (pî*s*akŏ) is to be washed three times <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[2](#fn_1172.md), and now the purifiers *do it* once.
8. That teaching remains *in* the same manner as written by him, but the
three-fold washing of Mê*d*yôk-mâh is not a washing to be striven for,
but *one* to be well considered, *of* which he spoke; and this, too, is
not said by him, that when *one* shall not wash three times it is not
proper <span id="fr_1177"></span>[3](#fn_1173.md). 9. Afarg said that when
*one* shall <span id="fr_1178"></span>[4](#fn_1174.md) wash once it is
proper, and about this once the opinion of Mê*d*yôk-mâh is the after
statement, and the opinion of Afarg is the prior statement; *and* since
in the life of man the first *thing* to be considered is about purity,
not the indispensability of washing, and, further, the

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

pollution diminishes, about which it speaks in the religious cleansing,
during so many times washing *as* is declared, then the consideration of
it is a consideration about the one time which is the first
computation <span id="fr_1179"></span>[1](sbe18108.htm#fn_1175.md). 10.
That which mentions more than once washing is a contradiction of the
prior deponent, not a declaration; *and* the consideration of that
operation, so long as *it is* declared, is about the statement of him
who *has* mentioned once washing with the opinion of a prior
deponent <span id="fr_1180"></span>[2](sbe18108.htm#fn_1176.md), owing to
the same *reasons*. 11 . But if it be even that much washing which is
the merit of the operation, then the statement of Afarg about these
times <span id="fr_1181"></span>[3](sbe18108.htm#fn_1177.md) is manifestly
very preservative, *and* that of Mê*d*yôk-mâh is a necessity for
declaration.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[301:3](sbe18107.htm#fr_1167.md) Quoted from
Pahl. Vend. IX, 132, b, where it may be read either as an opinion of
Afarg (as mentioned in our text), or as a statement of the Pahlavi
translator, who would, therefore, appear to have been Sôshâns. A
complete translation of the Pahlavi version of Vend. IX, 1-145 and the
commentaries relating to the Bareshnûm ceremony, which are frequently
alluded to in these epistles, will be found in App. IV.

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[301:4](sbe18107.htm#fr_1168.md) Perhaps
'impotent,' as the Rivâyats (M10, fol. 103 a) provide that a purifier
shall be neither aged nor youthful, not less than thirty years of age.

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[301:5](sbe18107.htm#fr_1169.md) See note 3,
above; from this it appears that Afarg was the earlier commentator.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[302:1](sbe18107.htm#fr_1170.md) See Pahl. Vend.
IX, 132, *b*, but the earlier part of the section refers to statements
no longer extant.

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[302:2](sbe18107.htm#fr_1171.md) That is, the
person undergoing the purification.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[302:3](sbe18107.htm#fr_1172.md) See Pahl. Vend.
IX, 132, *b*, Ep. II, ii, 7.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[302:4](sbe18107.htm#fr_1173.md) J inserts 'of
the same opinion.'

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[302:5](sbe18107.htm#fr_1174.md) That is, they
have considered one purifier sufficient for reciting <span
id="page_303">p. 303</span> the passages from the Avesta (see Vend.
VIII, 49-62, IX, 118) which are supposed to drive away the fiend (comp.
Ep. II, ii, 7).

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[303:1](sbe18107.htm#fr_1175.md) See Pahl. Vend.
IX, 132, b.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[303:2](sbe18107.htm#fr_1176.md) See Pahl. Vend.
IX, 132,i, where, however, the statement as to three times washing is
attributed to Afarg, who is the prior authority quoted (as mentioned in
§ 9), and that as to once washing is attributed to Mê*d*yôk-mâh, who is
the after authority.

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[303:3](sbe18107.htm#fr_1177.md) Reading lâ
khalelûnê*d*ŏ-ae lâ shayedŏ instead of lâ khalelûnê*d*ŏ a-lâ shâye*d*ŏ.

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[303:4](sbe18107.htm#fr_1178.md) Reading aê
instead of va a. This statement is attributed to Mê*d*yôk-mâh in Pahl.
Vend. (see note 2, above).
