### CHAPTER LI.

1\. The fiftieth question is that which you ask thus: *As to one* of the
good religion who drinks wine immoderately, and loss *and* injury happen
to him owing to that immoderate drinking, what is then the decision
about him? 2. And how is the measure of wine-drinking *which* when they
drink is then authorised for them?

3\. The reply is this, that whoever through the influence of opportunity
drinks wine immoderately, *and* is adult and intelligent, through every
loss *and* injury which thereupon come to him from that immoderate
drinking, or *which* occasion anything unto any one, is then his causing
such pollution to the creatures, in his own pleasurably <span
id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_666.md) varied modes, that the shame owing to it
is a help (dastakîh) out of that affliction. 4. And even *he* who gives
wine authorisedly <span id="fr_670"></span>[2](#fn_667.md) unto any one,
and he is thereby intoxicated by it, is equally guilty of every sin
which that drunkard commits owing to that drunkenness.

5\. And concerning that drunkenness, what is said is that that is to be
eaten *through* which, when *one* eats *it, one* thinks better, speaks
better, and acts

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

better; and such even is the food *by* which, through *having* drunk
wine, *one* becomes more virtuous, or does not become more vicious, in
thought, word, and deed. 6. When an experiment as regards its *being*
good is tried, so that *having* drunk it in that proportion *one*
becomes better, or does not become worse, then it is allowable to drink
*it*.

7\. When an untried *person*, for the sake of *being* tried, *has* drunk
a mingled portion, first of one drinking-cup <span
id="fr_671"></span>[1](#fn_668.md), secondly of two drinking-cups, *and*
thirdly of three drinking-cups, *and* through drinking *it* he becomes
more virtuous, or does not become more vicious, in thought <span
id="fr_672"></span>[2](#fn_669.md), word, *or* deed, *he* is to increase
the drinking-cups, and the experiment is allowable unto those tested
just so far as the proportion is *such* that he becomes better, or does
not become worse. 8. To those tested *it* is authorisedly *given* to
that amount through which the experimenting that is mentioned *has*
extended; and to *him* who *it* is proved will become worse through the
drinking of wine, that amount, through the drinking of which, *when*
given <span id="fr_673"></span>[3](#fn_670.md) in the experiment, *it was*
seen that he became worse, is not authorisedly given.

9\. In a case of doubt *one* is to consider *him who is* orthodox
(hû-dînô), who *has* chanted the *sacred* hymns, *and is* of good.
repute, whose drunkenness

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

is not manifest, in this *way*, that he drinks as much wine as *was*
tried by him when he became no worse *by* drinking *it*. 10. It is
necessary to consider *him whose* religion is unseen, whose religion is
wrong, and him who is a child furnished even with the realities of
religion, in this *way*, that he becomes worse through *having* drunk
wine. 11. When *apart* from the decision there is no assignable
(ban*g*i*s*nîk) reason as regards *it*, the share of wine which they
gave not authorisedly who themselves drank wine, *one* considers as
*some of* the wine on *its being* given more authorisedly <span
id="fr_674"></span>[1](#fn_671.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_666"></span>[178:1](sbe18058.htm#fr_669.md) K35 has a blank
space here for a word, but no word seems really necessary. M14 fills up
the blank by changing gvî*d*ŏ into gar*d*îni*d*ŏ, and reads 'converted
unto his own pleasure, and the mode,' &c.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[178:2](sbe18058.htm#fr_670.md) M14 has
'unauthorisedly,' a very natural emendation of the text as it stands in
K35, but it does not appear that the author intended to limit the
responsibility of the person giving the wine merely to those cases in
which his action would be quite unjustifiable.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[179:1](sbe18058.htm#fr_671.md) Reading â*v*
*g*âmakŏ, 'water-cup;' but it is written like â*v* sîmakŏ in the MSS.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[179:2](sbe18058.htm#fr_672.md) K35 has mân, M14
mîni*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[179:3](sbe18058.htm#fr_673.md) Reading vehabûntŏ
instead of the unintelligible *g*ân bû*d*ŏ of K35, the alteration being
merely lengthening the bottom stroke of the Pahl. b. M14 substitutes
ba*r*â yehevûnê*d* for bû*d*ŏ *g*ân bû*d*ŏ, which gives the following
meaning: 'through the drinking of which, in the experiment, *it is* seen
that he becomes thoroughly worse.'

<span id="fn_671"></span>[180:1](sbe18058.htm#fr_674.md) The meaning
appears to be that, when there is no special reason to the contrary, the
quantity of wine one may have already drunk elsewhere is to be
considered as part of one's allowance.
