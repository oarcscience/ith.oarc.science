### CHAPTER LXXXIX.

1\. *As to* the eighty-eighth question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: When a man resolves within himself thus: '*In* the summer <span
id="fr_956"></span>[1](#fn_953.md) time I *will* go into Pârs, and will
give so much money for the high-priesthood, on account of the fires
*and* other matters which are as greatly advantageous,' though he
himself does not come into Pârs, *but* sends the money according to his
intention, *or* in excess of it, unto the high-priests--so that he is
like the great *who* send in excess of that unto the high-priests <span
id="fr_957"></span>[2](#fn_954.md)--that, as the benefit is greater which
is more maintained, they may provide for the fires of every kind *and*
other matters, is then his proceeding of sending to Pârs, for that
purpose, a sin, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that if his coming be indispensable for the
design he would undertake, then it is indispensable for him to
accomplish his own mental undertaking; but in suffering which is excited
*and* not avoidable, when *there* is really no possibility

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

of his travelling himself, any one whom he sends in his place, more
particularly on *that* account, is not acceptable by the approval of the
angels who *have* realized the affliction in *his* good thought, but the
good work is to be eagerly well-considered. 3. Good gifts, and every
office (gâs) about good works which it is possible to perform, are what
are commendable *in* the well-housed *man* that is not able to work
*himself* <span id="fr_958"></span>[1](#fn_955.md)*; they are* avoidable by
him when not of good race, and are not indispensable for him whenever
the good work is not announced. 4. When able to manage *it* himself *it*
is better; and when otherwise, his appointment of a faithful *person*
over *its* preparation, and *his* accomplishment of the work of selector
are expedient.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_953"></span>[254:1](sbe18096.htm#fr_956.md) Assuming that
hâmân stands for hâmînô.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[254:2](sbe18096.htm#fr_957.md) M14 omits this
phrase.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[255:1](sbe18096.htm#fr_958.md) M14 adds, 'he
longs for good giving and good consideration; important and virtuous is
he when able to do it;' but the sentence is hardly grammatical.
