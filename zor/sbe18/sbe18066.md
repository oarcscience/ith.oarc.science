### CHAPTER LIX.

1\. *As to* the fifty-eighth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: For how much property is it then necessary to appoint an adopted
son?

2\. The reply is this, that when the property which *has* remained his
for whom it is necessary to appoint an adopted son is as much as sixty
stîrs <span id="fr_708"></span>[2](#fn_705.md) of income, *it* is then
indispensable to appoint an adopted son for him. 3. Even when *it* is
less they should recognise him whose adoption is needful, *and who*
conducts an adopted son's duty; and, similarly, an adoption is to be
appointed for him, though it may not come as a possession unto him who
is fittest for adoption.
