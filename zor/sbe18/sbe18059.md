### CHAPTER LII.

1\. *As to* the fifty-first question *and* reply, that *which* you ask
is thus: *There is* a man who hands over a dirham <span
id="fr_675"></span>[2](#fn_672) as regards five bushels (kafî*z*.md) of

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

wheat, thus: 'I give this to thee as an instalment (bôn-ae) <span
id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_673.md) of five bushels of wheat at the end of a
month;' and during the month, *and* at *its* end, those five bushels of
wheat become five *times* the price; would they authorisedly seize the
five bushels of wheat *when* winnowed (pêkhtŏ ka*rd*ŏ) by him, through
that instalment which he handed over, or not?

2\. The reply is this, that when they who shall take his dirham *have*
to intrust the five bushels of wheat, unsuspiciously *and* by their own
will, *to him* to winnow, even so as *they* are advisedly *and*
unsuspiciously winnowed by him they should take *them* just as winnowed;
*this* is the decision authorisedly given. 3. But when *it* is winnowed
by him on account of very grievous necessity for payment, *it* is more
suitable for the soul to beg the giver of the money, who is the
purchasing payer <span id="fr_677"></span>[2](#fn_674.md), for *some* of
that excess of undivided (apâr) profit. 4. For *he has* to consider the
profit of *his* successors as among the profit of money on the
spot <span id="fr_678"></span>[3](#fn_675.md)--*when* more than

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

such instalment demanded--*and* not as a fresh carrying off of a
gift <span id="fr_679"></span>[1](sbe18060.htm#fn_676.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_672"></span>[180:2](sbe18059.htm#fr_675.md) The dirham
(δραχμή) is a weight, and also a silver coin of that weight, but its
amount is rather uncertain. According to the Pers. MS. M5 (fol. 55),
written A.D. 1723, the proper dowry for a 'privileged' wife is 2000
dirhams of white-silver, or 2300 rûpîs, and 2 dirhams of red gold, or 2¼
tolas. The rûpîs formerly current in Gu*g*arât were less in value than
the present Indian coinage, but the tola, which is the weight of the
present rûpî, was probably much the same as it is now, or 180 grains;
the statement in M5 is, therefore, equivalent to saying that the dirham
contained 202 grains of pure silver. This is so much more than the
amount deducible from other authorities that it might be supposed that
the stîr (στατήρ) or tetradrachm was meant, if it were not confirmed, to
some extent, by the Pers. Rivâyats, which state the dowry at 2000
dirhams of pure white silver and 2 dînârs of red gold of the Nîshâpûr
currency; the dînâr being a gold coin containing a dirham weight of pure
<span id="page_181">p. 181</span> gold. It is safer, however, to rely
upon the average weight of the Sasanian dirham coins, which, according
to Dr. Mordtmann's statement in ZDMG. vol. xii, pp. 44, 45, is about 63
grains, or 5 3/5 annas' worth of silver; so that the stîr would be 252
grains or 22 3/5 annas. But the actual value of such coins of former
times can be ascertained only from the quantity of corn! or other
well-defined necessary of life, which they would purchase.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[181:1](sbe18059.htm#fr_676.md) K35 has vaban
twice in this sentence, but bôn in § 4. M14 alters this word and others,
so as to make the chapter unintelligible. The money is supposed to be
given merely as a deposit, in acknowledgment of a bargain to be carried
out after the corn is ready for delivery.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[181:2](sbe18059.htm#fr_677.md) Reading zednunand
dûkhtâr, but, perhaps, this is a corruption of zednûnînî*d*âr, 'a causer
of purchase, a broker.'

<span id="fn_675"></span>[181:3](sbe18059.htm#fr_678.md) That is, 'ready
money.'
