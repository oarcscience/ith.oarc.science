### V. FINDING A CORPSE IN THE WILDERNESS.

THE controversy between Mânû*sk*îhar and his brother, Zâ*d*-sparam, of.
which the Epistles of Mânû*sk*îhar are the only portion extant, turned
chiefly upon the meaning to be attached to Vend. VIII, 271-299 <span
id="fr_1689"></span>[1](#fn_1683.md), and whether the mode of purification
therein detailed was a sufficient substitute, or merely a preparation,
for the Bareshnûm ceremony. The following is a translation of the
Pahlavi version of this passage <span
id="fr_1690"></span>[2](#fn_1684.md):--

Pahl. Vend. VIII, 271. 'O creator! how are those men purified, O
righteous Aûha*r*ma*zd*! who shall stand by a corpse, in a distant
place, upon a wild spot <span id="fr_1691"></span>[3](#fn_1685.md)?'

272\. And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: 'They are purified, O righteous
Zaratû*s*t!'

273\. 'But when so? \[that is, how will *such a one* become clean?\]'

274\. 'If a corpse-eating dog, or a corpse-eating bird, *has* attacked
that corpse, (275) *the man* shall then purify over his own body with
bull's urine, (276) thirty times by washing forwards \[*with* the bull's
urine\], *and* thirty times by washing over <span
id="fr_1692"></span>[4](#fn_1686.md), \[and

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

*his* hand shall rub over it.\] 277. Of the topmost *part* of him is the
washing over, \[that is, the washing of his head is that regarding which
*there* is a mention through this study-causing (hûshkar)
exclamation.\] <span id="fr_1693"></span>[1](#fn_1687.md)

278\. 'If a corpse-eating dog, or a corpse-eating bird, *has* not
attacked that corpse, (279) *he shall purify* fifteen times by washing
forwards, *and* fifteen times by washing backwards, \[and *his* hand
shall rub over it:\]

280\. 'He shall run the first mile (hâsar) <span
id="fr_1694"></span>[2](#fn_1688.md). 281: He shall then run forwards,
\[when the Pa*nk*adasa ("fifteen *times*") shall be performed by him.\]
282. *And* when he shall thus stop opposite any one whomsoever of the
material existence <span id="fr_1695"></span>[3](#fn_1689.md), he shall be
prepared with a loud issue of words, (283) thus <span
id="fr_1696"></span>[4](#fn_1690.md): "I have thus stood close by the body
of him who is dead; I am no wisher *for it* by thought, I am no wisher
*for it* by word, I am no wisher *for it* by deed, \[that is, *it* is
not possible for me *to be* as *though* washed.\] 284. It demands
purification for me, \[that is, wash me thoroughly!\]" 285. When he
runs, the first he shall reach, (286) if they do not grant him
purification, share one-third of that deed of his, \[that is, of all
that sin, not possible for him *to bear*, except when they shall perform
*his purification*, one *part* in three is theirs at *its* origin.\]

287\. 'He runs the second mile \[while he runs for

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

*it*\]. 288. He runs, *and* a second time he reaches *people*. 289. If
they do not grant him purification, (290) they share a half <span
id="fr_1697"></span>[1](#fn_1691.md) of that deed of his, \[that is, of all
that sin, not possible for him *to bear*, except when they shall perform
*his purification*, as *it were* a half is even for them at *its*
origin.\]

291\. 'He shall run the third mile \[while he runs for *it*\]. 292. When
he runs, the third he shall reach, (293) if they do not grant him
purification, share all <span id="fr_1698"></span>[2](#fn_1692.md) that
deed of his, \[that is, all that sin which *it* is not possible for him
*to bear*, except when they shall perform *his purification*, is ever
*theirs* at *its* origin.\]

294\. 'He shall then run forwards <span
id="fr_1699"></span>[3](#fn_1693.md). 295. He shall thus stop opposite
*some people* of the next house, village, tribe, *or* district, *and* he
shall be prepared with a loud issue of words, (296) thus: "I have thus
stood close by the body of him who is dead; (297) I am no wisher *for
it* by thought, I am no wisher *for it* by word, I am no wisher *for it*
by deed, \[that is, *it* is not possible *to bear* without washing.\]
298. It demands purification for me, \[that is, wash me thoroughly!\]"
299. If they do not grant him purification, he shall then purify over
his own body with bull's urine, *and* also with water; thus he shall be
thoroughly purified over <span id="fr_1700"></span>[4](#fn_1694.md).'

\[*a*. He shall go three miles; it is not allowable to walk back to
*his* district, until he *has* fully striven

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

with three persons, and all that sin, not possible for him *to bear*,
except when they shall perform *his purification*, is theirs at its
origin.

*b*. When thus thoroughly washed by him*self*, his duty even then is the
work frakairi frakerenao*d*, vâstrê verezyôi*d* ('he should accomplish
with perseverance, he should cultivate in the pastures <span
id="fr_1701"></span>[1](#fn_1695).md); there are *some* who would say thus:
'He is always for the performance of work, and abstinence from the
ceremonies of others is for him <span
id="fr_1702"></span>[2](#fn_1696.md).\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1683"></span>[455:1](sbe18127.htm#fr_1689.md) See Sacred Books
of the East, vol. iv, pp. 116-118.

<span id="fn_1684"></span>[455:2](sbe18127.htm#fr_1690.md) Subject to the
same observations as those detailed in p.431 n.

<span id="fn_1685"></span>[455:3](sbe18127.htm#fr_1691.md) Reading pavan
va*s*kar, but the MSS., by omitting a stroke, have pavan *s*ikar,' on
the chase.'

<span id="fn_1686"></span>[455:4](sbe18127.htm#fr_1692.md) So here, but
'washing backwards' in § 279; and in Ep. II, iv, a we find 'upwards' and
'downwards,' instead of forwards' and 'backwards.' The Pahlavi
translators were evidently doubtful whether the Av. upasnât*e*ê (see Ep.
II, iii, 2) meant 'washing over, backwards, or downwards.'

<span id="fn_1687"></span>[456:1](sbe18127.htm#fr_1693.md) Implying that
the Pahlavi translators had found the use of Av. aghrya for 'head'
rather perplexing.

<span id="fn_1688"></span>[456:2](sbe18127.htm#fr_1694.md) The hâsar was 'a
thousand steps of the two feet' (see Bd. XXVI, s, note), and was,
therefore, about an English mile.

<span id="fn_1689"></span>[456:3](sbe18127.htm#fr_1695.md) That is, any
human being.

<span id="fn_1690"></span>[456:4](sbe18127.htm#fr_1696.md) See Ep. I, ii,
10.

<span id="fn_1691"></span>[457:1](sbe18127.htm#fr_1697.md) That is, half of
the two-thirds remaining with him, or one-third of the whole original
trespass.

<span id="fn_1692"></span>[457:2](sbe18127.htm#fr_1698.md) That is, all the
remaining one-third of the original trespass.

<span id="fn_1693"></span>[457:3](sbe18127.htm#fr_1699.md) See Ep. II, iii,
3.

<span id="fn_1694"></span>[457:4](sbe18127.htm#fr_1700.md) What follows is
a commentary, by the Pahlavi translators, on the whole passage.

<span id="fn_1695"></span>[458:1](sbe18127.htm#fr_1701.md) 'Quoted from
Vend. XIX, 140, where the words 'sheep's food *and* food for oxen' are
added.

<span id="fn_1696"></span>[458:2](sbe18127.htm#fr_1702.md) A person so
purified by himself, after vainly seeking a proper purifier, is,
therefore, only fit for the ordinary labours of life, and must avoid all
religious celebrations till properly purified by the Bareshnûm ceremony.
This was the opinion of Mânû*sk*îhar, but it is based upon a Pahlavi
commentary, and not upon the Avesta text, which is not clear upon this
point.
