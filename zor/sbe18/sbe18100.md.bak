### Chapter XCIII.

1\. *As to* the ninety-second question *and* reply, that which you ask
is thus: From what place should Tî*s*tar <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[1](#fn_1001.md) seize the water? How does it pass into
a cloud, and how does he make the cloud move on? How does it rain upon
the world? How can he carry on a struggle with demons, and with which
demon can he carry *it* on? How does this always happen with the. hail
and snow, whenever hail and snow occur? And who can force away that hail
and snow?

2\. The reply is this, that the high-priests have thus said, that
Tî*s*tar seizes a place *which* is called 'abysmal' (vârûnak) <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[2](#fn_1002.md), that is the last place of filtration
in the ocean, *and* there are no removal of *any* kind and causing rain
from any other place. 3. And the cause of its (the rain's) establishment
is spiritually active, more particularly, however, through two kinds of
material agency: one is that which is the role (mang) in the atmosphere
of the earth, whereby it is drawn up in atoms similarly to smoke, *and*
in larger masses, well-soaring from the rivers; *and* one is that
*which* blows with the power of the well-operating wind, and the blowing
of the great united breath (ham-vâê) and strength of the community
(*k*andîgânŏîh)

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

of spirits <span id="fr_1006"></span>[1](#fn_1003.md), from the fully
perfect distillation (pûr-hû-zûhîgîh) of the mighty ocean to the upper
*regions*, and thereby the clouds are blown.

4\. Afterwards, it (the rain) speeds in the cloud, through the great
strength of the mighty wind, to where *there* is a necessity *for it*,
to divert *it* from where *there* is no necessity; and so long as
*there* is a necessity for *it* it (the cloud) discharges. 5. And when
*there* is a necessity and it causes rain, and the necessity is *for* no
*more* acquisitions of water, and the advantage is the effect of water
upon the place, and it distributes *it* to the existing rivers for the
use of the sea, and it causes rain *again*, it thereby produces even new
water, new flowing, new coming of healing to plants, new growth, new
golden colouring to lands; new purification to animals, new procreation,
new proper breathings for other creatures, new dawn, and new *things of*
that description. 6. The thriving of the world makes the advantage *and*
perfection of the good creation increase; and, apart from a great
craving for the effect of the glory of the spirits in the operations of
cultivation and the performance of spiritual mysteries, *it* is said
labours are aided even for *one* gloriously destined.

7\. And Tî*s*tar in seizing the water should seize upon the great
strength of the wind of whirlwinds (gar*d*înâkân), which is figuratively
(mîni*s*nîk) the dragging *and* blowing that follow the whirling; *and*
the purified water is expanded *and* carried up aloft to the higher
*regions* of the atmosphere, just as that

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

which is seen where it reaches up with the heaviness and weight of
earth, and then is discerned in the plain <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1](#fn_1004.md) accompanied by the dragging of the
whirling wind *which* would carry *it* afar to settle like *that* which
is owing to dust; it (the atmosphere) is called Andarvâê ('the
intermediate air'), and the wind is a whirlwind. 8. As the water is
lighter, and owing to the more strongly dragging wind on the ocean than
that which exists on the plain, so, also, the water from the ocean is
much more in proportion, and transportable farther up than the
dust <span id="fr_1008"></span>[2](#fn_1005.md) from the plain. 9. And as
in the midst of a plain a medium whirlwind of wind is expanded into the
wide plain by a medium dragging of the wind, and plenty of much
buffeting is the violence of the dragging of winds, a whirlwind of wind
which is seen very lofty and large is unknown; so, also, *one* is
ignorant of what is spreading among the movements of the sea. 10. The
water of that full and abundant flowing--which is through the power and
glory of the heavenly angels and Tî*s*tar's control of the work--is
blown up, both by the well-characterised water-drawing power, and also
by the force of *various* kinds, the dragging, and upward blowing of the
winds, into the atmosphere; and thence it rains the complete rain, as
they *have* recounted from observation and much full evidence.

11\. The demon who resists the *doings* of Tî*s*tar--and the glorious
Tî*s*tar, meeting him, properly drives back such improper resistance of
his--is

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

a demon *of* the name of Apâôsh <span id="fr_1009"></span>[1](#fn_1006.md),
which is interpreted *as* 'the destruction of water' (âp-aôsh). 12. He
contends, moreover, with the uppermost *and* lowermost water; and
desirous of *its* destruction that demon contends at three periods:
first, for the non-existence of rain; secondly, for converting *it into*
a cause of damage to a place; *and* thirdly, at. the place of producing
*it* with advantage; and the struggling is like a tree (vanô) which is
set moving.

13\. The seizers of the feminine <span id="fr_1010"></span>[2](#fn_1007.md)
pure water are a benefit *for the existences* of the whole world; and
the formation of rain, and the triumph and ascendancy of Tî*s*tar over
the demon, through that seizing (falânîh) of water, are due to the
creator who strengthens him <span id="fr_1011"></span>[3](#fn_1008.md), the
archangels who have him assisted <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[4](#fn_1009.md), the religious who reverence him, and
the worldly beings who glorify him. 14. Very properly do the archangels
propitiate *him, and* mankind promote the strength and power, which are
*engaged* about the business, by glorifying *and* invoking the good
spirit who increases them in consequence of glorifying *and* worship,
*and* through which

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

arises that advantageousness <span id="fr_1013"></span>[1](#fn_1010.md) of
his--which owing to that benefit is the benefit of every one else--for
this advantageous business.

15\. And Tî*s*tar shall gradually (pa*d*manîkîhâ) seize upon the water
to distribute *it* liberally, assiduously a similitude *of* that which a
learned ruler said, in extolling a wise high-priest, that, 'just as the
wind draws the up-flying water from rivers and springs *and* from seas;
Tî*s*tar, through his own liberality, bestows the prepared
apportionments of the whole production for the advantage of the
creatures *by* the will of the sacred beings, and makes *it* rain. 16.
And through that which he shall purposely seize to distribute suitably
he distributes the water purified, he moistens the pleasant *existences*
of animals *and* plants and spares <span
id="fr_1014"></span>[2](#fn_1011.md) the polluted, he provides for the
thirsty <span id="fr_1015"></span>[3](#fn_1012.md), he causes harm to the
dye-like bloody *one*, and he makes the world thrive. 17. When that
wide-*spread* liberality of his, the production of rain, is from the
pure, healing water which he shall thus seize gradually and with just
apportionment, *and* when through that acquiring of water-seizings the
rivers, springs, *and* other existences (shavandagânŏ) are
well-expanding, and even the diminution which is owing to the wasting
(aîrîkhtagîh) of rivers and springs does not occur thereby, *it is*
thus, too, the lordly, by a law (dâ*d*ŏ) moderate and varied--if the
regulation (gûn) is to reach *away* from the region--are as much
contributing, as

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Tî*s*tar is by
causing rain for the region and the good, to the aggrandizement of the
many grades <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1](#fn_1013.md) and the
replenishment of the region and creatures <span
id="fr_1017"></span>[2](#fn_1014.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[264:1](sbe18100.htm#fr_1004.md) The angel who is
supposed to produce rain, being a personification of the star Tî*s*tar
or Sirius. His production of rain and conflict with the demons of
drought and thunder are detailed in Bd. VII, 1-13.

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[264:2](sbe18100.htm#fr_1005.md) Assuming that
the word is meant as a translation of Av. vairya, a term which is
applied to the depths or depressed basins of the ocean in Yas. LXIV, 17,
18, Âbân Yt. 101, Zamyâ*d* Yt. 51.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[265:1](sbe18100.htm#fr_1006.md) Altering
mîni*s*nŏ, 'thought,' into 'spirits' by inserting an extra medial
stroke, as in M14 and J.

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[266:1](sbe18100.htm#fr_1007.md) Referring to the
frequent small whirlwinds, sweeping up the dust, which accompany every
complete change of wind in dry climates.

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[266:2](sbe18100.htm#fr_1008.md) K35 omits the
first two letters of afrâ, 'dust,' by mistake.

<span id="fn_1006"></span>[267:1](sbe18100.htm#fr_1009.md) Av. Apaosha, the
demon of drought, who, in the form of a black horse, is said in the
Tî*s*tar Ya*s*t to fight with Tî*s*tar in the ocean. Here his name is
written Apâhôsh, but see Bd. VII, 8-12.

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[267:2](sbe18100.htm#fr_1010.md) Reading
mâd*a*gîk. According to Bd. XVI, 6 the sky, metal, wind, and fire are
always male, while water, earth, plants, and fish are always female, and
all other creations are of both sexes. Water and earth are also
personified as female angels.

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[267:3](sbe18100.htm#fr_1011.md) In his first
encounter with Apâôsh, Tî*s*tar is vanquished, and attributes his defeat
to his not being invoked by name in the ceremonies, whereupon
Aûha*r*ma*zd* invokes him by name so as to give him enormous strength,
when he returns to the conflict and conquers the demon (see Tî*s*tar Yt.
20-28, Bd. VII, 8-10).

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[267:4](sbe18100.htm#fr_1012.md) Reading
aîyyârinênd, as in M14 and J; in K35 it is written like âyênd rîvênd,
'they come *and* liberate.'

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[268:1](sbe18100.htm#fr_1013.md) Reading
sû*d*akîh instead, of î yû*d*akîh, 'which is unity.' M14 has nadûkîh,
'benefit'

<span id="fn_1011"></span>[268:2](sbe18100.htm#fr_1014.md) Or 'forgives'
(bakhshê*d*ŏ).

<span id="fn_1012"></span>[268:3](sbe18100.htm#fr_1015.md) M14 and J have
'he causes the thirsty to drink.'

<span id="fn_1013"></span>[269:1](sbe18100.htm#fr_1016.md) Or 'to the great
aggrandizement of the grades.'

<span id="fn_1014"></span>[269:2](sbe18100.htm#fr_1017.md) Reading dâm, as
in M14 and J, instead of gadman, 'glory.' The chapter appears to break
off here, without any reference to the queries about hail and snow; but
it is uncertain if any portion of the work be here omitted (owing to
loss of folios in some older MS.) because the author does not always
reply to all clauses of the questions, as may be noticed in Chap.
XXXVII. One reason, however, for supposing that some of the text is here
lost is the allusion, in Chaps. XVII, 20, XVIII, 2, to a chapter no
longer extant in Dd.
