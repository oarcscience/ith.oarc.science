### CHAPTER LXVII.

1\. *As to* the sixty-sixth question *and* reply, that which you ask is
thus: What is this appearance <span id="fr_778"></span>[1](#fn_775.md)
which is girded on the sky?

2\. The reply is this, that *it is* a mingling of the brilliance of the
sun with mist and cloud that is seen, of which *it* is *at* all times
and seasons, moreover, a characteristic appearance, whereby *it has*
become their sign above from spiritual to earthly beings.

3\. That which is earthly is the water above to which its brilliance is
acceptable; and the many brilliant colours (gunakân) which are formed
from that much mingling <span id="fr_779"></span>[2](#fn_776.md) of
brilliance and water, and are depicted (mânâkî-aîtŏ), are the one
portion for appearing <span id="fr_780"></span>[3](#fn_777.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_775"></span>[210:1](sbe18074.htm#fr_778.md) Reading
dî*d*anŏîh; but the word can also be read sa*d*-vanîh, which might stand
for sa*d*-gûnîh,' a hundred-coloured existence,' a possible term for the
rainbow, but the Persian dictionaries give no nearer term than sadkas,
or sadkês.

<span id="fn_776"></span>[210:2](sbe18074.htm#fr_779.md) M14 has 'that
mingling of many portions and few portions.'

<span id="fn_777"></span>[210:3](sbe18074.htm#fr_780.md) Reading
dî*d*anŏkŏ; but it can also be read sa*d*-vanakŏ, a similar alternative
to that in § 1.
