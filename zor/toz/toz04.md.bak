# TEACHINGS OF ZOROASTER,

###### AND

#### THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE PARSI RELIGION

### INTRODUCTION

"I WILL now tell you who are assembled here the wise sayings of
Mazda, <span id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) the praises of Ahura, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[†](#fn_1.md) and the hymns of the Good Spirit, the
sublime truth which I see rising out of these flames. You shall
therefore <span class="smallcaps">hearken to the Soul of Nature</span>.
Contemplate the beams of fire with a most pious mind! Every one, both
men and women, ought today to choose his Dread. Ye offspring of renowned
ancestors, awake to agree with us." So preached Zoroaster, the prophet
of the Parsis, in one of his earliest sermons nearly 3,500 years ago.

Imbued from his infancy with deep philosophical

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

and religious thoughts for the welfare and well-being of mankind, this
ancient prophet of Bactria derived his holy inspiration after thirty
years of divine meditation on a secluded and inaccessible mountain-top
of "Ushidarena." Thus fortified in communion with Ahura-Mazda, "Spitama
Zarathustra" proceeded to the city of Balkh, at the time the capital of
the King of Iran, Kava Vishtaçpa. <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2.md)

Clothed in pure white flowing vestments, bearing with him the sacred
fire, <span id="fr_3"></span>[†](#fn_3.md) "Adar Burzin Mehr," and a staff
or sceptre made of a cypress tree, this sage of antiquity appeared
before the court of Kava Vishtaçpa. By persuasion and argument he
unfolded his religious mission; and proclaimed the mandate of Ahura, in
order to elevate the ancient faith of the Aryas to its lofty and
intellectual purity of monotheism.

Somewhere in the region washed by the eastern shires of the Caspian Sea,
on the fertile soil of Atropatene, the primeval Aryas toiled and
laboured in peaceful pastoral pursuit. In the early days of Zoroaster
homage was paid and prayers were offered to the Supreme Being, usually
through the recognized symbols of the Deity. The heavenly firmament,
tinted with cerulean hue—one limitless vault of refulgence and
indescribable splendour—the resplendent orb of the rising sun, the
ethereal gentleness of the

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

beaming moon, with her coruscating companions, the planets and the
stars, the verdant earth, the swift-flowing river, murmuring in sweet
cadence of eternity and bliss, the roaring sea of life and death, and
the glorious fire of Empyrean,—all these, in the days of the primitive
Aryan religion, were believed to be so many manifestations of the
Almighty God, and were accordingly symbolized. Things, which were
originally manifestations of God's good work, became in course of time
personified; assumed shapes of deities in the frail imagination of the
devotees; and finally came to be adored in lieu of the Great Architect
of the world. Thus, a religious system, in itself philosophically
sublime, degenerated into a system of polytheism, having for its object
adoration of idols and visible forms of good and evil spirits,
reflective of human imagination. This was the great evil, the crime of
ignoring the Creator for the created, which our prophet Zarathustra
laboured to remedy; and to restore the then ancient faith to its
pristine purity of Ahura worship was his chief object.

This led to a schism amongst the Indo-Eranians. One branch of the
ancient Aryas, powerfully supported by the State, became Mazdayasnians
(Monotheists), and the other of the same stock remained staunch to the
worship of material gods, and were known as Daêvayasnians (Polytheists).
Inevitable war of creed and faith resulted

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

in the migration of the weaker and polytheistic branch to the fertile
plains of India, where it took root and blossomed into the absolute
Brahminism of the modern Hindoos. The other remained on the native soil,
flourished for centuries, built up an empire, and finally in its turn
gave place to the Moslem hordes of Arabia. It migrated, and by the irony
of Fate, sought and obtained shelter with religious toleration among the
banished sister branch of the primeval stock.

The appearance of Zoroaster, to teach his excellent religion before King
Gushtasp and his wise and learned courtiers, may be well compared to
that of St. Augustine before King Ethelbert in the sixth century of the
Christian era. It is a curious historical coincidence that in both oases
extreme piety, religious convictions, eloquent and persuasive arguments,
prevailed. England received the blessings of Christianity through the
Saxon King Ethelbert, and rose in its might to be a great Christian
nation, whose empire in the twentieth century of the Christian era
extends over land beyond the seas; and under whose sceptre are folded
together vast millions of most loyal subjects of His Britannic Majesty
King Edward VII. So, 3,500 years ago, did the mighty Gushtasp of Iran
espouse the cause of Zoroaster and spread the Mazdayasnian religion to
all the corners of his

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

vast empire. He was the first founder of the doctrine of the State
religion. Under the renowned and mighty warriors Cyrus and Darius of
Persia, the national flag of State and Zoroastrianism, welded together
in unity, proudly floated over untold millions, who claimed protection
and paid homage to the Persian Court. Thus, through generations and
generations, flourished Zoroastrianism, to be ultimately shattered and
almost annihilated by the Arabs of the Khaliph Omar at the battle of
Nehâvand, A.D. 642. Subsequent events may well be described in the words
of Thomas Moore:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Is Iran's pride then gone for ever,  
  Quenched with the flame in Mithra's caves?  
No-she has sons, that never—never  
  Will stoop to be the Moslem's slaves,  
  While heaven has light or earth has graves."</span>

</div>

Inspired with zealous fervour, conquered but never vanquished, a few
Magian fathers of the East boldly sallied forth in a frail bark to seek
their fortunes in other climes. After undergoing terrible hardships,
they floated, at the mercy of the tempestuous ocean, to the hospitable
shores of Western India. Since then, centuries have passed, and the
Parsis have made themselves known in the West for their charity and
benevolence; for their staunch loyalty to the Crown; for their
commercial, educational, and political achievements.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

I have often wondered what powerful. influence, what intrinsic
philosophy, what imperceptible charm of thought and theology have been
at work to endear Zoroastrianism to the heart of the modern
Parsis—devoid as it is of the powerful support of the State; uprooted
from its native soil and transplanted for centuries amongst the Hindoos.
In the following pages I shall endeavour to show why Zoroastrianism has
maintained its divine power and prestige amongst them.

Nearly 3,500 years ago, at Rae, in Media, there lived a man of the name
of Pourushaspa, who led a holy and righteous life with his wife Dogdho.

It is related of this holy man, on the authority of the ninth chapter of
the Yaçna, that, being desirous of perpetuating his posterity, he
prepared a religious ceremony as a thanksgiving to the Almighty, and
solemnly prayed for the favour of a child. This worthy man's prayers
were duly answered, and a son was born to him, who laboured amongst our
primitive forefathers for the amelioration of mankind and their
deliverance from the everlasting ruin. His mission was prior to the
advent of Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam.

He left behind him, written in letters of golden fire, in the History of
the World, his illustrious name, Zarathustra, as a permanent landmark
and everlasting beacon for the welfare of the

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

body and the guidance of the soul in its passage from the known to the
unknown.

"O Maker of the material world! to what greatness, goodness, and
fairness, can this daêva-destroying teaching \[Monotheism\] of Zoroaster
be compared?"

The answer came:

"As high as Heaven is above the earth, which it encompasses, so high
above all other utterances the law of Mazdeism stands." <span
id="fr_4"></span>[\*](#fn_4.md)

"<span class="smallcaps">You shall therefore hearken to  
the Soul of Nature</span>"

I shall now explain the theology and moral philosophy of the religion of
Zoroaster. It is purely a monotheistic religion, based on the worship
and adoration of *Ahura-Mazda*, the "All-knowing Lord." It teaches:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\(1\) Of the life on the earth:

\(2\) Of the life hereafter:

\(3\) Of Immortality of the soul and the resurrection of the body.

</div>

Briefly, it teaches and develops the noblest instinct of mankind—*viz*.,
as Zoroaster himself has termed it, "<span class="smallcaps">The Soul of
Nature</span>." In the word-picture of the solemn chants of the Gathas
of the Zoroastrian religion, a notion of God of all the Universe is
convincingly interwoven.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> He, to whom no
form, shape, or colour is attributed, stands alone, *Omni Unique*, the
Nature of Infinite of *Infinite Perfection*. It is not given to mortals
of finite mind to define Him, the most just, the most benevolent, the
most merciful. He is One, who dwells in boundless space, clothed in the
most resplendent and illumined glory of inscrutable Nature. In
Khordah-Avesta, the prayer-book of the Parsis, God describes all His
attributes, in the following words:

"I am the Keeper; I am the Creator and the Maintainer; I am the
Discerner; I am the Most Beneficent Spirit.

"My name is the Bestower of Health; the Priest; Ahura \[the Lord\];
Mazda \[the All-knowing\]; the Holy; the Glorious; the Farseeing; the
Protector; the Well-wisher; the Creator; the Producer of Prosperity; the
King who rules at His Will; One who does not deceive; He who is not
deceived; He who destroys malice; He who conquers everything; He who has
shaped everything; All Weal; Full Weal; Master of Weal; He who can
benefit at His wish; the Beneficent One; the Energetic One; Holiness;
the Great One; the Best of Sovereigns; the Wise One." <span
id="fr_5"></span>[\*](#fn_5.md)

"He is the Light and Source of Light; He is the Wisdom and Intellect. He
is in possession of all good things, spiritual and worldly, such as

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

good mind \[*vohumano*\], immortality \[*ameretad*\], health
\[*haurvatad*\], the best truth \[*asha vahista*\], devotion and piety
\[*armaiti*\], and abundance of every earthly good \[*Khshathra
vairya*\]. All these gifts He grants to the righteous man who is upright
in thoughts, words, and deeds. As the ruler of the whole universe, He
not only rewards the good, but He is a punisher of the wicked at the
same time." <span id="fr_6"></span>[\*](#fn_6.md)

In the Zoroastrian Liturgy (Yaçna I.), Zarathustra describes God as

\(1\) "The Creator Ahura-Mazda, the Brilliant, Majestic, Greatest, Best,
Most Beautiful.

     .     .     .     .     .

\(4\) "who created us, who formed us, who keeps us, the Holiest among
the heavenly." <span id="fr_7"></span>[†](#fn_7.md)

The scope of this work does not permit me to discuss comparative
theology; but this I will say, that ancient as the Zoroastrian religion
is, no more comprehensive, lucid, and intelligible definition of the
Great Creative Cause can be found in any religious books of the modern
religions. It is worthy of note that Milton, who wrote nearly 2,500
years after Zoroaster, had grasped the true spirit of the Zoroastrian
ideal of God.

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Unspeakable who sit’st above these heavens,  
 To us invisible or dimly seen  
 In these Thy lowest works, yet these declare  
 Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine."  
     .     .     .     .     .</span>

</div>

Having established the belief in the Great Creative Power, Zoroaster
proceeded to strengthen and fortify his followers by carefully warning
them against the influence of the Evil Spirit. One of the greatest evils
in the time of the prophet was the tendency of the populace to adore and
worship God's manifestations or created elements. Slowly, superstitious
belief, for want of good guidance, created imaginary and fanciful gods,
who were materialized in idols, and worshipped at the whim of the
believer. In the language of the period, amongst the ancient Aryas, the
word *Daêva* signified God, from the Aryan root *div*, to shine, and
consequently all those personified manifestations of Nature were called
*Daêvas*. Zoroaster quickly perceived that the ancient monotheistic
religion of the Aryas was degenerating into a state of image and idol
worship. He had already taught the people "<span class="smallcaps">The
Soul of Nature</span>." It became necessary that he should stamp out the
so-called *idol-daêvas*.

Thenceforth Zoroaster, in the Avesta language, used the word *Daêva* in
the sense of an evil or wicked spirit. The old root *div*, to shine, has
given us such words as *Deus* in Latin, *Daêva* in Sanskrit, *Zeus* in
Greek, and *Tius* in German,

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

for God. The Avesta language of Zoroaster is the only ancient language
in which quite a contrary and evil meaning is attached to this word,
and, so far as this religion is concerned, the word *daêva* still has an
evil meaning. Had the great Xerxes been successful in his wars with the
Greeks, the Mazdayasnian faith would have been established in the West,
and all the modern languages would probably have been now using the word
*Daêva* for the Devil, or the Evil One.

Let me but for a moment lift the veil, and show you the most hallowed
and impressive picture of Zoroastrian speculative philosophy. In the
plenitude of the creation there, one perceives the hand of the Creator
in His Mighty Majesty, creating and completing this universe at six
different periods—first, the heavenly firmament; second, water; third,
the earth; fourth, plants; fifth, lower animals; and sixth and last,
man. Man is created free to act after his own heart and understanding.

"I have made every land dear to its dwellers, even though it had no
charms whatever in it," <span id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md) said
Ahura-Mazda to Zoroaster.

Sixteen different regions and countries created by Ahura-Mazda are
carefully described in the first Fargard of the Vendidad, giving a more
or less geographical notion to modern readers of the origin of the
population in Central Asia.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

But the most important speculative philosophy, disclosed by this
Fargard, is the existence of two primeval Causes in the state of Nature,
working in opposition to each other, known in the Avesta language as
*Spenta Mainyus* (the Creative or Augmenting Spirit), and *Angro
Mainyus* (the Destructive or Decreasing Spirit). Since the creation,
there has been an incessant state of conflict between these rivals; the
records of these encounters, in which man as a free agent plays his part
with his soul for a stake, are bound up in the annals of the world, to
be finally unfolded, read and adjudged on the great Day of Judgment.

This philosophy of the Good and the Evil Spirit, creative of the
material world, is not to be confused with the idea of dualism. Many
learned writers, of European fame, have clearly proved that Zoroaster
did not preach dualism. The Evil Spirit is not endowed with any of the
attributes of the Almighty; neither is he placed in opposition to, or
made a rival of, God. I have carefully read the exhaustive comments made
by Western scholars on this subject, some in favour, and the majority of
them against the theory of dualism.

As a great deal of controversy has been raised on the doctrine of two
rival spirits, I think it necessary to quote from the Avesta, and also
from the later Pahlavi text, to prove that dualism is not one of the
doctrines preached by Zoroaster.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

"Ahura-Mazda, through omniscience, knew that Ahriman exists. . . .

"The Evil Spirit, on account of backward knowledge, was not aware of the
existence of Ahura-Mazda. . . .

"He \[Ahura-Mazda\] sets the vault into which the Evil Spirit fled, in
that metal; he brings the land of hell back for the enlargement of the
world, the renovation arises in the universe by his will, and the world
is immortal for ever and everlasting. . . .

. . . So it is declared that Ahura-Mazda is supreme in omniscience and
goodness, and <span class="small">UNRIVALLED</span> in splendour.

Revelation is the explanation of both spirits together: one is he who is
independent of unlimited time, because Ahura-Mazda and the region,
religion, and time of Ahura-Mazda were and are and ever will be; while
Ahriman in darkness, with backward understanding and desire for
destruction, was in the abyss, and it is he who *will not be*."

 

Amongst others, the celebrated Dr. West, to whom the Parsis are greatly
indebted for his researches in the Avesta writings, finally refutes the
charge of dualism brought against Zoroastrianism by some learned
divines, who discovered dualism through the spectacles of modern
religions.

"The reader will search in vain for any confirmation

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

of the foreign notion that Mazda-worship is decidedly more dualistic
than Christianity is usually shown to be by orthodox writers, or for any
allusion to the descent of the good and evil spirits from a
personification of 'boundless time' as asserted by strangers to the
faith." <span id="fr_9"></span>[\*](#fn_9.md)

 

Reading carefully Fargard I. of the Vendidad, I cannot help admiring the
sublime theory of Nature, so far as it relates to the Destructive
Spirit. Now, what are the evils employed by Angro Mainyus? A great
serpent; winter months freezing water and earth, and retarding the
growth of fruit-bearing trees and other vegetation useful to mankind; a
poisonous wasp; evil thoughts; wild beasts destructive to animal kind;
doubt or unbelief in the Creator; indolence and poverty; idol and image
worship; devastation or plague; sorcery; fevers; falsehood; darkness;
noxious smells; and wickedness.

These are the few evils employed by Angro Mainyus to retard the progress
of, and if possible, destroy mankind. It is quite evident, that the sole
aim of Zoroaster's teachings is to raise God's best and fairest
work—man—to that level of human perfection by good words, good thoughts,
and good deeds, so as to enlist the services of the Good Spirit. Spenta
Mainyus being thus

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

invoked, a protection from evils can be obtained; and the soul of man at
the trumpet-call can be clothed in a fit and proper state of piety to
render homage to his Creator.

<span class="smallcaps">Of the Life on the Earth</span>

A graphic description of sixteen of the regions and countries created by
the Almighty is given in the Vendidad. They extend from the shores of
the Caspian to the banks of the Indus in Hindustan. The favoured man of
God was *Yima*, known in the Shah Nameh as Jamshid. To him God's
command, "Enlarge My world, make My world fruitful, obey Me as
Protector, Nourisher, and Overseer of the World," was given. Yima was
presented with a plough and a golden spear, as symbols of sovereignty.
He set to work to carry out this holy mandate, brought large tracts of
land into cultivation and filled them with men, cattle, beasts of
burden, dogs, birds, and ruddy burning fires.

Imagination soars high at this picture of pastoral bliss, of peaceful
occupation in cultivating the virgin soil and propagating the species.
Evil was unknown. The day of perpetual brightness, the summer of radiant
joy, and all heavenly peace had cast their mantle of transcendent glory
over the land of Iran, of which Yima was God's chosen overseer.

Little did Yima know that there existed in

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

the state of Nature the Evil Spirit (Angro Mainyus), to attempt to mar
his handiwork by snow, frost, and deluge.

"He \[Evil Spirit\] does not think, nor speak, nor act for the welfare
of the creatures of Ahura-Mazda; and his business is unmercifulness and
the destruction of this welfare, so that the creatures which Ahura-Mazda
shall increase he will destroy; and his eyesight \[evil eye\] does not
refrain from doing the creatures harm."

Yima, by his piety and devotion to the Creator, had enlisted the
services of the Good Spirit, and through him it was made manifest to him
that on this corporeal world snow, frost, and deluge would come. He was
warned of this disaster in time, and ordered to prepare an enclosure
large enough to hold cattle, beasts of burden, useful animals, men and
women, of the largest, best, and most beautiful kinds, together with
birds, red burning fires, and seeds of all kinds of trees—"all these in
pairs"—without any blemish or tokens of the Evil Spirit (Angro Mainyus).

Pious Yima, like Noah of old, benefited by this timely counsel, and
ultimately succeeded in saving the chosen creation, which formed his
ancient domain of Airyana-Vaêjâ.

One cannot help noting in the Zoroastrian Scriptures a certain
similarity to the later-day history of Noah and his ark. Spenta Mainyus

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

planted the seed of a good fruit-bearing tree, nourished it with water
of purity, cultivated it with honest industry and diligence, watched its
growth in divine contemplation of its blossoming forth good thoughts,
good words, and good deeds (*humata*, *hukhta*, and *havarahta*), when
from "the region of the North . . . forth rushed Angro Mainyus, the
deadly, the Daêva of the Daêvas," and with one chill blast of snow and
frost ("Falsehood" and "Wickedness," *vide* Avesta) smote and retarded
the rising sap of the growing tree. Thus, high from above, war was
declared between Good and Evil, between the Pious and the Wicked,
between Light and Darkness,—one preserving and the other smiting God's
glorified works.

A good portion of the Zoroastrian theology is directed towards
protecting mankind in his efforts to fight against Angro Mainyus and his
wicked accomplices.

"That one wish which Ahura-Mazda, the Lord, contemplates, as regards
men, is this, that 'Ye shall fully understand Me; for every one who
fully understands Me, comes after Me and strives for My
satisfaction.'" <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10.md)

Zoroaster, in order to stem the tide of destruction, went to the root of
the evil and laid the foundation-stone of his great moral philosophy,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

by making certain well-defined hygienic rules and regulations to
preserve the pastoral community from being totally destroyed by
pestilence, which we know as a visitation of God. In this brief sketch I
shall enumerate a few of them for the appreciation and due consideration
of my readers.

Putrefaction or decomposition, occasioned by the dead bodies, from which
thousands of untold evils may arise, was the first subject dealt with in
the sacred books of the Avesta. It is written, that directly death
occurs, the evil element of putrefaction, known in the Avesta language
as "Drukhs Naçus," takes possession of the dead body. In the figurative
language of the period, "Drukhs Naçus" (putrefaction) is personified
into a pernicious fly, full of filth and disease, and capable of
spreading great harm among the living creation. The duration of the
period at which it takes possession of the dead body greatly depends on
the nature and the cause of death. Modern medical science has nearly
elucidated this mystery of cadaverous rigidity and the exact time of the
putrefaction of the body. These have been graphically described in
Fargard VII. of the Vendidad.

Careful instructions are given as to the part of the house, and the
manner, in which the dead body should be kept, pending its ultimate
disposal; the place of its final rest, where it may

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

dissolve into its natural elements; the subsequent purification of the
place where the body may have lain in the house; the people who carry
the corpse; the clothes that may have come in contact with it; and the
purification of the flowing water in which the corpse may have been
found.

"Purity is the best thing for men after birth," says the Avesta. Those
who are desirous of further investigating the subject will be handsomely
repaid their trouble in perusing Fargards V., VI., VII., VIII., and IX.
of the Vendidad, wherein they will find scientific instructions as to
the germ theory and the preservation of the public health. Though
enunciated thousands of years ago, they are now carefully and minutely
followed by western nations in the twentieth century.

Next in order comes the command to cultivate the soil, to produce corn,
provender, and fruit-bearing trees, to irrigate dry land and drain the
marshes, and to populate the whole with men, cattle, and useful beasts
of burden. Zoroastrian philosophy shudders with horror at the
contemplation of the motherly earth being defiled by the burial therein
of dead bodies, and consequently means are devised of disposing of
corpses on high mountain tops by birds of prey or by the process of
nature. The modern Parsis, in accordance with the ancient regulations,
have devised Towers of Silence. The Parsis of Bombay are

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

grateful to their ancient prophet, who taught them the great hygienic
principle of sanitation.

During recent years it has saved them, a handful as they are, from the
bubonic plague. This great "Drukhs Naçus" carried away thousands of
natives, hour by hour and day by day, and yet signally failed in his
wholesale attack on the Parsis. The reason is obvious. The armour of
health, forged by Zoroaster during his pious contemplation of thirty
years’ duration on the mount "Ushidarena," and so fittingly worn by the
Parsis of the present day, is invulnerable to the attack of Angro
Mainyus and such of his satellites as "Drukhs Naçus." Strict ordinances
are made for the care and welfare of women during certain periods,
including those of gestation and child-birth, so that no injury may
happen in the latter instance to the parent and the offspring and to
those who have to assist at this great function of Nature.

Besides these, there are numerous directions as to observing cleanliness
in ordinary daily life, all tending to the care and purification of the
body and prevention of infectious diseases by contact.

"This is purity, O Zarathustra, the Mazdayasnian law.

"He who keeps himself pure by good thoughts, words, and works.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

"As to the right purity of one's own body, that is the purification of
every one in this corporeal world for his own state,

"When he keeps himself pure by good thoughts, words, and works." <span
id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md)

Having made men invulnerable to diseases, Zoroaster proceeded to look
after their morals. His moral philosophy deals with two attributes
inherent in man the Good Mind and the Evil Mind. These two are
allegorically termed "Vohumana" (the Good Mind) and "Akamana" (the Evil
Mind).

Thoughts, words, and deeds are liable to the influence of either
"Vohumana" (the Good Mind) or "Akamana" (the Evil Mind). Zoroaster has
summed up the whole of his moral philosophy in three expressive
words—"Humata" (good thoughts), "Hukhta" (good words), and "Hvarshta"
(good deeds). The way to heaven is laid through these three mystic
avenues, and the seeker of them is borne through with the
self-consciousness of having spent his allotted span of life to the use
and furtherance of God's good creation, and to His eternal glory.

"Turn yourself, not away from three best things—Good Thought, Good Word,
and Good Deed."

By "Good Thoughts," a Zoroastrian is able to concentrate his mind in
divine contemplation of

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

the Creator, and live in peace, unity, and harmony with his
fellow-brethren. For the love of his fellowmen, he is enjoined to
protect them in danger; to help them in need and want; to raise their
understanding in education; to enable them to enter into holy bonds of
matrimony; and to the best of his resources to enhance the prosperity
and welfare of the community of his brotherhood in particular, and of
all mankind in general.

By "Good Words," he is enjoined not to break his contract with others,
to observe honesty and integrity in all commercial transactions,
faithfully to pay back any borrowed money at the risk of being called a
thief, to prevent hurting the feelings of others, and to engender
feelings of love and charity in the Mazdayasnian fraternity.

By "Good Deeds," he is directed to relieve the poor, deserving and
undeserving, to irrigate and cultivate the soil, to provide food and
fresh water in places where needed, to encourage matrimony, and to
devote the surplus of his wealth in charity to the well-being and
prosperity of his co-religionists and others.

The Parsis of India are too well known for their disinterested charities
amongst the people of all denominations to need any eulogistic remarks
from me. It is a matter of great pride to me, as a Parsi, and a subject
of deep thankfulness to God, as one of His beings, that in this matter
my co-religionists in the East have truly

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

and faithfully, and with the utmost tolerance, distributed their wealth
in wise and useful charities, to lessen the sorrows and untold miseries,
and brighten the homes of our less fortunate brethren.

"I praise the well-thought sentiment, the well-spoken speech, the
well-performed action.

"I praise the good Mazdayasnian law, the free from doubt, removing
strife." <span id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md)

One can picture to himself the properly ordained household of a
Zoroastrian, who has carefully imbibed the abstract principles of
"Humata," "Hukhta," and "Hvarshta," and put them to practical purposes
in an ordinary workaday life.

Marriage is particularly recommended as a great factor towards leading a
religious and virtuous life, in addition to the social comforts of
physical, mental, and moral recreations. The household of a man 6f
well-regulated mind is his peaceful domain, wherein he is the lord with
his worthy consort, both entwined together and actuated by that
religious affinity which the Zoroastrian religion, by wise and
philosophical precepts, never fails to infuse. As the land improves by
fertilization, so should mankind by union, says the Zoroastrian
philosophy. One of the five things most pleasing to God, mentioned in
Fargard III. of the Vendidad, is that a holy

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

man should build himself a habitation, provide himself with a wife,
children, fire, and a herd of cattle. The husband is required to obey
the laws of health and be brave, to protect and preserve his family from
any outside violence, to be industrious, to provide them with
necessaries of life, to be tolerant, truthful, and chaste, and to
complete the domestic happiness of his family circle.

Chastity and implicit obedience from a wife to her husband are
considered to be the greatest virtues in a woman, the breach whereof
will be punished as a sin.

In every way, the wife is equal to her husband in social status,
enjoying perfect liberty of action. These wise domestic regulations are
so faithfully followed by the modern Parsis that misbehaviour or
misconduct of a woman is altogether conspicuous by its absence. Divorce
for misconduct is almost an unknown thing, and the writer cannot but
congratulate his community on the fact of total absence of women of
loose morals.

It is one of the ordinances of the faith that a father must look after
the spiritual and temporal education of his children, and bring them up
well fortified physically and morally to fight the battle of life with
perseverance, diligence, honesty, and integrity, thus enhancing the
reputation of his family and the honour of his community.

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

"May the desirable obedience come hither, for joy to the men and women
of Zarathustra." <span id="fr_13"></span>[\*](#fn_13.md)

Tolerance is another great feature of the Parsi faith. Though taught to
revere his own religion and despise and destroy idols and images, he is
also impressed with the idea of observing great tolerance and discretion
in passing judgment on the religious belief of others. Zoroaster himself
set the example of this excellent precept, whilst praising the soul
("Fravashi").

"The Fravashis of the pure men in all regions praise we." <span
id="fr_14"></span>[†](#fn_14.md)

It is evident that he prayed for all wise and holy men and women who
believed in God. That the same spirit exists to the present day, is
proved by the munificent gifts of the Parsis for charitable purposes to
people, irrespective of creed or caste, having for their sole object the
relief of mankind.

Strict as the law of chastity is, a great spirit of tolerance is shown
in the Avesta writing in reference to an unmarried woman, who happens to
fall a victim to the charms of an insidious man. True, it is a
punishable sin, yet the Almighty, in His mercy, has taken due notice of
such a misfortune happening in a household.

In the poetic language of the Avesta, it is laid down that a virgin, who
whilst under the protection of her parents, either betrothed or not

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

betrothed, is in a way to become a mother, should not for the very shame
of the act attempt to destroy herself. She must not add to the sin
already committed, a further and more heinous crime of self-destruction.
Further, she is forbidden, under the penalty of a grave sin, from
seeking to destroy the fruit of her body, either with the assistance of
her partner in the guilt or that of her parents in order to hide her
shame from the world. She must not seek, at the instigation of her
betrayer from the path of chastity, the assistance of "an old woman"
versed in herbology. The putative father must protect the unfortunate
partner of his guilt and the child.

Here is a tragic drama of the twentieth century, so of ten enacted in
our criminal courts, written and commented upon by Zoroaster in his
gospel, in the primitive pastoral age, at the beginning of the history
of the world. What thoughts, what deep moral philosophy, what superhuman
knowledge, must have been invoked by the great Iranian sage to soften
the hardships of life, by introducing a ray of heavenly mercy, of which
Tom Hood sang centuries after:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Take her up tenderly  
   Lift her with care;  
 Fashion’d so slenderly,  
   Young and so fair.</span>

</div>

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Touch her not scornfully;  
 Think of her mournfully,  
 Gently and humanly;  
   <span class="smallcaps">Not of the stains of her</span>—  
  All that remains of her  
 Now is pure womanly."</span>

</div>

The whole creation is placed under the guardianship of God as the head,
and six Ameshaspends (archangels). Ameshaspends are mystical guardian
spirits, who work night and day incessantly for the welfare and
protection of the creation committed to their charge by the Almighty.

God is the protector of man.

\(1\) Bahman is given the custody of all useful domestic animals and
birds.

\(2\) Ardibihist has the control of fire and life-giving heat.

\(3\) Shahrevar is the president of all kinds of metals and minerals.

\(4\) Aspandarmat is the custodian of the earth, with injunctions to
keep it fruitful, clean, and cultivated.

\(5\) Khordat has to see to the purity of water and water-courses.

\(6\) Amerdad tends to trees and vegetation.

With the assistance of Yazats (angels) night and day they police this
earth and guard their respective charges against the encroachment of the
Evil Spirit (Angro Mainyus).

Zoroaster, having dealt with the welfare of mankind, has not forgotten
lower animals in his

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

moral philosophy. Special regulations are laid down for their kind and
considerate treatment. He has recognized the necessity of slaughtering
animals for human food, prescribed which kinds of animals and birds are
fit for that purpose, and shown the most humane and expeditious methods
of killing them methods which, curiously enough, are now recommended and
adopted in this country by public authorities. Unnecessary slaughter is
forbidden, and shooting for mere pleasure is absolutely discountenanced.

One instance, woven in traditional Oriental imagery, will suffice to
convey the sentiments of the Parsis on this subject. The Over-Lord of
the herd of the domestic cattle (Geush-Urvan) raises his plaintive call
of heart-rending pathos to the Almighty Creator, and humbly beseeches
His intercession to alleviate the pain and sufferings his fellow-kind
have to undergo at the hand of men. The poor petitioner becomes aware of
the fact, that in accordance with the pre-arranged plan, his herd was
created for the support and advancement of the corporeal world; that it
is expected of them to furnish flesh food and milk, and to be useful to
the cultivator of the soil. In return men are enjoined, under penalty of
severe punishment, to be kind and attentive to their many wants, and
merciful in their necessary slaughter. The bovine leader is further
informed that Zoroaster, by sweetness of speech, will

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

assuage their sufferings and engender a benevolent spirit of humanity
amongst their cruel tormentors. The dumb petitioner, whose vision of
protection being limited to the sole aspiration of obtaining the support
of a powerfully armed warrior, is not able to understand that in many
instances persuasive and convincing words are far more potent than a
sharp-edged sword of the best tempered steel and more effective in their
purpose than the brute force of a salient blow.

As to kindness to dumb animals, the following passage from Patet
Erani <span id="fr_15"></span>[\*](#fn_15) (Khordah-Avesta.md) will show
what the Zoroastrians think:

"Of all kinds of sins which I have committed with reference to Heaven
against the Ameshaspend Bahman \[the protector of cattle\] with
reference to the world against the cattle and the various kinds of
cattle, if I have beaten it, tortured it, slain it wrongfully, if I have
not given it fodder and water at the right time, if I have castrated it,
not protected it from the robber, the wolf, and the waylayer, if I have
not protected it from extreme heat and cold, if I have killed cattle of
useful strength, working cattle, war-horses, rams, goats, cocks, and
hens, so that alike these good things and their protector Bahman have
been injured by me and not contented with me, I repent."

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

This merciful and ancient teaching does not call for the intervention of
any public society to prevent cruelty to animals, so far as the Parsis
are concerned. I humbly venture to suggest, that it is not the
imposition of fine or imprisonment by the Civil Law of the country that
deters the evil-doer. What is wanted, is a sound doctrine of moral
philosophy, as expounded by Zoroaster, preached and brought home to
these people by a carefully organised system. Man has conscience and a
soul to be saved; and, however hardened his nature may have become, it
is within the bounds of possibility to awaken him to his wickedness and
cowardice to dumb animals, who patiently and courageously work for him,
and are the means of procuring him ease and comfort in his worldly
existence.

Unlike other religions, it condemns fasting or total abstaining from
food as a wicked and a foolish act, which injures and enervates the
body.

"No one who does not eat, has strength to do works of holiness, strength
to do works of husbandry. By eating, every material creature lives; by
not eating, it dies away." <span id="fr_16"></span>[\*](#fn_16.md)

"With us the keeping of fast is this, that we keep fast from committing
sin with our eyes, and tongue, and ears, and hands, and feet. . . .

"Since I have spoken in this manner, and have

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

brought forward the fasting of the seven members of the body, that
which, in other religions, is fasting owing to not eating, is, in our
religion, fasting owing to not committing sin \[excess\]." <span
id="fr_17"></span>[\*](#fn_17.md)

Readers, such are a few salient principles of the Zoroastrian theology
of the Life on the Earth, which I now close by quoting from the
Vendidad:

"<span class="smallcaps">Increase, live the whole Time of thy Life,  
as long as thou wilt live.</span>" <span id="fr_18"></span>[†](#fn_18.md)

"<span class="smallcaps">Of the Life Hereafter</span>"

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Yet know, vain sceptics! know, th’ Almighty Mind,  
   Who breathed on man a portion of His fire  
 Bade his free soul, by earth nor time confined,  
   To heaven, to immortality aspire."</span>

</div>

Slowly and solemnly, now I approach this subject of great theological
mystery, of the migration from the known to the unknown universe.

". . . The worldly existence is, in the end, death, and disappearance,
and of the spiritual existence, in the end, that of a soul of the
righteous is undecaying, immortal, and undisturbed, full of glory and
full of enjoyment, for ever and everlasting, with the angels and
archangels and the guardian spirits of the righteous."

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

The hour of departure rings out in solemn silence, when the severance of
terrestrial friendship and unity which existed in him as a man must take
place—one to ascend, and the remnant to dissolve into its elements. The
scriptures of Zoroaster most vividly describe this solemn event, and
give evidence right through of the great belief in immortality of the
soul and the resurrection of the body.

At the glorious sunset of the pious life, the soul remains three days
near his lifelong friend the body, and perceives and "sees as much
joyfulness as the whole living world possesses." For him, the fourth day
dawns in *gloria in excelsis*. From the midst of his worldly nearest and
dearest relatives, friends, and neighbours, the soul, having been bidden
pious adieux in holy blessings, ascends in the company of his guardian
angel, Shros, to render his account at the gate of "Chinvat Bridge." In
his upward ethereal journey, floating in the region of the sweet-scented
balm of the south soft wind, he meets his own astral self, transformed
into a handsome figure of gracefulness and seraphic beauty. This figure
reveals itself to him as his Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds.
Pleased with his welcome, and having rendered his account to <span
class="smallcaps">Mehr Davar</span>, the recorder at the gate of Heaven,
he passes the barrier to eternal bliss and happiness, and awaits his
body on the great day

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

of resurrection. On the contrary, there is a drastic picture drawn of
the soul of a wicked man. It must suffer till the last day of the Great
Gathering, when everybody will be judged, the battle will end, the Evil
Spirit will no more have power to play man as a pawn, and there will be
everlasting peace—peace and happiness. The subject is a vast one, and
the space limited for this purpose does not permit me, as I should like,
to deal with it *in extenso*. I hope the extracts given on this subject
will interest the readers.

A sinful soul need never despair of mercy and forgiveness of God. Wicked
as he may have been, a due notice of any good deed done by him will be
taken into consideration by the Great Merciful. One of the numerous
questions asked by Zoroaster of Ahura-Mazda, was in reference to a man
whose body was feeling the torments of hell, with the exception of his
right foot. It was participating in the heavenly bliss and comfort. The
man was a wicked king in the world below, who ruled his country with
oppression, lawlessness, and violence. He was incapable of practising
any known virtue. One day, when he was out hunting for his pleasure, he
saw a goat, tethered to a stake, vainly trying to reach a morsel of hay.
The sight of a poor hungry beast straining at the rope kindled a spark
of mercy in his otherwise obdurate heart. Thus moved by a

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

sudden impulse, he, with his right foot, kicked the morsel of hay within
reach of the famished beast. The incident was duly recorded in the Book
of Fate, and the foot received its reward. This legend, savouring of
antiquity, and backed up by ancient authorities, reveals to a
Zoroastrian the sublime doctrine of reward and punishment.

After a youth has attained the age of fifteen and sought the Zoroastrian
Law, he is enjoined to be liberal in thoughts and deeds, pious, and
religious in ceremonial rites, just and wise as a ruler, truthful and
honest in his dealings, careful in keeping the elements pure and
undefiled, active in destroying evil, attentive to the care and want of
the domestic animals, industrious in cultivating and irrigating land,
persevering in education of himself and others, temperate in all
desires, and useful to mankind in promoting harmony, concord, and unity
amongst his kinsfolk, friends, and others. He must carefully weigh the
merits and demerits of every step he has to take on the path of life. If
by want of knowledge or ignorance, he does anything which turns out to
be a sinful act, he must, at the earliest possible opportunity, rectify
and remedy the same. From his early youth he is taught the belief that
all his good and evil deeds will be duly recorded; that with the flight
of time they will grow, multiply, and accumulate. On the day of the
ascension of his soul, the recording angel Mehr Davar will ask him to
render an

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

account of his short span of corporeal life, before bidding him enter
that place of supreme bliss, known to the modern Parsis as "Garothman
Behest."

Readers of this brief sketch might say that this is a philosophy
*couleur de rose*. Nay, ask yourselves the question, What has been
achieved by the teachings of Zoroaster? You will find that they have
brought peace and happiness to Parsi households; they have made them
loyal and peace-abiding subjects of the British Crown, and a benevolent
community to the people of the world; they have lessened pauperism,
crime, infamy, and immorality; they have made them a race worthy of its
proud traditions, which command the respect, confidence, and admiration
of those with whom they come in contact. It is very rare to find a Parsi
of a criminal instinct. Crime mania, if it can be designated as such,
has no suitable soil prepared for it to flourish in, in a Parsi
community. It must wither in its very inception, for the antidote
prepared by Zoroaster, and faithfully handed down from generation to
generation to his disciples and followers, has raised an effective
rampart against the approach of this foul and degrading instinct.

At the moment of writing this, a subject of vast importance to my
fellow-creatures in this country passes in review before me. In the
course of my professional duties I have been, on numerous

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

occasions, an unwilling spectator of many tragic dramas which are daily
enacted in our criminal Courts. Within a few yards of gaiety and
pleasure, prosperity and brilliancy, one can easily step into a
veritable slum life of this great metropolis, A poor, half-starved,
pale, and delicate-looking waif, bootless and hatless, with scarcely a
semblance of garments, spies your intrusion into his domain. It is sad
to contemplate his fate, his end, and his ultimate destination. This
fruit, of ill-conditioned parents, grows up to look upon society as his
natural foes to be preyed upon. Hardened and rendered callous by the
rigour of the criminal law, the nation has in him an utterly worthless
and a dangerous man. One asks, Has he heard a word of moral truth? Has
he been taught the moral philosophy? Has he acquired the conception of
God and Nature? Thoughtless, friendless, homeless, and Godless, he
roams, a prey to the Evil Mind (Akamana). In the next scene of life we
find him the willing slave of the devil (Angro Mainyus). One step
further and a sentence from the black-capped judge, is his reward; a
short delay, and then comes the end. Who can tell the terrible anguish,
the torturing thoughts, and the painful agonies of unrestrained remorse
of this wretched being, who is awakened and enlightened at the eleventh
hour by the ministration of some holy man of God? Sad to say, it is too
late for this earth. Standing on

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

the threshold of eternity for one brief moment, listening to the
soothing words of his own burial service, he mutely prays what? For
God's forgiveness for those who could have done better for him and his
wretched kind. Let me ring down the curtain in mercy to one more
miserable soul that has gone aloft to render his account.

It is not the fault of one class of men or the other; it is not the
fault of the clergy that God's superior and gifted animal has been
allowed to become a prey of the Evil Spirit and then hounded out of
existence by our law: it is the fault of our system, want of unity, of
proper charitable organisation, and of discriminate support by the
well-to-do and prosperous class. Were Zoroaster to visit this country, I
venture to say, that his first step in practical moral philosophy would
be to organize a national institution, where these poor waifs and strays
could be bent from their infancy to the righteous path of <span
class="smallcaps">Good Thoughts</span>, <span class="smallcaps">Good
Words</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Good Deeds</span>.

Then the nation will be rewarded by the sight of the sons of the soil,
marching in distant climes for the glory and honour of the British flag,
as soldiers of God and the King, and pioneers of the ever-extending
British Empire, as did their heroic brethren in Persia of old under the
victorious flag of illustrious Gāo. <span id="fr_19"></span>[\*](#fn_19.md)

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Resurrection</span>

I cannot do better than refer to the following passage in "Bundahis," on
this subject.

Zarathustra asked Ahura-Mazda, "Whence does a body form again which the
wind has carried and the water conveyed; and how does the resurrection
occur?"

Ahura-Mazda answered thus: "when through Me the sky arose from the
substance of the ruby, without columns, on the spiritual support of
far-compassed light; when through Me the earth arose, which bore the
material life, and there is no maintainer of the worldly creation but
it; when by Me the sun and moon and stars are conducted in the firmament
of luminous bodies; when by Me corn was created so that, scattered about
in the earth, it grew again and returned with increase; when by Me
colour of various kinds was created in plants; when by Me fire <span
id="fr_20"></span>[\*](#fn_20.md) was created in plants and other things
without combustion; when by Me a son was created and fashioned in the
womb of a mother, and the structure severally of the skin, nails, blood,
feet, eyes, ears, and other things was produced; when by Me legs <span
id="fr_21"></span>[†](#fn_21.md) were created for the water, so that it
flows away, and the cloud was created which carries the water of the
world and rains there where it has a

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

purpose; when by Me the air was created which conveys in one's eyesight,
through the strength of the wind, the lowermost upwards, according to
its will, and one is not able to grasp it with the hand outstretched;
each one of them, when created by Me, was herein more difficult than
causing the resurrection, for it is an assistance to Me in the
resurrection that they exist, but when they were formed it was not
forming the future out of the past."

According to the ancient "Bundahis," <span
id="fr_22"></span>[\*](#fn_22.md) at the time of the resurrection, the soul
will demand its original body out of the custody of the three known
elements the Earth, the Water, and the Fire. All the dead will rise with
consciousness of their good and evil deeds. At the Great Assembly, in
the presence of the righteous, they will penitently deplore their
misdeeds. Then will there be the separation of the righteous from the
wicked for three nights and days the wicked,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Full in the sight of Paradise,  
 Beholding Heaven and feeling Hell." <span
id="fr_23"></span>[†](#fn_23.md)</span>

</div>

The reign of terror, at the end of the stipulated time, vanishes into
oblivion, and its chief factor Ahriman goes to meet his doom of total
extinction,

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

whilst Ahura-Mazda the Omnipotent Victor remains the <span
class="smallcaps">Great All in All</span>.

After this great penance, God in His mercy prepares a bath of
purification, through which all pass, and arise in sanctified purity.
Hallowed and conscious of all ties of relationship and friendship which
existed in their terrestrial life, they glide, in company with the
hierarchy of Heaven, into the domain of Immortality for ever and
everlasting.

The memory of the dead is handed down, from generation to generation, in
religious ceremonies, which are periodically performed by the priests.
One incident I must mention before closing this sublime theme. On an
occasion somewhat similar to the Christian "All Souls" Day, the souls of
the Zoroastrians visit this sublunary earth once a year. Those, who have
participated in the ceremonies on these occasions, can but feel that
heavenly inspiration which becomes one's nature by faith and strict
pious devotion. During the period of this pious visit, every Parsi
household is thoroughly cleansed of the minutest impurity. In the best
room of the house, a place is set apart, full of choice sweet-scented
and fragrant flowers, and fruits—a perfect picture of peaceful
bliss—with fire of sandal-wood burning, and the priests and members of
the household, in the midst of a glorious illumination, chanting hymns
of glory to God and His creation, Let there be

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

no dissent from a picture so nobly grand and a ceremony so sublime, as
it is but an innocent homage to God's infinite blessings, and to us a
source of comfort to hold communion with and feel in spirit the presence
of those whom we have loved, respected, and adored—fathers and mothers,
wives, brothers and sisters, relations and friends—who have done their
duty and have gone before us, in accordance with the law, and with whom
we hope to mingle—the body, dust to dust, the soul, in eternal bliss of
"Garodemana." <span id="fr_24"></span>[\*](#fn_24.md)
