<p>4. We worship Sraosha, Obedience the blessed, and that lofty Lord who is Ahura Mazda Himself, Him who has attained the most to this our ritual, Him who has approached the nearest to us in our celebrations. And we worship all the words of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, and all the deeds well done (for him), both those that have been done (in times gone by),</p>

<p>For his splendour and his glory, for his might, which smites with victory, I will worship him with the Yasna of the Yazads, with a Yasna loud-intoned, him Obedience the blessed, with the consecrated waters, and the good Blessedness, the lofty, and Nairya-sangha, the stately, and may he come to us to aid us, he who smites with victory, Obedience the blessed!</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1238"></A><A HREF="sbe31062.htm#fr_1248">297:4</A> As Sraosha is the only divinity of the later groups mentioned in the first four G&acirc;thas, this Ya<I>s</I>t would seem to have claims to antiquity next after the pieces in the G&acirc;thic dialect. The name Sraosha does not appear to have lost its meaning as an abstract quality, notwithstanding the materialistic imagery. With Y. XXVIII, 6 in view, where Sraosha 'finds the way' to Ahura, or 'finds His throne,' we may understand that the worshippers, who first heard this Ya<I>s</I>t, praised listening obedience, or repentance, as they did nearly all the remaining abstract qualities, together with their principal prayers, and hymns themselves. The rhythm of the original has been somewhat imitated in the rendering given, as it is difficult to avoid doing so, and to avoid other objectionable features at the same time.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1239"></A><A HREF="sbe31062.htm#fr_1249">298:1</A> So 'tradition.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1240"></A><A HREF="sbe31062.htm#fr_1250">298:2</A> Sraosha was not reckoned as one of the Amesh&ocirc;spends at the time of the composition of this verse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1241"></A><A HREF="sbe31062.htm#fr_1251">298:3</A> Comp. Y. XXX, 4; but Ahura and some one of the Immortals, or possibly Zarathu<I>s</I>tra (see Y. XLII, 2), must be meant here. Angra Mainyu could not have been worshipped as either protector or creator. Observe the present tense.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1242"></A><A HREF="sbe31062.htm#fr_1252">299:1</A> Le Barsom est de cinq branches dans les Darouns ordinaires.

<P><A NAME="fn_1243"></A><A HREF="sbe31062.htm#fr_1253">299:2</A> This proves that the G&acirc;thas were greatly older than this Ya<I>s</I>t. That the G&acirc;thas were originally five seems improbable; yet they had become reduced to that number at this time.</P>
