### Footnotes

<span id="fn_936"></span>[213:2](sbe31026.htm#fr_941.md) The fact that
somewhat of a more technical sumatí, sûktá, suk*ri*tá adheres to these
expressions in this place must not for a moment induce us to suppose
that their deeper meaning was lost. All good thoughts, words, and deeds
culminated in the ritual, as in an enlightened high ecclesiasticism.
They were nourished by it, and not lest in it. (Expressions are here
varied.)

<span id="fn_937"></span>[213:3](sbe31026.htm#fr_943.md) The prominence and
supremacy of each deity, or genius, while he is especially the object of
worship in the ritual order, the expressions being taken from the
Ahuna-vairya.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[214:1](sbe31026.htm#fr_944.md) Vohu Manah, Asha,
and Khshathra.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[214:2](sbe31026.htm#fr_945.md) Âramaiti,
Haurvatâ*t*, and Ameretatâ*t*.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[214:3](sbe31026.htm#fr_946.md) It would seem that
the Yasna must have been at the time celebrated in the houses of the
worshippers. Hence perhaps some of the priests were pairi*g*athans.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[215:1](sbe31026.htm#fr_947.md) Dahyuma.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[215:2](sbe31026.htm#fr_948.md) Aibigaya.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[217:1](sbe31026.htm#fr_949) Unseized (?.md).

<span id="fn_944"></span>[218:1](sbe31026.htm#fr_950.md) Elsewhere with
slight verbal change.
