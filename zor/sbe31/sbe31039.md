### YASNA XVII.

#### TO THE FIRES, WATERS, PLANTS, &c.

1-10 <span id="fr_1090"></span>[1](#fn_1081.md), 11. We worship thee, the
Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son! We worship the fire Berezi-savangha (of the
lofty use <span id="fr_1091"></span>[2](#fn_1082).md), and the fire
Vohu-fryâna (the good and friendly <span
id="fr_1092"></span>[3](#fn_1083).md), and the fire Urvâzi*s*ta (the most
beneficial and most helpful <span id="fr_1093"></span>[4](#fn_1084).md),
and the fire Vâzi*s*ta (the most supporting <span
id="fr_1094"></span>[5](#fn_1085).md), and the fire Sp*e*ni*s*ta (the most
bountiful <span id="fr_1095"></span>[6](#fn_1086).md), and Nairya-sangha
the Yazad of the royal lineage <span id="fr_1096"></span>[7](#fn_1087.md),
and that fire which is the house-lord of all houses and Mazda-made, even
the son of Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the ritual order, with all the
fires.

12\. And we worship the good and best waters Mazda-made, holy, all the
waters Mazda-made and holy, and all the plants which Mazda made, and
which are holy.

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

13\. And we worship the Mãthra-spe*n*ta (the bounteous word-of-reason),
the Zarathu*s*trian law against the Daêvas, and its long descent.

14\. And we worship Mount Ushi-darena which is Mazda-made and shining
with its holiness, and all the mountains shining with holiness, and of
abundant glory, and which Mazda made—.

15\. And we worship the good and pious prayer for blessings, (16) and
these waters and (these lands), (17) and all the greatest chieftains,
lords of the ritual order <span id="fr_1097"></span>[1](#fn_1088.md);

18\. And I praise, invoke, and glorify the good, heroic, bountiful
Fravashis of the saints, those of the house, the Vîs, the Zantuma, the
Da*hv*yuma <span id="fr_1098"></span>[2](#fn_1089.md), and the
Zarathu*s*trôtema, and all the holy Yazads <span
id="fr_1099"></span>[3](#fn_1090.md)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[258:1](sbe31039.htm#fr_1090.md) See chapter VI,
which is nearly identical with XVII, 1-10.

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[258:2](sbe31039.htm#fr_1091.md) This fire is
that before Ahura Mazda and the kings.

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[258:3](sbe31039.htm#fr_1092.md) This fire dwells
in the bodies of men and beasts (animal heat).

<span id="fn_1084"></span>[258:4](sbe31039.htm#fr_1093.md) This is in trees
and plants.

<span id="fn_1085"></span>[258:5](sbe31039.htm#fr_1094.md) This in the
clouds (lightning).

<span id="fn_1086"></span>[258:6](sbe31039.htm#fr_1095.md) This is the fire
which is applied in the world (Bundahi*s*, West, page 61).

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[258:7](sbe31039.htm#fr_1096.md) That N. is here
referred to as connected with we fire, seems certain; this fire
corresponds with that of Vâhrâm in places of worship.

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[259:1](sbe31039.htm#fr_1097.md) 1-17 occur also
in MSS. as Y. LIX, 1-17.

<span id="fn_1089"></span>[259:2](sbe31039.htm#fr_1098.md) Dahyuma.

<span id="fn_1090"></span>[259:3](sbe31039.htm#fr_1099.md) The YêNhê hâtãm
follows.
