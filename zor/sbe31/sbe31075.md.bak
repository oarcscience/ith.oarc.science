### YASNA LXX (SP. LXIX).

#### TO THE BOUNTIFUL IMMORTALS, AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF RELIGION.

1\. I would worship these (the Bountiful Immortals) with my sacrifice,
those who rule aright, and who dispose (of all) aright, and this one
(especially) I would approach with my praise, (Ahura Mazda). He is thus
hymned (in our praise-songs). Yea, we worship in our sacrifice that
deity and lord, who is Ahura Mazda, the Creator, the gracious helper,
the maker <span id="fr_1367"></span>[1](#fn_1356.md) of all good things;
and we worship in our sacrifice Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma, that chieftain
(of the rite).

2\. And we would declare those institutions established for us, exact
(and undeviating as they are). And I would declare forth those of Ahura
Mazda, those of the Good Mind, and of Asha Vahi*s*ta (who is
Righteousness the Best), and those of Khshatra-vairya (the Realm to be
desired), and those of the Bountiful Âramaiti (the Piety within us), and
those of Weal and Immortality, and those which appertain to the
body <span id="fr_1368"></span>[2](#fn_1357.md) of the Kine, and to the
Kine's soul, and those which appertain to Ahura Mazda's Fire, (3) and
those of Sraosha (Obedience)

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

the blessed, and of Rashnu the most just, and those of Mithra of the
wide pastures, and of (the good and) holy Wind, and of the good
Mazdayasnian Religion, and of the good and pious Prayer for blessings,
and those of the good and pious Prayer which frees one from belying, and
the good and pious Prayer for blessing against unbelieving words <span
id="fr_1369"></span>[1](#fn_1358). 4. (And these we would declare.md) in
order that we may attain unto that speech which is uttered with (true)
religious zeal, or that we may be as prophets of the provinces, that we
may succour him <span id="fr_1370"></span>[2](#fn_1359.md) who lifts his
voice (for Mazda <span id="fr_1371"></span>[3](#fn_1360).md), that we may
be as prophets who smite with victory, the befriended of Ahura Mazda,
and persons the most useful to Him <span
id="fr_1372"></span>[4](#fn_1361), holy men (indeed.md) who think good
thoughts, and speak good words, and do good deeds. 5. That he may
approach us with the Good Mind <span id="fr_1373"></span>[5](#fn_1362.md),
and that (our souls) may advance in good, let it thus come; yea, 'how
may my soul advance in good? let it thus advance <span
id="fr_1374"></span>[6](#fn_1363.md).'

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

6\. We praise the flood and ebb of the good waters, and their roar, and
that high Ahura, the royal Apãm-napâ*t*, the glittering one, of the
fleet horses; and this for the sacrifice, and homage, and propitiation,
and praise of the entire holy creation; and may Sraosha (Obedience) be
here (to aid us). 7. (Yea), we sacrifice to Sraosha, Obedience the
blessed <span id="fr_1375"></span>[7](#fn_1364.md).
