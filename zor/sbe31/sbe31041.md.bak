### YASNA XIX.

#### ZAND OR COMMENTARY ON THE AHUNA-VAIRYA FORMULAS <span id="fr_1101"></span>[5](#fn_1092.md).

(As the Ahû is excellent, so (is) the Ratu (one who rules) from the
righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness and of life's actions done
for Mazda; and

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

the Kingdom (is) for Ahura which to the poor shall offer a nurturer.)

1\. Zarathu*s*tra asked of Ahura Mazda: O Ahura Mazda, Thou most
bounteous Spirit! maker <span id="fr_1102"></span>[1](#fn_1093.md) of the
corporeal worlds, the holy One! which was that word which Thou did’st
declare to me, (2) which was before the sky, and before the water,
before the earth, and before the cattle, before the plants, and before
the fire, and before the holy man, and the Demon-gods (the Daêvas),
before the Khrafstra-men <span id="fr_1103"></span>[2](#fn_1094.md), and
before all the incarnate world; even before all the good creatures made
by Mazda, and which contain (and are) the seed of righteousness?

3\. Thereupon Ahura Mazda said: It was this piece <span
id="fr_1104"></span>[3](#fn_1095.md), the Ahuna-vairya, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! which I pronounced as thine (4) before the sky, and
before the waters, before the land, and before the cattle and the
plants, and before the fire, Ahura Mazda's son, before the holy
man <span id="fr_1105"></span>[4](#fn_1096.md), and before the Daêvas, and
Khrafstra-men, and before the entire corporeal world, even before the
good creatures made by Mazda, which contain (and are) the seed of
righteousness.

5\. It was these part(s) of the Ahuna-vairya, O Spitama

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Zarathu*s*tra!
which especially belongs to me, and when each is intoned aloud without
the (needless) repetition <span id="fr_1106"></span>[1](#fn_1097.md) of
verses and of words, and without their omission, it is worth a hundred
of their other stanzas, even although they are prominent in the ritual,
and likewise equally as well recited without additions or omissions;
nay, further, when it is intoned imperfectly but added to, and with
omissions, it is even then in effect equivalent (not to a hundred
indeed, but) to ten other (stanzas) that are prominent.

6\. And whoever in this world of mine which is corporeal shall mentally
recall, O Spitâma\* Zarathu*s*tra! a portion of the Ahuna-vairya, and
having thus recalled it, shall undertone it, or beginning to recite it
with the undertone, shall then utter it aloud, or chanting it with
intoning voice, shall worship thus, then with even threefold (safety and
with speed <span id="fr_1107"></span>[2](#fn_1098).md) I will bring his
soul over the Bridge of *K*inva*t*, I who am Ahura Mazda (I will help
him to pass over it) to Heaven (the best life), and to Righteousness the
Best, and to the lights of heaven <span
id="fr_1108"></span>[3](#fn_1099.md).

7\. And whoever, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! while undertoning the part(s)
of the Ahuna-vairya (or this piece the Ahuna-vairya), takes ought
therefrom, whether the half, or the third, or the fourth, or the fifth,
I who am Ahura Mazda will draw his soul off

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

from the better world; yea, so far off will I withdraw it as the earth
is large and wide; \[and this earth <span
id="fr_1109"></span>[1](#fn_1100.md) is as long as it is broad <span
id="fr_1110"></span>[2](#fn_1101.md)\].

8\. And I pronounced this saying which contains its Ahû and its
Ratu <span id="fr_1111"></span>[3](#fn_1102.md) before the creation of this
heaven, before the making of the waters, and the plants, and the
four-footed kine, before the birth of the holy biped man, before this
sun with its body made for the acquisition of the creation of the
Bountiful Immortals <span id="fr_1112"></span>[4](#fn_1103.md).

9\.  <span id="fr_1113"></span>[5](#fn_1104.md)And the more bountiful <span
id="fr_1114"></span>[6](#fn_1105) of the two Spirits (Ahura.md) declared to
me <span id="fr_1115"></span>[7](#fn_1106) (Zarathu*s*tra.md) the entire
creation of the pure, that which exists at present, that which is in the
course of emerging into existence <span
id="fr_1116"></span>[8](#fn_1107.md), and that which shall be, with
reference to the performance and realisation 'of the actions of a life
devoted to Mazda <span id="fr_1117"></span>[9](#fn_1108.md).'

10\. And this word is the most emphatic of the words which have ever
been pronounced, or which are <span id="fr_1118"></span>[10](#fn_1109.md)
now spoken, or which shall be spoken in future; for (the eminence of)
this utterance is a thing of such a nature, that if all the corporeal
and living world

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

should learn it, and learning should hold fast by it, they would be
redeemed from their mortality!

11\. And this our word I have proclaimed as a symbol to be learned <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[1](#fn_1110.md), and to be recited, as it were, to
every one of the beings under the influence of and for the sake of
Righteousness the Best.

12\. And 'as' (the worshipper has) here spoken it forth, when he has
thus 'appointed' the 'Lord and regulator <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[2](#fn_1111.md),' so (by thus reciting these
authoritative words), he acknowledges Ahura Mazda (as prior to, and
supreme) over, those creatures who have 'the mind' <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[3](#fn_1112.md) as their first. 'As' he acknowledges
Him as the greatest of them all, 'so' he assigns the creatures to Him
(as to their originator).

13\. As he undertones the third sentence, he thereby announces that ‘all
the amenities of life appertain to the 'good' Mazda <span
id="fr_1122"></span>[4](#fn_1113), (and come.md) from Him. As he recites
'dazda mananghô,' 'the creator of mind,' he acknowledges Him as superior
and prior to mind; and as he makes Him the one who indicates (the truth)
to mind, (saying) 'mananghô of mind,' which means that by this much he
makes Him (its director), and then he makes Him 'the lord of
actions <span id="fr_1123"></span>[5](#fn_1114.md).'

14\. And when he acknowledges Him for the creatures thus, 'O Mazda <span
id="fr_1124"></span>[6](#fn_1115.md)!' he acknowledges Him (as

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

their ruler) when he assigns the creatures to Him thus. He then assigns
the Kingdom to Ahura <span id="fr_1125"></span>[1](#fn_1116.md), saying:
'Thine, O Mazda! is the Kingdom.' And he assigns a nourisher and
protector to the poor, saying: Yim drigubyô dada*t* vâstârem; that is,
as a friend to Spitama <span id="fr_1126"></span>[2](#fn_1117.md). This is
the fifth sentence, (and it concludes) the entire recital and word,
(even) the whole of this word of Ahura Mazda <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[3](#fn_1118.md).

15\. He who is the best (of all) Ahura Mazda, pronounced the
Ahuna-vairya, and as He pronounced it as the best, so He caused it to
have its effect <span id="fr_1128"></span>[4](#fn_1119), (He, ever.md) the
same, (as He is).

The evil one at once <span id="fr_1129"></span>[5](#fn_1120.md) arose (to
oppose Him), but He (Ahura) repelled that wicked one with His interdict,
and with this repelling renunciation: Neither our minds are in harmony,
nor our precepts, nor our comprehensions, nor our beliefs, nor our
words, nor our actions, nor our consciences, nor our souls <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[6](#fn_1121.md)!

CATECHETICAL ZAND <span id="fr_1131"></span>[7](#fn_1122.md).

16\. And this saying, uttered by Mazda, has three stages, or
measures <span id="fr_1132"></span>[8](#fn_1123.md), and belongs to four
classes (of men as its supporters), and to five chiefs (in the political
world, without whom its efficiency is

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

marred), and it has a conclusion ending with a gift. (Question.) How are
its measures (constituted)? (Answer.) The good thought, the good word,
and the good deed. 17. (Question.) With what classes of men? (Answer.)
The priest, the charioteer (as the chief of warriors), the systematic
tiller <span id="fr_1133"></span>[1](#fn_1124.md) of the ground, and the
artisan <span id="fr_1134"></span>[2](#fn_1125.md). These classes therefore
accompany the religious man throughout his entire duty <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[3](#fn_1126.md) with the correct thought, the truthful
word, and the righteous action. These are the classes and states in life
which give attention to the rulers <span
id="fr_1136"></span>[4](#fn_1127), and fulfil the (laws.md) of religion;
(yea, they are the guides and companions of that religious man) through
whose actions the settlements are furthered in righteousness.

18\. (Question.) How are the chiefs (constituted)? (Answer.) They are
the house-chief, the village-chief, and the tribe-chief, the chief of
the province, and the Zarathu*s*tra <span
id="fr_1137"></span>[5](#fn_1128.md) as the fifth. That is, so far as those
provinces are concerned which are different from, and outside of the
Zarathu*s*trian regency, or domain. \[Ragha <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[6](#fn_1129) which has four chiefs (only.md) is the
Zarathu*s*trian (district)\]. (Question.) How are the chiefs of this one
constituted? (Answer.) They (are) the house-chief, the village-chief,
the tribe-chief, and the Zarathu*s*tra as the fourth. 19. (Question.)
What is the thought well thought? (Answer.) (It is that which the holy
man thinks), the one who holds the holy thought to be before all other
things <span id="fr_1139"></span>[7](#fn_1130). (Question..md)

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> What is the word
well spoken? (Answer.) It is the Mãthra Spe*n*ta <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[1](#fn_1131.md), the bounteous word of reason.
(Question.) What is the deed well done? (Answer.) It is that done with
praises <span id="fr_1141"></span>[2](#fn_1132.md), and by the creatures
who regard Righteousness as before all other things. 20. (Question.)
Mazda made a proclamation, whom did He announce? (Answer.) Some one who
was holy, and yet both heavenly and mundane <span
id="fr_1142"></span>[3](#fn_1133). (Question..md) What was His character,
He who made this sacred enunciation? (Answer.) He who is the best (of
all), the ruling one. (Question.) Of what character (did He proclaim him
the coming one)? (Answer.) As holy and the best, a ruler who exercises
no wanton or despotic power <span id="fr_1143"></span>[4](#fn_1134.md).

21\. We sacrifice to the (several) part(s) of the Ahuna-vairya. We
sacrifice to the memorised recital of the Ahuna-vairya, and its regular
chanting and its use in the full Yasna.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1092"></span>[259:5](sbe31041.htm#fr_1101.md) The obvious
errors contained in this ancient comment cannot <span id="page_260">p.
260</span> destroy its great interest as a specimen of early exegesis.
Where I hold it to be erroneous may be seen from my rendering of the
Ahuna without further observations. The Ahuna-vairya is in the Gâthic
dialect, and the Ahunavaiti metre. This Zand is in the Zend (sic). Ahû
gives better sense as a nom.

<span id="fn_1093"></span>[260:1](sbe31041.htm#fr_1102.md) See
d*a*unghôi*t* para below.

<span id="fn_1094"></span>[260:2](sbe31041.htm#fr_1103.md) May not
khrafstra be a degeneration from kehrp-astar? While the term may be
applied to wild beasts, one is strongly inclined to hold that foul
insects are chiefly referred to.

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[260:3](sbe31041.htm#fr_1104.md) This part of the
Ahuna (?), meaning its several parts.

<span id="fn_1096"></span>[260:4](sbe31041.htm#fr_1105.md) Tradition
naturally specifies Gaya Maretan.

<span id="fn_1097"></span>[261:1](sbe31041.htm#fr_1106.md) I do not think
that mispronunciation is here intended; the Pahlavi has abarâ shûtakîh;
aîgha*s* barâ lâ khelmûnê*d*; Ner. na *s*ete. I am strongly inclined to
read anapashûta for anapishûta.

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[261:2](sbe31041.htm#fr_1107.md) Three times
seems to me to lack meaning, but it may have given rise to a foolish
belief that the soul went three times before death to heaven.

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[261:3](sbe31041.htm#fr_1108.md) Vahi*s*taêibyô
retaining this sense here.

<span id="fn_1100"></span>[262:1](sbe31041.htm#fr_1109.md) Îm here equals
iyám.

<span id="fn_1101"></span>[262:2](sbe31041.htm#fr_1110.md) Pâzand.

<span id="fn_1102"></span>[262:3](sbe31041.htm#fr_1111.md) So, referring to
the wording of the Ahuna.

<span id="fn_1103"></span>[262:4](sbe31041.htm#fr_1112.md) Enabling us to
receive the blessings which they bestow through the influence of the
sun. 'The sun-shaped matter' would give us a materialism. The Pahlavi
has 'levînŏ min zak khurkhshê*d*ŏ brînŏ (?) kerpŏ tanû î khûrkhshê*d*
pavan barâ ayâpakîh î ameshnspendânŏ yehabûn*d*.'

<span id="fn_1104"></span>[262:5](sbe31041.htm#fr_1113.md) I hold that
Ahura speaks no further here.

<span id="fn_1105"></span>[262:6](sbe31041.htm#fr_1114.md) See Y. XLV, 1.

<span id="fn_1106"></span>[262:7](sbe31041.htm#fr_1115.md) Of course
fictitious, as Z. had long been among the dead.

<span id="fn_1107"></span>[262:8](sbe31041.htm#fr_1116.md) Does
bavai*n*ti*k*a mean 'past?'

<span id="fn_1108"></span>[262:9](sbe31041.htm#fr_1117.md) Through the
state of action; *s*kyaothananãm angheu*s* Mazdâi.

<span id="fn_1109"></span>[262:10](sbe31041.htm#fr_1118) Can mruyê(-vê.md)
be a third singular like ghnê, isê?

<span id="fn_1110"></span>[263:1](sbe31041.htm#fr_1119.md) Or, 'it has been
declared to us, the learner, and the one in charge of the ritual.'

<span id="fn_1111"></span>[263:2](sbe31041.htm#fr_1120.md) In the words
yathâ ahû vairyô, athâ ratu*s*.

<span id="fn_1112"></span>[263:3](sbe31041.htm#fr_1121.md) See dazda
mananghô, coming 'before' *s*kyaothananãm angh*e*u*s*, khshathrem, and
vâstârem.

<span id="fn_1113"></span>[263:4](sbe31041.htm#fr_1122.md) Can the Ahuna
have lost words, and is Mazd*a*u hu*g*itî*s* vangh*e*u*s* a citation? At
ally events, the Zandist errs in separating vangh*e*u*s* from mananghô.
He attributes mystical meaning to every word.

<span id="fn_1114"></span>[263:5](sbe31041.htm#fr_1123.md) Comp.
aha-*s*kyaothananãm.

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[263:6](sbe31041.htm#fr_1124.md) Reading Mazda
(?).

<span id="fn_1116"></span>[264:1](sbe31041.htm#fr_1125.md) Khshathrem*k*â
Ahurâi â.

<span id="fn_1117"></span>[264:2](sbe31041.htm#fr_1126.md) As having the
interest of the poor at heart.

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[264:3](sbe31041.htm#fr_1127.md) Supposing Ahura
(?) to be meant by Ahû and Ratu; see Mazdâi Ahurâi. The Zandist may have
rendered: As Ahura is the (first) to be chosen, so He is our Ratu from
His righteousness, the creator of Vohûman (including all good
creatures), &c.

<span id="fn_1119"></span>[264:4](sbe31041.htm#fr_1128) 'Praised' (?.md).

<span id="fn_1120"></span>[264:5](sbe31041.htm#fr_1129.md) Reading
haithwa*t*; Pahlavi tîz; possibly 'being present.'

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[264:6](sbe31041.htm#fr_1130.md) See Y. XLV, 2.

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[264:7](sbe31041.htm#fr_1131.md) This Zand
differs, as to the application of Ahû and Ratu, from the former.

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[264:8](sbe31041.htm#fr_1132.md) Afsman elsewhere
applies to metre.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[265:1](sbe31041.htm#fr_1133.md) These are 'the
poor,' but not mendicants.

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[265:2](sbe31041.htm#fr_1134.md) A class not in
the Gâthas; observe the rise of a caste system.

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[265:3](sbe31041.htm#fr_1135.md) Or,
'experience.'

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[265:4](sbe31041.htm#fr_1136.md) Or, 'the
ritual.'

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[265:5](sbe31041.htm#fr_1137.md) The title of a
governor.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[265:6](sbe31041.htm#fr_1138.md) It did not need
the fifth. It was a centre of rule.

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[265:7](sbe31041.htm#fr_1139.md) Ashavan manas
paoiryô.

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[266:1](sbe31041.htm#fr_1140.md) Probably the
Gâthas with their lost portions, also the Vendîdâd.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[266:2](sbe31041.htm#fr_1141.md) Ritual
strictness based upon practical piety.

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[266:3](sbe31041.htm#fr_1142.md) The Saoshya*n*t.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[266:4](sbe31041.htm#fr_1143.md) The latter part
of this Zand shows that the Ratu was recognised as a human ruler in it.
