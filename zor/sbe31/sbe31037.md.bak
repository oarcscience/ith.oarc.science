### YASNA XV (SP. XVI).

#### THE SACRIFICE CONTINUES.

1\. With precept, praise, and with delight produced by grace <span
id="fr_1075"></span>[3](#fn_1067.md), I call upon the Bountiful Immortals
the good, and also therewith the beautiful by name <span
id="fr_1076"></span>[4](#fn_1068.md); and I sacrifice to them with the
blessing of the good ritual, with the earnest blessings of the good
Mazdayasnian Faith.

2\. Whose best gift from his Righteousness is mine in the offering Ahura
this knoweth; who have lived, and live ever, by their names these I
worship, while I draw near with praises <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[5](#fn_1069.md). The Good Kingdom is to be chosen,
that lot which most of all bears on (our blessings <span
id="fr_1078"></span>[6](#fn_1070).md).

3\. Let Sraosha (Obedience) be here present for

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

the sacrifice of Ahura Mazda, the most beneficent, the holy, who is so
dear to us as at the first, so at the last; yea, let him be present
here <span id="fr_1079"></span>[1](#fn_1071.md).

4\. As the Ahû (revered and) to be chosen, the Âtarevakhsha thus speaks
forth to me.

(Response): So let the Ratu from his righteousness, holy and learned,
speak forth!
