*The Zend Avesta, Part III (SBE31)*, L.H. Mills, tr. \[1886\], at

### YASNA LIV <span id="fr_1234"></span>[2](#fn_1224) (SP. LIII.md).

#### THE AIRY*E*MÂ-ISHYÔ.

1\. Let the Airyaman, the desired friend and peers-man, draw near for
grace to the men and to the women who are taught of Zarathustra, for the
joyful grace of the Good Mind, whereby the conscience may attain its
wished-for recompense. I pray for the sacred reward of the ritual order
which is (likewise so much) to be desired; and may Ahura Mazda
grant <span id="fr_1235"></span>[3](#fn_1225.md) it, (or cause it to
increase).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2\. We sacrifice to the Airy*e*mâ-ishyô, the powerful; the victoriously
smiting, the opponent of assaulting malice, the greatest of the
sentences of the holy ritual order. And we sacrifice to the bounteous
Gâthas that rule supreme in the ritual, the holy (and august). And we
sacrifice to the Praises of the Yasna which were the productions of the
world of old <span id="fr_1236"></span>[4](#fn_1226.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1224"></span>[293:2](sbe31059.htm#fr_1234.md) This piece in
the Gâthic dialect, and in a metre supposed by some to be identical with
that of the Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti, is very old, and ranks with the
Ahuna-vairya and Ashem Vohû in importance.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[293:3](sbe31059.htm#fr_1235.md) Or, can masatâ
(sic) equal 'with his liberality, or majesty,' leaving ya*n*tu to be
understood with Ahurô?

<span id="fn_1226"></span>[293:4](sbe31059.htm#fr_1236.md) The later Avesta
notes the antiquity of the older.
