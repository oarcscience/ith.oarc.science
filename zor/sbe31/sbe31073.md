### YASNA LXVIII (SP. LXVII).

#### TO THE AHURIAN ONE, AND THE WATERS.

1\. We offer this to thee, O Ahurian (daughter) of Ahura! as a
help <span id="fr_1354"></span>[1](#fn_1343) (?.md) for life. If we have
offended thee, let this Zaothra then attain to thee (for satisfaction),
for it is thine with its Haoma, and its milk, and its Hadhânaêpata. 2.
And may’st thou approach to me for milk and for libation, O Zaothra! as
health, for healing, and for progress, for growth and in preparation for
ceremonial merit, for good renown, for equanimity <span
id="fr_1355"></span>[2](#fn_1344.md), and for that victory which makes the
settlements advance.

3\. Yea, we worship thee with sacrifice, O thou Ahurian (daughter) of
Ahura with the Zaothras of the good thought; and we worship, O Ahura,
one with the Zaothras of the good word and deed (4) for the
enlightenment of the thoughts, and words, and actions, for preparation
for the soul, for the settlement's advance, and to prepare the saints
endowed with ritual merit.

5\. And grant me, O thou Ahurian One! Heaven, and to have an offspring
manly and legitimate, who may promote my house, my village, my tribe and
province, and the authority thereof.

6\. We sacrifice to thee, O thou Ahurian one! And we sacrifice to the
sea Vouru-kasha, and to all waters upon earth, whether standing, or
running, or waters of the well, or spring-waters which perennially

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

flow, or the drippings of the rains, or the irrigations of canals. 7.
With this hymn from the (spirit of) the Yasna do we worship thee, and
with the homage which it offers, as it is the most legitimate <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1](#fn_1345) Yasna, and homage of them (all.md)
because of Righteousness the Best. We sacrifice to the good waters, and
to the best, which Mazda created. 8. And we sacrifice to the two, to the
milk and to the libation, which make the waters flow, and the plants
sprout forth, opposing therein the Dragon Daêva-made, for the arrest of
that cheat the Pairika, and to contradict the insulting malice of the
Ashemaogha (the disturber and destroyer of our Faith), and of the unholy
tyrant full of death, and of the human Daêva (worshipper) of hateful
malice (and intent).

9\. And may’st thou hear our sacrificial chants, O thou Ahurian
(daughter) of Ahura! Yea, be propitiated by our Yasna, O Ahurian one!
and so may’st thou be present <span id="fr_1357"></span>[2](#fn_1346.md) at
our Yasna; may’st thou come to us to help, as we chant our full-offered
Ya*s*t, with the full offering of Zaothras.

10\. If any man shall sacrifice to you, O ye good waters, the Ahurian
ones of Ahura! with the best and most fitting Zaothras offered piously,
(11) to that man ye give both splendour and glory, with health and
vigour of the body and prominence of form; yea, to him ye give
possessions which entail abundant glory, and a legitimate scion, and a
long enduring life, and (Heaven at the last), the best life of the
saints, shining, all glorious. 12. And to me also do ye now give it, to
*m*e who am offering this Yasna as a priest <span
id="fr_1358"></span>[3](#fn_1347.md).

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

(Response <span id="fr_1359"></span>[1](#fn_1348)..md) And to us
Mazdayasnians who are likewise offering sacrifice, do ye grant (both the
desire and knowledge of the path that is correct <span
id="fr_1360"></span>[2](#fn_1349).md), to us colleagues, and disciples,
Aêthrapaitis and Aêthryas, men and women as well as children, and
maidens of the field, (13) who think good only, for the overwhelming of
oppression and of malice in the raids of the invader, and in face of
foes who hate. Grant to us both the desire <span
id="fr_1361"></span>[3](#fn_1350.md) of, and the knowledge of that
straightest path, the straightest because of Righteousness, and of
(Heaven) the best life of the Saints, shining, all glorious. As the Ahû
is excellent, so is the Ratu (one who rules) from the Righteous Order, a
creator of mental goodness and of life's actions done for Mazda. And the
kingdom (is) for Ahura, which to the poor may offer nurture. 14. (The
Zaotar speaks): I beseech with my benediction for a safe abode, for a
joyful and a long abode for the dwellers in this village from whence
these Zaothras (which I offer come). And I pray in my benediction for a
safe abode, and a quiet and a joyful one, and a long abiding to every
Mazdayasnian village, and for a succour even with my wants, for a
succour with salutations of salvation, and for one with praises, O
Fire <span id="fr_1362"></span>[4](#fn_1351.md)! and for thee, O Ahurian
one of Ahura! do I ask the fullest Ya*s*t.

15\. And I pray for (?) Râman *Hv*âstra for this Province, and for
healthfulness and healing. And I pray for it with my blessing for you
pious men, for all. And I pray for him who is saintly with (true)
goodness, whosoever he may be, between heaven

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

and the earth, for a thousand healing remedies, and for ten thousand of
the same.

16-19. (See Y. VIII, 5-8.) 20. Thus may it happen as I pray. 21. And by
this may I gain <span id="fr_1363"></span>[1](#fn_1352) (that.md) blessing,
the good Blessedness (our sanctity rewarded). And we address, and we
invoke religious zeal and capability, and the waters with our
Yasna <span id="fr_1364"></span>[2](#fn_1353.md) thus: O ye good waters!
since (they are) yours, do ye, as you are asked, grant splendour and
grant glory, ye who are well able so to give; and do ye, O ye waters!
grant (once more) that helpful blessing which was gained from you of
old!

22\. Praise (be) to Ahura Mazda, and to the Bountiful Immortals. Praise
(be) to Mithra of the wide pastures. Praise to the fleet-horsed sun.
Praise to (the star which so we name, and with this sun) Ahura Mazda's
eyes. Praise to the Kine <span id="fr_1365"></span>[3](#fn_1354.md) (the
herds of blessed gift). Praise to Gaya (Maretan) and to the Fravashi of
Zarathu*s*tra (first of) saints; yea, praise to the entire creation of
the holy (and the clean), to those now living, and to those just passing
into life, and to those of days to come. 23. And do Thou then Ahura, as
in answer to these our prayers and songs of praise, cause us to prosper
to salvation through Thy Good Mind, the Sovereign Power, and Thy
Righteous Order (in Thy ritual and law <span
id="fr_1366"></span>[4](#fn_1355).md)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1343"></span>[321:1](sbe31073.htm#fr_1354.md) The Pahlavi
translator saw the root av in this sense here with K4, 11; P6, but the
form is strange.

<span id="fn_1344"></span>[321:2](sbe31073.htm#fr_1355.md) So the Pahlavi
indicates with no impossible suggestion.

<span id="fn_1345"></span>[322:1](sbe31073.htm#fr_1356.md) Or 'virtuous,'
with Darmesteter.

<span id="fn_1346"></span>[322:2](sbe31073.htm#fr_1357.md) May’st thou sit.

<span id="fn_1347"></span>[322:3](sbe31073.htm#fr_1358.md) Zôtŏ î ya*s*tar
hômanam.

<span id="fn_1348"></span>[323:1](sbe31073.htm#fr_1359.md) Or, 'the priest
continues speaking for the people.'

<span id="fn_1349"></span>[323:2](sbe31073.htm#fr_1360.md) See below.

<span id="fn_1350"></span>[323:3](sbe31073.htm#fr_1361.md) Or, 'this
desire, the knowledge.'

<span id="fn_1351"></span>[323:4](sbe31073.htm#fr_1362.md) Or, 'of the
Fire'

<span id="fn_1352"></span>[324:1](sbe31073.htm#fr_1363.md) Or, 'the good
wisdom' from the second dâ (good adjustment).

<span id="fn_1353"></span>[324:2](sbe31073.htm#fr_1364.md) Passages follow
from Y. XXXVIII, 2-5.

<span id="fn_1354"></span>[324:3](sbe31073.htm#fr_1365.md) The Gâthic Kine.

<span id="fn_1355"></span>[324:4](sbe31073.htm#fr_1366.md) See Y. XXXIII,
10. Citations follow from Y. XXXVI, 6; Y. XLIII, 6, also the Ashem and
Y. III, 24, 25; then Y. XLVII, 1-7. Then the words 'we worship the
chapter Spe*n*tâ-mainyu from the beginning,' then the YêNhê hâtãm.
