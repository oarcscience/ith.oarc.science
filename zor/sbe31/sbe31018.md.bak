### YASNA XLVIII.

#### ANTICIPATED STRUGGLES AND PRAYERS FOR CHAMPIONS AND DEFENDERS.

This chapter divides itself quite naturally into sections. 1-4 belong
together, then 5 and 6, 7 seems less closely connected; then follows
8-12.

1\. A struggle is evidently at hand, whether the same as that to which
allusion is more than once made, by incitation, as in Y. XXXI, 18; with
anxious expectation, as in Y. XLIV, 15, 16; or as if in a sense of
victory, as in Y. XLV, 1; or of defeat, as in Y. XLIX, is difficult, or
rather impossible to determine. But with the verses 10, 11, 12 in view,
together with the dispirited, Y. XLIX, 1, we shall say at once that, if
this verse was intended to connect with them, an armed struggle had been
expected, whether the decisive one or not, we need not say.

The saint, that is, the pious adherent to the Holy Order, whatever may
be the result of the preliminary struggles, is encouraged by a view of
the end. 2. But the burdened worshipper craves still further reassurance
before the storms of battle came once more upon him. 3. For little as
the assurances of Ahura are valued

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

by the heretic, to the man who understands the true relations, what
Ahura declares by means of His inspired prophets, the secret-announcers,
this is, of all things, best; (he need not ask as elsewhere, Y. XXXI,
17). 4. And whoever would hope for spiritual growth and purity must turn
his mind to that word of the Deity, and pursue its teachings faithfully,
and so at last his fears will vanish, for his doubts will disappear. He
will understand as the Lord has taught.

5\. This verse seems a prayer to Âramaiti; when the long struggles shall
have found their issues, and the one party or the other wins the day,
let not that party be the evil alliance with its monarch. For, if the
government is set up, and carried on with all the prescribed ceremonial
and moral exactness of the wise *K*isti; if men who toil for the sacred
Kine, and with the virtue of those who cultivate her, hold the reins of
power, and can so suppress the predatory raids on defenceless, as well
as unoffending victims, then no gift of Ahura, since the tribes became a
nation, could be looked upon as a greater, or as so great a blessing, as
the correct Authority, and the Order of the Faith.

6\. For that sacred Kine, as so often already implied or stated, was all
in all to the pious worshipper. It was she, representing, as she did,
all wealth in herds, who alone could sustain the home-life of happy
industry. And this is the reason why Ahura had originally caused the
herbage to grow for her support.

7\. Urging the overthrow of the spirit of Rapine in accordance with the
Kine's complaint, he exhorts the armed masses to energetic and offensive
valour.

8\. He then vehemently, although only rhetorically, asks how he may use
the proper prayers to rally the needed coadjutors among the chiefs (Y.
XLVI, 9) to carry on the struggle. 9. Again he utters a cry for relief
in his suspense, and of entreaty for light as to the rewards, which did
not concern this life for its own sake (verse 1) merely or chiefly; but
which were spiritual blessings received here in preparation for the
spiritual world. 10. 'When,' he repeats as one among similar questions
four times repeated, 'when shall the ideal men appear whose thoughtful
plans (Y. XLVI, 3) shall drive hence the polluted schemes of the false
priests and of the tyrants (Y. XLVI, 1)? 11. And when shall Âramaiti,
the kindly piety of home, appear, she who, like the earth, spreads
pastures for the peaceful kine, when shall she appear with holy
Khshathra (later well called an angel, or archangel) the personified
Authority of God over home and state, without which

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

an anarchy as bad as that of the Evil Authority (verse 5) might continue
or recur; and who was the champion-chief who would give them peace
through blood (Y. XLVI, 4; LIII, 9)? In a word, to whom, as to the
coadjutors of such a leader, would the light of reason, and the true
faith come to inspire and to guide them?' 12. There is but one only
class of human combatants whom he would thus match against that Demon of
furious Rapine (v. 6), toward whom the evil on their part at their first
creation rushed as to their leader (Y. XXX, 6), and these are the saving
Saoshya*n*ts, the vicegerents of the Immortals upon earth, the religious
princes Vî*s*tâspa, *G*âmâspa, Frashao*s*tra, and with them, as the
greatest among all, he who was, with much probability, the speaker in
the passage, that is, the Ratu appointed by Ahura for the kine and for
men, Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma elsewhere and later called, with hyperbole,
the first tiller, warrior, and priest.

Translation.

1\. If through his action <span id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_677.md) in the
offering of gifts in accordance with the Righteous Order, (Thy
saint <span id="fr_679"></span>[2](#fn_678).md) shall smite the
Demon-of-the-Lie (the inspiring spirit of our foes), when that in very
truth shall come <span id="fr_680"></span>[3](#fn_679.md), which has been
(and is still yet) proclaimed as a deceit <span
id="fr_681"></span>[4](#fn_680), (when it shall come.md) in the Immortal
life, regarding (as it does both) men (to bless), and Daêvas <span
id="fr_682"></span>[5](#fn_681) (to afflict them.md), then shall (Thy
faithful worshipper) increase thereby the celebration of Thy praise, O
Lord! and with it blessings <span id="fr_683"></span>[6](#fn_682.md) (for
Thy folk).

2\. Tell me then, Lord? (the end), for Thou dost

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

know it. (Tell me to grant me strength and courage) before those
conflicts come which shall encounter me <span
id="fr_684"></span>[1](#fn_683) (as leader of Thy tribes.md); shall the
champion of Thy holy Order, O Ahura! smite (at last) the evil heretic,
and when? (I ask Thee this); for this if it be gained (is known) to be
the (one) good consummation <span id="fr_685"></span>[2](#fn_684.md) of
(our) life.

3\. (Yea, tell me then this), for to the enlightened <span
id="fr_686"></span>[3](#fn_685.md) man is that the best of teachings which
the beneficent Ahura doth proclaim, and through (the revelations of) His
holy Order, bounteous as he and wise with His intelligence, as well as
they <span id="fr_687"></span>[4](#fn_686.md) who declare to us (still
other) secret sayings (in His name). The one like Thee (their
chieftain <span id="fr_688"></span>[5](#fn_687).md) is, O Mazda! endowed
with Thy Good Mind's understanding thoughts.

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

4\. (Yea, tell me the secret of the future struggle <span
id="fr_689"></span>[1](#fn_688); for that enlightened man.md) must <span
id="fr_690"></span>[2](#fn_689.md) follow close <span
id="fr_691"></span>[3](#fn_690.md) the holy Faith (for which that struggle
had its toil and effort). Yea, O Mazda! he who would bend his mind (till
it attains to) that which is the better and more holy, must pursue the
Daêna close in word and action. His will and wish must be consistent
with his chosen creed and fealty, and in Thine Understanding (which
discerneth all) shall he in many ways <span
id="fr_692"></span>[4](#fn_691) be (versed.md) at last!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

5\. (But while I as yet know not the issue, I can yet hope and pray.)
Let the good kings obtain the rule. Let not the evil monarchs govern
us <span id="fr_693"></span>[6](#fn_693.md), (but let the righteous gain
the day and rule us), with deeds done in a good discernment, O thou
pious wisdom, Âramaiti! sanctifying to men's minds the best of blessings
for (their) offspring <span id="fr_694"></span>[7](#fn_694.md). Yea, for
the Kine, (O Âramaiti <span id="fr_695"></span>[5](#fn_692)!.md)

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

let (Thy) toil be given <span id="fr_696"></span>[1](#fn_695.md), and
may’st Thou cause her to prosper for our life.

6\. For she will grant us pleasing homes <span
id="fr_697"></span>[2](#fn_696), and, (while we live.md) in this Thy Good
Mind's longing <span id="fr_698"></span>[3](#fn_697.md) prayer (to gain her
welfare), she grants us likewise lasting strength (for every deed which
that Thy Good Mind moves us to perform), and therefore hath Mazda caused
the plants <span id="fr_699"></span>[4](#fn_698.md) to flourish for her
(nurture), He, Ahura, in the generation of primeval life.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

7\. (Then in our coming strife <span id="fr_700"></span>[5](#fn_699.md) let
both her mortal foes be slain.) Let the Wrath-demon of rapine be cast
down. Smite ye against the envy (which would plot against our
Throne <span id="fr_701"></span>[6](#fn_700).md), O ye who, abiding by the
Good Mind, and in accordance with our holy Order, desire to hold that
refuge <span id="fr_702"></span>[7](#fn_701.md) fast, to whose sacred bond
the bounteous man belongs. And therefore,

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O Ahura! (to save
Thy struggling saint who toils with changing lot) will I place (that
refuge) for him in Thy world.

8\. (And how shall I beseech Thee for this victory and gift?) What is
the (potent <span id="fr_703"></span>[1](#fn_702).md) prayer to bring on
that Thy holy Reign <span id="fr_704"></span>[2](#fn_703.md)? What for Thy
sacred reward and blessing for my (soul)? How shall I seek the open
helpers for (the spread and maintenance of) Thy (great) Order <span
id="fr_705"></span>[3](#fn_704.md), while I myself live <span
id="fr_706"></span>[4](#fn_705.md) on in Thy Good Spirit's deeds?

9\. (Aye, when shall faith be changed to sight <span
id="fr_707"></span>[5](#fn_706).md); and when shall I in verity discern if
Ye indeed have power over aught, O Lord! and through Thy Righteous Order
(guarding here on earth), O Thou within whose (power lie) my
griefs <span id="fr_708"></span>[6](#fn_707.md) and doubts? Let then Thy
saving prophet find and gain aright (for) my delight <span
id="fr_709"></span>[7](#fn_708.md) Thy Good Mind's wonder-working

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

grace <span id="fr_710"></span>[1](#fn_709.md); yea, let Thy Saoshya*n*t
see how gifts of recompense may be his own.

10\. When, Mazda! shall the men of mind's perfection come <span
id="fr_711"></span>[2](#fn_710.md)? And when shall they drive <span
id="fr_712"></span>[3](#fn_711) from hence, the soil of this (polluted.md)
drunken joy <span id="fr_713"></span>[4](#fn_712.md), whereby the Karpans
with (their) angry zeal would crush us <span
id="fr_714"></span>[5](#fn_713.md), and by whose inspiration the tyrants of
the provinces (hold on) their evil rule <span
id="fr_715"></span>[6](#fn_714.md)?

11\. Yea, when shall our perfected Piety appear

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

together with <span id="fr_716"></span>[1](#fn_715.md) Thy Righteousness?
When shall she come, as having the amenities of home for us, and
provided (like our land) with pastures <span
id="fr_717"></span>[2](#fn_716) (for the kine.md)? And who shall give us
quiet <span id="fr_718"></span>[3](#fn_717) from the cruel (men.md) of evil
life and faith? To whom shall Thy Good Mind's sacred wisdom come (to
guide them in their toil to rescue and avenge us)?

12\. (To whom? The answer lieth near.) Such shall be the Saviours of the
Provinces, and they who, through Thy Good Mind's grace, shall go on hand
in hand with mental keenness <span id="fr_719"></span>[4](#fn_718.md) (as
it spreads among Thy saints) by the doing every deed of Thy commandment,
O Ahura! through the help of, and in accordance with, Thy Holy Order;
for such as these are set (for us), as steadfast foes of hate!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_677"></span>[153:1](sbe31018.htm#fr_678.md) The Pahlavi has
also pavan zak dahi*s*nŏ; but a false gloss gives an erroneous concrete
\[pavan tanû î pasînŏ\]. Recall âdâi paitî.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[153:2](sbe31018.htm#fr_679.md) See ashaônô,
ashâunê (sic) (Y. XLVII, 4, 5).

<span id="fn_679"></span>[153:3](sbe31018.htm#fr_680.md) Read 'as
âshûtâ'—has been pushed on, enacted. I correct here as seems so
evidently necessary; but the Pahlavi anticipates with its amat zak
yâmtûnê*d*.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[153:4](sbe31018.htm#fr_681.md) Pavan friftârîh.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[153:5](sbe31018.htm#fr_682.md) See Y. XXIX, 4.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[153:6](sbe31018.htm#fr_683.md) See Y. XXX, 11,
sava*k*â ashavabyô.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[154:1](sbe31018.htm#fr_684.md) M*en*g = mãm or
man; -*en*g is the nasalised vowel. Man is suspiciously significant
here; 'mental battles' is rather advanced for the circumstances. It is,
however, not impossible. The Pahlavi favours mãm (?) here; it has avŏ
li. We might even read m*e*nâ on its evidence. The Pahlavi indicates the
meaning 'crises' under the figure of the 'Bridge,' which was the last
great crisis to every man in the eye of the earlier, as well as of the
later, Faith; so also in Y. LI, 12. The 'straits of life' would be an
admirable meaning; I differ with hesitation.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[154:2](sbe31018.htm#fr_685.md) Pahlavi
kar*d*ârîh.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[154:3](sbe31018.htm#fr_686.md) See Y. XLIII, 14.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[154:4](sbe31018.htm#fr_687.md) Yaê*k*î*t*
gûzrâ-s*e*ngh*a*unghô. Or, 'knowing also those who are the teachers of
secret doctrines.'

<span id="fn_687"></span>[154:5](sbe31018.htm#fr_688.md) We may, with some
effort, connect thwâvãs with vaêdemnâi. Spe*n*tô vîdv*a*u, however, must
refer to the immediately foregoing Ahurô, especially in view of the
tv*e*m vîdv*a*u, Ahurâ, of verse 2. 'The one like Thee' might even, as
in other cases, be only an oblique way of rendering 'Thyself;' but the
expression 'with the understanding of Vohu Manah' induces me to refer
the word Thwâvãs to the servant of Ahura; in this case, however, this
last line must of course be drawn to verse 4, although not mechanically
separated from verse 3.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[155:1](sbe31018.htm#fr_689.md) See verse 2.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[155:2](sbe31018.htm#fr_690.md) Present for
imperative, as sometimes in modern languages in giving directions.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[155:3](sbe31018.htm#fr_691.md) The words are
anticipated from the third line.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[155:4](sbe31018.htm#fr_692.md) I follow the
Indian sense here with great reluctance. Nanâ may well be, in Iranian,
equivalent to 'each several one,' and in fact may not impossibly teach
us the origin of the word ('man, man.' comp. nar*e*m,\* nar*e*m\*). The
Pahl. trlr. is so decided for a personal sense, that he renders gabrâ
nê*s*man = man and woman. Did he suppose 'woman' to be literally (!)
expressed in the text?

<span id="fn_692"></span>[155:5](sbe31018.htm#fr_695.md) Âramaiti is
addressed, unless indeed an instrumental is read without MSS. An
instrumental is of course preferable.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[155:6](sbe31018.htm#fr_693.md) The Pahlavi has,
with admirable freedom, zakatŏ hû-khû*d*âî pâ*d*akhshâyîni*s*n, va al
lanman zak î dû*s*-khû*d*âî *s*alîtâ yehavûnâ*d*ŏ. I read hukhshathrâ
khshaye*ñ*tãm, mâ n*e* dû*s*-khshathrâ, to bring the metre somewhat into
order, as some gross irregularity is present; the caesura only, not the
sense, is affected by the change.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[155:7](sbe31018.htm#fr_694.md) Or, 'from the
birth-hour on;' so the Pahlavi. Its gloss reads \[akhar min
zerkhûni*s*nŏ avinâsîh pâhlûm\].

<span id="fn_695"></span>[156:1](sbe31018.htm#fr_696.md) So Bartholomae,
who now holds to a third singular here, leaving the text undisturbed,
and explaining as an optative.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[156:2](sbe31018.htm#fr_697.md) The Pahlavi seems
to render 'comfort' here, using khvârîh in that sense.

<span id="fn_697"></span>[156:3](sbe31018.htm#fr_698.md) So the Pahlavi
correctly indicates by its arzûk; Ner. priyataram.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[156:4](sbe31018.htm#fr_699.md) Compare Y. LI, 7.
Are the plants here mentioned as in connection with Âramaiti in her
figurative association with the earth?

<span id="fn_699"></span>[156:5](sbe31018.htm#fr_700.md) See verses 1, 2.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[156:6](sbe31018.htm#fr_701.md) Or, 'against the
blow,' Y. XXIX, 1. The Pahlavi translator here renders pa*d*îrak î
arêshak, while in Y. XXIX, 1 he renders î rêshkûn. The variations are
probably not real; the renderings referring to some forgotten
differences of text; or, as often, he may have anticipated modern
freedom, and 'changed his text;' that is, rendered it as if changed to a
seemingly more intelligible form; so in a throng of similar cases. This
is the only rational explanation of some of his errors. (He was able to
render, and has rendered, most grammatical forms in different places.)

<span id="fn_701"></span>[156:7](sbe31018.htm#fr_702.md) The Pahlavi has,
however, navîdîh. Did he read vidhyãm, in itself a very possible text?

<span id="fn_702"></span>[157:1](sbe31018.htm#fr_703.md) Compare
*e*mava*n*tem aêshem, also peresâ n*a*u yâ tôi *e*hmâ par*s*tâ. Observe
that the Pahlavi translator distinguishes the two senses of î*s*ti. In
Y. XLVI, 2 he transcribes the Gâthic word, the Persian rendering
‘hezânah; Ner. pu*n*yalakshmîm; here, however, he has: Ka*d*âr lak,
Aûharmazd, zak î *s*apîr khvahî*s*n î khû*d*âyîh.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[157:2](sbe31018.htm#fr_704.md) Compare verse 5.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[157:3](sbe31018.htm#fr_705.md) Ashâ might
certainly equal á*kh*â here (so Bartholomae) if the constant and
intentional repetition of the name and idea of Asha, = the personified
Order, would not have caused confusion.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[157:4](sbe31018.htm#fr_706.md) The Pahlavi
translator renders a word which occupied the place of *g*avarô by
yakhsenunî*d*ârîh; Ner. following as to root (freely as to form). As he,
however, renders related forms elsewhere by 'living,' 'live,' our only
safe conclusion is that he had a different word from *g*avarô (*g*ivarô)
before him in his MS.

<span id="fn_706"></span>[157:5](sbe31018.htm#fr_707.md) Compare Y. XXVIII,
6.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[157:6](sbe31018.htm#fr_708.md) I am very far from
certain that we do not seriously blunder in not following the indication
of the Pahlavi here. See remarks Y. XXXII, 16.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[157:7](sbe31018.htm#fr_709.md) Or, 'let me enjoy
as my own;' but môi is difficult. Û*k*ãm might otherwise be a first
personal form in the sense of the Vedic u*k*. <span id="page_158">p.
158</span> Bartholomae's third sing. imper. is also of course well
possible; but were not the originally abnormal third singulars in -âm,
duhâ´m *s*ayâm, vidâm, taken over from third pl. subj. '-âm' really
equalling the nasal vowel merely\*? Comp. also Indian ád*ris*ram,
ábudhram, ás*ri*gram, Zend vavazirem, -am = an. 'Tradition' has, Pahl.
zîvi*s*nîh; Ner. *g*îvitam; Pers. zîstan, for û*k*ãm, as if rendering
'enjoyment,' 'experience of life.' \*(âm = tâm is more difficult.)

<span id="fn_709"></span>[158:1](sbe31018.htm#fr_710.md) Comparing vápus;
otherwise, with the Pahlavi, 'knowing the destruction (of the evil)
which Vohûman works;' see Y. XXIX, 6, where the rendering of the Pahlavi
is supported by the previous verse.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[158:2](sbe31018.htm#fr_711.md) Comp. Y. XLVI, 3.
Kadâ Mazda; frâr*en*tê\*—saoshya*n*tãm khratavô?

<span id="fn_711"></span>[158:3](sbe31018.htm#fr_712.md) Compare Y. XXXII,
15.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[158:4](sbe31018.htm#fr_713.md) Is
Soma-intoxication here referred to? And was the Haoma-worship in
abeyance at the time? The Pahlavi seems to have understood 'magic' here,
and in the evil sense, that is, judging from the perhaps later gloss.
Aside from the gloss, however, the Pahlavi may well have been, nay, more
probably was, intended to be read madîh as = madahyâ.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[158:5](sbe31018.htm#fr_714.md) As to this word,
we cannot do better than follow Justi (although his work is now a score
of years old). The Indian várpas, in the sense of deceit, has also been
compared. The last Pahlavi translator was probably confused by finding
this word, as so often, divided in his MS. He rendered as best he could,
or rather he handed down the shattered documents, or oral teachings, of
his predecessors with his own too often lame additions, the whole mass
being rich in the relics of the truth.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[158:6](sbe31018.htm#fr_715.md) See verse 5.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[159:1](sbe31018.htm#fr_716.md) Ma*t* following
Ashâ shows that we may also have the preposition in pôi ma*t*.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[159:2](sbe31018.htm#fr_717.md) As Âramaiti is
here spoken of as 'having pasture,' that is, as inspiring the thrifty
husbandmen who cultivate the meadows by irrigation, or drainage, she
became associated herself with those meadows, and so later with the
earth; see Y. XLVII, 2.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[159:3](sbe31018.htm#fr_718.md) The Pahlavi sees
in râmãm enforced quiet not 'from' but 'to' the wicked; 'who shall deal
the finishing blow to the wicked?'

<span id="fn_718"></span>[159:4](sbe31018.htm#fr_719.md) So also the
Pahlavi, shnâsinî*d*ârîh.
