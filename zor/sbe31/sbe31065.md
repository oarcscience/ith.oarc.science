### YASNA LX (SP. LIX).

#### PRAYERS FOR THE DWELLING OF THE SACRIFICER <span id="fr_1303"></span>[2](#fn_1293.md).

1\. Thus that better than the good may he approach, who shows to us
straight paths of profit appertaining to this bodily life and to the
mental likewise, in the eternal (?) realms where dwells Ahura; yea, may
he approach it, who is Thy worthy servant, and good citizen, O Great
giver Lord <span id="fr_1304"></span>[3](#fn_1294.md)!

2\. May these blessings approach this house, which are the wise
perceptions of the saints, the sacred blessings bestowed through the
ritual, their guileless characteristics, together with their recognition
of what is due; and may the Righteous Order appear for this village, and
the Divine Sovereign Power, together with the benefit and glorious
welfare (which ensues),

3\. And with these the long enduring prominence of this Religion of
Ahura's, the Zarathu*s*trian Faith. And may the Kine <span
id="fr_1305"></span>[4](#fn_1295.md) be now with greatest speed within (the
farm-yard of) this house, most speedily

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

may the rewarded sanctity and the strength of the holy man be here, most
speedily as well Ahura's lore. 4. And may the good and heroic and
bountiful Fravashis of the saints come here, and may they go hand in
hand with us with the healing virtues of (their) blessed gifts as
wide-spread as the earth, as far-spread as the rivers, as
high-reaching <span id="fr_1306"></span>[1](#fn_1296.md) as the sun, for
the furtherance <span id="fr_1307"></span>[2](#fn_1297.md) of the better
men, for the hindrance of the hostile, and for the abundant growth of
riches and of glory.

5\. May Sraosha (Obedience) conquer disobedience <span
id="fr_1308"></span>[3](#fn_1298.md) within this house, and may peace
triumph over discord here, and generous giving over avarice,
reverence <span id="fr_1309"></span>[3](#fn_1298.md) over contempt, speech
with truthful words over lying utterance. May the Righteous Order gain
the victory over the Demon of the Lie <span
id="fr_1310"></span>[4](#fn_1299.md).

6\. As in this (house) the Bountiful Immortals seek for good Yasnas and
good praises from the blessed Sraosha (who governs here), and as they
seek for (one) good sacrifice and act of homage (more especially their
own) which is a good offering <span id="fr_1311"></span>[5](#fn_1300.md)
(to them) for (our) salvation, and a good offering in praise, together
with a long continued offering of the entire self <span
id="fr_1312"></span>[6](#fn_1301), (7) let not then (their.md) brilliant
glory <span id="fr_1313"></span>[7](#fn_1302.md) ever desert this house,
nor the bright abundance, nor an illustrious <span
id="fr_1314"></span>[8](#fn_1303.md) offspring legitimately <span
id="fr_1315"></span>[9](#fn_1304.md) born, nor that long continued
companionship which is the

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

furtherance of that good blessedness which teaches concerning
glory <span id="fr_1316"></span>[1](#fn_1305). 8-10 (= Y. VIII, 5-7.md).

11\. In order that our minds may be <span
id="fr_1317"></span>[2](#fn_1306.md) delighted, and our souls the best, let
our bodies be glorified as well, and let them, O Mazda! go likewise
openly (unto Heaven) as the best world <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[3](#fn_1307.md) of the saints as devoted to Ahura,
(12) and accompanied by Asha Vahi*s*ta (who is Righteousness the Best),
and the most beautiful! And may we see Thee, and may we, approaching,
come around about Thee, and attain to entire companionship with Thee!
And we sacrifice to the Righteous Order, the best, the most beautiful,
the bounteous Immortal!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1293"></span>[310:2](sbe31065.htm#fr_1303.md) Said on the
visitation of farm-houses by the travelling priest.

<span id="fn_1294"></span>[310:3](sbe31065.htm#fr_1304.md) See Y. XLIII, 3.

<span id="fn_1295"></span>[310:4](sbe31065.htm#fr_1305.md) Gau*s* seems
feminine here, and used collectively, and ha*k*a has the Indian sense of
sa*k*a.

<span id="fn_1296"></span>[311:1](sbe31065.htm#fr_1306.md) Earth-wide,
stream-long, sun-high.

<span id="fn_1297"></span>[311:2](sbe31065.htm#fr_1307.md) I*s*ti seems a
dative.

<span id="fn_1298"></span>[311:3](sbe31065.htm#fr_1309.md) The name Sraosha
had not lost its original meaning; so of Ar(a)maiti.

<span id="fn_1299"></span>[311:4](sbe31065.htm#fr_1310.md) Asha-Dru*g*em?

<span id="fn_1300"></span>[311:5](sbe31065.htm#fr_1311.md) Possibly, 'good
support.'

<span id="fn_1301"></span>[311:6](sbe31065.htm#fr_1312.md) Pahl.
benaf*s*man.

<span id="fn_1302"></span>[311:7](sbe31065.htm#fr_1313.md) *Hv*âthrava*t*
*hv*arenô determines the sense.

<span id="fn_1303"></span>[311:8](sbe31065.htm#fr_1314.md) See
'*hv*âthrava*t*.'

<span id="fn_1304"></span>[311:9](sbe31065.htm#fr_1315.md) The Pahl. does
not necessarily render 'heavenly;' the word elsewhere means 'original.'

<span id="fn_1305"></span>[312:1](sbe31065.htm#fr_1316.md) Or, 'welfare.'

<span id="fn_1306"></span>[312:2](sbe31065.htm#fr_1317.md) *A*unghãn.

<span id="fn_1307"></span>[312:3](sbe31065.htm#fr_1318.md) The nom. is
difficult. The Ashem Vohû and Ahuna follow.
