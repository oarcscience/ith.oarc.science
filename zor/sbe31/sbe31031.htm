<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The Haoma-ya<I>s</I>t has claims to antiquity (owing to its subject, but not to its dialect), next after the Sr&ocirc;<I>s</I>-ya<I>s</I>t. H(a)oma = Soma, as a deity, flourished not only before the G&acirc;thas, but before the <I>Ri</I>ks of the Veda, in Aryan ages before Iranian and Indian became two peoples.</p>  
<p>The astonishing circumstance has been elsewhere noted that a hymn, which is a reproduction of an Aryan original, should, notwithstanding its earlier characteristics, be necessarily assigned to</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_231"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 231</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">a date much later than the G&acirc;thas in which H(a)oma worship is not mentioned.</p>  
<p>Probably on account of bitter animosities prevailing between their more southern neighbours and themselves, and the use of Soma by the Indians as a stimulant before battle, the Iranians of the G&acirc;thic period had become lukewarm in their own H(a)oma worship. But that it should have revived, as we see it in this Ya<I>s</I>t, after having nearly or quite disappeared, is most interesting and remarkable. Was it definitively and purposely repudiated by Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, afterwards reviving as by a relapse? I do not think that it is well to hold to such deliberate and conscious antagonisms, and to a definite policy and action based upon them. The Soma-worship, like the sacramental acts of other religions which have become less practised after exaggerated attention, had simply fallen into neglect, increased by an aversion to practices outwardly similar to those of 'Da&ecirc;va-worshippers.' The Ya<I>s</I>t is, of course, made up of fragments, which I have endeavoured to separate by lines. In the translation I have given a rhythmical rendering, necessarily somewhat free. It was difficult to import sufficient vivacity to the piece, while using a uselessly awkward literalness. The freedom, as elsewhere, often consists in adding words to point the sense, or round the rhythm. (Expressions for identical Zend words have been here, as elsewhere, purposely varied.)</FONT></p>  
<p>1. At the hour of H&acirc;vani&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_957"></A><A HREF="#fn_951"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. H(a)oma came to Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, as he served the (sacred) Fire, and sanctified (its flame), while he sang aloud the G&acirc;thas.</p>  
<p>And Zarathu<I>s</I>tra asked him: Who art thou, O man! who art of all the incarnate world the most beautiful in Thine own body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_958"></A><A HREF="#fn_952"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of those whom I have seen, (thou) glorious [immortal]?</p>  
<p>2. Thereupon gave H(a)oma answer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_959"></A><A HREF="#fn_953"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, the holy one who driveth death afar: I am, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra</p>

<p>3. Thereupon spake Zarathu<I>s</I>tra: Unto H(a)oma be the praise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_960"></A><A HREF="#fn_954"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. What man, O H(a)oma! first prepared thee for the corporeal world? What blessedness was offered him? what gain did he acquire?</p>  
<p>4. Thereupon did H(a)oma answer me, he the holy one, and driving death afar: V&icirc;vanghva<I>n</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_961"></A><A HREF="#fn_955"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> was the first of men who prepared me for the incarnate world. This blessedness was offered him; this gain did he acquire, that to him was born a son who was Yima, called the brilliant, (he of the many flocks, the most glorious of those yet born, the sunlike-one of men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_962"></A><A HREF="#fn_956"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>), that he made from his authority both herds and people free from dying, both plants and waters free from drought, and men could eat imperishable food.</p>  
<p>5. In the reign of Yima swift of motion was there neither cold nor heat, there was neither age nor death, nor envy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_963"></A><A HREF="#fn_957"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> demon-made.

<p>9. Who was the third man, O H(a)oma! who prepared thee for the corporeal world? What blessedness was given him? what gain did he acquire?</p>  
<p>10. Thereupon gave H(a)oma answer, the holy one, and driving death afar: Thrita&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, [the most helpful of the S&acirc;mas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>], was the third man who prepared me for the corporeal world.

<p>13. Thereupon gave H(a)oma answer, he the holy, and driving death afar: Pourushaspa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> was the fourth man who prepared me for the corporeal world. This blessedness was given him, this gain did he acquire, that thou, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! wast born to him, the just, in Pourushaspa's house, the D(a)&ecirc;va's foe, the friend of Mazda's lore, (14) famed in Airy&ecirc;na Va&ecirc;<I>g</I>ah; and thou, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra I didst recite the first the Ahuna-vairya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_971"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, four times intoning it, and with verses kept apart [(P&acirc;zand) each time with louder and still louder voice].</p>  
<p>15. And thou didst cause, O Zarathu<I>s</I>tra! all the demon-gods to vanish in the ground who aforetime flew about this earth in human shape (and power.

He was scorched, started, and then sprang. Also in Vend. III, 32 when the barley is produced the demons hardly 'sweat (with mental misery).' The idea is too advanced for the document.
