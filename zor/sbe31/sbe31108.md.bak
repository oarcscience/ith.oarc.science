### V. GÂH USHAHIN <span id="fr_1585"></span>[1](#fn_1557.md).

1\. Propitiation to Ahura Mazda. I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper, of
the order of Zarathu*s*tra, a foe to the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of
the Lord, for the Ushahina, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and
praise, and to Bere*g*ya and Nmânya, the holy lord(s) of the ritual
order. 2. Propitiation be to Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, endowed
with recompense, smiting with the blow of victory, and causing the
settlements to advance and to increase.

3, 4. (See Gâh I, 3, 4.) 5. We sacrifice to Ushahina, the holy lord of
the ritual order; and we sacrifice to the beautiful Aurora, and to the
dawn of morning; yea, we sacrifice to the morning, the shining <span
id="fr_1586"></span>[2](#fn_1558.md), of the glittering horses, having the
men of forethought (as its servants), yea, having men of forethought and
heroes (awake and at their work), to the morning which gives light
within the house <span id="fr_1587"></span>[3](#fn_1559.md). And we
sacrifice to the lights of dawn which are radiant with their light and
fleetest horses which sweep over (?) the sevenfold earth. And we
sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to the
Good Mind, and to Asha Vahi*s*ta (who is Righteousness the Best), and to
Khshathra-vairya, and to Âramaiti, the bounteous and the good.

6\. And we sacrifice to Bere*g*ya, even the holy lord of the ritual
order, even to Nmânya with the longing desire for the good Asha, and
with the longing desire for the good Mazdayasnian law, for the worship

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

and homage of Nmânya, the lord. 7. And we sacrifice to Sraosha, and to
Rashnu, the most just, and to Ar*s*tâ*t*, who causes the settlements to
advance and to increase. 8, 9. (See Gâh I, 9, 10.) 10. And I bless the
sacrifice, homage, strength, and swiftness of Sraosha (Obedience) the
blessed, endowed with sanctity, smiting with the blow of victory, and
who causes the settlements to advance; and I bless the sacrifice of
Rashnu, the most just, and that of Ar*s*tâ*t*, who causes the
settlements to advance and to increase <span
