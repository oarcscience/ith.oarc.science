------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THE GÂTHA(Â) VAHI*S*TÂ Î*S*TI*S* (VAHI*S*TÔI*S*TI(Î)).

This Gâtha, named from its first words, consists of chapter LIII of the
Yasna. While its matter is homogeneous with that of the other Gâthas, it
bears some evidence of having been composed in the latter portion of
Zarathu*s*tra's life. It is, as usual, separated from the other Gâthas
by its metre, which shows four lines with two half lines. The first two
have eleven or twelve syllables; the third seems to have fourteen plus a
half line with five, so also the last. Irregularities seem frequent. The
composition has for its substance a marriage song, but one of a
politically religious character.

The piece â-airy*e*mâ-ishyô, Y. LIV, 1, has been considered by some is
susceptible of a similar metrical arrangement, and it certainly looks as
if it originally belonged to Y. LIII. It is, however,

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

otherwise divided by Bartholomae (see Arische Forschungen,
2<sup>ter</sup> heft, s. 23). From the past form of srâvî, some have
thought that Zarathu*s*tra was no longer living when this hymn was
composed, but the word may only mean '(his prayer) has been, or is
heard.' If we must, however, render 'was heard,' this does not determine
the certainty of Zarathu*s*tra's death. The expression Zarathu*s*tri*s*
Spitâmô also gives the impression that some heir to Zarathu*s*tra's
office and prestige existed, but even this is not decisive, for a future
successor may be for a time a contemporary, while, on the contrary, the
nuptials of Zarathu*s*tra's daughter, with the mention of his name, and
the reference to her 'father' as the one from whom her bridegroom
obtained her, indicate that Zarathu*s*tra may well have been still
living. The later forms Zarathu*s*trahê and fedhrô remain as the
indications of a later origin than the actual period of Zarathu*s*tra's
lifetime; but these circumstances may he owing to accidental causes.

The style has freshness and vigour throughout, and would indicate
Zarathu*s*trian influence, if not authorship. That Zarathu*s*tra does
not speak in the first person, has no importance whatever in the
question. The piece is not of course a whole; but it may well be a whole
out of which parts have fallen. That the subject passes on to the old
polemical vehemence in the last verses, is far from unnatural. The
marriage festival of Zarathu*s*tra's child must have been, if without
intention, a semi-political occasion, and the bard would express
himself, as naturally, with regard to the struggle which was still going
on. This latter fact also shows an early date; the passages referring to
the struggle are strongly kindred with some in Y. XLVI, and elsewhere.

Verses 1 and 2 form an admirable introduction; the transition to the
marriage occasion was, however, contained in lost verses. Verses 3, 4,
and 5 hang well together; and 6 and 7 are not at all remote from them;
the warlike close, although far from surprising us, must have been
introduced by one or more now missing stanzas.

1\. As the object of the 'great cause,' next to the preservation of its
adherents, was the extension of its influence, first over hesitating
parties (Y. XLIV, 12), and then over all the living (Y. XXXI, 3), it is
not surprising that the central prayer of Zarathu*s*tra should have
culminated in a desire for the conversion of opponents. Even Turanians
had been known to come over to the holy creed, and help prosper the
settlements which their kith had so often plundered (Y. XLVI, 12); he
had therefore prayed that those who

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

had heretofore injured the holy Daêna might become its disciples by a
genuine conversion. 2. Having observed the fidelity of converts and
original disciples, the king and his chief nobles would celebrate their
devotion by hymns, ceremonies, and sacrifices, as the symbols of every
moral virtue, laying down for the people the moral law of the Saviour.
3. As it would be pushing rather far to suppose the Saoshya*n*t to be
referred to in t*e*m*k*â, and as moreover, according to Geldner's
admirable suggestion, that title may here well refer to Zarathu*s*tra,
it is better to accept a loss of verses, and to suppose a person alluded
to as the bridegroom, who, if not one so eminent as to merit the
imposing name of Saoshya*n*t, was still at least one of his more
prominent satellites, for the ancient poet goes on to address a daughter
of Zarathu*s*tra as a bride. She is the youngest, and her name is as
pious as that of a maid of ancient Israel, for she is called 'full of
the religious knowledge.' Her husband is to be a support in holiness,
and she is to take counsel with piety 4. Her response is appropriate;
she will vie with her husband in every sacred affection, as well as in
every domestic virtue. 5. The priestly thaliarch then addresses the
bridesmaids and the pair with suitable admonitions to piety and
affection. 6. Turning now to the assembly, possibly after the recital of
some stanzas long since vanished, he proceeds with warnings and
encouragements. He will exorcise the Demon who was especially the slave
of the Daêvas; but he warns all men and women against the evil Vayu, the
spirit of the air. 7. Charitably concluding that they would come forth
as conquerors from the trials which still awaited them, he next warns
them against all solicitations to vice. 8. Having named profane Demons,
his polemical zeal becomes fully inflamed. Anticipating with fierce
delight the sufferings of the wicked, he calls vehemently for the
champion, who may, in alliance with neighbouring potentates, deliver up
the murderous false-leader, giving peace to the masses; and he entreats
that all haste may be used. 9. To arouse the great chiefs to their duty,
he recalls (as in Y. XXXII) the successes of the foe; and he calls for
the prince who may overthrow and expel him, but, as if well aware that
the human arm could not alone bring salvation, he attributes to Ahura
the Sovereign Power, which alone can guard helpless innocence against
lawless plunder and oppression.

Translation.

1\. That best prayer has been answered <span
id="fr_836"></span>[1](#fn_834.md), the prayer of Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma,
that Ahura Mazda might <span id="fr_837"></span>[2](#fn_835.md) grant him
those boons, (the most wished-for) which flow from the good Order, even
a life that is prospered <span id="fr_838"></span>[3](#fn_836.md) for
eternal duration, and also those who deceived <span
id="fr_839"></span>[4](#fn_837) him (may He likewise thus grant him.md) as
the good Faith's disciples in word and in deed <span
id="fr_840"></span>[5](#fn_838.md).

2\. And may Kavi Vî*s*tâspa, and the Zarathu*s*trian Spitâma <span
id="fr_841"></span>[6](#fn_839.md), and Frashao*s*tra too with them, offer
propitiation to Mazda in thought, word, and deed, and

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yasna
confessions <span id="fr_842"></span>[1](#fn_840.md) as they render Him
praise, making straight paths <span id="fr_843"></span>[2](#fn_841.md) (for
our going), even that Faith of the Saoshya*n*t which Ahura will
found <span id="fr_844"></span>[3](#fn_842.md).

(The master of the feast.)

3 <span id="fr_845"></span>[4](#fn_843.md). And him will they give Thee, O
Pouru*k*ista, Haê*k*a*t*-aspid and Spitâmi! young <span
id="fr_846"></span>[5](#fn_844) (as thou art.md) of the daughters of
Zarathu*s*tra, him will they <span id="fr_847"></span>[6](#fn_845.md) give
thee as a help in the Good Mind's true service, of Asha's and Mazda's,
as a chief and a guardian <span id="fr_848"></span>[7](#fn_846.md). Counsel
well then (together <span id="fr_849"></span>[8](#fn_847).md), with the
mind of Ârmaiti, most bounteous and pious; and act with just action.

(She answers.)

4\. I will love <span id="fr_850"></span>[9](#fn_848.md) and vie with him,
since from (my) father <span id="fr_851"></span>[10](#fn_849.md) he gained
(me). For the master and toilers, and for the lord-kinsman (be) the Good
Mind's bright

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

blessing <span id="fr_852"></span>[1](#fn_850.md), the pure for the pure
ones, and to me (be <span id="fr_853"></span>[2](#fn_851).md) the insight
(which I gain from his counsel <span id="fr_854"></span>[3](#fn_852).md).
Mazda grant it, Ahura for good conscience for ever.

(The priestly master of the feast.)

5\. Monitions for the marrying I speak to (you) maidens, to you, I who
know them; and heed ye my (sayings): By these <span
id="fr_855"></span>[4](#fn_853.md) laws of the Faith which I utter obtain
ye the life of the Good Mind (on earth and in heaven). (And to you,
bride and bridegroom <span id="fr_856"></span>[5](#fn_854).md), let each
one the other in Righteousness cherish; thus alone unto each shall the
home-life be happy.

6\. \[Thus real are these things, ye men and ye women <span
id="fr_857"></span>[6](#fn_855.md)!\] from the Lie-demon protecting, I
guard o’er my (faithful), and so (I) grant progress (in weal and in
goodness). And the hate of the Lie (with the hate of her) bondsmen (?) I
pray from the body, (and so would expel it <span
id="fr_858"></span>[7](#fn_856).md). For to those who bear Vayu <span
id="fr_859"></span>[8](#fn_857), (and bring him to power.md), his
shame <span id="fr_860"></span>[9](#fn_858.md) mars the glory. To these
evil truth-harmers by these means he reaches. Ye thus slay the life
mental (if ye follow his courses <span
id="fr_861"></span>[10](#fn_859).md).

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

7\. But yours be the recompense, (O ye righteous women!) of this great
cause. For while lustful desire heart-inflamed from the body <span
id="fr_862"></span>[1](#fn_860.md) there beyond goeth down where the spirit
of evil reaches (to ruin, still) ye bring forth the champion <span
id="fr_863"></span>[2](#fn_861.md) to help on the cause, (and thus conquer
temptation). So your last word is 'Vayu'; (ye cry it in triumph <span
id="fr_864"></span>[3](#fn_862).md).

8\. And thus let the sinners by these means be foiled <span
id="fr_865"></span>[4](#fn_863.md); and consumed <span
id="fr_866"></span>[5](#fn_864.md) be they likewise. Let them shriek in
their anger. With good kings let (our champion <span
id="fr_867"></span>[6](#fn_865).md) deliver <span
id="fr_868"></span>[7](#fn_866.md) the smiter <span
id="fr_869"></span>[8](#fn_867.md) (as a captive in

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

battle), giving peace to our dwellings, and peace to our hamlets. Let
him charge <span id="fr_870"></span>[1](#fn_868.md) those deceivers,
chaining death as the strongest <span id="fr_871"></span>[2](#fn_869.md);
and swift be (the issue).

9\. Through false believers the tormentor makes Thy helpers <span
id="fr_872"></span>[3](#fn_870.md) refusers <span
id="fr_873"></span>[4](#fn_871.md); (those who once helped our heroes shall
no longer give succour). The estranged thus desires, and the
reprobate <span id="fr_874"></span>[5](#fn_872.md) wills it, with the will
that he harbours to conquer our honour <span
id="fr_875"></span>[6](#fn_873.md). Where is then the Lord righteous who
will smite them from life <span id="fr_876"></span>[7](#fn_874.md), and
(beguile) them of license? Mazda! Thine is that power, (which will
banish and conquer). And Thine is the Kingdom <span
id="fr_877"></span>[8](#fn_875.md); and by it Thou bestowest the highest
(of blessings) on the right-living poor <span
id="fr_878"></span>[9](#fn_876.md)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_834"></span>[190:1](sbe31022.htm#fr_836.md) Some lay stress
upon the literal form 'was heard,' and regard the expression as
indicating the fact that Zarathu*s*tra was no longer living (see the
remarks in the summary).

<span id="fn_835"></span>[190:2](sbe31022.htm#fr_837.md) Free.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[190:3](sbe31022.htm#fr_838.md) I follow the
Pahlavi with all; it has hû-âhûînâ*d*.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[190:4](sbe31022.htm#fr_839.md) I follow the
frîftâr of the Pahlavi, as the conversion of those formerly hostile is
suggested by vaurayâ and Fryâna, not to speak of the primary rendering
of du*s*erethrî*s* *k*ikhshnushâ. The Pahlavi also has, 'even he who is
the deceiver is to be instructed in the word and deed of the good
religion.' The MSS. should not hastily be abandoned.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[190:5](sbe31022.htm#fr_840.md) That more than a
ritualistic sanctity is meant is certain (see Y. XXX, 3); but that no
sanctity could be recognised apart from worship is equally undeniable.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[190:6](sbe31022.htm#fr_841.md) Who was the
Zarathu*s*trian Spitâma? Some change the text after the Pahlavi
translator, reading Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma; but I would not follow this
evil example in a first translation of a translatable text. Why should a
Spitâma, who was not Zarathu*s*tra, be called Zarathu*s*trian? Were some
of the Spitâmas not in sympathy with their great kinsman, Spitâmas who
were Mazdayasnians, but not 'of Zarathu*s*tra's order?' One would
however suppose that some one of Zarathu*s*tra's family was meant who
occupied the position of his especial representative and natural
successor.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[191:1](sbe31022.htm#fr_842.md) Free.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[191:2](sbe31022.htm#fr_843.md) Recall the 'path
made for the Kine,' and 'the way' which 'Thou declarest to be that of
the Good Mind.'

<span id="fn_842"></span>[191:3](sbe31022.htm#fr_844.md) That is, will
permanently found, establish.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[191:4](sbe31022.htm#fr_845.md) Verses have here
fallen out, as some allusion must have been made to the bridegroom.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[191:5](sbe31022.htm#fr_846.md) So more according
to the hint of the Pahlavi and the statement of the Bundahi*s*; West,
XXXII, 5. So Geldner, K.Z. 28, 195.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[191:6](sbe31022.htm#fr_847.md) Or, 'will he, the
Saoshya*n*t, the bride's father.'

<span id="fn_846"></span>[191:7](sbe31022.htm#fr_848.md) A chieftain, a
protecting head.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[191:8](sbe31022.htm#fr_849.md) It is, perhaps,
safer to refer this 'questioning' to the pair; but forms of ham with
pares are also used of consultations with the Deity (see Y. XXXIII, 6).
Y. XLIV, 13 nearly necessitates the wider and less concrete view here.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[191:9](sbe31022.htm#fr_850.md) Varânî looks
somewhat like a gloss, but the metre seems to demand it.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[191:10](sbe31022.htm#fr_851.md) Her father's
sanction was a reason for devotion to the man to whom he had given her.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[192:1](sbe31022.htm#fr_852.md) The Pahlavi
translator has sîrîh here.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[192:2](sbe31022.htm#fr_853.md) B*et* = bá*d* lies
certainly nearer than b*e*e*t*=bava*t*.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[192:3](sbe31022.htm#fr_854.md) See the previous
verse.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[192:4](sbe31022.htm#fr_855.md) Or, 'being
zealous.'

<span id="fn_854"></span>[192:5](sbe31022.htm#fr_856.md) These words do not
seem adapted to the bridesmaids.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[192:6](sbe31022.htm#fr_857.md) *G*aini is
elsewhere used in an evil sense.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[192:7](sbe31022.htm#fr_858.md) I can only render
thus literally: From the Drû*g* as a generous guide (I) who (compare ye
in Y. XXVIII) (for) mine, (mê) a watching guardian (I guide as a
râthema; nom. sing. with verbal force) increasing prosperity, i.e.
progress, of the Drû*g* I pray (forth\*; I exorcise) of the bond (?) (of
the Drû*g*) the malicious injuries\* from the body or
person.    \*yêsê-parâ.    \*to 3rd pî.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[192:8](sbe31022.htm#fr_859.md) 'If ye bear, or
promote, the interests of Vayu.'

<span id="fn_858"></span>[192:9](sbe31022.htm#fr_860.md) Or, 'evil food.'

<span id="fn_859"></span>[192:10](sbe31022.htm#fr_861.md) Some line here is
gloss; the first thought would be to eliminate <span id="page_193">p.
193</span> the difficult second line; but the third line might be an
effort (by the poet himself, or an associate, see the metrical form) to
explain, or relieve, the awkward second line. Reading y*e*mâ and
râthemâ, and taking *g*enayô as in an evil sense, with spasuthâ as a
second plural, we might render as a question: 'Do ye, O ye twain, ye
helpers of the Drû*g*; do ye regard promotion (as thus to be gained)?'
But in that case verses 6 and 7 should be regarded as separated by many
lost verses from the fifth verse. But is not the first line the gloss?
It is merely an address.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[193:1](sbe31022.htm#fr_862.md) Free.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[193:2](sbe31022.htm#fr_863.md) Lit. 'the
greatness.'

<span id="fn_862"></span>[193:3](sbe31022.htm#fr_864.md) The difficulty
here lies in the first line which seems to declare a reward in a good
sense. Mî*z*dem is hardly used of retribution. It must therefore be
taken in a good sense. The following evil results must be supposed to
have been avoided; and 'Vayu' to be uttered in triumph. Vayu is used in
an evil sense in verse 6.

If mî*z*dem could be supposed to express retribution, then evil men and
women would be threatened, and Vayu would be a cry uttered in woe. As to
Vayu with his two natures, see part ii as per index.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[193:4](sbe31022.htm#fr_865.md) The foiling of the
evil here recalls âdebaomâ.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[193:5](sbe31022.htm#fr_866.md) The Pahlavi
translator seems to me too free in rendering za*hv*yâ*k*â (zahyâ*k*â),
zani*s*n-hômand. It also makes a curious imitation of letters in *g*êh
va mar for *g*enarãm. It is of course far from certain that he had our
present text.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[193:6](sbe31022.htm#fr_867.md) See verse 9; also
Y. XLVI, 4.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[193:7](sbe31022.htm#fr_868.md) Recall the
delivering of the evil into the two hands of Asha (Y. XXX, 8, and Y.
XLIV, 14).

<span id="fn_867"></span>[193:8](sbe31022.htm#fr_869.md) Khrûnerãm*k*â must
be a gloss.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[194:1](sbe31022.htm#fr_870.md) 'Let him "rout" or
"stir" them.'

<span id="fn_869"></span>[194:2](sbe31022.htm#fr_871.md) Comp. mazi*s*ta =
the strongest in Y. XLIX, 1, 'the prevailer.' Lit. 'with the chaining of
death the greatest.'

<span id="fn_870"></span>[194:3](sbe31022.htm#fr_872.md) For narpî*s* I can
only suggest the suspiciously simple nar = hero (comp. the frequent nâ)
and pî = nourish, support. The Pahlavi translator seems likewise to have
had some such rendering in mind, for he translates dastôbar.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[194:4](sbe31022.htm#fr_873.md) As to ri*g*î*s*,
the Pahlavi translation, which is here more than usually difficult,
hints in the direction above followed, by a word which I would restore
as rê*g*înênd.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[194:5](sbe31022.htm#fr_874.md) The Pahlavi
translator erroneously sees 'bridge' in peshô, or is free with his
tanâpûharkânŏ hômand. See Geldner, Stud. 3.

<span id="fn_873"></span>[194:6](sbe31022.htm#fr_875.md) See Geldner, Stud.
54.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[194:7](sbe31022.htm#fr_876.md) See Y. XLVI, 4.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[194:8](sbe31022.htm#fr_877.md) Comp. the
Ahuna-vairya which takes its last line from this place, and Y. XXXIV, 5.
Vahyô is a variation for vangh*e*u*s* vahyô.

<span id="fn_876"></span>[194:9](sbe31022.htm#fr_878.md) Here I have
endeavoured to imitate the swing of the rhythm by breaking up the
sentences, especially in the second line. Literally it would be, 'with
the desire, with the virtue-conquering (desire) of the reprobate.' Such
freedom as the above is often a critical necessity in the attempts to
reproduce the warmth of the original.
