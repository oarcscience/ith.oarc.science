### YASNA XXXII.

#### THE STRUGGLE IS CONTINUED IN THE MIDST OF REVERSES.

1\. The same author may well be supposed to continue. The first stanzas
have been lost, but we observe that the subject of the section is still
face to face with the Daêva party. He seems to see them arrayed and
engaged in hostile devotions. But he is not intimidated. The friendship
of Ahura is before his mind, and he expresses his desire that he and his
colleagues may become, or continue, His apostles, notwithstanding the
temporal sorrows which, according to XLIII, II, we see that he clearly
anticipated as the portion of those who would propagate the holy faith.

2\. Mazda answers him, and through him his followers, as established in
His spiritual sovereignty, accepting the devotion of their piety with
commendations and implied encouragements. He whom they would serve is
supreme; they need not fear.

3\. After reporting this response of Ahura, the composer turns with
vehemence toward the Daêvas, poetically conceived to be present as if
before their adherents, who also, according to verse 1, are supposed to
be in sight (or are dramatically so conceived) celebrating their profane
devotions; and he addresses them as the 'very seed' of Satan. Their
worshippers belong to the religious falsehood and perversity. And they
have persistently propagated their evil creed, which is in consequence
spreading.

4\. They have, so he acknowledges with grief, perverted men's minds,
making them spokesmen for themselves, and in consequence deserters from
the great Kindly Disposition of Ahura Mazda, and outcasts, fallen from
His understanding.

5\. They have destroyed the hopes of mankind for a happy life upon
earth, and for Immortality in heaven. And in this they are not only the
seed of the Evil Mind personified, but his servants rallying at his
word.

6\. Their leader is striving energetically, so he mournfully bewails, to
effect his evil ends; but it is time that he should recall the
counteracting measures of Ahura. His holy doctrines are to be announced,
and their authority established by the divine Khshathra, His Sovereign
Power personified.

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

7\. The composer then contemplates with religious irony the infatuated
security of the wretched delinquents whom he is apostrophising. Not a
man of them knows the destruction which awaits him, and which, as he
intimates, is close at hand, but Ahura, he significantly exclaims, is
aware of it. And it will be proportionably severe. The blindness of
sinners to danger seems as definite a judgment upon them in his estimate
as their blindness to the truth.

8\. To point his anger with an instance he names the apostate Yima, whom
he supposes to have erred in first introducing the consumption of the
flesh of cattle. He disavows community with him as with them all,
declaring himself separate from them in Ahura's sight.

9\. He acknowledges that their leader has to a certain degree defeated
his teachings, and impaired the just estimates of life which he had
striven to form within the people, (or that he will do this if not
checked), declaring also that he had made inroads upon his property,
which was sacred to the holy cause. And he cries aloud to Ahura and to
Asha with the words of his very soul.

10\. He repeats that their leader threatens to invalidate his teachings,
blaspheming the supreme object of nature, the Sun, together with the
sacred Kine, injuring the productive land, and carrying murder among the
saints.

11\. He utters his bitter wail in view of attempted slaughter, and
actual spiritual opposition. He points out the plots among the powerful
and their illegal confiscation of inheritances, as well those of women
as those of men. And he declares that his opponents are endeavouring to
injure his adherents, as if repelled by the best spiritual qualities
which an individual could possess.

12\. He announces the solemn judgment of God upon it all, especially
reprobating those who deal treacherously against the mystical Kine; that
is, the holy herds and people, and apostrophising those who prefer the
Gr*e*hma above the saving and sanctifying Asha, and the Kingdom of the
Lie-demon above the Divine Khshathra.

13\. He declares that Gr*e*hma, an opposing chief, desired that evil
kingdom in the abode of the personified Hell. And he cannot refrain from
adding that he also enviously desires to share in the holy apostleship.
But, as he severely rejoins, the messenger of God will hold him afar
from the sight of the (Divine) Righteousness. He can have no share in
the Faith.

(Here it may be noticed that we have some data for presenting

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

the main features of the struggle. In several instances, centring
perhaps in the actual description of a battle in XLIV, 15, 16, we see
traces of the closeness of the controversy. In XLIV, 15, the two hosts
seem to be closing in regular lines for the 'holy vows themselves.'
Here, on the other hand, we read of willing complaint or 'regretful
desire,' while judicial blindness is referred to over and over again
under various phrases. One might suppose that the Daêva-party were very
near the Zarathu*s*trians in many of their religious peculiarities, but
that they could not accede to, or understand, the dualism. After the
manner of Pagans they implicated the Gods in their sins. (Compare the
drunken Indra.) At all events a bitter and violent war of doctrines was
waging with both speech and weapons. I think it looks like the struggle
'of two parties' who each claimed to be the proper representative of
some similar form of faith, similar, of course I mean, outwardly.)

14\. Deploring the establishment of the Kavis who approach with
stratagems and false teachings to aid the opposing party, the composer
declares that they say that the Kine herself is to be injured instead of
blessed by the very fire-priest who kindles <span
id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_276.md) the altar-flame.

15\. He supports himself however with the hope of ultimate success, and
with the prospect of his reward, when he and his fellow-labourers should
be gloriously borne to heaven by Weal and Immortality, the 'eternal
two,' who not only, as we see, bear saints to bliss, but also constitute
the beatitude of heaven itself.

16\. He confides all at last to Ahura, who is able to control all
events, and to solve all doubts, and who will support his servants in
bringing the wicked to vengeance by means of verbal instructions and
commands.

Translation.

(That rival-monarch (thus we may supply the sense of lost verses) for
whom some are plotting to secure the sovereignty, and who, once in
power, would deliver over home, village, town, and province to ruin and
to death <span id="fr_278"></span>[2](#fn_277.md), is active in his
efforts, and offering

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

the devotions of his false religion to accomplish his ends.) 1.
His <span id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_278.md) lord-kinsman will pray <span
id="fr_280"></span>[2](#fn_279) (as I Zarathu*s*tra prayed.md), and his
labouring villagers, with his (trusted) peers, and his (fellow)
Daêva-worshippers <span id="fr_281"></span>[3](#fn_280.md). But in my mind
is the friendship <span id="fr_282"></span>[4](#fn_281.md) of Ahura Mazda,
the Great Creator, the living Lord; and Thine heralds, O Ahura! may we
be; may we hold back <span id="fr_283"></span>[5](#fn_282.md) those who
hate and who offend You!

2\. To these (for whom the prophet spake) Ahura Mazda answered,
ruling <span id="fr_284"></span>[6](#fn_283.md) as He does through His Good
Mind (within their souls), He replied from His Sovereign Power, our good
friend (as he is) through His surpassing <span
id="fr_285"></span>[7](#fn_284.md) Righteousness: We have accepted

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

your good and bountiful Piety, and we have chosen her; ours shall she
be <span id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_285.md)!

3\. But you, O ye Daêvas! are all a seed from the Evil Mind <span
id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_286.md). He who offers sacrifice <span
id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_287.md) to You the most <span
id="fr_289"></span>[4](#fn_288) is of the Lie-demon, and (he is a child.md)
of perversion <span id="fr_290"></span>[5](#fn_289.md). In advance <span
id="fr_291"></span>[6](#fn_290) (are your.md) deceits whereby ye are famed
in the sevenfold <span id="fr_292"></span>[7](#fn_291.md) earth!

4\. For ye (are) confusing our thoughts <span
id="fr_293"></span>[8](#fn_292.md), whereby men, giving forth the worst
deeds, will speak <span id="fr_294"></span>[9](#fn_293.md), as of

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

the Demon-gods beloved, forsaken by the Good Mind <span
id="fr_295"></span>[1](#fn_294), (far.md) astray from the understanding of
the Great Creator, the Living Lord, and (far astray) from His
Righteousness!

5\. Therefore ye would <span id="fr_296"></span>[2](#fn_295.md) beguile
mankind of happy life <span id="fr_297"></span>[3](#fn_296) (upon earth.md)
and of Immortality (beyond it), since the Evil Spirit (has ruled) you
with his evil mind. Yea, he has ruled <span
id="fr_298"></span>[4](#fn_297) you, (ye.md) who are of the Demon-gods, and
with an evil word unto action, as his ruler <span
id="fr_299"></span>[5](#fn_298) (governs.md) the wicked <span
id="fr_300"></span>[6](#fn_299.md)!

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

6\. Full of crime (your leader) has desired to destroy <span
id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_300.md) us, wherefore he is famed, (and his
doctrine is declared); but if this be so of these, then in the same
manner, O Ahura! Thou possessest <span id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_301.md)
(because Thou knowest) the true (teachings) in Thy memory <span
id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_302.md). And in Thy kingdom and Thy Righteous
Order I will establish Thy precepts (in Thy name) <span
id="fr_304"></span>[4](#fn_303.md).

7\. Among these wretched beings <span id="fr_305"></span>[5](#fn_304.md)
(this their leader <span id="fr_306"></span>[6](#fn_305).md) knows not that
those things <span id="fr_307"></span>[7](#fn_306.md) which are declared

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

as victorious <span id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_307) (by his allies.md) are
bound together for the smiting; yea, those things by which he was famed
(as victorious) by his (blade of) glittering iron <span
id="fr_309"></span>[2](#fn_308.md). But the utter destruction <span
id="fr_310"></span>[3](#fn_309.md) of those things Thou, O Ahura Mazda!
knowest <span id="fr_311"></span>[4](#fn_310.md), most surely <span
id="fr_312"></span>[5](#fn_311.md)!

8\. Of these wretched beings <span id="fr_313"></span>[6](#fn_312.md) Yima
Vîvanghusha was famed to be; he who, desiring to content <span
id="fr_314"></span>[7](#fn_313.md) our men, was eating kine's flesh in its
pieces. But from <span id="fr_315"></span>[8](#fn_314) (such as.md) these,
O Ahura Mazda! in Thy discerning discrimination, am I (to be seen as
distinct <span id="fr_316"></span>[9](#fn_315).md).

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

9\. An evil teacher (as that leader is), he will <span
id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_316) destroy (our.md) doctrines, and by his
teachings he will pervert the (true) understanding of life, seizing
away <span id="fr_318"></span>[2](#fn_317) (from me.md) my riches <span
id="fr_319"></span>[3](#fn_318), the choice and real wealth of (Thy.md)
Good Mind. To You and to Asha, O Ahura Mazda! am I therefore crying with
the voice of my spirit's <span id="fr_320"></span>[4](#fn_319) (need.md)!

10\. Aye, this man will destroy my doctrines (indeed, for he blasphemes
the highest of creatures that live or are made). He declares that the
(sacred) Kine <span id="fr_321"></span>[5](#fn_320.md) and the Sun are the
worst of things which eye can see; and he will offer the gifts of the
wicked (as priest to their Demon-gods). And at the last he will
parch <span id="fr_322"></span>[6](#fn_321.md) our meadows with drought,
and will hurl his mace at Thy saint (who may fall before his arms <span
id="fr_323"></span>[7](#fn_322).md).

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

11\. Yea, these will destroy my life, for they consult with the
great <span id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_323.md) of the wicked (enlightening
themselves by their words <span id="fr_325"></span>[2](#fn_324).md). And
they are seizing away <span id="fr_326"></span>[3](#fn_325.md) the gifts of
inherited treasures <span id="fr_327"></span>[4](#fn_326.md) from both
household-lord and from house-wife <span
id="fr_328"></span>[5](#fn_327); (wretched men that they are.md), and those
who will fiercely wound (my folk, repelled and in no way kindly moved)
by the better mind of the holy <span id="fr_329"></span>[6](#fn_328.md).

12\. (But Ahura will speak His rebuke, for) as to those doctrines which
(such) men may be (basely) delivering <span
id="fr_330"></span>[7](#fn_329) (repelled.md) by the holiest action, (and
galled <span id="fr_331"></span>[8](#fn_330) by its sacred truth.md) God
hath said: Evil (are they! Yea, unto these He hath said it) who have
slain the Kine's life by a blessing (and have cursed her while they
offered to help her <span id="fr_332"></span>[9](#fn_331).md), men by whom
Gr*e*hmas are loved above Righteousness, and the Karpans,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

and the Throne of those who have wished <span
id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_332.md) for the Demon of lies (as their deity
and friend <span id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_333).md).

13\. And the Gr*e*hma will seek <span id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_334.md)
for these things by means of his (evil) kingdom <span
id="fr_336"></span>[4](#fn_335.md) in the abode of (Hell which is <span
id="fr_337"></span>[5](#fn_336)) the Worst Mind (who both are together.md)
the destroyers of life, and who, O Mazda! will bewail <span
id="fr_338"></span>[6](#fn_337) with glad but (envious.md) wish the message
of Thy prophet. (But he will not abate with his vengeance), he will hold
them afar from the sight <span id="fr_339"></span>[7](#fn_338.md) of the
truth!

14\. His is Gr*e*hma <span id="fr_340"></span>[8](#fn_339.md); aye, his!
And to (oppose) Thee <span id="fr_341"></span>[9](#fn_340.md) he will
establish the Kavis and (their) scheming

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

plans. Their deeds <span id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_341.md) of power are
but deceits since they have come as an aid to the wicked <span
id="fr_343"></span>[2](#fn_342), and since he has been (falsely.md) said
(to be set) to conquer the Kine <span id="fr_344"></span>[3](#fn_343.md),
he who shall kindle that (very) help of grace which removes our death
afar, (and lightens Thy saving flame).

15\. And therefore will I drive from hence <span
id="fr_345"></span>[4](#fn_344.md) the Karpans’ and Kavis’ disciples. And
after these (have thus been driven hence and away) then these (my
princely aiding saints) whom they (now) render no longer rulers at will
over life, (and deprive of their absolute power), these shall be borne
(at

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

last) by the (immortal <span id="fr_346"></span>[1](#fn_345).md) two to the
home of (Thy) Good Mind (in Heaven) <span
id="fr_347"></span>[2](#fn_346.md)!

16\. (And) this entire <span id="fr_348"></span>[3](#fn_347.md) (reward of
the righteous) is from that Best One who teaches <span
id="fr_349"></span>[4](#fn_348) in the wide (mental.md) light of the
pious <span id="fr_350"></span>[5](#fn_349), ruling (as supreme.md), O
Mazda Ahura <span id="fr_351"></span>[6](#fn_350.md)! whose are my woes and
my

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

doubtings <span id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_351.md) (yea, they lie in His
power to heal), when I shall make (my prophets) men to be sought <span
id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_352.md) for the harm of the wicked. And this I
shall do by the word of my mouth (to defend and avenge my saints)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_276"></span>[56:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_277.md) See, however, the
notes.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[56:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_278.md) Compare XXXI, 15,
18.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[57:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_279.md) Some prominent
teacher, representing the entire Daêva-party, is alluded to; see verses
6, 7, 9, 10.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[57:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_280.md) Compare yâsâ in
XXVIII, 2.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[57:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_281.md) Or, 'his are the
Daêvas;' but the verb yâsa*t* perhaps affords a sufficient expression
for Daêvâ; yâsen or he*n*tî may be understood. We may also understand
the Daêvas here, as the embodied Daêvas, in the manner in which the
pious worshipper is called Vohu Manah. That Daêva should however be used
quite simply for Daêva-worshipper in this early composition is not
probable. In the later Avesta it is frequent usage.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[57:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_282.md) Or, 'the friend;' I
recoil as much as possible from abstracts, but the Pahlavi has
hû-ravâkh-manîh, and Geldner admirably proposed brahman.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[57:5](sbe31010.htm#fr_283.md) Aîgh*s*ân min Lekûm
lakhvâr yakhsenunêm; so the Pahlavi translation, first venturing on the
meaning 'holding back from;' dar in the sense of pâ, which latter in
Iranian can mean hold back from advantages as well as from misfortunes.
High modern authority coincides with the most ancient authority on this
latter point. It is apt to be a subject of scepticism with some who
neglect the evidence of tradition.

<span id="fn_283"></span>[57:6](sbe31010.htm#fr_284.md) 'Pavan sardârîh î
Vohûman;' Ner. svâmîtâyâm\*. It seems difficult to apply the meaning
'being as a refuge' here; see the following 'from His Kingdom.'

<span id="fn_284"></span>[57:7](sbe31010.htm#fr_285.md) Lit. 'glorious.'
This casts light upon the expression *hv*anvaitî*s* verezô.

<span id="fn_285"></span>[58:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_286.md) Aîgh Spendarma*d*
Lekûm raî *s*apîr dôshêm \[bûndak mini*s*nîh\] zak î lanman aîtŏ
\[aîghmânŏ pavan tanû mâhmân yehevûnâ*d*\]. Neryosangh: To these the
Great Wise (One), the Lord, answered in the lordship of the highest
(best) mind; \[that is, if, or since, Gvahmana had arrived, as a guest,
within (their) body\]; from Saharevara he answered \[ \] through (their)
righteousness, from the well-inclined, and through good conduct, \[if
truly good conduct had arrived as a guest within (their) body\]. And he
said: I befriend your Earth (so Âramaiti was later understood), the
perfect-minded one, and your highest one; she is mine \[ \].

<span id="fn_286"></span>[58:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_287.md) Compare Yasna XXX,
6. Where the Daêvas are approached by the worst mind as they are
consulting.

<span id="fn_287"></span>[58:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_288.md) As those who offer
sacrifice to these Daêvas are mentioned separately, we are forced to
concede a large idea to the composer. He addresses the Daêvas as
poetically conceived to be present, and not merely their worshippers as
in verse 1. And this must have its weight in the exegesis of other
passages.

<span id="fn_288"></span>[58:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_289.md) The Pahlavi
translator has kabed. Or ma*s* for mashyô (?).

<span id="fn_289"></span>[58:5](sbe31010.htm#fr_290.md) Or possibly
arrogance, avarmîni*s*ntar; Ner. apamanastara*sk*a.

<span id="fn_290"></span>[58:6](sbe31010.htm#fr_291.md) Sâtûnînê*d* freely,
but indicating the root. The word is a locative.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[58:7](sbe31010.htm#fr_292.md) The seven
karshvars, or quarters of the earth, were already known.

<span id="fn_292"></span>[58:8](sbe31010.htm#fr_293.md) I correct frô m*e*
(= man) mathâ (adj. nom. pl.; compare yimâ keredushâ and ma mashâ). I do
so after the admirable reading of the Pahlavi translator, a*s* frâz
mîni*s*nŏ var*d*înê*d* \[aîgha*s* barâ frîfê*d*, afa*s* mîni*s*nŏ barâ
avŏ vinâs kar*d*anŏ var*d*înê*d*\]. Ner. prak*ri*sh*t*a*m*
mana*h*—mathnâti. Notice that a*k*i*s*tâ is awkward as a masc., although
I have so rendered as more personal.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[58:9](sbe31010.htm#fr_294.md) Vakhshye*n*tê stood
in the ancient writing used by the Pahlavi translator, as also now in
some of our surviving MSS.; otherwise <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>
reading vakhshe*n*tê with Justi and most others, and mîmathâ with
Bartholomae: 'Ye have caused that men who produce the worst results are
flourishing, loved of the Daêvas (as they are).' But in the Casuslehre,
Hübschmann preferred 'sie sprechen was den Devas angenehm ist,' also
reading vakhshe*n*tê (?) (page 240).

<span id="fn_294"></span>[59:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_295.md) So the Pahlavi also
indicates a*s*ân Vohûman sîzd; Ner. Gvahmana*h*\* dûre\* âste.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[59:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_296.md) Improper
subjunctive; otherwise ye (have) beguiled.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[59:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_297.md) The Pahlavi also
freely frîfê*d* an*s*ûtâân pavan hû-zîvi*s*nîh.

<span id="fn_297"></span>[59:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_298.md) Fra*k*inas far from
necessarily means 'gave'; 'assigned,' 'indicated' renders it more
closely. The Pahlavi has here correctly, but freely, *k*âshê*d*.

<span id="fn_298"></span>[59:5](sbe31010.htm#fr_299.md) The Pahlavi has
here *s*alîtâîh for khshayô, and in XXVIII, 8 it has pâ*d*akhshâ for
khshayâ. I do not think that the word is an accusative there. A simple
accusative does not so naturally fall to the end of the sentence in
Gâthic; it is generally in apposition when so situated. The nominatives
tend toward the end of the sentence.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[59:6](sbe31010.htm#fr_300.md) Ner.: It is through
both of these that he is deceiving (sic, unable to follow the Pahlavi
which probably renders as a second plural; see mûn lekûm) mankind in
regard to prosperity and immortality, \[(saying) if it is possible to
live, immortality lies in our path\]. Since he is yours, O ye
base-minded! O ye base Devas! he is inculcating the lowest actions \[of
the miscreants; he says that sovereignty \[is from Âharmana; (that is,
the sovereignty) of certain ones (meaning over every one)\].

The Gâthic verbatim is as follows: Therefore ye beguiled (would beguile)
man of-happy-life, of-immortality-and since you with-evil mind (you)
who-(are)-and Daêvas’ (worshippers) the evil-and spirit with an-evil
(-word as concerning) action with-word (rules), by <span id="page_60">p.
60</span> which (same) means (has-)commanded the wicked (his) ruler
(nom. sing. masc.; see Y. XXVIII, 8). The nom., as in Vedic, at the end.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[60:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_301.md) Or, Full of crime
ye have striven to attain your ends (?) by those things which are
reported. (If verse 5 originally preceded) *e*nakh*s*tâ would naturally
be regarded as a singular as paouru-aênâo is an impossible plural
masculine. It might, however, be a singular used collectively. In that
case we could put the verb in the plural with verse 5 in view. As to
concrete or abstract, the first is obviously correct, and is also so
rendered by the Pahlavi translation.

<span id="fn_301"></span>[60:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_302.md) Vid (with the perf.
vaêdâ) seems to occur in the Gâthas in this sense. Or, 'Thou knowest
with the Best Mind.'

<span id="fn_302"></span>[60:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_303.md) Or 'in the
memorised recital;' Ner. praka*t*a*m* kalayati.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[60:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_304.md) Parsi-persian MS.:

<span id="fn_304"></span>[60:5](sbe31010.htm#fr_305.md) The Pahlavi has
kînîkânŏ.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[60:6](sbe31010.htm#fr_306.md) The *hv*aêtu of the
first verse, the du*s*sasti of the ninth, &c.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[60:7](sbe31010.htm#fr_307.md) The Pahlavi
curiously errs with his rôshanŏ = clear; Ner. parishphu*t*atara*h*. It
would be straining a point to call him free in interpreting what is
'collected' and so 'obvious' as 'clear.' We must, however, never forget
that the supposed error of the Pahlavi is sometimes the reflex of our
own (often necessary) ignorance. Vîdv*a*u must refer back to the same
subject as a yâ in the first verse, or possibly to Aka Manah, going a
step further back.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[61:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_308.md) Possibly, 'which
are by Thee announced as destined and proper to be smitten.' The Pahlavi
has mûn zani*s*nŏ âmûkhtênd (sic). Jôyâ = jâyâ to jan, as âkâyia is to
kan.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[61:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_309.md) Compare other
allusions to weapons, snaithi*s*â, and possibly dakhshtem.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[61:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_310.md) So also the
Pahlavi, ristak and pâ*d*afrâs.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[61:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_311.md) Naê*k*î*t* vîdv*a*u
and vaêdi*s*tô ahî are in antithesis and emphatic.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[61:5](sbe31010.htm#fr_312.md) A literal rendering
of this difficult verse would be as follows: Of these wretches, nothing
knowing (is he that) for the smiting (dat. jâ, jan; cp. form Sk. jâ,
jan) (are) the-collected-things, which things (as) victorious (read
jayâ) are declared forth, by which things) he has been heard (of)
through glittering iron, of which things Thou, O-Ahura I the ruin,
O-Mazda! most knowing art. Others take s*e*nghaitê in the sense of 'cut'
(?) and render very differently.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[61:6](sbe31010.htm#fr_313.md) The Pahlavi has
shedâân; Ner. tân dveshi*n*a*h*.

<span id="fn_313"></span>[61:7](sbe31010.htm#fr_314.md) Or 'teaching,' so
the Pahlavi; Ner. samâsvâdayati.

<span id="fn_314"></span>[61:8](sbe31010.htm#fr_315.md) The Pahlavi
translator hits the true rendering here: 'from among these I am chosen
out by Thee.' Otherwise we have a question: Am I of these? The allusion
is to the fall of Yima. As to the first eating of the flesh of beasts,
recall Genesis ix. 3. Some have rendered: With regard to these I am of
Thine opinion, O Mazda (?).

<span id="fn_315"></span>[61:9](sbe31010.htm#fr_316.md) The Pahlavi may be
rendered as follows: Among (of) these demons Yima of the Vîva*n*hânas is
famed to have been a wicked scourge. It was he who taught men thus: Eat
ye our flesh in pieces \[wide as the beast, long as the arm—(or better
with West, 'in lapfuls and armfuls')\]. From among these \[ \] I am
chosen out by Thee, O Aûharmazd! hereafter; \[that is, even by Thee I am
considered as good\].

<span id="fn_316"></span>[62:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_317.md) An improper
subjunctive. Otherwise: He (has) destroyed (not irretrievably, of
course; the case was not decided, and finally issued favourably).

<span id="fn_317"></span>[62:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_318.md) Apô—ya*n*tâ;
otherwise 'they would take'; Ner. apaharati.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[62:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_319.md) Zak î li îshtî
avôrtŏ \[—khvâstak î pavan dastôbar\].

<span id="fn_319"></span>[62:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_320.md) Pavan valman*s*ân
milayâ î mînavadîhâ; Ner. vâgbhi*h* mânasav*ri*ttyâ aham—âkrandaye (not
following our present Pahlavi text, the gloss however). Observe that in
reading Ner. we by no means ipso facto read the Pahlavi, either in
correct translation, or as following our texts., Compare XLVI, 2.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[62:5](sbe31010.htm#fr_321.md) One thinks somewhat
of the familiar foes of the Vedic kine; but there can be of course no
connection. The Iranian sacred Cow did not represent the rain cloud, at
least not at all directly.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[62:6](sbe31010.htm#fr_322.md) Read viyâpa*t* as a
demon. without sign: 'v' was miswritten for 'y' as often 'y' for 'v.'
The Pahlavi language, not to speak of the Pahlavi translation, suggests
it. How are we to account for the word vîyâvânînê*d*? We should not
arrest our philology at the Zend and Sanskrit. The long vowel is most
awkward for a comparison with the Indian vap = shear. And I think that
'destroying the means of irrigation' gives good a meaning as 'shearing
the land.' Notice that elsewhere a more correct form appears, vîâpôtemem
(Vd. III, 15, (51 Sp.))=viyâpôtemem.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[62:7](sbe31010.htm#fr_323.md) Literally, 'he will
discharge his club at the righteous.'

<span id="fn_323"></span>[63:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_324.md) The Pahlavi
translator erroneous, or free, as to *k*ikôitere*s*, indicates the
proper sense of mazibî*s* by pavan masâî \[—pavan pêshpâyîh va
pâspâyîh—\]; but Neryosangh, mahattayâ-pura*h*-saratayâ.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[63:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_325.md) Comp. XXXI, 12,
'there high his voice lifts the truthful or liar.'

<span id="fn_325"></span>[63:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_326.md) Literally, 'he
takes.'

<span id="fn_326"></span>[63:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_327.md) Riknah vindi*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[63:5](sbe31010.htm#fr_328.md) Ka*d*ak-khû*d*âî
gabrâ nê*s*man.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[63:6](sbe31010.htm#fr_329.md) Reshînênd; see V,
10. The ablative of the cause, comp. ashâ*t* ha*k*â; otherwise with
Hübschm., 'Sie die Schaden nehmen mögen durch den besten heiligen Geist,
O Mazda!' (Casuslehre, s. 241.)

<span id="fn_329"></span>[63:7](sbe31010.htm#fr_330.md) The Pahlavi
translator had probably before him a text reading rashayen; he renders
freely rêsh srâyênd. With such a text which is far preferable to the one
afforded by the MSS. we may read: Whereby (yéna) men will be opposing
and retarding (literally wounding) the doctrines which (are derived)
from the best (moral and ceremonial) action; but to these men Mazda
declared: Evil (are ye). See the previous verse.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[63:8](sbe31010.htm#fr_331.md) See the previous
verse.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[63:9](sbe31010.htm#fr_332.md) The Pahlavi has
hû-ravâkh-manîh yemalelûnd.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[64:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_333.md) So also indicated
by the Pahlavi bavîhûnd.

<span id="fn_333"></span>[64:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_334.md) There is elsewhere
evidence enough of a desire to encroach upon the truth.

<span id="fn_334"></span>[64:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_335.md) So also indicated
by bavîhûnê*d*.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[64:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_336.md) Or, 'which
kingdoms, sovereign power.'

<span id="fn_336"></span>[64:5](sbe31010.htm#fr_337.md) Comp. XXX 6.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[64:6](sbe31010.htm#fr_338.md) Or, 'they gladly
complain;' so also the Pahlavi: Mûn—garzi*s*nŏ kâmak. The singular
*g*îgereza*t* is difficult with yaê*k*â. Many would alter the text at
once, and the temptation is great.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[64:7](sbe31010.htm#fr_339.md) Hübschm., 'y*e*
î*s* pâ*t* daresâ*t* ashahyâ der sie abhalte vom Schauen des Asha'
(Casus. 241). So of XLVI, 4. So also indicated by pâ*d*ênd mîn
nikêzi*s*nŏ î Aharâyîh; evidence of a struggle, or at least of a desire
on the part of a rival party to possess themselves of some religious
privilege or precedence. See the previous verse; also XXXI, in: Never, O
Mazda! never shall the thriftless and thieving one share the good
doctrine. See still further XLIV, 15, where the two hosts meet in
hostility 'on account of the doctrinal vows.'

<span id="fn_339"></span>[64:8](sbe31010.htm#fr_340.md) Gr*e*hma appertains
to, but is not the particular evil teacher referred to throughout. The
Pahlavi translator indicates bribery as the meaning of the word.
Possibly some impious chieftain is meant whose procedure was of that
nature. The word omits in the plural.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[64:9](sbe31010.htm#fr_341.md) Â hôi; Thwôi is
difficult. Or (see Y. XLIV, 14), 'Thine understanding has subdued the
Kavis.' The Pahlavi translator renders masîh, as if he had read
ahuthwôi, offering an important alternative. <span id="page_65">p.
65</span> Read: In his dominion he has established the Kavis and their
intended plans. Reading hôithôi, 'his G. is to be bound.'

<span id="fn_341"></span>[65:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_342.md) The predecessors of
the Pahlavi translator seem to have understood the word var(e)*ka*u as
conveying the idea of power rather than that of brilliancy. He renders
freely pavan zak î varzânân avârûnŏ dânâkânŏ. Supposing the text to
stand, and not supplying a formation from var(e)z, we may hold that
there existed a var(e)*k* beside var(e)z, as there undoubtedly was a
har(e)*k* (see harek*e*) beside har(e)z. This casts light on the Vedic
vár*k*as.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[65:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_343.md) Amati*k* pa*d*îrênd
valman darvandân aîyyârîh \[ \] amati*k* avŏ Tôra zani*s*nŏ gûftŏ. The
sufferings of the sacred Kine form the central thought of much that
occurs.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[65:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_344.md) Can gâu*s* be a
genitive here? But if a nominative, must not y*e* refer to it? How then
could the Kine 'kindle' the aid of grace? A genitive looks difficult. It
is, however, accepted by Spiegel, although he renders differently from
my translation. The Pahlavi may give us invaluable relief here by
restoring the text. The ancient translator read vao*k*aya*t*. Reading
with him, we might render: When the Kine which (yâ?) caused a
death-removing help to be declared, was said to be meet for subjection
(or slaying, reading an infinitive from *g*an). This rendering is more
probable than that from sao*k*aya*t*. The Kine distinctly caused this
help to be declared. See XXIX. But I make it a matter of principle to
follow the MSS. in a first translation, where that is at all possible.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[65:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_345.md) The Pahlavi
translator differs greatly here, having taken anâi*s* with adverbial
force, and as possessing the a priv. (they being <span id="page_66">p.
66</span> not inclined). He also read somewhat as follows: anâi*s*
avaênî(?) as y*e* = from his non-inclination he was blind who (belongs
to the Karpan and to the Kavi). Whether a truer text is indicated by him
here is doubtful on account of XLIV, 13, and its nâshâmâ; but the
unvarying explanation of the Kavis as blind probably derives its origin
from some such reading here, or elsewhere in lost documents.

Certainly if âi*s* can be used as a particle, anâi*s* is not altogether
impossible in some such sense. Moreover, the Pahlavi translation here
and elsewhere has afforded us such a multitude of valuable concretes,
that we shall do well to think twice before we reject its most startling
suggestions. Lit. trl. 'what (things are) of the K.'

<span id="fn_345"></span>[66:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_346.md) The Pahlavi
translation gives a fine suggestion in the concrete sense here; seeing
the dual âbyâ, it explains it as referring to Haurvatâ*t* and
Ameretatâ*t*, which is very probably correct. So Spiegel also renders.
It is very difficult to decide in which sense y*en*g dai*n*tî nôi*t*
jyât*e*u*s* khshayaman*en*g vasô is to be taken. If in an evil sense (as
vas*e*-khshaya*n*t is sometimes elsewhere taken) one might think of such
a rendering as this: I have driven the Karpans' and Kavis' disciples
hence to those (evil rulers) whom they (my servants) render no longer
wanton tyrants over life. But these (my champion saints) shall be borne
by the two to the home of Thy Good Mind. But strict grammar demands of
us that tôi should refer back to y*en*g. Accordingly I suggest as above
first.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[66:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_347.md) Observe that Vohu
Manah equals heaven. Recall XXX, 4, 'but for the holy Vahi*s*ta Manah;
that is heaven.'

<span id="fn_347"></span>[66:3](sbe31010.htm#fr_348.md) The Pahlavi has
ham; Neryosangh has sarvam.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[66:4](sbe31010.htm#fr_349.md) Reading
sâ*k*(a)yãs*k*î*t* (P<sup>11</sup>, s*k*yas*k*î*t*; Pahlavi,
âmûkhti*s*nŏ (sic); Ner., *s*ikshâpa*n*a*m*). Otherwise syas*k*î*t*,
which may well mean 'lying, reposing' in the wide (mental) light of the
pious (or of the offering). Geldner lately admirably suggests a 2nd sg.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[66:5](sbe31010.htm#fr_350.md) Pavan farâkhû
hûshîh.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[66:6](sbe31010.htm#fr_351.md) If this 'best one'
is the Ratu of XXXIII, 1, all is grammatically clear; but the
expressions are rather strong in view of <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>
XLVIII, 9, where similar language is certainly applied to Ahura. If
Ahura is here meant, we have only one instance more to add to the many
in which Ahura is spoken of in the third person, with an address to Him
thrown in. See the differing views of XLV, 11. Possibly the 'Best One'
was Ahura's Spe*n*ta Mainyu.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[67:1](sbe31010.htm#fr_352.md) Zak î pavan
gûmânîkîh. As to âithi, âithiva*n*t seems to prove that its meaning must
be calamity also in this place. Otherwise one is strongly tempted to
heed the vigorous indication of the Pahlavi translator. Here and in
XLVIII, 9, he renders 'manifest,' 'what is clear in the midst of my
doubt.' The etymology would be far simpler. Alternatively dvaêthâ =
terror (bî).

<span id="fn_352"></span>[67:2](sbe31010.htm#fr_353.md) Valman î pûmman
khvâstâr. The Pahlavi sees 'to be desired' in ishy*en*g. Otherwise one
might render: I will cause (verbal) missiles (comp. zastâ-i*s*tâi*s*) to
be cast forth from the mouth for the harm of the wicked.

(SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE. 'Parch with drought' in verse 10 may be regarded as
having figurative application. The destruction of the means of
irrigation, so often resorted to in the same regions later, would point
also to a literal sense, but 'waste our meadows like drought' is a safer
expression. See further vivâpa*t*, and vî âpem = vîyâpa*t*, viyâpem.)
