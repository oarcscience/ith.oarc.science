### II. ÂFRÎN\[-AGÂN\] <span id="fr_1547"></span>[4](#fn_1522) GÂTHA <span id="fr_1548"></span>[4](#fn_1522.md).

1\. As the Ahû is (revered and) to be chosen, so (is) the Ratu (one who
rules) from the Righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness, and of
life's actions done for Ahura, and the Kingdom (is) to Mazda, which to
the poor may offer a nurturer.

I confess myself a Mazda-worshipper—for the praise of Ahura Mazda, the
resplendent, the glorious, and of the Bountiful Immortals, for the
bountiful and

holy Gâthas which rule in the ritual order. (Propitiation and praise be)
to the Gâtha Ahunavaiti, and to the Gâtha U*s*tavaiti, to the Gâtha
Spe*n*tâ-mainyu, and to the Gâtha Vohu-khshathra, and to the Gâtha
Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti. 2. Propitiation to the Fravashis of the saints, the
mighty, overwhelming, even to those of the saints of yore, who held the
primeval faith (the Gâthic faith), and to those of the next of kin.

3\. We sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the glorious; and we
sacrifice to the Amesha Spe*n*ta who rule aright, and who dispose (of
all aright). And we sacrifice to the bounteous and holy Gâthas, which
rule (as the first) in the ritual order.

We sacrifice to the Gâtha Ahunavaiti, the holy, as it rules in the
ritual order; and we sacrifice to the Gâtha U*s*tavaiti, the holy, as it
rules in the ritual order; and we sacrifice to the Gâtha
Spe*n*tâ-mainyu, the holy, as it rules in the ritual order; and we
sacrifice to the Gâtha Vohu-khshathra, the holy, as it rules in the
ritual order; and we sacrifice to the Gâtha Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti, the holy,
as it rules in the ritual order. 4 = Yt. XIII, 49-52 <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1521"></span>[372:3](sbe31101.htm#fr_1546.md) As in 18.

<span id="fn_1522"></span>[372:4](sbe31102.htm#fr_1548.md) Recited during
the days called after the Gâthas, the last five of the year. A long
period of time must have elapsed since the Gâthas were composed, as they
probably were not originally 'five,' and yet seem to have been only
remembered as such.

<span id="fn_1523"></span>[373:1](sbe31102.htm#fr_1549.md) Verses 5, 6 = Â.
I, 14-18; for verse 6, see verses 1, 2; also see Â. I, 19.
