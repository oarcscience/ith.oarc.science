### YASNA XXIV.

#### .

1\. (And having approached these Haomas with our worship), we present
them to Ahura Mazda; (yea, we present) these Haomas, Myazdas, Zaothras,
and the Baresman spread with punctilious sanctity, and the flesh, and
the milk, fresh as if living, and lifted up with punctilious sanctity,
and this branch the Hadhânaêpata likewise lifted up with sanctity.

2\. (And having approached these Zaothras in our worship), we present
them to the good waters having the Haoma with them, and the milk, and
the Hadhânaêpata, and lifted up with scrupulous sanctity; and (with
them) we present the Haoma-water to the good waters, and both the stone
and the iron mortar.

3\. And we present this plant of the Baresman, and the timely prayer for
blessings, which has approached in the due course of the ritual, and the
recollection and practice <span id="fr_1166"></span>[1](#fn_1157.md) of the
good Mazdayasnian Religion, and the heard recital of the Gâthas, and the
timely prayer for blessings which has approached as the prayer of the
holy lord of the ritual order; and these wood-billets, and the perfume,
(even) thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son! and all good objects
Mazda-made, which have the seed of righteousness, we offer and present.
4. And these we present hereby to Ahura Mazda, and to Sraosha
(Obedience) the

Fravashis of the saints, even to the souls of the saints, and to the
Fire of Ahura Mazda, the lofty lord of entire holy creation, for
sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and for praise.

5\. And these we present hereby to the Fravashi of Zarathu*s*tra
Spitâma, the saint, for sacrifice, propitiation, and for praise, and to
that of the people <span id="fr_1167"></span>[1](#fn_1158.md) who love
Righteousness, with all the holy Fravashis of the saints who are dead
and who are living, and to those of men who are as yet unborn, and to
those of the prophets who will serve us, and will labour to complete the
progress and renovation of the world <span
id="fr_1168"></span>[2](#fn_1159.md).

6\. And we present these Haomas, Myazdas, Zaothras, and the Baresman
spread with sanctity, and the flesh, and the milk (fresh as if) living,
and lifted up with sanctity, and the Hadhânaêpata branch.

7\. And we present these Zaothras to the beneficial waters having the
Haoma with them, and the flesh, and the Hadhânaêpata lifted up with
sanctity, and the Haoma-water, to the good waters, with the stone and
iron mortars, (8) and this plant of the Baresman, (and) the timely
Prayer and the recollection and practice of the good Mazdayasnian
Faith <span id="fr_1169"></span>[3](#fn_1160.md), and these wood-billets,
and the perfume, thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son! and all objects
which are Mazda-made, and which have, and are, the seed of
Righteousness, these we offer and present.

9\. (Yea,) we present these hereby to the Bountiful Immortals who rule
aright, and who dispose of all

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

aright, the ever-living, ever-helpful, who abide with the Good Mind (of
