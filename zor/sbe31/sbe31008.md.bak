### YASNA XXX.

#### THE DOCTRINE OF DUALISM.

1\. Accustomed to instruct the masses who throng him on public occasions
seeking light, the composer constructs this hymn for similar
opportunities. He may be regarded as continuing the thoughts in the
close of Y. XXVIII, where he besought Ahura to inform him concerning the
origin of the world. He says that he will declare the counsels of God,
by which, as we see, he means the great doctrines concerning the origin
of good and evil. With these he will declare also the praises, the
laudatory portions of the Mãthra, and the sacrifices. And he prays that
propitious results may be discerned in the heavenly bodies.

2\. He further introduces what he has to say by telling the throngs
before him that a decisive moment is upon them. They are to choose their
religion, and not by acclamation with the foolish decision of a mob, but
man by man, each individually for himself. They should therefore arouse
themselves and hear with all attention, and gaze at the holy Fire with a
good and receptive disposition of mind.

3\. He then delivers the earliest statement of dualism which has come
down to us. There were two original spirits, and they are called, be it
well noted, not two persons, or at least not only two persons, but a
better thing, or principle, and a worse one. (The qualifying words are
all in the neuter <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_131)..md)

At the next sentence they are personified as a pair, each independent in
his thoughts, declarations, and actions. Such is the short Theodicy,
followed at once by an admonition to those before him to choose the
better.

4\. These two spirits came together as by natural combination, to make
the opposing phenomena of life and its absence, of Heaven and of Hell.

And Hell is described not as a scene of cruelty inflicted on the
innocent and the ignorant, but as 'the worst life,' and Heaven as
equally remote from a superstitious paradise; that is, as the 'best
mental state.'

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

This is the proper Zarathu*s*trian creation. It is undeniably
'abstract,' very, and just in proportion as it lacks colour and myth are
its depths visible. The account of it is also very limited. But it must
never be forgotten that its existence is the probable proof that very
much more of the kind existed beside it. Instead of there being one hymn
sung like this, Y. XXX, there were probably many. The two original
forces or beings, although separate clearly, come together; but they do
not lose their distinction. Their difference remains as clear as their
union. 5. They do not blend unrecognisably; for having created the two
principles, they choose each his own particular realm. Ahura chooses the
righteous order of religion, and with it the pious of all ages. The evil
spirit chooses the wicked.

The point and meaning of the entire doctrine is that a good God cannot
be responsible for permanent evil; that imperfection and suffering are
original, and inherent in the nature of things, and permanently so. The
swallowing up of sin and sorrow in ultimate happiness belongs to a later
period. It is not Gâthic Zarathu*s*trianism. Evil was the work of an
independent being.

The great thinker saw his point; and it was that the Deity Himself could
not prevent the evolution of base and revolting moral qualities with
their consequent miseries in both victim and aggressor. An evil God was
therefore their author.

6\. But the blood-feuds of War, not to speak of the theological
animosity, were too much for his philosophy. The sage could not regard
all men and their circumstances with broad and equable impartiality.

The hated Daêva-worshippers, who were doubtless equally conscientious
with the Zarathu*s*trians, are said to have failed of correct
discernment.

As they were deliberating, so he recalls, the Worst Mind, a very real
although 'abstract' Satan, came upon them, to induce them to choose him
and his evil realm. They acceded, becoming furious in their intention to
injure human life. This may be regarded as a dramatic, but at the same
time, in a moral sense, a philosophical statement of a temptation and
fall. (For a later one, with more colour and less truth, see the
temptation proper of Zarathu*s*tra himself <span
id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_132.md), recalling as it does so vividly the
temptation in the Gospels.)

7\. If we can accept the words ahmâi*k*â to mean merely 'upon

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

this,' we may hold that the statements proceed without a break. Even a
gap of lost verses does not interrupt the sense. The clothing of souls
with bodies seems indicated. If so, the doctrine of the Fravashis,
otherwise foreign to the Gâthas, may have its origin by inference here,
and directly in verse 4. After the creation and first activity of the
souls of the Archangels on the one hand, and of the Daêvas on the other,
together with their respective human adherents, the one choosing good
and the other evil, the remaining Ameshôspends unite with Âramaiti in
bestowing a body upon the newly created soul. (So we must conclude from
the language.) And the prophet breaks in with the prayer that in the
future, and possibly at the Frashakar*d*, the completion of progress,
these created souls might possess such advantages as they had when Ahura
came at first with his acts of creation; that is, that they might be
restored again to a state of sinless happiness, provided with bodies by
Âramaiti as at the first. (See Ya*s*t XIX, 89.)

8\. But, as he implies, and perhaps expresses in a lost verse, vengeance
shall come upon the wretched beings who choose the Evil Mind as their
master. And it shall come, not in the abstract merely by any means, but
as executed by a numerous, if not once predominant party, 'the offspring
of the Evil Mind.' And when this shall have been completed (and XXXI, 18
shows us that the weapons to be used to bring it about were not to be
those of verbal argument alone) then, as he declares with enthusiasm,
'to God shall be the Kingdom,' a Kingdom established in the Divine
Benevolence, which will pervade its organic life, and which will
likewise, as the personified 'Immortal,' utter encouragements and
commands to its loyal citizens. And these citizens will then not only
defeat the Lie-demon, who is the life of the Daêva-party, but they will
deliver her up as a captive to the great Genius of Truth, the
personified Righteousness. 9. And, as he ardently hoped for the coming
of the Kingdom into the hands of Ahura, he as ardently beseeches that he
and his coadjutors, the princes already named, may be honoured as the
immediate agents in bringing on this 'millennial' completion; nay, he
even prays that they may be as Ahuras <span
id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_133.md) in merciful services, declaring that all
their thoughts were centred in that scene where religious light dwelt as
personified in her home.

10\. Once more he announces the certain defeat and chastisement of the
incarnate falsehood and her adherents, which enables

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

him only the more impressively to describe the rapid reunion of the
righteous amid the home-happiness of Heaven.

11\. Having delivered his brief but weighty communication, he commends
his hearers for learning the holy vows of the Religion on account of the
duration of the announced rewards and punishments. They shall be long
indeed; and upon their complete inauguration full salvation shall be
realised for those who shall have learned and heeded the invaluable
truths.

Translation.

1\. And now I will proclaim, O ye who are drawing near and seeking <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_134.md) to be taught! those animadversions <span
id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_135.md) which appertain to Him who knows (all
things) whatsoever; the praises which are for Ahura, and the sacrifices
(which spring) from the Good Mind, and likewise the benignant
meditations inspired by Righteousness. And I pray <span
id="fr_137"></span>[3](#fn_136.md) that propitious results may be seen in
the lights.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

2\. Hear ye then with your ears; see ye the bright flames <span
id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_137) with the (eyes of the.md) Better Mind. It
is for a decision as to religions, man and man, each individually for
himself. Before the great effort of the cause, awake ye <span
id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_138) (all.md) to our <span
id="fr_140"></span>[3](#fn_139.md) teaching!

3\. Thus are the primeval spirits who as a pair <span
id="fr_141"></span>[4](#fn_140) (combining their opposite strivings.md),
and (yet each) independent in his action, have been famed (of old).
(They are) a better thing, they two, and a worse <span
id="fr_142"></span>[5](#fn_141.md), as to thought, as to word, and as to
deed. And between these two let the wisely acting choose aright. (Choose
ye <span id="fr_143"></span>[6](#fn_142)) not (as.md) the evil-doers <span
id="fr_144"></span>[7](#fn_143.md)!

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

4\. (Yea) when the two spirits came together at the first to make <span
id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_145.md) life, and life's absence <span
id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_146.md), and to determine how the world at the
last shall be (ordered), for the wicked (Hell) the worst life, for the
holy (Heaven) the Best Mental State <span
id="fr_148"></span>[3](#fn_147.md),

5\. (Then when they had finished each his part in the deeds of creation,
they chose distinctly each his separate realm.) He who was the evil of
them both (chose the evil), thereby working <span
id="fr_149"></span>[4](#fn_148.md) the worst of possible results, but the
more bounteous spirit <span id="fr_150"></span>[5](#fn_149.md) chose the

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Divine)
Righteousness; (yea, He so chose) who clothes upon Himself the
firm <span id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_150.md) stones of heaven (as His
robe). And He chose likewise them who content Ahura with actions, which
(are performed) really in accordance with the faith <span
id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_151.md).

6\. And between these two spirits the Demon-gods (and they who give them
worship) can make no righteous choice <span
id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_152.md), since we have beguiled <span
id="fr_154"></span>[4](#fn_153.md) them. As they were questioning and
debating in their council <span id="fr_155"></span>[5](#fn_154.md) the
(personified <span id="fr_156"></span>[6](#fn_155).md) Worst Mind
approached them that he might be chosen. (They made their

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

fatal decision.) And thereupon they rushed together unto the Demon of
Fury, that they might pollute <span id="fr_157"></span>[1](#fn_156.md) the
lives of mortals <span id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_157.md).

7\. Upon this <span id="fr_159"></span>[3](#fn_158.md) Âramaiti (the
personified Piety of the saints) approached, and with her came the
Sovereign Power, the Good Mind, and the Righteous Order. And (to the
spiritual creations of good and of evil) Âramaiti gave a body, she the
abiding and ever strenuous <span id="fr_160"></span>[4](#fn_159.md). And
for these (Thy people) so let <span id="fr_161"></span>[5](#fn_160.md)
(that

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

body) be (at the last), O Mazda! as it was when Thou camest first with
creations <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_161.md)!

8\. And (when the great struggle shall have been fought out which began
when the Daêvas first seized the Demon of Wrath as their ally <span
id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_162)), and when the (just.md) vengeance shall
have come upon these wretches, then, O Mazda! the Kingdom shall have
been gained for Thee by (Thy) Good Mind (within Thy folk). For to those,
O living Lord! does (that Good Mind <span
id="fr_164"></span>[3](#fn_163).md) utter his command, who will deliver the
Demon of the Lie into the two hands <span
id="fr_165"></span>[4](#fn_164.md) of the Righteous Order (as a captive to
a destroyer).

9\. And may we be such as those who bring on

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

this great renovation, and make this world progressive, (till its
perfection shall have been reached). (As) the Ahuras of Mazda <span
id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_165) (even) may we be; (yea, like Thyself.md),
in helpful readiness to meet <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_166.md) (Thy
people), presenting (benefits <span id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_167).md) in
union with the Righteous Order. For there <span
id="fr_169"></span>[4](#fn_168) will our thoughts be (tending.md) where
true wisdom shall abide in her home <span
id="fr_170"></span>[5](#fn_169.md).

10\. (And when perfection shall have been attained) then shall the blow
of destruction fall upon the Demon of Falsehood, (and her adherents
shall perish with her), but swiftest in the happy abode of the Good Mind
and of Ahura the righteous saints

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

shall gather, they who proceed in their walk (on earth) in good
repute <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_170) (and honour.md) <span
id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_171.md).

11\. Wherefore, O ye men! ye are learning <span
id="fr_173"></span>[3](#fn_172) (thus.md) these religious incitations which
Ahura gave in (our) happiness <span id="fr_174"></span>[4](#fn_173.md) and
(our) sorrow <span id="fr_175"></span>[5](#fn_174.md). (And ye are also
learning) what is the long wounding for the wicked, and the blessings
which are in store for the righteous. And when these (shall have begun
their course), salvation shall be (your portion <span
id="fr_176"></span>[6](#fn_175).md)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_131"></span>[25:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_132.md) It is also
noticeable that the name Angra Mainyu does not occur in this section.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[26:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_133.md) Comp. Vd. XIX,
1-10. Consider how much time would be required for the name of
[Zarathu*s*tra](errata.htm#0.md) to become so involved in myth.

<span id="fn_133"></span>[27:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_134.md) As the Ahuras of
Mazda, the Ameshôspends.

<span id="fn_134"></span>[28:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_135.md) As 'ish' means
approaching with desire, the Pahlavi translator has, freely,
khvahî*s*no.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[28:2](sbe31008.htm#fr_136.md) Read mãzdathâ.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[28:3](sbe31008.htm#fr_137.md) So with long ê; but
yaê*k*â (P<sup>11</sup> supported by the Pahl.) may be the lost dual
neuter of the pronoun, referring to the two principles discussed below.
Yê\**k*â = I pray for, although the most natural rendering
grammatically, does not seem so well adapted here, as a prayer for the
success of his communication does not harmonise with the otherwise
dogmatic statements of the composer. The urvâtâ (vrata) founded upon the
doctrine of dualism bring about salvation. They may therefore be touched
upon in this introductory verse. And that the heavenly bodies contained
indications bearing directly or indirectly upon human destiny seems to
have been early an accepted doctrine. (Compare also chap. XXIX, 3, where
'the lofty fires' seem alluded to as moved by the Deity, and this in
immediate connection with the discussion of the most important problems
concerning the fate of the holy community.) It is, however, not
impossible that the lights of the altar may have been meant. (See sû*k*â
in the second verse.) The Pahlavi translation <span id="page_29">p.
29</span> has dên rôshano pavan vêni*s*nŏ hû-ravâkh-manîh. As to
yê\**k*â or yaê*k*â, the Pahlavi does not favour a verbal form. But if
the pronoun is accepted, even then change is needed; yaê*k*â yâ = yé*k*a
yéna is hardly possible. We should be obliged to render: And which two
things (were those?) whereby (adverbially) propitious results have been
seen in the stars. Others have experienced difficulty, and even
ashayaê*k*â(?) has been conjecturally suggested for this place and chap.
LI, 2. Neither Sp. nor Westg. report a long ê.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[29:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_138.md) Gôshânŏ srû*d*
nyôkhshi*s*nîh \[aîgha*s* gôsh barâ va*s*ammûn*d*\]—Zak î rôshanŏ.
Otherwise 'with the eye;' but see yâ rao*ke*bî*s* daresatâ urvâzâ. The
altar-flame would not unnaturally be mentioned after the heavenly
lights.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[29:2](sbe31008.htm#fr_139) Literally, '(be ye.md)
wakeful.'

<span id="fn_139"></span>[29:3](sbe31008.htm#fr_140.md) Hardly, to teach
us.' Possibly, 'to teach this, each one.'

<span id="fn_140"></span>[29:4](sbe31008.htm#fr_141.md) Pahl. transcribes.
Notice that paouruyê (pourvîyê) is neut. <span
id="fr_145"></span>[\*](#fn_144.md) as are vahyô and akem*k*â, which is not
lightly to be passed over.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[29:5](sbe31008.htm#fr_142.md) The Pahlavi freely:
Benaf*s*man—\[aîgh*s*ânŏ vinâs va kirfak benaf*s*man barâ
yemalelûn*d*\]. They announced themselves as sin and good works. Ner.
yau pu*n*ya*m* pâpa*mk*a svaya*m* avo*k*atâ*m*.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[29:6](sbe31008.htm#fr_143.md) Barâ vi*g*î*d*.
Ner. vibhaktavân\*. If a third plural subjunctive, still the force is as
if imperative. Possibly it is preterit.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[29:7](sbe31008.htm#fr_144.md) On this important
verse I cite Neryosangh. He may be rendered as follows: Thus the two
spirits \[Hormi*g*da and Âharmana\] who uttered first in the world each
his own (principle); \[that is, who each uttered one his own good
(deed), and the other his own sin\], these were a pair, in thought,
word, and deed, a highest <span id="page_30">p. 30</span> and a degraded
one. And of these two, the one endowed with good intelligence \[ \] was
the distinguisher of the true, and not the one endowed with evil
intelligence \[ \]. (Both he and the Pahlavi fail to credit a plural
form in ere*s* vîshyâtâ with Spiegel and Hübschmann.)

The Gâthic verbatim. Yea (= thereupon) the-two the-two-spirits
the-two-first-things which-two two-twins two-self-acting-ones
were-heard-of in-thought in-word-and in-deed these-two a-better
an-evil-and. Of-which-two-and the wisely-acting (ones) aright may
discern, not the evil-acting ones.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[29:\*](sbe31008.htm#fr_145) Adverb (?.md).

<span id="fn_145"></span>[30:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_146.md) The Pahlavi read as
an infinitive, dazdê = avŏ zak dahi*s*nŏ. (So also an important
authority recently.) Otherwise it has the place of a third dual perfect;
'they two made.' The place of an infinitive is not generally at the end
of a sentence in Gâthic. Can it be simply a third singular? '(Each)
makes' (*k*amasâ´ karóti).

<span id="fn_146"></span>[30:2](sbe31008.htm#fr_147.md) Pavan zendakîh—va
mûni*k* azendakîh. Ner. *g*îvitena*k*a a*g*îvitena*k*a. Observe the
singular abstract a*g*yâitî*mk*â, which is not lightly to be passed
over. Why not a more ordinary expression? Have we not here an unusual
antithesis? The danger is great that by aiming to reduce all to
commonplace for the sake of safety, we may demolish many an interesting
conception of antiquity.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[30:3](sbe31008.htm#fr_148.md) Observe the
subjectivity. These verses settle the question as to the depth of the
Zarathu*s*trian hymns. Grammar forces us to see that the composer had
large ideas. The entire cast of reflection in the Gâthas tends to be
abstract as well as subjective. Not so their invective and partisan
exhortations.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[30:4](sbe31008.htm#fr_149.md) Verezyô is a nom.
sing. masc., as would seem natural from its position in the sentence.
Compare mãthrâi*s* verezyâi*s*.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[30:5](sbe31008.htm#fr_150.md) Observe that Ahura
is undoubtedly called speni*s*ta mainyu. Elsewhere we must sometimes
render, 'His bountiful spirit.'

<span id="fn_150"></span>[31:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_151.md) Zak î sakht sag
nihûftŏ âsmâni*k*. Ner. Gâ*dh*ataram\* âkâ*s*a*m* dadau.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[31:2](sbe31008.htm#fr_152.md) 'Who with actions
really good piously content Ahura.' Let it be noticed that fraore*t* is
not independently translated by the Pahlavi. It is freely included in
avŏ Aûharmazd; and yet this is supposed by some to be a word-for-word
rendering! Ner. praka*t*âi*sk*a karmabhi*h*.

Verbatim. Of-these-two spirits he-chose-to-himself (he)-who (was) the
evil (the one) the worst (deeds) working\*. The-Righteous-Order
(accusative) (chose) the spirit most-bountiful (he-)who the most-firm
stones clothes-on-himself, (those) who-and will-content Ahura with real
actions believingly Mazda.

(Properly a verbatim rendering is only possible in an inflected
language.)

<span id="fn_152"></span>[31:3](sbe31008.htm#fr_153.md) La râstŏ
vi*g*inênd. They suffer judicial blindness; a common idea in the Gâthas;
compare, 'who holds them from the sight of the truth,' &c.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[31:4](sbe31008.htm#fr_154.md) The root is
indicated by va mûni*k* valman*s*ân frîft. I can see no escape from the
above rather adventurous rendering. See also dafshnyâ he*n*tû in chap.
LIII, 8. Perhaps the idea of injury here preponderates over that of
deceit; 'since we have impaired their power.' The choice between a
preterit or an improper subjunctive is also difficult. Possibly, 'so
that we may fatally deceive them.' Poss. nom. 'deception came upon them,
even A.M.'

<span id="fn_154"></span>[31:5](sbe31008.htm#fr_155.md) This recalls
Vendîdâd XIX, 45, where the demons assemble in council to consider the
advent of Zarathu*s*tra.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[31:6](sbe31008.htm#fr_156.md) Compare verse 4,
where Vahi*s*tem Manô equals heaven. The <span id="page_32">p. 32</span>
word is the subject of '*g*asa*t*,' and has the proper place of a
nominative in the sentence; cp. Vedic usage.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[32:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_157.md) That they might
disease (so literally) the lives of those who had not yet been tempted
or fallen.

The Pahlavi: Vîmârtnî*d*ŏ ahvân î mar*d*ûmân \[aîgh, \#\#\#evatman aêshm
an*s*ûtâân ahûkînên*d*\].

Ner.: Ye ni*g*aghnur bhuvana*m* manushyânâ*m*.

Hübschmann: 'um durch ihn Plagen über das Leben des Menschen zu
bringen.'

<span id="fn_157"></span>[32:2](sbe31008.htm#fr_158.md) Verbatim. Of these
two spirits not aright may choose the Daêvas, since these we have
beguiled (or have injured). To the-questioning ones upon came-he
in-order-that he might-be-chosen (subjunctive middle) he-the worst mind.
Thereupon to-furious-rapine they rushed-together in-order-that (yena)
they might disease (or ruin) the-life of-man.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[32:3](sbe31008.htm#fr_159.md) Or, 'to him;' some
unnamed benefactor; hardly 'to us.' The Pahlavi has, avŏ valman, but
Ner. has only tatra*k*a. Observe ahmâi in chap. XLIII, 1, and in chap.
XLVII.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[32:4](sbe31008.htm#fr_160.md) Root ãn = in. The
Pahlavi freely, pavan astûbîh. He seems to have thought of nam + a priv.

Kehrpem is feminine. Ãnmâ may be a neuter in apposition.

Otherwise we must accept -mâ as a suffix. Or can kehrpem (corpus) be a
neuter here? The clothing of the spirits with corporeal natures enabled
them to advance in the development of moral qualities by self-restraint
and pursuit. As has been observed in the summary, no Fravashis appear in
the Gâthas. Have we here possibly an indication of the pre-existence of
souls? If Âramaiti gave a body, it may be inferred that a period elapsed
between the acts of the two spirits and this.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[32:5](sbe31008.htm#fr_161.md) That bodies are to
be given to the saints as at the first is to <span id="page_33">p.
33</span> be inferred from Ya*s*t XIX, 89. (Which see in part ii of the
translations of the Zend-Avesta.)

<span id="fn_161"></span>[33:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_162.md) Verbatim. To-this
(to us?)-and with-Khshathra came, with-Manah Vohu, with Asha-and
(Âramaiti) thereupon a-body the-continuing gave Âr(a)maiti the strenuous
(Âramaiti, or the body, a vigorous and strenuous thing).

Of these thine (or to thee) to let-it (the body)-be as thou-tamest
in-creations the-first.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[33:2](sbe31008.htm#fr_163.md) See verse 6.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[33:3](sbe31008.htm#fr_164.md) What else can be
the subject of sastî?

<span id="fn_164"></span>[33:4](sbe31008.htm#fr_165.md) Observe the
pronounced personification of Righteousness. As a matter of course the
ultimate sense is more commonplace, as is the case with all poetical
matter. 'Into the hands of Asha,' is the same as to say, 'into the power
of the servant of God.'

But would this be a proper mode of rendering a line of real though
rudely primitive poetry? Such renderings are commentary rather than
translation. The Pahlavi may be rendered as follows: Thus also in that
creation \[in the final body\] hatred comes to these haters and sinners;
\[that is, the avengers shall execute chastisement upon them\]. And,
therefore, O Aûharmazd! what to thee is the sovereignty, by that (so
possibly) shall Vohûman give a reward. Through these, O Aûharmazd!
\[through the religion of Aûharmazd\], when one is instructed in
Righteousness, \[that is, as to the interests of the pious\] then the
Drû*g* is given into one's hand, \[the Drû*g* who is Aharmôk\].

<span id="fn_165"></span>[34:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_166.md) Otherwise, 'the
Ahura-Mazdas,' or, 'O Mazda and the Ahuras!' I think that the most
natural rendering according to the grammar should first be given,
notwithstanding something uncommon about it. 'All the Ahura-Mazdas,' has
been seen by Roth in chapter XXXI, 4.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[34:2](sbe31008.htm#fr_167.md) The Pahlavi has the
gloss \[aîgh*s*ân hamîshakŏ han*g*aman madam tanû î pasînŏ kûni*s*nŏ\],
needlessly enlarged of course, but showing the proper root, which is
mi*t*; (so Spiegel.)

<span id="fn_167"></span>[34:3](sbe31008.htm#fr_168.md) Or possibly
sustaining (the feeble). The Pahlavi reads simply dedrûni*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[34:4](sbe31008.htm#fr_169.md) The Pahlavi renders
hathrâ in the Indian sense as asâr\*, endlessly; so others elsewhere.
Hathrâ and yathrâ are of course distinctly in antithesis.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[34:5](sbe31008.htm#fr_170.md) The Pahlavi mihânŏ,
Persian makân. That maêthâ is an adverbial instrumental meaning, 'in
one's home,' seems the more probable from the two hathrâ, yathrâ,
adverbs of place. Compare, for instance, athrâ-yathrâ in XLVI, 16, where
shaêitî follows. Hübschmann, 'Dort mögen (unsre) Sinne sein, wo die
Weisheit thront;' see also hu*s*itôis in the next verse.

The Parsi-persian MS. has—Aedûnŏ (sic) ham mâ kih ân i tû hastam (sic);
\[kû ân i tû ‘hwê*s* hastam\] în—rastâ‘hiz kardan andar *g*ihân.

\(c\) Kih—mini*s*n bêd \[kû mini*s*n pah—dârad\] a*s* ân*g*â dânâî hast
\[kû, â‘hir i *k*îz pah nêkî bih dânad\] andar makân.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[35:1](sbe31008.htm#fr_171.md) Pahlavi, 'mûn
vâdûnd zak î *s*apîr nâmîkîh = they are creating a good repute,' as if
zaze*n*tê were understood in the sense of produce. See the sense 'bear'
as given for hâ, *Ri*g-veda 843, 2 (X, 17). The analogy is, however, not
strong.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[35:2](sbe31008.htm#fr_172.md) The Pahlavi
translation may here be rendered as follows: Thus in that dispensation
\[in the later body\] the Drû*g* \[who is Ganrâk Mînavad\] will be
overthrown \[ \] when (his) host is scattered. Thus they move keenly on
\[to seize the reward\], which is attained through the good citizenship
of Vohûman \[when they shall have dwelt in piety\]. They who are
creating a good renown are thus moving on toward Aûharmazd and
Ashavahi*s*t \[that is, the person who is of good repute goes forward to
seize the reward\].

<span id="fn_172"></span>[35:3](sbe31008.htm#fr_173.md) Once more the
anomalous form âmûkhti*s*nŏ meets us in the Pahlavi. May this not be
intended to express 'learning,' whereas âmûzi*s*nŏ would express
'teaching?' I hardly think so.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[35:4](sbe31008.htm#fr_174.md) The Pahlavi
translation is only remotely if at all responsible for *hv*îti*k*â as =
sua sponte. This would require *hv*îti as = \**hv*âti with difficulty
comparing 'yim' and 'y*e*m'(?). It is generally considered now as = hu +
iti; but the letter <span id="img_03500"></span> ![](img/03500.jpg) =
<span id="img_03501"></span> ![](img/03501.jpg) seems doubtful.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[35:5](sbe31008.htm#fr_175.md) Read anitî = 'with
impeded progress.' 'In prosperity or adversity.' But these are
conjectures.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[35:6](sbe31008.htm#fr_176.md) The Pahlavi: Aêtûnŏ
akhar valman*s*ân aîtŏ nadûkîh. I do not think that we ought to regard
the words of the original as expressing universal restoration. But they
may well have given the first indication toward this later view.
Literally, they state it, but not when correctly understood.

(SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE. The Pahlavi word yômâî which transcribes y*e*snâ in
verse 4 cannot mean 'by day.' Its imperfect form induced the translators
to translate rûzhâ and bhûmandale, but these scholars, as in many other
instances, hinted at a correction.)
