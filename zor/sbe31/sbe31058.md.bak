### YASNA LII (SP. LI).

#### A PRAYER FOR SANCTITY AND ITS BENEFITS.

1\. I pray with benedictions for a benefit, and for the good, even for
the entire creation of the holy (and the clean); I beseech for them for
the (generation which is) now alive, for that which is just coming into
life <span id="fr_1227"></span>[1](#fn_1217.md), and for that which shall
be hereafter. And (I pray for that) sanctity which leads to prosperity,
and which has long afforded shelter <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[2](#fn_1218.md), which goes on hand in hand with
it <span id="fr_1229"></span>[3](#fn_1219.md), which joins it in its walk,
and of itself becoming its close companion as it delivers forth its
precepts, (2) bearing every form of healing virtue which comes to us in
waters <span id="fr_1230"></span>[4](#fn_1220.md), appertains to cattle, or
is found in plants, and overwhelming all the harmful malice of the
Daêvas, (and their servants) who might harm this dwelling <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[5](#fn_1221) and its lord, (3.md) bringing good gifts,
and better blessings, given very early, and later (gifts), leading to
successes, and for a long time giving shelter <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[6](#fn_1222.md). And so the greatest, and the best,
and most beautiful benefits of sanctity fall likewise to our lot (4) for
the sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and the praise of the Bountiful
Immortals, for the bringing prosperity to this abode, and for the
prosperity of the entire creation of the holy,

and the clean, (and as for this, so) for the opposition of the entire
evil creation. (And I pray for this) as I praise through Righteousness,
I who am beneficent, chose who are (likewise of a better mind) <span
id="fr_1233"></span>[1](#fn_1223). 5-8. (See Y. VIII, 5-8..md) (For Y.
LIII, see Gâthas, pp.
[190](sbe31022.htm#page_190)-[194](sbe31022.htm#page_194)..md)
