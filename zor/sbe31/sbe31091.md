### VISPARAD XIV (SP. XVI) <span id="fr_1480"></span>[3](#fn_1466).

1\. (We worship Ahura Mazda, the holy Lord of the ritual order <span
id="fr_1481"></span>[4](#fn_1467); and we sacrifice to the Gâtha
Ahunavaiti) with its measures, and word-structure, and its Zand, with
its questions and counter-questions, with its words and its metric feet.
And we sacrifice to these as well-recited, and now in the course of
being recited; as well-worshipped, and now in the course of being used
in worship <span id="fr_1482"></span>[5](#fn_1468). 2. (Yea, we
sacrifice to it) in

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

its own 'wisdom' <span id="fr_1483"></span>[1](#fn_1469), in its own
'clearness' <span id="fr_1484"></span>[2](#fn_1470), in its own 'loving
intention' <span id="fr_1485"></span>[2](#fn_1470), in its sovereignty,
and its own ritual order, and its 'acquired boon' <span
id="fr_1486"></span>[2](#fn_1470), which is also that given by Ahura
Mazda for the promotion of piety, for that thought which originates from
the 'heart-devoted self' <span id="fr_1487"></span>[2](#fn_1470).

3\. (Sp. Chapter XVII.) Also we worship the Ahuna-vairya, the holy lord
of the ritual order, the holy lord with its Ahû and its Ratu \[(Pâzand);
for He is the one with the title Ahû and Ratu, who is Ahura Mazda <span
id="fr_1488"></span>[3](#fn_1471)\]. 4. And we sacrifice to the
constituent parts of the Gâtha Ahunavaiti, to its chapters, and its
metrical lines, its words, and word-structure, \[and to its
heard-recital, and memorised recital, its continuous and its steadfast
offering\].

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1466"></span>[356:3](sbe31091.htm#fr_1480) This fragment
was written in evident allusion to the entire Ahunavaiti, which it
follows in the Vendîdâd Sâdah. It expresses the veneration acquired by
the first Gâtha long after its composition.

<span id="fn_1467"></span>[356:4](sbe31091.htm#fr_1481) From the
Vendîdâd Sâdah.

<span id="fn_1468"></span>[356:5](sbe31091.htm#fr_1482) Frâyaze*n*tãm
may be a metaplasm; otherwise 'of the sacrificers.'

<span id="fn_1469"></span>[357:1](sbe31091.htm#fr_1483) Dãmi with K4.
Possibly in their own house (dãmi = dani).

<span id="fn_1470"></span>[357:2](sbe31091.htm#fr_1487) These words
probably allude severally, say, to dãm in Y. XXXI, 7, *k*ithrâ in Y.
XXXI, 22, zaoshê in Y. XXXIII, 2, 10, âyaptâ in Y. XXVIII, 8, to
zarzd*a*u in Y. XXXI, 1.

<span id="fn_1471"></span>[357:3](sbe31091.htm#fr_1488) Erroneous.
