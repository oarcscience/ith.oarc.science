### YASNA XXXVI.

#### TO AHURA AND THE FIRE.

1\. We would approach You two, O (Ye) primeval ones in the house <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[2](#fn_1187.md) of this Thy holy Fire, O Ahura Mazda,
Thou most bounteous Spirit! Who brings pollutions to this (Thy flame)
him wilt Thou cover with pollutions (in his turn). 2. But as the most
friendly do Thou give us zeal, O Fire of the Lord! and approach us <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[3](#fn_1188.md), and with the loving blessing of the
most friendly, with the praise of the

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

most adored. Yea, may’st thou approach to aid us in this our greatest
(undertaking) among the efforts of our zeal.

3\. The Fire of Ahura Mazda art thou verily <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1](#fn_1189.md); yea, the most bounteous one of His
Spirit, wherefore Thine is the most potent of all names (for grace), O
Fire of the Lord! 4. And therefore we would approach Thee, (O Ahura!)
with the help of Thy Good Mind (which Thou dost implant within us), with
Thy (good) Righteousness, and with the actions and the words inculcated
by Thy good wisdom!

5\. We therefore bow before Thee, and we direct our prayers to Thee with
confessions of our guilt, O Ahura Mazda! with all the good thoughts
(which Thou dost inspire), with all the words well said, and the deeds
well done, with these would we approach Thee. 6. And to Thy most
beauteous body <span id="fr_1200"></span>[2](#fn_1190.md) do we make our
deep acknowledgments, O Ahura Mazda! to those stars (which are Thy
body); and to that one, the highest of the high, \[such as the sun was
called\]!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1187"></span>[284:2](sbe31051.htm#fr_1197.md) Or, 'in the
service of the Fire;' so the Pahlavi: consider also the occurrence of
forms of var(e)z in the other sense in the close proximity. Fire temples
did not exist; some shelter, however, must have been afforded. Also the
dual pouruyê(-ve) may refer to Ahura and the Fire. Comp. Y. XXX, 3. Or,
is it 'at first?'

<span id="fn_1188"></span>[284:3](sbe31051.htm#fr_1198.md) Possibly, 'but
most favoured is he whom (y*e*m).'

<span id="fn_1189"></span>[285:1](sbe31051.htm#fr_1199.md) Vôi looks as if
it represented vâí here.

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[285:2](sbe31051.htm#fr_1200.md) See Y. I, 1.
