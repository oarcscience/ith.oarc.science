# THE YASNA.

IT is now hardly necessary to say that the Yasna is the chief liturgy of
the Zarathu*s*trians, in which confession, invocation, prayer,
exhortation, and praise are all combined as in other liturgies. Like
other compositions of the kind, it is made up of more or less mutually
adapted fragments of different ages, and modes of composition. The
Gâthas are sung in the middle of it, and in the Vendîdâd Sâdah, the
Visparad is interpolated within it for the most part at the ends of
chapters.

We have no reason to suppose that the Yasna existed in its present form
in the earlier periods of Zarathu*s*trianism, but we have also no reason
to doubt that its present arrangement is, as regards us, very ancient.
The word Yasna means worship including sacrifice. Introductory excerpts
occur in several MSS., and are now printed by Geldner. They are to be
found in Y. I, 23; Y. III, 25; Y. XI, 17, 18; Y. XXII, 23-27; Y. XXVII,
13, 14; Ny. I, 2.

### YASNA I.

#### THE SACRIFICE COMMENCES.

1\. I announce <span id="fr_879"></span>[1](#fn_877) and I (will.md)
complete (my Yasna) to Ahura Mazda, the Creator, the radiant and
glorious, the greatest and the best, the most beautiful (?) (to our
conceptions), the most firm, the wisest, and the one of all whose
body <span id="fr_880"></span>[2](#fn_878.md) is the most perfect, who

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

attains His ends the most infallibly, because of His Righteous Order, to
Him who disposes our minds aright <span id="fr_881"></span>[1](#fn_879.md),
who sends His joy-creating grace afar; who made us, and has fashioned
us, and who has nourished and protected us <span
id="fr_882"></span>[2](#fn_880.md), who is the most bounteous Spirit <span
id="fr_883"></span>[3](#fn_881.md)!

2\. I announce and I (will) complete (my Yasna) to the Good Mind, and to
Righteousness the Best, and to the Sovereignty which is to be desired,
and to Piety the Bountiful, and to the two, the Universal Weal and
Immortality, to the body of the Kine, and to the Kine's Soul, and to the
Fire of Ahura Mazda, that one who more than <span
id="fr_884"></span>[4](#fn_882) (all.md) the Bountiful Immortals has made
most effort (for our succour)!

3\. And I announce and I (will) complete (my Yasna) to the Asnya, the
day-lords of the ritual order, to Hâvani the holy, the lord <span
id="fr_885"></span>[5](#fn_883.md) of the ritual order; and I celebrate,
and I (will) complete (my Yasna) to Sâvanghi and to Vîsya, the holy
lord(s) of the ritual order. And I announce and (will) complete (my
Yasna) to Mithra of the wide pastures, of the thousand ears, and of the
myriad eyes, the Yazad of the spoken <span

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

4\. I announce and (will) complete (my Yasna) to Rapithwina, the holy
lord of the ritual order, and to Frâda*t*fshu, and to Za*n*tuma, the
holy lord(s) of the ritual order; and I celebrate and complete (my
Yasna) to Righteousness <span id="fr_887"></span>[1](#fn_885.md) the Best,
and to Ahura Mazda's Fire <span id="fr_888"></span>[1](#fn_885.md).

5\. I announce and complete (my Yasna) to Uzayêirina the holy lord of
the ritual order, and to Frâda*t*-vîra and to Da*hv*yuma <span
id="fr_889"></span>[2](#fn_886), the holy lord(s.md) of the ritual order,
and to that lofty Ahura Napâ*t*apãm (the son of waters), and to the
waters which Ahura Mazda <span id="fr_890"></span>[3](#fn_887.md) made.

6\. I announce and complete (my Yasna) to Aiwisrûthrima (and)
Aibigaya <span id="fr_891"></span>[4](#fn_888), the holy lord(s.md) of the
ritual order, and to Zarathu*s*trôtema, and to him who possesses and who
gives that prosperity in life which furthers all. And I celebrate and
complete (my Yasna) to the Fravashis of the saints, and to those of the
women who have many sons <span id="fr_892"></span>[5](#fn_889.md), and to a
prosperous home-life which continues without reverse throughout the
year, and to that Might which is well-shaped and stately <span
id="fr_893"></span>[6](#fn_890.md), which strikes victoriously, Ahura-made,
and to that Victorious Ascendency (which it secures).

7\. I announce and I complete (my Yasna) to Ushahina, the holy lord of
the ritual order, and to Bere*g*ya (and) Nmânya, the holy lord(s) of the
ritual order, and to Sraosha (who is Obedience) the blessed, endowed
with blessed recompense (as a thing

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

completed <span id="fr_894"></span>[1](#fn_891).md), who smites with
victory, and furthers the settlements, and to Rashnu <span
id="fr_895"></span>[2](#fn_892.md), the most just, and to Ar*s*tâ*t* <span
id="fr_896"></span>[3](#fn_893.md), who advances the settlements, and
causes them to increase.

8\. And I announce and I complete (my Yasna) to the Mâhya, the monthly
festivals, lords of the ritual order, to the new and the later <span
id="fr_897"></span>[4](#fn_894.md) moon, the holy lord of the ritual order,
and to the full moon which scatters night.

9\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to the Yâirya, yearly feasts,
the holy lords of the ritual order. I celebrate and complete (my Yasna)
to Maidyô-zaremya <span id="fr_898"></span>[5](#fn_895.md), the holy lord
of the ritual order, and to Maidyô-shema, the holy lord of the ritual
order, and to Paiti*s*hahya, and to Ayâthrima the advancer, and the
spender of the strength of males <span id="fr_899"></span>[6](#fn_896.md),
the holy lord of the ritual order, and to Maidhyâirya, the holy lord of
the ritual order, and to Hamaspathmaêdhaya, the holy lord of the ritual
order; yea, I celebrate and complete my Yasna to the seasons, lords of
the ritual order.

10\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to all those who are the
thirty and three <span id="fr_900"></span>[7](#fn_897.md) lords of the
ritual order, which, coming the nearest, are around about Hâvani, and
which (as in their festivals) were

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

inculcated by Ahura Mazda, and were promulgated by Zarathu*s*tra, as the
lords of Asha Vahi*s*ta, who is Righteousness the Best.

11\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to the two, to Ahura <span
id="fr_901"></span>[1](#fn_898.md) and to Mithra, the lofty, and the
everlasting, and the holy, and to all the stars which are Spe*n*ta
Mainyu's creatures, and to the star Ti*s*trya, the resplendent and
glorious, and to the Moon which contains the seed of the Kine, and to
the resplendent Sun, him of the rapid steeds, the eye <span
id="fr_902"></span>[2](#fn_899.md) of Ahura Mazda, and to Mithra the
province-ruler. And I celebrate and complete my Yasna to Ahura Mazda
(once again, and as to him who rules the month <span
id="fr_903"></span>[3](#fn_900).md), the radiant, the glorious, and to the
Fravashis <span id="fr_904"></span>[4](#fn_901.md) of the saints.

12\. And I announce and complete my Yasna to thee, the Fire, O Ahura
Mazda's son! together with all the fires, and to the good waters, even
to all the waters made by Mazda, and to all the plants which Mazda made.

13\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to the Bounteous Mãthra, the
holy and effective, the revelation given against the Daêvas <span
id="fr_905"></span>[5](#fn_902.md); the Zarathu*s*trian

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

revelation, and to the long descent <span
id="fr_906"></span>[1](#fn_903.md) of the good Mazdayasnian Faith.

14\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to the mountain
Ushi-darena <span id="fr_907"></span>[2](#fn_904.md), the Mazda-made, with
its sacred brilliance, and to all the mountains glorious with
sanctity <span id="fr_908"></span>[3](#fn_905.md), with their abundant
Glory Mazda-made, and to that majestic Glory Mazda-made, the
unconsumed <span id="fr_909"></span>[4](#fn_906.md) Glory which Mazda made.
And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to Ashi the good, the blessedness
(of the reward), and to *K*isti, the good religious Knowledge, to the
good Ereth*e* (Rectitude <span id="fr_910"></span>[5](#fn_907)?.md), and to
the good Rasãstâ*t* (persisting zeal <span
id="fr_911"></span>[6](#fn_908)?.md), and to the Glory and the Benefit
which are Mazda-made.

15\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to the pious and good
Blessing of the religious man <span id="fr_912"></span>[7](#fn_909.md), the
holy, and to the curse of wisdom, the swift and redoubted Yazad of
potency (to blight).

16\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to these places and these
lands, and to these pastures, and these abodes with their springs of
water(?) <span id="fr_913"></span>[8](#fn_910.md), and

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

to the waters, land, and plants, and to this earth and to yon heaven,
and to the holy wind, and to the stars, moon, and sun, and to the
eternal stars without beginning <span id="fr_914"></span>[1](#fn_911.md),
and self-disposing <span id="fr_915"></span>[2](#fn_912.md), and to all the
holy creatures of Spe*n*ta-Mainyu, male and female, the regulators of
the ritual order.

17\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to that lofty lord who is
the ritual Righteousness <span id="fr_916"></span>[3](#fn_913) (itself.md),
and to the lords of the days in their duration, and of the days during
daylight, to the moons, the years, and the seasons which are lords of
the ritual order at the time of Hâvani <span
id="fr_917"></span>[4](#fn_914.md).

18\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to the Fravashis of the
saints, the redoubted, which overwhelm (the evil), to those of the
saints of the ancient lore, to those of the next of kin, and to the
Fravashi of (mine) own <span id="fr_918"></span>[5](#fn_915.md) soul!

19\. And I announce and complete (my Yasna) to all the lords of the
ritual order, and to all the Yazads, the beneficent, who dispose (of
all) aright, to those both heavenly and earthly, who are (meet) for our
sacrifice and homage because of Asha Vahi*s*ta, (of the ritual Order
which is 'the best').

20\. O (thou) Hâvani, holy lord of the ritual order, and Sâvanghi,
Rapithwina, and Uzayêirina, and Aiwisrûthrima, (and) Aibigaya, (thou
that aidest

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

life!) if I have offended you, and thou, O Ushahina, holy lord of the
ritual order!

21\. If I have offended thee <span id="fr_919"></span>[1](#fn_916.md),
whether by thought, or word, or deed, whether by act of will, or without
intent or wish, I earnestly make up the deficiency of this in praise to
thee. If I have caused decrease <span id="fr_920"></span>[2](#fn_917.md) in
that which is Thy Yasna, and Thy homage, I announce (and celebrate <span
id="fr_921"></span>[3](#fn_918)) to thee (the more for this.md)!

22\. Yea, all ye lords, the greatest ones, holy lords of the ritual
order, if I have offended you by thought, or word, or deed, whether with
my will, or without intending error <span
id="fr_922"></span>[4](#fn_919), I praise you (now the more.md) for this. I
announce to you (the more) if I have caused decrease in this which is
your Yasna, and your praise.

23\. I would confess myself a Mazda-worshipper, of Zarathu*s*tra's
order, a foe to the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for Hâvani,
the holy lord of the ritual order, for (his) sacrifice, homage,
propitiation, and praise, for Sâvanghi, and for Vîsya, the holy lord of
the ritual order, for (his) sacrifice, homage, propitiation and praise,
and for the sacrifice, homage, propitiation and praise of the lords of
the days in, their duration, and of the days during daylight for

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

those of the monthly festivals, and for those of the yearly ones, and
for those of the seasons!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_877"></span>[195:1](sbe31023.htm#fr_879.md) Or, 'I invite;'
but the word seems equal to âvaêdhayêma; compare the Vedic vid + ni.
Comp. also nî tê vaêdhayêmi and nî vô vaêdhayêmi in Y. I, 21, 22. The
Pahlavi favours 'I invite.'

<span id="fn_878"></span>[195:2](sbe31023.htm#fr_880.md) Not that Ahura was
conceived of as having a body proper. The stars are elsewhere poetically
described as his body, as other <span id="page_196">p. 196</span>
divinities are said to be tanu-mãthra, having the Mãthra as their body;
that is, incarnate in the Mãthra.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[196:1](sbe31023.htm#fr_881.md) 'Disposing aright
as to mind.'

<span id="fn_880"></span>[196:2](sbe31023.htm#fr_882.md) Pahlavi parvar*d*.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[196:3](sbe31023.htm#fr_883.md) Elsewhere the
Spe*n*ta Mainyu is spoken of as His possession.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[196:4](sbe31023.htm#fr_884.md) The Fire seems
almost spoken of as one of the Amesha Spe*n*ta.

<span id="fn_883"></span>[196:5](sbe31023.htm#fr_885.md) Lords of the
ritual because ruling as chief at the time of their mention, and in thin
sense regarded as genii protecting all ritual seasons and times of their
class. Vîsya presides over the Vîs; Sâvanghi, over cattle.

<span id="fn_884"></span>[196:6](sbe31023.htm#fr_886.md) Having an especial
Ya*s*t.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[197:1](sbe31023.htm#fr_888.md) Constantly
associated together in the later Avesta.

<span id="fn_886"></span>[197:2](sbe31023.htm#fr_889.md) *hv* = h before y.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[197:3](sbe31023.htm#fr_890.md) As opposed to
those which might belong to Angra Mainyu.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[197:4](sbe31023.htm#fr_891.md) Or, 'who furthers
life.'

<span id="fn_889"></span>[197:5](sbe31023.htm#fr_892.md) 'Men and herds?'

<span id="fn_890"></span>[197:6](sbe31023.htm#fr_893.md) 'Well-grown.'

<span id="fn_891"></span>[198:1](sbe31023.htm#fr_894.md) I should say that
the suffix has this force here as in close connection with ashyô.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[198:2](sbe31023.htm#fr_895.md) Genius of
rectitude.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[198:3](sbe31023.htm#fr_896.md) Rectitude in
another form.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[198:4](sbe31023.htm#fr_897.md) Literally, 'to the
moon within,' showing little light.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[198:5](sbe31023.htm#fr_898.md) See the Âfrînagân.

<span id="fn_896"></span>[198:6](sbe31023.htm#fr_899.md) The rutting
season.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[198:7](sbe31023.htm#fr_900.md) Haug first called
attention to the striking coincidence with the Indian. In the Aitareya
and *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*as, in the Atharvaveda, and in the Râmâya*n*a,
the gods are brought up to the number thirty-three. The names differ
somewhat however. (See Essays, ed. West, 2nd edition, p. 276; see also
*R*v. 240, 9; 250, 2.)

<span id="fn_898"></span>[199:1](sbe31023.htm#fr_901.md) The star Jupiter
has been called Ormuzd by the Persians and Armenians, and it may be
intended here, as stars are next mentioned, but who can fail to be
struck with the resemblance to the Mitra-Varu*n*a of the *Ri*g-veda.
Possibly both ideas were present to the composer.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[199:2](sbe31023.htm#fr_902.md) Recall *K*akshur
Mitrasya Varu*n*asya Agne*h*.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[199:3](sbe31023.htm#fr_903.md) The first day of
the month is called Ahura Mazda.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[199:4](sbe31023.htm#fr_904.md) The first month is
called Fravashi. These are put for the particular day of celebration.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[199:5](sbe31023.htm#fr_905.md) This was the
Vendîdâd, the name being a contraction of vîdaêvâ-dâta. It will not be
forgotten that the Vendîdâd, although later put together, contains old
Aryan myths which antedate <span id="page_200">p. 200</span>
Zarathu*s*tra, although in its present greatly later form, Zarathu*s*tra
is a demi-god in it, and his name is involved in myth.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[200:1](sbe31023.htm#fr_906.md) 'The long
tradition;' so Spiegel.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[200:2](sbe31023.htm#fr_907.md) From this mountain
the Iranian kings were later supposed to have descended; hence the
mention of the 'glory.'

<span id="fn_905"></span>[200:3](sbe31023.htm#fr_908.md) Observe the
impossibility of the meaning 'comfort,' or mere 'well-being' here.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[200:4](sbe31023.htm#fr_909.md) Or possibly 'the
unseized,' the Pahlavi agrift(?); Ner. ag*ri*hîtâ*m*; *hv*ar, to eat,
may have meant 'seize' originally.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[200:5](sbe31023.htm#fr_910) Ereth*e* (*ri*ti?.md)
seems without inflection.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[200:6](sbe31023.htm#fr_911.md) The state of
activity (?).

<span id="fn_909"></span>[200:7](sbe31023.htm#fr_912.md) Shall we say, 'of
the departed saint' here?

<span id="fn_910"></span>[200:8](sbe31023.htm#fr_913.md) The Pahlavi with
its afkhvâr points here perhaps to a better text. Recall awzhdâtem*k*a,
awzhd*a*unghô, awrem.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[201:1](sbe31023.htm#fr_914.md) Meaning 'without
beginning to their course,' and so 'fixed' (?).

<span id="fn_912"></span>[201:2](sbe31023.htm#fr_915.md) Self-determining,
not satellites, having the laws of their own motion in themselves.

<span id="fn_913"></span>[201:3](sbe31023.htm#fr_916.md) The divine Order
par eminence, expressed in the ritual and the faith.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[201:4](sbe31023.htm#fr_917.md) Not 'to the chief
of Hâvani,' possibly 'in the lordship,' the time when it is especially
the object of worship. Thus each object of worship becomes in its turn a
'lord or chief' of 'the ritual order.'

<span id="fn_915"></span>[201:5](sbe31023.htm#fr_918.md) The soul of the
celebrant or his client is intended.

<span id="fn_916"></span>[202:1](sbe31023.htm#fr_919.md) Compare *R*v. VII,
86, 3-6.

<span id="fn_917"></span>[202:2](sbe31023.htm#fr_920.md) Practised, or
induced neglect, or omitted portions of it.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[202:3](sbe31023.htm#fr_921.md) 'I invite for
Thee' (?).

<span id="fn_919"></span>[202:4](sbe31023.htm#fr_922.md) That the thought,
word, and deed here were more than the mere semi-mechanical use of
faculties in reciting the liturgy, is clear. At the same time all
morality was supposed to be represented in the liturgy. The evil man
would offend in thought, word, and deed, if he recited it carelessly, or
with bad conscience, and as guilty of any known and unrepented sins. The
moral and ceremonial laws went hand in hand.
