<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This chapter, the second in the manuscripts of the G&acirc;tha Ahunavaiti, is placed here as in a more natural order. It may be regarded as containing the terminus a quo of the divine revelation. The Soul of the Kine, as representing the herds of the holy Iranian people, their only means of honourable livelihood, raises its voice, and expressing the profoundest needs of an afflicted people, addresses Ahura and His Divine Order, Asha, in bitterness.</p>  
<p>1. Recalling another and a later 'groan of the creation,' she demands wherefore and for whom she was made, since afflictions encompass her; and as her comfort, if not her existence, was threatened as much by the unsettled habits induced by constant alarms as by the actual incursions of her predatory neighbours, she beseeches the Bountiful Immortals to instruct her as to the benefits of civilised agriculture, and confirm her protectors in its practice, as her only remedy against the evils of which she complains.</p>  
<p>2. Ahura answers by a question to Asha, the personified Righteous Order, as to what guardian he had appointed in order to smite back the fury which assails her, intimating that some chief ought to have been set over her originally who would have averted her miseries, training her people in steady tillage and bucolic skill, and repelling the destructive raids.</p>  
<p>3. Asha answers that her sufferings were inevitable, that no chief could be appointed who could prevent them since none was himself without his share of injustice and of passionate resentment. He could not answer why this was the case. The question, involving the insolvable problem of the origin of evil, lay at the foundation of those influences which move the stars of destiny; that the religious revelation afforded by the Ratu (as in</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_4"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 4</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">chapter XXX) was intended to meet these problems so far as they could be answered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and that therefore all who were entering upon active enterprises were in the act of approaching, not him Asha, the subordinate archangel, but Mazda himself, who was the greatest of beings, and alone able to answer their prayers and questions.</p>  
<p>4. Zarathu<I>s</I>tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, poetically conceived to be present, here intervenes to reaffirm the homage just paid by Asha. He declares Ahura Mazda to be himself the most mindful of all the previously revealed assertions and directions uttered by himself, and fulfilled in the actions of both the Demon-gods of their enemies, and of good or evil men. He is also said to be fully cognisant of what they will do in the future, and to discriminate between what is good and evil as an infallible judge, allotting to us all our destiny in future sufferings or rewards. 5. Addressing Ahura and Asha, and uniting with the Kine's Soul in her supplication, he questions Mazda in his doubt, not in peaceful confidence, as later in the impressive hymn, each verse of which begins with the words, 'This ask I Thee, aright, Ahura! tell me!' but deprecating from himself, and constructively from the Kine, the impending destruction which he sees will justly fall upon the wicked as visited by the discriminating vengeance acknowledged to be Ahura's attribute (see verse 4). 6. At last Ahura, showing the intention of His questions, answers them himself; no regulating lord in full sympathy with the Righteous Order had as yet been discovered or discoverable, but He himself will make a selection. He therefore declares himself as solemnly appointing Zarathustra to that office.</p>  
<p>And Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, inspired by His Good Mind, and guided by His righteousness, will accomplish more than has as yet been done to rally the thrifty community, and settle their virtuous polity upon its desired basis of training and defence. 7. As Zarathustra is a listener in the colloquy between the Deity, the Kine's Soul, and Asha, the Righteous Order, so the other Immortals beside Asha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, here join in, as if the appointment just made had not been heard, or was incredible (see below). Mazda is indeed declared to have revealed the sacred Word-of-reason in harmony with the consenting Righteousness, and to have provided food for the Kine and</FONT></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">the needy consumers, but who was there adequately endowed with the Good Mind, who could promulgate that M&atilde;thra with its revealed directions as to sustenance of both body and mind?</p>  
<p>8. Ahura repeats his announcement of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, as if to silence the objections.</p>  
<p>As Zarathu<I>s</I>tra alone had heard the doctrines from the voice of inspiration, so he desired to declare them, and had authority to do so, together with a settled position of such a character as to make his statements felt.</p>  
<p>9. But an unexpected difficulty arises. The Kine's Soul is by no means impressed by the personality of the individual selected as her guardian. So far from being the demi-god of the other parts of the Avesta, Zarathu<I>s</I>tra's declarations are characterised by her as 'the voice of a pusillanimous man,' while she, on the contrary, expected one truly kingly in his rank and characteristics, and able to bring his desires to effect, while the Bountiful Immortals (or the attending chieftains), as if they had meant their question in verse 7 to be a question uttered in mere perplexity or contempt, join in with chorus, asking when indeed an effective helper will be provided.</p>  
<p>10. Zarathustra, undismayed by the coldness of his reception, enters at once upon his office as priest and prophet, praying Ahura for the people; and recognising the names of the 'Immortals,' Khshathra, Asha, and Vohu Manah, in their original sense, asks Ahura to grant to the people in their straits, a Sovereign Authority established in the Divine Order, and bestowing the needed quiet and happiness for which the suffering provinces, as represented by the Kine's Soul in her wail, had expressed their desire.</p>  
<p>And as he prays, he avows his own steadfast confidence in Ahura rather than in the Da&ecirc;vas, as the prime possessor and bestower of blessings.</p>  
<p>11. Then, as if eager to receive full equipment upon the spot, he not only beseeches for the Righteous Order, the Kingly Power of God, and His Good Mind for the masses as represented by the Kine, but asks when they are coming to him, and hastening; and he entreats Ahura to bestow His help at once for the great cause, and to a very abundant degree, upon himself and his associates. (It is singular that the name of &Acirc;ramaiti does not occur in this section.)</FONT></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_56"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_56">8:3</A> Or, 'He has done by Da&ecirc;vas?' If thus, absolute and not qualified sovereignty would be indicated. See the last line</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_57"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_57">8:4</A> Observe that while 'by Da&ecirc;va-worshippers' would be an admirable rendering for Da&ecirc;v&acirc;i<I>s</I>, because more commonplace and therefore safer, it is here impossible on account of mashy&acirc;i<I>s</I><I>k</I>&acirc;. We are closely confined to the acceptance of a large idea. Ahura was mindful of what transpired in the deeds of Da&ecirc;va-gods and not in those of Da&ecirc;va-worshippers alone. The inst. must be modified.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_58"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_58">8:5</A> As varshait&ecirc; is elsewhere used in an active sense, it is possible, but not probable, that a special predestination may be indicated. 'He shall do by means of Da&ecirc;vas and men.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_59"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_59">8:6</A> 'To us men,' not to us Amesh&ocirc;spends, of course!</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_60"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_60">8:7</A> Verbatim. Mazda the-words most-mindful which for have-been-fulfilled before by-means-of- (the actions of) Da&ecirc;vas-and men-and what-and (shall)-be-done after, He the discriminating lord; so to-us shall-it-be as He shall-choose.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_61"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_61">8:8</A> This seems to prove positively that a human being speaks here and in the previous verse; 'the soul of Righteousness' is of course impossible.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_62"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_62">8:9</A> Some have referred the word to the root zan obscurely present in it; otherwise a drivable cow; one mature and fit for use. The term used in the Vend&icirc;d&acirc;d in a common meaning as merely <A NAME="page_9"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 9</FONT></A> designating a cow at a certain age, may be the familiar use of an adjective here applied in the ancient G&acirc;tha in a sacred sense.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_63"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_63">9:1</A> This passage is one of the strongest for the comparison of Mazd<I>a</I>u and medh&acirc;. The sense 'asking wisdom in our doubt,' is admirable. I cannot however accept the comparison.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_64"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_64">9:2</A> Pavan g&ocirc;m&acirc;n&icirc;k&icirc;h hamp&ucirc;rs&acirc;n&icirc;; root d&icirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_65"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_65">9:3</A> The Pahlavi awas&icirc;ni<I>s</I>n&icirc;h*, but in other connections fra<I>g</I>y&acirc;iti<I>s</I> might well mean 'continued life;' 'life long endured with the wicked.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_66"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_66">9:4</A> The Pahlavi has vish&ucirc;pi<I>s</I>n&#335;, which here affords a better meaning; see however Y. XLVIII, 9. We might read as alternative here, 'knowing the calamity to be averted.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_67"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_67">9:5</A> Uncertain. The Pahlavi however indicates 'discernment.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_68"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_68">9:6</A> One is strongly tempted to read a&ecirc;v&ocirc;, 'not a single chief,' but the ancient writing read by the Pahlavi translator had a&ecirc;v&acirc; ah&ucirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_69"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_69">9:7</A> This indicates that Zarathu<I>s</I>tra had been the speaker in the previous verses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_70"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_70">9:8</A> Appointed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_71"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_71">9:9</A> Verbatim. Thereupon spake Ahura Mazda knowing the-wonderful (thing) through-insight (?) not thus a master found, nor a ruler righteous-order-from-even from, therefore for thee to-the-thrifty-and to-the-husbandman-and (I) as-a-creator I-have-made.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_72"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_72">10:1</A> Or a company of the saints conceived to be present.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_73"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_73">10:2</A> So some writers, accepting an irregular reading <I>h</I><I>v</I>arusha&ecirc;iby&ocirc; after the indication of the Pahlavi translation. Otherwise compare 'rush' (?), uru = ru, and render 'to the estranged.' We have often to stretch the meaning more than this. Converting instructions are elsewhere suggested for 'all mankind.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_74"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_74">10:3</A> The translation of Neryosangh is added here not merely because it is of interest, but because it is, together with the Pahlavi translation, of the last importance in forming correct conclusions. It may be rendered as follows; and the reader may regard it as a specimen, but by no means a particularly favourable one. At the words &acirc;z&ucirc;t&ocirc;&icirc;<I>s</I> and mareta&ecirc;iby&ocirc; different texts were before him and the Pahlavi translator as well. Those words are elsewhere rendered by the latter <I>k</I>arp&icirc;h and an<I>s</I>&ucirc;t&acirc;&acirc;n: This greatest magnitude (sic) of the M&atilde;thra, the Lord produced together with righteousness as his fellow-worker [ ]. The Great Wise One discloses the herds to the eaters; and he discloses also the great matter to the well-taught scholars. Who is thine, who endowed with the best mind, gives the two things, with the mouth to those who are prosecuting studies (sic)? To expect an ancient rendering to be closer would be unreasonable. The errors (as to root) are not errors, but the certain signs of differing MSS. This constantly occurs; and it is hardly necessary to add that sometimes from such supposed mistakes we get the only possible means of recovering the original text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_75"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_75">10:4</A> Repeating the announcement in verse 6. The a&ecirc;v&acirc; in 6 would incline one to read a&ecirc;v&acirc; (y<I>e</I> n<I>e</I> a&ecirc;v&acirc;), but the manuscript before the Pahlavi translator read a&ecirc;v&ocirc; = khad&ucirc;k. It is quite out of the question to suppose his a&ecirc;t&ucirc;no and khad&ucirc;k to be accidental. A sharp distinction is made.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_76"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_76">11:1</A> So the Pahlavi translator, giving the only critical etymology in his h&ucirc;dem&ucirc;n&icirc;h, the gloss aside.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_77"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_77">11:2</A> The Pahlavi text corrected by the Persian MS. may be rendered as follows: This gift I obtained [ ]. For this one is he who was listening to that which is our teaching, Zart&ucirc;sht, the Spit&acirc;m&acirc;n. For us, A&ucirc;harmazd, and for Ahar&acirc;y&icirc;h is his desire, [that is, that perfectly performed duty, and good works are desired by him]. He recites also a remedy-making (free or erroneous), [that is, he declares a remedy-making against the Dr&ucirc;<I>g</I> who is in the world]; on account of which saying for his word of piety which he utters, they give him a good abode [ ]. (The glosses are often from a later hand and erroneous. Sometimes, however, they contain the truth while the text is futile. I drop them in the present citations when they are of no importance.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_78"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_78">11:3</A> Observe that Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, like other prophets, met at times little honour from his fellow-countrymen who are here well represented by the voice of the Kine's Soul. (See Y. XLVI, 1.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_79"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_80">11:4</A> Or could not h&ocirc;i be taken in a reflective sense, and referred to the first person like the possessive sve; see the connection.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_80"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_81">11:5</A> Verbatim. Thereupon-and the Kine's Soul wept: (I) who <A NAME="page_12"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 12</FONT></A> (lament) one-not-able-to-effect-his-wish in-wounding as-a-master (or, I established?) [ ], whom as-against I-wish one wish-controlling-and-effecting-as-a-sovereign. When ever he may-(shall)-be who to her (possibly to-me-myself?) shall-give effected-by-the-hand help.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_81"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_82">12:1</A> Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, having accepted his call to be the Ratu or his substitute, at once interposes with a prayer for his suffering charge.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_82"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_83">12:2</A> See verse 1, to which reference is continually made as the chief expression of the sufferings to be remedied.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_83"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_84">12:3</A> The Pahlavi without glosses may be rendered as follows: Give ye assistance to these, O A&ucirc;harmazd, Ashavahi<I>s</I>t and Khshatraver! So also Voh&ucirc;man, who gives him a pleasing habitation, and also joy. I also think that the first gain and obtaining of this is from thee. (With the gloss slightly different; but valman should be rendered according to ahy&acirc;.)</p>  
<p>The text literally is as follows: (Do) ye to these, O Ahura! happiness (? possibly strength; see the Pahlavi) grant, O Asha! Khshathra-and (=the Kingdom) such (kingdom as) by Vohu Manah by-which amenities peaceful-joy-and (one) may give-or-establish; I-even of this, O Mazda! Thee I thought foremost possessor.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_84"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_85">12:4</A> So the Pahlavi translation indicates; compare <I>g</I>im&acirc; and fr&acirc; man (?) math&acirc;; otherwise m&acirc;mash&acirc; = I hasten (to fulfil my mission).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_85"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_86">13:1</A> The Pahlavi has kabed. For the fundamental idea compare p<I>ri</I>ksh + suffix.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_86"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_87">13:2</A> The Amesh&ocirc;spends just mentioned, together with whom Ahura governs and blesses His people. Ahm&acirc; (so conjecturing with Barth.), is also quite sufficiently indicated by the lanman of the Pahlavi. Whether an instrumental <I>e</I>hm&acirc; can be accepted is doubtful. The form should be altered.</p>  
<p>If <I>e</I>hm&acirc; stands, i<I>s</I>tem must be understood, or the instrumental taken in a possessive sense.</p>  
<p>Ahm&acirc; has no authority from MSS., but is better than angh&acirc;m&acirc;, as being nearer the MSS.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_87"></A><A HREF="sbe31006.htm#fr_88">13:3</A> As an impartial specimen I render Ner. thus: Whence will that gift come to me, (the gift which is) A<I>s</I>avahista, Gvahmana, and Saharevara, [that is, sanctity, the highest (best) mind, and the sovereignty, where is the place of the reward which will thus come to me?]. (Here the translation falls into confusion from an error which is most interesting and instructive, because it is corrected by Ner. in an alternative rendering in the gloss. As has been seldom noticed his original was the Pahlavi word p&acirc;<I>d</I>adahi<I>s</I>n&icirc;n&ecirc;<I>d</I>, rather than the G&acirc;thic pait&icirc;-z&acirc;nat&acirc;. This Pahlavi form he could not at first believe to be a second plural. Indeed the Pahlavi glossist may have taken it as a third sg. Neryosangh therefore abortively renders word-for-word as follows: You, O Great Wise One! it offers or presents more excellently through the 'greatest exaltation' (the holy cause). But he recovers himself in the gloss by reading the Pahlavi p&acirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;dahi<I>s</I>n&#335; v&acirc;d&ucirc;ny&ecirc;n as an imperative: [Provide a reward through that spotless exaltation (the irreproachable cause)] continuing: Here, O Lord! is the gift (which is) ours, and (which comes) to us from Thee.)</P>
