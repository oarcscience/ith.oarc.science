<p><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">YASNA XXXII.</h3>  <h4 align="center">THE STRUGGLE IS CONTINUED IN THE MIDST OF REVERSES.</h4>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">1. The same author may well be supposed to continue. The first stanzas have been lost, but we observe that the subject of the section is still face to face with the Da&ecirc;va party. He seems to see them arrayed and engaged in hostile devotions. But he is not intimidated. The friendship of Ahura is before his mind, and he expresses his desire that he and his colleagues may become, or continue, His apostles, notwithstanding the temporal sorrows which, according to XLIII, II, we see that he clearly anticipated as the portion of those who would propagate the holy faith.</p>  
<p>2. Mazda answers him, and through him his followers, as established in His spiritual sovereignty, accepting the devotion of their piety with commendations and implied encouragements. He whom they would serve is supreme; they need not fear.</p>  
<p>3. After reporting this response of Ahura, the composer turns with vehemence toward the Da&ecirc;vas, poetically conceived to be present as if before their adherents, who also, according to verse 1, are supposed to be in sight (or are dramatically so conceived) celebrating their profane devotions; and he addresses them as the 'very seed' of Satan. Their worshippers belong to the religious falsehood and perversity. And they have persistently propagated their evil creed, which is in consequence spreading.</p>  
<p>4. They have, so he acknowledges with grief, perverted men's minds, making them spokesmen for themselves, and in consequence deserters from the great Kindly Disposition of Ahura Mazda, and outcasts, fallen from His understanding.</p>  
<p>5. They have destroyed the hopes of mankind for a happy life upon earth, and for Immortality in heaven. And in this they are not only the seed of the Evil Mind personified, but his servants rallying at his word.</p>  
<p>6. Their leader is striving energetically, so he mournfully bewails, to effect his evil ends; but it is time that he should recall the counteracting measures of Ahura. His holy doctrines are to be announced, and their authority established by the divine Khshathra, His Sovereign Power personified.</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">7. The composer then contemplates with religious irony the infatuated security of the wretched delinquents whom he is apostrophising. Not a man of them knows the destruction which awaits him, and which, as he intimates, is close at hand, but Ahura, he significantly exclaims, is aware of it. And it will be proportionably severe. The blindness of sinners to danger seems as definite a judgment upon them in his estimate as their blindness to the truth.</p>  
<p>8. To point his anger with an instance he names the apostate Yima, whom he supposes to have erred in first introducing the consumption of the flesh of cattle. He disavows community with him as with them all, declaring himself separate from them in Ahura's sight.</p>  
<p>9. He acknowledges that their leader has to a certain degree defeated his teachings, and impaired the just estimates of life which he had striven to form within the people, (or that he will do this if not checked), declaring also that he had made inroads upon his property, which was sacred to the holy cause. And he cries aloud to Ahura and to Asha with the words of his very soul.</p>  
<p>10. He repeats that their leader threatens to invalidate his teachings, blaspheming the supreme object of nature, the Sun, together with the sacred Kine, injuring the productive land, and carrying murder among the saints.</p>  
<p>11. He utters his bitter wail in view of attempted slaughter, and actual spiritual opposition. He points out the plots among the powerful and their illegal confiscation of inheritances, as well those of women as those of men. And he declares that his opponents are endeavouring to injure his adherents, as if repelled by the best spiritual qualities which an individual could possess.</p>  
<p>12. He announces the solemn judgment of God upon it all, especially reprobating those who deal treacherously against the mystical Kine; that is, the holy herds and people, and apostrophising those who prefer the Gr<I>e</I>hma above the saving and sanctifying Asha, and the Kingdom of the Lie-demon above the Divine Khshathra.</p>  
<p>13. He declares that Gr<I>e</I>hma, an opposing chief, desired that evil kingdom in the abode of the personified Hell. And he cannot refrain from adding that he also enviously desires to share in the holy apostleship. But, as he severely rejoins, the messenger of God will hold him afar from the sight of the (Divine) Righteousness. He can have no share in the Faith.</p>  
<p>(Here it may be noticed that we have some data for presenting</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">the main features of the struggle. In several instances, centring perhaps in the actual description of a battle in XLIV, 15, 16, we see traces of the closeness of the controversy. In XLIV, 15, the two hosts seem to be closing in regular lines for the 'holy vows themselves.' Here, on the other hand, we read of willing complaint or 'regretful desire,' while judicial blindness is referred to over and over again under various phrases. One might suppose that the Da&ecirc;va-party were very near the Zarathu<I>s</I>trians in many of their religious peculiarities, but that they could not accede to, or understand, the dualism. After the manner of Pagans they implicated the Gods in their sins. (Compare the drunken Indra.) At all events a bitter and violent war of doctrines was waging with both speech and weapons. I think it looks like the struggle 'of two parties' who each claimed to be the proper representative of some similar form of faith, similar, of course I mean, outwardly.)</p>  
<p>14. Deploring the establishment of the Kavis who approach with stratagems and false teachings to aid the opposing party, the composer declares that they say that the Kine herself is to be injured instead of blessed by the very fire-priest who kindles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the altar-flame.</p>  
<p>15. He supports himself however with the hope of ultimate success, and with the prospect of his reward, when he and his fellow-labourers should be gloriously borne to heaven by Weal and Immortality, the 'eternal two,' who not only, as we see, bear saints to bliss, but also constitute the beatitude of heaven itself.</p>  
<p>16. He confides all at last to Ahura, who is able to control all events, and to solve all doubts, and who will support his servants in bringing the wicked to vengeance by means of verbal instructions and commands.</FONT></p>

He renders freely pavan zak &icirc; varz&acirc;n&acirc;n av&acirc;r&ucirc;n&#335; d&acirc;n&acirc;k&acirc;n&#335;. Supposing the text to stand, and not supplying a formation from var(e)z, we may hold that there existed a var(e)<I>k</I> beside var(e)z, as there undoubtedly was a har(e)<I>k</I> (see harek<I>e</I>) beside har(e)z. This casts light on the Vedic v&aacute;r<I>k</I>as.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_342"></A><A HREF="sbe31010.htm#fr_343">65:2</A> Amati<I>k</I> pa<I>d</I>&icirc;r&ecirc;nd valman darvand&acirc;n a&icirc;yy&acirc;r&icirc;h [ ] amati<I>k</I> av&#335; T&ocirc;ra zani<I>s</I>n&#335; g&ucirc;ft&#335;. The sufferings of the sacred Kine form the central thought of much that occurs.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_343"></A><A HREF="sbe31010.htm#fr_344">65:3</A> Can g&acirc;u<I>s</I> be a genitive here? But if a nominative, must not y<I>e</I> refer to it? How then could the Kine 'kindle' the aid of grace? A genitive looks difficult. It is, however, accepted by Spiegel, although he renders differently from my translation. The Pahlavi may give us invaluable relief here by restoring the text. The ancient translator read vao<I>k</I>aya<I>t</I>. Reading with him, we might render: When the Kine which (y&acirc;?) caused a death-removing help to be declared, was said to be meet for subjection (or slaying, reading an infinitive from <I>g</I>an). This rendering is more probable than that from sao<I>k</I>aya<I>t</I>. The Kine distinctly caused this help to be declared. See XXIX. But I make it a matter of principle to follow the MSS. in a first translation, where that is at all possible.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_344"></A><A HREF="sbe31010.htm#fr_345">65:4</A> The Pahlavi translator differs greatly here, having taken an&acirc;i<I>s</I> with adverbial force, and as possessing the a priv. (they being <A NAME="page_66"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 66</FONT></A> not inclined). He also read somewhat as follows: an&acirc;i<I>s</I> ava&ecirc;n&icirc;(?) as y<I>e</I> = from his non-inclination he was blind who (belongs to the Karpan and to the Kavi). Whether a truer text is indicated by him here is doubtful on account of XLIV, 13, and its n&acirc;sh&acirc;m&acirc;; but the unvarying explanation of the Kavis as blind probably derives its origin from some such reading here, or elsewhere in lost documents.</p>  
<p>Certainly if &acirc;i<I>s</I> can be used as a particle, an&acirc;i<I>s</I> is not altogether impossible in some such sense. Moreover, the Pahlavi translation here and elsewhere has afforded us such a multitude of valuable concretes, that we shall do well to think twice before we reject its most startling suggestions. Lit. trl. 'what (things are) of the K.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_345"></A><A HREF="sbe31010.htm#fr_346">66:1</A> The Pahlavi translation gives a fine suggestion in the concrete sense here; seeing the dual &acirc;by&acirc;, it explains it as referring to Haurvat&acirc;<I>t</I> and Ameretat&acirc;<I>t</I>, which is very probably correct. So Spiegel also renders. It is very difficult to decide in which sense y<I>e</I><I>n</I>g dai<I>n</I>t&icirc; n&ocirc;i<I>t</I> jy&acirc;t<I>e</I>u<I>s</I> khshayaman<I>e</I><I>n</I>g vas&ocirc; is to be taken. If in an evil sense (as vas<I>e</I>-khshaya<I>n</I>t is sometimes elsewhere taken) one might think of such a rendering as this: I have driven the Karpans' and Kavis' disciples hence to those (evil rulers) whom they (my servants) render no longer wanton tyrants over life. But these (my champion saints) shall be borne by the two to the home of Thy Good Mind. But strict grammar demands of us that t&ocirc;i should refer back to y<I>e</I><I>n</I>g. Accordingly I suggest as above first.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_346"></A><A HREF="sbe31010.htm#fr_347">66:2</A> Observe that Vohu Manah equals heaven. Recall XXX, 4, 'but for the holy Vahi<I>s</I>ta Manah; that is heaven.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_350"></A><A HREF="sbe31010.htm#fr_351">66:6</A> If this 'best one' is the Ratu of XXXIII, 1, all is grammatically clear; but the expressions are rather strong in view of <A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A> XLVIII, 9, where similar language is certainly applied to Ahura. If Ahura is here meant, we have only one instance more to add to the many in which Ahura is spoken of in the third person, with an address to Him thrown in. See the differing views of XLV, 11. Possibly the 'Best One' was Ahura's Spe<I>n</I>ta Mainyu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_351"></A><A HREF="sbe31010.htm#fr_352">67:1</A> Zak &icirc; pavan g&ucirc;m&acirc;n&icirc;k&icirc;h. As to &acirc;ithi, &acirc;ithiva<I>n</I>t seems to prove that its meaning must be calamity also in this place. Otherwise one is strongly tempted to heed the vigorous indication of the Pahlavi translator. Here and in XLVIII, 9, he renders 'manifest,' 'what is clear in the midst of my doubt.' The etymology would be far simpler. Alternatively dva&ecirc;th&acirc; = terror (b&icirc;).</P>

<p>(SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE. 'Parch with drought' in verse 10 may be regarded as having figurative application. The destruction of the means of irrigation, so often resorted to in the same regions later, would point also to a literal sense, but 'waste our meadows like drought' is a safer expression.
