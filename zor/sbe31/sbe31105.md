### II. GÂH RAPITHVIN <span id="fr_1566"></span>[1](#fn_1538.md).

1\. Propitiation to Ahura Mazda. A blessing is Asha Vahi*s*ta. I confess
as a Mazda-worshipper, and of Zarathu*s*tra's order—for Rapithwina, the
holy lord of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and
for praise, and for Frâda*t*-fshu and Za*n*tuma, the holy lord(s) of the
ritual order, for sacrifice, homage,

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

propitiation, and for praise. 2. And propitiation be to Asha Vahi*s*ta,
and to Ahura Mazda's Fire, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and
praise <span id="fr_1567"></span>[1](#fn_1539.md). 3, 4. (See Y. LX XI, 2,
3.)

5\. And we sacrifice to the Rapithwina, the holy lord of the ritual
order, and to the Gâtha Ahunavaiti, the holy, and ruling in the ritual
order; and to the Gâtha U*s*tavaiti, and to the Gâtha Spe*n*tâ-mainyu,
and to the Gâtha Vohu-khshathra, and to the Gâtha Vahi*s*tôi*s*ti, holy,
and ruling in the ritual order. 6. And we sacrifice to Frâda*t*-fshu,
and to Za*n*tuma, and to the Fshûshô-mãthra, even to the word correctly
spoken, and we sacrifice to the (many) words correctly spoken, even to
the victorious ones which slay the Demon-gods (the Daêvas <span
id="fr_1568"></span>[2](#fn_1540).md). And we sacrifice to the waters and
the lands, and to the plants, and to the heavenly Yazads who are givers
of the holy and the good. And we sacrifice to the Bountiful Immortals,
(the guardians) of the saints.

7\. And we sacrifice to the good, heroic, bountiful Fravashis of the
saints, and to the heights of Asha (called) Vahi*s*ta, and to the
greatest Mãthras as moving us to action, the greatest as teaching
faithfulness to holy vows, the greatest as referring to actions which
are evidently just, and the greatest for the acquisition of the
Mazdayasnian Faith. 8. And we sacrifice to that assembly and reunion
which the Bountiful Immortals hold when they gather (?) on the heights
of Heaven, for the sacrifice and homage of Za*n*tuma, the lord.

And we (therefore) sacrifice to Za*n*tuma (as) the holy lord of the
ritual order. 9. And we sacrifice

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

to Asha Vahi*s*ta (who is Righteousness the Best), and to the Fire,
Ahura Mazda's son—. 10. Yea, we sacrifice to Thee, the Fire, Ahura
Mazda's son, the holy ritual lord—.

I bless the sacrifice, homage, strength, and swiftness of Asha
Vahi*s*ta, and of the Fire, of Ahura Mazda—. And to this one be the
glory!
