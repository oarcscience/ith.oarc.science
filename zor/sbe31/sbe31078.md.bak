### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1383"></span>[335:1](sbe31078.htm#fr_1394.md) This Visparad
consists of additions to various portions of the Yasna; and its several
chapters generally follow the corresponding portions of the Yasna in the
Vendîdâd Sâdah. The word Visparad means 'all the chiefs,' referring to
the 'lords of the ritual.' Chapter I should be read immediately after
Yasna I, 9.

<span id="fn_1384"></span>[335:2](sbe31078.htm#fr_1395.md) Or, 'I invite.'

<span id="fn_1385"></span>[335:3](sbe31078.htm#fr_1397.md) Lords because
ruling as chief objects of attention during their mention in the course
of the sacrifice, also, as in this case, genii guarding over all of
their class.

<span id="fn_1386"></span>[335:4](sbe31078.htm#fr_1398.md) So De Harlez,
admirably following the Pahl. sardîk (sic).

<span id="fn_1387"></span>[335:5](sbe31078.htm#fr_1399.md) Pavan yazi*s*n
kar*d*arîh.

<span id="fn_1388"></span>[336:1](sbe31078.htm#fr_1400.md) *A*unghairyô, a
collective, or zîzanen, a participle.

<span id="fn_1389"></span>[336:2](sbe31078.htm#fr_1401.md) Here is praise
to a part of the Yasna itself, although not yet recited in the V.S.

<span id="fn_1390"></span>[336:3](sbe31078.htm#fr_1402.md) Its chief word
is yazamaidê, it is 'the well-sacrificed,' the word often occurring.

<span id="fn_1391"></span>[336:4](sbe31078.htm#fr_1403.md) Or, 'to him who
is devoted to the Ahuna, with its Ahû and Ratu (?).'

<span id="fn_1392"></span>[336:5](sbe31078.htm#fr_1404.md) Observe the
priority of the Haptanghâiti; it should be read first.

<span id="fn_1393"></span>[336:6](sbe31078.htm#fr_1405.md) Interpolated.

<span id="fn_1394"></span>[337:1](sbe31078.htm#fr_1406.md) This sense is
most obvious.

<span id="fn_1395"></span>[337:2](sbe31078.htm#fr_1407.md) The
'fiend-smiting' is the common meaning of v*ri*trahâ´; but verethra is
clearly 'victory' in Zend; v*ri*trâ´ also equals defensive valour.

<span id="fn_1396"></span>[337:3](sbe31078.htm#fr_1408.md) Can dahmahê*k*a
mean 'the departed saint' here?

<span id="fn_1397"></span>[337:4](sbe31078.htm#fr_1409.md) A lost part of
the Avesta, two fragments of which only survive.

<span id="fn_1398"></span>[338:1](sbe31078.htm#fr_1410.md) Comp. Y. XXIX,
2. Y. I, 10-23 follows.
