### YASNA XII (SP. XIII).

#### THE MAZDAYASNIAN CONFESSION <span id="fr_1036"></span>[4](#fn_1030.md).

1\. I drive <span id="fr_1037"></span>[5](#fn_1031.md) the Daêvas hence; I
confess as a Mazda-worshipper of the order of Zarathu*s*tra, estranged
from the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

the Lord, a praiser <span id="fr_1038"></span>[1](#fn_1032.md) of the
Bountiful Immortals; and to Ahura Mazda, the good and endowed with good
possessions, I attribute all things good, to the holy One, the
resplendent, to the glorious, whose are all things whatsoever which are
good; whose is the Kine, whose is Asha (the righteous order pervading
all things pure), whose are the stars, in whose lights the glorious
beings and objects are clothed <span id="fr_1039"></span>[2](#fn_1033.md).

2\. And I choose Piety, the bounteous and the good, mine may she
be <span id="fr_1040"></span>[3](#fn_1034.md). And therefore I loudly
(deprecate all robbery <span id="fr_1041"></span>[4](#fn_1035.md) and
violence against the sacred) Kine, and all drought <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[5](#fn_1036.md) to the wasting of the Mazdayasnian
villages.

3\. Away from (?) their thoughts do I wish to lead (the thought of)
wandering at will, (away the thought of) free nomadic pitching of the
tent, for I wish to remove (?) all wandering from <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[6](#fn_1037) (their.md) Kine which abide in
steadfastness upon this land; and bowing down in worship to
Righteousness I dedicate my offerings with praise so far as that. Never
may I stand as a source of wasting, never as a source of withering to
the Mazdayasnian villages, not for the love <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[7](#fn_1038.md) of body or of life.

4\. Away do I abjure the shelter and headship of the

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Daêvas, evil as
they are; aye, utterly bereft of good, and void of virtue, deceitful in
their wickedness, of (all) beings those most like the Demon-of-the-Lie,
the most loathsome of existing things, and the ones the most of all
bereft of good.

5\. Off, off, do I abjure the Daêvas and all possessed by them, the
sorcerers and all that hold to their devices, and every existing being
of the sort; their thoughts do I abjure, their words and actions, and
their seed (that propagate their sin); away do I abjure their shelter
and their headship, and the iniquitous of every kind who act as Rakhshas
act!

Thus and so in very deed might Ahura Mazda have indicated <span
id="fr_1045"></span>[1](#fn_1039.md) to Zarathu*s*tra in every question
which Zarathu*s*tra asked, and in all the consultations in the which
they two conversed together. 6. Thus and so might Zarathu*s*tra have
abjured the shelter and the headship of the Daêvas in all the questions,
and in all the consultations with which they two conversed together,
Zarathu*s*tra and the Lord.

And so I myself, in whatsoever circumstances I may be placed, as a
worshipper of Mazda, and of Zarathu*s*tra's order, would so abjure the
Daêvas and their shelter, as he who <span
id="fr_1046"></span>[2](#fn_1040.md) was the holy Zarathu*s*tra abjured
them (once of old).

7\. To that religious sanctity <span id="fr_1047"></span>[3](#fn_1041.md)
to which the waters appertain, do I belong, to that sanctity to which
the plants, to that sanctity to which the Kine of blessed gift <span
id="fr_1048"></span>[4](#fn_1042.md), to that religious sanctity to which
Ahura Mazda, who made both Kine and holy men, belongs,

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

to that sanctity do I. Of that creed which Zarathu*s*tra held, which
Kavi Vî*s*tâspa, and those two, Frashao*s*tra and *G*âmâspa; yea, of
that religious faith which every Saoshya*n*t who shall (yet come to)
save (us), the holy ones who do the deeds of real significance, of that
creed, and of that lore, am I.

8\. A Mazda-worshipper I am, of Zarathu*s*tra's order; (so) do I
confess, as a praiser and confessor, and I therefore praise aloud the
well-thought thought, the word well spoken, and the deed well done;

9\. Yea, I praise at once the Faith of Mazda, the Faith which has no
faltering utterance <span id="fr_1049"></span>[1](#fn_1043.md), the Faith
that wields the felling halbert <span id="fr_1050"></span>[2](#fn_1044.md),
the Faith of kindred marriage, the holy (Creed), which is the most
imposing, best, and most beautiful of all religions which exist, and of
all that shall in future come to knowledge, Ahura's Faith, the
Zarathu*s*trian creed. Yea, to Ahura Mazda do I ascribe all good, and
such shall be the worship of the Mazdayasnian belief!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1030"></span>[247:4](sbe31034.htm#fr_1036.md) This piece in
the Gâthic dialect has claims to higher antiquity next after the
Haptanghâiti. Its retrospective cast shows that it is later than the
original period. Verse 7 savours of a later date with its reference to
the plants and waters. That Zarathu*s*tra, Kavi Vî*s*tâspa,
Frashao*s*tra, and *G*âmâspa are named by no means proves that they were
still living. Still, they are not mentioned with any fanciful or
superstitious exaggeration; they are not yet demi-gods.

<span id="fn_1031"></span>[247:5](sbe31034.htm#fr_1037.md) As a partial
explanation of nâismî\* from nas, compare the aorist ne*s*at. Possibly
also from nad, 'I curse the demons.'

<span id="fn_1032"></span>[248:1](sbe31034.htm#fr_1038.md) And sacrificer.

<span id="fn_1033"></span>[248:2](sbe31034.htm#fr_1039.md) A genuine
citation from the Gâthas (see Y. XXXI, 7).

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[248:3](sbe31034.htm#fr_1040.md) A genuine
allusion to the Gâthas (Y. XXXII, 2).

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[248:4](sbe31034.htm#fr_1041.md) This preserves
the proper reading of tâyu*sk*a (so the Pahlavi) in Y. XXIX, 1.

<span id="fn_1036"></span>[248:5](sbe31034.htm#fr_1042.md) Viyâpa*t* as
beyond a doubt; so viyâpem in verse 3.

<span id="fn_1037"></span>[248:6](sbe31034.htm#fr_1043.md) Frâ has the same
force as in fra perenaoiti (?), to fill forth, to empty. Otherwise,
'forth to their thoughts I offer in my prayer free ranging at their
choice, and a lodging where they will, together with their cattle which
dwell upon this land.'

<span id="fn_1038"></span>[248:7](sbe31034.htm#fr_1044.md) Comp.
nâiri-*k*inanghô, khratu-*k*inanghô, and shaêtô-*k*inanghô.

<span id="fn_1039"></span>[249:1](sbe31034.htm#fr_1045.md) Reading
adakhshayaêtâ; otherwise khshayaêtâ, commanded.

<span id="fn_1040"></span>[249:2](sbe31034.htm#fr_1046.md) The Pahlavi
structure 'he who' foreshadowed, as often.

<span id="fn_1041"></span>[249:3](sbe31034.htm#fr_1047.md) Not in the sense
of recompense here.

<span id="fn_1042"></span>[249:4](sbe31034.htm#fr_1048.md) Observe this
original meaning; 'butter' is here impossible.

<span id="fn_1043"></span>[250:1](sbe31034.htm#fr_1049.md)
Fraspâvaokhedhrãm; 'y' miswritten for 'v.' Fra seems to be prohibitive
'speech without falling, or hesitation;' better as adj.

<span id="fn_1044"></span>[250:2](sbe31034.htm#fr_1050.md) Comp. Y. XXXI,
18.
