### VISPARAD XI (SP. XII).

1\. To Ahura Mazda would we present <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[4](#fn_1441.md) our offered Haomas and that which is
lifted up, as the most

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

beneficial to Verethraghna (the blow of victory) which furthers the
settlements; and that which is offered to the good and holy king, and
that which is offered to the holy ruler which rules according to, or in
the ritual, and we make known our Haomas to the Bountiful Immortals, and
to the good waters; and we present our Haomas each to (our) own
soul <span id="fr_1456"></span>[1](#fn_1442.md); and we announce our Haomas
in our celebration to the entire creation of the holy (and the clean).

2\. Yea, we present these Haomas and Haoma-implements, and these spread
mats, and these Myazdas, these stones, the first in the creation, the
stone mortar brought here with the yellow <span
id="fr_1457"></span>[2](#fn_1443.md) Haoma in it, and the iron mortar
brought here with the yellow Haoma in it, this Haoma-water, and this
Baresman spread with sanctity, (3) these bodies, and (their) forces,
these striving Zaothras (that seek to find Thy grace), this holy Haoma,
and the flesh, and the holy man, and the saint's innate thoughts, even
the Saoshya*n*ts’ innate thoughts.

And we present this fresh milk as an offering, now lifted up with
sanctity, and this Hadhânaêpata plant, lifted up with sanctity; (4) and
we offer, and present these Zaothras with our celebration, having the
Haoma with them, and the milk, and the Hadhânaêpata, to the good waters
and offered up with piety. And we present the Haoma-water in our
celebrations to the good waters, and both the stone and the iron mortar,
(5) and this branch for the Baresman, and the prayer for blessings
uttered at the fitting moment which has approached (for our help in its
order with the prayers), and the recollection

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

and practice of the good Mazdayasnian law, and the heard recital of the
Gâthas, the well-timed prayer for blessings as it comes uttered by the
saint (and for our help), and ruling (while it is spoken) as a ritual
lord, and these wood-billets, and the perfume even Thine, the Fire's, O
Ahura Mazda's son! and all good objects (which are ours), and
Mazda-made, and which have the seed of sanctity (or are that seed).

6\. Yea, these we make known and we announce in this our celebration to
Ahura Mazda (as our gift), and to Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, and
to Ashi (who is the recompense),and to Rashnu the most just, and to
Mithra of the wide pastures, and to the Bountiful Immortals, and the
Fravashis of the saints, and to their souls, and to the Fire of Ahura
Mazda, the lord, and to the lofty lord (the Apãm-napâ*t*?), and to the
Myazda, the lord, and to the well-timed prayer for blessings as it rules
in the order of our prayers, for the sacrifice, homage, propitiation,
and adoration of the entire creation of the holy (and the clean). 7.
Yea, these we make known in this our celebration hereby for the Fravashi
of Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma, the saint, for its sacrifice, homage,
propitiation, and praise, and to the (Fravashi) of Anghuyu (?) <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[1](#fn_1444.md) who hath loved righteousness, together
with all the holy Fravashis of the saints, of those now dead, and of
those of the living, and of those of men unborn, of the prophets that
shall serve us, bringing on the renovation of the completed world. 8-11,
see verses 2-5.

12\. Yea, we would make these known hereby in our celebrations to the
Bountiful Immortals, who rule

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

aright, and who dispose (of all) aright, the ever-living, ever-helpful,
who are good (?), and bestowers of the good, who dwell with the Good
Mind \[(Pâzand) for they who are the Bountiful Immortals abide with the
Good Mind, they who rule aright, and dispose (of all) aright, for thence
they are regulated, and thence they arose, (namely,) from the Good
Mind <span id="fr_1459"></span>[1](#fn_1445.md)\]. 13. And we make known
these our celebrations as the more promotive for this <span
id="fr_1460"></span>[2](#fn_1446.md) house, for the furtherance of this
house, and as benefits for this house, because of the increase of this
household, as overcoming the restrictions which impede this household,
and as overcoming the harmful malice which may mar this house, to bless
its herds, and its retainers, born, and yet to be born, for the saints
of the house as it was aforetime, of it as it <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[3](#fn_1447.md) stands here now, and to which we
likewise now belong as the Saoshya*n*ts of the provinces, (14) \[which
(is that we are Saoshya*n*ts) for the saints who do good deeds, and of
the female saints who do good deeds, and of the saints who do the deeds
conspicuously good, and of the females likewise thus, of the saints who
do good deeds upon good deeds, and of the females thus the same\] 15.
And we make these known in our celebrations to the good Fravashis of the
saints which are formidable and overwhelming in their aid. 16. And we
make these known in our celebrations hereby to Sraosha (Obedience) the
blessed, and to the good

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Blessedness, and
to Nairya-sangha, and to the victorious Peace, and to Ahura Mazda's
Fire, and to the lofty lord, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and
for praise, to the entire creation of the holy and the clean. 17, 18 =
Visp. X, 1, 2.

19\. (Sp. XIII.) Yea, we make that known which is lifted up in offering,
and which is the Avesta <span id="fr_1462"></span>[1](#fn_1448.md) as the
holy Ahura Mazda directed that it should be said, and as Zarathu*s*tra,
the holy, directed, and as I, the priest, who am acquainted with their
sacrifice and homage, am now letting it be known. I who understand the
lawful and legitimate Avesta <span id="fr_1463"></span>[2](#fn_1449.md),
and the ritual prescripts (20) for Your sacrifice, homage, and
propitiation, O Ye who are the Bountiful Immortals, and for our
preparation (?), and for the success of our well-uttered prayer for
blessings, for victory, sanctification, and the well-being of our souls,
(of ours), for (we are) the holy Saoshya*n*ts.

21\. Yea, we make these known in our celebrations here, and we offer
them to Him who is Ahura Mazda, of all the greatest, the master and the
Lord.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1441"></span>[349:4](sbe31088.htm#fr_1455.md) The wording is
purposely varied în the renderings to avoid sameness.

<span id="fn_1442"></span>[350:1](sbe31088.htm#fr_1456.md) To the soul of
the person who may be reciting.

<span id="fn_1443"></span>[350:2](sbe31088.htm#fr_1457.md) Zâiri with K4.

<span id="fn_1444"></span>[351:1](sbe31088.htm#fr_1458.md) Here,
erroneously, a proper name as in Ya*s*t XIII. Possibly of that
Zarathu*s*trian world (period) which loved righteousness; the word
occurs after the name of Z. I think that 'y' should be 'v.'

<span id="fn_1445"></span>[352:1](sbe31088.htm#fr_1459.md) Vohu Manah
certainly appears the most prominent here. They arose from the 'good
thought' of Ahura.

<span id="fn_1446"></span>[352:2](sbe31088.htm#fr_1460.md) This office was
celebrated in private houses by itinerant priests.

<span id="fn_1447"></span>[352:3](sbe31088.htm#fr_1461.md) YêNhê aêm might
be a citation from some lost prayer. The singular aêm may, however, be
taken collectively, as families are spoken of.

<span id="fn_1448"></span>[353:1](sbe31088.htm#fr_1462.md) Âvista probably
= Avesta; compare Veda. The moral and ceremonial laws.

<span id="fn_1449"></span>[353:2](sbe31088.htm#fr_1463.md) Avestic.
