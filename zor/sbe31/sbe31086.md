### VISPARAD IX (SP. X) <span id="fr_1446"></span>[3](#fn_1433).

1\. (I desire to offer my homage and my praise <span
id="fr_1447"></span>[4](#fn_1434)) to the offered Haomas and Zaothras,
and to those also which shall yet be offered, which smite victoriously,
and are foes of hatred, and following in company (as they do) with the
healing virtues of sanctity, following also in company with those of
*K*isti (religious knowledge), and with the remedies of Mazda, and with
those of Zarathu*s*tra and the Zarathu*s*trôtema, (2) and to the offered
Haomas and Zaothras which accompany those remedies which belong to the
holy disciple well versed in good devices <span
id="fr_1448"></span>[5](#fn_1435), and accompanying those of the
itinerant also versed in good devices <span
id="fr_1449"></span>[5](#fn_1435), and accompanying those likewise of
the good Mazdayasnian Faith, and those of the pious and beneficent
Prayer for blessings, and of the pious and good veracity, and

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

of the pious word against unbelief, (3) for information and explanation,
for preparation (?) and devotion, for the libation and complete
offering, for the complete recital of the liturgy memorised as well; and
to those Haomas which are pungent, bounteous, holy, and offered with
sanctity (and for a blessing), to those which are yet to be offered with
sanctity, and which are now being celebrated, and which are likewise in
the future to be celebrated, to those which are being pressed with
sanctity, and to those which are yet to be pressed, (to these I desire
to approach, and to express my homage and my praise). 4. And I desire to
express my homage and my praise to the strength of the strong, and to
the victorious blow of the mighty, to the powerful Rectitude and
Blessedness, to *K*isti and the Priority for the powerful Ascendency,
and to these powerful Yazads which are the Bountiful Immortals, who rule
aright, and dispose of all aright, ever-living, ever-helpful, who, male
and female, dwell together with the Good Mind, (to these I desire in my
homage and my praises to approach); (5) (yea, I desire to approach for
homage and praises toward) our Universal Weal and Immortality, to the
body of the Kine, and to the Kine's Soul. (And I desire to approach) the
Fire of the spoken name <span id="fr_1450"></span>[1](#fn_1436), and
toward that farm-house which is sanctified and which has fields and
comfort <span id="fr_1451"></span>[2](#fn_1437), and mercy (for the
poor); (6) as a praiser with praise for the sacrifice, homage, which is
this praise of Ahura Mazda, of the Bountiful Immortals, and of the holy
and lofty Lord, for the sacrifice, and homage of the Lord that most
attains his ends, and which is this praise of that blessedness

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

which has approached us, and of that well-timed prayer for blessings
offered in the ritual, (7) which is likewise the praise of the Mãthra
Spe*n*ta (the bounteous word of reason), and of the Mazdayasnian
Religion, and the Praises of the Yasnas <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[1](#fn_1438), which is also that of all the lords
of the ritual, and of all the well-timed prayers for blessings, for the
sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and glorification of the entire
creation of the holy (and the clean).
