### VISPARAD XIII (SP. XV) <span id="fr_1473"></span>[2](#fn_1459).

1\. According to the ritual we worship Ahura Mazda; according to the
ritual we worship the Bountiful Immortals; and we sacrifice to the
sacrificial word correctly spoken, and to every Mãthra (as to a sacred
word of reason). And we sacrifice to Zarathu*s*tra, him who is
especially the possessor of the Mãthra <span
id="fr_1474"></span>[3](#fn_1460); and we sacrifice to the 'blessings
for the saints' <span id="fr_1475"></span>[4](#fn_1461); and we worship
the 'hail' <span id="fr_1476"></span>[5](#fn_1462) addressed to the
Bountiful Immortals.

2\. Also we worship the three principal (chapters) uttered (in the
Yasna) without addition or omission <span
id="fr_1477"></span>[6](#fn_1463);

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

and we worship the three principal ones without addition or omission; we
worship the three commencing ones entire without addition or
omission <span id="fr_1478"></span>[1](#fn_1464). And we worship the
entirety <span id="fr_1479"></span>[2](#fn_1465) of the three principal
ones without addition or omission; and their Hâs, their metrical lines,
their words, and their word-structure \[and their recital, memorising,
chanting, and their steadfast offering\].

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1459"></span>[355:2](sbe31090.htm#fr_1473) This fragment
follows Y. XXX in the Vendîdâd Sâdah, and was written in allusion to Y.
XXVIII, Y. XXIX, and Y. XXX.

<span id="fn_1460"></span>[355:3](sbe31090.htm#fr_1474) Referring to
mãthra srevaêmâ in Yasna XXVIII, 8.

<span id="fn_1461"></span>[355:4](sbe31090.htm#fr_1475) Referring to the
words sava*k*â ashavabyô in Yasna XXX, 11.

<span id="fn_1462"></span>[355:5](sbe31090.htm#fr_1476) Referring to the
word u*s*tâ in Yasna XXX, 11.

<span id="fn_1463"></span>[355:6](sbe31090.htm#fr_1477) The three first
chapters XXVIII-XXX; the text has bad grammar, or broken connection.

<span id="fn_1464"></span>[356:1](sbe31090.htm#fr_1478) It is difficult
to see how anapishûtâ can mean 'without retrenchment,' but the context
seems to require it, and the Pahlavi translation bears evidence to it.
Perhaps read anapashûtâ.

<span id="fn_1465"></span>[356:2](sbe31090.htm#fr_1479) 'The whole three
first.' Some suppose the three prayers to be intended (the Ahuna-vairya,
the Ashem Vohû, and the YêNhê hâtãm). I think that the three chapters
XXVIII-XXX are meant. As the piece follows those three chapters in the
Vendîdâd Sâdah, so its expressions indicate a reference to them. This
might tend to show that the Ahunavaiti was at one time, if not
originally, divided at this place.
