*The Zend Avesta, Part III (SBE31)*, L.H. Mills, tr. \[1886\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### III.

1\. All good thoughts, and all good words, and all good deeds are
thought, and spoken, and done with intelligence and all evil thoughts,
and words, and deeds are thought, and spoken, and done with folly. 2.
And let (the men who think, and speak, and do) all good thoughts, and
words, and deeds inhabit <span id="fr_1594"></span>[1](#fn_1565.md) Heaven
(as their home). And let those who think, and speak, and do evil
thoughts, and words, and deeds abide in Hell. For to all who think good
thoughts, speak good words, and do good deeds, Heaven, the best world,
belongs. And this is evident, and as of course (?) (or, 'and therewith
their seed').
