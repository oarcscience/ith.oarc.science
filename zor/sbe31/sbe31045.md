### YASNA XXIII.

#### THE FRAVASHIS OF THE SAINTS; PRAYERS FOR THEIR APPROACH <span id="fr_1160"></span>[3](#fn_1151).

1\. I desire to approach with my praise <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[4](#fn_1152) those Fravashis which have existed
from of old, the Fravashis of the houses, and of the villages, of the
communities, and of the provinces, which hold the

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

heaven in its place apart, and the water, land, and cattle, which hold
the children in the wombs safely enclosed apart so that they do not
miscarry. 2. And I desire to approach toward the Fravashi <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[1](#fn_1153) of Ahura Mazda, and with my praise,
and for those of the Bountiful Immortals, with all the holy Fravashis
which are those of the heavenly Yazads. And I desire to approach the
Fravashi of Gaya Maretan (the life-man) in my worship with my praise,
and for that of Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma, and for those of Kavi Vî*s*tâspa,
and of Isa*t*-vâstra <span id="fr_1163"></span>[2](#fn_1154), the
Zarathu*s*trian, with all the holy Fravashis of the other ancient
counsellors as well. 3. And I desire in my worship to approach toward
every holy Fravashi whosesoever it may be, and wheresoever dead upon
this earth (its possessor may have lain), the pious woman, or the girl
of tender years, the maiden diligent (among the cattle) in the field
(who) may have dwelt (here; yea, all) which are now worshipped from this
house <span id="fr_1164"></span>[3](#fn_1155), which are attentive to,
and which attain to (our) good Yasnas and (our) homage. 4. Yea, I desire
to approach the Fravashis of the saints with my praise, redoubted (as
they are) and overwhelming, the Fravashis of those who held to the
ancient lore, and the Fravashis of the next-of-kin; and I desire to
approach toward the Fravashi of mine own <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[4](#fn_1156) soul in my worship with my praise; and
I desire therewith to approach toward all the lords of the ritual, and
with

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

praise; and I desire to approach all the good Yazads with my praise, the
heavenly and the earthly, who are meet for sacrifice and homage, because
of Righteousness the Best!
