[1886], at Intangible Textual Heritage</FONT></P><HR></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">THE G&Acirc;THA(&Acirc;) VAHI<I>S</I>T&Acirc; &Icirc;<I>S</I>TI<I>S</I> (VAHI<I>S</I>T&Ocirc;I<I>S</I>TI(&Icirc;)).</h3>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This G&acirc;tha, named from its first words, consists of chapter LIII of the Yasna. While its matter is homogeneous with that of the other G&acirc;thas, it bears some evidence of having been composed in the latter portion of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra's life. It is, as usual, separated from the other G&acirc;thas by its metre, which shows four lines with two half lines. The first two have eleven or twelve syllables; the third seems to have fourteen plus a half line with five, so also the last. Irregularities seem frequent. The composition has for its substance a marriage song, but one of a politically religious character.</p>  
<p>The piece &acirc;-airy<I>e</I>m&acirc;-ishy&ocirc;, Y. LIV, 1, has been considered by some is susceptible of a similar metrical arrangement, and it certainly looks as if it originally belonged to Y. LIII. It is, however,</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_188"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 188</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">otherwise divided by Bartholomae (see Arische Forschungen, 2<sup>ter</sup> heft, s. 23). From the past form of sr&acirc;v&icirc;, some have thought that Zarathu<I>s</I>tra was no longer living when this hymn was composed, but the word may only mean '(his prayer) has been, or is heard.' If we must, however, render 'was heard,' this does not determine the certainty of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra's death. The expression Zarathu<I>s</I>tri<I>s</I> Spit&acirc;m&ocirc; also gives the impression that some heir to Zarathu<I>s</I>tra's office and prestige existed, but even this is not decisive, for a future successor may be for a time a contemporary, while, on the contrary, the nuptials of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra's daughter, with the mention of his name, and the reference to her 'father' as the one from whom her bridegroom obtained her, indicate that Zarathu<I>s</I>tra may well have been still living. The later forms Zarathu<I>s</I>trah&ecirc; and fedhr&ocirc; remain as the indications of a later origin than the actual period of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra's lifetime; but these circumstances may he owing to accidental causes.</p>  
<p>The style has freshness and vigour throughout, and would indicate Zarathu<I>s</I>trian influence, if not authorship. That Zarathu<I>s</I>tra does not speak in the first person, has no importance whatever in the question. The piece is not of course a whole; but it may well be a whole out of which parts have fallen. That the subject passes on to the old polemical vehemence in the last verses, is far from unnatural. The marriage festival of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra's child must have been, if without intention, a semi-political occasion, and the bard would express himself, as naturally, with regard to the struggle which was still going on. This latter fact also shows an early date; the passages referring to the struggle are strongly kindred with some in Y. XLVI, and elsewhere.</p>  
<p>Verses 1 and 2 form an admirable introduction; the transition to the marriage occasion was, however, contained in lost verses. Verses 3, 4, and 5 hang well together; and 6 and 7 are not at all remote from them; the warlike close, although far from surprising us, must have been introduced by one or more now missing stanzas.</p>  
<p>1. As the object of the 'great cause,' next to the preservation of its adherents, was the extension of its influence, first over hesitating parties (Y. XLIV, 12), and then over all the living (Y. XXXI, 3), it is not surprising that the central prayer of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra should have culminated in a desire for the conversion of opponents. Even Turanians had been known to come over to the holy creed, and help prosper the settlements which their kith had so often plundered (Y. XLVI, 12); he had therefore prayed that those who</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_189"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 189</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">had heretofore injured the holy Da&ecirc;na might become its disciples by a genuine conversion. 2. Having observed the fidelity of converts and original disciples, the king and his chief nobles would celebrate their devotion by hymns, ceremonies, and sacrifices, as the symbols of every moral virtue, laying down for the people the moral law of the Saviour. 3. As it would be pushing rather far to suppose the Saoshya<I>n</I>t to be referred to in t<I>e</I>m<I>k</I>&acirc;, and as moreover, according to Geldner's admirable suggestion, that title may here well refer to Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, it is better to accept a loss of verses, and to suppose a person alluded to as the bridegroom, who, if not one so eminent as to merit the imposing name of Saoshya<I>n</I>t, was still at least one of his more prominent satellites, for the ancient poet goes on to address a daughter of Zarathu<I>s</I>tra as a bride. She is the youngest, and her name is as pious as that of a maid of ancient Israel, for she is called 'full of the religious knowledge.' Her husband is to be a support in holiness, and she is to take counsel with piety 4. Her response is appropriate; she will vie with her husband in every sacred affection, as well as in every domestic virtue. 5. The priestly thaliarch then addresses the bridesmaids and the pair with suitable admonitions to piety and affection. 6. Turning now to the assembly, possibly after the recital of some stanzas long since vanished, he proceeds with warnings and encouragements. He will exorcise the Demon who was especially the slave of the Da&ecirc;vas; but he warns all men and women against the evil Vayu, the spirit of the air. 7. Charitably concluding that they would come forth as conquerors from the trials which still awaited them, he next warns them against all solicitations to vice. 8. Having named profane Demons, his polemical zeal becomes fully inflamed. Anticipating with fierce delight the sufferings of the wicked, he calls vehemently for the champion, who may, in alliance with neighbouring potentates, deliver up the murderous false-leader, giving peace to the masses; and he entreats that all haste may be used. 9. To arouse the great chiefs to their duty, he recalls (as in Y. XXXII) the successes of the foe; and he calls for the prince who may overthrow and expel him, but, as if well aware that the human arm could not alone bring salvation, he attributes to Ahura the Sovereign Power, which alone can guard helpless innocence against lawless plunder and oppression.</FONT></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_862"></A><A HREF="sbe31022.htm#fr_864">193:3</A> The difficulty here lies in the first line which seems to declare a reward in a good sense. M&icirc;<I>z</I>dem is hardly used of retribution. It must therefore be taken in a good sense. The following evil results must be supposed to have been avoided; and 'Vayu' to be uttered in triumph. Vayu is used in an evil sense in verse 6.</p>  
<p>If m&icirc;<I>z</I>dem could be supposed to express retribution, then evil men and women would be threatened, and Vayu would be a cry uttered in woe. As to Vayu with his two natures, see part ii as per index.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_864"></A><A HREF="sbe31022.htm#fr_866">193:5</A> The Pahlavi translator seems to me too free in rendering za<I>h</I><I>v</I>y&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc; (zahy&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;), zani<I>s</I>n-h&ocirc;mand. It also makes a curious imitation of letters in <I>g</I>&ecirc;h va mar for <I>g</I>enar&atilde;m. It is of course far from certain that he had our present text.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_870"></A><A HREF="sbe31022.htm#fr_872">194:3</A> For narp&icirc;<I>s</I> I can only suggest the suspiciously simple nar = hero (comp. the frequent n&acirc;) and p&icirc; = nourish, support. The Pahlavi translator seems likewise to have had some such rendering in mind, for he translates dast&ocirc;bar.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_871"></A><A HREF="sbe31022.htm#fr_873">194:4</A> As to ri<I>g</I>&icirc;<I>s</I>, the Pahlavi translation, which is here more than usually difficult, hints in the direction above followed, by a word which I would restore as r&ecirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;n&ecirc;nd.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_872"></A><A HREF="sbe31022.htm#fr_874">194:5</A> The Pahlavi translator erroneously sees 'bridge' in pesh&ocirc;, or is free with his tan&acirc;p&ucirc;hark&acirc;n&#335; h&ocirc;mand. See Geldner, Stud. 3.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_876"></A><A HREF="sbe31022.htm#fr_878">194:9</A> Here I have endeavoured to imitate the swing of the rhythm by breaking up the sentences, especially in the second line. Literally it would be, 'with the desire, with the virtue-conquering (desire) of the reprobate.' Such freedom as the above is often a critical necessity in the attempts to reproduce the warmth of the original.</P>
