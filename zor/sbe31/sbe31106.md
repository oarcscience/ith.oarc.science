### III. GÂH UZIREN <span id="fr_1569"></span>[1](#fn_1541).

1\. Propitiation to Ahura Mazda! A blessing is Asha Vahi*s*ta—. I
confess myself a Mazdayasnian of the order of Zarathu*s*tra, a foe to
the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for the Uzayêirina, the
holy lord of the ritual order, for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and
praise, and for Frâda*t*-vîra and Da*hv*yuma, the holy lord(s) of the
ritual order, for their sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise. 2.
And to that lofty Ahura, Apãm-napâ*t*, and to the waters which Mazda
created be sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise <span
id="fr_1570"></span>[2](#fn_1542)! 3, 4. (G. I, 3, 4.) 5. We sacrifice
to the Uzayêirina, the holy lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice
to the Zaotar, the holy lord of the ritual order, and to the Hâvanan,
and to the Âtarevakhsha, and to the Frabaretar, and to the Âbere*t*, and
to the Âsnatar, and the Raêthwi*s*kar, and to the Sraoshâvareza, holy
lords of the ritual order. 6. And we sacrifice to Frâda*t*-vîra and
Da*hv*yuma, the holy lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice to the
stars, the moon, and the sun, and to the constellations (?), and we
sacrifice to the stars without beginning (to their course?), and to the
glory of the doctrinal proclamations

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

which are the evil man's distress <span
id="fr_1571"></span>[1](#fn_1543). 7. And we sacrifice to the manifest
performer of the truth (the correct maintainer of the rites), the holy
lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice to the later lore; yea, we
sacrifice to the manifest fulfiller of the truth, and to the (entire)
creation of the holy (and the clean) by day and by night with Zaothras
together with offered prayers, for the sacrifice and homage of
Da*hv*yuma, the lord. And we sacrifice to Da*hv*yuma, the holy lord of
the ritual order. 8. And we sacrifice to that lofty and royal lord, the
brilliant Apãm-napâ*t* of the fleet horses; and we sacrifice to the
water which is Mazda-made and holy. 9, 10. And we sacrifice to thee, the
Fire, Ahura Mazda's son <span id="fr_1572"></span>[2](#fn_1544).
11 <span id="fr_1573"></span>[3](#fn_1545). And I bless the sacrifice,
homage, strength, and swiftness of that lofty Ahura Napâ*t*-apãm, and of
the water which Mazda created <span id="fr_1574"></span>[4](#fn_1546).
