### YASNA XLI.

#### A PRAYER TO AHURA AS THE KING, THE LIFE, AND THE REWARDER.

1\. Praises, and songs, and adorations do we offer to Ahura Mazda, and
to Righteousness the Best; yea, we offer and we ascribe them, and
proclaim them. 2. And to Thy good Kingdom, O Ahura Mazda!

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

may we attain for ever, and a good King be Thou over us; and let each
man of us, and so each woman, thus abide, O Thou most beneficent of
beings, and for both the worlds! 3. Thus do we render Thee, the helpful
Yazad, endowed with good devices, the friend of them (who worship Thee)
with (well-adjusted) ritual; so may’st Thou be to us our life, and our
body's vigour, O Thou most beneficent of beings, and that for both the
worlds!

4\. Aye, let us win and conquer (?) long life, O Ahura Mazda! in Thy
grace, and through Thy will may we be powerful. May’st Thou lay hold on
us to help, and long, and with salvation, O Thou most beneficent of
beings!

5\. Thy praisers and Mãthra-speakers may we be called <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[1](#fn_1208), O Ahura Mazda! so do we wish, and to
this may we attain <span id="fr_1219"></span>[2](#fn_1209). What reward
most meet for our deserving Thou hast appointed for the souls, O Ahura
Mazda! (6) of that do Thou bestow on us for this life, and for that of
mind <span id="fr_1220"></span>[3](#fn_1210). Of that reward (do Thou
Thyself grant this advantage), that we may come under Thy protecting
guardianship, and that of Righteousness for ever. We sacrifice to that
brave Yasna, the Yasna Haptanghâiti <span
id="fr_1221"></span>[4](#fn_1211), the holy, the ritual chief!
