#### YASNA XXXIX.

#### TO THE SOUL OF THE KINE, &c.

1\. And now we sacrifice to the Kine's soul, and to her created body,
and we sacrifice to the souls

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

of cattle who are fit to live <span id="fr_1208"></span>[1](#fn_1198.md)
(for us), and whose (we?) are, such as are the same to them.

2\. And we worship the souls of those beasts which are tame and broken
in, and of wild herds, and the souls of the saints wherever they were
born, both of men and of women, whose good consciences are conquering in
the strife against the Daêvas, or will conquer, or have conquered.

3\. And now we worship the Bountiful Immortals (all) the good, and both
those male <span id="fr_1209"></span>[2](#fn_1199.md), and those
female <span id="fr_1210"></span>[3](#fn_1200) (by their names.md). The
males among them do we worship, ever living, and ever helpful, who dwell
beside the pious, and the females thus the same. 4. As Thou, O Ahura
Mazda! hast thought and spoken, as thou hast determined, and hast done
these things (effecting) what is good, therefore do we offer to Thee,
therefore do we ascribe to Thee our praises, and worship Thee, and bow
ourselves before Thee; and therefore would we direct our prayers to
Thee, Ahura! with confessions of our sin.

5\. And we thus draw near to Thee together with the good kinship of our
kindred, with that of Righteousness the blessed, and the good law of
thrift and energy and the good Piety, the ready mind (within Thy folk)!
