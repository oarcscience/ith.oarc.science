# THE GÂTHAS.

### YASNA XXIX.

#### THE WAIL OF THE KINE. THE CALL OF ZARATHU*S*TRA. HIS PRAYER FOR AID.

This chapter, the second in the manuscripts of the Gâtha Ahunavaiti, is
placed here as in a more natural order. It may be regarded as containing
the terminus a quo of the divine revelation. The Soul of the Kine, as
representing the herds of the holy Iranian people, their only means of
honourable livelihood, raises its voice, and expressing the profoundest
needs of an afflicted people, addresses Ahura and His Divine Order,
Asha, in bitterness.

1\. Recalling another and a later 'groan of the creation,' she demands
wherefore and for whom she was made, since afflictions encompass her;
and as her comfort, if not her existence, was threatened as much by the
unsettled habits induced by constant alarms as by the actual incursions
of her predatory neighbours, she beseeches the Bountiful Immortals to
instruct her as to the benefits of civilised agriculture, and confirm
her protectors in its practice, as her only remedy against the evils of
which she complains.

2\. Ahura answers by a question to Asha, the personified Righteous
Order, as to what guardian he had appointed in order to smite back the
fury which assails her, intimating that some chief ought to have been
set over her originally who would have averted her miseries, training
her people in steady tillage and bucolic skill, and repelling the
destructive raids.

3\. Asha answers that her sufferings were inevitable, that no chief
could be appointed who could prevent them since none was himself without
his share of injustice and of passionate resentment. He could not answer
why this was the case. The question, involving the insolvable problem of
the origin of evil, lay at the foundation of those influences which move
the stars of destiny; that the religious revelation afforded by the Ratu
(as in

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

chapter XXX) was intended to meet these problems so far as they could be
answered <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md), and that therefore all who
were entering upon active enterprises were in the act of approaching,
not him Asha, the subordinate archangel, but Mazda himself, who was the
greatest of beings, and alone able to answer their prayers and
questions.

4\. Zarathu*s*tra <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md), poetically
conceived to be present, here intervenes to reaffirm the homage just
paid by Asha. He declares Ahura Mazda to be himself the most mindful of
all the previously revealed assertions and directions uttered by
himself, and fulfilled in the actions of both the Demon-gods of their
enemies, and of good or evil men. He is also said to be fully cognisant
of what they will do in the future, and to discriminate between what is
good and evil as an infallible judge, allotting to us all our destiny in
future sufferings or rewards. 5. Addressing Ahura and Asha, and uniting
with the Kine's Soul in her supplication, he questions Mazda in his
doubt, not in peaceful confidence, as later in the impressive hymn, each
verse of which begins with the words, 'This ask I Thee, aright, Ahura!
tell me!' but deprecating from himself, and constructively from the
Kine, the impending destruction which he sees will justly fall upon the
wicked as visited by the discriminating vengeance acknowledged to be
Ahura's attribute (see verse 4). 6. At last Ahura, showing the intention
of His questions, answers them himself; no regulating lord in full
sympathy with the Righteous Order had as yet been discovered or
discoverable, but He himself will make a selection. He therefore
declares himself as solemnly appointing Zarathustra to that office.

And Zarathu*s*tra, inspired by His Good Mind, and guided by His
righteousness, will accomplish more than has as yet been done to rally
the thrifty community, and settle their virtuous polity upon its desired
basis of training and defence. 7. As Zarathustra is a listener in the
colloquy between the Deity, the Kine's Soul, and Asha, the Righteous
Order, so the other Immortals beside Asha <span
id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md), here join in, as if the appointment just
made had not been heard, or was incredible (see below). Mazda is indeed
declared to have revealed the sacred Word-of-reason in harmony with the
consenting Righteousness, and to have provided food for the Kine and

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

the needy consumers, but who was there adequately endowed with the Good
Mind, who could promulgate that Mãthra with its revealed directions as
to sustenance of both body and mind?

8\. Ahura repeats his announcement of Zarathu*s*tra, as if to silence
the objections.

As Zarathu*s*tra alone had heard the doctrines from the voice of
inspiration, so he desired to declare them, and had authority to do so,
together with a settled position of such a character as to make his
statements felt.

9\. But an unexpected difficulty arises. The Kine's Soul is by no means
impressed by the personality of the individual selected as her guardian.
So far from being the demi-god of the other parts of the Avesta,
Zarathu*s*tra's declarations are characterised by her as 'the voice of a
pusillanimous man,' while she, on the contrary, expected one truly
kingly in his rank and characteristics, and able to bring his desires to
effect, while the Bountiful Immortals (or the attending chieftains), as
if they had meant their question in verse 7 to be a question uttered in
mere perplexity or contempt, join in with chorus, asking when indeed an
effective helper will be provided.

10\. Zarathustra, undismayed by the coldness of his reception, enters at
once upon his office as priest and prophet, praying Ahura for the
people; and recognising the names of the 'Immortals,' Khshathra, Asha,
and Vohu Manah, in their original sense, asks Ahura to grant to the
people in their straits, a Sovereign Authority established in the Divine
Order, and bestowing the needed quiet and happiness for which the
suffering provinces, as represented by the Kine's Soul in her wail, had
expressed their desire.

And as he prays, he avows his own steadfast confidence in Ahura rather
than in the Daêvas, as the prime possessor and bestower of blessings.

11\. Then, as if eager to receive full equipment upon the spot, he not
only beseeches for the Righteous Order, the Kingly Power of God, and His
Good Mind for the masses as represented by the Kine, but asks when they
are coming to him, and hastening; and he entreats Ahura to bestow His
help at once for the great cause, and to a very abundant degree, upon
himself and his associates. (It is singular that the name of Âramaiti
does not occur in this section.)

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Translation.

(Homage to you, O Sacred Gâthas!)

1\. Unto you (O Ahura and Asha!) the Soul of the Kine (our sacred herds
and folk) cried aloud: For whom did ye create me, and by <span
id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) whom did ye fashion me? On me comes the
assault of wrath, and of violent power, the blow <span
id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40.md) of desolation, audacious insolence, and
(thievish) <span id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41.md) might. None other
pasture-giver <span id="fr_42"></span>[4](#fn_42.md) have I than you,
therefore do ye teach me good (tillage) for the fields (my only hope of
welfare <span id="fr_43"></span>[5](#fn_43).md)!

Ahura speaks.

2\. Upon this the Creator <span id="fr_44"></span>[6](#fn_44.md) of the
Kine (the holy

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

herds) asked of Righteousness <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md): How
(was) thy guardian for the Kine (appointed) by thee when, as having
power (over all her fate), ye made her? (In what manner did ye secure)
for her, together with pasture, a cattle-chief who was both skilled and
likewise energetic? Whom did ye select <span
id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46) as her (life's.md) master who might hurl back
the fury of the wicked <span id="fr_47"></span>[3](#fn_47.md)?

Asha answers.

3\. To Him the (Divine Righteousness) answered with <span
id="fr_48"></span>[4](#fn_48) his sanctity. (Great was our perplexity.md);
a chieftain who war capable of smiting <span
id="fr_49"></span>[5](#fn_49) back (their fury.md), and who was himself
without hate (was not to be obtained by us); among such things as these,
those things are not to be known (by beings such as we) which are the
influences which approach <span id="fr_50"></span>[6](#fn_50) (and move.md)
the lofty fires <span id="fr_51"></span>[7](#fn_51.md) (revealing the
favour and the will of God <span id="fr_52"></span>[8](#fn_52).md).

Of beings He is the mightiest to whom those <span
id="fr_53"></span>[9](#fn_53.md)

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

who have performed their actions approach with invocations. (He has no
need to ask!)

Zarathu*s*tra intervenes <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md).

4\. The Great Creator <span id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55) (is himself.md)
most mindful of the uttered indications which have been fulfilled
beforehand hitherto in the deeds of <span id="fr_56"></span>[3](#fn_56.md)
demon-gods <span id="fr_57"></span>[4](#fn_57) and (good or evil.md) men,
and of those which shall be fulfilled by them <span
id="fr_58"></span>[5](#fn_58.md) hereafter. He Ahura is the discerning
arbiter; so shall it be to us <span id="fr_59"></span>[6](#fn_59.md) as He
shall will <span id="fr_60"></span>[7](#fn_60.md)!

5\. Therefore it is that we both, my soul <span
id="fr_61"></span>[8](#fn_61) and (the soul.md) of the mother <span
id="fr_62"></span>[9](#fn_62) Kine, (are.md) making our supplications

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

for the two worlds to Ahura, and with hands stretched out in entreaty,
when (we pray to the Great Creator <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63.md)
with questions in our doubt <span id="fr_64"></span>[2](#fn_64.md); (and He
will answer).

Not for the righteous liver, not for the thrifty (tiller of the earth),
shall there be destruction <span id="fr_65"></span>[3](#fn_65.md) together
with the wicked!

Ahura.

6\. Upon this the Lord, the Great Creator, He who understands the
mysterious grace <span id="fr_66"></span>[4](#fn_66.md) by His
insight <span id="fr_67"></span>[5](#fn_67.md), spake thus. Not in this
manner <span id="fr_68"></span>[6](#fn_68.md) is a spiritual master found
for us, nor a chieftain moved by Righteousness and appointed (in its
spirit); therefore Thee <span id="fr_69"></span>[7](#fn_69.md) have I
named <span id="fr_70"></span>[8](#fn_70) (as such a head.md) to the
diligent tiller of the ground <span id="fr_71"></span>[9](#fn_71.md)!

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

The Ameshôspends <span id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md).

7\. Mazda has created the inspired Word-of-reason which is a Mãthra of
fatness (for the offering), the (Divine) Righteousness consenting with
Him in his deed. Food he has prepared for the Kine and for the
eaters <span id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_73.md), He the one bountiful with
his (saving) doctrine; but whom hast Thou, endowed with the Good Mind,
who may give forth those (doctrines) by word of mouth to mortals <span
id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_74.md)?

Ahura.

8\. This man is found for me here who alone <span
id="fr_75"></span>[4](#fn_75.md) has

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

hearkened to our enunciations, Zarathu*s*tra Spitama! Our mighty and
completed acts of grace he desires to enounce for us, for (Me), the
Great Creator and for Righteousness; wherefore I will give him the good
abode <span id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76) (and authoritative place.md) of
such an one as speaks <span id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77.md)!

The G*e*u*s* Urvan.

9\. Upon this the Soul of the Kine lamented (: Woe is unto me) since (I
have obtained for myself) in my wounding a lord who is powerless to
effect (his) wish, the (mere) voice of a feeble and pusillanimous man,
whereas I desire one who is lord over his will (and able as one of royal
state to bring what he desires to effect <span
id="fr_78"></span>[3](#fn_78).md).

The Ameshôspends <span id="fr_79"></span>[4](#fn_79.md).

((Aye,) when shall he ever appear who may bring to her <span
id="fr_80"></span>[4](#fn_79.md) help strong-handed <span
id="fr_81"></span>[5](#fn_80)?.md)

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

Zarathu*s*tra <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_81.md).

10\. Do ye, O Ahura and thou, O Righteousness! grant gladness unto these
(our disciples), and the sovereign Kingdom (of the Deity) such as (is
established) in (His) Good Mind by which one bestows upon them the
peaceful amenities of home and quiet happiness (as against the fearful
ravages which they suffer <span id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_82).md), for of
these, O Great Creator! I ever thought Thee first possessor <span
id="fr_84"></span>[3](#fn_83.md)!

11\. And when shall the (Divine) Righteousness, the Good Mind (of the
Lord, and His) Sovereign Power (come) hastening <span
id="fr_85"></span>[4](#fn_84.md) to me (to give me strength for my task and
mission), O Great Creator, the Living Lord! (For without his I cannot
advance

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

or undertake my toil.) Do ye now therefore assign unto us your aid and
in abundance <span id="fr_86"></span>[1](#fn_85.md) for our great cause.
May we be (partakers) of the bountiful grace of these your equals <span
id="fr_87"></span>[2](#fn_86) (your counsellors and servants.md) <span
id="fr_88"></span>[3](#fn_87.md)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_36"></span>[4:1](sbe31006.htm#fr_36.md) Something like this is
implied.

<span id="fn_37"></span>[4:2](sbe31006.htm#fr_37.md) If verses 4, 5, 6,
were originally connected.

<span id="fn_38"></span>[4:3](sbe31006.htm#fr_38.md) Or possibly a company
of the religious chiefs poetically conceived to be present.

<span id="fn_39"></span>[6:1](sbe31006.htm#fr_39.md) K*e* ma tasha*t* can
only mean this here. The Pahlavi translator probably read kahmâi. He has
val mûn li tukhshî*d* (?) hômanam.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[6:2](sbe31006.htm#fr_40.md) One might think of
'inertia' as a rendering for remô, (if read), but the afflictions
complained of seem rather to imply active violence.

<span id="fn_41"></span>[6:3](sbe31006.htm#fr_41.md) Or read tâyu*sk*â
(robbery?) with the Pahlavi translation; 'yu' and 'vi' would be written
much alike in a manuscript.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[6:4](sbe31006.htm#fr_42.md) Vastâ has been found,
as I understand, in some manuscripts. The Persian manuscript of Haug has
a curious vâstîrî*d*âr (vâsta-rî*d*âr?) in the Pahlavi text, which seems
to confirm vastâ in the sense given.

<span id="fn_43"></span>[6:5](sbe31006.htm#fr_43.md) As there are very many
non-specialists to whom it is important to weigh this present subject as
closely as it may be possible, and as everything here is a matter of the
keenest questioning among experts, I add occasionally a word-for-word
rendering, although necessarily very uncouth: To you the Kine's soul
cried-complaining: For whom me did ye fashion? Who me made? Against me
assaulting-rapine, violence-and, desolations-\[blow\],
daring-insolence-and, (thievish) might-and (possibly change the text).
Not for me a pasture-giver than-you other; therefore to-me teach-ye good
(things) for-the-pasture (adj. acc. pl. neut.).

<span id="fn_44"></span>[6:6](sbe31006.htm#fr_44.md) I fear that I cannot
follow Haug in his later view, where he follows tradition in rather an
extreme manner, rendering 'the cutter (wounder) of the Ox.' Neither
Spiegel nor Justi would confide to a later myth to this degree (see Y.
XXXI, 9 and XLVI, 9). This is <span id="page_7">p. 7</span> mentioned,
however, not as complaining of an error, but solely to guard the reader
against the mistake of an eminent authority. (See also Roth, Z.D.M.G.,
Bd. 25, s. 9.)

<span id="fn_45"></span>[7:1](sbe31006.htm#fr_45.md) Observe the
personification of righteousness.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[7:2](sbe31006.htm#fr_46.md) Or, 'what
salvation-lord,' governed by dâtâ from the preceding line; so also the
Pahlavi translator mûn avo pavan nadûkîh khû*d*âî. U*s*tâ occurs only
here as a verbal form. Supply angha*t* in b.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[7:3](sbe31006.htm#fr_47.md) The Pahlavi aêshmo
anâêr zani*s*no.

<span id="fn_48"></span>[7:4](sbe31006.htm#fr_48.md) Or read ashem. The
Pahlavi has ashavahi*s*to pasukhvo gûft. I am not at all inclined to
accept vocatives for nominatives in the Gâthas.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[7:5](sbe31006.htm#fr_49.md) Sar-*g*an, compare
Verethra*g*an. The Pahlavi indicates this by tanû sardârîh.

<span id="fn_50"></span>[7:6](sbe31006.htm#fr_50.md) Possibly, 'by which he
approaches.'

<span id="fn_51"></span>[7:7](sbe31006.htm#fr_51.md) The Pahlavi rôshano î
râsto.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[7:8](sbe31006.htm#fr_52.md) Cp. Y. XXX, 1: yâ
rao*ke*bî*s* daresatâ urvâzâ.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[7:9](sbe31006.htm#fr_53.md) The Pahlavi indicates
a third person; and keredushâ is far the most simply explained as a nom.
pl. Recall mâ mashâ and man (?) mathâ. Otherwise, 'to whom I will come
with activity and invoking.'

<span id="fn_54"></span>[8:1](sbe31006.htm#fr_54.md) A verse or verses may
here have fallen out.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[8:2](sbe31006.htm#fr_55.md) I cannot persuade
myself to accept the nearly universally accepted comparison of Mazd*a*u
and medhâ. See note on [p. 104](sbe31013.htm#page_104.md).

<span id="fn_56"></span>[8:3](sbe31006.htm#fr_56.md) Or, 'He has done by
Daêvas?' If thus, absolute and not qualified sovereignty would be
indicated. See the last line

<span id="fn_57"></span>[8:4](sbe31006.htm#fr_57.md) Observe that while 'by
Daêva-worshippers' would be an admirable rendering for Daêvâi*s*,
because more commonplace and therefore safer, it is here impossible on
account of mashyâi*sk*â. We are closely confined to the acceptance of a
large idea. Ahura was mindful of what transpired in the deeds of
Daêva-gods and not in those of Daêva-worshippers alone. The inst. must
be modified.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[8:5](sbe31006.htm#fr_58.md) As varshaitê is
elsewhere used in an active sense, it is possible, but not probable,
that a special predestination may be indicated. 'He shall do by means of
Daêvas and men.'

<span id="fn_59"></span>[8:6](sbe31006.htm#fr_59.md) 'To us men,' not to us
Ameshôspends, of course!

<span id="fn_60"></span>[8:7](sbe31006.htm#fr_60.md) Verbatim. Mazda
the-words most-mindful which for have-been-fulfilled before by-means-of-
(the actions of) Daêvas-and men-and what-and (shall)-be-done after, He
the discriminating lord; so to-us shall-it-be as He shall-choose.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[8:8](sbe31006.htm#fr_61.md) This seems to prove
positively that a human being speaks here and in the previous verse;
'the soul of Righteousness' is of course impossible.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[8:9](sbe31006.htm#fr_62.md) Some have referred the
word to the root zan obscurely present in it; otherwise a drivable cow;
one mature and fit for use. The term used in the Vendîdâd in a common
meaning as merely <span id="page_9">p. 9</span> designating a cow at a
certain age, may be the familiar use of an adjective here applied in the
ancient Gâtha in a sacred sense.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[9:1](sbe31006.htm#fr_63.md) This passage is one of
the strongest for the comparison of Mazd*a*u and medhâ. The sense
'asking wisdom in our doubt,' is admirable. I cannot however accept the
comparison.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[9:2](sbe31006.htm#fr_64.md) Pavan gômânîkîh
hampûrsânî; root dî.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[9:3](sbe31006.htm#fr_65.md) The Pahlavi
awasîni*s*nîh\*, but in other connections fra*g*yâiti*s* might well mean
'continued life;' 'life long endured with the wicked.'

<span id="fn_66"></span>[9:4](sbe31006.htm#fr_66.md) The Pahlavi has
vishûpi*s*nŏ, which here affords a better meaning; see however Y.
XLVIII, 9. We might read as alternative here, 'knowing the calamity to
be averted.'

<span id="fn_67"></span>[9:5](sbe31006.htm#fr_67.md) Uncertain. The Pahlavi
however indicates 'discernment.'

<span id="fn_68"></span>[9:6](sbe31006.htm#fr_68.md) One is strongly
tempted to read aêvô, 'not a single chief,' but the ancient writing read
by the Pahlavi translator had aêvâ ahû.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[9:7](sbe31006.htm#fr_69.md) This indicates that
Zarathu*s*tra had been the speaker in the previous verses.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[9:8](sbe31006.htm#fr_70.md) Appointed.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[9:9](sbe31006.htm#fr_71.md) Verbatim. Thereupon
spake Ahura Mazda knowing the-wonderful (thing) through-insight (?) not
thus a master found, nor a ruler righteous-order-from-even from,
therefore for thee to-the-thrifty-and to-the-husbandman-and (I)
as-a-creator I-have-made.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[10:1](sbe31006.htm#fr_72.md) Or a company of the
saints conceived to be present.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[10:2](sbe31006.htm#fr_73.md) So some writers,
accepting an irregular reading *hv*arushaêibyô after the indication of
the Pahlavi translation. Otherwise compare 'rush' (?), uru = ru, and
render 'to the estranged.' We have often to stretch the meaning more
than this. Converting instructions are elsewhere suggested for 'all
mankind.'

<span id="fn_74"></span>[10:3](sbe31006.htm#fr_74.md) The translation of
Neryosangh is added here not merely because it is of interest, but
because it is, together with the Pahlavi translation, of the last
importance in forming correct conclusions. It may be rendered as
follows; and the reader may regard it as a specimen, but by no means a
particularly favourable one. At the words âzûtôî*s* and maretaêibyô
different texts were before him and the Pahlavi translator as well.
Those words are elsewhere rendered by the latter *k*arpîh and
an*s*ûtâân: This greatest magnitude (sic) of the Mãthra, the Lord
produced together with righteousness as his fellow-worker \[ \]. The
Great Wise One discloses the herds to the eaters; and he discloses also
the great matter to the well-taught scholars. Who is thine, who endowed
with the best mind, gives the two things, with the mouth to those who
are prosecuting studies (sic)? To expect an ancient rendering to be
closer would be unreasonable. The errors (as to root) are not errors,
but the certain signs of differing MSS. This constantly occurs; and it
is hardly necessary to add that sometimes from such supposed mistakes we
get the only possible means of recovering the original text.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[10:4](sbe31006.htm#fr_75.md) Repeating the
announcement in verse 6. The aêvâ in 6 would incline one to read aêvâ
(y*e* n*e* aêvâ), but the manuscript before the Pahlavi translator read
aêvô = khadûk. It is quite out of the question to suppose his aêtûno and
khadûk to be accidental. A sharp distinction is made.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[11:1](sbe31006.htm#fr_76.md) So the Pahlavi
translator, giving the only critical etymology in his hûdemûnîh, the
gloss aside.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[11:2](sbe31006.htm#fr_77.md) The Pahlavi text
corrected by the Persian MS. may be rendered as follows: This gift I
obtained \[ \]. For this one is he who was listening to that which is
our teaching, Zartûsht, the Spitâmân. For us, Aûharmazd, and for
Aharâyîh is his desire, \[that is, that perfectly performed duty, and
good works are desired by him\]. He recites also a remedy-making (free
or erroneous), \[that is, he declares a remedy-making against the Drû*g*
who is in the world\]; on account of which saying for his word of piety
which he utters, they give him a good abode \[ \]. (The glosses are
often from a later hand and erroneous. Sometimes, however, they contain
the truth while the text is futile. I drop them in the present citations
when they are of no importance.)

<span id="fn_78"></span>[11:3](sbe31006.htm#fr_78.md) Observe that
Zarathu*s*tra, like other prophets, met at times little honour from his
fellow-countrymen who are here well represented by the voice of the
Kine's Soul. (See Y. XLVI, 1.)

<span id="fn_79"></span>[11:4](sbe31006.htm#fr_80.md) Or could not hôi be
taken in a reflective sense, and referred to the first person like the
possessive sve; see the connection.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[11:5](sbe31006.htm#fr_81.md) Verbatim.
Thereupon-and the Kine's Soul wept: (I) who <span id="page_12">p.
12</span> (lament) one-not-able-to-effect-his-wish in-wounding
as-a-master (or, I established?) \[ \], whom as-against I-wish one
wish-controlling-and-effecting-as-a-sovereign. When ever he
may-(shall)-be who to her (possibly to-me-myself?) shall-give
effected-by-the-hand help.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[12:1](sbe31006.htm#fr_82.md) Zarathu*s*tra, having
accepted his call to be the Ratu or his substitute, at once interposes
with a prayer for his suffering charge.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[12:2](sbe31006.htm#fr_83.md) See verse 1, to which
reference is continually made as the chief expression of the sufferings
to be remedied.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[12:3](sbe31006.htm#fr_84.md) The Pahlavi without
glosses may be rendered as follows: Give ye assistance to these, O
Aûharmazd, Ashavahi*s*t and Khshatraver! So also Vohûman, who gives him
a pleasing habitation, and also joy. I also think that the first gain
and obtaining of this is from thee. (With the gloss slightly different;
but valman should be rendered according to ahyâ.)

The text literally is as follows: (Do) ye to these, O Ahura! happiness
(? possibly strength; see the Pahlavi) grant, O Asha! Khshathra-and
(=the Kingdom) such (kingdom as) by Vohu Manah by-which amenities
peaceful-joy-and (one) may give-or-establish; I-even of this, O Mazda!
Thee I thought foremost possessor.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[12:4](sbe31006.htm#fr_85.md) So the Pahlavi
translation indicates; compare *g*imâ and frâ man (?) mathâ; otherwise
mâmashâ = I hasten (to fulfil my mission).

<span id="fn_85"></span>[13:1](sbe31006.htm#fr_86.md) The Pahlavi has
kabed. For the fundamental idea compare p*ri*ksh + suffix.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[13:2](sbe31006.htm#fr_87.md) The Ameshôspends just
mentioned, together with whom Ahura governs and blesses His people. Ahmâ
(so conjecturing with Barth.), is also quite sufficiently indicated by
the lanman of the Pahlavi. Whether an instrumental *e*hmâ can be
accepted is doubtful. The form should be altered.

If *e*hmâ stands, i*s*tem must be understood, or the instrumental taken
in a possessive sense.

Ahmâ has no authority from MSS., but is better than anghâmâ, as being
nearer the MSS.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[13:3](sbe31006.htm#fr_88.md) As an impartial
specimen I render Ner. thus: Whence will that gift come to me, (the gift
which is) A*s*avahista, Gvahmana, and Saharevara, \[that is, sanctity,
the highest (best) mind, and the sovereignty, where is the place of the
reward which will thus come to me?\]. (Here the translation falls into
confusion from an error which is most interesting and instructive,
because it is corrected by Ner. in an alternative rendering in the
gloss. As has been seldom noticed his original was the Pahlavi word
pâ*d*adahi*s*nînê*d*, rather than the Gâthic paitî-zânatâ. This Pahlavi
form he could not at first believe to be a second plural. Indeed the
Pahlavi glossist may have taken it as a third sg. Neryosangh therefore
abortively renders word-for-word as follows: You, O Great Wise One! it
offers or presents more excellently through the 'greatest exaltation'
(the holy cause). But he recovers himself in the gloss by reading the
Pahlavi pâ*d*âdahi*s*nŏ vâdûnyên as an imperative: \[Provide a reward
through that spotless exaltation (the irreproachable cause)\]
continuing: Here, O Lord! is the gift (which is) ours, and (which comes)
to us from Thee.)
