### YASNA XLII.

#### A SUPPLEMENT TO THE HAPTANGHÂITI <span id="fr_1222"></span>[5](#fn_1212.md).

1\. We worship You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! with the entire collection
of this Yasna, Haptanghâiti

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (as we sum up
all). And we sacrifice to the fountains of the waters, and to the
fordings of the rivers, to the forkings of the highways, and to the
meetings of the roads.

2\. And we sacrifice to the hills that run with torrents, and the lakes
that brim with waters, and to the corn that fills the corn-fields; and
we sacrifice to both the protector and the Creator, to both
Zarathu*s*tra and the Lord.

3\. And we sacrifice to both earth and heaven, and to the stormy wind
that Mazda made, and to the peak of high Haraiti, and to the land, and
all things good.

4\. And we worship the Good Mind (in the living) and the spirits of the
saints. And we sacrifice to the fish of fifty-fins <span
id="fr_1223"></span>[1](#fn_1213.md), and to that sacred beast the
Unicorn <span id="fr_1224"></span>[2](#fn_1214) (?.md) which stands in
Vouru-kasha, and we sacrifice to that sea of Vouru-kasha where he
stands, (5) and to the Haoma, golden-flowered, growing on the heights;
yea, to the Haoma that restores us, and aids this world's advance. We
sacrifice to Haoma that driveth death afar, (6) and to the flood-streams
of the waters, and to the great flights of the birds, and to the
approaches of the Fire-priests, as they approach us from afar <span
id="fr_1225"></span>[3](#fn_1215.md), and seek to gain the provinces, and
spread the ritual lore. And we sacrifice to the Bountiful Immortals
all <span id="fr_1226"></span>[4](#fn_1216.md)!
