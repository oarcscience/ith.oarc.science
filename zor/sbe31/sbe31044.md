### YASNA XXII.

#### THE SACRIFICE CONTINUES.

1\. With the Baresman brought hither together with the Zaothra, for the
worship of the Creator Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the glorious, and
for that of the Bountiful Immortals, I desire to approach this Haoma
with my praise, offered (as it is) with punctilious sanctity (or, for a
blessing), and this fresh milk, and this plant Hadhânaêpata. 2. And, as
an act of worship to the beneficent waters, I desire to approach these
Zaothras with (my) praise offered (as they are) with punctilious
sanctity, having the Haoma with them, and the flesh, with the
Hadhânaêpata. And I desire to approach the Haoma-water with my praise
for the beneficent waters; and I desire to approach the stone mortar and
the iron mortar with my praise. 3. And I desire to approach this plant
for the Baresman with my praise, and the well-timed prayer for
blessings, that which has approached (to accept our homage), and the
memorised recital and the fulfilment of the good Mazdayasnian Faith, and
the heard recital of the Gâthas, and the well-timed and successful
prayer for blessings, that of the holy lord of the ritual order. And I
desire to approach these wood-billets and their perfume with my
praise,—thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son! Yea, I desire to
approach all good things with my praise, those which Mazda made, and
which have the seed of sanctity (within them), (4) for the propitiation
of Ahura Mazda and of the Bountiful

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Immortals, and of
Sraosha the blessed, and of Ahura Mazda's Fire, the lofty ritual
lord <span id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1146.md)!

20\. And I desire to approach this Haoma with (my) praise, that which is
thus lifted up with sanctity, and this milk (fresh as it is, and as if)
living and lifted up with sanctity, and this plant the Hadhânaêpata
lifted up with sanctity. 21. And I desire to approach these Zaothras
with (my) praise for the beneficial waters, these Zaothras which have
the H(a)oma with them and the milk with them, and the Hadhânaêpata, and
which are lifted up with sanctity. And I desire to approach the
Haoma-water with (my) praise for the beneficial waters, and the two
mortars, the stone one and the iron one, (22) and I desire to approach
this branch for the Baresman with my praise, and the memorised recital
and fulfilment of the Mazdayasnian law, and the heard recital of the
Gâthas, and the well-timed and persistent prayer for blessings (uttered)
by the holy lord <span id="fr_1156"></span>[2](#fn_1147.md) of the ritual
order, and this wood and perfume, even thine, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's son,
and all good objects Mazda-made (23) for the propitiation of Ahura
Mazda, the resplendent, the glorious, and of the Bountiful Immortals,
and of Mithra of the wide pastures, and of Râman *Hv*âstra <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[3](#fn_1148), (24.md) and of the resplendent sun,
immortal, radiant, of the fleet horses, and of Vayu, (of predominant
influence and) working on high, set over the other beings in the
creation \[(Pâzand); that is for thee thus (O Vayu) when thine influence
is that which appertains

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

to Spe*n*ta Mainyu <span id="fr_1158"></span>[1](#fn_1149.md)\], and for
the propitiation of the most just knowledge Mazda-given, and of the holy
and good Religion, the Mazdayasnian Faith; (25) for the propitiation of
the Mãthra Spe*n*ta, (the bounteous) and holy, and the effective,
instituted against the Daêvas, the Zarathu*s*trian law, and of the long
descent of the good Mazdayasnian Faith <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[2](#fn_1150.md) \[the holding in mind and devotion to
the Mãthra Spe*n*ta, and knowledge of the Mazdayasnian Religion\] for
the propitiation of the understanding which is innate and Mazda-made,
and of that which is heard by the ear; (26) and for thy propitiation,
the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son! \[(Pâzand); (yea) thine, the Fire's, O
Ahura Mazda's son\] with all the fires, and for the propitiation of
Mount Ushi-darena, the Mazda-made, radiant with sanctity; (27) and of
all the holy Yazads, spiritual and earthly, and of the holy Fravashis,
the redoubted and overwhelming, those of the ancient lore, and those of
the next of kin and of the Yazad of the spoken name!
