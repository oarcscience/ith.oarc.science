### VISPARAD VII (SP. VIII) <span id="fr_1439"></span>[2](#fn_1426.md).

1\. We worship the (sacrificial) words correctly uttered, and Sraosha
(Obedience) the blessed, and the good Ashi, (the blest order of our
rites), and Nairya-sangha. And we worship the victorious Peace as the
unprostrated and unmoved. And we sacrifice to the Fravashis of the
saints, and to the *K*inva*t* Bridge, and to the Garô Nmâna of Ahura,
even Heaven, the best world of the saints, the shining and all glorious!

2\. And we sacrifice to that better path <span
id="fr_1440"></span>[3](#fn_1427.md) that leads to that Best World (as
well). And we worship Ar*s*tâ*t* (Justice) the good, which helps the
settlements to advance and flourish, benefiting them thereby, that
Ar*s*tâ*t* which is the Mazdayasnian Faith; and (with her) we worship
Rashnu the most just, and

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mithra of the wide
pastures. And we worship Pare*n*di the wealthy, wealthy with a wealth of
thoughts, with a throng of words, and with a breadth of actions, \[for
she makes our persons agile (for good thoughts and words and actions)\].
3. And we worship that virile defensive <span
id="fr_1441"></span>[1](#fn_1428.md) Heroism which possesses men who think
beforehand, and heroic men, which is fleeter <span
id="fr_1442"></span>[2](#fn_1429.md) than the fleet, stronger than the
strong, which comes to him who is endowed by God, which, when especially
made theirs by men, produces one who is a freer of the body. And we
worship Sleep <span id="fr_1443"></span>[3](#fn_1430.md), the Mazda-made,
the gladdener of the herd and men. 4. And we worship those things in the
creation of the holy which are the ancient institutions, those formed
before the sky, the water, the land, the plants, and the Kine of blessed
gift. And we worship the sea Vouru-kasha, and the stormy wind which is
made by Mazda, and the shining heaven, of old created, the first-made
earthly object of (all) the earthly world.

5\. And we worship thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son! the holy lord of
the ritual order, and this Baresman, having the Zaothra with it, and the
girdle with it, spread out with sanctity, the holy ritual chief, and we
worship Apãm-napâ*t* (the son of waters).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1426"></span>[345:2](sbe31084.htm#fr_1439.md) This chapter
should be read after Yasna XVII, which it appropriately follows in the
Vendîdâd Sâdah.

<span id="fn_1427"></span>[345:3](sbe31084.htm#fr_1440.md) Possibly 'the
best (better) course of that best world.'

<span id="fn_1428"></span>[346:1](sbe31084.htm#fr_1441.md) One might
consider, 'virile power which has men and heroes in the mind
beforehand;' but vareti = gûrdîh.

<span id="fn_1429"></span>[346:2](sbe31084.htm#fr_1442) Âsyay*a*u (sic.md)
and takhmôtã*s*yay*a*u (sic) agree with feminines; possibly because of
the male qualities referred to. They might be said to be in apposition
lather than in agreement with the feminine.

<span id="fn_1430"></span>[346:3](sbe31084.htm#fr_1443.md) Sleep is
elsewhere an evil; a Demon, Bûshyãsta, rules it; but this is untimely
sleep; see, on the other hand, Y. XLIV, 5.
