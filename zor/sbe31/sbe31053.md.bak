### YASNA XXXVIII.

#### TO THE EARTH AND THE SACRED WATERS.

1\. And now we worship this earth which bears us, together with Thy
wives <span id="fr_1203"></span>[3](#fn_1193.md), O Ahura Mazda! yea, those
Thy wives do we worship which are so desired from their sanctity. 2. We
sacrifice to their zealous wishes, and their capabilities, their
inquiries (as to duty), and their wise acts of pious reverence,

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

and with these their blessedness, their full vigour and good portions,
their good fame and ample wealth. 3. O ye waters! now we worship you,
you that are showered down, and you that stand in pools and vats, and
you that bear forth (our loaded vessels?) ye female Ahuras of Ahura, you
that serve us (all) in helpful ways, well forded and full-flowing, and
effective for the bathings, we will seek you and for both the worlds! 4.
Therefore did Ahura Mazda give you names, O ye beneficent <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[1](#fn_1194.md) ones! when He who made the good
bestowed you. And by these names we worship you, and by them we would
ingratiate ourselves with you, and with them would we bow before you,
and direct our prayers to you with free confessions of our debt. O
waters, ye who are productive <span id="fr_1205"></span>[2](#fn_1195.md),
and ye maternal ones, ye with heat <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[3](#fn_1196) that suckles the (frail and.md) needy
(before birth), ye waters (that have once been) rulers of (us) all, we
will now address you as the best, and the most beautiful; those (are)
yours, those good (objects). of our offerings, ye long of arm to reach
our sickness, or misfortune <span id="fr_1207"></span>[4](#fn_1197.md), ye
mothers of our life!

sicknesses and welfare.'
