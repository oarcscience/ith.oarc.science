### VISPARAD XII (SP. XIV) <span id="fr_1464"></span>[3](#fn_1450.md).

1\. For the offered Haomas which have been offered in libation to that
lofty Lord Ahura Mazda and to the holy Zarathu*s*tra Spitama (produce)
abundance in cattle and in men; and this <span
id="fr_1465"></span>[4](#fn_1451) abundance is (as.md) the good Sraosha,
who accompanies (us) with the great

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

splendour of sanctity, and may he <span
id="fr_1466"></span>[1](#fn_1452.md) be here with energetic effort (to aid
us in our worship).

2\. We offer the wise offerings of the Ahuna-vairya intoned with
sanctity and yet to be intoned, possessing their many teachings of
religious wisdom (as they do), and those of the two mortars which pour
the Haomas out, and which are pushed forward with precision <span
id="fr_1467"></span>[2](#fn_1453.md), and are now in the course of being
thus advanced once more <span id="fr_1468"></span>[3](#fn_1454.md). 3. (And
so we teach as well the many teachings of the religious wisdom)
contained in the words correctly spoken, in the Zarathu*s*trian
utterances <span id="fr_1469"></span>[4](#fn_1455.md), and in the
ceremonies correctly practised, and the Baresmans spread exactly, and
the Haomas pressed correctly, and the praise, Yasnas, and the doctrines
of the Mazdayasnian Religion with their recitations, and their
movements. 4. For thus they may become to us more full of devices and of
wisdom, and so we offer these wise ritual deeds in the creation, so we
impart them with their many points of meaning while we (ourselves) still
ponder them as those which Ahura Mazda, the holy One, delivered, which
have (as if) their nourishment from Vohu Manah <span
id="fr_1470"></span>[5](#fn_1456.md) and their growth from the Righteous
Order, which are the greatest of all beings, the best, and the most
beautiful for thus shall these be to us the more full of wisest meaning,
and more full of incitation <span id="fr_1471"></span>[6](#fn_1457.md), and
may we be among those (who are) of Spe*n*ta Mainyu's world in that we
are imparting (to the chosen) these

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

precepts of the wisest meaning and these incitations which are contained
therein. 5. And full of wisest meaning be ye two to us, O (thou) stone
mortar, and (thou) the iron one, as ye are now turned, and as ye are now
being advanced <span id="fr_1472"></span>[1](#fn_1458.md), ye two mortars
of the house, \[and of the village, of the tribe, and of the province,
and ye who are in this house (itself), this village, tribe, and
province\]; yea, in those which are ours, Mazdayasnians, who are
steadfast in our worship, who appear with our wood-billets and our
perfumes, and with our supplicated blessings \[(Pâzand) for so may they
be to us, the more full of wisest teaching\].
