### IV. GÂH AIWISRÛTHRIMA <span id="fr_1575"></span>[5](#fn_1547.md)

1\. Propitiation be to Ahura Mazda. A blessing is Asha Vahi*s*ta—. I
confess myself a Mazdayasnian, and of Zarathu*s*tra's order, a foe to
the Daêvas, devoted to the lore of the Lord, for Aiwisrûthrima, and
Aibigaya <span id="fr_1576"></span>[6](#fn_1548), the holy lord(s.md) of
the ritual order, for their sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise,
and for Frâda*t*-vîspãm-hu*g*yâiti <span
id="fr_1577"></span>[7](#fn_1549.md) and Zarathu*s*trôtema <span
id="fr_1578"></span>[8](#fn_1550), the holy lord(s.md) of the ritual order,
for their sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and praise. 2. And to the

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fravashis of the
saints, and to the women who have many sons, and to that prosperity of
home which lasts without reverse throughout the year, and to Strength,
well-shaped and stately, and to the victorious Blow Ahura-given, and for
the crushing Ascendency which it bestows, (to all) be propitiation—. 3,
4. (See Gâh I, 3, 4.) 5. And we sacrifice to Aiwisrûthrima (and)
Aibigaya, the holy lord(s) of the ritual order, and to thee, O Ahura
Mazda's Fire! And we sacrifice to the stone-mortar, and to the
iron-mortar, and to this Baresman spread with sanctity, with the
Zaothra, and with its girdle, holy lords of the ritual order. Also we
sacrifice to the sacred two, to the waters and the plants, and to the
sacred vows for the soul, (as) holy lord(s) of the ritual order. 6. Also
we sacrifice to Frâda*t*-vîspãm-hu*g*yâiti (as) ruling in the ritual
order; and we sacrifice to Zarathu*s*tra, the holy lord of the ritual;
also we sacrifice to the Mãthra Spe*n*ta, (the bounteous word of
reason <span id="fr_1579"></span>[1](#fn_1551).md), and to the soul of the
Kine, and to the Zarathu*s*trôtema <span
id="fr_1580"></span>[2](#fn_1552.md). Also we sacrifice to the Fire-priest,
the holy lord of the ritual order, and to the charioteer (the warrior),
the holy lord of the ritual order. Also we sacrifice to the thrifty
tiller of the earth, the holy lord of the ritual order. And we sacrifice
to the house-lord, and to the village-chief, and to the Za*n*tu-chief,
and to the province-chief of the province, the holy lord of the ritual
order. 8. And we sacrifice to the youth of the good thoughts, good
words, and good deeds, even to the youth of good conscience, the holy
lord of the ritual order; yea, we

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

sacrifice to the youth of the spoken word (who spoke the words which we
hold so dear <span id="fr_1581"></span>[1](#fn_1553).md), the holy lord of
the ritual order. Yea, we sacrifice to the youth who is given to his kin
(and married to his blood), the holy lord of the ritual order. And we
sacrifice to him who ranges through the province <span
id="fr_1582"></span>[2](#fn_1554.md), and to the itinerant with his many
arts <span id="fr_1583"></span>[3](#fn_1555.md), the holy ritual lords. And
we sacrifice to the house-mistress, holy, and ruling in the ritual
order. 9. And we sacrifice to the holy woman forward <span
id="fr_1584"></span>[4](#fn_1556.md) in good thoughts, and words, and
deeds, receiving her instructions well, having her husband as her lord,
the holy, and such as Âramaiti, the bounteous, is, and such as are thy
wives, O Mazda, Lord!

And we sacrifice to the holy man most forward in good thoughts, and
words, and works, wise as to piety, simple as to sin, by whose deeds the
settlements advance in the holy order, for the worship and homage of the
Zarathu*s*trôtema, the lord. And we sacrifice to the Zarathu*s*trôtema,
the holy lord of the ritual order. 10. And we sacrifice to the good,
heroic, bountiful Fravashis of the saints, and to the women who have
many sons, and to that Prosperity which endures throughout the year, and
to the well-shaped and stately Strength. And we sacrifice to the Blow of
Victory, Ahura-given, and to the crushing Ascendency which it secures.
11, 12. (See Gâh I, 9, 10.) 13. (The Ahuna-vairya, &c.)
