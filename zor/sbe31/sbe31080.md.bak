### VISPARAD III.

#### BEGINNING OF THE HAOMA OFFERING; ROLL-CALL OF THE PRIEST <span id="fr_1420"></span>[2](#fn_1408.md).

1\. (The Zaotar speaks.) (I call for) the Hâvanan <span
id="fr_1421"></span>[3](#fn_1409.md), and would have him here.

(The Ratu answers.) I will come (and fulfil his duties).

(The Zaotar speaks.) I would have the Âtarevakhsha <span
id="fr_1422"></span>[4](#fn_1410.md) here.

(The Ratu answers.) I will come (and fulfil the services which fall to
his charge).

(The Zaotar.) I would have the Frabaretar <span
id="fr_1423"></span>[5](#fn_1411.md).

(The Ratu.) I will come (and fulfil the services which fall to his
charge).

(The Zaotar.) I would have the Âbere*t* <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[6](#fn_1412.md) present.

(The Ratu.) I will come (for him).

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

(The Zaotar.) I would have the Âsnatar <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[1](#fn_1413.md).

(The Ratu.) I will come (and do the duties which he serves).

(The Zaotar.) I would have the Raêthwi*s*kar <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[2](#fn_1414.md) to be here.

(The Ratu.) I will come (for him).

(The Zaotar.) I would have the Sraoshâvareza <span
id="fr_1427"></span>[3](#fn_1415.md) present, the wisest one, the most
correct and veracious in his speech.

(The Ratu.) I will come. 2. (The Zaotar.) I would have the Fire-priest
to be here, and the warrior, and the thrifty tiller <span
id="fr_1428"></span>[4](#fn_1416.md) of the earth, and the house-lord, and
the lords of the Vîs and the Za*n*tu.

3\. And I summon the youth of holy thoughts, words and works, and of
good conscience; (yea), the youth of good speech, given (in marriage) to
his kin <span id="fr_1429"></span>[5](#fn_1417.md). And I summon the
province-ranger, and the itinerant of many arts, and the house-mistress.

4\. And I summon the woman advanced in her holy thoughts, and words, and
deeds, and well subordinated, whose ruler is her lord <span
id="fr_1430"></span>[6](#fn_1418), the holy one, who is (as.md) the
bounteous Âramaiti; (yea), I summon even Thy wives, O Ahura! And I
summon likewise the holy man advanced in his good thoughts, and words,
and deeds, who is learned in pious lore, and innocent of the Kayadha,
and by whose deeds the settlements are furthered in the righteous order.

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

5\. Yea, we summon you, whoever you may be, if only chiefs of the
Mazdayasnians; and we summon the Bounteous Immortals, and the pious
Saoshya*n*ts (the prophets for our help), the most correct and truthful
in their speech, the most zealous, the most glorious in their thoughts,
the greatest ones, and the powerful; and we summon the Fire-priests, and
the warriors, and the diligent husbandman of the Mazdayasnian Faith.

6 <span id="fr_1431"></span>[1](#fn_1419). (The Zaotar..md) As an Ahû to be
(revered and) chosen, the Âtarevakhsha (announcing) speaks forth <span
id="fr_1432"></span>[2](#fn_1420.md) to me.

(The Ratu \[?\].) So let the Ratu from his righteousness, holy and
learned, speak forth.

(The Ratu.) As an Aha to be (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar
(announcing) speaks forth <span id="fr_1433"></span>[2](#fn_1420.md) to me.

(The Zaotar.) So let the Ratu from (his) righteousness, holy and
learned, speak forth.

(The Ratu.) Thou art the announcer for us, O Fire-priest! \[(Pâzand.) It
is the <span id="fr_1434"></span>[3](#fn_1421) Zaotar (who is meant.md).\]

(The Zaotar.) I will come as this Zaotar, and recite the Staota Yêsnya
with memorised intoning, chanting, and praise.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1408"></span>[341:2](sbe31080.htm#fr_1420.md) This chapter 1-5
follows Y. XI, 1-8 in the Vendîdâd Sâdah; so, appropriately.

<span id="fn_1409"></span>[341:3](sbe31080.htm#fr_1421.md) The Ratu answers
for all according to the rubric printed by Westergaard, but of later
origin than the text. It arose from the fact that the several offices
were later united in that of the Ratu. Originally the corresponding
official answered to his title. The Hâvanan was the Mobad who pounded
the Haoma in the mortar.

<span id="fn_1410"></span>[341:4](sbe31080.htm#fr_1422.md) The Mobad who
fed the Fire.

<span id="fn_1411"></span>[341:5](sbe31080.htm#fr_1423.md) The Mobad who
aided the presentations.

<span id="fn_1412"></span>[341:6](sbe31080.htm#fr_1424.md) The water
carrier.

<span id="fn_1413"></span>[342:1](sbe31080.htm#fr_1425.md) The washer.

<span id="fn_1414"></span>[342:2](sbe31080.htm#fr_1426) The mixer (?.md),
or the Mobad who attended to disinfections.

<span id="fn_1415"></span>[342:3](sbe31080.htm#fr_1427.md) The Mobad who
attended to penance.

<span id="fn_1416"></span>[342:4](sbe31080.htm#fr_1428.md) The typical
layman.

<span id="fn_1417"></span>[342:5](sbe31080.htm#fr_1429.md) This important
custom was fully treated in the lost Nask, No. 16 (or No. 18, by another
reckoning).

<span id="fn_1418"></span>[342:6](sbe31080.htm#fr_1430.md) So the most, but
ratukhshathra means elsewhere 'ruling in the ritual as supreme.'

<span id="fn_1419"></span>[343:1](sbe31080.htm#fr_1431.md) This section
follows Y. XI, 9-15 in the V.S., preceding a section described as Y. XI,
59, 60, in the B.V.S.

<span id="fn_1420"></span>[343:2](sbe31080.htm#fr_1433.md) Probably in an
imperative sense, or, with some, an infinitive.

<span id="fn_1421"></span>[343:3](sbe31080.htm#fr_1434.md) Read Zaotasti
which contains sandhi. It seems a gloss to explain the Âthraom (sic). It
is zaotâ asti.
