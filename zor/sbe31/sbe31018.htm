<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This chapter divides itself quite naturally into sections. 1-4 belong together, then 5 and 6, 7 seems less closely connected; then follows 8-12.</p>  
<p>1. A struggle is evidently at hand, whether the same as that to which allusion is more than once made, by incitation, as in Y. XXXI, 18; with anxious expectation, as in Y. XLIV, 15, 16; or as if in a sense of victory, as in Y. XLV, 1; or of defeat, as in Y. XLIX, is difficult, or rather impossible to determine. But with the verses 10, 11, 12 in view, together with the dispirited, Y. XLIX, 1, we shall say at once that, if this verse was intended to connect with them, an armed struggle had been expected, whether the decisive one or not, we need not say.</p>  
<p>The saint, that is, the pious adherent to the Holy Order, whatever may be the result of the preliminary struggles, is encouraged by a view of the end. 2. But the burdened worshipper craves still further reassurance before the storms of battle came once more upon him. 3. For little as the assurances of Ahura are valued</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">by the heretic, to the man who understands the true relations, what Ahura declares by means of His inspired prophets, the secret-announcers, this is, of all things, best; (he need not ask as elsewhere, Y. XXXI, 17). 4. And whoever would hope for spiritual growth and purity must turn his mind to that word of the Deity, and pursue its teachings faithfully, and so at last his fears will vanish, for his doubts will disappear. He will understand as the Lord has taught.</p>  
<p>5. This verse seems a prayer to &Acirc;ramaiti; when the long struggles shall have found their issues, and the one party or the other wins the day, let not that party be the evil alliance with its monarch. For, if the government is set up, and carried on with all the prescribed ceremonial and moral exactness of the wise <I>K</I>isti; if men who toil for the sacred Kine, and with the virtue of those who cultivate her, hold the reins of power, and can so suppress the predatory raids on defenceless, as well as unoffending victims, then no gift of Ahura, since the tribes became a nation, could be looked upon as a greater, or as so great a blessing, as the correct Authority, and the Order of the Faith.</p>  
<p>6. For that sacred Kine, as so often already implied or stated, was all in all to the pious worshipper. It was she, representing, as she did, all wealth in herds, who alone could sustain the home-life of happy industry. And this is the reason why Ahura had originally caused the herbage to grow for her support.</p>  
<p>7. Urging the overthrow of the spirit of Rapine in accordance with the Kine's complaint, he exhorts the armed masses to energetic and offensive valour.</p>  
<p>8. He then vehemently, although only rhetorically, asks how he may use the proper prayers to rally the needed coadjutors among the chiefs (Y. XLVI, 9) to carry on the struggle. 9. Again he utters a cry for relief in his suspense, and of entreaty for light as to the rewards, which did not concern this life for its own sake (verse 1) merely or chiefly; but which were spiritual blessings received here in preparation for the spiritual world. 10. 'When,' he repeats as one among similar questions four times repeated, 'when shall the ideal men appear whose thoughtful plans (Y. XLVI, 3) shall drive hence the polluted schemes of the false priests and of the tyrants (Y. XLVI, 1)? 11. And when shall &Acirc;ramaiti, the kindly piety of home, appear, she who, like the earth, spreads pastures for the peaceful kine, when shall she appear with holy Khshathra (later well called an angel, or archangel) the personified Authority of God over home and state, without which</FONT></p>

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">an anarchy as bad as that of the Evil Authority (verse 5) might continue or recur; and who was the champion-chief who would give them peace through blood (Y. XLVI, 4; LIII, 9)? In a word, to whom, as to the coadjutors of such a leader, would the light of reason, and the true faith come to inspire and to guide them?' 12. There is but one only class of human combatants whom he would thus match against that Demon of furious Rapine (v. 6), toward whom the evil on their part at their first creation rushed as to their leader (Y. XXX, 6), and these are the saving Saoshya<I>n</I>ts, the vicegerents of the Immortals upon earth, the religious princes V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;spa, <I>G</I>&acirc;m&acirc;spa, Frashao<I>s</I>tra, and with them, as the greatest among all, he who was, with much probability, the speaker in the passage, that is, the Ratu appointed by Ahura for the kine and for men, Zarathu<I>s</I>tra Spit&acirc;ma elsewhere and later called, with hyperbole, the first tiller, warrior, and priest.</FONT></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_683"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_684">154:1</A> M<I>e</I><I>n</I>g = m&atilde;m or man; -<I>e</I><I>n</I>g is the nasalised vowel. Man is suspiciously significant here; 'mental battles' is rather advanced for the circumstances. It is, however, not impossible. The Pahlavi favours m&atilde;m (?) here; it has av&#335; li. We might even read m<I>e</I>n&acirc; on its evidence. The Pahlavi indicates the meaning 'crises' under the figure of the 'Bridge,' which was the last great crisis to every man in the eye of the earlier, as well as of the later, Faith; so also in Y. LI, 12. The 'straits of life' would be an admirable meaning; I differ with hesitation.</P>

'The one like Thee' might even, as in other cases, be only an oblique way of rendering 'Thyself;' but the expression 'with the understanding of Vohu Manah' induces me to refer the word Thw&acirc;v&atilde;s to the servant of Ahura; in this case, however, this last line must of course be drawn to verse 4, although not mechanically separated from verse 3.</P>

The Pahl. trlr. is so decided for a personal sense, that he renders gabr&acirc; n&ecirc;<I>s</I>man = man and woman. Did he suppose 'woman' to be literally (!) expressed in the text?</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_697"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_698">156:3</A> So the Pahlavi correctly indicates by its arz&ucirc;k; Ner. priyataram.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_698"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_699">156:4</A> Compare Y. LI, 7. Are the plants here mentioned as in connection with &Acirc;ramaiti in her figurative association with the earth?</P>

XXIX, 1 he renders &icirc; r&ecirc;shk&ucirc;n. The variations are probably not real; the renderings referring to some forgotten differences of text; or, as often, he may have anticipated modern freedom, and 'changed his text;' that is, rendered it as if changed to a seemingly more intelligible form; so in a throng of similar cases. This is the only rational explanation of some of his errors. (He was able to render, and has rendered, most grammatical forms in different places.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_701"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_702">156:7</A> The Pahlavi has, however, nav&icirc;d&icirc;h. Did he read vidhy&atilde;m, in itself a very possible text?</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_702"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_703">157:1</A> Compare <I>e</I>mava<I>n</I>tem a&ecirc;shem, also peres&acirc; n<I>a</I>u y&acirc; t&ocirc;i <I>e</I>hm&acirc; par<I>s</I>t&acirc;. Observe that the Pahlavi translator distinguishes the two senses of &icirc;<I>s</I>ti. In Y. XLVI, 2 he transcribes the G&acirc;thic word, the Persian rendering &#8216;hez&acirc;nah; Ner. pu<I>n</I>yalakshm&icirc;m; here, however, he has: Ka<I>d</I>&acirc;r lak, A&ucirc;harmazd, zak &icirc; <I>s</I>ap&icirc;r khvah&icirc;<I>s</I>n &icirc; kh&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;y&icirc;h.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_704"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_705">157:3</A> Ash&acirc; might certainly equal &aacute;<I>kh</I>&acirc; here (so Bartholomae) if the constant and intentional repetition of the name and idea of Asha, = the personified Order, would not have caused confusion.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_705"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_706">157:4</A> The Pahlavi translator renders a word which occupied the place of <I>g</I>avar&ocirc; by yakhsenun&icirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r&icirc;h; Ner. following as to root (freely as to form). As he, however, renders related forms elsewhere by 'living,' 'live,' our only safe conclusion is that he had a different word from <I>g</I>avar&ocirc; (<I>g</I>ivar&ocirc;) before him in his MS.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_706"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_707">157:5</A> Compare Y. XXVIII, 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_707"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_708">157:6</A> I am very far from certain that we do not seriously blunder in not following the indication of the Pahlavi here. See remarks Y. XXXII, 16.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_708"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_709">157:7</A> Or, 'let me enjoy as my own;' but m&ocirc;i is difficult. &Ucirc;<I>k</I>&atilde;m might otherwise be a first personal form in the sense of the Vedic u<I>k</I>. <A NAME="page_158"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 158</FONT></A> Bartholomae's third sing. imper. is also of course well possible; but were not the originally abnormal third singulars in -&acirc;m, duh&acirc;&acute;m <I>s</I>ay&acirc;m, vid&acirc;m, taken over from third pl. subj.

<P><A NAME="fn_709"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_710">158:1</A> Comparing v&aacute;pus; otherwise, with the Pahlavi, 'knowing the destruction (of the evil) which Voh&ucirc;man works;' see Y. XXIX, 6, where the rendering of the Pahlavi is supported by the previous verse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_710"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_711">158:2</A> Comp. Y. XLVI, 3. Kad&acirc; Mazda; fr&acirc;r<I>e</I><I>n</I>t&ecirc;*&#8212;saoshya<I>n</I>t&atilde;m khratav&ocirc;?</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_712"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_713">158:4</A> Is Soma-intoxication here referred to? And was the Haoma-worship in abeyance at the time? The Pahlavi seems to have understood 'magic' here, and in the evil sense, that is, judging from the perhaps later gloss. Aside from the gloss, however, the Pahlavi may well have been, nay, more probably was, intended to be read mad&icirc;h as = madahy&acirc;.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_713"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_714">158:5</A> As to this word, we cannot do better than follow Justi (although his work is now a score of years old). The Indian v&aacute;rpas, in the sense of deceit, has also been compared. The last Pahlavi translator was probably confused by finding this word, as so often, divided in his MS. He rendered as best he could, or rather he handed down the shattered documents, or oral teachings, of his predecessors with his own too often lame additions, the whole mass being rich in the relics of the truth.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_714"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_715">158:6</A> See verse 5.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_715"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_716">159:1</A> Ma<I>t</I> following Ash&acirc; shows that we may also have the preposition in p&ocirc;i ma<I>t</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_716"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_717">159:2</A> As &Acirc;ramaiti is here spoken of as 'having pasture,' that is, as inspiring the thrifty husbandmen who cultivate the meadows by irrigation, or drainage, she became associated herself with those meadows, and so later with the earth; see Y. XLVII, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_717"></A><A HREF="sbe31018.htm#fr_718">159:3</A> The Pahlavi sees in r&acirc;m&atilde;m enforced quiet not 'from' but 'to' the wicked; 'who shall deal the finishing blow to the wicked?'</P>
