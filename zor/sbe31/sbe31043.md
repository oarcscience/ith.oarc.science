### YASNA XXI.

#### CATECHETICAL ZAND, OR COMMENTARY UPON THE YÊNHÊ HÂTÃM <span id="fr_1151"></span>[2](#fn_1142.md).

(The YêNhê. (To that one) of beings do we offer, whose superior
(fidelity) in the sacrifice Ahura Mazda recognises by reason of the
sanctity (within him; yea, even to those female saints also do we
sacrifice) whose (superior fidelity is thus likewise known; thus) we
sacrifice to (all, to both) the males and females (of the saints)!)

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

1\. A word for the Yasna by Zarathu*s*tra, the saint. YêNhê, &c. Here
the worshipper indicates and offers the Yasna (which is the sacrificial
worship) of Mazda as by the command (or as the institution) of
Ahura <span id="fr_1152"></span>[1](#fn_1143.md). Hâtãm. Here the
worshipper offers the sacrificial worship as if with the beings who are
among those who are destined to live <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[2](#fn_1144.md). 2. Y*a*unghãm. Here he indicates and
offers the sacrificial worship of those holy females who have Âramaiti
at their head <span id="fr_1154"></span>[3](#fn_1145.md), as homage to the
Immortals. These are the three sentences which comprehend all the
Yasnian speech. (Question.) To whom is this Yasna addressed? (Answer.)
To the Bountiful Immortals (in the course of the Yasna). 3. Thereupon
spake Mazda: Salvation to this one, whosoever he may be! May the
absolute ruler Ahura grant it. (Question.) 4. Whom did He answer with
this answer? (Answer.) He answered: The state of salvation; and with
this answer, 'the state of salvation,' he answered every saint who
exists, every one who is coming into existence, and every one who shall
exist in the future. (Question. Who answered thus? Answer.) The best
One. (Question. What did He answer?) (Answer.) The best thing. (That
is,) the best One, Mazda, answered the best and the holy (answer) for
the better and the holy man. 5. We sacrifice to this piece, the YêNhê
hâtãm, the prominent and holy Ya*s*t.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[268:2](sbe31043.htm#fr_1151.md) The expressions
in this prayer were suggested by Y. LI, 22; but the Zand does not
consistently follow the thoughts in the Gâtha. T*e*m understood should
be supplied as an object for yazamaidê in connection with yêNhê, as well
as t*a*us*k*â for y*a*unghãm. In Y. LI, 22, it is, however, by no means
certain that yazâi applies to a t*e*m yêhyâ. Holding the twenty-first
verse in mind, I am obliged to refer yêhyâ to nâ spe*n*tô. Here,
however, men and women are worshipped, as it is improbable that the
'Immortals' whose names are in the feminine are meant. The prayer is in
the Gâthic dialect, and ancient metre would hardly contain so artificial
a formation. It can only be defended from the t*en*g yazâi *hv*âi*s*
nâm*e*nî*s* of Y. LI, 22.

Or did the composer of the prayer correctly render Y. LI, 22, and boldly
write his succinct words as being clear to his hearers from explanations
which are now lost? Such explanations (oral or written) as a matter of
course existed from the first. No composer fails to discuss his
productions.

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[269:1](sbe31043.htm#fr_1152.md) Referring yêNhê
to Ahura (?).

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[269:2](sbe31043.htm#fr_1153.md) Fit to live,
clean.

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[269:3](sbe31043.htm#fr_1154.md) The Ameshôspends
whose names are in the feminine; so the Zandist erroneously.
