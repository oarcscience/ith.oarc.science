### VISPARAD II <span id="fr_1411"></span>[2](#fn_1399.md).

1\. In this Zaothra with this Baresman I desire to approach the lords of
(the ritual) which are spiritual with my praise; and I desire to
approach the earthly lords (as well). And I desire to approach the lords
of the water with my praise, and the lords of the land; and I desire to
approach with my praise those chiefs which strike the wing, and those
which wander wild at large, and those of the cloven hoof, who are chiefs
of the ritual (in their turn).

2\. In this Zaothra with this Baresman I desire to approach the holy
Yearly festivals with my praise, the lords of the ritual order,
Maidhyô-zaremaya, the milk-giver, and Maidhyô-shema, the pasture-giver,
and Paiti*s*hahya, the corn-giver, and Ayâthrima the breeder, the
spender of the seed of males, Maidhyâirya, the cold, Hamaspathmaêdhaya,
the especial time for ritual duties, the holy lords of the ritual order.

3\. And in this Zaothra with this Baresman I desire to approach the
future one of the settlements with my praise, the holy lord of the

And in this Zaothra with this Baresman I desire to approach all these
chieftains of the ritual with my praise whom Ahura Mazda mentioned to
Zarathu*s*tra

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

for sacrifice and homage because of Asha Vahi*s*ta (of Righteousness the
Best).

4\. And in this Zaothra with this Baresman I desire to approach
Thee <span id="fr_1412"></span>[1](#fn_1400.md), the lord, with my praise,
Thou who art Ahura Mazda, the spiritual lord and regulator <span

and regulator of the spiritual creation\].

regulator) of the terrestrial creation, \[the lord and regulator of the
terrestrial creation\].

5\. And in this Zaothra with this Baresman I desire to approach the man
who recites the ritual rites with my praise, who is maintaining thus the
thought well thought, and the word well spoken, and the deed well done,
and Piety the bountiful, even him <span
id="fr_1414"></span>[3](#fn_1402.md) who maintains the Mãthra of the
Saoshya*n*t, by whose actions the settlements are advanced in the
righteous order.

6\. And in this Zaothra with this Baresman I desire to approach the
(yearly) Seasons with my praise, the holy lords of the ritual order, and
the Ahuna-vairya as it is recited, and Asha Vahi*s*ta when he is
lauded <span id="fr_1415"></span>[4](#fn_1403.md), and the YêNhê hâtãm, the
frequent chant of sacrifice.

7\. And in this Zaothra with this Baresman I desire to approach the
Gâtha Ahunavaiti with my praise.

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And in this
Zaothra with this Baresman I desire to worship those women with my
praise who are well-portioned <span id="fr_1416"></span>[1](#fn_1404.md),
and of good parentage, and who are stately in their growth; yea, I
desire to approach that chant in my praise which has the Alva and the
Ratu, \[for He is verily the one who has the Ahû and the Ratu, that is,
Ahura Mazda <span id="fr_1417"></span>[2](#fn_1405.md)\].

victory, Mazda-given, the holy lord of the ritual order, and the

order, and Mithra of the wide pastures, and Râman *Hv*âstra, and the

the wise.

answer), and the farm-house of the man possessed of pastures, and the
pasture produced for the Kine of blessed gift, and the holy
cattle-breeding man <span id="fr_1419"></span>[1](#fn_1407.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1399"></span>[338:2](sbe31079.htm#fr_1411.md) Visparad II
should be read after Yasna II, 8, of which it is an extension.

<span id="fn_1400"></span>[339:1](sbe31079.htm#fr_1412.md) It is certainly
not impossible that the idea of 'invoking the approach of Ahura' was
meant, but 'approaching him' is more natural.

<span id="fn_1401"></span>[339:2](sbe31079.htm#fr_1413.md) Ahûm*k*a
ratûm*k*a, applied to the same person, the usage arising from an
erroneous rendering of the Ahuna-vairya; see Y. XIX, 12.

<span id="fn_1402"></span>[339:3](sbe31079.htm#fr_1414.md) Yô, with
K7<sup>b</sup>, K11, daretem, passive form; or, 'who (has) the Mãthra
held.' The text must, however, be in disorder.

<span id="fn_1403"></span>[339:4](sbe31079.htm#fr_1415.md) In the Ashem
Vohû.

<span id="fn_1404"></span>[340:1](sbe31079.htm#fr_1416.md) So the Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_1405"></span>[340:2](sbe31079.htm#fr_1417.md) Erroneous
Pâzand.

<span id="fn_1406"></span>[340:3](sbe31079.htm#fr_1418.md) This sentence
affords support to my rendering of âyêsê, as expressing a desire to
approach, rather than one for the approach of (the Genius of) the
Mountain; at the same time the latter idea may very possibly be the
correct one. (Expressions are curtailed.)

<span id="fn_1407"></span>[341:1](sbe31079.htm#fr_1419.md) Y. II, 10
follows Visparad II, 11.
