### VISPARAD XXIII (SP. XXVI) <span id="fr_1520"></span>[3](#fn_1503.md).

1\. We worship Ahura Mazda as the best <span
id="fr_1521"></span>[4](#fn_1504) (worship to be offered in our gifts.md).
We worship the Amesha Spe*n*ta (once more, and as) the best. We worship
Asha Vahi*s*ta (who is Righteousness the Best). And we sacrifice to
those (prayers) which are evident as the best; that is, the Praises of
the Yasnas.

Also we sacrifice to that best wish, which is that of Asha Vahi*s*ta,
and we worship Heaven, which is the best world of the saints, bright and
all-glorious; and we sacrifice likewise to that best approach which
leads to <span id="fr_1522"></span>[5](#fn_1505.md) it. 2. And we sacrifice
to that reward,

health, healing, furtherance, and increase, and to that victory which is
within <span id="fr_1523"></span>[1](#fn_1506.md) the two, the Ahuna-vairya
and the Airy*e*mâ-ishyô, through the memorised recital of the good
thoughts, words, and deeds. (which they enjoin).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1503"></span>[363:3](sbe31100.htm#fr_1520.md) This piece from
the later Avesta follows Y. LIII, in the Vendîdâd Sâdah, and has
reference to its expressions.

<span id="fn_1504"></span>[363:4](sbe31100.htm#fr_1521.md) It is an
important suggestion which holds vahi*s*tem as equal to 'saying
vahi*s*tem,' in allusion to the Vahi*s*ta î*s*ti*s*; but as the word is
inflected further on (see vahi*s*tahê), and as it moreover once applies
to Asha, as Asha Vahi*s*ta, it is better to render it as having
adjective application throughout, being none the less, of course, an
intentional echo of the first word of Y. LIII, 1.

<span id="fn_1505"></span>[363:5](sbe31100.htm#fr_1522.md) Or, 'of it.'

<span id="fn_1506"></span>[364:1](sbe31100.htm#fr_1523.md) Possibly
'between them,' meaning the Gâthas which are so placed.
