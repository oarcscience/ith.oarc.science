### YASNA LVII (SP. LVI).

#### THE SRÔSH YA*S*T <span id="fr_1248"></span>[4](#fn_1238.md).

1\. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best, &c.

Propitiation be to Sraosha, Obedience the blessed, the mighty, the
incarnate word of reason, whose body is the Mãthra, him of the daring
spear, devoted to the Lord, for (his) sacrificial worship, homage,
propitiation, and praise.

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

#### I.

2\. We worship Sraosha, (Obedience) the blessed, the stately, him who
smites with the blow of victory, and who furthers the settlements, the
holy, (ruling) as the ritual lord. Him do we worship, who in <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[1](#fn_1239.md) the creation of Mazda the first adored
Ahura, with the Baresman spread, who worshipped the Bountiful
Immortals <span id="fr_1250"></span>[2](#fn_1240) (first.md), who
worshipped both the protector and the Creator, who are <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[3](#fn_1241) (both.md) creating all things in the
creation.

3\. For his splendour and his glory, for his might, and the blow which
smites with victory, I will worship him with the Yasna of the Yazads,
with a Yasna loud intoned, him Obedience the blessed, with the
consecrated waters, and the good Blessedness, the lofty, and
Nairya-sangha, the stately; and may he draw near to us to aid us, he who
smites with victory, Obedience the blessed!

4\. We worship Sraosha, Obedience the blessed, and that lofty Lord who
is Ahura Mazda Himself, Him who has attained the most to this our
ritual, Him who has approached the nearest to us in our celebrations.
And we worship all the words of Zarathu*s*tra, and all the deeds well
done (for him), both those that have been done (in times gone by),

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

and those which are yet to be done (for him in times to come).

### II.

5\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed and the stately, him who
smites with the blow of victory, who prospers the settlements, the holy
ritual lord, (6) who first spread forth the Baresman, and the three
bundles, and the five bundles, and the seven bundles, and the nine, till
it was heaped for us knee-high, and to the middle of the thighs <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[1](#fn_1242.md), for the Bountiful Immortals, for
their worship, and their homage, and their propitiation, and their
praise.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might, and the blow which
smites with victory, I will worship him with the Yasna of the Yazads,
with a Yasna loud intoned, him Obedience the blessed, with the
consecrated waters.

#### III.

7\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, the stately, who smites
with the blow of victory, who furthers the settlements, the holy ritual
chief.

8\. Who first chanted the Gâthas, the five <span
id="fr_1253"></span>[2](#fn_1243.md) Gâthas of Zarathu*s*tra, the Spitâma,
the holy (with the fashion) of their metres <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[3](#fn_1244.md), and after the well-constructed order
of their words, together with the Zand which they contain, and the
questions <span id="fr_1255"></span>[4](#fn_1245.md) which they

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

utter, and the answers which they give, for the Bountiful Immortals, for
their sacrifice and homage, their propitiation, and their praise.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

#### IV.

9\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed and the stately, who
smites with the blow of victory, and who furthers the settlements, the
holy ritual chief, (10) who for the poor among (our) men and women built
a mighty house <span id="fr_1256"></span>[1](#fn_1246.md), who after
sunset, and with his levelled battle-axe, smites Aêshema bloody wounds,
and having struck the head, casts him lightly (?) <span
id="fr_1257"></span>[2](#fn_1247) (to the earth.md), as the stronger
(smites) the weaker.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

#### V.

11\. We worship Sraosha, Obedience the blessed and the stately, him who
smites with the blow of victory, who furthers the settlements, the holy
ritual chief, as the energetic, and the swift, the strong, the daring
(and redoubted) hero, (12) who comes back from all his battles (and
comes from them) a conqueror, who amid the Bountiful Immortals sits as
companion at their meeting <span id="fr_1258"></span>[3](#fn_1248.md).

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

#### VI.

13\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, who is the strongest
and most persistent of the youths, the most energetic, and the swiftest,
who of all the youths strikes most with terror <span
id="fr_1259"></span>[1](#fn_1249) from afar (?.md). \[Be ye desirous, O ye
Mazdayasnians! of the Yasna of Obedience the blessed <span
id="fr_1260"></span>[2](#fn_1250.md).\]

14\. Far from this house, this village, and this tribe, and from this
country, the evil and destructive terrors (shall) depart. In the
dwelling of that man in whose abode Obedience the blessed, who smites
victoriously, is satisfied and welcomed, there is that holy man who thus
contents him (most) forward in the thinking better thoughts, in the
speaking truthful (ritual) words, and in the doing holy deeds <span
id="fr_1261"></span>[3](#fn_1251.md).

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

#### VII.

15\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed and the stately, who is
the conqueror of the Kayadha, and the Kâidhya, who was the smiter of the
Lie-demon of the Daêvas, the one veritably powerful, the destroyer of
the world, who is the guardian and watchman over all the migrations (?)
of the tribes.

16\. Who sleeplessly and vigilant guards the creatures of Ahura, who
sleeplessly and with vigilance

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

saves them, who with halberd raised on high guards all the corporeal
world after setting of the sun, (17) who has never slept in quiet since
the two Spirits made the worlds, \[the bounteous and the evil one <span
id="fr_1262"></span>[1](#fn_1252.md)\], who guards the homes of Asha, who
battles all (?) the days long and the nights with all the Daêvas
\[(Pâzand) the Mâzanian\], (18) nor terror-stricken does he turn in
affright before (their power); but before him all the Daêvas turn in
affright against their will, and rush to darkness is their fear.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

#### VIII.

19\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, whom Haoma worshipped
on the highest height of high Haraiti, he Haoma, the reviver <span
id="fr_1263"></span>[2](#fn_1253.md), and the healer, the beautiful, the
kingly <span id="fr_1264"></span>[3](#fn_1254), of the golden eye, (20.md)
of the gracious words <span id="fr_1265"></span>[4](#fn_1255.md), of the
warning and the guarding words, who intones our hymns on every
side <span id="fr_1266"></span>[5](#fn_1256.md), who possesses
understanding and of every brilliant form, which abounds in many an
explanation <span id="fr_1267"></span>[6](#fn_1257.md) and revelation of
the word, who has the first place in the Mãthra.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

#### IX.

21\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed,

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

whose house stands with its thousand pillars, as victorious, on the
highest height of high Haraiti, self-lighted from within, star-studded
from without, (22) to whom the Ahuna-vairya has come, the axe of
victory <span id="fr_1268"></span>[1](#fn_1258.md), and the Haptanghâiti,
and the Fshûshômãthra which smites with victory, and all the Yasna
sections.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

#### X.

23\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, by whose might and
victorious power, and wise conduct, and (full) knowledge, the Bountiful
Immortals <span id="fr_1269"></span>[2](#fn_1259.md) descend upon this
earth of seven quarters.

24\. Who as teacher of the law will stride forth upon this earth with
its dwellers in the body, and ruling as he will.

And in this Religion, Ahura Mazda has been confessed <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[3](#fn_1260.md) with faith, and the Good Mind likewise
with Him, and Righteousness the Best, and Khshathra-vairya, and Piety
the Bounteous, and the Universal Weal and Immortality; and the question
to the Lord is asked, and Mazda's lore (is written).

25\. O Sraosha (Obedience), thou blessed one, and stately! protect us
for the lives; yea, for both, (for that) of this world which is
corporeal, and for the world of mind, against unhappy <span
id="fr_1271"></span>[4](#fn_1261.md) death, and the remorseless Wrath of
rapine, against the hosts with ill-intent, who lift their bloody
spears <span id="fr_1272"></span>[5](#fn_1262.md) against us;

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

yea, against their assaults whom <span id="fr_1273"></span>[1](#fn_1263.md)
the Wrath-demon will set on, and Vîdhâtu, demon-made. 26. Therefore
may’st thou, O Sraosha, the blessed and the stately! grant swiftness to
our teams, soundness to our bodies, and abundant observation <span
id="fr_1274"></span>[2](#fn_1264.md) of our foes, and their smiting (as we
mark them), and their sudden death.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

#### XI.

27\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, whom four racers draw
in harness, white and shining, beautiful, and powerful <span
id="fr_1275"></span>[3](#fn_1265.md), quick to learn, and fleet <span
id="fr_1276"></span>[4](#fn_1266.md), obeying before speech, heeding orders
from the mind, with their hoofs of horn gold-covered, (28) fleeter than
(our) horses, swifter than the winds, more rapid than the rain(-drops as
they fall); yea, fleeter than the clouds, or well-winged birds, or the
well-shot arrow as it flies <span id="fr_1277"></span>[5](#fn_1267.md),
(29) which overtake these swift ones all, as they fly after <span
id="fr_1278"></span>[6](#fn_1268.md) them pursuing, but which are never
overtaken when they flee, which plunge away from both the weapons
(hurled on this side and on that) and draw Sraosha with them, the good
Sraosha and the blessed; which from both the weapons (those on this side
and on that) bear the good Obedience the blessed, plunging forward in
their zeal, when he takes his course from India on the East, and when he
lights down in the West.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

#### XII.

30\. We worship Obedience the blessed and the stately, who though lofty
and so high, yea, even to the girdle, yet stoops to Mazda's creatures,
(31) who thrice within the day, and three times of a night, will drive
on to that Karshvar *Hv*aniratha, called the luminous, as he holds in
both the hands <span id="fr_1279"></span>[1](#fn_1269.md) and poizes his
knife-like battle-axe, which flies as of itself, and to cleave the
Daêvas’ skulls, (32) to hew down Angra Mainyu, the wicked, and to hew
down Rapine of the bloody spear, to hew down the Daêvas of
Mazendran <span id="fr_1280"></span>[2](#fn_1270.md), and every Demon-god.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might . . . .

#### XIII.

33\. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed and the stately, him who
smites with victory, both here and not here, and on this entire earth.
And we worship all the (gifts) of Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, the
mighty, and the strong, whose body is the Mãthra.

Yea, we worship (all the martial gifts) of Sraosha (Obedience) the
mighty, both armed with shielding armour, and a warrior strong of hand,
skull-cleaver of the Daêvas, conquering the endowments <span
id="fr_1281"></span>[3](#fn_1271.md) of the conqueror, the holy conqueror
of the conqueror, and (his) victorious powers, and the Ascendency which
it bestows, and we worship

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

this Ascendency of Sraosha's (the same which conquers theirs); and that
of Ar*s*ti do we praise as well. 34. And every house by Sraosha guarded
do we worship, wherein the blessed friendly Sraosha is befriended and
made welcome, where, the holy man is far advanced (?) in holy thoughts,
and righteous words and deeds.

For his splendour and his glory, for his might, which smites with
victory, I will worship him with the Yasna of the Yazads, with a Yasna
loud-intoned, him Obedience the blessed, with the consecrated waters,
and the good Blessedness, the lofty, and Nairya-sangha, the stately, and
may he come to us to aid us, he who smites with victory, Obedience the
blessed!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1238"></span>[297:4](sbe31062.htm#fr_1248.md) As Sraosha is
the only divinity of the later groups mentioned in the first four
Gâthas, this Ya*s*t would seem to have claims to antiquity next after
the pieces in the Gâthic dialect. The name Sraosha does not appear to
have lost its meaning as an abstract quality, notwithstanding the
materialistic imagery. With Y. XXVIII, 6 in view, where Sraosha 'finds
the way' to Ahura, or 'finds His throne,' we may understand that the
worshippers, who first heard this Ya*s*t, praised listening obedience,
or repentance, as they did nearly all the remaining abstract qualities,
together with their principal prayers, and hymns themselves. The rhythm
of the original has been somewhat imitated in the rendering given, as it
is difficult to avoid doing so, and to avoid other objectionable
features at the same time.

<span id="fn_1239"></span>[298:1](sbe31062.htm#fr_1249.md) So 'tradition.'

<span id="fn_1240"></span>[298:2](sbe31062.htm#fr_1250.md) Sraosha was not
reckoned as one of the Ameshôspends at the time of the composition of
this verse.

<span id="fn_1241"></span>[298:3](sbe31062.htm#fr_1251.md) Comp. Y. XXX, 4;
but Ahura and some one of the Immortals, or possibly Zarathu*s*tra (see
Y. XLII, 2), must be meant here. Angra Mainyu could not have been
worshipped as either protector or creator. Observe the present tense.

<span id="fn_1242"></span>[299:1](sbe31062.htm#fr_1252.md) Le Barsom est de
cinq branches dans les Darouns ordinaires. Il est de sept branches pour
le Daroun No naber, pour le Freoueschi, et pour le Gâhânbâr. Il est de
neuf branches pour le Daroun des Rois, et pour celui du Mobed des Mobeds
(Anquetil).

<span id="fn_1243"></span>[299:2](sbe31062.htm#fr_1253.md) This proves that
the Gâthas were greatly older than this Ya*s*t. That the Gâthas were
originally five seems improbable; yet they had become reduced to that
number at this time.

<span id="fn_1244"></span>[299:3](sbe31062.htm#fr_1254.md) Nom. sing.?

<span id="fn_1245"></span>[299:4](sbe31062.htm#fr_1255.md) Comp. ta*t* thwâ
peresâ, &c.; 'questions back and forth.'

<span id="fn_1246"></span>[300:1](sbe31062.htm#fr_1256.md) One of the
earliest notices of the kind.

<span id="fn_1247"></span>[300:2](sbe31062.htm#fr_1257.md) Hu + angh, or
can sas = to be inactive, indicate a change?

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[300:3](sbe31062.htm#fr_1258.md) This is possibly
the origin of a later view which established Sraosha as one of the
Immortals, to fill up the number seven without including Ahura. The
original 'seven spirits' included Ahura.

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[301:1](sbe31062.htm#fr_1259.md) =
kat-tare*s*temem, comp. for form katpayâ´m.

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[301:2](sbe31062.htm#fr_1260.md) Possibly an
ancient interpolation. Repetitions are curtailed.

<span id="fn_1251"></span>[301:3](sbe31062.htm#fr_1261.md) This verse 14
may be an ancient extension of the Ya*s*t; it may of course be taken for
granted that within a certain period at a very remote time, the Ya*s*t
was altered and improved.

Verse 16 may have originally formed two sections; the formula 'we
worship,' &c. having been omitted.

<span id="fn_1252"></span>[302:1](sbe31062.htm#fr_1262.md) This seems a
gloss; its import is correct.

<span id="fn_1253"></span>[302:2](sbe31062.htm#fr_1263.md) The renovator,
as completing the progress which makes things fresh, frashôkereti.

<span id="fn_1254"></span>[302:3](sbe31062.htm#fr_1264.md) Possibly compare
soma râ´*g*an; but see the following adjective, and read as alternative
'brilliant.'

<span id="fn_1255"></span>[302:4](sbe31062.htm#fr_1265.md) Possibly 'who
excites to much speech.'

<span id="fn_1256"></span>[302:5](sbe31062.htm#fr_1266.md) Comp. pair
gaêthê, Y. XXXIV, 2.

<span id="fn_1257"></span>[302:6](sbe31062.htm#fr_1267.md) Having much
Zand.

<span id="fn_1258"></span>[303:1](sbe31062.htm#fr_1268.md) Comp. Vend. XIX,
10.

<span id="fn_1259"></span>[303:2](sbe31062.htm#fr_1269.md) They listen to
Obedience, and so descend.

<span id="fn_1260"></span>[303:3](sbe31062.htm#fr_1270.md) The meaning
'doth confess,' if correct, would show a very great degeneration from
the lore of the Gâthic period.

<span id="fn_1261"></span>[303:4](sbe31062.htm#fr_1271.md) Lit. 'evil.'

<span id="fn_1262"></span>[303:5](sbe31062.htm#fr_1272.md) Bannered spears;
spears with streamers.

<span id="fn_1263"></span>[304:1](sbe31062.htm#fr_1273.md) The hosts.

<span id="fn_1264"></span>[304:2](sbe31062.htm#fr_1274.md) So the Pahlavi
and Ner. See also Y. IX, 21.

<span id="fn_1265"></span>[304:3](sbe31062.htm#fr_1275.md) Spe*n*ta can
hardly mean 'holy' here.

<span id="fn_1266"></span>[304:4](sbe31062.htm#fr_1276.md) Âsava for
asaya(?); 'y' miswritten for 'v.' Comp. gâtava (form).

<span id="fn_1267"></span>[304:5](sbe31062.htm#fr_1277.md) Reading
anghamanay*a*u for aNhê manay*a*u; otherwise, 'swifter than one's
thought' (?).

<span id="fn_1268"></span>[304:6](sbe31062.htm#fr_1278.md) Lit. 'not those
after overtake.' Possibly 'these who all overtake those who fly with
turned backs, who are not overtaken from behind.'

<span id="fn_1269"></span>[305:1](sbe31062.htm#fr_1279.md) Snaithi*s* must
designate a two-handed weapon.

<span id="fn_1270"></span>[305:2](sbe31062.htm#fr_1280.md) Observe how far
West the word Daêva is applied; also, if Hindvô is not in a gloss in
verse 29, the fact proves that a vast geographical extent was familiar
to the writers of the Avesta.

<span id="fn_1271"></span>[305:3](sbe31062.htm#fr_1281.md) Vanaitî*s*, fem.
as vîsp*a*u refers to attributes celebrated in the Ya*s*t.
