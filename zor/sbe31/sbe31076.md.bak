### YASNA LXXI (SP. LXX).

#### THE YASNA CONCLUDING.

1\. Frashao*s*tra, the holy, asked the saintly Zarathu*s*tra: Answer me,
O thou most eminent Zarathu*s*tra, what is (in very truth) the memorised
recital of the rites?

What is the completed delivery of the Gâthas <span
id="fr_1376"></span>[1](#fn_1365.md)? 2. Upon this Zarathu*s*tra said: (It
is as follows.) We worship Ahura Mazda with our sacrifice (as) the holy
lord of the ritual order; and we sacrifice to Zarathustra likewise as to
a holy lord of the ritual order; and we sacrifice also to the Fravashi
of Zarathu*s*tra, the saint. And we sacrifice to the Bountiful
Immortals, (the guardians <span id="fr_1377"></span>[2](#fn_1366).md) of
the saints. 3. And we sacrifice to (all) the good heroic and bounteous
Fravashis of the saints, of the bodily (world on earth), and of the
mental (those in Heaven). And we worship that one of ritual lords who
attains the most his ends; and we sacrifice to that one of the Yazads,
lords of the ritual order, who is the most strenuous, who gains the
most, who reaches most to what he seeks, even that well-timed Prayer
which is the prayer of that holy ritual lord, and which has approached
the nearest (to us for our help).

4\. We sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

the ritual order, and we worship His entire body <span
id="fr_1378"></span>[1](#fn_1367.md), and we worship the Bountiful
Immortals all; and we worship all the ritual lords. And we sacrifice to
the entire Mazdayasnian Faith. And we worship all the sacred metres.

5\. And we worship the entire bounteous Mãthra, even the entire system
of the Faith set up against the Daêvas; and we worship its complete and
long descent. And we sacrifice to all the holy Yazads, heavenly and
earthly; and we worship all the good, heroic, and bountiful Fravashis of
the saints. 6. And we worship all the holy creatures which Mazda
created, and which possess the holy institutions <span
id="fr_1379"></span>[2](#fn_1368.md), which were established holy in their
nature <span id="fr_1380"></span>[3](#fn_1369.md), which possess the holy
lore, and the holy sacrifice, which are holy, and for the holy, and to
be worshipped by the holy. And we worship all the five <span
id="fr_1381"></span>[4](#fn_1370.md) Gâthas, the holy ones, and the entire
Yasna \[its flow and its ebb <span id="fr_1382"></span>[5](#fn_1371.md),
and the sounding (of its chants)\]. 7. And we sacrifice to all the
Praises of the Yasna, and to all the words which Mazda spake, which are
the most fatal to evil thoughts, and words, and deeds; (8) and which
designate <span id="fr_1383"></span>[6](#fn_1372.md) the evil thought, and
word, and deed, and which then cut down and fell every evil thought, and
word, and deed. \[(Pâzand.) One would think of it as

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

when the fire cuts, sucks out, and consumes the dry wood which has been
sanctified and carefully selected (for its flame).\] And we sacrifice to
the strength, the victory, the glory, and the speed of all these words
(as they go forth for their work). 9. And we sacrifice to all the
springs of water, and to the water-streams as well, and to growing
plants, and forest-trees <span id="fr_1384"></span>[1](#fn_1373.md), and to
the entire land and heaven, and to all the stars, and to the moon and
sun, even to all the lights without beginning (to their course) <span
id="fr_1385"></span>[2](#fn_1374.md). And we sacrifice to all cattle, and
to the aquatic beasts, and to the beasts that live on land, and to all
that strike the wing, and to the beasts that roam the plains, and to
those of cloven hoof. 10. And to all Thy good and holy female
(creatures) in the creation do we sacrifice, (O Thou who art) Ahura
Mazda <span id="fr_1386"></span>[3](#fn_1375.md) the skilful maker! on
account of which Thou hast made many things and good things (in Thy
world). And we sacrifice to those male creatures in the creation which
are Thine and which are meet for sacrifice because of Asha Vahi*s*ta (of
Righteousness the Best). And we sacrifice to all the mountains brilliant
with holiness, and to all the lakes which Mazda created, and to all
fires. And we sacrifice to all the truthful and correctly spoken words,
(11) even those which have both rewards and Piety within them. Yea, we
worship (you) for protection and shielding, for guarding and watching;
and may ye be to me for preparation.

I call upon the Gâthas here, the bountiful holy ones,

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

ruling in the ritual order; yea, we sacrifice to you, (O ye Gâthas!) for
protection and shielding, for guarding and watching. Mine may ye be as a
preparation. For me, for (mine) own soul I call on (you) <span
id="fr_1387"></span>[1](#fn_1376), and we would worship (you.md) for
protection and for shielding, for guarding and for watching. 12. And we
sacrifice to Weal, the complete welfare, holy and ruling in its course
in the ritual order; and we sacrifice to Deathlessness (the immortal
being of the good), holy, and ruling in the ritual order. And we
sacrifice to the question of the Lord, and to His lore, the holy chiefs,
and to the heroic Haptanghâiti, the holy lord of the ritual order. 13.
(Frasha.) Let the holy Zarathu*s*tra himself seek out a friend and a
protector. And I say <span id="fr_1388"></span>[2](#fn_1377.md) to thee (O
Zarathu*s*tra!) to make to thee a friend holy beyond the holy, and truer
than the true, for that is the better thing; for he is evil who is the
best to the evil, and he is holy to whom the holy is a friend <span
id="fr_1389"></span>[3](#fn_1378), (14.md) for these are the best of words,
those which Ahura Mazda spoke to Zarathu*s*tra.

And <span id="fr_1390"></span>[4](#fn_1379.md) do thou, O Zarathu*s*tra!
pronounce these words at the last ending of (thy) life. 15. For if, O
Zarathu*s*tra! thou shalt pronounce these words at the last ending of
(thy) life I, Ahura Mazda, will keep your soul away from Hell. Yea, so
far away shall I hold it as is the breadth and extension of the earth
\[(Pâzand) and the earth is as wide as it is long\].

16\. As thou dost desire, O holy (one)! so shalt thou be, holy shalt
thou cause (thy) soul to pass over

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

the *K*inva*t* Bridge; holy shalt thou come into Heaven. Thou shalt
intone the Gâtha U*s*tavaiti, reciting the salvation hail <span
id="fr_1391"></span>[1](#fn_1380.md).

17\. We sacrifice to the active man, and to the man of good intent, for
the hindrance of darkness, of wasting of the strength and life, and of
distraction. And we sacrifice to health and healing, to progress and to
growth, for the hindrance of impurity, and of the diseases of the
skin <span id="fr_1392"></span>[2](#fn_1381.md).

18\. And we sacrifice to the (Yasna's) ending words, to those which end
the Gâthas. And we sacrifice to the bounteous Hymns themselves which
rule in the ritual course, the holy ones.

And we sacrifice to the Praise-songs of the Yasna which were the
products of the world of yore; yea, we sacrifice to all the
Staota-Yêsnya hymns. And we sacrifice to (our) own soul and to (our)
Fravashi. 19-21. (See Y. VI, 14-16.) 22. I praise, invoke, and I weave
my song to the good, heroic, bountiful Fravashis of the saints, to those
of the house, and of the village, the district and the province, and to
those of the Zarathu*s*trôtemas. 23. And we sacrifice to the Fire, Ahura
Mazda's son, the holy ritual chief.

And we sacrifice to this Baresman having the Zaothra with it, and its
girdle with it, and spread with sanctity, the holy ritual chief. And we
sacrifice to Apãm-napâ*t*, and to Nairya-sangha, and to that Yazad, the
wise man's swift Curse.

And we sacrifice to the souls of the dead, \[which are the Fravashis of
the saints\]. 24. And we sacrifice to that lofty Lord who is Ahura Mazda
Himself.

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

25\. And we pray (again) for the Kine (once more) with these gifts and
(ceremonial) actions which are the best <span
id="fr_1393"></span>[1](#fn_1382). 26-28. (See Y. VIII, 5-7..md) 29-31.
(See Y. LX, II-13.)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1365"></span>[327:1](sbe31076.htm#fr_1376.md) This, while very
ancient as regards us, is of course not genuine in its present shape. It
was doubtless composed long after Frashao*s*tra and Zarathu*s*tra had
ceased to live. It may be, however, an expansion of an earlier document.

<span id="fn_1366"></span>[327:2](sbe31076.htm#fr_1377.md) 'The Amesha
Spe*n*ta of the holy ones.'

<span id="fn_1367"></span>[328:1](sbe31076.htm#fr_1378.md) The heavenly
bodies are thus termed elsewhere, and the sun is called his eye. <span
id="img_32800"></span> ![](img/32800.jpg) written for <span
id="img_32801"></span> ![](img/32801.jpg).

<span id="fn_1368"></span>[328:2](sbe31076.htm#fr_1379.md) Possibly, 'were
created pure.'

<span id="fn_1369"></span>[328:3](sbe31076.htm#fr_1380.md) 'Shaped holy.'

<span id="fn_1370"></span>[328:4](sbe31076.htm#fr_1381.md) Or, 'are
worshipped as holy,' vahmya*k*a, or yêsnya*k*a.

<span id="fn_1371"></span>[328:5](sbe31076.htm#fr_1382.md) This figure is
too advanced to be probable. The text has been disturbed. The words
describe the waters elsewhere.

<span id="fn_1372"></span>[328:6](sbe31076.htm#fr_1383.md) So with the
Pahlavi, referring the word to the third kar, the root of khratu,
passive (?) form, with active sense. It also, however, not impossibly
might mean 'cut around,' preparatory to felling.

<span id="fn_1373"></span>[329:1](sbe31076.htm#fr_1384.md) Elsewhere
rendered 'stems.'

<span id="fn_1374"></span>[329:2](sbe31076.htm#fr_1385.md) Not determined
like the course of a planet.

<span id="fn_1375"></span>[329:3](sbe31076.htm#fr_1386.md) We should expect
the vocative after 'Thy.'

<span id="fn_1376"></span>[330:1](sbe31076.htm#fr_1387.md) Or, 'I would
invoke (mine) own soul;' see verse 18.

<span id="fn_1377"></span>[330:2](sbe31076.htm#fr_1388.md) Possibly the
rejoinder of Frashao*s*tra, or these are 'the best words' referred to in
verse 14; but the section is a dialogue.

<span id="fn_1378"></span>[330:3](sbe31076.htm#fr_1389.md) Y. XLVI, 6.

<span id="fn_1379"></span>[330:4](sbe31076.htm#fr_1390.md) Ahura speaks.

<span id="fn_1380"></span>[331:1](sbe31076.htm#fr_1391.md) Y. XLIII, 1
follows.

<span id="fn_1381"></span>[331:2](sbe31076.htm#fr_1392.md) Diseases arising
from filth.

<span id="fn_1382"></span>[332:1](sbe31076.htm#fr_1393.md) See Y. XXXV, 4;
Y. XLVIII, 6.
