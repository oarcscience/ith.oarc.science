### YASNA XLVI.

#### PERSONAL SUFFERINGS, HOPES, AND APPEALS.

In treating this most valuable section, we can as usual presuppose that
the several verses were not originally composed in the order in which
they now appear. Verses 1-3 seem like a cry 'from the depths.' In verse
4 animosity appears; and an appeal to the energy of some of his warlike
adherents seems to prove that, with verses 5 and 6, the composer
addressed it to an assembly; 7-10 are questions and appeals to Ahura,
but, as a matter of course, they are none the less really intended to
impress the hearers, as well as to animate the mind of the reciter.
Verses 11 and 12 were again intended to be delivered to adherents.

Verse 13 is addressed to them in terms. Verse 14 would be regarded by
some as little suited to the connection, and the rest seem spoken to an
assembly of chiefs. However different they may be as to the particular
time or circumstances of their origin, they are in general so
homogeneous even as to pitch of intensity, that, with a little exercise
of the mind, we can as usual see the reasons why they were put together,
or were consecutively composed; and in poetic diction sudden changes
neither displease nor surprise us. 1. Beyond a doubt the leading prophet
is the figure in the first and second verses; and those verses are so
free from imagery that we hold them as describing beyond any reasonable

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

question, together with many other passages in the Gâthas, the
afflictions and discouragements of Zarathu*s*tra himself. He knows not
whither to turn, although he speaks as a public person and in command of
forces which are scanty indeed (verse 2), but yet still able to take the
field (Y. XLIV, 15, 16); and his movements also concern large districts
('lands'). He is not driven from his house, but from his country. It is
superfluous to say that religion, although blended with a natural
ambition, is his leading motive. How he shall satisfy Ahura is the one
problem which he aims to solve; but his case at this particular juncture
shows every discouragement.

2\. Not supposing that his yâ = yéna is merely lost in the meaning
'that,' we see that in relieving his burdened mind he exclaims, not that
he knows that he is poor in means and troops, but that he knows why it
is thus. It is the dregva*n*t's work, whom we may also well understand
as the drugva*n*t, the accursed enemy, who holds back (verse 4) the
bearers of the Holy Order from all success in their efforts to gain a
righteous livelihood from the favoured cattle culture (Y. XXIX, 2), and
who, as he with grief long since foresaw, should he attain to power,
would deliver up home, village, district, and province to ruin and death
(Y. XXXI, 18). He therefore cries to Ahura in common with the Kine
herself (Y. XXIX, 9), and his behold' is only a changed expression for
her exclamations (Y. XXIX, x).

As a friend, he would have the good Mazda to regard him as seeking an
especial form of grace; and he would beseech Him to fill up his need (Y.
XXVIII, 11) in his extremity, teaching him, not the value of flocks and
followers alone, but of that î*s*ti which lay deeper than the material
wealth which he yet lamented, even the blessings of the Holy Order in
every home. 3. And therefore he continues: Teach me and tell me of those
great thoughts, the khratavô, the salvation-schemes of the Saviours,
elsewhere also spoken of as the khratu of life (Y. XXXII, 9); for these
saving helpers would, through a severe conflict and after many a
reverse, at last bring on 'Completed Progress.'

4\. But he must arouse himself from the relief and indulgence of his
grief, he therefore springs to action, and with a cry which we hear
elsewhere (Y. LIII, 9), and which was in all probability often uttered
in hymns now lost to us, he urges the reward for the chief, who at the
head of his retainers, shall expel the world-destroyer, the du*s*sasti
(Y. XLV, 1), from power and from life. And what is that reward? It seems
to be merely the recognition and confirmation of merit among the
faithful. The man who shall

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

expel, or destroy, the heretical tyrant shall be eminent in the
recognition of his services in the support of the people and their
sacred agricultural civilisation.

That was to be reward enough, and even that prestige (pourvatâtem) was
to be given back to God in offering for still further service (Y.
XXXIII, 14).

5\. And every righteous official is urged to repeat the proclamation as
a warning to every polluted Daêva-worshipper whom he can discover, or to
whom his voice can reach, as well as to those secret adherents who would
seem to need encouragement. The charged official is to assail the
destructive opponent (Y. XXXII, 6-8), only after careful discrimination.
He is to approach the evil chief, the hostile *hv*aêtu (of the blood),
as distinct from the inferior noble, or the peasant clansman, and he is
to tell him fully of the price set on his head. 6. 'And the
superintendent who has the power, and does not thus carry out these
instructions, shall himself be delivered over to the bonds of that
Lie-demon whom the evil "kinsman" serves. For there is no compromise in
the dualistic moral creed. The man who favours the evil is as the evil,
and the friend of the good is as the good himself; so had the Lord
ordained.'

7\. Then, as so often elsewhere, he turns his thoughts to the outward
emblem as the sign of inward grace, the sacramental Fire without which
the masses would have had no help to fix the eye, or draw prostrations,
and he asks with the question of profound devotion: Whom have they (Thy
Saoshya*n*ts, verse 3) set me, as strengthener in these storms, save
Thee and Thy symbolic flames? Yet even here he names the Good Mind with
them, and the Order.

8\. 'But,' he continues, 'may he who would destroy my settlement find
every influence and power combined to form his ruin; may all things keep
him back from prosperity, and may nothing keep him back from harm.'

9\. He calls, then, for a leading helper who may help him magnify Ahura,
not merely in religious celebrations, but in that universal advance of
the sacred 'cause,' which follows Ahura's 'conciliation' (verse 1).

10\. As if to hinder the discouragement of those who hear his own
unburdenings of grief, he declares that he will never leave the faithful
few who follow him; he will go with them to the 'dread assize' itself,
as if to help them pass the last of tests.

11\. But the 'wicked,' open or concealed, should not share these hopes;
their conscience, ever the remorseless executioner, shall curse them, as
they try to pass the Judgment Bridge; and hurled

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

from that narrow path (it becomes narrow to the faithless), they shall
fall to 'eternal' Hell.

12\. Their destruction is not, however, yet decided; there is not only
hope for the tribesmen of Ahura, but for the pagan, and not for the
'alien' only, but for the Turanian enemy, whose very name had been a
synonym for suffering. If these even shall repent, they may be blest;
and some had already turned. The converted tribe Fryâna offered many
pious proselytes. These would help on the righteous order together with
the holy people, and God would dwell with them as well.

13\. Rhetorically referring to himself as in the third person, or else
representing some second speaker who names his name, he can still offer
his reward to any prince who will yet come up with his retainers to his
cause, not kept back by the many refusals which he had met (verse 1),
nor discouraged by the scant numbers of his bands; and that reward is
one which might yet be efficacious to induce self-sacrificing succour,
for in addition to what had been said (see verse 4) he could declare
spiritual life from Ahura to be the portion of every faithful follower,
and with it future temporal wealth. And he should declare this true
recruit the good mate' in the service, the first helper (verse 9) of the
tribes.

54\. Here we have what seems a question conceived as uttered by some one
in the throng, or else simply rhetorically thrown in: 'Who is that
friend, that powerful coadjutor who is thus offered this reward, and for
such a service?' Zarathu*s*tra names the king. But he diverts the minds
of hearers from a pernicious trust in individuals.

He would appeal, so he implies, not to one man only, although that one
be Vî*s*tâspa, the heroic, but to all whom Ahura would recognise in His
assembly, through the inspired suffrage of the mass.

15\. And first he addresses the group made up chiefly of his family, the
Spitâmas; they were, as he implied, enlightened in the sacred lore, and
among the foremost therefore of the Ar(e)dra. 16. He then calls on
Frashao*s*tra, with the Hvôgvas, exhorting all to continue in their
righteous course, in harmony with those whom they wish for as Saviours
for the land, assuring them that they will reach at last that sacred
scene where the 'Immortals' dwell with God. 17. 'That scene,' he further
adds, 'where the faithful sing their praises in perfection, using the
true metres' (as sacred as the Vedic). And he declares that Ahura, who
discerns the truth infallibly, will heed and answer; for the praises
sung there will be those of obedient men who offer to the cause. 18. He
once

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

more holds out his spiritual rewards as the best gifts of the inspired
revelation, threatening as usual commensurate visitation upon the
oppressing clans, while both promises and threats are in harmony with
Ahura's will, for that alone has been his guide in every statement. 19.
After all complaints, and threats, and stern injunctions, he closes with
the once more repeated word 'reward,' and that for every man who shall
aid in 'his great affair' (Y. XXX, 2), and he appeals to God Himself,
asserting His inspiration for all that he has said.

Translation.

1\. To what land to turn <span id="fr_603"></span>[1](#fn_602.md); aye,
whither turning shall I go? On the part of <span
id="fr_604"></span>[2](#fn_603) a kinsman (prince.md), or allied peer,
none, to conciliate, give <span id="fr_605"></span>[3](#fn_604.md)
(offerings) to me (to help my cause), nor yet the throngs of labour,
(not) even such as these <span id="fr_606"></span>[4](#fn_605.md), nor yet
(still less) the evil

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

tyrants of the province. How then shall I (establish well the Faith, and
thus) conciliate Thy (grace), O Lord?

2\. This know I, Mazda! wherefore I am thus unable to attain my
wish <span id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_606.md), and why my flocks are so
reduced in number, and why my following is likewise scant. Therefore I
cry to Thee; behold it, Lord! desiring helpful grace for me, as friend
bestows on friend. (Therefore to meet my spirit's need, and this as
well) declare and teach <span id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_607.md) to me the
Good Mind's wealth.

3\. When come, Great Giver! they who are the day's enlighteners <span
id="fr_609"></span>[3](#fn_608.md), to hold the Righteous Order of the
world upright, and forward pressing? When are

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

the schemes of the saviour Saoshya*n*ts with (their) lofty revelations
(to appear)? To whom for help does he (their chief) approach, who has
Thy Good Mind (as his fellow-worker <span
id="fr_610"></span>[1](#fn_609).md)? Thee, for mine exhorter and commander,
Living Lord! I choose.

4\. (But e’er these helpers come to me, all rests as yet in gloom.) The
evil man is holding back <span id="fr_611"></span>[2](#fn_610.md) those who
are the bearers of the Righteous Order from progress <span
id="fr_612"></span>[3](#fn_611.md) with the Kine, (from progress with the
sacred cause) within the region, or the province <span
id="fr_613"></span>[4](#fn_612.md), he, the evil governor, endowed with
evil might <span id="fr_614"></span>[5](#fn_613.md), consuming <span
id="fr_615"></span>[6](#fn_614.md) life with evil deeds. Wherefore, whoever
hurls him from his power, O Mazda! or from life, stores for the Kine in
sacred wisdom shall he make <span id="fr_616"></span>[7](#fn_615.md).

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

5\. (Yea), he who, as ruler, treats no coming applicant with
injury <span id="fr_617"></span>[1](#fn_616.md), as a good citizen (or
nobly wise) in sacred vow and duty, and living righteously in every
covenant, who, as an uncorrupted judge, discerns the wicked (that leader
who, rejecting me, would keep back those who propagate the Faith), let
him, (this righteous judge,) declare (the vengeance) to that
(hostile <span id="fr_618"></span>[2](#fn_617)) lord, (my.md) kinsman. Yea,
let him crush him when he sallies forth <span
id="fr_619"></span>[3](#fn_618) (to approach us for our harm.md)!

6\. (And he who leaves him in his guilty error has my curse.) Yea, he
who has the power <span id="fr_620"></span>[4](#fn_619.md), and will not
thus (with stern reproof <span id="fr_621"></span>[5](#fn_620).md) approach
him, shall go to

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

the abode of the Lie, (and) the enchainer <span
id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_621.md). For he is evil who is the best one to
the evil, and he is holy who is friendly to the righteous, as Thou didst
fix the moral laws <span id="fr_623"></span>[2](#fn_622.md), O Lord!

7\. Whom, then, as guard, O Mazda! hast Thou <span
id="fr_624"></span>[3](#fn_623.md) set me <span
id="fr_625"></span>[4](#fn_624.md) then when that wicked one still
held <span id="fr_626"></span>[5](#fn_625) me for his hate? Whom (had I.md)
then but Thee, Thy Fire and Mind, Ahura! by deeds performed in which Thy
Righteous rule is saved and nurtured? Therefore that spiritual
power <span id="fr_627"></span>[6](#fn_626) (vouchsafing me.md) for the
(holy) Faith (its truths) declare.

8\. And as to him who (now by evil power) delivers up my settlements to
harm, let not his burning (wrath) in deeds attain <span
id="fr_628"></span>[7](#fn_627.md) me. But bearing back <span
id="fr_629"></span>[8](#fn_628.md) the (evil will and evil influence of
such), let these things come (back) to him in anger. Let that to his
body come which holds from <span id="fr_630"></span>[9](#fn_629.md)
welfare; but let no (help)

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

at all (approach him, which may) keep him back from misery. (And let
this happen as I speak) from (vengeful) hate, O Lord!

9\. But who is the freely helping one who will teach me foremost <span
id="fr_631"></span>[1](#fn_630.md) how we may adore Thee, Thou the well to
be invoked <span id="fr_632"></span>[2](#fn_631.md) as in Thy deeds, the
holy <span id="fr_633"></span>[3](#fn_632.md), bountiful Ahura? What
(words) the Kine's creator <span id="fr_634"></span>[4](#fn_633.md) spake
for Thee by aid of, and to aid, the Righteous ritual Order, these words
of Thine, (Thy people coming) with Thy Good Mind, are seeking <span
id="fr_635"></span>[5](#fn_634) now (to gain and learn from.md) me <span
id="fr_636"></span>[6](#fn_635.md), O Mazda Lord!

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

10\. Whoever, man or woman, shall give to me those (gifts) of life which
Thou hast known <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_636.md) as best, O Mazda!
and as a holy blessing through (Thy) Righteous Order, a throne
(established) with (Thy) Good Mind, (with these I shall go forth; yea,
those) whom I shall (accompany and so) incite <span
id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_637.md), to the homage of such as You <span
id="fr_639"></span>[3](#fn_638) (on earth.md), forth to the Judge's Bridge
(itself) with all of them shall I lead on <span
id="fr_640"></span>[4](#fn_639) (at last.md).

11\. (And they and I have every need for help, for now) the Karpan and
the Kavi will join in governments <span id="fr_641"></span>[5](#fn_640.md)
to slay the life of man with evil deeds, they whom their own souls and
their own conscience will becry <span id="fr_642"></span>[6](#fn_641.md).
And when they approach there where the Judge's Bridge (extends, unlike
the believing ones of God, who go so firmly forth with me as guide and
helper, these shall miss their path and fall <span
id="fr_643"></span>[7](#fn_642).md), and

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

in the Lie's abode for ever shall their habitation <span
id="fr_644"></span>[1](#fn_643.md) be.

12\. (But for the penitent there is yet hope; for all our former foes
shall not thus fall, as from the *K*inva*t* Bridge to woe, for) when
from among the tribes and kith of the Turanian, even among the more
powerful ones of the Fryâna, those shall arise <span
id="fr_645"></span>[2](#fn_644.md) who further on the settlements of Piety
with energy and zeal, with these shall Ahura dwell together through His
Good Mind (in them), and to them for joyful grace deliver His
commands <span id="fr_646"></span>[3](#fn_645.md).

13\. Yea, he who will propitiate Zarathu*s*tra Spitâma <span
id="fr_647"></span>[4](#fn_646.md) with gifts midst men, this man is fitted
for the proclamation, and to him Ahura Mazda will give the (prospered)
life. And he will likewise cause the settlements to thrive in mental
goodness. We think <span id="fr_648"></span>[5](#fn_647.md) him, therefore,
Your good companion to (further and maintain) Your Righteousness (and
meet for Your approach).

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

(A voice from among the Chiefs.)

14\. (But where is such an one?) Whom hast thou Zarathu*s*tra <span
id="fr_649"></span>[1](#fn_648.md)! thus a holy friend for the great
(effort of the) cause? Who is it who thus desires to speak it forth?
(Zarathu*s*tra answers. Aye, such an one  have.) It is our Kavi
Vî*s*tâspa <span id="fr_650"></span>[2](#fn_649.md), the heroic; (and not
he alone, but all) whom thou shalt (as in Thy prophet) meet <span
id="fr_651"></span>[3](#fn_650.md) in the assembly, O Ahura Mazda! these
likewise will I call (to my attempt), and with Thy Good Mind's words.

15\. O ye Haê*k*a*t*-aspas, Spitâmas! to you will I now address my
words, since ye discern the things unlawful, and the lawful, for these
your actions to establish <span id="fr_652"></span>[4](#fn_651.md) (firmly
on its base) for you the Righteous Order through those which are the
Lord's primeval laws.

16\. (And to the Hvôgvas would I likewise speak.) Thou Frashao*s*tra
Hvôgva (whom I see) <span id="fr_653"></span>[5](#fn_652.md); go thou

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (forth) with the
generous helpers <span id="fr_654"></span>[1](#fn_653.md), with those whom
we are praying for as for salvation to the land. Go thou where Piety
joins hand in hand with the Righteous Order, where are the wished-for
Realms of Good Mind, where Mazda in His most honoured <span
id="fr_655"></span>[2](#fn_654.md) home abides,

17\. Where in your measured verse <span id="fr_656"></span>[3](#fn_655.md)
I will declare aloud (the praises), not in unmeasured lines, *G*âmâspa
Hvôgva! but songs of homage (will I weave) with ever gained Obedience in
offering. (And unto Mazda) will I chant them, yea, to Him who will
discern aright what things are lawful (or) unlawful <span
id="fr_657"></span>[4](#fn_656) (which I thus do, or utter.md), and with
His wonder-working thoughts <span id="fr_658"></span>[5](#fn_657.md) of
Righteousness (attend).

18\. (For) whosoever (offers) sanctity <span
id="fr_659"></span>[6](#fn_658.md) to me, to him shall be the best gifts
whatsoever. Yea, of my

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (spirit's) wealth
will I bestow on him through Thy Good Mind (which I give), but
oppressions will I send on him who as oppressor will deliver us to
anguish, O Mazda! desiring, as I do, to satisfy Your choice by righteous
(vengeance). This is the decision of mine understanding and my will.

19\. (Yea, this I earnestly announce.) He who from Righteousness (in
mind and life) shall verily perform for me, for Zarathu*s*tra, that
which is thus most helpful (for my cause) according to my earnest wish
(and through my words of urgent zeal) on him shall they bestow reward(s)
beyond this earth, with all the mental <span
id="fr_660"></span>[1](#fn_659.md) blessings gained through the sacred
mother-kine <span id="fr_661"></span>[2](#fn_660.md). And these things
(all) did’st Thou (Thyself) command to me, O Mazda, Thou most wise <span
id="fr_662"></span>[3](#fn_661.md)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_602"></span>[134:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_603.md) The Pahlavi
translator sees the usual meaning in nemôi and nemô. He also accepts kãm
zãm adverbially after the constant Greek usage. 'In what land shall I
establish my religion (as it is here rejected); whither with my praises
(of the true God) shall I go?' The rendering is so much richer that I
turn from it with great reluctance.

<span id="fn_603"></span>[134:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_604.md) It is to be
regretted that able scholars should so hastily change the Gâthic text
here without first trying to render it as it is. This is all the more
necessary, as each independent writer disputes emendations. Pairî I
think ought to stand. The *hv*aêtu, airyaman, and verez*e*nem are also
elsewhere alluded to, as appertaining to the hostile party sometimes,
and therefore not among those from among whom (parâ?) the prophet would
be expelled.

<span id="fn_604"></span>[134:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_605.md) Dadaitî as a third
plural has long been suggested with the eagerness of discovery. Its
subjects would then be khshnâu*s*, and that implied in yâ verez*e*nâ.
But the construction is difficult thus, and it may be greatly doubted
whether we had not better alter our discovery back into the singular
with the Pahlavi. I am greatly confirmed in my view of the grammatical
form of khshnâu*s* by Bartholomae's decision for a nominal form.
Otherwise it would be a third singular, with loss of the final dental.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[134:4](sbe31016.htm#fr_606.md) H*ek*â seems to be
an irregular form (see Y. LVIII, 4). I can <span id="page_135">p.
135</span> only make an exclamatory isque = talisque of it. The Pahlavi
renders freely as if some form of hi = to bind were before him (recall
hôi*s*?), or perhaps he read ha*k*â, rendering as = these all together,
hamsâyaki*k*; Ner. ye sva*s*re*n*ayo.

<span id="fn_606"></span>[135:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_607.md) So the Kine
complained of him in Y. XXIX, 9 as anaêsha; so also the Pahlavi,
explaining akhvâstar \[aîgham denman atûbânîkîh maman râî khavîtûnam\].
He proceeds li amat kam ramak va amati*k* kam-gabrâ hômanam, explaining
anaêshô as not being an îshâ-khshathra. Mâ = smâ notwithstanding
position (?).

<span id="fn_607"></span>[135:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_608.md) 'Nim wahr' has
long since circulated as a rendering for âkhsô; and with î*s*tîm in the
sense of 'prayer,' it has afforded the admirable sense 'observe, take
heed of the desire of the pious.' But we have a positive proof of the
meaning 'teach,' 'declare' for khsa; see Y. LXV, 9 (Wg.). So also in Y.
XXVIII, 5. That Ahura possessed an î*s*ti is clear from Y. XXXIV, 5. And
if the sage could ask, 'What is your î*s*ti (wealth)? what is your
kingdom (power over possessions)?' it is certainly not strained to
suppose that he could say here; 'tell me concerning your wealth,'
especially as he bewails his poverty. Î*s*ti is in antithesis to the
idea expressed in kamnafshvâ and kamnânâ. So also the Pahlavi as
translated by the Persian ‘hezânah.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[135:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_609.md) Ukshâno would seem
to be an ancient error for ushâno, as the Pahlavi translator renders as
if reading ushâ in Y. L, 10, and <span id="page_136">p. 136</span> not
ukhshâ. Otherwise 'increasers of the days' is a fine expression, but
suspicious in view of the Pahlavi rendering in Y. L, 10. Ner.'s
\*vikâ*s*ayitryo (sic) is striking, but I cannot claim for it all that
it seems to offer, as Ner. elsewhere renders forms of vakhsh by those of
kas. The Persian follows the Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_609"></span>[136:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_610.md) Comp. Y. XLIV, 1.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[136:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_611.md) Pa in the sense of
'keeping back from welfare' as well as in that of 'protection,' a sense
first taught us by the Pahlavi writers, is now at last generally
acknowledged. It now, like many other suggestions of the Pahlavi,
actually casts light in the rendering of the analogous Vedic word.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[136:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_612.md) So the mass of
MSS. with the Pahl. min fravâmi*s*nŏ; Persian az raftan. The expression
might refer to the 'going of the kine,' as representing the people in
her 'path.'

<span id="fn_612"></span>[136:4](sbe31016.htm#fr_613.md) Comp. Y. XXXI, 18.

<span id="fn_613"></span>[136:5](sbe31016.htm#fr_614.md) Pahl. zak î pavan
dû*s*-stahamak; Ner. dush*t*o balâtkârî. The elements seem to be du*z* +
hazô + bâo(= vâo).

<span id="fn_614"></span>[136:6](sbe31016.htm#fr_615.md) Ush in Iranian
seems to have the sense of destruction combined with it sometimes; hence
aoshah, aoshi*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[136:7](sbe31016.htm#fr_616.md) *K*ar can well
mean 'attain to.' Pathm*en*g as = paths (so I formerly rendered) gives a
far feebler sense than that indicated by the first Zendist, the Pahlavi
writer. The 'wisdom' of preparing stores for the kine, even if we
suppose an animal only to be meant; <span id="page_137">p. 137</span> is
obvious. The Iranian winter was something very different from that in
India. But the kine is not alluded to without a certain figurative
meaning: she represents the people, and as such she cried aloud; and
Zarathu*s*tra received the commission to relieve her sufferings as such.
That the word hu*k*i*s*tôi*s* stands in the genitive should not disturb
us. The 'care for the kine' was a matter of national importance, and
'wisdom' could not better be exercised than in this direction.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[137:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_617.md) Or we may render
'he who as ruler does not bestow favours upon him who approaches with
injury.' The hint of the Pahlavi favours this.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[137:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_618.md) *Hv*aêtavê is
here, as in Y. XXXIII, 4; Y. XXXII, 1, and the first verse of this
chapter, the hostile chieftain called 'kinsman' in an aristocratic sense
by Zarathu*s*tra and his group.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[137:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_619.md) I compare
uzûithy*a*us*k*a which is used of the breaking forth of water. The
Pahlavi translator seems to have had some such idea 'mûn lâlâ
hen*g*î*d*ŏ,' but with him the entire line, which divides all writers,
favours the sense 'in saving him from his impiety.' Khrûnyâ*t* is a
verbal form (with Bartholomae).

<span id="fn_619"></span>[137:4](sbe31016.htm#fr_620.md) The Pahlavi
translator sees the root is = to wish in ismanô, 'who does not willingly
approach him;' or 'who does not approach desiring (and seeking?) him.'

<span id="fn_620"></span>[137:5](sbe31016.htm#fr_621.md) I am gratified to
see that another takes nearly this view of this line. He has 'verfolgt.'

<span id="fn_621"></span>[138:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_622.md) Haêthahyâ, as a
masculine, is awkward, as would be baêthahyâ, so the Pahl. (of the
terrifier). A loc. of haithya may be correct, taking dâmãn also as a
loc. Otherwise 'to the creatures of the Lie, and the enchainer (or
terrifier).'

<span id="fn_622"></span>[138:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_623.md) Or, 'as Thou didst
make the souls at first.'

<span id="fn_623"></span>[138:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_624.md) So with K6, K9
(Barth.).

<span id="fn_624"></span>[138:4](sbe31016.htm#fr_625.md) Some render 'me'
here, who seem elsewhere loath to translate thwâva*n*t as = like thee,
thee. Khshmâvatô, thwâvãs, and mavaitê, in Y. XLIV, 1, may be rendered,
'of you,' 'thou,' and 'to me.'

<span id="fn_625"></span>[138:5](sbe31016.htm#fr_626.md) So the Pahlavi
indicates. I have, however, elsewhere, as against tradition, rendered as
if the root were dar(e)s; 'has set his eye on me for vengeance.'

<span id="fn_626"></span>[138:6](sbe31016.htm#fr_627.md) One might be
tempted to read ta*t* môi dãs tv*e*m; 'that granting me, do Thou speak
forth for the faith.'

<span id="fn_627"></span>[138:7](sbe31016.htm#fr_628.md) The Pahlavi
translator indicates the root sâ by his rêsh; so read as alternative,
'let him not wound us.'

<span id="fn_628"></span>[138:8](sbe31016.htm#fr_629.md) The meaning 'but
contrariwise' has been ventured on. The indication of the Pahlavi is 'in
opposing;' pavan pa*d*îrak yâmtûni*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[138:9](sbe31016.htm#fr_630.md) The Pahlavi here
misses the point, and taking pâyâ*t* in its usual <span id="page_139">p.
139</span> sense, falls into confusion. The ancient scholars, like some
of their successors, could not always believe that pâ could mean 'to
hold back from good' as well as from evil. They recognised it sometimes,
giving us our instruction on the subject, but not here.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[139:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_631.md) Did the composer
appeal to some powerful coadjutor here, or does he rhetorically express
his perplexity?

<span id="fn_631"></span>[139:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_632.md) Zevî*s*tîm must
equal forms of hû; but from the constant evidence of the Pahlavi to the
meaning 'endearing,' one is much inclined to suggest a reading as if
from zush.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[139:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_633.md) Ashavanem is
applied to Ahura, and cannot so well mean 'righteous' here. 'Holy' is
the more proper term in this connection, while spe*n*tem is necessarily
excluded from that meaning by its occurrence with ashavanem in immediate
connection.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[139:4](sbe31016.htm#fr_634.md) Notice that the
word tashâ occurs here with no mention of wounding in the connection
(see note [6](sbe31006.htm#fn_44) on page [6](sbe31006.htm#page_6).md).

<span id="fn_634"></span>[139:5](sbe31016.htm#fr_635.md) I am here recalled
to the Pahlavi by some who rarely name it. I had rendered, 'these words
are inciting me (in duty) through Thy Good Mind;' so ish often in the
Veda. The Pahlavi translator, like his successors, scandalised at the
difficult forms, also anticipated his successors (as elsewhere often) in
getting free from the difficulty. He did what is exactly equivalent to
what is now practised by scholars (sometimes too often). He rendered the
text as if changed from what he could not understand to what he could
understand, adhering to the right roots however, which I now follow. He
knew that ishe*n*ti mâ did not mean, 'I am seeking,' but he could not
credit the words before him.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[139:6](sbe31016.htm#fr_636.md) We have now a
suggestion which must often have presented itself to those who read the
*Ri*g-veda constantly, and that is (so <span id="page_140">p. 140</span>
Bartholomae) that mâ may equal smâ here and often elsewhere. It is well
possible, as the 's' often disappears.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[140:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_637.md) Notice once more
the expression, 'Thou hast known;' so in Y. XXVIII, II, the composer
confides the very direction of his petitions to the discrimination of
the Deity. We gain from this the true sense of peresâ n*a*u yâ tôi
*e*hmâ par*s*tâ; Ahura's question and prayer are mighty when repeated by
us, because He has known what is best, and what are the true dâth*en*g
for which we should ask.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[140:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_638.md) This sense
corresponds admirably with the connection; Ner. utthâpayâmi.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[140:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_639.md) Such as you = you
as in the plural of majesty, or as referring to Ahura and His Bountiful
Immortals (so often).

<span id="fn_639"></span>[140:4](sbe31016.htm#fr_640.md) 'Go forth.'

<span id="fn_640"></span>[140:5](sbe31016.htm#fr_641.md) Or, 'with kings;'
but the Pahlavi has, avŏ khû*d*âyîh ayû*g*ênd mûn Kîk va Karapŏ.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[140:6](sbe31016.htm#fr_642.md) So the Pahlavi
indicates. Otherwise 'will harden,' or, if khraodat is read, 'will rage
(against).'

<span id="fn_642"></span>[140:7](sbe31016.htm#fr_643.md) Inserted to shed
light on the last line; so the later Parsism.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[141:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_644.md) I am again brought
back to the Pahlavi, having formerly rendered 'bodies,' which I would
now put in the second place.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[141:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_645.md) The Pahlavi,
although as usual free or erroneous as to forms, gives us the valuable
hint of hen*g*î-aît for u*z*g*e*n (sic = *g*ayen).

<span id="fn_645"></span>[141:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_646.md) Here we have the
clear evidence of the conversion of a border tribe. The Zarathu*s*trians
had saved some Turanian clan from plunder or annihilation, and so
secured their friendship. These became known as the 'friendly people.'
That true Zarathu*s*trian piety may have arisen among them is of course
possible.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[141:4](sbe31016.htm#fr_647.md) It need hardly be
said that this reference to Z. in the third person, does not prove that
the composer was not Z. himself. One might even say that his authorship
was even not less probable on this account.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[141:5](sbe31016.htm#fr_648.md) Let it be noted
that the Pahlavi translator gives us our first critical knowledge as to
the true writing and meaning of m*e*hmaidî; or will scholars object that
he renders in the singular? Valman pavan zak î Lekûm Aharâyîh hamîshak
minâm khûp hamkhâk; Ner. dhyâyâmi *s*uddha-sakhâya*m*.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[142:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_649.md) Shall we regard
this verse as misplaced because the subject is in the second person? It
is probable (as of very many verses) that it was often recited by the
composer, or others, in a different connection, and perhaps originally
so; but it was a happy thought for the effect to introduce it here. Let
it be supposed that this and the previous verse were arranged to be
spoken by another voice during the public recital. We see that the
interest is much increased by the intruding strophe.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[142:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_650.md) This passage may
be regarded as recording the call of Vî*s*tâspa to the holy work. Zu =
hû need not always express the invocation of the gods.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[142:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_651.md) Others, 'unite.'

<span id="fn_651"></span>[142:4](sbe31016.htm#fr_652.md) Or, 'ye take to
you the righteous character to yourselves,' as the infinitive is
difficult; but in that case Khshmaibyâ becomes awkward. The translation
of dâ as 'take' has long been familiar.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[142:5](sbe31016.htm#fr_653.md) Obviously composed
for an occasion when the several parties would be present.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[143:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_654) Ar(e.md)dra seems to
be especially applied, and might be left unrendered.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[143:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_655.md) I see no
impossibility whatever in such a rendering, literally in 'his
choice-abode;' so also the Pahlavi indicates: tamman aîgh Aûharmazd
pavan kâmak dên demânŏ ketrûnê*d*. The question is of 'going' and
'dwelling,' and the meaning 'abode' is quite in point. As to var, see
î*s*tâ khshathrâ; and compare mazdâvarâ. Aside from this, vardmãm = in
blessing.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[143:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_656.md) The Pahlavi again,
with its followers, gives us our first hint at the general meaning here.
What else can his pa*d*mân and apa*d*mânîk mean, but the regularity,
that is, the rhythm and cadence of the words?

<span id="fn_656"></span>[143:4](sbe31016.htm#fr_657.md) Dâthem*k*â
adâthem*k*â would be 'the truth and the heresy' in general.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[143:5](sbe31016.htm#fr_658.md) If ma*n*tû is
taken as an instrumental, (can it be an act. imper.?) vistâ might occupy
the place of a preterit, but it looks far more like a participle, and
might be regarded as forming a compositum with vahm*en*g. Supply the
dat. (?) pers. pron. understood before y*e*.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[143:6](sbe31016.htm#fr_659.md) The alteration to
yau*s*, considered as an aorist, has long circulated, but seems now,
like so many of the bolder conceptions, to be given up. Yao*s* is the
sister word of the Vedic yós, and <span id="page_144">p. 144</span>
shows us that some shade of sanctity may inhere in that word. The
Pahlavi renders more indefinitely by 'yân' = a helpful blessing.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[144:1](sbe31016.htm#fr_660.md) The Pahlavi
translator, however, saw m*e*nâ, rendering avŏ li. His text may well
have justified him.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[144:2](sbe31016.htm#fr_661.md) Bearing; or is it
'fit to drive?'

<span id="fn_661"></span>[144:3](sbe31016.htm#fr_662.md) The Pahlavi here
reports another text.

(SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES. As*k*î*t*, in verse 18, may equal 'verily indeed.'
Vahi*s*tâ, &c.= 'the best things of my wealth will I assign to him
through the Good Mind.' The meaning 'wealth' seems much called for here,
and if here, then in verse 2. Vasnâ in verse 19 may mean 'through
grace.')
