### YASNA XXV.

1\. And we worship the Bountiful Immortals with our sacrifice, who rule
aright, and who dispose of all aright; and we worship this Haoma, this
flesh and branch, (2) and these Zaothras for the good waters, having the
Haoma with them, and the flesh with them, and Hadhânaêpata, and lifted
up with sanctity, and we worship the Haoma-water for the beneficial
waters; and we worship the two, the stone mortar and the iron mortar;
(3) and we worship this plant for the Baresman and the well-timed prayer
for blessings which has approached (in its proper place within the
ritual course), and also both the remembrance and the practice <span
id="fr_1171"></span>[2](#fn_1162) of the good Mazdayasnian Religion, and
the heard recital of the Gâthas, and the well-timed prayer for blessings
of the holy lord of the ritual order which has approached, and these
wood-billets with the perfume, (even) thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's
son! and we worship all good objects which are Mazda-made, and which
contain (and are) the seed of Righteousness.

4\. And we worship Ahura Mazda with our sacrifice, the resplendent, the
glorious, and the Bountiful Immortals who rule aright, and who dispose
(of all) aright, and Mithra of the wide pastures and Râman *Hv*âstra;
and we worship the shining sun, the resplendent, the immortal, of the
fleet horses.

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

5\. And we worship the holy wind which works on high, placed higher than
the other creatures in the creation; and we worship this which is thine,
O Vayu! and which appertains to the Spe*n*ta Mainyu within thee; and we
worship the most true religious Knowledge, Mazda-made and holy, and the
good Mazdayasnian law.

6\. And we worship the Mãthra Spe*n*ta verily glorious (as it is), even
the law pronounced against the Daêvas, the Zarathu*s*trian law, and its
long descent <span id="fr_1172"></span>[1](#fn_1163); yea, we worship
the good Mazdayasnian Religion, and the Mãthra which is heart-devoted
and bounteous (imparting heart's devotion to the saint); yea, we worship
the Mazdayasnian Religion maintained in the understanding <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[2](#fn_1164) of the saint; and we honour that
science which is the Mãthra Spe*n*ta, and the innate understanding
Mazda-made, and the derived understanding, heard with ear, and
Mazda-made.

7\. Yea, we worship thee, the Fire, Ahura Mazda's son! the holy lord of
the ritual order; and we worship all the Fires, and Mount Ushi-darena
(which holds the light <span id="fr_1174"></span>[3](#fn_1165))
Mazda-made and holy, the Yazad mount, brilliant with sanctity. 8. And we
worship every holy spiritual <span id="fr_1175"></span>[4](#fn_1166)
Yazad; and every holy earthly Yazad (who exists)!
