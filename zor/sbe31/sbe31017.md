#### THE GÂTHA(Â) SPE*N*TÂ MAINYÛ

#### (SPE*N*TÂMAINYU(Û)).

This Gâtha, consisting of Yasna XLVII-L, takes its name from its
commencing words. Like the other Gâthas it owes its existence as a
collection to the nature of its metre, as its matter is homogeneous with
that of the others. Its metre may be said to be Trish*t*up, as its lines
have each eleven syllables, and are arranged in stanzas of four.

A general view precedes each chapter. The grouping of hymns in this
Gâtha has, as usual, little or nothing to do with the question of their
relative age.

### YASNA XLVII.

#### THE BOUNTIFULNESS OF AHURA.

As in every instance, we may have here only the fragments of a more
extended piece; but also, as ever, the circumstance does not diminish
the value of what remains. Although some signs of authorship apart from
Zarathu*s*tra are present, the later verses are not at all remote, so
far as the period of time which they indicate is concerned, from the
Zarathu*s*trian verses, and are therefore of nearly equal interest,
possessing the advantage moreover of affording data for estimating the
progress of change.

1\. The Spe*n*tâ mainyû here is not identical with Ahura, but is, as so
often, His spirit. It is more than possible that the memorable
application of the word spe*n*ta to the seven, giving us the
Ameshôspends, the Amshaspands of literature, derives its origin from the
first verse here before us, or from lost verses of a similar character.
All the seven seem purposely and artificially grouped here, although
'His Spirit' is of course not one of them. The commencing word spe*n*ta
further attracted attention in so far as to form the theme for a sort of
play upon words in the later epilogue of Visparad XIX. By means of this
His indwelling Spirit (which idea, or expression, has probably no direct
connection with the 'Holy Spirit' of the Old and New Testaments, but
which, as giving the designation 'spirit' to the Ameshôspends, may well
have been the original of the 'seven spirits which are before the throne
of God'), by means of this

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

blessed spirit, that is, in accordance with his inmost thoughts, Ahura
bestows a gift upon the ideal saint (verses 4, 5), upon him who works
the best results for Zarathu*s*tra (Y. XLVI, 19), the Ratu, and the
prophet (Y. XXIX, 6, 8). And this gift is declared to be the inseparable
two, Happiness in every particular, and then both the prospect and
realisation of the continuance of that Happiness in Immortality. And
these He bestows, not through His immediate action, which no human
intellect, or susceptibility, could take in unaided, but by His
especially revealed Benevolence, His Best Mind, as His representative,
in accordance with His plan of Order and Purity, pervading every moral
as well as every spiritual regulation, and by the exercise of His Royal
Power, sent forth as the 'archangel' Khshathra, and embodied in the
polity of the sacred Zarathu*s*trian state, and this as influenced in
all its relations, public and domestic, by practical piety called
Âramaiti, Ahura's daughter (the ready mind). Such a revelation of the
component parts of the mind and will of the Deity, the simplest
labouring Class could understand for the moment, and for some decades;
but all was, as a matter of course, soon to be overgrown with the old
weeds of superstition and of myth.

2\. Falling into detail and varying expressions, the composer prays that
Ahura may carry out His holy scheme into action by the busy hands and
fingers of domestic piety, and by the preached and recited words of the
Good Mind from the mouth and tongue of faithful priests. So, and so
only, would He become the Father of Asha, the divine Order, and of moral
and ritual regularity among men.

3\. From discourse concerning God, he arises, as so often, to an address
to Him. That Spirit (referred to in the verses 1, 2) is Ahura's own, for
He is the One who makes it bounteous; He is the bountiful One who has
created the sacred symbolic Kine, the emblem and the substance of 'joy,'
representing at once the possessions of the holy people, and those
people themselves. And He it is who, in answer to her wail (Y. XXIX, 1,
9), has spread for her the meadows 'of Piety' as arranged in the
consultations (Y. XXXIII, 6) made on her behalf.

4\. And this 'Spirit,' as might be expected, does not confine its
attention to the inspiration of Piety alone. The justice of Mazda is
vindicated. The wicked are afflicted under its influence with a long
wounding (Y. XXX, 11) for their sins, and for their cynical preference
for prosperous men of bad and dishonest character as well as of
heretical faith.

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

5\. But he expresses his confidence that Ahura Mazda will, in the end,
set all aright. He will, unlike the persons just mentioned, give unto
the ashavan, not kasu alone, but paru, (not a meagre share, but fulness)
of whatever is the best, while the dregva*n*t and the aka (verse 4), the
faithless and the wicked, although they may be isvanô, prosperous, will
only taste the enjoyment of their wealth aside from God, and therefore
marred. So long as they pursue their usual course, they live in actions
inspired not by the bountiful spirit, but by the Evil Mind, a mind as
aka as the person alluded to in the words parao*s* (kâthê) akô dregvaitê
in the previous verse.

6\. But, as ever, the moral appeals, and ascriptions of praise, lofty as
they are, are not left without the support and service of the ritual.
God will give these gifts, and all which are the best, but in connection
with His Fire imparted to these struggling sides (Y. XXXI, 2), the
believing and the faithless (verses 4, 5), through the increase of His
Piety and Order; for that piety, as ever the instructress, will convert
all those who come to her, and seek her light (Y. XXX, 1; Y. XLV, 1).
Nay, she will cause all the living to choose and believe in God (Y.
XXXI, 3).

(If the first two verses here are more like the work of a disciple, the
last four show again the original tone. It must never be forgotten,
however, that later and even interpolated portions are, in their sense,
also original, and differ but slightly in their great age from pieces
more directly from the first composer.)

Translation.

11\. And to this <span id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_662.md) (man, His chosen
saint), Ahura Mazda will give <span id="fr_664"></span>[2](#fn_663.md) both
the two (greatest gifts, His)

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Universal Weal and
Immortality, by means of His bountiful Spirit, and with His Best Mind,
from (the desire to maintain His) Righteous moral Order in word and
deed, and by the (strength and wisdom) of His Sovereign Power,
(established) in Piety (among His folk).

2\. Aye, (that blessedness, which is the) best <span
id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_664) (creation.md) of this most bounteous
spirit, Ahura Mazda will bring forth in action with words from the mouth
and tongue of His Good Mind (within His seers), and by the two
hands <span id="fr_666"></span>[2](#fn_665.md) of Âramaiti (His Piety as
she lives within the soul). And by such <span
id="fr_667"></span>[3](#fn_666) wise (beneficence is.md) He the father of
the righteous Order (within our worship and our lives).

3\. And Thou art therein, O Ahura Mazda! the bountiful One who
appertains to, and who possesses, that (most bounteous) spirit in that
Thou art He who for this <span id="fr_668"></span>[4](#fn_667.md) (man, in
whom this spirit works) hath made the joy-creating Kine. (And as to
her), for her, as

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

joyful meadows <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_668.md) of her peace, wilt
Thou bestow (Thine) Âramaiti (who is our Piety as earth considered),
since he <span id="fr_670"></span>[2](#fn_669) (for her.md) hath taken
counsel with Thy Good Mind, Lord!

4\. (But this Thy bounteous spirit doth not alone bestow rewards and
blessings on the good.) The wicked (foemen of the Faith) are harmed, and
from (the motives which move) that bounteous spirit (of Thine own), O
Mazda <span id="fr_671"></span>[3](#fn_670.md)! but not thus the saints.
(And yet the ruler's pride would ever slight the righteous.) The feeble
man alone stands free to give in kindly obligation <span
id="fr_672"></span>[4](#fn_671.md) to Thy saint, but having wealth and
ruling power, the evil (man) is (at the service) of the wicked, and for
much <span id="fr_673"></span>[5](#fn_672.md).

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

5\. But Thou wilt give these gifts, and through Thy (most blessed and
most) bounteous spirit, O Ahura Mazda! to this <span
id="fr_674"></span>[1](#fn_673.md) Thy holy saint, for they are whatsoever
is the best; but far <span id="fr_675"></span>[2](#fn_674.md) from Thy love
the wicked has his portion, abiding in the actions of the Evil Mind.

6\. Aye, these things wilt Thou give (to him), O Thou Ahura Mazda! and
through Thy bounteous spirit, (and) by Thy Fire as in a good bestowal to

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

the two striving <span id="fr_676"></span>[1](#fn_675) (throngs.md) through
the prosperous increase of our Piety, and of the Righteous ritual and
moral Truth; for that (Piety of ours instructing) doth teach <span
id="fr_677"></span>[2](#fn_676.md) the many coming ones who seek her
(face)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_662"></span>[147:1](sbe31017.htm#fr_663.md) Or, 'to us;' but
in that case it would be the Kine who 'took counsel' as mentioned in the
third verse. This is, however, far from impossible, as she is mentioned
as uttering her wail, and being answered by her maker in Y. XXIX, 1, 2.
So understanding, 'to us' becomes an admirable rendering for verse 1;
but in verse 3, it is strained, as the Kine for whom (Y. XXIX, 9)
Zarathu*s*tra was appointed, could not so readily be declared to be the
one which was given to 'us,' she representing 'us' in that place to a
great extent. There is a certain plausibility about the rendering 'to
us,' but I think ahmâi refers to ashaonê understood (see verses 4 and
5). The Pahlavi, moreover, is against a first person.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[147:2](sbe31017.htm#fr_664) Dãn (Geldn..md) seems
to be a 3rd plural aorist subjunctive; the <span id="page_148">p.
148</span> plural being owing to the fact that Ahura gives with the
other Ameshôspends. Dã, might also be the relic of the proper word which
represents the participle; comp. dãs (sic).

<span id="fn_664"></span>[148:1](sbe31017.htm#fr_665.md) The idea of the
summum bonum seems to have early developed itself, and from this
constant use of this word in the neut. singular and plural, and also
with anghu.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[148:2](sbe31017.htm#fr_666.md) Notice once more
the pronounced personification of both Vohu Manah and Âramaiti; see Y.
XXX, 8, and Y. XLIV, 14, &c. The Pahlavi translation notices the dual
form pavan kolâ II yadman.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[148:3](sbe31017.htm#fr_667.md) The Pahlavi seems
to lead those who regard ôyâ as = a form of ava; it has zak î.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[148:4](sbe31017.htm#fr_668.md) This is the ahmâi
of the first verse, (but always possibly = 'to us,' if the verses are
not to be brought into any kind of connection.) Otherwise it obviously
refers to ashâunê\* in 4 and 5; so the Pahlavi throughout. See ahmâi and
hôi in LI, 6.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[149:1](sbe31017.htm#fr_669.md) Many would say
that we have here an instance in which the identity of Âramaiti with the
earth is recognised in the Gâthas. I would say, on the contrary, that
here we have an instance in which a poetical conception gave rise to a
later error or fantastical association. Piety, with frugal virtue,
induced a thorough husbandry; and secured the hushiti, peaceful
home-life. She gave meadow to the Kine; at the next step she poetically
represents the meadows, and then the earth. If vâstrâi, it would be for
'nurture.'

<span id="fn_669"></span>[149:2](sbe31017.htm#fr_670.md) Or 'she,' as she
once bewailed in a colloquy. Otherwise the person who was appointed to
care for her interests is meant. Compare Y. XXXIII, 6, where the
righteous Zaotar speaks as desiring counsels (h*e*mpar*s*tôi*s*) in the
interest of the pastures, and the laws of the sacred agriculture. Cp.
also the later reproduction of the idea in an extended form in the
Vendîdâd. The zaotar of Y. XXXIII, 6, may have been the ashavan of
verses 4 and 5.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[149:3](sbe31017.htm#fr_671.md) Voc. with K5
(Barth.).

<span id="fn_671"></span>[149:4](sbe31017.htm#fr_672.md) The Pahlavi gives
us, as usual, our first surmise as to the meaning of 'kâthê;' I follow
Geldner with regard to it as against Haug. The expressions here are not
literal.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[149:5](sbe31017.htm#fr_673.md) Isvâ*k*î*t*
connects only indirectly with kas*e*u*sk*î*t*, as kâthê intervenes. I
regard parao*s* akô dregvâitê as presenting the true antithesis to
kas*e*u*sk*î*t* nâ ashâunê. The isvâ may have *k*î*t* merely from the
influence of jingle, being at the head of the line like kas*e*u*s*; isvâ
means <span id="page_150">p. 150</span> of itself 'possessing means.'
Parao*s* may depend on kâthê understood, as kas*e*u*s* depends on it
expressed. Moreover, his in all the instances in which it is used ends
the sense, and here is separated by the caesura from parao*s*, which,
however, is of no great importance. The discourse is of the wicked; the
holy are incidentally mentioned, and here their ill-treatment is
signalised. Akô cannot well mean 'hostile' here; see also akâ*t* in the
following verse. Isvâ*k*î*t*, if understood with nâ, alters nothing. 'A
man was desirous of (little for the service of the saint, but even when
he himself was rich, in the desire) of much was the evil for the evil.'
Or, taking kas*e*u*sk*î*t* as governed by isvâ*k*î*t* understood with
kâthê as before understood in the last line: 'Only a man (men)
(possessed) of little was at the service of the righteous, while an evil
man (men) possessed of much (was at the service) of the wicked.' The
other translation is: 'Even a man of little means stands to the willing
service of the saint, but a man even of large means is hostile (?) to
the wicked.' This is very glib and so attractive, but I cannot accept it
in view of the context. Gâthic expression is often unfortunately far
from glib; but cramped, awkward, and apt to contain more thought than
could be conveniently expressed within the counted number of syllables.
The glib rendering needs other language than that in the MSS. See the
following verse, which directly contrasts the treatment of the good and
evil by Ahura Himself.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[150:1](sbe31017.htm#fr_674.md) See ahmâi in verse
1, and ashaunê in verse 4. Ahura treats the saint in a manner the
reverse from that practised by the nâ kas*e*u*s*\* and akô, not giving
sparingly to the good, nor much to the wicked.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[150:2](sbe31017.htm#fr_675.md) The Pahlavi gives
us our first surmise here, as usual, by *g*avî*d* min hanâ î lak
dôshi*s*nîh.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[151:1](sbe31017.htm#fr_676.md) Or, 'by the two
ará*n*i;' but compare the ãsay*a*u in Y. XXXI, 2 just preceding
ranôibyâ; so here the ashavan and dregva*n*t are mentioned in a
preceding verse. The Pahlavi is unvarying with patkardârânŏ. I will not
positively decide as to this point; generally, however, the preferred
rendering is in the text, while on very many questions there is nearly
an even balance of probabilities.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[151:2](sbe31017.htm#fr_677.md) Or, 'chooses to
herself;' but a causative sense may be expressed by an intensive form;
the Pahlavi also here bears evidence in the same sense to a causative by
hêmnunê*d*, itself, however, meaning only the object caused; namely, the
belief.
