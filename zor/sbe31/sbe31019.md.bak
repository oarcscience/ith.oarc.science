### YASNA XLIX.

#### REVERSES AND HOPES. HONOUR TO FRASHAO*S*TRA AND OTHER CHIEFS.

The chapter divides itself naturally into sections 1-5, 6-11. Verse 12
belongs with chapter L. One of the struggles in the holy cause seems to
have gone against the party of Asha. I say 'one

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

of the struggles,' for from the account of a reverse which we have here,
and from that of a success which meets us in chapter XLV, 1, and again
from reverses in XLVI, 1, 2, &c., we naturally conclude that 'the cause'
saw many vicissitudes, in which the last Gâtha still leaves us. Whether
Y. XLV, 1 records a victory which was subsequent to the reverse before
us, referring to a battle alluded to in Y. XLIV, 14, 15, also possibly
anticipated in Y. XXXI, can never be decided; the order of the
statements in the sequence of our present MSS. has little or nothing to
do with the possible order of the events.

1\. A border chief, B*en*dva by name, had proved himself too formidable
(mazi*s*tô) for the moment, and the holy Faith knows how to beg for
vengeance on the armed Drû*g*-worshipper. The weapons of Ahura were not
spiritual only, any more than those of Israel were, or those of
Mohammed. The death of an armed religious enemy was devoutly to be
desired for every moral and political, as well as for every personal
reason. 2. For judicial as well as priestly decisions hung on the issue.
And this B*en*dva had his functionaries and a system, and they were in
full and active operation. And this was, beyond a doubt, a rival and
settled system, and not merely an upstart and insurrectionary one. It
had caused the true prophet many an hour of thought as well as anger.
Its functionaries gave him pause (mânayêitî). Falsity in religion was as
ever his opportunity; and invective follows. 'The priestly judge himself
who served the Drû*g*-worshippers was a cheat.' 'The holy Order was his
foe, and not his helper.' And he did not contribute at all to the spread
of Piety as the Zarathu*s*trians conceived of it, nor indeed really in
another sense for the reason that he even repudiated the source of pious
wisdom, which is holy counsel. 3. But, however, the evil functionaries
might resort to subterfuge and strategy, the opposing powers themselves,
the Righteous Order on the one side, and the power of the Lie-demon on
the other, were planted in the opposing systems with dualistic
clearness, to benefit or injure. There was no compromise, as doubtless
the Drû*g*-party may have wished.

And so the poet cries once more for the divine Benevolence to be his
guardian; or perhaps he may have intended a particular chief who
represented the Good Mind, while at the same time he swept the entire
throng and company who adhered to the Lie-demon, with his interdict,
away from his consideration. 4. He declares them closely allied to the
Daêva-worshippers, or else he puts their worship of the Daêvas in the
place of climax as their

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

highest offence, not failing to point out what should conciliate
sympathy with him always; that is, that those who brought the Daêvas,
and opposed Asha, were the devotees of Rapine (aêshmem vareden); for
murderous rapine seems to have been, apart from Asha, the universal sin.
By this these Daêva-worshippers gained a stolen livelihood, and spent
their ill-gotten means in idle waste (fshuyasû afshuya*n*tô). 5. But he
who defended the holy Daêna was as meat and drink to the people, wise
and faithful, as a settled citizen, and trained in the habits of the
holy State.

6\. He therefore prays once more for right discernment as to how he may
propagate the Faith. 7. And he calls on the steady citizen to listen,
beseeching God Himself to give an ear, and to tell him who the faithful
prince, or peer, or villager, may be, who may take the lead (see sar*e*)
in giving forth (see srâvayaêmâ) that holy Daêna, with its frasasti, to
the masses who await it. 8. But he asks the question as if only to give
emphasis to his naming a chief and venerated friend. Frashao*s*tra is
the man. He is the one fitted for the hearing, apt to proclaim the truth
(frasrûidyâi erethwô). And he begs that they both (compare Y. XXVIII, 9)
may be lastingly prominent in that holy Realm which was to counteract
the depraved polity whose chief had for the moment gained the upper hand
(verses 1, 2). 9. But the case is in so far uncertain and undecided,
that he cries for help once more to the ideal citizen himself, fearing
that he may yet be induced to share the power with the heretic, and
still declares that men's souls may reach the reward of priority only
through the holy System of Ahura, and under the rulers of His choice.

10\. He therefore confides the result to Ahura, and with it, his
dependents, those living and those dead. And his thoughts, being turned
to heaven (11), they also revert as if by antithesis (the key-note of
the Daêna) to future retribution. Those who may be wavering,
half-inclined to adhere to the opposing party (verse 9), are warned in
words of peculiar meaning. Those that choose the evil sovereign, a
du*s*sasti, as in Y. XXXII, 9, or as the sastars of Y. XLVI, 1, will not
go forward with the saints to the *K*inva*t* (Y. XLVI, 10), nor will
they be met by their consciences under pleasing images, and later by the
souls of saints who had gone before, but the wicked dead shall meet them
in the home of Lies, with poisoned food, and sneering words. And this
shall be a self-inflicted vengeance.

Translation.

1\. B*en*dva <span id="fr_720"></span>[1](#fn_719.md) has ever fought with
me; (yea, since he first appeared at hand to threaten, and alas to his
advantage in the strife) He is the most powerful (in brutal might), and
(in his predominance) would crush my strength as I seek to win back the
disaffected (in my host) through Righteous <span
id="fr_721"></span>[2](#fn_720) (zeal.md), O Mazda! Come then with gifts of
(vengeful <span id="fr_722"></span>[3](#fn_721)) good to (meet.md) my
sorrow <span id="fr_723"></span>[4](#fn_722). Through (Thine inspiring.md)
Good Mind obtain (for me <span id="fr_724"></span>[5](#fn_723).md) that
(B*en*dva's) death <span id="fr_725"></span>[6](#fn_724.md)!

2\. (Aye, he is indeed the greatest <span
id="fr_726"></span>[7](#fn_725).md), for that

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> B*en*dva's evil
judge doth cause me to hesitate and ponder (in my earnest course of
propagation and reform), a deceiver as he is, (estranged) from the
Righteous Order, and receiving <span id="fr_727"></span>[1](#fn_726.md)
from it (not happiness) but many a wound. The bountiful and perfect
Piety he has not maintained nor strengthened for this <span
id="fr_728"></span>[2](#fn_727.md) land, nor questions with Thy Good Mind
hath he asked <span id="fr_729"></span>[3](#fn_728) (to gain him light.md),
O Lord!

3\. But (all is not yet lost!); for this religious choice <span
id="fr_730"></span>[4](#fn_729.md) (our holy creed, for which our last
lost <span id="fr_731"></span>[5](#fn_730) battle has been fought.md), O
Mazda! Thy blessed Order (our guardian help) has yet been set to save
and bless us. (But) for (that evil) Judge, the Demon-of-the-Lie, (is
set) to deal (for him) her wounds <span id="fr_732"></span>[6](#fn_731.md).
Therefore do I pray (the more) for the sheltering leadership of Thy Good
Mind (within our folk and our commanders). And all the allies of the
wicked I abjure <span id="fr_733"></span>[7](#fn_732.md).

4\. They who with evil scheme and will shall cherish and help on the
Wrath of Rapine, and with her Râma <span
id="fr_734"></span>[8](#fn_733), and (not by silent favour, but.md) with
their

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

very tongues, whose will and wish <span id="fr_735"></span>[1](#fn_734.md)
(run) not with good but evil deeds. These settle and support the Daêvas
(in their power, not the Lord). It is <span
id="fr_736"></span>[2](#fn_735.md) the wicked's Faith and Insight (so to
do. Their faith is the perverted).

5\. But he, O Mazda! is our abundance and our fatness <span
id="fr_737"></span>[3](#fn_736.md), who (will yet dare these unbelieving
foes) and guard the Faith (against that envious Wrath <span
id="fr_738"></span>[4](#fn_737).md), and with the Good Mind's power. For
every man of Piety is a wise citizen <span
id="fr_739"></span>[5](#fn_738.md) in accordance with the holy Order, and
so are all who are (in truth) within Thy Realm, O Lord!

6\. And now, will I beseech of You, O Mazda, and Righteousness (within
Thy Mãthra) speaks <span id="fr_740"></span>[6](#fn_739) (to tell me.md)
what lies within Your will's intention, that (having discerned Your
Insight as the enlightened

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

ever must), I may as well discern aright how we can herald forth those
(truths), and that pure Daêna (with them) which is the Faith of Him who
is Thyself <span id="fr_741"></span>[1](#fn_740.md), O Lord.

7, And (as we speak it forth as taught by Asha) then let the
(zealous <span id="fr_742"></span>[2](#fn_741) citizen.md) give heed, and
with Thy Good Mind, O Ahura Mazda! Yea, let him give ear in accordance
with (the dictate of) the Holy Order, and do Thou hear alike as
well <span id="fr_743"></span>[3](#fn_742.md). Who shall be the ally; and
who the kinsman-lord himself, who, with his gifts and (legal rules),
shall institute and settle for the serving mass a worthy praise (for
God <span id="fr_744"></span>[4](#fn_743).md)?

8\. (And I do not ask in vain, for such an one is found for us, and near
at hand.) To Frashao*s*tra hast Thou given that most favouring guardian
power, the headship <span id="fr_745"></span>[5](#fn_744.md) of the Holy
Order (for us), O

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ahura! This
therefore would I pray of Thee (to confirm to him that gracious gift),
and for myself likewise, would I now seek as well that sheltering
headship which is within Thy Realm; yea, most blest and foremost <span
id="fr_746"></span>[1](#fn_745.md) may we both for ever be within it.

9\. Aye, let the zealous and thrifty husbandman, so formed for giving
help and blessings <span id="fr_747"></span>[2](#fn_746.md), give heed and
listen when I call, (O Mazda!) Let not the truthful (tiller, he who
hears and speaks Thy word <span id="fr_748"></span>[3](#fn_747).md), be he
who takes <span id="fr_749"></span>[4](#fn_748.md) that sheltering
chieftainship together with the wicked. Let the believing natures (only)
join in that best recompense. And thus in the course of the holy Order
are in the fact so joined those two, *G*âmâspa and the 'hero' <span
id="fr_750"></span>[5](#fn_749.md).

10\. (And since these champions thus join in that reward), then
therefore will I place as well in Thy

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

protection (Thy) Good Mind <span id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_750.md) (in the
living) and the spirits (of the dead. Yea, I confide our very)
self-humbling praises, (which we offer, unto Thee), by which (Thine)
Âramaiti (who is our Piety, exists), and likewise sacrificing zeal. And
this would we do to further Thy great Sovereign Power (among Thy folk),
and with undying <span id="fr_752"></span>[2](#fn_751) (?.md) strength.

11\. (But as to faithless reprobates); the souls (of the evil dead)
shall meet those evil men who serve their evil rulers, who speak with
evil words, and harbour evil consciences, these souls (in Hell) shall
come with evil food <span id="fr_753"></span>[3](#fn_752.md) (to welcome
them), and in the Lie's abode their dwelling <span
id="fr_754"></span>[4](#fn_753.md) verily shall be <span
id="fr_755"></span>[5](#fn_754.md)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_719"></span>[162:1](sbe31019.htm#fr_720.md) If this word does
not simply mean 'a band,' one might suspect a relation of root with
bãnayen. The Pahlavi has expressively and freely badtûm here, and
vîmarîh in the next verse, with a like word in Y. XXX, 6. This enemy may
have been roughly dubbed 'the polluted,' or even 'diseased one;'
analogous occurrences are not wanting.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[162:2](sbe31019.htm#fr_721.md) I cannot agree to
rendering ashâ 'really,' when applied in an evil sense. The sacred word
may mean 'really' when applied to the righteous, but then, in that case,
the reality indicated has an element of sanctity in it, and that of no
low order. I am also not aware that *ri*téna is applied in an evil sense
in the *Ri*g-veda. The use of Asha, like that of Vohu Manah and
Khshathra, &c., is obvious in the Gâtha; the six sacred words were, like
the theme of a symphony, brought in at every opportunity, with all
shades of meaning from those of proper names to those of adverbs. With
slight change of text to a nom., we might render, 'He who seeks to
please the evil-minded, O Thou A.!'

<span id="fn_721"></span>[162:3](sbe31019.htm#fr_722.md) Comp. Y. XXXIII,
2,

<span id="fn_722"></span>[162:4](sbe31019.htm#fr_723.md) I cannot agree
that arapâ should be read rapâ for the sake of a syllable in the metre.
The line has more than eleven syllables here, as the Vedic Trish*t*up
often has. Moreover the ancient writing before the Pahlavi translator
read likewise arapâ, and the sense demands it.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[162:5](sbe31019.htm#fr_724.md) Or, 'may I
obtain.'

<span id="fn_724"></span>[162:6](sbe31019.htm#fr_725.md) See Y. LIII, 9.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[162:7](sbe31019.htm#fr_726.md) See the first
verse.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[163:1](sbe31019.htm#fr_727.md) I would gladly
accede to a subjunctive 2nd singular intensive here in a causative
sense, but a 3rd singular precedes, and a 3rd singular follows. I cannot
therefore recognise a subjunctive in a precative, or imperative, sense
here. I think the word is a nominative, as its position in the verse
corresponds well to that form. It may mean 'delivering against us many a
wound.'

<span id="fn_727"></span>[163:2](sbe31019.htm#fr_728.md) Possibly 'for us
in (this) land.'

<span id="fn_728"></span>[163:3](sbe31019.htm#fr_729.md) Comp. Y. XLIV, 13.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[163:4](sbe31019.htm#fr_730.md) Comp. Y. XXX, 2.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[163:5](sbe31019.htm#fr_731.md) See mazi*s*tô in
the first verse.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[163:6](sbe31019.htm#fr_732.md) The Pahlavi mûn
rêshînê*d* pavan Drû*g*.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[163:7](sbe31019.htm#fr_733.md) The Pahlavi
translator gave as our first rendering here: Andarg harvîsp-gûnŏ
darvandânŏ min hamkhâkîh andarg yemalelûnam; \[aîgh, min dôstîh î
levatman valman*s*ân *g*avî*d*âk yehevûnam\].

<span id="fn_733"></span>[163:8](sbe31019.htm#fr_734.md) The Pahlavi has
arêshkŏ = envy.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[164:1](sbe31019.htm#fr_735.md) The Pahlavi gave
us our first surmise as to the general meaning of vãs; it renders kâmak.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[164:2](sbe31019.htm#fr_736.md) Or, 'by that which
is the evil's Faith.'

<span id="fn_736"></span>[164:3](sbe31019.htm#fr_737.md) The Pahlavi
translator gave us our first general indication here as elsewhere; he
has shîrînîh and *k*arpîh. Reading 'Mazd*a*u,' we have 'Mazda (is our
source of) abundance and refreshment.'

<span id="fn_737"></span>[164:4](sbe31019.htm#fr_738.md) See the fourth
verse.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[164:5](sbe31019.htm#fr_739.md) The Pahlavi has,
however, khûp shinâsakîh. I differ with hesitation; possibly views may
be harmonised.

<span id="fn_739"></span>[164:6](sbe31019.htm#fr_740.md) Compare Y. XXIX,
3, where Asha answers. I cannot well accept mrûitê as an infinitive.
Geldner has keenly pointed out that fraêshyâ is inclined to unite with
an infinitive, but so are other forms of ish and vas. Moreover the
infinitive does not so naturally fall to the end of the sentence in
Gâthic or Vedic. (See above, note on Y. XXXIV, 1.) If an infinitive is
insisted upon (so long since) let us at least bring the word into more
usual shape, using the Pahlavi translator, as in one of his most
valuable offices, as an indirect evidence, where his translation is at
fault as a rendering. He has: Frâzŏ avŏ zak î Lekûm farmâyêm, Aûharmazd,
va Ashavahi*s*tŏ*k* râî yemalelûnam. He had 'mrûvê' before him, which
might be an infinitive.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[165:1](sbe31019.htm#fr_741.md) I think that
khshmâvatô equals simply 'yourself' here, as often (so mava*n*t = me);
otherwise 'of your disciple,' which would be feeble. Professor Jolly
has, V.S., s. 97, 'damit wir ihn verkündigen möchten den Glauben,
welcher der euere ist, o Ahura.'

<span id="fn_741"></span>[165:2](sbe31019.htm#fr_742.md) See the ninth
verse.

<span id="fn_742"></span>[165:3](sbe31019.htm#fr_743.md) Ahura is elsewhere
addressed in close connection with human beings; here the human subject
is half lost in Vohûman and Asha. I hardly think that it is wise to
change the text without MSS. A lost verse may have relieved all
difficulty.

<span id="fn_743"></span>[165:4](sbe31019.htm#fr_744.md) Others 'the good
doctrine,' or again 'the good repute;' but as to the latter, frasasti is
coupled so constantly in the later Avesta with yasna, and vahma, &c.,
that I do not feel at liberty to depart from that sense. The Pahlavi has
also vâfrîgânîh, quite in harmony with the connection.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[165:5](sbe31019.htm#fr_745.md) This verse is
clearly an answer to the questions contained in verse 7. It is a half
answer, even if we render d*a*u (dâo) as a subjunctive. As the question
in verse 7 certainly concerns a chief of some kind, I cannot see how we
can avoid rendering sar*e*m analogously. We need one who gives a refuge
rather than one who receives it. Compare the Pahlavi, and also the
Persian, sar. The Pahlavi <span id="page_166">p. 166</span> translation
gives its evidence without intermission for this meaning, a fact largely
overlooked.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[166:1](sbe31019.htm#fr_746.md) I think that the
connection fairly proves this meaning; and it has likewise the powerful
support of the Pahlavi translation: Hamâi vad avŏ vîspŏ farmânpatŏ
hômanânî \[aîgh, Frasho*s*tar \[ \] vad tanû î pasînŏ hamâî *s*alîtâîh
yehabûn\].

<span id="fn_746"></span>[166:2](sbe31019.htm#fr_747.md) It is not to be
forgotten that su is the root of Saoshya*n*t.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[166:3](sbe31019.htm#fr_748.md) Comp. Y. XXXI, 15.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[166:4](sbe31019.htm#fr_749.md) Or 'gives;'
compare peresâ ava*t* yâ maini*s* y*e* dregvâitê khshathrem hunâitî.
Professor Jolly, V.S., s. 36: 'Nicht soll wer das Rechte redet, die
Herrschaft dem Lügner überlassen.'

<span id="fn_749"></span>[166:5](sbe31019.htm#fr_750.md) Yâhî remains a
singular, whereas we should expect a dual; (can it be such, the form
being altered, as so often by later reciters, to accommodate the metre?)
For *G*âmâspâ and yukhtâ as duals compare utayûitî tevîsht. Yâhî
probably refers to Vî*s*tâspa (Y. XLVI, 14). Was it an especial epithet
for the kings? The later Persian kings took prominent places in battle.
If the duals are not admitted, my rendering would be, 'the souls are
united with the reward through the (influence and example of the)
valiant *G*âmâspa.' Perhaps *G*âmâspô is to be read.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[167:1](sbe31019.htm#fr_751.md) This is probably
the foundation for the later identification of Vohû Manah and the
faithful disciple.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[167:2](sbe31019.htm#fr_752.md) Here all is
conjectural. The Pahlavi reports an adjective from a form of man (or a
participle). They who think upon the throne (to seize it) do so with
dying power. Wilder conjectures have been made; but the Pahlavi
translators seldom wilfully guessed. They took the shattered results of
their predecessors, and worked them feebly over; hence their great
value, and the unimportance of their errors. They used what intelligence
they possessed in redelivering what they heard and read. Vazdanghâ
cannot well be taken in an evil sense, as it is used in a good sense
elsewhere. The connection mãzâ with râ has long circulated; mãzâ avêmî
râ (?). As the souls of the departed are thought of, perhaps 'undying'
is the meaning; compare av*e*mîra (for form) with the Zend avimithri*s*.

<span id="fn_752"></span>[167:3](sbe31019.htm#fr_753.md) See Ya*s*t XXII by
Darmesteter, as supplemented.

<span id="fn_753"></span>[167:4](sbe31019.htm#fr_754.md) So the Pahlavi;
otherwise 'their bodies shall so lie.'

<span id="fn_754"></span>[167:5](sbe31019.htm#fr_755.md) Verse 12 belongs
to the next chapter.
