### VISPARAD XXI (SP. XXIV).

1\. We strive earnestly, and we take up our Yasna and our homage to the
good waters, and to the fertile fruit-trees (which bear as of
themselves), and to the Fravashis of the saints; yea, we take up our
Yasna, and our homage earnestly to those beings which are (so) good, the
waters, and the trees, and the Fravashis of the saints, (2) and to the
Kine, and to Gaya (Maretan), and to the Mãthra Spe*n*ta (the bounteous
word-of-reason), the holy, which works (within and for us with effect),
to these we take up our Yasnas and our homage with earnest zeal, and to
Thee, O Ahura Mazda! and to thee, O Zarathu*s*tra, we do the same; and
to thee, O lofty lord (the Apãm-napâ*t*), and to the Bountiful
Immortals. 3. And we sacrifice to the listening (that hears our prayers)
and to that mercy, and to the hearing of (our spoken) homage, and to
that mercy which is (shown in response to our offered) praise. And we
sacrifice to the frârâiti vîdushê, which is contained in the piece
*hv*âdaênâi*s* ashaonis; and we sacrifice to 'the good praise which is
without hypocrisy, and which has no malice (as its end)'; and we
sacrifice to the later Yasna and to its offering; and we sacrifice to
the chapters of the later Yasna, and to its metrical lines, its words,
and word-structure.
