### YASNA LVIII (SP. LVII).

#### THE FSHÛSHÔ-MÃTHRA <span id="fr_1282"></span>[1](#fn_1272).

1\. (Introduction.) (To the increase of our homage and praise of God) we
offer this service <span id="fr_1283"></span>[2](#fn_1273) which, as our
defence <span id="fr_1284"></span>[3](#fn_1274), may shield us, which is
worship <span id="fr_1285"></span>[4](#fn_1275) with its beneficent
results; and Blessedness is with it of a verity <span
id="fr_1286"></span>[5](#fn_1276), and Piety as well. \[(Pâzand) and of
this worship the results here mentioned are the well-thought thought,
the word well spoken, and the deed well done\]; and let this our worship
shelter us from the Daêva and from the evil-minded man. 2. And to this
worship do we confide <span id="fr_1287"></span>[6](#fn_1277) our
settlements

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

and persons for protection and care, for guarding, and for oversight;
(3) and in this worship will we abide, O Ahura Mazda! and with joy.

In this worship do we exercise our choices; and to it will we approach,
and to it will we belong; yea, to revering worship will we confide our
settlements and persons for protection, and for care, for guarding, and
for oversight, to such worship as is the praise of such as You <span
id="fr_1288"></span>[1](#fn_1278).

MÃTHRA.

4\. The owner of herds is the righteous (one), and he is victorious when
he strikes, and thus he is the best; \[(Pâzand) we therefore offer
(this) service (for herd-owners <span
id="fr_1289"></span>[2](#fn_1279))\] for the herd-owner is the father of
the Kine by the help of him who follows the ritual order; and he is the
father of the holy man as well, and of the sanctified creation <span
id="fr_1290"></span>[3](#fn_1280). He is in verity the bestower of
blessings, and to him <span id="fr_1291"></span>[4](#fn_1281), O Ye
Bountiful Immortals <span id="fr_1292"></span>[5](#fn_1282)! we render,
(and his do we make) Your greatness, Your goodness, and Your (spiritual)
beauty, and let this man, the cattle-owner, approach to guard over us;
and may he be our watchman together with the Righteous Order, and with
store for our nourishment and full generous liberality, together with
sharing of the goods <span id="fr_1293"></span>[6](#fn_1283), with
gentleness <span id="fr_1294"></span>[7](#fn_1284), and with Ahura
Mazda's sacred Fire!

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

5\. O Ye Bountiful Immortals! as Ye have made us, so do Ye save us, holy
men, and saintly women (as we are, and steadfast in the faith) <span
id="fr_1295"></span>[1](#fn_1285). Save us, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! Ye
who rule aright and who dispose (of all) aright, for none other do I
know, save You; then with Your Righteousness <span
id="fr_1296"></span>[2](#fn_1286) do Ye save us.

6\. And we offer hereby our thoughts, and words, and actions, our herds,
and men, to the Bountiful Spirit. And may the creative stars of Ahura
Mazda, the Creator, shine down on us, and round about us <span
id="fr_1297"></span>[3](#fn_1287) with full herds and healthy
settlements, with healthy herds and healthy men, and with all in vigour,
and endowed with the blessing of the Lord. 7. Praise to Thee, O Fire of
Ahura Mazda! may’st thou come to (us in) the greatest one of the
engrossing interests <span id="fr_1298"></span>[4](#fn_1288) for the
help of the great (effort), for the joy-producing grace of the great
(interest of our cause); grant us both Weal and Deathlessness!

8\. We sacrifice to the entire collection of the Praises of the Yasna,
with the careful structure of their language which has reached the most
its object. And we offer (our homage) in our celebrations to Thy body, O
Ahura Mazda! the most beautiful of forms, these stars, and to that one,
the highest of the high \[(Pâzand) such as the sun was called\]. Yea, we
worship the Praises of the Yasna which were the production of the world
of old.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1272"></span>[306:1](sbe31063.htm#fr_1282) This piece in
the Gâthic dialect has claims to an antiquity as high as Y. XII. It
recalls the Gâthas in many ways. The increaser of cattle is identical
with the thrifty tiller, and is the typical saint.

<span id="fn_1273"></span>[306:2](sbe31063.htm#fr_1283) The Pahlavi has
sû*d* a partial transcription; but the word is obscure.

<span id="fn_1274"></span>[306:3](sbe31063.htm#fr_1284) See nipâtû.

<span id="fn_1275"></span>[306:4](sbe31063.htm#fr_1285) Nem*e* with K11.

<span id="fn_1276"></span>[306:5](sbe31063.htm#fr_1286) Hâ + ge*t*;

<span id="fn_1277"></span>[306:6](sbe31063.htm#fr_1287) 'Make mention
of.'

<span id="fn_1278"></span>[307:1](sbe31063.htm#fr_1288) Khshmâvatô is
often Gâthic for 'You.'

<span id="fn_1279"></span>[307:2](sbe31063.htm#fr_1289) Pâzand, as
fshûsh*e* is a plural, and not Gâthic. Or, 'we make men cattle-owners
(we invite them to be such).'

<span id="fn_1280"></span>[307:3](sbe31063.htm#fr_1290) The creation is
mentioned in connection with the Kine. The typical saint stands at the
head of the clean creation.

<span id="fn_1281"></span>[307:4](sbe31063.htm#fr_1291) Whose?

<span id="fn_1282"></span>[307:5](sbe31063.htm#fr_1292) See below.

<span id="fn_1283"></span>[307:6](sbe31063.htm#fr_1293) Root vi + dâ
(dhishâ); so also the Pahl. 'barâ dahi*s*nîh.'

<span id="fn_1284"></span>[307:7](sbe31063.htm#fr_1294) Akînîh va
âtashi*k* î Aûharmazd-dâ*d*. The word is difficult.

<span id="fn_1285"></span>[308:1](sbe31063.htm#fr_1295) Or, 'male and
female holy ones, (the Amesha).'

<span id="fn_1286"></span>[308:2](sbe31063.htm#fr_1296) Y. XXXIV, 7.

<span id="fn_1287"></span>[308:3](sbe31063.htm#fr_1297) Lit. 'may we be
closely beheld by the creative lights,' &c.

<span id="fn_1288"></span>[308:4](sbe31063.htm#fr_1298) Allusion to
maz*e*-y*a*unghô.
