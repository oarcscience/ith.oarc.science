### YASNA XXXIV.

1\. A tone of thankfulness continues. As if in gratitude for better
fortunes, the prophet declares that he will bestow upon Ahura with the
foremost, according to the measure of the gifts (which he has received.
Those gifts were the secured Immortality not mere temporal
'deathlessness'), the Righteous Order, and the Sovereign Power
established in holiness and bestowing the Universal Weal.

2\. The kind of gifts which are proposed for offerings are not
sacrificial beasts or fruits, but the actions of the truly pious citizen
whose soul is intimately united with Righteousness, the homage of
prayer, and the songs of praise. As no piety could exist without strict
ecclesiastical regularity, so no ceremonial punctuality was conceived of
apart from honour and charity (see verse 5 and Ya*s*t XXII).

3\. Accordingly the meat-offering, the mention of which immediately
follows, is spoken of as offered with homage to the Righteous Order and
to the Divine Sovereignty for the benefit of all the sacred settlements,
in order to equip the wise man fully, and as a helpful blessing among
the Immortals themselves and their adherents.

4\. And the Fire is likewise mentioned, which was worshipped not so much
like Agni as the friendly god of the hearth and the altar, but more and
chiefly like Agni as the priest of the church.

Not unlike Agni, it is called upon both for inward spiritual strength
and for temporal blessings in various forms, together with vengeance
hurled very much as if in the form of a thunderbolt (zastâ-i*s*tâi*s*
dere*s*tâ-aênanghem). 5. To explain what he means by his supplications
for the coming of the Kingdom, and for holy actions (that is, to make it
certain that he does not mean punctilious ritualism apart from the
noblest charity), he rhetorically asks: ‘And what is Your Kingdom, that
which Zarathu*s*tra establishes and offers to You? (XXXIII, 14). What is
the kind of prayer (comp. XLVIII, 8, and LIII, 1) which I must use, so
that I may become Yours (Your property) in my actions, not to load Your
priesthood with sacrifices, nor to fatten Your princes with booty (as
too often in the *Ri*ks), nor yet to secure a heavy gift to the poet,
but to 'nourish Your poor?' This was the essence of the desired Sanctity
and the Sovereign Authority. The Kingdom of God, exalted

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

and personified as a separate intelligence, is positively said to be
something more than a gaudy pageant of material display, even Tavâ
Khshathrem yâ ere*z*i*g*yôi dâhî drigavê vahyô (LIII, 9). (See also even
Vendîdâd II \[part i\], where moral duties are lauded.)

And the composer himself seems to be so conscious of the sharply defined
difference between such a kingdom and that of the rival religion, that
he immediately adds an interdict: 'Such is Your Kingdom, caring for the
righteous poor, and therefore we declare You irreconcilably distinct
from the Daêvas and their polluted followers. Ye are beyond them and
before in the spirit of Your Reign!'

6\. He then utters an impressive doubt, which only deepens our
admiration at his expressions of faith: 'If it be really true,' he
continues (see XLIV, 6), 'that Ye are thus with the Righteous Order and
the Good Mind, the God who looks upon the goodness of the heart and the
activity of the hands, then give me a sign of it, that I may persevere
and increase in the depth of my homage while life shall last.' 7. For
the struggle, though not without signs of a favourable issue, was far
from over yet. (Hence his misgivings.)

He then asks with some wistfulness after the 'ar(e)drâ,' the men that
could help, who from the experience of the grace of God, could turn
sorrow into blessing by establishing the holy religious system firmly,
but with enlarged and not narrowed understanding. And, still a little
dispirited, he declares, as so often: 'None have I other than You;
therefore I can wait for the ar(e)drâ. Do ye save us alone by Your
already offered means of grace.'

8\. 'For Ye have given me already, as it were, a sign. The enemy are
checked, and for the moment cowed, if they are not repelled. They among
whom there was death for so many when they had the upper hand, and when
their ruler persecuted the holy vows are not only struck with terror by
the action which we take, but their chief retribution is, as we hold it,
spiritual, and therefore, in the eye of truth the more severe. They will
not encourage righteous Order and righteous intentions, and accordingly,
the personified Good Intention, grieved, will depart from them.'

9\. 'Yea,' he reiterates, amplifying, 'the unfortunate sinners who
depart from Thy kindly and sacred Piety in this ignorance of all
experience of Thy Good Mind, will suffer an equal desertion. The
characteristics of righteousness will, in their turn, avoid them as the
unclean creatures flee from us.' 10. 'And this is,' thus he continues,
'a sign or result which the All-wise declares to me to steady my soul as
I waver.' 'And these are indeed the cheering proofs of Thy favour,' he
adds, addressing Ahura, 'which terrify our enemies

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

and advance us, giving us a righteous eminence (XXXIII, 14) in Thy
Kingdom.'

11\. 'Therefore that kindly Piety whom these desert in their judicial
ignorance, will increase for us both the all-comprehensive blessings;
spiritual Deathlessness begun in anticipation here, and its necessary
condition, Welfare. And they shall be increased as food (sic) for
Mazda's straitened people, or better, to His glory as their monarch. And
by their means Ahura may defend Himself efficiently from the persecuting
and idolatrous foe.' 12. Taking into consideration all that depends on a
correct understanding as to religious and political duties, he fervently
prays to be guided aright in the establishment of a ceremonial and of
praises, beseeching Mazda to speak, declaring the kind of worship which
may secure the ashis (which are the blessed rewards). And he asks to be
taught those religious paths about which no error was possible, the
paths which are the Good Mind's own.

13\. After a fashion already known to us (as in XXIX), he answers his
question himself. That way which Ahura had already revealed as the Good
Mind's own, was made up of the revealed precepts of the Saoshya*n*ts.
There, as in the paths where Ahura dwells (XXXIII, 5; XLVI, 16), the
well-doer may prosper from his devotion to the religious truths, and
gain a reward immediately from the hand of God. 14. As if never
forgetting the original calamity, the woes of the Kine, he further
declares that way to be the one of all to be chosen for this earthly
life, as the vestibule to the heavenly one. And he asserts that they who
toil for the Kine (who represents here, as generally, the holy
settlements as well as their chief source of riches and support) are
striving to further and demonstrate the wisdom of that way by every
righteous contrivance.

Nay, he declares that the deeds of Piety are themselves the highest
wisdom, just as the words and righteous actions of the Saoshya*n*ts not
only declare and make, but constitute, 'the way.'

15\. Again, concluding with a climacteric and synoptical prayer, he
beseeches Ahura to speak and reveal to him all the most available
statements, ceremonies, and praises. And never forgetting that all
ceremonies, hymns, and sacrifices, sacred as they are, are only means to
a greater end; he prays the Deity that He may exert that Sovereign Power
which is alone supremely efficient in relieving actual distress (LIII,
9), for by its holy laws and spiritual arms it can alone bring on the
Frashakar*d*, and produce that condition in society in which all human
progress shall have become complete.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

Translation.

1\. As to those (three gifts of blessings), Immortality, the Righteous
Order, and the (established) Kingdom of Welfare, which Thou, O Mazda!
hast given through (holy) deeds, words, and the sacrifice unto these
(Thy servants here in my sight <span id="fr_407"></span>[1](#fn_406).md),
gifts (shall) be offered <span id="fr_408"></span>[2](#fn_407.md) by us in
return to Thee, O Ahura! and with the foremost of them all.

2\. Yea, and all those gifts of the Good Spirit <span
id="fr_409"></span>[3](#fn_408) have been given (back in gratitude.md) to
Thee by the mind and the deed of the bountiful man, whose soul goes hand
in hand <span id="fr_410"></span>[4](#fn_409.md) with the Righteous Order
in the settlement, in homage toward the One like You <span
id="fr_411"></span>[5](#fn_410.md),

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O Mazda! and with
the chants of the (thankful) praisers <span
id="fr_412"></span>[1](#fn_411.md).

3\. And unto Thee, O Ahura! will we offer the (thankful) meat-offering
with self-humbling praise, and to Thy Righteousness (like Thee a
person), and for all the settlements in Thy kingdom which are
guarded <span id="fr_413"></span>[2](#fn_412.md) by Thy Good Mind. For in
the perfect preparation of the justly acting (has that offering its
power), O Mazda! together with all (others of its kind). Among those
like You and worthy of Yourselves, it is a blessing <span
id="fr_414"></span>[3](#fn_413.md).

4\. And we pray likewise for Thy Fire, O Ahura! strong through
Righteousness (as it is), most swift, (most) powerful, to the house with
joy receiving it, in many wonderful ways our help, but to the hater, O
Mazda! it is a steadfast <span id="fr_415"></span>[4](#fn_414.md) harm as
if with weapons hurled from the hands <span
id="fr_416"></span>[5](#fn_415.md).

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

5\. What is <span id="fr_417"></span>[1](#fn_416.md) then Your Kingdom, O
Mazda? What are Your riches? that I may become <span
id="fr_418"></span>[2](#fn_417.md) Your own in my actions, with the
Righteous Order, and (Thy) Good Mind, to care for Your poor (in their
suffering <span id="fr_419"></span>[3](#fn_418).md). Apart from all would
we declare You, yea, apart from Daêvas <span
id="fr_420"></span>[4](#fn_419.md), and Khrafstra-polluted mortals!

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

6\. If thus Ye are in verity, O Mazda! with the Righteous Order and Thy
Good Mind, then grant Ye me a sign <span id="fr_421"></span>[1](#fn_420.md)
of this in this world's entire abiding <span
id="fr_422"></span>[2](#fn_421) (while I live amid its scenes.md), how
offering sacrifice and praising <span id="fr_423"></span>[3](#fn_422.md)
You the more devoutly <span id="fr_424"></span>[4](#fn_423.md), I may
approach You (in my worship)!

7\. Where <span id="fr_425"></span>[5](#fn_424.md) are Thine offerers, O
Mazda! Thy helpers, who as the enlightened of the Good Mind are
producing the doctrines with wide mental light as inherited treasures,
(delivering them as Thy word) in misfortune and in woe <span
id="fr_426"></span>[6](#fn_425.md)? I know none other than You; then do Ye
save us through Your righteousness!

8\. Through these our deeds (of sacrifice and zeal <span
id="fr_427"></span>[7](#fn_426).md), they are terrified <span
id="fr_428"></span>[8](#fn_427) among whom there was (once.md) destruction,
and for many (at the time) when the

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

oppressor of Thy holy vows was as the stronger oppressing the
weaker <span id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_428.md). They who have not thought
(in consonance) with Thy Righteous Order, from these Thy Good Mind <span
id="fr_430"></span>[2](#fn_429.md) abideth afar.

9\. Aye, they who desert Thy bountiful Piety, O Mazda! that one desired
of Thee <span id="fr_431"></span>[3](#fn_430.md), O Thou omniscient! and
who thus abandon her by reason of the evil-doer, and in their ignorance
of (Thy) Good Mind, from such as these (Âramaiti) with her holiness
utterly departs <span id="fr_432"></span>[4](#fn_431.md) as the red
Khrafstras (who destroy and pollute all life, flee) from us <span
id="fr_433"></span>[5](#fn_432) (Thy faithful servants.md).

10\. Through the action of this (His) Good Mind (as he works his grace
within us) the benevolently wise <span id="fr_434"></span>[6](#fn_433.md)
One declared a result as its fruit, He knowing the bountiful Piety, the
creatrix of righteous beings <span id="fr_435"></span>[7](#fn_434.md).
These all, O Mazda Ahura! in Thy Kingdom (are

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'helps to our
progress') for they smite (our tyrants) with fear <span
id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_435.md).

11\. And for Thee hath Âramaiti (who is Our Piety) increased both the
Universal Weal and (its continuance in) Immortality, and (with them as
ever united) the Righteous (ritual and moral) Order (established and
made firm) in the Kingdom of (Thy Good Mind). Those powerful lasting two
(hath she increased) to (give us the needful) food <span
id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_436.md). And through these, O Mazda! art Thou
with Thy perfect expellers of hate <span
id="fr_438"></span>[3](#fn_437.md). (Thou removest Thy foes afar <span
id="fr_439"></span>[4](#fn_438)!.md)

12\. What then are Thy regulations <span
id="fr_440"></span>[5](#fn_439.md)? And what wilt Thou? What of praise, or
of (fuller) offering? Speak forth that we hear it, O Mazda! what will
establish the blessed rewards of Thine ordinance <span
id="fr_441"></span>[6](#fn_440.md)!

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Teach Thou us the
paths through Righteousness, those verily trod by (Thy) Good Mind <span
id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_442.md) as he lives within Thy saints <span
id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_443.md).

13\. (Do I ask what is that path?) That way which Thou declarest to me
as the path of the Good Mind, O Ahura! (is made <span
id="fr_445"></span>[3](#fn_444) in its parts by.md) the religious precepts
and laws of the Saviours, wherein the well-doer thrives <span
id="fr_446"></span>[4](#fn_445) from (his.md) Righteousness <span
id="fr_447"></span>[5](#fn_446.md). And it marks for the good a reward of
which Thou art Thyself the bestower.

14\. For that (reward), O Mazda! ye have given as the one to be chosen
for (our) bodily <span id="fr_448"></span>[6](#fn_447.md) life through

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

the deeds of Thy Good Mind (in us). They who work in the toil of the
mother <span id="fr_449"></span>[1](#fn_448.md). Kine, these further <span
id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_449.md) Your merciful care through the
understanding's action <span id="fr_451"></span>[3](#fn_450.md), and
(taught) by Thine Order's (word) <span id="fr_452"></span>[4](#fn_451.md).

15\. Yea, (show me, O Mazda! that path and its reward); tell me the best
(of truths); reveal the best words and best actions, and the
confessing <span id="fr_453"></span>[5](#fn_452.md) prayer of the praiser
through Thy Good Mind (living within us); and through the Righteous
Order, O Ahura! And by Your Sovereign Power and grace may’st Thou make
life really progressive <span id="fr_454"></span>[6](#fn_453.md) (till
perfection shall have been reached)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_406"></span>[83:1](sbe31012.htm#fr_407.md) The hymns seem to
be all composed for public declamation, as is evident from various
passages. Similar indications often occur in the Veda. I formerly
connected aêshãm with Ameretatâ*t*, &c., 'a thank-offering for these
(gifts).'

<span id="fn_407"></span>[83:2](sbe31012.htm#fr_408.md) I am very sorry to
oppose progress on such a subject as dastê, but I do not think that it
is an infinitive, nor that âitê or mrûitê are such. -Tê, or what it
represents, I regard as seldom or never a Gâthic suffix, and especially
not, as here, where dastê falls to the end of the sentence. Too little
attention has been paid to the Gâthic sentence. The infinitive seldom
falls to the end of it; vîdvanôi vao*k*â; ta*t* môi vî*k*idyâi vao*k*â;
vîduyê (vîdvê) vohû mananghâ; me*nk*â daidyâi yêhyâ mâ rishis; ashâ
fradathâi asperezatâ; â*g*ôi (?) hâdrôyâ; y*e* a*k*i*s*tem vaênanghê
aogedâ; but zbayâ avanghânê (?) yâ verezyêidyâi ma*n*tâ vâstryâ;
srûidyâi Mazdâ frâvao*k*â; kahmâi vîvîduyê (-vê) vashî; ta*t*
verezyêidyâi hya*t* môi mraotâ vahi*s*tem; arethâ vôizhdyâi kâmahyâ
t*e*m môi dâtâ; dazdyâi hâkerenâ; but vasmî anyâ*k*â vîduyê (-vê);
m*en*dâidyâi yâ Tôi Mazdâ âdi*s*ti*s*, &c. The Pahlavi renders here with
admirable freedom as a first person, yehabûnêm.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[83:3](sbe31012.htm#fr_409.md) Observe this
expression. It is the spe*n*ta mainyu which, like the 'Holy Spirit of
God,' is sometimes identical with Him.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[83:4](sbe31012.htm#fr_410.md) Souls are elsewhere
said to go hand in hand; see Y. XXXIII, 9.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[83:5](sbe31012.htm#fr_411.md) I suppose that it
is possible that khshmâvatô, here and elsewhere, may refer to the human
subject, 'to the praise of your worshipper,' <span id="page_84">p.
84</span> but it does not sound at all natural. I think that khshmâvatô
is merely another way of saying 'of you,' as mava*n*t = me. So the
Pahlavi also seems to render here: Avô zak î lekûm va nîyâyî*s*nŏ. Ner.
also: Samâga*kkh*âmi yushmâkam namask*ri*taye, Mahâ*gñ*ânin.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[84:1](sbe31012.htm#fr_412.md) This recalls the
dasemê-stûtãm of Y. XXVIII, 10.

The Pahlavi renders freely and not uncritically, regarding the spe*n*ta
nar as Zarathu*s*tra himself: Aftânŏ dên Garô*d*mânŏ stâyem. Ner.:
Garothmâne staumi te.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[84:2](sbe31012.htm#fr_413.md) So also the
translations: Aîgha*s* parvari*s*n va min frarûnîh. Ner.: Uttamena
pratipâlyâ manasâ. Compare Y. XXXII, 2: sâremanŏ khshathrâ*t*. The
singular verb is difficult.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[84:3](sbe31012.htm#fr_414.md) Or, 'for as those
justly acting, and in preparation will we offer it as a blessing
together with all who are among "Your own."' Here khshmâva*n*t equals
'Your own'; rather than 'Yourselves.'

<span id="fn_414"></span>[84:4](sbe31012.htm#fr_415.md) Or 'visible' as
fire, but this seems too feeble a conception for the place. The Pahlavi
translator read dere*s*tâ as a participle from dar(e)z, which is quite
as possible as that it should be from dar(e)s. He renders yakhsenunê*d*
kînŏ; Ner., vidadhâti nigraham. That he so translated because he was not
aware that dere*s*tâ could be also a participle from dar(e)s, is no
longer tenable.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[84:5](sbe31012.htm#fr_416.md) As by no means a
partially selected specimen, let the reader <span id="page_85">p.
85</span> consider the following from the Pahlavi: Thus, O Aûharmazd!
this which is Thy Fire, which is so powerful, is a satisfaction to him
whose is Aharâyîh \[-when my chieftain (the glossist seeming to have a
text with a first pronoun; otherwise the first translator who never saw?
us(e)mahî) becomes one by whom duty and charity are fulfilled\], for it
is quick and powerful \[the Fire\], and remains continually in
friendship with him, and makes joy manifest to him. And therefore, O
Aûharmazd I on him who is the tormentor it takes revenge as if with a
mighty wish.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[85:1](sbe31012.htm#fr_417.md) Ka*t* is often a
mere interrogative particle, so modern interrogatives are also often
merely formal.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[85:2](sbe31012.htm#fr_418.md) Bartholomae
admirably follows K4 here with its hakhmî; it gives a more common
explanation of vâo, which I am obliged to take in a possessive sense
beside n*e*. The manuscript used by the Pahlavi writer had, however,
ahmî, as many others now extant.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[85:3](sbe31012.htm#fr_419.md) Note the recurrence
of this care for the poor, showing what the frequent mention of
righteousness, the good mind, &c. meant.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[85:4](sbe31012.htm#fr_420.md) Observe that
daêvâi*s* must mean the Demon-gods and not their worshippers here;
par*e* vâo indicates this, and also mashyâi*s* = men, who are separately
mentioned. The Pahlavi translator is finely critical here, giving us our
first hint as to the meaning: Pêsh Lekûm min harvisp-gûnŏ levînŏ gûft
hômanê*d* \[aîgh tûbânkar*d*ar hômanê*d*, &c.\]. So with antare-mrûyê
(-vê), he was the pioneer also. I render with impartiality: Which (of
what kind) is your sovereignty? \[that is, what thing can I do, whereby
your sovereignty may be increased through my instrumentality?\] And
which is your wealth? \[that is, what thing shall I do whereby riches
may be kept in your possession by my means?\] How thus in the actions of
Aûharmazd shall I become yours? \[That is, I (?) shall do that thing
through which, by my means, your sovereignty is extended; and also
wealth is kept in your possession by me.\] For whenever I (?) shall do
righteous deeds, \[that is, when I (?) shall do duty and good works\],
Vohûman gives nourishment to our poor. Before all of every kind, even
before them ye are <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> declared; \[that is,
ye are more capable\] than the demons, for their (?) intellect is
perverted, (and ye are also before) men.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[86:1](sbe31012.htm#fr_421.md) So also the Pahlavi
dakh*s*ak.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[86:2](sbe31012.htm#fr_422.md) So indicated by
ketrûnânî. I have no doubt whatever that maêthâ should have this sense.
See also Y. XXX, 9.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[86:3](sbe31012.htm#fr_423.md) So also the
Pahlavi: Pavan âfrînagânŏ dahi*s*nŏ va stâyi*s*nŏ sâtûnam madam.

<span id="fn_423"></span>[86:4](sbe31012.htm#fr_424.md) Urvâidyâo, if in
its original form, looks like a comparative. One naturally thinks of a
\*vrâd (?) equivalent to 'v*ri*dh.'

<span id="fn_424"></span>[86:5](sbe31012.htm#fr_425.md) Rhetorically
interrogative as often in English, or indeed a mere particle. (Compare
XLVI, 9.)

<span id="fn_425"></span>[86:6](sbe31012.htm#fr_426.md) So also the Pahlavi
indicates with its âmûkhti*s*nŏ (sic) î hûvari*s*nŏ \[î avŏ kâr va
kirfak\], mûni*k* pavan âsânîh va mûni*k* pavan tangîh vâdûnyên
frâkh-hushîh. Ner.: *S*ikshâm satyiya ya*h* samâdhânatve,
sa*m*ka*t*atve\* ’pi kurute vipula*k*aitanya*h* \[kila, ya*h* kârya*m*
pu*n*ya*m* yat sam*ri*ddhatayâ kurute\] ta*kk*a yat sa*m*ka*t*atayâ ’pi
kurute, tasya vi*gñ*âna*k*aitanya*m* tasmâd bhavati.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[86:7](sbe31012.htm#fr_427.md) Nâo being taken in
a possessive sense.

<span id="fn_427"></span>[86:8](sbe31012.htm#fr_428.md) But the Pahlavi
has: 'Min zak î valman*s*ân maman kûni*s*nŏ lanman bîm'; possibly 'by
these actions they terrify us'; the middle in the sense of the active.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[87:1](sbe31012.htm#fr_429.md) It is a mistake to
suppose that the Pahlavi translator and his followers, Ner. and the
Persian MS. (of Haug's Collection), refer nâidy*a*unghem and nade*n*tô
to the same Sanskrit word. They translate them as if referring the first
to nâdh, and the last to nid.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[87:2](sbe31012.htm#fr_430.md) Min valman*s*ân
barâ rakhîk aîtŏ Vohûman. Asmanô seems an impossible reading, and cannot
be reconciled with Vohû.

<span id="fn_430"></span>[87:3](sbe31012.htm#fr_431.md) The hint of the
Pahlavi points, as usual, to the general sense, leaving us the task of
discovering the grammatical structure.

Here I do not follow the indication of sedkûnyên; Ner. parikshipyanti.
The voc. 'O Thou' is free.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[87:4](sbe31012.htm#fr_432.md) So also in general
the Pahlavi: Min valman*s*ân kabed Aharâyîh se*g*dak; Ner. tebhya*h*\*
prabhuto dharma*h*\* prabhra*s*yati.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[87:5](sbe31012.htm#fr_433.md) So if ahma*t* is
read, but the MS. before the Pahlavi translator read ahmât; Ner.
etebhya*h* (freely). A simpler rendering results; 'as from him flee
away.'

<span id="fn_433"></span>[87:6](sbe31012.htm#fr_434.md) Observe the
evidence of the Zend to the prevalent meaning of 'khratu.'

<span id="fn_434"></span>[87:7](sbe31012.htm#fr_435.md) Or reading hithãn,
and in the sense of 'bond,' we coincide with Ner. sukhanivâsam. Haithãm
= the true; hâtãm? = of beings. Lit. 'the true creatrix of Asha (the
holy).'

<span id="fn_435"></span>[88:1](sbe31012.htm#fr_436.md) The word voyathrâ
is difficult to place; the Pahlavi translator divided, reading
âvo-yathrâ (possibly âvoi athrâ), and rendered frô*d* kûshî-aît = is
smitten down; the Persian better: Frôd zadar, is smiting down. We may
well hesitate before rejecting this indication, which may point to a
better text. Like vafu*s*, it may indicate the severity of the
influences of the righteous system, in the midst of genial allusion. The
tâ vîspâ might refer quite naturally to du*s*-*s*kayasthanâ in the
previous verse. The form voyathrâ (corrected) may represent some
derivative from the root bî = to fear. Compare bya*n*tê in verse 8.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[88:2](sbe31012.htm#fr_437.md) So likewise the
Pahlavi with its khûri*s*nŏ; otherwise 'for glory;' *hv*ar = svar. Lit.
'To Thee (are) both Weal and Immortality.'

<span id="fn_437"></span>[88:3](sbe31012.htm#fr_438.md) *G*avî*d* bêsh min
lak hômanih; Ner. vîtakash*t*as tva*m* asi.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[88:4](sbe31012.htm#fr_439.md) Ner.: Thus both are
(to be derived) from thee, Avirdâda's food, and that of Amirdâda also,
\[the (food) of the Lord-of-water, and of the Lord-of-wood <span
id="fr_442"></span>[\*](#fn_441) (so the later Avesta and Parsism.md)\],
and in the kingdom of the best mind, righteousness is making a
revelation together with the perfect mind. Do thou also bestow zeal and
power upon this one, O Great Wise One, the Lord! From torment art thou
exempt.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[88:5](sbe31012.htm#fr_440.md) So also
vîrâyi*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[88:6](sbe31012.htm#fr_441.md) Pahlavi ârâyi*s*nŏ.

<span id="fn_441"></span>[88:\*](sbe31012.htm#fr_442.md) Otherwise simply
'water and tree.'

<span id="fn_442"></span>[89:1](sbe31012.htm#fr_443.md) The Pahlavi has the
gloss: Teach us the way of the original religion.

<span id="fn_443"></span>[89:2](sbe31012.htm#fr_444.md) Neryosangh: Ki*m*
to sa*m*mâr*g*anam \[kila, kârya*m*, te ki*m* mahânyâyitara*m*?\] Ka*h*
kâma*h*? Kâ*k*a yushmâka*m* stuti*h*? Kâ*k*a yushmâka*m* i*g*isni*h*?
*Srin*omi, Mahâ*gñ*ânin! prak*ri*sh*t*a*m* brûhi! yat *k*etsi\*
dharmasya sa*m*mâr*g*ana*m*, \[aho viseshe*n*a pa*s*ya! tasmât
mahânyâyitarât kuru!\] *S*ikshâpaya\* asmâka*m* dharmasya mârga*m*
uttamena svâdhîna*m* manasâ. \[Mârga*m* ya*m* pûrvanyâyavanta*m*
asmabhya*m* brûhi.\]

<span id="fn_444"></span>[89:3](sbe31012.htm#fr_445.md) Observe the
certainty of a subtle meaning, 'the way *is* the consciences or laws.'

<span id="fn_445"></span>[89:4](sbe31012.htm#fr_446.md) Geldner has
admirably suggested a comparison with vra*g* on account of the
connection 'way.' But as this necessitates two urvâz = vrâz, and as
Ahura is spoken of as 'dwelling' in 'paths,' I do not think that
'thriving in paths' is very difficult. The prominent thought is not the
going, but the 'right going.' That path indicates a reward (so also the
Pahlavi *k*âshî*d*ŏ, Ner. âsvâdaya*h*). But we must be thankful for the
keen and vigorous discussion. Compare urvâkhshanguha gâya *g*ighaê*s*a.
The Pahlavi has hû-ravâkh-manîh and in Y. XLIV, 8. If vra*g* is
compared, the idea must be happy progress; but varh (Justi) seems the
more obvious correspondent.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[89:5](sbe31012.htm#fr_447.md) Asha, very often
personified, is a stronger expression than 'correctly:

<span id="fn_447"></span>[89:6](sbe31012.htm#fr_448.md) Of course our life
on earth, merely in the bodily state. Comp. Y. XXVIII, 3. There
astavatas*k*â evidently means 'of earth,' mananghô, 'of heaven' (—of
corporeal—of mind, without body).

<span id="fn_448"></span>[90:1](sbe31012.htm#fr_449.md) Or the 'mature,'
'drivable' (?) cow. She 'goes on her path' of toil.

<span id="fn_449"></span>[90:2](sbe31012.htm#fr_450.md) So frâz yehabûn*d*.

<span id="fn_450"></span>[90:3](sbe31012.htm#fr_451.md) Observe that
vere*ze*nâ cannot well mean 'stall' in this line. The Pahlavi likewise
sees varzî-aît in it; Ner. vidhîyate, both free as to form.

<span id="fn_451"></span>[90:4](sbe31012.htm#fr_452.md) Neryosangh: Sa
yato, Mahâ*gñ*ânin! kâmo ’smâka*m* yat tanumate *g*îvamate dîyate
\[â*k*âryâya\], uttamena karma*n*e manasâ \[khshatriyâya\], ya*sk*a
gavâ\* â*k*ârayitre\* A*g*inâmnyâ, \[ku*t*umbine\], yo yushmâka*m*
sunirvâ*n*a*gñ*ânatayâ, Svâmin! buddhyâ*k*a, pu*n*yapradattayâ vidhîyate
\[dîni*h*\]

<span id="fn_452"></span>[90:5](sbe31012.htm#fr_453.md) I concede this
shade of meaning to the constant and unvarying evidence of the Pahlavi
translator. He translates uniformly by avâm yehabûnê*d* or its
equivalents.

<span id="fn_453"></span>[90:6](sbe31012.htm#fr_454.md) Bring on
'millennial' perfection when progress shall have been completed.

The Pahlavi translation is as follows: Pavan zak î lekûm
khû*d*âyîh-Aûharmazd! frashakar*d*ŏ pavan kâmakŏ âshkârakŏ dên ahvânŏ
yehabûnî-aît.

Ner.: Yushmâkam râ*g*yena, Svâmin! akhshayatvam sve*kkh*ayâ
parisphu*t*a*m* dâsyate bhuvane.
