### YASNA LVI (SP. LV).

#### INTRODUCTION TO THE SRÔSH YA*S*T.

1\. Let Sraosha (the listening Obedience) be present here for the
worship of Ahura Mazda, the most beneficent, and holy, of him) who is
desired by us as at the first, so at the last; and so again may
attentive Obedience be present here for the worship of Ahura Mazda, the
most beneficent and the holy who (is so) desired by us.

2\. (Yea), let Sraosha (the attentive Obedience) be present here for the
worship of the good waters, and for the Fravashis of the saints which
are so desired by us, \[and for (their <span
id="fr_1243"></span>[1](#fn_1233)) souls\], as at the first, so at the
last.

And thus again may Sraosha (the listening Obedience) be present here for
the worship of the good waters, and for the Fravashis of the saints,
which are so desired by us, \[(and) for (their) souls\].

3\. Let Sraosha (the listening Obedience) be present here for the
worship of the good waters; yea, let the good Obedience be here for the
worship of the good and bountiful Immortals who rule aright, and dispose
(of all) aright, the good, and for the worship of the good Sanctity, or
Blessedness, who is closely knit with the Righteous Order, to perfect
us, and to incite us. May Sraosha (Obedience) be here present for the
worship of the good waters, he the good and the holy <span
id="fr_1244"></span>[2](#fn_1234), as at the first, so at the last.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

4\. And so again may Sraosha, (Obedience) the good, be present here for
the worship of the good waters, and of the good <span
id="fr_1245"></span>[1](#fn_1235) and bountiful Immortals, and of
Blessedness the good who is closely knit with the Righteous Order to
perfect and to incite us <span id="fr_1246"></span>[2](#fn_1236). Yea,
we worship Sraosha the blessed and the stately, who smites with victory,
and who furthers the settlements in their advance, the holy lord of the
ritual order <span id="fr_1247"></span>[3](#fn_1237).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1233"></span>[296:1](sbe31061.htm#fr_1243) One might be
inclined to render 'who are so desired by us for our souls.' But I think
that the words are Pâzand to the preceding.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[296:2](sbe31061.htm#fr_1244) Or, 'endowed
with recompense.'

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[297:1](sbe31061.htm#fr_1245) Of the female
(feminine) names.

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[297:2](sbe31061.htm#fr_1246) Or, 'give to
us.' The Ahuna and Ashem Vohû follow here.

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[297:3](sbe31061.htm#fr_1247) The YêNhê hâtãm,
&c. follows.
