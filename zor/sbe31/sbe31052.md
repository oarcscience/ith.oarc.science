### YASNA XXXVII.

#### TO AHURA, THE HOLY CREATION, THE FRAVASHIS OF THE JUST, AND THE BOUNTIFUL IMMORTALS.

1\. Thus therefore do we worship Ahura Mazda, who made the Kine (the
living creation), and the (embodied) Righteousness (which is incarnate
in the clean), and the waters, and the wholesome plants, the stars, and
the earth, and all (existing) objects

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

that are good. 2. Yea, we worship Him for His Sovereign Power and His
greatness, beneficent (as they are), and with priority among the
Yazads <span id="fr_1201"></span>[1](#fn_1191) who abide beside the Kine
(and care for her protection and support).

3\. And we worship Him under His name as Lord, to Mazda dear, the most
beneficent (of names). We worship him with our bones, and with our
flesh, (with our bodies and our life). And we worship the <span
id="fr_1202"></span>[2](#fn_1192) Fravashis of the saints, of holy men,
and holy women; (4.) and Righteousness the Best do we worship, the most
beauteous, the Bountiful Immortal and that which is endowed with light
in all things good.

5\. And we worship the Good Mind (of the Lord), and His Sovereign Power,
and the Good Faith, the good law of our thrift, and Piety the ready mind
(within Thy folk)!

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1191"></span>[286:1](sbe31052.htm#fr_1201) Or, 'with the
priority in the Yasnas, (we who are they) who abide.'

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[286:2](sbe31052.htm#fr_1202) T*e*m is
interpolated; or shall we render: 'We worship Him' as in the F. with
adverbial use as in the Greek, and often here?
