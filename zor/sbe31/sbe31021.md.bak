### THE GÂTHA(Â) VOHÛ KHSHATHREM

### (VOHUKHSHATHRA(Â)).

This Gâtha consists of the single chapter Y. LI. It has lines of
fourteen syllables with caesura in the middle.

### YASNA LI.

#### INSTRUCTIONS AND APPEALS TO AN ASSEMBLY OF THE FAITHFUL.

It is hardly possible that we have here a continuous whole. The
thoughts, however, harmonise well enough, and the changes give little
trouble. 1. As so often the Sovereign Authority of Ahura, His reign over
the hearts and in the minds of His faithful worshippers, is the leading
theme. That sovereign Power, when it is established, will produce every
good thing with it, and repress every evil, and the composer prays that
he may never pause at any moment in his efforts to bring that kingdom
on. 2. Accordingly, as the foremost of objects, he beseeches for both
its blessings and its protection, and names Âramaiti as the especial
representative of Ahura in this case to grant the Kingdom as a Realm
established in spiritual wealth, and whose first effect should be the
glory of God through the agency of holy dispositions in men.

3\. The spirit of the Daêna is public and prophetic rather than occult
and mysterious. The people therefore gather to hear Gâthas recited, and
religious harangues delivered as on political occasions, and all the
more because the Mãthras are declared to be the results of direct
inspiration from Ahura. 4. The present recitations are invocations
calling for the four energising Immortals, the guiding Order, the active
Piety, the inspiring Benevolence, and the Power-wielding Kingdom, and,
in using these names, the multitude are also beseeching, by the voice of
their spokesman, for the Ratu, the Saoshya*n*t cried for by the Kine,
looked for by Asha himself, and promised by Ahura.

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

5\. And the men who press this prayer are, each of them, for the moment
(nû*k*î*t*), as the Ratu himself. Wise in his homage, he seeks to gain
the kine, like the ideal husbandman, both as property and as emblem, and
he desires to establish the Ratu, understood as a person, or as the law,
which may judge between the two sides (Y. XXXI, 2), and, by the
expulsion of the evil, give quiet to the land (Y. XLVI, 4; Y. LIII, 9).
6. Declaring Ahura to be the awarder of the highest good and deepest
evil, (7) he calls on Him to grant the 'eternal two,' the rewarding
Immortals (not named in the former verse), but only by means of the
inspired teachings. 8. And as these inculcations are effective for
himself, he will declare forth their threats and promises to others,
being repaid for his zealous fidelity in the very act. 9. Recalling the
hopes of vengeance, he beseeches Ahura to give forth a sign, or
instrument, from the holy Fire, which may settle the disputes by the
forged blade of justice. 10. For he declares that the man who
murderously assaults his adherents in the opposing interest (see Y.
XXXII, 10, &c.) is inherently and originally perverted in his motives, a
very son of the Lie, and of the seed of Akôman.

11\. While in terms he addresses Ahura, he in reality challenges the
devotion of the chieftains, as he calls aloud to the Deity.

12\. Here a temptation of Zarathu*s*tra is narrated, as in the Vendîdâd,
here dwelling on his youth, there on his maturer manhood. But the verse
shows marked signs of later age.

13\. And the soul of the righteous is encouraged by the recorded
example; he shall come off the conqueror, as Zarathu*s*tra did.

14\. But the Karpans (priestly chiefs?) of the opposing party, following
the typical destroyer (as in Y. XXXII), would bring the world to ruin,
and the creatures to Hell.

15\. The true disciples will however infallibly receive the promised
recompense.

16\. And as for that *K*isti, conceived by Mazda to give the saving
knowledge in the sacred verse, the King of the Realm had acquired it. It
will be stored in the memory of faithful priests under his care and
rule; and he will give his subjects a good worship (Y. XLIX, 7) in
accordance with it. 17. A female saint, also illustrious in rank, is
celebrated with honourable mention; she is, as it were, the *K*isti in
her person, as she is named in this connection.

18\. Another devoted friend arrests the speaker's eye, as he stands in
the assembly; (59) and still another. 20. Then, as if taking in all with
his view, and with an expression which shows

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

his identification with the people, he declares that the 'Archangels'
are of one mind with Mazda in bestowing spiritual blessings, the chief
of which are inspired words, the source of their discipline, and the
guide of their hopes.

21\. And with assurances as to the greatness of the spiritual blessings
implied in all that he has said, he prays Ahura all the more earnestly
to grant them to His elect. 22. And he declares that Ahura knows and
observes the man who fulfils every command that he has uttered, as well
as believes every doctrine which he has divulged, and that, knowing Him,
He also marks Him as the object of His grace. And he ends by expressing
once more his desire to approach the Bountiful Immortals, not as naming
them alone, but naming them, as we may well suppose, with a full
appreciation of all that is meant by the sacred words which belong to
them as names.

Translation.

1\. The good Government (of Ahura <span id="fr_787"></span>[1](#fn_785).md)
is to be chosen (among all wished-for things <span
id="fr_788"></span>[2](#fn_786).md) as that lot which most of all brings on
(our happiness). Actions that oppress us it opposes <span
id="fr_789"></span>[3](#fn_787.md), through the holy Order (which pervades
it), and with the pious zeal (of its true servants). Therefore, O Great
Creator! let me

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

produce, and help bring on (that Sovereign Power) which is the best for
us at every present hour.

2\. And first I will ask for <span id="fr_790"></span>[1](#fn_788.md) these
two blessings of Your own, O Thou Great Creator, and thou His Righteous
Order! and I also ask of thee, Our Piety (personified, as well); and
grant me this Your Sovereign Rule over our desired wealth (to give and
to preserve it; and likewise) those spiritual blessings which are
advantageous for our worship (of Ahura) through (the inspiration of His)
Good Mind (within the soul).

3\. (And it is not I alone who thus appeal to You; I speak for all) who
are guarded in the (ceremonial and moral) actions of Your (law), and by
those (inspired) words (which proceed) from the tongue of Thy Good Mind
(as he speaks within Thy Mãthra). Yea, these are all assembling (each)
to hear You, of whom Thou, O Ahura Mazda! art the foremost guide <span
id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_789.md) and light.

4\. (And they cry aloud to Thee, O Mazda! I speaking with them, and in
their name): Where is the (promised <span
id="fr_792"></span>[3](#fn_790).md) lord of our thrift (the embodied law,
saving us from the most dreaded dangers that we fear <span
id="fr_793"></span>[4](#fn_791), the thrift-lord) of (our.md) ready zeal?
Where

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

does he stand to (show us) mercy? Whither are (Thy) Righteousness and
the Bountiful Âramaiti (our Piety) approaching? From what direction
comes Thy Best Mind (to inspire and to guide)? And whence (again), O
Great Creator! Thy Sovereign Power (to be our ruler and defence <span
id="fr_794"></span>[1](#fn_792).md)?

5\. And it is the tiller of the earth who asks this of Thee, O Ahura!
(Thy chosen saint himself); he has asked this all of Thee, striving to
discover how he may gain to himself the sacred Kine (and with all wealth
in herds beside. And he would seek this) moved by the motives which flow
from Thy Righteous Order (and Thy cause), upright as he is in actions,
and wise in his self-humbling worship (of that <span
id="fr_795"></span>[2](#fn_793) One.md) who, as a righteous ruler, has
appointed a just controlling guide for those whom He has made.

6\. (And in partial answer to his question, and to solve his doubt, I
now declare the truth): He who gives to this (good citizen) that which
is better than the good <span id="fr_796"></span>[3](#fn_794.md); yea, He
who bestows on him in accordance with his religious choice is (our)
Ahura Mazda (and not

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

a false god of the Daêvas <span id="fr_797"></span>[1](#fn_795).md). And
this will He bestow through His divine Authority (established in
preparation here), while on the withholder of the sacrifice, who offers
nothing to His (cause), He will send worse than the evil (and that not
here alone, but) in the last turning of the creation in its course!

7\. (And as Thou wilt bestow thus graciously on him), so grant me also,
O Thou most bountiful Spirit Mazda, Thou who hast made both the Kine and
the waters and the plants <span id="fr_798"></span>[2](#fn_796.md) (for her
support) both Immortality and Welfare, those two eternal powers, and
through Thy Good Mind in the doctrine (which is revealed through his
inspired words <span id="fr_799"></span>[3](#fn_797).md).

8\. (Yea, grant me these two inseparable gifts, for having them in
store) I will speak for Thee, O Mazda! because to the man of
understanding <span id="fr_800"></span>[4](#fn_798.md) one should declare
for Thee that which is woe to the wicked, but salvation to him who has
maintained the holy Order (in Thy folk and in his soul). For he is
(repaid in his deed, and) rejoiced by the Mãthra who declares it to the
wise.

9\. (And when I shall speak, I will declare for You that mental)
keenness (which reaches the decision), and which Thou hast bestowed upon
the two striving sides <span id="fr_801"></span>[5](#fn_799.md), (in Thy
satisfying word). And this

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I will announce by
means of Thy flaming Fire; yea, I will declare it for the bestowal of
that sword of justice which is forged from steel <span
id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_800.md), and wrought for both the worlds <span
id="fr_803"></span>[2](#fn_801.md). And for the wounding of the wicked
(with its blade) may’st Thou <span id="fr_804"></span>[3](#fn_802.md), O
Ahura Mazda! bless and prosper Thine (avenging) saint <span
id="fr_805"></span>[4](#fn_803.md)!

10\. (Yea, let Thy believer wound the wicked to the quick), for he, who
totally estranged from this (our holy rule <span
id="fr_806"></span>[5](#fn_804).md), O Mazda! seeks to destroy my life, is
a son <span id="fr_807"></span>[6](#fn_805.md) of the Lie's creation, and
belongs to the miscreants; (but as for me), I call on Asha (Thy
Righteous Order to be my help); and may he come with Thy good blessing.

11\. (And ye who throng the great assembly <span
id="fr_808"></span>[7](#fn_806.md), it is of you I speak while, with my
lips, I now address the Lord): Who, O Ahura! is a loyal friend to the
Spitâma <span id="fr_809"></span>[8](#fn_807.md), to Zarathu*s*tra? Who has
asked his question of the divine Righteousness, (as he approached <span
id="fr_810"></span>[9](#fn_808).md)?

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> By whom is the
bounteous Piety (received and cherished)? Or who has been regarded as
upright and fitted for the great cause of Thy Good Mind?

12\. ('Who is worthy?' would I ask, for Zarathu*s*tra was ever such, and
from earliest days. He was no polluted wretch.) Paederast never gained
his ear, nor Kavi-follower on this (temptation-)bridge of earth, when
his body was (maturely) grown, when they both hasten(ed) to him with the
bosom's <span id="fr_811"></span>[1](#fn_809.md) impure power <span
id="fr_812"></span>[2](#fn_810.md).

13\. (And he will be likewise victorious on the veritable Judgment
Bridge, for) the righteous man's conscience will truly <span
id="fr_813"></span>[3](#fn_811) crush the wicked man's (spirit.md) while
his soul rages <span id="fr_814"></span>[4](#fn_812.md) fiercely on the
open *K*inva*t* Bridge <span id="fr_815"></span>[5](#fn_813.md), as he
strives by his actions, and his tongue's

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (cursing speech)
to reach <span id="fr_816"></span>[1](#fn_814) (and to pollute.md) Asha's
paths (where the faithful souls come).

14\. (And as are those lost spirits, so are our foes.) No friends to the
creatures <span id="fr_817"></span>[2](#fn_815.md) are the Karpans, (not
granting) complete (harvests) from the fields with complete (pasture)
for the Kine (chief objects for our prayer), bringing woe <span
id="fr_818"></span>[3](#fn_816.md) by their deeds and their teachings. And
they <span id="fr_819"></span>[4](#fn_817.md) will deliver these
(beings <span id="fr_820"></span>[5](#fn_818) whom they lead.md) at the
last (?) by their doctrine(s) in the Home of the Lie.

15\. But this is the reward which Zarathu*s*tra declared before (to his
friends who counsel with Asha), and are fitted for the cause <span
id="fr_821"></span>[6](#fn_819.md); Ahura Mazda will come the first <span
id="fr_822"></span>[7](#fn_820.md) into His Song Home, Garô*d*man,

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

and then these gifts will be given you by the Good Mind (within you),
and with blessings for the cause of the Righteous Order (in His hosts).

16\. (And one of you, the greatest, has indeed attained to that wisdom
which is thus blessed with a promise), Kavi Vî*s*tâspa has reached it in
the Realm of our great cause (of devotion <span
id="fr_823"></span>[1](#fn_821).md), and moved in his toil by the chants of
the Good Mind (who speaks in the Mãthra <span
id="fr_824"></span>[2](#fn_822).md); yea, he hath attained to that wisdom
which the bountiful Ahura conceived in accordance with Asha, thus to
teach us salvation.

17\. (And not alone amidst our princes hath sanctity been marked),
Frashao*s*tra, the Hvôgva, hath presented a blest and an endeared form
(his child <span id="fr_825"></span>[3](#fn_823).md); and may Ahura Mazda,
who has the Sovereign Power, grant her (to us), who is so much to be
beloved. And for the (progress of the) good Religion <span
id="fr_826"></span>[4](#fn_824.md) do ye, O ye people! receive her with
desire <span id="fr_827"></span>[5](#fn_825.md), and for the gaining of
Asha; (she will help the great cause).

18\. Yea, that (holy) wisdom, O *G*âmâspa the Hvôgva <span
id="fr_828"></span>[6](#fn_826)! these (pious throngs.md) are choosing
through

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

their Righteousness as the (true) splendours of riches (these pious men
who are) gaining the kingdom where the Good Mind (doth govern). And
grant me also, O Mazda! that which these with glad wishes <span
id="fr_829"></span>[1](#fn_827.md) receive from Thy grace <span
id="fr_830"></span>[2](#fn_828.md).

19\. (And this prayer is already and beforehand heard.) This established
Sovereign Power the heroic (Kavi Vî*s*tâspa has given), O Maidhyô-mâh
the Spitâma. He who is wise through the Religion, and who seeks (the
true) life, he is granting it to us <span
id="fr_831"></span>[3](#fn_829.md); yea, he has pronounced the laws of
Ahura our Maker, and declared that which is for (our) life's actions
(beyond all other things) best.

20\. And, that gift of blessedness for you, all (the Bountiful
Immortals) with one consent in sympathy to help us (are disposed <span
id="fr_832"></span>[4](#fn_830)) to grant; (and may they likewise make.md)
the Holy Order (firm) for us through the Good Mind (in our folk); and
may they reveal to us the words with which Piety likewise (speaks her
truths). And receiving sacrifice with homage (from our praises), may
they seek <span id="fr_833"></span>[5](#fn_831.md) for us Ahura Mazda's
grace.

21\. (Yea, this Kavi Vî*s*tâspa) the man of Âramaiti is bounteous, and
with understanding in his words and his actions. (And as a reward) may
Ahura give

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

him that Righteousness which is blest, (but) with the Religion (alone),
and that Sovereign Power which is established through the Good Mind (in
His folk). And this same blessing would I pray from His grace <span
id="fr_834"></span>[1](#fn_832.md).

22\. For Ahura Mazda knoweth the man whose best gift for the sacrifice
is given unto me, and from the motive of Righteousness; (and in
thankfulness for all, and in prayer for yet still further grace), I will
worship (the eternal ones); yea, I will worship those who have ever
lived, and who still live, and by their own (holy) names, and to their
(thrones <span id="fr_835"></span>[2](#fn_833).md) will I draw near with my
praise!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_785"></span>[178:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_787.md) It is far better
to take Khshathra in its usual and often necessary sense. And it is
especially desirable not to confound it with shôithra = kshétra.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[178:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_788.md) The choice one.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[178:3](sbe31021.htm#fr_789.md) One is somewhat
inclined to regard vîdushemnâi*s* as a monstrous form of vid, which has
crept into the text under the influence of the two words vîdushê in
verse 8, and owing to an attempt to fill out the metre, the original
word having been vîdemnâi*s*. The Pahlavi gives no indication except for
a form of dû = to give. Leaving the MSS. intact, I compare dush + vi.

I render as above on the principle that the text in the MSS. should not
be violated where it is possible to translate it at all. Reading
vîdemnâi*s* we might render, 'that kingdom's privileges are shared (it
is entered and penetrated) by men who act (by actions) in a manner to
further its security, (by actions gaining it).'

<span id="fn_788"></span>[179:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_790.md) I have rather
reluctantly read yê*k*â with long ê. Having in mind Y. XXX, 1, where
Sp.'s B. reads yaê*k*â, and reading yaê*k*â here, we might regain the
lost dual neuter of the pronoun here as in Y. XXX, 1, and so render,
'and which two things belong to thee, the possession (rule) of wealth
and the blessings.'

Roth, cited by Geldner, changes to ashayaê*k*â here and in Y. XXX, 1;
and it is certainly striking that ashâ yê*k*â should occur twice. I
render as above, first, as, nearer our MSS., and as affording a good
sense.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[179:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_791.md) See Y. XXXI, 17.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[179:3](sbe31021.htm#fr_792.md) See verse 5.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[179:4](sbe31021.htm#fr_793.md) See Y. XXIX, 1; Y.
XXXII.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[180:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_794.md) It is hardly
necessary to call attention to the fact that these abstracts are
personified here, as in so many other places in the Gâthas. We may
indeed doubt whether the idea of personification was ever wholly absent,
the original meaning being likewise never lost. Professor Wilhelm
prefers taking Ashem as an accusative, 'how does one (do they) come to
Asha?' This is admirable; but I am, on the whole, inclined to regard
Ashem as a nominative with fseratu*s*, Âr(a)maiti*s*, &c., taking the
plurals yasô *hv*y*e*n (hy*e*n) as irregularly extending to the other
subjects.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[180:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_795.md) So Wilhelm (by
letter), taking a form of the pronoun as understood. It is difficult to
suppose that the vâstrya could be referred to as appointing the Ratu
through the influence of his devotion and pious supplications; as
Wilhelm justly says, the third line must apply to Ahura.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[180:3](sbe31021.htm#fr_796.md) See Y. XLIII, 3;
notice ahmâi as referring to hôi.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[181:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_797.md) See Y. XXXI, 17
where the faith of the dregva*n*t is sufficiently recognised to form the
basis for a question, rhetorical indeed, but still a question.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[181:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_798.md) From this and
similar occurrences of the 'water and the plants' beside 'Immortality
and Welfare' probably arose the later peculiar identification of those
names with water and plants.

<span id="fn_797"></span>[181:3](sbe31021.htm#fr_799.md) Compare perhaps
verse 20.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[181:4](sbe31021.htm#fr_800.md) Otherwise; 'I will
speak for Thee, O Lord! for the (all)-wise one should speak.'

<span id="fn_799"></span>[181:5](sbe31021.htm#fr_801.md) Or, 'from the two
ara*n*i;' see notes on Y. XXXI, 3 and Y. XLIII, 12.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[182:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_802.md) Compare Y. XXXII,
7, *hv*aênâ ayanghâ (lit. iron).

Others see the ordeal of fire here, and the bath of melted metal from
which the righteous suffers nothing, but in which the sinner is
consumed, but râshayanghê seems to point to injury produced otherwise
than by dipping, and dakhshta certainly designates a metallic instrument
elsewhere; 'sign' is, however, the original meaning.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[182:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_803.md) So several times;
comp. Y. XXVIII, 3, where the depth is unmistakable; see also Y. XXXI,
18 with ahûbî*s* in the next verse.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[182:3](sbe31021.htm#fr_804.md) The Pahlavi while
not strictly correct, affords the indication of a causative,
sû*d*înê*d*.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[182:4](sbe31021.htm#fr_805.md) From this verse
probably arose the later association of khshathra-vairya and metal
founding and forging.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[182:5](sbe31021.htm#fr_806.md) As invoking Asha
is in the antithesis, I regard ashâ*t* as understood here. Ga*t* seems a
particle, but also not impossibly = gâ*t*. As it is twice followed by tê
(tôi), the interesting change is suggested to gatê, infin.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[182:6](sbe31021.htm#fr_807.md) Or a proper name.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[182:7](sbe31021.htm#fr_808.md) See the third
verse.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[182:8](sbe31021.htm#fr_809.md) See Y. XLVI, 9,
14.

<span id="fn_808"></span>[182:9](sbe31021.htm#fr_810.md) See the fourth
verse.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[183:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_811.md) Some other portion
of the human body, suggested by the context, may be meant by aodare*s*.
The word looks like a verbal form, 3rd pl., but see the preceding dual.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[183:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_812.md) I render the
Pahlavi of this most difficult verse as follows: Far from satisfying me
is the Kîk, the paederast, in regard to both of the two particulars
\[food and clothing\] on the path of winter; (far from satisfying me)
who am Zartûsht, the Spîtâman, with whom he is; that is, (or 'where') he
incites me with his incitation in my bodily (?) (sensations; reading
astak (?)); \[that is, a person comes, and thus also they, or he, would
do it to me\]; and this one who (is doing) \[that to us\] is also
leading us on, even in our progress in the cold \[of a winter\] of
accustomed sin, (or in the cold iniquitous winter). This verse seems a
very ancient interpolation.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[183:3](sbe31021.htm#fr_813.md) Haithîm is an
adverb; its position also does not so much favour an accusative
substantive.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[183:4](sbe31021.htm#fr_814.md) So our texts; but
the Pahlavi translator saw khraozhdaitî (see Y. XLVI, 11) in his MSS.,
rendering khrûsi*s*nŏ yehabûnd = utter cries: 'while his soul cries
fiercely.'

<span id="fn_813"></span>[183:5](sbe31021.htm#fr_815.md) The occurrence of
peret*a*u(âo) in this verse sheds light upon the peretô in the previous
one. Âk*a*u(âo) seems to be an attracted form for a loc. as elsewhere.
Perhaps it is miswritten.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[184:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_816) Nãsv*a*u(âo.md) would
naturally mean 'reaching'; but the word is also elsewhere used in an
evil sense, 'reaching to harm.' Y. LIII, 7. The Pahlavi, however,
indicates the reading nasv*a*u by its nasînênd. Does the Avesta show an
original evil sense to nas = to reach? May the two nas possibly have
some original connection? That *hv*âi*s* *s*kyaothnâi*s* means here 'by
means of' rather than 'because of' is the more probable from the same
words in the next verse, and this notwithstanding Y. XXXI, 20.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[184:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_817.md) So general a term
as 'creatures' should be avoided where possible; but see ye dâthaêibyô
ere*s* ratûm khshayãs ashav*a*u *k*istâ (verse 5).

<span id="fn_816"></span>[184:3](sbe31021.htm#fr_818.md) As to the
grammatical structure, all depends on s*en*dâ. Shall we bring down
nôi*t* from the verse above; or shall we regard s*en*dâ as in an evil
sense from sad as in sadrâ? The Pahlavi favours the former, as also in
Y. XXXVIII, 5 (Sp. 15). The general result is not, however, affected.
Read as alternative: No friends to the creatures are the Karpans as to
perfect (harvests) from the fields, (not) blessing us in the matter of
perfect (care and fodder) for the cattle, &c.; (sad in the sense of
blessing with nôi*t*).

<span id="fn_817"></span>[184:4](sbe31021.htm#fr_819.md) Free.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[184:5](sbe31021.htm#fr_820.md) Or, 'doctrines.'

<span id="fn_819"></span>[184:6](sbe31021.htm#fr_821.md) See the eleventh
verse.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[184:7](sbe31021.htm#fr_822.md) Alternatives would
be, 'Ahura will meet these engagements (?) made when the reward was
promised;' or, 'the reward which Zarathu*s*tra promised before Ahura
came into Garô*d*man.' According <span id="page_185">p. 185</span> to
the general form of the Gâthic sentence, *k*ôi*s*t parâ go more
naturally together than if the force of the parâ was extended to
*g*asa*t*. The coming of Ahura is elsewhere mentioned; here He enters
His audience-chamber before His approaching saints.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[185:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_823.md) Maga may have some
such cast of meaning. I have, moreover, more than once suspected that
the origin of 'magian' may, notwithstanding the môghu of the later
Avesta, be simply this maga so often used in the Gâthas to designate
'the cause.'

<span id="fn_822"></span>[185:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_824.md) See verse 20.

<span id="fn_823"></span>[185:3](sbe31021.htm#fr_825.md) So also the
Pahlavi translator in his gloss; aîgham bartman pavan nê*s*manîh barâ
yebabûnê*d*ŏ.

<span id="fn_824"></span>[185:4](sbe31021.htm#fr_826.md) So also of
Zarathu*s*tra's daughter, Y. LIII, 4.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[185:5](sbe31021.htm#fr_827.md) Or, 'cry ye for
the gaining of Asha,' as in Y. XXIX, I.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[185:6](sbe31021.htm#fr_828.md) Or, reading a
nominative, '*G*âmâspa is choosing,' which is itself well possible, as
var is also conjugated with n; but rap*e*n seems a plural, and vîdô
likewise.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[186:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_829.md) I concede this
shade of meaning to the indications of the Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[186:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_830.md) The Pahlavi gives
us our first indication here.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[186:3](sbe31021.htm#fr_831.md) If *G*âmâspô
(nom.) is read in verse 18, ahmâi might here refer to him; 'to this
one.'

<span id="fn_830"></span>[186:4](sbe31021.htm#fr_832.md) Or, 'let them
grant;' infinitive as imperative.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[186:5](sbe31021.htm#fr_833.md) Seeking; a dual is
here disapproved by the source from which the suggestion originated.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[187:1](sbe31021.htm#fr_834.md) I refer t*e*m to
Ahura, supposing it to stand; reading tãm, I would refer it to ashi.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[187:2](sbe31021.htm#fr_835.md) Compare Vend. XIX,
31.
