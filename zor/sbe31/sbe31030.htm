<p>1. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best.</p>  
<p>It is weal; it is weal to this (man),</p>  
<p>When toward Righteousness Best there is right.</p>  
<p>I offer the Myazda (of the) meat-offering with a complete and sacred offering; and I offer Haurvatat&acirc;<I>t</I> (who guards the water), and Ameretat&acirc;<I>t</I> (who guards the plants and the wood), and the flesh of the blessed Kine; and I offer the Haoma and the Haoma juice, the wood-billets and the perfume for the praise of Ahura Mazda, and of the Ahuna-vairya, the veracious word, and for that of the pious and beneficent Prayer for blessings, and for the redoubted Curse of the wise, and for the praise of the Haoma, and of the M&atilde;thra of the holy Zarathu<I>s</I>tra; and may it come to us with sacred fulness (to accept and to recompense our gift).</p>

<p>2. (The Ratu speaks.) Eat, O ye men, of this Myazda, the meat-offering, ye who have deserved it by your righteousness and correctness!</p>  
<p>3. O ye Bountiful Immortals, and thou, the Mazdayasnian law, ye just men and just women, and ye Zaothras, whoever among these Mazdayasnians would call himself a Mazdayasnian desiring to live in the practice of the liberality of Righteousness [for by sorcery the settlements of Righteousness are ruined], do ye cause (such an one) to be (still further) taught, (ye), who are the waters, the plants, and the Zaothras!</p>  
<p>4. And whoever of these Mazdayasnians, adults, when he invokes with earnestness, does not adhere to these words, and (so) speaks, he approaches to that (word) of the magician; (but, as against that magician's word) 'a blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best.'</p>  
<p>5. May&#8217;st Thou, O Ahura Mazda! reign at Thy will, and with a saving rule over Thine own creatures, and render Ye the holy (man) also a sovereign at his will over waters, and over plants, and over all the clean and sacred (creatures) which contain the seed of Righteousness. Strip ye the wicked of all power!</p>  
<p>6. Absolute in power may the holy be, bereft of all free choice the wicked! Gone (may he be), met as foe, carried out from the creatures of Spe<I>n</I>ta Mainyu, hemmed in&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_953"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> without power over any wish!</p>

<p>heads of the houses, villages, Za<I>n</I>tus, and provinces, to the careful following of this Religion which is that of Ahura, and according to Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, in their thoughts, their words, and their deeds.</p>  
<p>8. I pray for the freedom and glory of the entire existence of the holy (man) while I bless it, and I pray for the repression and shame&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_955"></A><A HREF="#fn_949"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the entire existence&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_956"></A><A HREF="#fn_950"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of the wicked.</p>  
<p>9. Propitiation to Haoma who brings righteousness (to us) for sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and for praise. (The Zaotar?) As the Ah&ucirc; to be (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar speaks forth to me. (The Ratu.) As an Ah&ucirc; to be (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar speaks forth to me. (The Zaotar.) So let the Ratu from his Righteousness, holy and learned, speak forth!</p>
