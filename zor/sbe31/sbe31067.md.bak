### YASNA LXII (SP. LXI).

#### TO THE FIRE.

1\. I offer my sacrifice and homage to thee, the Fire, as a good
offering, and an offering with our hail

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

of salvation, even as an offering of praise with benedictions, to thee,
the Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son! Meet for sacrifice art thou, and worthy
of (our) homage. And as meet for sacrifice, and thus worthy of our
homage, may’st thou be in the houses of men (who worship Mazda).
Salvation be to this man who worships thee in verity and truth, with
wood in hand, and Baresman ready, with flesh in hand, and holding too
the mortar. 2. And may’st thou be (ever) fed with wood as the
prescription orders. Yea, may’st thou have thy perfume justly, and thy
sacred butter without fail, and thine andirons regularly placed. Be of
full-age as to thy nourishment, of the canon's age as to the measure of
thy food, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's son! 3. Be now aflame <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1](#fn_1314.md) within this house; be ever without
fail in flame; be all ashine within this house; be on thy growth <span
id="fr_1326"></span>[2](#fn_1315.md) within this house; for long time be
thou thus to the furtherance of the heroic (renovation), to the
completion of (all) progress, yea, even till the good heroic
(millennial) time when that renovation shall have become complete. 4.
Give me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's son! a speedy glory, speedy nourishment,
and speedy booty, and abundant glory, abundant nourishment, abundant
booty, an expanded mind, and nimbleness of tongue for soul and
understanding, even an understanding continually growing in its
largeness, and that never wanders <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[3](#fn_1316), and long enduring virile power, (5.md)
an offspring sure of foot, that never sleeps on watch \[not for a third
part of the day, or night\], and that rises quick from bed <span
id="fr_1328"></span>[4](#fn_1317.md), and

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

likewise a wakeful offspring, helpful to nurture, or reclaim,
legitimate, keeping order in men's meetings, (yea,) drawing men to
assemblies through their influence and word, grown to power, skilful,
redeeming others from oppression, served by many followers, which may
advance my line (in prosperity and fame), and (my) Vîs, and my Za*n*tu,
and (my) province, (yea, an offspring) which may deliver orders to the
Province as (firm and righteous rulers). 6. And may’st thou grant me, O
Fire, Ahura Mazda's Son! that whereby instructors may be (given) me, now
and for evermore, (giving light to me of Heaven) the best life of the
saints, brilliant, all glorious. And may I have experience <span
id="fr_1329"></span>[1](#fn_1318.md) of the good reward, and the good
renown, and of the long forecasting preparation of the soul. 7. The Fire
of Ahura Mazda addresses this admonition to all for whom he cooks the
night and morning (meal). From all these, O Spitama! he wishes <span
id="fr_1330"></span>[2](#fn_1319.md) to secure good care, and healthful
care (as guarding for salvation), the care of a true praiser. 8. At both
the hands of all who come by me, I, the Fire, keenly look: What brings
the mate to his mate (thus I say to him), the one who walks at large, to
him who sits at home? \[We worship the bounteous Fire, the swift-driving
charioteer <span id="fr_1331"></span>[3](#fn_1320.md).\]

9\. And if this man who passes brings him wood brought (with good
measure that is) with sacred care, or if he brings the Baresman spread
with sanctity, or

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

the Hadhânaêpata plant, then afterwards Ahura Mazda's Fire will bless
him, contented, not offended, and in (its) satisfaction (saying thus).
10. May a herd of kine be with thee, and a multitude of men, may an
active mind go with thee, and an active soul as well. As a blest soul
may’st thou live through thy life, the nights which thou shall live.
This is the blessing of the Fire for him who brings it wood (well)
dried, sought out for flaming, purified with the earnest blessing of the
sacred ritual truth <span id="fr_1332"></span>[1](#fn_1321.md). 11. We
strive after the flowing on of the good waters, and their ebb <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[2](#fn_1322.md) as well, and the sounding of their
waves, desiring their propitiation; I desire to approach them with my
praise <span id="fr_1334"></span>[3](#fn_1323.md). 12 = Y. III, 24, 25.
