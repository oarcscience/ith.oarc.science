### YASNA XXVI.

#### THE FRAVASHIS; SACRIFICE AND PRAISE TO THEM.

1\. I praise, invoke, and weave my hymn to the good, heroic, and
bountiful Fravashis of the saints; (and having invoked these, then) we
worship the Nmânyas, and the Vîsyas, and the Za*n*tumas, and the
Da*hv*yumas <span id="fr_1176"></span>[1](#fn_1167.md), and the
Zarathu*s*trôtemas.

2\. And of all these prior Fravashis, we worship here the Fravashi of
Ahura Mazda, which is the greatest and the best, the most beautiful and
the firmest, the most wise and the best in form, and the one that
attains the most its ends because of Righteousness. 3. And (having
invoked them) hither, we worship the good, heroic, bountiful Fravashis
of the holy ones, those of the Bountiful Immortals, the brilliant, of
effective glance, the lofty, the devoted, the swift ones of the
creatures of Ahura who are imperishable and holy.

4\. And (having invoked them) hither, we worship the spirit and
conscience, the intelligence and soul and Fravashi of those holy men and
women who early heard the lore and commands (of God <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[2](#fn_1168).md), and loved and strove after
Righteousness, the ritual truth; and we worship the soul of the Kine of
blessed gift. 5. And (having invoked it) hither, we worship the Fravashi
of Gaya Maretan the holy, and the sanctity and Fravashi of Zarathu*s*tra
Spitâma the saint; and we worship the Fravashi of Kavi Vî*s*tâspa the
holy, and that of Isa*t*-vâstra the Zarathu*s*trian, the saint.

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

6\. And (having invoked them) hither; we worship the life, conscience,
intelligence, soul and Fravashi of the next of kin, of the saints male
and female who have striven after the ritual truth, which are those of
the dead and living saints, and which are those also of men as yet
unborn, of the future prophets who will help on the renovation, and
complete the human progress, with them all.

7\. And (having invoked them) hither, we worship the souls of the dead
\[(Pâzand) which are the Fravashis of the saints <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[1](#fn_1169.md)\]; and of all the next of kin who have
passed away in this house, of the Aêthrapaitis (the teachers) and of the
disciples; yea, of all holy men and women; (8) and we worship the
Fravashis of all the holy teachers and disciples; and of all the saints
both male and female.

9\. (And having invoked them) hither we worship the Fravashis of all the
holy children who fulfil the deeds of piety; and we worship the
Fravashis of the saints within the province; and those of the saints
without the province. 10. We worship the Fravashis of (those) holy men
and holy women; we worship all the good, heroic, bountiful Fravashis of
the saints from Gaya Maretan (the first created) to the Saoshya*n*t, the
victorious <span id="fr_1179"></span>[2](#fn_1170.md).

11\. Yea, we worship all the Fravashis of the saints, and we worship the
souls of the dead \[(Pâzand) which are the Fravashis of the saints\]!

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[279:1](sbe31048.htm#fr_1178.md) Whether a real
distinction existed in the minds of these early writers, between a
Fravashi and a departed soul, is hard to say. That a Fravashi was
worshipped as existing before the person to whom it appertained was
born, may be owing to a poetical, and not a dogmatic, anticipation.
