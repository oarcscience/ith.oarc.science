# MARVELS OF ZOROASTRIANISM.

## DÎNKA*RD*.—BOOK VII.

### CHAPTER I.

1\. *For* the gratification *of* the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, even through
the complete superiority of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, adorned by
omniscience, in the world.

2\. The seventh *book* is about the marvellousness of the greatest
reminder of the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) of the Spîtâmas; also of the mindfulness
of that illustrious *one* by Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and *of* his religion,
arisen through the word of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, being blessed among those of
the region of king Vi*s*tâsp; from the Exposition of the Good
Religion <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md).

3\. But, before that, *there* is purposely written whatever *was* the
progress of the character and effect of the good religion and its first
acceptor in the spiritual and worldly *existences*; and, after that,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

the prophets, apostles, *and* upholders in the period as far as
Zaratû*s*t, *whose* guardian spirit is reverenced, and their religion,
which is this, due to the utterance and splendour with which they have
been blessed with prophecy among mankind <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md).

4\. According to the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion and the Exposition of
the Good Religion, it is the nature of Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s disposition and
his knowledge as to the complete obtainment of the first creature, the
archangel Vohûmanô, and the first progress spiritually among the
archangels *and* the other sacred beings of the spiritual *and worldly
existences*, and materially in Gâyômar*d*, the first man, through
concurrent and complete acceptance from the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and
the needful atonement in his own period through meditation, and the
smiting thereby of the fiend of that period and the opposition thereof,
by thinking of the creator's teaching, *that constitute* the whole *of*
that first utterance <span id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) of the religion
of Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

5\. According to the declaration of the good religion about the
production of existence, which is the praise of him who *was* the causer
of existence and creator, the beneficent spirit, the first craving among
mankind *was* this, that 'we be happy and *be* the creation of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*;' and the last, as regards the preservation of a remedy
for mankind, is *this, that* 'the best is this, that the formation of
lives *be* perfect now, though rendered sickly by him; and the spiritual
existences of mankind *be so* now, though the destroyer *has* come to
the creatures.' 6. *For* 

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

human beings of the lineage of Gâyômar*d* this is the one thing good,
when they shall perform their duty and good works; and one's work is to
smite one's own opposing fiend; an instance presentable to *any* of the
lineage, that it is important *for* every one of you to smite his own
opposing fiend, is the freedom from molestation which occurs thereby,
and the non-contamination of the creatures by the destroyer; and it is
that effect which the creator *of* creation *has* produced for it.

7\. And this, too, is declared by the good religion, that through a
true-spoken statement Gâyômar*d* attained to the good spiritual
lordship <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md) of the archangels (that is,
*he was* fit for the supreme heaven <span
id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20).md). 8. And after Gâyômar*d*, at various
periods until the ever-favouring <span id="fr_21"></span>[3](#fn_21.md)
Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas, *whose* guardian spirit is reverenced; much
also *was* his acquaintance with knowledge, and *his* work *was* the
preservation of the mankind of that time in which he came into notice;
moreover he became requisite for conference with the creator; and
because of *their* superior carrying on of destiny <span
id="fr_22"></span>[4](#fn_22.md), by command of the

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

creator, *it is* declared in the good religion, *that* the combined
titles of prophet (vakhshvar), acceptor, *and* promoter *are* enumerated
of them.

9\. As Gâyômar*d* passed away, *it* <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md)
*came* to Masyê and Masyâôî <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md), the
second of worldly beings who *were* the progeny of Gâyômar*d*, the
first; *and it* is declared, by the word of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, that he spoke
to them, when they had been produced by him, thus: 'You are the men I
produce, you are the parents of the parents of all embodied existence;
and so do you men not worship the demons, for the possession of complete
mindfulness is the best *thing* produced by me for you, so that you
*may* fully observe duty and ordinances with complete mindfulness.' 10.
And the bountifulness of Aûha*r*ma*zd* *was* extolled by them, and they
went on with their own duty; they also performed the will of the
creator, enjoyed the advantage of the many duties of the world, *and*
practised next-of-kin marriage for procreation, union, and the complete
progress of the creations in the world, which are the best good works of
mankind. 11. The creator showed them the sowing of corn, as declared in
the words of Aûha*r*ma*zd* thus: 'This is thine, O Masyê! which is an
ox; thine, too, is this corn; and thine those other appliances;
henceforth thou shouldst know *them* well.'

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

12\. This, too, is declared by the good religion, that Aûha*r*ma*zd*
spoke to Hadish <span id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md), one of the sacred
beings thoroughly worthy through righteousness, thus: '*O* Hadish, who
*art* thoroughly worthy through righteousness! thou shouldst proceed to
Masyê and Masyâôî, thou shouldst procure thy <span
id="fr_26"></span>[2](#fn_26.md) corn *and* bread from Masyê, and Masyâôî,
*and* shouldst bless theirs thus: "This corn comes up owing to you,
*and*, as it came unto you from Aûha*r*ma*zd* and the archangels, may
the corn extend from you unto your descendants without disturbance from
the demons;" *and* two Ahunavairs <span id="fr_27"></span>[3](#fn_27.md)
are to be recited for the staying away *of* the demon and fiend.' 13.
And Hadish, the thoroughly worthy through righteousness, went to Masyê
and Masyâôî, and he procured his corn and bread from Masyê and Masyâôî,
and *it was* given by them; he also blessed them thus: 'May this corn
come up from you, as from the archangels! as it came unto you *from*
Aûha*r*ma*zd* *and* the archangels, may it extend from you unto your
descendants, without disturbance from the demons;' and two Ahunavairs
*were* recited by him, for the staying away of the demon *and* fiend.

14\. And, owing to the explanation of the sacred beings, Masyê and
Masyâôî attained also to the manufacture of clothing, the tending of
sheep, house-building, and primitive carpentry, the agriculture *and*
husbandry of the ancients, and the memory of their original state; and
*these* proceeded from them through *their* lineage, presenting an
example and

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

spreading *in* the world, to artificers among the plenitude of
artificers.

15\. And after that, the destiny to be carried on came to Sâmak <span
id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md), who *was* their son, and the descent of
*their* collateral descendants *was* on to each region and each quarter
of the world, *to* that extent which the creator chose for that region
and quarter; *and* thereby *there* was a completion of the progress and
spreading of mankind into the various regions *and* quarters.

16\. At another time it came to Vâêgere*d* and Hôshâng <span
id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29) of the early law (pê*s*-dâ*d*.md), for
providing in the world the law of husbandry, *or* cultivation of the
world, and *of* sovereignty *or* protection of the world. 17. And
through their companionship and united force, given by religion, the
sovereignty and cultivation *of* the world *were* prepared through
progress and a succession of provisions *of* Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s creatures,
*as well* as the religion appointed by Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 18. And through
that glory *of destiny* (gad*â*) two-thirds of the demons of
Mâzanô <span id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30.md) *and* the seven
evil-instructed *ones* <span id="fr_31"></span>[4](#fn_31.md) of Aêshm
*were* destroyed by Hôshâng.

19\. After that it came to Tâkhmôrup <span id="fr_32"></span>[5](#fn_32.md)
the well-armed, and through that glory the demon and evil mankind, the
wizard and witch, *were* smitten by him; idolatry *was* also cast out by
him, and he propagated in *his* time the reverence *and* service of the
creator; the evil spirit, converted into the shape of a horse, *was*
also carrying him *for* thirty winters.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

20\. And it came, at another time, for the conference with
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, to Yim <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) the splendid,
the son of Vîvang,ha; and owing to his accepting the four classes of the
religion, *which* are priesthood, warriorship, husbandry, and
artisanship, *there* are the four classes which are priesthood,
warriorship, husbandry, and artisanship, and thereby the world was
improved, extended, and developed; he also rendered even the creatures,
in a measure, immortal, undecaying, hungerless, thirstless, plentiful,
and fully-settled. 21. And in the good religion <span
id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md) *it* is declared, by the word of the
creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* to Yim, thus: 'Then do thou widen my world! (that
is, make up *its* measure more), then do thou extend my world! (that is,
make *it* up larger), and then thou shouldst accept from me the
protection, nourishment, and chieftainship of the world; and do thou
effect such watchfulness over *it, that* no one shall be able to
occasion the wounding or injury of another.' 22. And *this was* accepted
and done by Yim, as Aûha*r*ma*zd* commanded him; and through the same
glory he widened the earth three-thirds larger than that *which* it was
theretofore. 23. And, in that realm of his, the cattle and men of the
realm *were* made immortal by him, and the other creations, water,
vegetation, and the various foods, imperishable. 24. And this, too, is
declared by the good religion, that the world *was* made by him like the
supreme heaven in pleasantness; also the enclosure made by Yim,
constructed by him according to all the commands of the creator <span
id="fr_35"></span>[3](#fn_35.md), about guarding the creatures from
perishing through the winter of

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mahrkûs, and
likewise many other wonders are reported by the good religion.

25\. And it came, at another time, by command of the creator, to
Frê*d*ûn the Âspîgân <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md) when he was in
the pregnant womb, owing to the share of husbandry *in* the avocations
of the religion, through allotment from the glory of Yim, and through
its triumphant splendour. 26. And Frê*d*ûn, through that triumphant
splendour, became a responder *to* Dahâk <span
id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md) from the pregnant womb, and that degraded
fiend *was* averted and paralysed by him; *having* come to nine years
*of age*, he proceeded about his destruction, and through that victory
Dahâk *was* smitten by him <span id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md), the
creatures *were* saved and relieved thereby, those of Mâzandar and
Mâ*d*a *were* smitten, their ravage and mischief *were* removed from the
region of Khvanîras, *and* the region of Khvanîras *was* preserved *for
his* three sons. 27. And owing to his husbandry, which is the third
avocation of the religion, pestilence and disease *were* disturbed *by*
the medical treatment even of pestilence itself, and he exhibited to
mankind also many other wonders produced and useful occupation for the
world.

28\. And, in the life-*time* of Frê*d*ûn, the same destiny came to
Aîrî*k* <span id="fr_39"></span>[4](#fn_39.md), son of Frê*d*ûn, owing to
introduction *by* the creator, and *was* diffused in him, and he
practised humility; the life. <span id="fr_40"></span>[5](#fn_40.md) which
is perfect is brought through a prayer from *his* father Frê*d*ûn,

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

and that life <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) came to him from the
creator through the blessing of Frê*d*ûn.

29\. And it came, through *his* mother, to a descendant of Frê*d*ûn
*and* descendant of Aîrî*k*; it proceeded with the angel Nêryôsang to
Mânû*sk*îhar <span id="fr_42"></span>[2](#fn_42.md), and its entire
progress was in the lineage of Aîrî*k*. 30. And it came to Mânû*sk*îhar,
the monarch of Irân, and through it many wonder-wrought actions *were*
performed by him; he smote Salm and Tû*g* in revenge for Aîrî*k* <span
id="fr_43"></span>[3](#fn_43.md), he was a responder *to* the superfluities
of foreign countries, he arranged the realm of Irân, improved and
fertilised the land of Irân, and made the country of Irân victorious
over foreigners.

31\. At another time it came to Aûzôbô, son of Tûmâsp <span
id="fr_44"></span>[4](#fn_44.md), a descendant of Mânû*sk*îhar the monarch
of Irân; *and*, through that destiny and glory combined, the new-born
came to mature activity and the proportions of a man during childhood,
through agriculture; he disclosed *his* lamenting mother to the
countries of Irân, he marched on to the destruction of foreigners, to
drive out *and* make *them* outcast from the land of Irân; he also
defeated the village-terrifier of the country of Irân, the wizard who
frightened his father *and* fellow-immortals, Frangrâsîyâk of Tûr <span
id="fr_45"></span>[5](#fn_45.md); and he developed *and* fertilised

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

the country of Irân, and increased the many streams *and* cultivated
lands in the country of Irân.

32\. At another time it came to Kerêsâspô the Sâmân <span
id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md), owing to the share of warriorship which
is the second avocation of the religion, through allotment from the
glory of Yim <span id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md); and, through it, the
serpent Srôbŏvar which *was* swallowing horses *and* swallowing men, the
golden-heeled demon Gandarepô, and much other production *of* adversity
*by* the demon and the fiend—the murderess of the creatures—*were*
destroyed by him.

33\. At another time it came to Kai-Kobâ*d* <span
id="fr_48"></span>[3](#fn_48.md), the progenitor of the Kayâns; through it
he arranged the realm of Irân, he united the sovereignty with himself in
the Kayân race, *and* he thereby occasioned much splendour *and* actions
of advantage *to* the creatures.

34\. And it came to Pâtakhsrôbô <span id="fr_49"></span>[4](#fn_49.md)
*son* of Aîryêfshvâ <span id="fr_50"></span>[5](#fn_50.md), *son* of T*âz*,
who *was* king of the Arabs, through the mindfulness of the archangel
Ashavahi*s*tô, and his enquiry about it from its own tribe <span
id="fr_51"></span>[6](#fn_51)—*for* the demon of greediness (*âz*ŏ.md),
with *one* similarly

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

destined, had rushed for the destruction of him who *was* very gentle to
that tribe <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md)—*as he had* a full
inclination for the ascendancy of the portion whose guidance to the
lofty priestly master *was* owing to the archangel Ashavahi*s*tô, just
as the fish image <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md) of that *other*
portion *was* for falling into the river; and *it is* declared *that* he
came to the ceremonial of Zaratû*s*t.

35\. At another time it came to Kaî-Arsh *and his* brothers <span
id="fr_54"></span>[3](#fn_54.md), the descendants of Kobâ*d*; through it
they have been all-experienced and powerful, heedful and performing
wonders; and the eldest brother of them, Kaî-Ûs, seized upon the
sovereignty of the seven regions, *and* became very illustrious *and*
full of glory. 36. *At* the same time it came to Aôshnar <span
id="fr_55"></span>[4](#fn_55) who became fully sagacious (pûr-zîr.md),
owing to the glory of Yim, when he was in *his* mother's womb, and many
wonders *were* taught by him to *his* mother, through speaking from the
mother's womb; also at his birth he vanquished the maleficent spirit by
uttering answers *to* the questions *of* the deadly Fr*âk*îh the
demon-worshipper. 37. He also attained to the chancellorship
(farmâ*d*ârîh) of Kaî-Ûs, and became administrator (râyînî*d*âr) in his
realm *of* the seven regions; the frontier speech (vîmand-gôbisnîh)
*was* also explained *and* taught by him,

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

and much other learning of advantage *to* mankind *who* are unaffected
by the utterance of replies of a foreigner; he *also* advised the
Irânian country with the best-instructed counsel.

38\. And *its* coming to Kai-Sîyâvakhsh <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) the illustrious, through the
wondrous-formed Kangd*ez* *being* held by him for the retention *of*
protection *for* the much splendour *and* suitable glory of the
religion, from which the restoration of time, the re-arrangement of the
realm of Irân, *and* the reunion of power *and* triumph with the
religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd* are manifest.

39\. It came to Kaî-Khûsrôî <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md), son of
Sîyâvakhsh, *and* through it he smote and vanquished Frangrâsîyâk <span
id="fr_58"></span>[3](#fn_58.md) *of* Tûr, the wizard, and his
fellow-miscreation Kêrsêvazd <span id="fr_59"></span>[4](#fn_59.md) of
those of Vakgir <span id="fr_60"></span>[5](#fn_60.md), and many other very
evil devastators of the world; he also joined in the destruction of that
idol-temple which *was* on the shore of Lake *K*ê*k*ast <span
id="fr_61"></span>[6](#fn_61.md), *and* demolished that fiendishness which
*was* awful. 40. On account of the desirableness of means for the
renovation *of the universe, he is also* on a throne (nam*îk*ŏ), which
is assuredly selected by that destiny, at a secret place where *there*
is an immortal preserver for his body until the renovation, through the
will of the creator.

41\. And it came from him, after Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas came to the
conference of the creator

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and
accepted from the omniscient creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* unmixed freedom from
pollution, the comprehensive and also recited acquaintance with the
knowledge *and* work of priesthood, warriorship, husbandry, and
artisanship, *and* the separate portions of the Mazda-worshipping
revelation (dênô) brought to king Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp by command of the
creator, illuminated by the great splendour in that supreme sovereign of
the sacred beings; *and* propagated *by* the learned of the region, in
thee regions which *are* seven, through the good eloquence which is
owing to the succession of creatures until the renovation *of the
universe*. 42. And through its production by those who *will be his*
sons, Aûshê*d*ar, Aûshê*d*ar-mâh, and Sôshâns <span
id="fr_62"></span>[1](#fn_62.md), the renovation in the existence of the
creatures of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is immortal; and a more remindful statement
of its splendour, glory, *and* marvellousness is a statement *that* is
written and found below <span id="fr_63"></span>[2](#fn_63.md).

43\. And *there* have also been others before Zaratû*s*t, the prophet
(vakhshvar) of desired fame in the Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion; for it
is declared that, at times, some came from the spiritual *beings* to him
who *was* more of a leader, *and* mankind have become as captivated by
the solicitation *and* interrogation of that affair, as now by the
solicitation *and* interrogation of the religion; the necessity for that
period is not now necessary, because all mankind

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

are made acquainted with the religion, and Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas,
*whose* guardian spirit is righteous, is to be reverenced.

44\. Now, that which is declared in the world is written, about the
splendour, glory, and marvellousness of the prophet of the
Ma*zd*a-worshipping religion, the best of creations, *whose* guardian
spirit is reverenced, Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas; and ten chapters are
published here, as to the information from the Avesta, and *in*
benediction *of* the religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span
id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64.md).

45\. That of it which is before the birth of that glorious *one* from
*his* mother *in* the present *world*.

46\. That of it which is from the birth of that illustrious *one*
onwards, *till* his coming to a conference *with* Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

47\. That of it which is from the conference onwards, till his
pre-eminence over prophecy in the world, *and* the acceptance *of* the
religion *by* the exalted Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp.

48\. That of it which is onwards from that, till the departure
(vîkh*êz*ŏ) of that pure soul to the existence which is best.

49\. That of it which is also successively after that, in the reign of
the obedient king Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp.

50\. That of it which is after that, until the collapse (an*g*âvi*s*nŏ)
of the sovereignty of Irân.

51\. That of it which is also after that, until the end of the
millennium of Zaratû*s*t *and* the arrival of Aûshê*d*ar.

52\. That of it which is also after that, until *the end* of the
millennium of Aûshê*d*ar *and* the arrival of Aûshê*d*ar-mâh.

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

53\. That of it which is also after that, until the end of the
millennium of Aûshê*d*ar-mâh and the arrival of Sôshâns.

54\. *And* that of it from the arrival of the Triumphant Benefiter,
*until* the wonder *of* the renovation *and* future existence; a
statement of them each separately.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_15"></span>[3:1](sbe4705.htm#fr_15.md) Nearly always spelt
Zaratûkhsht in the MS., the counterpart of the Persian form Zaratuhsht
or Zaraduhsht.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[3:2](sbe4705.htm#fr_16.md) This Nik*êz*ŏ-î
Vêh-dênô was evidently the name of an older book, from which the
Dînka*rd* quotes much of its information on religious matters.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[4:1](sbe4705.htm#fr_17.md) This preliminary matter
occupies the whole of Chap. I.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[4:2](sbe4705.htm#fr_18.md) The Yathâ-ahû-vairyô,
or most sacred religious formula of the Parsis.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[5:1](sbe4705.htm#fr_19.md) Reading hû-ahûîh, Av.
hvanghevi. This section is one of the numerous quotations from the
Pahlavi version of a lost Avesta text. When we are furnished with a
complete Pahl.-Av. vocabulary, it will be possible to recover much of
the original Avesta of such quotations, with some degree of certainty.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[5:2](sbe4705.htm#fr_20.md) Pahl. garô*d*mânîg.
Such glosses and comments, inserted by the Pahlavi translator, are
always marked as parenthetical.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[5:3](sbe4705.htm#fr_21.md) Pahl. hamâî-bâhar; it
might be read hamâî-bîdâr, 'ever vigilant.'

<span id="fn_22"></span>[5:4](sbe4705.htm#fr_22.md) Reading vakhsh (= Pers.
bakhsh), which is usually expressed by its Zvâri*s* equivalent gad*â*
(traditionally gadman), and this means both 'destiny' and 'the star, or
glory, of destiny' (Av. hvarenô, Pers. khura). Here the first letter of
vakhsh is omitted, and this error converts the word into khayâ, the
Zvâri*s* of *g*ân, 'life.' <span id="page_6">p. 6</span> This must have
also occurred twice in a previous copy of the MS. in § 28, where the
word is written *g*ân, 'life,' in the MS. B. In S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, Dk.
VIII, xii, 20, vakhsh has been erroneously translated 'word.'

<span id="fn_23"></span>[6:1](sbe4705.htm#fr_23.md) The glorious destiny.
§§ 9 and 10 have been previously translated in S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp.

<span id="fn_40"></span>[10:5](sbe4705.htm#fr_40.md) Probably 'destiny;'
the initial letter of vakhsh, 'destiny,' has been omitted, and this
blunder converts the word into khayâ, 'life.'

<span id="fn_41"></span>[11:1](sbe4705.htm#fr_41) See note [5](#fn_40.md)
on preceding page.

<span id="fn_42"></span>[11:2](sbe4705.htm#fr_42.md) Here spelt Nêresang
and Mânû*s*îr. The former is the usual spiritual messenger of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*; and for the lineage of the latter see Bd. XXXI, 9-14. It
appears that the glorious destiny was preserved by the angel Nêryôsang
for some generations, and he conveyed it to the grandfather of
Mânû*sk*îhar (see Chap. II, 70).

<span id="fn_43"></span>[11:3](sbe4705.htm#fr_43.md) The three sons of

XXXIV, 6.

<span id="fn_45"></span>[11:5](sbe4705.htm#fr_45.md) See Yt. XIX, 56-64,

Av. form Frangrasyan is further <span id="page_12">p. 12</span>
corrupted into Frâsîyâ*v*, as it is also hereafter in Chap. II, 68; Zs.
XII, 3.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[12:1](sbe4705.htm#fr_46.md) A famous hero whose
exploits, like those of Hercules, have given birth to many legends; see
S.B.E., vol. xviii, pp. 369-382.

<span id="fn_47"></span>[12:2](sbe4705.htm#fr_47.md) Compare § 25.

Pâtsrôbô in Pahl. Vd. XX, 4 (Sp.).

<span id="fn_50"></span>[12:5](sbe4705.htm#fr_50.md) Or Aîryêfshnîg;
evidently the same as Virafsang in Bd. XXXI, 6, which is spelt
Avirafshanêg and Âirafshanig in two MSS. of the Irânian Bundahi*s*.
Hence we may conclude that Pâtakhsrôbô was a brother of Zâînîgâv, and a
great-uncle of Dahâk; but how his daughters could have been married to
the three sons of Frê*d*ûn, as stated in the *K*itradâ*d* Nask (see Dk.
VIII, xiii, 9), is a chronological difficulty that throws doubt upon
this identification.

<span id="fn_51"></span>[12:6](sbe4705.htm#fr_51.md) The people of the
primitive faith, who are supposed to have <span id="page_13">p.
13</span> already practised most of the duties upheld by Zarathu*s*tra
before his appearance as a reformer.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[13:1](sbe4705.htm#fr_52.md) Indicating that the
Arab subjects of the king had revolted, because he favoured those of the
primitive faith who, no doubt, gained further favour by putting down the
rebellion.

<span id="fn_53"></span>[13:2](sbe4705.htm#fr_53.md) Or it may be 'fish
priest,' as karapŏ, 'a heathen priest,' and kerpŏ 'shape, image,' are

transcripts of the Avesta names, Ukhshya*d*-ereta, Ukhshya*d*-nemangh,
and Saoshyãs, of the three apostles expected to revive and renovate the
Parsi religion in successive millenniums. According to the imperfect
chronology of the Bundahi*s*, the millennium of Aushê*d*ar-mâh has now
nearly one-fourth elapsed.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[15:2](sbe4705.htm#fr_63.md) See Chap. XI, 7-II.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[16:1](sbe4705.htm#fr_64.md) Then follow the
