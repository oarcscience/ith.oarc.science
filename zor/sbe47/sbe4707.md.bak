### CHAPTER III.

1\. About the marvellousness which is manifested after the birth of that
most auspicious of offsprings from *his* mother, till his coming to a
conference *with* Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121.md).

2\. One *marvel* is this *which is* declared, that on being born he
laughed outright; the seven midwives (dayah) <span
id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_122.md), who sat around him, were quite
frightened thereby; and those terrified ones spoke thus: 'What was this,
on account of grandeur or contempt? when, like the worthy man whose
pleasure is due to activity, the man's child so laughs at the birth
owing to him.' 3. Pôrûshâspô also spoke thus: 'Bring out this man*child*
to the sheep*skin* clothing which is soft; the affair *was* owing to
thee, owing to the virtue of thee who art Dûk*d*âûb, that the advent of
glory and coming of radiance to this man*child* *was* openly seen when
he laughed outright at his birth.'

4\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that Pôrûshâspô afterwards
went to a Karap, Dûrâsrôbô *by* name, who was the most renowned for
witchcraft in that district, and informed him of the birth of Zaratû*s*t
*and* the wonders which were manifested

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

therein; he *also* brought *him* to the house for the purpose of seeing
Zaratû*s*t. 5. That wizard, owing to the coming *on* of vexation at that
glory in Zaratû*s*t, desired with evil intention a really mischievous
deceit (shê*d*ŏ), to compress with *his* paws (gôv) the tender head of
that full-glorious child, to cause *his* death. 6. And here is
manifested a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions
*it* thus: 'Thereupon the paws of that deadly *one* (mar) *are* driven
back to behind him (that is, reversed (aû*s*kûn) backwards); nor ever
after *did* that deadly *one* become again a devourer of meat with *his*
jaws by means of those paws.' 7. That Karap also, besides that, examined
the marks *and* evil specks on Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md); and Pôrûshâspô, *in* awful alarm as to
the dispersion *of* the emanation of splendour (âp-dihîh) from
Zaratû*s*t, hastened (sârînî*d*) to make Zaratû*s*t invisible.

8\. One *marvel* is this *which is* declared, that the Karap Dûrâsrôbô,
through witchcraft, cast such fear of Zaratû*s*t into the mind *of*
Pôrûshâspô, *and* so injured the mind of Pôrûshâspô, that, owing only to
that very fear as regards himself, he asked the Karap for the death of
Zaratû*s*t. 9. Also about <span id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md) the mode
of putting to death for which Pôrûshâspô, owing to the distraction
(vishôpi*s*nŏ) by which he becomes helpless, asks Dûrâsrôbô; and that
Karap is bringing much firewood together, and to shelter (nipâyî*d*anŏ)
Zaratû*s*t amid that firewood, to stir up a fire, and to make it blaze
with the wood were the remedy he arranged (vîrâstŏ); and Pôrûshâspô
acted accordingly.

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 10. And here is
manifested a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions
it thus: 'Neither *was* fire among the vegetation on a tree (that is, it
does not come on), nor *has* fire seized upon plants; *but* on rushed,
at dawn <span id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md), that son-loving mother,
and she came forth to him intelligently (hûshûmônd), and seizing him,
thereby removed him with *her* right hand aloft as he sat <span
id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_126.md).'

11\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that after Pôrûshâspô spoke
to the Karap Dûrâsrôbô about the fire not burning *the child*, he asked
anew about putting Zaratû*s*t to death; *then* to ensconce
(nipâyî*d*anŏ) Zaratû*s*t in a narrow path, and despatch many oxen on
that path, so that he *may* be trampled on *by* the feet of the oxen
*at* night, were the remedy that Karap proposed (girâyî*d*ŏ) to
Pôrûshâspô; and Pôrûshâspô acted accordingly. 12. Here also is
manifested a wonder of grandeur to the multitude, just as revelation
mentions: 'It *was* that ox walked on which *had* become sorrowful (that
is, its sorrow was great owing to another ox) and *it was* aged and
walked before that *one* (before the leading ox), it *also* hastened
before that *other* (that is, it stood up before Zaratû*s*t), *and* he
*was* greatly pitied by it for the whole day, so that it kept away the
oxen from him, *being* the first *that* walked thither *and* the last
*that* walked away; on rushed at dawn that son-loving mother, forth to
*him* she came intelligently,

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

and seizing him, thereby removed him with *her* right hand aloft as he
sat <span id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127.md).'

13\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that Pôrûshâspô came a
second time (îdanŏ) to that Karap also about the oxen not trampling on
Zaratû*s*t, *and* asked anew about the mode *of* putting Zaratû*s*t to
death; *then* to ensconce Zaratû*s*t *near* a drinking-pool (*âv*khûr)
in the domain (gêhân), and to drive many horses to that drinking-pool,
so that he may be trampled on by the hoofs of the horses, were the
substituted <span id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_128.md) remedy that Karap
proposed; *and* Pôrûshâspô acted accordingly. 14. And here is manifested
a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions thus: 'That
horse walked on which *had* become fully-hoofed (that is, its hoofs were
very thick); *it is* yellow-eared and it walks before that *one* (before
the leading horse), and it hastens before that *other* (that is, it
stood up before Zaratû*s*t), and *was* the first *that* walked on
thither, and the last *that* walked away; on rushed at dawn that
son-loving mother, forth to him she came intelligently, and seizing him,
thereby removed him with *her* right hand aloft as he sat <span
id="fr_129"></span>[3](#fn_129.md).'

15\. One *marvel* is this *which is* declared, that Pôrûshâspô *came*
again to that Karap, spoke also about the horses, too, not trampling on
Zaratû*s*t, and asked anew as to what *may be* the mode *of* putting

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Zaratû*s*t to
death; *then* to have Zaratû*s*t carried off into the den (sûrâk) where
a wolf's cubs (hûnû*s*kân) *are* slaughtered, so that when the wolf
arrives *and* sees the slaughtered cubs, she *will* wrathfully growl
*and* mangle Zaratû*s*t in revenge for those cubs, was the remedy that
Karap proposed; and Pôrûshâspô acted accordingly. 16. *And* here is
manifested a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions:
'It is when that wolf came on, several Yû*g*yâsts <span
id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130.md), towards Zaratû*s*t, the wolf *was*
struck dumb by the assistance of the sacred beings, so that its mouth
*was* down *at* the cubs, one with the other.'

17\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that Srôsh <span
id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md) the righteous *and* Vohûmanô proceeded
to him, and a woolly (kûrû*s*ak) *sheep* was brought by them unto him;
the nurses (dâyagân) <span id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_132.md) also *were*
terrified, apart from him, the whole night. 18. *Then* on rushed at dawn
that son-loving mother, forwards from the position *of* that woolly
*sheep* she walked, and she, the mistress of the domain (zan-î gehân),
spoke thus: 'Thou runnest on violently (ûtayûtŏ) in excess;' for she
considered in this *way*, that 'the wolf is so much better to that son
than thou art <span id="fr_133"></span>[4](#fn_133.md) good to me, when I
shall show *his* <span id="fr_134"></span>[5](#fn_134.md) bone or blood in
thy sight <span id="fr_135"></span>[6](#fn_135.md).' 19. Forwards to him
has she come

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

intelligently and, seizing him, she thereby removed him, through the
grace (dahi*s*nŏ) of the sacred beings, aloft as he sat; and she, the
mistress of the domain, spoke thus: 'I *shall* not give thee up again,
my son, not even though both Râk and Nô*d*ar *should* arrive here
together <span id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136.md).'

20\. And *it* is declared that, afterwards, the Karap Dûrâsrôbô, with a
malicious disciple, came to the same district and noticed about the
advancement of Zaratû*s*t; and they saw no means for injuring *or*
putting *him* to death, but his condition (mindavam) *was* a marvel as
full of vigour as this which is declared, that Brâ*d*rôk-rêsh, the
Karap, growled thus:—21. 'Then I, *who* am the most far-seeing of the
people in that district of ours as to witchcraft, see upon their
district that well-directing (that is, he understands good commands)
produce *of* development (that is, the increase which continually
becomes more, which *has* come and which *will* arrive), with good
flocks (that is, he understands to keep good sheep), with good herds
(that is, he understands to keep a herd which is better *than*
another's), the well-exerting (that is, he understands to do work which
is better *than* another's), well-fighting (that is, he understands to
do battle well), and perfectly liberal (that is, he understands to
exercise beneficial liberality) bantling (hûnû*s*kŏ) of Pôrûshâspô <span
id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_137.md), in the three nights while he was
begotten out of

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

his parents. 22. Unto him *will* Vohûmanô come in the embodied world
(that is, Vohûmanô *will* come unto Zaratû*s*t), and conducting him unto
a conference, his good religion *will* extend into the seven regions
*of* the earth; and so I *shall* not even let him produce in *his* mind
(that is, he *will* not know) where *and* how I *shall* murder him; and
a token of this matter, that *one* speaks truly, is this, that I state
*it* beforehand, promptly after the full hearing of the statement of the
matter, when you heard this statement.'

23\. Pôrûshâspô advanced, conveyed in a four-in-hand chariot <span
id="fr_138"></span>[1](#fn_138.md); then, on hearing that statement, *and*
when they had heard that statement, Pôrûshâspô started forth, conveyed
in that four-in-hand chariot. 24. And Pôrûshâspô spoke to
Brâ*d*rôk-rêsh, the Karap, thus: 'Brâ*d*rôk-rêsh, *thou* Karap! whatever
men they shall behold, cry out when at birth; even the offspring of that
secluded person they behold in death, cry out when at birth <span
id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_139.md); *but* what *was* that which *they*
beheld *at* the birth of my son? 25. When at birth he laughed outright;
*was* that also beheld *in* thy son, when at birth did he laugh
outright? 26. When Vohûmanô comes unto him, into *this* embodied
existence, *it* is also said by him on *his* return: "*O* Pôrûshâspô!
where is thy servant <span id="fr_140"></span>[3](#fn_140.md)?" So, *O*
Karap! concerning him who is my son, *it is* beheld that *he was* seen
sagaciously by thee.'

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

27\. And <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) when Pôrûshâspô enquired
of him thus: 'What was the *matter* with thee when, through bringing
thee unto that son of mine, *he was* thereby offered; and thou lookedst
long up away from him in height, and thou lookedst long down away from
him in depth, and thou lookedst long out away from him in different
directions?' 28. The Tûrânian, Brâ*d*rôk-rêsh the Karap, spoke *in*
reply thus: 'When through bringing me unto that son *was thy* offering
of him, and I <span id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_142.md) looked long up away
from him in height, then the radiance *and* glory out of him kept
together up to the sun, *and* through him <span
id="fr_143"></span>[3](#fn_143.md) I have accompanied *them* on the
boundary *of its* radiance *and* glory; so that I saw this, that mankind
through speaking to the soul may attain to the firmament of the sun;
*but* this, namely, how the routine (dâ*d*istânŏ) is in the supreme
heaven, was not seen by me. 29. When through bringing me unto that son
of thine *was thy* offering of him, and I looked long down in depth away
from *thy* offering of him, then the radiance and glory out of him kept
together unto the sky which is below this earth, and through him  <span
id="fr_144"></span>[4](#fn_144.md) to the boundary of *its* radiance and
glory; *but* this, namely, how the routine is in that sky, *was* not
seen by me. 30. And when through bringing me unto that son of thine *was
thy* offering of him, and I looked long out away from him in different
directions, then the radiance *and* glory from him kept together for
adorning this earth, *and* 

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

through him I have accompanied *them* on the boundary of *its* radiance
*and* glory; so that I saw this, that only from the action of this *one*
the future existence *will* arise; but the routine of the future
existence *was* not seen by me. 31. This son of thine thinks thus: "I
*will* make a grander material existence than that of *any* other;" so
he *will* also make thy spiritual *one*, where thou goest; *and* this
son of thine *will* remain in the great protection *of* Vi*s*tâsp, not
in thine.'

32\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that when Zaratû*s*t was
seven years old, that Dûrâsrôbô being joined by Brâ*d*rôk-rêsh the Karap
at the village of Pôrûshâspô, on account of the little previous seeing
of Zaratû*s*t *by the latter*, they saw Zaratû*s*t in that neighbourhood
when a hut (kâ*d*akŏ) was constructed by him with the children; and they
sat with evil intention to injure the mind of Zaratû*s*t through
witchcraft, and for that reason fear and terror *were* cast by them upon
the children. 33. Here a great wonder became manifest to them, owing to
the powerful intellect, cautiousness, and practice of Zaratû*s*t, just
as revelation mentions thus: 'When the other children were excessively
terrified at their own silliness of speech, Zaratû*s*t did not quite
close the eye in his mind as regards them.'

34\. One *marvel* is this *which is* declared, that when these two
Karaps came to the dwelling of Pôrûshâspô, he ordered the preparation of
food for their eating; and his prepared food is chewed up (fr*âz*
khayâî-aît), *with* a gobletful (pûr dôlakŏ) of mare's milk. 35. He also
spoke to Dûrâsrôbô thus: 'Thou art the most spirit-worshipping <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145.md) of mankind

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

in our district; do thou worship this of mine.' 36. A great marvel,
owing to the sagacity of Zaratû*s*t at a childish age, is just as
revelation mentions that Zaratû*s*t spoke thus: 'I worship this, *O*
father! *it is* not that which it is necessary for me to worship *that*
he should worship.' 37. And Pôrûshâspô spoke thus: '*It is* not that of
mine thou worshippest, *and* it is that of mine he should worship.' 38.
As many as three times those persons (gab*r*âân) carried on those
assertions; *when* up stood Zaratû*s*t and spoke concerning them, and he
broke forth with that eternal statement <span
id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146.md), namely: 'The righteous I reverence, men
*or* women; the poor I reverence, men *or* women; *not* the wicked, men
or women; when any one whatever shall join Pôrûshâspô, where he shall be
celebrating worship, the worship shall then be suitable to the
worshippers, that is, he shall worship that which it is necessary to
worship.'

39\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that afterwards Dûrâsrôbô
the Karap shouted to Zaratû*s*t thus: 'Evil was thy reckoning <span
id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_147.md) which, owing to the conduct of fate
(bâhar), I, the foremost of the existences embodied in Râk and
Nô*d*âr <span id="fr_148"></span>[3](#fn_148.md), bring to thee; I am made
further worthy where thy fate is carried away from me; now is the joy
(parkân) which I convey to him <span id="fr_149"></span>[4](#fn_149.md)
through bringing it on, and this

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

*will* occur, so that I may observe he *will* kill thee with the evil
eye in the house.' 40. And here is a great wonder which became manifest
about Zaratû*s*t, in the sagacity of *his* reply to that deadly *one* at
that childish age, which *was* just like this which revelation mentions,
that Zaratû*s*t spoke thus: 'Without the joy of a murderer I observe,
with propitiousness and complete mindfulness, that it is thee I notice
in that house which is thine <span id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md).'

41\. One *marvel* is that which, after this reply of Zaratû*s*t to
Dûrâsrôbô, became manifest in that Karap, just as revelation mentions
thus: 'The deadly *one* became disabled and stupefied as long as the
milking of ten mares *in* milk whose milker is *only* one.'

42\. One *marvel* is this *which is* declared, that when that wizard
emerged from *that* stupefaction, he then shouted again to Zaratû*s*t
*in* the same manner, Zaratû*s*t uttered that same reply, *and* the
deadly *one* became anew disabled and stupefied as long as the milking
of twenty mares full of milk whose milker *is only one*.

43\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that again when that wizard
emerged from *that* stupefaction, he then shouted to Zaratû*s*t *in* the
same manner, Zaratû*s*t uttered that same reply, *and* the deadly *one*
becomes anew disabled and stupefied as long as the milking of thirty
mares full of milk whose milker is *only* one.

44\. One *marvel* is this *which is* declared, that when that wizard
emerged from that stupefaction, he

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

then grumbled thus: 'Do ye have the horse driven for us, and turn round
the chariot wherein you harness *it*; for really this smiting *one*
(ganâk) *will* destroy me through the arrival of the *sacred* text *and*
through *his* possession of authority.' *So* they had the horse driven,
and *it was* harnessed to the chariot by them. 45. And here is
manifested a great wonder to the multitude, just as revelation mentions
thus 'When he *had* proceeded several Yû*g*yâsts <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md) in driving, he stopped in his distress
through being terrified, *and* this occurred which I mention for a
warning <span id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152.md), his semen *was* expelled,
so that it arose in his skin and burst it <span
id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153.md), and *his* loin thereby broke from *his*
thigh; he then died outright, then his progeny, and then the offspring
of his progeny.'

46\. One *marvel* is this which is declared that, even before the coming
of *Zaratû*s*t* to a conference <span id="fr_154"></span>[4](#fn_154.md),
*there* is manifested in him a mind which is more capacious than the
whole world, *and* more exalted than every worldly possession, with an
understanding whose strength is perfectly selected, an intellect of
all-acquiring power, and a sagacity of all-deciding ability also with
the much heedfulness *of* the kingly glory, and the full desire for
righteousness, the efficacious diligence and authority, and even the
superiority in mightiness and grandeur of the priestly glory. 47. Also
the handsomeness of body *and* completeness of strength which are in the
character *of* these four classes of his, which are priesthood,

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

warriorship, husbandry, and artisanship; *besides* a perfect friendship
for the sacred beings *and* the good, *and* an awful enmity for the
demons *and* the vile. 48. That is the nature by which the habits
(dâ*d*ŏîh) of mankind *and* bipeds, the perfection and completeness of
the sacred beings through the creativeness of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and its
*own* commemoration *of them* are provided. 49. So that the sacred
beings shall bring a report, as to his superiority, from every one of
those who are *and* were *and* will be, *and* of his coming for
reminding *us of* Aûha*r*ma*zd* and *of* the lord-and-mastership (a
hû-va-ra*d*îh) of the world, *also of* the preservation of the creations
therein (ay*î*pŏ-dahi*s*nân), from the destroyer, by the tongue of the
many-mannered (kabed-sarâ*d*akŏ) sage, the fully-virtuous *one* of the
age producing no harm (avazand-dahîg) in the world. 50. And the demons
on this *account*, that this is *he* whom many Kîgs <span
id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md)1 *and* Karaps *have* to influence the
good to confound *and* destroy, then also kept *their* promise and
practised friendship.

51\. And on the completion of thirty years beyond his birth <span
id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_156.md) the archangel Vohûmanô came on in
commemoration of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, when *he was* bringing his Hôm-water
(mayâ-î Hômîgân) <span id="fr_157"></span>[3](#fn_157.md) from the

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

river Aêvatâk <span id="fr_158"></span>[1](#fn_158.md), just as this which
revelation mentions thus: ‘When Zaratû*s*t came forth to the third
effluent (ba*r*â-ta*g*i*s*nîh), that of the good Dâîtî, he further
proceeded through that; and when he marched onwards from that, a man
*was* seen by him, who marched from the southern quarter. 52. That was
Vohûmanô, and it seemed *to* him *that* Vohûmanô *was* of early form (so
that he is more discerning as to a person) and foreseeing (that is, he
was beforehand in everything); it seemed *to* him *that* Vohûmanô *was*
as much *in* height as three men's spears; and it seemed *to* him, *as
to* Vohûmanô that a glossy twig (arûs tâk) *was* brought by him in *his*
hand, through carrying off which branch the plant *was* not injured by
him; that became the spiritual twig of the religion, and this *was*
indicated by it, that it is necessary to proceed as uninjuriously by the
religion. 53. There is *some one* who says that it became a reminder of
the spiritual *existence*, and this *was* indicated by it, that it is
necessary to proceed as uninjuriously in the world, so that peace may
exist with every one.

54\. When he came onward to the fourth effluent, as far as the
Aûshân-rû*d* of the good Dâîti (which was the name of it) and *he was*
in it, Zaratû*s*t was bringing the Hôm-water from the middle of it; and
on the ascent Zaratû*s*t, bringing his right foot out of the
Aûshân-rû*d*, covered *himself* with his clothes, and upon that
Vohûmanô, advancing, joined him in front.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

55\. And that man enquired of him thus: 'Who art thou; from whom of them
art thou <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_159.md)?' *He replied*: 'I am
Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_160.md) of the Spîtâmas.'

56\. The words of Vohûmanô *were*: '*O* Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas!
about what is thy foremost distress (that is, for what is thy need when
thou becomest quite distressed); about what is thy foremost endeavour;
and for what is the tendency of thy desire (lak kâmakŏ-dahi*s*nîh)?' 57.
The reply of Zaratû*s*t *was* thus: 'About righteousness, I consider
*my* foremost distress; about righteousness *my* foremost endeavour; and
for righteousness the tendency of my desire (that is, my need is for
that thing, and I am a distressed seeker of righteousness).'

58\. The words of Vohûmanô *were*: '*O* Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas! that
which is righteousness is existing (that is, a real thing is, as *it
were*, that which is righteousness), so that whatever is that which is
righteousness is thus what is one's own.' 59. And Zaratû*s*t spoke thus:
'That which is righteousness exists, and concerning that I am completely
clear and aware; *but* where *and* how is that radiance which is that
whose arrival is through Vohûmanô.'

60\. And Vohûmanô spoke to him thus: '*O* Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas!
deposit this one garment which thou carriest, so that we *may* confer
with him *by*

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

whom thou art produced *and by* whom I am produced, who is the most
propitious of spirits, who is the most beneficent of existences, and who
is he *that* I, who am Vohûmanô, am testifying (that is, I am a reminder
of him).'

61\. Thereupon, Zaratû*s*t thought thus: 'Good is he who is the creator,
who is better than this reminder.' 62. Then they proceeded in company,
Vohûmanô and Zaratû*s*t; Vohûmanô *first and* Zaratû*s*t after.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_121"></span>[35:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_121.md) The contents of this
chapter refer chiefly to 'the rearing of Zaratû*s*t.' For the other
matters mentioned in Dk. VIII, xiv, 2, see Zs. XIV, .6-12.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[35:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_122.md) Sls. X, 15
prescribes 'ten women.' Zs. XIV, 13 mentions 'seven wizards (yâtûkŏ)'.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[36:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_123.md) Compare Zs. XVI,
1-3.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[36:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_124.md) Pahl. madam-m*â*,
where m*â* = *k*i, 'what? whatever,' is used for -i*k*, 'also,' as often
happens.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[37:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_125.md) Reading pavan aûsh,
but it might be pavan hûsh, 'with sense,' here and in § 14, where there
is nothing to indicate that the child was out all night, but in § 12, 18
he is evidently rescued the next morning.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[37:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_126.md) Pahl. 'madam pavan
aûstakŏ.' Compare Zs. XVI, 7.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[38:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_127.md) Compare Zs. XVI, 5.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[38:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_128.md) Possibly
'supplementary' or 'gratuitous.' The word is nîrmatŏ which, as a noun,
means the gratuity or honorarium paid to a priest for acting as a
substitute for another. Its etymology is obscure, unless it be an
abbreviation of nirûmandî, 'strength,' used in the legal sense of
'refresher.'

<span id="fn_129"></span>[38:3](sbe4707.htm#fr_129.md) Compare Zs. XVI, 6.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[39:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_130.md) The Yû*g*yâst is a
distance of sixteen Roman miles of a thousand paces each (see Dk. VIII,
xx, 19, note). But the writer of the scripture here quoted could have
had no idea of the distance he was mentioning.

<span id="fn_131"></span>[39:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_131.md) A sacred being who
personifies 'obedience,' and is a special protector of man, particularly
at night.

<span id="fn_132"></span>[39:3](sbe4707.htm#fr_132.md) It may also be read
dehîgân, 'the country-folk.'

<span id="fn_133"></span>[39:4](sbe4707.htm#fr_133.md) Or '*she* would be.'

<span id="fn_134"></span>[39:5](sbe4707.htm#fr_134.md) Or 'they show *my*.'

<span id="fn_135"></span>[39:6](sbe4707.htm#fr_135.md) This seems to be a
bitter reproach addressed to her husband; but the ambiguity of the
Pahlavi makes its exact meaning rather uncertain.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[40:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_136.md) See Chap. II, 51.
Compare Dk. V, ii, 4; Zs. XVI, 8-13.

<span id="fn_137"></span>[40:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_137.md) The Pahlavi version
of an Avesta text, here translated, is a fair specimen of the
complication produced by appending a gloss to every epithet. It is
useful as a combination of translation and lexicon, but it is apt to be
perplexing, unless all the glosses are carefully omitted by the reader
who can dispense with a lexicon. <span id="page_41">p. 41</span> For
restoring the original Avesta, the Pahlavi translation, without the
glosses, is usually the best guide.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[41:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_138.md) Pahl. 4-ayû*g*i*s*nô
râê (Av. *k*athruyukhta and ratha).

<span id="fn_139"></span>[41:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_139.md) This seems to be the
meaning of Pahl. 'zag-*îk* tanŏ armê*s*tôdahi*s*nîh pavan fr*âz*
khadîtund margîh, amat pavan zerkhûni*s*nŏ, ba*r*â bekhûnd.'

<span id="fn_140"></span>[41:3](sbe4707.htm#fr_140.md) Pahl. 'Pôrûshâspô!
aêghat bandakŏ?'

<span id="fn_141"></span>[42:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_141.md) The first five words
of § 28 are here inserted in the MS., so as to combine the two sentences
in a perplexing manner.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[42:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_142.md) The MS. has *a*fat
for *a*fam by mistake.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[42:3](sbe4707.htm#fr_143.md) Or 'that.'

<span id="fn_144"></span>[42:4](sbe4707.htm#fr_144.md) The differences of
form in §§ 28-30 are probably due to errors of copyists.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[43:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_145.md) Literally
'demon-worshipping;' it is not clear that idolatry is <span
id="page_44">p. 44</span> intended, but rather some form of worship
antecedent to Zoroastrian Mazda-worship which latter had not yet been
established. The author of this legend must have supposed that it
differed very little from the religion of Pôrûshâspô.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[44:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_146.md) Reading sakhûn-i
leyalmin which is written in Pahlavi exactly like dashinô rigel*â*, 'the
right foot.'

<span id="fn_147"></span>[44:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_147.md) Pahl. marakŏ,
possibly for marg, 'death.'

<span id="fn_148"></span>[44:3](sbe4707.htm#fr_148.md) See Chap. II, 51,
note.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[44:4](sbe4707.htm#fr_149.md) Probably referring
to his companion Brâ*d*rôk-rêsh who, according <span id="page_45">p.
45</span> to most accounts, was the murderer of Zaratû*s*t in his old
age. This tradition is mentioned in Dk. VII only here and in § 22.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[45:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_150.md) Alluding to
Dûrâsrôbô's own fate, see § 45.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[46:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_151.md) See §§ 16 n.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[46:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_152.md) Pahl. 'avŏ pê*s*
yema*l*e*l*ûnam.'

<span id="fn_153"></span>[46:3](sbe4707.htm#fr_153.md) Or 'in his back and
broke it,' if we suppose that pôst, 'skin,' stands for pô*s*t, 'back.'
Compare the same legend in Zs. XIX, I-8.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[46:4](sbe4707.htm#fr_154.md) With the sacred
beings.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[47:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_155.md) See Chap. II, 9 n.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[47:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_156.md) The remaining
contents of this and the following chapter are thus summarized in Dk. V
III, xiv, 3, 4:—'His attainment on maturity, at thirty years *of age*,
to a conference *with* Aûha*r*ma*zd*; and the occurrence of seven
conferences in ten years. Many marvels, owing to him are published
therein, just as there are *some* which, collected *and* selected, are
noticed by the Dînka*rd* manuscript,' that is, in this seventh book, in
which, however, the details of the seven conferences do not occur; but
some are mentioned in Zs. XXI, 8-XXIII, 13.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[47:3](sbe4707.htm#fr_157.md) See Visp. XI, 2.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[48:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_158.md) Literally
'single-flowing.' In Bd. XXIX, 4, 5, it is Nâîvtâk which has been
translated as 'navigable' in Bd. XX, 34. and as 'flowing in a channel'
in Dk. VIII, xxxvii, 38, 42; IX, xvi, 16.—From § 54 it appears to have
been a channel of the good Dâîtî river which flows from Aîrân-vê*g* (see
Bd. XX, 13).

<span id="fn_159"></span>[49:1](sbe4707.htm#fr_159.md) See Pahl. Yas. XLII,
7 c (Sp.).

<span id="fn_160"></span>[49:2](sbe4707.htm#fr_160.md) According to the
numbering of the folios in the old Bombay MS., written in 1659, nine
folios were here separated from it last century. They contained the text
as far as the end of Chap. IV, and the first eight of them were found at
Naosâri about twenty years ago and copied. But all Indian copies,
written before that time, omit this mislaid text. See S.B.E., vol.
xxxvii, pp. xxxvi, xxxvii.
