### CHAPTER XX.

1\. About the righteousness of his desires *it* is thus declared, that
when he became fifteen years old, the sons of Pôrûshaspô demanded a
portion from *their* father, and their portions are allotted out by him.
2. Among the clothes *there* was a girdle, the width of which *was* four
finger*-breadths*; and of the four <span id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_459)
portions around and the girdle, which it was possible to bring forth,
Zaratû*s*t selected *the latter* and tied it on him*self*. 3. This was
owing to the precepts (parvânakân) of Vohûmanô who came into his reason
at birth; as to whatever is not the custom *his* mind *was* now quite
closed, and in that which is the custom *it was* impetuously exercised
by him.

4\. About *his* compassionate disposition and the streams of the Arag
province <span id="fr_464"></span>[3](#fn_460), this also is declared,

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

that *there* was a river, *and* from them the body of a naked woman
floated, for the reason that, on account of the strength and swiftness
of the river, a woman, except when she *was* quite naked while she was
in it, was not able to pass; and an old person, such as he who is of
seventy years *and* is called in revelation a Hânô <span
id="fr_465"></span>[1](#fn_461), for want of power (apâ*d*îyâvandîh
râî), was not able to go back through it by his own strength. 5.
Zaratû*s*t came on to the bank of the water, *and* of women *and* old
people seven persons had come, and are passed on by him, *in* the manner
of a bridge <span id="fr_466"></span>[2](#fn_462); it was an emblem of
the *spiritual* performers <span id="fr_467"></span>[3](#fn_463) of
bridging work, that is, of those providing a passage to heaven.

6\. About his liberal disposition *it* is declared, that the fodder of
Pôrûshaspô, which was stored for the beasts *of burden*, *was* not
*only* for the beasts of Pôrûshaspô in a scarcity, but *also* for
distribution among the beasts of others, which, owing to their hunger on
account of the scarcity, then constantly ate off the tails of each
other; *and it was* given to them plentifully.

7\. About his abandoning worldly desire, *and* his laying hold of
righteousness of way, this, too, is declared, that when he became twenty
years old, without the consent (*b*ên akâmakîh) of *his* father and
mother, he wandered forth *and* departed from

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

*their* house, and openly enquired thus: 'Who is most desirous of
righteousness *and* most nourishing the poor?' 8. And they spoke thus:
'He who is the youngest (kêhistô) son of Aûrvaîtŏ-dih <span
id="fr_468"></span>[1](#fn_464) the Tûr, who every day gives an iron
caldron (*g*âmak), which is the height of a horse, full of bread and
milk *and* other food, unto the poor.' 9. Zaratû*s*t went on to that
place, and with his co-operation, for the nourishment of the poor, some
of the chief men performed duty by carrying forth food for the poor.

to. About his compassion, not only upon mankind, but also his other
creatures, this, too, is declared, that a bitch *was* seen by him, which
had given birth to five <span id="fr_469"></span>[2](#fn_465) puppies,
and it was three days then that she *had* not obtained food <span
id="fr_470"></span>[3](#fn_466). 11. Whomever she saw, she then advanced
her mouth towards him, and became as it were prostrated; Zaratû*s*t
provided a remedy, *by* swiftly bringing up bread for her, *but* when
*he was* bringing it she had expired.

12\. About his own desire for the good quality <span
id="fr_471"></span>[4](#fn_467) of a wife, on account also of the will
of *his* parents, *and his* not mingling his own seed before a suitable
obtainment, this, too, is declared, that when his father sought a wife
for him, Zaratû*s*t argued with the bride (nêsh*â*) thus: 'Show me thy
face, so that I may find out (barkhâm) its kind of appearance, *and*
this, too, whether its appearance *be* undesirable, or shall not be
gratifying;' and the bride turned away her face from him. 13. And
Zaratû*s*t spoke thus:

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Whoever takes
away a sight from me, does not practise respect for me.'

14\. About his *having* accepted progress even from the iniquitous,
*that* listened sinfully desirous, who accepted so much advantageousness
as *was* manifest, this, too, is declared, that he came into an assembly
who were well known in the place for much knowledge, and he enquired of
them thus: 'What is most favourable for the soul?' 15. And they spoke
thus: 'To nourish the poor, to give fodder to cattle, to bring firewood
to the fire, to pour Hôm juice into water, and <span
id="fr_472"></span>[1](sbe4729.htm#fn_468) to worship many demons with
words, with the words which are called revelation (dênô).' 16. Then
Zaratû*s*t nourished the poor, foddered the cattle, brought firewood to
the fire, and squeezed Hôm into water, *but* never are any demons
whatever worshipped with words *by* Zaratû*s*t.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_459"></span>[151:2](sbe4728.htm#fr_463) The MSS. have
'three,' but there were five sons (Chap. XV, 5), and the numbers are
written in ciphers which are very easily corrupted.

<span id="fn_460"></span>[151:3](sbe4728.htm#fr_464) Pahl. 'Aragistân
ôdhâvŏ (T dhâ)' = 'odhâ-î Arangîstânŏ' of, P. Vd. I, 77 (Sp.); compare
Av. 'upa aodhaêshu Rang,hay*a*u,' of Vd. I, 19; Yt. XII, 18. In the
Irânian Bd. XX, 8 we are told that 'the Arang river is that of which
*it* is said that it comes out from Albûr*z* in the land of Sûrak, which
they call also Sham (Shim); and it passes on through the land of
Êgiptôs, which they call also Misr, and there they call it the swift
river Êgipitôis.' It is <span id="page_152">p. 152</span> one of the two
mythical rivers which were supposed to bound the Irânian world, and
seems to represent the Aras as a northern and the Nile as a western
boundary. Arang often becomes Arag in Pahlavi, just as sang becomes sag.

<span id="fn_461"></span>[152:1](sbe4728.htm#fr_465) Av. hanô in Vd.
III, 19, 20 &c.

<span id="fn_462"></span>[152:2](sbe4728.htm#fr_466) Probably holding
each other's hands.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[152:3](sbe4728.htm#fr_467) The sacred beings
who assist the righteous souls to pass over the *K*inva*d* bridge.

<span id="fn_464"></span>[153:1](sbe4728.htm#fr_468) See Dk. VII, iv, 7
n.

<span id="fn_465"></span>[153:2](sbe4728.htm#fr_469) T has 'seven,' but
this difference may have arisen from an erroneous mode of writing the
ciphers in T.

<span id="fn_466"></span>[153:3](sbe4728.htm#fr_470) T has 'a bone for
food.'

<span id="fn_467"></span>[153:4](sbe4728.htm#fr_471) T has 'good
child-bearing.'
