<p>1. About the wonderful striving of the fiend for the destruction of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t. 2. When it became near to his birth, the Fever demon, the Pain demon, and the Wind demon of Aharman, each one with 150 demons, have come out to kill Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, <I>and</I> from his spirit they have gone forth to his mother. 3. And she is hurried from there by Fever, Pain, and Wind; and at <I>the distance of</I> one league (parasang) <I>there</I> was a wizard, Impudent (Stork&#335;) by name, who was the most medical of wizards; in hope of practice he stood up from his seat, as she stopped in her progress.</p>  
<p>4. A messenger <I>of</I> A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> uttered a cry thus: 'Do not go to a wizard! for they are not healing (b&ecirc;shazin&icirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;r) for thee; but go back to the house, wash <I>thy</I> hands on the morrow with cow's butter held over the fire, also burn (t&acirc;p&#335;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_427"></A><A HREF="#fn_423"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> firewood</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_141"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 141</FONT></A></p>  
<p><I>and</I> incense for thy own self <I>and thy</I> progeny which is in thy womb.' 5. And she acted accordingly and became well&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_428"></A><A HREF="#fn_424"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; <I>and</I> the co-operators of the demon, <I>and</I> those of equal power, who <I>had</I> not obtained their remedy from her body, are again exposed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_429"></A><A HREF="#fn_425"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and spoke thus: 'On account of the existence of fire from all sides we have not succeeded; <I>it is</I> a help for every one who is her friend more than opponent; therefore it was not for us, because of the power within her.'</p>  
<p>6. The same night as she gave birth, Aharman selected commanders and arrayed his champions (g&ucirc;<I>r</I>d); there are <I>some</I> who <I>are</I> with one thousand demons, and there are <I>some</I> who <I>are</I> with two thousand demons; pursuing <I>and</I> attacking they have contended. 7. The opposing stand <I>of</I> the sacred, beings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_430"></A><A HREF="#fn_426"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, especially of the glory itself at the family&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_431"></A><A HREF="#fn_427"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> fire, was manifest at that birth; and for its splendour and brightness (pa<I>d</I>r&ocirc;k&#335;), settled opposite a distant place, they have then found no remedy.</p>  
<p>8. At last, Aharman sends Ak&ocirc;man&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_432"></A><A HREF="#fn_428"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> on, and spoke to him thus: 'Thou canst be very spiritual, who canst be most intimate; thou canst go with deceit into the mind of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, and make him turn</p>

<p><I>his</I> mind to us who are demons.' 9. And A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> sends Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc; on against him; Ak&ocirc;man&ocirc; advanced to the front, <I>and</I> had come forward to the door, <I>and</I> wished to go inside.</p>  
<p>10. Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc; schemingly (<I>k</I>&acirc;rak&#335;gar&icirc;h&acirc;) turned&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_433"></A><A HREF="#fn_429"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> back, and exclaimed to Ak&ocirc;man&ocirc; thus: 'Go inside!' 11. Ak&ocirc;man&ocirc; imagined thus: '<I>There</I> is nothing to be accomplished by me of what <I>was</I> mentioned to me, for Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc; has gone back.' 12. And Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc; went inside, <I>and</I> mingled with the reason (v&acirc;r&ocirc;m) of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, <I>and</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t laughed outright&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_434"></A><A HREF="#fn_430"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for Voh&ucirc;man&ocirc; is a gratifying spirit.</p>  
<p>13. Also seven wizards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_435"></A><A HREF="#fn_431"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> were seated before him, <I>and</I> owing to the light in the dwelling, his <I>having</I> laughed at birth was conveniently seen, which is opposed to the <I>habit</I> of the rest of mankind who cry out at birth <I>and</I> are quite terrified.</p>  
<p>14. Also, at the same time of birth, he authoritatively accepted the religion from A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>, as it is stated in revelation, that he spoke at birth thus: 'As is the will of the spiritual lord (ahv&ocirc;) mayst thou be who art the officiating priest (z&ocirc;t&#335;) (that is, mayst thou be the leader of the creatures)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_436"></A><A HREF="#fn_432"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>15. As Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, on account of his worldly body, spoke with a worldly voice, A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I> spoke <I>in</I> reply to him, on account of the spirits, thus: 'So</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_143"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 143</FONT></A></p>  
<p>mayst thou be the priestly authority (ra<I>d</I> sh&acirc;e), and so mayst thou be virtuous, owing to whatsoever righteousness <I>occurs;</I> and I confidently proclaim <I>thee</I> righteous (that is, I am thy controller)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_437"></A><A HREF="#fn_433"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>16. Another day, P&ocirc;r&ucirc;shasp&ocirc; went and enquired of the wizards who kept in front at the place, thus: 'What is the <I>cause</I> when infants cry out at birth, beyond that <I>which occurs</I> when they laugh out-right&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_438"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>?' 17. And they replied thus: 'Because <I>those who</I> are made to cry <I>have</I> seen mortality as <I>their</I> end, <I>and those</I> having laughed <I>have</I> seen their own righteousness.'</p>
