### CHAPTER XIII.

1\. About the glory of Zaratû*s*t becoming manifest even before *his*
birth, *it* is thus declared, that forty-five years before *the time*
when Zaratû*s*t came out to his conference <span
id="fr_420"></span>[2](#fn_416.md), when Frênŏ gave birth *to* the mother
of Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_421"></span>[3](#fn_417.md), whom they called
Dûk*d*ak, it

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

came down from the endless light, in the manner of fire, *and* mingled
with the fire which was before her; *and* from the fire it mingled with
the mother of Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_418.md).

2\. *For* three nights it was manifest, to all passers-by, as a species
of fire *in* the direction of the house, *and* passers *on* the road
always saw great radiance. 3. Also when she became fifteen years old,
the radiance of that glory which *was* in her, *was* even such *that*,
on the path she was walking *along*, its brightness *was* then shed by
her <span id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_419.md).

4\. About the combination of Zaratû*s*t, *whose* guardian spirit is
reverenced; that is, his guardian spirit, in the Hôm, and his glory are
given the cow's milk, by his father and mother drinking *it* up <span
id="fr_424"></span>[3](#fn_420), *and* his spiritual life (ahvô.md) came
into the combination, as was proclaimed *by* his statements in the
manuscript about the Guidance of the Ceremonial <span
id="fr_425"></span>[4](#fn_421.md).

5\. About the backward connection of Zaratû*s*t with Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
through the two who *are* Yim, the best of the worldly existences, and
Nêryôsang of the spirits. 6. The enumeration of the lineage of
Zaratû*s*t is Zaratû*s*t, *son of* Pôrûshaspô <span
id="fr_426"></span>[5](#fn_422.md), of Purtarâspô,

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

of Ahûrva*d*âspô, of Hâê*k*a*d*âspô, of *K*îkhshnû*s*, of Paîtiraspô, of
Are*g*a*d*arsî\*, of Kharedhar\*, of Spîtâmân, of Vaêdî*s*tô, of Ayazem,
of Frî*s*, of Ari*g*\*; of Dûrasrôbô, of Mânû*sk*îhar, of
Mânû*s*-khûrnar, of Mânû*s*-khûrnâk, whom Nêryôsang the messenger of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* *brought, and* whose mother was Vîzag, *daughter* of
Aryag, of Srîtak, of Bîtak, of Frazûsak, of Zû*s*ak, of Fragûzag, of
Gûzag, *daughter* of Aîrî*k*, *son* of Frê*d*ûn of the Âspîgâns to the
total of ten Âspîgâns, of Yim, of the Vîvang,has, of the Ayang,has, of
the Anang,has, of Hôshâng, of Fravâk, of Sîyâmak, of Masîyâ, of
Gâyômar*d*.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_416"></span>[138:2](sbe4721.htm#fr_420.md) That is, forty-five
years before he was thirty years old (see Chap. XXI, I-14).

<span id="fn_417"></span>[138:3](sbe4721.htm#fr_421.md) It is necessary to
translate in this manner, to agree with Dk. VII, ii, 3, but the text,
which is ambiguous. runs as follows: 'amat Frênŏg (Frênŏ-î?) Zaratû*s*t
am, zya*s*ân Dûk*d*akŏg ka*r*îtuntô, <span id="page_139">p. 139</span>
zerkhûntô;' which might also be translated thus: 'when Frênŏ, the mother
of Zaratû*s*t, whom they called Dûk*d*ak, was born.' This Frênŏ, whether
mother or daughter, does not seem to correspond with any Fr*e*ni
mentioned in the Avesta.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[139:1](sbe4721.htm#fr_422.md) See Dk. VII, ii, 2,
3.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[139:2](sbe4721.htm#fr_423.md) Ibid. 7, S.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[139:3](sbe4721.htm#fr_424.md) Ibid. 46, 47.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[139:4](sbe4721.htm#fr_425.md) Not identified, but
probably like the Nîrangistân.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[139:5](sbe4721.htm#fr_426.md) This genealogy was,
no doubt, derived originally from the same source as that in Dk. VII,
ii, 70, but there are several variations, especially in orthography,
which are here preserved, unless clearly copyist's blunders. The names
marked with an asterisk are written in Pâzand.
