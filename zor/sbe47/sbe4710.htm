<p>1. About the marvellousness which is manifested after the departure (v&icirc;kh&ecirc;<I>z</I>&#335;) of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, whose guardian spirit is reverenced, to the best existence, <I>and</I> in the life<I>time</I> of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp.</p>  
<p>2. One <I>marvel</I> is this which is declared by revelation, about the provision of a chariot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> by Sr&icirc;t&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the V&icirc;sraps&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; this is through a famous wonder and</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the coming of a report about the marvellousness of that chariot to Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp's begging that chariot from Sr&icirc;t&ocirc;, and Sr&icirc;t&ocirc; <I>saying</I> in reply to Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp: 'That chariot is for a righteous man, <I>in</I> which the soul of Sr&icirc;t&ocirc; in the life<I>time</I> of Sr&icirc;t&ocirc;'s body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> that of that man in the life<I>time</I> of his body, come visibly together once in the worldly existence.' 3. And the soul of Srit&ocirc;, through the generosity of that Sr&icirc;t&ocirc;, presents that chariot to the eyesight of that man of righteousness; thereby it becomes evident he had seen <I>it</I>, and is told not to act in another manner. 4. The exalted Ka&icirc;-V&icirc;<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, as becoming from revelation more particularly aware of this marvel about the future at that time, and for the sake of this marvel being published to the worldly existence (g&ecirc;h&acirc;n&icirc;g&icirc;h), and of <I>his</I> becoming</p>

<p><A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A></p>  
<p>more invoking <I>for</I> the supremacy of the Ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>a-worshipping religion, became discernible by those of the realm, is sought for, <I>and</I> is most attended.</p>  
<p>5. A great wonder became manifest to Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp and those of the world, just as revelation mentions thus: 'Thereupon the archangels are letting forth the soul of that <I>Sr&icirc;t&ocirc;</I> from the light of the supreme heaven, from the light on to the earth created by A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>; <I>and</I> the soul of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp proceeded from him into the light to meet <I>it</I>. 6. Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp proceeded on to the propitious south (rap&icirc;tv&icirc;n&#335;); he <I>was</I> producing more gain than the gainers, and he was more inquisitive than the inquisitive; to all whom he saw he spoke, and unto such as spoke he listened; when he gazed at them looking simultaneously they stood up, <I>and</I> obeisance <I>was</I> offered by them unto the soul <I>and</I> person of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp.'</p>  
<p>7. Immediately upon that no delay occurred until <I>there</I> came on at a run&#8212;<I>besides</I> the soul of Srit&ocirc; of the V&icirc;sraps&#8212;the most horrid (agrandt&ucirc;m) of demons, from the horrid northern quarter of the horrid destroyer (za<I>d</I>&acirc;r), that was himself black, and his deeds, too, were very black. 8. And as he comes himself, so also he grumbles to the soul of Sr&icirc;t&ocirc; thus: 'Give a maintenance (khv&acirc;rag) <I>to</I> Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp who is thy driver&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for the sake of good fellowship and service, and for that, righteousness is suitable unto a pure <I>one</I>; do not <I>give it</I> as a thing which is protective (that is, do not <I>give it</I> for the sake of worldly gratuity), <I>but</I> for love of the righteousness which is owing to the perfect existences.'</p>  
<p>9. When those words were fully heard by Sr&icirc;t&ocirc; of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the V&icirc;sraps, the early bestower (lev&icirc;n&#335;-vakhsh), he stood still and so he spoke in words thus: 'For righteousness I give thee, O mighty Ka&icirc;-Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp this chariot which is without a driver, only for love of the righteousness which is owing to the perfect existences.' 10. As much for righteousness as is best for righteousness, and as much for the soul as is best for the soul, the gift of the whole <I>was</I> secured (that is, its acceptance <I>was</I> announced as often as three times).</p>  
<p>11. Then that chariot became two chariots, one spiritual and the other worldly; in the worldly <I>one</I> the exalted Ka&icirc;-Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp travelled forth unto the village of the N&ocirc;<I>d</I>ars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the joyfulness <I>of</I> good thoughts, and in the spiritual <I>one</I> the soul of Sr&icirc;t&ocirc; of the V&icirc;sraps travelled forth unto the best existence.</p>  
<p>12. One <I>marvel</I> is this which is declared that in fifty-seven years onwards from the acceptance of the religion <I>by</I> Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the arrival of the religion is published in the seven regions&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; <I>and</I> within the life<I>time</I> of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, the circumstance (a&ecirc;<I>d</I>&ucirc;n&#335;&icirc;h) is manifested by the coming of <I>some</I> from <I>other</I> regions to Frash&ocirc;<I>s</I>tar of the Hv&ocirc;bas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> for enquiry <I>about</I> the</p>

<p>religion, <I>even</I> as revelation mentions thus: 'Two whose names are thus, Sp&icirc;t&ocirc;&icirc;<I>s</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and Arezr&acirc;sp&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, who have hastened unto Frash&ocirc;<I>s</I>tar of the Hv&ocirc;bas in search of wisdom.'</p>  
<p>13. Thus much splendour and wonder of Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp <I>and</I> those of the realm regarding Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and thus much due to the coming of the archangels from the sky to the earth before Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, as evidence about the true prophesying of Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; and that, too, about P&ecirc;shy&ocirc;tan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, the chariot of Sr&icirc;t&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and other subjects seen written above, <I>are</I> declared by the Avesta, which is the same that they accepted from Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, as the culmination&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> (<I>a</I><I>v</I>ar&icirc;g&acirc;n&icirc;h) of A&ucirc;ha<I>r</I>ma<I>z</I><I>d</I>'s words. 14. And if this splendour, glory, <I>and</I> wonder that <I>are</I> written above as regards <I>what</I> those learned <I>men</I> of the realm saw&#8212;which <I>are</I> in the statement revealed by the Avesta&#8212;<I>had</I> not occurred, king Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp and those learned <I>men</I> of the realm would not have seen what this Avesta had revealed to them&#8212;which <I>was</I> thus much splendour and wonder reported by it to them&#8212;<I>and</I> not one word about leaving <I>its</I> preservation to us would be annexed.</p>

XX, 11 (Sp.) we have Sr&icirc;t-&icirc; <A NAME="img_07800"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/07800.jpg"> (in L4), which latter name may also be &icirc;srap&acirc;n&#335;, though more likely to be read S&ecirc;r<I>z</I>&acirc;n&#335; when considered by itself. It is almost certain that the person mentioned in Pahl. Vd. XX, 11 is intended to be the same as that named here in the text. But it is doubtful if this person be the Av. Thrita son of S&acirc;yu<I>z</I>dri (or S&acirc;i<I>z</I>dri) of Yt. V, 72; XIII, 113. As the legend in the text appears to refer to the soul of Sr&icirc;t&ocirc;, or Thrita, revisiting the world to meet Vi<I>s</I>t&acirc;sp, this Sr&icirc;t&ocirc; may have been the warrior Sr&icirc;t&ocirc;, the seventh brother, employed by Ka&icirc;-&Ucirc;s, about 350 years earlier, to kill the frontier-settling ox of that time, but there seem to be no means of so identifying him with absolute certainty.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_223"></A><A HREF="sbe4710.htm#fr_223">78:1</A> This is the literal meaning of the Pahl.

The Indian copyists seem to have observed this, as they have omitted several words, so as to alter the meaning to the following:&#8212;'That chariot is for a man of the righteous, <I>with</I> whom Sr&icirc;t&ocirc; in the life<I>time</I> of that <I>man's</I> body comes visibly together, &amp;c.'
