# SELECTIONS OF ZÂ*D*-SPARAM <span id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_398.md).

### CHAPTER XII.

1\. About the coming of the religion at a *given* time *being* a
resemblance such-like as the birth of a child through two united powers,
which are the reception of semen *by* females in procreation, and
delivering *it* back to the fathers, and a period of struggling and
intermingling, especially by two means: a monarchy with <span
id="fr_403"></span>[2](#fn_399.md) religion of the same tenets
(ham-vâ*k*-dênôîh), and the existence of similar tenets to *those of*
the monarchy *in* the custom *of* the religion. 2. The religion *of* the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, when the period of material

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

organization is being converted again into a spiritual nature, became
manifest on the earth, first through Spenda*r*ma*d* <span
id="fr_404"></span>[1](#fn_400.md) *and* afterwards through Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
like the reception of a child *by* mothers *and* delivering it back to
the fathers.

3\. The manifestation of the religion through Spenda*r*ma*d* was at that
time when Frâsiyâ*v* <span id="fr_405"></span>[2](#fn_401.md) kept back the
water from the country of Irân, and brought the water again; in damsel
form she was a speaker for *its* manifestation, *in* reply *to*
foreigners, at the house of Mânû*sk*îhar <span
id="fr_406"></span>[3](#fn_402.md), the monarch of the country of Irân. 4.
She *was* also dressed, *and* wore radiant clothing which shone out on
all sides *for* the length of a Hâsar <span
id="fr_407"></span>[4](#fn_403.md), which is *a distance*, like a Parasang;
and, tied on her waist, she wore a golden *sacred* girdle which was the
religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers itself.

5\. As to the belt of the religion, it is *that* to which are connected
the thirty-three fetters upon the thirty-three sins <span
id="fr_408"></span>[5](#fn_404.md), according to which all sin is divided;
so that (kû) the damsels, by whom the tied sacred girdle of
Spenda*r*ma*d* *was* seen, have become impetuous (taftîgŏ) after that
for a tied girdle, on account of *its* seeming beautiful.

6\. And this was the motherhood which is supplied through
Spenda*r*ma*d*, as a gift, in the year 528

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

before Zaratû*s*t came out to *his* conference <span
id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_405.md), which is *one of* their statements from
the annals of the religion *in* a manuscript of the ancients.

7\. The name of Zaratû*s*t is also cited on the earth at 300 years
before his conference <span id="fr_410"></span>[2](#fn_406.md). 8. For
Irân, at the supplication even of the priests in the land, and for the
sake of the pacification of a dispute arisen, Aûha*r*ma*zd* produced a
great ox, by whom the boundary of Irân next to Tûrân was intimated by
pawing with *his* hoofs, and he was kept in a jungle. 9. Whenever
contention arose, the boundary was fully made known by that ox, until it
was the wish of Kai-Ûs to take, fully covetously, a portion of the land
of Tûrân back *into* Irân, and he saw that the ox is *about* to act very
ill-naturedly, because it was not besought with *forms* which were
prescribed for it, where a boundary was. intimated by it <span
id="fr_411"></span>[3](#fn_407.md).

10\. *There* were seven brothers, and he who was

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

the seventh was called Srîtô <span id="fr_412"></span>[1](#fn_408.md) the
Seventh, the largest in body *and* chief in strength, belonging to those
instructed in many subjects for Kaî-Ûs, and he was among his princes.
11. Kaî-Ûs summoned *him* into *his* presence and ordered *him* thus:
'Go and kill that ox in the jungle!'

12\. Sritô went, *and* the ox whom he wished to kill expostulated with
him, in human words, thus: 'Do not kill me! for though thou canst kill
me, he whose guardian spirit is in the Hôm, the death-dispeller, *will*
also become manifest on the earth, *he* whose name is Zaratû*s*t of the
Spîtâmas <span id="fr_413"></span>[2](#fn_409.md), and *will* proclaim thy
bad action in the world. 13. And the distress in thy soul becomes such
as is declared in revelation thus: "As it occurs to him, *so* it *does
to* Va*d*ak <span id="fr_414"></span>[3](#fn_410.md), when they mention his
iniquity," and thy death becomes the like and, owing to death, it is
mixed up with hers (that is, owing even to hers is the death of Srîtô).'

14\. When those words *were* heard by him, Srîtô turned back, *and* went
again to Kaî-Ûs; also by his manner, and even apart from this, he
stated <span id="fr_415"></span>[4](#fn_411.md) what the ox *had* spoken
with awfulness, *and also* thus:

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'I *am* more
desirous *than* any one who is in the earth *created by* righteousness,
*that* you *should* now order destruction for the ox.'

15\. And Kaî-Ûs uttered *his* will, with the conviction of superior
wisdom, thus: 'It is not certain whether he whose guardian spirit is in
the Hôm,' the death-dispeller, is himself, or not; and if he be, and be
born <span id="fr_416"></span>[1](#fn_412.md), *whether* he *will* become
manifest, or not;' and he commanded with severity, thus: 'Go and kill
it! '

16\. *And* Srîtô spoke thus: '*It is* not that I am without strength to
kill, because *its* reprieval by me *was* owing to its remonstrance,
mentioned to me, that a high-priest is to arise <span
id="fr_417"></span>[2](#fn_413.md).'

17\. So *it* is declared thus, *in* another revelation (dênô
zagâî) <span id="fr_418"></span>[3](#fn_414.md), when the Tûrânians *were*
backward *in* heart, Kaî-Ûs spoke thus: 'Go out to a certain jungle, in
which dwell many chiefs of the witches, and they *will* cut thee up
without *any* striving of heart.'

18\. And Srîtô went up to the jungle, *where* many witches saw him, who
kept their jaws open, and they *spoke* about the handsome *man* thus:
'Slay *and* do not spare!' 19. And compassion *having* gone out of his
heart, he went back to the *other* jungle and, with his fist, he broke
the back of the ox in three places; and the ox, awfully convulsed
(*s*kîftŏ barhamakŏ), kept *up* an outcry.

20\. After the slaughter of the ox, owing to its convulsed state which
*was* heard by him, the

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

remembrance of it then became grievous to Srîtô; and he went back to
Kaî-Ûs, and informed him how it was, and begged him that he *should*
finish off by slaying him <span id="fr_419"></span>[1](#fn_415.md), because
his life was not desirable.

21\. Kai-Ûs spoke thus: '*Shall* I slay thee, for it was not designed by
thee?'

22\. *And* Srîtô spoke thus: 'If thou wilt not slay me, then I *shall*
slay thee.'

23\. *Again* Kai-Ûs spoke thus: 'Do not thou slay me, for I am the
monarch of the world.'

24\. Srîtô continued *his* discontent, until Kaî-Ûs ordered him thus:
'Go out to a certain jungle; because a witch in the shape of a dog is in
it, and she will slay thee.'

25\. *Then* Srîtô went out to that jungle, and that witch in the shape
of a dog *was* seen by him; after he smote the witch, she became two;
and he constantly smote them till they became a thousand, and the host
(gir*d*ŏ) of *them* slew Srîtô on the spot.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_398"></span>[133:1](sbe4720.htm#fr_402.md) Zâ*d*-sparam was
Dastûr of Sîrkân, about thirty parasangs south of Kirmân, in A.D. 881.
At a later date, probably about A. D. 900, he compiled three series of
Selections, from religious texts then extant, and these have been
preserved by the Parsis in the same MSS. as contain the Dâ*d*istân-î
Dînîk (see the Introduction). The first eleven chapters of this first
series of Selections have been already translated in S.B.E., vol. v, pp.
155-186, as they refer to some of the subjects detailed in the
Bundahi*s*. The remaining chapters are here translated, except the last
which refers to the Nasks and Gâthas, and will be found in S.B.E., vol.
xxxvii, pp. 401-405. The MS. authorities for the text are K35 and T (see
[p. 2](sbe4704.htm#page_2) and Introduction.md).

<span id="fn_399"></span>[133:2](sbe4720.htm#fr_403.md) T has 'devoid of.'

<span id="fn_400"></span>[134:1](sbe4720.htm#fr_404.md) The female
archangel who has special charge of the earth and virtuous women (see
Dk. VII, ii, 19 n).

<span id="fn_401"></span>[134:2](sbe4720.htm#fr_405.md) See Dk. VII, i, 31;
and regarding his irrigation canals, see Bd. XX, 17, 34; XXI, 6.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[134:3](sbe4720.htm#fr_406.md) See Dk. VII, i, 29.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[134:4](sbe4720.htm#fr_407.md) A thousand steps of
the two feet, or Roman mile; see Bd. XXVI, r.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[134:5](sbe4720.htm#fr_408.md) Thirty sins are
detailed in Mkh. XXXVI, and thirty-three good works in XXXVII (see
S.B.E., vol. xxiv, pp. 71-75).

<span id="fn_405"></span>[135:1](sbe4720.htm#fr_409.md) If this coming to
conference with the spirits be 'the coming of the religion,' in the
thirtieth year of Vi*s*tâsp's reign, then, according to Bundahi*s*
chronology, these 528 years will carry us back to twenty-eight years
before the accession of Mânû*sk*îhar. As any alteration in the date of
Mânû*sk*îhar's accession would disturb the millennial arrangement of Bd.
XXXIV, it is probable that some copyist has miswritten the ciphers, and
we ought to read 428. This legend appears not to occur elsewhere.

<span id="fn_406"></span>[135:2](sbe4720.htm#fr_410.md) According to Bd.
XXXIV, 7, Kaî-Ûs reigned from 360 to 210 years before 'the coming of the
religion.' At this point a dislocation of the text occurs in all
existing MSS., owing to the misplacement of a loose folio in some
unknown copy written before 1530; the contents of this folio, §§ 8-16,
are found in the existing MSS. three folios further on (after Chap. XIV,
14), and are here restored to their original position, as determined by
the meaning of the text.

<span id="fn_407"></span>[135:3](sbe4720.htm#fr_411.md) T has 'by that ox.'
This legend is also told in Dk. VII. ii. 62-66.

<span id="fn_408"></span>[136:1](sbe4720.htm#fr_412.md) Srîtô, the seventh
son (compare Dk. VII, ii, 64), is not easy to identify. He could not
have been Thrita the father of Keresâspa, because this Thrita the Sâmân
is said to have been a third son in Pahl. Yas. IX, 30 (Sp.). He may have
been Srîtô of the Vîsraps, whose soul visited Vi*s*tâsp in the latter
part of his reign, about 350 years later, regarding which a legend is
related in Dk. VII, vi, 2-11, and again mentioned in Dk. V, iii, 2; but
there is a want of corresponding details for identification.

<span id="fn_409"></span>[136:2](sbe4720.htm#fr_413.md) This is the
citation of his name mentioned in § 7.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[136:3](sbe4720.htm#fr_414.md) The mother of
Dahâk, whose iniquity is considered as equal to that of the evil spirit,
see Dd. LXXII, 5; Dk. IX, x, 3.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[136:4](sbe4720.htm#fr_415.md) T has 'also by his
manner he intimated *and* separately stated.'

<span id="fn_412"></span>[137:1](sbe4720.htm#fr_416.md) T omits 'and be
born.'

<span id="fn_413"></span>[137:2](sbe4720.htm#fr_417.md) The misplaced
folio, which begins with § 8, ends here, but it is not quite certain
that a few lines of text are not still missing.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[137:3](sbe4720.htm#fr_418.md) T has 'at another
*time* (bên zagâî).'

<span id="fn_415"></span>[138:1](sbe4720.htm#fr_419.md) T has 'that he
*should* command the slaying of him.'
