### CHAPTER VII.

1\. About the marvellousness which is manifested after *the time of*
Vi*s*tâsp until the collapse (han*g*aftanŏ) *of* the sovereignty of
Iran.

2\. There is marvellousness *which* is manifested after Vi*s*tâsp until
the collapse of the sovereignty of Irân, apart from the blessedness of
ordeal, the accomplishment of other Avestic rites, the great power over
the sacred fires, *and* many other religious observances *which* were
connected with the disciples of Zaratû*s*t.

3\. Even after the devastation which happened owing to Alexander, those
who *were* rulers after him brought back much to the collection from a
scattered state <span id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_236.md); *and* there are
*some* who *have* ordered the keeping *of it* in the treasury of
Shapân <span id="fr_237"></span>[2](#fn_237.md).

4\. Likewise there is to be brought *forward* what *there is* concerning
the names of rulers *and* high-priests, *such* as arrive for it at times
*and* periods, which *are* each consecutive, as organizers *of* the
religion and the world; also of the tyrant *or* apostate, who is
manifest at various periods, for the disturbance of the religion *and*
monarchy and the penance of the world, *with* the coming of the
penitential *one*.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

5\. *Such* as Vohûmanô, son *of* Spend-ad <span
id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_238.md), of the rulers, about whom it says even
this in the Avesta, that *he is* Vohûmanô, the just, who is the most
efficient of the assembly of Ma*zd*a-worshippers. 6. And *S*ênôv <span
id="fr_239"></span>[2](#fn_239.md) of the high-priests, as about him it
says even this: 'The religion becomes a hundred years *old* when *S*ênôv
is born, and two hundred years when he passes away; he was also the
first Ma*zd*a-worshipper *with* a life of a hundred *years*, *and* who
walks forth upon this earth with a hundred disciples.'

7\. Also Alexander of the devastators, as it says even this of him in
revelation <span id="fr_240"></span>[3](#fn_240.md), that *in* those three
winters, which *are* of like purpose (ham-ay*âz*akŏ), that Aeshm <span
id="fr_241"></span>[4](#fn_241.md) would set up a deadly king in the
impenitent world, who is the evil-destined Alexander.

8\. And of the high-priests *are* Ar*ez*vâk <span
id="fr_242"></span>[5](#fn_242.md), the interpretation of whose name is
'the pure word;' Srûtvôk-spâ*d*âk <span id="fr_243"></span>[5](#fn_242.md),
the interpretation of whose name is 'the propitious recitation;'
Zrayang,h*a*u <span id="fr_244"></span>[6](#fn_243.md), the interpretation
of whose name is 'the ocean existence' and Spe*n*tô-khratv*a*u <span
id="fr_245"></span>[6](#fn_243.md), the interpretation of

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

whose name is 'the propitious wisdom.' 9. Because it says even this
about them, namely: 'I mention thy manifestation, *and* also the tokens
of its publicity when this religion of thy Ma*zd*a-worshippers becomes
four hundred years *old* <span id="fr_246"></span>[1](#fn_244.md); in this
law benightedness (lêlyâîh) arises, *and* the embodied existences see
the manifestation through calculation *of* the planets and also the
stars; and whoever, too, *are* mine are *so* for a century, through the
average opinion *of* thirty medium winters for a man <span
id="fr_247"></span>[2](#fn_245.md); *and* the righteous Ar*ez*vâk and those
three others are they of the most righteous existences, over whom they
*are* the most masterly *and* most authoritative in that time.' to. And
this, too, that they who glorify the religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers
in the fifth and sixth centuries are they; *and* no persons save *their*
souls, except *those* who remain for the arrival of the four <span
id="fr_248"></span>[3](#fn_246.md) interpretations that *arise* through the
authority of these four individuals, Ar*ez*vâk, Srûtô-spâdh*a*u <span
id="fr_249"></span>[4](#fn_247.md), Zrayang,h*a*u, *and*
Spe*n*tô-khratv*a*u who, all four of them, seek *their* thoughts, words,
*and* deeds in the *sacred* text (mânsar).

11\. Also Rashn-rêsh <span id="fr_250"></span>[5](#fn_248.md) is the
apostate of that

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

time, as *some one* <span id="fr_251"></span>[1](#fn_249.md) says unto
Rashn, *one* of the sacred beings, and about many besides this *one*,
thus: 'All who are creatures of the beneficent spirit are distressed by
their persecution, *but* put trust in those men, Ar*ez*vâk *and* those
three others.'

12\. And of the organizers of the period is Artakhshatar <span
id="fr_252"></span>[2](#fn_250.md), son of Pâpak, as it says even this
about him, namely: 'Which is that ruler who is powerful, more striving
than the Kayâns, *and* mighty, an embodiment of the *sacred*
commandments and awfully armed <span id="fr_253"></span>[3](#fn_251.md); in
whose abode Aharî*s*vang <span id="fr_254"></span>[4](#fn_252.md), the
virtuous *and* radiant, walks forth in maiden form, beneficent and very
strong, well-formed, high-girded, and truthful, of illustrious race
*and* noble? 13. Whoever it is that, on the occurrence of strife, seeks
prosperity for *him*self with his own arm; who-ever it is that, on the
occurrence of strife, encounters the enemies with his own arm.'

14\. Tanvasar <span id="fr_255"></span>[5](#fn_253.md) is also for his
assistance, as it says

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

this, too, about them: 'Zaratû*s*t asked again thus: "Who is he who is
the most salutary *for* a country, which the demons *have* exhausted of
everything virtuous, over which his authority is brought and *which* is
wicked and teaching falsehood?" 15. Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: "An
autocrat (sâstâr), to cure a country, who *has* not gone *mad* (that is,
he does not annoy the good) and is well-directing (that is, he gives
virtuous commands), who is *also* of noble race, and likewise a priest
who is acquainted with war, of a famous province, *and* righteous, are
most salutary *for* that country. 16. And I tell thee this, that the
apostasy of destruction is *just* like the four-legged wolf which the
world gives up to running astray (var*d*ak-takhshi*s*nîh) (that is,
owing to its action *they are* leading *it* off as astray; which is so
that even he who is not opulent is rendered sickly, that they (*the
apostates*) may take away his things by the hand of the assassin
(khûnyân); and they shall lead the world, the dwelling for *his*
residence, into wandering. 17. But that wicked (*av*ârûnŏ) strife
descended upon that country, besides that wicked demon-worship, besides
that wicked slander; and not even that wicked strife, nor that wicked
demon-worship, nor that wicked slander, is dissipated from

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

that country until *the time* when they attach the grant of approval to
him, the spiritual leader, the eloquent (pûr-gûftâr), truthful-speaking,
*and* righteous Tanvasar. 18. And it is when they grant approval to the
spiritual leader, the truthful speaker of eloquence, the righteous
Tanvasar, that those *of* the country obtain redress (bêsh*âz*agânîh)
when they seek *it*, and no deviation (anâyûînakŏîh) from the religion
of Zaratû*s*t."'

19\. As to the nature of the questions *and* statements of the organizer
of the religion, Âtûrpâ*d* <span id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_254.md) son of
Mâ*r*aspend, about the connection of the glory with the race, it also
says this, that 'though righteousness *may* arise from the statements
and prosperity of the Tûrânians when extracted by questions, *it is*
said that its acceptance occurs there through complete mindfulness <span
id="fr_257"></span>[2](#fn_255.md); they benefit the embodied world of
righteousness, and produce distress for the fiend; in like manner, they
rely upon Vohûmanô, *and* Zaratû*s*t is their delight through the report
of the birth *of* Zaratû*s*t from us who are archangels. 20. This
liberality for thee is *from* us who are archangels, *and* Âtûrpâ*d*,
the very best well-destined *man* arose; and this, too, do thou say
about him, that it is the steel age in which that man, the organizer of
development *and* organizer of righteousness, Âtûrpâ*d* son of
Mâ*r*aspend, of the convocation, begets Avarethrab*a*u <span
id="fr_258"></span>[3](#fn_256.md).'

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

21\. This Avarethrab*a*u, too, is an organizer whose righteous guardian
spirit we reverence, and *in* memory of Mânû*sk*îhar, the well-destined,
and a progenitor of Âtûrpâ*d* <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_257.md), it
says that 'only from him *comes* Avarethrab*a*u;' and *then also arises*
this *one* of the adversaries of the religion, the apostate of
apostates, whom they have even called the Mazdag-like
(Mazdagîg-i*k*) <span id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_258.md). 22. As it says
this, too, about them, namely: 'This religion of mine thou dost survey
with thoughts of spiritual life, thou dost very thoroughly inspect *it*,
*O* Zaratû*s*t! when many, aware of apostates, call the performance of
righteousness and even the priesthood innocence, and few are frank and
practising *it*.' 23. In the revelation of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers is
this, namely: 'Thoroughly look into revelation, and seek a remedy for
them and any whatever of them who have become disturbing in the embodied
existence, and uncaptivated *by* the orthodox (âyîn-aûmônd)
righteousness which is owing to the perfect existences; and so they
divide the religion of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers through division of race,
they speak regarding the action *of* their own *followers*, and give the
endowment to their own. 24. They grant supplies of food, so that they
*may* say the food is proportional to the hunger; they speak of
procreation, *and* say that they say lineage is through the mothers; and
they approve of wolfishness, so that they would act something like

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

wolves *in* the performance of gratifying their desires, like that of
the wolf's progeny behind the mother. 25. Moreover, they form their
lineage through the mothers; buying their women *as* sheep, they shall
carry off for profit even that son *or* brother who is the progeny,
those that we have produced for your companionship; you are not
predominant, but *have* remained in companionship; you do not even
believe them, *but* you do not establish an ordeal, although *it is*
evident that you will be acquitted they lie even to *their* children, so
that the advance of the promise-breaker is through them, and even in
their own persons <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_259.md).'

26\. Here it speaks about the organization of the religion *by* the
glorified <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_260.md) Khûsrôî, son of Kavâ*d*,
thus: 'Upon their lingering behind, a man is produced who is righteous,
the Glorified *one* <span id="fr_263"></span>[2](#fn_260.md), an approver
(khênî*d*âr) of speech who is wise, whom the convocation, on hearing the
words that he utters, speaks *of* as a high-priest; that is when he
gives out penance (srôshîgîh), so that he may effect the punishment of
sinners. 27. The constant out-pouring of perplexity (pê*k* shârî*d*an)
*by* the perverters is the fear of that hero, as regards that

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

convocation, when he casts *them forth* by expulsion from the vicinity,
so that he may make *them* extinguished very quickly; owing to that,
they, *whose* producer is even he who is a person destroying the
righteous man, become gloomy on account of the Glorified *one*, through
*his* smiting the spiritual life of apostasy; *just* as now, when he who
is gloomy, *and* of scattered intellect, is gloomy owing to you *of* the
Spîtâmas.' 28. This, too, it states, namely: 'In every way, I tell thee,
*O* Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas! that their time is mistrustful
(av*âv*ar) as to him who is an open friend, *and* most deceitful both
*to* the wicked and the righteous; the Glorified *one* is a controller
(ayûkhtâr) exalting the creatures, *and* whoever is possessing the
creatures of the righteous *ones* <span id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_261.md),
so that he remains again at work in the doings of the Glorified *one*,
is *he* who is a combiner *of* the actions *and* an utterer of the true
replies *of* that Glorified *one*.'

29, And about the occurrence of a symptom of the devastators of the
sovereignty *and* religion of the country of Irân one wonder, which is
associated with the religion, is even this *which* it mentions thus:
'Thereupon, when the first symptom of a ravager *of* the country occurs,
*O* righteous Zaratû*s*t! then the more aggressive and more unmerciful
*in* malice becomes the tyrant of the country, and through him, too,
they ravage (rêshênd) the house, through him the village, through him
the community, through him the province, *and* through him even the
whole *of* that manifestation *in* the country *of* any teaching
whatever that occurs *through* the ravager *of* the country; and so the
country should

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

keep a man who is observant *and* learned on the watch, because
information is in his mind. 30. *Thereupon, when the second symptom of a
ravager of the country occurs, &c.* <span
id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_262.md) . . . . . . . . . . 31. Thereupon, when
the third symptom *of* a ravager *of* the country occurs, the priestly
people are disturbing the tradition, so that they speak nothing wisely;
it is even on this account they do not accept them, and it is not when
*one* speaks truly *that* the ravager *of* the country believes them,
and through him, too, they ravage the house, through him the village,
*through him the community*, through him the province, and through him
even the whole *of* that manifestation *in* the country *of* any
teaching whatever *that* occurs *through* the ravager *of* the country;
and so, too, the country should keep a man who is observant *and*
learned on the watch, because information is in his mind. 32. Thereupon,
when the fourth symptom *of* a ravager of the country occurs, it upsets
the replenishment of the fires, and upsets those men of the righteous,
so that they shall not undertake the care of them; and thus they shall
not convey the holy-water to him who is a priestly authority, so that
they may not produce the seizing upon the stipend *of* the priestly
authorities *by* him who is the ravager *of* the country; through him,
too, they ravage the house, through him the village, through him the
community, through him *the province, and through him* even the whole
*of* that

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

manifestation *in* the country *of* any teaching whatever *that* occurs
*through* the ravager *of* the country; *and* so, too, the country
should keep a man who is observant *and* learned on the watch, because
information is in his mind.'

33\. About the collapse of the sovereignty of Irân, it also states this,
namely: 'That very villain (mar), *O* Zaratû*s*t! brings those provinces
on to running astray, so that he may make-those quite dissevered which
constitute the existence of that powerful sovereignty; and then he is a
thorough assailant of the righteous, then he is an assailant *of* the
righteous with eagerness. 34. That same deadly *one* (mar), *O*
Zaratû*s*t! does not continue living long afterwards; moreover his
offspring disappear (that is, they perish utterly); but his soul falls
to the bottom of the gloomy existence which is horrible hell, and upon
their bodies every kind *of* unseemly unhappiness comes from themselves,
owing to their own actions when they give approval to the imprisonment
of a guardian of spiritual *affairs* who is eloquent, true-speaking,
*and* righteous. 35. Against that deadly *one* he contends, *O*
Zaratû*s*t! for the spiritual lordship *and* priestly authority that I
approve *as* good *for* the whole embodied existence; also against the
preparation of a decree to produce evil decisions, *and* against the
dismissal of litigants, whether heterodox or orthodox, who are of a
family of serfs of a far-situated village and are making petitions.'

36\. 'And *as to* the land, too, over which he wanders, the evil spirit
utterly devastates their country through pestilence and other misery;
and, moreover, strife which is tormenting falls upon that

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

country, besides demon-worship which is iniquitous, *and* besides
slander which is iniquitous. 37. And the strife which is iniquitous is
not to be dissipated (*a*pâsî-aîtanŏ) from that country, nor the
demon-worshippers who *are* iniquitous, nor the slander which is
iniquitous, before the *time* when they give approval to him, to the
priest who is a guardian of spiritual *affairs*, who is eloquent,
true-speaking, and righteous; and it is when they give him approval,
that they obtain healthfulness *for* their country when they pray *for
it*, and not irregularly from him, O Zaratû*s*t! '

38\. And this which is recounted is a statement that is execrated
(nafrîg-aîtŏ) by many, details from the Avesta as to occurrences *that
will* arise after Vi*s*tâsp until the dispersion (ang*âv*i*s*nŏ) of the
sovereignty of Irân from the country of Irân; *it is also* declared that
this which is written happened *to* the knowledge of those of the world.
39. This, too, is about the evidence of the above:—'And if this which is
declared from the Avesta, as to *what* happens after Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp until
the end of the sovereignty of Irân, should not have happened, and *it
being* the pre-eminence of the Avesta which really became this present
treasure, it thereby ensues, owing to its position in that
*former* <span id="fr_266"></span>[1](#fn_263.md), and the manifest absence
of the destruction of those rulers *and* high-priests from Vi*s*tâsp
onwards in this *latter* <span id="fr_267"></span>[2](#fn_264.md), that it
could not be connected with us <span id="fr_268"></span>[3](#fn_265.md).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_236"></span>[82:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_236.md) Referring to king
Valkha*s* the A*s*kânian (probably Vologeses I, see S.B.E., vol. xxxvii,
p. 413); possibly also to Ardashîr Pâpakân.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[82:2](sbe4711.htm#fr_237.md) So here, but usually
written Shapîgân, and sometimes Shaspîgân. It was no doubt a royal
treasury, and Dk. V, iii, 4, calls it so, but uses the words gan*g*ŏ-î
khû*d*âyân, in which *G*âmâsp is said to have deposited the Avesta and
Zand written in gold upon ox-hides. If Shapîgân be a corruption of
shâyagân, 'royal,' it is singular that some copyist has not corrected
the spelling.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[83:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_238.md) Av. Spe*n*tô-dâta of
Yt. XIII, 103, a son of Vi*s*tâsp, with whom Avesta dynastic history
ends. He was the Persian Isfendiyâr, and his son Vohûmanô is unknown to
the Avesta. The *K*itradâ*d* Nask (Dk. VIII, xiii, 18) mentions a
'Namûn, son of Spend-shê*d*,' which probably stands for 'Vohûmanô, son
of Spend-dâ*d*.' but this appears to have been in a Pahlavi supplement
compiled in Sasanian times. He is also mentioned in Bd. XXXIV, 8, a
chapter 'about the computation of years by the Arabs,' according to the
Irânian Bundahi*s*.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[83:2](sbe4711.htm#fr_239.md) Av. Saêna of Yt.
XIII, 97, where the last clause of the passage here translated from the
Avesta occurs. Compare Zs. XXIII, 11.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[83:3](sbe4711.htm#fr_240.md) Not in the extant
Avesta.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[83:4](sbe4711.htm#fr_241.md) The demon of Wrath.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[83:5](sbe4711.htm#fr_243.md) Av. gen. Erezv*a*u
and Srûtô-spâd*a*u in Yt. XIII, 115.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[83:6](sbe4711.htm#fr_245.md) These two names are
written in their Av. gen. forms, as they occur in Yt. XIII, 115.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[84:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_246.md) If the chronology in
Bd. XXXIV, 7, 8 were correct, the interval between the first revelation
of the religion and the death of Alexander would be 272 years, and this
would make the 400th year of the religion coincide with B.C. 195.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[84:2](sbe4711.htm#fr_247.md) That is, for a
generation. The meaning appears to be, that these four successive
high-priests insure the continuance of orthodox religion for more than a
century, or well into the sixth century of the religion, as mentioned in
§ 10.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[84:3](sbe4711.htm#fr_248.md) The MS. has the
cipher for 'three,' by mistake.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[84:4](sbe4711.htm#fr_249.md) Here written in
Avesta characters.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[84:5](sbe4711.htm#fr_250.md) In Dk. III, cxcviii,
2, this apostate is said to have been an <span id="page_85">p. 85</span>
associate (ham-p*âî*gar) of the Christian ecclesiastic Akvân, and yells
out ten admonitions contradicting those of the righteous *S*ênôv who is
mentioned in § 6 (see Peshotan's edition, vol. v, pp. 239, 311). It does
not follow that he was a contemporary of *S*ênôv, and here he seems to
be placed fully two centuries later.

<span id="fn_249"></span>[85:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_251.md) Probably
Aûha*r*ma*zd*.

<span id="fn_250"></span>[85:2](sbe4711.htm#fr_252.md) The founder of the
Sâsânian dynasty, who reigned as king of the kings of Persia, A*D*.
226-241.

<span id="fn_251"></span>[85:3](sbe4711.htm#fr_253.md) Most of these
qualities are applied to the angel Srôsh, the personification of
obedience (see Yas. LVII, 1); also to Kavi Vi*s*tâspa and Karsna, son of
Zbaurva*n*t, in Yt. XIII, 99, 106.

<span id="fn_252"></span>[85:4](sbe4711.htm#fr_254.md) Av. Ashi*s* vanguhi,
'good rectitude,' personified as a female angel; her description is
given in Yt. XIII, 107, and is similar to that of Anâhita in Yt. V, 64.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[85:5](sbe4711.htm#fr_255.md) So spelt here and in
§§ 17, 18, thrice in all; it is also thrice spelt Tansar, in Dk. III,
last chapter, 7; IV, 25, 25, and this mis-spelling has led to the
mis-pronunciation Tôsar. It appears, however, that Tanvasar is a
transposition of Tanvars, 'hairy-bodied,' <span id="page_86">p.
86</span> because we are told that Tansar, or Tanvasar, was so called on
account of all his limbs being covered with hair (vars). his statement
occurs in the introduction to Tanvasar's letter to Gushnaspshâh (Ar.
*G*asnasf-shâh), king of Pa*d*ashkhvârgar (Ar. Farshvâdgar) and
Tabaristân; and is made on the authority of an old Pahlavi copyist,
Bahrâm Khûrzâd, whose Pahlavi was translated into Arabic by Ibn
al-Muqaffa in the middle of the eighth century, and that into Persian
early in the thirteenth century (see Darmesteter's edition in Journal
Asiatique for 1894, pp. 185-250, 502-555).

<span id="fn_254"></span>[87:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_256.md) A high-priest who
was prime minister of king Shahpûhar II (A*D*. 309-379). He is often
mentioned in Pahlavi writings, but in the Avesta he is only alluded to,
apparently, by the title Râ*s*tare-vaghe*n*t in Yt. XIII, 106.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[87:2](sbe4711.htm#fr_257.md) A translation of Av.
spe*n*ta-ârmaiti, the archangel Spendâ*r*ma*d*.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[87:3](sbe4711.htm#fr_258.md) So written, all
three times in Pâzand. He is the Avarethra-bangh, <span id="page_88">p.
88</span> son of Râ*s*tare-vaghe*n*t of Yt. XIII, 106, better known as
Zaratû*s*t, son of Âtûrpâ*d* in his old age, for whom the Andar’z-î
Âtûrpâ*d*-î Mâ*r*aspendân was written.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[88:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_259.md) Whose pedigree is
traced back to Mânû*sk*îhar in Bd. XXXIII, 3.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[88:2](sbe4711.htm#fr_260.md) Probably some
disciple of Mânih, the heretic who had been put to death A*D*. 276-7.
Mazdag was put to death A*D*. 528. See S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. 257 n,
278 n.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[89:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_261.md) This quotation, from
a Pahlavi version of an Avesta text, would probably be very applicable
to the state of the Persian people at many periods in the fourth and
fifth centuries, when heresy was prevalent and orthodox Zoroastrianism
was by no means universal. Some of the evils mentioned are inseparable
from slavery at all times.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[89:2](sbe4711.htm#fr_263.md) Literally
'immortal-soulled,' Anôshak-rûbân, the usual title of king Khusrô I, who
reigned A. D. 531-578. Before he became king, A. D. 528 or 529, he had
summoned an assembly of priests to condemn the heretic Mazdag, when the
last important revision of the Pahlavi versions of the Avesta probably
took place (see Byt. I, 6-8, and Nöldeke's Gesch. der Sas. pp. 463-466).

<span id="fn_261"></span>[90:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_264.md) Of the good spirits.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[91:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_265.md) The whole of this
section is omitted in the old MS., evidently by mistake. Perhaps the
second symptom of devastation was connected with the evil deeds of the
warrior class, but this is very uncertain. Passages of four or five
words are also omitted by the MS. in §§ 31, 32.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[93:1](sbe4711.htm#fr_266.md) The above
declaration from the Avesta.

<span id="fn_264"></span>[93:2](sbe4711.htm#fr_267.md) The present Avesta
itself.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[93:3](sbe4711.htm#fr_268.md) Meaning perhaps
that, for some good reason, it could not be communicated to us in the
extant Avesta. If § 39 be not a later addition to this chapter, it
implies that the prophetical quotations from the Avesta, regarding the
history of the religion after the time <span id="page_94">p. 94</span>
of Vi*s*tâsp, were no more extant in the Avesta, when the Dînka*rd* was
compiled, than they are now.
