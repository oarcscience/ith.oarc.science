### CHAPTER XXII.

1\. About the seven questionings (7-fra*s*nŏîh), with reference to
religion, of the seven archangels, *which* occurred in seven
places <span id="fr_495"></span>[2](#fn_491.md).

2\. For the occurrence of the first questioning <span
id="fr_496"></span>[3](#fn_492.md), that of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the person of
Zaratû*s*t, who *was*

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

the upholder of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, came out to a conference on the bank of
the water of Dâîtîh <span id="fr_497"></span>[1](#fn_493.md).

3\. For the occurrence of the second, *which* is Vohûmanô's, five
animals out of the five species <span id="fr_498"></span>[2](#fn_494.md)
which are the worldly tokens of Vohûmanô, have come with Zaratû*s*t to a
conference on Hûgar and Aûsind <span id="fr_499"></span>[3](#fn_495.md);
and on that day also, before their coming out to the conference, *their*
tongues are fully liberated *and* spoke with human words. 4. And among
the rest <span id="fr_500"></span>[4](#fn_496.md) is a fish of one species,
Arzuvâ <span id="fr_501"></span>[5](#fn_497.md) *by* name; of those in
burrows (khanŏîgânŏ) *are* the white ermine *and* white marten; of the
flying creatures (vâyandagân) is the Kar*s*ipt <span
id="fr_502"></span>[6](#fn_498.md), a bird like a species of water-fowl; of
the wide-travellers (farâkhvŏ-raftârânŏ) is the hare which is showing
wild beasts the way to the water; and of those suitable for grazing
(*k*arakŏ-ar*g*ânîgân) is the white ass-goat; with human words they also
accepted the religion from Aûha*r*ma*zd*. 5. With the chieftainship of
the five species they are intrusted, so that the like animals also, with
their own voices, *and* as much as their knowledge is capable, shall
recount the powerfulness *of* the religion.

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 6. And freedom
from assault, exemption from persecution, and proper maintenance of the
five species of animals, *were* prescribed by him <span
id="fr_503"></span>[1](#fn_499.md) to Zaratû*s*t with seemingly very awful
admonition.

7\. For the occurrence of the third questioning, which is
A*rd*avahi*s*tô's, the spirits of the fires have come out with
Zaratû*s*t to a conference at the Tô*g*ân water <span
id="fr_504"></span>[2](#fn_500.md); and, in that questioning, care for the
proper maintenance of the Varahrân fire <span
id="fr_505"></span>[3](#fn_501.md), and the propitiation of all fires, is
explained to him.

8\. For the occurrence of the fourth questioning, which is Shatvê*r*'s,
the spirits of the metals have come with Zaratû*s*t to a conference at
Sarâî <span id="fr_506"></span>[4](#fn_502.md), a settlement on the
Mîvân <span id="fr_507"></span>[4](#fn_502.md); *and he was* fully
admonished about various proper preservations of the metals, *and as to*
not producing warlike accoutrements of gold.

9\. For the occurrence of the fifth questioning, which is
Spenda*r*ma*d*'s, the spirits of the regions, frontiers, stations
(aûstâmân), settlements (rû*d*astâkân), and districts, as many as were
desirable, have come out with Zaratû*s*t to a conference *where* there
is a spring (khânîgô-aê) which comes out from the Asnavad mountain <span
id="fr_508"></span>[5](#fn_503.md), *and* goes into the Dâîtîh, like those
of Satavês who is blowing the Pâîrîgs <span
id="fr_509"></span>[6](#fn_504.md). 10. And *Zaratû*s*t was* also thus
admonished

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

by her, about the care and propitiation of the earth: that each district
is *to be* intrusted *to* a faithful testifier (gôkâs-î v*âv*ar), each
settlement *to* a judge acquainted with the law, *each* station *to* an
officiating priest (magôpatŏ) of just intentions, *and* each frontier
*to* a pure priestly authority (ra*d*ŏ); over all is proclaimed the
councillor of the spirits, the supreme priest (magôpatânŏ magôpatŏ), and
through him the sovereignty of Aûha*r*ma*zd* is provided.

11\. For the occurrence of the sixth questioning, which is
Khû*r*da*d*'s, the spirits of seas *and* rivers have come with
Zaratû*s*t to a conference at the Asnavad mountain <span
id="fr_510"></span>[1](#fn_505.md), and he *was* told about the care and
propitiation of water.

12\. For the occurrence of the seventh questioning, which is
Amû*r*da*d*'s, the spirits of plants have come out with Zaratû*s*t to a
conference on the precipitous bank of the Dare*g*a <span
id="fr_511"></span>[2](#fn_506), on the bank (bâr.md) of the water of
Dâîtîh, and different places; and he *was* informed about the care *and*
propitiation of plants.

13\. The seven questionings are explained within the length of these
winters, which are *of* five months, *and* within ten years <span
id="fr_512"></span>[3](#fn_507.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_491"></span>[159:2](sbe4730.htm#fr_495.md) Compare Dk. VIII,
xiv, 5, 6, 9.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[159:3](sbe4730.htm#fr_496.md) This has been
narrated in the preceding chapter.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[160:1](sbe4730.htm#fr_497.md) See Dk. VII, iii,
51, 54.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[160:2](sbe4730.htm#fr_498.md) These species,
which are named in § 4, are those mentioned in the Avesta, Visp. I, I.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[160:3](sbe4730.htm#fr_499.md) Av. Hukairya of Yt.
XII, 24, and Us-hindu of Yt. VIII, 32, described in Bd. XII, 5, 6, as
two neighbouring mountains, for the pure water of Arêdvisûr falls from
the summit of Hûgar to Aûsind which stands in the circumambient ocean.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[160:4](sbe4730.htm#fr_500.md) The remainder of K
35, the MS. brought by Westergaard from Kirmân, is lost; but an old copy
of it (BK, see the Introduction) exists in Bombay, which supplies the
missing text, as an authority independent of T.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[160:5](sbe4730.htm#fr_501.md) See Bd. XIV, 26;
apparently the same as the Ari*z*, or Kar, the chief of fish, ibid.
XVIII, 3, 5; XXIV, 13.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[160:6](sbe4730.htm#fr_502.md) See Bd. XIV, 23;
XIX, 16; XXIV, 11.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[161:1](sbe4730.htm#fr_503.md) By Vohûmanô, as the
protector of useful animals.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[161:2](sbe4730.htm#fr_504.md) Possibly the
Te*g*end river, the Zend or Zôndak of Bd. XX, 7, 15.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[161:3](sbe4730.htm#fr_505.md) The Bahrâm, or
sacred fire at places of worship.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[161:4](sbe4730.htm#fr_507.md) Names not clearly
identified, and readings uncertain.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[161:5](sbe4730.htm#fr_508.md) In Âtû*r*-pâtakân,
and the Gû*s*nasp, fire was established upon it (see Bd. XII, 2, 26;
XVII, 7).

<span id="fn_504"></span>[161:6](sbe4730.htm#fr_509.md) Pahl. 'Satavês-t
Pâîrîg damânŏ ânŏ *k*îgûn.' Referring probably to Yt. VIII, 8, 9.
Satavês is the southern chieftain of the stars, as correctly stated in
the Iranian Bûndahi*s* (compare Bd. II, 7; XIII, 12); and the Pâîrîgs
are meteors.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[162:1](sbe4730.htm#fr_510.md) See § 9.

<span id="fn_506"></span>[162:2](sbe4730.htm#fr_511.md) Pahl. 'pavan
Dare*g*în zbâr' = Av. 'Dre*g*ya paiti zbarahi' of Vd. XIX, 4; a mythical
river in Aîrân-vê*g*, where Pôrûshaspô resided (Bd. XX, 32).

<span id="fn_507"></span>[162:3](sbe4730.htm#fr_512.md) The Pahlavi is
rather vague, but it is clear that Zaratû*s*t starts for his conference
at thirty years of age (Chap. XXI, 1), returns from it ten years later
(Chap. XXIII, I), and the conversion of Vi*s*tâsp occupies two years
longer (Chap. XXIII, 5), occurring when Zaratû*s*t was forty-two years
old and thirty-five years before his passing away at the age of
seventy-seven (Chap. XXIII, 9).

At this point another dislocation of text occurs in all existing <span
id="page_163">p. 163</span> MSS., owing to the accidental interpolation
of three loose folios of another text, between this chapter and the
next, in some unknown copy written before 1530. In the MSS. the text is
written continuously, without division into chapters. But the connection
of this chapter with the next one, which is here restored to its proper
position, is clearly shown by the reference to the 'ten years' of
conference, with which this chapter ends, and the next one begins. The
accidentally interpolated text is here classified as Chaps. XXIV and
XXV, but its real connections have not yet been traced.
