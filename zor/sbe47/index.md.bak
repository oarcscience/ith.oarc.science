This is part V of the Sacred Books of the East Pahlavi Texts
translation. It is the shortest one in the series, a slight 233 pp.,
about half of most other SBE volumes. SBE 47 contains translations of a
number of very late Zoroastrian texts, some prophetic in nature, others
providing clues to the chronology of the religion. As such, the texts
here, the Dinkard and Selections of Zad-Sparam, make interesting
reading. They will be of use both to scholars looking for information
about the development of Zoroastrianism, and those looking for
non-traditional books of prophecy. West concludes that the traditional
date of the birth of Zoroaster corresponds to 660 BCE; more recently,
628 BCE has been proposed, so the former date probably isn't so far off.
He also computes the [timetable of Zoroastrian
prophecy](sbe4702.htm#page_xxviii.md): don't get too excited, though, the
end of the world isn't until 2398, so we still have about four centuries
left.

PRODUCTION NOTES: This volume proved a tough job. As the title page
notes, I worked on it between 2002 and 2007, when my STML technology was
mature enough to allow me to finish it in a reasonable timeframe.
