### CHAPTER XIX.

1\. About his interfering talk (andarg-gôbi*s*nŏîh) with the iniquitous,
this also is declared, that one

day Dûrêsrôbô <span id="fr_459"></span>[1](#fn_455.md) the Karap, as *it
were* from the same five brethren, came out to the house of Pôrûshaspô;
*and* Pôrûshaspô placed a bowl (*g*amakŏ) of mare's milk before *him*,
and spoke to him thus: 'Consecrate *it*.'

2\. Zaratû*s*t expostulated with Pôrûshaspô thus: 'I *will* consecrate
it.' 3. Pôrûshaspô spoke thus: 'He should consecrate, and the grace is
to be offered up by you <span id="fr_460"></span>[2](#fn_456.md);' *and* as
many as three times *they* mutually disputed.

4\. Then up stood Zaratû*s*t, and his right foot struck at the bowl and
emptied it, and he spoke thus: 'I reverence righteousness, I reverence
the righteous *and* the poor, men *and* women; do thou, *O* Pôrûshaspô!
prepare a portion for him in whom *there* is worthiness.'

5\. And Dûrêsrôbô spoke unto Zaratû*s*t thus: 'As *some* of my portion
*of* daily *food was* first thrown away by thee, it is I who *will*
bring *it* on both thy lives, and *will* utterly destroy thee.' 6.
Zaratû*s*t spoke interruptingly <span id="fr_461"></span>[3](#fn_457.md)
thus: 'With complete mindfulness I *will* look upon thee with both eyes,
and *will* utterly destroy thee.'

7\. And, for a long time, they constantly looked, one at the other, with
unshrinking gaze; *but* the divine nature of Zaratû*s*t is victorious
over the witchcraft of that *wizard, and* Dûrêsrôbô is further
disturbed; he also asked for *his* horse *and* spoke thus: 'On account
of this *boy, it* is impossible for me to stay.'

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

8\. He sat upon the horse, *and* when he had gone a little *way*, he
fell off from the horse, through severe distress, and died; and the
children of his children's children have died upon the same spot <span
id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_458.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_455"></span>[150:1](sbe4727.htm#fr_459.md) So spelt in Zs.,
but Dûrâsrôbô in Dk.; also the former has always Pôrûshaspô, but the
latter Pôrûshâspô. Compare the same legend in Dk. VII, iii, 34-45.

<span id="fn_456"></span>[150:2](sbe4727.htm#fr_460.md) Pahl. 'val*â* aê
y*az*ê*d*ŏ, *a*fê*d* vâ*g* dahi*s*nŏ.'

<span id="fn_457"></span>[150:3](sbe4727.htm#fr_461.md) Or 'inwardly'

<span id="fn_458"></span>[151:1](sbe4727.htm#fr_462.md) Probably meaning
that he died childless.
