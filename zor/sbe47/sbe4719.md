### CHAPTER IV.

1\. About the selectness and perfection of the race of Irân, that is,
how the destroyer and the mingling of defects came into the creation,
first into the distribution of the race \[of mankind\] <span
id="fr_390"></span>[8](#fn_386.md) from the children of Sîyâmak <span
id="fr_391"></span>[9](#fn_387.md), *and* good intellect, good disposition,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

proper affection, proper praise, proper modesty, observance of hope,
liberality, truth, generosity, good friendship, *and* other capability,
glory, and proper duty are more particularly included for Fravâk <span
id="fr_392"></span>[1](#fn_388.md), and again altered for frontier peoples.

2\. Such-like goodness and glory, again, through selection from a
promiscuous origin—even till the coming on of various new
contaminations, from the demons, among the children of Fravâk—*were* for
Hâôshâng and Vâêgere*d* <span id="fr_393"></span>[2](#fn_389.md), as
Hâôshâng through superior glory *was* ruler of the world, and Vâêgere*d*
through provincial government (dahyûkânîh) became the cultivator and
cherisher of the world; and their well-destined descendants <span
id="fr_394"></span>[3](#fn_390.md) aggrandized the race of the monarchs
among the well-born provincial governors (dahyûkân).

3\. In union, such-like glory and goodness proceeded, mutually
connected, in various ages as settled by the annals (mâ*d*îgân), and the
frontiers of Atûr <span id="fr_395"></span>[4](#fn_391.md) are penetrated;
also in various annals *there* were in succession *such men* as
Tâkhmôrup, Yim, Frê*d*ûn the Âspîgân, and Aîrî*k* of Irân, the
progenitor of Mânû*s*, Mânû*s*-khvârnar, and Mânû*sk*îhar <span
id="fr_396"></span>[5](#fn_392.md).

4\. And, besides including this one, who *was* a monarch of superior
glory, and other monarchs *such* as *are* also in the same race <span
id="fr_397"></span>[6](#fn_393.md), the Kayâns <span
id="fr_398"></span>[7](#fn_394.md) *were*

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

chosen. 5. Even thus, as regards the Kayâns, the annals *have* always to
consider him who is monarch as the right *one*, who is a
fellow-descendant *of* the lineage, and in whom the glory is residing.

6\. The creator Aûha*r*ma*zd* has informed Nêryôsang <span
id="fr_399"></span>[1](#fn_395.md), his own reminder, *that* a similar
instance is the supreme Zaratû*s*tship, and the glory of the religion
due to the same; also many other reasons, which *are* recountable, *are*
declared in the Avesta, indications known only *to* an Irânian person of
the best lineage. 7. And this, too, he has said, namely: 'Great glory
and goodness of this description *are* appropriatable by the same race,
and *are* even now <span id="fr_400"></span>[2](#fn_396.md) visibly
manifest.'

8,. About what *are* the requirements of the tribe of those who call
*this* really their Gyêmarâ and how *they are* effected by our
acquaintance with revelation, that is, *by* much recitation of it; only,
several occasions (yâvar 1-*k*and) are necessary in these times. 9. Also
action and precaution *are* possible for them, and among the actions and
precautions *one* is to assume more especially law and custom, and
whatever *was* perverted by us and again made true; and, as to those
taught, several persons who *are* intellectual, seeking means, and
friends of the soul, *have* come to teach complete delusions to them;
also for the same tribe and whomever it is proper to teach, when it is
necessary for them, even a worldly

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

priestly authority is guiding for *that* same tribe, because he has
come <span id="fr_401"></span>[1](#fn_397.md).

<span id="fn_396"></span>[129:2](sbe4719.htm#fr_400.md) B has 'even anew,'
by writing kevan backwards, which converts the word into navak. From
Chap. I, 7 to this point, the compiler could have found very little of
his materials in a Jewish MS., excepting such as had been recently
obtained from Persian sources.

<span id="fn_397"></span>[130:1](sbe4719.htm#fr_401.md) It would seem that
the tribe professed a different religion, but one that bore some
resemblance to the Parsi faith in certain essential particulars. The
remaining five-sixths of Dk. V are devoted to a miscellaneous collection
of religious subjects, resembling a Rivâyat.
