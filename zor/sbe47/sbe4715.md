### CHAPTER XI.

1\. About the marvellousness which is after the end of the millennium of
Aûshê*d*ar-mâh and the arrival of the Triumphant Benefiter, until the
end of the fifty-seventh year of Sôshâns and the production of the
renovation among the existences.

2\. Concerning the marvellousness of Sôshâns as to splendour *and* glory
of person, it says that 'when the coming of the last rotation of those
rotations of the seasons of Aûshê*d*ar-mâh *occurs*, the man Sôshâns is
born <span id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_322) whose food is spiritual *and*
body sunny (that is, his body is as radiant as the sun);' also this,
that 'he looks on all sides with six-eyed power (6-dôîsarîh), *and* sees
the remedy for persecution by the fiend.'

3\. This, too, that with him is the triumphant Kayân glory 'which the
mighty Frê*d*ûn <span id="fr_327"></span>[2](#fn_323) bore when Az-4
Dahâk <span id="fr_328"></span>[3](#fn_324) *was* smitten by him; also
Kai-Khûsrôî <span id="fr_329"></span>[4](#fn_325) was bearing it when
the Tûr Frangrâsîyâk <span id="fr_330"></span>[5](#fn_326) *was* smitten
by him; also Frangrâsîyâk bore it when the Drvê Zênîgâk <span
id="fr_331"></span>[6](#fn_327) *was* smitten by him; *and*

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span>
Kai-Vi*s*tâsp <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_328) shall bear it when
you fully attract him to righteousness, *and* through it he shall carry
off the fiend *from* the concerns of the world of righteousness <span
id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_329).'

4\. And this, too, that in fifty-seven *of* his years *there* occur the
annihilation of the fiendishness of the two-legged race *and* others,
and the subjugation of disease and decrepitude, *of* death and
persecution, and *of* the original evil *of* tyranny, apostasy, and
depravity; *there* arise a perpetual verdant growth of vegetation *and*
the primitive gift of joyfulness; *and there* are seventeen years *of*
vegetable-eating, thirty years *of* water-drinking, *and* ten years of
spiritual food.

5\. And all the splendour, glory, and power, which *have* arisen in all
those possessing splendour, glory, *and* power, *are* in him on whom
they arrive together and for those who are his, when many inferior human
beings are aroused splendid *and* powerful; and through their power and
glory all the troops of the fiend are smitten. 6. And all mankind remain
of one accord in the religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, owing to the will of the
creator, the command *of* that *apostle*, and the resources of his
companions.

7\. At the end of the fifty-seven years the fiend *and* Aharman are
annihilated, the renovation *for* the future existence occurs, *and* the
whole of the good creation is provided with purity, *and* perfect

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

splendour. 8. *Just* as revelation states thus: 'When that millennium
has fully elapsed, which is the third of the religion of the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, that Ma*zd*a-worshipper whose name is so
Triumphant <span id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_330) then marches forward
from the water Kanyisâ <span id="fr_335"></span>[2](#fn_331) with a
thousand companions and also maidens *of* restrained disposition and
blindly-striving behaviour <span id="fr_336"></span>[3](#fn_332); and he
smites the wicked people who *are* tyrannical, and annihilates them.'

9\. Then those Ma*zd*a-worshippers smite, and none are smiting them. 0.
Then those Ma*zd*a-worshippers produce a longing for a renovation among
the existences, *one* ever-living, ever-beneficial, and ever desiring a
Lord. 11. 'Then I, who am Aûha*r*ma*zd*, produce the renovation
according to the longing among the existences, *one* ever-living,
ever-beneficial, *and ever* desiring a Lord.'

<span id="fn_322"></span>[116:1](sbe4715.htm#fr_326) The date here
indicated seems to be about twenty-eight years later than that intended
in Chap. X, 15-19.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[116:5](sbe4715.htm#fr_330) See Chap. I, 31,
39.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[116:6](sbe4715.htm#fr_331) Av. Drv*a*u
Zainigâu*s*, an Arab chieftain who invaded Irân <span id="page_117">p.
117</span> in early times and killed many with his evil eye, till the
Irânians invited Frangrâsîyâk to destroy him (see Darmesteter's French
translation of part of Chap. XLI of Irânian Bundahi*s* in Annales du
Musée Guimet, vol. xxii, p. 401).

<span id="fn_328"></span>[117:1](sbe4715.htm#fr_332) See Chap. I, 41.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[117:2](sbe4715.htm#fr_333) From a Pahlavi
version of Yt. XIX, 92, 93, with the second and third clauses
transposed.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[118:1](sbe4715.htm#fr_334) See Chap. X, 17.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[118:2](sbe4715.htm#fr_335) Reading the name as
Pâzand; if it were Pahlavi it would have to be read Kânmâsâî, because
Irânian Pâz. yi is very like Pahl. mâ. It is Kyânsih in Bd. XIII, 16;
XX, 34; XXI, 6, 7, and represents Av. Kãsava, the brackish lake or sea
of Sagastân.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[118:3](sbe4715.htm#fr_336) Reading
'va-bigar-*îk*-i vand khîm va-kûr-*k*akhŏ râs,' and assuming that bigar
is Ar. bikr, as an Arabic word is occasionally used in the Dînka*rd*
(see Chap. II, 2 n) though very rarely. Bd. XXX, 17, mentions 'fifteen
men and fifteen damsels' as assisting Sôshâns at the time of the
renovation of the universe.
