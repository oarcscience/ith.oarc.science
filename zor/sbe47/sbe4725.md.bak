### CHAPTER XVII.

1\. These were his tokens at birth:—One day, one of those five brothers
of the Karaps saw Zaratû*s*t, and he looked a long while upwards,
downwards, *and* on all sides around <span

2\. Pôrûshaspô enquired thus: 'What *was* there when thou lookedst
upwards, what when *thou lookedst* downwards, *and* what when thou
lookedst on all sides?'

3\. And he replied thus, namely: 'When I looked upwards, it *was* for
this reason, when I saw that our souls <span
id="fr_456"></span>[3](#fn_452.md) *that* go up to the sky, *will* go up to
the best

*existence* <span id="fr_457"></span>[1](sbe4726.htm#fn_453.md), owing to
the words of this soul. of mankind. 4. When I looked downwards, I saw
that, owing to the action of this *one*, the demon and fiend, the wizard
and witch become buried below the earth, *and* fall paralyzed back to
hell. 5. And when I looked on all sides, I saw that the words of this
*one will* extend through the whole earth; and when *they have* become
as the law of the seven regions, each person is kept clothed *with* a
robe (kapâh) of seven skins, in which the glory of the seven archangels
*has* arisen.'

6\. And Brâ*d*-rûkhsh the Tûr went forth; when he went to the right side
(arakŏ), Zaratû*s*t hastened away to the left, and when he went to the
left side, Zaratû*s*t hastened to the right, and he is thereby concealed
from Brâ*d*-rûkhsh the Tûr, *who* has not met with him.

<span id="fn_452"></span>[147:3](sbe4725.htm#fr_456.md) Assuming that the
MS. Ladd, 'glory, or destiny,' has lost an initial n, with which it was
originally nism*â* = Chald. ‏נִשְׁמָא‎ 'the soul;' as the copyists have
not been aware of the existence of this Zvâri*s* equivalent for rûbân,
'the soul,' for some centuries, it has been altered into gad*â*, by the
omission of its first letter, in nearly all but the very oldest existing
MSS., such as Kao and M6 in Bd. XV, 3-5, and even there the medial m is
really missing, though apparently existing in the final *â*; the
irregularity of using s for sh is common in Pahlavi.
