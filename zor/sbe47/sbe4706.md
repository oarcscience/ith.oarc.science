### CHAPTER II.

1\. About the marvellousness of the manifestations before <span
id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_65.md) the birth of that most auspicious of
offsprings from *his* mother <span id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_66.md).

2\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that the creator passed on
that glory of Zaratû*s*t through the material existences of the
creatures <span id="fr_67"></span>[3](#fn_67.md) to Zaratû*s*t; when the
command arose from Aûha*r*ma*zd*, the coming of that glory from the
spiritual *existence* to the worldly, and *to* the material substance
(mâ*d*îyâtŏ) of Zaratû*s*t, is manifested *as* a great wonder to the
multitude (va*l* kabedânŏ). 3. *Just* as revelation mentions *it* thus:
'Thereupon, when Aûha*r*ma*zd* had produced the material (dahi*s*nŏ) of
Zaratû*s*t, the glory then, in the

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

presence of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, fled on *towards* the material of Zaratû*s*t,
on to that germ; from that germ it fled on, on *to the light which is
endless* <span id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_68.md); from the light which is
endless <span id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_69.md) it fled on, on to that of
the sun; from that of the sun it fled on, on *to* the moon; from that
moon it fled on, on to those stars; from those stars it fled on, on to
the fire which *was* in the house of Zôî*s* <span
id="fr_70"></span>[3](#fn_70.md); *and* from that fire it fled on, on to
the wife of Frâhîmrva*n*ã-zôi*s* <span id="fr_71"></span>[4](#fn_71.md),
when she brought forth that girl who became the mother of Zaratû*s*t.'

4\. Of that splendour, escaped at the same time into the earth *and*
into the sky, the father-in-law's ignorance is declared, so that it is
said by those in the village of the more instructed and invoking
Zôî*s* <span id="fr_72"></span>[5](#fn_72.md), as to the self-combustion
*which* burns the fire, that fuel is not necessary for its use. 5. Then
they went on to the governor (kê*d*ŏ), and he explained *to* them
concerning that same (that is, he spoke to them) thus: 'The full glory
of embodied existence

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

is the glory of life *apart* from the body, so that all diligence devoid
of this is only movement.'

6\. And *it is* declared that the demons, on account of their defeat by
that glory in maintaining <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md) adversity
for the girl, *were* bringing on to that district three armaments
(hênô), winter, the demon of pestilence, and oppressive enemies; and *a
suspicion was* cast by them into the minds of those of the district,
that this harm happened to the district owing to the witchcraft of this
girl; so that those of the district quarreled dreadfully with the
parents, as to the witchcraft of antagonism *in* the girl, and about
putting *her* out from that district.

7\. And the father of that girl spoke even these *words* to those of the
district, with much reason, about the unjust assertion of witchcraft
relative to the girl, that is: 'When this girl *was* brought forth among
those of mine, her whole destiny (vakhsh) was afterwards set forth *by*
that manifest radiance of fire, where it brought out radiance from all
over her in the dark night. 8. When this girl sits in the interior of
the house, wherein there is no fire, *and* in the chamber (sarâî) of
fire they increase *its* intensity (bûr*z*ŏ), it is lighter there, where
*and* when this girl sits, than there where they increase the intensity
of the fire; *one* is dazzled by the radiance from her body, *and* that
of a wizard *would* not *have* been so glorious.'

9\. Even then, owing to the influence (sârîni*s*nŏ) of the demons, and
the Kavîg and Karap <span id="fr_74"></span>[2](#fn_74.md) of the

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

district, they did not become satisfied; *so* the father ordered the
girl to go to Pa*d*îragtarâspô <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md), the
father of a family in the country (matâ) of the Spîtâmas, in the
district (rû*d*astâk) of Alâk; and the girl obeyed the command of *her*
father. 10. That disturbance which the demons caused, with evil
intention, for the expatriation of that girl, the sacred beings
assiduously made the reason for the coming of the girl for marriage to
Pôrûshâspô, the father of Zaratû*s*t, through *her* father sending the
girl to the dwelling of Pa*d*îragtarâspô, the father of Pôrûshâspô.

11\. One *marvel* <span id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76.md) is this which is
declared, that when that girl, in going to that family, stood on the
loftiest place in the country of the Spîtâmas, and *it* is surveyed by
her, a great wonder is manifested to the girl, *just* as revelation
mentions: 'It is their <span id="fr_77"></span>[3](#fn_77.md)

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

voice is carried away to her from them; "do thou proceed to that village
which is theirs; it is very depressed in height and very wide in
breadth, in which he who is living and the cattle mostly walk together;
besides, for thy assistance that village is divinely fashioned *and*
compassionate."' 12. Thereupon that damsel stopped, and also fully
observed that *their* recital seems *to be* for the conveyance of this
statement, that my action *should be* such as *was* ordered me *by* my
father also. 13. Then that damsel thoroughly washed *her* hands, and
proceeded from them to that village which was Pa*d*îragtarâspô's, and
the glory came to Pôrûshâspô, the son of Pa*d*îragtarâspô.

14\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that the creator
Aûha*r*ma*zd* passed on the guardian spirit (fravâhar) of Zaratû*s*t, to
the parents of Zaratû*s*t, through (le-*k*adôn) Hôm <span
id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md), by a marvel produced by cultivation. 15.
Again, too, revelation says that, when the separation (burînŏ) of the
third millennium occurred, at the end of the 3,000 years of spiritual
existence without a destroyer, (after the creatures *were* in spiritual
existence, *and* before the arrival of the fiend); then the archangels
framed Zaratû*s*t together, *and* they seated the guardian spirit
within, having a mouth, having a tongue, and the proclaimer *of* the
celestial mansions.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

16\. Then the three millenniums of Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) *were* the number manifest to them through
observation by the eye, *and* it seemed that he became just like an
archangel through bodily contact with (hamkerpîh) <span
id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_80.md) the archangels. 17. And when the
separation of the third millennium occurred, after the framing of
Zaratû*s*t together, and before the conveying of Zaratû*s*t down to the
worldly *state*, at the end of the 3,000 years *of* worldly existence
with a destroyer, then Aûha*r*ma*zd* argued with Vohûmanô *and*
Ashavahi*s*tô <span id="fr_81"></span>[3](#fn_81.md) thus: 'Is his mother
beheld by you, so that we may produce Zaratû*s*t?'

18\. And Ashavahi*s*tô spoke *in* reply thus: 'Thou art aware even of
that, O propitious *one!* about the Zaratû*s*t we *shall* produce, *and*
thou and we have produced, thou knowest, O Aûha*r*ma*zd*! *and to us*
who are the other archangels do thou announce the place, because its
appearance thou knowest, *thou* propitious spirit Aûha*r*ma*zd*!'

19\. Then Aûha*r*ma*zd* argued with Vohûmanô and the reminding by
A*rd*avahi*s*tô <span id="fr_82"></span>[4](#fn_82.md), Shatraver,
Spenda*r*ma*d*, Khû*r*da*d*, *and* Amû*r*da*d* <span
id="fr_83"></span>[5](#fn_83.md), *saying:*

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'The conveying of
Zaratû*s*t down does not seem *to be for* me, because, having a mouth
*and* having a tongue, *he will be* a proclaimer to the world of
embodied beings. 20. If we convey Zaratû*s*t down on to the world of
embodied beings, having a mouth *and* having a tongue, *as* a proclaimer
*of* the celestial mansion, this is evident: they *will* say, concerning
the origin *of* him who is my righteous man, *that* we frame him
together with the water, with the land, with the plants, *and* with the
animals <span id="fr_84"></span>[1](#fn_84.md). 21. Therefore we *will*
carry off there, to the village of Pôrûshâspô, him whom they *will* call
Zaratû*s*t of good lineage of both natures, both *of* Nêryôsang <span
id="fr_85"></span>[2](#fn_85.md) who is of the archangels, and *of* Yim who
is of mankind.'

22\. Then the archangels framed together a stem of Hôm the height of a
man, excellent in colour, *and* juicy where fresh; also to carry off the
guardian spirit of Zaratû*s*t to that stem of theirs, the archangels
made it go forth thither from that endless light, and gave it up there
also to the instinctive intellect (âsnô vîr). 23. Likewise their
carrying off *was* manifest around, and a wall *was* openly displayed
round them, but a restless one; the Hôm *was* constantly provided with a
mouth, where it was suitable, *and* sap constantly oozed from the Hôm
where it was moist.

24\. And when thirty <span id="fr_86"></span>[3](#fn_86.md) years of the
3,000 years of

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

well-disturbed <span id="fr_87"></span>[1](#fn_87.md) worldly existence
remained, Vohûmanô and Ashavahi*s*tô then associated their pre-eminence
together, *and* turned off into the embodied existence; there they came
up to where two birds had settled in quest of progeny, *and* seven years
before the serpents devoured the inexperienced progeny. 25. For their
*own* designs, Vohûmanô *and* Ashavahi*s*tô went on, and those birds
consulted *them* thus: 'We have to offer homage, and our want is that
Hôm.'

26\. The circumstances of those associated together in pre-eminence and
the request of these *for* that Hôm *were* a double marvel; Vohûmanô
seized one of those *birds* by both legs, and the other *by* one; he
also brought them that Hôm, and gave it up to them there, on that tree
within *their* nest. 27. And they uncovered above the serpents, that
have gone up to the progeny of the birds; then that guardian spirit of
Zaratû*s*t started up, and the serpents on the tree rushed also from
them away towards the demons; *but* that guardian spirit of Zaratû*s*t
smote them on the jaws, *and* the serpents fell down *and* expired,
which *events* have also occurred among them till now, *having* been
requisite as regards a depriver of life (*g*ân-gîr) and *any* one of
that species. 28. And that Hôm *was* connected with that tree; and on
the summit of that tree, there

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

where the nest of the birds was, it grew constantly fresh and
golden-coloured <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88.md).

29\. After the coming of her who bore Zaratû*s*t, to Pôrûshâspô for
marriage, Vohûmanô *and* A*rd*avahi*s*tô, thus associated together in
their pre-eminence, came up there to Pôrûshâspô in the cattle-pasture of
the Spîtâmas, and their thoughts *were* confined to that Hôm brought by
them. 30. Then Pôrûshâspô walked forth, with spiritual desire, up to the
water of the Dâît <span id="fr_89"></span>[2](#fn_89.md), because the
requirement of the spirits is the spiritual knowledge <span
id="fr_90"></span>[3](#fn_90.md) that spirits are ever-beneficial; and that
Hôm *was* also seen by him, when it had grown on that tree, on the
inside of the nest. 31. Then Pôrûshâspô thought thus: 'It is for me,
really (madam-*îk*-am) to proceed and, even as *there* is no reaching by
me up to that Hôm, that tree must be cut down, for apart from that, *O*
Hôm of Aûha*r*ma*zd*! thou seemest fresh, so that the benefit of
something from thee *will be* advantageous.'

32\. Then Pôrûshâspô walked on and washed their clothes acquiescently
(patâsîg), and here a great wonder was manifest to Pôrûshâspô. 33. About
this it says that, all the while that Pôrûshâspô washed their clothes,
Vohûmanô then proceeded from the uppermost third of the tree unto the
middle of it, whereon *it was* the desire of Pôrûshâspô

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

to be conveyed. 34. Then Pôrûshâspô, *having* washed the clothes, walked
up to it and, thereupon gathering up the whole of that *Hôm*, all of it
*was* then also appropriated by him through assistance like that of that
*archangel, just* as what thou offerest for the food-sustenance of a
friend's son of two years *or* three years *of age;* and it seemed to
him that *archangel's* joyful payment.

35\. Carrying off their Hôm, Pôrûshâspô spoke of it to *his* noble (mas)
wife thus: 'So thou, *O* Dûk*d*âûb! shouldst keep their Hôm in custody,
all the while that their Hôm fulfils duty and routine.'

36\. One *marvel* is this *which is* declared, that the coming of the
nature (gôhar) of the body of Zaratû*s*t, through water *and*
vegetation, to the bodies of *his* parents, is manifested *as* a great
wonder of the creator to the multitude. 37. As revelation mentions *it
thus:* 'Thereupon, when Aûha*r*ma*zd* had produced the material
(dahi*s*nŏ) of Zaratû*s*t <span id="fr_91"></span>[1](#fn_91.md), the
nature of *his* body then, in the presence of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, fled on
*towards* the material of Zaratû*s*t.'

38\. About Khû*r*da*d* and Mû*r*da*d* <span
id="fr_92"></span>[2](#fn_92.md) bringing the cloud-water down in a
compassionate manner ever anew, drop by drop, *and* completely warm, for
the delight of sheep and men, *and—with* as much seed as the roving of
two rampant bulls *would* thereby *cast* upon the plants *which* have
grown, all of every species—*they are* casting *it* upon those other
plants at that time, even upon the dry *ones*; and the

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

nature of Zaratû*s*t came from that water to those plants.

39\. One *marvel* is this *which is* declared, that, in order that the
nature of Zaratû*s*t shall come unto *his* parents, after <span
id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) the mounting of the archangels Pôrûshâspô
drives six white cows, with yellow ears, up to those plants. 40. And
here is manifested a great wonder, *such* as revelation mentions thus:
Two <span id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md) of those cows, unimpregnated,
*had* become full of milk, and the nature of Zaratû*s*t came from the
plants to those cows, and is mingled with the cows' milk; it is owing
thereto *that* Pôrûshâspô drove those cows back. 41. And Pôrûshâspô
spoke to Dûk*d*âûb thus: '*O* Dûk*d*âûb! in two of those cows, *which
are* unimpregnated *and have* not calved, milk *has* appeared; do thou
milk those cows, which are the splendour *and* glory of the cows *and
of* any embodied existence whatever.' 42. And Dûk*d*âûb arose and,
taking that pail of hers which had a four-fold capacity, she also milked
from them the milk which *was* in them, and a great *part* of what they
gave up to her she had to throw away; and the nature of Zaratû*s*t was
in that milk.

43\. One *marvel* is this which is manifested in the struggle of the
adversary for concealing and spoiling that milk, *just* as revelation
mentions thus: Thereupon, at that time, the demons formed *themselves*
into an assembly, and the demon of demons growled thus: 'You demons
become quite unobservant: that food is really supplied fresh, so that
the formation is settled which *will* extend as far as to that

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

man who *will be* the righteous Zaratû*s*t; which of you *will*
undertake his destruction, all the while that he exists for mankind, so
as to make *him* more contemptibly impotent?' 44. *K*êshmak <span
id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md), astute in evil, growled thus: 'I *will*
undertake his destruction.' 45. Astute in evil, he rushed away with
thrice fifty *of* the demons who are Karaps of *K*êshmak; and that
village *was* partly uprooted and partly destroyed <span
id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_96.md) by him, fellow-workers *were* ruined, and
the number of fellow-eaters of broken victuals, attending the great,
*was* not broken up, among whom was he that had repelled his authority.

46\. *It is* declared that, afterwards, Pôrûshâspô asked again *for*
that Hôm from Dûk*d*âûb, and he pounded it, and with that cows'
milk <span id="fr_97"></span>[3](#fn_97.md), into which the nature of the
body of Zaratû*s*t had come, he here mingled the guardian spirit of
Zaratû*s*t, and the nature of the body came at once into union with it.

47\. One *marvel* is this *which is* declared, that Pôrûshâspô *and*
Dûk*d*âûb drank up that Hôm and milk, when they were mingled together
and announced to Aûha*r*ma*zd*; and here occurred a combination of the
glory, guardian spirit, and bodily nature of Zaratû*s*t into a
man*child*. 48. And a great wonder is manifested to both of them,
through that which revelation mentions thus: Thereupon, both have
embraced the first *time* <span id="fr_98"></span>[4](#fn_98.md) with
desire

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

for a son, *and* the demons shouted out unto them, in the villainous
speech *of* sinfulness, thus: 'Why shouldst thou act like this,
vile <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99.md) Pôrûshâspô?' whereupon they
started up like people who *are* ashamed. 49. A second *time* they have
embraced, and the demons shouted out unto them, in villainous speech;
whereupon they started up like people who *are* ashamed. 50. A third
*time* they have embraced thus, with desire for a son; and the demons
shouted out unto them, in villainous speech; whereupon they started up
like people who *are* ashamed. 51. And they spoke with one another about
*it, and* continued at this duty, and accomplished it <span
id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_100.md), *saying*: 'We will not so stop without
accomplishing something, not *even* though both Râk and Nô*d*ar *should*
arrive here together <span id="fr_101"></span>[3](#fn_101.md).' 52. Then
that man*child* who *was* the righteous Zaratû*s*t became complete, and
here *below there* came together the nature of the body, the guardian
spirit, and the glory of Zaratû*s*t in the womb *of his* mother.

53\. One *marvel* is this which is declared, that, after the combination
of Zaratû*s*t in the womb *of his* mother, the demons strove anew
wonderfully

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

to cause the death of Zaratû*s*t in *his* mother's womb, and she who
bore him *was* rendered sickly by them through the sharpest of sharp and
afflictive pain, until she wished to ask the wizard physicians for a
desirable remedy. 54. And here is manifested a great wonder, just as
revelation says: 'It is then a voice of theirs is carried away there to
her from the higher region, from Aûha*r*ma*zd* and from the archangels,
thus: "Thou damsel who goest! do not proceed thither, because anything
*of* theirs is destruction through wizard medical treatment; *for*
healthfulness wash *thy* hands thoroughly, *and* those hands shall take
firewood, and upon it thou shalt offer meat for the sake of the infant,
thou shalt offer up cows' butter *to* the fire for his sake; thou shalt
likewise heat *it* at the fire for his sake, and shalt quaff (pâîmês)
*it* off at the *proper* time for his sake, and thou *wilt* become
well."' 55. Then at once that damsel washed *her* hands thoroughly, and
she did just as *she had* heard, and became well <span
id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md).

56\. One *marvel* is this which is manifested to the multitude when
three days remained to his coming <span id="fr_103"></span>[2](#fn_103.md)
*forth*; in the manner of the sun, at the approach of *its* uprising,
when its first advancing twilight is diffused, *his* body is then
announced as revelation says: 'It is then when in those last three
nights during which Zaratû*s*t was in the womb, where he still subsisted
three days till afterwards born, *that* the village of Pôrûshâspô became
all luminous. 57. Then spoke the horse-owners and cattle-owners of the
Spîtâmas, in running away, thus: "It is requisite *to be* forgiven <span
id="fr_104"></span>[3](#fn_104.md); the village of Pôrûshâspô, on which

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

that fire <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md) is in every crevice, is
disturbed by confusion <span id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_106.md)." 58. Then,
on running together again, they said: "It is not fully forgiven for the
village of Pôrûshâspô; fire is on it in every crevice *and* it is
disturbed by confusion; unto him is born, at his house, a brilliant
man*child*."'

59\. This, too, is one of the wonders, when the report of the
marvellousness of the birth *of* that man*child* *and of his* great
glory, is due to statements of Yim and also others, brilliant in
carrying on the destiny which had entered them from the sacred beings.
60. Wherein Yim spoke to the demons thus: 'Here *below* the pure *and*
righteous Zaratû*s*t *will* be born, who *will* produce for you who are
demons that absence of intercession which is prepared for you (that is,
he *will* produce for you a thoroughly-harassed actual inactivity, an
absence of intercession so that you are not able to pray on your own
account, *and* no one prays for you).'

61\. *It is* declared that the report about the birth of Zaratû*s*t, and
concerning his prophesying, is explained (avazandî-hastŏ) only by the
illustrious, *such* as Yim and Frê*d*ûn *and* many learned people; but
the sacred beings are also heard through the tongues of the animals
scattered in the world, in order that even that witness shall arise as
regards his prophesying. 62. *Just* like that which is declared, that in
the reign of Kaî-Ûs *there* was an ox, and a splendour had come to his
body from the sacred beings; and whenever a dispute as to the frontier
arose between Irân and Tûrân, that ox *was* brought, and the boundary
between Irân and Tûrân

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

*was* truly shown by him. 63. And because, when an Irânian *had* to seek
a decision as to a Tûrânian in a dispute *and* lies occurred, the
Tûrânians were constantly convicted through the showing of the boundary
*by* the ox, and happened to be defeated by the Irânians—*and*, besides
that, their envy also *arose* as to Kaî-Ûs, even of *his*
ownership—therefore, on account of *his* possession of that wonder, the
Tûrânians proceeded about the smiting and destruction of that ox, and
through their sorcery and witchcraft the mind of Kaî-Ûs *was* disturbed
about that ox, and he went to a warrior, *whose* name *was* Srîtô <span
id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_107.md), *and* ordered him to kill that ox; *so*
that man came to smite the ox. 64. And here is manifested a wonder of
importance by that ox, *such* as revelation mentions thus: 'To him spoke
the ox, in grave words, thus: "Thou shouldst not murder me, *O* Sritô!
thou seventh <span id="fr_108"></span>[2](#fn_108.md) of those of this
race; you *will* atone *for this* malice when Zaratû*s*t, the most
desirous of righteousness among the existences, arrives and proclaims
thy bad action in revelation; and the distress in thy soul becomes such
as is declared by that passage where *it says:* 'As death occurs to him,
that of Va*d*ak <span id="fr_109"></span>[3](#fn_109.md) and the like
occurs.'"' 65. *It* is declared that that man, when this wonder *was*
thus seen by him *proceeding* from the ox, did not kill *it*, but went
back to Kaî-Ûs *and* told *him* what he *had* seen. 66. Kaî-Ûs then
still, on account of the amazing deceitfulness of the demons and
wizards, ordered the same man to smite that ox

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

and that man proceeded also again to the ox, *and* though *it was*
carrying *on* still much *of* that talk, he did not lend an ear to *it,
but* killed *it*.

67\. Regarding the sole-created ox <span
id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md), too, *it* is declared that, *on*
meeting its destruction by the evil spirit, it bellowed thus: 'Though
thou thinkest it as to us, *O* evil spirit, astute in evil! that thou
art *in* every way a winner by destruction, *it is* not to our
destruction thou art even then an attainer *in* every way (that is, *it*
is not possible for thee so to annihilate that we *shall* not arise
again); even now I proclaim that that man, Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas,
*will* arrive in that last revolution, who *will* produce distress for
the demons, the assistants of the demon, and also the wicked who are
bipeds.'

68\. Likewise the marvellousness of Zaratû*s*t's defeat of the demons,
owing to his glory and by means of his sagacity, even before he had come
into the world by birth; when Frâsîy*âv*  <span
id="fr_111"></span>[2](#fn_111.md) the wizard is amazingly distressed
through seeking that glory of his by desire of the demons, just as
revelation <span id="fr_112"></span>[3](#fn_112.md) mentions thus:
'Thereupon Frâsîy*âv*, the very powerful Tûrânian, rushed away, *O*
Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas! to the wide-formed ocean a first, a second,
and a third time; and he wished to obtain that glory which is specially
for those *of* the countries of Irân, *for* the born and the unborn, and
which is *for* the righteous *one; but* he did not attain to that
glory.'

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 69. And this, too,
*is mentioned*, that to all the seven regions the villain Frangrâsîyâk
rushed away, and the glory of Zaratû*s*t *was* sought by him <span
id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md).

70\. Here is an enumeration *of* the worthy lineage of Zaratû*s*t <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md):—Zaratû*s*t *was son* of Pôrûshâspô,

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_65"></span>[17:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_65.md) The MS. has pata*s*
for pê*s*.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[17:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_66.md) The contents of this
chapter are thus mentioned in the summary of the Spend Nask (Dk. VIII,
xiv, 1 in S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, p. 31):—'The Spend *contains* particulars
about the origin *and* combination of the material *existence*, guardian
spirit, *and* soul (or glory) of Zaratû*s*t; how the creation of each
one *occurred* in the spiritual *existence*, and *in* what mode *it was*
produced for the worldly *existence*; how their connection with the
parents *arose*, the coming of the parents together, the combination in
the mother, and the birth from the mother; *and* whatever is on the same
subject.'

<span id="fn_67"></span>[17:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_67.md) The writer uses two
Arabic words: 'mâ*d*îyâtŏ-i ‘*h*alqŏ.'

<span id="fn_68"></span>[18:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_68.md) Perplexed by the
repetitions, some copyist has evidently omitted this phrase by mistake.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[18:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_69.md) Pahl. anagar, a
transcript of Av. anaghra which is always translated by Pahl. asar,
'endless.' The 'endless light' is the abode of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, see Bd. I,
2.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[18:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_70.md) Written in Pâzand.

<span id="fn_71"></span>[18:4](sbe4706.htm#fr_71.md) Also written in
Pâzand. In Bd. XXXII, 10, it is stated that 'the name of the father of
the mother of Zaratû*s*t was Frahimravâ' (or Fereâhimruvânâ in the
Irânian version); but very little reliance can be placed on such Pâzand
readings of names originally written in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[18:5](sbe4706.htm#fr_72.md) Here written in
Pahlavi letters which can also be read Zandîh. In the text, the two
preceding adjectives, farhakhtar va-khvân, might be read Farâkht-ruvânân
as the beginning of the name. But, as it stands, the text implies that
Zôî*s*, the father-in-law of his son Frâhim-rva*n*ã's wife, was the
master of the house, which is the usual oriental arrangement.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[19:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_73.md) Reading dârîh, but it
may be gârîh for kârîh, 'producing.'

<span id="fn_74"></span>[19:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_74.md) The Karaps were
apparently idolatrous priests, especially those before the conversion of
Vi*s*tâsp by Zaratû*s*t; one being called 'a wizard' in Chap. III, 5,
42-44, another 'unsanctified' in IV, 24, <span id="page_20">p. 20</span>
a third is 'deadly' in IV, 67, and a demon himself is a Karap in IV, 61,
and has Karaps under his control in II, 45. The following Karaps are
named in the time of Zaratû*s*t:—Dûrâsrôbô mentioned in Chap. III, 4-41;
Brâ*d*rôk-rêsh in III, 20-34, who is called a Tûrânian in III, 28;
Vaêdvôi*s*t in IV, 21-24; and Zâk in IV, 67. Some others are named by
other writers. The Kavîgs, Kaîs, or Kîgs are mentioned with the Karaps
in Chaps. II, 9; III, 50; IV, 2, 6, 14, 64, 67; VIII, 26, 40, as equally
objectionable, but their avocation as officials is not defined. Both
classes seem to have held official rank, but whether their titles were
tribal or official is uncertain. The Avesta calls them Karapan and Kavi;
the latter word being also the royal title of the Kayân dynasty, of
which Vi*s*tâsp was a member. Compare Zs. XV, 1-4; XXIII, 8.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[20:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_75.md) So also in §§ 13, 70.
In Bd. XXXII, 1, 2, the two old MSS. of the Irânian Bundahi*s* have
Padtarâsp thrice and Pîrtarâsp once; K 20 has Spîtarsp and Paitiresp; K
20 b has Padirtarâspô and Paitirispô; and M6 has Padirtarâsp and
Paitiresp. Zs. XIII, 6, has Purtarâspô.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[20:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_76.md) One of the marvellous
manifestations mentioned in § 1.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[20:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_77.md) Probably we should
read: 'It is the voice of those sacred beings' who are mentioned in §
10. As the word ya*zd*ân, 'sacred beings,' is exactly similar, in
Pahlavi, to shân (in val*â*shân, 'their' <span id="page_21">p. 21</span>
or 'those'), a copyist would be liable to the blunder of leaving out the
final word in writing val*â*shân ya*zd*ân. Or the original writer
himself may not have quoted enough of the text he was reading, to make
his meaning clear.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[21:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_78.md) A sacred and mythical
tree, described in Bd. XVIII, 1-3. and often personified as a sacred
being. It is now represented, in Parsi ceremonies, by twigs of a
particular plant brought from Persia.

<span id="fn_79"></span>[22:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_79.md) Meaning the period of
Zaratû*s*t's existence merely as a guardian spirit, the first period of
the destroyer (§ 17) who then remained powerless in confusion (see Bd.
I, 22).

<span id="fn_80"></span>[22:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_80.md) Or 'sheltering with'
(ham-kar*îk*îh).

<span id="fn_81"></span>[22:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_81.md) The personifications
of the Avesta phrases for 'good thought' and 'perfect rectitude,' who
are two of the seven that hold a superior position among sacred beings,
somewhat similar to that of archangels. When a Parsi speaks of
Aûha*r*ma*zd* as the first of the Ameshaspends, or archangels, he does
not put him on an equality with the rest, any more than we put a
commander-in-chief on an equality with his troops when we call him a
good soldier.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[22:4](sbe4706.htm#fr_82.md) Another pronunciation
of Ashavahi*s*tô.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[22:5](sbe4706.htm#fr_83.md) These last four
archangels are personifications of the Avesta <span id="page_23">p.
23</span> phrases for 'desirable dominion, bountiful devotion,
completeness or health, and immortality.'

<span id="fn_84"></span>[23:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_84.md) That is, as an
inferior and irresponsible being.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[23:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_85.md) Here spelt Nêrôsang;
see Chaps. I, 29; II, 70; and Zs. XIII, 6, for this angel's influence on
the royal race.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[23:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_86.md) The MS. has 330 years,
but the time intended is evidently that shortly before the birth of
Zaratû*s*t, and this third 3,000 years. <span id="page_24">p. 24</span>
ended either when Vi*s*tâspô accepted the religion, in Zaratû*s*t's
forty-second year, or when Zaratû*s*t received the religion in his
thirtieth year, but this earlier date is the more likely.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[24:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_87.md) This word,
hû-aîbi*g*adîg, is written in Pahlavi precisely like an-aîbi*g*adîg,
'without a destroyer,' though its meaning is the reverse, which is an
unexpected cause of perplexity to a cursory reader.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[25:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_88.md) Or it may be
'verdant.'

<span id="fn_89"></span>[25:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_89.md) Av. Dâitya, a mythic
river in Aîrân-vê*g* (Bd. XX, 13); a favourite place for religious
rites, see Yt. V, 17, 104, 112; IX, 25, 29; XVII, 45, 49, 61. Or it may
be merely mayâ-î shê*d*, 'brilliant water.'

<span id="fn_90"></span>[25:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_90.md) Reading
maînôg-dânisnîh, but the MS. has maînôg dênô-dânîh which might be
translated 'spiritual knowledge of religion,' though the latter Pahlavi
word is unusual.

<span id="fn_91"></span>[26:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_91.md) Compare § 3.

<span id="fn_92"></span>[26:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_92.md) These two archangels
have special charge of water and vegetation (see Sls. XV, 25-29), and
here they are represented as acting in a manner usually ascribed to
Ti*s*tar, the Dog-star.

<span id="fn_93"></span>[27:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_93.md) Reading akha*r*
instead of adên, 'then.'

<span id="fn_94"></span>[27:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_94.md) In some places the
singular number is used, in others the plural.

<span id="fn_95"></span>[28:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_95.md) The whirlwind demon;
see Bd. XXVIII, 24. Compare Chap. IV, 61.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[28:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_96.md) The usual effects of a
hurricane.

<span id="fn_97"></span>[28:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_97.md) The mingling of milk
with pounded Hôm still constitutes part of the Parsi ceremonial; see
Haug's Essays, 3rd ed., p. 405.

<span id="fn_98"></span>[28:4](sbe4706.htm#fr_98.md) Pahl. 'ko*l*â 2 lâlâ
fratûm vapdî*d*ŏ hav*â*nd.'

<span id="fn_99"></span>[29:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_99.md) Reading anâg, but it
may be intended for hanâ = aê, 'O.'

<span id="fn_100"></span>[29:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_100.md) Pahl. '*a*fshân
madam hâr s*u*ftŏ, aêghshânŏ pavan akôsh fr*â*z va*b*îdûntô.'

<span id="fn_101"></span>[29:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_101.md) Evidently an old
proverb, implying a fixed determination whatever catastrophe may happen,
even if one's ancestors of the eleventh or twelfth generation shall
appear. Nô*d*ar (Av. Naotara) was a son of King Mânû*sk*îhar (Bd. XXXI,
13, 23), and Râk was a nephew of Nô*d*ar (Bd. XXXI, 31), doubtless the
same as Ra*g*an (Bd. XXXII, 1; XXXIII, 3) which seems to be a Pâzand
misreading of Aîri*k*ŏ, or Êri*k*ŏ, see Zs. XVI, 11-13, and compare the
genealogies in Chap. II, 70 and Zs. XIII, 6. The proverb is used again
in Chap. III, 19, and the names are mentioned in III, 39.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[30:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_102.md) Compare Zs. XIV,
2-5.

<span id="fn_103"></span>[30:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_103.md) Literally 'going.'

<span id="fn_104"></span>[30:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_104.md) Apparently an appeal
for mercy.

<span id="fn_105"></span>[31:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_105.md) Assuming that nîram
stands for nîr*â*, a variant of nûrâ.

<span id="fn_106"></span>[31:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_106.md) Or 'terrified with
fear.'

<span id="fn_107"></span>[32:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_107.md) This legend is also
told, with further details, in Zs. XII, 7-25.

<span id="fn_108"></span>[32:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_108.md) Compare Zs. XII, 10.

<span id="fn_109"></span>[32:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_109.md) The mother of Dahâk,
who first committed adultery in an aggravated form (see Dd. LXXII, 5;
LXXVIII, 2).

<span id="fn_110"></span>[33:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_110.md) Pahl. tô*r*â-î
aêvak-dâ*d*ŏ, the primeval ox, from whom the animals and plants have all
descended (see Bd. III, 14, 17, 18; IV. 1-5; X, 1; XIV, 1-3; XXVII, 2).

<span id="fn_111"></span>[33:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_111.md) The same person as
Frangrâsîyâk of Chaps. I, 31, 39; II, 69; XI, 3.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[33:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_112.md) In Yt. XIX, 56-62;
V, 42.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[34:1](sbe4706.htm#fr_113.md) See Yt. XI-X, 82.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[34:2](sbe4706.htm#fr_114.md) Compare the
genealogy in Zs. XIII, 6; Bd. XXXII, 1, and that quoted there from the
Vi*g*îrka*rd*-i Dênîg. The names marked here with an asterisk are
written in Pâzand, or partly so.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[34:3](sbe4706.htm#fr_115.md) Ayazem, of Ra*g*an,
in Bd. The latter name is Ra*g*i*s*n in Vi*g*., but Êri*k*ŏ in Zs. XVI,
13.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[34:4](sbe4706.htm#fr_116.md) This wants
confirmation, but var*z*î*d* *b*ên can hardly be a name as assumed in
Vi*g*., where it is altered to Var*z*î*d*-dên.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[34:5](sbe4706.htm#fr_117.md) The g is of the old
form like s.

<span id="fn_118"></span>[34:6](sbe4706.htm#fr_118.md) The G is omitted,
but see Bd. XXXI, 14.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[34:7](sbe4706.htm#fr_119.md) Or Kûtâl-tô*r*â;
this generation is omitted both in the Vi*g*îrka*rd* and Bundahi*s*.

<span id="fn_120"></span>[34:8](sbe4706.htm#fr_120.md) This generation is
interlined in the MS. of the Dînka*rd*. The Bundahi*s*, XXXI, 7, also
omits Nêvak-tô*r*â; and the Vi*g*îrka*rd* omits Bôr-tô*r*â,
Sîyah-tô*r*â, Spêtô-tô*r*â, and Ramak-tô*r*â. The termination tô*r*â is
merely the Zvâri*s* equivalent of g*a*u. In Irânian MSS. the Pahlavi î
and û are practically written alike in most cases.
