### CHAPTER XXIII.

1\. On the completion of revelation, that is, at the end of the ten
years, Mê*d*yômâh, son of Arâstâî, became faithful to Zaratû*s*t.

2\. Afterwards, on *having* obtained *his* requests <span
id="fr_513"></span>[1](#fn_508), he came back to the conference of
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, and he spoke thus: 'In ten years *only* one man *has
been* attracted by me.' 3. *And* Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: '*There will*
be days when so few *are* not attracted by you, who *are* themselves the
occasion of the resurrection of the world; when, apart from Dahâk <span
id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_509), the beneficence of the formation of the
renovation *of the universe* attracts every one besides, and the
impenitence of Dahâk is destroyed.'

4\. When he came out from the presence of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, with the same
paradox, he thereby indicated his religion as complete to Spenda*r*ma*d*
through *his* intelligence.

5\. In the two years after that <span id="fr_515"></span>[3](#fn_510),
the Kavîgs and

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Karaps of
Vi*s*tâsp, *in* the manner of opponents (hamêstarânîh), propounded
thirty-three enquiries (khvâstakŏ) <span id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_511)
to him, so that *by* command of Vi*s*tâsp he became the explainer of
those thirty-three enquiries. 6. Of the thirty-three habits <span
id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_512) of iniquity, come for opposition to the
religion of the sacred beings; of the declaration, by revelation, of
those thirty-three indications of fetters <span
id="fr_518"></span>[3](#fn_513); *and* of the restraint of the
thirty-three iniquitous practices by the thirty-three best good works,
*there are* statements in revelation. 7. Including the acceptance of the
religion *by* Vi*s*tâsp from Zaratû*s*t, after the redemonstration of
its judicially multiform prophecy and spiritual character, which are
looked into through the evidence of three speakers about *them*, the
archangels who, with worldly manifestation, have become apparent unto
Vi*s*tâsp and *his* councillors *and* mighty ones; *they* are Vohûmanô,
A*rd*avahi*s*tô, and the Bûr*z*în-Mit*r*ô fire <span
id="fr_519"></span>[4](#fn_514).

8\. About the reward which *existed* before the beneficence of
Zaratû*s*t, and *its* being seen how, through guidance by Aûha*r*ma*zd*,
*it* is demonstrated by him to those of the world, so that Mê*d*yômâh is
attracted in the tenth year in the forest of reedy hollows
(kanyâstânŏ <span id="fr_520"></span>[5](#fn_515) vê*s*akŏ) which is the
haunt of swine of the wild-boar *species* (khazûrâ-î var*âz*ŏ gâs); in
the twentieth year the Kavîg who is son

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

of Kûndah <span id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_516) is attracted; in the
thirtieth year the Khyôns <span id="fr_522"></span>[2](#fn_517) arrive,
who make an incursion (var*d*akŏ) into the countries of Irân, owing to
the Kavîgs, those who are more of their own race; and in the fortieth
year Vohûnêm, son of Avarô*s*tar <span id="fr_523"></span>[3](#fn_518),
is born.

9\. In the forty-seventh year Zaratû*s*t passes away, who attains
seventy-seven years and forty days in the month A*rd*avahi*s*tô, *on*
the day Khûr <span id="fr_524"></span>[4](#fn_519); *and* for eight
rectified (vêhi*k*akŏ) months, till the month Dadvô and day Khûr, he
should be brought *forward* as to be reverenced.

10\. *In* the same month A*rd*avahi*s*tô, in the sixty-third <span
id="fr_525"></span>[5](#fn_520) year, Frashô*s*tar <span
id="fr_526"></span>[6](#fn_521) passed away, and in the sixty-fourth
year *G*âmâsp <span id="fr_527"></span>[7](#fn_522), *the same* as
became the priest of priests after Zaratû*s*t; in the seventy-third year
Hangâûrûsh, son of *G*âmâsp <span id="fr_528"></span>[8](#fn_523); in
the eightieth year Asmôk-khanvatô <span id="fr_529"></span>[9](#fn_524),
and *also* in the eightieth

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

year Kabed-û*s*-spâê <span id="fr_530"></span>[1](#fn_525), who is
called also Akht the wizard, is killed.

11\. Of the six great upholders of the religion there are the two
daughters of Zaratû*s*t, whose names are Frênŏ and Srîtŏ <span
id="fr_531"></span>[2](#fn_526), *with* Aharûbŏ-stôtô, *son* of
Mê*d*yômâh <span id="fr_532"></span>[3](#fn_527), and another three, who
*are* renowned for their religion for a hundred years, who are
Vohûnêm <span id="fr_533"></span>[4](#fn_528) that is born in the
fortieth year of the religion, Sênô <span
id="fr_534"></span>[5](#fn_529) is *afterwards* born and passes away in
the two-hundredth year, *and* as to his hundred-discipledom <span
id="fr_535"></span>[6](#fn_530), it exists day and night till the
three-hundredth year. 12. Afterwards the religion is disturbed and the
monarchy is contested (*g*angî-aîtŏ).

13\. About the three customs (dâ*d*ŏ) which Zaratû*s*t prescribed as the
best:—The first of them is this: 'Do not go without others, except with
magisterial authority (apatkâr ra*d*îhâ);' the second is: 'Though they
shall proceed unlawfully as to you, consider *your* actions lawfully
beforehand;' *and* the third is: 'Next-of-kin marriage, for the

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

sake of the pure progress of *your* race, is the best of the actions
*of* the living, which *are* provided for the proper begetting of
children <span id="fr_536"></span>[1](sbe4732.htm#fn_531).'

replies of the archangels to his enquiries.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[163:2](sbe4731.htm#fr_514) See Dk. VII, i, 26.
He was chained by Frê*d*ûn in Mount Dimâvand, to escape in the latter
days, to he slain by Keresâsp, and to be specially punished at the
resurrection (Bd. XII, 31; XXX, 16; Byt. III, 55-61).

<span id="fn_510"></span>[163:3](sbe4731.htm#fr_515) See Dk. VII, iv, 2.

<span id="fn_511"></span>[164:1](sbe4731.htm#fr_516) See Dk. VII, iv,
67.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[164:2](sbe4731.htm#fr_517) Reading *s*ôn =
Pers. sân; but the MSS. have dênô, 'religions.' The thirty sins and
thirty-three good works, detailed in Mkh.. XXXVI, XXXVII, are certainly
referred to at the end of this section.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[164:3](sbe4731.htm#fr_518) Compare Chap. XII,
5, and Dk. VII, iv, 67.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[164:4](sbe4731.htm#fr_519) See Dk. VII, iv,
74.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[164:5](sbe4731.htm#fr_520) Hybrid Zvâri*s* of
Pers. nayistân.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[165:1](sbe4731.htm#fr_521) Or Kûnîh which is
the name of a demon (see Sg. XVI, 13, 16, 18, 19); but such an
identification is uncertain.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[165:2](sbe4731.htm#fr_522) Av. *Hv*yaona of
Yt. IX, 30, 31; XVII, 50, 51. Compare Dk. VII, iv, 77, 83, 84, 87-90; V,
7.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[165:3](sbe4731.htm#fr_523) Av. gen.
'Vohu-nemang,hô Avârao*s*trôi*s*' of Yt. XIII, 104.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[165:4](sbe4731.htm#fr_524) The eleventh day of
the second month.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[165:5](sbe4731.htm#fr_525) T has 43d, and the
date is lost in the other MS. authority. But 43d is highly improbable
for two reasons: first, it would make this date the only one out of
chronological order in the series here given; secondly, it would render
it inconsistent with the statement, in Dk. VII, vi, 12, that two priests
came, from other regions, to ask Frashô*s*tar about the religion,
fifty-seven years after it had been accepted by Zaratû*s*t. By
substituting 63d (the Pahlavi cipher most likely to be corrupted into
43d) both these inconsistencies are removed.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[165:6](sbe4731.htm#fr_526) See Dk. VII, vi,
12; V, ii, 12.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[165:7](sbe4731.htm#fr_527) See Dk. V, ii, 12;
iii, 4.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[165:8](sbe4731.htm#fr_528) Av. gen.
'Hang,haurushô *G*âmâspanahê' of Yt. XIII, 104.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[165:9](sbe4731.htm#fr_529) Av. gen.
'Asmô-*hv*anvatô' of Yt. XIII, 96, and Westergaard's Yt. XXII, 37.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[166:1](sbe4731.htm#fr_530) As kabed is
Zvâri*s* for 'many,' we may assume that kabed-û*s* =Av. nom. pouru*s*
which usually becomes pouru in compounds; so that the compound name, or
title, in the text, probably represents Av. Pouruspâdha (Yt. X, 109,
111), 'having many troops,' a suitable title for Akht the wizard (Av.
Akhtya of Yt. V, 82) who is said, in Gf. I, 2, to have invaded a
district with an army of seven myriads. He was killed, in Zoroastrian
fashion, by the recital of a religious formula.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[166:2](sbe4731.htm#fr_531) There was a third
daughter, Pôru*k*îst (see Bd. XXXII, 5), but she may not have survived
her father.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[166:3](sbe4731.htm#fr_532) Av. gen. 'Ashastvô
Maidhyôi-m*a*ung,hôi*s*' of Yt. XIII, 106.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[166:4](sbe4731.htm#fr_533) See § 8.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[166:5](sbe4731.htm#fr_534) He was born in the
tooth year; see Dk. VII, vii, 6.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[166:6](sbe4731.htm#fr_535) This seems to be
the sixth upholder of the religion, the third of those lasting about a
century.
