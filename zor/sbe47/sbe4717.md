### CHAPTER II.

1\. In the pure light *and* equal to the archangels—collected together
and reckoned together, since the original creation, *and* completely
unmixed—Zaratû*s*t was spiritually fashioned and provided undefectively
for the acceptance and propagation of the religion in the world <span
id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_346.md). 2. And when he is sent for the
manifestation of restrained saintliness (môkîh) and bodily substance,
great glory and radiance become as much discernible in *him* as the same
*had* come into the posterity of Yim who are Pôrûshâspô <span
id="fr_351"></span>[2](#fn_347.md), his father, *and* Dûk*d*âûb <span
id="fr_352"></span>[3](#fn_348.md) who is his mother; and also while *he*
is *being* born and *for* the duration of life, he produced a radiance,
glow, and brilliance from the place of his own abode, that issued
intensely and strongly, like the splendour of fire, to distant
lands <span id="fr_353"></span>[4](#fn_349.md).

3\. Also *about* the wizards and witches, tyrants, Kîgs, and Karaps, and
other miscreants who have produced outrage for him during his birth and
child-hood, with desire for his destruction; who *have* manifestly come
about *his* death *or* disablement, and even so far as *those* who *have
come into* the visible assembly *about* the destruction of *his* glory
and other *causes of* helplessness <span
id="fr_354"></span>[5](#fn_350.md). 4. And also including the wolves *and*
other wild beasts, to whom *he was*

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

cast forth by those of Pôrûshâspô's kinsmen who *were* wizards, *and*
the kindred of those frequenting demon-worship, but only as a test <span
id="fr_355"></span>[1](#fn_351.md).

5\. *In* like manner it is declared *that*, on account of Vohûmanô
*being* welcome to him, he laughed out-right at birth <span
id="fr_356"></span>[2](#fn_352.md). 6. His coming for conference *with*
Aûha*r*ma*zd* <span id="fr_357"></span>[3](#fn_353.md), and owing to *his*
accepting the religion, Aharman and many demons and fiends have come to
him with exhibition of fear, offering of service, and the argument and
entreaty of supplicants; and all these have returned from him
disapprovingly, defeatedly, and confusedly, through the pure
proclamation of his Avesta, the unique perfection of Aûha*r*ma*zd*'s
will <span id="fr_358"></span>[4](#fn_354.md), and the indication of a
prepared armament (vîrâstŏ-zênîh), a declared reward, a powerful
sovereignty, and a way of injury *to* the destroyer.

7\. Also the triumph of the sacred beings *in* the end, and the
peculiarity *of* the joint control *of* the demons; how, before that,
they rushed openly into the world *and* have dwindled, *their* bodily
forms *are* shattered <span id="fr_359"></span>[5](#fn_355.md), and they
are so converted into secret decay, that *their* supplicants, deceived
and deceivers, became awful disputants through confession of it.

8\. And when, through completely accepting the religion from
Aûha*r*ma*zd*, he came to the obedient king Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp to attract
those of the world, he exhibited glorious actions of many kinds and the

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

smiting of demons and fiends; and *he* openly spoke the thoughts of king
Vi*s*tâsp and many of the multitude *about* hidden matters <span
id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_356.md), *thus*: 'A person is possessing life
only by destiny, and without his body, *but with* a like destiny, the
person possessing life is restored;' *he was* also opposing many
wizards, demon-worshippers, demon-consulters, *and* those seduced
*by* <span id="fr_361"></span>[2](#fn_357.md) deceivers who are awful
disputants. 9. And this *was* the utterance of those twelve stars whose
names *are those* of the twelve *zodiacal* constellations, and the
primitive learned of Bâpêl <span id="fr_362"></span>[3](#fn_358.md), that
have come to these, who *are* asking questions of the chief rulers of
Khvanîras, *have* to justify *it*, in the controversy, with the
spiritual and material customs and rude observances which are diversely
manifested, onwards from *the time of* Yim the splendid; and the
evidence of it, discernible with him, *was that of* Vohûmanô,
Ashavahi*s*tô, the fire, and some other good spirits <span
id="fr_363"></span>[4](#fn_359.md).

10\. Afterwards, too, the estimating and weighing of the whole utterance
of the religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd* *were* held out by him to Vi*s*tâsp and
those of the world, as very accountably a wonder; and further, too, he
remained as *it were* more conflicting with fellow-disputants than his
own words opposing the fellow-disputants.

11\. Also when, through the effect of glory and the struggle *for being*
saved, every class of apostles and prophets and manifestation of tokens
and such-like *were*, with certain *and* striking evidence, casting down
blessings, even thereupon the obedient king

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp's
fear of the adversary of religion, and also other causes, arose, on
account of which he *was* then accepting the propagation of the
religion <span id="fr_364"></span>[1](#fn_360.md), when its great glory
*and* beauty <span id="fr_365"></span>[2](#fn_361.md) *were* seen by him.
12. At first, Zarîr <span id="fr_366"></span>[3](#fn_362.md),
Spend-dâ*d* <span id="fr_367"></span>[4](#fn_363.md), Frashô*s*tar, and
*G*âmâsp <span id="fr_368"></span>[5](#fn_364.md), several of the realm
*who were* noble, conspicuous, and well-acting, the good *and* princes
*of* mankind, beheld visibly the will and desirableness of Aûha*r*ma*zd*
and the archangels, and the progressive religion of the creatures, fit
for those completely victorious (hû*k*îragânîg).

13\. Lastly, the seizure and capturing (gîrini*s*nŏ) by the demons *are*
beheld *and* watched; *and* they have remained opposing, owing to the
number *of* idolators competing wranglingly. 14. And much conflict and
slaughter occurred, which arose purely, so that the mingling *of* the
religion in the world proceeded <span id="fr_369"></span>[6](#fn_365.md).

15\. *There* are also his pure new bringers and complete controllers of
the same religion, Aûshê*d*ar <span id="fr_370"></span>[7](#fn_366.md),
Aûshê*d*ar-mâh <span id="fr_371"></span>[8](#fn_367.md), and Sôshâns <span
id="fr_372"></span>[9](#fn_368.md); and through the complete progress of
this religion of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, all the good creatures become without
disturbance and all-radiant <span id="fr_373"></span>[10](#fn_369.md).
