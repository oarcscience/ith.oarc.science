### CHAPTER X.

1\. About the marvellousness which is after the end of the millennium of
Aûshê*d*ar and the arrival of Aûshê*d*ar-mâh, until the end of the
millennium of Aûshê*d*ar-mâh and the arrival of Sôshâns; *and* as to
tidings of the same period.

2\. The marvellousness of Aûshê*d*ar-mâh as to birth <span
id="fr_315"></span>[1](#fn_311), glory of person, sayings, and actions;
the standing of the sun amid the sky twenty days long <span
id="fr_316"></span>[2](#fn_312); and the increase of the milk of cattle
arrives at a maximum (*av*artûm), *just* as what it says, that *one*
milks only one mature cow (tô*r*â az) for a thousand men, *and* that he
brings as much milk as a thousand men *require;* also the feebleness of

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

hunger and thirst is *just* as it says, that by only a single ration
*one* becomes satisfied *for* three nights, *and* whoever eats a leg
*of* mutton *has* plenty for him*self* *for* three days *and* nights. 3.
The diminution of decay and extension (vêshîh) of life, the increase of
humility and peace, *and* the perfection *of* liberality and enjoyment
in the world.

4\. Like this which revelation states, that, when the first ten winters
in the last millennium pass away, the Ma*zd*a-worshippers then make
enquiry together thus: '*Are* we really more hairy-headed
(sar-vars-*ik*-tar) than occurred before, owing to the well-yielding
cattle, so that food and clothing are less necessary for us? Has
affection come to us more completely, owing to those cattle, than it was
ours before? *Have* we grown up less deteriorated in the hair, by old
age, than *those* grown up before? *Are* the thoughts, words, *and*
deeds of our women and children more instructed than they were before?
5. And *has* this thing occurred, that he is classed as disqualified who
in training a child has become quite retrogressive (pas-ûruzd), and is
*his* penalty arranged? Does the fiend think of the Karap class, and
*are they* utterly destroyed by her through those whose thoughts are
most evil, devoid of righteousness, *and* devoid of a liking for
righteousness? 6. Near here, in the disturbance of the existences, does
that happen as heard by us from the ancients, when listening *to* the
true proclaimers of the Ma*zd*a-worshippers? And now, even when our
numbers *are* so greatly maintaining this dispensation, do we sanctify
(aharâyînem) righteousness (that is, do we perform duty and good works)
more vociferously *and* more strenuously?'

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

7\. This, too, it says, even that no one passes away in the last
millennium, other than those whom they smite with a scaffold
weapon <span id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_313), and *those* who pass away
from old age. 8. When fifty-three years of that millennium of his have
remained, the sweetness and oiliness in milk *and* vegetables are so
completed that, on account of the freedom of mankind from wanting meat,
they shall leave off the eating of meat, and their food becomes milk and
vegetables. 9. When three years have remained, they shall leave off even
the drinking of milk, and their food *and* drink become water and
vegetables.

10\. And in his millennium *are* the breaking (lânakŏ) of the fetters of
Dahâk <span id="fr_318"></span>[2](#fn_314), the rousing of
Kerêsâspô <span id="fr_319"></span>[3](#fn_315) for the smiting of
Dahâk, the arrival of Kai-Khûsrô <span id="fr_320"></span>[4](#fn_316)
and his companions for the assistance of Sôshâns in the production of
the renovation *of the universe*, and the provision of most *of* mankind
with the Gâthic disposition and law; also the occurrence of many other
wonders and marvels is manifest in that millennium of his.

11\. And this, too, it says, namely: 'When that millennium *has* fully
elapsed, which is the second of the religion *of* the
Ma*zd*a-worshippers, what is the separation after the first century?'
12. And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: 'The sun conceals *itself*.' 13. 'And
what is the separation after the second,

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, or tenth century?'
14. And Aûha*r*ma*zd* spoke thus: 'The sun conceals *itself*.'

15\. And when thirty winters of the tenth century *are* unelapsed, that
maiden, who is Gôbâk-abû <span id="fr_321"></span>[1](#fn_317), walks up
to the water; she that is the mother of that testifying Sôshâns who is
the guide to conveying away the opposition of the destroyer, and her
former lineage is from Vôhû-rô*k*ô-î Frahânyân <span
id="fr_322"></span>[2](#fn_318) in the family of Îsa*d*vâstar, the son
of Zaratû*s*t *that* is brought forth by Arang. 16. 'That maiden whose
title is All-overpowerer is thus all-overpowering, because through
giving birth she brings forth him who over-powers all, both the
affliction owing to demons, and also that owing to mankind <span
id="fr_323"></span>[3](#fn_319).' 17. Then she sits in that water, when
she is fifteen years old, *and* it introduces *into* the girl him 'whose
name is the Triumphant Benefiter, and *his* title is the Body-maker;
such a benefiter as benefits (savînê*d*ŏ) the whole embodied existence,
and such a *body-*maker, alike possessing body and possessing life, as
petitions about the disturbance of the embodied existences *and*
mankind <span id="fr_324"></span>[4](#fn_320).' 18. Not before that *has
she* associated with men; nor yet afterwards, when she becomes pregnant,
*has she done so* before the time when she gives birth <span
id="fr_325"></span>[5](#fn_321).

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

19\. When that man becomes thirty years old, the sun stands still in the
zenith of the sky *for* the duration of thirty days *and* nights, and it
arrives again at that place where it *was* appointed by allotment.

destitute,' which must be wrong.

Aûshê*d*ar-mâh, the arrival of Sôshâns, <span id="page_116">p.
