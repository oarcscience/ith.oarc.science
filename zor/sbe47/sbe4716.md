# DÎNKA*RD*.—BOOK V.

### CHAPTER I.

1\. The triumph of the creator Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *and* glory of complete
wisdom, is the divine (ahûîg) religion of Ma*zd*a-worship.

2\. The fifth *book* is about the sayings of the saintly
Âtû*r*-farnbag <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_333.md), son of
Farukhzâ*d*, *who* was the leader of the orthodox, even as to the
manuscript which is called Gyêmarâ <span
id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_334.md). 3. The collected replies of
Âtû*r*-farnbag,

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

son of Farukhzâ*d*, the leader of the orthodox, about several
significant questions that *are* the wonder of the moderns, which *are*
like the friendly words, spoken by him *as to* those of the ancient
tribe <span id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_335) (kâmon-ramân.md) who call *it*
really their Gyêmarâ, which *are* obtaining <span
id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_336.md) a like wonder for them openly accessible
to him <span id="fr_341"></span>[3](#fn_337.md).

4\. About the unswerving *and* co-operating chieftainship of those
forefathers who went in mutually-friendly command of troops, *and* the
complete enclosure of that tribe within the military control of
Bûkht-Narsîh <span id="fr_342"></span>[4](#fn_338.md). 5. About the
disabling of vicious habits and evil deeds, which are entirely
connected, and of the heinous demon-worship and mischief which

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

are owing to them, through the ruler Kaî-Loharâsp <span
id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_339.md)t being sent, with Bûkht-Narsîh, from the
country of Irân to Bêtâ-Makdis <span id="fr_344"></span>[2](#fn_340.md) of
Arûm, and *their* remaining *in* that quarter. 6. And the orthodox
belief in the rude particulars *of* religious custom in the mutual
deliberation of those of the tribe, the acquaintance with religion of a
boor (durû*s*takŏ-1), the difficult arrangements, and the enquirer
doubtful of the religion after the many controversial, deliberative, and
cause-investigating questions and answers adapted to the importunities
of that wordy disciple <span id="fr_345"></span>[3](#fn_341.md).

7\. About how the accepting of this religion *by* the prophets before
Zaratû*s*t *occurred* <span id="fr_346"></span>[4](#fn_342.md), how the
pure *and* saintly Zaratû*s*t of the Spîtâmas came <span
id="fr_347"></span>[5](#fn_343.md), and who *will* afterwards come as
bringers of the same pure and good religion *here*after <span
id="fr_348"></span>[6](#fn_344.md). 8. That is, of the prophets, apostles,
and accepters of the religion, *there* were *they* who accepted *it*
concisely *and* completely *such* as Gâyômar*d* was, from whom *came*
irregularly (durû*s*takŏ) *such* as Masyê and Sîyâmak, Hâôshâng,
Tâkhmôrup, Yim, Frê*d*ûn, Mânû*sk*îhar, the Sâmân, the Kayân, and also
many other leaders in *those* times <span
id="fr_349"></span>[7](#fn_345.md). 9. And their acceptance expressly at
various times is produced for action, and thereby the adversity of the
creatures is removed, benefit

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

and prosperity *are* sought, the world is controlled, and the creator
and good creations are propitiated.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_333"></span>[119:1](sbe4716.htm#fr_337.md) He was the leader
of the orthodox about A*D*. 815-835, and held a religious disputation
with the heretic Abâli*s* in the presence of the Khalîfah Al-Mâmûn (A.
n. 813-833), as detailed in the Mâ*d*îgân-î Gu*g*astak Abâli*s*. He was
also the first compiler of the Dînka*rd*, probably of its first two
Books, which are not yet discovered, as well as of some of the materials
for the other Books. (See S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, p. 411, n. 1.)

<span id="fn_334"></span>[119:2](sbe4716.htm#fr_338.md) The name of this
MS. can be only guessed. It occurs three times in each of the two MS.
authorities, B and K43, and the simplest reading of five of these six
occurrences would be Sîmrâ, so that the remaining one (Sarmâ) may be
neglected as a corruption. A final â in Pahlavi is a very certain
indication of a Semitic word, for if a final of similar form occurs in
an Irânian word, it represents either h or kh; so if the name were
Irânian, its most probable reading would be Sîmurkh. But, in § 3, it is
intimated that the MS. belonged to an ancient tribe, or congregation
(ram); it also seems, from Chap. IV, 8, 9, that the religion of this
tribe was not so inconsistent with Zoroastrianism, as to prevent its
members being taught that orthodox faith; and §§ 4, 5 of the present
chapter appear to quote from that MS. some <span id="page_120">p.
120</span> particulars regarding the siege of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar. From these circumstances we may suspect that
Âtû*r*-farnbag, while collecting materials for his Dînka*rd*, had asked
some Jewish friends what information their MSS. contained regarding the
old Persians, as the two peoples had been in contact, more or less, ever
since the time of the Achaemenian dynasty. If he did so enquire, the
Jews would naturally search in the Talmud, in which references to the
Persians still survive, though the text is no longer complete. The
question is, therefore, whether the MS., whose name has been
provisionally read Sîmrâ, can have had any connection with the Talmud.
It will be at once evident to any Pahlavi student that Pahl. sî may be
read gyê equally well, and that we have no better reason for reading
Sîmrâ than for the Gyêmarâ, which has been put into the text, as a
suggestion that Âtû*r*-farnbag was really referring to the Gemarâ of the
Jews, the supplement to their commentary upon Scripture. Whether this
can be clearly proved remains to be seen, and positive evidence seems
scanty.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[120:1](sbe4716.htm#fr_339.md) Or 'congregation.'

<span id="fn_336"></span>[120:2](sbe4716.htm#fr_340.md) Or 'including (van
dig).'

<span id="fn_337"></span>[120:3](sbe4716.htm#fr_341.md) Pahl. 'mûn*s*ânŏ
ham-shkûp-vindîg fr*âz* aûbas yehamtûni*s*nîg.' From which it appears as
if there had been a mutual interchange of information between him and
his Jewish friends.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[120:4](sbe4716.htm#fr_342.md) The Pahlavi form of
Bu‘*h*t-i-naʓar, or Nebuchadnezzar.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[121:1](sbe4716.htm#fr_343.md) The father of
Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp (see Bd. XXXI, 8, 29; XXXIV, 7). His expedition to
Jerusalem is mentioned in Pahl. Mkh. XXVIII, 67, and by some Arab
writers.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[121:2](sbe4716.htm#fr_344.md) 'The holy place,' a
title of Jerusalem.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[121:3](sbe4716.htm#fr_345.md) Not identified.
From this point to Chap. IV, 7, Âtû*r*-farnbag must have used the same
authorities as the writer of Dk. VII; but he returns to the Gyêmarâ in
Chap. IV, 8.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[121:4](sbe4716.htm#fr_346.md) Dk. VII, i, 7-40.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[121:5](sbe4716.htm#fr_347.md) Ibid. 41.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[121:6](sbe4716.htm#fr_348.md) Ibid. 42.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[121:7](sbe4716.htm#fr_349.md) See the details in
Dk. VII, i, 7-40. §§ 1-8 have been already translated in Grundriss der
iranischen Philologie, ii. 93-94.
