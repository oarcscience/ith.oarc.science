### CHAPTER XVIII.

1\. About his diverse want of participation (gvî*d* akhvê*s*îh) with
*his* parents this also is declared, that the demons, at an assembly of
wizards, produced an outcry *for* a conference (ham-vâ*k*ô lâyi*s*nŏ)
thus: 'That son of Pôrûshaspô is senseless and foolish *and* secretly
corrupted; no one, man *or* woman, *will* consider *or* accept *him* as
exalted.'

2\. The tidings came to Pôrûshaspô, and Pôrûshaspô spoke unto Zaratû*s*t
thus: 'I thought that I *had* begotten a son who *would* become a
priest, a warrior, and a husbandman, and now thou

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

wouldst be foolish and secretly corrupted; thou shouldst proceed to the
Karaps, so that they may cure *thee*.'

3\. Zaratû*s*t gave answer thus: 'I *am he* that is thy son, a priest,
warrior, and husbandman.' 4. And, by command of Pôrûshaspô he harnessed
two horses to a chariot (var*d*înŏ), and he went with Pôrûshaspô.

5\. When they came to the place according to the decision of Pôrûshaspô,
into the presence of one Karap of those said five brethren, that wizard
took a cup and made water, and spoke thus: 'This he should drink who is
a son of thine, so that he *may* become well;' and he acted with this
conviction, that so he would change to the same nature as theirs.

6\. Zaratû*s*t spoke to Pôrûshaspô thus: 'Thou mayst give *it* back to
him who is thy protector *and* high-priest;' and he arose
(âkhê*g*îd) <span id="fr_458"></span>[1](#fn_454.md) and went back to
*their* place.

7\. On the way, Zaratû*s*t gave *their* two horses water, on account of
*their* thirst; and he thought thus: 'Unprofitable was my going to the
residence of the Karaps, except *in* this manner, when, through giving
water to the horses, my soul *was* then expanded.'
