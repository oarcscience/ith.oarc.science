### CHAPTER XV.

1\. About the brothers who *were* a band of opponents of Zaratû*s*t. 2.
The Karaps and Aûsikhshes <span id="fr_439"></span>[3](#fn_435.md) *were*
brothers’ sons, and have become the devastation (gâstâragîh) of the
Irânians; the devastators of the Irânians (Êrânân) *were* from
Kôkharê*d* <span id="fr_440"></span>[4](#fn_436.md), and Kôkharê*d* *was*
born from Aêshm and Mânû*s*ak, the sister of Mânû*sk*îhar <span
id="fr_441"></span>[5](#fn_437.md). 3. At the place where Zaratû*s*t *was*
born, five brothers have been, whose names were Brâ*d*-rûkhsh,
Brâ*d*-rôyi*s*n, Brâ*d*-rêsh the Tûr, Hazân, and Vadast <span
id="fr_442"></span>[6](#fn_438.md). 4. Their

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

brotherhood of five—of which the middle *one was* Brâ*d*-rêsh the Tûr,
who became more of an adversary of Zaratû*s*t—*was* a semblance of the
brother-hood of five who *were* sons of Pôrûshaspô, of whom the middle
*one* was Zaratû*s*t.

5\. Of the four brothers *of* Zaratû*s*t, the names of the two before
Zaratû*s*t *were* Ratû*s*tar and Rangû*s*tar, and of the two after *him*
No*d*arîgâ and Nîvê*d*i*s* <span id="fr_443"></span>[1](#fn_439.md). 6. The
middle position of Zaratû*s*t is for the reason that he is so produced
at that time, as an inter-medium of the early narrators and the later
narrators, that three millenniums came before him and three after. 7. So
that he *has* prescribed to the creatures in what manner he would teach
the ancients as to what *had* occurred, and *in* what manner *it* is
also to be done as regards what *will* occur; as is stated in the
Gâthas <span id="fr_444"></span>[2](#fn_440.md) thus: 'Both those I ask of
thee, *O* Aûha*r*ma*zd*! even whatever *has* happened till now, *and*
whatever shall happen henceforth?'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_435"></span>[143:3](sbe4723.htm#fr_439.md) Av. 'Karapâ
Usikhsh-*k*â' of Yas. XLIV, 20 c; the Kavâ, a third class of
pre-Zoroastrian priests, is also mentioned ibid. 20 d. Compare Dk. VII,
ii, 9 n.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[143:4](sbe4723.htm#fr_440.md) Av. Ka*hv*aredha,
Yas. LX, 6, 7 (Sp.) where it is translated by kâstâr, 'diminisher,
devastator,' of whom it is here said to be the father; see also Yt. III,
9, 12, 16.

<span id="fn_437"></span>[143:5](sbe4723.htm#fr_441.md) Compare the legend
of the descent of the ape and bear from a demon and Yimak, sister of
Yim, in Bd. XXIII, 1.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[143:6](sbe4723.htm#fr_442.md) As these names do
not occur in the Avesta, their pronunciation <span id="page_144">p.
144</span> has to be guessed so as to give a probable meaning to the
Pahlavi spelling. The writing of the last name is complicated; it is
written <span id="img_14400"></span> ![](img/14400.jpg) and <span
id="img_14401"></span> ![](img/14401.jpg) in the two MS. authorities,
which forms can be most obviously read Vasam and Saman, but Saman can
also be read as the Zvâri*s* yad*â* = dast, 'a hand;' this leads to the
conclusion that the original name underlies the form Vadast, and this is
confirmed by the name of the Karap Vaêdvôi*s*t written at full length in
Dk. VII, iv, 21-24. See ibid. ii, 9 n.

<span id="fn_439"></span>[144:1](sbe4723.htm#fr_443.md) These brothers seem
unmentioned elsewhere, and the existence of the elder two would imply
another mother. The pronunciation of the names is guessed.

<span id="fn_440"></span>[144:2](sbe4723.htm#fr_444.md) Pahl. Yas. XXXI, 14
a.
