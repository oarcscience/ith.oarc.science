### CHAPTER XXIV.

1\. About the five dispositions of priests, and the ten admonitions with
which all instruction as to religion is connected <span
id="fr_537"></span>[2](#fn_532).

2\. Of those five dispositions the first is innocence.

3\. The second is discrimination among <span
id="fr_538"></span>[3](#fn_533) thoughts, words, and deeds; \[to fully
distinguish the particulars of destruction from indestructiveness,
*such* as

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

noxious creatures from cattle; and of production from unproductiveness,
*such* as the righteous *and* worthy from the wicked *and* unworthy\].

4\. The third is authoritativeness, because that priestly master is
always wiser and speaking more correctly who is taught wisely and
teaches with more correct words.

5\. The fourth is to <span id="fr_539"></span>[1](#fn_534) \[understand
*and* consider the ceremonial as the ceremonial of Aûha*r*ma*zd*, *and*
the essentials with all goodness, beneficence, *and* authority; to be
steadfast in his religion, and to consider the indications of protection
(sâyag) <span id="fr_540"></span>[2](#fn_535) which are established for
his religion. 6. To maintain the reverence of the luminaries
prayerfully, *also* the reverence of the emanations <span
id="fr_541"></span>[3](#fn_536) *from* the six <span
id="fr_542"></span>[4](#fn_537) *archangels*, be they fire, be they
earth, *or* be they of bodily form, and of the creatures *which* are
formed by them; also the pure cleansing from dead matter, menstruation,
bodily refuse, and ether hurtfulness; this is in order that they *may*
be characterised, and thereby constituted, *as* better-principled, more
sensible <span id="fr_543"></span>[5](#fn_538), and purer, and they
*may* become less faulty. 7. The reverence of mankind is to consider
authoritatively about knowledge *and* property; the reverence of cattle
is *about* fodder, little hardship, and moderate maintenance; the
reverence of plants is *about* sowing and ripening for the food of the
worthy. 8. The ceremonial which is glorifying all

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

the sacred beings, praises the luminaries *and* worldly creations
improperly, and is antagonistic to them, because complete glorification
is proper through complete recitation of the ritual; and the ceremonial
of any one whatever is his own proper duty professionally, so long as it
is possible to, keep proceeding with very little sinfulness\].

9\. The fifth is to struggle prayerfully <span
id="fr_544"></span>[1](#fn_539), day and night, with your own
fiend <span id="fr_545"></span>[2](#fn_540), *and all* life long not to
depart from steadfastness; nor allow *your* proper duty <span
id="fr_546"></span>[3](#fn_541) *to go* out of *your* hands.

10\. And the first of those ten admonitions is to proceed with good
repute, for the sake of occasioning approving remarks *as to* <span
id="fr_547"></span>[4](#fn_542) the good repute of *your* own guardian
*and* teacher, high-priest *and* master <span
id="fr_548"></span>[5](#fn_543).

11\. The second is to become awfully refraining from evil repute, for
the sake of evil repute not occurring *to* relations and guardians.

12\. The third is not to beat *your* own teacher with a snatched-up
stick, and not to bring scandal upon his name, for the sake of annoying
him, by *uttering* that which *was* not heard from *your* own teacher.

13\. The fourth is *that* whatever is taught liberally by your own
teacher, *you have* to deliver back to the worthy, for the sake of not
extorting a declaration of renown from the righteous <span
id="fr_549"></span>[6](#fn_544).

14\. The fifth is *that* the reward of doers of good

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

works *and* the punishment of criminals *have to be* established by law,
for the sake of progress <span id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_545).

15\. The sixth is to keep the way of the good open to *your* house, for
the sake of making <span id="fr_551"></span>[2](#fn_546) righteousness
welcome in *your* own abode.

16\. The seventh is *that*, for the sake of not developing the fiend
insensibly in *your* reason, *you are* not to keep *it* with the
religion of the good <span id="fr_552"></span>[3](#fn_547), nor to
remain in impenitence of sin.

17\. The eighth <span id="fr_553"></span>[4](#fn_548) is *that*, for the
sake of severing the fiend from the reason, *you have* to force malice
*away* from *your* thoughts, and to become quickly repentant of sin.

18\. The ninth is to fully understand the forward movement <span
id="fr_554"></span>[5](#fn_549) of the religion, also to keep the
advancing of the religion further forwards, and to seek *your* share of
duty therein; and on a backward movement, when adversity happens to the
religion, to have the religion back again, and to keep *your* body in
the continence (makavadîh) of religion.

19\. The tenth is *that there is* to be a period of obedience
(Srôshdârîh) towards the ruler and priestly authority, the
high-priesthood of the religious <span id="fr_555"></span>[6](#fn_550).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_531"></span>[167:1](sbe4731.htm#fr_536) This chapter ends
the first series of Selections of Zâ*d*-sparam, and is immediately
followed in the MSS. by a second series. It is evident from the extent
of this chapter, as compared with the amount of text contained in the
three misplaced folios (see p. 162, n; 3), that this chapter could have
occupied only about one folio and a half in the dislocated MS., so that
the second series must have commenced on the same folio as contained the
end of this chapter, and that Chaps. XXIV, XXV cannot have belonged to
this series. The three misplaced folios contain two distinct texts; the
first (Chap. XXIV) is an Iranian version of the Five Dispositions of
priests and the Ten Admonitions, and is here translated; the second
(Chap. XXV) contains some details about the Nasks and Gâthas, and has
been already translated in S.B.E., vol. xxxvii, pp. 401-405.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[167:2](sbe4732.htm#fr_537) This Iranian
version of the Dispositions and Admonitions is more complete than the
Indian version, which, like the Bundahi*s*, was brought from Irân five
or six centuries ago, and is found in two MSS. (Pt. and J) written in
India about 500 years ago, and now in the libraries of Dastûrs Dr.
Peshotan and Di. Jâmâsp, respectively. Passages which occur only in the
Iranian version are here enclosed in brackets, and other differences
between the two versions are mentioned in the notes.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[167:3](sbe4732.htm#fr_538) The Indian version
has 'of.'

<span id="fn_534"></span>[168:1](sbe4732.htm#fr_539) Ind. vers. has
only: 'to celebrate the ceremonial of the sacred beings with the correct
words, inward prayers, and complete mastery of the text (narm-nasgîhâ)
in the ritual.' It omits §§ 6-8 altogether.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[168:2](sbe4732.htm#fr_540) T has 'limit
(kûstak).'

<span id="fn_536"></span>[168:3](sbe4732.htm#fr_541) T has 'issue.'

<span id="fn_537"></span>[168:4](sbe4732.htm#fr_542) T has 'seven.'

<span id="fn_538"></span>[168:5](sbe4732.htm#fr_543) Or 'more fragrant;'
hû-bôdtar has both meanings.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[169:1](sbe4732.htm#fr_544) Ind. vers. has: 'to
remain in diligence intelligently.'

<span id="fn_540"></span>[169:2](sbe4732.htm#fr_545) Ind. vers. has:
'opponent.'

<span id="fn_541"></span>[169:3](sbe4732.htm#fr_546) Ind. vers. has:
'steadfastness in religion, and to be diligent in *your* proper duty.'
But it omits the rest of the sentence.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[169:4](sbe4732.htm#fr_547) Ind. vers. has:
'for the sake of the appropriateness of.'

<span id="fn_543"></span>[169:5](sbe4732.htm#fr_548) Or 'father.'

<span id="fn_544"></span>[169:6](sbe4732.htm#fr_549) T has: 'not
extracting the purity of the righteous.'

<span id="fn_545"></span>[170:1](sbe4732.htm#fr_550) Ind. vers. adds:
'of religion.'

<span id="fn_546"></span>[170:2](sbe4732.htm#fr_551) Ind. vers. inserts:
'a token of;' and T has: 'making the righteousness of the sacred beings
in writing welcome.'

<span id="fn_547"></span>[170:3](sbe4732.htm#fr_552) Ind. vers. has:
'not to maintain malice with the good,' which is more probable, and
kênŏ, 'malice,' is easily corrupted into dênô, 'religion,' in Pahlavi
writing.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[170:4](sbe4732.htm#fr_553) This eighth
admonition is omitted in the Irânian MSS.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[170:5](sbe4732.htm#fr_554) Ind. vers. adds:
'and backward movement.'

<span id="fn_550"></span>[170:6](sbe4732.htm#fr_555) Chapter XXV, about
the three divisions of revelation, is translated in S.B.E., vol. xxxvii,
pp. 401-405.
