## CHAPTER III.

### THE FORMATION OF THE ZEND-AVESTA.

§ 1. The collection of Zend fragments, known as the Zend-Avesta <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md), is divided, in its usual form, into two
parts.

The first part, or the Avesta properly so called, contains the Vendîdâd,
the Vispêrad, and the Yasna. The Vendîdâd is a compilation of religious
laws and of mythical tales; the Vispêrad is a collection of litanies for
the sacrifice; and the Yasna is composed of litanies of the same kind
and of five hymns or Gâthas written in a special dialect, older than the
general language of the Avesta.

These three books are found in manuscripts in two different forms:
either each by itself, in which case they are generally accompanied by a
Pahlavi translation; or the three mingled together according to the
requirements of the liturgy, as they are not each recited separately in
their entirety, but the chapters of the different books are
intermingled; and in this case the collection is called the Vendîdâd
Sâdah or 'Vendîdâd pure,' as it exhibits the original text alone,
without a translation.

The second part, generally known as the Khorda Avesta or 'Small Avesta,'
is composed of short prayers which are recited not only by the priests,
but by all the faithful, at certain moments of the day, month, or year,
and in presence of the different elements; these prayers are the five
Gâh, the thirty formulas of the Sîrôzah, the three Âfrigân, and the six
Nyâyi*s*. But it is also usual to include in the Khorda Avesta, although
forming no real part of it, the Ya*s*ts or hymns of praise and
glorification to the several

<span id="page_xxxi">p. xxxi</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Izads, and a
number of fragments, the most important of which is the Hadhôkht Nosk.

§ 2. That the extent of the sacred literature of Mazdeism was formerly
much greater than it is now, appears not only from internal evidence,
that is, from the fragmentary character of the book, but is also proved
by historical evidence. In the first place, the Arab conquest proved
fatal to the religious literature of the Sassanian ages, a great part of
which was either destroyed by the fanaticism of the conquerors and the
new converts, or lost during the long exodus of the Parsis. Thus the
Pahlavi translation of the Vendîdâd, which was not finished before the
latter end of the Sassanian dynasty, contains not a few Zend quotations
from books which are no longer in existence; other quotations, as
remarkable in their importance as in their contents, are to be found in
Pahlavi and Parsi tracts, like the Nîrangistân and the Aogemaidê. The
Bundahi*s* contains much matter which is not spoken of in the existing
Avesta, but which is very likely to have been taken from Zend books
which were still in the hands of its compiler. It is a tradition with
the Parsis, that the Ya*s*ts were originally thirty in number, there
having been one for each of the thirty Izads who preside over the thirty
days of the month; yet there are only eighteen still extant.

The cause that preserved the Avesta is obvious; taken as a whole, it
does not profess to be a religious encyclopedia, but only a liturgical
collection, and it bears more likeness to a Prayer Book than to the
Bible. It can be readily conceived that the Vendîdâd Sâdah, which had to
be recited every day, would be more carefully preserved than the
Ya*s*ts, which are generally recited once a month; and these again more
carefully than other books, which, however sacred they might be, were
not used in the performance of worship. Many texts, no doubt, were lost
in consequence of the Arab conquest, but mostly such as would have more
importance in the eyes of the theologian than in those of the priest. We
have a fair specimen of what these lost texts may have been in the few
non-liturgical fragments which we still possess, such as the Vi*s*tâsp
Ya*s*t and

<span id="page_xxxii">p. xxxii</span>

the blessing of Zoroaster upon King Vi*s*tâsp, which belong to, the old
epic cycle of Iran, and the Hadhôkht Nosk, which treats of the fate of
the soul after death.

§ 3. But if we have lost much of the Sassanian sacred literature,
Sassanian Persia herself, if we may trust Parsi tradition, had lost
still more of the original books. The primitive Avesta, as revealed by
Ormazd to Zoroaster and by Zoroaster to Vi*s*tâsp, king of Bactria, was
supposed to have been composed of twenty-one Nosks or Books, the greater
part of which was burnt by Iskander the Rûmi (Alexander the Great).
After his death the priests of the Zoroastrian religion met together,
and by collecting the various fragments that had escaped the ravages of
the war and others that they knew by heart, they formed the present
collection, which is a very small part of the original book, as out of
the twenty-one Nosks there was only one that was preserved in its
entirety, the Vendîdâd <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md).

This tradition is very old, and may be traced back from the present
period even to Sassanian times <span id="fr_36"></span>[2](#fn_36.md). It
involves the assumption that the Avesta is the remnant of the sacred
literature of Persia under the last Achæmenian kings. To ascertain
whether this inference is correct, and to what extent it may be so, we
must first try to define, as. accurately as we can, the exact time at
which the collection, now in existence, was formed.

§ 4. The Ravâet quoted above states that it was formed 'after the death
of Iskander,' which expression is rather vague, and may as well mean
'centuries after his death' as 'immediately after his death.' It is, in
fact, hardly to be doubted that the latter was really what the writer
meant; yet, as the date of that Ravâet is very recent, we had better
look for older and more precise traditions. We find such a one in the
Dînkar*t*, a Pahlavi book which enjoys great authority with the Parsis
of our days, and which, although it contains many things of late
origin <span id="fr_37"></span>[3](#fn_37.md), also comprises many

<span id="page_xxxiii">p. xxxiii</span>

old and valuable traditions. According to a proclamation, ascribed to
Khosrav Anôsharvân (531-579), the collection of the Avesta fragments was
begun in the reign of the last Arsacides, and was finished under Shapûr
II (309-380). King Valkash (Vologeses), it is said, first ordered all
the fragments of the Avesta which might have escaped the ravages of
Iskander, or been preserved by oral tradition, to be searched for and
collected together. The first Sassanian king, Ardeshîr Bâbagân, made the
Avesta the sacred book of Iran, and Mazdeism the state religion: at
last, Âdarbâd under Shapûr II, purified the Avesta and fixed the number
of the Nasks, and Shapûr proclaimed to the heterodox <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md): 'Now that we have recognised the law of
the world here below, they shall not allow the infidelity of any one
whatever <span id="fr_39"></span>[2](#fn_39.md), as I shall strive that it
may be so <span id="fr_40"></span>[3](#fn_40.md).'

§ 5. The authenticity of this record has been called in question,
chiefly, I think, on account of the part that it ascribes to an Arsacide
prince, which seems hardly to agree with the ideas generally entertained
about the character of the Sassanian revolution <span
id="fr_41"></span>[4](#fn_41.md). Most Parsi and Muhammedan writers agree
that it was the Sassanian dynasty which raised the Zoroastrian religion
from the state of humiliation into which the Greek invasion had made it
sink, and, while it gave the signal for a revival of the old national
spirit, made Mazdeism one of the corner stones of the new
establishment <span id="fr_42"></span>[5](#fn_42.md). Therefore it seems
strange to hear that the first step taken to make Mazdeism a state
religion was taken by one of those very Philhellenic Parthian princes,
who were so imbued with Greek ideas and manners. Yet this is the

<span id="page_xxxiv">p. xxxiv</span>

very reason why we ought to feel some hesitation in rejecting this
document, and its being at variance with the general Parsi view speaks
rather for its authenticity; for as it was the general post-Sassanian
tradition that the restoration of Mazdeism was the work of the first
Sassanian kings, no Parsi would ever have thought of making them share
what was in his eyes their first and best title of honour with any of
the despised princes of the Parthian dynasty.

§ 6. It is difficult, of course, to prove directly the authenticity of
this record, the more so as we do not even know who was the king alluded
to. There were, in fact, four kings at least who bore the name of
Valkhash: the most celebrated and best known of the four was
Vologeses <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md), the contemporary of Nero.
Now that Zoroastrianism prevailed with him, or at least with members of
his family, we see from the conduct of his brother Tiridates, who was a
Magian (Magus) <span id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md); and by this term we
must not understand a magician <span id="fr_45"></span>[3](#fn_45.md), but
a priest, and one of the Zoroastrian religion. That he was a priest
appears from Tacitus’ testimony <span id="fr_46"></span>[4](#fn_46.md);
that he was a Zoroastrian is shown by his scruples about the worship of
the elements. When he came from Asia to Rome to receive the crown of
Armenia at the hands of Nero, he wanted not to come by sea, but rode
along the coasts, <span id="fr_47"></span>[5](#fn_47.md), because the Magi
were forbidden to defile the sea <span id="fr_48"></span>[6](#fn_48.md).
This is quite in the spirit of later Zoroastrianism, and savours much of
Mazdeism. That Vologeses himself shared the religious scruples of his
brother appears from his answer to Nero,

<span id="page_xxxv">p. xxxv</span>

who insisted upon his coming to Rome also: 'Come yourself, it is easier
for you to cross such immensity of sea <span
id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md).'

§ 7. Thus we hear on one hand from the Parsis that the first collection
of the Avesta was made by an Arsacide named Vologeses; and we hear, on
the other hand, from a quite independent source, that an Arsacide named
Vologeses behaved himself as a follower of the Avesta might have done.
In all this there is no evidence that it is Vologeses I who is mentioned
in the Dînkar*t*, much less that he was really the first editor of the
Avesta; but it shows at all events that the first attempt to recover the
sacred literature of Iran might very well have been made by an Arsacide,
and that we may trust, in this matter, to a document which has been
written perhaps by a Sassanian king, but, at any rate, in a Sassanian
spirit. In fact, in the struggle between Ardavan and Ardeshîr, there was
no religious interest at stake, but only a political one; and we are
expressly told by Hamza that between Ardeshîr and his adversaries there
was perfect accordance in religious matters <span
id="fr_50"></span>[2](#fn_50.md). It can, therefore, be fairly admitted
that even in the time and at the court of the Philhellenic Parthians a
Zoroastrian movement may have originated, and that there came a time
when they perceived that a national religion is a part of national life.
It was the merit of the Sassanides that they saw the drift of this idea
which they had the good fortune to carry out; and this would not be the
only instance, in the history of the world, of an idea being sown by one
party and its advantages reaped by their adversaries.

<span id="page_xxxvi">p. xxxvi</span>

§ 8. Another presumptive evidence of the groundwork of the Avesta being
anterior to the age of the Sassanians is given by the language in which
it is written. That language not only was not, but had never been, the
national language of Persia. It is indeed closely connected with the
ancient Persian, as found in the cuneiform inscriptions of the
Achæmenian kings, from which modern Persian is derived; but the
relations between ancient Persian and Zend are of such a kind that
neither language can be conceived as being derived from the other; they
are not one and the same language in two different stages of its
development, but two independent dialects in nearly the same stage,
which is a proof that they did not belong to the same country, and,
therefore, that Zend was not the language of Persia. Now the language
used in Persia after the death of Alexander, under the Arsacides and
Sassanides, that is, during the period in which the Avesta must have
been edited, was Pahlavi, which is not derived from Zend, but from
ancient Persian, being the middle dialect between ancient and modern
Persian. Therefore, if the Sassanian kings had conceived the project of
having religious books of their own written and composed, it is not
likely that they would have had them written in an old foreign dialect,
but in the old national language, the more so, because, owing both to
their origin and their policy, they were bound to be the representatives
of the genuine old Persian tradition. Therefore, if they adopted Zend as
the language of religion, it must have been because it was already so
when they appeared, that is to say, because the only remnants of sacred
literature then extant were written in Zend, and the editors of the
Avesta had Zend writings before them.

This does not, of course, prove that all we find in the Avesta is
pre-Sassanian, and that the editors did not compose new Zend texts.
Although Zend was not only a dead language, but also a foreign one, it
was. not an unknown language: that it was well understood by the learned
class, the priests, appears from the Pahlavi translation, which was made
by them, and which, the deeper

<span id="page_xxxvii">p. xxxvii</span>

one enters into the meaning of the text, has the fuller justice done to
its merits. The earliest date that can be ascribed to that translation,
in its present form, is the last century of the Sassanian dynasty, as it
contains an allusion to the death of the heresiarch Mazdak, the son of
Bâmdâd <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md), who was put to death in the
beginning of the reign of Khosrav Anôsharvân (about 531). Now the
ability to translate a dead language is a good test of the ability to
write in it, and in the question of the age of the Zend texts the
possibility of new ones having been composed by the editors cannot be
excluded à priori. Nay, we shall see further on that there are passages
in these texts which look very modern, and may have been written at the
time when the book took its last and definitive form. But whatever may
be the proportion of the new texts to the old ones (which I believe to
be very small), it is quite certain that the bulk of the Avesta is
pre-Sassanian.

§ 9. The date assigned by the Dînkar*t* to the final edition of the
Avesta and to its promulgation as the sacred law of the nation, agrees
with what we know of the religious state of Iran in the times of Shapûr
II. Mazdeism had just been threatened with destruction by a new religion
sprung from itself, the religion of Mânî, which for a while numbered a
king amongst its followers (Shapûr I, 240-270). Mazdeism was shaken for
a long time, and when Mânî was put to death, his work did not perish
with him. In the Kissah-i San*g*âh, Zoroaster is introduced prophesying
that the holy religion will be overthrown three times and restored three
times; overthrown the first time by Iskander, it will be restored by
Ardeshîr; overthrown again, it will be restored by, Shapûr II and
Âdarbâd Mahraspand; and, lastly, it will be overthrown by the Arabs and
restored at the end of time by Soshyos. The Parsi traditions about
Âdarbâd, although they are mixed with much fable, allow some historical
truth to show itself. He was a holy man under Shapûr II, who, as there
were many religions and heresies in Iran and the true religion

<span id="page_xxxviii">p. xxxviii</span>

was falling into oblivion, restored it through a miracle, as he gave a
sign of its truth by allowing melted brass to be poured on his breast,
without his being injured. Setting aside the miracle, which is most
probably borrowed from the legend of Zoroaster, this account receives
its true interpretation from the passages in the Kissah-i San*g*âh and
the Dînkar*t*, which imply that Âdarbâd restored Mazdeism, which had
been shaken by the Manichean heresy, and that in order to settle it upon
a solid and lasting base, he gave a definitive form to the religious
book of Iran and closed the Holy Writ. And even nowadays the Parsi,
while reciting the Patet, acknowledges Âdarbâd as the third founder of
the Avesta; the first being Zoroaster, who received it from Ormazd; the
second *G*âmâsp, who received it from Zoroaster; and the third Âdarbâd,
who taught it and restored it to its purity.

Therefore, so far as we can trust to inferences that rest upon such
scanty and vague testimonies, it seems likely that the Avesta took its
definitive form from the hands of Âdarbâd Mahraspand, under King Shapûr
II, in consequence of the dangers with which Mânî's heresy had
threatened the national religion. As the death of Mânî and the first
persecution of his followers took place some thirty years before
Shapûr's accession to the throne, it may be presumed that the last
revision of the Avesta was made in the first years of the new reign,
when the agitation aroused by Mânî's doctrines and imperfectly allayed
by the persecution of his disciples had not yet subsided, and the old
religion was still shaking on its base <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md).

§ 10. It follows hence that Zend texts may have been composed even as
late as the fourth century A.D. This is, of course, a mere theoretical
possibility, for although the liturgical parts of the Yasna, the
Vispêrad, the Sîrôzah, and

<span id="page_xxxix">p. xxxix</span>

the Khorda Avesta must be ascribed to a later time than the Gâthas, the
Vendîdâd, and the Ya*s*ts, and may belong to some period of revision,
they certainly do not belong to the period of this last revision.
Âdarbâd was only the last editor of the Avesta, and it is likely, nay,
it is beyond all question, that the doctors of the law, before his time,
had tried to put the fragments in order, to connect them, and to fill up
the gaps as far as the practical purposes of liturgy required it.
Therefore instead of saying that there are parts of the Avesta that may
belong to so late a period as the fourth century, it is more correct to
say that no part of it can belong to a later date.

There are two passages in the Vendîdâd which seem to contain internal
evidence of their date, and in both cases it points to Sassanian times,
nay, the second of them points to the age of Manicheism. The first is
found in the eighteenth Fargard (§ 10): Ahura Mazda, while cursing those
who teach a wrong law, exclaims:

'And he who would set that man at liberty, when bound in prison, does no
better deed than if he should flay a man alive and cut off his head.'

This anathema indicates a time when Mazdeism was a state religion and
had to fight against heresy; it must, therefore, belong to Sassanian
times. These lines are fully illustrated by a Parsi book of the same
period <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md), the Mainyô-i-Khard:

'Good government is that which maintains and orders the true law and
custom of the city people and poor untroubled, and thrusts out improper
law and custom; . . . and keeps in progress the worship of God, and
duties, and good works; . . . and will resign the body, and that also
which is its own life, for the sake of the good religion of the
Mazdayasnians. And if there he any one who shall stay away from the way
of God, then it orders him to return thereto, and makes him a prisoner,
and brings him back to the way of God; and will bestow, from the wealth
that is his, the share of God, and the worthy, and good works,

<span id="page_xl">p. xl</span>

and the poor; and will deliver up the body on account of the soul. A
good king who is of that sort, is called like the Yazads and the
Ameshâspeñds <span id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md).'

What doctrines are alluded to by the Vendîdâd is not explained: it
appears from the context that it had in view such sects as released the
faithful from the yoke of religious practices, as it anathematizes, at
the same time, those who have continued for three years without wearing
the sacred girdle. We know too little of the Manichean liturgy to guess
if the Manicheans are here alluded to: that Mânî should have rejected
many Zoroastrian practices is not unlikely, as his aim was to found a
universal religion. While he pushed to extremes several of the
Zoroastrian tenets, especially those which had taken, or might receive,
a moral or metaphysical meaning, he must have been very regardless of
practices which could not be ennobled into moral symbolism. However it
may be with regard to the foregoing passage, it is difficult not to see
a direct allusion to Manicheism in lines like the following (IV, 47
seq.):

‘Verily I say it unto thee, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! the man who has a
wife is far above him who begets no sons; he who keeps a house is far
above him who has none; he who has children is far above the childless
man, he who has riches is far above him who has none.

‘And of two men, he who fills himself with meat is filled with the good
spirit much more than he who does not so; the latter is all but dead;
the former is above him by the worth of an Asperena, by the worth of a
sheep, by the worth of an ox, by the worth of a man.

'It is this man that can strive against the onsets of Astôvîdhôtu; that
can strive against the self-moving arrow; that can strive against the
winter fiend, with thinnest garment on; that can strive against the
wicked tyrant and smite him on the head; it is this man that can strive
against the ungodly Ashemaogha <span id="fr_55"></span>[2](#fn_55.md) who
does not eat <span id="fr_56"></span>[3](#fn_56.md).'

<span id="page_xli">p. xli</span>

That this is a bit of religious polemics, and that it refers to definite
doctrines and tenets which were held at the time when it was written,
can hardly be doubted. It may remind one of the Christian doctrines;
and, in fact, it was nearly in the same tone, and with the same
expressions, that in the fifth century King Yazdgard branded the
Christians in Armenia <span id="fr_57"></span>[4](#fn_57.md). But however
eager the Christian propaganda may have been for a time in Persia, they
never endangered the state religion. The real enemy was the heresy
sprung from Mazdeism itself; and Christianity, coming from abroad, was
more of a political than a religious foe. And, in point of fact, the
description in the above passage agrees better with the Manichean
doctrines than with the Christian <span id="fr_58"></span>[5](#fn_58.md).
Like Mânî, Christian teachers held the single life holier than the state
of matrimony, yet they had not forbidden marriage, which Mânî did; they
put poor Lazarus above Dives, but they never forbade trade and
husbandry, which Mânî did; and, lastly, they never prohibited the eating
of flesh, which was one of the chief precepts of Mânî <span
id="fr_59"></span>[6](#fn_59.md). We find, therefore, in this passage, an
illustration, from the Avesta itself, of the celebrated doctrine of the
three seals with which Mânî had sealed the bosom, the hand, and the
mouth of his disciples (signaculum sinus, manus, oris) <span
id="fr_60"></span>[6](#fn_59.md).}

<span id="page_xlii">p. xlii</span>

§ 11. We must now go a step farther back, and try to solve the question
whence came the original texts out of which the editors of the Avesta
formed their collection. Setting aside the Dînkar*t*, we have no
oriental document to help us in tracing them through the age of the
Arsacides, a complete historical desert, and we are driven for
information to the classical writers who are, on this point, neither
very clear nor always credible. The mention of books ascribed to
Zoroaster occurs not seldom during that period, but very often it
applies to Alexandrian and Gnostic apocrypha <span
id="fr_61"></span>[1](#fn_60.md). Yet there are a few passages which make
it pretty certain that there was a Mazdean literature in existence in
those times. Pausanias, travelling through Lydia in the second century
of our era, saw and heard Magian priests singing hymns from a book <span
id="fr_62"></span>[2](#fn_61.md); whether these hymns were the same as the
Gâthas, still extant, we cannot ascertain, but this shows that there
were Gâthas. The existence of a Zoroastrian literature might be traced
back as far as the third century before Christ, if Pliny could be
credited when he says that Hermippus <span id="fr_63"></span>[3](#fn_62.md)
had given an analysis of the books of Zoroaster, which are said to have
amounted to 2,000,000 lines <span id="fr_64"></span>[4](#fn_63.md). For
want of external evidence for ascertaining whether the original texts
were already in existence in the later years of the Achæmenian dynasty,
we must seek for internal evidence. A comparison between the ideas
expressed in our texts and what we know of the ideas of Achæmenian
Persia may perhaps lead to safer inferences.

§ 12. That all the Avesta ideas were already fully developed in the
time, or, at least, at the end of the

<span id="page_xliii">p. xliii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Achæmenian
dynasty, appears from the perfect accordance of the account of Mazdeism
in Theopompos <span id="fr_65"></span>[1](#fn_64.md) with the data of the
Zend books. All the main features of Mazdean belief, namely, the
existence of two principles, a good and an evil one, Ormazd and Ahriman,
the antithetical creations of the two supreme powers, the division of
all the beings in nature into two corresponding classes, the limited
duration of the world, the end of the struggle between Ormazd and
Ahriman by the defeat and destruction of the evil principle, the
resurrection of the dead, and the everlasting life, all these tenets of
the Avesta had already been established at the time of Philip and
Aristotle. Therefore we must admit that the religious literature then in
existence, if there were any, must have differed but little, so far as
its contents were concerned, from the Avesta; its extent was greater of
course, and we have a proof of this in this very account of Theopompos,
which gives us details nowhere to be found in the present texts, and yet
the authenticity of which is made quite certain by comparative
mythology <span id="fr_66"></span>[2](#fn_65.md). Therefore there is
nothing that forbids us to believe, with the Parsis, that the fragments
of which the Avesta is composed were already in existence before the
Greek invasion <span id="fr_67"></span>[3](#fn_66.md).

§ 13. But it does not follow hence that the Achæmenian Avesta was the
sacred book of the Achæmenians and of Persia, and it must not be
forgotten that the account in Plutarch is not about the religion of
Persia, but about the belief of the Magi and the lore of Zoroaster. Now
if we consider that the two characteristic features of Avestean Magism
are, so far as belief goes, the admission of two principles, and so far
as practice is concerned, the prohibition of burying the dead, we find
that there is no evidence

<span id="page_xliv">p. xliv</span>

that Achæmenian Persia admitted the former, and there is evidence that
she did not admit the latter. But, at the same time, it appears that
both the belief and the practice were already in existence, though
peculiar to one class, the sacerdotal class, the Magi.

The question whether the Achæmenian kings believed in dualism and knew
of Ahriman, is not yet settled. Much stress has often been laid on the
absence of the name of Ahriman in the religious formulae engraved by
Darius and Xerxes on the rocks at Persepolis and Naq*s*-i Rustam <span
id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_67.md). But it is never safe to draw wide
conclusions from negative facts: Darius and Xerxes speak of Aurâmazda
quite in the style of the Avesta, and their not speaking of Ahriman is
no sufficient proof of their not knowing him; they did not intend to
publish a complete creed, nor had they to inscribe articles of faith.

The account of the Persian religion in Herodotus also leaves, or seems
to leave, Ahriman unnoticed. But it must be borne in mind that he does
not expound the religious conceptions of the Persians, but only their
religious customs; he describes their worship more than their dogmas,
and not a single tenet is mentioned. He seems even not to know anything
of Ormazd, who was, however, most certainly the most supreme god of
Persia in his days; yet, in fact, he clearly alludes to Ormazd when he
states that the Persians worship Zeus on the summits of mountains, and
call by the name of Zeus the whole circle of the heavens, which exactly
agrees with the character of Ormazd <span id="fr_69"></span>[2](#fn_68.md).
In the same way the existence of Ahriman is indirectly pointed to by the
duty enforced upon the faithful to persecute and kill noxious animals,
as it was only on account of

<span id="page_xlv">p. xlv</span>

their being creatures of the evil principle and incarnations if of it,
that this custom was enjoined as a religious duty <span
id="fr_70"></span>[1](#fn_69.md). It appears, it is true, from the words of
Herodotus, that it was only a custom peculiar to the Magi <span
id="fr_71"></span>[2](#fn_70.md); but is shows, at least, that the belief
in Ahriman was already then in existence, and that dualism was
constituted, at least, as a Magian article of faith.

If we pass now from dogma to practice, we find that the most important
practice of the Avesta law was either disregarded by the Achæmenian
kings, or unknown to them. According to the Avesta burying corpses in
the earth is one of the most heinous sins that can be committed <span
id="fr_72"></span>[3](#fn_71.md); we know that under the Sassanians a prime
minister, Seoses, paid with his life for an infraction of that law <span
id="fr_73"></span>[4](#fn_72.md). Corpses were to be laid down on the
summits of mountains, there to be devoured by birds and dogs; the
exposure of corpses, was the most striking practice of Mazdean
profession, and its adoption was the sign of conversion <span
id="fr_74"></span>[5](#fn_73.md). Now under the Achæmenian rule, not only
the burial of the dead was not forbidden, but it was the general
practice. Persians, says Herodotus, bury their dead in the earth, after
having coated them with wax <span id="fr_75"></span>[6](#fn_74.md). But
Herodotus, immediately after stating that the Persians inter their dead,
adds that the Magi do not follow the general practice, but lay the
corpses down on the ground, to be devoured by birds. So what became a
law for all people, whether laymen or priests, under the rule of the
Sassanians, was only the custom of the Achæmenians.

The obvious conclusion is that the ideas and customs which are found in
the Avesta were already in existence under the Achæmenian kings; but
that taken as a whole, they were not the general ideas and customs of
the whole of Persia, but only of the sacerdotal caste <span
id="fr_76"></span>[7](#fn_75.md). There were

<span id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span>

therefore, practically, two religions in Iran, the one for laymen and
the other for priests. The Avesta was originally the sacred book only of
the Magi, and the progress of the religious evolution was to extend to
laymen what was the custom of the priests.

§ 14. We are now able to understand how it was that the sacred book of
Persia was written in a non-Persian dialect: it had been written in the
language of its composers, the Magi, who were not Persians. Between the
priests and the people there was not only a difference of calling, but
also a difference of race, as the sacerdotal caste came from a
non-Persian province. What that province was we know both from Greek
historians and from Parsi traditions.

All classical writers, from Herodotus down to Ammianus, agree in
pointing to Media as the seat and native place of the Magi. 'In Media,'
says Marcellinus (XXIII, 6), 'are the fertile fields of the Magi . . .
(having been taught in the magic science by King Hystaspes) they handed
it down to their posterity, and thus from Hystaspes to the present age
an immense family was developed, hereditarily devoted to the worship of
the gods. . . . In former times their number was very scanty . . ., but
they grew up by and by into the number and name of a nation, and
inhabiting towns without walls they were allowed to live according to
their own laws, protected by religious awe.' Putting aside the legendary
account of their origin, one sees from this passage that in the time of
Marcellinus <span id="fr_77"></span>[1](#fn_76) (fourth cent. A.D..md)
there was in Media a tribe, called Magi, which had the hereditary
privilege of providing Iran with priests. Strabo, writing three
centuries before Marcellinus, considered the Magi as a sacerdotal tribe
spread over the land <span id="fr_78"></span>[2](#fn_77.md) . Lastly, we
see in Herodotus (III, 65) that the usurpation of the Magian Smerdis was
interpreted

<span id="page_xlvii">p. xlvii</span>

by Cambyses, as an attempt of the Medes to recover the hegemony they had
lost, and when we learn from Herodotus (I, 101) that the Medes were
divided into several tribes, Busae, Paraetakeni, Strouchates, Arizanti,
Budii, and Magi, without his making any remark on the last name, we can
hardly have any doubt that the priests known as Magi belonged to the
tribe of the Magi, that they were named after their origin, and that the
account of Marcellinus may be correct even for so early a period as that
of Herodotus.

§ 15. Parsi traditions agree with Greek testimonies.

That the priesthood was hereditary, we see from the statement in the
Bundahi*s*, that all the Maubeds are descendants from King
Minochihr <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_78.md), and even nowadays the
priesthood cannot extend beyond the priestly families; the son of a
Dastur is not obliged to be a Dastur, but no one that is not the son of
a Dastur can become one <span id="fr_80"></span>[2](#fn_79.md).

That they came from Media, we see from the traditions about the native
place of Zoroaster, their chief and the founder of their religion.
Although epic legends place the cradle of Mazdean power in Bactria, at
the court of King Vi*s*tâsp, Bactria was only the first conquest of
Zoroaster, it was neither his native place, nor the cradle of his
religion. Although there are two different traditions on this point,
both agree in pointing to Media; according to the one be was born in
Rai, that is in Media, properly so called; according to the other he was
born in Shîz, that is in Media Atropatene.

The former tradition seems to be the older; it is expressed directly in
the Pahlavi Commentary to Vendîdâd I, 16 <span
id="fr_81"></span>[3](#fn_80.md); and there is in the Avesta itself (Yasna
XIX, 18 (50)) a passage that either alludes to it or shows how it
originated.

'How many masters are there?'

<span id="page_xlviii">p. xlviii</span>

'There are the master of the house, the lord of the borough, the lord of
the town, the lord of the province, and the Zarathu*s*tra (the
high-priest) as the fifth. So is it in all lands, except in the
Zarathu*s*trian realm; for there are there only four masters, in Ragha,
the Zarathu*s*trian city <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_81.md).'

'Who are they?'

'They are the master of the house, the lord of the borough, the lord of
the town, and Zarathu*s*tra is the fourth <span
id="fr_83"></span>[2](#fn_82.md).'

This amounts to saying that the high-priest, the Maubedân Maubed, held
in Rai the position of the da*hv*yuma, or lord of the land, and was the
chief magistrate. It may be suspected that this was the independent
sacerdotal state which is spoken of in Marcellinus, and this suspicion
is raised to a certain degree of probability by the following lines in
Yaqût:

'Ustûnâwand, a celebrated fortress in the district of Danbawand, in the
province of Rai. It is very old, and was strongly fortified. It is said
to have been in existence more than 3000 years, and to have been the
stronghold of the Masmoghân of the land during the times of paganism.
This word, which designates the high-priest of Zoroastrian religion, is
composed of mas, "great," and moghân, which means "magian." Khaled
besieged it, and the power of the last of them <span
id="fr_84"></span>[3](#fn_83.md).'

According to another tradition Zarathu*s*tra was born in Atropatene. The
very same commentary which describes Ragha as being identical with Rai,
and the native place of Zartu*s*t, also informs us that Ragha was
brought by others

<span id="page_xlix">p. xlix</span>

to be Atropatene. Traditions, of which unfortunately we have only late
records, make him a native of Shîz, the capital of Atropatene <span
id="fr_85"></span>[1](#fn_84.md): 'In Shîz is the fire temple of Azerekhsh,
the most celebrated of the Pyraea of the Magi; in the days of the fire
worship, the kings always came on foot, upon pilgrimage. The temple of
Azerekhsh is ascribed to Zeratusht, the founder of the Magian religion,
who went, it is said, from Shîz to the mountain of Sebîlân, and, after
remaining there some time in retirement, returned with the Zend-Avesta,
which, although written in the old Persian language, could not be
understood without a commentary. After this he declared himself to be a
prophet <span id="fr_86"></span>[2](#fn_85.md).'

Now we read in the Bundahi*s* that Zartu*s*t founded his religion by
offering a sacrifice in Irân Vê*g* (Airyanem Vaê*g*ô) <span
id="fr_87"></span>[3](#fn_86.md). Although this detail referred originally
to the mythical character of Zoroaster, and Irân Vê*g* was primitively
no real country, yet as it was afterwards identified with the basin of
the Aras (Vanguhi Dâitya) <span id="fr_88"></span>[4](#fn_87.md), this
identification is a proof that the cradle of the new religion was looked
for on the banks of the Aras. In the Avesta itself we read that
Zoroaster was born and received the law from Ormazd on a mountain, by
the river Dare*g*a <span id="fr_89"></span>[5](#fn_88.md), a name which
strikingly reminds one of the modern Darah river, which falls from the
Sebîlân mount into the Aras.

To decide which of the two places, Rai or Atropatene, had the better
claim to be called the native place of Zoroaster is of course
impossible. The conflict of the two traditions must be interpreted as an
indication that both places were important seats of the Magian worship.
That both traditions may rely on the Avesta is perhaps a sign that the
Avesta contains two series of documents, the one emanating from the Magi
of Ragha, and the other from the

<span id="page_l">p. l</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Magi of
Atropatene <span id="fr_90"></span>[1](#fn_89.md). Which of the two places
had the older claim is also a question hardly to be settled in the
present state of our knowledge <span id="fr_91"></span>[2](#fn_90.md).

Whether Magism came from Ragha to Atropatene, or from Atropatene to
Ragha, in either case it had its origin in Media <span
id="fr_92"></span>[3](#fn_91.md). That Persia should have submitted in
religious matters to a foreign tribe will surprise no one who thinks of
the influence of the Etruscan augurs in Rome. The Magi might be hated as
Medes, but they were respected and feared as priests. When political
revolutions gave vent to national hate, the Persian might willingly
indulge it, and revel in the blood of the foreign priest <span
id="fr_93"></span>[4](#fn_92.md); yet whenever he had to invoke the favour
of the gods, he was obliged to acknowledge that he could not do without
the detested tribe, and that they alone knew how to make themselves
beard by heaven <span id="fr_94"></span>[5](#fn_93.md). When and how the
religious hegemony of Media arose we cannot say: it is but natural that
Media <span id="fr_95"></span>[6](#fn_94.md),

<span id="page_li">p. li</span>

having risen sooner to a high degree of civilisation, should have given
to religion and worship a more systematic and elaborate form, and in
religion, as in politics, the best organised power must sooner or later
get the upper hand. It is likely that it began with the conquest of
Media by Cyrus: Media capta ferum victorem cepit. . . . Cyrus is said to
have introduced the Magian priesthood into Persia (Xenophon, Cyrop.
VIII, I, 23), which agrees with the legend mentioned by Nikolaus that it
was on the occasion of the miraculous escape of Crœsus that the Persians
remembered the old λογία of Zoroaster forbidding the dead to be burnt.

The Medic origin of the Magi accounts for a fact which perplexes at
first sight, namely, the absence of the name of the Magi from the book
written by themselves <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_95.md); which is
natural enough if the word Magu was not the name of the priest as a
priest, but as a member of the tribe of the Magi. The proper word for a
priest in the Avesta is Âthravan, literally, 'fire-man,' and that this
was his name with the Persians too appears from the statement in Strabo
(XV, 733) that the Magi are also called Πύραιθοι. It is easy to conceive
that the Persians, especially in ordinary parlance, would rather
designate their priests after their origin than after their
functions <span id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_96.md); but the Magi themselves
had no reason to follow the Persian custom, which was not always free
from an implication of spite or scorn. The only passage into which the
word found its way is just one that betrays the existence of this
feeling: the enemy of the priests is

<span id="page_lii">p. lii</span>

not called, as would be expected, an Âthrava-*t*bi*s*, 'a hater of the
Âthravans' (cf. the Indian Brahma-dvish), but a Moghu-*t*bi*s*, 'a hater
of the Magi <span id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_97.md).' The name, it is true,
became current in Pahlavi and modern Persian, but it was at a time when
the old national quarrels between Media and Persia were quenched, and
the word could no longer carry any offensive idea with it.

§ 16. The results of the foregoing research may be summed up as
follows:--

The original texts of the Avesta were not written by Persians, as they
are in a language which was not used in Persia, they prescribe certain
customs which were unknown to Persia, and proscribe others which were
current in Persia. They were written in Media, by the priests of Ragha
and Atropatene, in the language of Media, and they exhibit the ideas of
the sacerdotal class under the Achæmenian dynasty.

It does not necessarily follow from this, that the original fragments
were already written at the time of Herodotus <span
id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_98.md).

<span id="page_liii">p. liii</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But as the Magi of
that time sang songs of their gods during sacrifice, it is very likely
that there was already a sacred literature in existence. The very fact
that no sacrifice could be performed without the assistance of the Magi
makes it highly probable that they were in possession of rites, prayers,
and hymns very well composed and arranged, and not unlike those of the
Brahmans; their authority can only be accounted for by the power of a
strongly defined ritual and liturgy. There must, therefore, have been a
collection of formulae and hymns, and it is quite possible that
Herodotus may have heard the Magi sing, in the fifth century B.C., the
very same Gâthas which are sung nowadays by the Mobeds in Bombay. A part
of the Avesta, the liturgical part, would therefore have been, in fact,
a sacred book for the Persians. It had not been written by them, but it
was sung for their benefit. That Zend hymns should have been sung before
a Persian-speaking people is not stranger than Latin words being sung by
Frenchmen, Germans, and Italians; the only difference being that, owing
to the close affinity of Zend to Persian, the Persians may have been
able to understand the prayers of their priests.

§ 17. It may, therefore, be fairly admitted that, on the whole, the
present texts are derived from texts already existing under the
Achæmenian kings. Some parts of the collection are undoubtedly older
than others; thus, the Gâthas are certainly older than the rest of the
Avesta, as they are often quoted and praised in the Yasna and the
Vendîdâd; but it is scarcely possibly to go farther than a logical
chronology. One might feel inclined, at first sight, to assign to a very
recent date, perhaps to the last revision of the Avesta, those long
enumerations of gods so symmetrically elaborated in the Yasna, Vispêrad,
and Vendîdâd. But the Account of Mazdeism given by Plutarch shows that
the

<span id="page_liv">p. liv</span>

work of co-ordination was already terminated at the end of the
Achæmenian period, and there is no part of the Avesta which, so far as
the matter is concerned, may not have been written in those times. Nay,
the Greek accounts of that period present us, in some measure, with a
later stage of thought, and are pervaded with a stronger sense of
symmetry, than the Avesta itself. Such passages as the latter end of the
Zamyâd Ya*s*t and Vendîdâd X, 9 seq. prove that, when they were
composed, the seven Arch-Dêvs were not yet pointedly contrasted with the
seven Amshaspands, and therefore those passages might have been written
long before the time of Philip. The theory of time and space as first
principles of the world, of which only the germs are found in the
Avesta, was fully developed in the time of Eudemos, a disciple of
Aristotle.

§ 18. To what extent the Magian dogmatical conceptions were admitted by
the whole of the Iranian population, or how and by what process they
spread among it, we cannot ascertain for want of documentary evidence.
As regards their observances we are better instructed, and can form an
idea of how far and in what particulars they differed from the other
Iranians. The new principle they introduced, or, rather, developed into
new consequences, was that of the purity of the elements. Fire, earth,
and water had always been considered sacred things, and had received
worship <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_99.md): the Magi drew from that
principle the conclusion that burying the dead or burning the dead was
defiling a god: as early as Herodotus they had already succeeded in
preserving fire from that pollution, and cremation was a capital crime.
The earth still continued to be defiled, notwithstanding the example
they set; and it was only under the Sassanians, when Mazdeism became the
religion of the state, that they won this point also.

The religious difference between the Persians and their Medic priests
was therefore chiefly in observances. Out of the principles upon which
the popular religion rested, the sacerdotal class drew by dint of logic,
in a puritan spirit,

<span id="page_lv">p. lv</span>

the necessity of strict observances, the yoke of which was not willingly
endured by the mass of the people. Many acts, insignificant in the eyes
of the people, became repugnant to their consciences and their more
refined logic. The people resisted, and for a time Magian observances
were observed only by the Magi. The slow triumph of Magism can be dimly
traced through the Achæmenian period. Introduced by Cyrus, it reigned
supreme for a time with the Pseudo-Smerdis, and was checked by
Darius <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_100.md). It seems to have resumed
its progress under Xerxes; at least, it was reported that it was to
carry out Magian principles that he destroyed the Greek temples, and
that the first who wrote on the Zoroastrian lore was a Magian, named
Osthanes, who had accompanied him to Greece <span
id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_101.md). New progress marked the reign of
Artaxerxes Longimanus. The epic history of Iran, as preserved in the
Shah Nâmah, passes suddenly from the field of mythology to that of
history with the reign of that king, which makes it likely that it was
in his time that the legends of Media became national in Persia, and
that his reign was an epoch in the political history of Magism <span
id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_102.md). But the real victory was not won till
six centuries later, when national interest required a national
religion. Then, as happens in every revolution, the ultra party, that
had pushed to the extreme the principles common to all, took the lead;
the Magi ascended the throne with Ardeshîr, one of their pupils <span
id="fr_104"></span>[4](#fn_103.md), and the Magian

<span id="page_lvi">p. lvi</span>

observances became the law of all Iran. But their triumph was not to be
a long one; their principles required an effort too continuous and too
severe to be ever made by any but priests, who might concentrate all
their faculties in watching whether they had not dropped a hair upon the
ground. A working people could not be imprisoned in such a religion,
though it might be pure and high in its ethics. The triumph of Islam was
a deliverance for the consciences of many <span
id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_104.md), and Magism, by enforcing its
observances upon the nation, brought about the ruin of its dogmas, which
were swept away at the same time: its triumph was the cause and signal
of its fall <span id="fr_106"></span>[2](#fn_105.md).

<span id="fn_34"></span>[xxx:1](sbe0404.htm#fr_34.md) A very improper
designation, as Zend means 'a commentary or explanation,' and was
applied only to explanatory texts, to the translations of the Avesta.
Avesta (from the old Persian âbastâ, 'the law;' see Oppert, Journal
Asiatique, 1872, Mars) is the proper name of the original texts. What it
is customary to call, 'the Zend language' ought to be named, 'the Avesta
language;' the Zend being no language at all; and, if the word be used
as the designation of one, it can be rightly applied only to the
Pahlavi. The expression 'Avesta and Zend' is often used in the Pahlavi
commentary to designate 'the law with its traditional and revealed
explanation.'

character qualifies him for taking the initiative in a religious work.
He seems to have been a man of contemplative mind rather than a man of
action, which often excited the anger or scorn of his people against
him; and he had the glory of breaking with the family policy of Parthian
kings (Tacitus, Annales, XV, 1, 2). It was under his reign that the

Persia speaks, took place, as he was called by the people of Adiabene

orthodox Christianity, which seems to have alone prevailed in Persia
till the arrival of the Nestorians. The description would apply very
well to certain gnostic sects, especially that of Cerdo and Marcio,
which is no wonder as it was through that channel that Christianity
became known to Mânî. Masudi makes Mânî a disciple of Kardûn (ed. B. de
Meynard, II, 167), and the care which his biographer (ap. Flügel, Mânî,
pp. 51, 85) takes to determine the length of time which intervened
between Marcio and Mânî seems to betray some dim recollection of an
historical connection between the two doctrines.

eternal life, Haoma, has no shadow (Henry Lord).

<span id="fn_66"></span>[xliii:3](sbe0404.htm#fr_67.md) Persian tradition
cannot be much relied on, when it tries to go back beyond Alexander, and
on that special point it seems to be more an inference of later ages,

<span id="fn_67"></span>[xliv:1](sbe0404.htm#fr_68.md) Professor Oppert
thinks he has found in Darius' inscriptions an express mention of
Ahriman (Le peuple et le langue des Mèdes, p. 199); yet the philological
interpretation of the passage seems to me still to obscure to allow of
any decisive opinion. Plutarch introduces Artaxerxes I speaking of
Ἀρειμάνιος, but whether the king is made to speak the language of his
own time, or that of Plutarch's time, is left doubtful. As to the
allusions in Isaiah (xlv), they do not necessarily refer to dualism in
particular, but to all religions not monotheistic. (Cf. Ormazd et
Ahriman, §241.)

features of the Avesta religion which appear to have been foreign to
Persia, but are attributed to the Magi. The *hv*aêtvôdatha, the holiness
of marriage between next of kin, even to incest, was unknown to <span
id="page_xlvi">p. xlvi</span> Persia under Cambyses (Herod. III, 31),
but it is highly praised in the Avesta, and was practised under the
Sassanians (Agathias II, 31); in the times before the Sassanians it is

<span id="fn_89"></span>[l:1](sbe0404.htm#fr_90.md) This would be a
principle of classification which unfortunately applies only to a small
part of the Avesta.

<span id="fn_90"></span>[l:2](sbe0404.htm#fr_91.md) Still, if we follow the
direction of the Zoroastrian legend, Magism must have spread from west
to east, from Atropatene to Ragha, from Ragha to Bactria; and Atropatene
must thus have been the first cradle of Mazdeism. Its very name points
to its sacred character; oriental writers, starting from the modern form
of the name, Adarbî*g*ân, interpret it as 'the seed of fire,' with an
allusion to the numerous fire springs to be found there. Modern scholars
have generally followed the historical etymology given by Strabo, who
states that, after the death of Alexander, the satrap Atropates made
himself an independent sovereign in his satrapy, which was named after
him Atropatene. This looks like a Greek etymology (scarcely more to be
trusted than the etymology of Ῥαγαί, from ῥήγνυμι), and it is hardly to
be believed that the land should have lost its former name to take a new
one from its king; it was not a new-fangled geographical division, like
Lotharingia, and had lived a life of its own for a long time before. Its
name Âtarpatakân seems to mean 'the land of the descent of fire,' as it
was there that fire came down front heaven (cf. Ammianus l.c.)

<span id="fn_91"></span>[l:3](sbe0404.htm#fr_92.md) The Pahlavi names of
the cardinal points show that Media was the centre of orientation in
Magian geography (Garrez, Journal Asiatique, 1869, II).

<span id="fn_94"></span>[l:6](sbe0404.htm#fr_95.md) An echo of the old
political history of Media seems to linger in Ya*s*t V, 29, which shows
Azi Dahâka reigning in Babylon (Bawru); as Azi, in his legendary
character, represents the foreign invader, this passage can hardly be
anything but a far remote echo of the struggles between Media and the
Mesopotamian empires. The legend of Azi is localised only in Medic <span
id="page_li">p. li</span> lands: he addresses his prayers to Ahriman by
the banks of the Sipît rût (Bundahi*s* 52, 11), his adversary Ferîdûn is
born in Ghilân, he is bound to Mount Damâvand (near Rai).

<span id="fn_95"></span>[li:1](sbe0404.htm#fr_96.md) In their own language,
the Zend; of which the modern representatives, if there be any left,
should therefore be looked for in Atropatene or on the banks of the
Caspian sea. The research is complicated by the growing intrusion of
Persian words into the modern dialects, but as far as I can see from a
very inadequate study of the matter, the dialect which exhibits most
Zend features is the Tali*s* dialect, on the southern bank of the Aras.

<span id="fn_96"></span>[li:2](sbe0404.htm#fr_97.md) The Pahlavi has 'one
who hates the Magu-men.' In the passage LIII (LII), 7, magéus is not a
Magian, and it is translated by magi, 'holiness, godliness,' related to
the Vedic magha. Afterwards the two words were confounded, whence came
the Greek statement that μάγος means at the same time 'a priest' and 'a
god' (Apollon. Tyan. Ep. XVII).

<span id="fn_97"></span>[lii:1](sbe0404.htm#fr_98.md) A further echo of the
anti-Magian feelings may be heard in Yasna IX, 24 (75): 'Haoma overthrew
Keresâni, who rose up to seize royalty, and he said, "No longer shall
henceforth the Âthravans go through the lands and teach at their will."'
This is a curious instance of how easily legendary history may turn
myths to its advantage, The struggle of Haoma against Keresâni is an old
Indo-European myth, Keresâni being the same as the Vedic K*ri*sânu, who
wants to keep away Soma from the hands of men. His name becomes in the
Avesta the name of an anti-Magian king it may be Darius, the usurper
(?), and ten centuries later it was turned into an appellation of the
Christian Kaisars of Rûm (Kalasyâk = \*ἐκκλησια\[κός\]; Tarsâka).

<span id="fn_98"></span>[lii:2](sbe0404.htm#fr_99.md) If the interpretation
of the end of the Behistun inscription (preserved only in the Scythian
version) as given by Professor Oppert be correct, Darius must have made
a collection of religious texts known as Avesta, whence it would follow,
with great probability, that the present Avesta proceeded from Darius.
The translation of the celebrated scholar is as follows: 'J’ai fait une
collection de textes (dippimas) ailleurs en langue arienne qui autrefois
n’existait pas. Et j’ai fait un texte de la Loi (de l’Avesta; Haduk
ukku) et un commentaire de la Loi, et la Bénédiction (la prière, le
Zend) et les Traductions.' (Le peuple et la langue des Mèdes, pp. 155,
186.) The authority of Oppert is so great, and at the same time the
passage is so obscure, that I hardly know if there be more temerity in
rejecting his interpretation or in adopting it. Yet I beg to observe
that the word dippimas is the usual Scythian transliteration of the
Persian dipi, 'an inscription,' and there is no apparent reason for
departing from that meaning in this passage; if the word translated 'la
Loi,' ukku really represents here a Persian word Aba*s*ta, it need not
denote the Avesta, the religious book, <span id="page_liii">p.
liii</span> as in that case the word would most certainly not have been
translated in the Scythian version, but only transliterated; the
ideogram for 'Bénédiction, prière,' may refer to religious inscriptions
like Persepolis I; the import of the whole passage would therefore be
that Darius caused other inscriptions to be engraved, and wrote other
edicts and religious formulae (the word, 'traductions' is only a guess).

<span id="fn_100"></span>[lv:1](sbe0404.htm#fr_101.md) Darius rebuilt the
temples which the Magus Gaumata had destroyed (Behistun I, 63). The
Magi, it is said, wanted the gods not to be imprisoned within four walls
(Cic. de Legibus II, 10). Xerxes behaved himself as their disciple, at
least in Greece. Still the Magi seem to have at last given way on that
point to the Perso-Assyrian customs, and there were temples even under
the Sassanians.

<span id="fn_102"></span>[lv:3](sbe0404.htm#fr_103.md) Cf. Westergaard,
Preface to the Zend-Avesta, p. 17. This agrees with what we know of the
fondness of Artaxerxes for religious novelties, It was he who blended
the worship of the Assyrian Anat-Mylitta with that of the Iranian
Anâhita (the ascription of that innovation to Artaxerxes Mnemon by
Clemens Alexandrinus (Stromata I) must rest on a clerical error, as in
the time of Herodotus, who wrote under Longimanus, the worship of
Mylitta had already been introduced into Persia (I, 131)).

<span id="fn_105"></span>[lvi:2](sbe0404.htm#fr_106.md) We ought to discuss
here the Scythian theory of Magism; but thus far we have been unable to
find anywhere a clear and consistent account of its thesis and of its
arguments. Nothing is known of any Scythian religion, and what is
ascribed to a so-called Scythian influence, the worship of the elements,
is one of the oldest and most essential features of the Aryan religions.
