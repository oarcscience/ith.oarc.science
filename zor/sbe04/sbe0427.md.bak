18\. \[‘I drive away Ishirê, I drive away Aghûirê, I drive away Aghra, I

away A*z*ana, I drive away A*z*ahva, I drive away Kurugha, I drive away
A*z*ivâka, I drive away Duruka, I drive away Astairya; I drive away the
disease, rottenness, and infection which Angra Mainyu has created by his
witchcraft against the bodies of mortals.

19\. ‘I drive away all manner of diseases and deaths, all the Yâtus and
Pairikas, and all the wicked *G*ainis.

20\. ‘May the much-desired Airyaman come here, for the men and women of
Zarathu*s*tra to rejoice, for the faithful to rejoice; with the

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

that is won by means of the law, and with that boon for holiness that is
vouchsafed by Ahura!

never more to give unto death the living world of the holy spirit!'\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1143"></span>[224:1](sbe0427.htm#fr_1155.md) The primeval bull
who was created by Ormazd and killed by Ahriman with the help of the
*G*ahi. The praise of the holy bull serves as an introduction to the
praise of the waters. There were old myths in which a cloud was compared
to a bull in the atmosphere, from whom rain was supposed to come. (See
Orm. Ahr. § 122 seq.; cf. Introd. V, 5. Clause 1 is to be recited when
one meets an ox or any kind of cattle, Gr. Rav. 386.)

<span id="fn_1144"></span>[224:2](sbe0427.htm#fr_1156.md) Possibly, 'who
dost kill the *G*ahi' (by means of gômêz).

<span id="fn_1145"></span>[224:3](sbe0427.htm#fr_1157.md) The *G*ahi (see
Farg. XX, 10) as bringing sickness (cf. Farg. VII, 59).

<span id="fn_1146"></span>[224:4](sbe0427.htm#fr_1158.md) Names of
diseases.

<span id="fn_1147"></span>[225:1](sbe0427.htm#fr_1159.md) Waters and light
are believed to flow from the same spring and in the same bed: 'As light
rises up from Hara Berezaiti \[Alborz, the mountain by which the earth
is surrounded\], so waters spring up from it and come back to it' (Bund.
XX); every day the sun, moon, and stars rise up from Alborz, and every
day all the waters on the earth come back together to the sea
Vouru-kasha, and there collected come down again to the earth from the
peaks of Alborz (Bund. VII, Gr. Rav. 431; cf. Farg. V, 15 seq.) As light
comes from three different sources, the sun, the moon, and the stars,
the waters are invoked three times, first in company with the sun, then
with the moon, lastly with the stars, as if there should be three
different movements of the rain connected with the three movements of
light.

<span id="fn_1148"></span>[225:2](sbe0427.htm#fr_1160.md) Waters come down
from the sky to the earth and come up back from the earth to the sky
(see Farg. V, 15 seq.)

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[225:3](sbe0427.htm#fr_1161.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[225:4](sbe0427.htm#fr_1162.md) 'If thou art a
righteous man' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[225:5](sbe0427.htm#fr_1163.md) The translation
of this clause is doubtful.

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[226:1](sbe0427.htm#fr_1164.md) Doubtful; the
text is corrupt. The spell refers to the cleansing and generative power
of the waters; cf. the invocation to Ardvî Sûra, Farg. VII, 16: the
waters are supposed to make females fertile as they make the earth. This
spell was probably pronounced to facilitate childbirth.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[226:2](sbe0427.htm#fr_1165.md) Or better, 'a
female;' there are, in the text, two words for 'milk,' the one referring
to the milk of women, the other to the milk of cows.

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[226:3](sbe0427.htm#fr_1166.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[226:4](sbe0427.htm#fr_1167.md) When the bull
died, 'what was bright and strong in his seed was brought to the sphere
of the moon, and when it was cleansed there in the light of the astre,
two creatures were shaped with it, a male and a female, from which came
two hundred and seventy-two kinds of animals' (Bund. IV, X; cf. Orm.
Ahr. §§ 125 and 127).

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[227:1](sbe0427.htm#fr_1168.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[227:2](sbe0427.htm#fr_1169.md) When Ti*s*trya,
the storm god who gives rain, became a star (see Introd. IV, 36), it was
thought that there was a relation between the stars and rain.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[228:1](sbe0427.htm#fr_1170.md) 'He who
diminishes light, Ahriman' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[228:2](sbe0427.htm#fr_1171.md) 'Sterility,
Ahriman' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[229:1](sbe0427.htm#fr_1174.md) As in preceding
Fargard, § 13.
