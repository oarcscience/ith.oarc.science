## FARGARD V.

This chapter and the following ones, to the end of the twelfth, deal
chiefly with uncleanness arising from the dead, and with the means of
removing it from men and things.

The subjects treated in this Fargard are as follows:--

I (1-7). If a man defile the fire or the earth involuntarily, or
unconsciously, it is no sin.

II (8-9). Water and fire do not kill.

III (10-14). Disposal of the dead during winter.

IV (15-20). How the Dakhmas are cleansed by water from the heavens.

V (21-26). On the excellence of purity and of the law that shows how to
recover it, when lost.

VI (27-38). On the defiling power of the Nasu being greater or less,
according to the greater or less dignity of the being that dies.

VII (39-44). On the management of sacrificial implements defiled by the
dead.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

VIII (45-62). On the treatment of a woman who has been delivered of a
still-born child; and what is to be done with her clothes.

### I a.

1\. There dies a man in the depths of the vale: a bird takes flight from
the top of the mountain down into the depths of the vale, and it eats up
the corpse of the dead man there: then, up it flies from the depths of
the vale to the top of the mountain: it flies to some one of the trees
there, of the hard-wooded or the soft-wooded, and upon that tree it
vomits, it deposits dung, it drops pieces from the corpse.

2 (7). Now, lo! here is a man coming up from the depths of the vale to
the top of the mountain; he comes to the tree whereon the bird is
sitting; from that tree he wants to take wood for the fire. He fells the
tree, he hews the tree, he splits it into logs, and then he lights it in
the fire, the son of Ahura Mazda. What is the penalty that he shall
pay <span id="fr_533"></span>[1](#fn_529.md)?

3 (11). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘There is no sin upon a man for any dead
matter that has been brought by dogs, by birds, by wolves, by winds, or
by flies.

4 (12). 'For were there sin upon a man for any dead matter that might
have been brought by dogs, by birds, by wolves, by winds, or by flies,
how soon this material world of mine would have in it only
Peshôtanus <span id="fr_534"></span>[2](#fn_530.md), shut out from the way
of holiness,

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

whose souls will cry and wail <span id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_531.md)! so
numberless are the beings that die upon the face of the earth.'

### I b.

5 (15). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Here is a man
watering a corn field. The water streams down the field; it streams
again; it streams a third time; and the fourth time, a dog, a fox, or a
wolf carries a corpse into the bed of the stream: what is the penalty
that the man shall pay <span id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_532.md)?

6 (19). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘There is no sin upon a man for any dead
matter that has been brought by dogs, by birds, by wolves, by winds, or
by flies.

7 (20). 'For were there sin upon a man for any dead matter that might
have been brought by dogs, by birds, by wolves, by winds, or by flies,
how soon this material world of mine would have in it only Peshôtanus,
shut out from the way of, holiness, whose souls will cry and wail! so
numberless are the beings that die upon the face of the earth.'

### II a.

8 (23). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Does water
kill <span id="fr_537"></span>[3](#fn_533.md)?

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

Ahura Mazda answered: 'Water kills no man: Astô-vîdhôtu <span
id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_534.md) ties the noose around his neck, and,
thus tied, Vaya <span id="fr_539"></span>[2](#fn_535.md) carries him off:
then the flood takes him up <span id="fr_540"></span>[3](#fn_536.md), the
flood takes him down <span id="fr_541"></span>[4](#fn_537.md), the flood
throws him ashore; then birds feed upon him, and chance brings him here,
or brings him there <span id="fr_542"></span>[5](#fn_538.md).'

### II b.

9 (29). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Does fire kill?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'Fire kills no man: Astô-vîdhôtu ties the noose
around his neck, and, thus tied, Vaya carries him off. The fire burns up
life and limb, and then chance brings him here, or brings him
there <span id="fr_543"></span>[6](#fn_539.md).'

10 (34). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If the summer is
past and the winter has come, what shall the worshippers of Mazda
do <span id="fr_544"></span>[7](#fn_540.md)?

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

Ahura Mazda answered: 'In every house? in every borough <span
id="fr_545"></span>[1](#fn_541.md), they shall raise three small houses for
the dead <span id="fr_546"></span>[2](#fn_542.md).'

11 (37). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How large shall
be those houses for the dead?

Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Large enough not to strike the skull, or the
feet, or the hands of the man, if he <span
id="fr_547"></span>[3](#fn_543.md) should stand erect, and hold out his
feet, and stretch out his hands: such shall be, according to the law,
the houses for the dead.

12 (41). ‘And they shall let the lifeless body lie there, for two
nights, or for three nights, or a month long, until the birds-begin to
fly <span id="fr_548"></span>[4](#fn_544.md), the plants to grow, the
floods to flow, and the wind to dry up the waters from off the
earth <span id="fr_549"></span>[5](#fn_545.md).

13 (44). ‘And as soon as the birds begin to fly, the plants to grow, the
floods to flow, and the wind to dry up the waters from off the earth,
then the worshippers of Mazda shall lay down the dead (on the Dakhma)
his eyes towards the sun.

14 (46). 'If the worshippers of Mazda have not, within a year, laid down
the dead (on the Dakhma),

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

his eyes towards the sun, thou shalt prescribe for that trespass the
same penalty as for the murder of one of the faithful. And there shall
it lie until the corpse has been rained on, until the Dakhma has been
rained on, until the unclean remains have been rained on, until the
birds have eaten up the corpse.'

### IV.

15 (49). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Is it true that
thou, Ahura Mazda, sendest the waters from the sea Vouru-kasha <span
id="fr_550"></span>[1](#fn_546.md) down with the wind and with the clouds?

16 (51). That thou, Ahura Mazda, makest them flow down to the
corpses <span id="fr_551"></span>[2](#fn_547.md)? that thou, Ahura Mazda,
makest them flow down to the Dakhmas? that thou, Ahura Mazda, makest
them flow down to the unclean remains? that thou, Ahura Mazda, makest
them flow down to the bones? and that then thou, Ahura Mazda, makest
them flow back unseen? that thou, Ahura Mazda, makest them flow back to
the sea Pûitika <span id="fr_552"></span>[3](#fn_548.md)?

17 (53). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is even so

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

as thou hast said, O righteous Zarathu*s*tra! I, Ahura Mazda, send the
waters from the sea Vouru-kasha down with the wind and with the clouds.

18 (55). ‘I, Ahura Mazda, make them stream down to the corpses; I, Ahura
Mazda, make them stream down to the Dakhmas; I, Ahura Mazda, make them
stream down to the unclean remains; I, Ahura Mazda, make them stream
down to the bones; then I, Ahura Mazda, make them flow back unseen; I,
Ahura Mazda, make them flow back to the sea Pûitika <span
id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_549.md).

19 (56). ‘The waters stand there boiling, boiling up in the heart of the
sea Pûitika, and, when cleansed there, they run back again from the sea
Pûitika to the sea Vouru-kasha, towards the well-watered tree <span
id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_550.md), whereon grow the seeds of my plants of
every kind by hundreds, by thousands, by hundreds of thousands.

20(60). 'Those plants, I, Ahura Mazda, rain down upon the earth <span
id="fr_555"></span>[2](#fn_550.md), to bring food to the faithful, and
fodder to the beneficent cow; to bring food to my people that they may
live on it, and fodder to the beneficent cow.'

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

### V

21 (63). 'This <span id="fr_556"></span>[1](#fn_551.md) is the best of all
things, this is the fairest of all things, even as thou hast said, O
righteous Zarathu*s*tra!'

With these words the holy Ahura Mazda rejoiced the holy
Zarathu*s*tra <span id="fr_557"></span>[2](#fn_552.md): 'Purity is for man,
next to life, the greatest good <span id="fr_558"></span>[3](#fn_553.md),
that purity that is procured by the law of Mazda to him who cleanses his
own self with good thoughts, words, and deeds <span
id="fr_559"></span>[4](#fn_554.md).'

22 (68). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! This law, this
fiend-destroying law of Zarathu*s*tra, by what greatness, goodness, and
fairness is it great, good, and fair above all other utterances?

23 (69). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘As much above all other floods as is the
sea Vouru-kasha, so much above all other utterances in greatness,
goodness, and fairness is this law, this fiend-destroying law of
Zarathu*s*tra.

24 (70). ‘As much as a great stream flows swifter than a slender
rivulet, so much above all other utterances in greatness, goodness, and
fairness is this law, this fiend-destroying law of Zarathu*s*tra.

‘As high as the great tree <span id="fr_560"></span>[5](#fn_555.md) stands
above the small plants it overshadows, so high above all other

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

utterances in greatness, goodness, and fairness is this law, this
fiend-destroying law of Zarathu*s*tra.

25, 26 (73-81). ‘As high as heaven is above the earth that it compasses
around, so high above all other utterances is this law, this
fiend-destroying law of Mazda.

'Therefore, when the Ratu has been applied to <span
id="fr_561"></span>[1](#fn_556.md) when the Sraoshâ-varez has been applied
to <span id="fr_562"></span>[2](#fn_557.md); whether for a
draona-service <span id="fr_563"></span>[3](#fn_558.md) that has been
undertaken <span id="fr_564"></span>[4](#fn_559.md), or for one that has
not been undertaken <span id="fr_565"></span>[5](#fn_560.md); whether for a
draona that has been offered up, or for one that has not been offered
up; whether for a draona that has been shared, or for one that has not
been shared <span id="fr_566"></span>[6](#fn_561.md); the Ratu has power to
remit him

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

one-third of the penalty he had to pay <span
id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_562.md): if he has committed any other evil
deed, it is remitted by his repentance; if he has committed, no other
evil deed, he is absolved by his repentance for ever and ever <span
id="fr_568"></span>[2](#fn_563.md).'

### VI.

27 (82). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be a
number of men resting in the same place, on adjoining carpets, on
adjoining pillows, be there two men near one another, or five, or fifty,
or a hundred, close by one another; and of those people one happens to
die; how many of them does the Dru*g* Nasu envelope with infection,
pollution, and uncleanness <span id="fr_569"></span>[3](#fn_564.md)?

28 (86). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘If the dead one be a priest, the
Dru*g*-Nasu rushes forth <span id="fr_570"></span>[4](#fn_565.md), O
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the eleventh and defiles the
ten <span id="fr_571"></span>[5](#fn_566.md).

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

‘If the dead one be a warrior, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the tenth and defiles the nine.

‘If the dead one be a husbandman, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the ninth and defiles the eight.

29 (92). ‘If it be a shepherd's dog, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the eighth and defiles the seven.

‘If it be a house dog, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the seventh and defiles the six.

30 (96). ‘If it be a Vohunazga dog <span
id="fr_572"></span>[1](#fn_567.md), the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the sixth and defiles the five.

‘If it be a young dog <span id="fr_573"></span>[2](#fn_568.md), the Dru*g*
Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the fifth and
defiles the four.

31 (100). ‘If it be a Sukuruna dog <span
id="fr_574"></span>[3](#fn_569.md), the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the fourth and defiles the three.

‘If it be a *G*a*z*u dog <span id="fr_575"></span>[4](#fn_570.md), the
Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the
third and defiles the two.

32 (104). ‘If it be an Aiwizu dog, the Dru*g*

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nasu rushes forth,
O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the second and defiles the next.

'If it be a Vîzu dog, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the next, she defiles the next.'

33 (108). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If it be an
Urupi dog <span id="fr_576"></span>[1](#fn_571.md), how many of the
creatures of the good spirit does it directly defile, how many does it
indirectly defile in dying?

34 (110). Ahura Mazda answered: 'An Urupi dog does neither directly nor
indirectly defile any of the creatures of the good spirit, but him who
smites and kills it; to him the uncleanness clings for ever and
ever <span id="fr_577"></span>[2](#fn_572.md).'

35 (113). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If the dead one
be a wicked, two-footed ruffian, an ungodly Ashemaogha <span
id="fr_578"></span>[3](#fn_573.md) how many of the creatures of the good
spirit does he directly defile, how many does he indirectly defile in
dying?

36 (115). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘No more than a frog does whose venom is
dried up, and that has been dead more than a year <span
id="fr_579"></span>[4](#fn_574.md). Whilst alive, indeed, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! that wicked, two-legged

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

ruffian, that ungodly Ashemaogha, directly defiles the creatures of the
good spirit, and indirectly defiles them.

37 (119). ‘Whilst alive he smites the water <span
id="fr_580"></span>[1](#fn_575.md); whilst alive he blows out the
fire <span id="fr_581"></span>[2](#fn_576.md); whilst alive he carries off
the cow <span id="fr_582"></span>[3](#fn_577.md); whilst alive he smites
the faithful man with a deadly blow, that parts the soul from the
body <span id="fr_583"></span>[4](#fn_578.md); not so will he do when dead.

38 (120). 'Whilst alive, indeed, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! that wicked,
two-legged ruffian, that ungodly Ashemaogha, never ceases depriving the
faithful man of his food, of his clothing, of his house, of his bed, of
his vessels <span id="fr_584"></span>[5](#fn_579.md); not so will he do
when dead.'

### VII.

39 (122). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! When into our
houses here below we have brought the fire, the baresma, the cups, the
Haoma, and the mortar <span id="fr_585"></span>[6](#fn_580.md), O holy
Ahura Mazda! if it come to pass that either a dog or a man dies there,
what shall the worshippers of Mazda do?

40 (125). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Out of the house, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! shall they take the fire, the baresma, the cups, the
Haoma, and the mortar; they shall take the dead one out to the proper
place <span id="fr_586"></span>[7](#fn_581.md) whereto, according to the
law, corpses must be brought, to be devoured there.'

41 (128). O Maker of the material world, thou

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Holy One! When
shall they bring back the fire into the house wherein the man has died?

42 (129). Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall wait for nine nights in
winter, for a month in summer, and then they shall bring back the fire
to the house wherein the man has died.'

43 030. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! And if they shall
bring back the fire to the house wherein the man has died, within the
nine nights, or within the month, what penalty shall they pay?

44 (134). Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall be Peshôtanus: two hundred
stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, two hundred stripes with the
Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

### VIII.

45 (135) <span id="fr_587"></span>[1](#fn_582.md). O Maker of the material
world, thou Holy One! If in the house of a worshipper of Mazda there be
a woman with child, and if being a month gone, or two, or three, or
four, or five, or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or ten months gone,
she bring forth a still-born child, what shall the worshippers of Mazda
do?

40 (139). Ahura Mazda answered: 'The place in that Mazdean house whereof
the ground is the cleanest and the driest, and the least passed through
by flocks and herds, by Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated
bundles of baresma, and by the faithful;'--

47 (143). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from the
fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated bundles of
baresma? How far from the faithful?

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

48 (144). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Thirty paces from the fire; thirty
paces from the water; thirty paces from the consecrated bundles of
baresma; three paces from the faithful;--

49 (145). 'On that place shall the worshippers of Mazda erect an
enclosure <span id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_583.md), and therein shall they
establish her with food, therein shall they establish her with clothes.'

50 (147). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What is the food
that the woman shall first take?

51 (148). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘She shall drink gômêz <span
id="fr_589"></span>[2](#fn_584.md) mixed with ashes, three cups of it, or
six, or nine, to wash over the grave within her womb.

52 (151). 'Afterwards she may drink boiling <span
id="fr_590"></span>[3](#fn_585.md) milk of mares, cows, sheep, or goats,
with pap or without pap <span id="fr_591"></span>[4](#fn_586.md); she may
take cooked meat without water, bread without wafer, and wine without
water <span id="fr_592"></span>[5](#fn_587.md).'

53 (154). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long shall
she remain so? How long shall she live only on that sort of meat, bread,
and wine?

54 (155). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Three nights

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

long shall she remain so; three nights long shall she live on that sort
of meat, bread, and wine. Then, when three nights have passed, she shall
wash her body, she shall wash her clothes, with gômêz and water, by the
nine holes <span id="fr_593"></span>[1](#fn_588.md), and thus shall she be
clean.'

55 (157). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long shall
she remain so? How long, after the three nights have gone, shall she sit
confined, and live separated from the rest of the worshippers of Mazda,
as to her seat, her food, and her clothing?

56 (158). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Nine nights long shall she remain so:
nine nights long, after the three nights have gone, shall she sit
confined, and live separated from the rest of the worshippers of Mazda,
as to her seat, her food, and her clothing. Then, when the nine nights
have gone, she shall wash her body, and cleanse her clothes with gômêz
and water <span id="fr_594"></span>[2](#fn_589.md).'

57 (160) <span id="fr_595"></span>[3](#fn_590.md). O Maker of the material
world, thou Holy One! Can those clothes, when once washed and cleansed,
ever be used either by a Zaotar, or by a Hâvanan, or by an
Âtare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or by an Âbere*d*, or by an Âsnâtar,
or by a

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rathwi*s*kar, or
by a Sraoshâ-varez <span id="fr_596"></span>[1](#fn_591.md), or by any
priest, warrior, or husbandman <span id="fr_597"></span>[2](#fn_592.md)?

58 (162). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Never can those clothes, even when
washed and cleansed, be used either by a Zaotar, or by a Hâvanan, or by
an Âtare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or by an Âbere*d*, or by an
Âsnâtar, or by a Rathwi*s*kar, or by a Sraoshâ-varez, or by any priest,
warrior, or husbandman.

59 (164). ‘But if there be in a Mazdean house a woman who is in her
sickness, or a man who has become unfit for work <span
id="fr_598"></span>[3](#fn_593.md), and who must sit in the place of
infirmity <span id="fr_599"></span>[4](#fn_594.md), those clothes shall
serve for their coverings and for their sheets <span
id="fr_600"></span>[5](#fn_595.md), until they can withdraw and move their
hands <span id="fr_601"></span>[6](#fn_596.md).

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

60 (168). ‘Ahura Mazda, indeed, does not allow us to waste anything of
value that we may have, not even so much as an Asperena's <span
id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_597.md) weight of thread, not even so much as a
maid lets fall in spinning.

61 (170). ‘Whosoever throws any clothing on a dead body <span
id="fr_603"></span>[2](#fn_598.md), even so much as a maid lets fall in
spinning, is not a pious man whilst alive, nor shall he, when dead, have
a place in the happy realm <span id="fr_604"></span>[3](#fn_599.md).

62 (174). 'He shall go away into the world of the fiends, into that dark
world <span id="fr_605"></span>[4](#fn_600.md), made of darkness, the
offspring of darkness <span id="fr_606"></span>[5](#fn_601.md). To that
world, to the

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

dismal realm, you are delivered by your own doings, by your own souls, O
sinners!'

51</span> from God: how then is it that they kill? 'Let a Gueber light a
sacred fire for a hundred years, if he once fall into it, he shall be
burnt.' Even the Mobeds, if we may trust Elisaeus, complained that the
fire would burn them without regard for their piety, when to adore it
they came too near (Vartan's War, p. 211 of the French translation by
l’Abbé Garabed). The answer was that it is not the fire nor the water
that kills, but the demon of Death and Fate. 'Nothing whatever that I
created in the world, said Ormazd, does harm to man; it is the bad Nâi
(lege Vâi) that kills the man' (Gr. Rav. 124).

<span id="fn_534"></span>[51:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_538.md) Literally, 'binds
him;' see Introd. IV, 26; cf. Farg. XIX, 29.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[51:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_539.md) 'The bad Vâi'
(Comm.); see Introd. IV, 17.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[51:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_540.md) To the surface.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[51:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_541.md) To the bottom.

<span id="fn_538"></span>[51:5](sbe0411.htm#fr_542.md) Or perhaps, 'When he
departs, it is by the will of Destiny that he departs' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_539"></span>[51:6](sbe0411.htm#fr_543.md) See preceding note.

<span id="fn_540"></span>[51:7](sbe0411.htm#fr_544.md) In case a man dies
during the snowy season, while it is difficult <span id="page_52">p.
52</span> or impossible to take the corpse to the Dakhma, which usually
stands far from inhabited places. The same case is treated more clearly
and fully in Farg. VIII, 4 seq.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[52:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_545.md) In every isolated
house, in every group of houses.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[52:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_546.md) Thence is derived
the modern usage of the Zâd-marg, a small mud house where the corpse is
laid, to lie there till it can be taken to the Dakhma (Anquetil,
Zend-Avesta II, 583). The object of that provision is to remove the
uncleanness of the dead from the place of the living. An older form of
the same provision is found in Farg. VIII, 8.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[52:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_547.md) 'Being in life'
(Comm.)

<span id="fn_544"></span>[52:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_548.md) To come back.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[52:5](sbe0411.htm#fr_549.md) 'Until the winter is
past' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_546"></span>[53:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_550.md) The sea above, the
clouds. See Introd. IV, 11.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[53:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_551.md) Zoroaster seems to
wonder that Ormazd fears so little to infringe his own laws by defiling
waters with the dead. In a Ravaet, he asks him bluntly why he forbids,
men to take corpses to the water, while he himself sends rain to the
Dakhmas (Gr. Rav. 125).

<span id="fn_548"></span>[53:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_552.md) The sea where waters
are purified before going back to their heavenly seat, the sea
Vouru-kasha (see § 19). Pûitika, 'the clean,' is very likely to have
been originally a name or epithet of the sea Vouru-kasha. When the
mythic geography of Mazdeism was reduced into a system, the epithet took
a separate existence, as it gave a ready answer to that question, which,
it may be, was raised first by the name itself: 'Where are the waters
cleansed which have been defiled her below, and which we see falling
again to us pure and clean?'

<span id="fn_549"></span>[54:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_553.md) In later mythology,
the sea Vouru-kasha and the sea Pûitika were assimilated to the Arabian
sea and to the gulf of Oman: the moving to and fro of the waters from
heaven to earth and from the earth to heaven was interpreted as the
coming and going of the tide (Bund. XIII).

<span id="fn_550"></span>[54:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_555.md) The tree of all
seeds (Harvisptokhm), which grows in the middle of the sea Vouru-kasha;
the seeds of all plants are on it. There is a godlike bird, the Sinamru,
sitting on that tree; whenever he flies off the tree, there grow out of
it a thousand boughs; whenever he alights on it, there break a thousand
boughs, the seeds of which are scattered about, and rained down on the
earth by Ti*s*tar (Ti*s*trya), the rain-god (Yt. XII, 17; Minokhired
LXII, 37 seq.; Bundahi*s* XXVII; cf. Farg. XX, 4 seq.)

<span id="fn_551"></span>[55:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_556.md) The cleansing, the
purification.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[55:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_557.md) 'When Zoroaster saw
that man is able to escape sin by performing good works, he was filled
with joy' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_553"></span>[55:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_558.md) As uncleanness is
nothing less than a form of death (see Introd. V, 3).

<span id="fn_554"></span>[55:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_559.md) That is to say, 'Who
performs the rites of cleansing according to the prescriptions of the
law.'

<span id="fn_555"></span>[55:5](sbe0411.htm#fr_560.md) 'The royal cypress
above small herbs' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_556"></span>[56:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_561.md) 'To take the rule'
(Comm.), which probably means, 'to know what sort of penance he must
undergo;' as, when a man has sinned with the tongue or with the hand,
the Dastur (or Ratu) must prescribe for him the expiation that the sin
requires. The Ratu is the chief priest, the spiritual head of the
community.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[56:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_562.md) 'To weep for his
crime' (Comm.), which may mean, 'to recite to him the Patet, or, to
receive at his hand the proper number of stripes.' It is difficult to
say exactly what were the functions of the Sraoshâ-varez, which seem to
have been twofold. The cock is compared to him, as being 'the one who
sets the world in motion,' and wakes men for prayer (Farg. XVIII, 14,
text and note), which would make him a sort of Zoroastrian Muezzin; at
the same time he is the priest of penance. His name may refer to either
of his functions, according as, it is translated, 'the one who causes
hearing,' or 'the executor of punishment;' in the first case he would be
the priest who pronounces the favete linguis, the *s*râusha*t*; in the
other case he would be the priest who wields the Sraoshô-*k*arana (see
Introd. V, 19).

<span id="fn_558"></span>[56:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_563.md) A service in honour
of any of the angels, or of deceased persons, in which small cakes,
called draona, are consecrated in their names, and then. given to those
present to eat.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[56:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_564.md) When it ought not to
be.

<span id="fn_560"></span>[56:5](sbe0411.htm#fr_565.md) When it ought to be.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[56:6](sbe0411.htm#fr_566.md) The meaning of the
sentence is not certain; it alludes to <span id="page_57">p. 57</span>
religious customs which are not well known. The Commentary interprets it
as amounting to, 'Whether he has thought what he ought not to have
thought, or has not thought what he ought to have thought; whether he
has said what he ought not to have said, or has not said what he ought
to have said; whether he has done what he ought not to have done, or has
not done what he ought to have done.'

<span id="fn_562"></span>[57:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_567.md) When the Ratu remits
one-third of the sin, God remits the whole of it (Saddar 29).

<span id="fn_563"></span>[57:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_568.md) Cf. Farg. III, 21.

<span id="fn_564"></span>[57:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_569.md) See Introd. V, 3.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[57:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_570.md) In opposition to the
case when the dead one is an Ashemaogha (§ 35), as no Nasu issues then.

<span id="fn_566"></span>[57:5](sbe0411.htm#fr_571.md) Literally, 'If she
falls on the eleventh, she defiles the tenth.' The word if refers to the
supposition that there are eleven persons at least, and the words 'she
defiles the tenth' must be understood to mean 'she defiles to the
tenth.' In the Ravaets, the Avesta distinctions are lost, and the
defiling power of the Nasu is the same, whatever may have been the rank
of the dead: 'If there be a <span id="page_58">p. 58</span> number of
people sleeping in the same place, and if one of them happen to die, all
those around him, in any direction, as far as the eleventh, become
unclean if they have been in contact with one another' (Gr. Rav. 470).

<span id="fn_567"></span>[58:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_572.md) A dog without a
master (see Farg. XIII, 19).

<span id="fn_568"></span>[58:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_573.md) A dog not more than
four months old.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[58:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_574.md) According to
Aspendiârji, a siyâ-gosh, or 'black-eared' lynx, the messenger of the
lion.

<span id="fn_570"></span>[58:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_575.md) This name and the
two following, Aiwizu and Vîzu, are left untranslated, not being clear,
in the Pahlavi translation.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[59:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_576.md) A weasel. The weasel
is one of the creatures of Ahura, for 'it has been created to fight
against the serpent garza and the other khrafstras that live in holes'
(Bund. 47, 8).

<span id="fn_572"></span>[59:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_577.md) Not that the unclean
one cannot be cleansed, but that his uncleanness does not pass from him
to another.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[59:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_578.md) See Introd. IV, 10;
V, 11.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[59:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_579.md) The frog is a
creature of Ahriman's, and one of the most hateful; for, in the sea
Vouru-kasha, it goes swimming around the white Hom, the tree of
everlasting life, and would gnaw it down, but for the godlike fish
Kar-mâhî, that keeps watch and guards the tree wherever the frog would
slip in (Bund. XVIII; cf. Orm. Ahr. § 146).

<span id="fn_575"></span>[60:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_580.md) By defiling it (a
capital crime; see Introd. V, 8, and Farg. VII, 25).

<span id="fn_576"></span>[60:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_581.md) He extinguishes the
Bahrâm fire (a capital crime; Introd. V, 9).

<span id="fn_577"></span>[60:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_582.md) As a cattle-lifter.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[60:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_583.md) As an assassin.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[60:5](sbe0411.htm#fr_584.md) By defiling or by
stealing them.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[60:6](sbe0411.htm#fr_585.md) In order to perform
a sacrifice.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[60:7](sbe0411.htm#fr_586.md) The Dakhma.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[61:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_587.md) §§ 45-54 = Farg.
VII, 60-69.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[62:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_588.md) The Armê*s*t-gâh
(cf. Farg. III, 15 seq., and Introd. V, 15).

<span id="fn_584"></span>[62:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_589.md) Urine of the ox: it
destroys the Nasu in her womb (Introd. V, 5). The ashes work to the same
end, as they are taken from the Bahrâm fire (Comm.), the earthly
representative of the fire of lightning, and the most powerful destroyer
of fiends (see Introd. V, 8, and Farg. VIII, 80 seq.) Three cups, or
six, or nine, according to her strength' (Asp.)

<span id="fn_585"></span>[62:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_590.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[62:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_591.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[62:5](sbe0411.htm#fr_592.md) See Introd. V, 13.
'The water would be defiled;' cf. Farg. VII, 70 seq.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[63:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_593.md) She shall perform
the nine nights’ Barashnûm, for the details of which see Farg. IX.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[63:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_594.md) The modern custom is
somewhat different: 'If a woman brings forth a still-born child, after a
pregnancy of one month to ten months, the first food she shall take is
nîrang (= gômêz) . . . fire and ashes; and she is not allowed until the
fourth day to take water or salt, or any food that is cooked with water
or salt: on the fourth day they give her nîrang, that she may cleanse
herself and wash her clothes with it, and she is not allowed to wash
herself and her clothes with water until the forty-first day' (Gr. Rav.
568).

<span id="fn_590"></span>[63:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_595.md) §§ 57-62 = Farg.
VII, 7-22.

<span id="fn_591"></span>[64:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_596.md) These are the names
of the different priests who were engaged in the sacrifices. The Hâvanan
strains the Haoma; the Âtare-vakhsha kindles the fire; the Frabaretar
brings all that is necessary for the sacrifice (Anquetil); the Âbere*d*
brings the water (Anquetil and Zand-Pahlavi Glossary, 21); the Âsnâtar
cleanses the vessels. Those are the priests who are entrusted with the
preparatory or accessory proceedings; the essential duties are performed
by the Zaotar and the Rathwi*s*kar, the former chanting the hymns and
saying the prayers, the latter performing the various operations during
the sacrifice. Nowadays there are only two priests, the Zaotar (Zûtî)
and the Rathwi*s*kar (Raspî), the latter performing all the accessory
services formerly performed by several priests. As to the Sraoshâ-varez,
see above, § 25, note 2.

<span id="fn_592"></span>[64:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_597.md) In short, by any of
the faithful, when in state of purity.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[64:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_598.md) An Armê*s*t;
literally, 'an infirm person,' that is to say, one who is unclean,
during the time of his uncleanness (Farg. IX, 33 seq.), when all work is
forbidden to him (cf. Introd. V, 15).

<span id="fn_594"></span>[64:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_599.md) The Armê*s*t-gâh
(cf. Introd. V, x5).

<span id="fn_595"></span>[64:5](sbe0411.htm#fr_600.md) The clothing defiled
by the dead can only serve for Dashtân women, even after it has been
washed and exposed for six months to the light of the sun and of the
moon (Saddar 91, cf. Farg. VII, 10 seq.)

<span id="fn_596"></span>[64:6](sbe0411.htm#fr_601.md) Until they are
clean. The unclean must have their hands <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>
wrapped in an old piece of linen, lest they should touch and defile
anything clean.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[65:1](sbe0411.htm#fr_602.md) See Farg. IV, 48,
note 4.

<span id="fn_598"></span>[65:2](sbe0411.htm#fr_603.md) Cf. Farg. VIII, 23
seq. It appears from those passages that the dead must lie on the
mountain naked, or 'clothed only with the light or heaven' (Farg. VI,
51). The modern custom is to clothe them with old clothing (Dadabhai
Naoroji, Manners and Customs of the Parsis, p. 15). 'When a man dies and
receives the order (to depart), the older the shroud they make for him,
the better. It must be old, worn out, but well washed: they must not lay
anything new on the dead. For it is said in the Zend Vendîdâd, If they
put on the dead even so much as a thread from the distaff more than is
necessary, every thread shall become in the other world a black snake
clinging to the heart of him who made that shroud, and even the dead
shall rise against him and seize him by the skirt, and say, That shroud
which thou madest for me has become food for worms and vermin' (Saddar
12). The Greeks entertained quite different ideas, and dressed the dead
in their gayest attire, as if for a feast. Yet the difference is only in
appearance; for, after the fourth day, when the soul is in heaven, then
rich garments are offered up to it, which it will wear in its celestial
life (Saddar 87, Hyde 64).

<span id="fn_599"></span>[65:3](sbe0411.htm#fr_604.md) The Behesht or
paradise.

<span id="fn_600"></span>[65:4](sbe0411.htm#fr_605.md) 'Where darkness can
be seized with the hand' (Comm.; cf. Aogemaidê 28); something more than
the 'visible darkness.'

<span id="fn_601"></span>[65:5](sbe0411.htm#fr_606.md) The Commentary has,
'the place of those who impregnate <span id="page_66">p. 66</span>
darkness, for the Dru*g* who conceives seed from the sinner comes from
that place' (cf. Farg. XVIII, 30 seq.)
