<p><FONT SIZE="-1">During the process of cleansing, the voice works with the hand. The spells which must be recited while the unclean one is cleansing himself have already been mentioned in the preceding Fargard, but we find here a detailed list of spells which are to be spoken twice, or thrice, or four times. The exact time when they are to be uttered is not mentioned, and we do not know whether they are to accompany those prescribed in the last Fargard, and are, therefore, to be repeated as often as the unclean one is washed, or whether they are only intended to close the whole ceremony.</p>  
<p>These spells, like the former ones, are taken from the hymns or G&acirc;thas, the oldest and holiest part of the Avesta. They were not written for this particular purpose, but, as happens in all religions, advantage was taken of whatever there might be in the old sacred hymns which could be more or less easily applied to the special circumstances of the case. The recitation of these lines is followed by an exorcism, written in the ordinary language of the Avesta, which has been expressly composed for the occasion.</FONT></p>  
<p>1. Zarathu<I>s</I>tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda! most beneficent spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How shall I fight against that Dru<I>g</I> who from the dead rushes upon the living? How shall I fight against that Dru<I>g</I> who from the dead defiles the living?'</p>  
<p>2 (3). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Say aloud those words in the G&acirc;thas that are to be said twice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_785"></A><A HREF="#fn_776"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; say</p>

<p>3 (7). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which are those words in the G&acirc;thas that are to be said twice?</p>  
<p>4 (10). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;These are the words in the G&acirc;thas that are to be said twice, and thou shalt twice say them aloud:--</p>

<p>7 (13). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which are those words in the G&acirc;thas that are to be said thrice?</p>  
<p>8 (16). Ahura Mazda answered: &#8216;These are the words in the G&acirc;thas that are to be said thrice, and thou shalt thrice say them aloud:--</p>
