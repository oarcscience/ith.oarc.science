## FARGARD XVII.

### Hair and Nails.

Anything that has been separated from the body of man is considered dead
matter (Introd. V, 12), and is accordingly supposed to fall into the
possession of the demon and to become the abode of death and
uncleanness. Therefore, hair and nails, as soon as cut off, are at once
the property of Ahriman, and the demon has to be driven away from them
by spells, in the same way as he is from the bodies of the dead. They
are withdrawn from his power by

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

the recital of certain prayers, and by being deposited in the earth
inside consecrated circles, which are drawn around them as an
intrenchment against the fiend (see above, p. 122, n. 1).

This chapter, which has given full scope to the ironical humour of many,
is an invaluable document in the eyes of the mythologist, as he finds in
it, if not the origin and explanation, at least the oldest record of
world-wide superstitions. Not only in Bombay, but all over the world,
people are found who believe that hair and nails are weapons in the
hands of the evil one. The Esthonians, on the shores of the Baltic, take
the utmost care not to drop the parings of their nails on the ground,
lest the devil should pick them up, to make a visor to his cap, which
will give him full power to injure men, unless the sign of the cross has
been made over them <span id="fr_972"></span>[1](#fn_960.md). The Gauchos
in the Chilian pampas fear to throw their hair to the winds, but deposit
it in holes dug in a wall <span id="fr_973"></span>[2](#fn_961.md). In
Liége good people are advised not to throw away their hair, nor to leave
it in the teeth of the comb, lest a witch take hold of it and cast a
spell over them <span id="fr_974"></span>[3](#fn_962.md).

### I.

1\. Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which is the most
deadly deed whereby a man increases most the baleful strength of the
Daêvas, as he would do by offering them a sacrifice?'

2 (3). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is when a man here below combing his
hair or shaving it off, or paring off his nails drops them <span
id="fr_975"></span>[4](#fn_963.md) in a hole or in a crack <span
id="fr_976"></span>[5](#fn_964.md).

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

3 (6). ‘Then for want of the lawful rites being observed, Daêvas are
produced in the earth; for want of the lawful rites being observed,
those Khrafstras are produced in the earth which men call lice, and
which eat up the corn in the corn-field and the clothes in the wardrobe.

4 (10). ‘Therefore, O Zarathu*s*tra! whenever here below thou shalt comb
thy hair or shave it off, or pare off thy nails, thou shalt take them
away ten paces from the faithful, twenty paces from the fire, thirty
paces from the water, fifty paces from the consecrated bundles of
baresma.

5 (13). ‘Then thou shalt dig a hole, a di*s*ti <span
id="fr_977"></span>[1](#fn_965.md) deep if the earth be hard, a vîtasti
deep if it be soft; thou shalt take the hair down there and thou shalt
say aloud these fiend-smiting words: "Out of him by his piety Mazda made
the plants grow up <span id="fr_978"></span>[2](#fn_966.md)."

6 (17). ‘Thereupon thou shalt draw three furrows with a knife of metal
around the hole, or six furrows or nine, and thou shall chant the
Ahuna-Vairya three times, or six, or nine.

### II.

7 (19). ‘For the nails, thou shalt dig a hole, out

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

of the house, as deep as the top joint of the little finger; thou shalt
take the nails down there and thou shalt say aloud these fiend-smiting
words: "The words that are heard from the pious in holiness and good
thought <span id="fr_979"></span>[1](#fn_967.md)."

8 (24). ‘Then thou shalt draw three furrows with a knife of metal around
the hole, or six furrows or nine, and thou shalt chant the Ahuna-Vairya
three times, or six, or nine.

9 (26). ‘And then: "Look here, O Ashô-zu*s*ta bird <span
id="fr_980"></span>[2](#fn_968.md)! here are the nails for thee: look at
the nails here! May they be for thee so many spears, knives, bows,
falcon-winged arrows, and sling-stones against the Mâzainya Daêvas <span
id="fr_981"></span>[3](#fn_969.md)!"

10 (29). ‘If those nails have not been dedicated (to the bird), they
shall be in the hands of the Mâzainya Daêva so many spears, knives,
bows, falcon-winged arrows, and sling stones (against the Mâzainya
Daêvas) <span id="fr_982"></span>[4](#fn_970.md).

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

11 (30). 'All such sinners, embodiments of the Dru*g*, are scorners of
the law: all scorners of the law are rebels against the Lord: all rebels
against the Lord are ungodly men; and any ungodly man shall pay for it
with his life <span id="fr_983"></span>[1](#fn_971.md).'

<span id="fn_960"></span>[186:1](sbe0423.htm#fr_972.md) Cf. infra, 'Thou
shalt chant the Ahuna-Vairya,' &c., §§ 6, 8, 9.

de Mythologie populaire, publié par H. Gaidoz et E. Rolland, Paris,
1878; pp. 79, 549, 583. To the same train of ideas seems to belong the
Eddic myth of Naglfar, the fatal ship wrought out of the nails of the
dead, which is to take the crew of the demon to the shore of the earth
when the last day of the world is come (Gylfaginning, 51).

<span id="fn_963"></span>[186:4](sbe0423.htm#fr_975.md) Without performing
the requisite ceremonies.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[186:5](sbe0423.htm#fr_976.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[187:1](sbe0423.htm#fr_977.md) A di*s*ti = ten
fingers. A vîtasti = twelve fingers.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[187:2](sbe0423.htm#fr_978.md) See above, X1, 6;
the choice of this line was determined by the presence of the word
plants in it: man was considered a microcosm, and every element in him
was supposed to come from a similar element in nature, to which it was
to return after death, and whence it was to come back again at the time
of the resurrection: his bones from the earth, his blood from the water,
his hair from the trees, his life from the fire (Bundahi*s* XXXI, Ulamâi
Islâm); an old Aryan theory, traces of which are also to be found in
India (Rig-veda X, 16, 3), in Greece (Ilias VII. 99; Empedocles, fr.
378; cf. Epicharmus ap. Plut. Consol. ad Apoll. 15), and in Scandinavia
(Edda, Grimnismal 40).

<span id="fn_967"></span>[188:1](sbe0423.htm#fr_979.md) Yasna XXXIII, 7.
There is here only a play upon the word sruyê, 'is heard,' which chances
to be homonymous with the dual of srva, 'nails of both hands.'

<span id="fn_968"></span>[188:2](sbe0423.htm#fr_980.md) 'The owl,'
according to modern tradition. The word literally means 'friend of
holiness.' 'For the bird Ashôzu*s*ta they recite the Avesta formula; if
they recite it, the fiends tremble and do not take up the nails; but if
the nails have had no spell uttered over them, the fiends and wizards
use them as arrows against the bird Ashôzu*s*ta and kill him. Therefore,
when the nails have had a spell uttered over them, the bird takes and
eats them up, that the fiends may not do any harm by their means'
(Bundahi*s* XIX).

<span id="fn_969"></span>[188:3](sbe0423.htm#fr_981.md) See above, [p.
137](sbe0416.htm#page_137), n. [1](sbe0416.htm#fn_788.md). The nails are
cut in two and the fragments are put in the hole with the point directed
towards the north, that is to say, against the breasts of the Dêvs (see
above, [p. 75](sbe0413.htm#page_75), n. [2](sbe0413.htm#fn_616).md). See
Anquetil, Zend-Avesta II, 117; India Office Library, VIII, 80.

from § 10.

Fargard, § 18.
