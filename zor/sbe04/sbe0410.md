## FARGARD IV.

### Contracts and Outrages.

1-16. Contracts (see Introd. V, 17):--

2\. Classification of contracts;

3-4. Damages for breach of contract;

5-10. Kinsmen responsible;

11-16. Penalties for breach of contract.

17-55. Outrages (see Introd. V, 18)

18-21. Menaces;

22-25. Assaults;

26-29. Blows;

30-33. Wounds;

34-36. Wounds causing blood to flow;

37-39. Broken bones;

40-43. Manslaughter;

46, 49 (bis)-55. False oaths.

Clauses 44-45 refer to contracts, and ought to be placed after § 16.
Clauses 47-49, which are in praise of physical weal, have been probably
misplaced here from the preceding Fargard (see Farg. III, 33). The right
order of this chapter would, therefore, seem to be as follows: 1-16;
44-45 17-43; 46; 49 (bis)-55.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

### I.

1\. He that does not restore (a thing lent), when it is asked for back
again, steals the thing; he robs the man <span
id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_474). So he does every day, every night, as
long as he keeps in his house his neighbour's property, as. though it
were his own <span id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_475).

### II a.

2 (4). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How many in number
are thy contracts, O Ahura Mazda?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'They are six in number <span
id="fr_479"></span>[3](#fn_476). The first is the word-contract <span
id="fr_480"></span>[4](#fn_477); the second

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

is the hand-contract <span id="fr_481"></span>[1](#fn_478); the third is
the contract to the amount of a sheep <span
id="fr_482"></span>[2](#fn_479); the fourth is the contract to the
amount of an ox <span id="fr_483"></span>[3](#fn_480) the fifth is the
contract to the amount of a man <span id="fr_484"></span>[4](#fn_481)
the sixth is the contract to the amount of a field <span
id="fr_485"></span>[5](#fn_482), a field in good land, a fruitful one,
in good bearing <span id="fr_486"></span>[6](#fn_483).'

### II b.

3 (13). If a man make the word-contract a mere word <span
id="fr_487"></span>[7](#fn_484), it shall be redeemed by the
hand-contract; he shall give in pledge <span
id="fr_488"></span>[8](#fn_485) the amount of the hand-contract.

4 (16). The hand-contract <span id="fr_489"></span>[9](#fn_486) shall be
redeemed by the sheep-contract; he shall give in pledge the amount of
the sheep-contract. The sheep-contract shall be redeemed by the
ox-contract; he shall give in pledge the amount of the ox-contract. The
ox-contract shall be redeemed by the man-contract; he

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

shall give in pledge the amount of the man-contract. The man-contract
shall be redeemed by the field-contract; he shall give in pledge the
amount of the field-contract.

### II c.

5 (24). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man break the
word-contract, how many are involved in his sin <span
id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_487)?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'His sin makes, his Nabânazdi*s*tas <span
id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_488) answerable for the <span
id="fr_492"></span>[3](#fn_489) three hundred-fold atonement.'

6 (26). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man break the
hand-contract, how many are involved in his sin?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'His sin makes his Nabânazdi*s*tas answerable for
the six hundred-fold atonement <span id="fr_493"></span>[4](#fn_490).'

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

7 (28). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man break the
sheep-contract, how many are involved in his sin?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'His sin makes his Nabânazdi*s*tas answerable for
the seven hundred-fold atonement <span id="fr_494"></span>[1](#fn_491)!'

8 (30). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man break the
ox-contract, how many are involved in his sin?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'His sin makes his Nabânazdi*s*tas answerable for
the eight hundred-fold atonement <span id="fr_495"></span>[2](#fn_492).'

9 (32). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man break the
man-contract, how many are involved in his sin?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'His sin makes his Nabânazdi*s*tas answerable for
the nine hundred-fold atonement <span id="fr_496"></span>[3](#fn_493).'

10 (34). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man break
the field-contract, how many are involved in his sin?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'His sin makes his Nabânazdi*s*tas answerable for
the thousand-fold atonement <span id="fr_497"></span>[4](#fn_494).'

### II d.

11 (36). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man break
the word-contract, what is the penalty that he shall pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'Three hundred stripes

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, three hundred stripes with the
Sraoshô-*k*arana <span id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_495).'

id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_495) If a man break the hand-contract, what
is the penalty that he shall pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'Nine hundred stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra,

16 (51). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man break
the field-contract, what is the penalty that he shall pay?

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

Ahura Mazda answered: 'A thousand stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, a
thousand stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana <span
id="fr_504"></span>[1](#fn_500).'

### III a.

17 (54). If a man rise up to smite a man, it is an Âgerepta <span
id="fr_505"></span>[2](#fn_501). If a man come upon a man to smite him,
it is an Avaoiri*s*ta. If a man actually smite a man with evil
aforethought, it is an Aredu*s*. Upon the fifth Aredu*s* <span
id="fr_506"></span>[3](#fn_502) he becomes a Peshôtanu <span
id="fr_507"></span>[4](#fn_503).

18 (58). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! He that
committeth an Âgerepta, what penalty shall he pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Five stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, five
stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the second Âgerepta, ten stripes
with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, ten stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the
third, fifteen stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, fifteen stripes with the
Sraoshô-*k*arana.

19 (63). 'On the fourth, thirty stripes with the

thirty stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the fifth, fifty stripes
with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, fifty stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the
sixth, sixty stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, sixty stripes with the
Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the seventh, ninety stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, ninety stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

20 (67). If a man commit an Âgerepta for the eighth time, without having
atoned for the preceding, what penalty shall he pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'He is a Peshôtanu: two hundred stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, two hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

21 (70). If a man commit an Âgerepta <span
id="fr_508"></span>[1](#fn_504) and refuse to atone for it <span
id="fr_509"></span>[2](#fn_505), what penalty shall he pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'He is a Peshôtanu: two hundred stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, two hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

22 (73). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man commit
an Avaoiri*s*ta, what penalty shall he pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Ten stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, ten stripes
with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the second Avaoiri*s*ta, fifteen stripes
with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, fifteen stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.

23 (75). 'On the third, thirty stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, thirty
stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the fourth, fifty stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, fifty stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the fifth,
seventy stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, seventy

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the sixth, ninety stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, ninety stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

24 (76). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man commit
an Avaoiri*s*ta for the seventh time, without having atoned for the
preceding, what penalty shall he pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'He is a Peshôtanu: two hundred stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, two hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

25 (77). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man commit
an Avaoiri*s*ta, and refuse to atone for it, what penalty shall he pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'He is a Peshôtanu: two hundred stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, two hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

26 (79). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man commit
an Aredu*s*, what penalty shall he pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Fifteen stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, fifteen

fifty stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, fifty stripes with the
Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the fourth, seventy stripes, with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, seventy stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; on the fifth,
ninety stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, ninety stripes with the

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

29 (82). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man commit
an Aredu*s*, and refuse to atone for it, what penalty shall he pay?

Aspahê-a*s*tra, two hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

30 (85). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man smite
another and hurt him sorely, what is the penalty that he shall pay?

stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; the second time, seventy stripes with
the Aspahê-a*s*tra, seventy stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; the third
time, ninety stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, ninety stripes with the
Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

35 (95). If he commit that deed for the fourth time, without having
atoned for the preceding, what is the penalty that he shall pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'He is a Peshôtanu: two hundred stripes with the

36 (96). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man smite
another so that the blood comes, and if he refuse to atone for it, what
is the penalty that he shall pay?

Aspahê-a*s*tra, two hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

57 (99). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man smite
another so that he breaks a bone, what is the penalty that he shall pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'Seventy stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, seventy

43 (115). And they shall thenceforth in their doings walk after the way
of holiness, after the word of holiness, after the ordinance of
holiness.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

## II e <span id="fr_510"></span>[1](#fn_506).

44 (118). If men of the same faith, either friends or brothers, come to
an agreement together, that one may obtain from the other, either
goods <span id="fr_511"></span>[2](#fn_507), or a wife <span
id="fr_512"></span>[3](#fn_508), or knowledge <span
id="fr_513"></span>[4](#fn_509), let him who wants to have goods have
them delivered to him; let him who wants to have a wife receive and wed
her; let him who wants to have knowledge be taught the holy word.

45 (123). He shall learn on, during the first part of the day and the
last, during the first part of the night and the last, that his mind may
be increased in knowledge and wax strong in holiness: so shall he sit
up, giving thanks and praying to the gods, that he may be increased in
knowledge: he shall rest during the middle part of the day, during the
middle part of the night, and thus shall he continue until he can say
all the words which former Aêthrapaitis <span
id="fr_514"></span>[5](#fn_510) have said.

### III b.

46 (128). Before the water and the blazing fire <span
id="fr_515"></span>[6](#fn_511),

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! let no one make bold to deny having received from his
neighbour the ox or the garment (he has received from him).

47 (130). . . . Verily I say it unto thee, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! the
man who has a wife is far above him who begets no sons <span
id="fr_516"></span>[1](#fn_512); he who keeps a house is far above him
who has none; he who has children is far above the childless man; he who
has riches is far above him who has none.

48 (134). And of two men, he who fills himself with meat is filled with
the good spirit <span id="fr_517"></span>[2](#fn_513) much more than he
who does not do so <span id="fr_518"></span>[3](#fn_514); the latter is
all but dead; the former is above him by the worth of an Asperena <span
id="fr_519"></span>[4](#fn_515), by the worth of a sheep, by the worth
of an ox, by the worth of a man.

49 (137). It is this man that can strive against the onsets of
Astô-vîdhôtu <span id="fr_520"></span>[5](#fn_516); that can strive
against

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

the self-moving arrow <span id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_517); that can
strive against the winter fiend, with thinnest garment on; that can
strive against the wicked tyrant and smite him on the head; it is this
man that can strive against the ungodly Ashemaogha who does not
eat <span id="fr_522"></span>[2](#fn_518).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

49 (bis). . . . The very first time when that deed <span
id="fr_523"></span>[3](#fn_519) has been done, without waiting until it
is done again <span id="fr_524"></span>[4](#fn_520).

50 (143). Down there <span id="fr_525"></span>[5](#fn_521) the pain for
that deed shall be as hard as any in this world: should one cut off the
limbs from his perishable body with knives of brass, yet still worse
shall it be.

51 (146). Down there the pain for that deed shall be as hard as any in
this world: should one nail <span id="fr_526"></span>[6](#fn_522) his
perishable body with nails of brass, yet still worse shall it be.

52 (149). Down there the pain for that deed shall be as hard as any in
this world: should one by force throw his perishable body headlong down
a precipice a hundred times the height of a man, yet still worse shall
it be.

53 052). Down there the pain or that deed shall be as hard as any in
this world: should one by force impale <span
id="fr_527"></span>[7](#fn_523) his perishable body, yet still worse
shall it be.

54 (154). Down there the pain for that deed shall be as hard as any in
this world: to wit, that deed which is done, when a man, knowingly
lying, confronts the brimstoned, golden <span
id="fr_528"></span>[8](#fn_524), truth-knowing <span
id="fr_529"></span>[9](#fn_525)

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

water with an appeal unto Rashnu <span id="fr_530"></span>[1](#fn_526)
and a lie unto Mithra <span id="fr_531"></span>[2](#fn_527).

55 (156). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! He who,
knowingly lying, confronts the brimstoned, golden, truth-knowing water
with an appeal unto Rashnu and a lie unto Mithra, what is the penalty
that he shall pay <span id="fr_532"></span>[3](#fn_528)?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'Seven hundred stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra,
seven hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_474"></span>[34:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_477) 'He is a thief when
he takes with a view not to restore; he is a robber when, being asked to
restore, he answers, I will not' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_475"></span>[34:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_478) Every moment that he
holds it unlawfully, he steals it anew. 'The basest thing with Persians
is to lie; the next to it is to be in debt, for this reason among many
others, that he who is so, must needs sink to lying at last' (Herod. I,
183). The debtor in question is of course the debtor of bad faith, 'he
who says to a man, Give me this, I will restore it to thee at the proper
time, and he says to himself, I will not restore it' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_476"></span>[34:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_479) The following
classification is in fact twofold, the contracts being defined in the
first two clauses by their mode of being entered into, and in the last
four by their amount. Yet it appears from the following clauses that
even the word-contract and the hand-contract became at last, or were
misunderstood as, indicative of a certain amount. The commentators,
however, were unable to determine that amount, or, at least, they do not
state how much it was, which they do with regard to the last four.

<span id="fn_477"></span>[34:4](sbe0410.htm#fr_480) The contract entered
into by simple word of mouth. 'The immortal Zartu*s*t Isfitamân asked of
the good, beneficent Hormazd, "Which is the worst of the sins that men
commit?" The good, beneficent Hormazd answered, "There is no sin worse
than when a man, having given his word to another, there being no
witness but myself, Hormazd, one of them breaks his word and says, I
don't know anything about it . . . there is no sin worse than this?"'
(Gr. Rav. 94).

<span id="fn_478"></span>[35:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_481) 'When they strike
hand in hand and make then agreement by word' (Gr. Rav. 1. 1.) It would
be of interest to know whether word and hand are to be taken in the
strict meaning or if they allude to certain formulas and gestures like
those in the Roman stipulatio.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[35:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_482) 'Viz. to the amount
of 3 istîrs in weight,' (Comm.) An istîr (στατήρ) is as much as 4
dirhems (δραχμή). On the value of the dirhem, see Introd. V, 22.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[35:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_483) 'To the amount of 12
istîrs (=48 dirhems),' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_481"></span>[35:4](sbe0410.htm#fr_484) 'To the amount of
500 istîrs (= 2000 dirhems).' The exact translation would be rather,
'The contract to the amount of a human being,' as the term is applied to
promises of marriage and to the contract between teacher and pupil.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[35:5](sbe0410.htm#fr_485) 'Upwards of 500
istîrs.'

<span id="fn_483"></span>[35:6](sbe0410.htm#fr_486) A sort of gloss
added to define more accurately the value of the object and to indicate
that it is greater than that of the preceding one.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[35:7](sbe0410.htm#fr_487) If he fail to fulfil
it.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[35:8](sbe0410.htm#fr_488) Or, 'as damages
(?).'

<span id="fn_486"></span>[35:9](sbe0410.htm#fr_489) 'The breach of the
hand-contract.'

<span id="fn_487"></span>[36:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_490) Literally, how much
is involved? The joint responsibility of the family was a principle in
the Persian law, as it was in the old German law, which agrees with the
statement in Am. Marcellinus: 'Leges apud eos impendio formidatae, et
abominandae aliae, per quas ob noxam unius omnis propinquitas perit'
(XXIII, 6).

<span id="fn_488"></span>[36:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_491) The next of kin to
the ninth degree.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[36:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_492) See § 11. This
passage seems to have puzzled tradition. The Commentary says, 'How long,
how many years, has one to fear for the breach of a word-contract?--the
Nabânazdi*s*tas have to fear for three hundred years;' but it does not
explain farther the nature of that fear; it only tries to reduce the
circle of that liability to narrower limits: 'only the son born after
the breach is liable for it; the righteous are not liable for it; when
the father dies, the son, if righteous, has nothing to fear from it.'
And finally, the Ravaets leave the kinsmen wholly aside; the penalty
falling entirely upon the real offender, and the number denoting only
the duration of his punishment in hell: 'He who breaks a word-contract,
his soul shall abide for three hundred years in hell' (Gr. Rav. 94).

<span id="fn_490"></span>[36:4](sbe0410.htm#fr_493) See § 12. 'His soul
shall abide for six hundred years in hell' (Gr. Rav. l. l.)

<span id="fn_491"></span>[37:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_494) See § 13. 'His soul
shall abide for seven hundred years in hell' (Gr. Rav. l. l.)

<span id="fn_492"></span>[37:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_495) See § 14. 'His soul
shall abide for eight hundred years in hell.'

<span id="fn_493"></span>[37:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_496) See § 15. 'His soul
shall abide for nine hundred years in hell.'

<span id="fn_494"></span>[37:4](sbe0410.htm#fr_497) See § 16. 'His soul
shall abide for a thousand years in hell.'

<span id="fn_495"></span>[38:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_499) One tanâfûhr and a
half, that is 1800, dirhems.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[38:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_500) Three tanâfûhrs, or
3600 dirhems.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[38:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_501) Three tanâfûhrs and
a half, or 4200 dirhems.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[38:4](sbe0410.htm#fr_502) Four tanâfûhrs, or
4800 dirhems.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[38:5](sbe0410.htm#fr_503) Four tanâfûhrs and a
half, or 5400 dirhems.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[39:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_504) Five tanâfûhrs, or
6000 dirhems.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[39:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_505) In this paragraph
are defined the first three of the eight outrages with which the rest of
the Fargard deals. Only these three are defined, because they are
designated by technical terms. We subjoin the definitions of them found
in a Sanskrit translation of a Patet (Paris, Bibl. Nat. f. B. 5, 154),
in which their etymological meanings are better preserved than in the
Zend definition itself:--

Âgerepta, 'seizing,' is when a man seizes a weapon with a view to smite
another.

Avaoiri*s*ta, 'brandishing,' is when a man brandishes a weapon with a
view to smite another.

Aredu*s* is when a man actually smites another with a weapon, but
without wounding him, or inflicts a wound which is healed within three
days.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[39:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_506) Viz. on the sixth
commission of it, as appears from § 28.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[39:4](sbe0410.htm#fr_507) He shall receive two
hundred stripes, or shall pay 1200 dirhems (see Introd. V, 19).

<span id="fn_504"></span>[40:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_508) Even though the
Âgerepta has been committed for the first time.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[40:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_509) If he does not offer
himself to bear the penalty, and does not perform the Patet (see Introd.
V, 22).

<span id="fn_506"></span>[45:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_510) We return here to
contracts; the proper place of §§ 44-45 is after § 16.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[45:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_511) The goods-contract
is a general expression for the sheep, ox, and field-contracts (see
above, § 2).

<span id="fn_508"></span>[45:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_512) Woman is an object
of contract, like cattle or fields; she is disposed of by contracts of
the fifth sort, being more valuable than cattle and less so than fields.
She is sold by her father or her guardian, often from the cradle.
'Instances are not wanting of the betrothal of a boy of three years of
age to a girl of two' (see Dosabhoy Framjee's work on The Parsees, p.
77; cf. 'A Bill to Define and Amend the Law relating to Succession,
Inheritance, Marriage, &c.,' Bombay, 1864).

<span id="fn_509"></span>[45:4](sbe0410.htm#fr_513) The contract between
pupil and teacher falls into the same class (the man-contract, see [p.
35](#page_35), n. [4](#fn_481)).

<span id="fn_510"></span>[45:5](sbe0410.htm#fr_514) A teaching priest
(Parsi Hêrbad).

<span id="fn_511"></span>[45:6](sbe0410.htm#fr_515) Doubtful. This
clause is intended, as it seems, against false <span id="page_46">p.
46</span> oaths. The water and the blazing fire are the water and the
fire before which the oath is taken (see § 54 n.); putting aside §§
47-49, which are misplaced from Farg. III, 34, one comes to § 50, in
which the penalty for a false oath is described.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[46:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_516) 'In Persia there are
prizes given by the king to those who have most children' (Herod. I,
136). 'He who has no child, the bridge (of paradise) shall be barred to
him. The first question the angels there will ask him is, whether he has
left in this world a substitute for himself; if he answers, No, they
will pass by and he will stay at the head of the bridge, full of grief
and sorrow' (Saddar 18; Hyde 19). The primitive meaning of this belief
is explained by Brahmanical doctrine; the man without a son falls into
hell, because there is nobody to pay him the family worship.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[46:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_517) Or, 'with Vôhu
Manô,' who is at the same time the god of good thoughts and the god of
cattle (see Introd. IV, 33).

<span id="fn_514"></span>[46:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_518) 'There are people
who strive to pass a day without eating, and who abstain from any meat;
we strive too and abstain, namely, from any sin in deed, thought, or
word: . . . in other religions, they fast from bread; in ours, we fast
from sin' (Saddar 83; Hyde 25).

<span id="fn_515"></span>[46:4](sbe0410.htm#fr_519) A dirhem.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[46:5](sbe0410.htm#fr_520) See Introd. IV, 26.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[47:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_521) See Introd. IV, 26.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[47:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_522) See Introd. III, 10.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[47:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_523) The taking of a
false oath.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[47:4](sbe0410.htm#fr_524) See Introd. V, 18.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[47:5](sbe0410.htm#fr_525) In hell.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[47:6](sbe0410.htm#fr_526) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[47:7](sbe0410.htm#fr_527) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[47:8](sbe0410.htm#fr_528) The water before
which the oath is taken contains some incense, brimstone, and one danak
of molten gold (Gr. Rav. 101).

<span id="fn_525"></span>[47:9](sbe0410.htm#fr_529) Doubtful. Possibly
'bright.'

<span id="fn_526"></span>[48:1](sbe0410.htm#fr_530) The god of truth.
The formula is as follows: 'Before the Amshaspand Bahman, before the
Amshaspand Ardibehesht, here lighted up . . . &c., I swear that I have
nothing of what is thine, N. son of N., neither gold, nor silver, nor
brass, nor clothes, nor an), of the things created by Ormazd' (l. l.
96).

<span id="fn_527"></span>[48:2](sbe0410.htm#fr_531) See Introd. IV, 8.
He is a Mithra-dru*g*, 'one who lies to Mithra.'

<span id="fn_528"></span>[48:3](sbe0410.htm#fr_532) In this world.
