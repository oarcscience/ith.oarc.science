### I.

1\. 'There is many a one, O holy Zarathu*s*tra!' said Ahura Mazda, 'who
wears a Paitidâna <span id="fr_984"></span>[2](#fn_972.md) but who has not
girded his loins with the law <span id="fr_985"></span>[3](#fn_973.md);
when such a man says, "I am an Âthravan," he lies; do not call him an
Âthravan, O holy Zarathu*s*tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.

2 (5). 'He holds a Khrafstraghna <span id="fr_986"></span>[4](#fn_974.md)
in his hand, but he has not girded his loins with the law; when he says,
"I am an Âthravan," he lies; do not call him an Âthravan, O holy
Zarathu*s*tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

3 (7). 'He holds a twig <span id="fr_987"></span>[1](#fn_975.md) in his
hand, but he has not girded his loins with the law; when he says, "I am
an Âthravan," he lies; do not call him an Âthravan, O holy
Zarathu*s*tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.

4 (9). 'He wields the A*s*tra mairya <span
id="fr_988"></span>[2](#fn_976.md), but he has not girded his loins with
the law; when he says, "I am an Âthravan," he lies; do not call him an
Âthravan, O holy Zarathu*s*tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.

5 (11). 'He who sleeps on throughout the night, who does not perform the
Yasna nor chant the hymns, who does not worship by word or by deed, who
does neither learn nor teach, with a longing for (everlasting) life, he
lies when he says, "I am an Âthravan," do not call him an Âthravan, O
holy Zarathu*s*tra!' thus said Ahura Mazda.

6 (14). ‘Him thou shalt call an Âthravan, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! who
throughout the night sits up and demands of the holy Wisdom <span
id="fr_989"></span>[3](#fn_977.md), which makes man free from anxiety, with
dilated heart, and cheerful at the head of the *K*inva*t* bridge <span
id="fr_990"></span>[4](#fn_978.md), and which makes him reach that world,
that holy world, that excellent world, the world of paradise.

7 (18). '(Therefore) demand of me, thou upright one! of me, who am the
Maker, the best of all beings, the most knowing, the most pleased in
answering what is asked of me; demand of me, that

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

thou mayst be the better, that thou mayst be the happier <span
id="fr_991"></span>[1](#fn_979.md).'

8 (21). Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Maker of the material world,
thou Holy One! What is it that makes the unseen power of Death
increase?'

9 (22). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is the man that teaches a wrong
law <span id="fr_992"></span>[2](#fn_980.md); it is the man who continues
for three years <span id="fr_993"></span>[3](#fn_981.md) without wearing
the sacred girdle <span id="fr_994"></span>[4](#fn_982.md), without
chanting the Gâthas, without worshipping the good waters.

10 (25). ‘And he who should set that man at

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

liberty, when bound in prison <span id="fr_995"></span>[1](#fn_983.md),
does no better deed than if he should flay a man alive and cut off his
head <span id="fr_996"></span>[2](#fn_984.md).

11 (27). ‘The blessing uttered on a wicked, ungodly Ashemaogha does not
go past the mouth (of the blesser); the blessing for two Ashemaoghas
does not go past his tongue; the blessing for three is no word at all;
the blessing for four is a curse against himself.

12 (29). ‘Whosoever should give some Haoma juice to a wicked, ungodly
Ashemaogha, or some Myazda consecrated with blessings, does no better
deed than if he should lead a thousand horse against the cities of the
worshippers of Mazda, and should slaughter the men thereof, and drive
off the cattle as plunder.

### II.

13 (32). 'Demand of me, thou upright one! of me, who am the Maker, the
best of all beings, the most knowing, the most pleased in answering what
is asked of me; demand of me, that thou mayst be the better, that thou
mayst be the happier.'

14 (33). Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Who is the
Sraosha-varez <span id="fr_997"></span>[3](#fn_985.md) of Sraosha <span
id="fr_998"></span>[4](#fn_986.md)? the holy, strong Sraosha, who is the
incarnate Word, a mighty-speared and lordly god.'

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

15 (34). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is the bird named Parôdar*s* <span
id="fr_999"></span>[1](#fn_987.md), which ill-speaking people call
Kahrkatâs <span id="fr_1000"></span>[2](#fn_988.md), O holy Zarathu*s*tra!
the bird that lifts up his voice against the mighty dawn:

16 (37). ‘“Arise, O men! recite the Ashem ya*d* vahi*s*tem that smites
down the Daêvas <span id="fr_1001"></span>[3](#fn_989.md). Lo! here is
Bûshyãsta, the long-handed <span id="fr_1002"></span>[4](#fn_990.md),
coming upon you, who lulls to sleep again the whole living world, as
soon as it has awoke: ‘Sleep!’ she says, ‘sleep on, O man! the
time <span id="fr_1003"></span>[5](#fn_991.md) is not yet come.’”

17 (41). ‘For the three excellent things be never slack, namely, good
thoughts, good words, and good deeds; for the three abominable things be
ever slack, namely, bad thoughts, bad words, and bad deeds.”

18 (43). ‘In the first part of the night, Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda,
calls the master of the house for help, saying:

19 (43). ‘"Up! arise, thou master of the house! put on thy girdle on thy
clothes, wash thy hands, take wood, bring it unto me, and let me burn
bright

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

with the clean wood, carried by thy well-washed hands <span
id="fr_1004"></span>[1](#fn_992.md). Here comes Âzi <span
id="fr_1005"></span>[2](#fn_993.md), made by the Daêvas, who is about to
strive against me, and wants to put out my life."

20 (46). ‘In the second part of the night, Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda,
calls the husbandman for help, saying:

21 (46). ‘"Up! arise, thou husbandman! Put on thy girdle on thy clothes,
wash thy hands, take wood, bring it unto me, and let me burn bright with
the clean wood, carried by thy well-washed hands. Here comes Âzi, made
by the Daêvas, who is about to strive against me, and wants to put out
my life."

22 (48). ‘In the third part of the night, Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda,
calls the holy Sraosha for help, saying: "Come thou, holy, tall-formed
Sraosha, then he brings unto me some clean wood with his well-washed
hands <span id="fr_1006"></span>[3](#fn_994.md): here comes Âzi, made by
the Daêvas, who is about to strive against me, and wants to put out my
life."

23 (50). ‘And then the holy Sraosha wakes up the bird named Parôdar*s*,
which ill-speaking people call Kahrkatâs, and the bird lifts up his
voice against the mighty dawn:

24 (52). ‘“Arise, O men! recite the Ashem ya*d* vahi*s*tem that smites
down the Daêvas. Lo! here is Bûshyãsta, the long-handed, coming upon
you, who lulls to sleep again the whole living world as

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

soon as it has awoke: ‘Sleep!’ she says, ‘sleep on, O man! the time is
not yet come.’”

25 (52). ‘"For the three excellent things be never slack, namely, good
thoughts, good words, and good deeds; for the three abominable things be
ever slack, namely, bad thoughts, bad words, and bad deeds."

26 (53). ‘And then bed-fellows address one another: "Rise up, here is
the cock calling me up." Whichever of the two first gets up shall first
enter paradise: whichever of the two shall first, with well-washed
hands, bring clean wood unto the Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, the Fire,
well pleased with him and not angry, and fed as it required, will thus
bless him:

27 (58). ‘"May herds of oxen grow for thee, and increase of sons: may
thy mind be master of its vow, may thy soul be master of its vow, and
mayst thou live on in the joy of the soul all the nights of thy life."

‘This is the blessing which the Fire speaks unto him who brings him dry
wood, well examined by the light of the day, well cleansed with godly
intent.

28 (64). ‘And whosoever will kindly and piously present one of the
faithful with a pair of these my Parôdar*s* birds, a male and a female,
it is as though he had given <span id="fr_1007"></span>[1](#fn_995.md) a
house with a hundred columns, a thousand beams, ten thousand large
windows, ten thousand small windows.

29 (67). 'And whosoever shall give to my Parôdar*s* bird his fill of
meat, I, Ahura Mazda, need not

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

interrogate him any longer; he shall directly go to paradise.'

### III.

30 (70). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru*g*, with his club uplifted
against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru*g*! Thou then, alone in the
material world, dost bear offspring without any male coming unto thee?'

31 (74). Then the Dru*g* demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy,
tall-formed Sraosha! It is not so, nor do I, alone in the material
world, bear offspring without any male coming unto me.

32 (77). ‘There are four males who are mine.

'And they make me conceive progeny as other males make their females.'

33 (78). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru*g*, with his club uplifted
against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru*g*! Who is the first of
those males of thine?'

34 (79). Then the Dru*g* demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy,
tall-formed Sraosha! He is the first of my males who, being entreated by
one of the faithful, does not give him anything, be it ever so little,
of the riches he has treasured up <span
id="fr_1008"></span>[1](#fn_996.md).

35 (82). 'That man makes me conceive progeny as other males make their
females.'

36 (83). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru*g*, with his club uplifted
against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru*g*! What is the thing that
can counteract that?'

37 (84). Then the Dru*g* demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy,
tall-formed Sraosha! This is

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

the thing that counteracts it, namely, when a man unasked, kindly and
piously, gives to one of the faithful something, be it ever so little,
of the riches he has treasured up.

38 (87). 'He does thereby as thoroughly destroy the fruit of my womb as
a four-footed wolf does, who tears the child out of a mother's womb.'

39 (88). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru*g*, with his club uplifted
against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru*g*! Who is the second of
those males of thine?'

40 (89). Then the Dru*g* demon, the guileful one, answered ‘O holy,
tall-formed Sraosha! He is the second of my males who, making water,
lets it fall along the upper forepart of his foot.

41 (92). 'That man makes me conceive progeny as other males make their
females.'

42 (93). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru*g*, with his club uplifted
against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru*g*! What is the thing that
can counteract that?'

43 (94). Then the Dru*g* demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy,
tall-formed Sraosha! This is the thing that counteracts it, namely, when
the man rising up <span id="fr_1009"></span>[1](#fn_997.md) and stepping
three steps further off, shall say three Ahuna-Vairya, two humatanãm,
three hukhshathrôtemãm, and then chant the Ahuna-Vairya and offer up one
Yê*n*hê hâtãm.

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

44 (98). 'He does thereby as thoroughly destroy the fruit of my womb as
a four-footed wolf does, who tears the child out of a mother's womb.'

45 (99). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru*g*, with his club uplifted
against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru*g*! Who is the third of
those males of thine?'

46 (100). Then the Dru*g* demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy,
tall-formed Sraosha! He is the third of my males who during his sleep
emits seed.

47 (102). 'That man makes me conceive progeny as other males make their
females.'

48 (103). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru*g*, with his club uplifted
against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru*g*! What is the thing that
can counteract that?'

49 (104). Then the Dru*g* demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy,
tall-formed Sraosha! this is the thing that counteracts it, namely, if
the man, when he has risen from sleep, shall say three Ahuna-Vairya, two
humatanãm, three hukhshathrôtemãm, and then chant the Ahuna-Vairya and
offer up one Yê*n*hê hâtãm.

50 (107). 'He does thereby as thoroughly destroy the fruit of my womb as
a four-footed wolf does who tears the child out of a mother's womb.'

51 (108). Then he shall speak unto Spe*n*ta Ârmaiti <span
id="fr_1010"></span>[1](#fn_998.md), saying: ‘O Spe*n*ta Ârmaiti, this man
do I deliver unto thee; this man deliver thou back unto me, against the
mighty day of resurrection; deliver him back as one who knows the
Gâthas, who

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

knows the Yasna, and the revealed law <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[1](#fn_999.md), a wise and clever man, who is the Word
incarnate.

52 (112). 'Then thou shalt call his name "Fire-creature, Fire-seed,
Fire-offspring, Fire-land," or any name wherein is the word Fire <span
id="fr_1012"></span>[2](#fn_1000.md).'

53 (113). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru*g*, with his club uplifted
against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru*g*! Who is the fourth of
those males of thine?'

54 (114). Then the Dru*g* demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy,
tall-formed Sraosha! This one is my fourth male who, either man or
woman, being more than fifteen years of age, walks without wearing the
sacred girdle and the sacred shirt <span
id="fr_1013"></span>[3](#fn_1001.md).

55 (115). 'At the fourth step <span id="fr_1014"></span>[4](#fn_1002.md) we
Daêvas, at once, wither him even to the tongue and the marrow, and he
goes thenceforth with power to destroy the world of the holy spirit, and
he destroys it like the Yâtus and the Za*n*das <span
id="fr_1015"></span>[5](#fn_1003.md).'

56 (117). The holy Sraosha asked the Dru*g*, with his club uplifted
against her: 'O thou wretched and wicked Dru*g*, what is the thing that
can counteract that?'

57 (118). Then the Dru*g* demon, the guileful one, answered: ‘O holy,
tall-formed Sraosha! There is no means of counteracting it;

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

58 (120). ‘When a man or a woman, being more than fifteen years of age,
walks without wearing the sacred girdle or the sacred shirt.

59 (120). 'At the fourth step we Daêvas, at once, wither him even to the
tongue and the marrow, and he goes thenceforth with power to destroy the
world of the holy spirit, and he destroys it like the Yâtus and the
Za*n*das.'

### IV.

60 (122). Demand of me, thou upright one! of me who am the Maker, the
best of all beings, the most knowing, the most pleased in answering what
is asked of me; demand of me that thou mayst be the better, that thou
mayst be the happier.

61 (123). Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Who grieves thee with the
sorest grief? Who pains thee with the sorest pain?'

62 (124). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It is the *G*ahi <span
id="fr_1016"></span>[1](#fn_1004.md), O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! who goes
a-whoring after the faithful and the unfaithful, after the worshippers
of Mazda and the worshippers of the Daêvas, after the wicked and the
righteous <span id="fr_1017"></span>[2](#fn_1005.md).

6 3 (12 5). ‘Her look dries up one third of the mighty floods that run
from the mountains; her look withers one third of the beautiful, golden
hued, growing plants;

64 (12 7). ‘Her look withers one third of the grass

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

wherewith Spe*n*ta Ârmaiti <span id="fr_1018"></span>[1](#fn_1006.md) is
clad <span id="fr_1019"></span>[2](#fn_1007.md), and her touch withers in
the faithful one third of his good thoughts, of his good words, of his
good deeds, one third of his strength, of his fiend-killing power, and
of his holiness <span id="fr_1020"></span>[3](#fn_1008.md).

65 (129). 'Verily I say unto thee, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! such
creatures ought to be killed even more than gliding snakes <span
id="fr_1021"></span>[4](#fn_1009.md), than howling wolves, than the wild
she-wolf that falls upon the fold, or than the she-frog that falls upon
the waters with her thousandfold brood.'

66 (133). Demand of me, thou upright one! of me who am the Maker, the
best of all beings, the most knowing, the most pleased in answering what
is asked of me; demand of me that thou mayst be the better, that thou
mayst be the happier.

67-68 (133). Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'If a man shall come unto
a woman who has an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course or
at the usual period, and he does so wittingly and knowingly <span
id="fr_1022"></span>[5](#fn_1010.md), and she allows it wilfully,
wittingly, and

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

knowingly, what is the atonement for it, what is the penalty that he
shall pay to atone for the deed they have done?'

69 (136). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘If a man shall come unto a woman who
has an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course or at the usual
period, and he does so wittingly and knowingly, and she allows it
wilfully, wittingly, and knowingly;

70 (137). ‘He shall slay a thousand head of small cattle; he shall godly
and piously offer up to the fire <span id="fr_1023"></span>[1](#fn_1011.md)
the entrails <span id="fr_1024"></span>[2](#fn_1012.md) thereof together
with Zaothra-libations; he shall bring the shoulder bones to the good
waters <span id="fr_1025"></span>[3](#fn_1013.md).

71 (140). ‘He shall godly and piously bring unto the fire a thousand
loads of soft wood, of Urvâsna, Vohu-gaona, Vohu-kereti, Hadhâ-naêpata,
or of any sweet-scented plant <span id="fr_1026"></span>[4](#fn_1014.md).

72 (142). ‘He shall tie and consecrate a thousand bundles of baresma; he
shall godly and piously offer up to the good waters a thousand
Zaothra-libations, together with the Haoma and the meat, cleanly
prepared and well strained by a pious man, together with the roots of
the tree known as Hadhâ-naêpata <span id="fr_1027"></span>[5](#fn_1015.md).

73 (144). ‘He shall kill a thousand snakes of

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

those that go upon the belly, two thousand of the other kind <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[1](#fn_1016.md): he shall kill a thousand land frogs
and two thousand water frogs; he shall kill a thousand corn-carrying
ants and two thousand of the other kind <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[2](#fn_1017.md).

74 (147). ‘He shall throw thirty bridges over canals; he shall undergo a
thousand stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, a thousand stripes with the
Sraoshô-*k*arana <span id="fr_1030"></span>[3](#fn_1018.md).

75 (149). ‘This is the atonement, this is the penalty that he shall pay
to atone for the deed that he has done.

76 (150). 'If he shall pay it, he shall enter the world of the holy
ones; if he shall not pay it, he shall fall down into the world of the
wicked, into that dark world, made of darkness, the offspring of
darkness <span id="fr_1031"></span>[4](#fn_1019.md).'

must never part with (see § 54); the full meaning, therefore, is,
'girded with the law as with a Kôstî' (cf. Yasna IX, 26 \[81\]), that is
to say, 'never forsaking the law,' or, as the Commentary expresses it,
'one whose thought is all on the law' (cf. § 5).

<span id="fn_982"></span>[191:4](sbe0424.htm#fr_994.md) The Kôstî, which
must be worn by every Parsi, man or woman, from their fifteenth year of
age (see below, § 54 seq.); it is the badge of the faithful, the girdle
by which he is united both with Ormazd and with his fellow believers. He
who does not wear it must be refused water and bread by the members of
the community; he who wears it becomes a participator in the merit of
all the good deeds performed all over the Zarathustrian world (Saddar 10
and 46; Hyde 10 and 50). The Kôstî consists 'of seventy-two interwoven
filaments, and should three times circumvent the waist. . . . Each of
the threads is equal in value to one of the seventy-two Hâhs of the
Izashnê; each of the twelve threads in the six lesser cords is equal in
value to the dawâzdih hamâist . . .; each of the lesser cords is equal
in value to one of the six Gahanbârs; each of the three circumventions
of the loins is equal in value to humat, good thought, hukhat, good
speech, huaresta, good work; the binding of each of the four knots upon
it confers pleasure on each of the four elements, fire, air, water, and
the earth' (Edal Daru, apud Wilson, The Parsi Religion Unfolded, p.
163). In the Brahmanical system also the faithful are bound to their god
by means of a sacred girdle, the Mekhalâ.

Another piece of clothing which every Parsi is enjoined to wear is the
Sadarah, or sacred shirt, a muslin shirt with short sleeves, that does
not reach lower than the hips, with a small pocket at the opening in
front of the shirt (see § 54 seq.)

10. Cf. § 12.

<span id="fn_984"></span>[192:2](sbe0424.htm#fr_996.md) Doubtful. The
Commentary seems to understand the sentence as follows: 'He who should
free him from hell would thus perform no less a feat than if he should
cut off the head of a man and then make him alive again.'

<span id="fn_985"></span>[192:3](sbe0424.htm#fr_997.md) 'Who is he who sets
the world in motion?' (Comm.) See above, [p. 56](sbe0411.htm#page_56.md),

the coming dawn; the cock.

<span id="fn_988"></span>[193:2](sbe0424.htm#fr_1000.md) 'When he is not
called so, he is powerful' (Comm.) Cf. XIII, 2, 6.

<span id="fn_989"></span>[193:3](sbe0424.htm#fr_1001.md) The cock is called
'the drum of the world.' As crowing in the dawn that dazzles away the
fiends, he shared with it the honour of the victory, and was believed to
crow away the demons: 'The cock was created to fight against the fiends
and wizards; . . . he is with the dog an ally of Srôsh against demons'
(Bundahi*s* XIX) 'No demon can enter a house in which there is a cock:
and, above all, should this bird come to the residence of a demon, and
move his tongue to chaunt the praises of the glorious and exalted
Creator, that instant the evil spirit takes to flight' (Mirkhond,
History of the Early Kings of Persia, translated by Shea, p. 57; cf.
Saddar 32, Hyde 35, and J. Ovington, A Voyage to Suratt, 1696, p. 371).

24.

<span id="fn_991"></span>[193:5](sbe0424.htm#fr_1003.md) 'To perform thy
religious duties' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_992"></span>[194:1](sbe0424.htm#fr_1004.md) The Parsi, as soon
as he has risen, must put on the Kôstî, wash his hands, and put wood on
the fire.

<span id="fn_993"></span>[194:2](sbe0424.htm#fr_1005.md) See Introd. IV,
19.

<span id="fn_994"></span>[194:3](sbe0424.htm#fr_1006.md) The text seems to
be corrupt: it must probably be emendated into 'bring into me . . .'

<span id="fn_995"></span>[195:1](sbe0424.htm#fr_1007.md) 'In the day of
recompense' (Comm.); he shall be rewarded as though he had given a
house, &c. . . . he shall receive such a house in paradise.

<span id="fn_996"></span>[196:1](sbe0424.htm#fr_1008.md) Cf. Farg. III, 34.

mingens . . . facile visitur Persa' (Amm. Marc. XXIII, 6); Ar*d*â Vîrâf

and Polack, Persien I, 67: 'Von einem in Paris weilenden Perser
hinterbrachte man dem König, um seine Emancipation und Abtrünnigkeit vom
Gesetz zu beweisen, dass er Schweinefleisch esse und stehend die
Function verrichte.'

<span id="fn_998"></span>[198:1](sbe0424.htm#fr_1010.md) The genius of the
earth (cf. Farg. II, 10).

<span id="fn_999"></span>[199:1](sbe0424.htm#fr_1011.md) Literally, 'the
answers made to the questions (of Zarathu*s*tra).'

Sadarah; see above, [p. 191](#page_191), n. [4](#fn_982.md). It is the sin
known as kushâ*d* duvâri*s*nî (Mainyô-i-khard II, 35; Ar*d*â Vîrâf XXV,

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[200:2](sbe0424.htm#fr_1017.md) 'Whether she
gives up her body to the faithful or to the unfaithful, there is no
difference; when she has been with three men, she is guilty of death'
(Comm.)

<span id="fn_1007"></span>[201:2](sbe0424.htm#fr_1019.md) Doubtful. The
Pahlavi translation has, 'One third of the strength of Spe*n*ta
Ârmaiti.'

<span id="fn_1008"></span>[201:3](sbe0424.htm#fr_1020.md) 'If a *G*ahi
(courtezan) look at running waters, they fall; if at trees, they are
stunted; if she converse with a pious man, his intelligence and his
holiness are withered by it' (Saddar 67; Hyde 74). Cf. Manu IV, 40 seq.

<span id="fn_1009"></span>[201:4](sbe0424.htm#fr_1021.md) It is written in
the law (the Avesta): 'O Zartu*s*t Isfitamân! with regard to woman, I
say to thee that any woman that has given up her body to two men in one
day is sooner to be killed than a wolf, a lion, or a snake: any one who
kills such a woman will gain as much merit by it as if he had provided
with wood a thousand fire-temples, or destroyed the dens of adders,
scorpions, lions, wolves, or snakes' (Old Rav. 59 b).

<span id="fn_1010"></span>[201:5](sbe0424.htm#fr_1022.md) 'Knowing her
state and knowing that it is a sin' (Comm.)

adjoining to the temple, their Fire which they fed with Wood, and
sometimes Burn on it the Fat of the Sheep's Tail.' A Voyage Round the
