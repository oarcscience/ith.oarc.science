2 (3). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘The dog with the prickly back, with the
long and thin muzzle, the dog Vanghâpara <span
id="fr_837"></span>[1](#fn_825.md), which evil-speaking people call the
Du*z*aka <span id="fr_838"></span>[2](#fn_826.md); this is the good
creature among the creatures of the good spirit that from midnight till
the sun is up goes and kills thousands of the creatures of the evil
spirit.

3 (6). 'And whosoever, O Zarathu*s*tra! shall kill, the dog with the
prickly back, with the long and thin muzzle, the dog Vanghâpara, which
evil-speaking people call the Du*z*aka, kills his own soul for nine
generations, nor shall he find a way over the *K*inva*d* bridge <span
id="fr_839"></span>[3](#fn_827.md), unless he has, while alive, atoned for
his sin by offering up a sacrifice to Sraosha <span
id="fr_840"></span>[4](#fn_828.md).'

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

4 (10). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man kill the
dog with the prickly back, with the long and thin muzzle, the dog
Vanghâpara, which evil-speaking people call the Du*z*aka, what is the
penalty that he shall pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'A thousand stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, a
thousand stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

spirit that from midnight till the sun is up goes and kills thousands of
the creatures of the good spirit?

id="fr_841"></span>[1](#fn_829.md), which evil-speaking people call the
Zairimyâka <span id="fr_842"></span>[2](#fn_830.md), this is the evil
creature among the creatures of the evil spirit that from midnight till
the sun is up goes and kills thousands of the creatures of the good
spirit.

7 (18). ‘And whosoever, O Zarathu*s*tra! shall kill the daêva
Zairimyangura, which evil-speaking people call the Zairimyâka, his sins
in thought, word, and deed are redeemed as they would be by a Patet; his
sins in thought, word, and deed are atoned for.

### II.

or a Vohunazga dog <span id="fr_843"></span>[3](#fn_831.md), or

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

a trained dog <span id="fr_844"></span>[1](#fn_832.md), his soul when
passing to the other world, shall fly <span
id="fr_845"></span>[2](#fn_833.md) amid louder howling and fiercer pursuing
than the sheep does when the wolf rushes upon it in the lofty forest.

9 (24). ‘No soul will come and meet his departing soul and help it
through the howls and pursuit <span id="fr_846"></span>[3](#fn_834.md) in
the other world; nor will the dogs that keep the *K*inva*d* bridge <span
id="fr_847"></span>[4](#fn_835.md) help his departing soul through the
howls and pursuit in the other world.

10 (26). ‘If a man shall smite a shepherd's dog so that it becomes unfit
for work, if he shall cut off its ear or its paw, and thereupon a thief
or a wolf break in and carry away sheep from the fold, without the dog
giving any warning, the man shall pay for the lost sheep, and he shall
pay for the wound of the dog as for wilful wounding <span
id="fr_848"></span>[5](#fn_836.md).

11 (31). 'If a man shall smite a house dog so that it becomes unfit for
work, if he shall cut off its ear or its paw, and thereupon a thief or a
wolf break in and carry away goods from the house, without the dog
giving any warning, the man shall pay for the lost goods, and he shall
pay for the wound of the dog as for wilful wounding.'

smite a shepherd's dog. so that it gives up the ghost and the soul parts
from the body, what is the penalty that he shall pay?

hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

15 (45). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man shall
smite a young dog <span id="fr_849"></span>[1](#fn_837.md) so that it gives
up the ghost and the soul parts from the body, what is the penalty that
he shall pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'Five hundred stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra,
five hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

16 (48). 'This is the penalty for the murder of a *G*a*z*u dog, of a
Vî*z*u dog <span id="fr_850"></span>[2](#fn_838.md), of a Sukuruna
dog <span id="fr_851"></span>[3](#fn_839.md), of a sharp-toothed Urupi
dog <span id="fr_852"></span>[4](#fn_840.md), of a swift-running
Raopi <span id="fr_853"></span>[5](#fn_841.md) dog; this is the penalty for
the murder of any kind of dog but the water dog <span
id="fr_854"></span>[6](#fn_842.md)'

### III.

17 (49). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which is the dog
that must be called a shepherd's dog?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is the dog who goes a Yu*g*yêsti <span
id="fr_855"></span>[1](#fn_843.md) round about the fold, watching for the
thief and the wolf.'

18 (51). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which is the dog
that must be called a house dog?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is the dog who goes a Hâthra round about the
house, watching for the thief and the wolf.'

19 (53). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which is the dog
that must be called a Vohunazga dog?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is the dog who claims none of those talents,
and only seeks for his subsistence <span
id="fr_856"></span>[2](#fn_844.md).'

### IV.

20 (55). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man give bad
food to a shepherd's dog, of what sin is he guilty?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'It is the same guilt as though he should serve

id="fr_857"></span>[3](#fn_845.md).'

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

21 (57). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man give bad

22 (59). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man give bad
food to a Vohunazga dog, of what sin is he guilty?

23 (61). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man give bad

28 (75). 'For it is the dog, of all the creatures of the good spirit,
that most quickly decays into age, while not eating near eating people,
and watching goods none of which it receives. Bring ye unto him milk and
fat with meat; this is the right food for the dog <span
id="fr_861"></span>[1](#fn_849.md).'

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

### V.

29 (80). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be in
the house of a worshipper of Mazda a mad dog, or one that bites without
barking, what shall the worshippers of Mazda do?

30 (82). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘They shall put a wooden collar around
his neck, and they shall tie him to a post, an a*s*ti <span
id="fr_862"></span>[1](#fn_850.md) thick if the wood be hard, two a*s*tis
thick if it be soft. To that post they shall tie him; by the two
sides <span id="fr_863"></span>[2](#fn_851.md) of the collar they shall tie
him.

31 (86). ‘If they shall not do so, and the mad dog, or the dog that
bites without barking, smite a sheep or wound a man, the dog shall pay
for it as for wilful murder <span id="fr_864"></span>[3](#fn_852.md).

32 (88). ‘If the dog shall smite a sheep or wound a man, they shall cut
off his right ear. If he shall smite another sheep or wound another man,
they shall cut off his left ear.

33 (90). ‘If he shalt smite a third sheep or wound a third man, they
shall cut off his right foot <span id="fr_865"></span>[4](#fn_853.md). If
he shall smite a fourth sheep or wound a fourth man, they shall cut off
his left foot.

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

34 (92). ‘If he shall for the fifth time smite a sheep or wound a man,
they shall cut off his tail.

'Therefore they shall tie him to the post; by the two sides of the
collar they shall tie him. If they shall not do so, and the mad dog, or
the dog that bites without barking, smite a sheep or wound a man, he
shall pay for it as for wilful murder.'

35 (97). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be in
the house of a worshipper of Mazda a scentless dog, or a mad dog, what
shall the worshippers of Mazda do?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall attend him to heal him, in the same
manner as they would do for one of the faithful.'

36 (100). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If they try to
heal him and fail, what shall the worshippers of Mazda do?

37 (102). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘They shall put a wooden collar around
his neck, and they shall tie him to a post, an a*s*ti thick if the wood
be hard, two a*s*tis thick if it be soft. To that post they shall tie
him; by the two sides of the collar they shall tie him.

38 (102). ‘If they shall not do so, and the scentless dog fall into a
hole, or a well, or a precipice, or a river, or a canal, and he be
wounded and die thereof, they shall be Peshôtanus.

### VI.

39 (106). ‘The dog, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! I, Ahura Mazda, have made
self-clothed and self-shod, watchful, wakeful, and sharp-toothed, born
to take his food from man and to watch over man's goods. I, Ahura Mazda,
have made the dog strong of body

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

against the evil-doer, and watchful over your goods, when he is of sound
mind.

40 (112). 'And whosoever shall awake at his voice, neither shall the
thief nor the wolf steal anything from his house, without his being
warned, the wolf shall be smitten and torn to pieces; he is driven away,
he flees away.'

### VII.

41 (115). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which, of the
two wolves deserves more to be killed, the one that is born of a he-dog
and of a she-wolf, or the one that is born of a she-dog and of a
he-wolf?

Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Of these two wolves, the one that is born of a
he-dog and of a she-wolf deserves more to be killed than the one that is
born of a she-dog and of a he-wolf.

42 (117). ‘For there are born of a he-dog and of a she-wolf such dogs as
fall on the shepherd's dog, on the house dog, on the Vohunazga dog, on
the trained dog, and destroy the folds; such dogs are born as are more
murderous, more mischievous, more destructive to the folds than any
other dogs.

43 (121). ‘And there are born of a he-dog and of a she-wolf such wolves
as fall on the shepherd's dog, on the house dog, on the Vohunazga dog,
on the trained dog, and destroy the folds; such wolves are born as are
more murderous, more mischievous, more destructive to the folds than any
other wolves.

### VIII.

44 (124). ‘A dog has the characters of eight different sorts of
people:--

‘He has the character of a priest,

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

‘He has the character of a warrior,

‘He has the character of a husbandman,

‘He has the character of a strolling singer,

‘He has the character of a thief,

‘He has the character of a wild beast,

‘He has the character of a courtezan,

‘He has the character of a child.

45 (126). ‘He eats broken food, like a priest <span
id="fr_866"></span>[1](#fn_854.md); he is grateful, like a priest; he is
easily satisfied <span id="fr_867"></span>[2](#fn_855.md), like a priest;
he wants only a small piece of bread, like a priest; in these things he
is like unto a priest.

‘He marches in front, like a warrior; he fights for the beneficent cow,
like a warrior <span id="fr_868"></span>[3](#fn_856.md); he goes first out
of the house, like a warrior <span id="fr_869"></span>[4](#fn_857.md); in
these things he is like unto a warrior.

46 (135). ‘He is watchful and sleeps lightly, like a husbandman; he goes
first out of the house, like a husbandman <span
id="fr_870"></span>[5](#fn_858.md); he returns last into the house, like a
husbandman <span id="fr_871"></span>[6](#fn_859.md); in these things he is
like unto a husbandman.

‘He sings like a strolling singer; he is intrusive <span
id="fr_872"></span>[7](#fn_860.md), like a strolling singer; he is meagre,
like a strolling singer; he is poor, like a strolling singer; in these
things he is like unto a strolling singer.

47 (143). ‘He likes darkness, like a thief; he prowls about in darkness,
like a thief; he is a shameless

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

eater, like a thief;. he is an unfaithful keeper, like a thief <span
id="fr_873"></span>[1](#fn_861.md); in these things he is like unto a thief

‘He likes darkness, like a wild beast <span
id="fr_874"></span>[2](#fn_862.md); he prowls about in darkness, like a
wild beast; he is a shameless eater, like a wild beast; he is an
unfaithful keeper, like a wild beast; in these things he is like unto a
wild beast.

48 (153). ‘He sings, like a courtezan; he is intrusive, like a
courtezan; he walks about the roads, like a courtezan; he is meagre,
like a courtezan; he is poor, like a courtezan; in these things he is
like unto a courtezan.

‘He likes sleeping, like a child; he is apt to run away <span
id="fr_875"></span>[3](#fn_863.md), like a child; he is full of tongue,
like a child; he goes on all fours <span
id="fr_876"></span>[4](#fn_864.md), like a child; in these things he is
like unto a child.

### IX.

49 (163). ‘If those two dogs of mine, the shepherd's dog and the house
dog, pass by the house of any of my faithful people, let them never be
kept away from it.

'For no house could subsist on the earth made by Ahura, but for those
two dogs of mine, the shepherd's dog and the house dog <span
id="fr_877"></span>[5](#fn_865.md).'

### X.

50 (166). O Maker of the material world, thou

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Holy One! When a
dog dies, with marrow and seed <span id="fr_878"></span>[1](#fn_866.md)
dried up, whereto does his ghost go?

51 (167). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘It passes to the spring of the
waters <span id="fr_879"></span>[2](#fn_867.md), O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra!
and there out of every thousand dogs and every thousand she-dogs, two
water dogs are formed, a water dog and a water she-dog <span
id="fr_880"></span>[3](#fn_868.md).

52 (170). 'He who kills a water dog brings about a drought that dries up
pastures. Before that time, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! sweetness and
fatness would flow out from that land and from those fields, with health
and healing, with fulness and increase and growth, and a growing of corn
and grass.'

53 (171). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! When are
sweetness and fatness to come back again to that land and to those
fields, with health and healing, with fulness and increase and growth,
and a growing of corn and grass?

54, 55 (172). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Sweetness and fatness will never
come back again to that land and to those fields, with health and
healing, with fulness and increase and growth, and a growing of corn and
grass, until the murderer of the water dog has been smitten to death and
the holy soul of the dog has been offered up a sacrifice, for three days

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

and three nights with fire blazing, with baresma tied up, and with Haoma
uplifted <span id="fr_881"></span>[1](#fn_869.md).

56 (174). \['Then sweetness and fatness will come back again to the land
and to those fields, with health and healing, with fulness and increase
and growth, and a growing of corn and grass <span
id="fr_882"></span>[2](#fn_870.md).'\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_825"></span>[152:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_837.md) The hedge-hog. As
it struggles from midnight till the dawn, this supposes the existence of
a myth, in which the rays of the sun, beginning from midnight to pierce
the veil of darkness, were compared to the prickles of a heavenly
hedge-hog.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[152:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_838.md) Du*z*aka is the
popular name of the hedge-hog (Pers. *z*u*z*ah). The name Vanghâpara
must have referred to its mythical qualities. It is not without
importance which name is given to it: 'When called by its high name, it
is powerful' (Comm.); cf. § 6, and Farg. XVIII, 15. The nature of every
being lies partly in its name.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[152:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_839.md) The bridge leading
to paradise; see Farg. XIX, 30.

<span id="fn_828"></span>[152:4](sbe0419.htm#fr_840.md) Cf. § 54.
Aspendiârji translates: 'He cannot atone for it in his life even by
performing a sacrifice to Sraosha.'

<span id="fn_829"></span>[153:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_841) The tortoise (Asp..md)

<span id="fn_830"></span>[153:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_842.md) 'When not so called
it is less strong' (Comm.) Zairimyâka is a lucky name, as it is
connected with a word (zairimya) which denotes the freshness of water
and verdure; and it seems to designate the tortoise as 'the fresh-water
creature' (Asp.); therefore the name is corrected into 'the injurer (?)
of fresh water.'

<span id="fn_831"></span>[153:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_843.md) See § 19 n.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[154:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_844) A hunting dog(?.md).

<span id="fn_833"></span>[154:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_845.md) 'From paradise'
(Comm.)

<span id="fn_834"></span>[154:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_846.md) Of the Dîvs.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[155:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_849.md) A dog not older
than four months.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[155:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_850.md) Unknown. Cf. V, 31,
32.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[155:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_851.md) A lynx. Cf. V, 3

<span id="fn_840"></span>[155:4](sbe0419.htm#fr_852.md) A weazel. Cf. V,
33.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[155:5](sbe0419.htm#fr_853.md) A fox. The fox
belongs to the good creation, as he fights against the demon Khava
(Bund. XIX; cf. Orm. Ahr. § 228).

<span id="fn_842"></span>[155:6](sbe0419.htm#fr_854.md) The beaver. 'For
the penalty in that case is most heavy' (Comm.) Cf. § 52 seq. and Farg.
XIV.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[156:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_855.md) A measure unknown;
it seems to have been the average distance of fourteen houses (see the
gloss ad § 17 in the Introd. V, 4, Farg. XV, 45, and Bund. p. 31, 7).

<span id="fn_844"></span>[156:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_856.md) 'He cannot do the
same as the shepherd's dog and the house dog do, but he catches
Khrafstras and smites the Nasu' (Comm.) It is 'the dog without a master'
(gharîb), the vagrant dog; he is held in great esteem (§ 22) and is one
of the dogs who can be used for the Sag-dîd (Introd. V, 4).

<span id="fn_845"></span>[156:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_857.md) Invited as a guest.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[157:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_858.md) The Vohunazga dog
has no domicile, therefore he is not compared with the master of a
house; as he smites the Nasu, he is like a holy man, of the wandering
class, a sort of begging friar.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[157:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_859.md) Probably, 'Who has
performed the nû-zûd, fifteen years old.' The young dog enters the
community of the faithful at the age of four months, when he can smite
the Nasu.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[157:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_860.md) 'I also saw the
soul of a man, whom demons, just like dogs, ever tear. That man gives
bread to the dogs, and they eat it not; <span id="page_158">p.
158</span> but they ever devour the breast, legs, belly, and thighs of
the man. And I asked thus: What sin was committed by this body, whose
soul suffers so severe a punishment? Srôsh the pious and Âtarô the angel
said thus: This is the soul of that wicked man who, in the world, kept
back the food of the dogs of shepherds and householders; or beat and
killed them' (Ardai Vîrâf XLVIII, translated by Haug).

<span id="fn_849"></span>[158:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_861.md) 'Whenever one eats
bread one must put aside three mouthfuls and give them to the dog . . .
for among all the poor there is none poorer than the dog' (Saddar V;
Hyde 35).

<span id="fn_850"></span>[159:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_862.md) A measure of
unknown amount. Aspendiârji reads i*s*ti, 'a brick' thick.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[159:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_863.md) By the forepart and
the back part of it.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[159:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_864.md) As there is no
essential difference between man and beast, the beast must answer for
its guilt. According to Solon's law, the dog who has bitten any one must
be delivered to him tied up to a block four cubits long (Plutarchus,
Solon 24); the horse who has killed a man is put to death (Eusebius,
Prep. Evang. 5).

<span id="fn_853"></span>[159:4](sbe0419.htm#fr_865.md) 'They only cut off
a piece of flesh from the foot' (Brouillons d‘Anquetil).

<span id="fn_854"></span>[162:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_866.md) A wandering priest
(see [p. 157](#page_157), n. [1](#fn_846).md).

<span id="fn_855"></span>[162:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_867.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[162:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_868.md) 'He keeps away the
wolf and the thief' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_857"></span>[162:4](sbe0419.htm#fr_869.md) This clause is, as
it seems, repeated here by mistake from § 46.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[162:5](sbe0419.htm#fr_870.md) When taking the
cattle out of the stables.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[162:6](sbe0419.htm#fr_871.md) When bringing the
cattle back to the stables.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[162:7](sbe0419.htm#fr_872.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[163:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_873.md) 'When one trusts
him with something, he eats it' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_862"></span>[163:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_874.md) According to Asp.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[163:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_875.md) He is fearful.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[163:5](sbe0419.htm#fr_877.md) 'But for the dog
not a single head of cattle would remain in existence' (Saddar 31; Hyde
35).

<span id="fn_866"></span>[164:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_878.md) Marrow is the seat
of life, the spine is 'the column and the spring of life' (Yt. X, 7 1);
the sperm comes from it (Bundahi*s* XVI). The same theory prevailed in
India, where the sperm is called ma*gg*â-samudbhava, 'what is born from
marrow;' it was followed by Plato (Timaeus 74, 91; cf. Plut. De Plac.
Philos. V, 3, 4), and disproved by Aristotle (De Part. Anim. III, 7).

<span id="fn_867"></span>[164:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_879.md) To the spring of
Ardvî Sûra, the goddess of waters.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[164:3](sbe0419.htm#fr_880.md) There is therefore
in a single water dog as much life and holiness as in a thousand dogs.
This accounts for the following.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[165:1](sbe0419.htm#fr_881.md) The zanda ravân,
the same sacrifice as is offered up for three days and three nights
after the death of a man for the salvation of his soul. Cf. [p.
132](sbe0415.htm#page_132), n. [4](sbe0415.htm#fn_775.md).

<span id="fn_870"></span>[165:2](sbe0419.htm#fr_882.md) Cf. Farg. IX,
