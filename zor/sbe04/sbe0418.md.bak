------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FARGARD XII.

This chapter is found only in the Vendîdâd Sâdah; it is missing in the
Zend-Pahlavi Vendîdâd. This is owing, as it seems, only to the
accidental loss of some folios in the one manuscript from which all the
copies as yet known have been derived; and, in fact, even in the most
ancient manuscripts the following Fargard is numbered the thirteenth
(Westergaard, Zend-Avesta, preface, p. 5).

The directions in the preceding chapter are general, and do not depend
on the relationship of the faithful with the deceased person; but those
in this Fargard are of a special character, and apply only to the near
relatives of the dead. Their object is to determine how long the time of
'staying' (upaman) should last for different relatives. What is meant by
this word is not explained; but, as the word upaman is usually employed
to indicate the staying of the unclean in the Armê*s*t-gâh, apart from
the faithful and from every clean object, it seems to follow that the
relatives of a dead person were considered unclean from the mere fact of
being related to him, and were, on this account, shut out of the
frequented parts of the house. So, besides the general uncleanness
arising from actual contact with a corpse, there was another form of
uncleanness arising from relationship with the dead. The natural link
that connects the members of one and the same family is of such a kind
that no one can die without death entering all of them. Whether this is
the primitive form of mourning, or only a later form of it, we will not
discuss here.

On the other hand, the house is unclean too, at least with regard to the
relatives; for the time of 'staying' is followed by a purification of
the house, that is not to be confounded with that described in the
eighth Fargard, which takes place directly after the death and, as it
appears, opens the house again only to those who were not connected with
the dead man. Even nowadays, in Persia, the house where a relative has
died is unlucky, and is looked upon with even more repugnance than is
shown in the Avesta. The son deserts the house where his father has
died; he could not live and walk in it, 'the unlucky step,' the bad
qadîm is in it; 'every man's house must die with him;' therefore, he
lets it fall into ruin, and builds another house farther off <span
id="fr_829"></span>[1](#fn_817.md); a custom to which there seems to be
some allusion in the Pahlavi Commentary (ad I, 9).

1\. If one's father or mother dies, how long shall they stay <span

then the house shall be clean, and then the waters may enter, then the

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Holy One! How

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

creation of the good spirit does he directly defile (in dying)? What
part does he indirectly defile?

22 <span id="fr_836"></span>[1](#fn_824) (65.md). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘No
more than a frog does whose venom is dried up, and that has been dead
more than a year. Whilst alive, indeed, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! that
wicked, two-legged ruffian, that ungodly Ashemaogha, directly defiles
the creatures of the good spirit, and indirectly defiles them.

23 (70). ‘Whilst alive he smites the water; whilst alive he blows out
the fire; Whilst alive he carries off the cow; whilst alive he smites
the faithful man with a deadly blow, that parts the soul from the body;
not so will he do when dead.

24 (71). 'Whilst alive, indeed, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! that wicked,
two-legged ruffian, that ungodly Ashemaogha, never ceases depriving the
faithful man of his food, of his clothing, of his house, of his bed, of
his vessels; not so will he do when dead.'
