## FARGARD XX.

### Thrita, the First Healer.

Thrita was the first who drove back death and disease, as Ahura Mazda
had brought to him down from heaven ten thousand healing plants that had
been growing up around the tree of eternal life, the white Hôm or
Gaokerena.

This Thrita is mentioned only once again in the Avesta, in Yasna IX, 7,
where he appears to have been one of the first priests of Haoma. This
accounts for his medical skill; as Haoma is a source of life and health,
his first priests must have been the first healers.

Thrita was originally the same as Thraêtaona <span
id="fr_1130"></span>[1](#fn_1118). On one hand, we see that in the
Rig-veda the great feat of Thraêtaona is ascribed to Trita as well as to
Traitâna, and Trita Âptya, 'the son of the waters,' was as well the
celestial priest who pours Haoma into rain as the celestial hero who
kills the snake in storms. On the other hand, we see that Thraêtaona
fulfilled the same functions as Thrita: according to Hamza he was the
inventor of medicine <span id="fr_1131"></span>[2](#fn_1119); the
Tavids <span id="fr_1132"></span>[3](#fn_1120) against sickness are
inscribed with his name, and we find in the Avesta itself the Fravashi
of Thraêtaona invoked 'against itch, hot fever, humours, cold
fever <span id="fr_1133"></span>[4](#fn_1121), vâvareshi, against the
plagues created by the serpent <span id="fr_1134"></span>[5](#fn_1122).'
We see from this passage that disease was understood as coming from the
serpent; in other words, that it was considered a sort of
poisoning <span id="fr_1135"></span>[6](#fn_1123), and this is the
reason why the

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

killer of the serpent was invoked to act against it. Thus
Thrita-Thraêtaona had a double right to the title of the first of the
healers, both as a priest of Haoma and as the conqueror of the
serpent <span id="fr_1136"></span>[1](#fn_1124).

1\. Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Who was he who first
of the healthful <span id="fr_1137"></span>[2](#fn_1125), the wise, the
happy, the wealthy, the glorious, the strong men of yore <span
id="fr_1138"></span>[3](#fn_1126), drove back sickness to sickness,
drove back death to death <span id="fr_1139"></span>[4](#fn_1127), and
first turned away the point of the poniard and the fire of fever from
the bodies of mortals.'

2 (11). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Thrita it was who first of the healthful,
the wise, the happy, the wealthy, the glorious, the strong man of yore,
drove back sickness to sickness, drove back death to death, and first
turned away the point of the poniard and the fire of fever from the
bodies of mortals.

3 (12). ‘He asked for a source of remedies <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[5](#fn_1128); he obtained it from
Khshathra-Vairya <span id="fr_1141"></span>[6](#fn_1129), to withstand
sickness and to withstand death, to withstand pain and fever, to
withstand the disease <span id="fr_1142"></span>[7](#fn_1130),
rottenness and

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

infection which Angra Mainyu had created witchcraft against the bodies
of mortals <span id="fr_1143"></span>[1](#fn_1131).

4 (15). ‘And I Ahura Mazda brought down the healing plants that, by many
hundreds, by many thousands, by many myriads, grow up all around the one
Gaokerena <span id="fr_1144"></span>[2](#fn_1132).

5 (18). ‘All this (health) do we call by our blessing-spells, by our
prayers, by our praises, upon the bodies of mortals <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[3](#fn_1133).

7 (19) <span id="fr_1146"></span>[4](#fn_1134). ‘To thee, O Sickness, I
say avaunt! to thee, O Death, I say avaunt! to thee, O Pain, I say
avaunt! to thee, O Fever, I say avaunt! to thee, O Disease, I say
avaunt <span id="fr_1147"></span>[5](#fn_1135)!

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

8 (21). ‘By their might may we smite down the Dru*g*! By their might may
we smite the Dru*g*! May they give to us strength and power, O
Ahura <span id="fr_1148"></span>[1](#fn_1136)!

9 <span id="fr_1149"></span>[2](#fn_1137) (23). ‘I drive away sickness,
I drive away death, I drive away pain and fever <span
id="fr_1150"></span>[3](#fn_1138), I drive away the disease, rottenness,
and infection which Angra Mainyu has created by his witchcraft against
the bodies of mortals.

10 (25). ‘I drive away all manner of diseases and deaths, all the Yâtus
and Pairikas <span id="fr_1151"></span>[4](#fn_1139), and all the wicked
*G*ainis <span id="fr_1152"></span>[5](#fn_1140).

11 (26). ‘May the much-desired Airyaman <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[6](#fn_1141); come here, for the men and women of
Zarathu*s*tra to rejoice, for the faithful to rejoice; with the
desirable reward that is won by means of the law, and with that boon for
holiness that is vouchsafed by Ahura!

12 (29). 'May the much-desired Airyaman smite

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

all manner of diseases and deaths, all the Yâtus and Pairikas, and all
the wicked *G*ainis.'

\[13. Yathâ ahû vairyô:--the will of the Lord is the law of holiness;
the riches of Vohu-manô shall be given to him who works in this world
for Mazda, and wields according to the will of Ahura the power he gave
to him to relieve the poor.

K*e*m nâ mazdâ:--whom hast thou placed to protect me, O Mazda! while the
hate of the fiend is grasping me? Whom but thy Atar and Vohu-manô, by
whose work the holy world goes on? Reveal to me the rules of thy law!

K*e* verethrem *g*â:--who is he who will smite the fiend in order to
maintain thy ordinances? Teach me clearly thy rules for this world and
for the next, that Sraosha may come with Vohu-manô and help whomsoever
thou pleasest.

Keep us from our hater, O Mazda and Ârmaiti Spe*n*ta! Perish, O fiendish
Dru*g*! Perish, O brood of the fiend! Perish, O world of the fiend!
Perish away, O Dru*g*! Perish away to the regions of the north, never
more to give unto death the living world of the holy spirit!\] <span

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[219:4](sbe0426.htm#fr_1133) Cf. Farg. VII,
58.

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[219:5](sbe0426.htm#fr_1134) Yasht XIII, 131.

<span id="fn_1123"></span>[219:6](sbe0426.htm#fr_1135) This theory,
which modern science would not utterly reject, accounts for the great
part which the serpent plays in the worship of Asklepios; as sickness
comes from him, from him too must or may come the healing.

<span id="fn_1124"></span>[220:1](sbe0426.htm#fr_1136) It seems as if in
the Vedas, too, Trita had been a healing god (Rig-veda VIII, 47, 13
seq.)

<span id="fn_1125"></span>[220:2](sbe0426.htm#fr_1137) Whom no weapon
could wound, like Isfendiâr (Comm.)

<span id="fn_1126"></span>[220:3](sbe0426.htm#fr_1138) Or better,
Paradhâta (or Pêshdâd), 'the kings of yore,' which became the name of
the first Iranian dynasty.

<span id="fn_1127"></span>[220:4](sbe0426.htm#fr_1139) 'That is to say,
who kept sickness in bonds, who kept death in bonds' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_1128"></span>[220:5](sbe0426.htm#fr_1140) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_1129"></span>[220:6](sbe0426.htm#fr_1141) As
Khshathra-Vairya presides over metals, it was a knife he received, 'of
which the point and the base were set in gold.' He was therefore the
first who healed with the knife (cf. Farg. VII, 44); and it appears from
§ 4 that he was also the first who healed with herbs, As for the healing
with the holy word, see Farg. XXII.

<span id="fn_1130"></span>[220:7](sbe0426.htm#fr_1142) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_1131"></span>[221:1](sbe0426.htm#fr_1143) The Vendîdâd
Sâdah has here eight names of diseases: to withstand Sârana (head-ache),
to withstand Sârastya (cold fever), to withstand A*z*ana, to withstand
A*z*ahva, to withstand Kurugha, to withstand A*z*ivâka, to withstand
Duruka, and to withstand Astairya.

<span id="fn_1132"></span>[221:2](sbe0426.htm#fr_1144) The white Hôm,
which is the king of healing plants (see Introd. IV, 28). The healing
plants are said to have been created ten thousand in number, in order to
oppose so many diseases that had been created by Ahriman (Bundahi*s* IX;
cf. Farg XXII, 2). In India also, healing plants are said to have come
down from heaven: 'Whilst coming down from heaven, the plants said: He
will never suffer any wound, the mortal whom we both touch' (Rig-veda X,
97, 17; cf. Haurvatâ*t* et Ameretâ*t*, §§ 46-47).

<span id="fn_1133"></span>[221:3](sbe0426.htm#fr_1145) Or possibly, All
those (plants) do we bless, all those (plants) do we pray, all those
(plants) do we praise, for (the weal of) the bodies of mortals.

<span id="fn_1134"></span>[221:4](sbe0426.htm#fr_1146) Vendîdâd Sâdah:
6. To withstand sickness, to withstand death, to withstand pain, to
withstand fever, to withstand Sârana, to withstand Sârastya, to
withstand A*z*ana, to withstand A*z*ahva, to withstand Kurugha, to
withstand A*z*ivâka, to withstand Duruka, to withstand Astairya, to
withstand the disease, rottenness, and infection which Angra Mainyu has
created by his witchcraft against the bodies of mortals.

<span id="fn_1135"></span>[221:5](sbe0426.htm#fr_1147) Vendîdâd Sâdah:
To thee O Sârana, I say avaunt! to thee, <span id="page_222">p.
222</span> O Sârastya, I say avaunt! to thee, O A*z*ana, I say avaunt!
to thee, O A*z*ahva, I say avaunt! to thee, O Kurugha, I say avaunt! to
thee, O A*z*ivâka, I say avaunt! to thee, O Duruka, I say avaunt! to
thee, O Astairya, I say avaunt!

<span id="fn_1136"></span>[222:1](sbe0426.htm#fr_1148) This clause is
borrowed, with some alteration, from Yasna XXXI, 4; the original text
is, 'May the strong power come to me, by the might of which we may smite
down the Dru*g*!'

<span id="fn_1137"></span>[222:2](sbe0426.htm#fr_1149) The Vendîdâd
Sâdah has, 'I drive away Ishirê, I drive away Aghûirê, I drive away
Aghra, I drive away Ughra.'

<span id="fn_1138"></span>[222:3](sbe0426.htm#fr_1150) The Vendîdâd
Sâdah has, 'I drive away Sârana, I drive away Sârastya, I drive away
A*z*ana, I drive away A*z*ahva, I drive away Kurugha, I drive away
A*z*ivâka, I drive away Duruka, I drive away Astairya.'

<span id="fn_1139"></span>[222:4](sbe0426.htm#fr_1151) See Introd. IV,
20-21.

<span id="fn_1140"></span>[222:5](sbe0426.htm#fr_1152) '*G*ai' (Comm.),
that is *G*ahi (see Introd. IV, 5); cf. [p. 89](sbe0413.htm#page_89),
note [1](sbe0413.htm#fn_668), and Farg. XXII, 2, note.

<span id="fn_1141"></span>[222:6](sbe0426.htm#fr_1153) Or better,
'Airyaman, the bestower of good.' On Airyaman, see Farg. XXII. Clauses
11-12 are borrowed from Yasna LIV, 1, and form the prayer known as
Airyama-ishyô.

<span id="fn_1142"></span>[223:1](sbe0426.htm#fr_1154) From the Vendîdâd
Sâdah.
