### I.

1\. O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be in the
house of a worshipper of Mazda a woman who has an issue of blood, either
out of the ordinary course or at the usual period, what shall the
worshippers of Mazda do?

2 (3). Ahura Mazda answered: 'They shall clear the way <span
id="fr_956"></span>[1](#fn_944.md) of the wood there, both in growing trees
and in logs <span id="fr_957"></span>[2](#fn_945.md); they shall strew dry
dust on the ground <span id="fr_958"></span>[3](#fn_946.md); and they shall
erect a building there <span id="fr_959"></span>[4](#fn_947.md), higher
than the house by a half, or a third, or a fourth, or a fifth part, lest
her look should fall upon the fire <span
id="fr_960"></span>[5](#fn_948.md).'

3 (9). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from the
fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated bundles of
baresma? How far from the faithful?

4 (10). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Fifteen paces from the fire, fifteen
paces from the water, fifteen

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

paces from the consecrated bundles of baresma, three paces from the
faithful.'

5 (11). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from her
shall he stay, who brings food to a woman who has an issue of blood,
either out of the ordinary course or at the usual period?

6 (12). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Three paces <span
id="fr_961"></span>[1](#fn_949.md) from her shall he stay, who brings food
to a woman who has an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course
or at the usual period.'

In what kind of vessels shall he bring the food? In what kind of vessels
shall he bring the bread?

'In vessels of brass, or of lead, or of any common metal <span
id="fr_962"></span>[2](#fn_950.md).'

7 (15). How much food shall he bring to her? How much bread shall he
bring?

‘(Only) two danares <span id="fr_963"></span>[3](#fn_951.md) of long bread,
and one danare of milk pap, lest she should gather strength <span
id="fr_964"></span>[4](#fn_952.md).

‘If a child has just touched her, they shall first wash his hands and
then his body <span id="fr_965"></span>[5](#fn_953.md).

8 (21). ‘If she still see blood after three nights

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

have passed, she shall sit in the place of infirmity until four nights
have passed.

‘If she still see blood after four nights have passed, she shall sit in
the place of infirmity until five nights, have passed.

9\. ‘If she still see blood after five nights have passed, she shall sit
in the place of infirmity until six nights have passed.

‘If she still see blood after six nights have passed, she shall sit in
the place of infirmity until seven nights have passed.

10\. ‘If she still see blood after seven nights have passed, she shall
sit in the place of infirmity until eight nights have passed.

‘If she still see, blood after, eight nights have passed, she shall sit
in the place of infirmity until nine nights have passed.

11\. 'If she still see blood after nine nights have passed, this is a
work of the Daêvas which they have performed for the worship and
glorification of the Daêvas <span id="fr_966"></span>[1](#fn_954.md).'

### II.

‘The worshippers of Mazda shall clear the way <span
id="fr_967"></span>[2](#fn_955.md) of the wood there, both in growing trees
and in logs;

12 (26). ‘They shall dig three holes in the earth, and they shall wash
the woman with gômêz by two of those holes and with water by the third.

'They shall kill Khrafstras, to wit: two hundred corn-carrying ants, if
it be summer; two hundred of

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

any other sort of the Khrafstras made by Angra Mainyu, if it be
winter <span id="fr_968"></span>[1](#fn_956.md).'

### III.

13 (30). If a worshipper of Mazda shall suppress the issue of a woman
who has an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course or at the
usual period, what is the penalty that he shall pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'He is a Peshôtanu: two hundred stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, two hundred stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

14 (33). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a man shall
again and again wilfully touch the body of a woman who has an issue of
blood, either out of the ordinary course or at the usual period, so that
the ordinary issue turns to the dye of the unusual one, or the unusual
issue to the dye of the ordinary one, what is the penalty that he shall
pay?

15 (36). Ahura Mazda answered: 'For the first time he comes near unto
her, for the first time he lies by her, thirty stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, thirty stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana; for the second
time he comes near unto her, for the second time he lies by her, fifty
stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, fifty stripes with the
Sraoshô-*k*arana; for the third time he comes near unto her, for the
third time he lies by her, seventy stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra,
seventy stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.'

16\. For the fourth time he comes near unto her, for the fourth time he
lies by her, if he shall press the body under her clothes, if he shall
press the

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

unclean thigh, but without sexual intercourse) what is the penalty that
he shall pay?

Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Ninety stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, ninety
stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana.

17 (39). ‘Whosoever shall lie in sexual intercourse with a woman who has
an issue of blood, either out of the ordinary course or at the usual
period, does no better deed than if he should burn the corpse of his own
son, born of his own body and dead of naêza <span
id="fr_969"></span>[1](#fn_957.md), and drop its fat into the fire <span
id="fr_970"></span>[2](#fn_958.md).

18 (41). 'All such sinners, embodiments of the Dru*g*, are scorners of
the law: all scorners of the law are rebels against the Lord; all rebels
against the Lord are ungodly men; and any ungodly man shall pay for it
with his life <span id="fr_971"></span>[3](#fn_959.md).'

<span id="fn_944"></span>[181:1](sbe0422.htm#fr_956.md) The way to the
Dashtânistân (see Introd. V, 12).

<span id="fn_945"></span>[181:2](sbe0422.htm#fr_957.md) Lest the wood shall
be touched and defiled by the woman on her way to the Dashtânistân.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[181:3](sbe0422.htm#fr_958.md) Lest the earth
shall be touched and defiled by her. Cf. Farg. IX, 11, and Introd. V,
10.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[181:4](sbe0422.htm#fr_959.md) The Dashtânistân.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[181:5](sbe0422.htm#fr_960.md) See Introd. V, 12.

<span id="fn_949"></span>[182:1](sbe0422.htm#fr_961.md) The food is held
out to her from a distance in a metal spoon.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[182:2](sbe0422.htm#fr_962.md) Earthen vessels,
when defiled, cannot be made clean; but metal vessels can (see Farg.
VII, 73 seq.)

<span id="fn_951"></span>[182:3](sbe0422.htm#fr_963.md) A danare is,
according to Anquetil, as much as four tolas, a tola is from 105 to 175
grains.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[182:4](sbe0422.htm#fr_964.md) 'Sôshyôs says: For
three nights cooked meat is not allowed to her, lest the issue shall
grow stronger.' As the fiend is in her, any strength she may gain
accrues to Ahriman.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[182:5](sbe0422.htm#fr_965.md) A child whom she
suckles. The meaning is, Even a child, if he has touched her, must
undergo the rites of cleansing. The general rule is given in the
Commentary: 'Whoever has touched a Dashtân woman must wash his body and
his clothes with gômêz and water.' The ceremony in question is the
simple Ghosel, not the Barashnûm, since the woman herself performs the
former only (vide infra, § 11 seq.; cf. Introd. V, 16).

<span id="fn_954"></span>[183:1](sbe0422.htm#fr_966.md) See Introd. V, 12.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[183:2](sbe0422.htm#fr_967.md) The way to the
Barashnûm-gâh, where the cleansing takes place.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[184:1](sbe0422.htm#fr_968.md) See Introd. IV, 35.

<span id="fn_957"></span>[185:1](sbe0422.htm#fr_969.md) A disease (Farg.
VII, 58). There is another word naêza, 'a spear,' so that one may
translate also 'killed by the spear' (Asp.)

<span id="fn_958"></span>[185:2](sbe0422.htm#fr_970.md) 'Not that the two
deeds are equal, but neither is good' (Comm.) The sin in question is a
simple tanâfûhr (Farg. XV, 7), and therefore can be atoned for by
punishment and repentance, whereas the burning of a corpse is a crime
for which there is no atonement (Farg. I, 17; VIII, 73 seq.; Introd. V,
8).

<span id="fn_959"></span>[185:3](sbe0422.htm#fr_971.md) Literally, 'is a
Peshôtanu;' 'he is a tanâfûhr sinner, that is to say, margarzân (worthy
of death),' Comm.
