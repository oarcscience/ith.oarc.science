<p><FONT SIZE="-1">Angra Mainyu creates 99,999 diseases: Ahura Mazda applies for healing to the holy word and to Airyaman.</p>  
<p>Airyaman is an old Indo-Iranian god: in the Rig-veda he is an &Acirc;ditya (Aryaman), who is seldom invoked alone, but nearly always in company with Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a. His name, like Mitra's, means, 'the friend,' and, like Mitra, he is the god of heavenly light, kind, beneficent, and helpful to man.</p>  
<p>In the Avesta the word Airyaman has the same meaning as in the Veda; but the character of the god is more fully developed, and whereas he has no distinct personality in the Vedic hymns, he appears here in the character of a healing god, which is derived in a very natural manner from his primitive and general character.</p>  
<p>Airyaman abides in a mansion called the mansion of Airyaman (Airyamn&ocirc; nm&acirc;nem), which is the same as 'the bright mansion in</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">which Mitra, Aryaman, Varu<I>n</I>a abide,' according to the Vedas, that is to say, the sky. In later Parsism, Airyaman appears as 'the Ized of Heaven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1175"></A><A HREF="#fn_1161"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p>This Fargard is unfinished or, more correctly, the end of it is understood. Airyaman, called out from his mansion, comes and digs nine furrows. It is no doubt in order to perform the Barashn&ucirc;m&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1176"></A><A HREF="#fn_1162"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> or some ceremony of that kind, in order to cleanse the unclean, that is to say, the sick man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1177"></A><A HREF="#fn_1163"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and to restore him to health by virtue of the Nirang and of the holy word. The Fargard ends therefore with spells against sickness and against death.</FONT></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">I.</h3>  
<p><font size="-1" color="green">[</font>1. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu<I>s</I>tra, saying: &#8216;I, Ahura Mazda, the Maker of all good things, when I made this mansion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1178"></A><A HREF="#fn_1164"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, the beautiful, the shining, seen afar (there may I go up, there may I pass!)</p>

<p>10 (26). &#8216;Unto thee will I give in return a thousand fleet, swift-running steeds; offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka, made by Mazda and holy.</p>  
<p>&#8216;Unto thee will I give in return a thousand fleet, high-humped camels; offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka, made by Mazda and holy.</p>

<p>13 (38). In obedience to Ahura's words he went, Nairy&ocirc;-sangha, the herald; he drove towards the mansion of Airyaman, he spake unto Airyaman, saying:</p>
