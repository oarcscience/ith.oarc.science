## FARGARD X.

During the process of cleansing, the voice works with the hand. The
spells which must be recited while the unclean one is cleansing himself
have already been mentioned in the preceding Fargard, but we find here a
detailed list of spells which are to be spoken twice, or thrice, or four
times. The exact time when they are to be uttered is not mentioned, and
we do not know whether they are to accompany those prescribed in the
last Fargard, and are, therefore, to be repeated as often as the unclean
one is washed, or whether they are only intended to close the whole
ceremony.

These spells, like the former ones, are taken from the hymns or Gâthas,
the oldest and holiest part of the Avesta. They were not written for
this particular purpose, but, as happens in all religions, advantage was
taken of whatever there might be in the old sacred hymns which could be
more or less easily applied to the special circumstances of the case.
The recitation of these lines is followed by an exorcism, written in the
ordinary language of the Avesta, which has been expressly composed for
the occasion.

1\. Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda! most beneficent
spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How shall I fight
against that Dru*g* who from the dead rushes upon the living? How shall
I fight against that Dru*g* who from the dead defiles the living?'

2 (3). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Say aloud those words in the Gâthas that
are to be said twice <span id="fr_785"></span>[1](#fn_776.md); say

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

aloud those words in the Gâthas that are to be said thrice <span
id="fr_786"></span>[1](#fn_777.md); say aloud those words in the Gâthas
that are to be said four times <span id="fr_787"></span>[2](#fn_778.md).'

3 (7). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which are those
words in the Gâthas that are to be said twice?

4 (10). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘These are the words in the Gâthas that
are to be said twice, and thou shalt twice say them aloud:--

‘“I drive away Angra Mainyu from this house, from this borough, from
this town, from this land; from the very body of the man defiled by the
dead, from the very body of the woman defiled by the dead; from the

house, from the lord of the borough, from the lord of the town, from the
lord of the land; from the whole of the holy world."'

7 (13). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which are those
words in the Gâthas that are to be said thrice?

the man defiled by the dead, from the very body of the woman defiled by
the dead; from the master of the house, from the lord of the borough,
from the lord of the town, from the lord of the land; from the whole of
the holy world.

10 (18). '"I drive away Tauru <span id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_780.md), I
drive away Zairi <span id="fr_792"></span>[2](#fn_780.md), from this house,
from this borough, from this town, from this land; from the very body of
the man defiled by the dead, from the very body of the

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

woman defiled by the dead; from the master of the house, from the lord
of the borough, from the lord of the town, from the lord of the land;
from the whole of the holy world."'

11 (19). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Which are those
words in the Gâthas that are to be said four times?

12 (22). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘These are the words in the Gâthas that
are to be said four times, and thou shalt four times say them aloud:--

yathâ ahû vairyô . . . <span id="fr_793"></span>[1](#fn_781.md) (Yas.

aloud these fiend-smiting and most-healing words:--

‘“I drive away Aêshma, the fiend of the wounding spear <span
id="fr_796"></span>[4](#fn_784.md), I drive away the daêva Akatasha <span
id="fr_797"></span>[5](#fn_785.md), from this house, from this borough,

the dead, from the very body of the woman defiled by the dead; from the
master of the house, from the lord of the borough, from the lord of the
town, from the lord of the land; from the whole of the holy world.

14 (24). ‘"I drive away the Varenya daêvas <span

id="fr_799"></span>[7](#fn_787.md), from this house, from

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

this borough, from this town, from this land; from the very body of the
man defiled by the dead, from the very body of the woman defiled by the
dead; from the master of the house, from the lord of the borough, from
the lord of the town, from the lord of the land; from the whole of the
holy world."

15 (25). ‘These are the words in the Gâthas that are to be said twice;
these are the words in the Gâthas that are to be said thrice; these are
the words in the Gâthas that are to be said four times.

16 (26). ‘These are the words that smite down Angra Mainyu; these are
the words that smite down Aêshma, the fiend of the wounding spear; these
are the words that smite down the Mâzainya daêvas <span
id="fr_800"></span>[1](#fn_788.md); these are the words that smite down all
the daêvas.

17 (30). ‘These are the words that stand against that Dru*g*, against
that Nasu, who from the dead rushes upon the living, who from the dead
defiles the living.

18 (32). ‘Therefore, O Zarathu*s*tra! thou shalt dig nine holes <span
id="fr_801"></span>[2](#fn_789.md) in the part of the ground where there is
least water and where there are fewest trees; where there is nothing
that may be food either for man or beast; for purity, is for man, next
to life, the greatest good; that purity that is procured

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

by the law of Mazda for him who cleanses himself with good thoughts,
words, and deeds.

19 (38). ‘Make thyself pure, O righteous man! any one in the world here
below can win purity for himself, namely, when he cleanses himself with
good thoughts, words, and deeds.

20\. 'The will of the Lord is the law of holiness,' &c. <span
id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_790.md)

'Whom hast thou placed to protect me, O Mazda! while the hate of the
fiend is grasping me?' &c.

'Who is he who will smite the fiend in order to maintain thy
ordinances?' &c.

'Keep us from our hater, O Mazda and Ârmaiti Spe*n*ta! Perish, O
fiendish Dru*g*! . . . Perish away to the regions of the north, never
more to give unto death the living world of the holy spirit!'

tradition, 'the Dîvs in Mazanderan;' Mazanderan is known, in fact, as a
land of fiends and sorcerers; a reputation for which it is very likely
indebted to the neighbouring mount Damâvand, to which A*z*i*s* Dahâka is
said to be bound. Yet one may doubt whether it gave its name to the
Mâzainya daêvas, or if it took its name from them. Mâzainya was, most
probably, like Varenya, an epithet of the Dîvs, which, in course of
time, became the name of a class of demons.
