## FARGARD VII.

I (1-5). How long after death the Nasu falls upon the dead.

II (6-9). How far the defiling power of the Nasu extends.

III (10-22). Cleansing of clothes defiled by the dead.

IV (23-24). Eating of corpses an abomination.

V (25-27). Bringing corpses to fire or water an abomination.

VI (28-35). Cleansing of wood and corn defiled by the dead.

VII a (36-40). Physicians; their probation.

VII b (40-44). Their fees.

VIII (45-59). Purification of the earth, of the Dakhmas. The Dakhmas and
the Daêvas.

IX (60-72). Treatment of a woman who has brought forth a still-born
child.

X (73-75). Cleansing of vessels defiled by the dead.

XI (76). Cleansing of the cow.

XII (77). Unclean libations.

This chapter would offer tolerable unity, but for a digression on
medicine, which would be better placed as an introduction to the last
three chapters, Sections II and IX, parts of which have already been
found in Fargard V, are more suitably placed here. This chapter, as a
whole, deals with the action of the Dru*g* Nasu, from the moment she
takes hold of the corpse, and shows how and when the several objects she
has defiled become clean, namely, clothes, wood, corn, earth, women,
vessels, and cows.

### I.

1\. Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
Spirit, Maker of the material

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

world, thou Holy One! When a man dies, at what moment does the Dru*g*
Nasu rush upon him <span id="fr_620"></span>[1](#fn_615.md)?'

2 (3). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Directly after death, as soon as the soul
has left the body, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! the Dru*g* Nasu comes and
rushes upon him, from the regions of the north <span
id="fr_621"></span>[2](#fn_616.md), in the shape of a raging fly, with
knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto the
foulest Khrafstras <span id="fr_622"></span>[3](#fn_617.md).

\[3. 'On him she stays until the dog has seen the corpse <span
id="fr_623"></span>[4](#fn_618.md) or eaten it up, or until the
flesh-eating birds have taken flight towards it <span
id="fr_624"></span>[5](#fn_619.md). When the dog has seen it or eaten it
up, or when the flesh-eating birds have taken flight towards it, then
the Dru*g* Nasu rushes away to the regions of the north in the shape of
a raging fly, with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains,
and like unto the foulest Khrafstras.'\]

4 (5). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If the man has been
killed by a dog, or by a wolf, or by witchcraft, or by the artifices of
hatred <span id="fr_625"></span>[6](#fn_620.md), or by falling down a
precipice, or by the law <span id="fr_626"></span>[7](#fn_621.md), or by a
murderer, or by the noose <span id="fr_627"></span>[8](#fn_622.md), how
long after death does the Dru*g* Nasu come and rush upon the dead?

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

5 (6). Ahura Mazda answered: 'At the next watch after death <span
id="fr_628"></span>[1](#fn_623.md), the Dru*g* Nasu comes and rushes upon
the dead, from the regions of the north, in the shape of a raging fly,
with knees and tail sticking out, all stained with stains, and like unto
the foulest Khrafstras.'

### II <span id="fr_629"></span>[2](#fn_624.md).

6 (7). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If there be a
number of men resting in the same place, on adjoining carpets, on
adjoining pillows, be there two men near one another, or five, or fifty,
or a hundred, close by one another; and of those people one happens to
die; how many of them does the Dru*g* Nasu envelope with infection,
pollution, and uncleanness?

7 (11). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘If the dead one be a priest, the Dru*g*
Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the eleventh
and defiles the ten.

‘If the dead one be a warrior, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the tenth and defiles the nine.

‘If the dead one be a husbandman, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the ninth and defiles the eight.

8 (17). ‘If it be a shepherd's dog, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the eighth and defiles the seven.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

‘If it be a house dog, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the seventh and defiles the six.

9 (21). ‘If it be a Vohunazga dog, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the sixth and defiles the five.

'If it be a young dog, the Dru*g* Nasu rushes forth, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! she falls on the fifth and defiles the four <span
id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_625.md).'

. . . 'those clothes shall serve for their coverings and for their
sheets <span id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_626.md).' . . .

### III

10 (26). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What part of his
bedding <span id="fr_632"></span>[3](#fn_627.md) and pillow does the Dru*g*
Nasu defile with infection, uncleanness, and pollution?

11 (27). Ahura Mazda answered: 'The Dru*g* Nasu defiles with infection,
uncleanness, and pollution the upper sheet and the inner garment <span
id="fr_633"></span>[4](#fn_628.md).'

12 (28). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can that garment
be made clean, O holy Ahura Mazda! that has been touched by the carcase
of a dog or the corpse of a man?

13 (29). Ahura Mazda answered: 'It can, O holy Zarathu*s*tra!'

How so?

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

‘If, indeed, the garment has been defiled with seed, or sweat, or dirt,
or vomit, the worshippers of Mazda shall rend it to pieces, and bury it
under the ground <span id="fr_634"></span>[1](#fn_629.md).

14 (33). ‘But if it has not been defiled with seed, or sweat, or dirt,
or vomit, then the worshippers of Mazda shall wash it with gômêz.

15 (35). ‘If it be leather, they shall wash it with gômêz three times,
they shall rub it with earth three times, they shall wash it with water
three times, and afterwards they shall expose it to the air for three
months at the window of the house.

‘If it be woven cloth, they shall wash it with gômêz six times <span
id="fr_635"></span>[2](#fn_630.md), they shall rub it with earth six times,
they shall wash it with water six times, and afterwards they shall
expose it to the air for six months at the window of the house.

16 (37). 'The spring named Ardvî Sûra, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! that
spring of mine, purifies the seed in man, the fruit in a woman's womb,
the milk in a woman's breast <span id="fr_636"></span>[3](#fn_631.md).'

17 <span id="fr_637"></span>[4](#fn_632) (41.md). O Maker of the material
world, thou Holy One! Can those clothes, when once washed and cleansed,
ever be used either by a Zaotar, or by a Hâvanan, or by an
Âtare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or by an Âbere*d*, or by an Âsnâtar,
or by a Rathwi*s*kar, or by a Sraoshâ-varez, or by any priest, warrior,
or husbandman?

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

18 (43). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Never can those clothes, even when
washed and cleansed, be used either by a Zaotar, or by a Hâvanan, or by
an Âtare-vakhsha, or by a Frabaretar, or by an Âbere*d*, or by an
Âsnâtar, or by a Rathwi*s*kar, or by a Sraoshâ-varez, or by any priest,
warrior, or husbandman.

19 (45). ‘But if there be in a Mazdean house a woman who is in her
sickness, or a man who has become unfit for work, and who must sit in
the place of infirmity, those clothes shall serve for their coverings
and for their sheets, until they can withdraw and move their hands.

20 (49). ‘Ahura Mazda, indeed, does not allow us to waste anything of
value that we may have, not even so much as an Asperena's weight of
thread, not even so much as a maid lets fall in spinning.

21 (52). ‘Whosoever throws any clothing on a dead body, even so much as
a maid lets fall in spinning, is not a pious man whilst alive, nor shall
he, when dead, have a place in the happy realm.

22 (55). 'He shall go away into the world of the fiends, into that dark
world, made of darkness, the offspring of darkness. To that world, to
the dismal realm, you are delivered by your own doings, by your own
souls, O sinners!'

### IV.

23 (59). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can he be clean
again who has eaten of the carcase of a dog or of the carcase of a
man <span id="fr_638"></span>[1](#fn_633.md)?

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

24 (60). Ahura Mazda answered: 'He cannot, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! His
burrow <span id="fr_639"></span>[1](#fn_634.md) shall be dug out, his life
shall be torn out, his bright eyes shall be put out; the Dru*g* Nasu
falls upon him, takes hold of him even to the end of the nails, and he
is unclean, thenceforth, for ever and ever <span
id="fr_640"></span>[2](#fn_635.md).'

### V.

25 (65). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can he be clean
again, O holy Ahura Mazda! who has brought a corpse with filth into the
waters, or unto the fire, and made either unclean?

26 (66). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘He cannot, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! Those
wicked ones it is, those men turned to Nasus <span
id="fr_641"></span>[3](#fn_636.md), that most increase gnats and
locusts <span id="fr_642"></span>[4](#fn_637.md); those wicked ones it is,
those men turned to Nasus, that most increase the grass-destroying
drought.

27 (69). 'Those wicked ones it is, those men turned to Nasus, that
increase most the power of the winter, produced by the fiends, the
cattle-killing, thick-snowing, overflowing, the piercing,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

fierce, mischievous winter <span id="fr_643"></span>[1](#fn_638.md). Upon
them comes and rushes the Dru*g* Nasu, she takes hold of them even to
the end of the nails, and they are unclean, thenceforth, for ever and
ever <span id="fr_644"></span>[2](#fn_639.md).'

### VI.

28 (72). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the wood be
made clean, O holy Ahura Mazda! whereunto dead matter has been brought
from a dead dog, or from a dead man?

29 (73). Ahura Mazda answered: 'It can, O holy Zarathu*s*tra!'

How so?

‘If the Nasu has not yet been smitten <span
id="fr_645"></span>[3](#fn_640.md) by the corpse-eating dogs, or by the
corpse-eating birds <span id="fr_646"></span>[4](#fn_641.md), they shall
lay down, apart on the ground, the wood on the length of a Vîtasti <span
id="fr_647"></span>[5](#fn_642.md) all around the dead matter, if the wood
be dry; on the length of a Frârâthni <span
id="fr_648"></span>[6](#fn_643.md) all around, if it be wet; then they
shall sprinkle it once over with water, and it shall be clean <span
id="fr_649"></span>[7](#fn_644.md).

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

30 (78). ‘But if the Nasu has already been smitten <span
id="fr_650"></span>[1](#fn_645.md) by the corpse-eating dogs, or by the
corpse-eating birds, they shall lay down, apart on the ground, the wood
on the length of a Frârâthni all around the dead matter, if the wood be
dry; on the length of a Frâbâzu <span id="fr_651"></span>[2](#fn_646.md)
all around, if it be wet; then they shall sprinkle it once over with
water, and it shall be clean.

31 (81). 'This is the quantity of wood around the dead matter, that they
shall lay down, apart on the ground, according as the wood is dry or
wet; according as it is hard or soft; they shall sprinkle it once over
with water, and it shall be clean.'

32 (83). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the corn or
the fodder be made clean, O holy Ahura Mazda! whereunto dead matter has
been brought from a dead dog, or from a dead man?

33 (84). Ahura Mazda answered: 'It can, O holy Zarathu*s*tra!'

How so?

‘If the Nasu has not yet been smitten by the corpse-eating dogs, or by
the corpse-eating birds, they shall lay down, apart on the ground, the
corn on the length of a Frârâthni all around the dead matter, if the
corn be dry; on the length of a Frâbâzu all

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

around if it be wet; then they shall sprinkle it once over with water,
and it shall be clean.

34 (89). ‘But if the Nasu has already been smitten <span
id="fr_652"></span>[1](#fn_647.md) by the corpse-eating dogs, or by the
corpse-eating birds, they shall lay down, apart on the ground, the corn
on the length of a Frâbâzu all around the dead matter, if the corn be
dry; on the length of a Vîbâzu <span id="fr_653"></span>[2](#fn_648.md) all
around, if it be wet; then they shall sprinkle it once over with water,
and it shall be clean.

35 (92). 'This is the quantity of corn around the dead matter, that they
shall lay down, apart on the ground, according as the corn is dry or
wet; according as it is sown or not sown; according as it is reaped or
not reaped; according as it is ground or not ground <span
id="fr_654"></span>[3](#fn_649); according as it is (kneaded.md) <span
id="fr_655"></span>[4](#fn_650.md) or not kneaded; they shall sprinkle it
once over with water, And it shall be clean.'

### VII a.

36 (94). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! If a worshipper
of Mazda want to practice the art of healing, on whom shall he first his
skill? on worshippers of Mazda or on worshippers of the Daêvas?

37 (96). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘On worshippers of the Daêvas shall he
first prove himself,

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

rather than on worshippers of Mazda. If he treat with the knife a
worshipper of the Daêvas and he die; if he treat with the knife a second
worshipper of the Daêvas and he die; if he treat with the knife for the
third time a worshipper of the Daêvas and he die, he is unfit to
practise the art of healing for ever and ever.

38 (99). ‘Let him therefore never attend any worshipper of Mazda; let
him never treat with the knife any worshipper of Mazda, nor wound him
with the knife. If he shall ever attend any worshipper of Mazda, if he
shall ever treat with the knife any worshipper of Mazda, and wound him
with the knife, he shall pay for it the same penalty as is paid for
wilful murder <span id="fr_656"></span>[1](#fn_651.md).

39 (102). ‘If he treat with the knife a worshipper of the Daêvas and he
recover; if he treat with the knife a second worshipper of the Daêvas
and he recover; if for the third time he treat with the knife a
worshipper of the Daêvas and he recover; then he is fit to practise the
art of healing for ever and ever <span id="fr_657"></span>[2](#fn_652.md).

40 (104). ‘He may henceforth at his will, attend worshippers of Mazda;
he may at his will treat with the knife worshippers of Mazda, and heal
them with the knife.

### VII b.

41 (105). ‘A healer shall heal a priest for a holy

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

blessing <span id="fr_658"></span>[1](#fn_653.md); he shall heal the master
of a house for the value of an ox of low value; he shall heal the lord
of a borough <span id="fr_659"></span>[2](#fn_654.md) for the value of an
ox of average value; he shall heal the lord of a town for the value of
an ox of high value; he shall heal the lord of a province for the value
of a chariot and four <span id="fr_660"></span>[3](#fn_655.md).

42 (110). ‘He shall heal the wife of the master of a house for the value
of a she-ass; he shall heal the wife of the lord of a borough for the
value of a cow; he shall heal the wife of the lord of a town for the
value of a mare; he shall heal the wife of the lord of a province for
the value of a she-camel.

43 (114) ‘He shall heal the son of the lord of a borough for the value
of an ox of high value; he shall heal an ox of high value for the value
of an ox of average value; he shall heal an ox of average value for that
of an ox of low value; he shall heal an ox of low value for the value of
a sheep; he shall heal a sheep for the value of a meal of meat <span
id="fr_661"></span>[4](#fn_656.md).

44 (118). 'If several healers offer themselves together, O Spitama
Zarathu*s*tra! namely, one who heals with the knife, one who heals with
herbs, and one who heals with the holy word <span
id="fr_662"></span>[5](#fn_657.md), it is this one

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

who will best drive away sickness from the body of the faithful <span
id="fr_663"></span>[1](#fn_658.md).'

### VIII.

45 (122). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long after
the corpse of a dead man has been laid down on the ground, clothed with
the light of heaven and beholding the sun, is the ground itself
again <span id="fr_664"></span>[2](#fn_659.md)?

46 (123). Ahura Mazda answered: 'When the corpse of a dead man has lain
on the ground for a year, clothed with the light of heaven, and
beholding the sun, then the ground is itself again, O holy
Zarathu*s*tra <span id="fr_665"></span>[3](#fn_660.md)!'

47 (124). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long after
the corpse of a dead man has been buried in the earth, is the earth
itself again?

48 (125). Ahura Mazda answered: 'When the corpse of a dead man has lain
buried in the earth for fifty years, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! then the
earth is itself again <span id="fr_666"></span>[4](#fn_661.md).'

49 (126). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long after
the corpse of a dead

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

man has been laid down on a Dakhma, is the ground, whereon the Dakhma
stands, itself again?

50 (127). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Not until the dust of the corpse, O
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! has mingled with the dust of the earth <span
id="fr_667"></span>[1](#fn_662.md). Urge every one in the material world, O
Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! to pull down Dakhmas <span
id="fr_668"></span>[2](#fn_663.md).

51 (129). ‘He who should pull down Dakhmas, even so much thereof as the
size of his own body, his sins in thought, word, and deed are remitted
as they would be by a Patet; his sins in thought, word, and deed are
atoned for <span id="fr_669"></span>[3](#fn_664.md)

52 (132). 'Not for his soul shall the two spirits wage war with one
another <span id="fr_670"></span>[4](#fn_665.md); and when he enters the
blissful world, the stars, the moon, and the sun shall rejoice in him;
and I, Ahura Mazda, shall rejoice in him, saying: "Hail, O man! thou who
hast just passed from the decaying world into the undecaying one!"'

55 <span id="fr_671"></span>[5](#fn_666) (137.md). O Maker of the material
world, thou

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Holy One! Where
are the fiends? Where are the worshippers of the fiends? What is the
place whereon the troops of fiends rush together? What is the place
whereon the troops of fiends come rushing along? What is the place
whereon they rush together to kill their fifties and their hundreds,
their hundreds and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of
thousands, their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads?

56 (138). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Those Dakhmas that are built upon the
face of the earth, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! and whereon are laid the
corpses Of dead men, that is the place where the fiends are, that is the
place whereon the troops of fiends rush together, that is the place
whereon the troops of fiends come rushing along, that is the place
whereon they rush together to kill their fifties and their hundreds,
their hundreds and their thousands, their thousands and their tens of
thousands, their tens of thousands and their myriads of myriads.

57 (140). ‘On those Dakhmas, O Spitama Zarathu*s*tra! those fiends take
food and void filth, (eating up corpses) in the same way as you, men, in
the material world, eat cooked meal and cooked meat. It is, as it were,
the smell of their feeding that you smell there, O men!

58 (143). ‘Thus the fiends revel on there, until that stench is rooted
in the Dakhmas. Thus from the Dakhmas arise the infection of diseases,
itch, hot fever, humours <span id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_667.md), cold
fever, rickets, and hair untimely white. There death has most power on
man, from the hour when the sun is down.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

59 (148). 'And if there be people of evil spirit who do not seek for
better spirit, the *G*ainis <span id="fr_673"></span>[1](#fn_668.md) make
those diseases grow stronger by a third <span
id="fr_674"></span>[2](#fn_669.md), on their thighs, on their hands, on
their plaited hair <span id="fr_675"></span>[3](#fn_670.md).'

### IX.

60 <span id="fr_676"></span>[4](#fn_671) (151.md). O Maker of the material
world, thou Holy One! If in the house of a worshipper of Mazda there be
a woman with child, and if being a month gone, or two, or three, or
four, or five, or six, or seven, or eight, or nine, or ten months gone,
she bring forth a still-born child, what shall the worshippers of Mazda
do?

61 (155). Ahura Mazda answered: 'The place in that Mazdean house whereof
the ground is the cleanest and the driest, and the least passed through
by flocks and herds, by Fire, the son of Ahura Mazda, by the consecrated
bundles of baresma, and by the faithful;'--

62 (158). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How far from the
fire? How far from the water? How far from the consecrated bundles of
baresma? How far from the faithful?

63 (159). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Thirty paces from the fire; thirty
paces from the water; thirty paces from the consecrated bundles of
baresma three paces from the faithful;'--

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

64 (160). 'On that place shall the worshippers of Mazda erect an
enclosure, and therein shall they establish her with food, therein shall
they establish her with clothes.'

65 (162). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What is the food
that the woman shall first take?

66 (163). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘She shall drink gômêz mixed with ashes,
three cups of it, or six, or nine, to wash over the grave in her womb.

67 (166). 'Afterwards she may drink boiling milk of mares, cows, sheep,
or goats, with pap or without pap; she may take cooked meat without
water, bread without water, and wine without water.'

68 (169). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How long shall
she remain so? How long shall she live only on that sort of meat, bread,
and wine?

69 (170). Ahura Mazda answered: 'Three nights long shall she remain so;
three nights long shall she live on that sort of meat, bread, and wine.
Then, when three nights have passed, she shall wash her body, she shall
wash her clothes, with gômêz and water, by the nine holes, and thus
shall she be clean.'

70 O 72). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! But if fever
befall her unclean body, if that twofold plague, hunger and thirst,
befall her, may she be allowed to drink water?

71 (175). Ahura Mazda answered: 'She may; the first thing for her is to
have her life saved. Having been allowed by one of the holy men, by a
holy faithful man, who knows the holy

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

knowledge <span id="fr_677"></span>[1](#fn_672.md), she shall drink of the
strength-giving water. But you, worshippers of Mazda, fix ye the penalty
for it. The Ratu being applied to, the Sraoshâ-varez being applied
to <span id="fr_678"></span>[2](#fn_673.md), shall prescribe the penalty to
be paid <span id="fr_679"></span>[3](#fn_674.md).'

72 (181). What is the penalty to be paid?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'The deed is that of a Peshôtanu: two hundred
stripes with the Aspahê-a*s*tra, two hundred stripes with the
Sraoshô-*k*arana <span id="fr_680"></span>[4](#fn_675.md).'

### X.

73 (183). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the eating
vessels be made clean that have been touched by the carcase of a dog, or
by the corpse of a man?

74 (184). Ahura Mazda answered: 'They can, O holy Zarathu*s*tra!'

How so?

‘If they be of gold, you shall wash them once with gômêz, you shall rub
them once with earth, you shall wash them once with water, and they
shall be clean.

‘If they be of silver, you shall wash them twice with gômêz, you shall
rub them twice with earth, you shall wash them twice with water, and
they shall be clean.

75\. ‘If they be of brass, you shall wash them thrice with gômêz, you
shall rub them thrice with

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

earth, you shall wash them thrice with water, and they shall be clean.

‘If they be of steel, you shall wash them four times with gômêz, you
shall rub them four times with earth, you shall wash them four times
with water, and they shall be clean.

‘If they be of stone, you shall wash them six times with gômêz, you
shall rub them six times with earth, you shall wash them six times with
water, and they shall be clean <span id="fr_681"></span>[1](#fn_676.md).

'If they be of earth, of wood, or of clay, they are unclean for ever and
ever <span id="fr_682"></span>[2](#fn_677.md).'

### XI.

76 (189). O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! Can the cow be
made clean that has eaten of the carcase of a dog, or of the corpse of a
man?

77 (190). Ahura Mazda answered: 'She can, O holy Zarathu*s*tra! The
priest shall not, within a year, take from her to the baresma neither
the milk and cheese that accompany the libation, nor the meat that
accompanies the libation <span id="fr_683"></span>[3](#fn_678.md). When a
year has passed, then the faithful may eat of her as before <span
id="fr_684"></span>[4](#fn_679.md).'

### XII.

78 (193), Who is he, O holy Ahura Mazda! who,

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

with a godly intent, with a godly wish, goes astray from the ways of
God? Who is he who, with a godly intent, falls into the ways of the
Dru*g* <span id="fr_685"></span>[1](#fn_680.md)?

79 (194). Ahura Mazda answered: 'The one who, with a godly intent, with
a godly wish, goes astray from the ways of God; the one who with a godly
intent falls into the ways of the Dru*g*, is he who offers up for
libation water defiled by the dead; or who offers up libations in the
dead of the night <span id="fr_686"></span>[2](#fn_681.md).'

<span id="fn_616"></span>[75:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_621.md) Hell lies in the
north; cf. XIX, 1; Yt. XXII, 25; Bundahi*s* 36, 12.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[75:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_622.md) See Introd. V, 3.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[75:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_623.md) Until the Sag-dîd
has been performed (see Introd. V, 4).

<span id="fn_619"></span>[75:5](sbe0413.htm#fr_624.md) The Sag-dîd may be
performed by birds of prey as well as by dogs (see Introd. V, 4). The
dog smites the Nasu when it brings its muzzle near to the dead, the bird
(mountain hawk, sparrow or eagle) when its shadow passes over the body
(Comm. ad § 2; Cf. § 29). § 3 is from the Vendîdâd Sâdah.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[75:6](sbe0413.htm#fr_625) 'By poison' (Comm..md).

<span id="fn_621"></span>[75:7](sbe0413.htm#fr_626.md) Literally, 'by men;'
that is to say, put to death by the community according to law (Comm.)

<span id="fn_622"></span>[75:8](sbe0413.htm#fr_627.md) If he has strangled
himself. Or possibly, 'by want.'

<span id="fn_623"></span>[76:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_628.md) The day is divided
into five watches or ratu. If the man dies a natural death, the Dru*g*
comes directly; if the death be violent and unlocked for, the Dru*g* is
taken unawares, and it requires time for her to be warned of it and to
come.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[76:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_629.md) §§ 6-9 = Farg. V,
27-30.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[77:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_630.md) This enumeration is
less complete than that in the fifth Fargard, as it comprises only the
first four sorts of dogs, viz. only those that can perform the Sag-dîd
(Comm. ad § 2).

<span id="fn_626"></span>[77:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_631.md) This phrase, which
forms part of § 19, is wrongly inserted here.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[77:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_632.md) The bedding on which
he has died.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[77:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_633.md) That is to say, only
those clothes which have been in direct contact with the dead.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[78:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_634.md) According to the
Commentary only that part which has been defiled is rent off; the rest
may still be used.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[78:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_635.md) See Introd. V, 16.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[78:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_636.md) This clause is a
quotation from Yasna LXV, 5, intended to illustrate the cleansing power
of water. Ardvî Sûra is the Goddess of the waters.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[78:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_637.md) §§ 17-22 = Farg. V,
57-62.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[79:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_638.md) The carcase-eater
lodges the Nasu in himself; he becomes a Nasu, and therefore must be
destroyed; cf. infra § 76 seq.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[80:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_639.md) His house, as he is
assimilated to a devouring Khrafstra.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[80:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_640.md) Till the
resurrection. 'It is prescribed in the Vendîdâd that if a man shall eat
of a carcase, his house and family shall be destroyed, his heart shall
be torn out of his body, his eyes shall be put out, and his soul shall
abide in hell till the resurrection' (Saddar 71, Hyde 7 9). 'He who eats
of a carcase with sinful intent is both unclean and margarzân; Barashnûm
and Nîreng are of no avail for him, he must die. If there has been no
sinful intent, he may wash himself; one may give him the ashes and the
gômêz (Comm.); he is unclean, he is not margarzân' (Old Rav. 115 b).

<span id="fn_636"></span>[80:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_641.md) Doubtful; possibly,
'those Nasu-makers.'

<span id="fn_637"></span>[80:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_642.md) 'It is said in the
Avesta that when there are many gnats and locusts it is owing to corpses
having been brought to water and to fire' (Saddar 72, Hyde 80).

<span id="fn_638"></span>[81:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_643.md) 'In the same way (by
the bringing of corpses to water and to fire), winter grows colder, and
summer grows warmer' (Saddar 72, Hyde 80).

<span id="fn_639"></span>[81:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_644.md) Whoever shall do
that deed, shall pay for it in this world and in the next; they shall
flay his body in the presence of the assembly, they shall tear him limb
from limb, and his corpse shall be thrown away to dogs and ravens, . . .
and when his soul comes to the other world, he shall suffer tortures
from the dêvs (Gr. Rav. p. 123).

<span id="fn_640"></span>[81:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_645.md) That is to say, if
the Sag-dîd has not yet been performed.

<span id="fn_641"></span>[81:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_646.md) See above, [p.
75](#page_75), n. [5](#fn_619.md).

<span id="fn_642"></span>[81:5](sbe0413.htm#fr_647.md) Twelve fingers.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[81:6](sbe0413.htm#fr_648.md) The Frârâthni is, as
it seems, as much as one foot (fourteen fingers, Vd. II, 22, Comm.)

<span id="fn_644"></span>[81:7](sbe0413.htm#fr_649.md) 'After a year,'
according to the Commentary.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[82:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_650.md) It appears from the
similar passages (VIII, 35, 36, and 98, 99) and from the general
principles of uncleanness (see Introd. V, 16) that the words 'If the
Nasu has not yet been smitten,' in § 29, have been misplaced there from
§ 30, and that the corresponding words in § 30 belong to § 29; because
uncleanness spreads less far, when the Sag-dîd has taken place.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[82:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_651.md) A measure of unknown
extent; 'an arm's length,' it would seem.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[83:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_652.md) The same observation
applies to the first words of §§ 33, 34, as was observed of §§ 29, 30.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[83:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_653.md) A measure of unknown
extent; 'an ell,' it would seem.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[83:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_654.md) This clause is
preceded and followed, in the Vendîdâd Sâdah, by clauses which seem to
refer to the process of grinding being more or less advanced.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[83:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_655.md) This word is
supplied, as it appears, from the context, and from the Pahlavi
translation, to be wanting.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[84:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_656.md) For baodhô-var*s*ta,
which word is wrongly understood by the Parsis as the designation of a
penalty, consisting in the amputation of six fingers (Asp.)

<span id="fn_652"></span>[84:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_657.md) 'Some say, One who
has been qualified may become disqualified; one who has been
disqualified shall never become qualified' (Comm. ad § 43).

<span id="fn_653"></span>[85:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_658.md) 'Thus he will become
holy (i.e. he will go to paradise); there no equivalent in money. Some
say, It is given when the priest has not 3000 stîrs' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_654"></span>[85:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_659.md) A group of several
houses; Aspendiârji and Anquetil say, 'a street.'

<span id="fn_655"></span>[85:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_660.md) 'A value of seventy
stîrs' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_656"></span>[85:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_661.md) Cf. the tariff of
fees for the cleanser, Farg. IX, 37 seq.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[85:5](sbe0413.htm#fr_662.md) 'By spells' (Comm.;
cf. Odyssea XIX, 457). This classification was not unknown to Asclepios:
he relieved the sick 'now with caressing spells, now with soothing drink
or balsam, now with the knife' (Pindaros, Pyth. III, 51).

<span id="fn_658"></span>[86:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_663.md) 'It may be that he
may not relieve, but he will not harm' (Comm.) The Vendîdâd Sâdah,
instead of 'it is this one,' &c, reads as follows: 'Let them address
themselves to the one who heals with the holy word; for he is the best
healer among all healers, who heals by the holy word; this one it is who
will drive away sickness from the body of the faithful.' The treatment
by the holy word seems not to consist only in the recitation of spells,
but the spells must be accompanied by the ceremony of the Barashnûm (see
Farg. XXII and Introd. V, 14).

<span id="fn_659"></span>[86:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_664.md) Restored to the
purity of its nature, and fit to till; as it remains Nasu till that
time.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[86:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_665.md) See Farg. VI, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[86:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_666.md) Cf. Farg. III, 36
seq.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[87:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_667.md) A space of time
estimated at fifty years (Comm.) Cf. Farg. III, 13.

<span id="fn_663"></span>[87:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_668.md) Cf. Farg. III, 9,
text and note, and § 13.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[87:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_669.md) 'A tanâfûhr sin is
remitted thereby' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_665"></span>[87:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_670.md) When a man dies,
hell and paradise, fiends and gods struggle for the possession of his
soul: Astôvîdhôtu*s*, Vîzaresha, and the bad Vayu drag the souls of the
wicked to hell; Mithra, Sraosha, Rashnu, and the good Vayu take the
souls of the good to paradise (see Farg. XIX, 29 seq.; Yt. XXII;
Mainyô-i-khard II). The struggle lasts for three days and three nights
(the sadis), during which time the relatives of the dead offer up
prayers and sacrifices to Sraosha, Rashnu, and Vayu, to assure him their
protection (cf. IX, 56).

<span id="fn_666"></span>[87:5](sbe0413.htm#fr_671.md) §§ 53, 54 belong to
the Commentary; they are composed of disconnected quotations, part of
which refers to the different deeds by which a tanâfûhr sin may be
redeemed, while the other part refers to the rules of what may be called
the book-keeping of good actions and sins.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[88:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_672) Doubtful (naêza.md).

<span id="fn_668"></span>[89:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_673) 'The *G*ahi' (Comm..md)
The *G*aini seems to be the *G*ahi as bringing sickness (cf. Farg. XXI,
2).

<span id="fn_669"></span>[89:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_674.md) The general meaning
of the sentence is that the Dakhmas are seats of infection, of which the
action becomes worse and stronger when people live in impiety and vices.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[89:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_675.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[89:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_676.md) §§ 60-69 = Farg. V,
45-54.

<span id="fn_672"></span>[91:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_677.md) The Dastur.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[91:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_678.md) See Farg. V, 25.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[91:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_679.md) For the water having
been defiled.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[91:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_680.md) A penalty to be
undergone by the husband, at least in modern practice: 'If through fear
of death or of serious illness she has drunk water before the appointed
time, her husband shall make Patet for her fault before the Dastur' (Old
Rav. 98 b).

<span id="fn_676"></span>[92:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_681.md) From the Vendîdâd
Sâdah.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[92:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_682.md) See Introd. V, 16.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[92:3](sbe0413.htm#fr_683.md) The offering of the
libation waters (Zaothra) is accompanied with offerings of milk, cheese,
and meat, which the priest eats holding the baresma in his hand.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[92:4](sbe0413.htm#fr_684.md) 'Whatever comes from
her, if dropped, is clean; if taken, unclean. If she be big with young,
the young is born clean, if conceived before her eating of the corpse;
if conceived afterwards, it is born unclean' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_680"></span>[93:1](sbe0413.htm#fr_685.md) Possibly, works for
the Dru*g*.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[93:2](sbe0413.htm#fr_686.md) 'From what hour may
the good waters be offered up? From sunrise to sunset. He who offers up
the good waters after sunset, before sunrise, does no better deed than
if he should shed them downright into the jaws of the venomous snake'
(Nîrangistân, in the Zand-Pahlavi Glossary, p. 76).
