## FARGARD XIV.

This Fargard is nothing more than an appendix to the last clauses in the
preceding Fargard (§ 50 seq.) How the murder of a water dog may be
atoned for is described in it at full length. As the water dog is the
holiest of all dogs <span id="fr_883"></span>[3](#fn_871.md), and, as it
were, a link between the dog and God, the process of atonement must be
one of an extraordinary character. It is this chapter, more than any
other, which may make it doubtful whether the legislation of the
Vendîdâd has ever existed as real and living law. See, however,
Introduction V, 20.

1\. Zarathu*s*tra asked Ahura Mazda: 'O Ahura Mazda, most beneficent
Spirit, Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! He who smites one of
those water dogs that are born one from a thousand dogs and a thousand
she-dogs <span id="fr_884"></span>[4](#fn_872.md), so that he gives up the
ghost and the soul parts from the body, what is the penalty that he
shall pay?'

2 (4). Ahura Mazda answered: ‘He shall pay ten thousand stripes with the
Aspahê-a*s*tra, ten thousand stripes with the Sraoshô-*k*arana <span
id="fr_885"></span>[5](#fn_873.md).

‘He shall godly and piously bring unto the fire of Ahura Mazda <span
id="fr_886"></span>[1](#fn_874.md) ten thousand loads of hard, well dried,
well examined <span id="fr_887"></span>[2](#fn_875.md) wood, as an
atonement unto the soul (of the water dog).

3 (6). ‘He shall godly and piously bring unto the fire of Ahura Mazda
ten thousand loads of soft wood, of Urvâsna, Vohu-gaona, Vohu-kereti,
Hadhâ-naêpata <span id="fr_888"></span>[3](#fn_876.md), or any
sweet-scented plant, as an atonement unto the soul (of the water dog).

4 (7). ‘He shall godly and piously tie and consecrate ten thousand
bundles of baresma; he shall offer up to the good waters ten thousand
Zaothra libations with the Haoma and the sacred meat <span
id="fr_889"></span>[4](#fn_877.md), cleanly prepared and well strained,
cleanly prepared and well strained by a pious man <span
id="fr_890"></span>[5](#fn_878.md), as an atonement unto the soul (of the
water dog).

5 (9). ‘He shall kill ten thousand snakes of those that go upon the
belly; he shall kill ten thousand

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

snakes of those that have the shape of a dog <span
id="fr_891"></span>[1](#fn_879.md); he shall kill ten thousand tortoises;
he shall kill ten thousand land frogs <span
id="fr_892"></span>[2](#fn_880.md); he shall kill ten thousand water frogs;
he shall kill ten thousand corn-carrying ants <span
id="fr_893"></span>[3](#fn_881.md); he shall kill ten thousand ants of
those that bite and dig holes and work mischief <span
id="fr_894"></span>[4](#fn_882.md).

6 (16). ‘He shall kill ten thousand earth worms; he shall kill ten
thousand horrid flies <span id="fr_895"></span>[5](#fn_883.md).

‘He shall fill up ten thousand holes for the unclean <span
id="fr_896"></span>[6](#fn_884.md).

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

‘He shall godly and piously give to godly men twice seven sets of
implements for the fire, as an atonement unto the soul (of the water
dog), namely:

7 (20). ‘Two (loads of the) proper materials for fire <span
id="fr_897"></span>[1](#fn_885.md); a broom <span
id="fr_898"></span>[2](#fn_886.md); a pair of tongs; a pair of round
bellows <span id="fr_899"></span>[3](#fn_887.md) extended at the bottom,
contracted at the top; an adze with a sharp edge and a sharp-pointed
handle <span id="fr_900"></span>[4](#fn_888.md), a saw with sharp teeth and
a sharp-pointed handle, by means of which the worshippers of Mazda
procure wood for the fire of Ahura Mazda.

8 (26). ‘He shall godly and piously give to godly men a set of the
priestly instruments of which the priests make use, as an atonement unto
the soul (of the water dog), namely: The A*s*tra <span
id="fr_901"></span>[5](#fn_889.md), the meat-vessel <span
id="fr_902"></span>[6](#fn_890.md), the Paitidâna <span

the baresma.

war implements of which the warriors make use <span

id="fr_911"></span>[7](#fn_899.md), the third a club, the fourth a
bow <span id="fr_912"></span>[8](#fn_900.md), the fifth a quiver <span

brass-headed arrows <span id="fr_914"></span>[10](#fn_902.md), the sixth a
sling with arm-string and with thirty sling stones, the seventh a

girdle, the twelfth a pair of greaves <span
id="fr_918"></span>[14](#fn_906.md).

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

10 (41). ‘He shall godly and piously give to godly men a set of all the
implements of which the husbandmen make use, as an atonement unto the
soul (of the water dog), namely: A plough with share and yoke <span
id="fr_919"></span>[1](#fn_907.md), an ox whip <span
id="fr_920"></span>[2](#fn_908.md), a mortar of stone, a hand-mill for
grinding corn,

11 (48). 'A spade for digging and tilling; one measure of silver and one
measure of gold.'

O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How much silver?

Ahura Mazda answered: 'The price of a stallion:'

O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! How much gold?

Ahura Mazda answered: ‘The price of a camel.

12 (54). 'He shall godly and piously procure a rill of running water for
godly husbandmen, as an atonement unto the soul (of the water dog).'

dog <span id="fr_921"></span>[3](#fn_909.md).

13 (57). 'He shall godly and piously give a piece of arable land to
godly men, as an atonement unto the soul (of the water dog).'

both sides <span id="fr_922"></span>[4](#fn_910.md).

14 (60). 'He shall godly and piously procure for godly men a house with
ox-stalls, with nine

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

hâthras and nine nematas <span id="fr_923"></span>[1](#fn_911.md), as an
atonement unto the soul (of the water dog) <span
id="fr_924"></span>[2](#fn_912.md).'

O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One I How large is the house?

Ahura Mazda answered: ‘Twelve Vîtâras <span
id="fr_925"></span>[3](#fn_913.md) in the largest part of the house, nine
Vîtâras in the middle part, six Vîtâras in the smallest part.

166</span> see Introd. V, 2 1). 'If he can afford it, he will alone in
the manner stated in the Avesta; if he cannot afford it, it will be
sufficient to perform a complete Iza*s*nê (sacrifice),' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_874"></span>[166:1](sbe0420.htm#fr_886.md) To the altar of the
Bahrâm fire.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[166:2](sbe0420.htm#fr_887.md) 'It is forbidden to
take any ill-smelling thing to the fire and to kindle it on it; it is
forbidden to kindle green wood, and even though the wood were hard and
dry, one must examine it three times, lest there may be any hair or any
unclean matter upon it' (Gr. Rav.) Although the pious Ar*d*â Vîrâf had
always taken the utmost care never to put on the fire any wood but such
as was seven years old, yet, when he entered paradise, Atar, the genius
of fire, shewed him reproachfully a large tank full of the water which
that wood had exuded (see Ar*d*â Vîrâf X).

<span id="fn_876"></span>[166:3](sbe0420.htm#fr_888.md) See above, [p.
94](sbe0414.htm#page_94), n. [1](sbe0414.htm#fn_682.md).

<span id="fn_877"></span>[166:4](sbe0420.htm#fr_889.md) Possibly milk.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[166:5](sbe0420.htm#fr_890.md) A Mobed called
sardâr, 'chief,' who prepares, cleanses, and disposes everything for the
performance of the Yasna (Comm. and Anquetil, Brouillons ad Farg. XVIII,
72).

<span id="fn_879"></span>[167:1](sbe0420.htm#fr_891.md) 'Mâr bânak snakes:
they are dog-like, because they sit on their hindparts' (Comm.) The cat
seems to be the animal intended by this name. In a paraphrase of this
passage in a Parsi Ravaet, the cat is numbered amongst the Khrafstras
which it is enjoined to kill to redeem a sin (India Office Library,
VIII, 13); cf. G. du Chinon, p. 462: 'Les animaux que les Gaures ont en
horreur sont les serpents, les couleuvres, les lezars, et autres de
cette espece, les crapaux, les grenouïlles, les écrevisses, les rats et
souris, et sur tout le chat.'

<span id="fn_880"></span>[167:2](sbe0420.htm#fr_892.md) 'Those that can go
out of water and live on the dry ground' (Comm.) 'Pour les grenouïlles
et crapaux, ils disent que ce sont ceux (eux?) qui sont cause de ce que
les hommes meurent, gâtans les eaus où ils habitent continuellement, et
que d'autant plus qu'il y en a dans le païs, d'autant plus les eaus
causent-elles des maladies et enfin la mort,' G. du Chinon, p. 465.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[167:3](sbe0420.htm#fr_893.md) 'Un jour que
j’étois surpris de la guerre qu’ils font aux fourmis, ils me dirent que
ces animaux ne faisaient que voler par des amas des grains plus qu’il
n’étoit nécessaire pour leur nourriture,' G. du Chinon, p. 464. Firdusi
protested against the proscription: 'Do no harm to the corn-carrying
ant; a living thing it is, and its life is dear to it.' The celebrated
high-priest of the Parsis, the late Moola Firooz, entered those lines
into his Pand Nâmah, which may be token better days for this wise and
careful creature.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[167:4](sbe0420.htm#fr_894.md) Doubtful. The
Commentary has, 'that is, dârak ants (wood ants; termites?).'

<span id="fn_883"></span>[167:5](sbe0420.htm#fr_895.md) Corpse flies.

<span id="fn_884"></span>[167:6](sbe0420.htm#fr_896.md) 'The holes at which
the unclean are washed' (Comm.; cf. IX, 6 seq.)

<span id="fn_885"></span>[168:1](sbe0420.htm#fr_897.md) Doubtful: the
intended materials would be two loads of wood, and two loads of incense
to burn upon the wood (Asp.)

<span id="fn_886"></span>[168:2](sbe0420.htm#fr_898.md) To cleanse the
Atash-dân or fire-vessel (Yasna IX, 1).

<span id="fn_887"></span>[168:3](sbe0420.htm#fr_899.md) Or, a fan.

<span id="fn_888"></span>[168:4](sbe0420.htm#fr_900.md) Asp.; literally,
'sharp-kneed.'

<span id="fn_889"></span>[168:5](sbe0420.htm#fr_901.md) The Aspahê-a*s*tra;
see Introd. V, 19.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[168:6](sbe0420.htm#fr_902.md) Possibly, the
milk-vessel.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[168:7](sbe0420.htm#fr_903.md) As everything that
goes out of man is unclean, his breath defiles all that it touches;
priests, therefore, while on duty, and even laymen, while praying or
eating, must wear a mouth-veil, the Paitidâna (Parsi Penôm), consisting
'of two pieces of white cotton cloth, hanging loosely from the bridge of
the nose to, at least, two inches below the mouth, and tied with two
strings at the back of the head' (Haug, Essays, 2nd ed. p. 243, n. 1;
cf. Comm. ad Farg. XVIII, 1, and Anquetil II, 530). This principle
appears not to have been peculiar to the Zoroastrian Aryans, for the
Slavonian priest in Arkona was enjoined to go out of the temple,
whenever he wanted to draw breath, 'lest the presence of the god should
be defiled by contact with mortal breath' (ne dei presentia mortalis
spiritus contagio pollueretur, Saxo Grammaticus, ap. Klek, Einleitung in
die Slavische Literatur, p. 105). Cf. Introd. V, 8.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[168:8](sbe0420.htm#fr_904.md) The
'Khrafstra-killer;' an instrument for killing snakes, &c.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[169:1](sbe0420.htm#fr_905.md) See Introd. V; 19.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[169:2](sbe0420.htm#fr_906.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[169:3](sbe0420.htm#fr_907.md) The cup in which
the juice of the hom and of the urvarân (the twigs of hadhâ-naêpata
which are pounded together with the hom) is received from the mortar
(Comm.)

<span id="fn_896"></span>[169:4](sbe0420.htm#fr_908.md) The cup on which
twigs of Haoma are laid before being pounded, the so-called tashtah
(Anquetil II, 533); 'some say, the hom-strainer' a saucer with nine
holes, Comm.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[169:5](sbe0420.htm#fr_909.md) The armament
detailed in the text agrees partly with that of the Persians and Medians
described by Herodotos (VII, 61, 62). It would be desirable for
archaeologists to ascertain to what time and, if possible, to what
province this description refers, as such information might throw some
light upon the age of this part of the Avesta at least.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[169:6](sbe0420.htm#fr_910.md) Αἰχμὰς δὲ Βραχέας

<span id="fn_901"></span>[169:9](sbe0420.htm#fr_913.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[169:10](sbe0420.htm#fr_914.md) Ὀϊστοὺς δὲ
καλαμίνους.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[169:11](sbe0420.htm#fr_915.md) Λεπίδος σιδηρέησ

<span id="fn_904"></span>[169:12](sbe0420.htm#fr_916.md) 'Going from the
helm to the cuirass' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_905"></span>[169:13](sbe0420.htm#fr_917.md) 'Under the
cuirass' (Comm.); περὶ δὲ τὸ σῶμα κιθῶνας χειριδωτοὺς ποικίλους.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[169:14](sbe0420.htm#fr_918.md) Περὶ δὲ τὰ σκέλεα
ἀναξυρίδας.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[170:1](sbe0420.htm#fr_919.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[170:2](sbe0420.htm#fr_920.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_909"></span>[170:3](sbe0420.htm#fr_921.md) Which is estimated
'a foot deep, a foot broad' (Comm.)

<span id="fn_910"></span>[170:4](sbe0420.htm#fr_922.md) Doubtful.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[171:1](sbe0420.htm#fr_923.md) Meaning unknown.

<span id="fn_912"></span>[171:2](sbe0420.htm#fr_924.md) He shall build a
caravansary, which is considered a pious work (Mainyô-i-khard IV, 6;
XXXVII, 36).

<span id="fn_913"></span>[171:3](sbe0420.htm#fr_925.md) A word of unknown
meaning; probably a measure, but possibly 'a passage or alley.'

<span id="fn_914"></span>[171:4](sbe0420.htm#fr_926.md) Those three words
are doubtful.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[172:1](sbe0420.htm#fr_927.md) Cf. Farg. V, 62.
