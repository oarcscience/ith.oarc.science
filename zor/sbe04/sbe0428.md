## FARGARD XXII.

Angra Mainyu creates 99,999 diseases: Ahura Mazda applies for healing to
the holy word and to Airyaman.

Airyaman is an old Indo-Iranian god: in the Rig-veda he is an Âditya
(Aryaman), who is seldom invoked alone, but nearly always in company
with Mitra and Varu*n*a. His name, like Mitra's, means, 'the friend,'
and, like Mitra, he is the god of heavenly light, kind, beneficent, and
helpful to man.

In the Avesta the word Airyaman has the same meaning as in the Veda; but
the character of the god is more fully developed, and whereas he has no
distinct personality in the Vedic hymns, he appears here in the
character of a healing god, which is derived in a very natural manner
from his primitive and general character.

Airyaman abides in a mansion called the mansion of Airyaman (Airyamnô
nmânem), which is the same as 'the bright mansion in

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

which Mitra, Aryaman, Varu*n*a abide,' according to the Vedas, that is
to say, the sky. In later Parsism, Airyaman appears as 'the Ized of
Heaven <span id="fr_1175"></span>[1](#fn_1161.md).'

This Fargard is unfinished or, more correctly, the end of it is
understood. Airyaman, called out from his mansion, comes and digs nine
furrows. It is no doubt in order to perform the Barashnûm <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[2](#fn_1162.md) or some ceremony of that kind, in
order to cleanse the unclean, that is to say, the sick man <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[3](#fn_1163.md), and to restore him to health by
virtue of the Nirang and of the holy word. The Fargard ends therefore
with spells against sickness and against death.

### I.

\[1. Ahura Mazda spake unto Spitama Zarathu*s*tra, saying: ‘I, Ahura
Mazda, the Maker of all good things, when I made this mansion <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[4](#fn_1164.md), the beautiful, the shining, seen afar
(there may I go up, there may I pass!)

2 (5). ‘Then the ruffian looked at me <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[5](#fn_1165.md); the ruffian Angra Mainyu, the deadly,
wrought by his witchcraft nine diseases, and ninety, and nine hundred,
and nine thousand, and nine times ten thousand diseases. So mayst thou
heal me, O Mãthra Spe*n*ta <span id="fr_1180"></span>[6](#fn_1166.md), thou
most glorious one!

3 (8). ‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand fleet, swift-running
steeds; offer them up <span id="fr_1181"></span>[7](#fn_1167.md) as a
sacrifice unto the good Saoka <span id="fr_1182"></span>[8](#fn_1168.md),
made by Mazda and holy.

‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand fleet,

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

high-humped camels; offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka,
made by Mazda and holy.

4 (12). ‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand brown oxen that do
not push <span id="fr_1183"></span>[1](#fn_1169.md); offer them up as a
sacrifice unto the good Saoka, made by Mazda and holy.

‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand young of all species of
small cattle; offer them up as a sacrifice unto Saoka, made by Mazda and
holy.

5 (16). ‘And I will bless thee with the fair, holy blessing-spell, the
friendly, holy blessing-spell, that makes the empty swell to fulness and
the full to overflowing, that comes to help him who was sickening, and
makes the sick man sound again.

6 (20). 'Mãthra Spe*n*ta, the all-glorious, replied unto me: "How shall
I heal thee? How shall I drive away from thee those nine diseases, and
those ninety, those nine hundred, those nine thousand, and those nine
times ten thousand diseases?"'

### II.

7 (22). The Maker Ahura Mazda called for Nairyô-sangha <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[2](#fn_1170.md): Go thou, Nairyô-sangha, the herald,
and drive towards the mansion of Airyaman, and speak thus unto him:

8 (23). Thus speaks Ahura Mazda, the Holy One, unto thee: ‘I, Ahura
Mazda, the Maker of all good things when I made this mansion, the

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

beautiful, the shining, seen afar (there may I go up, there may I pass!)

9 (24). ‘Then the ruffian looked at me; the ruffian Angra Mainyu, the
deadly, wrought by his witchcraft nine diseases, and ninety, and nine
hundred, and nine thousand, and nine times ten thousand diseases. So
mayst thou heal me, O Airyaman, the much-desired!

10 (26). ‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand fleet,
swift-running steeds; offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka,
made by Mazda and holy.

‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand fleet, high-humped camels;
offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka, made by Mazda and
holy.

11 (30). ‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand brown oxen that do
not push; offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka, made by
Mazda and holy.

‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand young of all species of
small cattle; offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka, made by
Mazda and holy.

12 (34). 'And I will bless thee with the fair, holy blessing-spell, the
friendly, holy blessing-spell, that makes the empty swell to fulness and
the full to overflowing, that comes to help him who was sickening, and
makes the sick man sound again.'

### III.

13 (38). In obedience to Ahura's words he went, Nairyô-sangha, the
herald; he drove towards the mansion of Airyaman, he spake unto
Airyaman, saying:

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

14 (38). Thus speaks Ahura Mazda, the Holy One, unto thee: ‘I, Ahura
Mazda, the Maker of all good things, when I made this mansion, the
beautiful, the shining, seen afar (there may I go up, there may I pass!)

15 (39). ‘Then the ruffian looked at me; the ruffian Angra Mainyu the
deadly, wrought by his witchcraft nine diseases, and ninety, and nine
hundred, and nine thousand, and nine times ten thousand diseases. So
mayst thou heal me, O Airyaman, the much-desired!

16 (40). ‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand fleet,
swift-running steeds; offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka,
made by Mazda and holy.

‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand fleet, high-humped camels;
offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka, made by Mazda and
holy.

17 (44). ‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand brown oxen that do
not push; offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka, made by
Mazda and holy.

‘Unto thee will I give in return a thousand young of all species of
small cattle; offer them up as a sacrifice unto the good Saoka, made by
Mazda and holy.

18 (48). 'And I will bless thee with the fair, holy blessing-spell, the
friendly, holy blessing-spell, that makes the empty swell to fulness and
the full to overflowing, that comes to help him who was sickening, and
makes the sick man sound again.'

### IV.

19 (52). Quickly was it done, nor was it long, eagerly set off the
much-desired Airyaman, towards

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

the mountain of the holy questions <span
id="fr_1185"></span>[1](#fn_1171.md), towards the forest of the holy
questions.

20 (54). Nine stallions brought he with him, the much-desired
Airyaman <span id="fr_1186"></span>[2](#fn_1172.md).

Nine camels brought he with him, the much desired Airyaman.

Nine bulls brought he with him, the much desired Airyaman.

Nine head of small cattle brought he with him, the much-desired
Airyaman.

He brought with him the nine twigs <span
id="fr_1187"></span>[3](#fn_1173.md); he drew along nine furrows <span
id="fr_1188"></span>[4](#fn_1174.md).

\[21 <span id="fr_1189"></span>[5](#fn_1175.md). ‘I drive away Ishirê!, I
drive away Aghûirê, I drive away Aghra, I drive away Ughra; I drive away
sickness, I drive away death, I drive away pain and fever; I drive away
Sârana, I drive away Sârastya, I drive away A*z*ana, I drive away
A*z*ahva, I drive away Kurugha, I drive away A*z*ivâka, I drive away
Duruka, I drive away Astairya; I drive away the disease, rottenness, and
infection which Angra Mainyu has created by his witchcraft against the
bodies of mortals.

22\. ‘I drive away all manner of diseases and deaths, all the Yâtus and
Pairikas, and all the wicked *G*ainis.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

23\. ‘May the much-desired Airyaman come here for the men and women of
Zarathu*s*tra to rejoice, for the faithful to rejoice; with the
desirable reward that is won by means of the law, and with that boon for
holiness that is vouchsafed by Ahura.

24\. ‘May the much-desired Airyaman smite all manner of diseases and
deaths, all the Yâtus and Pairikas, and all the wicked *G*ainis.

25\. ‘Yathâ ahû vairyô:--the will of the Lord is the law of holiness;
the riches of Vohu-manô shall be given to him who works in this world
for Mazda, and wields according to the will of Ahura the power he gave
him to relieve the poor.

‘K*e*m nâ mazdâ:--whom hast thou placed to protect me, O Mazda! while
the hate of the fiend is grasping me? Whom but thy Âtar and Vohu-manô,
by whose work the holy world goes on? Reveal to me the rules of thy law!

‘K*e* verethrem *g*â:--who is he who will smite the fiend in order to
maintain thy ordinances? Teach me clearly thy rules for this world and
for the next, that Sraosha may come with Vohu-manô and help whomsoever
thou pleasest.

'Keep us from our hater, O Mazda and Ârmaiti Spe*n*ta! Perish, O
fiendish Dru*g*! Perish, O brood of the fiend! Perish, O world of the
fiend! Perish away, O Dru*g*! Perish away to the regions of the north,
never more to give unto death the living world of the holy spirit!'\]
