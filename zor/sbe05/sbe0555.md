### CHAPTER XI.

1\. As he (Aharman) came seventhly to fire, which was all together
*against* him, the fire *separated* into five kinds <span
id="fr_1028"></span>[3](#fn_1021), which are called the Propitious, the
Good diffuser, the Aûrvâzî*s*t, the Vâzî*s*t, and the
Supremely-*benefiting*. 2. And it produced the Propitious fire itself in
heaven (garô*d*mân); its manifestation is in the fire which is burning
on the earth, and its propitiousness is this, that all the kinds are of
its nature. 3. *The Good diffuser* is that which is in men and
animals <span id="fr_1029"></span>[4](#fn_1022), and its business
*consists* in the digestion of the food, the sleeping of the

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

body, *and* the brightening of the eyes. 4. The Aûrvâzî*s*t is that
which is in plants, in whose seed *it* is formed, and its business
*consists* in piercing the earth, warming the chilled water <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[1](#fn_1023) and producing the qualities and
fragrance of plants and blossoms therefrom, and elaborating the ripened
produce into many fruits. 5. And the Vâzî*s*t is that which has its
motion in a cloud, and its business *consists* in destroying the
atmospheric gloom and darkness, and making the thickness of the
atmosphere fine and propitious in quality, sifting the hail, moderately
warming the water which the cloud holds, *and* making sultry weather
showery. 6. The Supremely-benefiting, like the sky, is that glory whose
lodgment is in the Behrâm fire <span id="fr_1031"></span>[2](#fn_1024),
as the master of the house is over the house, *and* whose propitious
power *arises* from the growing brightness of the fire, the blazing
forth in <span id="fr_1032"></span>[3](#fn_1025) the purity of the
place, the praise of God (yazdânŏ), *and* the practice of good works. 7.
And its business is *that* it struggles with the spiritual fiend, it
watches the forms of the witches—who walk up from the river <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[4](#fn_1026), wear woven clothing, disturb the
luminaries by the concealment of stench, *and* by witchcraft injure the
creatures—and the occurrences of destruction, burning, and celebration
of witchcraft, especially at night; being an assistant of Srôsh the
righteous.

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

8\. And in the beginning of the creation <span
id="fr_1034"></span>[1](#fn_1027) the whole earth was delivered over
into the guardianship of the sublime Frôbak fire, the mighty Gû*s*nasp
fire, and the beneficial Bûr*z*în-Mitrô fire <span
id="fr_1035"></span>[2](#fn_1028), *which* are like priest, warrior, and
husbandman. 9. The place of the fire Frôbak was formed *on* the
Gadman-hômand ('glorious') mountain in Khvâri*z*em <span
id="fr_1036"></span>[3](#fn_1029), the fire Gû*s*nasp *was* on the
Asnavand mountain in Âtarô-pâtakân, *and* the fire Bûr*z*în-Mitrô on the
Rêvand mountain which is in the Ridge *of* Vi*s*tâsp, and its material
manifestation in the world was the most complete.

10\. In the reign of Hôshâng <span id="fr_1037"></span>[4](#fn_1030),
when men were continually going forth to the *other* regions (kêshvar)
on the ox Srûvô <span id="fr_1038"></span>[5](#fn_1031), one night,
half-way, while admiring the fires, the fire-stands which were prepared
in three places on the back of the ox, *and* in which the fire was, fell
into the sea, and the substance of that one great fire *which* was
manifest, is divided into three, *and* they established *it* on the
three fire-stands, and it became itself three glories whose lodgments
are in the Frôbak fire, the Gû*s*nasp fire, and the Bûr*z*în-Mitrô <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[6](#fn_1032).

Bundahi*s*, and the fifth being the Berezi-savang, which is the first in
the Bundahi*s*.

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[185:4](sbe0555.htm#fr_1033) Or 'sea'
(darîyâ*v*ŏ). This long-winded sentence is more involved and obscure in
the original than in the translation.

'creature.'

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[186:2](sbe0555.htm#fr_1035) The epithets of
these three sacred fires are, respectively, var*g*ân, tagîkŏ, and
pûr-sû*d*ŏ in Pahlavi.

<span id="fn_1032"></span>[186:6](sbe0555.htm#fr_1039) The remainder of
'the sayings of Zâ*d*-sparam, about the meeting of the beneficent spirit
*and* the evil spirit,' have no special reference to the Bundahi*s*.
They treat of the following matters:—

The coming of the religion, beginning in the time of Frâsîyâ*v* and
Mânû*sk*îhar, with an anecdote of Kâî-ûs and the hero Srîtô (Av.
Thrita). The manifestation of the glory of Zaratû*s*t <span
id="page_187">p. 187</span> before his birth. The begetting of
Zaratû*s*t through the drinking of hôm-juice and cow's milk infused,
respectively, with his guardian spirit and glory, as declared in the
manuscript on 'the guidance of worship.' The connection of Zaratû*s*t
with Aûharmazd, traced back through his genealogy as far as Gâyômar*d*.
The persistent endeavours of the fiends to destroy Zaratû*s*t at the
time of his birth, and how they were frustrated. His receiving the
religion from Aûharmazd, with another anecdote of Kâî-ûs and Srîtô, and
of Zaratû*s*t's exclamation on coming into the world. The enmity borne
to him by five brothers of the Karapân family, and how it was
frustrated; his own four brothers, and some of his wonderful deeds. The
worthiness of his righteousness; his compassionate and liberal nature;
his giving up worldly desires; his pity; his good selection of a wife;
and what is most edifying for the soul. What occurred when he was thirty
years old, and his being conducted by the archangel Vohûman to the
assembly of the spirits. The questions asked by Zaratû*s*t, and
Aûharmazd's replies thereto. The seven questions he asked of the seven
archangels in seven different places, in the course of one winter.
\[Westergaard's MS. K35 ends in the middle of the second of these
questions.\] The five dispositions of priests, and the ten admonitions.
The three preservatives of religion, with particulars about the Gâthas
and the connection of the Ahunavar with the Nasks. Zaratû*s*t's
obtaining one disciple, Mê*d*yôk-mâh, in the first ten years, and the
acceptance of the religion by Vi*s*tâsp two years afterwards.

The second of the writings of Zâ*d*-sparam consists of his 'sayings
about the formation of men out of body, life, and soul;' and the third
(which is imperfect in all known MSS.) contains his 'sayings about
producing the renovation *of the universe*.'
