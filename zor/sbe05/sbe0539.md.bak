### CHAPTER XXX <span id="fr_681"></span>[6](#fn_676.md).

1\. On the nature of the resurrection and future existence it says in
revelation, that, whereas Mâshya and Mâshyôî, who grew up from the
earth <span id="fr_682"></span>[7](#fn_677.md), first fed upon water, then
plants, then milk, *and* then meat, men also, when their time of death
*has* come, first desist from eating meat, then milk, then from

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

bread, till when <span id="fr_683"></span>[1](#fn_678.md) they shall die
they always feed upon water. 2. So, likewise, in the millennium of
Hûshê*d*ar-mâh <span id="fr_684"></span>[2](#fn_679.md), the strength of
appetite (âz) will thus diminish, when men *will* remain three days and
nights in superabundance (sîrîh) through one taste of consecrated food.
3. Then they will desist from meat food, *and* eat vegetables *and*
milk; afterwards, they abstain from milk food *and* abstain from
vegetable food, *and* are feeding on water; *and* for ten years before
Sôshyans <span id="fr_685"></span>[3](#fn_680.md) comes they remain without
food, *and* do not die.

4\. After Sôshyans *comes* they prepare the raising of the dead, as it
says, that Zaratû*s*t asked of Aûharmazd thus: 'Whence does a body form
again, which the wind *has* carried *and* the water conveyed
(va*z*î*d*) <span id="fr_686"></span>[4](#fn_681.md)? *and* how does the
resurrection occur?' 5. Aûharmazd answered thus: 'When through me the
sky *arose* from the substance of the ruby <span
id="fr_687"></span>[5](#fn_682.md), without columns, on the spiritual
support of far-compassed light; when through me the earth arose,
which <span id="fr_688"></span>[6](#fn_683.md) bore the material life,
*and* there is no

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

maintainer of the worldly creation but it; when by me the sun *and* moon
and stars are conducted in the firmament (andarvaî) of luminous bodies;
when by me corn was created so that, scattered about in the earth, it
grew again *and* returned with increase; when by me colour <span
id="fr_689"></span>[1](#fn_684.md) of various kinds was created in plants;
when by me fire was created in plants *and* other things <span
id="fr_690"></span>[2](#fn_685.md) without combustion; when *by me* a son
was created *and* fashioned <span id="fr_691"></span>[3](#fn_686.md) in the
womb of a mother, *and* the structure (pî*s*ak) severally of the skin,
nails, blood, feet, eyes, ears, and other things was produced; when by
me legs were created for the water, so that it flows away, *and* the
cloud was created which carries the water of the world *and* rains there
where it has a purpose; when by me the air was created which conveys *in
one's* eyesight, through the strength of the wind, the lowermost upwards
according to *its* will, *and one* is not able to grasp it with the hand
out-stretched; each one of them, when created by me, was herein more
difficult than causing the resurrection, for <span
id="fr_692"></span>[4](#fn_687.md) *it is* an assistance to me in the
resurrection that they exist, *but* when they were formed it was not
*forming* the future out of the past <span
id="fr_693"></span>[5](#fn_688.md). 6. Observe that when that which was not
was then produced, why is it not possible to

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

produce again that which was? for at that time *one will* demand the
bone from the spirit of earth, the blood from the water, the hair from
the plants, *and* the life from fire, since *they* were delivered to
them in the original creation.'

7\. First, the bones of Gâyômar*d* are roused up then those of Mâshya
*and* Mâshyôî, then those of the rest of mankind; in the fifty-seven
years *of* Sôshyans <span id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_689.md) they prepare
all the dead, *and* all men stand up; whoever is righteous *and* whoever
is wicked, every human creature, they rouse up from the spot where its
life departs. 8. Afterwards, when all material living beings assume
again their bodies *and* forms, then they assign (barâ yehabûnd) them a
single class <span id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_690.md). 9. Of the light
accompanying (levatman) the sun, one half will *be* for Gâyômar*d*, and
one half will give enlightenment among the rest of men, so that the soul
*and* body will know that this is my father, and this is my mother, and
this is my brother, and this is my wife, and these are some other of my
nearest relations.

10\. Then is the assembly of the, Sa*d*vâstarân <span
id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_691.md) where all mankind will stand at this
time; in that assembly every one sees his own good deeds and his own
evil deeds; *and* then, in that assembly, a wicked *man* becomes as
conspicuous as a white sheep among those which are black. 11. In that

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

assembly whatever righteous *man* was friend of a wicked *one* in the
world, *and* the wicked *man* complains of him who is righteous, thus:
'Why did he not make me acquainted, when in the world, with the good
deeds which he practised himself?' if he who is righteous did not inform
him, then it is necessary for him to suffer shame accordingly in that
assembly <span id="fr_697"></span>[1](#fn_692.md).

12\. Afterwards they set the righteous *man* apart from the wicked;
*and* then the righteous is for heaven (garô*d*mân), and they cast the
wicked back to hell. 13. Three days *and* nights they inflict punishment
bodily in hell, *and* then he beholds bodily those three days' happiness
in heaven <span id="fr_698"></span>[2](#fn_693.md). 14. As it says that, on
the day when the righteous *man* is parted from the wicked, the tears of
every one, thereupon, run down unto *his* legs. 15. When, after they set
apart a father from his consort (hambâ*z*), a brother from his brother,
and a friend from

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

his friend, they suffer, every one for his own deeds, *and* weep, the
righteous for the wicked, and the wicked about himself; for there may be
a father who is righteous *and* a son wicked, *and* there may be one
brother who is righteous *and* one wicked. 16. Those for whose peculiar
deeds it is appointed, such as Dahâk and Frâsîyâ*v* of Tûr, *and* others
of this sort, as those deserving death (marg-ar*g*ânân), undergo a
punishment no other men undergo; they call *it* 'the punishment of the
three nights <span id="fr_699"></span>[1](#fn_694.md).'

17\. Among his producers of the renovation *of the universe*, those
righteous men of whom it is written <span
id="fr_700"></span>[2](#fn_695.md) that they are living, fifteen men and
fifteen damsels, will come to the assistance of Sôshyans. 18. As
Gô*k*îhar <span id="fr_701"></span>[3](#fn_696.md) falls in the *celestial*
sphere from a moonbeam on to the earth, the distress of the earth
becomes such-like as *that of* a sheep when a wolf falls *upon it*. 19.
Afterwards, the fire and halo <span id="fr_702"></span>[4](#fn_697.md) melt
the metal of Shatvaîrô, in the hills *and* mountains, *and* it remains
on this earth like a river.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

20\. Then all men will pass into that melted metal and will become pure;
when *one* is righteous, then it seems to him just as though he walks
continually in warm milk; *but* when wicked, then it seems to him in
such manner as though, in the world, he walks continually in melted
metal.

21\. Afterwards, with the greatest affection, all men come together,
father and son and brother and friend ask one another thus: 'Where has
it <span id="fr_703"></span>[1](#fn_698.md) been these many years, and what
was the judgment upon thy soul? hast thou been righteous or wicked?' 22.
The first soul the body sees, it enquires of it with those words (gûft).
23. All men become of one voice *and* administer loud praise to
Aûharmazd and the archangels.

24\. Aûharmazd completes *his work* at that time, *and* the creatures
become so that it is not necessary to make any effort about them; *and*
among those by whom the dead are prepared, it is not necessary *that*
any effort be made. 25. Sôshyans, with his assistants, performs a
Ya*z*i*s*n *ceremony* in preparing the dead, *and* they slaughter the ox
Hadhayôs <span id="fr_704"></span>[2](#fn_699.md) in that Ya*z*i*s*n; from
the fat of that ox and the white Hôm <span
id="fr_705"></span>[3](#fn_700.md) they prepare Hûsh, *and* give *it* to
all men, and all men become immortal for ever *and* everlasting. 26.
This, too, it says, that whoever has been the size of a man, they
restore him then with an age of forty years; they who have been little
when not dead, they restore then with an age of fifteen years; and they
give every one *his* wife, and

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

show *him his* children with the wife; so they act as now in the world,
but there is no begetting of children.

27\. Afterwards, Sôshyans *and his assistants*, by order of the creator
Aûharmazd, give every man the reward and recompense suitable to *his*
deeds; this is even the righteous existence (aît) where it is said that
they convey *him* to paradise (vahi*s*t), and the heaven (garô*d*mân) of
Aûharmazd takes up the body (kerp) as itself requires; with that
assistance he continually advances for ever *and* everlasting. 28. This,
too, it says, that whoever has performed no worship (ya*s*t), and has
ordered no Gêtî-kharî*d* <span id="fr_706"></span>[1](#fn_701.md), and has
bestowed no clothes as a righteous gift, is naked there; and he performs
the worship (ya*s*t) of Aûharmazd, and the heavenly angels <span
id="fr_707"></span>[2](#fn_702.md) provide him the use of his clothing.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

29\. Afterwards, Aûharmazd seizes on <span
id="fr_708"></span>[1](#fn_703.md) the evil spirit, Vohûman *on*
Akôman <span id="fr_709"></span>[2](#fn_704.md), Ashavahi*s*t *on*
Andar <span id="fr_710"></span>[3](#fn_705.md), Shatvaîrô *on* Sâvar,
Spendarma*d* *on* Tarômat who is Nâûnghas <span
id="fr_711"></span>[4](#fn_706.md), Horvada*d* *and* Amerôda*d* *on*
Tâîrê*v* *and* Zâîrî*k* <span id="fr_712"></span>[5](#fn_707.md),
true-speaking *on* what is evil-speaking, Srôsh <span
id="fr_713"></span>[6](#fn_708.md) *on* Aeshm <span
id="fr_714"></span>[7](#fn_709.md) 30. Then two fiends remain at large,
Aharman <span id="fr_715"></span>[8](#fn_710.md) and Â*z* <span
id="fr_716"></span>[9](#fn_711.md); Aûharmazd comes to the world, himself
the Zôta and Srôsh the Râspî <span id="fr_717"></span>[10](#fn_712.md), and
holds the Kûstî in *his* hand;

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

defeated by the Kûstî <span id="fr_718"></span>[1](#fn_713.md) formula the
resources of the evil spirit and Â*z* act most impotently, *and* by the
passage through which he rushed into the sky <span
id="fr_719"></span>[2](#fn_714.md) he runs back to gloom *and* darkness.
31. Gô*k*îhar <span id="fr_720"></span>[3](#fn_715.md) burns the serpent
(mâr) <span id="fr_721"></span>[4](#fn_716.md) in the melted metal, *and*
the stench and pollution *which* were in hell are burned in that metal,
*and* it (hell) becomes quite pure. 32. He (Aûharmazd) sets the
vault <span id="fr_722"></span>[5](#fn_717.md) into which the evil spirit
fled, in that metal; he brings the land of hell back for the enlargement
of the world <span id="fr_723"></span>[6](#fn_718.md); the renovation
arises in the universe by *his* will, *and* the world is immortal for
ever *and* everlasting.

33\. This, too, it says, that this earth *becomes* an iceless <span
id="fr_724"></span>[7](#fn_719.md), slopeless plain <span
id="fr_725"></span>[8](#fn_720.md); even the mountain <span
id="fr_726"></span>[9](#fn_721.md),

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

whose summit is the support of the *K*învar *bridge*, they keep down,
*and* it *will* not exist.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_676"></span>[120:6](sbe0539.htm#fr_681.md) This chapter is
found in all MSS., and has been numbered XXXI by former translators.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[120:7](sbe0539.htm#fr_682.md) See Chaps. XV,
2-16, XXXIV, 3.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[121:1](sbe0539.htm#fr_683.md) Reading amat,
'when,' instead of mûn, 'which' (see the note on Chap. 1, 7).

<span id="fn_679"></span>[121:2](sbe0539.htm#fr_684.md) Written
Khûrshê*d*ar-mâh, or Khûrshê*d*-mâh, in the Bundahi*s*; see Chap. XXXII,
8, and Bahman Yt. III, 52, 53.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[121:3](sbe0539.htm#fr_685.md) See Chaps. XI, 6, X
XXII, 8, Bahman Yt. III, 62.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[121:4](sbe0539.htm#fr_686.md) Compare (Vend. V,
26) 'the water carries *him* up, the water carries *him* down, the water
casts *him* away.'

<span id="fn_682"></span>[121:5](sbe0539.htm#fr_687.md) Compare Mkh. IX, 7.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[121:6](sbe0539.htm#fr_688.md) All MSS. have min,
'out of,' but translators generally suppose it should be mûn, 'which,'
as the meaning of 'brought out of material life' is by no means clear.
Perhaps the two phrases might be construed together, thus: 'there is no
*other* maintainer of the worldly creation, brought from the material
life, than it.' Windischmann refers to Fravardîn Yt. 9.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[122:1](sbe0539.htm#fr_689.md) Former translators
all read rag, 'vein, pore;' but it probably stands for rang, 'colour,
dye,' as in Chap. XXVII, 5, 18.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[122:2](sbe0539.htm#fr_690.md) See Chap. XVII, 1,
2.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[122:3](sbe0539.htm#fr_691.md) Pâz. srahtîd is
evidently a misreading of Pahl. srî*s*tî*d*, 'formed, shaped.'
Windischmann compares Fravardîn Yt. 11, 22, 28.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[122:4](sbe0539.htm#fr_692.md) Here *k*îm is the
Pâzand of Huz. mamanam, 'for to me;' being a different word from the
interrogative *k*îm, 'why?' of the next §.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[122:5](sbe0539.htm#fr_693.md) Literally, '*what*
becomes out of *what* was.'

<span id="fn_689"></span>[123:1](sbe0539.htm#fr_694.md) K20 omits
'Sôshyans.'

<span id="fn_690"></span>[123:2](sbe0539.htm#fr_695.md) The phrase is
obscure, and K20 omits the numeral 'one' (the idhâfat of unity); but the
meaning is probably that all former distinctions of class, or caste, are
abolished.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[123:3](sbe0539.htm#fr_696.md) Windischmann
suggests that it may be 'the assembly of Isa*d*vâstar,' the eldest son
of Zaratû*s*t (see Chap. XXXII, 5); perhaps supposed to be presided over
by him as the first supreme high-priest after Zaratû*s*t's death.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[124:1](sbe0539.htm#fr_697.md) In the
Ar*d*â-Vîrâf-namak (Chap. LXVIII) it is related that Ar*d*â-Vîrâf saw
the souls of a husband and wife, that of the husband destined for
heaven, and that of the wife for hell; but the wife clung to her husband
and asked why they should be separated, and he told her it was on
account of her neglect of religious duties; whereupon she reproached him
for not teaching and chastising her. 'And, afterwards, the man went to
heaven and the woman to hell. And owing to the repentance of that woman
she was in no other affliction in hell but darkness and stench. And that
man sat in the midst of the righteous of heaven in shame, from not
converting and not teaching the woman, who might have become virtuous in
his keeping.'

<span id="fn_693"></span>[124:2](sbe0539.htm#fr_698.md) As an aggravation
of his punishment in hell. It has generally been supposed that this last
phrase refers to the reward of the righteous man, but this cannot be the
case unless akhar be taken in the sense of 'other,' which is unlikely;
besides, beholding the happiness of others would be no reward to an
Oriental mind.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[125:1](sbe0539.htm#fr_699.md) According to the
Pahlavi Vend. VII, 136 (p. 96, Sp.) it appears that a person who has
committed a marg-ar*g*ân or mortal sin, without performing patît or
renunciation of sin thereafter, remains in hell till the future
existence, when he is brought out, beheaded three times for each mortal
sin unrepented of, and then cast back into hell to undergo the
punishment tishrãm khshafnãm ('of the three nights') before he becomes
righteous; some say, however, that this punishment is not inflicted for
a single mortal sin. This period of three nights’ punishment is quite a
different matter from the three nights’ hovering of the soul about the
body after death.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[125:2](sbe0539.htm#fr_700.md) See Chap. XXIX, 5,
6. As the text stands in the MSS. it is uncertain whether the fifteen
men and fifteen damsels are a portion of these righteous immortals, or
an addition to them.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[125:3](sbe0539.htm#fr_701.md) Probably a meteor
(see Chap. V, 1).

<span id="fn_697"></span>[125:4](sbe0539.htm#fr_702.md) Reading khîrman; M6
has 'the fire and angel Aîrman (Av. Airyaman) melt the metal in the
hills,' &c.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[126:1](sbe0539.htm#fr_703.md) K20 has 'have I;'
probably hômanîh, 'hast thou,' was the original reading.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[126:2](sbe0539.htm#fr_704.md) See Chap. XIX, 13.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[126:3](sbe0539.htm#fr_705.md) See Chap. XXVII, 4.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[127:1](sbe0539.htm#fr_706.md) The Sad-dar
Bundahi*s* says that by Gêtî-kharî*d* 'heaven is purchased in the world,
and one's own place brought to hand in heaven.' The Rivâyat of Dastûr
Barzû (as quoted in MS. 29 of Bombay University Parsi Collection) gives
the following details in Persian: 'To celebrate Gêtî-kharî*d* it is
necessary that two hêrbads (priests) perform the Nâbar, and with each
khshnûman which they pray it is fit and necessary that both hêrbads have
had the Nâbar; and the first day they recite the Nônâbar ya*s*t, and
consecrate the Nônâbar drôn and the Nônâbar âfrîngân which they recite
in each Gâh; in the Hâvan Gâh it is necessary to recite fravarânê (as in
Yas. III, 24 W. to end), ahurahê mazd*a*u raêvatô (as in Aûharmazd Yt.
0, to) frasastayaê*k*a, then Yas. III, 25 W., XVII. 1-55 Sp., ashem vohû
thrice, âfrînâmi khshathryãn (as in Âfrîngân I, 14, to end). The second
day the Srôsh ya*s*t and Srôsh drôn and âfrîngân are to be recited; and
the third day it is necessary to recite the Sîrôzah ya*s*t, the Sîrôzah
drôn and âfrîngân dahmân; and it is needful to recite the second and
third âfrîngâns in each Gâh, and each day to consecrate the barsom and
drôn afresh with seven twigs, so that it may not be ineffective.'

<span id="fn_702"></span>[127:2](sbe0539.htm#fr_707.md) Pâz. gehân is
probably a misreading of Pahl. yazdân, as <span id="page_128">p.
128</span> neither 'the spirit of the world,' nor 'the spirit of the
Gâhs' is a likely phrase. It is possible, however, that maînôk gehân is
a misreading of min aîvyahân, 'from the girdle,' and we should translate
as follows: 'and out of its girdle (that is, the kûstî of the barsom
used in the ceremony) he produces the effect of his clothing.'

<span id="fn_703"></span>[128:1](sbe0539.htm#fr_708.md) Instead of
vakhdûnd, 'seize on,' we should probably read vânend, 'smite,' as in the
parallel passages mentioned below.

<span id="fn_704"></span>[128:2](sbe0539.htm#fr_709.md) Compare Zamyâd Yt.
96. Each archangel (see Chap. I, 25, 26) here seizes the arch-fiend (see
Chaps. I, 27, XXVIII, 7-12) who is his special opponent.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[128:3](sbe0539.htm#fr_710.md) Here written Pâz.
Inder. Compare Pahlavi Yas. XLVII, 1: 'When among the creation, in the
future existence, righteousness smites the fiend, Ashavahi*s*t *smites*
Indar.'

<span id="fn_706"></span>[128:4](sbe0539.htm#fr_711.md) Written Nâkahê*d*
in Chap. I, 27, and Nâîkîyas in Chap. XXVIII, 20, where he is described
as a distinct demon from Tarômat in XXVIII, 14.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[128:5](sbe0539.htm#fr_712.md) Here written
Târê*v* and Zârî*k*.

<span id="fn_708"></span>[128:6](sbe0539.htm#fr_713.md) Av. Sraosha, a
personification of attentive hearing and obedience, who is said to watch
over the world and defend it from the demons, especially at night; see
Vend. XVIII, 48, 51, 70, &c., Yas. LVI, Srôsh Yt. Hâdôkht, &c.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[128:7](sbe0539.htm#fr_714.md) See Chap. XXVIII,
15-17.

<span id="fn_710"></span>[128:8](sbe0539.htm#fr_715.md) Comparing § 29 with
§ 30 it is not very clear whether the author of the Bundahi*s*
considered Aharman and the evil spirit as the same or different demons;
compare also Chap. XXVIII, 1-6 with 40, 41.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[128:9](sbe0539.htm#fr_716.md) See Chap. XXVIII,
27.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[128:10](sbe0539.htm#fr_717.md) The Zôta is the
chief officiating priest in all ceremonies, and the Râspî is the
assistant priest.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[129:1](sbe0539.htm#fr_718.md) The words zak
g,hâni, for ân g*e*hâni, are probably a misreading of aîvyahân, 'the
kûstî or sacred thread-girdle,' which is tied round the waist in a
peculiar manner, during the recital of a particular formula, in which
Aûharmazd is blessed and Aharman and the demons are cursed.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[129:2](sbe0539.htm#fr_719.md) See Chap. III,
10-12.

<span id="fn_715"></span>[129:3](sbe0539.htm#fr_720.md) See § 18 and Chap.
V, 1.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[129:4](sbe0539.htm#fr_721.md) Probably referring
to Â*z*, which means both 'greediness' and 'serpent.' It is, however,
possible to read 'Gô*k*îhar the serpent burns in' &c., and there can be
no doubt that Gô*k*îhar is represented as a malevolent being.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[129:5](sbe0539.htm#fr_722.md) Or, perhaps,
'hiding-place.' Comparing K20 and M6 together the word seems to be alôm,
which may be compared with Heb. ‏אוּלָם‎ 'a vault,' or Chald. ‏אוּלָמָא‎
'a porch;' it may, however, be vâlôm, which may be traced to ‏עלם‎ 'to
conceal.' In the old MSS. it is certainly not shôlman, 'hell,' which is
an emendation due to the modern copy in Paris.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[129:6](sbe0539.htm#fr_723.md) Or, 'to the
prosperity of the world.'

<span id="fn_719"></span>[129:7](sbe0539.htm#fr_724.md) Former translators
read anhîkhar, 'undefiled,' but this does not suit the Pahlavi
orthography so well as anhasâr, 'iceless' (compare Pers. hasar, khâsar,
or khasâr, 'ice'); cold and ice, being produced by the evil spirit, will
disappear with him.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[129:8](sbe0539.htm#fr_725.md) Pâz. âmâvan is a
misreading of Pahl. hâmûn, so the reading is an*s*îp (compare Pers.
*s*îb) hâmûn. Mountains, being the work of the evil spirit, disappear
with him.

see Chap. XII, 17.
