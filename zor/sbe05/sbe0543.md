### CHAPTER XXXIV <span id="fr_882"></span>[1](#fn_876).

0\. On the reckoning of the years <span id="fr_883"></span>[2](#fn_877).

1\. Time was *for* twelve thousand years; *and* it says in revelation,
that three thousand years was the duration of the spiritual *state*,
where the creatures were unthinking, unmoving, *and* intangible <span
id="fr_884"></span>[3](#fn_878); *and* three thousand years <span
id="fr_885"></span>[4](#fn_879) was the duration of Gâyômar*d*, with the
ox, in the world. 2. As *this* was six thousand years series of
millennium reigns <span id="fr_886"></span>[5](#fn_880) of Cancer, Leo,
and Virgo had elapsed, because it was six thousand years when the
millennium reign came to Libra, the adversary rushed in, and Gâyômar*d*
lived thirty years in tribulation <span id="fr_887"></span>[6](#fn_881).
After the thirty years <span id="fr_888"></span>[7](#fn_882) Mâshya
*and* Mashyôî grew up; it was fifty years while they were not wife *and*
husband <span id="fr_889"></span>[8](#fn_883), *and* they were
ninety-three years together *as* wife *and* husband till the *time* when
Hôshyang <span id="fr_890"></span>[9](#fn_884) came.

4\. Hôshyang *was* forty years <span id="fr_891"></span>[10](#fn_885),
Takhmôrup <span id="fr_892"></span>[11](#fn_886) thirty years, Yim till
*his* glory <span id="fr_893"></span>[12](#fn_887) departed six hundred
and

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

sixteen years and six months, *and* after that he was a hundred years in
concealment. 5. Then the millennium <span
id="fr_894"></span>[1](#fn_888) reign came to Scorpio, and Dahâk <span
id="fr_895"></span>[2](#fn_889) ruled a thousand years. 6. After the
millennium reign came to Sagittarius, Frê*d*ûn <span
id="fr_896"></span>[3](#fn_890) *reigned* five hundred years; in the
same five hundred years of Frê*d*ûn *were* the twelve years of Aîrî*k*;
Mânû*sk*îhar <span id="fr_897"></span>[4](#fn_891) *was* a hundred and
twenty years, *and* in the same reign of Mânû*sk*îhar, when he was in
the mountain fastness (dûshkhvâr-gar) <span
id="fr_898"></span>[5](#fn_892), *were* the twelve years of Frâsîyâ*v*;
Zôb <span id="fr_899"></span>[6](#fn_893) the Tûhmâspian *was* five
years.

7\. Kaî-Kabâ*d* <span id="fr_900"></span>[7](#fn_894) *was* fifteen
years; Kaî-Kâûs, till he went to the sky, seventy-five years, *and*
seventy-five years after that, altogether a hundred and fifty years;
Kai-Khûsrôv sixty years; Kaî-Lôrâsp <span
id="fr_901"></span>[8](#fn_895) a hundred and twenty years;
Kaî-Vi*s*tâsp, till the coming of the religion, thirty years <span
id="fr_902"></span>[9](#fn_896), altogether a hundred and twenty years.

8\. Vohûman <span id="fr_903"></span>[10](#fn_897) *son* of Spend-dâ*d*
a hundred and

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

twelve years; Hûmâî, who *was* daughter of Vohûman, thirty years; Dârâî
son of Kîhar-i-â*z*â*d* <span id="fr_904"></span>[1](#fn_898), that is,
*of the daughter* of Vohûman, twelve years; Dârâî son of Dârâî fourteen
years; Alexander the Rûman <span id="fr_905"></span>[2](#fn_899)
fourteen years.

9\. The A*s*kânians bore the title in an uninterrupted (a-arûbâk)
sovereignty two hundred and eighty-four years <span
id="fr_906"></span>[3](#fn_900), Ardashîr son of Pâpak *and* the number
of the Sâsânians four hundred and sixty years <span
id="fr_907"></span>[4](#fn_901), and then it went to the Arabs.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_876"></span>[149:1](sbe0543.htm#fr_882) This chapter is
found in all the MSS.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[149:2](sbe0543.htm#fr_883) TD adds 'of the
Arabs (Tâ*z*îkân).'

<span id="fn_878"></span>[149:3](sbe0543.htm#fr_884) See Chap. I, 8.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[149:4](sbe0543.htm#fr_885) See Chaps. I, 22,
III, 1.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[149:5](sbe0543.htm#fr_886) This system of a
millennium reign for each constellation of the zodiac can hardly have
any connection with the precession of the equinoxes, as the equinoxes
travel backwards through the zodiac, whereas these millennium reigns
travel forwards.

<span id="fn_881"></span>[149:6](sbe0543.htm#fr_887) See Chap. III,
21-23.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[149:7](sbe0543.htm#fr_888) That is, forty
years after the thirty (see Chap. XV, 2).

<span id="fn_883"></span>[149:8](sbe0543.htm#fr_889) See Chap. XV, 19,
20.

<span id="fn_884"></span>[149:9](sbe0543.htm#fr_890) See Chaps. XV, 28.
XXXI, 1.

<span id="fn_885"></span>[149:10](sbe0543.htm#fr_891) K20 omits, by
mistake, from 'together' in § 3 to this point.

<span id="fn_886"></span>[149:11](sbe0543.htm#fr_892) See Chap. XXXI, 2.

<span id="fn_887"></span>[149:12](sbe0543.htm#fr_893) So in K20, but M6
has nismô, 'soul, reason,' as in Chap. XXIII, 1; the word 'glory' would
refer to the supposed divine glory of the Iranian monarchs (see Chap.
XXXI. 32).

<span id="fn_888"></span>[150:1](sbe0543.htm#fr_894) The seventh
millennium, ruled by Libra, is computed by Windischmann as follows: 30 +
40½ + 50 + 93 + 40 + 30 + 616½ + 100 = 1000. The eighth millennium,
ruled by Scorpio, is the thousand years of Dahâk.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[150:2](sbe0543.htm#fr_895) See Chap. XXXI, 6.

<span id="fn_890"></span>[150:3](sbe0543.htm#fr_896) See Chap. XXXI,
7-11.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[150:4](sbe0543.htm#fr_897) See Chap. XXXI,
12-14.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[150:5](sbe0543.htm#fr_898) See Chap. XXXI, 21.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[150:6](sbe0543.htm#fr_899) Written Aûzôbô in
Chap. XXXI, 23, 24.

<span id="fn_894"></span>[150:7](sbe0543.htm#fr_900) Usually written
Kai-Kavâ*d* in Pahlavi (see Chap. XXXI, 24,25).

<span id="fn_895"></span>[150:8](sbe0543.htm#fr_901) Also written
Kaî-Lôharâsp (see Chap. XXXI, 28, 29).

<span id="fn_896"></span>[150:9](sbe0543.htm#fr_902) This is the end of
the ninth millennium, ruled by Sagittarius, which is computed by
Windischmann as follows, 500 + 120 + 5 + 15+ 150 +60+ 120+ 30 = 1000.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[150:10](sbe0543.htm#fr_903) See Chap. XXXI,
29, 30, where he is said to have been also called Artakhshatar, which
seems to identify him with Artaxerxes Longimanus and his successors down
to Artaxerxes Mnemon; so that Hûmâî may perhaps be identified with
Parysatis, and Dârâî *K*ihar-â*z*âdân with Artaxerxes Ochus, as Dârâî
Dârâyân must be <span id="page_151">p. 151</span> Darius Codomannus,
while the reign of Kai-Vi*s*tâsp seems intended to cover the period from
Cyrus to Xerxes.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[151:1](sbe0543.htm#fr_904) A surname of Hûmâî.

<span id="fn_899"></span>[151:2](sbe0543.htm#fr_905) Sikandar-i Arûmâk,
that is, Alexander the Roman (of the eastern or Greek empire), as
Pahlavi writers assume.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[151:3](sbe0543.htm#fr_906) This period is
nearly two centuries too short.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[151:4](sbe0543.htm#fr_907) The actual period
of Sasanian rule was 425 years (A.D. 226-651). According to the figures
given in the text, the tenth millennium, ruled by Capricornus, must have
terminated in the fourth year of the last king, Yazdakar*d*. This agrees
substantially with the Bahman Ya*s*t, which makes the millennium of
Zaratû*s*t expire some time after the reign of Khûsrô Nôshirvân;
probably in the time of Khûsrô Parvîz, or some forty years earlier than
the fourth year of Yazdakar*d*. According to the text we must now be
near the end of the first quarter of the twelfth and last millennium.
