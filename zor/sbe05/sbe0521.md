### CHAPTER XII.

1\. On the nature of mountains it says in revelation, that, at first,
the mountains have grown forth in eighteen years; and Albûr*z* ever
grew, till the completion of eight hundred years; two hundred years *up*
to the star station (pâyak), two hundred years to the moon station, two
hundred years to the sun station, and two hundred years to the endless
light <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_159). 2. While the other
mountains have grown out of Albûr*z*, in number 2244 mountains, *and*
are Hûgar the lofty <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_160), Têrak of
Albûr*z*, *K*akâ*d*-i-Dâîtîk, and the Are*z*ûr ridge, the Aûsîndôm
mountain, Mount Apârsên which they say is the mountain of Pârs, Mount
Zari*d* also which is Mount Mânû*s*, Mount Aîra*k*, Mount Kaf, Mount
Vâ*d*gês, Mount Aûshdâ*s*târ, Mount Are*z*ûr-bûm, Mount Rôyi*s*n-hômand,
Mount Padashkhvârgar which is the greatest in Khvârîh, the mountain
which they call *K*înŏ, Mount Rêvand, Mount Dârspêt the Bakyir mountain,
Mount Kabed-*s*ikaft, Mount Sîyâk-mûî-mand, Mount Vafar-hômand, Mount
Spendyâ*d* *and* Kôndrâsp, Mount Asnavand *and* Kôndras, Mount

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Si*k*idâv <span
id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161), a mountain among which are in
Kangde*z* <span id="fr_162"></span>[2](#fn_162), *of* which they say
that they are a comfort and delight of the good creator, the smaller
hills.

3\. I *will* mention them also a second time; Albûr*z* <span
id="fr_163"></span>[3](#fn_163) is around this earth and is connected
with the sky. 4. The Têrak <span id="fr_164"></span>[4](#fn_164) of
Albûr*z* is that through which the stars, moon, *and* sun pass <span
id="fr_165"></span>[5](#fn_165) in, and through it they come back. 5.
Hûgar the lofty <span id="fr_166"></span>[6](#fn_166) is that from which
the water of Arêdvîvsûr <span id="fr_167"></span>[7](#fn_167) leaps down
the height of a thousand men. 6. The Aûsîndôm <span
id="fr_168"></span>[8](#fn_168) mountain is that which, being of ruby

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (khûn-âhinŏ), of
the substance of the sky <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169), is *in*
the midst of the wide-formed ocean, so that its water, which is from
Hûgar, pours down into it (the ocean). 7. *K*akâ*d*-i-Dâîtîk ('the
judicial peak') is that of the middle of the world, the height of a
hundred men, on which the *K*învar bridge <span
id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_170) stands; and they take account of the
soul at that place. 8. The Are*z*ûr <span
id="fr_171"></span>[3](#fn_171) ridge \[of the Albûr*z* mountain\] is a
summit at the gate of hell, where they always hold the concourse of the
demons. 9. This also is said, that, excepting Albûr*z*, the
Apârsên <span id="fr_172"></span>[4](#fn_172) mountain is the

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

greatest; the Apârsên mountain they call the mountain of Pars, and its
beginning is in Sagastân <span id="fr_173"></span>[1](#fn_173) and its
end in Khû*g*îstân. 10. Mount Mânû*s* <span
id="fr_174"></span>[2](#fn_174) is great; the mountain on which
Mânû*sk*îhar was born.

11\. The remaining mountains have chiefly grown from those; as it is
said that the elevation (afsârîh) of the districts had arisen most
around those three mountains <span id="fr_175"></span>[3](#fn_175). 12.
Mount Aîra*k* <span id="fr_176"></span>[4](#fn_176) is in the middle
from Hama*d*ân to Khvâri*z*em, and has grown from Mount Apârsên. 13.
Mount \[*K*înŏ\] <span id="fr_177"></span>[5](#fn_177), which is on its
east, on the frontier of Tûrkistân, is connected also with Apârsên. 14.
Mount Kaf <span id="fr_178"></span>[6](#fn_178) has grown from the same
Mount Apârsên. 15. Mount

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aûshdâ*s*târ <span
id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_179) is in Sagastân. 16. Mount Are*z*ûr <span
id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_180) is that which is in the direction of
Arûm. 17. The Padashkhvârgar <span id="fr_181"></span>[3](#fn_181)
mountain is that which is in Taparîstân and the side of Gîlân. 18. The
Rêvand <span id="fr_182"></span>[4](#fn_182) mountain is in
Khûrâsân <span id="fr_183"></span>[5](#fn_183), on which the Bûr*z*în
fire <span id="fr_184"></span>[6](#fn_184) was established; and its
*name* Rêvand *means* this, that *it* is glorious. 19. The
Vâ*d*gês <span id="fr_185"></span>[7](#fn_185) mountain is that which is
on the frontier of the Vâ*d*gêsians; that quarter is full of timber
*and* full of trees. 20. The Bakyîr <span
id="fr_186"></span>[8](#fn_186) mountain is that which Frâsiyâ*v* of Tûr
used as a stronghold, and he made his residence within *it*; and *in*
the days of Yim <span id="fr_187"></span>[9](#fn_187) a myriad towns and
cities were erected on its pleasant *and* prosperous territory. 21.
Mount Kabed-*s*ikaft <span id="fr_188"></span>[10](#fn_188) ('very
rugged')

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

is that in Pârs, out of the same Mount Apârsên. 22. Mount Sîyâk-hômand
('being black') *and* Mount Vafar-hômand ('having snow') <span
id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_189), as far as their Kâvûl borders, have
grown out of it (Apârsên) towards the direction of *K*înŏ. 23. The
Spendyâ*d* <span id="fr_190"></span>[2](#fn_190) mountain is in the
circuit (var) of Rêvand <span id="fr_191"></span>[3](#fn_191). 24. The
Kôndrâsp <span id="fr_192"></span>[4](#fn_192) mountain, on the summit
of which is Lake Sôvbar <span id="fr_193"></span>[5](#fn_193), is in the
district (or by the town) of Tûs. 25. The Kondrâs <span
id="fr_194"></span>[6](#fn_194) mountain is in Aîrân-vê*g* <span
id="fr_195"></span>[6](#fn_194). The Asnavand <span
id="fr_196"></span>[7](#fn_195) mountain is in Âtarô-pâtakân. 27. The
Rôyi*s*n-hômand <span id="fr_197"></span>[8](#fn_196) ('having growth')
mountain is that on which vegetation has grown.

28\. Whatever <span id="fr_198"></span>[9](#fn_197) mountains are those
which are in every place of the various districts *and* various

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

countries, and cause the tillage *and* prosperity therein, are many *in*
name and many *in* number, *and* have grown from these same mountains.
29. *As* Mount Ganâva*d*, Mount Asparô*g*, Mount Pâhargar, Mount
Dimâvand, Mount Râvak, Mount Zarîn, Mount Gêsbakht, Mount Dâva*d*, Mount
Mî*g*în, *and* Mount Marak <span id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_198), which
have all grown from Mount Apârsên, of which the other mountains are
enumerated. 30. For the Dâva*d* <span id="fr_200"></span>[2](#fn_199)
mountain has grown into Khû*g*îstân likewise from the Apârsên mountain.
31. The Dimâvand <span id="fr_201"></span>[3](#fn_200) mountain is that
in which Bêvarâsp is bound. 32. From the same Padashkhvârgar mountain
unto Mount Kûmî*s* <span id="fr_202"></span>[4](#fn_201), *which* they
call Mount Madôfryâ*d* ('Come-to-help')—that in which Vi*s*tâsp routed
Ar*g*âsp—is Mount Mîyân-i-da*s*t ('mid-plain') <span
id="fr_203"></span>[5](#fn_202), *and* was broken off from that mountain
there. 33. They say, in the war of the religion, when there was
confusion among the Iranians it broke off from that mountain, *and* slid
down *into* the middle of the plain; the Iranians were saved by

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

it, and it was called, 'Come-to-help' by them. 34. The Ganâva*d* <span
id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_203) mountain is likewise there, on the Ridge
of Vi*s*tâsp (pû*s*t-i Vi*s*tâspân) <span
id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_204) at the abode of the Bûr*z*în-Mitrô fire,
nine leagues (parasang) to the west. 35. Râvak Bî*s*an <span
id="fr_206"></span>[3](#fn_205) is in Zrâvaka*d*; this place, some say,
is Zrava*d*, some call *it* Bî*s*an, some Kalâk; from this the road of
two sides of the mountain is down the middle of a fortress; for this
reason, that is, because it is there formed, they call Kalâk a fortress
this place they also call within the land of Sarak. 36. Mount
Asparô*g* <span id="fr_207"></span>[4](#fn_206) is established from the
country of Lake *K*ê*k*ast <span id="fr_208"></span>[5](#fn_207) unto
Pârs. 37. Pâhargar ('the Pâhar range') is in Khûrâsân. 38. Mount
Marak <span id="fr_209"></span>[6](#fn_208) is in Lârân. 39. Mount Zarîn
is in Tûrkîstân. 40. Mount Bakht-tan <span
id="fr_210"></span>[7](#fn_209) is in Spâhân.

41\. The rest, *apart* from this enumeration, which they reckon *as*
fostering hills of the country in the religion of the Mazdayasnians, are
the small hills, those which have grown piecemeal in places.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_159"></span>[34:1](sbe0521.htm#fr_159) These are the four
grades of the Mazdayasnian heaven.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[34:2](sbe0521.htm#fr_160) In all the
geographical details, mentioned in the Bundahi*s*, there is a strange
mixture of mythical tradition with actual fact. The author of the work
finds names mentioned in the Avesta, by old writers of another country,
and endeavours to identify them with places known to himself; much in
the same way as attempts have been made to identify the geographical
details of the garden of Eden. Most of the names of these mountains
occur in the Zamyâd Ya*s*t, or in other parts of the Avesta, as will be
noticed in detail further on. The number 2244 is also mentioned in § 7
of that Ya*s*t. A very able commentary on this chapter will be found in
Windischmann's Zoroastriche Studien, pp. 1-19.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[35:1](sbe0521.htm#fr_161) The Av. Si*k*idava
of Zamyâd Yt. 5.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[35:2](sbe0521.htm#fr_162) See Chap. XXIX, 4,
10; the name is here written Kande*z* in R20. In M6 the word is kôf,
'mountain,' which is almost identical in form; if this be the correct
reading, the translation will be, 'a mountain among those in the
mountain which they say is agreeable and the delight,' &c. This mountain
is, however, probably intended for the Av. A*n*tare-kangha, 'within
Kangha,' of Zamyâd Yt. 4.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[35:3](sbe0521.htm#fr_163) The Haraiti-bare*s*
of Zamyâd Yt. 1; but it is more usually called Hara berezaiti (see Chap.
V, 3).

<span id="fn_164"></span>[35:4](sbe0521.htm#fr_164) A central peak of
the mythic Albûr*z*, around which the heavenly bodies are said to
revolve (see Chap. V, 3). It is the Av. Taêra, mentioned in Yas. XLI,
24, Râm Yt. 7, Zamyâd Vt. 6.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[35:5](sbe0521.htm#fr_165) So in M6, but K20
has 'go in.'

<span id="fn_166"></span>[35:6](sbe0521.htm#fr_166) This appears to be
another peak of the mythic Albûr*z*, probably in the west, as it is
connected with Satavês, the western chieftain of the constellations (see
Chaps. XXIV, 17 and II, 7), It is the Av. Hukairya berezô, of Yas. LXIV,
14, Âbân Yt. 3, 25, 96, Gô*s* Yt. 8 Mihir Yt. 88, Rashnu Yt. 24,
Fravardîn Yt. 6, Râm Yt. 15.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[35:7](sbe0521.htm#fr_167) See Chap. XIII, 3-5.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[35:8](sbe0521.htm#fr_168) In Aûharmazd Yt. 31
and Zamyâd Yt. 2, 66, an Ushidhâo mountain is mentioned as having many
mountain waters around it, but this seems to be a near neighbour of the
Ushidarena mountain (see § 15). The details in the text correspond with
the description of the Hindva mountain, given in Tî*s*tar Yt. 32, thus:
us Hindva*d* paiti garôi*d* yô hi*s*taiti maidhîm zrayanghô
vouru-kashahê, 'up on the Hindva mountain, which stands amid the
wide-shored <span id="page_36">p. 36</span> ocean;' and the Pahlavi
name, Aûsîndôm, has probably arisen from the us Hindva*d* of this
passage, as suggested by Justi. (See Chaps. XIII, 5, and XVIII, 10, 11.)

<span id="fn_169"></span>[36:1](sbe0521.htm#fr_169) The sky is
considered to be a true firmament, or hard and indestructible dome.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[36:2](sbe0521.htm#fr_170) The *K*invatô-peretu
of the Avesta, mentioned even in the Gâthas. In the Pahlavi Vend. XIX,
101, it is stated that 'they pass across by the *K*inva*d* bridge, whose
two extremities are their own heavenly angels, one stands at
*K*akâ*d*-i-Dâîtîk, and one at Albûr*z*;' the former mountain seems not
to be mentioned in the Avesta, but the bridge is the path of the soul to
the other world if righteous the soul passes by it easily over Albûr*z*
(the confines of this world) into paradise, but if wicked it drops off
the bridge into hell.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[36:3](sbe0521.htm#fr_171) See Vend III, 23,
XIX, 140. The words in brackets may perhaps be inserted by mistake, but
they occur in all MSS. examined, and there is nothing inconsistent with
tradition in supposing Are*z*ûr to be the extreme northern range of the
mythic Albûr*z* which surrounds the earth, being the place where demons
chiefly congregate.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[36:4](sbe0521.htm#fr_172) Justi adopts the
reading Harpârsên, which occurs in K20 four times out of eleven, but is
corrected thrice. Windischmann suggests that this mountain is the Av.
*s*kyata (or i*s*katâ) upairi-saêna of Yas. X, 29, and Zamyâd Yt. 3,
which the Pahlavi translator of the Yasna explains as 'the Pârsên crag.'
It seems to be a general name for the principal mountain ranges in the
south and east of Iran, as maybe seen on comparing this passage and
Chap. XXIV, 28, <span id="page_37">p. 37</span> with Chap. XX, 16, 17,
21, 22, where the Haro, Hêtûmand, Marv, and Balkh rivers are said to
spring from Mount Apârsên; but its application to the southern range is
perhaps due to the etymological attempt, in the text, to connect it with
Pârs. The Selections of Zâ*d*-sparam, VII, 7, have *K*înîstân for
Khû*g*îstân.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[37:1](sbe0521.htm#fr_173) This name can also
be read Sîstân.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[37:2](sbe0521.htm#fr_174) In § 2 it is also
called Zari*d*, but in Zamyâd Yt. 1 Zeredhô and Aredhô-manusha are
mentioned as neighbouring mountains. The word 'great' is omitted in M6.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[37:3](sbe0521.htm#fr_175) That is, around the
ranges of Albûr*z*, Apârsên, and Mânû*s*.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[37:4](sbe0521.htm#fr_176) Perhaps intended for
the Erezishô of Zamyâd Yt. 2. The description would apply to any of the
mountains near Nî*s*âpûr.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[37:5](sbe0521.htm#fr_177) This name is omitted
in the MSS., but is taken from § 2 as suggested by Justi. Perhaps it
maybe connected with 'the country of Sênî' (Chap. XV, 29), which is
explained as being *K*înîstân, probably the land of Samarkand, which
place was formerly called *K*în, according to a passage in some MSS. of
Tabari's Chronicle, quoted in Ouseley's Oriental Geography, p. 298.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[37:6](sbe0521.htm#fr_178) Not Kâf, nor is it
mentioned in the Pahlavi Vend. V, 57, as supposed by Justi; the kâf kôp
ârâya*d* of Spiegel's edition of the Pahlavi text being a misprint for
kâfakŏ pârâya*d*, 'it traverses a fissure' (see Haug's Essays. 2nd ed.
p. 326, note 2).

<span id="fn_179"></span>[38:1](sbe0521.htm#fr_179) The Av. Ushi-darena
of Yas. I, 41, II, 54, III, 65, IV, 45, XXII, 31, XXV, 22, Aûharmazd Yt.
31, Zamyâd Yt. 0, 2, 97.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[38:2](sbe0521.htm#fr_180) Called Are*z*ûr-bûm
in § 2, which name stands for the sixth and seventh mountains, Erezurô
and Bumyô, in Zamyâd Yt. 2. The land of Arûm was the eastern empire of
the Romans.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[38:3](sbe0521.htm#fr_181) Evidently the
mountain range south of the Caspian, now called Albûr*z*; but whether
this actual Albûr*z* is to be considered a part of the mythic Albûr*z*
is not very clear.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[38:4](sbe0521.htm#fr_182) The Av. Raêv*a*us,
'shining,' of Zamyâd Yt. 6. It is also called the Ridge of Vi*s*tâsp
(see § 34).

<span id="fn_183"></span>[38:5](sbe0521.htm#fr_183) Or, 'the east.'

<span id="fn_184"></span>[38:6](sbe0521.htm#fr_184) See Chap. XVII, 8.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[38:7](sbe0521.htm#fr_185) The Av. Vâiti-gaêsô,
the twelfth mountain in Zamyâd. Yt. 2; Bâdghês in Persian.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[38:8](sbe0521.htm#fr_186) In § 2 it is Bakyir,
which Justi thinks is another name for Mount Dârspêt ('white poplar');
the latter name not being repeated here makes this supposition probable.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[38:9](sbe0521.htm#fr_187) K20 has rûm and M6
has lanman, but both explained by the Pâz. gloss Yim, which is also the
reading of the Pâz. MSS. If the gloss be rejected the most probable
translation would be, 'and in our days Shatrô-râm (or râmi*s*n), the
victorious, erected on it a myriad towns and cities.'

<span id="fn_188"></span>[38:10](sbe0521.htm#fr_188) Windischmann
suggests that this may he intended for the Av. *s*kyata or i*s*katâ
mentioned in the note on Apârsên in § 9.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[39:1](sbe0521.htm#fr_189) The Av. Syâmaka and
Vafray*a*u of Zamyâd Yt. 5; and probably the Siyâh-kôh and Safêd-kôh of
Afghânistân. With regard to *K*înŏ, see the note on § 13. The former
mountain is called Sîyâk-mûî-mand, 'having black hair,' in § 2, which is
certainly a more grammatical form than Sîyâk-hômand.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[39:2](sbe0521.htm#fr_190) The Av.
Spe*n*tô-dâta of Zamyâd Yt. 6.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[39:3](sbe0521.htm#fr_191) The term var often
means 'lake,' but we are not informed of any Lake Rêvand, though a
mountain of that name is described in § 18; so it seems advisable to
take var here in its wider sense of 'enclosure, circuit, district.'

<span id="fn_192"></span>[39:4](sbe0521.htm#fr_192) The Av. Kadrva-aspa
of Zamyâd Yt. 6.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[39:5](sbe0521.htm#fr_193) See Chap. XXII, 3.
All MSS. have Sôbar here.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[39:6](sbe0521.htm#fr_195) If the circumflex be
used in Pahlavi to indicate not only the consonant d, but also the vowel
î, ê when it follows a vowel, as seems probable, this name can be read
Kôîrâs; in any case, it is evidently intended for the Av. Kaoirisa in
Zamyâd Yt. 6. It is written Kôndras in § 2.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[39:7](sbe0521.htm#fr_196) The Av. Asnav*a*u of
Zamyâd Yt. 5, Âtash Nyây. 5, Sîrôz. 9. See also Chap. XVII, 7.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[39:8](sbe0521.htm#fr_197) The Av. Raoidhitô,
the eighth mountain of Zamyâd Yt. 2.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[39:9](sbe0521.htm#fr_198) So in M6 and the
Pâz. MSS., but K20 has, 'The country mountains.'

<span id="fn_198"></span>[40:1](sbe0521.htm#fr_199) This list is
evidently intended to include the chief mountains known to the author of
the Bundahi*s*, which he could not identify with any of those mentioned
in the Avesta.

<span id="fn_199"></span>[40:2](sbe0521.htm#fr_200) This is the Pâzand
reading of the name, on which very little reliance can be placed; the
Pahlavi can also be read Dâna*d*, and it may be the Deana mountain,
12,000 feet high, near Ka*s*ki-zard.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[40:3](sbe0521.htm#fr_201) See Chap. XXIX, 9.
This volcanic mountain, about 20,000 feet high and near Teheran, still
retains this ancient Persian name, meaning 'wintry.' It is the chief
mountain of the Padashkhvârgar range, which the Bundahi*s* evidently
considers as an offshoot of the Apârsên ranges.

<span id="fn_201"></span>[40:4](sbe0521.htm#fr_202) The present name of
a mountain between Nî*s*âpûr and the desert.
