<p>1. On the nature of men it says in revelation, that G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>, in passing away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, gave forth seed; that seed was thoroughly purified by the motion of</p>

<p>the, light of the sun, and N&ecirc;ry&ocirc;sang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> kept charge of two portions, and Spendarma<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> received one portion. 2. And <I>in</I> forty years, with the shape of a one stemmed R&icirc;v&acirc;s-<I>plant</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> the fifteen years of <I>its</I> fifteen leaves, Matr&ocirc; and Matr&ocirc;y&acirc;&ocirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> grew up from the earth in such a manner that their arms rested behind on <I>their</I> shoulders (d&ocirc;sh), and one joined to the other they were connected together and both alike. 3. And the waists of both of them were brought close <I>and</I> so connected together that it was not clear which is the male and which the female, and which is the <I>one</I> whose living soul (nism&ocirc;) of A&ucirc;harmazd is not away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>. 4. As it is said thus: 'Which is created before, the soul (nism&ocirc;) or the body? And A&ucirc;harmazd said that the soul is created before, and the body after, for him who was</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></p>  
<p>created; it is given into the body that it may produce activity, and the body is created only for activity;' hence the conclusion is this, that the soul (r&ucirc;b&acirc;n) is created before and the body after. 5. And both of them changed from the shape of a plant into the shape of man, <I>and</I> the breath (nism&ocirc;) went spiritually into them, which is the soul (r&ucirc;b&acirc;n); and now, moreover, in that similitude a tree had grown up whose fruit was the ten varieties of man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>6. A&ucirc;harmazd spoke to Mashya <I>and</I> Mashy&ocirc;&icirc; thus: 'You are man, you are the ancestry of the world, and you are created perfect in devotion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by me; perform devotedly the duty of the law, think good thoughts, speak good words, do good deeds, and worship no demons!' 7. Both of them first thought this, that one of them should please the other, as he is a man for him; and the first deed done by them was this, when they went out they washed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> themselves thoroughly; and the first words spoken by them were these, that A&ucirc;harmazd created the water and earth, plants and animals, the stars, moon, and sun, and all prosperity whose origin and effect are from the manifestation of righteousness&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 8. And, afterwards, antagonism rushed into their minds, and their minds were</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_55"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 55</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thoroughly corrupted, and they exclaimed that the evil spirit created the water and earth, plants and animals, <I>and</I> the other things as <I>afore</I>said. 9. That false speech was spoken through the will of the demons, <I>and</I> the evil spirit possessed himself of this first enjoyment from them; through that false speech they both became wicked, and their souls are in hell until the future existence.</p>  
<p>10. And they had gone thirty days without food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, covered with clothing of herbage (giy&acirc;h); <I>and</I> after the thirty days they went forth into the wilderness, came to a white-haired goat, and milked the milk from the udder with their mouths. 11. When they had devoured the milk M&acirc;shya <I>said</I> to M&acirc;shy&ocirc;&icirc; thus: 'My delight was owing to it when I had not devoured the milk, and my delight is more delightful now when it is devoured by my vile body.' 12. That second false speech enhanced the power of the demons, and the taste of the food was taken away by them, so that out of a hundred parts one part remained.</p>  
<p>13. Afterwards, in another thirty days and nights they came to a sheep, fat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> <I>and</I> white-jawed, and they slaughtered <I>it</I>; and fire was extracted by them out of the wood of the lote-plum&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and box-tree, through the guidance of the heavenly angels, since both woods were most productive of fire for them;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and the fire was stimulated by their mouths; and the first fuel kindled by them was dry grass, kend&acirc;r, lotos, date palm leaves, <I>and</I> myrtle; and they made a roast of the sheep. 14. And they dropped three handfuls of the meat into the fire, <I>and</I> said: 'This is the share of the fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' One piece of the rest they tossed to the sky, <I>and</I> said: 'This is the share of the angels.' A bird, the vulture, advanced <I>and</I> carried <I>some</I> of it away from before <I>them</I>, as a dog ate the first meat. 15. And, first, a clothing of skins covered them; afterwards, it is said, woven garments were prepared <I>from</I> a cloth woven&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in the wilderness. 16. And they dug out a pit in the earth, and iron was obtained by them and beaten out with a stone, and without a forge they beat out a cutting edge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_291"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from it; and they cut wood with it, <I>and</I> prepared a wooden shelter from the sun (p&ecirc;<I>s</I>-kh&ucirc;r).</p>  
<p>17. Owing to the gracelessness which they practised, the demons became more oppressive, and they themselves carried on unnatural malice between themselves; they advanced one against the other, <I>and</I> smote and tore <I>their</I> hair <I>and</I> cheeks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 18. Then the demons shouted out of the darkness</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thus: 'You are man; worship the demon! so that your demon of malice may repose.' 19. M&acirc;shya went forth and milked a cow's milk, <I>and</I> poured <I>it</I> out towards the northern quarter; through that the demons became more powerful, and <I>owing to</I> them they both became so dry-backed that in fifty winters they had no desire for intercourse, and though they had had intercourse they would have had no children. 20. And on the completion of fifty years the source of desire arose, first <I>in</I> M&acirc;shya and then <I>in</I> M&acirc;shy&ocirc;&icirc;, for M&acirc;shya said to M&acirc;shy&ocirc;&icirc; thus: 'When I see thy shame my desires arise.' Then M&acirc;shy&ocirc;&icirc; spoke thus: 'Brother M&acirc;shya! when I see thy great desire I am also agitated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' 21. Afterwards, it became their mutual wish that the satisfaction of their desires should be accomplished, as they reflected thus: 'Our duty even for those fifty years was this.'</p>  
<p>22. From them was born in nine months a pair, male and female; <I>and</I> owing to tenderness for offspring&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the mother devoured one, and the father one. 23. And, afterwards, A&ucirc;harmazd took tenderness for offspring away from them, so that <I>one</I> may nourish a child, and the child may remain.</p>  
<p>24. And from them arose seven pairs, male <I>and</I></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A></p>  
<p>female, <I>and</I> each was a brother and sister-wife; and from every one of them, in fifty years, children were born, and they themselves died in a hundred years. 25. of those seven pairs one was S&icirc;y&acirc;kmak, the name of the man, and Na<I>s</I>&acirc;k&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the woman; and from them a pair was born, whose names were Frav&acirc;k of the man and Frav&acirc;ka&icirc;n of the woman. 26. From them fifteen pairs were born, every single pair of whom became a race (sar<I>d</I>ak); and from them the constant continuance of the generations of the world arose.</p>  
<p>27. Owing to the increase (z&acirc;yi<I>s</I>n) of the whole fifteen races, nine races proceeded on the back of the ox Sarsaok&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, through the wide-formed ocean, to the other six regions (k&ecirc;shvar), and stayed there; and six races of men remained in Khvan&icirc;ras. 28. Of those six races the name of the man of one pair was T&acirc;<I>z</I> and of the woman T&acirc;<I>z</I>ak, and they went <I>to</I> the plain of the T&acirc;<I>z</I>&icirc;k&acirc;n (Arabs); and of one pair H&ocirc;shyang&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> was the name of the man and G&ucirc;<I>z</I>ak of the woman, and from them arose the Air&acirc;nak&acirc;n (Iranians); and from one pair the M&acirc;zendar&acirc;n&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_298"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> have arisen. 29. Among the number (pavan a&ecirc; mar) were those who are in the countries</p>

<p>of S&ucirc;r&acirc;k&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, those who are in the country of An&ecirc;r&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_300"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, those who are in the countries of T&ucirc;r, those who are in the country of Salm which is Ar&ucirc;m, those who are in the country of S&ecirc;n&icirc;, that which is <I>K</I>&icirc;n&icirc;st&acirc;n, those who are in the country of D&acirc;&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> those who are in the country of S&icirc;nd&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 30. Those, indeed, throughout the seven regions are all from the lineage of Frav&acirc;k, <I>son</I> of S&icirc;y&acirc;kmak, <I>son of</I> M&acirc;shya.</p>  
<p>31. As there were ten varieties of man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_303"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, <I>and</I> fifteen races from Frav&acirc;k, there were twenty-five races all from the seed of G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I>; <I>the varieties are such</I> as <I>those</I> of the earth, of the water, the breast-eared, the breast-eyed, the one-legged, those also who have wings like a bat, <I>those</I> of the forest, with tails, <I>and</I> who have hair on the body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_275"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_276">52:4</A> See Chap. IV, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_276"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_277">53:1</A> Av. Nairy&ocirc;-sangha of Yas. XVII, 68, LXX, 92, Vend. XIX, 111, 112, XXII, 22, &amp;c.; the angel who is said to be A&ucirc;harmazd's usual messenger to mankind.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_277"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_278">53:2</A> The female archangel who is supposed to have special charge of the earth (see Chap. I, 26).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_278"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_279">53:3</A> A plant allied to the rhubarb, the shoots of which supply an acid juice used by the Persians for acidulating preserves and drinks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_279"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_280">53:4</A> These names are merely variants of the M&acirc;shya and M&acirc;shy&ocirc;&icirc; of the latter part of this chapter (nom. dual, m. and f., of Av. mashya, 'mortal'). This is shown by the Pandn&acirc;mak-i Zarat&ucirc;<I>s</I>t, saying: 'and my human nature is from Matr&ocirc;&icirc;h <I>and</I> Matr&ocirc;-y&acirc;&ocirc;&icirc;h, <I>from</I> which first generation and seed from G&acirc;y&ocirc;mar<I>d</I> I have sprung.' And the names are also found in the more Persian forms Mahar&icirc;h and Mahar&icirc;y&acirc;&ocirc;y&icirc;h (see the note to &sect; 22). Windischmann considered the meaning to be that 'they grew up on the day Mitr&ocirc; of the month Mitr&ocirc;,' that is, the sixteenth day of the seventh month of the Parsi year; this is not confirmed, however, by Z&acirc;<I>d</I>-sparam in his Selections, Chap. X, 4 (see App. to Bund.)</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_280"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_281">53:5</A> That is, whether they had souls or not. That nism&ocirc; is the Huzv&acirc;ri<I>s</I> for r&ucirc;b&acirc;n, 'soul,' appears clearly in &sect; 4, where both words are used for the same thing.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_281"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_282">54:1</A> This evidently refers to another tree, which is supposed to have produced the ten varieties of human monstrosities (see &sect; 31).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_282"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_283">54:2</A> This would be a translation of the Avesta phrase, 'the best of &Acirc;rmaiti (the spirit of the earth).'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_283"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_284">54:3</A> Comparing m&ecirc;<I>g</I>&icirc;<I>d</I> with Pers. ma<I>g</I>&icirc;d; but the verb is very ambiguous, as it may mean, 'they feasted themselves,' or 'they made water.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_284"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_285">54:4</A> The last phrase appears to be quoted from the Pahlavi H&acirc;<I>d</I>&ocirc;kht Nask, I, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_285"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_286">55:1</A> Reading akh&ucirc;ri<I>s</I>n instead of the kh&ucirc;ri<I>s</I>n of all MSS. which is hardly intelligible. Perhaps &acirc;v-kh&ucirc;ri<I>s</I>n, 'drinking water,' ought to be read, as it is alluded to in Chap. XXX, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_286"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_287">55:2</A> Comparing gefar with Av. garewa and Pers. <I>g</I>arb, but this identification may not be correct.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_287"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_288">55:3</A> The k&ucirc;n&acirc;r, a thorny tree, allied to the jujube, which bears a small plum-like fruit.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_288"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_289">56:1</A> Most of this sentence is omitted in K20 by mistake.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_289"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_290">56:2</A> Reading kh&ecirc;<I>s</I>-1-i tad, which Pahlavi words might be easily misread ash&acirc;b&ecirc; ta<I>d</I>, as given in P&acirc;zand in the text. That P&acirc;z. tadha stands for Pahl. ta<I>d</I>ak (Pers. tadah, 'spun, woven') is quite certain.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_290"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_291">56:3</A> Or 'an axe,' according as we read t&ecirc;kh or tash. The order of the foregoing words, bar&acirc; tap&acirc;k-1, 'without a forge,' appears to have been reversed by mistake.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_291"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_292">56:4</A> Reading r&ocirc;<I>d</I> as equivalent to Pers. r&ucirc;&icirc;, 'face,' but it ought to be r&ocirc;d. Perhaps the word is l&ucirc;t, 'bare,' and the translation should be, 'tore <I>their</I> hair bare.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_292"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_293">57:1</A> This is merely a paraphrase of the original.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_293"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_294">57:2</A> Or, 'the deliciousness of children' (sh&icirc;r&icirc;n&icirc;h-i farzand). Justi has, 'owing to an eruption on the children the mother deserted one,' &amp;c.; but the legend of devouring the first children is still more clearly mentioned in the Pahlavi Riv&acirc;yat, which forms the first book of the D&acirc;<I>d</I>ist&acirc;n-i D&icirc;n&icirc;k (preceding the ninety-two questions and answers to which that name is usually applied) as follows: Mahar&icirc;h va Mahar&icirc;y&acirc;&ocirc;y&icirc;h d&ucirc;sh&acirc;ram r&acirc;&icirc; nazdist&ocirc; farzand-i naf<I>s</I>man bar&acirc; va<I>s</I>tam&ucirc;nd, 'Mashya and M&acirc;shy&ocirc;&icirc;, through affection, at first ate up their own offspring.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_295"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_296">58:2</A> See Chaps. XVII, 4, XIX, 13; the name is here written Srisaok in the MSS., and is a P&acirc;zand reading in all three places.</P>

His usual epithet is paradh&acirc;ta (Pahl. p&ecirc;<I>s</I>-d&acirc;<I>d</I>), which is thus explained in the Pahlavi Vend. XX, 7: 'this early law (p&ecirc;s-d&acirc;<I>d</I>&icirc;h) was this, that he first set going the law of sovereignty.' For this reason he is considered to be the founder of the earliest, or P&ecirc;<I>s</I>d&acirc;dian, dynasty. See Chaps. XXXI, 1, XXXIV, 3, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_297"></A><A HREF="sbe0524.htm#fr_298">58:4</A> The people of the southern coast of the Caspian, the M&acirc;zainya da&ecirc;va, 'M&acirc;zainyan demons or idolators,' of the Avesta.</P>

The country of T&ucirc;r was part of the present Turkist&acirc;n, that of Salm is rightly identified with Ar&ucirc;m (the eastern Roman Empire, or Asia Minor) in the text; the country of S&ecirc;n&icirc; (miswritten S&ecirc;nd), being identified with <I>K</I>&icirc;n&icirc;st&acirc;n, was probably the territory of Samarkand, and may perhaps be connected with Mount K&icirc;n&#335; (see Chap. XII, 2, 13); and the land of D&acirc;&icirc; must be sought somewhere in the same neighbourhood.</P>
