### CHAPTER XIV <span id="fr_1852"></span>[4](#fn_1840.md).

0\. May it be in the name of God (yazdân) and the good creation!

1\. When they consecrate a sacred cake (drônô), *and* it becomes demon
worship <span id="fr_1853"></span>[5](#fn_1841.md), what and how many
*things* are not proper?

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

2\. The decision is this:—Whoever knowingly consecrates a sacred cake
with unpurified *sacred* twigs (baresôm-i apâ*d*iyâ*v*) <span
id="fr_1854"></span>[1](#fn_1842.md), or with a twig-bundle the number of
whose twigs (tâk) is *too* many or *too* few, or of another plant not
proper *for sacred* twigs; or holds the end of the twig-bundle to the
north <span id="fr_1855"></span>[2](#fn_1843.md) *and* utters the Avesta
attentively; or whoever consecrates with efficacy unawares, *it* is not
to be considered as uttered by him. 3. *Nor by him* who advertently or
inadvertently takes a taste (*k*âshnîk), not from the sacred cake with
the butter (gâû*s*-daê) <span id="fr_1856"></span>[3](#fn_1844.md), *but*
from the frasast; or takes the prayer (vâ*g*) <span
id="fr_1857"></span>[4](#fn_1845) *inwardly* regarding that cake (drônô.md)
before the officiating priest (zôt) takes a taste from the same cake; or
shall utter the length of a stanza *in* excess, *and* does not again
make a beginning of the *consecration of the* sacred cake; or takes *up*
the

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

dedication *formula* (shnûmanŏ) <span id="fr_1858"></span>[1](#fn_1846.md)
*too* soon or *too* late; or does not utter the Avesta for the fire when
he sees the fire.

4\. This is how it is when the period *of the day* (gâs) <span
id="fr_1859"></span>[2](#fn_1847.md) is retained, and how it should be when
*one* may relinquish *it*; that is, when even one of the stars created
by Aûharmazd is apparent, *it* is retained, *and* when not *it* is
relinquished. 5. It is Vand-Aûharmazd <span
id="fr_1860"></span>[3](#fn_1848.md) *who* said that when, besides
Tî*s*tar, Vanand, or Satavês <span id="fr_1861"></span>[4](#fn_1849.md),
one of the zodiacal *stars* (akhtarîk) is apparent, *it* is retained,
and when not *it* is relinquished. 6. *There* have been *some* who said
that when, besides one of those three, three zodiacal *stars* are
apparent, *it* is retained, and when not *it* is relinquished <span
id="fr_1862"></span>[5](#fn_1850.md).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1840"></span>[369:4](sbe0574.htm#fr_1852.md) This chapter is
also found in L15, fols. 1-4, and a Pâzand version of §§ 1-3 exists in
L22, fols. 126, 127, and L7, fols. 78, 79.

<span id="fn_1841"></span>[369:5](sbe0574.htm#fr_1853.md) That is, it
becomes desecrated through some fault in the ceremony, <span
id="page_370">p. 370</span> for any ceremony, which is too imperfect for
acceptance by the celestial beings, is supposed to be appropriated by
the demons, as performed for their benefit (see Chap. IX, 5). Demon
worship is a term also applied to many other evil actions which are
supposed to give the demons special power over the perpetrator of them.

<span id="fn_1842"></span>[370:1](sbe0574.htm#fr_1854.md) See Chap. III,
32, note.

<span id="fn_1843"></span>[370:2](sbe0574.htm#fr_1855.md) The supposed
direction of the demons (see Chaps. X, 7, XII, 18). When praying, a
Parsi must face either the sun, or a fire or lamp; and when the
direction of the sun is doubtful, or when it is nearly overhead, he must
face to the south, even when he is in so low a latitude that the sun may
be somewhat to the north of him.

<span id="fn_1844"></span>[370:3](sbe0574.htm#fr_1856.md) Which usually
takes the place of the meat-offering mentioned in Chap. XI, 4-6, and is
placed upon one of the cakes on the left side of the table during
consecration, while the frasasts are the cakes on the right-hand side of
the table (see Chap. III, 32, note).

<span id="fn_1845"></span>[370:4](sbe0574.htm#fr_1857.md) That is, prepares
for eating by muttering the portion of the grace which is to be recited
in a low murmur before eating (see Chap. III, 6, note). This clause is
omitted in K20.

<span id="fn_1846"></span>[371:1](sbe0574.htm#fr_1858.md) See Chaps. III,
35, VII, 8.

<span id="fn_1847"></span>[371:2](sbe0574.htm#fr_1859.md) See Bund. XXV, 9.
The text appears to refer to the transition from the Ushahina to the
Hâvani Gâh at daybreak; and as certain portions of the prayers are
varied according to the period of the day, it is very necessary to know
precisely when each period commences, so as to avoid vitiating the whole
ceremonial by the use of a wrong prayer.

<span id="fn_1848"></span>[371:3](sbe0574.htm#fr_1860.md) See Chap. I, 4,
note.

<span id="fn_1849"></span>[371:4](sbe0574.htm#fr_1861.md) Three of the
leading stars, probably Sirius, Fomalhaut, and Antares (see Bund. II,
7).

<span id="fn_1850"></span>[371:5](sbe0574.htm#fr_1862.md) This chapter is
followed (in both the old MSS. M6 and K20) by the Pahlavi text of the
Patît-i Khû*d*, or renunciation of one's own *sin*, a translation of
which will be found in Bleeck's English version of the Avesta, London,
1864, III, pp. 159-162, derived from Spiegel's German translation of the
Pâzand text. This translation is fairly correct on the whole, although
some passages might be improved, thus (p. 16 2), instead of 'all sins
which may attack the character of man \[or\] have attacked my character,
if I, on account of much death, have not recognised the death,' &c., we
should read 'of all sins which may become the lot of men, and have
become my lot, on account of whose excessive number I do not know the
number,' &c.
