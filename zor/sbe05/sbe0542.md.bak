### \[CHAPTER XXXIII <span id="fr_858"></span>[1](#fn_852.md).

0\. The family of the Môbads ('priests').

1\. Bahak <span id="fr_859"></span>[2](#fn_853.md) *was* son of Hûbakht,
*son* of Âtarô-bôndak, *son* of Mâhda*d*, *son* of Mê*d*yôk-mâh, *son*
of Frâh-vakhsh-vindâ*d* <span id="fr_860"></span>[3](#fn_854.md), *son* of
Mê*d*yôk-mâh, *son* of Kâ*d* <span id="fr_861"></span>[4](#fn_855.md),
*son* of Mê*d*yôk-mâh, *son* of Ârâstih, *son* of Paîtirâsp <span

(high-priest) unto Shâhpûhar <span id="fr_863"></span>[6](#fn_857.md), son
of Aûharmazd, *so* Kâ*d* was the great preceptor (farmâ*d*âr) unto
Dârâî <span id="fr_864"></span>[7](#fn_858.md).

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Frashâîtar <span
id="fr_868"></span>[1](#fn_862.md), *son* of Pôrûshasp, *son* of Vînâsp,
*son* of Nivar, *son* of Vakhsh, *son* of Vahidhrôs, *son* of Fra*s*t,

6\. Mitrô-akâvî*d* *is son* of Mar*d*ân-vêh <span

The mother from whom I was born is Hûmâî, daughter of Freh-mâh, who also
*was* the righteous daughters <span id="fr_875"></span>[8](#fn_869.md)

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

Vindâ*d*-i-pê*d*âk, *son* of Vâê-bûkht, *son* of Bahak, *son* of
Vâê-bûkht.

9\. All the other Môbads who have been renowned in the empire
(khû*d*âyîh) *were* from the same family it is said, *and* were of this
race of Mânû*sk*îhar <span id="fr_876"></span>[1](#fn_870.md). 10. Those
Môbads, likewise, who now exist are all from the same family they
assert, and I, too, they boast, whom they call <span
id="fr_877"></span>[2](#fn_871.md) 'the administration of perfect
rectitude' (Dâ*d*akîh-i Ashôvahi*s*tô) <span
id="fr_878"></span>[3](#fn_872.md). 11. Yûdân-Yim *son* of Vâhrâm-shâ*d*,

*son* of Yûdân-Yim <span id="fr_880"></span>[1](#fn_874.md), Âtarô-pâ*d*
son of Hâmî*d* <span id="fr_881"></span>[2](#fn_875.md), Ashôvahi*s*t *son*
of Freh-Srôsh, *and* the other Môbads have sprung from the same family.

12\. This, too, it says, that 'in one winter I *will* locate (*g*âkînam)
the religion of the Mazdayasnians, *which* came out into the other six
regions.'\]

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_852"></span>[145:1](sbe0542.htm#fr_858.md) This chapter is
found only in TD, where it forms a continuation of the preceding, and
affords a means (see §§ 10, 11) for determining the age of the recension
of the text contained in that MS. As nearly all the names are written,
in Pahlavi letters, the pronunciation of many of them is merely a matter
of guess.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[145:2](sbe0542.htm#fr_859.md) Here written Bôhak,
but it is Bahak or Bâk in § 2; compare Bâhak in § 3, and Av. B*a*ungha
of Fravardîn Yt. 124.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[145:3](sbe0542.htm#fr_860.md) Compare Av.
Frashâvakhsha of Fravardîn Yt. 109.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[145:4](sbe0542.htm#fr_861.md) Compare Av. Kâta of
Fravardîn Yt. 124.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[145:5](sbe0542.htm#fr_862.md) See Chap. XXXII, 2,
for the last three generations; TD has Pîrtarâsp here, like the variant
of M6 in Chap. XXXII, 1.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[145:6](sbe0542.htm#fr_863.md) The Sasanian king
Shâpûr II, who reigned A.D. 309-379.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[145:7](sbe0542.htm#fr_864.md) According to the
chronology of the Bundahi*s* (Chap. XXXIV, 8, 9), Dârâî lived only some
four centuries before Shâpûr II, for which period only seven generations
of priests are here provided. This period, moreover, is certainly about
three centuries less than the truth.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[145:8](sbe0542.htm#fr_865.md) This priest was
prime minister of Shâpûr II.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[145:9](sbe0542.htm#fr_866.md) Compare Av. Fryâna
of Yas. XLV, 12.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[145:10](sbe0542.htm#fr_867.md) This name is
repeated in TD, probably by mistake (compare Bahak in §§ 1, 2).

<span id="fn_862"></span>[146:1](sbe0542.htm#fr_868.md) This is probably a
semi-Huzvâri*s* form of Frashô*s*tar.

<span id="fn_863"></span>[146:2](sbe0542.htm#fr_869.md) Perhaps this name
should be read along with the next one, so as to give the single Pâzand
name *S*kina*s* or *S*kiva*s*.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[146:3](sbe0542.htm#fr_870.md) See Chap. XXXII, 1,
for the last three generations. According to this genealogy Âtarôpâ*d*-i
Mâraspendân was the twenty-third in descent from Mânû*sk*îhar, whereas
his contemporary, Bahak (§ 1), was twenty-second in descent from the
same.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[146:4](sbe0542.htm#fr_871.md) No doubt
Mânû*sk*îhar is meant; if not, we must read Mânû*s*-dûrnâmîk in
connection with § 5.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[146:5](sbe0542.htm#fr_872.md) Here written
Nî*d*ar, but see Chaps. XXIX, 6, XXXI, 13.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[146:6](sbe0542.htm#fr_873.md) Here written
Mar*d*-vêh, but see § 8.

<span id="fn_868"></span>[146:7](sbe0542.htm#fr_874.md) Here written
Aê-vûkht, but see § 8; it may be Vîs-bûkht, or Vê*s*-bûkht.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[146:8](sbe0542.htm#fr_875.md) The text is
amî*d*ar mûna*s* li a*g*a*s* zerkhûn*d* Hûmôî dûkht-i Freh-mâh-i*k*
aharôb vûkht (dûkht?). We might perhaps read 'Freh-mâh *son* of
*K*ahârôb-bûkht,' but it seems more probable that §§ 7, 8 should be
connected, and that the meaning intended is that Hûmâî was daughter of
Freh-mâh (of a certain family) and of Pûyi*s*n-shâ*d* (of another
family); she was also the mother of the editor of that recension of the
Bundahi*s* which is contained in TD; but who was his father? The
singularly unnecessary repetition of the genealogy of the two brothers,
Mitrô-akâvî*d* and Pûyi*s*n-shâ*d*, in §§ 6, 8, leads to the suspicion
that if the latter <span id="page_147">p. 147</span> were his mother's
father, the former was probably his own father or grandfather.
Unfortunately the text makes no clear statement on the subject, and § 10
affords further material for guessing otherwise at his name and
connections.

<span id="fn_870"></span>[147:1](sbe0542.htm#fr_876.md) Compare Chap.
XXXII, 4.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[147:2](sbe0542.htm#fr_877.md) Reading va lî*k*
laband-i karîtûnd.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[147:3](sbe0542.htm#fr_878.md) This looks more
like a complimentary title than a name, and if the editor of the TD
recension of the Bundahi*s* were the son or grandson of Mitrô-akâvî*d*
(§ 6) we have no means of ascertaining his name; but if he were not
descended from Mitrô-akâvî*d* it is possible that §§ 10, 11 should be
read together, and that he was the son of Yûdân-Yim. Now we know, from
the heading and colophon of the ninety-two questions and answers on
religious subjects which are usually called the Dâ*d*istân-i Dînîk, and
from the colophons of other writings which usually accompany that work,
that those answers were composed and certain epistles were written by
Mânû*sk*îhar, son of Yûdân-Yim, who was high-priest of Pârs and Kirmân
in A.Y. 250 (A.D. 881), and apparently a more important personage than
his (probably younger) brother Zâ*d*-sparham, who is mentioned in § 11
as one of the priests contemporary with the editor of the TD recension.
If this editor, therefore, were a son of Yûdân-Yim (which is a possible
interpretation of the text) he was most probably this same Mânû*sk*îhar,
author of the Dâ*d*istân-i Dînîk (see the Introduction. § 4).

<span id="fn_873"></span>[147:4](sbe0542.htm#fr_879.md) The last name is
very probably superfluous, Zâ*d*-sparham <span id="page_148">p.
148</span> having been written twice most likely by mistake. This
Âtarô-pâ*d* son of Mâraspend was probably the one mentioned in the
following extract from the old Persian Rivâyat MS., No. 8 of the
collection in the Indian Office Library at London (fol. 142 a):—

'The book Dînkar*d* which the dastûrs of the religion and the ancients
have compiled, likewise the blessed Âdarbâd son of Mahrasfend, son of
Asavahist of the people of the good religion, in the year three hundred
of Yazda*g*ard Shahryâr, collected some of the more essential mysteries
of the religion as instruction, and of these he formed this book.' That
is, he was the last editor of the Dînka*r*d, which seems to have
remained unrevised since his time, as the present copies have descended
from the MS. preserved by his family and first copied in A.Y. 369.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[148:1](sbe0542.htm#fr_880.md) Zâ*d*-sparham was
brother of the author of the Dâ*d*istân-i Dînîk; he was high-priest at
Sîrkân in the south, and evidently had access to the Bundahi*s*, of part
of which he wrote a paraphrase (see Appendix). His name is usually
written Zâ*d*-sparam.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[148:2](sbe0542.htm#fr_881.md) In the history of
the Dînka*r*d, given at the end of its third book (see Introd. to
Farhang-i Oîm-khadûk, p. xxxiv), we are told as follows:—

'After that, the well-meaning Âtarô-pâ*d* son of Hêmî*d*, who was the
leader of the people of the good religion, compiled, with the assistance
of God, through inquiry, investigation, and much trouble, a new means of
producing remembrance of the Mazdayasnian religion.' He did this, we are
further told, by collecting all the decaying literature and perishing
traditions into a work 'like the great original Dînkar*d*, of a thousand
chapters' (mânâk-i zak rabâ bûn Dînô-kartô 1000-darakŏ). We thus learn
from external sources that the group of contemporary priests, mentioned
in the text, was actively employed (about A.D. 900) in an attempted
revival of the religious literature of the Mazdayasnians, to which we
owe either the revision or compilation of such works as the Dînkar*d*,
Dâ*d*istân-i Dînîk, and Bundahi*s*.
