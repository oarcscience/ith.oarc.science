## SHAYÂST LA-SHAYÂST

## PART I.—*The Original Treatise*.

### CHAPTER I.

0\. In the name of God, (yazdân) and the good creation may there be the
good health, long life, and abundant wealth of all the good and the
right-doers specially for him whose writing I am <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[1](#fn_1219.md).

1\. As revealed by the Avesta, it is said in the Vendidad <span
id="fr_1227"></span>[2](#fn_1220) that these seven degrees (pâyak.md) of
sin

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

are mentioned in revelation, *which* are Farmân, Âgerept,
Avôirî*s*t <span id="fr_1228"></span>[1](#fn_1221.md), Aredû*s*, Khôr,
Bâ*z*âî, Yât, and Tanâpûhar <span id="fr_1229"></span>[2](#fn_1222.md). 2.
A Farmân is the weight of four

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

stîrs, and each stîr is four dirhams (*g*û*g*an) <span
id="fr_1230"></span>[1](#fn_1223.md); of Âgerept and Avôirî*s*t that which
is least is a scourging (tâ*z*ânŏ), and the amount of them which was
specially *that* which is most is said *to be* one dirham <span
id="fr_1231"></span>[2](#fn_1224.md); an Aredû*s* is thirty *stîrs* <span
id="fr_1232"></span>[3](#fn_1225.md); a Khôr is sixty stîrs; a Bâ*z*âî is
ninety stîrs; a Yât is a hundred and eighty stîrs; and a Tanâpûhar is
three hundred stîrs <span id="fr_1233"></span>[4](#fn_1226.md).

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

In the administration of the primitive faith <span
id="fr_1234"></span>[1](#fn_1227.md) there are *some* who have been of
different opinions

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

about it, for Gôgô*s*asp <span id="fr_1235"></span>[1](#fn_1228.md) spoke
otherwise than the teaching <span id="fr_1236"></span>[2](#fn_1229.md)
(*k*â*s*tak) of Âtarô-Aûharmazd <span id="fr_1237"></span>[3](#fn_1230.md),
and Sôshyans <span id="fr_1238"></span>[4](#fn_1231.md) *otherwise* than
the teaching of Âtarô-frôbâg Nôsâî <span
id="fr_1239"></span>[5](#fn_1232.md), and Mê*d*ôk-mâh <span
id="fr_1240"></span>[6](#fn_1233.md) *otherwise* than the teaching of
Gôgô*s*asp <span id="fr_1241"></span>[7](#fn_1234.md), and Afarg <span
id="fr_1242"></span>[8](#fn_1235.md) *otherwise* than the teaching

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

of Sôshyans. 4. And all those of the primitive faith rely upon these
six <span id="fr_1243"></span>[1](#fn_1236.md) teachings, and there are
*some* who rely more weakly and some more strongly *upon some* of them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1219"></span>[239:1](sbe0561.htm#fr_1226.md) See the note on
B. Yt. I, 0.

<span id="fn_1220"></span>[239:2](sbe0561.htm#fr_1227.md) Referring to
Vend. IV, 54-114, where seven classes of assault and their respective
punishments are detailed. In our text eight classes of sin are named,
although only seven degrees are mentioned; the second and third classes
being apparently arranged together, as one degree of sin in § 2. Or the
inconsistency may have arisen from the addition of the Farmân, a class
of sin or crime not mentioned in the Vendidad, unless, indeed, it be the
farmân spôkhtanŏ, 'neglect of commandment' (referring probably to
priest's commands), of Pahl. Vend. VI, 15. The other seven classes are
thus described in Pahl. Vend. IV, 54-57, 79, 85, 93, 99, 106:—

'By the man whose weapon (or blow) is upraised for striking a man, that
which is his Âgerept is thus implanted in *him*. When it *has* moved
forward—that is, he makes *it* advance—*it* is thus his Avôirî*s*t, that
is, Avôirî*s*t is implanted in him *and* the Âgerept merges into it,
some say that it does not exist. When he comes on to him *with* thoughts
of malice—that is, he places a hand upon him—*it* is thus his Aredû*s*,
that is, Aredû*s* is implanted in him and the Avôirî*s*t merges into it,
some say that it does not exist. *At* the fifth Aredû*s* the man even
becomes a Tanâpûhar; *things* at <span id="page_240">p. 240</span>
sunrise (a*v*ar-khûrshê*d*îh) and in the forenoon (*k*âîtîh = *k*âstîh)
are no more apart. . . . Whoever inflicts the Aredû*s* blow on a man *it
is* one-fifth of a wound (rêsh). . . . Whoever inflicts that which is a
cruel Khôr ('hurt') on a man *it is* one-fourth of a wound. . . .
Whoever inflicts that which is a bleeding Khôr on a man *it is*
one-third of a wound. . . . Whoever shall give a man a bone-breaking
Khôr *it is* half a wound.... Whoever strikes a man the blow *which puts
him* out of consciousness shall give a whole wound.'

This description does not mention Bâ*z*âî and Yât, unless they be the
two severer kinds of Khôr; but, Bâ*z*âî occurs in Pahl. Vend. IV, 115,
V, 107, XIII, 38, though Yât seems not to be mentioned in the Vendidad.
Aredû*s* occurs again in Pahl. Vend. III, 151, and Khôr in Pahl. Vend.
III, 48, XIII, 38, and Yas. LVI, iv, 2.

<span id="fn_1221"></span>[240:1](sbe0561.htm#fr_1228.md) Also written
a*v*ôîri*s*t, avîri*s*t, aîvîri*s*t, avôkîri*s*t, and avakôri*s*t in
other places.

<span id="fn_1222"></span>[240:2](sbe0561.htm#fr_1229.md) Five of these
names are merely slight alterations of the Av. âgerepta, avaoiri*s*ta,
aredu*s*, *hv*ara, and tanuperetha (peretôtanu or peshôtanu). The last
seven degrees are also noticed in a very obscure passage in Farh. Okh.
pp. 36, 37 (correcting the text from the old MSS. M6 and K20) as
follows:—

'Âgerept, "seized," is that when they shall take up a weapon for smiting
an innocent *person*; Avôirî*s*t, "turning," is that when *one* turns
the weapon upon an innocent *person*; when through sinfulness *one* lays
the weapon on a sinner the name is Aredû*s*; for whatever reaches the
source of life the name is Khôr; *one* explains Bâ*z*âî *as* "smiting,"
*and* Yât *as* "going to," *and* the soul of man ought to be
withstanding, *as* a counterstroke is the penalty for a Yât when it
*has* been so much *away* from the abode of life. *In* like manner
Âgerept, Avôirî*s*t, Aredû*s*, Khôr, Bâ*z*âî, and Yât are also called
good works, *which* are performed in like proportions, *and* are called
by the names of weights and measures *in* the same manner. Of
peshôtanu*s* tanûm pairyêitê the meaning is a Tanâpûhar; as they call a
good work of three hundred a Tanâpûhar, on account of the three hundred
like proportions of the same kind, the meaning of its name, Tanâpûhar,
thereupon enters into sin. . . . A Khôr is just that description of
wound from which <span id="page_241">p. 241</span> the blood comes,
irrespective of where, how, how much, *and* wherewith it is inflicted;
*it is* that which is a wound from the beginning, *and* that which will
result therefrom.'

The application of this scale of offences is, however, not confined to
these particular forms of assault, but has been extended (since the
Avesta was compiled) to all classes of sins, and also to the good works
which are supposed to counterbalance them.

<span id="fn_1223"></span>[241:1](sbe0561.htm#fr_1230.md) The dirham has
been variously estimated, at different times, as a weight of forty-five
to sixty-seven grains, but perhaps fifty grains may be taken as the
meaning of the text, and the stîr may, therefore, be estimated at 200
grains. The Greeks used both these weights, which they called δραχμή and
στατήρ.

<span id="fn_1224"></span>[241:2](sbe0561.htm#fr_1231.md) The amounts of
these first three degrees of sin are differently stated in other places
(see Chaps. XI, 2, XVI, 1-3, 5). It is difficult to understand why the
amounts of Âgerept and Avôirî*s*t should here be stated as less than
that of Farmân, and some Parsis, therefore, read vîhast (as an irregular
form of vîst, 'twenty') instead of vê*s*-ast, 'is most,' so that they
may translate the amount as 'twenty dirhams;' but to obtain this result
they would have to make further alterations in the Pahlavi text. In a
passage quoted by Spiegel (in his Traditionelle Literatur der Parsen, p.
88) from the Rivâyat MS. P12, in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris, it
is stated that Farmân is seven stîrs, Âgerept twelve stîrs, and
Avôirî*s*t fifteen stîrs. Another Rivâyat makes the Farmân eight stîrs.

<span id="fn_1225"></span>[241:3](sbe0561.htm#fr_1232.md) All MSS. have
Aredû*s* sî 30, 'an Aredû*s* is thirty (30),' leaving it doubtful
whether dirhams or stîrs are meant; and the same mode of writing is
adopted in Chap. XI, 2.

<span id="fn_1226"></span>[241:4](sbe0561.htm#fr_1233.md) All authorities
agree about the amounts of the last five degrees of sin. These amounts
are the supposed weights of the several sins in the golden scales of the
angel Rashnû (see AV. V, 5), when the soul is called to account, for its
actions during life, after the <span id="page_242">p. 242</span> third
night after death (see Mkh. II, 114-122). Its sins are supposed to be
then weighed against its good works, which are estimated by the same
scale of degrees (see the passage already quoted from Farh. Okh. in p.
240, note 2), and it is sent direct to heaven, or hell, or an
intermediate place, according as the good works or sins preponderate, or
are both equal. In the Avesta of the Vendidad, however, whence these
degrees are derived, we find them forming merely a graduated scale of
assaults, extending from first lifting the hand to smite even unto
manslaughter; and for each of these seven degrees of assault a scale of
temporal punishments is prescribed, according to the number of times the
offence has been committed. These punishments consist of a uniform
series of lashes with a horse-whip or scourge, extending from a minimum
of five lashes to a maximum of two hundred (see Vend. IV, 58-114); each
degree of assault commencing at a different point on the scale of
punishments for the first offence, and gradually rising through the
scale with each repetition of the offence, so that the more aggravated
assaults attain the maximum punishment by means of a smaller number of
repetitions. Thus, the punishments prescribed for Âgerepta, from the
first to the eighth offence, are 5, 10, 15, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 200
lashes respectively; those for Avaoiri*s*ta, from the first to the
seventh offence, extend on the same scale from 10 to 200 lashes; those
for Aredu*s*, from the first to the sixth offence, are from 15 to 200
lashes; those for a bruised hurt (*hv*ara), from the first to the fifth
offence, are from 30 to 200 lashes; those for a bleeding hurt, from the
first to the fourth offence, are from 50 to 200 lashes; those for a
bone-breaking hurt, from the first to the third offence, are from 70 to
200 lashes; and those for a hurt depriving of consciousness or life, for
the first and second offences, are 90 and 200 lashes. The maximum
punishment of 200 lashes is prescribed only when the previous offences
have not been atoned for, and it is to be inflicted in all such cases,
however few or trifling the previous assaults have been.

<span id="fn_1227"></span>[242:1](sbe0561.htm#fr_1234.md) In M6
pôryô*d*kêshîh, but pôryô*d*kêshân, 'of those of the primitive faith,'
in K20; from the Av. paoiryô*d*kaêsha of Yas. I, 47, III, 65, IV, 53,
XXII, 33, Fravardîn Yt. 0, 90, 156, Âf. Rapithwin, 2. It is a term
applied to what is considered as the <span id="page_243">p. 243</span>
true Mazdayasnian religion in all ages, both before and after the time
of Zaratû*s*t.

<span id="fn_1228"></span>[243:1](sbe0561.htm#fr_1235.md) One of the old
commentators whose opinions are frequently quoted in Pahlavi books, as
in Chap. II, 74, 82, 119, Pahl. Vend. III, 48, 138, 151, IV, 35, V, 14,
121, VI, 9, 64, VII, 6, 136, VIII, 64, 236, XV, 35, 48, 56, 67, XVI, 5,
XVIII, 98, 124, and thirteen times in the Nîrangistân. His name is
sometimes written Gô*s*asp (as it is here both in M6 and K20) and
sometimes Gôgô*s*ôsp.

<span id="fn_1229"></span>[243:2](sbe0561.htm#fr_1236.md) Probably a
written exposition or commentary is meant.

<span id="fn_1230"></span>[243:3](sbe0561.htm#fr_1237.md) This commentator
is mentioned once in the Nîrangistân as Âtarô Aûharmazdân.

<span id="fn_1231"></span>[243:4](sbe0561.htm#fr_1238.md) This commentator
is mentioned in Chaps. II, 56, 74, 80, 118, 119, III, 13, VI, 4, 5; also
in Pahl. Vend. III, 64, 69, 151, IV, 6, V, 48, 80, 107, 121, 146, 153,
VI, 15, 64, 73, VII, 4, 136, 168, VIII, 28, 59, 303, IX, 184, XIII, 20,
XVI, 7, 10, 17, 20-22, 27, XVIII, 98, and forty-six times in the
Nîrangistân. He was a name-sake of the last of the future apostles and
sons of Zaratû*s*t (see Bund. XXXII, 8), and his name is often written
Sôshâns and read Saoshyôs or Sôsyô*s* by Pâzand writers.

<span id="fn_1232"></span>[243:5](sbe0561.htm#fr_1239.md) This commentator
is mentioned once in the Nîrangistân, and may probably be the
Âtarô-frôbâg of B. Yt. I, 7; compare also Nôsâî Bûr*z* Mitrô, the name
of another commentator, in Chap. VIII, 18.

<span id="fn_1233"></span>[243:6](sbe0561.htm#fr_1240.md) This commentator
is mentioned in Chaps. II, 1, 11, 12, 89, V, 5, 6; also in Pahl. Vend.
III, 151, V, 6, 58, 107, VIII, 48, 110, IX, 132, XIII, 99, XIV, 37, and
four times in the Nîrangistân. His name is sometimes written
Mê*d*yôk-mâh or Mâî*d*ôk-mâh, and he was a namesake of Zaratû*s*t's
cousin and first disciple (see Bund. XXXII, 2, 3). The Va*g*arkar*d*-i
Dînîk professes to have been compiled by Mê*d*yôk-mâh, but there appear
to have been several priests of this name (see Bund. XXXIII, 1).

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[243:7](sbe0561.htm#fr_1241.md) Gô*s*asp in M6.

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[243:8](sbe0561.htm#fr_1242.md) This commentator
is mentioned in Chaps. II, 2, 64, 73, 88, 115, V, 5, 6; also in Pahl.
Vend. III, 48, 115, V, 6, 14, 22, 58, <span id="page_244">p. 244</span>
146, VI, 9, VII, 6, 61, 93, 136, VIII, 48, 64, 110, 250, IX, 132, XIII,
99, XIV, 14, 37, XIX, 84, Pahl. Yas. LXIV, 37, once in Farh. Okh., and
thirty-eight times in the Nîrangistân.

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[244:1](sbe0561.htm#fr_1243.md) Both MSS. have
'three,' although four teachings and six commentators are mentioned in
the previous section, and a fifth 'teaching' is mentioned in Chap. II,
2. The original reading was more probably 'six' than 'four', as a
Pahlavi 'six' requires merely the omission of a cipher to become
'three,' whereas a Pahlavi 'four' must be altered to produce the same
blunder.

Several other commentators are mentioned in Pahlavi books, such
Âtarô-pâ*d*, son of Dâ*d*-farukh, twice in the Nîrangistân;
Âzâ*d*-mar*d* nine times in Nîr.; Barôshand Aûharmazd once in Nîr.;
Dâ*d* Aûharmazd in B. Yt. I, 1, 7, III, 16, Pahl. Yas. X, 57, XI, 22;
Dâ*d*-farukh in Pahl. Vend. V, 112, VI, 64, and twice in Nîr.;
Dâ*d*-i-vêh seventeen times in Nîr.; Farukhŏ thrice in Nîr.;
Kîrâtanŏ-bûgê*d* in Pahl. Vend. V, 80, VI, 15, IX, 184, XIII, 20, he is
called the Kirmânîk in Pahl. Vend. IV, 35, and Dastûr Hoshangji thinks
his name is merely a variant of the next; Kûshtanŏ-bû*g*ê*d* in Sls. II,
57, 81, 118, VI, 6, VIII, 17, Pahl. Vend. III, 64, 69, IV, 6, V, 48, VI,
53, 64, 73, VIII, 28, XVI, 17, 21, 22, 27, and twenty-two times in Nîr.;
Mâh-Aûharmazd in Pahl. Vend. VII, 82; Mâh-gô*s*aspŏ, Mâh-gô*s*ôspŏ,
Mâh-gôspŏ, or Mâh-vasp in Pahl. Yas. IX, 33, Pahl. Vend. III, 138, and
ten times in Nîr.; Mâhvand-dâ*d* or Mâh-vindâ*d* in B. Yt. III, 3, Pahl.
Yas. IX, 33, X, 57, XI, 22, XIX, 27; Mar*d*-bû*d* in Sls. II, 96, and
twice in Nîr., where he is called the son of Dâ*d*gun; Nêryôsang in Sls.
VIII, 13, Pahl. Vend. V, 22; Nikhshâpûhar, or Nîshapûhar in Pahl. Vend.
III, 151, V, 112, VI, 71, VIII, 64, XVI, 10, AV. I, 35, and twenty-four
times in Nîr.; Nôsâî Bûr*z*-Mitrô in Sls. VIII, 18; Parîk or Pîrîk in
Pahl. Vend. III, 138, V, 14, 134, VII, 82, 93, VIII, 64, and once in
Nîr.; Rôshan or Rôshanô (which, as the *S*ikand-gûmânî states, was the
name of a commentary written by Rôshan son of Âtarô-frôbâg) in Sls. II,
39, 86, 107, B. Yt. III, 3, Pahl. Yas. IX, 5, 14, Pahl. Vend. III, 48,
V, 112, 134, 176, VII, 93, XVII, 11, and eleven times in Nîr.; disciples
of Vakht-âfrî*d*ŏ (possibly the Bakht-âfrî*d* of Sls. XX, 11, B. Yt. I,
7) are mentioned once in Nîr.; Vand-Aûharmazd in Sls. II, 2, 6, 44, XIV,
5, Pahl. Vend. VI, 73; and Vêh-dôst once in <span id="page_245">p.
245</span> the Nîrangistân. It must, however, be observed that the
reading of some of these names is very uncertain.
